Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire;this also is vanity and a striving after wind.1Introduction: you cannot always get what you wantWhy begin a book on, primarily, Buddhism with a quote from the Bible? WhileBuddhism, as found in the Pali Canon, is my prime interest, I wish to state fromthe outset that my horizons here are broad. I will offer the rationale for thisshortly, but let me make clear that what I am interested in here is desire. TheBuddhist material is here because I have come to the view that it offers one ofthe best ways of moving towards an understanding of desire. Anything else thatI have felt may do the same has therefore come into the orbit of my concerns.But why ‘desire’? I believe Buddhist thought – as found in the Pali Canon – offersa profundity of insight on this topic. Further to this, it is a concept we all, on somelevel, have daily familiarity with; while, at the same time, often giving it little or nosustained attention or reflection. Desire is both familiar and strange to us.Buddhism offers a model of desire that is distinct from, but finds echoes in,Western philosophy (and to an extent psychology). It also is related, in variousways, to the Brahmanic traditions which existed prior to, alongside, and beyondthe composition of the Pali Canon. The texts of early Buddhism offer us a way toexecute radical interventions in the mechanics of our desiring. These interventions,via a self-initiated transformation of consciousness, can lead us, it is claimed, tolive less harmful and more satisfying lives. Our lives can become such that ourinteraction with sense-objects is not invariably tainted by an impossible anddamaging chase after mind-constructed ideals of permanence and substantiality.In this introduction, I set out the concerns that I shall follow up throughout thebook, and I have also felt it necessary to address a small number of themes, suchas the translation of kusalaas ‘skilful’, and the problems of addressing particularly‘spiritual’2topics in language.INTRODUCTIONDesire, morality and approaches1"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The paradox of desireIt is an oversimplification of the Buddhist position to assume that itseeks an end of all desire. Such a view, however, is not uncommon.3Many see desire in Buddhism as a single thing – not seeing the subtle range oftypes of wanting which are at play in the texts (and Buddhist practice). It is worthkeeping this in mind when we consider the notion of a ‘paradox of desire’:If I desire to cease desiring then I have not ceased all desire after all;I have merely replaced one species of desiring by another. The paradoxof desire points to the practical contradiction or frustration involved inthe desire to stop all desiring and states simply that those who desire tostop all desiring will never be successful.4The piece from which I take this quote, and the set of articles in the subsequentissue of Philosophy East & Westthat replied to it, were the starting point for myinitial thoughts about the nature and status of desire in Buddhism. In the end I havecome to the conclusion that these articles are, to a large extent, undermined bya misconceived view of the actual Buddhist position, but I will come to that shortly.Initially I want to explain why this topic piqued my interest. In my student daysstudying Buddhism, I was aware of a general negative attitude to desire inBuddhism. Or so I thought. What I was actually cognisant of was a description ofBuddhism as having such an attitude in secondary Western literature on Buddhism.Then, when I came to consider the topic for this present study, I began with anexamination of the Four Noble Truths.In reading around this topic, I became preoccupied with the second truth – thatof craving (tajha) as the basis of suffering (dukkha). It soon became clear thatthere was a lot more to this topic than I had realised. This drew me tothePhilosophy East & Westarticles, and in the end to the production of this book.To return to this notion of a paradox of desire, it is most easily seen in the senseof ‘if I desire to end desire, I can never do so’. A. L. Herman’s approach, in the piececited above, is to contrast the desire for desirelessness with the notion of ‘letting-go’.He draws on his reading of Madhyamika Buddhism to claim that the realisation thatdesire can never take us beyond desire, is the basis for achieving that very goal:That is to say, seeing that there is no way out of the paradox of desire,understanding that, as Madhyamika Buddhism puts it, there is no way tonirvaja, no goal to be desired or achieved, then one ‘lets go’ of the wayand the goal. And that ‘letting go’ leads to, or is, nirvaja.5There are numerous things here that deserve comment. First, Herman goes beyondthe type of Buddhism that I am interested in here, so I make no assessment of theaccuracy of his portrayal of Madhyamika thought.INTRODUCTION2"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Second, as I discuss in Chapter 3, there do seem to be types of desiringthat Buddhism does not condemn as unskilful (akusala – this term is discussedlater in this Introduction). The assessment of desire in his piece is too straight-forward – there is little sense of qualitative distinctions between types of desire.Third, does he not fail within even his own terms of reference? How do we getto ‘letting go’? Do we have to desire this letting-go in order to achieve it – or is thisis as doomed as desiring nibbana? He does offer a graduated path to the letting go,the key stage of which is the realisation of the paradox of desire. He sees ZenBuddhism as the final culmination of this trend – but I am not sure this is accurate.Further, the whole approach is based, on my reading, of a rejection of the Canonicalinjunctions regarding desire in general, and tajhain particular. If Buddhism con-sists of something other than the overcoming of at least certain types of desire, whydo we find so much of the tradition recommending that we encounter and overcomeour desirous nature?In response to Herman’s piece, Wayne Alt argued that there was no paradox –as the desire to end desire evaporated once successful: hence leaving us with nodesire, by means of desiring this state:Suppose I desire16to eliminate desire2. If I satisfy desire1, that is, ifI actually manage to eliminate desire2, then desire1 will thereby be elim-inated. For the satisfaction of any desire is tantamount to its elimination.So it appears that desire1, like any other desire, can be eliminated after all.Someone might reply that desire2 cannot be eliminated, and hence desire1can never be satisfied. But it could not be argued, as Herman suggests, thatdesire2 cannot be eliminated because desire1 cannot be eliminated. Thatwould simply beg the question. Hence, we are led back to the centralquestion of this article: Why would it be paradoxical or otherwise logicallyabsurd to suppose that human desire can be completely eliminated?7Is this any more satisfactory than Herman’s account? Possibly, but the problemhere is that the desires here seem to be distinguished only by the nature oftheir object. If so, is not desire1 – once initiated – then also a component ofdesire2? There is still lacking a clear understanding of what desire is. Alt partlyconcedes this, and closes with the words:Perhaps in the future someone will attempt to clarify the concept of‘desire’. This would be an interesting philosophical project and anobvious contribution to Buddhist studies.8I am not at all sure whether I have fulfilled his remit here, but it is clear thathis view is based on a very simplistic understanding of the nature of desire. Ina brief response to Wayne Alt, John Visvader – while in general agreementwith Alt’s claim that desire can lead to the end of desire – wishes to maintainINTRODUCTION3"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the existence of a paradox:It is naïve to think that my final desire to give up desires will just disappearwhen I have gotten rid of the other desires, for from the Buddhist point ofview I have really not gotten anywhere by merely eliminating particulardesires if I still have the desiring mind, that is, the mind of ignorance whichhas been expressing itself the whole time in the desire to desire to give updesires.9Visvader here sees something underlying individual desires – the desiring mind.This could be taken as indicating some notion of a diffuse form of desire that liesbeneath its individual manifestations. This idea is one we shall see much more of.He sees paradox as less problematic though – seeing it, in line with his preferencefor a Zen-like approach – and possibly useful for helping to ‘pry the student out ofthe desiring mind’.10Herman wrote a reply to these responses, and in it movessome way to recognising some of the issues that form part of this study when heclaims: ‘The desire to end desire is of a different order of desiring, and it leads tono cessation of desire as the Buddhists themselves have been at some pains topoint out.’11The first part of this comment is useful and interesting – though it isnot as clear what he means by the second portion, and he does not elaborate. In theend, this series of articles and responses ends with Herman when he states: ‘I agreewith Alt when he suggests that the attempt to clarify the concept of desire (anddesirelessness) would make an interesting philosophical project.’12I mention thisnot as a rationale for this volume, but rather as it seems like an admission of defeat.It seems to have become clear to the participants in this debate that a much moredetailed examination of the Buddhist understanding of desire is needed.In this project I do not base the study on this notion of paradox. To do so wouldbe to begin with a preconception: that such a thing exists. To have based it arounddeciding whether or not there was such a paradox also seems limiting; for I wishhere to examine desire itself, not a self-referential form of it alone. The idea ofa paradox was an important spur to my examinations, but does not dominate thethrust of my investigations.But what is ‘desire’?Now we come to the consideration of definitions. I do not here, however, offer adefinition of desire in a Buddhist context. In the English language the word‘desire’ is one with a broad range of senses, if not meanings. Mrs Rhys Davidsnotes, when looking at Buddhism in translation:a comparison of the translations made by such scholars as Burnouf,Foucaux, Max Muller, Fausboll, Oldenberg, and Warren with theoriginals, discloses the striking fact that the one English word ‘desire’ ismade to do duty for no less than seventeen Pali words.13INTRODUCTION4"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"In Chapter 3, I offer definitions in a Buddhist context. Here I wish to addresssome general consideration of the nature of desire. I also speculate as to whydesire might be considered as problematic.One issue which crops up at a number of points is the relation of ‘will’ and‘desire’. This has particular relevance to some of the material in the first chapter,particularly where Nietzsche’s ‘Will-to-power’ and Schopenhauer’s idea of theWill are invoked. It would be all too easy to conflate the two, but a distinctiondoes need sustaining.‘Will’ can be seen as ‘intention’, the mental occurrence that leads us intoaction. Willed action is intentional, rather than accidental, action. Now, not alldesires lead to action, but this is not a major concern, as our will – as intention –is something we often also fail to fulfil. Intentions are often abandoned, or evenrestrained. So, in what does the difference between the two consist?I would claim, and seek to maintain this usage in what follows, that most actsof willing can be seen as the consequencesof desire. The desire, and the intend-ing or willing, are not the same, but the willing derives from a desire.14In thisway then, the will, usually, is an expression of desiring. For example, we mayhave a fairly constant desire that is only intermittently expressed in acts of will-ing. Often writers seem to use ‘Will’ to include both the intention and the desire,but a difference between the two is not only important in general terms. In thespecific context of Buddhist thought, ‘will’ – as cetana– has specific functionsand consequences distinct from forms of desiring.Even acts of negation can be seen as formed from desires – desires to avoid orbe rid of. But are there acts of will that do not derive from desires? As yet, I haveleft this possibility open, but what might they be like? We might view instinctiveresponses as acts of will, but not based on desire. I pull my foot away quickly froma spike I have trodden on – but does this work? I could be easily seen as havingacted on a desire to avoid pain – and beyond this, might we even claim here thatthe act is so quick and unconsidered that I barely willed it at all? This complicatesthe relationship of desire and willing.Might we have to re-position our view such that acts of ‘Will’ derive from desires,but that desires can, on occasion, lead to action without the intermediary of the will?This seems possibly to be the case, such as in the example of the spike above. Thisseems reasonable, but such desires as these seem qualitatively distinct from the morecomplex and cerebral considerations and wants that many of our desires seem to be.This attempted untangling of desire and willing is incomplete – and stands here onlyto try and offer a little initial clarification of these terms.Moving to consider the nature of desire itself, while in the first chapter a signi-ficant quantity of the material is drawn from the approach of Continental Europeanphilosophy, for this initial issue of definitions, I turn to a proponent of a moreAnalytic style. In his book on desire, G. F. Schueler offers two senses of desire:The distinction is that between two senses of the term ‘desire’: On oneside is what might be called the philosophers’ sense, in which, as INTRODUCTION5"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"G. E. M. Anscombe15says, ‘the primitive sign of wanting is trying toget’, that is, the sense in which desires are so to speak automatically tiedto actions because the term ‘desire’ is understood so broadly as to applyto whatever moves someone to act.16Before we move to the second sense, it is worth noting that while this is broad insome ways, it is narrow in others. It seems almost behaviourist – denying an innerlife other than as an analogy for the physical. Schueler continues to outline thesecond sense:On the other side is the more ordinary sense, in which one can dothings one has no desire to do, that is, the sense in which one canreflect on one’s desires, try to figure out what one wants, compareone’s own desires with the desires of others or the requirements ofmorals, the law, etiquette or prudence, and in the end perhaps evendecide that some desires one has, even very strong ones, shouldn’t beacted on at all.17This is an important distinction. It would seem outright folly to adopt the firstapproach exclusively in this analysis. Buddhism seems to explicitly tell us thatthere are desires we should not act on,18and it does nothing if not encourage usto reflect upon our desires. The second sense however is insufficient to act asa definition. Rather it describes some of the ways we relate to desires.One aspect, which needs addressing by any initial discussion of desire, isthat of the physical or bodily basis of much desire. While we may have sophisti-cated mental desires,19much of our desiring has fairly obvious physical roots.Here another distinction is also required. On one hand we have basic physicalneeds – I am hungry and must eat; on the other, we have physically based desiresthat are less basic – I want cream cakes. The first category are described bySchueler:One important set of cases of desire, often thought of as paradigm casesI suspect, are hunger, thirst, and the desire to eliminate bodily wastes.(We might want to add sexual desire to this list as well.) Such desires areubiquitous and have a very distinctive and characteristic set of features.Each is connected to a corresponding biological need or drive. Each hasa distinctive kind of ‘object’, such as food or water. Each, at least in itsmore intense manifestations, has a distinctive and (normally) unmistakablephenomenological character.20This seems fairly reasonable, and we can clearly see what he refers to here. He goesbeyond this to discuss other desires which may seem to mimic the structure of thoseof physical need, but are not as basic or fundamental. These he refers to (although,for reasons that will become obvious, I do not adopt this usage) as ‘cravings’.INTRODUCTION6"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Genuine cravings, such as the craving for chocolate or for tobacco,though they often seem to have a biological basis and may have a distinctphenomenological character, don’t seem connected to needs in the sameway, say, hunger and thirst are.21He discusses these cravings, following them along a spectrum till they are farfrom the need to eat to live. He refers to when:People sometimes speak of having a craving to see a Cary Grant movieor to go horseback riding.22Here we have moved a long way from even, it would seem, the pseudo-biologicalcraving for chocolate. Schueler then moves to desires that he does not see as‘cravings’ at all (at least in the way he uses the term):My desire to visit my sister is a genuine desire, which I might have or lack,but it is not a craving, I would say, even in the way that a craving to seea Cary Grant movie is, let alone in the way a craving for sweets is.23So, it would seem that not all desire can be construed as derived from, or mim-icking, our most basic need-type desires. These groups of desire – the biological,cravings, and non-craving desires, form by no means a comprehensive list.Schueler also discusses hopes and wishes,24and even the peculiar example(drawn from Nagel) that if we did something (without being physically forced todo so in the most basic sense) then we desired to do so.25A single definition is hard to come by, given the range here covered. Indeed,when I spent some time seeking to frame such a definition for this introductionI seemed to find myself spiralling into an endless task. From concern over this,and a sense that further discussions of desire are likely to be eclipsed by thediscussions that follow, I say little more here. I treat desire as ‘an active mentalattitude towards an object, with the possibility of willing occurring as a resultthereof ’. While this may be a little ‘safe’ as a definition, it captures, I feel, mostof what is generally included in the notion of desire.Desire as problematicDesire can be seen as potentially problematic for a number of reasons. First, itmay lead us into conflict with other people – in a finite world with infinitedesires, this seems inevitable. Second, particularly in a Buddhist context, desiremay be seen as an enemy of calm and inner-peace.26I will refer, at various stages,to the idea of desire as ‘the upsetter’ for this very reason.A third reason for desire’s being of an at least ambivalent ethical nature is itsrelation to the world. In Buddhist thought, desire’s problematic nature is a resultnot only of the ignorant (avijja) way that we want, but also of the nature of theINTRODUCTION7"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"world – and our ignorance of this. It is because all conditioned things are of anature to pass away, because of the impermanent (anicca) nature of reality,27thatour desires are doomed to disappointment. Even if we do manage to get what wewant – it will not last for ever, and neither will we.28It is the impermanence, ortransiency, of the world that condemns desiring to futility.Awareness of this as, we shall see in Chapter 1, is found in Western as well asEastern thought. Indeed, Jonathan Dollimore refers to this impermanence as‘mutability’.29He considers it to be the factor that leads to the oft-remarked uponlinks in literature and art between desire (often sexual) and death. The Chapter 1,as well as those beyond it, returns explicitly to these issues.Scope of this studyThe topics covered here are both narrow and wide. In my consideration ofBuddhism I retain a relatively narrow focus – on the material of the Pali Canon,and here more on the suttasthan any other aspect, with the abhidhammabeingused to provide further reflection and insight.30Beyond Buddhism I cast a widernet, but why go beyond the borders of the Buddhist approaches which form thecentral plank of this study? I am interested in desire – and Buddhism, as found inthe Pali Canon, has proved to contain the most engaging discourse on this.Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, whenever I refer to ‘Buddhism’, it is theearly form of Buddhism as represented by the contents of the Pali Canon thatI refer to. While I make some use of commentators such as Buddhaghosa, andpost- and para-Canonical materials from the Theravada tradition, I focus primarilyon the Canonical texts themselves. I have given myself much freer reign regardingthe non-Buddhist material, and explain why this is below.Approach and method 1: chapter outlinesChapter 1 – desire in western thoughtIn the first chapter, I offer an overview of how desire has been understood withinWestern thought, mainly but not exclusively by philosophers. Clearly there is avast range of materials that I could potentially refer to and discuss in this context,but after wide reading around the topic, I have selected writers and thinkers whohave something of interest to say regarding the nature of desire itself, or whoseconcepts of desire have particular relevance in the context of Buddhist thought.When initially planning the first chapter, I considered trying to extract two ormore specific conceptual models from the range of material therein, to form thebasis of a comparison with Buddhist and Hindu ideas. For a number of reasons,I ultimately chose not to follow this approach. Such an approach seemed false, andthe views of many thinkers involved seemed too complex and individual. Manypositions on desire were predicated on particular metaphysical presumptionsINTRODUCTION8"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"(or rejections thereof ), and to abstract them from this seemed to be to oversimplifyand misrepresent them. So rather than the construction of the conceptual modelsof desire, what I have sought to do is locate a number of central themes and issuesthat recur throughout Western thought. I will say no more here on the nature ofthe themes, but will conclude this section with a few words about the type ofWestern philosophy discussed in the first chapter.The most oft-used distinction in modern mainstream Western philosophy isbetween ‘Continental’ and ‘Analytic’ types of philosophy. This distinction relatesnot only to the object of study – the content – but is in many ways a divide of styleand attitude. To draw a rather caricatured version of both, let me offer a quick setof key features.Analytic philosophy is often seen as being predominantly Anglo-American andas apolitical, seeking transparent, factual language, concerned with epistemologyand logic, and impersonal in both tone and intent. Continental (as in ContinentalEurope) thought is often viewed as being more political and personal, is stylisti-cally more interested in literature and its methods, seeks reflexivity to the author,and concerns itself more with ontology. Thus Continental thought is more inter-ested in addressing life as an existential phenomenon.31While such a brief andover-simplified picture might make even hardened philosophers wince, it reflectsthe way the two are often portrayed.32We might expect then, given its more existential nature, to find desire as a moredominant theme in Continental thought than Analytic. To an extent this is thecase, but far from exclusively. We have already seen a relatively analytic approachfrom G. Schueler, and will see more in Chapter 1. Further to this, the distinctionbetween the two is not as hard as the impression of my, admittedly rather conciseand generalising, summary above might indicate. In examining Western thought,I do not make a lot of this distinction, but it needs to be mentioned, for it doescrop up intermittently.Chapter 2 – non-Buddhist Indian thought on desireThe second chapter relates to non-Buddhist Indian religious views. I concernmyself primarily with early Hinduism, but also pay some attention to the thought ofJainism. A certain proportion of this material might be seen as scene setting for thechapters on Buddhism, but not all of it fits this description, and my intent is broader.Nonetheless, this background is important. If we are to take on boardthe Buddhist teachings regarding paticca-samuppada– conditioned arising – weneed to see what the conditions for the arising of Buddhist attitudes to desirewere. Richard Gombrich argues strongly for such an approach:To see the genesis of the Buddha’s teaching as conditioned by thereligious milieu in which it arose is to adopt a truly Buddhist standpointwhich I also believe to be good historiography.33INTRODUCTION9"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"I hope to give some sense of these factors, but while the Buddhist material isdrawn from a narrow band of the spectrum of Buddhism available, the Hindumaterial particularly casts its net further.In looking at Hinduism, I begin with the Vedas, and continue as far as the KamaSutra. Why do I allow myself to range so far? Part of the reason for this is that Ido not here go into the level of detail on Hindu thought that I do with the Buddhistmaterial. Another component of the rationale for this, and the primary one, is thatI wish to use the non-Buddhist portions to illuminate the ideas I discuss withreference to Buddhism. I take a particular phase of Buddhist thought, and use ideasfrom beyond it to help clarify, and initiate reflection upon, topics discussed therein;doing so has allowed me to look far and wide for material on desire.In response to this, one might ask, ‘Why not further yet?’ Indeed, there is noaccount here of the Islamic understanding of desire, or the Judaic, and onlypassing interactions with Christian thought. There are numerous traditions I haveneglected, and there are numerous reasons for this. First, there is not enoughspace to address all of these in one book (though as a future project it is appeal-ing). Second, I admit a pragmatic interest here. I am a Western philosophy andreligious studies graduate, with a postgraduate background in Hinduism, and assuch have certain personal interests and areas of knowledge. In framing this proj-ect, such factors have played an inevitable part. However, I hope that I am beingnot purely partial in this sense. In my reading, Hinduism, and to a certain extentJainism, clearly had much to say that impacted on, related to, drew on, and wasresponded to by, Buddhist thought. In Western thought I found what seemed likestartling echoes of Buddhism, which are discussed in Chapter 5.Overall, the second chapter looks to the Indian context of Buddhist thought,both before Buddhism’s advent, and also with relation to the paths of desireIndian religions trod once Buddhism was on the scene.Chapter 3 – Buddhism and desire: the varieties of desireIn this chapter I come to look at the Buddhist view on desire. The primaryapproach taken in this chapter is to try and see the terms used in Pali that couldbe construed as coming under my definition of ‘desire’. This process gives rathera lot of terms, with a variety of meanings and senses, and of varying significancedoctrinally. In seeking to view these terms in context, I become drawn intodebates surrounding the doctrines and ideas the terms relate to. We see many ofthese issues as inter-related and overlapping. With reference to the way Buddhismviews mental processes, Rune Johansson’s words are particularly apt here:According to Buddhist psychology, all psychological processes aredynamic, i.e. intentional and creative. The terminology referring to needsis particularly rich.34It is this rich range of terminology that Chapter 3 seeks to investigate.INTRODUCTION10"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"When initially planning my approach to this study, I had hoped that bysystematically examining a range of Pali terms for desire, I would be able to producea coherent and consistent Buddhist typology of desire. Such an ambition, I soondiscovered, would have required much more time and space, but as I argue inChapter 3, is still likely to have been impossible. Such a clear typology is not,in my opinion, present in the Pali Canon.Nonetheless, I have stuck with an approach of using Chapter 3 to primarilyengage with the varieties of desire in Buddhism. This has enabled me to look atthe ways that understandings of desiring are conceptualised and what responsesand prescriptions are offered in the face of them.Chapter 4 – Buddhism and desire: the dynamics of desireIn the fourth chapter I build on the work of Chapter 3, and seek to place theBuddhist understanding of desire in context. The most obvious context is that ofpaticca-samuppada– conditioned arising – the way in which desires are seen ascoming to be, and indeed passing away, from being.In seeking to place desire in context, I also examine the location of desire. Thistakes us beyond the question of ‘who desires’,35to look a little at the whereandhowof desire through interrogating the Buddhist notion of mind–body and theirrelations.36Another key issue, which has been mentioned a little already here, is the rela-tion of desire to ignorance and insight. Not only do I examine this topic in thefourth chapter, I also look at the status of ‘views’ themselves. I do so for two rea-sons. First, because knowledge is clearly seen in some Hindu and some Buddhistmaterial as being of potential spiritual value. Second, because we are warnedagainst attachment to views in interesting ways in Buddhism. Just as desires forgood objects can still be potentially problematic if the desire is held in a certainmanner, so a ‘right-view’ can be harmful if clung to, and indeed, treated as anobject of desire. This investigation into ‘views’ not only mirrors the discourse ondesire, but also seeks to deepen that discourse and extend it.Chapter 5 – Conclusion: desire and the transformation of livingIn the concluding chapter I draw together material from all the preceding chap-ters. As well as summarising my chapter conclusions, I offer a number of thematicreflections on desire. I consider the relationship of desire to ideas of freedom –particularly spiritual freedom as liberation.Following up material in Chapters 1 and 4 particularly, I look at the interplayof desire and reason, and the manner in which such a discourse has been charac-terised. Another key theme is the relation of desire to absence or lack. I here gobeyond notions of desire as the lack of an object, but look to the ways in whichdesire can be seen to arise from an ‘inner lack’, both with reference to anattaandWestern philosophy.INTRODUCTION11"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"I also consider the connections between desire and morality – the way desire isoften cast as being in some way morally suspicious. After this I look at the connectionof desire and death, following the ideas mentioned earlier in this Introduction.I next examine the way in which concerns over desire are related to the extent andnature of love and passion in life. Here I address the question, ‘Does the Buddhistgoal of desirelessness drain all passion from life?’ After this I look at the criticalimportance of notions of change and transience to the understanding of desire.Before coming to my final conclusions, I have two sections that consider thepersonal and cosmic, respectively, senses of desire as a creative force. This may atthis stage, given what has been said of desire, seem an odd topic. However,numerous sources and writers on desire conceive of it as a force with great creativepower. I wish to answer the question, ‘Is desire really the maker of the world?’Approach and method 2: key conceptsLanguage and expressionMuch of the time the concepts described in Buddhist texts are ones that mayslip away from the grasp of language, away from its tendency to solidify that whichis in flux, to stall the dynamic. This applies most obviously to nibbana, but goesbeyond this. It is hard to describe dukkhain less than a lengthy paragraph and evenhere we are aware that we have not done it justice. Buddhism, by the nature of itsconcerns, deals in a currency of experience. In spite of some of the grander claimsof structuralist linguists, much of our mental life seems to remain stubbornlyresistant to clear expression in language. It is with this caution from Goetheringing in my ears that I tentatively approach central Buddhist ideas:You needn’t confuse me by contradicting! One cannot begin to speakwithout beginning to err.37Given this, we must nonetheless go on. I draw attention to these problems only asa disclaimer, by way of seeking to explain the apparent manner in which I may,particularly in Chapter 5, appear to play a little ‘fast and loose’ when comparingBuddhist ideas to those in Western thought. While there often remains linguisticresistance to some of the comparisons, there being variance in the means ofexpressing them, I do so on the basis that they conjure up related, if at times difficultto express, psycho-spiritual connections. While I use the term a long way from itshome, there seems, in this process, to be an element of ‘analogical reasoning’ (whatIslamic ethics refers to, albeit in a radically different context, asqiyas38).Kusala–AkusalaThe notion of classifying phenomena (dhammas39) as either kusala, akusala, orneutral is perhaps the key way in which we find actions or mental occurrencesINTRODUCTION12"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"judged in Buddhism. But in what way are they being judged? Bhikkhu ThichNhat-Tu claims that kusalaandakusalaare: ‘the primary terms to evaluate humanbehaviour and morality.’40As we might imagine in the light of this, the judgementis one applied to actions, and the mental states that initiate action – butalso includes non-act-initiating mental states. We can see how such a judgingmechanism might be presumed to be essentially a moral one.However, despite this feeling that it may be a moral term, there has been acertain shying away from the translation of kusala/akusalain explicitly moralterms, such as good/bad. Why is this the case? First, kusalaseems to havea broader meaning than just ‘good’, as the PED indicates, where it is defined as:‘clever, skilful, expert; good, right, meritorious’.41However, the PED goes on tosay that it is ‘Esp. appl. In moral sense (\u0001puñña)’.42So while kusala(and itsoppositeakusala) are terms with a moral component, they seem to go beyondthis: they indicate some notion of competence. Indeed, we often find them usedin such a manner. Lance Cousins points this out:In many of the passages in which it occurs it is simply a case ofmentioning proficiency in some art of craft.43Cousins lists around thirty Canonical occurrences of kusalain this context. Furtherto this he also notes cases where an analogy is drawn between some mundane skilland a spiritual competence. The most common translation, then, of kusalais as‘skilful’,44and this is often seen to encompass both the meanings, of competencein some task,45and its more moral sense. The latter usage gives a very specifictone to the way ‘good’ actions are viewed. Using such a translation seems tode-substantialise notions of good and evil, and seems to portray moral and spiritu-ally benign behaviour (mental and physical) in terms of a competence – a skill;they are, then, something not to be simply followed, but learnt and mastered.Not everyone is happy with this translation of kusalaas ‘skilful’. One of themost sustained arguments against such a usage is found in the work of DamienKeown. I shall look briefly here at his case for adopting a different translation(and therefore a slightly altered interpretation). His basic definition is a function-alist one, that is to say that kusalais to be understood by the role it plays. Thisrole is that of moving one in the direction of enlightenment:Kusaladenotes those things which are to be pursued if enlightenment isto be attained. Its contrary, akusala, characterises whatever is negative inthis respect and is accordingly to be shunned.46This is not a particularly controversial definition and Keown is able to quoteCanonical sources which are unambiguous in supporting such a position. Afterestablishing which side of the moral fence, as it were, kusalalies on, and its asso-ciation with nibbanaand arahatship, Keown moves on to discuss the translation ofkusala. In looking at possible translations, what he is partly doing is trying to fixINTRODUCTION13"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"the meaning of the term, to find out what it ‘really means’. It is here that Keowndisagrees with the common translation of kusalaas ‘skilful’ and also makes claimsregarding what he feels to be the implications – problematic ones in his view – ofthe term ‘skilful’. He begins by claiming that the translation of kusalaas ‘skilful’ties in with a specific interpretation of the nature of Buddhist ethics:It is very common for kusalato be rendered as ‘skilful’, but it should berecognised that this translation carries with it a specific implication forthe nature of Buddhist ethics, namely that it is utilitarian. Even then, it isa poor translation on aesthetic grounds, and we may note that utilitarianphilosophers retain the traditional moral terminology of ‘good’, ‘bad’,‘right’, and ‘wrong’.47I think this is an interesting stance, but it raises a number of potential problems.Does ‘skilful’ imply utilitarianism? And even if it does, is that unrepresentative ofBuddhism? I will briefly address the second point first.Keown argues at some length, in The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, against a utilitarian interpretation of Buddhist ethical thought, and I do not intend toeither fully engage with his position or object to it very strongly here. To do so wouldbe going a little further than my self-imposed remit. However, I do wish to drawattention to one of his key objections:An action is judged to be kusalato the extent that it is harmonious withnirvanic values, and not to the extent that its consequencesdisplay orpromote certain qualities. In Buddhism there is no ex post factoconferralof rightness upon actions as there is in utilitarianism. An action is right orwrong from the moment of its inception48– its nature is fixed by referenceto nirvanic values and it cannot subsequently change its status. Wrong(akusala) acts cannot turn out ‘in the event’ to have been right by virtue oftheir proximate or remote effects; nor can right (kusala) acts turn outto have been wrong in view of their consequences. For a utilitarian theoryof ethics, however, both of these are real possibilities since rightness andgoodness are separately defined.49This is flawed, not because it misrepresents Buddhism – which I do not think itdoes – but because it simplifies utilitarianism. Are there not forms of utilitarianthought which are concerned with the intendedconsequence? If there are, a ‘good’act remains good, even if its aims are thwarted. Here the locus of morality is stillintent, but intent with reference to desired consequences. Not only does this seemnot too far from a utilitarian position, it is also – in my view – reasonably close toa Buddhist position. Does not Buddhism promote values whose expression seeksspecific consequences? It would seem so in at least three ways. First, and mostobviously perhaps, there is the matter of karmic consequences. Second, there is theconsequence of moving one forward towards liberation, and third the most importantINTRODUCTION14"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"desirable consequence of action is surely the reduction of dukkha(although this islikely to be, in varying ways, related to the previous two).However, I do not wish to pursue this further here, as I am also unsure that thetranslation of kusalaas ‘skilful’ necessarily implies a utilitarian ethic anyway.‘Skill’ does not have to be seen as mechanistic in the way that utilitarian ethicsare often portrayed.To take up a remaining issue, I do not have an aesthetic problem with ‘skilful’;indeed I rather like it. From it I take a sense of ethical behaviour (and especiallythe learning of this behaviour) as a craft. In seeing Buddhists as being some kindof ethical apprentice, I feel we get a good feel of the notion of moral training towhich Buddhism seeks to subject us.Furthermore, and this is a personal view (but we are talking aesthetics here),I have always found the term ‘skilful’ to be deeply evocative. For me it hasconjured images of one who is skilled at living. Rather than implying utilitarian-ism’s hedonic calculus it seems more akin to Aristotelian notions of the roundedindividual and ideas of eudaimonia. I have long felt ‘skilful’ to be useful as a meansof making morality analogous to craftsmanship in a sense that flatters moralityrather than reducing it. In this way morality becomes the craft of living well, ofliving in accordance with a well-measured insight into the nature of things.We can perhaps see how some might view the notion of ‘skill’ as removing somequalitative feature from morality. But this is the case only if one wishes to posit amoral or meta-ethical view which relies on morality being sanctioned by somethingexternal to the world. This is in accordance with the technical paradigm implied by‘skilfulness’. This does not mean we have to see ethical behaviour as ‘calculating’(a term which often seems to be derisory when applied to human motives and behav-iour). Rather we can conceive of Buddhist ethics as the development of a way ofthinking, and acting, free from the shackles of the Self-delusion, leaving us to respondout of an insightful compassion. This is an ethic of fluidity, a broadened moral horizonwhich opens a vista beyond the narrow confines of both utilitarianism’s hedonism anddeontology’s unsustainable metaphysical dualism. In this sense Buddhist ethics dogo‘beyond good and evil’, not in that they transcend morality, but in that they propose amoral outlook which can make sense only in a holistic context of the Dhamma.Morality is then not partitioned off from psychology or from analytic philosophicalanalysis; it really is part of the path. It is on this basis that I retain the translation of‘skilful’ forkusala.50Another possible option might have been to translate kusalaas‘wise’, and while this seems fairly reasonable, it does not, for me, have quite theethical register, and seems not to capture much that ‘skilful’ does.One final point needs addressing with regard to the notions of kusalaandakusala. We must be clear that they represent, to a significant extent, a distinctionof degree, rather than purely of type.51Actions can be relatively kusala, and lessor more akusala. Throwing my pen across the room out of frustration may bea form of anger; it is akusala(it will damage my inner calm, make me unhappy,etc.); but it is not as akusalaas kicking the cat (harming a living being, as well asgiving in to anger).INTRODUCTION15"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The discussion of kusalaandakusalais important, for when we come to look atthe types of desire found in Buddhism, it is primarily a kusala–akusalaassessmentof them that I wish to make, alongside seeing if the Canon makes such an assessment.Approach and method 3: sources and textual issuesMy key sources here are, at least for Chapters 3 and 4, the Pali Canon, aspreserved by the Theravada tradition. I am greatly indebted, with regard to thesetexts, to the producers of the Chattha Sakgayana CD-ROM (CSCD52). The CSCDrepresent the Burmese (or Myanmar) version of the Pali Canon, but I have soughtto indicate where there are differences from the version used by the PTS.53However, my primary purpose here has not been to offer new translations oftexts. My skills in Pali are limited, and I am not seeking to engage in a form oftechnical linguistics. In deciding whether to cite an existing translation, or to offerone of my own, a number of factors have been involved.If a short piece of Pali has been straightforward I have usually offered my owntranslation, and I have tried to offer my own rendering of passages of particularimportance to the arguments I am presenting. I have relied on the translationsof others where I have deemed that I could not improve on their version, andwhere there seems no other sensible reason for devoting the time and sweatrequired – only to replicate what another has already done.I feel this represents a balanced approach, both in terms of providing the readerwith appropriate details, and use of my time. In all cases, even when using thetranslations of others, I have sought to provide the Pali, so that the reader withappropriate skills may judge the translations for themselves.54In terms of other sources, I offer here only the briefest of literature reviews. Myreading began with the Philosophy East & Westpieces discussed earlier, andfor the Buddhist material I scoured a range of books. Few address the topic ofdesire exclusively, but I am indebted to Bruce Matthews’Craving and Salvationand Robert Morrison’sThree55Cheers for Tanjhain challenging my views andproviding numerous useful references. With regard to the material in Chapter 1, theplace I began was with the special edition of the journal Continental Philosophy(vol. VII), which was dedicated to the topic of ‘Philosophy and Desire’, andJonathan Dollimore’s fascinating Death, Desire & Loss in Western Culture. Theseboth broadened my horizons and again gave me much to follow up.For the Hindu material, I was fortunate enough to have access to a number ofpieces by Dermot Killingley, who has written extensively on desire in Hinduthought. These, along with Dermot’s advice, allowed me a significant foothold indealing with this material.Conclusion: aspirationsWhile this section is not really a conclusion – I have at this stage yet to reach any – I do want to take this opportunity to set out my aspirations for this work,which I will then return to in the final conclusion.INTRODUCTION16"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"I seek, by the end of this book, to have surveyed the range of views on desirefound in Western philosophy and in non-Buddhist Indian religious thought.Further to this, I aspire to offer a critical interpretation of the understanding ofdesire, in its variety, within the form of Buddhism represented by the Pali Canon.By drawing together this material, I wish to articulate my own understanding ofdesire, and the manner in which the Buddhist position I outline can be seen to notonly offer an understanding of desire as a phenomenon, but also offer a responseto desire.

It may seem a foolhardyexpedition, given the looming bulk of the Western philosophical canon; indeed, itprobably contains enough tomes of metaphysical and analytic speculation to buildan actual mountain. Nonetheless, others might suggest that the quantity withinthis great body of thought given over to the explicit consideration of desire wouldamount to only a modest molehill.Some have gone as far as to suggest that the whole approach of this philosophicalcanon is opposed to engaging with desire, seeing it as the antithesis of thephilosophicaltelos:No doubt the bulk of the Western tradition has sustained skepticismtoward the philosophical possibilities of desire, and desire has been figuredtime and again as philosophy’s Other. As immediate, arbitrary, purpose-less, and animal, desire is that which requires to be gotten beyond; itthreatens to undermine the postures of indifference and dispassionwhich have in various modalities conditioned philosophical thinking.21DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"This does not mean that Western philosophy leaves the subject unexamined, but isin line with the manner in which we find it treated. As I discovered when I beganresearching this chapter, much of what has been written consists of asides, digres-sions and adjuncts to the matter ostensibly under scrutiny. This is not universal, andcombining the direct engagements and the sideways glances provides a significantquantity of material. In reviewing this material, I have two primary purposes.First, I aim to clarify the notion of desire. Is it an impulse, an emotion, a sub-class of willing? Is it a sublimation or expression of our genes’ reproductiveimperative? These issues pervade this chapter. In a way, the word ‘desire’ is a curse toWestern thinkers – it means too much and too little. On one level it is a simplemental attraction to an object, while on a broader view it could be applied toall mental states – for all mental states might be said to take an object, and anattractor–repellent relationship to that object.Within this chapter, this diversity of interpretation of the very nature of desireis revealed. Furthermore, I show here the work that ‘desire’ – as a concept3– ismade to do. For the Stoics it is part of a futile striving that needs to be reined in,in the work of Deleuze it forms part of a critique of capitalism, in Nietzsche it is,in part, an element of breaking free from ‘herd’ morality, and more.As we shall see, analyses in Buddhism also have very specific ends to which thetheories of desire are orientated.4Indeed, if we wanted to examine the motives ofthose writing on desire, we would find as much diversity as we do in definitionsof desire.The second aim of this chapter is to find ways of theorising desire. Ways oflocating desire within conceptual schemes are one thing – but we do need to bealert to the dangers pointed out by Nietzsche of our ‘Will-to-system’.5My goal ismore to demonstrate the existence of these discourses of desire. What I will showis that in the West there are numerous ways in which desire is conceptualised. Wemight go so far as to argue that there exist competing models of desire, and weshall see that some more contemporary writers look back with scorn and suspicionon some of the ways ‘desire’ has been viewed in the past.One aspect of Western thought I do not seek to engage with in detail is whatPatrick Fuery calls ‘a radical politicisation of desire’,6in the work of writers suchas Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. These writers engage with the ways in whichdesire can be said to be ‘socially constructed’, and the manner in which sexualdesire is related to issues of gender and sexuality. I have to set aside these dis-courses, partly for reasons of space, and partly because my focus here is alreadyfairly wide, and would be in danger of becoming overly diffuse were I to permitmyself to extend it any further.Another noteworthy feature of Western writing on desire is just how much of itseems to feel that a discussion of desire is the same thing as a discussion of sexualdesire. A number of texts consulted in the process of this research seemed to view‘desire’ as synonymous with sexual desire.7For this, perhaps we are to blameFreud.8He seems, at least in the popular imagination, to be partly responsible forthe view that all desire is sublimated sexual lust.DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT19"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"To attribute such a view to the writing of Freud is disingenuous, but he does seemto give the Id – in a move reflecting the Platonic tri-partite Soul – a significant andpowerful sexual component. As Leslie Stevenson notes:It is a vulgar misinterpretation of Freud to say that he traced allhumanbehaviour to sexual motivations. What istrue is that he gave sexuality amuch wider scope in human life than had been formerly recognized.9It is worth noting that Freud does not derive his theory exclusively from hisclinical observations of those in mental distress. Indeed, R. C. Solomon claims:It is not hard to appreciate the importance of Schopenhauer in Freud’smodel of the mind.10The libido is an only slightly personalized versionof Schopenhauer’s Will, juxtaposed against a rational system of ideas.11This even extends to the ideal response to this deep-seated drive. The primalthrust of the libido, like the Schopenhauerian Will, is something we struggle tocontrol – for fear of its potentially destructive effect on our lives. Solomon noteshow Freud sees us as in need of a type of liberation from this base appetite:he insists that we struggle against the libido and, through self-understanding,free ourselves from its power.12Of course a Freudian analyst may not see the life of a bhikkhuas the best way toachieve this,13and see their chastity as an attempt to achieve the repression of thelibido rather than liberation from it.In this project then, desire is not to be taken purely in a sexual context. Indeed,some thinkers might go as far as to suggest that all sexual lust is a sublimated formof a desire for power, or even a general desiring that has no inherent type of object,but that seeks expression through a variety of means. Such approaches may indeedbe seen as being a form of Schopenhauer’s assertion that the general Will – which allour smaller acts of willing are examples of – is a prime force with no specific goalitself.14This conception, though, is not universal; some see desire working the otherway round. This is to see desire as brought about not by some deep inner yearning –from within – but rather as arising from perception. William Blake writes:Man’s desires are limited by his perceptions; none can desire what he hasnot perceiv’d.The desires & perceptions of man, untaught by anything but organs ofsense, must be limited to objects of sense.15This view may however be seen as relating to whatwe want, rather than whywewant in the first place – and therefore there is no reason that the two viewsDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT20"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"(desire as force arising from within, and the objects of desire arising fromperception) need be seen as incompatible. We might argue that Freud, colouredby his clinical experience and personal preoccupations, lays a model overSchopenhauer.Clearly these different writers are trying to do different things, but they doseem to have one aspect of mutual concern – ethics. Be it therapeutic – as Freudis and Schopenhauer aspires to be – or philosophical, religious or political, themoralstatusof desire has significance for us all. So pervasive in our consciousnessis desire that even the driest of analytic philosophers cannot ultimately suppressthis import. When an analytic philosopher seeks to portray their discussion of desireas a neutral, objective account of the relation of belief and intent, or to identifybelief with either action or linguistic usage, they may succeed in eradicating allexplicit references to ‘soft’ topics such as ethics and human lived experience.However, the answers to these driest of questions dohave ethical implications.What and how we choose; how we have meta-desires, which do or do not over-ridefirst-order desires; how desire can become addiction; these are all issues whichthe conclusions of analytical investigation into desire will have consequences for,even if they are left unstated.A final note though before I discuss these various views of desire, for most doseem to rely on a specific model of reality – a metaphysical backdrop to theirnotion of desire. This seems to represent the final victory of Heraclitus, in thatnearly all writers on the topic concede the ever-changing nature of the world.Of course, we might question this assertion – what of the Platonic forms? By‘world’, I am here referring (in a Kantian sense) to the phenomenal world – theworld as the object of our lived experience. It is indeed Plato’s great integrationistproject with regard to pre-Socratics such as Heraclitus and Parmenides16thatresults in the idea of the forms. By having the forms take on the roles of perma-nence and stability, Plato is able to concede the world of experience to change andflux. The majority of the views presented in this chapter seem predicated on thisbelief in reality as flux, or at the very least subject to change, which will be teasedout as we examine them.It is also worth noting here that the historical development of ideas about desireis not that of a single juggernaut rolling forward. Towards the end of this chapter,much is said about new and intriguing ways of viewing desire, but not allsubscribe to them. We find a very different approach in the allegedly ahistoricaldiscourse of analytic philosophy. In response to the question ‘What are desires?’,in a tone of grand neutrality befitting an analytic philosopher, G. F. Schuelerseeks to offer a clear, unambiguous way of approaching desire. Before he beginshe rules out the application of ‘want’ as ‘desire’ to non-sentient entities:I will ignore uses of ‘want’ and ‘desire’ and their cognates where theseterms can apply, literally and nonmetaphorically, to things other thansentient beings, e.g., where ‘want’ just means ‘lack’ or perhaps ‘lack plusneed’ as when we say the house wants painting.17DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"However, in the realm of the sentient he seems happy to allow ‘lack’ to form a keycomponent of desiring.18This notion recurs in this chapter, and is revisited inChapter 5.‘Lack’, or absence, or deficiency is seen by many of those below as the definingcharacteristic of desire. No matter what the object, no matter which of thestaggering diversity of desires we are discussing, many thinkers seem to feel thatthis definition carries the weight of both logical necessity and truth by definition.But, as we shall see, a healthy counter-tradition exists.An ancient lackThe monastic man is an artist. The philosopherAppoints man’s place in music, say, today.But the priest desires. The philosopher desires.And not to have is the beginning of desire.To have what is not is its ancient cycle.19Some feel that the whole history of Western engagement with desire is a repeatedlylost battle with notions of rationality. These approaches also often contain the notionof desire as ‘lack’. This seems regularly linked to theories that either condemn desireoutright, or seek to make it subservient to reason – which regularly privilege reasonover desire. This can be seen as beginning with Plato, and it is unquestionably themost commonly encountered view:In the struggle between reason and desire, the philosophical tradition fromPlato to Kant has given the prize to reason. Reason ought to rule desire.20It is this dominant model of desire that leads to its vilification. So much so thatJonathan Dollimore is on safe ground when he characterises St Augustine’s influ-ential position on desire with the words: ‘human desire is a permanent source ofmisery.’21Indeed, Augustine goes further and recognises the way that seeking tosolve the problems presented by our desires is not just to satisfy them, as JohnArmstrong notes when summarising Augustine’s view:Desire then, is organic: it grows. The more you feed it, the more you giveit what it wants, the bigger and stronger it gets. And of course, thestronger our cravings, the less we feel satisfied.22Returning to Plato, we can see this idea that desire relates closely to ‘lack’. InPlato’s SymposiumSocrates is questioning Agathon about desire:And does he desire and love the thing that he desires and loves when heis in possession of it or when he is not.Probably when he is not.DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT22"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"If you reflect for a moment, you will see that it isn’t merely probablebut absolutely certain that one desires what one lacks, or rather that onedoes not desire what one does not lack. To me at any rate Agathon, itseems as certain as anything can be. What do you think?23Of course, this being a Socratic dialogue, Agathon is dialectically doomed toconcur, leading to Socrates’ conclusion:Such a man, then, and everyone else who feels desire, desires what is notin his present power or possession, and desire and love have for theirobject things or qualities which a man does not at present possess butwhich he lacks.24Here desire and love are based on absence, or perhaps on awareness of thisabsence, what we might call a ‘felt lack’. The Symposiumis renowned for theaccount25of how we came to desire from the splitting of us into the kind of beingswe are now. Originally, in this story, humans are four-legged and two-faced, butthey attack the gods and Zeus slices them in two. This leads to a specific way ofinterpreting the nature of love:Love is the yearning of each part to find its original, complete state. Theperfect lovers are those who were originally joined together.26This mythic backdrop inevitably influences the view of desire taken in thedialogue. As Dollimore notes:Origination in a division which is a kind of death, desire becomes anexperience of lack rooted in loss; caught up somewhere between pastloss and future lack, it will remain unrealizable and always come toconsciousness as the seemingly inescapable condition of restlessness,dislocation, lack – and anxiety.27The view of desire found in Plato is also found to an extent in the Stoics such asSeneca. Indeed, Seneca sounds a little Buddhist when he emphasises the importanceof becoming reconciled to the transient nature of the world:No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciledto the possibility of loss.28Here we begin to see the recognition of the way our wants are endlessly frustrated bythe nature of reality. Indeed there is no exaggeration in Dollimore’s comment onSeneca’s position:Our desires are cheated by the mutability which characterises ourexistence.29Returning to Plato, we can see desire being characterised as ‘lack’ potentially leadingto an ethical suspicion of desire – the belief that it is possibly harmful and in need ofDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT23"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"suppressing, eliminating or at least severe regulation. With Plato we have the clearview that the ‘appetites’ must be subjected to the rule of the ‘higher’ elements of theSoul. In Book IV of The Republica consensus is reached regarding the make-up ofindividuals.30A person is made up of reason, ‘spirit’31and the appetites. These areseen as analogous to elements of the political state that form the ostensible telosof thebook. Like the state, the way for the individual to best be, is in harmony. This harmonyhowever is reliant on one element having dominance over the others:So, the reason ought to rule, having the foresight and wisdom to act forthe whole.32To be self-controlled is seen as a sign of wisdom and internal harmony:And we call him wise in virtue of that small part of him which is incontrol and issues the orders, knowing as it does what is best for each ofthe three elements and for the whole made up of them.Yes, I agree.Then don’t we call him self-disciplined when all these threeelements are in friendly and harmonious agreement, when reason andits subordinates are all agreed that reason should rule and there is nocivil war among them.33I think we need no clearer statement than this to demonstrate where Plato stands.Due to the nature of desire, it needs to be subordinate to reason. Plato howeverdoes not go so far as recommending the total avoidance of desire. This indicatesthat desire is not inherently wicked, but is dangerous and if uncontrolled is poten-tially ruinous. Without desire being held in check, chaos may ensue, so the firmhand of reason must rule the person, just as the philosopher-king must rule thestate. As we shall see later, self-control is valued highly in Buddhism, but wemight not wish to see reason as that which should ideally wield the control.After Plato, we find desire cropping up in the work of Aristotle. It is perhaps worth recognising that Aristotle is also no outright condemner of desire.It seems, in The Nicomachean Ethics, to be a case of making sure one has the‘right’ desire. Desire, as process, is described in terms of attraction or repulsion,which gives it something of a psychological tone:What affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoidance arein desire.34He continues in this passage to offer a view of how desire fits in with virtue andcharacter – key Aristotelian values:so that since moral virtue is a state of character concerned with choice,choice is deliberate desire, therefore both the reasoning must be true andthe desire right, if the choice is to be good, and the latter must pursue justwhat the former asserts.35DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT24"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"While desire is here still to be pointed in a direction decided by reason, we seethe necessity of them working in tandem demonstrated by Aristotle. In Aristotle’sview, desire – or the appetites – are to be less enslaved to reason than in Plato’sapproach. Aristotle sees desire less as something to be subdued. Indeed, Aristotleis renowned for providing a much richer and deeper engagement with the actual-ity of human character than the idealising of Plato. More evocative than Aristotle,although quite possibly also more pessimistic, is the view we find in Ecclesiastes.A striving after wind: Ecclesiastes and Judaeo-Christian thoughtWhile I am not going to attempt to draw a lot of Western religious thought intothe gravitational pull of this work, there is one Biblical text that it seems a writeron Western thought regarding desire (and in particular the futility of desire)cannot (or at least should not) ignore: that is the book of Ecclesiastes.Ecclesiastes opens with a famous and evocative claim regarding the futility ofour existence.36The misguided nature of our hopes and dreams hints at theimpossibility of ever fulfilling our desires:The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?37Later in Ecclesiastes Chapter One, life is shown as a futile seeking, a runningafter what cannot be caught:it is an unhappy business that God has given to the sons of men to bebusy with. I have seen everything that is done under the sun; and behold,all is vanity and a striving after wind.What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannotbe numbered.38The phrase ‘all is vanity and a striving after wind’ is a theme throughoutEcclesiastes. This view of humanity and the universe we inhabit may seem atodds with other characterisations of the Judaeo-Christian world view. But, asDollimore comments:From its own time onwards Ecclesiastes has been regarded as one of themost heretical books in the Bible.39The comparison of Ecclesiastes to Stoics such as Seneca is hard to ignore. Thebook makes clear that our chasing after things of this world for answers is pointless,DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT25"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"as we see in the quotation that opened this book:All the toil is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. For whatadvantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor manhave who knows how to conduct himself before the living? Better is thesight of the eyes than the wandering of desire; this also is vanity and astriving after wind.40Indeed, Ecclesiastes is clear on desire:He who loves money will not be satisfied with money; nor he who loveswealth, with gain: this also is vanity.41To an extent, these verses place Qoheleth42as the condemner of desire; a religiouscall to turn our attention from worldly matters to spiritual ones. However it is inmore than tone that Ecclesiastes goes further than this view. It indicates that life isa joyless venture, a place in which we will find frustration. Indeed the exhortation,as Dollimore reads it, comes across rather like a Stoical or Epicurean assertion:The positive notes in Ecclesiastes add up to a resigned, undefiant, formofcarpe diem.... . . Be grateful for being alive, no matter how briefly; enjoy the pleasuresof life, even though they are outnumbered by sorrow.43Ecclesiastes offers only this limited answer to the nature of the world and the prob-lem that causes us. While limited, its evocative setting out of the problem is undeni-ably powerful. This picture of the world is not so divorced from Buddhist accounts.44Elsewhere in Christian thought, we often find dissatisfaction with expressionsof desire that do not relate to God. Looking back at the indiscretions of his youth,St Augustine is in no doubt of the immorality of his past when he ‘muddied thestream of friendship with the filth of lewdness and clouded its clear waters withhell’s black river of lust’.45After the lust, he looks for love, but even upon findingit, finds no ultimate satisfaction there. This is relevant here, as he sees in joy themanner in which it is mixed with pain:My God, my God of mercy, how good you were to me, for you mixedmuch bitterness in that cup of pleasure!46Indeed, desire as a wearying burden is a common thread in much Western thought,as John Armstrong notes:In St Augustine’s eyes, one of the things we long for is relief from theapparently futile cycle of desire – a theme echoed 1,500 years later bySchopenhauer.47DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT26"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Elsewhere, we find – as we shall also see in Chapter 2 – the notion of desire forGod. In Christian thought, we can find shelter by reorientating our desires God-ward. This is a recurrent theme in much Judaeo-Christian thought. The idea ofyearning or longing after the divine is expressed articulately in the Psalms:As a hart longs,for flowing streams,so longs my soulfor thee, O God.My Soul thirsts for God,for the living God.48We would be guilty of negligence if we ignore one verse from elsewhere beforewe move on from Christianity and the Bible. Here the transience of the phenom-enon of humanity is bemoaned and seen as depriving our existence of meaning:Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.He comes forth like a flower, and withers; he flees like a shadow, and continues not.49This view brings to the mind notions of desire as linked to death.Shakespeare: love, death and desireDespite the vastness of Shakespearian material on desire, I want to restrict myexaminations here to one sonnet, maybe even one line. I will quote the wholesonnet to show the context:My love is as a fever, longing stillFor that which longer nurseth the disease;Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,Th’ uncertain sickly appetite to please.My Reason, the physician to my Love,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,Hath left me, and I desperate now approveDesire is death, which physic did except.Past cure I am, now reason is past care,And frantic mad with evermore unrest;My thoughts and discourse as mad men’s are,At random from the truth vainly express’d;For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.50DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT27"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"In the light of discussions about Plato and the role of reason in relation to desire,I am particularly struck by the image of reason as ‘physician to my Love’. Lovehere is a sickness,51and reason can offer the only remedy. Alas, though, forthe love is too strong for reason, overpowering it – so much so that ‘reason ispast care’. But to come to the line which led me to quote this passage –‘Desire is death’. A striking assertion, no doubt, but what are we to make of it?Dollimore offers an answer, albeit one that acknowledges the (surely intentional)ambiguity:The starkness of the statement should not obscure a lingering ambiguityand ambivalence: it means most obviously ‘I experience, I demonstrate –reluctantly, in desperation – that desire is death’: ‘Racked with animpossible, contradictory, self-annihilating desire, I desire death.’52While unconvinced that we are to read this primarily as ‘death is better than thishell of desire’53as Dollimore does, I see the sonnet as both the embracing andrejection of desire. Here is one whom passion has claimed, but the victim retainsenough therapeutic rationality to recognise their fate, if not avert it.54‘Desire is death’ in the sense also that desire is a reaching out – a belief infuture possibilities. But desire as a reaching forward always pulls us forward. Itdrags us, willingly at times, and in torment such as in the sonnet at others, butalways we remain under the sway of this temporal gravity – onwards to the grave.And as we must pass, so must all we desire, be it sentient or not; indeed theBuddhist notion of aniccacasts the world in just such a light.We can find these themes expressed in poignant detail of course in Romeo andJuliet, which, at least on one level, can be read as a cautionary tale on the hasteand excesses engendered by unfettered passion – and its ability to psychologicallyoutrun our reason. In this race reason is left, panting and shaking its head sagely,behind us as desire drives us ahead, seemingly to the object of our desire – butfinally, always, to death.That death and desire are close bed-fellows is a commonplace claim – but itmay seem an odd one. As Dollimore points out, haven’t we got it the wrong wayround?after all, desire is on the side of life, life is opposed to death, thereforedesire also must be opposed to death. . . although manifest and pervasivein Western culture, especially its art, this age-old connection of death andsexuality does become confusing when we stop to think about it.55But, as noted in the introduction, it is the changing nature of the world that doomsdesire to this role – at least for those that see desire as predominantly characterisedby lack. In this context desire becomes necessarily connected with finitude; death,then, represents the ultimate form of finitude.DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT28"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Surveying desire: Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke and HumeBeasts love like men, if men in lust delight,And call that Love which is but appetite.56Moving onwards in our history of desire, we come to Hobbes, and to a distinctionwhich crops up intermittently throughout this history. The love/desire distinction,whereby desire ceases upon attainment of its object, whereas love continues in thepresence of its object – found in the Symposium– is found throughout Westernthought. Here desire is understood primarily through lack. In Hobbes we find thisexpressed explicitly:That which men Desire, they are also sayd to LOVE: and to HATEthose things, for which they have Aversion. So that Desire, and Love, are the same thing; save that by Desire, we always signifie the Absenceof the Object; by Love, most commonly the Presence of the same.57Spinoza offers a twist that links the physical roots of desire with consciousness,as well as making a central ethical point that resounds as rather contemporary:58Desire is appetite with consciousness thereof. It is thus plain from what hasbeen said, that in no case do we strive for, wish for, long for, or desireanything, because we deem it to be good, but on the other hand we deem athing to be good, because we strive for it, wish for it, long for it, desire it.59Before moving on to the great British (well, Scottish) empiricist and sceptic,Hume, I pause briefly in the works of one of his antecedents, John Locke. Locke,born in the same year as Spinoza (1632), sees desire not so much as appetite asan uneasiness:Desire. The uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence ofanything whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it isthat what we call desire; which is greater or less, as that uneasiness ismore or less vehement.60The connection here of desire and ‘uneasiness’ is intriguing. It can be seen asechoing the close links in Buddhist thought between desiring and dukkha,especially the sense of dukkhaas ‘dis-ease’. This sense of desire as a form ofmental disturbance is followed up in Chapters 2 and 3 in some detail. It isworth noting though that while Spinoza sees desire asuneasiness, in Buddhistthought we more usually encounter desire as leadingto the dis-ease that isdukkha.We have encountered the view that reason’s role is to keep desire in check,to stop our wants overwhelming us. Not all would concur, some see reason asa mechanism of fulfilment rather than as a regulator.DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT29"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"David Hume is famous in this respect. Hume’s approach is to relegate reasonto an instrumental role – in particular with regard to morality. Reason is part ofthe means whereby we fulfil our desires. But reason should not, indeed cannot,hope to be the element that selects whatwe want. As he states:Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can neverpretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.61Reason here is not the driving force; it is, as I have heard some call it, ‘a gunfor hire’. For Hume, what we desire, and also what we possess an aversion to,is the basis of all ethical choice and assessment. This does not mean that we areamoral – employing reason to dominate others in a tyranny of unchecked desire.Hume’s notion of ‘the passions’ includes sympathy, the basis of ethics in hisassessment. Hume does see our view of the good, though, as caught up closelywith our desiring:Desire arises from good consider’d simply, and Aversion is deriv’d fromevil. The Will exerts itself, when either the good or the absence ofthe evil may be attain’d by any action of the mind or body.62That which we desire, we call good. That which we recoil from, we call evil. Thisbegins to clearly differ from Buddhist and Aristotelian analyses of desiring andmorality, but it makes clear Hume’s place as a dissenter.63Such an approach is ofcourse partly replicated in the work of Utilitarians such as John Stuart Mill. Whilean analysis of the Utilitarian conflation of the ethical and the desired (as opposedto the desirable64) is beyond the limits of the current work, it is worth noting therobust attack on this position made by G. E. Moore in his Principia Ethica.65Schopenhauer: the will and the worldOne of the key Western writers to address desire, and one of the first to do so withreference to Indian philosophy, is Arthur Schopenhauer in his mammoth The Worldas Will and Representation.66He is clear in his view that all ‘Willing’67– a categoryarguably broader even that just ‘desire’ – is based on ‘lack’:Allwilling[original italics] springs from lack, from deficiency, and thusfrom suffering.68Fulfilment brings this to an end; yet for one wish thatis fulfilled there remain at least ten that are denied.69He goes on in this vein, seeking to demonstrate the futility of willing/desire – a themewe will return to with Schopenhauer and beyond. Schopenhauer sees desire aswhat we might call a tragic force – a force in need of negation or annulment.Schopenhauer is no longer a fashionable thinker. So, why engage with his ideas?DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT30"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"First, he unquestionably has something to say about the nature of the human ‘Will’.Indeed it might be argued that he has so much to say (in The World as Will andRepresentationparticularly, but also elsewhere in his work) that people are a littlereluctant to engage with him, and tend to opt for brief summaries of his thought.The second, and decisive, reason for the extent I examine his thought here ishis explicit acknowledgement of sources from Indian thought – most particularlyBuddhism and Hinduism.70The model of Willing – and desiring – constructed bySchopenhauer is based on an essentially Hindu approach, albeit one influenced inmany ways by a Kantian stance. Rather than posit Appearance and The Forms asPlato does, Schopenhauer prefers the notion of Maya.The Monier-WilliamsSanskrit–English Dictionary has a lot to say about maya, ranging from its moreancient usage as ‘art, wisdom, extraordinary or supernatural power’71to the morecommon interpretation. That is, mayais a way of talking about the world, at leastas we are able to interact with it without religious progress, as illusory and unreal: (in phil.) Illusion (identified in the SaÇkyha with Prakriti or Pradhanaand in that system, as well as in the Vedanta, regarded as the source ofthe visible universe).72In Schopenhauer’s take on maya, he rehearses the traditional idea of life asdream.73He makes a connection, in this regard, with Plato:74TheVedasandPuranasknow no better simile for the whole knowledgeof the actual world, called by them the web of Maya, than the dream, andthey use none more frequently. Plato often says that men live only in thedream; only the philosopher strives to be awake.75But Schopenhauer moves away from a Platonic approach with his world-view.Not only is our knowledge of the phenomenal world illusory (for Plato, onlyKnowledge of the Forms being ‘real’), but the world itself is maya:Here Schopenhauer goes beyond both Kant and Plato, and borrows hismodel from Eastern philosophy; the world of appearance is an illusion(albeit a ‘necessary’ illusion) and reality is hidden behind the ‘veil ofmaya’.76One might be tempted to argue that his view of mayahas to be discussed becauseit provides the metaphysical backdrop to his writing on the Will, which in itself isseen by him as something of a metaphysical principle.It is more than that though; his ideas of the Will are inextricably intertwinedwith his view of the world as experienced. It is the nature of Will that makes thingsappear to us as they do – all metaphysics is ontology; all reality emerges from thenature of being, which is at its heart the nature of the Will. Like the Vedantist equat-ingatmanandbrahman, for Schopenhauer ontology is the unmasker of a grandDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT31"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"metaphysical scheme. That is, to discover things about the nature of what existsand the nature and status of mundane and ultimate reality, we must not look out tothe world. Indeed Schopenhauer does not see science as a means for obtainingknowledge of the world. Writing on Schopenhauer, Solomon describes hisapproach to science:Science in particular is not the road to knowledge but rather a reinforcementof just those illusions which give us a false picture of reality.77Rather, to answer these metaphysical questions, we must engage in the science ofbeing, in ontology, and use that as the basis of our thinking and speculation. Wemust turn inward, and when we do so, what we find is the answers to the world with-out. When we locate within us the driving force, the root of our actions and beliefs,we discover the will, an individual will. But this will we find is not truly ours, forit exists only as a form, expression or manifestation of the universal Will. Whatdistinguishes individual willing from the universal Will is that only the former hasa specific goal in its sights:78Every individual act has a purpose or end; willing as a whole has no endin view.79We shall see this notion reoccur later in this chapter. Schopenhauer repeats thepoint80later in the text, adding that the two are ultimately the same, and that we onlyneed to learn to realise it. This makes him sound even more like a Vedantist. Despiteits seeming difference from will-as-we-experience-it, and unlike the NoumenalforKant, we can know the Will through reflection and introspection. Ontologybecomes a coherent metaphysics by this means.We might claim that Schopenhauer’s view is rather like that of Ve danta– butwhere something akin to tajhatakes the role played in Hindu thought by atman-brahman. Schopenhauer offers no positive evaluation of the Will, as Hinduismdoes of atman-brahman, and we might see some of the views of tajhaas ametaphysical principle (which are discussed in Chapter 3) as close cousins ofSchopenhauer’s position.If we cede to Schopenhauer the existence of this Will, what does that say aboutthe world as we have hitherto experienced it, as a physical phenomenon feltthrough the body? If we start with the body we can see how Schopenhauer buildsup a picture of the Will as the world. The key here is that the body isthe Will. AsSolomon puts it:one’s body is something more than an appearance in the phenomenalworld: it is the Will objectified, not a phenomenal object. This is the key toSchopenhauer’s philosophy. He then generalizes this observation to applyto the world as a whole, which is also a manifestation or objectification ofthe Will.81DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT32"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Schopenhauer is allegedly proposing a world-creating role for the Will, although thisis not to be taken as a positive thing. Schopenhauer expresses this in the notion thatthe world is the Will, as perceived through the process of representation. He makesthe connection between the body and the Will patently clear in one of the very, veryfew passages in The World as Will and Representationthat made me laugh:For intellect and brain are one; and in just the same way, the genitalsystem is one with the most vehement of all desires. I have thereforecalled this the focus of the will. Just because the terrible activity of thissystem still slumbers, while that of the brain already has full briskness,childhood is the time of innocence and happiness, the paradise of life,the lost Eden on which we look back longingly through the wholeremaining course of our lives.82I quote the whole section here not only to show the body as expression ofwill – even in a manner Schopenhauer clearly finds a little distasteful – butalso as the time of childhood almost looks free from the Will; can this makesense? For Schopenhauer however, we are not free in childhood – but the fore-shadowing wanting of childhood is nothing to the full blast of the Will we feel asadults. While Schopenhauer could say it more explicitly, it is not difficult toconnect this with his view of the terrible-ness of the desires associated with thegenitals!83The Will then has much to answer for. As maker of our world it is theforce.Individual humans and animals die and are born, but the Will moves on. Thismight remind one of recent debates regarding genetic determinism, andSchopenhauer does begin to sound a little like Richard Dawkins in The SelfishGene, albeit with the Will as that seeking its purpose in continuation:84This metaphysical desire of the will-in-itself has primarily no other sphereof action in the series of beings than the hearts of the future parents.85When reproduction is prevented, it is for Schopenhauer a metaphysical occurrence:The passion is extinguished also when, through the woman’s eventualbarrenness, the real metaphysical purpose is frustrated, just as happensdaily in millions of seeds trampled under foot. Yet in these seeds thesame metaphysical life-principle strives for existence, and there is noother consolation for this than the fact that an infinity of space, time, andmatter, and consequently an inexhaustible opportunity for return, standopen to the will-to-live.86The Will may be frustrated in the short term, but in the end, it will not be denied.What are we to do then? Buffeted by the Will, struggling to resist the very force thatis the basis of the world and even our body, surely we are doomed to pessimism andDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT33"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"misery. We may obtain some respite from the Will though, as Alasdair MacIntyrenotes on Schopenhauer:In a moment of compassion we extinguish self-will. We cease to strivefor our own existence; we are relieved from the burden of individualityand we cease to be the plaything of Will. The same relief is granted to usin the contemplation of works of art.87Ethical and aesthetic experience can provide a partial relief; they subvert theWill. But this subversion is temporary and difficult. We know how hard it can beto put others before oneself, and Schopenhauer does seem to admire thoseelements of religion that would encourage us to do so. Aesthetic appreciationis finite. During it we may be, literally if we take seriously what Schopenhauersays about the Will as world-maker, beyond space and time and the otherformations of the Will, but we cannot remain lost in this artistic rapture forever.And once we cease, the Will rushes back, as forceful and unceaseless as ever.88Does Schopenhauer offer us any other reprieve? Yes – but it is one that is unlikelyto cheer the reader, as Solomon remarks:The only durable escape from the Will, however, is through philosophy.In philosophy one gives up (or ought to give up) the false optimismthat everything happens for a purpose, that life is essentially good, thathappiness is, after all, possible (this is why, in addition to sheer envy andcompetitiveness, Schopenhauer so despised Hegel). The truth is ratherthat of the Upanishads: life is suffering.89The other route to deny the Will that Schopenhauer recognises is that of ascetics,celibates and saints of some sorts, whom Schopenhauer saw as managing to fullydeny the Will – putting an end to the world as Will. Whether or not Solomon iscorrect regarding the message of the Upanisadscan wait till Chapter 2, but ifwe look to the way that philosophy is a solution to the Will we find it expressednegatively. Indeed, the solution is a denial of the Will. In the conclusion to the firstvolume,90Schopenhauer admits that his only answer is negative:We, however, who consistently occupy the standpoint of philosophy,must be satisfied here with negative knowledge, content to have reachedthe final landmark of the positive. If, therefore, we have recognized theinner nature of the world as will, and have seen in all its phenomenaonly the objectivity of the will; and if we have followed these from theunconscious impulse of obscure natural forces up to the most consciousof man, we shall by no means evade the consequence that, with the freedenial, the surrender, of the will, all those phenomena also are nowabolished.91DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT34"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Here Schopenhauer is alerting us to the consequences of such a denial – of theneed to relinquish, possibly, our attachment to the world. For the world as weexperience it is an objectification of that which enslaves us and drives us to suffer –not something to be clung to and desired. We can make a clear comparison hereto Buddhist notions of craving, but in a way that foreshadows some of thechallenges faced in Chapter 3. Schopenhauer makes this Will a metaphysicalprinciple. In general tajhais not seen as such a principle, but we shall see somein Chapter 3 proposing such a view of tajha– as a metaphysical notion that actsso as to be the constructer of our lived experience.Indeed, the echoes of Indian philosophical thought are clear here, asSchopenhauer moves on to show that our resistance to such ideas is the Willdefending itself. The final offering of Schopenhauer is a negation, a dissolving intowhat we might describe as ‘emptiness’ – although ‘nothingness’ might be more inline with Western philosophical nomenclature, this idea does have parallels withMahayana notions of Funyata. This denial of will, this letting-go, leads to the endof the world as we know it:Subject and object; all these are abolished with the will. No will: norepresentation, no world.92Before us there is certainly left only nothing; but that which strugglesagainst this flowing away into nothing, namely our nature, is indeed just thewill-to-live which we ourselves are, just as it is our world. That we abhornothingness so much is simply another way of saying that we will life somuch, and that we are nothing but this will and know nothing but it alone.93Finally Schopenhauer disappoints, for his solution to this world of futile willingand suffering seems like rather a thin-soup answer, lacking the substance andforce of his diagnostic arguments. We may be able to subvert the will temporarilyvia art and philosophy – but not for long. There may be a possibility of a permanentdenial – through asceticism; but even this offers only the prospect of a world-ending solution – no wonder Nietzsche ultimately sees Schopenhauer amongstthe hosts of the ‘world-denying’.Nietzsche to Deleuze: desire, will and powerIn a number of thinkers we see desire as dynamic – as something on the move:Desire is movement, be it in Freud’s drives, Nietzschean forces, in Reich’sanalysis of the buried hopes that chose fascism or in Deleuze and Guttari’ssense of production.94Here we can see desire as active, and in more contemporary Western thought we seethis alongside a rejection of characterising desire as ‘lack’. Nietzsche seems –although it is not always totally clear – not to see desire as absence and lack; ratherDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT35"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"he sees it as creative – as force. Alan Schrift claims that:The link between desire and creativity appears frequently in Nietzsche’stexts.95Of course, Nietzsche is more associated with ideas of ‘will’ than explicitly ‘desire’,but I have argued that they are closely related. Given that willing is closely connectedwith wanting, as discussed in the Introduction, we can clearly see the notion of theWill-to-Power as the (ideal) basis of human action. Even when it is sublimated, suchas in the Will-to-Nothingness,96it is still an active willing. The Will-to-Nothingnessis a desire that seeks its own destruction; now where have we heard that before?We can, then, see Nietzsche reading desire as creative. A reading of the Will-to-Power as a reversal or attack on desire as lack is encountered most explicitly inthe otherwise rather opaque writing of Gilles Deleuze. Deleuze shares a responseto the view we have seen of desire as lack with many of his contemporaries:There is no concept that incurs greater wrath among contemporarytheorists of desire than that of lack.97Indeed, Deleuze’s disdain for the idea of desire as ‘lack’ almost manages toout-disdain Nietzsche:Desire: who except Priests would want to call it ‘lack’? . . . Those wholink desire to lack, the long column of crooners of castration, clearlyindicate a long resentment, like an interminable bad conscience.98Deleuze’s recognition of desire as force, as affirmation, as power is described inways that evoke both a Nietzschean feel and the grand tone of the Vedas:There isn’t a desire for power; it is power itself that is desire. Nota desire-lack, but desire as plenitude.99Here he sees desire not as an attempt to obtain power, but as an expression ofpower. It is power seeking a channel, hence its association with plenitude. Thisseems to revisit Nietzschean notions of the noble man acting ethically towardsothers not out of pity, but out of a ‘superfluity of power’.100Furthermore, this idea is advanced by Deleuze in a way that claims any lack indesiring is not lack of the object, but lack of a subject.101That the lack lies withinseems to indicate the reoccurrence of Continental thought’s concern with thenature of the Self. We can see this Self as represented by absence – an absence weseek to fill through the objects of desire. The similarities with Buddhist notionsofanattaare striking, and this will be returned to later. So, we can see the absencein desiring as the absence of Self – as Sartre has it: ‘Nothingness lies coiled in theheart of being – like a worm.’102DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT36"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Here Sartre encapsulates this idea of our true nature, as lacking, as at base levelnothingness, as something lurking within us, almost malignant. We might specu-late that mistaking the absence within for an absence without is the base root ofdesiring.103This is an externalising of our own ‘nothingness’, but also might beseen as related to the notion of ignorance. It evokes Hindu ideas whereby oursuffering is often seen as arising from ignorance of our true nature – albeitthe permanent atmanin that case (where we think we lack something that wealready have).The absence may be felt as though external – but are we not then sublimatingour own nature as Self-lacking when we desire external objects of desire? Perhapsdesire for external objects is the means by which we seek to deny our lack of acoherent subject.Might we be creators of the I/World duality through the very act of desiring?Is it our reaching out to find another means of representing this lack that givesrise to the subject/object distinction – where we are able to view things beyondthe Self from an illusion of Self-hood?We might consider this as rather Buddhist-sounding. Could we liken a sublimatedWill – even the Schopenhauerian form of it – to the vibhava-tajhaof the SecondNoble Truth?104I think we might – perhaps the closest notion is that ofNietzsche’s Will-to-Nothingness, a Self-destructive drive, or a desire to escape theinevitability of Being.In his entry on Deleuze, John Lechte summarises Deleuze’s approach to desire:We have seen that desire is not a desire based on lack – which is negative –but is always in movement and reforming itself: it is an affirmativeprocess of flows and lines of flight.105The denial of lack here is the lack of the object, and does not seem to affect hiscomments on the nature of Self. Maybe like Deleuze and Nietzsche106we can seedesire as more than lack, but as creative. Of course, such a Will has the potentialto be destructive as well, but this does not preclude its creative potential. Desirehas been discussed in the context of the Will-to-Power.107Looking at Nietzsche’sWill-to-Power and the manner it can be understood as being related to desire,Michael Stoeber (through a comparison with Dostoevsky’sThe BrothersKaramazov) sees clearly the creative element in desiring. He begins with thethought of Jacob Boehme, who refers to will as a ‘self-fuelled fire’108– a phrasewith many echoes to Buddhist ears. As will be demonstrated in Chapter 3, thereis no doubt that desire, at least in some forms, is Self-perpetuating – it is seen asa result of desiring that we exist at all, given that the elimination of tajhais oftenequated with the elimination of dukkhaand therefore the attainment ofnibbana.109Or inversely, it is desire that chains us to the wheel of rebirth.Boehme, via the work of Friedrich von Schelling, is believed to have had someinfluence on Nietzsche’s account of the will.110In this account, willing – linkedDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT37"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"to desire – is a deeply creative and pro-active, rather than reactive, act/state:This primary ungrounded will-spirit is ever seeking a ground in theobjects of its imagination. To put it bluntly, it becomes what it wants.111Its freedom lies in the point of desire from which imagination arises andseeks to fulfil itself.112Desire is cast here as almost an internal uprising, an upsurge of power seeking anobject. Or as Stoeber puts it a little further into his discussion: ‘The goal is whatthe will makes of its power.’113Like, as we shall see, some Indian thinkers,Stoeber, in his reading of Nietzsche, sees the creative aspect of willing:The nature of becoming is determined by this primary and self-justifiedcommanding of the will.114While we do find a concern with ‘willing’ inThe Brothers Karamazov, it is toDostoyevsky’s tragi-comic masterpiece Notes from the Undergroundthat we mustturn to see desires run amok as a cautionary tale. While the concerns of this bookprevent too much of a digression on it, there is something haunting and terribleabout the image conjured by ‘that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward’.115Of course, Nietzsche’s view of the nature of desire is one with historicalantecedents – as we saw.116Indeed it has to be seen in the context of his responseto Greek thought. In response to Plato’sRepublicNietzsche questions the primacyof reason over desire:For Nietzsche, a principal source of tyranny is the platonic convictionthat of the three sources of human motivation (reason, will and theappetites) reason should dominate.117Here we can clearly see a concern with the hierarchy of motivation established byPlato. It is also interesting to note that what others translate as ‘spirit’, Goodheartgives as ‘will’. I do not treat desire as purely ‘appetite’, and so might consider‘will/spirit’ to also contain part of what I indicate when I discuss desire in thiscontext. This is another debate touched upon by the protagonist of Notes from theUnderground:You see, Gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there’s no disputingthat, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational sideof man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life.118To privilege reason over other aspects of motivation is seen as to only partially under-stand what it means to be human. Clearly to invert the hierarchy may be equallyproblematic, and while the anti-hero of Notes from the Undergroundseems in dangerof this, Eugene Goodheart sees Dostoyevsky’s character as opposing the oppositionDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT38"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"between the two, rather than seeking to place ‘will’ in the place of ‘reason’:InNotes from the Underground, the protagonist argues for desire againstreason or, more accurately, against the opposition between desire andreason in which reason asserts its superiority.119In assessing the relations of desire and reason, what Goodheart calls a ‘dialectic ofdesire’,120the anti-hero of Notes from the Undergroundsees desire as part of theescape from the tyranny of reason. It is not so much a wish to subvert reason tothe rule of the ‘passions’, as Hume seems to have recommended, but to dispute thenotion that the two are bi-polar opposites. In true post-modern style, Dostoyevskystands against the notion of binary oppositions.121Furthermore, we might see here the wish to use desire, rhetorically and philo-sophically, as a strategy in combating overly mechanistic views of human nature.This has echoes of Aristotle’s notions of harmony over an integrated person whichpromotes the virtues – although such virtues may not exactly match those thatNietzsche would have us adopt.In seeking to liberate humanity from the reduction of life, and in particularmorality, to calculation and some kind of reductionism, desire can play a key role:In rebellion against a despotic utilitarian reason that deprives theindividual of his personal identity, in effect reducing him to a ‘cipher, astatistic,’ an instance of the laws of nature, the underground man affirmsthe authenticity and freedom of being through desire.122Nietzsche’s approach to the notion of ‘Will’ must, of course, be placed in thecontext of his response to Schopenhauer. While he found much early inspirationin his writings, Nietzsche sees Schopenhauer as falling into the trap of viewingdesire as something to be denied. He sees Schopenhauer’s work as:A mendacious attempt of genius to marshal, in aid of a nihilistic totaldevaluation of life, the very counter-instances, the great self-affirmationsof the ‘will to live’, the exuberant forms of life.123He goes on to accuse him of this with respect to arenas of endeavour such as artand beauty, as well as sympathy. This is the greatest possible condemnation fromNietzsche – that something is life-denying is worse than calling it false.124Hegoes on to further damn Schopenhauer by likening his thought to Christianity:the thirst to deny the ‘will’ – the greatest piece of psychological false-coinage in history, Christianity alone excepted. Looked at more closelyhe is in this merely the heir of the Christian interpretation.125Indeed Nietzsche believes, rightly I tend to think, that Schopenhauer makes afundamental error when discussing ‘will’. Indeed his claim is extended toDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT39"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"philosophers in general, and in a sense is part of the rationale for this endeavour:Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were thebest-known thing in the world; indeed Schopenhauer has given us tounderstand that the will alone is really known to us......Willing – seems to me to be above all something complicated,something that is a unity only in name.126He goes on to elaborate, discussing a dynamic of willing, leading to the conclusion:a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such withinthe sphere of morals – regarded as the doctrine of the relations ofsupremacy under which the phenomenon of ‘life’ manifests itself.127Here willing seems to come closer to the way desire is often discussed, as moral –although Nietzsche is more likely to be indicating that it is requiring of moralassessment, rather than its being moral in itself.128Elsewhere Nietzsche seems tomove willing and desire apart somewhat. However, what is most significant here isthat allowing for a complexity of will seems to also leave Nietzsche able torecognize the complexity of desire – and assert that some desires are notthe sameas will. As mentioned in the introduction, Will may be the resisting of desire – andat times in conflict with it; although of course, desires themselves are often in con-flict with each other as well. This means that Nietzsche sometimes is rather ambigu-ous in his assessment of desire. At one point he wishes to cast it in a negative role:The immoralist speaks. – Nothing offends a philosopher’s taste morethan man when he expresses desires. . . the philosopher despises desiringman, and the ‘desirable’ man too – he despises all the desiderata, all theidealsof man.129His account here seems to see desire in a sense as different from will, in that‘desire’ here is a retreat from doing:How does it come about that man, so admirable as a reality, deserves norespect when he expresses desires? Does he have to atone for being soable as a reality? Does he have to compensate for his activity, for theexertion of will and hand involved in all activity, with relaxation in theimaginary and absurd?130The type of desire Nietzsche refers to here is a non-willing desire. In some sensesthis might be taken as a reference to ‘longing’, to that range of desires we possessfor the non-immediate future. It may be that the religious yearning-type of desirethat much religion isable to accept as a tolerable form of desire, is a form ofdesire that Nietzsche wishes to exclude from his positive (re)evaluation of DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT40"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"willing (and to an extent desire). In that light perhaps his comments should notsurprise us.A key thing to take from what has been said here, particularly with relation toDeleuze and Nietzsche, is that desire – in the form we encounter it as an elementof our lived experience – is constructed. As William Bogard notes in an on-lineposting, which also captures the context in which desire is often discussed inContinental thought:Class distinction (bifurcation) is also hooked up with the problem ofdesire in capitalist economies (how desires are produced, restricted,channelled, condensed). Veblen, certainly, recognized this. This was alsothe focus of ‘poststructuralist’ philosopher Gilles Deleuze in his bookAnti-Oedipus (with Felix Guattari).131I end this section by turning, albeit briefly (for it is primarily used in a politicalsense beyond my current remit), to an idea that seems to evoke certain Buddhistideas. In some writing by Deleuze he uses the term ‘desiring machines’, by whichhe seeks to represent the intensely intertwined nature of desire and human-ness.Referring to Deleuze’s view of Nietzsche’s Will-to-Power, Brian Massumi writes:InAnti-Oedipus, a tendency of this kind was called a ‘desiring machine’.Due to persistent subjectivist misunderstandings, in A Thousand Plateausthe word was changed to the more neutral ‘assemblage’.132This notion of an ‘assemblage’ – with the idea of a ‘desiring-machine’ related toit – may indeed make us think of the Buddhist notion of a person as consisting of‘the aggregates’ – and with the role of desire in Buddhist thought this seems rein-forced. Clearly the political senses that Deleuze relates to desire are absent fromBuddhist thought, but we can see the resonances between the two.This notion of ‘desiring machines’ not only may seem to fit with a ‘causalprocess’ view of the nature of humans (or indeed, ‘sentient beings’), but relates tothis notion of desire as a reaching out into the world – an affirmation far from theidea of ‘lack’. John Landau seeks to clarify Deleuze’s notion, with some success:To speak of ‘desiring machines’ or ‘desiring contraptions’ is to under-stand subjectivity in terms of these sorts of interlocking fields or circuitsof couplings. We cannot be confined to the bag of skin which is ‘our’body’s exterior. Who we are is a circuit of couplings – this implicates usin the world and in each other. Thus desire is always social and alwaysgeared towards an active expression or reaching-out-ness, not out of lackbut out of affirmative forcefulness and urge to contact.133This gives us a much clearer sense of the rejection of desire as ‘lack’, and reinforcesthe notion of desire as a creative out-reaching. Further to this, Deleuze’s view ofDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT41"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"desire, while seeing instances of it as caught up in a complexity of relations, doessee desire in itself as a power which underlies mundane existence. We shall seemuch more of this in the Hindu views in Chapter 2, but Dorothea Olkowski seesthis clearly in Judith Butler’s reading of Deleuze:The absence of specificsocial and historical conditions qualifyingDeleuze’s conception of desire leads Butler to conclude that desire is an‘ontological invariant’, ‘a universal ontological truth’ that Deleuze hasmanaged to release from an interminable period of suppression.134Olkowski identifies this suppression as originating in Plato’sSymposium, whereit is seen as a sign of, but not the content of, our ‘ “ontic” incompleteness’.135There is no doubt that Deleuze breaks with this view of desire as ‘lack’, butwhether he goes as far as Butler seems to suggest is questionable. Yes, he grantspower unto desire, but is unclear whether he could be fairly characterised assuggesting it as a formal ground of being; a metaphysical or cosmic principle oforigination seems a step too far for his view. We will see such a view, but will haveto wait till the Chapter 2 (and travel back to the time of the Vedas) to do so.Hegel and ButlerOne of the most lively theorists currently working on the notion of desire is JudithButler. Her work on desire draws primarily on Hegel, which is why I considerHegel here a little out of turn (his death being thirteen years before the birth ofNietzsche).Hegel draws heavily on Western philosophical tradition, viewing desire asclosely related to lack. Showing also Hegel’s affinity with Spinoza, Butler indicatesHegel’s view of the nature of desire:For Spinoza and Hegel, the metaphysical place of the human subject isarticulated through the immanent rationality of desire, for desire is at oncethe fundamental striving of the human subject and the mode through whichthat subject rediscovers or constitutes its necessary metaphysical place.136Hegel’s placing of desire in this metaphysical location, and the connection withlack, places him outside the counter-tradition that we have seen in the sectionabove. Furthermore the optimistic tone of Hegel finds few takers amongstcontemporary theoretical discourse:The criticisms waged against Hegel by Lacan insist upon the psycho-analytic inevitability of dissatisfaction, while Deleuze and Foucault,through recourse to Nietzsche, take issue with the entire Hegelianemphasis on negativity and offer a version of desire based on excess andplenitude rather than lack.137DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT42"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Nonetheless, Butler wishes to defend Hegelianism, and Hegel does say a certainamount about desire in his Phenomenology of Spirit.This discussion mainly occurs in section IV, The Truth of Self Certainty, andwhile this is a reading deeply entrenched in the technical vocabulary of his style,he makes some startling claims. He does identify desire with self-consciousness,fundamental to our mental make-up; indeed he goes as far as to write that ‘self-consciousness is Desire’.138This is not the whole view though, for desire isclosely related to the notion of the ‘Other’.Desire is what directs us toward the other – initially as an object of desire, forus, rather than as another human subject – but is also what makes us aware of theother as something which is more than an object of experience, but which is alsoa subject, a for-itself. After just such an analysis, Hegel intentionally reinforcesthis point by knowingly contradicting the statement above:It is in fact something other than self-consciousness that is the essenceof Desire.139This may seem paradoxical, but makes sense when we see desire in the context ofHegel’s overall view of self-consciousness:Self-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, itso exists for another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.140Desire here is the way self-consciousness becomes aware of itself, and the storyof human completion is through the realisation of its relation to others. Thisseems captured by a brief line from Pasternak: ‘...everything in the world mustexcel itself to be itself ’.141Sartre – desire and nothingnessMan is a useless Passion.142I will come back to Jean-Paul Sartre in the concluding chapter, but wish to brieflyaddress his most direct engagement with the notion of desire. Most explicit is hiscomment that ‘fundamentally man is the desire to be’.143Sartre, as we must surely expect, does not see a completion of this ‘being’though. I have mentioned previously the idea that actual, individual desiresemanate from some more fundamental general form of desire, be this the subli-mation of sexual desire, or the blind striving of the flailing Will of Schopenhauer.Butler describes this when she discusses the:Sartrian contention that all human desire is a function of the desire tobecome God. But for Sartre, this desire is bound to fail.144DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT43"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Desire here is insatiable, it will never – in the atheistic world-view of Sartreanexistentialism – find fulfilment. But were it to do so, this too, from Sartre’sperspective, would be in itself a tragedy for it would signal the end of life itself.This is clear when Butler describes Sartre’s view of desire:It is the entirety of our spontaneous selves, the ‘outburst’ that we are, theupsurge that draws us toward the world and makes the world our object,the intentionality of the self.145While we may inhabit a world of contingent reality, burdened by freedom, Sartresees desire as a vitality amongst this – even if it is condemned to fade and pass.The purification of desire: TheosophyA brief word now on a group as close in theory to the Chapter 2 as this one, ifgeographically and culturally located in this chapter – Theosophy. Theosophy, ascharacterized by Helena Blavatsky and Colonel H. S. Olcott’s ‘TheosophicalSociety’,146is a self-consciously constructed form of religious and philosophicalthought. A fair description of it can be found in A Dictionary of Philosophy,where it is characterized as having doctrines that ‘are a blend of Hindu andNeo-platonic elements’.147I think it is fair to say that its initial purpose was:To derive from ancient wisdom and from the insights of evolution aworld ethical code.148Whether this goal was achieved I leave for others to judge, but I invoke their namehere because of their interest in desire. A common approach of Theosophists is toclaim that desire – as normally experienced – is a lower form of a Divine oruniversal Will – leading to the need to ‘purify’ desire:Will is the exclusive possession of man on this our plane of consciousness.It divides him from the brute in whom instinctive desire only is active.Desire, in its widest application, is the one creative force in theUniverse. In this sense it is indistinguishable from Will; but we mennever know desire under this form while we remain only men. ThereforeWill and Desire are here considered as opposed.Thus Will is the offspring of the Divine, the God in man; Desire themotive power of the animal life.Most of men live in and by desire, mistaking it for will. But he whowould achieve must separate will from desire, and make his will the ruler;for desire is unstable and ever changing, while will is steady and constant.Both will and desire are absolute creators, forming the man himselfand his surroundings. But will creates intelligently – desire blindly andDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT44"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"unconsciously. The man, therefore, makes himself in the image of hisdesires, unless he creates himself in the likeness of the Divine, throughhis will, the child of the light.His task is twofold: to awaken the will, to strengthen it by use andconquest, to make it absolute ruler within his body; and, parallel with this,to purify desire.Knowledge and will are the tools for the accomplishment of thispurification.149We see here a mixture of some of the things I have been discussing. Desire andWill undergo a qualitative separation. We also see the acknowledgement of desireas a creative force – if a morally ambiguous one.150Indeed it is this point that isthe most important here; foreshadowed in this chapter, but coming into its ownin the next when we assess desire in Vedic thought.Mind-made desiresIn Chapter 4, I will consider the extent, from a Buddhist perspective, to which ourdesires are not a reaction to sensory stimuli, to sense data, but rather are ‘mind-made’ – the projection into the world of our own consciousness. Not all thewriters we have seen here though would ascribe to this view, and there are otherways in which desire is seen as being constructed.The forms of desire may well be socially constructed; that is, the manner inwhich desire expresses itself, what it takes as object. We began to look at this withDeleuze, but beyond that might we not even see the very nature of the desiresthemselves – their type andtheir object as so constructed? If so, this underminesthe notion that desire arises from the body, and possibly even from the mind,unless we see the mind as acting as part of these socio-cultural relations.Might there be wholly culturally-constructed desires (although we often take themto be universal aspects of some shared human nature)? Probably the best example ofthis is romantic ‘love’. In Love in the Western WorldDenis de Rougement argues thatif people had not heard of this notion of ‘love’ they would not actually ‘fall in love’.The representation of desire in a new way allows, maybe even causes:neglected potentialities of the heart suddenly to become profuselyactualized.151This seems altogether possible, especially if we are able to step back a little fromthe Western fetishisation of the notion of romantic love, and more recently ofsexual desire. Both of these oft-intertwined152desires or drives may have aphysiological element as root factor, but their form and expression is constructedby numerous factors. This may give a sense of how our lived experience, partic-ularly of desire, is partly constructed by the concepts present within us. Some ofthose whose views I have examined in this chapter may have hinted at this, butDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT45"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"we shall see in Buddhist texts, especially in the context of paticca-samuppada,a more sophisticated account of the arising of wanting.One issue raised by this discussion is the extent to which these ideas posit thatculture wholly constructs desire, or acts as a channelling mechanism. That is, isthere some desire, like the Schopenhauerian Will, which then becomes channelledonto various foci? Or can we go further, suggesting that desire comes solely fromcultural contexts – that it can be seen as purely the sum of arising from particular-ist interactions? Such a view clearly goes against the view of many discussed here.Whether or not we can find connections between this and the Buddhist viewwill depend on how we come to view that nature of desire in Buddhism. As indi-cated, we shall see some in Chapter 3 who would raise tajhato such a level thatit expressly opposes such a contention.ConclusionI must take the long journey to Athens, city of learning:May the length of the way set me free from love’s oppression.My passion grows when I constantly gaze at my loved one;It is love itself that nourishes love.153Much of what has been said in this chapter regarding desire undoubtedly casts itas a villain. Desire drives our vanity; the Will is, to Thomas Mann writing onSchopenhauer:A fundamental unhappiness, it is unrest, a striving for something– it iswant, cravings, avidity, demand, and a world of will can be nothing buta world of suffering.154For others the will is in constant tension with reason – no matter which of themone thinks should be the ruler in this dialectic dispute, and there are others againwho take issue with the whole notion of opposing the two155in this manner, fromAristotle to Deleuze. There is more of this to come. In Chapter 2 we will see a tra-dition turn on desire, but the Vedic approach is – like much of what we have seenhere – testament to the complexity of desire as a psychological and, in theUpanisads, an ethical phenomenon. Furthermore, the role of reason has some-times been contrasted with desire, and we shall, In Chapter 4, investigate the wayBuddhism views reason in its discourse with desire.Furthermore, we might claim that some of the more interesting responses todesire represent the view that desire can be the bridge to the (re)completion of thehuman condition through creative imagining. Desire could be seen as somethingwhich we use to define ourselves, to make ourselves. This notion of the creativepower of desire will be seen expanded to a cosmological level in the Chapter 2.One of the most useful notions to emerge here is the relation of the Self todesire. When I discussed the lack of a coherent or enduring Self or subject as theDESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT46"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"root of the belief of desire as a lack, the Buddhist echoes became deafening.Kojéve sees our inner lack as driving desire in a way that leads to us seeking tonegate or destroy the other – the object of desire:the I of Desire is an emptiness that receives a real positive content onlyby negating action that satisfies Desire in destroying, transforming and‘assimilating’ the desired non-I.156The obvious connection between this approach and the Buddhist teaching onanattais further examined in Chapter 5, as is the notion of change, expressed soclearly in the work of Seneca and its relation to anicca.In Western thought, this link between our desiring and our ‘emptiness’ clearlycomes out of an intellectual period that spawned Sartre and Heidegger. Herewhile we might argue that desire still arises from ‘lack’, the lack is not an absenceof the apparent object of desire; rather it is the hole at the centre of our being thatwe would fill. But this lack is irresolvable; emptiness is our nature,157being thebasis of our characteristic of negation.An important issue that has come to the fore in this chapter is the way thatdesire has been seen as extending beyond our individual wants for specificobjects. We have seen notions of Will employed which grant it grand metaphysi-cal significance (we will see this metaphysical tone supplemented, and to anextent replaced, by a cosmological approach in the Chapter 2). We have seen the‘emptiness’ of the human subject as the driving force of desire; alongside whichdesire has often been cited as creative, although in differing ways. One theme thatis important here is that desire is a general force, with no specific object; onlywhen it erupts into consciousness does it then, in combination with either ourdispositions or cultural forces, begin to be clearly directed at individual objects ofdesire.158More recently, as we have begun to see, desire has become a more significantfocus of Western philosophical discourse. Alongside this is a recognition of itscomplexity. While mainly concerned with the social production of our desires,Patricia Leavy recognises the occurrence of desire between the subject and objectof desire, the complexity in unravelling the factors involved in even a singleoccurrence of desiring:The desire for the product or passion does not exist in my body alone,but rather in the relation between the object or subject and myself. In ourpostmodern context the mediating factors between what is desired andthe desirous individual are increasingly manifold yet often invisible.159While she has other fish to fry, the recognition here of desire’s complexity isinteresting. Furthermore, Leavy claims that desire is a relational event. While thismay not wholly coincide with notions of a metaphysical pre-object principle ofcosmic desire, it seems to accord with experience.

We shall pick up this notion in Chapter 4, where the paticca-samuppadaprocess in Buddhism sees desire as arising in response to certain types ofstimulation.I wish to complete this chapter by reviewing some advice that I intend toignore. In differing from Heidegger’s view that our lack of permanent essence isthe proper object of desire,160Michael Zimmerman points us in appropriate, ifsomewhat Wittgensteinian, manner to the Chapter 2:In the final analysis, I do not believe that what Heidegger described asthe nothingness that ‘gives’ being is the proper ‘object’ of what may behumankind’s ultimate desire. Mystics of various traditions seem to be onthe better track. But of that which we cannot speak, we must remainsilent.161In the conclusion to the book, I draw on the material in this chapter to offercomparisons with Buddhist and Hindu thought on desire. In doing so, I amparticularly interested in some key ideas that have emerged from this chapter.These are: desire understood as absence – of either the object of desire, or the sub-ject of experience (the Self ); desire as a creative force; desire’s links to death; howdesire is viewed in the context of change; and positive and negative evaluations ofdesire, particularly in ethical contexts.DESIRE IN WESTERN THOUGHT48"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Birth is scented with death.Youth’s Brilliance is shadowed by old age.Contentment is menaced by ambition,calm, by impudent women’s amorous looks,virtue by men’s malice,woodlands, by serpents, and kings, by villains.Rich treasure is plundered by transience.Is anything spared the threat of eclipse?Youth in its prime is sappedby a hundred plagues of longing.Wherever the bird of wealth alights,misfortunes swarm through open gates.Soon death is sovereignover every helpless creature born.What is fashioned to endure through Capricious fate?1IntroductionIn describing Professor Nicholas Lash’s piece ‘The Purification of Desire’, JuliusLipner sets out one of the key questions I wish to examine, and possibly answer,in this chapter:Granted that the Gitais concerned basically with the ethics of desire,does it recommend the purificationof desire or its suppression?Ethically, surely this is a burning question for our times, for its answerwill generate not only a particular worldview, but a code of conductarising from it. The contours of a life based on the ‘cleansing of desire’are very different from one based on its ‘abolition’.2Two points with regard to this. First, the question posed here (we will look atLash’s answer when we come to look specifically at the Bhagavad Gita) is one we2DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIANRELIGION49"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"might apply to much Hindu writing on desire. Indeed, it is a question I askof the earliest texts as well of those even later than the Gita. Second, I mustconcur with Lipner’s claim regarding the relevance of such debates. The way an individual – or indeed a society – conceptualises and regards desire ismore than an academic concern. Hinduism recognises the dynamic nature ofdesiring, and from this has offered a variety of strategies for responding to thisinner-dynamism.As yet, we have seen how desire has been dealt with in some strands of Westernphilosophical thought. While Chapter 1 contained substantial material from theWestern canon, desire has rarely been a primaryconcern in Western thought.Much of what was collected in Chapter 1 was, as noted on page 18, originally anaside. Schopenhauer is remarkable and singular in his concern with the will.However, the nature of the Self, particularly in an epistemological sense as thesubject of experience, has long been a concern for Western thinkers, as it has forthose from Indian traditions. In the West, concern with the Self has increasedvastly in the last three hundred years; so much so that R. C. Solomon’s claims forthe role of the Self seem reasonable:The self that becomes the star-performer in modern European philosophyis the transcendental self, or transcendental ego, whose nature and ambi-tions were unprecedentedly arrogant, presumptuously cosmic, and con-sequently mysterious. The transcendental self was the self– timeless,universal and in each one of us around the globe and throughout history.Distinguished from our individual idiosyncrasies, this was the self weshared.3Strong words, but they are worth looking at closely. Primarily they show theimportance of the Self to European thought, but also show how close to someviews in Hindu thought his description of the Self is – timeless, mysterious, andshared. Even odder then, that discussions regarding desire are so central to onediscourse, and so marginal in another.What is notable however with regard to Brahmanic traditions is the manner inwhich the emergence of debates regarding the Self are shadowed – or perhapsconjoined with – discussions regarding the nature, status, efficacy and ethicalaspects of desire. This will be clearly demonstrated in my examination of theUpanisads – arguably the forum where both themes, the Self and desire, come tothe fore as primary religious and philosophical issues.So, why do we find the Self, in the way it is discussed, so intertwined withdesire in Indian thought, while Western discourses of the Self see it as consider-ably less central? This will be followed up in more detail in Chapter 5, but onemight argue that the ontology of Selfhood became sophisticated at a very earlystage in Indian thought, with desire linked with it from the outset. Furthermore,the Indian thought examined here is religious; it has a salvific telos, whereasDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION50"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"much of the Western thought examined has been secular. The identification of theSelf with God has allowed a legitimisation of speculation regarding the Self, forinner searching is then the search for the divine. Furthermore, the concern withdesire in this religious context has allowed, in part, desire to become seen as ahindrance to salvation.While the Introduction has demonstrated the necessity of examining the viewsfound in this chapter, there is a further point. As well as placing a frame aroundthe Buddhist views we shall see emerge in Chapters 3 and 4, what is demonstratedimplicitly throughout this chapter is the centrality of desire to Indian religiousthought.4I do not wish to argue that Buddhism is innovative in treating desire insuch detail; rather my thesis is that the manner of this treatment is novel. While aproportion of the material examined in this chapter post-dates the Buddhist mate-rial I am concerned with, I think it is worth taking a broad look in Hinduism inthe same way I look at Western material. Both present ideas which make for aninteresting and fruitful interplay with Buddhist thought.With this in mind, it clearly makes sense to examine the debates and ideas sur-rounding desire contained within these traditions. Furthermore we have another,arguably stronger, reason for examining these traditions. In recent work on earlyBuddhism, some have argued that we should seek to understand early Buddhism,and especially the stance and style of the Buddha, in the context of the existingBrahmanical atmosphere. We must surely read the texts of early Buddhism as, atleast in part, a response to prevailing Brahmanic thought.5So, it would be wrong to think of Buddhism as being wholly innovative in itsconcern with the nature of desire and the problems it is seen to lead to. It isclear from looking at pre-Buddhist Indian religion, and in those religious textsemerging outside of Buddhism around the time of the Buddha and in the half-millennium following, that the religious traditions which later were to evolve intoHinduism also had a significant interest in both the nature and the consequencesof desire.We would not be overstating the case by claiming that desire, in its manyguises, is a central theme in most forms of religion emanating from the Indiansub-continent. As we shall see, this is not wholly universal – not before theUpanisads is the discussion explicit and central. In the Veda Samhitas manyreferences are partial, and cloaked in ritual and sacrificial contexts. Nonetheless,we shall see that as Hindu thought developed, desire came racing into theforeground – a location it retains to the present day in much Hindu and Hindu-inspired philosophy and religious reflection.Indeed, Madeleine Biardeau takes the view that Hinduism revolves aroundkama. The term kamawill be discussed further elsewhere, but it is a commonterm in Sanskrit, used for desire in general (although sometimes used in a limitedsense to refer to exclusively romantic or sexual desire, it can also be used to referto the object of desire as well).6Desire is seen as central to all action. Indeed,kamais the basis of all initiated activity, all voluntary motion of the human.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION51"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"She draws on the Mahabharata7as well as Nyayaphilosophy8to make the claimthat action always derives from the same process:Invariably the sequence is: knowledge →desire→inclination to act.There is no action that is not preceded by a desire, and the latter is neverthe desire to act, but the desire for an object, for a precise result knownto be good in itself.9This view, to me, does not seem to do justice to the richness of Hindu thought on thematter. In addition to seeming rather rigid, a potential problem with this approach isthe assertion that one can only act, and also only desire, with knowledge as apre-requisite. Does this mean that all desire is based on knowledge? As I demonstratethroughout this chapter, it seems that desire is often problematic because it is basedon ignorance. What is notable though is that both of these sources of desire –ignorance and knowledge – are cognitive faculties and processes.Action based on an ignorance or misperception of the true nature of reality isthe source of negative karmicresults.10This is why the Upanisads– and particu-larly their Vedantin interpreters – exhort us to obtain right knowledge. We shallsee, later in this chapter, why the notion of action as requiring desire is so prob-lematic. However, what Biardeau says does demonstrate the centrality of thoughtregarding desire. It sits at the heart of Hindu thought. In rectifying the way human-ity is flawed and misguided, desire is a component in need of significant work.Desire in the Veda SamhitasWhile there is relatively little clear and consistent discussion of desire inexplicit terms in the Veda Samhitas, we can find references to it. These see it,as do some later texts, as a creative force. At &g Veda10.129.4 we can see this.I found two translations of this verse which seem quite different. First the olderversion:In the beginning this (One) evolved,Became11desire [kama12], first seed of mind.Wise seers, searching In their hearts,Found the bond of Being in Not-being.13The second translation of the same verse is:Desire came upon that one in the beginning;That was the first seed of mind.Poets seeking in their heart with wisdom found the bond of existence innon-existence.14DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION52"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"This is ambiguous – we should not assume that what creates, or maybe dividesin this case, is benevolent or wanted. Nonetheless we do here begin to get a senseof the power of desire. We shall see, as we move through this chapter, the notionof desire as implicated in creation emerging at numerous points. What is signifi-cant here is the way that desire plays a key role in the cosmological outlook ofHinduism. As Dermot Killingley comments:kama is not only part of human experience but a constituent of thecosmos. It is a product of the mind, but mind itself is a cosmic concept,existing prior to the individual. In the Vedic cosmogonies, the questionof what caused the primordial desire does not arise; like the big bang ofmodern cosmology, the primal impulse is beyond time and causation, soit makes no sense to ask what preceded it or caused it.15Desire then forms part of the fabric of the universe; no wonder we see it as atheme running through Hindu philosophy, from the Vedas to the present day.Returning to this notion of desire as part of creation, it is clear that desire ascreative is desire as power. No matter which of the models of desire presentedhere we look at, it is always a thing of some power.If we are told to end desire, it is because of what desire can do to us if we donot. Misdirected or unchecked desire is like a wild beast out of control. Some mayfeel they may tame the beast for their own ends; others may wish to kill it, or driveit away; others may have the bravery to try and ride the beast – to use it as a vehi-cle to some worthwhile goal; but all recognise the power and danger involved.This image of killing, riding and taming will be returned to later.Another notable feature of this passage is the movement from the unitary tomultiplicity. As Killingley writes:This text [&g Veda10.129] might be claimed as the earliest appearance ofthe production of the many from the one, except that the dating of Vedictexts is so uncertain that such a claim would be merely speculative.16Here we see that desire is, in cosmological terms, the cause of differentiation. This isworth bearing in mind when we look at how overcoming desire is one of the key waysof describing the path back, for the individual, to unity with the divine brahman.Desire is, then, a force of creative power. We can see this again at FatapathaBrahmaja11.1.6.1, where the waters wish to procreate. As Killingley remarks: The name given to the original being varies, but the creative process isstill initiated by desire.17While desire in the &g Vedais not, then, universally cast as a villain of theemotions/drives, it is often cloaked in complex ritual and mythical imagery.Here we can see an illustration of a ‘wise one’ as desirous – wisdom not seeminglyDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION53"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"precluding the possession of desire. At &g Veda10.5.5, we find an account of thehiddenAgni:Full of desire,18the wise one brought the seven red sisters out of thehoney to see.19Much of the time in Vedic texts it seems that desires are things to be fulfilled. Onemight argue that the Vedas represent, particularly prior to the full development ofthe doctrine of karmaand rebirth, a pre-moral phase of Hindu thought. Althoughthere is not the space to develop this fully, one might argue that the earliest phaseof Hindu thought is one in which religion is like science – the means to manipulatethe forces of the universe. Rightness for the Vedic ritualist is (sacrificial) compe-tence,20not morality. So, while there may be a concern with ritual intention, thepoint of the ritual – the reason it is being performed – is not a topic for ethicalscrutiny. The ritual is how to get what you want, not a way of transforming theprocess of wanting itself.This fulfilment of desire is then, as we would expect, obtained in ways caughtup with the ritual and beliefs of Vedic religion, as at &g Veda9.113.10–11:Where there are desires and longings,21at the sun’s zenith, where thedead are fed and satisfied, there make me immortal. O drop of Soma,flow for Indra.Where there are joys and pleasures, gladness and delight, where thedesires of desire are fulfilled, there make me immortal. O drop of Soma,flow for Indra.22We can see this again at &g Veda10.121.10, in a rather obscure Vedic hymn muchconcerned with sacrifice and creation:O Prajapati, lord of progeny, no one but you embraces all these creatures.Grant us the desires for which we offer you oblation. Let us be lords ofriches.23We can see here the necessary role of desire as an element of the world-stabilising practice of the sacrifice (desire’s relation to saÅkalpa, ritual intention,will be discussed later in this chapter). However some of the later suspicionand concern over unregulated desire may stem from the notion that such forcesrepresent a move away from order, towards chaos. Desire in this sense isthe upsetter. Desire is what rocks the boat – human desire can endanger theorder of things. This is reason enough to be wary of desire. Order is a power-ful image in Hindu thought from its earliest forms. Order is associated withdharma, disorder with adharma. Order is associated with truth. God can beseen as the source of order, and the sacrifice as the means of its preservation, asDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION54"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"at&g Veda10.190.1–3:Order and truth were born from heat as it blazed up. From that was bornnight; from that heat was born the billowy ocean.From the billowy ocean was born the year, that arranges days and nights,ruling over all that blinks its eyes.The Arranger has set in their proper place the sun and moon, the sky andthe earth, the middle realm of space, and finally the sunlight.24If we see desire as a force of disorder – and uncontrolled, wayward or over-strongdesire would seem to be an enemy of stability – then we can see the cosmic aswell as social and religious forces that would prompt calls for its heavy regula-tion. It may be, as the next section discusses, that some forms of desire – appro-priately directed to the atman– are to be welcomed, but even so that still leavesmuch of what we conventionally consider as desire as an unwelcome guest in thehuman psyche. The first quote I used in this examination of the &g Vedaalso illus-trated a way in which we might even see it as unwelcome to the ‘One’. If we seethe universe as emanating from an episode of desire, we might see the wholesacrificial superstructure of Vedic thought as an attempt to regulate this unleasheddesire – to hold it back and stabilise the world in the face of this power that wouldupset the status quo.But if desire is the force which kick-starts the creative process, that does not meanthat once creation has occurred, this primal desire is sated. Once the world has movedfrom one-ness to many-ness, once multiplicity exists, the desire – and the need forsacrifices to regulate that desire – becomes an ongoing process. As Killingley notes:In many Vedic narratives the primordial sacrifice is followed by furtherdesire, and therefore further descent into the world of differentiation,which leads to the need for further sacrifice.25The regulation of desire, post-primordial sacrifice is, then, something to be main-tained via sacrifice, in a process that will last as long as the world of individuatedbeing persists. I now move from the idea of religion, or key aspects of religion,acting to control desire, to the notion that desire can be seen as being in directconflict with religious ideals.An episode where desire is explicitly cast as hindering religious goals (in a wayfound much more in later Hindu thought) is in a fascinating hymn of the &g Veda,at I.179, concerning the married couple Agastya and Lopamudra. Agastya prac-tices asceticism and has taken a vow of chastity, from which Lopamudrawouldtempt him in order to have children. What is noteworthy is the way Lopamudradescribes the way her desire is manifested:Desire has come upon me for the bull who roars and is held back,26desire engulfing me from this side, that side, all sides.27DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION55"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Like the verse at &g Veda10.129.4, desire is described as something that worksupon the desirer almost from without. Externalising desire is an interesting strat-egy. Throughout much Hindu literature we find kamapersonified, while in muchnon-Hindu thought it is an impersonal force (such as for Schopenhauer). As anexample of the former we find Kamadeva, kamaas a god. At Atharva Veda10.9.2,we find a whole hymn dedicated to a personified form of kama. In this hymn wesee the primacy of kamaamongst the gods asserted:Kama was born at first; him neither the gods nor the fathers haveequalled. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee, O Kama, doI verily offer reverence.28Somewhat later in Hindu thought, kamais often personified again, but here in arole a little like a god of love:In post-Vedic literature, people who are hopelessly in love are describedas afflicted by the arrow or arrows of Kama.29N. J. Shende traces the origins of the use of kamaas the basis of love right backto the Atharva Veda:Thus Kama in the mind of men and women is considered to be the same asthe creative power of the universe. Kama is identified with Agni, to whomofferings are made. This identification is quite appropriate, since, he, thefirst god born, produces fire or heat in the hearts of the lovers (9.2.1.1930).The men and women fallen in love with each other are the representativesof Kama. Love is the basis of creation. Thus Kama is the creator.31We can see the romantic role of kamain, for example, the seventeenth centuryHindi poet Bihari’s work, the Satasi:Kama, the wily huntsman,has taught her so, dear lad,that with her piercing glancesthat fawn-eyed girl of elongated eyeswounds gallants of the town,turning the hunter hunted.32Furthermore, seeing desire as a force without us may strengthen images ofresistance, and may also be implicated in descriptions of the Self as separate fromthe realm of desire. But, if desire is external, where does it come from? It surelycannot be a feature of the underlying Brahman, the true nature of reality,33but isit integral to the nature of maya, the first hook of delusion? Mayaas illusion34isalso seen as the external illusion at times, so we might view externalised desireDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION56"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"as analogous to, or a feature of, the way the ignorance of true reality is alsoexternalised as illusion.We can see desire as both internal and external, for ultimately such distinc-tions are misleading – the gods represent elements of consciousness, just asconsciousness may mirror the pantheon of devas:although kama is a product of the mind, this does not mean that it resultsfrom a conscious act of will. The mythology of kamadeva representskama as a force which attacks the individual from the outside, both whenhis flower arrows cause love at first sight in ordinary mortals, and whenhe attacks Fiva.35Kamais a force which feelsas though it descends upon us from outside; weare aware of this from the moment we are taught, or learn, that we can not(because we should not) always get everything we want:36– we have desires thatare contrary to what we perceive as our principles or welfare.To return to Agastya and his wife’s desire, we find a proposed solution totheir dilemma.37Despite succumbing to his wife’s advances, Agastya somehowmaintains his spiritual path due to his proficiency as a sage. Desire though is seenas something to be wary of – we shall see much more of it as that which woulddisturb the calm sought by the spiritual aspirant.Desire as the enemy of the spiritualAs we move on, we begin to see the notion of desire for the Self as freedom fromdesire. Desire, as we shall shortly see, must be redirected to the appropriate object –the Self. This is seen as equivalent to the transcending or elimination of desire. Ifwe look to the Atharva Veda, at 10.8.44, we find a verse resonant with many ofthose found in the Upanisads:Free from desire, immortal, wise and self-existent,With [its own] savour satisfied, and nothing lacking, –Whoso knows him, the Self, – wise ageless, [ever] young, –Of death will have no fear.38While there is some ambiguity in the text,39the ideas around desire are interesting.Here, the same thing that is ‘free from desire’ is that which is ‘satisfied’. Maybethe desire for the Self is, given the transient nature of the world, the only desirethatcanbe satisfied. The idea may be that desire for the Self is one where the‘savour’ is satisfied. So, as we move on, there is the idea of desire – in its negativeroles – as being either desire for the wrong thing – that is, not for the Self – ordesire not satisfied; which from the spiritually enlightened position are identical.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION57"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"This is echoed in a passage at Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.3.21:Clearly, this is the aspect of his where all desires are fulfilled, where the Selfis the only desire, and which is free from desire and far from sorrows.40Here desire is only negative in part, and to be liberated from only if it is not forthe Self. A person who has achieved the state referred to in this verse is one whohas no desire for anything that is part of the world of multiplicity.41As thepreceding verse (Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.3.21) makes clear, it is a state ofSelf-absorption – an absorption of the atman:It is like this. As a man embraced by a woman he loves is oblivious toeverything within and without, so this person embraced by the self42consisting of knowledge is oblivious to everything within or without.43The notion of freedom from desire is a theme in Vedic discussion, in which thereis a clear recognition of the problem that unfulfilled desires poses. In praising thestones used to ritually press the Soma, &g Vedahymn 10.94 describes them incontrast to the flawed nature of humanity:Porous or not porous, the stones never tire, never rest, never die; they arenever sick or old or shaken by passion; nicely fat they are free from thirstand desire.44Here we see the Soma stones as complete – what Sartre would refer to as être-en-soi,‘being-in-itself ’. As humans, however, we are not complete. Not only do we suf-fer the ravages of ageing, sickness and death, but our very nature is incomplete.Desire is the force that confirms us as not être-en-soi, but as être-pour-soi.‘Being-for-itself ’ rather than ‘in-itself ’ is distinguished as the possession of con-sciousness, but consciousness as nihilation of being-in-itself.45The theme of thedesirability – and indeed the attainability – of freedom from desire is discussedfurther with relation to the Upanisads, as well as clearly being a central theme inChapter 3’s discussion of nibbanaas desirelessness.The hymn to Soma mentioned previously (&g Veda9.113) praises Somadirectly because it can fulfil desires. While I am in no position at this point tospeculate on the psychotropic or narcotic effect of Soma, it is noteworthy thatwhat may be the appeal of many narcotic substances is their effect on desire.While we may condemn such substances for making us slaves to insatiable anddangerously insistent desires, surely one of their most potent characteristics is thefulfilment they offer one who seeks them out. That is, one of the most desirablethings about drugs is their ability to make us feel sated. Under the influence of anarcotic, we no longer want it – if the effect of the drug is all we desire, is whatdrives our life, then when we are fulfilled in this regard, we sit, alas all too briefly,beyond the reach of desire’s cruel touch.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION58"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"If desire is the upsetter, that which drives our angst and causes the subtle,inescapable drive of dukkha, perhaps narcotics such as opiates and cannabis46canmake uscomfortable. Clearly the transience of such chemical comfort, and its flip-side of inflamed and enraged desire, make it unsatisfactory as a spiritual goal, andmost probably self-defeating with regard to desire. Nonetheless we get a clearer pic-ture of the appeal of such substances if we view them as offering significant, albeitbrief, respite from the dis-ease of our own lack-of-being manifested as desire.We have begun now to look at material from beyond the Veda Samhitas, andin looking at the Upanisads we find some shifts in the assessment of desire. In theUpanisads we find much of the Vedic position retained, although the later Upanisadssee a move away from the power of desire, towards concerns over its regulation –culminating in the approach of the Bhagavad Gita. In some places in the Upanisadsthough, desire retains its creative power, as at Chandogya Upanisad8.2.1–10:If such a person desires the world of the fathers, by his intention alonefathers rise up. And securing the world of the fathers, he rejoices.47This formula is repeated for various objects of desires: world of mothers, worldof singing and dancing, the world of friends, etc., till we reach 8.2.10:Whatever may be the object of his desire, anything that he may desire,by his intention alone it rises up. And securing it, he rejoices.This is a startlingly clear expression of desire as creative. But if we look moreclosely it seems that the mechanism of fulfilment is via ‘intention’ –saÅkalpa.The term saÅkalpacan be viewed in Vedic contexts as ritual intention – a neces-sary element for the success of the sacrifice. We might view saÅkalpaas describ-ing the way in which the sacrifice is – to an extent – the harnessing of desire in aritual context.48The term has a range of meanings, and some of the ones the SEDgives are: ‘conception or idea or notion formed in the mind or heart, (esp.) will,volition, desire’.49Although the term develops other meanings in later thought, itbecomes a feature of the process of perception. Killingley notes its Vedic usage: In Vedic thought, however, the term implies an element of intention; it isa function of the mind which directs a person towards a goal, and givespurpose to action.50So, we can see here an explicit retention of the notion of desire as creative andpowerful. Chapple, in seeking to understand the nature of creativity in Hinduism,recognises the importance of the passage cited above. Discussing ChandogyaUpanisad8.2 as a whole, he claims:the eighth chapter asserts, desire for the true self is higher than pursuingworldly things. The text states that by the mere power of conception(saÅkalpa) the desired result is obtained.51DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION59"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"So, desire can give us what we want through the very wanting itself! Chapple andthe text point out, though, that this is a lowly goal in spiritual terms. The only truedesire, the only one that brings lasting satisfaction is the desire for the Self.However, this does reinforce the notion of desire as creative that began at &g Veda10.129.4, as Killingley writes:kama is not merely a mental state, but a power which can subdue rivalsor even create the cosmos.52We can see this power of desire and its role in creation echoing some of the Vedicpassages mentioned earlier in an Upanisadic passage which place desire withinthe mechanics of an account of the creative process. In Brhad-arajyakaUpanisad1.2, we find a version of creation that has death as creator, death beingassociated with hunger:53In the beginning there was nothing here at all. Death alone covered thiscompletely, as did hunger; for what is hunger but death? Then deathmade up his mind: ‘Let me equip myself with a body.’54If we see death as hunger, we can see death as satisfying itself (as hunger) in theact of creation. In this account, death wishes for a body, and uses desire as themeans of a sacrificial-ritual process, which becomes associated with the Vedichorse sacrifice. Through Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad1.2.4–7 we repeatedly findthe phrase ‘Then death had this desire’,55followed by complex ritual imageryleading to the satisfaction of death’s desire and the unfolding of the creativeprocess. Desire here is the fuel driving the engine of creation.Why death is described here as hunger is not obvious. One might argue thatboth are characterised by absence.56What is death but a lack of life, an absenceof the vitality of the living; and what is hunger but lack of food (or whatever thehunger is for). Here we find hunger satisfied through creation, and death becomesthat with a body in a world of life; the lack leads to a desire for fulfilment, to havethe absence filled; in turn this desire leads to the cessation of the lack via both ritualand the desire itself. Like saÅkalpain a Vedic ritual, the desires of death driveforward the process, want being the source of its ending. Chapple recognises therole of desire in creative processes in Hinduism. He writes of the creative processin the Upanisads:However, powers of Prajapati are universal human abilities manifestedthrough desire and the fulfilment of desire through intentional acts. Thecreative process is engaged through sacrifice. Desire and tapasallowPrajapati to create; these allow humans to bring forth desired realms.57Desire makes the world – for gods in the grand creative process, and for humans insacrificial rituals, and maybe even in the construction of our mundane experience.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION60"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"While this is by no means a coherent message, desire is almost always seen asa force, a thing of great power. In this light perhaps we should see many of thewarnings about desire as arising out of a belief that it is too dangerous for humansto mess with. This idea is that gods may create with the tool of desire, but shouldhumans seek to wield this power for their own ends, it may overcome them andachieve ends other than those they seek.58Once we move into looking at a wider – and later – range of Upanisadic material,we begin to see desire discussed at much greater length. We also find emergingmore clearly the idea of desire as an obstacle to religious life and spiritual progress.In a passage at Chandogya Upanisad4.10.34.10, we see the potential of desire tobe hazardous. The student Upakosala Kamalayana is abandoned by SatyakamaJabala, his teacher, and he expresses his concerns over his desires:His teacher’s wife told him: ‘Come on student, eat. Why have youstopped eating?’ He told her: ‘The desires that lurk within this man aremany and bring various dangers. I am overwhelmed by affliction, and Iwill not eat.’59In the absence of his teacher, the sacrificial fires he has tended teach him thenature of Brahman– freeing him of his affliction. Desire here is clearly flaggedas a sign of unrest internally, carrying danger and worry for the desirer.If we look to Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad6.1.4 we see how desire is used ina conventional sense, as we noted with regard to many Vedic texts – withoutcondemnation. Here ritual knowledge is of pragmatic use:When a man knows this [the correspondence is hearing], whatever hedesires is fulfilled for him.60Indeed we find a specific ritual at Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad6.3.1 for removal ofobstacles to the fulfilment of desire. After ritual preparations, ghee should bepoured into the sacrificial fire with the words:Those stumbling-blocks within you, O Fire,The gods who frustrate man’s desires;I offer a share to them!May they be satisfied!May they satisfy my every desire!Svaha!61InChandogya Upanisad1.1.8, we have a similar message, albeit caught up incomplex imagery around OÅ, where the chanting of the sacred syllable is themeans of desire’s fulfilment:So, when someone knows this62and venerates the High Chant as thissyllable, he will surely become a man who satisfies desire.63DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION61"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Later, at Chandogya Upanisad1.7.9, we find again ritual as the means tosatisfaction, although here the way to getting what you want is via singing theSamanchant. In the Majdukya Upanisad(at 1.9), the technical discussion of OÅtells us that knowledge of it leads to the satisfaction of desires:Anyone who knows this [that OÅis the atman] is sure to obtain all hisdesires.64TheMaitri Upanisad(at 6.4) reinforces this view regarding the efficacy of OÅasa satisfier of desires:Surely this syllable is holy,Surely this syllable is all-high,Whoso shall know this syllable,What he desires65is his!66Not only do we find here the use of OÅas a means to satisfying desire, but alsothe connection between desire and knowledge. Satisfaction of desires is oftenassociated, in the Upanisads, with knowledge.67Most commonly, as at TaittriyaUpanisad2.1.1, it is associated with knowledge of Brahman:A man who knows brahmanobtains the highest there is. On this we have thefollowing verse:68Truth and knowledge,Th’infinite and brahman-A man who knows them ashidden in the deepest cavity,hidden in the highest heaven;Attains all his desires,Together with the wise brahman.69Here the attainer of knowledge of Brahmanwill attain his desires. We see in theseverses the lingering ritual-like belief in religion as the means to obtaining thegoals of our desires. However the line taken on desire is not always clear, as atBrhad-arajyaka Upanisad1.4.17:In the beginning this world was only the self, only one. He had thisdesire: ‘I wish I had a wife so that I could father offspring. I wish I hadwealth so I could perform rites.’ That is the full extent of desire; one doesnot get anything more, even if one desires it.70This is interesting, if obscure – it is not wholly clear what is meant here by thefull extent of desire; maybe that all sub-desires are only forms of these basicdesires.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION62"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Again, at Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad3.2, there is a section regarding the‘grasper’ and the ‘overgrasper’ that is far from clear, and while desire is mentioned,the meaning is not clear. It precedes the famous discussion of karma(action), buthow it leads to this important discussion is not clear. It seems to be exploring therelation between sensation and the senses, although it goes a little beyond this. Itis notable that desire is seen here as a feature of mind, listed with mind as one ofthe eight ‘graspers and overgraspers’ (3.2.7).The mind is a grasper, which is itself grasped by desire, the overgrasper;for one entertains desires by means of the mind.71Elsewhere in the Brhad-arajyaka Upanisadthere is a clearer line, placing desirein a more familiar role (3.5.1):The Brahmajas, having known that self, having overcome the desire72for sons, the desire for wealth, the desire for worlds, live the life ofmendicants.73Here desire is viewed as something to be overcome – as an obstacle. We also findonce more knowledge as a basis for the overcoming of desire. Knowledge of theSelf is the end of desire – perhaps in both the sense of the destruction of desireand the proper goal thereof. We also see an interesting object of desire mentionedin this passage – the desire for worlds. This may refer to desires regarding lifebeyond death, such as the world of the fathers. We see the same list of desires atBrhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.4.22, and see it again as in tension with properdesire – that is desire for the Self:It is when they desire74him [the Self ] as their world that wanderingascetics undertake the ascetic life of wandering.It was when they knew this that men of old did not desire75offspring,reasoning: ‘Ours is this self, and it is our world. What then is the use ofoffspring for us?’ So they gave up the desire for sons, the desire for wealth,and the desire for worlds, and undertook the mendicant life. The desire forsons, after all, is the same as the desire for wealth, and the desire for wealthis the same as the desire for worlds – both are simply desires.76This treats all desire as the same – but surely it must except desire for the Selfas somewhat different? It may imply this, but it is not made clear, and the notionof all desire as essentially the same is not developed any further. Brhad-arajyakaUpanisad4.4.7 further illustrates the theme on the undesirability of desire(as it were):When all desires that dwell in the heart are cast away, then does the mortalbecome immortal, then he attains Brahmanhere.77DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION63"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"While this passage does recommend the overcoming of desire, it is pre-fixed byone which, at Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.4.5–6, still recognises the power ofdesire found in the Vedas. For his act follows his desire, and his act leads, throughmeans such as karmato the goal of that desire:A man resolves in accordance with desire, acts in accordance with hisresolve, and turns out to be in accordance with his action. On this pointthere is the following verse:A man who’s attached goes with his action,To that very place whichHis mind and character cling78Commenting on this passage, Chapple recognises the power of desire. Desire hereis creative in the sense of being the maker of the world-as-we-experience-it: One’s desires lead to the desired world; though deceptively simple, thisinsight into karma shows that one’s mind actively structures the worldthat is experienced.79While the Kant-like second point Chapple makes is surely uncontentious, what issignificant is the key role desire is ascribed in this process of world-constructionthat our mind carries out. As for the devas of the Vedas, so for us all – desire isthe maker of worlds.Now we shall return to the notion of desire as something to be left behind – andBrhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.4.5–7 would have us leave it behind. It must be leftbehind as the worlds made by desire are ones such as this one, worlds of miseryand frustration. We find an even stronger illustration of the need to overcomedesire in the Taittiriya Upanisad. Here the lack of desire is associated closely withhappiness. In a discussion of bliss, various heavenly beings (such as theGandharvas80) are compared to one free from desire. The one who has no desireis superior in bliss. The passage is formulaic, and each successive level of bliss istranscended by the one free from desire. For example:A single measure of the bliss that Indra enjoys – and also a man versed inthe Vedas and free from desire – is a hundred times greater than the bliss ofthe gods.81InFakkaracarya’s commentary on this passage we see reinforced the notion of theabandoning of desire as a means of spiritual progress:desirelessness has been treated distinctively in order to point out thatincrease of bliss is independent of the superiority or inferiority of objects.Thus since happiness is seen to improve a hundredfold proportionately withthe advance of desirelessness, it is treated here with a view to enjoiningdispassionateness as a means for the attainment of supreme bliss.82DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION64"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"This is in line with the fact that we also, in the Upanisads, find the idea that theabandoning or overcoming of desire is salvific or liberating, such as at MaitriUpanisad6.30:Desirelessness83is like the best selection from the best treasury. For theman who is made of all desires, who is marked by resolve, intention,and self-conceit, is bound.84One who is then, opposite of that isreleased.85Again, at Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.4.6, we find the absence of desire as themeans to religious salvation:But the man who does not desire, he who is without desire, who is freedfrom desire, whose desire is satisfied, whose desire is the self; hisbreaths do not depart. Being Brahmanhe goes to Brahman.Given that desire is creative and powerful, why should we leave it behind, ratherthan use it as a means to obtain salvation? Because salvation is related, as noted,to establishing – or knowing – unity of the Self and the One, while desire isa force of division rather than unity, as Killingley notes:Desire, as we have seen, belongs to the world of multiplicity, whichis time-bound and unstable. While Vedic cosmogony begins with aprimordial unity, which is prompted by kama to become many, the wayto salvation lies in the opposite direction: from multiplicity to unitythrough the abandonment of kama.86Note also that in the passage above (Brhad-arajyaka Upanisad4.4.6) we have theidea of the lack of desire due not to desire’s being extinguished, but to its beingsatisfied. This is a theme which we see developed throughout the Upanisadicmaterial, remaining a live issue beyond the time of the Bhagavad Gita’scompo-sition, indeed to the present day. Whether to redirect or remove desire – thisquestion haunts Indian thought, not always visible, but present. Much of the con-fusion over Buddhist accounts of desire can be traced to a failure to realise thesignificance of this question.87I want, now, to return to the notion of knowledge as liberating. This is a threadrunning through the Upanisads. In fact, the whole of the fifth Brahmajaof theBrhad-arajyaka Upanisadis concerned with renunciation as a means to knowl-edge of Brahman. This view is also found in later Hindu literature, as in a versefrom the Mahabharata(12.174.37):The gods consider him to be a knower of Brahmanwho has no desires,who undertakes no work, who does not bow (to others) or praise(any one), who remains unchanged, whose work is exhausted.88DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION65"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Here knowledge is closely linked to the absence of desire. In the last chapter wesaw absence, or lack, as the basis of how much desire was understood. Furthercomparative analysis is to be found in Chapter 5, but it is appropriate to ask herewhether Hinduism takes the same view. It would seem that the answer to this maydepend on whether we are discussing desire for worldly objects, or the desire forthe Self. One might suggest that desire for things other than the Self relates tolack, while desire for the Self is desire for something that you cannot lack. Inknowing the Self, all other desires are both quietened and revealed as futile.If we wish to see a view of desire as without lack, perhaps one can get the bestsense of it from a Chandogya Upanisadverse at 3.14.2–3, where the Self, theatman, is seen as containing all desire89– and the atmanis surely without lack,for it is complete:This self (atman) of mine that lies deep within my heart – it is made ofmind; the vital functions are its physical form; luminous is its appearance;the real is its intention; space is its essence; it contains all actions, alldesires, all smells, and all tastes; it has captured this whole world.90Perhaps what is problematic for us as humans is our lack of knowledge of our ownlack of lack! If we do have an unshakeable atmanwhich is complete, we need noth-ing. Our ignorance of this though may be seen as the root of our seeking the fulfil-ment of desire elsewhere – inevitably leading to frustration and unhappiness. In onesense, satisfaction can be sought anywhere – due to the pervasive nature of Brahman–Atman– but this is not, as a rule, what we are doing when we desire things in theoutside world – for what we desire is usually part of maya, or transient and thereforeunfulfilling. Still looking outwards, the most obvious form in which we may find thisultimate is in God – particularly in a transcendent sense; but many traditions withinHinduism do venerate components of the natural world as containing the ultimateBrahman– tending towards divinity as immanent. However, for the composers of theUpanisads, the most accessible form of it is that within us – the Self.So, the Self is the key to fulfilment. Certainly, it is one route, the Upanisadspropose, to the sating of our desire. This is made clear throughout the ChandogyaUpanisad. At 8.7.3 the quest for the Self is described, as are the features of thatsought:The self that is free from evils, free from old age and death, free fromsorrow, free from hunger and thirst; the self whose desires and intentions91are real – that is the self that you should try to discover, that is the selfthat you should seek to perceive. When someone discovers that self andperceives it, he obtains all the worlds, and all his desires are fulfilled.92What distinguishes this verse from the one quoted next is the reference to thedesires of the Self itself. That the desires of the Self are ‘real’ is intriguing. Arewe to read this as asserting that the Self has appropriate desire? Maybe, but as weDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION66"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"have seen appropriate desire is desire for the Self – or Brahman93– so is this theSelf desiring itself? While this is opaque here, we can see how whatever way it isthat the Self desires, it is in a way that lies beyond our mundane desiring. Onemight speculate94that this is a means of entrapping desire, of holding it captivewithin the ultimate. The desire for the Self, within the Self, is of necessity per-manently fulfilled. In this circle of Self-satisfaction, there is no room for desireas the upsetter; it has been placed where it can do no harm. However, as men-tioned shortly, the Self is also described in terms of being free from desire, whichme might choose to read as free from worldly or dangerous inappropriate desire –indeed to comply with our previous terminology we might call this being freefrom desire for anything beyond the One, for multiplicity.It is in this context that we should read the passages at Chandogya Upanisad8.12.6 where we see again the Self as the means of desire’s fulfilment – and forgods as well as humans:It is this self that the gods venerate, as a result of which they haveobtained all the worlds and have had all their desires fulfilled. Likewise,when someone discovers this self and comes to perceive it, he will obtainall the worlds and have all his desires fulfilled.95The Self, the focus for much Upanisadic material, is not only the means to fulfildesire and the proper object of desire, it is also – at least in some passages – freefrom desire itself, as Maitri Upanisad2.7 illustrates:He is indeed the pure, the stable, the unmoved, the unaffected, unflurried,free from desire,96standing still like a spectator, self-subsistent.97The contrast with Chandogya Upanisad8.7.3 (above) is noteworthy, for here theSelf is described as being free from desire. When listing all the qualities of theSelf (in a slightly personified form), we get a reference to desire in the context ofequanimity – a notion which comes to prominence later in Hinduism, as well ashaving a key role to play in Buddhist thought.And if the Self is the same as the ultimate Brahman, it is no surprise to findpassages where it is in Brahmanmanifested as God that we find the fulfilment ofdesires. The Fvetafvatara Upanisadis described by Olivelle as a:somewhat late text composed under the influence of both the SaÅkhya-Yoga tradition and the emerging theistic tendencies.98Given this, it makes sense that here it is God who provides the focus ofknowledge and fulfilment:When one has known God, all the fetters fall off; by the eradication ofthe blemishes, birth and death come to an end; by meditating on him,DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION67"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"one obtains, at the dissolution of the body, a third – sovereignty over all;and in the absolute one’s desires are fulfilled.99Despite the shift to a more theistic tone, the theme is still of the fulfilment ofdesire. This fulfilment is, though, throughout the Upanisads as we have seen,associated with freedom from desire. It is a type of desire which finds its fulfil-ment due to its particular nature as having the right object. In Chapter 3, lookingat Buddhism we will ask if there is more to appropriate desires than their pos-sessing the appropriate object, but this distinction is largely absent or ambiguousin the Vedic and Upanisadic passages I have looked at here.A passage which shows this ambiguity is in the Mujdaka Upanisadat 3.2.2,where the transcending of the world of desires and rebirth is via the fulfilment ofdesire:One who hankers100after desires in his thoughts,is born here and there through his actions.But when one’s desires are fulfilled,and one’s self is made perfect,all his desires disappear in this very world.101Here we see that appropriate desire causes inappropriate desire to evaporate, butthere is no conscious effort to develop a systematic typology of desire. One pointat which we do find a clarification of what is meant by being ‘desireless’ is inFakkaracarya’s commentary to the Katha Upanisad:A desireless man, i.e. one whose intellect has been withdrawn from allouter objects, seen or unseen.102Here we might claim a distinction between negative desires (external ones) atleast in terms of their object, and desire for the Self (the appropriate object ofdesire, especially for a Vedantin such as Fakkaracarya) (internal desire). This is arather crude approach though, and is problematised by the claim that thesubject/object distinction is a feature of mayaand that the goal of the yoginis therealisation of the ground of the inner and ground of the outer as identical, ofatmanasBrahman!103It is a systematic typology of desire, clearly lacking inUpanisadic texts, that I will suggest is, in the next chapter, a Buddhist innovation.What the Vedadoes see, and what is still present in much of the Upanisadsbefore seeming to be partly subsumed by a suspicion of desire, is the power ofdesire. Not only the metaphysical creativity of desire in the hands of the devas,but the power of desire to announce possibilities in the human realm, in thekama-loka. We saw desire as the maker of the world, from how intention causesits own satisfaction, to how desire drives the spiritual and worldly aspects of lifefor us all.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION68"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"What we have seen in the early Vedic literature is a less cautious and moreimperative sense of desire. Desire is indeed a power, a danger. So much so that inhuman hands it requires significant regulation. One might argue that for many ofthe Vedic texts, what is required is not the total removal of desire, but correctdesire. This might be characterised as the realisation that we are not in lack, butthat the true desire is the re-integrating desire for the Self. As we moved throughUpanisadic literature there began to be more common the view that desire issomething to be removed, transcended and possibly even destroyed. Elements ofthe Vedic view remain, but the overall picture is far from clear and poses as manyquestions as it answers.If one compares the Upanisads with the literature of early Buddhism, it wouldseem apparent that the Buddhist approach is significantly more psychological inits treatment of phenomena such as desire. The next two chapters will demonstratethis amply, as the processes of mind and the arising of mind-states are key topicsof extended debate in the Sutta-pitakaas well as in the Abhidhamma-pitaka.However, such analysis is not wholly absent from Hindu thought.In regard to the arising of the mind-state of desire, the Advaita–vedanta thinkerFakkaracarya ascribes to desire the same root condition as many Buddhist texts.In his commentary to the IfaUpanisadhe tells us that the root of desire is avidya:avidya, which is the seed of desire and work, and is blinding by nature104As we shall see in the Chapters 3 and 4, the notion of avidyaplays an importantrole in the Buddhist understanding of the conditions of desire, and indeed exis-tence itself. The SED describes avidyaas ‘ignorance, spiritual ignorance’105– butnotes that in Vedanta philosophy it can also have the sense of ‘illusion (personi-fied as Maya)’.106AlthoughFakkaracarya is a Vedantin, he could here be usingavidyain both senses, for the world experienced as mayais the same – at least forus as experiencers of the world – as spiritual ignorance. Being subject (or indeed,self-subjected) to mayais to be ignorant of how things reallyare.This view of desire as being rooted in ignorance is well fitted to the Vedantinstress on knowledge as a means to liberation. Indeed, it fits equally well with theUpanisads as discussed here. While the Upanisads do not make this explicit,Fakkaracarya’s claim is compatible with them. We shall see in Chapters 3 and 4just how significant it is for a religious outlook if we ascribe the cause of much(maybe most, maybe even all) of our sorrows (and desire) to ignorance, or lack ofspiritual insight.While insight becomes a core value in early Buddhism,107the stress onknowledge as salvific in Hinduism might be argued to be – at least for a while –eclipsed by the success of the bhaktitraditions, emerging in late Upanisads andpopularised by the Bhagavad Gita.In this examination of the Upanisads, there have emerged tensions between theabandonment of desire and the Vedic model of it as creative. The way that &g VedaDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION69"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"10.129.4 describes desire is clearly creative. Nicholas Lash cites R. Panikkar(who here translates kamaas ‘love’) in this passage:Primordial love is neither a transitive nor an intransitive act...it is theconstitutive act by which existence came into being. Without love thereis no being.108Lash also quotes A. de Nicholas’ book on the Gitawherein he claims:Desire is the fountain of creation in Indian philosophy from the &g Vedathrough the Upanisads to the Gita.109While the Upanisads do indeed not deny the creative force of desire, it doesbecome a less common motif as we move away from the Vedas, through theUpanisads and towards the Gita.We might then view the Upanisads as a period of complex transition and slowevolution of the notion of desire. Old meanings are not denied or ignored, but a newfocus on either denying desire or re-orientating it comes to the fore. Whether theseare the same thing, compatible or in tension is not wholly clear. It is with this in mindthat we must turn to a text renowned for its treatment of desire: the Bhagavad Gita.Desire in the Bhagavad GitaTheGita110has many themes, but desire lies at the heart of them. DermotKillingley makes clear the centrality of desire to the Gita:TheBhagavadgitaabounds in words for desire, pleasure, enjoyment,wish, will, attachment, longing and love. Some of these words, such aslobha(‘greed’), have moral connotations, but most of them are morallyneutral. Passages referring to the opposite of desire – hatred or disgust –are also relevant; so are those on equanimity or indifference (samatva,samya). This is one of the recurrent topics of the poem.111Clearly there is much in the Gitaregarding desire; indeed Killingley goes as faras claiming that it dominates ‘the narrative frame of the poem’.112Further thanthis, the Gitaseeks to place desire in an ethical context.Many might suggest that ‘desireless action’ is the key message of the Gita, butthere is clearly more to it than this. Desire has been developed as a conceptthroughout the Vedic–Upanisadic literature. However, the question that Lipnerposes above is not answered in that literature. At times there is a suggestion thatthe problem with desire is in its misapplication. That is, that we must point ourwanting inwards to the atman– or in more theistic strands to God – and not atworldly objects. As we have seen, some of the passages quoted do seem to hint ata qualitative distinction between desires for worldly things, and desires of areligious nature, but it remains implicit. This leaves it as an open question for theDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION70"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Gita. I am grateful for Nicholas Lash’s ‘The Purification of Desire’ in which heexplores this theme which has been lurking throughout all of this chapter so far,as well as haunting much Christian thought on desire:When as a Christian Theologian, I read the Gita, I recognise, in itstreatment of desire, an ambivalence that I have met elsewhere: anambivalence as to whether the peace at which our hearts are set fulfilsdesire or springs from its suppression.113Before looking at the extent to which the Gitacan offer an answer to Lash’s ques-tion, I wish to return to Killingley’s claim that the narrative of the Gitais framedby desire. From the outset it is clear that the narrative setting is one of conflictingdesires. Arjuna is in a dilemma, drawn between two incompatible desires. Hewishes for victory – the battle is at hand which will provide both the quashing ofthe unjust and the fulfilment of his dharmaas a ksatriya. Initially he seems keenenough on the task at hand. At 1.20–22:Then (Arjuna) whose banner is an ape,Gazed upon the serried ranksOf Dhritarashtra’s sons. The clash of armsBegan. He lifted up his bow.To Krishna thenThese words he spake:‘Halt thou my chariot [here]Between the armies twainThat I may see these men drawn up,Spoiling for the fight,[That I may see] with whom I must do battleIn this enterprise of war.114There appears little reticence as yet here. But it is not long before his famousdoubts emerge. Arjuna’s wish for victory comes up against the obstacle of his con-science. From 1.28 to 1.46 Arjuna is aghast at what he is about to do, till at 1.47:So saying Arjuna sat downUpon the chariot-seat [though] battle [had begun],Let slip his bow and arrows,His mind distraught with grief.115But he stays. Arjuna does not flee the scene. He is clearly unsure, as at 2.7 wherehe says to Krsja:With my mind perplexed concerning right and wrong (dharma) [I turn] to thee and ask:Which is the better course?116DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION71"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"So, desire is at the fore as a source of conflict from the outset. Of course, this isnot the most famous element of desire. Most accounts of the Gitasee as its keytheme that of desireless action. This is the famed reconciliation of renunciationanddharma. The renunciant tradition can be seen as in conflict with the alterna-tive ideal of the duties of family life and the carrying out of dharma, especiallythe householder aframa. The Gitashows a middle-way (another one!), a meansto conflate these two ideals. Killingley makes the remarkable point that the phraseniskama-karma(desireless action) is one which:does not occur in the Gita, but which sums up an important part of itsteaching.117This middle-way can be seen by both a rejection of desire and a legitimisation ofit, in the Gita. On one hand much of the text would steer us away from desire,indeed Killingley claims that:Perhaps the most common occurrence of desire in the Bhagavadgitaisin the form of something to avoid.118This forms a key part of the ideas in the text – while we cannot avoid action, wecan avoid desire. As we have seen in other Hindu texts, this rejection of desireseems counterbalanced by ideas of correct or appropriate desire.119As Killingleycomments:theBhagavadgitaalso presents a positive aspect to desire which contrastswith this ideal of desirelessness.120Beyond the ideas of ‘right desire’ there are other ways in which we might seedesire in the dialogue of the Gita. An alternative take on desire in the Gitaisdiscussed by John Brockington, who describes a somewhat more sceptical inter-pretation one might place on Krsja’s motives. Krsja has pragmatic desires – hewishes Arjuna to act (presumably in the battle at hand, but also to encourageaction in general) and his dialogue conceals this pragmatism:When Krishna tells Arjuna to act without desire for the fruits of hisactions, he has base desires of his own in championing the self-interestof the gods.121Clearly, this is a rather heterodox reading, but it should alert us to the way godsare represented in much Hindu thought. While supposedly aloof and beyonddesire, they often act to achieve their own specific ends. An orthodox Brahminmight be tempted to ask – like Plato’s call for the ejection of the artist from theideal state in The Republic– for a censoring of the devas’ personal and pettysquabbling from the epics, but I have never encountered such a call.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION72"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"We have seen that the Gitaoffers what seems to be a mixed message aboutdesire. Let us see how another writer’s approach addresses the question of desire-lessness. The interpretation of the Gitaas offering a model of desireless action isoffered, and described clearly, by Madeleine Biardeau:Although it draws the attention of its devotees back towards this world,bhakti does not jettison the Upanisadic renouncer’s analysis of desire as themotivating force behind human acts; however, its conclusions run in theopposite direction. If, in the act, it is desire which is bad and alienating,then it is desire which must be suppressed rather than the act.122Furthermore, her view – expressed at the outset of this chapter that all action derivesfrom desire – may cause her a problem given the way she views desireless action:The problem is clearly that of knowing whether there is any furtherreason to act once there is no more desire. The anthropology from whichwe started provides only a negative answer, since all human activity hasbeen placed under the sign of kama.123Is ‘desireless action’ not a contradictory notion in the context of this assertion?She does realise this, and offers an analysis of desire in the Gitato try and resolveit. The approach she takes is one we saw foreshadowed in Upanisadic texts. It isalso a response which answers Lash’s question of whether to fulfil or suppress.Desire is not to be absolutely annihilated, but rather it must be redirected. As wewould expect in the considerably more theistic (than the Upanisads) text of theGita, the redirection is towards God – towards the object of bhakti– Krsja.124In many ways, then, we can see the Gitaas concerned with the purification ofdesire. While the notion of desireless action (if not the phrase) is present, we cansee this as simultaneously encapsulating the idea that desires should be focused per-petually on God, and on acting in accordance with dharma. This notion seems cap-tured well by some rather Nietzsche-like lines from T. S. Eliot, where ‘The Rock’proclaims:I say to you: Make perfect your will.I say: take no thought of the harvest,But only of proper sowing.125The aforementioned theistic desire should, for the bhakta, supersede and transcendall other desire. As Biardeau suggests:God, in making himself accessible to his worshipper and granting himhis grace, becomes the object of the supreme desire, the one whichsuppresses all other desires. So it is impossible to explain the teachingof the Gitaon activity without desire without this precondition of atransfer of man’s whole capacity for desire onto God.126DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION73"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"However, this does not wholly resolve the ambiguities of the Gitatowards desire.While some verses might seem to support this view, such as 7.11:Power in the powerful I, –[Such power] as knows nor passion nor desire:Desire am I in contingent beings,[But such desire as is] not at war with right (dharma).127Even here the second line is ambiguous – and are those in whom Krsja is ‘power’not contingent beings? It would seem that we have a view of Krsja as a primevalforce within us – almost, maybe, an animating principle.Either way, the second half of the verse does seem to support the idea of anappropriate, modified, maybe even purified desire. Elsewhere however we stillfind what looks like an unambivalent condemnation of desire, with none of thenuances of redirection found elsewhere. Verses 3.37 to 3.43 read like a battle-callagainst desire. At 3.37 Krishna says of desire: ‘know this to be thine enemy onearth’128and at 3.39:This is the wise man’s eternal foe;By this is wisdom overcast:Whatever form it will it takes, –A fire insatiate!129Strong words. We might be tempted to claim that it is only inappropriate desirethat here is being condemned – that of course none of this would apply to thedesire for Krsja, but if this is meant it is not made clear. Furthermore, at 3.43the devotee is encouraged to obtain self-knowledge (knowledge of the atman–liberating knowledge) and knowledge of God as a means of vanquishing desire.Still discussing desire, Krsja tells Arjuna (and by extension us all):Know him who is yet higher than the soul;And of thyself make firm [this] self.Vanquish the enemy, Arjuna![Swift is he] to change his form,And hard is he to conquer!130What the devotee here is not asked to do is to redirect desire. Vanquishing desireseems some way from its purification.131One may argue that the Gitaachievesits aim of reconciling the renouncer and the householder, but this is a tension alsoborn out of a concern with desire. As Biardeau notes, when comparing the casteHindu (living out their dharma) with the sannyasin(seekingmoksa):For the man encumbered with desires, the renouncer is a ‘free’ man, whohas cast off his bonds but who pays sufficiently dearly for that freedomDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION74"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"to consider it superior132and inimitable; for the ascetic, the man livingin his caste thinks only of satisfying his desires and prepares only painfor himself.133One may argue that the offered solution of ‘desireless action’ is successful only ifthe nature and status of desire is fully resolved in the Gita, which it arguably is not.A commentator on the Gitawho believes that desirelessness is impossible isAurobindo Ghose. Aurobindo has his own motives in his interpretation of theGita, much of his own thought revolving round a doctrine which a theologianmight describe as ‘salvation through works’. His rejection of the Advaita viewwas part of his belief that one should not withdraw, but seek spiritual goals inthe world not apart from it. Yvonne Williams, writing on Aurobindo’s view of theGita, summarises his position:His conclusion is that...there is obviously no such thing as actionwithout desire:For what we call ordinarily disinterested action is not really desireless;it is simply a replacement of certain smaller personal interests byother larger desires.134He therefore proposes that the greatest of desires is to do work ‘for thesake of divine’.135Here we find a view of ‘supposed desirelessness’ as the reorientation of desire.While we might not wish to concur wholly with Aurobindo’s view, this does rep-resent a strategy for escaping the tensions surrounding desire. However, to do sois – especially in the way Aurobindo expresses it – to retain or return to a stratifiedand hierarchical notion of desire, the debate returning to one concerning whichdesires are better than others. This seems to ignore much Hindu thought, whichrecognises the complex and psycho-spiritually problematic nature of desire.Killingley takes a similar approach to Aurobindo, but feels that we are notarguing over which is the best object of desire, but rather replacing one motiva-tionwith another. We still act, but in the absence of desire act from other causes:This resolution of the problem of desire is made possible by the devotional theology of the Bhagavadgita, in which the devotee has a per-sonal relationship with God which provides him with a motivation foraction which does not depend on his own desires. The same theologysolves the problem of God’s motivation: he acts for the maintenance ofthe world, to restore dharma, or to return the love of his devotees, but notout of desire,136since he has no needs of his own.137This attempted resolution is clearer, but resolves desire only if we accept religiousdevotion as possible in the absence of desire. Religious devotion seems full oflonging, even passion, for the divine, but if we categorise these as not beingDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION75"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"desire, we are again working with an implied typology of wanting that is not fullydeveloped or made explicit. It would seem that the bhaktadoes desire God,indeed should desire God – and as fervently as possible. While, then, the Gitaputs a strong case for bhaktias the most practical and effective means of religioussalvation, it leaves many of the tensions regarding desire that it inherits fromUpanisadic literature unresolved.Sex, love and desire: the Kama SutraIf desire for the Self (in the sense of the atman) is a means of moving awayfrom mundane and harmful desires, it is not the only one. Whereas in many casessensual desires are thought of as the very antithesis of the spiritual, and amongst themost important and difficult class of desires to be abandoned,138in Hindu thought weoften find notable exceptions. Hinduism (albeit often through lascivious appreciationof the Kama Sutra) is renowned for its interest in both the romantic and the erotic.Be it erotic temple carvings, or the mischievous Krsja of the Purajas’ relations withthegopis, Hinduism at times seems to overflow with a superfluity of sensuality.However, before we become too immersed in rescuing sexual desire as legitimate, wemust be aware that sexual desire is often something one is warned against. At MaitriUpanisad6.10, we find sensual pleasures as something to be resisted:Now, like the man in an empty room who does not touch the sexy womenwhen they come in, someone who does not touch sense-objects whenthey come in is a renouncer, a yogin, a sacrificer to the self.139If we wish to, for now at least, put to one side these worries, and the concernsof conservative Brahminorthodoxy over such material, how are we to reconcile thiswith what has been said regarding the undesirability of desire – particularly sensuallonging? One approach is to suggest that in love for another, one suppresses one’sSelf (in the sense of ‘selfish’ rather then atman). Love can be selfless, releasing inus a potential for altruism that we may not have even known existed.If we consider the efforts of both the sannyasinand the bhakta, how canromantic love relate to either? Clearly, as we shall see later in this chapter, thereis the compulsion to seek kamain the householder aframa, but this is love ascompatible with a life in accordance with dharma, not necessarily a means ofspiritual progress. So, can love ever be more than just compatible with thespiritual life? Biardeau makes a strong case for it. To do so, she locates acommonality in the quest of the sannyasinand the bhakta, for both:seek salvation in an exit from the self, in an extension of the atmanbeyond the bounds of the empirical ‘ego’.140This may provide a framework for understanding how romantic or amorous desiremight be legitimised. Of course, we need to exercise caution here for much ofDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION76"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"what may be described as ‘love’ may prove to be of a selfish nature – the desireto possess another, to dominate them, or possibly some kind of infatuation. Lovehere though is what takes us beyond ourselves, makes us forget ourselves.Biardeau allows for the possibility of such an emotion:desire, in the particular form of amorous desire, was not necessarilyof the ego. Whereas, in ‘moralizing’141literature, human love is oftencontrasted with renunciation as its main enemy, erotic experience,essentially shared physical pleasure, is analyzed as an experience of self-dispossession. And this dispossession is immediately associatedwith that achieved through yogic concentration; it is the analogue of thereligious experience pursued by the renouncer.142Here we see a noble vision of love. This is not the sickly-sweet affected-affectionof the greeting-card poet, nor is it the brutal drive for self-gratification of thesexual egotist. In relation to the questions set out in the introduction to this chap-ter, we can see that we now have suggested – in this type of feeling – the possi-bility of a true modification of desire. It may seem odd to describe the eroticgymnastics of parts of the Kama Sutraas part of a purification of desire.Nonetheless, if understood and practised in a holistic context, as part of this self-forgetting desire, there is no reason why love (inclusive of romantic and eroticdesire, as well as the fulfilment of these desires) cannot prove to be an effective(and satisfying, in more than one sense) means of making progress on the pathto religious goals.We do though need to make a number of distinctions when making claimsabout the methodology and theoretical frameworks of the harnessing of roman-tic and sexual desire within Hinduism. This section began by seeking to addressa common aspect in the goal of the sannyasinand the bhakta. While both maybe seeking to transcend or suppress the ‘ego-self ’, key differences still existbetween them.143The overwhelming desire and love for God sought in bhaktiseems qualitatively different from the desire for the atmandiscussed earlier inthis chapter.Such practitioners follow different margas. The path of the seeker of the Self isas a follower of jñana-yoga, one yoked to the quest for knowledge of the supremeBrahman. The bhaktaseeks by a different means. The devotee of, for example,Krsjaseeks to stir emotion for the divine. The burning love of the bhaktais fullof passion.144An example of such practices is found in the NaradaBhakti-Sutra.145Here the text puts the bhaktathrough an emotional process likely to lead to statesfar from the inner-silence of the yogin:Krsja should be worshipped in varying degrees of emotional attachment:from perception of the Lord’s majestic glory to experiencing the variousemotions associated with the role of Krsja’s slave, his companion, hisparent and finally his wife.146DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION77"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"These roles suggest a life of desire, of passion – but with the passion being forthe Lord. A jñana-yogafollower, on the other hand, seeks not a clamour of pas-sion, but an inner-silence – something more akin to Buddhist methods. Clarity ofvision necessitates stillness and calm. As an illustration of this, we might look todharaja, the sixth stage of Patañjali’s Eight-Limbed Yoga system. This single-pointed concentration requires the elimination of all churnings of the heart. It canonly be achieved once the body is quietened and the senses withdrawn. By this, Imean that the body must be stilled such that it largely ceases to impinge on themind – and any minor intrusions it may make into our consciousness are foiledby this withdrawal of the senses. This latter process equates to what the BuddhistAbhidhammamight call a ‘shutting of the sense doors’.Further, the mind must achieve sufficient states of calmness. B. K. S. Iyengar,the most influential of modern Yoga teachers – who explicitly models hisapproach on Patañjali’s – describes what is needed to achieve dharaja:The mind has to be stilled in order to achieve this state of completeabsorption.147The last word here is intriguing, for it represents what both methods share – thepursuit of absorption. This is the state whereby the veil of mayafalls away, andwe know nothing but the object, possibly now being even beyond thesubject/object distinction. In this type of yoga,148this may just be the object ofconcentration, but for both the passionate bhaktaand the renunciant seeking theSelf, it is total absorption of consciousness in the object of desire. We can see nowhow a sexual rapture might be analogous to such states, a sense that the rest of theworld has ceased to exist. Likewise, romantic states are renowned for makingmonomaniacs of us all.If we are thinking of the sexual act itself, the clearest connection to the ideasexpressed so far is the goal of ‘union’. The yoginseeks the state of mysticalunion,149thesannyasin– particularly if of an Advaita–vedanta persuasion – seeksthe re-merging of the atmanwithBrahman,150and the bhaktamay wish one-nesswith God (although they do not seek to becomeGod).151So, we find similarities in the quest of the devotee, the sannyasin152and thelover. Hindu thought has developed this spiritual utilisation of sexuality and sen-suality to a significant degree. As Biardeau argues, when comparing ‘the act oflove’ and ‘yogic concentration’,153there is more to it than an evocative analogy: The linkage between the two orders of experience goes much further thanthe search for an expression of mystic union in terms of human love.154Tantric thought makes much of the union of PurusaandPrakrtiand the mannerin which the lover’s path might not just imitate the mystic union, but actuallybecome part of it. The notion of sexual union as a rapture that transports us outDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION78"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"of ourselves, beyond the ego, is not identical with the Tantric approach though.We should not presume the Kama Sutraandtantrato take the same approach justbecause they share the feature of not always disapproving of sexual desire.Given what I have said regarding the spiritual possibilities of sex and love, I nowturn to that well-known Sutra – titled after desire – the Kama Sutra.155While in thecontext of this work kamais predominantly seen as sexual desire, there is also asense in which what is said in the Kama Sutrahas a wider application. The primaryway that we may view this relates to the three goals of life in traditional Hindu views:Kama, in the general sense of ‘pleasure’, appears third in the well-knownlist of purusarthas(aims of man): dharma(righteousness),artha(worldly power, especially wealth), kama, which in this context is usuallytranslated ‘pleasure’.156Vatsyayana is not blind to the dangers of kama, and its relation to the othergoals of life. We find, in the Kama Sutra, an understanding of the integratednature of the three goals:the pleasures of Kama are as essential for the proper maintenance of thehuman body as is food. Moreover, they take their very roots in Dharmaand Artha. Granted, one must, however, acknowledge and be aware of thedangers. Do people refrain from cooking food simply because there arebeggars? Do they not sow seeds of barely in spite of the deer eating theirsprouts?In this way, a man who pursues Dharma, Artha and Kama, experiencesuntrammelled happiness both in this world and in the world to come.157Here we can see how even in a text devoted to kama, it is seen as needing tobe balanced with duty – with other factors. We see this expressed even moreexplicitly at 2.14–7, albeit with some notable exceptions:Dharma is better than Artha and Artha is better than Kama. But thisorder of procedure is not applicable in all cases. With a king, Artha is ofprime importance, since the very livelihood of his subjects depends onit. Similarly Kama comes first with courtesans.158While discussing the Kama Sutra, however, we do need to be aware of the sense inwhich Vatsyayana uses the term kama. He links it explicitly to sensory desire in away distinct from the more general use of the term found so far in this chapter:Kama is the enjoyment of the objects with the help of the five senses –of hearing, of speech, of sight, of taste and of smell, according to thedictates of his mind in consonance with his soul. Actually, Kama is thatspecial pleasure experienced when the sense of touch operates, andDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION79"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"when it is in contact with the object that generates pleasure. Kama is tobe learnt from the Kama Sutra and also from the worldly-wise citizen.159This is a limited view of kama, and the Kama Sutramay also seem equally lim-ited in its concerns. That is not to say, however, that it had nothing to tell us aboutthe nature of desire. Perhaps nowhere else in the whole vast mass of Hindu liter-ature is the ambivalence of Hindu approaches to desire more striking than in theKama Sutra. This text, known primarily for its role as a ‘manual of the arts oflove’, is both about the expression of desire – the giving in to desire – and, at thesame time, about the regulation of desire.In S. C. Upadhyaya’s introduction to his translation of the Kama SutraofVatsyayana, we find this expressed explicitly:This science is mainly concerned with the fulfilment of the desires ofthe flesh. It aims at teaching a person the best method to control andproperly guide the desires, particularly the sexual urge, so that theperson may be an useful member of the family, society and his countryand contribute his mite to their welfare by his way of life.160Here, while desire is allowed, we see the need for control. In the text, mostrenowned for its affirmation of the acceptability of desire, we begin with a con-cern over ‘unregulated desire’. If one is not proficient in the expression of one’sdesire one is in danger! That desire is a force of considerable power is as clearhere as it is in the Vedas and the Upanisads. Indeed, Upadhyaya makes thisconnection when he refers to &g Veda10.129. 1–7161– the sacrifice of the primalpurusa. He draws a conclusion not dissimilar to my own when he claims:The first product of the Mind was Kama, sexual desire, love, the bondbetween the non-existent and existent. As this desire leads to the procre-ation and birth of beings, the Sages considered it as the primal source ofall existence.162This reading attributes to the Vedic passage a sexual sense that was not presentin the interpretation I offered on this, and there seems little reason to castthis sexual aspect onto the quote.163However, in one way there is no reason notto – as sexual desire might be seen as the most obviously creative, the basis ofprocreative acts. Once in the main body of the Kama Sutra, though, we find thatits concerns are predominantly practical. In many ways, it is about the manifes-tations of kamarather than its nature. It is on this basis that I say no more uponit here.Before coming to general conclusions about the Hindu understandings of thenature of desire, I wish to turn to another tradition that draws on a Brahmanicalbackdrop, and also forms part of the intellectual context that informs earlyBuddhism – Jainism.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION80"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Jainism and desire: the calm fight against karmaTo establish the concurrence of Buddhism and Jainism, we do not have to rely onjust the appearance of Nataputta in Canonical Pali texts, for as SurendranathDasgupta points out:The canonical books of the Jains mention as contemporaries ofMahavira the same kings as reigned during the Buddha’s career.164This is not the place to enter into a comparative study of Gotama and Nataputta,but it is perhaps worth noting that Jains see their religion as pre-datingNataputta.165Before we move on to consider its views on desire, a little needs saying on theprimary concerns of the Jain religion. If we wish to get a taste of the Jain religion,we must recall as foremost its concern with asceticism and non-harm. The rigoursof a Jain monk exceed, in most cases, those of Buddhist ones. Often hair maybe plucked from the head, rather than shaved,166and monks’ nightly sleep may belimited to three hours.The determination to avoid the killing of a living being (and therefore theavoidance of the formation of karma-constructions) is an inescapable motifthroughout Jainism. This extends from the monastic duties of inspecting clothesand holding a cloth over the mouth during speech, to the expectations placed uponthe laity:The principle of extreme carefulness not to destroy any living being hasbeen in monastic life carried out to its very last consequences, and hasshaped the conduct of the laity in a great measure. No layman will inten-tionally kill any living being, not even an insect, however troublesome.He will remove it carefully without hurting it.167These practical aspects of Jainism, to users of fly-spray and head-lice killingshampoos, may seem bizarre – but imagine how barbaric and unspeakably vilesuch products must appear to the Jain. Furthermore, Jain practices have to be seenin the context of a world-view, a philosophical setting.Before we look to the justification of non-harm as a principle, we need to workour way up from the philosophical ground. That is, we must examine the onto-logical outlook of Jainism. Jainism derives its ontological viewpoint in much theway that some claim Buddhism tends to, from an enhanced empiricist epistemol-ogy. The enhancement to what is normally considered ‘empiricist’ derives fromwhat a Westerner might call ‘gnosis’, but what we might more cautiously term‘spiritual experience’ or ‘ascetic-meditational experience’.In assessing the nature of the world, Jains seem to go some way along the samepath as early Buddhists in their rejection of Hindu ontology. This is commonamongstframajamovements, but nonetheless significant. The substantialistDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION81"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"view, attributed to much Brahmanic philosophy and cosmology, is rejected, but sois the non-substantiality of the Buddhist anattadoctrine, as Dasgupta comments:They held that is was not true that substance alone was true and qualitieswere mere false and illusory appearances. Further it was not true as theBuddhists said that there was no permanent substance but merely thechange of passing qualities, for both these represent two extreme viewsand are contrary to experience.168Here we again find the discourse of the ‘middle-way’ beyond the borders ofBuddhism. This ontological position169is not straightforward, and I do not intendto even try and give a full account of it here. Change is incorporated in the Jainview, but its relation to that which changes is seen in three ways. During change,some aspects/elements170remain unchanged; other, new qualities come intobeing; and other qualities cease to be – are destroyed. This can be illustrated viathe image of a clay jug and its formation from a lump of clay:Thus when a jug is made, it means that the clay-lump has been destroyed,a jug has been generated and the clay is permanent, i.e. all productionmeans that some old qualities have been lost, some new ones brought in,and there is some part in it which is permanent.171This is not the place to offer a full critique of this position – tempting as it is whenDasgupta describes it as:A reconciliation of the two extremes of Vedantism and Buddhism on thegrounds of common-sense experience.172The Jains develop a complex and often subtle metaphysics on the basis of thisontology, but we must move to one of their more well-known areas to find materialof relevance here – their views on karma.While, as is widely recognised, Buddhism places the generation of karmaveryfirmly in the context of intention,173Jainism often seems more concerned withthe nature of the act itself:According to Jaina teaching it is more the actual process of one’s actionsthan the underlying good or bad will which determines the kind andamount of karmic matter being drawn onto the soul by the respectivedeed.174Here we see an important idea. It does often seem to be true that Jainismprivileges, in the formation of karma, acts over intentions – leading to less of aprime concern with desire. Nonetheless, attachment is still seen as a source ofpotential suffering.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION82"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"In relation to the objects of sense-pleasure, we find Jainism not too far froma Buddhist view. Of ‘Masters’,175Herbert Warren writes:He has no liking (rati) for this, that, or the other thing; that is, materialobjects. He is always in a state of internal bliss whether the object isthere or not. Also, liking an object, a cushiony seat, for instance, wouldbe a source of displeasure at its loss. It is ATTACHMENT to sensationthat is the point here as a failing.176The omniscient Master is also, in Warren’s view, in an interesting state regardingdesire. He claims that: He has perfect control over desires; over any desire to please or indulgethe eye, the ear, taste, touch or smell.177What is intriguing is that such a being still has desires; desires still seem present,or capable of arising, but cause no problem as they are under the control of theMaster. Elsewhere, however, we also find the notion of the spiritually successfulindividual portrayed in contrast to the possession of desire, as in the AcarakgaSutraat 1.2.2:Those who are freed (from attachment to the world and its pleasures),reach the opposite shore. Subduing desire by desirelessness, he does notenjoy the pleasures that offer themselves. Desireless, giving up theworld, and ceasing to act, he knows, and sees, and has no wishes becauseof his discernment; he is called houseless.178This passage not only shows a concern with the ending of desire – but also isintriguing in the context of the preceding Hindu ideas. In contrast to the latercompatiblism of the Gita, the lack of desire is here equated with ‘ceasing to act’.There seems little in Jainism of the idea of ‘desireless action’, as ‘action’ appearsto be as problematic as desire. Nonetheless, we do find desire regularly cast assomething to be avoided within Jain sutras. In the Acarakga Sutra, at 1.6.5, wefind desire as problematic and to be left behind:Thus a man who exerts himself, and is of a steady mind, withoutattachment, unmoved (by passion) but restless (in wandering about),having no desires, should leave the life of an ascetic.179AtAcarakga Sutra1.2.4, we see this attitude to desire again, but with an interestingextra dimension:Wisely reject hope and desire, and extracting that thorn (i.e. pleasure)thou (shouldst act rightly).180DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION83"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"While the rejection of desire seems familiar, the idea that ‘hope’ needs rejectingseems at odds with the Buddhist view, until we see the Prakrit terms involved: asam ka khamdam ka vigimka dhire.181Here the term asamis akin to the Pali asa– which as we shall see in the nextchapter – is given by the PED as: ‘expectation, hope, wish, longing, desire’.182This is a sense of hope with specific connections with the notion of desire. Indeed,the Sanskrit equivalent af„is described as ‘wish, desire, hope expectation’,183reinforcing the idea that it is only a certain sense in which ‘hope’ is to be rejected.Reassuring, perhaps, that we need not abandon hope in all respects.Desire (or more accurately, our response to desire, preferably avoiding it)though is part of the process of escaping or defeating karma, for this is the primeconcern in Jain thought. The regular references to abandoning desire in Jainsutrasare often accompanied by injunctions to abandon either action in general,or more specific kinds of acts that are seen as particularly karma-generating, suchas acts which bring about harm to others:A person who is without desires and does no harm unto any livingbeings in the whole world, is called by me ‘unfettered’.184We see, in Jainism, lack of desire as part of the development of indifference,which seems similar – if not identical – to Buddhist ideas of equanimity (whichare discussed in Chapter 3). In the Kalpa Sutra(line 118) we see Mahaviradescribed in this manner:He was indifferent alike to the smell of ordure and of sandal, to strawand jewels, dirt and gold, pleasure and pain, attached neither to thisworld nor to that beyond, desiring neither life nor death, arrived at theother shore of saÅsara, and he exerted himself for the suppression of thedefilement of Karman.185The most interesting thing to note here is that the ‘indifference’ recommended isseen in a certain sense as functional. Lack of desire is part of the process thatleads to the end of Karman. That the goal is the removal or lack of karmanis clearthroughout Jain sutras, as at Acarakga Sutra1.7.8, where the mendicant’s lot isbeing described:He should not long for life, nor wish for death; he should yearn afterneither, life or death.He who is indifferent and wishes for the destruction of karman,should continue his contemplation.186Alongside these general rejections of desire, seeing it as something to beabandoned en route to the end of karma, we do find that desire is sometimesDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION84"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"seen as part of the path to this very goal. Drawing on the Tattvartha Sutra,Padmanabh Jaini lists the sixteen forms of action which help move us todeveloping a ‘tirthakkara-nature’,187number 5 of which is ‘intense desire ofemancipation’.188This discussion of desire in Jainism needs to be seen in the context of thesemi-materialist conception of karmain Jainism. Karmais seen as a kind of‘dust’ which is generated by action.189As Arvind Sharma writes:Reincarnation results from the fact that the soul is weighed down by karmicparticles, otherwise it would naturally ascend to the top of the universe.190These particles, this dust, is the primary obstacle to liberation, and desire is to beunderstood in this context. Action can be seen as drawing these particles towardsus. The particles are there already, as Jaini explains:Karmic matter is said to be ‘floating free’ in every part of occupiedspace.191In this world, with karmaall around us, action is seen as a form of vibrationwhich attracts karmic dust:The vibrations referred to here actually denotes the volitional activitiesof the individual.192So far it seems that action alone is the source of our karmic particles. But oncethe particles are drawn towards us, it is here that desire begins to play its role. Asoul, or jiva, will escape or be enslaved by these particles drawn by the vibrationof action depending upon its ‘desire-status’:Vibrations alone, however, do not produce bondage. The karmic ‘dust’which they draw to the soul would simply fall away were the soul not‘moistened’, as it were, by its harboring of the passions (kasayas): desire(raga) and hatred (dvesa).193This is a useful explanation. We can see here both why there is a primary concernwith action, but also why desire is problematic, if not the foremost concern in Jainthought.In Jain thought we have seen desire as an obstacle to liberation, but sometypes of desire – the desire for liberation itself – are seen as acceptable, evenvital. This typology is not developed to any great degree, for it remains second-ary to the Jain concern with the karmic results of action. This derives from theconception of karmain Jainism that divorces it from the Buddhist view of karmaas mind-generated. It is also worth noting, as this applies to some issues that willarise in Chapter 4, that Jainism shares some of the Buddhist concern with theDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION85"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"problem of attachment to ‘views’. While amudhadrsti– freedom from delusiveviews – applies to specific types of incorrect views,194it is worth mentioning thedescription of ‘correct view’ that P. Jaini gives in a footnote:Attainment of the ‘correct view’ is thus not an accretion of somethingexternal to the soul; rather, it is the unfolding of ‘true vision’ in thesoul.195This is interesting in relation to the Buddhist notions of ‘direct-seeing’ that arediscussed in Chapter 4.ConclusionOne issue, which I have left until this point to address, is whether or not we canlocate a ‘paradox of desire’ in Hinduism. In the introduction we saw the idea ofsuch a paradox in Buddhism, and it would seem that any tradition preaching adoctrine of the abandonment of desire is going to have similar problems. Doesone desire a state of desirelessness?We have seen that one whose desire is only for the Self is often classed as onewithout desire – so it may be that the desire of this sort does not count as the typeof desire that we are to overcome.This classifying of desires is, as I stated earlier, found only implicitly mostof the time, and there is no overt typology of desire that runs throughoutHinduism. However, the extraction of such a position from the texts seemsreasonable, and is persuasive. This may help to rescue Hinduism from accusa-tions of the aforementioned paradox. To demonstrate this, Killingley looks atBhagavata Puraja2.3.10:One who is without desire, or who desires everything,196or who desiressalvation with exalted thought, should worship God with intense disciplineof devotion.197Here the devotee without desire is the one who desires salvation. Killingleyexplains how, in his view, this helps escape the notion of a paradox of desire:Here again we may regard these descriptions as three alternativeattempts to describe the same kind of person, rather than as descriptionsof three kinds of person who are qualified for the highest form ofworship. Thus desire for salvation is no desire; otherwise, the desirelessstate on which salvation depends would be unattainable.198So, it seems clear here that the strategy is to give a special status to the desire forGod (in later, more theistic texts such as the Purajic ones) or the Self (in earlier,particularly Upanisadic texts) – making it equivalent to a lack of desire.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION86"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"This is an effective strategy, but is it defensible? How do these condemnation-exempt desires differ in terms of structure and effect from those with moreworldly objects? The obvious answer is that these desires can be satisfied. Unlikethe worldly desires that are doomed to frustration, desires for the Self or God, fortheatmanorBrahman, can be permanently fulfilled. In this way the desire isended because it is satisfied in such a manner that it can arise no more.Another aspect of explaining this matter is the idea that these desires – foratmanand/orBrahman– are desires that take us beyond the realm of maya, ofmultiplicity. This will be pursued as I now consider how the end of desire is seenas equivalent to the attainment of liberation.Why is freedom from desire associated with liberation199or salvation? If weconsider that the goal of much Hindu thought is to achieve – or come to know –the unity of the atmanwithBrahman, we can see that the goal is to end individ-uation, to re-merge with the primordial divine essence. If desire is what causesdifferentiation – through being a cause of rebirth, as well a force that caused thecreative act – then desire is the source, as mentioned earlier, of individuatedbeing. As Killingley writes:What makes kama a bar to salvation is that it is concerned with the worldof multiplicity.200Salvation is then the reversing of the creative process at &g Veda10.129.4, theextinction of desire causing the other to become part of the One. DermotKillingley makes this clear in his analysis of kama:kama is the necessary impulse for the creation of the world. It is kama,in other words, which initiates the transition from a unitary absolutebeing to the world of multiplicity. The way to salvation is the reverseof the cosmogonic process, and thus requires the abandonment ofkama.201This makes sense, but even desire for no desire is in terms of kama– making, aspreviously stated, the typology limited and shrouded in complex imagery and ritual.I wish to conclude by raising a number of issues that will crop up throughoutthe next two chapters, where I examine Buddhist approaches to desire.Why is desire so dangerous? Clearly it is powerful, especially in the context ofbeing the means by which the universe came into being. Its power then is hard tocontrol, but beyond this there are other reasons to be wary.Desire leads to frustration if unfulfilled – and given the nature of the world weinhabit, this is all too likely an outcome. Beyond this however, unregulated desirecan be seen as dangerous in another way. If our desires are not for the Self or God,then they can be seen as reinforcing the subject/object distinction – that betweenthe desirer and the desired. This distinction is one that much Hindu thought wouldDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION87"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"encourage us to overcome.202Non-God/Self directed desires seem predicated onthe implicit belief in such a distinction. In this way, desire binds us to thesaÅsaricworld of maya.In Jain thought we saw the problem of desire in a distinctive manner – makingourjivamoist and susceptible to karmic particles. While the treatment is distinctfrom Hinduism, it maintains the idea that desire is a force implicated in ourremaining in saÅsara. Desire emerges, then, as an agent of bondage. Therelationship between desire and freedom is explored more in detail in Chapter 5.One of the most forceful images to emerge in this chapter has been the neces-sity of our response to desire – we have no choice but to respond to the upspringof desire we encounter within ourselves.It would seem that, in many ways, desire ‘comes upon us’. From the &g Vedato ideas of Kamadeva, we have seen desire personified and externalised. Wemight read this as a psychological strategy for articulating the experiential realityof desire. It feelslike this thing beyond us. As such, we cannot – in the firstinstance – choose to be without desire. This lack of desire may come later, butfirst we must deal with the reality of desire.So, we are faced with the situation of having to decide what to do in the faceof desire. Earlier in this chapter I characterised the Hindu range of recommendedresponses with the idea of desire as a beast – one we can choose to try to tame,ride or kill. In one sense, this is simplistic, but in another it captures somethingof how Hinduism sees desire.TheKama Sutraseeks to regulate desire; it is placed firmly in the context ofthe householder aframa, integrating desire into life while preventing the worst ofits consequences. This we could see as a taming of the beast.The renunciant approach could be seen as incorporating aspects of both ridingand killing. To ‘kill desire’ is to bring about its total removal – to be free of desire.We have seen this as an important motif in Hindu thought. Alongside this, thedesire for the atmanor for God has been seen as equivalent to the lack of desire.We can see this as ‘riding’ desire. By re-orientating desire, we harness its power;we use its force and by riding it we are able to control its direction. This is to steerdesire to spiritually wholesome destinations, which themselves can be seen as theend of desire. If we are able to ride desire, we are able to use it as a vehicle whichis then conveyed to its own destruction.203In Chapter 3, I seek to discover if we can find a comparable range of responsesin Buddhist thought. Furthermore, I follow ideas discussed here on desire aspowerful and creative. We find in Buddhism a religion which, arguably, seeks todo without much of the metaphysical speculation found in Hindu thought. Insuch a context, is there room for a notion of desire with the same cosmologicalsignificance as in Hinduism? In seeking to answer this question, I hope tonot only discover the range of responses to desire found in Buddhism, but alsoindicate its arising in a way that Hindu thought does not.Hinduism lacks a fully worked out theory akin to the notion of paticca-samuppadathat is found in Buddhism and so seems less able, or maybe less willing, toDESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION88"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"explain the manner by which desire comes to be. It may be that it has no need todo so, especially if viewing desire in terms of metaphysical principle.

Furthermore, as we shall see,Buddhist understandings of the nature of spiritual practice are predicated on aneed to understand causality – therefore enabling the practitioner to intervene incausal processes. The arising of desire is just such a causal process, and we nowmove to see not only the nature and status of desire in Buddhism, but also howwe might respond to it.DESIRE IN NON-BUDDHIST INDIAN RELIGION89"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"90Through many a birth I wandered in saysara, seeking, but notfinding, the builder of the house.

This became, in the argument, linked to the notion of desire assomething negative, disturbing and possibly to be avoided. Alongside this werepowerful counter-currents of thought which were not only less judgementalregarding desire, but that also saw it as powerful and creative.The notion of desire as creative was reinforced considerably in Chapter 2,where we saw Vedic texts placing desire as part of their cosmology. Throughoutthe second chapter, though, two key questions kept returning. First, while the reli-gious seeker was regularly exhorted to avoid worldly and sensual desires, thedesire for the Self (as atman2) was encouraged. However this desire for the Self(which is equivalent to the desire for brahman, and in later more theistic texts forGod) was often described as having no desire, as being desireless. While attemptswere made to resolve this tension – how desire for the ultimate could also be legit-imately described as an absence of desire – there was no clear and coherenttypology of desire. I wish to investigate in this chapter the extent to whichBuddhism does offer this kind of typology.Second, it was asked at numerous points – and this is closely intertwined with thepreceding point – whether what was really called for was the elimination of desire,or its purification/modification. Before asking what the Buddhist answer to sucha question is, we need to consider whether the question itself makes sense withina Buddhist context. Why do we need to be so cautious? Well, loaded questionsare clearly something we should always be wary of, but there are also special3BUDDHISM AND DESIREThe varieties of desire"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"circumstances here. To ask the same question, and to expect a coherent answer, ofthe two religions must be done, if at all, with the recognition that despite surfacesimilarities, at a metaphysical, particularly ontological, level, they have verydifferent world-views.Which Buddhism?The reasons for limiting the scope of this book with regard to Buddhism are givenin the Introduction, but I will mention here briefly the rationale for this approach.Other than obvious considerations of size, I find in the Canonical Pali texts ofTheravada Buddhism a distinctive discourse on desire. While there aretensions,these are considerably less clouded than in many later texts.3While my overviews of Western and Hindu material have been wider in scope,I here need a tighter focus. I propose that out of a dialogue between the messageof the Pali Canon and the understandings of desire found in Chapters 1 and 2,we come to a more sophisticated, richer and potentially therapeutic conclusion.Limiting myself in this way is, of course, a double-edged strategy. The texts ofMahayana Buddhism say things of considerable interest, but setting them to oneside allows the clarity of focus necessary for the proper examination of those textsI am using.The redirection of desireIf we recall the Hindu view that desire needs redirecting to its proper object, wefind three ways of describing this object (though in an ultimate metaphysicalsense much, though not all, Hindu thought would say that they are, in the finalanalysis – beyond Maya– the same thing). Proper desire, which as we saw maynot even count as desire,4can be that for the Self (the atman), for Brahman(albeitnormally via desire for the Self ), or directed at God. Now, if we ask whether theBuddhist position can also countenance such a redirection of desire as a form ofquelling or quenching more troublesome forms of desire, we are not likely to getfar. Clearly, Buddhism is unlikely to recommend redirecting our desire in any ofthese three directions.First, the anattateaching of early Buddhism is in direct contrast to theBrahmanic belief in the atman. No atmancan be found and hence any desiredirected towards it is going to end in dukkha.5The quest for the inner-Self is fruit-less, from the Buddhist perspective. Here desire of the sort found in Hinduismcannot be fulfilled. Were there an atmanthen things would be different; therewould be a stable, reliable unchanging component of reality – desire could besated. In the absence of such an atman, such desire is necessarily doomed tofrustration. One might be tempted to speculate that nibbanais able to providea suitable replacement for atman–brahmanas an ultimate object of desire. Clearlynibbanavaries in that it lies outside the world6(whereas in some senses,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE91"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Brahmamis the world), but I will return to the question of desire for nibbanashortly.Second, desire for the divine brahman– the ground of all being – is likewisepointless and harmful. Pointless for the same reason that a desire for the atmanis –because no such thing can be found. The universe, in the Buddhist view, lacks sucha metaphysical ground. Things are not the way they are due to their being mani-festations of a divine essence, they just are. While this does make Buddhists sounda little like Sartrean existentialists, I feel it accurately represents the ontologyof the Pali Canon. Of course, the coming into being of phenomena is not justa matter of random manifestation – but relies on the process of paticca-samuppada.Things arise due to conditions, but this theory requires no external groundof being.Finally, what of desire directed at a personal God – such as we saw with Krsjain Chapter 2? Maybe here we can see a redirection of desire that Buddhists canapprove of. Buddhism does not deny the existence of devas, but these are seen aswithinsaÅsara– they have relatively little to offer the spiritual aspirant. Butmight there not still be a suitable focus for desire in the Buddha himself ? Afterall, is there not veneration of and devotion to the Buddha? Indeed, but we wouldbe grossly mistaken were we to take the Buddha for a god, particularly for a deityin terms of calling for devotion like that to Krsja. While devotional acts aredirected at the Buddha, the pre-Mahayana view is that the Buddha – afterhisparinibbana– is beyond contact with the world.7The precise status of atathagataafter death is a topic examined at numerous points in Canonical texts,8but whatever else is said, the Buddha is not a being with the attributes necessaryto make him an appropriate object of desire.If, beyond death, the tathagatais not a suitable object of worship and desire,9we might ask if he was appropriate as such an object during life. There are, in theCanonical texts, those who are said to have attained nibbanathrough faith inthe Buddha. Even here though, faith is not to be necessarily taken as equivalentto desire. One can offer a teacher respect, pay them homage even,10and havetrust in his or her message – but these do not amount to desire for the Buddha.Whether these kinds of feelings constitute a desire to be likethe Buddha – to beenlightened – is another matter, and will be addressed later.Furthermore, we might ask, if the Buddha is not an object of an appropriatelyredirected desire – might not something else be? Here we should perhaps considertwo potential candidates. First, the Dhamma(the teachings) and second, the godswhich Buddhism does seem to accept as existing. The Dhamma, in the sense ofthe truth of the Buddha’s teaching,11might seem an ideal object for a modifiedand redirected desire. A passion for knowledge seems a worthy enough thing.Here we need to be careful. It is just on topics such as this that confusion over theBuddhist view on desire can easily emerge.A striving after religious knowledge is something Buddhism is renowned for – it is a notably scholarly religion. On the other hand, we are warned againstattachment to views and unnecessary disputing.12It would seem that we may needBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE92"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"to make a distinction between an acceptable wish to comprehend, a desire forknowledge; and a grasping after understanding – which is harmful and seeksknowledge in a way damaging and dangerous to the seeker. Also we need to beaware that we may allow to arise the belief ‘I have understood’13in such a waythat it closes the possibility of further understanding.Already we can begin to see the emergence of desire as not straightforward.There are not just differing objects of desire by which we can judge our wants.There are waysof wanting, and this is a key aspect of what is explored in thischapter. Desire is a complex multivalent phenomenon, and Buddhism recognisesthis, and throughout this chapter we shall see not only this recognition, but, ofequal if not greater importance, the response to this recognition.The second candidate here is the gods. Buddhism does not deny the existence ofthe gods of Brahmanic belief. We can be clear on this, for in the suttas the Buddhaeven enters into discussion with such beings. For example, in the AriyapariyesanaSutta14we find the Buddha in conversation with BrahmaSahampati.15Thisdiscussion is a useful one though, for it demonstrates the fact that the Buddhistapproach to the Brahmanic gods varies from the Brahmanic view of them. For theBuddha, the devas (and indeed devis) are not manifestations of ultimate reality, norare they omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.16In the AriyapariyesanaSutta, the appearance of BrahmaSahampati seems to be, in part, a rhetorical strat-egy for establishing the Buddha’s superiority over such beings (BrahmaSahampatipleads with the Buddha to teach Dhammato the world).17The gods are insidesaÅsara, not beyond it – they are mortal and at some point, long-lived though theyare, will die and be subject to rebirth according to the quality of their kamma. Theyare limited, finite, transient beings such as ourselves – they too are subject to thethree marks of conditioned phenomena (anicca, dukkhaandanatta), so they cansuffer dissatisfaction and anxiety (dukkha).18Perhaps most vitally in the current context, the devas are subject to anatta–they lack an atman. If they lack atmanthis implies that they lack also the featuresofBrahman. This clearly not only prevents them from being properly consideredas ‘ultimate beings’, but would seem to also make them ineligible for considera-tion as appropriate objects of redirected desire. This does not mean that practisingBuddhists never venerate or offer acts of devotion to these, and other, limited butpowerful beings. There, in practice, has often been a co-existence of Buddhistbelief and:forms of religious thought and practice which centre on rituals aimed atgaining some benefit or avoiding some threatened harm from local gods,spirits, and so on.19These gods and spirits may be subject to anatta, but they are no less (and ofcourse, no more) real and substantial than we are.20Despite these practices, beinganattameans that the devas have no permanent essence or substance. Like us, thedevas are nothing but a stream of temporary conditioned phenomena.21BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE93"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"As well as being unsuitable as objects of our desiring, the gods themselves aresubject to their own ignorance-based desires, leading them to dukkha. In theSakgiti Sutta22we hear of the gods’ desires:There are beings who desire what presents itself to them, and are in thegrip of that desire, such as human beings, some devas, and some in statesof woe.23There are beings who desire what they have created,...such asthe devas Who Rejoice in Their Own Creation.24Here we see the kama-lokagods as in possession of desire. The above list isclearly not comprehensive, but we see the desirous nature of the devas. The desireof these devas is clearly qualitatively distinct from the ‘desire-of-the-Self-for-itself ’ that we saw ascribed to the Self (and therefore Brahman) in Upanisadictexts in Chapter 2. Desire for the gods, who are beings that themselves desire,from a Buddhist perspective, is, then, not going to be a salvific reorientation ofour desires, for they represent, and are affected by, the features that lead us fromdesire to frustration, such as aniccaandanatta.Desire and nibbanaI have deliberately left till the last another possibility, a possibility whose featuresare more complex, and whose relation to desire will be a key theme throughoutthis chapter: Nibbana. Should we not desire nibbana? After all, it is posited as theultimate goal of Buddhist thought.25It is always there, at least in the sense ofalways being available. Nibbanais neither aniccanordukkha, although it is madeclear that it is not a Self, lacking the features ascribed to the atman. As PeterHarvey writes:WhileNibbanais beyond impermanence and dukkha, it is still not-self...WhileNibbanais beyond change and suffering, it has nothing init which could support the feeling of I-ness; for this can only arise withrespect to the khandhas,26and it is not even a truly valid feeling here.27I mention this not only to clarify the notion of nibbana(although a little more willbe said later in the chapter on the nature of nibbana), but also to show that desirefor the Self is not identical with desire for nibbana, as they do not share all of thesame features.Nonetheless,nibbanais beginning here to look more appropriate as an object ofdesire. It is not anicca– it is permanent, something reliable to point our longings at.It is not dukkha– something which is in itself the end of suffering is surely desirable.Buddhists are directed at nibbana, as this is the goal of the path; as Kalupahanawrites of nibbana, it is ‘the goal or summum bonumof early Buddhism’.28If we can reject the previous candidates for truly desirable objects of ourdesires without too much trouble, this one is not so easy to deal with.29BuddhistsBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE94"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"should want nibbana; it is the concept which stands between Buddhist philosophyand the charge of pessimism, as it balances the emphasis on dukkha.30The worldmay be a place devoid of any inherent purpose or meaning, but the existence andreality of nibbanais what ultimately prevents the Buddhist weltanschauungfrombeing a form of nihilism.31I shall return, later in this chapter, to the issues caught up with the desire fornibbana. However it is clear that there are serious issues to be addressed here. Weare going to have serious problems if we wish to say that Buddhism would haveus remove all desire – for we should surely desire the desireless state that isnibbana.It is confusions over this very topic that lead to worries, as we saw in the intro-duction, over there being a ‘paradox of desire’ in Buddhism. This will not beresolved by just establishing a hierarchy of desire on the basis of the objects ofdesire (desire for nibbanabeing ‘better’ than desire for a cigarette, or even thedesire for a nice cup of tea). There are two reasons for this. First, even the desire fornibbananeeds to be relinquished in order to obtain nibbana32– a final letting-go inorder to pass through the door to the deathless. Second, two people can want thesame thing in different ways. Our desires can be motivated differently – surelythe desire for a drug to relieve acute pain is qualitatively distinct from someone’sdesire for the same drug for recreational purposes. Furthermore, as will be madeclearer as this chapter progresses, it is more than motivation; distinctions need tobe made between a ‘grasping’ kind of desire and a calm wish for something.It is worth noting here that the nature of nibbanaremains a controversial areawithin Buddhist studies. Grace Burford argues that the standard Theravada under-standing of it, particularly as understood in the Abhidhamma, represents a changefrom the early Buddhist position, and that this moves it away from us as a goal,making it into a form of metaphysical principle:The Abhidhammists transformed Theravada Buddhism by removingnibbanafrom the causal realm altogether. As Macy33points out, ifnibbanais treated as entirely unconditional, then it loses its relevance tothe world in which we live. She concludes that the tendency to equatenibbanawith a metaphysical absolute renders the goal inaccessible tothe very beings who need it.34I think she, and Macy, commit a possible non sequiturhere. Why does under-standingnibbanaas wholly unconditioned automatically render it as a metaphys-ical absolute? This is not wholly clear. In some senses, it is metaphysical thinkingthat stands between us and nibbana. It is the ways in which nibbanais distinctfrom the Hindu notion of Brahmanthat mitigate against it being viewed as thisabsolute principle of the universe. Nibbanais not a ground-of-being, nor is it aself-subsistent essence, but as unconditioned it is differentiated from that whichisdukkhaandanicca; to be conditioned is to be inevitably subject to these two ofthe three marks.35BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE95"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"I see why Burford wishes to make nibbanarelevant to those who practicekammic Buddhism(to use Spiro’s distinction, as she does to an extent).36However, for me the unconditioned nature of nibbanadoes not drain it of its rel-evance as a notion in the here and now. While I sympathise with her wish to makeBuddhism focus on the way our present lives can be transformed, the existence ofan unconditioned can, in my view, contribute positively towards this.To conclude what has been said in this section, we can clearly see how Buddhistthought differs from a Hindu approach. While both seem to call for an ending todesire, the Hindu idea of redirecting desire at a suitable goal – of possibly usingdesire as a vehicle of salvation – is radically different. The metaphysical basis ofBuddhist thought – arising from the anattadoctrine – is such that the desire fortheatman, for Brahman, for a theistic deity, all these are routes to dukkharatherthan liberation.In a way, we can understand the Buddhist position on these objects of appro-priate Hindu desire in the context of a term from the first chapter – as a ‘lack’.The universe is in ‘lack’; there is an absence of proper objects of desire37withinthe universe.38Desire has to be, then, understood in the absence of an atman,Brahmanor ultimate deity. This feature of reality – the metaphysical emptiness ofthe universe – structures Buddhist thought about desire in just as influential amanner as does the Hindu view of desire as tied in with the basic fabric of the uni-verse (and indeed what causes the universe to come about). Regarding the world,we can see that Buddhism proposes an ontology of lack, the world being emptyof Self and what pertains to notions of Self. Being – individual and cosmic – isempty, lacking svabhava.39This is significant for the way I look at desire in this and Chapter 4. Desire isnot to be seen as just that feeling one gets when one wants something. While notbeing described so often as integrated into the very fabric of reality as inHinduism, we still need to assess desire in a broad metaphysical sense. Desire isa force which acts in a creative, even world-of-experience-making, manner.This means that, in order to draw overall conclusions, desire must be initiallyexamined in two ways, with the goal of assessing it in a third manner. (1) Desire,as we experience it as individuals, must clearly be considered. How do our desirescome about within consciousness, how do they arise? I will attempt to answer thisquestion in both this chapter and the next. Here I examine the nature of the waysof desiring, the varieties of wanting. In Chapter 4, I look at these desires in theholistic context of Buddhist psychology40and through the way Buddhism under-stands the mind–body relationship. (2) Desire needs, as stated above, probingwith regard to the overall structure of reality. (3) Examining desire in these wayswill allow me to make judgements with regard to the kusala-status of desires. Thisthird component is vital, for here we shall find an answer to the question of whatwe are to do about desire. Armed with insight into the mechanics of our desiringwe can use these kusalajudgements to guide us in undertaking interventions inthese patterns of interaction.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE96"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Desire and the BuddhaBefore we move on to look at the terms used in Pali texts for desire, I wish to takea little time to ponder on whether the accounts of the life of the Buddha candemonstrate anything with regard to the Buddhist view of desire which he formu-lates after his attainment of nibbana. I am not here commenting on the historicalaccuracy of such accounts, rather on their rhetorical power in helping establish theBuddhist discourse on desire.Clearly the accounts of the life of the Buddha show an overriding concern withdukkha. This is best illustrated via the episode of the ‘four sights’,41where facedwith the reality of old age, sickness and death – and finally a paribbajaka– theBuddha goes forth from home into homelessness. The importance of dukkhawithin Buddhist thought is hard to overestimate. At M.I.140, in the AlagaddupamaSutta, the Buddha offers a summary of his teaching:Both now and in the past bhikkhus, what I set forth is dukkhaand thecessation of dukkha.42This is at the heart of the message of early Buddhism. It is the motivation of thewhole Buddhist project. However, we can get a sense of just how pivotal desire iswithin this project, and one way to do so is through a certain reading of the life ofthe Buddha. During his life prior to the ‘four sights’ and his renunciation, Gotamalived a life free from obvious want: all his needs were provided for. Indeedaccounts ascribe him a sheltered and cosseted existence.43Other than demonstrat-ing his noble lineage, such accounts present an image of someone who was in therare position of having most – if not all – of their worldly desires fulfilled.In the absence of awareness of ageing, sickness and death, there was lessreason for certain types of desire that other humans are subject to.44The firstthree of the ‘four sights’ represent not only an awakening of compassion,45butalso – and this is what is vitally important – a realisation that his own desireswould not always be fulfilled. It is not just the presently sick, dead and old peoplehe sees who are subject to suffering. The realisation must have dawned onVipassi/Gotama that he too, contrary to his previous beliefs, would not alwayshave all his desires fulfilled. Sickness, old age and death come to us all as unwel-come visitors, and the young Gotama – sharp minded as we are informed he was –was now in possession of disturbing knowledge. We can see this demonstrated intheAriyapariyesanaSutta(the Discourse on the Noble Quest) where the Buddhadescribes the thoughts prompting his renunciation:Suppose that, being myself subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, anddefilement, having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing, sick-ness, death, sorrow, and defilement, I seek the unageing, unailing, deathless,sorrowless, and undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana.46BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE97"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Here the Buddha describes these thoughts, and in them, we can see his awarenessof his ownperil at the hands of ageing, sickness and death, and the urge to tran-scend them. This does not make him selfish, but is a coming to be aware of theseuniversal afflictions.47Furthermore, and this is speculative but consistent withBuddhist thought, in order to make effective his compassion, the realisation of thefutility of desire and the inevitability of frustration is a necessary factor.The other incident related to desire that we can see in the life of the bodhisattapriorto his enlightenment is also related to the very antithesis of desire – renunciation.When Gotama goes forth, leaving behind his wife and son, he is not free from alldesire. Far from it, he has a new wish, a new goal to strive toward. He is now aseeker after religious knowledge. He goes to A¬ara Kalama as one desirous oflearning,48and after passing through all the available teachers and surpassingthem, completes his search after looking at the grove at Senanigama,49decidingthat such a place is appropriate for his final efforts, and proclaims:Indeed, then bhikkhus, there I sat down [thinking]: Here is a proper placefor striving.50Here we see the bodhisattaabout to engage in spiritual exertions. Clearly, striv-ing (padhana) can be considered to require an element of intentionality that onecould describe as desire – or at the least, as ‘goal-based’. What is obvious though(the term padhanawill be discussed later in this chapter) is that Buddhism is nota form of withdrawal from, or renunciation of, all mental activity. It is not a formof quietism. Indeed, it is mildly disturbing that Mrs Rhys Davids’ words, from justover a hundred years ago, still seem relevant here:There is, for instance, much that is misleading, or downright false, inlabelling Gotama’s doctrine as Pessimism, Pantheism, Atheism, Nihilism,Quietism, or Apatheia.51Buddhism is a vibrant and dynamic engagement with the realities of desire,whereby it does indeed seek to help us be still and calm, but this is for the purposeof clarity of thought. Furthermore, the still and calm is far from immediate and mayrequire the exertion of significant energies to achieve. To seek to withdraw from allmental activity would be, it seems to me, to move away from a middle-way towardsthe desire for annihilation. As we shall see, the Buddhist spiritual renunciant mayhave renounced much, but the remaining inner-task is an arduous one, requiring ofgreat energy and exertion.52The varieties of desireOne possible source of confusion when looking at desire here relates to issues oftranslation. There are in Pali, as in English, a great number of terms for desire.These terms represent a broad range of shades of meaning, some with ethicalconnotations and some without. To examine all such terms in detail would byBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE98"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"itself exceed the space available (and possibly the patience of both author andreader), but some attention is required. In order, then, to make sense of the usageof these terms, I will now offer discussion on some of the most important termsin the Buddhist understanding of desire.While I am primarily interested in Pali terms here, some Sanskrit equivalentswill be engaged with. So, while looking at Pali terms, I will often examine theirSanskrit equivalents, but this should not necessarily be taken as meaning that thePali term is directly derived from the Sanskrit one. As Wilhelm Geiger points out:Pali however cannot be directly derived from Sanskrit; for it shows anumber of characteristic features which suggest its closer relation toVedic...This has always to be borne in mind when in the following Paliforms are compared with Sanskrit forms. The former cannot be derivedfrom the latter but stand beside them as later formations.53So, we can make useful comparisons between Pali and Sanskrit forms, but itwould be wrong to assume that the Pali flows directly from the Sanskrit, or thatthe Sanskrit is somehow the ‘original’ or ‘true’ meaning of a term. While I do notwish to become distracted by this issue, it is worth reflecting that the goal of‘true’ renderings of Pali terms is difficult. The relationship between truth andlanguage is complicated, and not one I have any hope of solving here, but sufficeto say that for current purposes I do what I can to view the use of Pali terms inthe context of both their usage and, at times, the use of the Sanskrit equivalent.I shall leave the first till last, as it were. That is, one might expect any discus-sion of desire in Buddhism to kick off with tajhaand perhaps chanda– a termoften contrasted with tajha. It is tajhathat is implicated in the Four NobleTruths, and often seen as an exclusively negative form of desire. However, thereis much I wish to say on tajha(and indeed chanda) and I need to do so in thecontext of these other terms which I shall look at first.It is interesting, before looking in detail at the key terms for desire, to note thatnegative and positive mental states are often seen as parallel versions of eachother. When mental energy is expended, its direction can, as it were, go eitherway, and certain positive states are seen as particularly close to certain negativeones. We can see this as a qualitative affinity between two states – they are ofphenomenological similarity. We see this with relation to ragaas part of theVisuddhimagga’s discussion of temperaments. At Vism. 102 (III.75) we read that:Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy tem-perament because faith is strong when profitable (kamma) occurs in oneof greedy temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to thoseof greed.54Both faith and greed are keen to ‘stick to’ or latch on to an object – but this can bekusalaorakusala, depending on both the object and the manner of the latching.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE99"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"We also find, in the Visuddhimagga, that metta– loving kindness – is seen ashaving an affinity with affection. In Vism. 318 we read, in a discussion of thecharacteristics of metta, that:It succeeds when it makes ill will subsides, and it fails when it produces(selfish) affection.55This closeness between positive and negative forms of emotion or mental state isindicative of the importance given to the way in which we act upon our impulses –and the extent to which we need to be wary and mindful when seeking to developkusalastates of mind within ourselves.The three roots of unskilful action (akusalamula)I begin my consideration of the different ways in which we can see desire withinthe Pali Canon by looking to raga,dosaandmoha. These are given as the threekey flaws of character (the three kiñcana), the three obstacles, or the three fires(threeaggi)–ragaggi, dosaggi, mohaggi.56However, there is also another triad,which is seen as being responsible for motivating negative behaviour – be it ofmind or body: the three roots of unskilful action (akusalamula). This group doesnot have ragaat its head in the suttas or elsewhere. When given as these threeakusalaroots – such as at D.III.21457–lobhatakes the place of raga. This leadsme to consider lobhadirectly after raga,dosaandmoha– and from the way theAbhidhammaexplains lobhaI am able to begin to look at a wider range of terms.RagaThere is no fire like passion,no grip like hatred,no net like delusion,no river like craving.58I have translated ragahere as passion. While its primary non-philosophical meaningis ‘colour, hue, colouring, dye’,59ragais usually used in the sense of:excitement, passion; seldom by itself, mostly in combination with dosaandmoha, as the three fundamental blemishes of character.60We might have considered using ‘greed’ again for raga, but ‘passion’ seems anequally acceptable translation. One might worry that ‘greed’ better conveys moreof the negative character usually associated with raga, but I am not sure it coin-cides with the Pali usage as well as ‘passion’. ‘Lust’ is effective,61combiningsomething of passion with the negativity of greed, but it seems, to me, too stronga term for many of the uses of ragain context. However, some might still preferBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE100"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"‘lust’, as I did encounter the view that ragais associated with sexual passion ordesire. L. B. N. Perera writes:Buddhism recognizes man’s inherent desire for the pleasures of thesenses (kamacchandaorkamatajha) in which is embodied the morespecific trait of sensual passion (kamaraga), which, in effect, is sexuality.62Whileraga, as passion, may include this sense of sexual desire, I am not con-vinced from its usage in the texts that its meaning should be considered as limitedto this.In its Sanskrit use, ragahas the same meaning of colour – especially red, as wemight expect given its figurative use – but again its meaning is given in a lessnegative sense:Any feeling or passion, (esp.) love, affection or sympathy for, vehementdesire of, interest or joy or delight in (loc. or comp.).63This is clearly a more neutral sense, while the Pali usage has become specificallyassociated with a negative sense of passion. ‘Passion’ is a word we often tend touse in rather positive ways in English. Describing someone as ‘lacking in passion’is not usually a compliment,64and the Sanskrit usage of ragais somewhat closerto this conception. Nonetheless, for ragain Pali contexts I feel ‘passion’ is theclosest English can probably come.65A related term of interest here is viraga– the absence of raga. We can tell justhow akusala ragais by the idea that its negation is equivalent to clearly kusalastates. The PED gives viragaas:Dispassionateness, indifference towards, disgust...cleansing, purifying,Arahantship.66We see viragapositively recommended throughout the Pali Canonical texts,67used to represent a state of calm and the absence of psychological disturbance.However, while ragais not going to win any prizes for the most kusaladesireform, is its akusalastatus absolute? It would seem not, for we do encounter thenotion of dhammaraga– a passion for the dhamma. In the Atthakanagara suttawe find it occurring:[But] If he does not attain destruction of the taints, due to passion fordhamma, delight in dhamma68with the destroying of the five lower fetters,he then becomes one spontaneously reborn,69there attaining final Nibbana,not to return to this world.70This passage is interesting. It reflects the position of one who has made signifi-cant spiritual progress, but who has not overcome all of the asavas– the taints.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE101"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"But driven on by a ragafordhammathey become a non-returner, assured ofliberation after rebirth in the Pure Abodes.71Furthermore, it is worth noting thata non-returner has other ragain addition to dhammaraga. A non-returner still hasattachment to/passion for the rupaandarupalevels – the pure form and formlessworlds, forming two of the remaining fetters.72So while we are not seeing an arahatdescribed as possessing a form of ragahere, we are seeing it as part of a move which ultimately leads to nibbana. Thisissue of whether normally akusalastates can – if appropriately directed and inconjunction with other powerful kusala cittas and cetasikas – be used to propelourselves nearer to the spiritual goal will be further addressed when I come, laterin this chapter, to look at the term tajha.Dosa:the inverse of desireBefore moving to the next term for desire, it is worth pausing briefly to look atone of the other terms in the triad of raga/lobha,dosaandmoha.Dosa, whetheras ‘hatred’, ‘aversion’ or ‘ill-will’73is the inverse or contrary of desire. I will, laterin this chapter, discuss in general whether there are any structural (psychologicaland metaphysical) similarities between aversion and desire – for both areresponses to an object. While one is pulling towards oneself, the other is a push-ing away. In the three-fires imagery, neither is helpful to us. Indeed, as will beexplored in examining the ideal of the one who has achieved equanimity in thenext chapter, the goal is to achieve a state whereby pleasant and unpleasantobjects are treated the same way, neither causing mental disturbance.In Chatper 2, we saw that desire may be problematic as an ‘upsetter’ of order.In Buddhist thought we might characterise as problematic anything that is adisturber of calm. This, however, requires some qualification. Might not anupswelling of compassion disturb our calm, and yet still be a ‘good thing’? Possibly,but the ideal manner of dealing with such an upswelling is surely to be onefounded in mindfulness; where we observe and respond to our compassionateimpulse without allowing it to disrupt and disturb that calm we have managed toestablish. A more serious challenge to this idea emerges from the notion ofsaÅvega– which I have heard described as a ‘sense of urgency-for-liberation’.The PED gives saÅvegaas:Agitation, fear, anxiety; thrill, religious emotion (caused by contemplationof the miseries of this world).74Walshe renders the term, at D.II.214, when describing one affected by it as ‘beingmoved to a sense of urgency by what should move one’.75This is intriguing; canone be calm and urgent at the same time? Perhaps it is possible; if we see anurgent danger (maybe a chip-pan has caught fire on our stove), we can eitherpanic or respond quickly – but by retaining a level of calm we can actually bemore rather than less effective (we calmly place a wet tea-towel on the pan, ratherBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE102"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"than screaming and trying to throw the pan into the sink). While challenging, I donot think the clear importance of saÅveganeed overly problematise the view thatBuddhism seeks to cultivate ‘inner’ calm as one of its core values.Returning to desire as a challenge to this calm, what similarities can be foundbetween the Brahmanic concern with order and the Buddhist focus on calm? Bothare endangered by desire. For Hinduism the danger is usually in the form of kama,whereas, as is emerging here, many types of desire threaten calm.76I shall pickup this theme of calm later as we may find it a helpful tool in finally establishingthe aforementioned typology of desire that I am investigating to see if it can befound in these Buddhist texts.Returning then to dosa, this inverse of raga, we find that the PED gives its mean-ing as ‘anger, ill-will, evil intention, wickedness, corruption, malice, hatred’.77Theterm also has an alternative, but surely related, meaning as ‘corruption, blemish,fault, bad condition, defect’.78The PED also refers us to the Sanskrit term dvesa,and which SED defines as: ‘hatred, dislike, repugnance, enmity to’.79Dosais useful here, as it shows us that the flip side of desire is made of thesame material, as it were. The descriptions of dosathat I give above demonstratethatragaanddosamight be seen as the opposite poles of a magnet. One attracts,one repels, but both are made of the same material and the underlying principleof action derives from the same processes. If we see ragaanddosaas represent-ing opposite ends of a spectrum of partiality to an object, we can presume acentral point that represents the equanimity80that Buddhism aspires to develop.MohaMoha– the third of these unskilful roots – is associated not with desire or itsinverse, but with delusion or ignorance.81In Chapter 4, assess the extent to whichdesire and ignorance work in tandem as factors which tie us to the world ofdukkha.LobhaLobhais, as noted above, most well known in the triad of lobha, dosaandmoha,and in the Abhidhammait has come to oust raga’s position in this formula.82Lobhais commonly translated from the Pali as ‘greed’, but in the Sanskrit we seeit ever so slightly differently. In the SED we find it as:perplexity, confusion; impatience, eager desire or longing after...covetousness, cupidity, avarice.83Here there seems slightly less of a judgmental tone than in the PED where it is givenas ‘covetousness, greed’.84In the Pali, we do not have the relatively neutral sensesthat we find attributed to lobhain the Sanskrit. C. L. A. De Silva describes it as‘a state associated with consciousness which causes attachment to an object’.85BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE103"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"We can presume that as one of the three unskilful roots (akusalamula),lobhais a negative form of desire – but just how does the Abhidhammaunderstandlobha?

I address the terms inthe order they appear in the passage above, but first want to note that I shall leavetajhauntil last. I wish to examine this term in some detail due to its centrality tomuch Buddhist doctrinal thought.IcchaSo we come to iccha: ‘wish, longing, desire’.103Despite the neutral tones of thisPED definition, icchais commonly used to describe desire in a negative light. IntheTajhaVa g g aof the Dhammapada, we find the last section deals not withtajha, but with iccha:Weeds are the bane of fields, wishing is the bane of humanity,Hence what is given to the wish-departed104is a great fruit.105It is worth noting that ‘craving’ here is not the only ‘bane’ of humanity, as thepreceding sections also give the same treatment – virtually identically – to moha,dosaandraga. Here icchais associated with the three fires, those central flawsin the nature of us puthujjanas, us mere worldlings.The term icchais also addressed in the IcchaSuttain the SaÅyutta Nikaya.When the Buddha responds to a question from a deva:‘With what is the world bound? With the destruction of what is itunbound?106With what’s abandoning are all bonds cut free?’Wanting is that which binds the world, with the destruction of wanting isit unbound;With the abandoning of wanting, all bonds are cut free.107Here once more, yet another form of desire is contrasted with liberation. As withmany forms of desire, we see the ending of desire as equivalent to the attainmentof liberation.Looking at the above verse we might be tempted to see it in more cosmologicalterms than psychological ones. Might this be a form of cosmic desire, akin to oranalogous to that found in the previous chapter? I do not think so. The loka,(world) being referred to here, I take as meaning the world-as-we-experience-it.Peter Harvey argues, at some length, in The Selfless Mind, that lokais to be inter-preted in this way. One type of evidence he advances for this position is linguistic:The linguistic derivation of the word ‘loka’ also indicates it as meaning‘experienced world’. Related words in Pali are ‘oloketi’, ‘he looks at’,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE105"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"and ‘aloka’, ‘light’. Related Sanskrit words are locate, he perceives, andlocana, ‘eye’ (PED.586f ). Thus the primarymeaning of lokais ‘visible(or perceived) world’. In general usage, lokais always linked to beings insome way, thus the Buddha says ‘I quarrel not with the world (lokena),108the world quarrels with me’ (S.III.138), and it is said ‘Indeed the worldhas fallen on trouble; one is born and grows old and dies...’(D.II.30).109In this sense we can think of the world as a construction which emerges out of aninteraction and encounter between external empirical reality and the activity ofconsciousness. In this sense, the world is built by desire.We can see this in numerous ways – from the fact of our birth as a result ofdesire, to the manner in which desire colours all of our experience of reality, and,through its effect on perception, our view of the world. It is indeed the builder ofworlds in thissense; we inhabit the kama-loka– the world that desire built. I donot think that we need to make desire metaphysical to make it a builder of loka.The relation of mind and mental phenomena to the outside world is discussed atmore length in Chapter 4.Pa~idhiNow a term whose negation is clearly not equivalent with spiritual attainmentdespite its inclusion in this list –pajidhi.110We might not even consider the termone for desire at all, but it does seem to represent a form of motivational prefer-ence towards certain objects, as well as being found in this list of terms associatedwithlobha. The PED gives it as ‘aspiration, request, prayer,111resolve’.112But inusage it can be a little awkward to translate as this. In the Dasuttara sutta, we seepajidhiin use in a compound, as Sariputta is giving a lesson to the bhikkhus:What four things are very helpful? Four Wheels113– a suitable dwellingplace, association with good people, perfect resolve of the self,114andformerly made merit. These four things are very helpful.115Here we have pajidhias a form of resolve, or a mind state that can be part ofspiritual development. Clearly it is not explicitly associated with ‘desire’ as such,but it does seem of a similar type. Furthermore, it seems similar in some sensesto the important term padhana, which will be examined shortly.Pa~ihitaA related term is pajihita, which initially seems fairly close to pajidhiin mean-ing, given as ‘applied, directed, intent, bent on, well directed and controlled’.116While both represent mental states focussed on the future, pajihitaseems moreconcerned with focussed and controlled attention. While this may seem fairlyneutral in a moral sense, or even in terms of spiritual efficacy, it is interesting toBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE106"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"discover that the negation of pajihita, that is appajihita, is often linked closelywithnibbana.117A note in CDB, commenting on the use of appajihitaatS.IV.295, where one ‘emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’118has three kinds of contact which first resume – emptiness contact, signlesscontact (animitta– see page 95), and undirected (appajihita) contact. Theserelate to the vision of nibbanaattained at this stage, and the note explains howthese three relate to nibbana:Nibbana is called emptiness because it is empty of lust, etc.; signless,because the signs of lust, etc., are absent; and undirected, because it isnot directed towards lust, hatred or delusion.119Here the concern is primarily in relation to specific objects – negative ones. Butthe idea of undirected thought is a powerful one, and we can see why it is associ-ated with nibbana. The same three terms used in relation to ‘contact’ above alsorecur in Mil. 337, as the three components of the ‘Blessed one’s jewel of medita-tion’:120empty, signless and undirected meditation.121These three kinds of med-itation are often seen in post-Canonical literature as three ways of coming toaccessnibbana– as, in Vism.122– the three gateways to liberation.Primarily through an understanding, then, of its negation, we may come to seethatpajihitais a kind of object-directed attention that may serve us well alongthe path, but which we must ultimately leave behind. However, all three types ofgateway-meditation seen here should not lead us to vilify their opposite. Mostsamathameditation is not-empty (it has an object), it has a sign, and is, if to bedone properly, well-directed and focussed. Indeed, we see, at A.I.8, two types ofpajihita, wrong-directed thought and right-directed thought (micchapajihitaandsammapajihitarespectively), and are told of the beneficial effects of sammapajihita. These include the ‘breaking down of ignorance, and the arising ofunderstanding’.123This fits with much we shall see in the next chapter regarding ditthi– views,as they too can be right or wrong – but ultimately we must pass beyond either toattain the highest goal.PadhanaAt this stage I shall look at the more common term, related to the two above:padhana. We have seen that one of the most central elements in this study is theextent to which positive forms of desiring are described and discussed within theCanonical texts. Surely central to this is an analysis of the approach to the effortsmade by monks and nuns (and by extension also lay Buddhists) in their spiritualendeavours. The mental states which such endeavours necessitate are not purelynegative – not an attempt to achieve a mental nothingness – but rather are posi-tive proactive undertakings. Padhanais central to this. The PED gives padhanaas ‘exertion, energetic effort, striving, concentration of mind’.124BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE107"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Padhanais, then, seen as a necessary activity for the Buddhist practitioner. IntheSakgiti Sutta, as at many other points, we find that padhanais described asbeing fourfold:Four Strivings.125Striving for restraint, striving for abandonment, strivingfor development, striving for guarding.126While ‘striving’ does not necessarily have to be viewed as a form of desire, itsstatus as something positive and recommended is worth noting. It represents aform of mental intentionality which, when appropriately directed, is clearly kusala.In looking at padhana, we are drawn to a term which is often translated in asimilar manner –vayama. This term for ‘striving, effort, exertion, endeavour’127is most notable for its place in the Noble Eightfold Path. As the seventh Path-factor, samma-vayama– right effort – is important and interesting.It is important because it represents a proactive mental state at the heart ofBuddhist practice. This we have seen in padhana, but samma-vayamais so centralthat it is worth looking at further. The practice of samma-vayamais seen toinvolve the use or exercise of padhana. We can see this in the description ofsamma-vayamain the Mahasatipatthana Sutta:And what, monks, is Right Effort? Here, monks, a monk rouses his will,makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to preventthe arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states.128We can see a number of interesting things here. In this exertion, we see not onlypadhana(as ‘padahati’), but also chanda, which is above translated as ‘will’, andthe term cittaÅpaggajhati. This last phrase indicates an exertion of the mind, butpaggajhatiis a minor term for exertion, deriving this meaning from its primarysense of ‘to stretch forth, hold out or up, take up’.129This idea of stretching forththe mind is evocative – it seems to give the idea of a mind being turned to aspecific task, accompanied with energy as an act of will. We can view chandahere as this willing, this choosing to take up the battle (as will be shortly dis-cussed, chandais sometimes described as ‘desire-to-do’).This approach, the exertion of mental resources in this spiritual task, seems tobe based on the prior existence of samma-sakkappa. Once we have resolved toundertake the task, only then are we going to engage with the task itself. We shallsee in the Chapter 4 how samma-sakkappais viewed as itself deriving fromsamma-ditthi, right-view.Here though, there seems to be an active fight against negative mental states,againstakusala dhammas, which we might take on one level as a fight againstdesire. At the same time, it represents the expression of the will – and by exten-sion is surely the expression of a competing desire. Here desires do battle, whatwe might describe as a higher-order desire seeking to defeat lower-order desiresfor a kusalapurpose.130BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE108"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"While we can extrapolate this position, it is worth remembering that there is noPath-factor called samma-chanda,131orsamma-kama. We might wish to view thisas indicating that the effort, the exertion referred to here, derives from desires ofa different typeto those it seeks to combat. We saw above that we may see this assamma-sakkappa, but what is it that incites us to make or form this resolve? Wecould see it as negative, that samma-sakkappais based on a turning away fromcertain aspects of the world, away from the world of craving and loss. While thisstrategy is present in some aspects of Buddhist thought,132even this can be seenas a form of desire – albeit inverted.Furthermore, to limit Buddhist aspirational thought to the negative seems tomisrepresent what we find in the suttas, as well as portraying an absence ofpositive, higher-order goods in Buddhist thought. These higher-order goods arepresent. One at least is vital –nibbana.133This is the highest good, and representsa positive goal. Some might suggest that nibbanais itself negative, and it is oftendescribed primarily in terms of what it is not. This should not be taken, however,as indicating that it is a purely negative goal. Two reasons can be invoked for thisat this point.First, in terms of description, we can say what ‘nibbanais not’. The non-nibbanicis part of the world of our lived experience (and therefore language). This is not,however, to say that there are not positive aspects to nibbana– just that these liebeyond this realm of being, and therefore beyond the linguistic conventions of it.Second, to view nibbanaas nothingness is to move away from the soteriologi-cal middle-way that it represents. To see nibbanaas negative only indicates it is aform of annihilation – an ending of all. It is the ending of much, but despite thelack of consensus in Buddhist studies about the nature of nibbana, few wouldargue that it is to be seen as obliteration.We may also recognise other higher-order goods in Buddhism, which whilelower than nibbana, are still not negative. Metta, for example, might be definedas the absence of ill-will, but this does not prevent it from having an active andpositive content. It is not just a ‘nay-saying’ to ill-will, but rather a benign mental-state, whose arising we should strive for alongside (or more accurately, perhaps,intertwined with) the eradication of malign mental states.ApekkhaThe next term from the lobhalist is apekkha.134This term is less obviously neg-ative than many, being along the lines of: ‘attention, regard, affection for; desire,longing for’.135This is interesting, as we see a hint of how desire relates to ‘atten-tion’. In thinking about how desire arises in the process of perception, it is forthose items that we train our perception or attention upon that we can developdesire. However, apekkhais found to be implicated as a desire to be abandoned:That of wood, iron or fibres is not a strong bond, say the wise,A stronger attachment is longing for jewels, sons and wives,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE109"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"That is a strong bond, difficult to loosen, down-dragging and supple saythe wise,That too is abandoned by those who go forth, abandoning sense-pleasuresthey are without longing.136Here we see the absence or negation of apekkhaas equivalent with the abandon-ment of kamasukha– sense pleasure. So, here we see another type of longing ordesire contrasted explicitly with spiritual development. However, apekkhaisinteresting in that its negation is not always to be seen as wholly positive. ThePED gives anapekkhaas ‘without consideration, regardless, indifferent’.137I haveused ‘indifferent’ above, as it seems to fit the context, but there is a sense in whichananapekkhacan be seen as being thoughtless. Indeed, the past-participle of therelated term apekkhati,apekkhita, is given as ‘taken care of, looked after,considered’.138From this we can perhaps come to the position that apekkhais the turning ofone’s mind to something – it is caring about an object. This may be negative, orindeed ethically positive. The key is, I feel, a mix of whatwe turn our attentionto, and howwe regard the object of attention. The term is, therefore, interestingas within its range of uses we see a range of the understandings of how anindividual can relate to objects of perception and attention.AsaInasawe have a term of quite general usage, covering such things as ‘expectation,hope, wish, longing, desire’,139and we can here see a term used in non-negativesenses, as in the Janavasabha Sutta. Here the benign yakkha140namedJanavasabha tells the Buddha of his religious intentions:Indeed Lord, for a long time I have recognised myself free from statesof suffering,141and now the desire is established in me to be a once-returner.142A noble sentiment indeed. Here, finally, we find a form of desire expressed as apositive state of mind. This is important as it illustrates the existence of non-harmfuldesires. While this desire is treated in a fairly conventional manner here – as some-thing the yakkhawishes to achieve – it seems important because of its object(spiritual progress). There is nothing obviously distinctive about the typeof desi-ring involved. ADP gives asaas ‘wish, hope, expectation’,143and this seems evencloser to its usage. It is more a sense of preference for the future than the activedesiring that lead to acts of will, such as that of tajha. In the context ofJanavasabha’s use of the term above, we may well see asaas close in meaning to‘aspiration’.We can presume, then, that asais not always equivalent to desire-states such aslobhaandraga. Conventionally we might also say that asahere is clearly notBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE110"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"identical with a tajhatype desire, but as we shall see later in this chapter, someseetajhaas less inherently negative than is usually thought.UpadanaUpadanais an important term, being one of the nidanas of the paticca-samuppadaformula. Its role in this sense is examined again in Chapter 4, butI will say something about it here.It is important not only because it directly follows tajhain the paticca-samuppadaprocess, but also in itself as it can be seen to be close to the notion ofdesire in some senses. The term is often translated as ‘clinging’, ‘grasping’ or‘attachment’, but as we can see from the PED, this is a figurative use based on itsmore literal meaning. Its literal sense is given as:(lit. that (material) substratum by which an active process is kept alive orgoing), fuel, supply, provision.144This sense has largely, in Buddhist usage,145been supplanted by a secondarymeaning – albeit one that seems to draw on this primary notion. This second-ary meaning, ‘grasping, holding on, grip, attachment’146is the way it is used withrespect to its role in Buddhist thought, especially paticca-samuppada.We can see upadanaas resulting from tajha, as ‘attachment’. If we see tajhaas reaching for, or craving after, an object, we can see upadanaas a holding on(in a mental sense) to an object – as ‘grasping’ we can see it as a refusal to let goof objects of the mind or body. As such, upadanais to be viewed as somethingnegative – an akusalamental state. The different types of upadanathat are enu-merated in the Pali texts are examined in Chapter 4 as part of the examination ofdesire and paticca-samuppada.AbhijjhaIf we look at abhijjha, another term for a variety of desire, we see that the PEDgives it as ‘covetousness’,147but notes that it is ‘in meaning almost identical withlobha’.148But to ‘covet’ is an interesting notion. To ‘covet’ something is to wishto possess it, it is:to wish, long, or crave for (something, esp. the property of anotherperson). [C13: from Old French coveitier, from coveitié eager desire,ultimately from Latin cupiditas CUPIDITY]149This sense of desiring that which belongs to another is clearly expounded in theSevitabbasevitabba Sutta, in the lists of things to be cultivated and not cultivated:Here someone is covetous; he covets the wealth and property of othersthus: ‘Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!’150BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE111"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"We can see abhijjain a more general role in the Samaññaphala sutta, althoughhere ‘desire’ seems a less clumsy translation, only because there is no sense in thecontext below of the object of the coveting necessarily being the property ofanother:Abandoning worldly desires, he dwells with consciousness withoutdesire, his mind is purified from desire.151So, one of the ‘fruits of the homeless life’ (asSamaññaphalais often trans-lated)152is a mind free from worldly desires. Indeed, by the end of the passage,free from all desires. This echoes the Upanisadic material where the end ofworldly desires was equated with the end of all desires – although as we saw, thisoften was taken to mean that worldly desires had been supplanted by the desirefor God or the Self.In this passage I do not think there is any great significance to the omission oflokafrom the second half of the formula – in the passage, abandoning worldlydesires (abhijjha) leads to the purification of the mind from abhijjhain general,but might there be non-worldly desires that the samajaought to nurture ratherthan remove?Terms not in the lobhalist at Vibhakga361–2The terms addressed here are done so in the context of themes which representkey aspects of desire, as discussed this far. I begin with two of the most commonterms.Kamaandchanda:common terms for desireChandaChandais a very common term for desire in Pali. It is often found in use in com-pounds with some of the other terms for desire that I have been looking at in thischapter. Unlike many of these terms, chandais relatively neutral with regard toits ethical/kusalastatus. The PED gives its basic meaning as ‘impulse, excite-ment; intention, resolution, will; desire for, wish for, delight in’.153It is used inrelation to both positive and negative descriptions of desiring. After offering as atranslation of chanda, the terms ‘zeal, desire or wish-to-do’,154Nina van Gorkomreinforces the idea that chandain not inherently akusala:When we hear the word ‘desire’, we may think that chanda is the sameas lobha. However, chanda can be kusala, akusala, vipaka155or kiriya.156We have, then, a term here that seems to bridge some of the key ideas thathave been discussed in this chapter. By containing both notions of ‘intention’ andBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE112"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"‘resolution’ and ‘desire’ and ‘will’, we might see chandaboth as quite a generalterm for desire, and as possibly ‘desire-to-do’. C. L. A. De Silva gives it just thismeaning:Conation, desire-to-do (chando) is a state existing in consciousnesswhich makes consciousness desire to take an object. It is not greed, butonly a desire to do.157This may prove a useful idea, as this is something that may, in some instances, proveto be different from the idea of ‘desire-to-have’ that I associated with kama-tajhaabove.158Whilechandamay at times coincide with kama-tajha, the possibility ofa non-possession-seeking form of desire has significantly more kusala-potential.Maybe we can view it such that chanda-type desires can sometimes be found muchfurther along the kusalaside of the kusala–akusalaspectrum that I have beendiscussing.Part of what I wish to unravel with regard to chandais whether the distinctionbetween positive and negative, kusalaandakusala, types of chandais purely onthe basis of their objects or not. If we look to the equivalent Sanskrit term we findthat the adjectival use of chandahas a range of meanings, the primary being givenas ‘pleasing, alluring, inviting’.159That is, chandarepresents that which has thefeatures of inviting desire. If we move on through the SED definition, we soonfind that chandais used in a way similar to as in Pali ‘pleasure, delight, appetite,liking, predilection, desire, will’.160The related term chandas is also similarlydefined as ‘desire, longing for, will’.161What is notable about chandais its occasional explicit usage to refer to beneficialorkusalacategories of desiring. We can see this in its use as part of the notion of adhamma-chanda. We find this used as a compound term in the Saññanatta suttaatS.II.144, but here Dhammais being used in the sense of mental phenomena, ratherthan as ‘teaching of the Buddha’.162The combination of dhammaandchandaismainly located in commentarial texts, but we also find it in the Abhidhammain theVibhakgaanalysis of samma-padhana– right striving or exertion.163In this analysis, a bhikkhuis exhorted to do four things as part of this striving.These four are: chandaÅjaneti vayamati viriyaÅarabhati cittaÅpaggajhati164–to bring forth the desire,165to strive/make effort, to arouse energy, to exert themind. This should be done for the prevention of akusalastates, and the produc-tion of kusalastates. We see here chandaas a key aspect of right-striving. Whenwe come, a few lines later, to the discussion of the nature of chandain thiscontext, we can see this positive sense of it clearly explained:What, then, is desire? That which is desire, the act of desiring, desire toact skilfully,166desire for Dhamma, this is called desire.167Here I have translated chanda(andkama) as desire, but this needs somequalification. This is desire in the explicit context of samma-padhana. As such weBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE113"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"can see here how desire of a certain sort is to be actively produced, cultivated, ifdone so in a kusalamanner, and aimed at a kusalaobject (Dhamma). In someways the Vibhakgaview here seems an extrapolation from the suttas. We do findthe same factors at play in the discussions of the place of chandawithin theiddhipadas.The notion of a kusalaform of chandais reinforced by the presence of chandaas one of the iddhipadas – the ‘four bases of power’.168These four mental factors,when appropriately accompanied by acts of will can lead not only to generalspiritual progress, but also to the practitioner’s possession of psychic powers suchas the ability to become invisible, to fly, and the like.169Theiddhipadas aredescribed in numerous locations in Canonical texts, such as the Janavasabhasutta, at D.II.213, where Brahmais addressing other devas:Here a bhikkhudevelops the basis of success that is furnished both withconcentration gained by means of desire to act, and with forces ofendeavour; he develops the basis of success that is furnished bothwith concentration gained by means of strength, and with forces ofendeavour; he develops the basis of success that is furnished both withconcentration gained by means of mind, and with forces of endeavour; hedevelops the basis of success that is furnished both with concentrationgained by means of investigation, and with forces of endeavour.170Throughout his discussion of chandaand the iddhi-padas, Rupert Gethinroutinely translates it as ‘desire to act’,171and we can see chandahere very muchas ‘desire-to-do’, placed as it is in a setting with concentration and striving. It isthe ‘wish’172to make spiritual progress that is effective in combination with theseother factors.This represents a clearly kusalaform of chanda, and seems to be much bettersuited to play the role of a form of desire for good objects in a kusalaway thatMorrison seems to wish tajhato play. Lama Anagarika Govinda reinforces boththe distinction between kusalaandakusalaforms of chanda, and its relation todoing, while linking its arising as kusalaorakusalaas related to our level ofinsight:According to the level of knowledge or insight, chanda either turns intokamacchanda (a synonym of tajha), sensuous desire, or into dhammac-chanda, the desire or rather striving for liberation. On the sensuous planechanda mainly results in action, on the spiritual plane, as in the case ofmeditation it results in the progressive movement towards the aim. Inboth cases it is the will to realizethe result of our mental activities. Theprotean nature of chanda is very similar to that of the word ‘desire’.173This gives a sense of chandaas potentially a force of positive spiritual charge –which moves us away from tajha-type desires, towards a leaving behind ofBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE114"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"‘seeking to have’, towards a Dhammacchanda, where the goal of Dhammais inaccordance with that ascribed to it by Stephen Batchelor when he claims that:The primary purpose of Dharma is to reestablish a consciousness ofbeing.174This makes chandaa vitally important notion, and also we find that chandais aforce of some power. The Janavasabha suttapassage above also demonstrates whatpower desire has. If we consider the role of chandahere, it is a striking evocationof the power of desire. Like the saÅkalpaof the Vedic ritualist, a concentrated andforceful use of desire can lead to the possession of the great powers, the iddhis. Nowonder the Buddha warns against their casual use!175Chandacan be seen here assomething with a potential that the mind can find a means to unleash – so much soas to defy the normal laws of the universe.176However, chandais not a term for only positive forms of desire. We also findit regularly used in negative settings. Most notably, kamacchanda– a desire forsense-pleasures – is the first of the ‘five hindrances’, as at D.II.301 in theMahasatipatthana Sutta. However, we also saw the first hindrance in the discus-sion of the hindrances in the Samaññhala Sutta(D.I.71), given as abhijjaÅloke(worldly desires), and earlier in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, the first hindranceis given at D.II.299, as having a saragaÅcittaÅ(a lustful mind).We do not have to worry too much over these variations in description of thefirst hindrance, for chandaappears in negative contexts outside of its usual,but apparently not universal, place as the first hindrance. For example, in theMahanidana Sutta,177we find chandaragacrops up regularly in the list ofnidanas involved in the process of paticca-samuppada:And so indeed, Ananda, feeling conditions craving, craving conditionssearching, searching conditions getting,178getting conditions decision-making,179decision making conditions attachment and desire, attach-ment and desire conditions attachment,180attachment conditionspossessiveness, possessiveness conditions avarice, avarice conditionsguarding [of possessions].181This group of paticca-samuppada nidanas clearly relates to the way we interactwith possessions and the like, and we next find that arakkha– guarding leads toarguing and fighting. But what is significant in the current context is the clearlyakusalaform of chandahere encountered, and that it is the typeofchandathatcauses the problem, not the object of the chanda.We find the ethical indeterminacy of chandaformally established inAbhidhammaanalysis. Within the Abhidhammascheme,chandais a mental-factor, a cetasika.Cetasikas are classified according to both their occurrence inconsciousness and their kusalastatus. We can find this expressed in the twelfthcentury work, the Abhidhammattha Sakgaha, attributed to Acariya Anuruddha.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE115"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chandais classified as an aññasamanacetasika– that is, an ethically variable182mental factor. However, unlike cetasikas considered as sabba-cittasadharaja(as universal, ever-present components of consciousness), chandais consideredto be one of the pakijjaka, occasional, cetasikas. At II.3 of the AbhidhammatthaSakgahawe find the following passage:Application, investigation, determination, energy,183zest, and desire,these six mental factors are named occasionals. Thus, these thirteen184mental factors are to be known as the ethically variable.185One way, and I think one that fits with the Abhidhammaview, is that thesecetasikas can be seen to intensify any state – good or bad. In their commentaryon the Abhidhammattha Sakgaha, Bhikkhu Bodhi and U Rewata Dhammaexplain the nature of such cetasikas:The occasionals(paki~~aka): The six cetasikas in this group are simi-lar to the universals186in being ethically variable factors, which take onthe moral quality of the citta as determined by other concomitants. Theydiffer from the universals in that they are found only in particular typesof consciousness, not in all.187This is both useful and intriguing. Useful as it clarifies the status of chanda.Although the Abhidhammattha Sakgahais clearly much later than the Canonicaltexts on which it draws and seeks to clarify, this analysis seems in keeping withwhat is found within them with regard to the use and status of chanda.The analysis of Dhamma and Bodhi is intriguing in that they say relatively littleabout what actually determines the ethical status of a particular instance of achanda cetasika. ‘Other concomitants’ is vague, but one can only presume thatthe overall citta(mind-state) that the chanda cetasikais present in has its ethicalorkusalastatus determined by the other cetasikas present. This demonstratesthe existence of a kusala-variable form of desire, but more than that, the kusalastatus of the cittais not necessarily determined by the object of the citta, but byothercetasikas present. Nina van Gorkom reinforces this point:Chanda is conditioned by the citta and other cetasikas it accompanies.Chanda is sakkhara dhamma, conditioned dhamma. Different kindsof chanda arise due to different conditions.188Chandaseems an appropriate topic to conclude this examination of Buddhistterms for desire with. It can be seen to contain elements of both what is meant, inEnglish, by ‘desire’ and ‘will’, and maybe at times even ‘wish’. It is somethingwhich can be, not only on the basis of its object, ethically, or kusala–akusala,variable, and therefore can be seen as emblematic of a Buddhist belief in thepossibility of the transformation of desire.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE116"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Are we to tame or kill the beast of desire? For the Buddhist, some beasts (suchastajha) can be ridden only a little way, but some (such as chanda) can be tamedand ridden almost to our final destination – although the crossing of the finalthreshold seems to be something we may have to do on foot, leaving our transport(be it a tamed form of desire or – to bring in a more typically Buddhist image –a raft) at the door. Beyond this door, even Arahats and the Buddha may havechandaat times, for they may be motivated, conditioned by compassion for thesuffering of their fellow beings, to teach others.189KamaOf all the terms not in the list given at Vibh. 361, the most notable absence –except in compounds – is kama. So common a word in the suttas, it is – as oftena somewhat vague or imprecise term – much more rare in the abhidhamma. In thelobhalist we saw kamaused only as an object of desire (such as in kamatajha),rather than as a form of desire itself, a role we saw it in often in Chapter 2.Kamaas a Sanskrit term is, as we have seen, used for both desires and theirobjects. It is, in Sanskrit, something of a catch-all word for desire. That it takesup two full pages of the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary190givessome indication of the wide range of compound words it is used in. It is primarilydefined here, though, as:wish, desire, longing...love, affection, object of desire or of love . . .pleasure, enjoyment; love, especially sexual love or sensuality.191Here we can see what a range of uses kamahas – and have seen its range also inthe previous chapter. If we look to the Pali usage of the term we can see that it isstill a term for desire, but the PED limits its basic definitions a little more,describingkamaas:Pleasantness, pleasure-giving, an object of sensual enjoyment...sense-desire.192The PED is interesting here, as it goes on to demonstrate the negative associationsthatkamahas acquired in its use in Pali texts. Kama– as desire, rather than objectof desire – becomes here a central obstacle to the religious life:In all enumerations of obstacles to perfection, or of general divisions anddefinitions of mental conditions, kama occupies the leading position. It isthe first of the five obstacles (nivarajani), the three esanas (longings), thefour upadanas (attachments), the four oghas (floods of worldly turbu-lence), the four asavas (intoxicants of mind), the three tajhas, the fouryogas; and kama stands first on the list of the six factors of existence:kama, vedana, sañña,asava, kamma, dukkha.193BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE117"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Kamais clearly seen, in a wide variety of contexts, as deeply problematic. Thiscan be seen in the Aneñjasappaya Sutta, where the Buddha warns at length of thedangers of sense-pleasures:The Blessed One said this: ‘Sensual pleasures,194Bhikkhus, are imper-manent, they are empty, false and of a deceitful nature.’195This usage is common throughout the Canonical texts. We can however find kamaused in a more neutral, if not positive, sense. For example there is the compoundsotukama– desire to hear.196This is a term without the negative moral connotationsnormally ascribed to kama.Kama, as mentioned above, refers to both the desire and its object. This leadsto a distinction in some texts. At the opening of the Mahaniddesawe found thisdistinction given and elaborated upon. The two types are given as ‘vatthukamacakilesakamaca’197– desire as object, and the defilement of desire. In most settingsthat I am here concerned with, it is kilesakamathat is being discussed.Furthermore there is a phrase we find throughout the commentaries and sub-commentaries – and, as I shall look at shortly, in the Visuddhimagga– but whichis found at only one point in the Canonical texts themselves. This is muñci-tukamyata198– which is perhaps best translated as ‘desire for freedom’ or ‘desire forliberation’. The discussion of muñcitukamyataat Vism. 651–2 is in the context ofdeveloping knowledge of the desire for liberation, and it is the knowledge that seemsunder scrutiny, rather than the idea of a desire for liberation. Here there is no sensethat the desire involved in desiring liberation is in any way problematic or contradic-tory at all.The desire for liberation is described in a vivid image at Vism. 665. Here weare told the tale of a man who discovers that the woman he lives with is a‘ghoul’.199He has followed her at night, and discovered her feasting on the fleshof the dead in the graveyard. He is, understandably, scared, and runs quickly to asafe, quiet place and hides there. How does desire for deliverance fit into thisgrim scenario? Buddhaghosa explains:Herein, taking the aggregates as ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is like the man’s livingwith the ghoul. Recognising the aggregates as impermanent, etc., byseeing the three characteristics is like the man’s recognizing that she wasa ghoul on seeing her eating human flesh in the place for the dead.Appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened.Desire for deliverance is like his desire to escape.200He goes on to liken his quick escape to ‘the Path’, but we can see fairly clearly herehow he uses the notion of muñcitukamyata. He sees it as a sensible response tothe unpleasantness of saÅsara. All of Buddhaghosa’s references to muñcitukamyataseem based on the treatment in its single, known Canonical appearance atPatisambhidamaggaI.60–2. Here the concern is with the knowledge of desire for‘deliverance’, and is concerned with the development of equanimity with regard toBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE118"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"formations (sakkharas). Here, the desire for deliverance – or our knowledgethereof – is developed to develop the virtue of equanimity. This gives this sense ofdesire a tone which seems far from the craving of tajha. If it is something whichcontributes to equanimity, it will surely lack the desperate tone of much desiring,being something altogether calmer, more reflective and positive. The implicationsof this notion of desire will be discussed later.Desire and disturbance:paritassanaA word not found in the list discussed earlier, but which reminds me of muchdiscussed in Chapter 2, is paritassana: ‘trembling, fear, nervousness, worry,excitement, longing’.201While this is not directly described as desire, it is in thesense of ‘longing’ that I am particularly interested in it.Many religions make much of notions of yearning – albeit usually withindevotional theistic traditions. Some even see ‘yearning’ – which I associate with‘longing’ – as a core element of religious practice. Pamela Anderson goes as farto see yearning as an indispensable component of religion:I support an account of female desire, in the form of a rational passionnamed ‘yearning’, as a vital reality of religion.202Interestingly this conclusion is, in part, reached via an examination of certainbhaktipractices. While the existence of yearning and longing in Hinduism is in nodoubt, can we see a role for it in the view of religion given by the Pali Canon? Andif we cannot, is this not problematic? Anderson associates yearning and longingdistinctively with female forms of religious practice. A cynic might argue thatTheravada Buddhism has no room for desire,203and that by its ‘coolness’ this formof Buddhism is repressive of emotionality. I would not go quite so far as this, andwhile ‘rational passion’ may be a little strong for Buddhism, ‘rational desire’ mightwell fit into some of the forms of desiring I wish to suggest exist in Buddhism.Furthermore, Buddhism is sprinkled with a range of positive kinds of emotion.The most obvious example is probably metta, an active form of love or sympa-thy,204but it is not alone. Emotions have an important role in Buddhism, asDamien Keown states:The correct role for the emotions in Buddhist ethics is to be found in thesentiments of love and concern which inspired the Buddha to make thechoices he did.205We do not have to concur with Keown’s association of Buddhist ethics withAristotelianism to assent to this claim. Emotional responses are vitally important toBuddhism, so much so that we might argue that the Buddhist project is an attemptto train the emotions, rather than suppress or eliminate them. Indeed, at least asmuch Buddhist practice seems aimed at nurturing positive emotions, as is aimedat removing negative ones.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE119"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Returning to paritassana, despite what I have said about longing, it is perhaps clear already that we are likely to see its use in a primarily negative sense.Not only is it longing, but also excitement, nervousness and worry. Bodhi andÑajamoli206translate it as ‘agitation’, and I have already noted that part of theproblem with desire is that it can be an enemy of calm. Clearly such an excitedstate as paritassanais unlikely to be viewed as healthy. In the Cu¬asihanada Suttathe ending of paritassanais equated with attainment of nibbana:When he is non-attached, he is not agitated,When non-agitated, he personally attains nibbana.207This fits with what is an emerging pattern here – the ending of various desire-types as synonymous with the attainment of nibbana.Willing in Buddhism: adhitthanaandcetanaAdhitthanaBefore moving to the most common term for will (cetana), if we understand ‘will’as that which carries out the resolve of sakkappa, I first wish to look at a term witha similar meaning –adhitthana. This is given by the PED as ‘decision, resolution,self-determination, will’.208We might, however, initially see adhitthanaas closertosakkappathancetana, and indeed Maurice Walshe translates adhitthanaas‘resolve’. He does so at D.III.229 when the Sangiti Sutta– in listing groups offour – gives four types of adhitthana:Four kinds of resolve (adhitthanani): [to gain] (a) wisdom, (b) truth(sacca), (c) relinquishment (caga), (d) tranquillity (upasama).209Not only does this give us a sense of the use of adhitthana, it also represents it ina positive light. We can occasionally find it included in a less wholesome contextthough. In the Alagaddupama Sutta, we find someone being warned aboutparitassana, and find a list of things that the Buddha’s teaching recommends weeliminate. This list is given, at least in the CSCD edition, as one long compound:ditthitthanadhitthanapariyutthanabhinivesanusayanaÅ. If we look closely wecan see adhitthanain there. As you can see below, some render adhitthanaasdecision – making it more like cetanathansakkappa:He hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata teaching thedhamma for the elimination of all standpoints, decisions, obsessions,adherences, and underlying tendencies, for the stilling of all formations,for the relinquishing of attachments, for the destruction of craving, fordispassion, for cessation, for Nibbana.210BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE120"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Here we see adhitthanaas part of a chain of negative terms. It seems, then, to sitbetween cetanaandsakkappain meaning, somewhere between the resolve andthe willing to act.However, this general discussion ignores the most central use of the term, whereit is given a much more important role to play. We find this not so much inthenikaya-pitakaas in later literature, where adhitthanais one of the paramis–the perfections. In this context, we might better translate it as ‘determination’. Thisis a useful term as it captures something of both resolve and choice. In many waysthis makes it a stronger or firmer idea than cetana. By this I mean that cetanaisever-present in consciousness, and may be weak or strong, but adhitthanais oftenviewed as a somewhat firmer form of resolve.CetanaAn important term that I now wish to address, particularly in the context of the dis-cussions both above and in Chapter 1, is cetana. The PED gives this term as:‘thinking as active thought, intention, purpose, will’.211Now, we might be temptedto read from this that cetanais very close in its meaning to sakkappa, but cetanahas a specific usage and varies significantly from sakkappa. Cetanahas a moretightly defined role in the process of coming to act, and is most commonly trans-lated as ‘will’ or ‘volition’. Rupert Gethin recounts for us the standard role it isgiven in the Pali texts:According to the Nikaya formulation, will or volition (cetana) consti-tutes action (kamma); having willed one performs actions by body,speech and mind.212We can see cetanaas that whereby we express our desires, and other mentalstates, by coming to act upon them. If we view it in the same way that ‘will’ wasdiscussed in the introduction, then cetanacan be seen as that which lies betweenthe desire and the act. We choose what it is we wish to do, then we will do it –leading to the act.Cetanais important because of the role it plays in the area of kamma. Althoughkammais literally ‘act’ or ‘action’, in the production of kammic consequences, itis usually seen in Buddhism that the vital act in such a context is a mental one. Itis by cetanathat we generate the kammic force behind our acts. Not only does thishave an explanatory role in the process of kamma, but it also makes intention a keycomponent of the Buddhist understanding of ethics and ethical consequence:Perhaps Buddhism’s most important contribution to this development ofthe concept of karmawas to have made the crucial act a mental one,a ‘volition’ or ‘intention’ (cetana) such that it was the presence of this,rather than the external act alone, which became the first karmicallysignificant force.213BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE121"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Steven Collins seems to be along the right lines here when he acknowledges thecentrality of cetanato the processes of action and kamma. Another writer whorecognises the importance of this notion is Damien Keown. He places cetanainthe context of choice, particularly moral choice; indeed he is not wholly happywith the rendering of it as ‘volition’.Cetana, in his view, arises affected by sixcetasikas(components of consciousness):namely: ‘applied thought’ (vitakka), ‘sustained thought’ (vicara),‘resolution’ (adhimokkha), ‘courage’ (viriya), ‘joy’ (piti) and ‘desire’(chanda).214Keown splits these six into two broad categories. The first three he describes asforms of ‘deliberation’, while the latter triad he classes as forming the ‘impulseto act’. We can see partly now why he might not have been happy with thetranslation ‘volition’, as this role seems largely fulfilled by the viriya-piti-chandagroup, once taken collectively. This view sees the ‘will’ (I will use this for cetanafor now) as both emotional and rational.Our choices (what we will) arise, then, from a holistic set of mental processes.It would seem that desire (in most of the forms examined in this chapter) is some-thing that precedes cetana. In the model proposed by Keown this is the case – theterm chandarepresenting the forces of desire.215Desire, resolve and the spiritual quest:sakkappaandesanaSakkappaNow we can cast our thoughts back to Chapter 2, as I wish to follow up the Paliequivalent to the Sanskrit term saÅkalpa. In Chapter 2, we saw saÅkalpaas intention,as the resolve behind action, particularly ritual action. In Buddhist usage we find theterm sakkappa,216which the PED gives as ‘thought, intention, purpose, plan’.217Ofthese, clearly ‘intention’ is both most interesting in the current context and closest tothe Vedic use in Sanskrit, although ‘resolve’ seems to be a good candidate as well.Another possibility which captures the sense of sakkappaquite well is ‘aspiration’.218Regarding the meaning of sakkappa, Rupert Gethin offers a view whichconfirms it as ‘intent’, but that also links it to vitakka:AsaÅkalpais literally, then, a ‘conforming’, a ‘(suitable) arrangementor adaptation’. However, the word is regularly used of a clearly formedthought or idea; it thus conveys the sense of ‘intention’ or ‘purpose’. Onemight say, then, that saÅkappais the gearing of mind to whatever is itsobject in a definite and particular way. By the time of the earlyAbhidhamma texts this is clearly identified with the technical termvitakka,219The overriding connotation in this connection is that of thefirst jhana-factor. Yet, as we have seen, the association of vitakkaandBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE122"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"saÅkappais also present in the Nikayas, though perhaps in a fashionthat suggests a rather looser connection. The general idea seems to be,then, that saÅkappais equivalent to the way in which the mind appliesitself to or thinks of various objects.220This explanation of sakkappalinks it to something rather like willing, or an under-standing of how the mind relates to objects. To see the extent to which we can viewsakkappaas a desire-like notion, we need to see its usage in Buddhist settings.Sakkappais most often found in the term samma-sakkappa, the second akga(factor) of the eightfold ariya-magga. Samma-sakkappais usually translated as‘right-thought’, and is an element of the path which many books seem to treat ratherquickly, doing little to distinguish it from samma-ditthi, ‘right understanding’.221One of a number of places where this is described is in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta:And what, Monks, is ‘right-thought’? The thought of renunciation,222thethought of non-ill-will, the thought of non-injury, this, Monks, is called‘right-thought’.223This gives a general sense of the term as something which should be used to guideour relations with both others and ourselves – a sense of how one ought to lay outintentions for actions and for thoughts – of the resolve one ought to develop. Ifwe cannot go quite so far as to describe it as a form of desire, it certainly can beseen to represent a form of noble aspiration. In the Vibhakgawe find the samedescription of samma-sakkappaas in the Mahasatipatthana Suttaand elsewhere,but also find an Abhidhammaapproach:Now, what is ‘right-thought’? That which is reasoning, reflection,224...andso on..., right-thought, path-element, included in the path, this is called‘right-thought’.225This may seem to add little to the suttaanalysis, but we see within the idea heresomething broad. Sakkappaincludes resolve and intention, but seems also toinclude certain types of reflection and reasoning. This makes sense, if we realisethat intention or resolve is the result of reflective processes.One element of samma-sakkappa, as seen in the passage above from theMahasatipatthana Sutta, is nekkhamma-sakkappa. Nekkhamma-sakkappais theresolve to achieve desirelessness. Nekkhammais an interesting term, whichthe PED gives as:Giving up the world & leading a holy life, renunciation of, or emancipationfrom worldliness, freedom from lust, craving & desires, dispassionateness,self-abnegation, Nibbana.226This is clearly a state in accordance with Buddhist goals. It makes sense then toconsider it as something to point our intentions at. The term however is interestingBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE123"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"in other ways as well – throwing light on kama. Gethin offers his translation ofthe term:I have translated nekkhammaas ‘desirelessness’ largely because in thepresent context it stands in opposition to kama. But the derivation ofnekkhammahas been a matter of discussion.227Following this, he offers some discussion of its derivation, before coming to aparticularly relevant conclusion:Now, kamain the Nikayas is used to mean both ‘desire’ and ‘what isdesirable’; this is equally true of kamain Sanskrit. From the Niddesaonwards this distinction is expressed in terms of ‘desire as defilement’(kilesa-kama) and ‘desire as object’ (vatthu-kama). Strictly, then, thatwhich is opposed to kama, namely nekkhamma, ought to reflect thisdistinction. It seems to me that this is why the commentaries seize onthe possibility of taking nekkhammaas ‘turning away’ or ‘departing’:nekkhammais absence of desire because it turns away from desire, butit also turns away from what might be desired.228This is illuminating, and shows the relation of object and subject in the desiringprocess. We can see why the aspiration to remove desire from our mental profilecan also often be seen as a turning, in some sense, away from the world. This isnot, though, a world-weary withdrawal away from temptation. The process of‘turning away’ discussed here seems more to do with the moving of attention.Further, without the inner-work, without addressing ‘our’ desire, the process ofachieving nekkhammaregarding objects can surely never hope to succeed.Returning, then, to Nekkhamma-sakkappa, we might describe it another way:as right thought for desirelessness – but this does seem clumsy. However if we optto consider an aspect of samma-sakkappaas ‘intention to be without desire’ or‘resolve for desirelessness’, we may seem to be paradox-bound, headed for the‘desire to be desireless’. As hinted earlier, there are two approaches to such poten-tial problems.The first is to say that we need desire in order to be rid of desire, and that it isa gradual process whereby gross desires are replaced by increasingly nobledesires, until we reach a point where the last few subtle and refined desires canbe let go of. We might think as an example here of the desire for nibbanahavingto be abandoned as a final means of attaining it.The second approach, whose compatibility with the first will be consideredlater in this chapter, is to argue that in the phrase ‘intention to be without desire’what is meant by an ‘intention’ is qualitatively distinct from what is meant by‘desire’.If we were to limit samma-sakkappato ‘right-thought’, this would limitthe extent to which we could understand it involving intentionality, and mayBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE124"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"make it rather close to what is meant by the first path-factor, samma-ditthi.‘Right-resolve’ seems to overcome this, and takes into account the other commentsabove about the possible role of reflection in samma-sakkappa, as well as seemingcloser to the manner in which samma-sakkappaoperates as a path-factor.If we see samma-sakkappaas a kusalapath factor, its inverse is ‘wrongresolve’ –miccha-sakkappa. Again we come to concerns with the kusalastatus ofthese mental states. While the criteria of kusala–akusalahas been discussedalready, we can see here that right resolve is clearly kusalaas it is that resolve,that determined resolution, that is a necessary but not sufficient condition ofprogress towards nibbana.Wrong resolve then, as akusala, is a hindrance to spiritual progress. But what doesmiccha-sakkappaconsist of ? Is it the desire to do wrong? The MahacattarisakaSuttagives us an insight into this:What, monks, is wrong resolve? The resolve for sensual desire, the resolvefor ill-will, and the resolve for harm: this, monks, is wrong resolve.229These factors that make up wrong resolve are all negative, and might all be tracedtomohaoravijjain some sense – and the second and third can also be seen torelate to dosa. What is also interesting in this suttais that following this we aregiven an account of samma-sakkappathat says something noteworthy. It is saidhere that there are two kinds of samma-sakkappa. One form is mundane, affectedby the asavas, the taints, although still preferable to miccha-sakkappa. There isalso a supramundane form of samma-sakkappa, a noble form.230This second sense of right resolve means that samma-sakkappais not only, orat least not primarily, to be understood as the absence of kama, byapada, andvihiÅsabut as something more substantial and positive. This twofold explanationis closely related to the structure of the understanding of samma-ditthi– right-view – as we shall see in the Chapter 4. These factors which compose the nobleform of samma-sakkappaare:The thinking, thought, intention, mental absorption, mental fixity,directing of mind, verbal formation in one whose mind is noble, whosemind is taintless, who possesses the noble path, and is developing thenoble path.231This indicates its positive nature as more than the absence of negative traits. Thisis an active model of samma-sakkappa.EsanaA term we find used in a number of places in Canonical texts, including theSangiti sutta, is esana.232Given by the PED as ‘desire, longing, wish’,233thisterm is interesting as it initially appears that we can see it applied to both wholesomeBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE125"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"and unwholesome objects. In the Sangiti suttawe find three types of it enumerated:‘Tisso esana– kamesana, bhavesana, brahmacariyesana.’234These three types ofesanaare for sense-pleasures (kama), becoming or being (bhava) and the holy life(brahmacariya). The first two equate to the first two types of tajha, but the third,rather than being for abhava– non-being – is for this noble end.Walshe translates esanaas ‘quest’235in this context; presumably as these threegoals are things at which we, consciously or not, direct our lives towards. Butdoes his translating it in this manner lose the sense of ‘desire’ found in the PEDdefinition? To an extent it does, but what we find common in both notions is theidea of ‘wish’ – goal orientated action. We find the same three types of esanaatS.V.44,236in the MaggasaÅyuttain a suttaentitled the EsanaSutta. Here the threetypes of esanaare given, followed by a fairly standard recounting of the NobleEightfold Path. The purpose of the suttais explained as developing the Path fordirect knowledge of these three types of esana.237What is interesting is what comes next. We now see that the three forms ofesanaare all negative. After developing a full understanding of them, the NobleEightfold Path leads to the utter destruction (parikkhayaya) of the three forms ofesana. Next we are told that the Path’s development is for the abandoning(pahanaya) of these three searches. These are clearly not searches or goals thatone should aim at – the Path is directly opposed to them, and is the means to theirabandonment.What are we to make of this? If the three objects of esanawere the same as fortajhathis would be straightforward, but what of brahmacariyesana? BhikkhuBodhi informs us that Saratthappakasini, the commentary to the SaÅyuttaNikaya, explains ‘brahmacariyesanaas the search for a holy life consisting in awrong-view’.238It would seem then that brahmacariyesanarefers not to theHolylife, but aholy life – a path other than the Buddhist one, or maybe the Buddhistpath wrongly grasped. This is one way to view brahmacariyesana, but one couldview esanain general in different ways. Sayadaw U Panna Dipa, in his bookSalient Articles on Buddha Desana, makes use of esanawhen making a distinctionbetween tajhaandupadana:the root cause of pains of the five aggregates which one suffers for one’sown desire or search is called ‘esanatajha’.239What is meant here is not wholly clear, but it seems to be identifying, althoughno textual reference is given, esanaas a type of tajharelated to the types ofdesires one is following – to whatever it is one is looking for. This might lead usto view brahmacariyesanaas an unskilful way of seeking in a religious context.This is an idea that would stand further investigation, although sadly there is notroom here.240Esanais not always cast in a negative light. Indeed, we can see it used in the termpariyesana241in an obviously kusalasense in just the title of the AriyapariyesanaSutta.242Thissuttamakes a distinction between an ignoble searching (anariyaBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE126"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"pariyesana) and a noble search (ariyapariyesana). The noble search takes us tonibbana, while the other, the anariya, is directed at other objects:And what is the ignoble search? Here someone being himself subject tobirth seeks what is also subject to birth.243This makes fairly clear that esanais not to be viewed wholly as negative.244Theonly way that a distinction seems to be made between kusalaandakusalaforms is,here, on the basis of the object of the esana. Whether we can make the same claimabout all forms of desire in Buddhism will be addressed later in this chapter.Some minor terms illustrative of desireThe minor terms listed here are to give a sense of the range of terms for desire, butalso to give a feel of the way desire is characterised – how terms with other useshave acquired a sense relating to desire. I give them here in (Pali) alphabetical order.AlayaThis is a term whose use for ‘desire’ is only secondary to another meaning; indeedanother meaning that in later thought becomes very prominent. The term alayaisgiven in the PED, first as ‘roosting place, perch, that is, abode, settling place,house’,245and it is in this sense that later, Yogacara thought employs it, in the ideaofalaya-vijñana– often rendered as ‘storehouse consciousness’.246However,here I am interested in its secondary meaning (presumably derived from the ideaof a perch) of ‘ “hanging on”, attachment, desire, clinging, lust’.247It is a fairlyrare term in the suttas,248although we can find this sense of alaya, such as atS.I.136, in the compound alayarama. The CDB translation gives this as ‘delightin adhesion’,249while the LDB250translates the same term (in the same context –although with respect to Vipassirather than Gotama) as ‘delight in clinging’.251However, outside its use in this context the term is a fairly rare one in thissense, and I now draw my consideration of it, and my examination of these minorterms, to an end.Ke¬anaThis term is one with a limited context and usage. Given in the PED as:desire, greed, usually shown in fondness for articles of personaladornment: thus ‘selfishness’.252This can be seen as a hanging-on to those things which we believe will bring ushappiness, and as such rather far from desire in its usual sense. Indeed, ADP doesBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE127"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"not even mention ‘desire’ in its definition, giving it as ‘cherishing, excessiveconcern’.253As such, and considering it is an uncommon term, I say no more onit here.KilesaA term we rarely see in Canonical literature, but whose usage is common in latercompositions is kilesa. We need not expect this term to be a favourable referenceto desire, as it is used only with reference to desire figuratively. Its literal mean-ing is ‘stain, soil, impurity’.254This term became associated with the fact that ourcharacters are ‘soiled’ with certain negative features, drives and emotions. Assuch it is often translated as ‘defilement’. As the PED states it istantamount to our terms lower, or unregenerate nature, sinful desires,vices, passions.255We get an even clearer sense of this in ADP, which begins by defining kilesaas‘affliction, distress’.256In describing it more fully, ADP says that kilesa’s usagerelates to:Esp. that which afflicts, that which stains; an affliction, a defilement; adefiling passion, esp. sexual desire, lust.257It is important to note here that kilesais often used, especially in later literature,for any of the triad of greed, hatred and delusion, or indeed to refer to them col-lectively. Furthermore, we should not make the mistake of taking kilesaas part ofsome fixed ‘human nature’ though. While most of us (unless we are enlightened)are indeed subject to such stains, the aniccaandanattateachings clearly indicatethat there are no such fixed elements to our being. Indeed, were such stains per-manent there would be no possibility of spiritual attainment – our stained naturescan be cleansed with the ‘detergent’ of Buddhist practice. The best illustration ofthis is in an account of how the mind is effected by such stains:The mind, monks, is brightly shining. But it is defiled by stains whicharrive.258This sees negative desires as stains upon our otherwise clear mind. We can see inthis idea some echoes, albeit to be understood in the context of anatta, of theHindu idea of (re)discovering some pure inner Self. While the mind lacks manyfeatures of the atman, this view sees desire in a not wholly dissimilar manner.JataAnother term with an occasional figurative use as desire is jata. While jataisliterally a ‘tangle of braid’, and is used to refer to the tangled hair of an ascetic,259BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE128"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"it has, as the PED indicates, a desire-related usage ‘(the tangle of ) desire’.260IntheJataSutta(at S.I.13) we see Anto jatabahi jata, jataya jatitapaja– ‘a tangleinside, a tangle outside, people261are entangled in a tangle’.Again we can see desire draped in the imagery of entanglement. Like vana,jatais an evocative image. Both give images of peril, of being enclosed andunable to find our way out.PipasitaWe might think that we could find an example of the use of tajhain its literal sensein the Mahaparinibbana suttawhere the Buddha is thirsty, and asks Ananda to fetchhim some water. If we look to D.II,128 we find the Buddha saying to Ananda:ComeAnanda, bring me some water as I am thirsty, and wish to drinkAnanda.262Here we have not a form of tajhaas thirsty, but pipasita. This is derived frompipasa, a term for thirst. As Mathieu Boisvert notes:The term tajhaitself is never used in Pali literature to refer to ‘thirst’ assuch. Instead the word pipasais employed when thirst is intended.263We also find this term, albeit used less literally, in the Sangiti sutta(D. III.238.)in the sets of five, where the Buddha is enumerating obstacles to the Holy life,and a list is given of types of desiring.Five mental bondages: Here, a monk has not got rid of passion, desire,love, thirst, fever, craving.264The passage goes on to list various things that these ‘prisons of the mind’ mightbe directed at. Walshe, in his notes to the above translation, claims that pipasaisused here in a way rather like tajha, but as a form of craving which is not asstrong or forceful as tajha. In most cases the term pipasais used to refer to thirst(or sometimes hunger) in a literal sense, and its figurative use is uncommon.Ta~ha: craving and desireOf all the terms for desire in Pali Buddhism, tajhais the most central. Were I soinclined, the whole book could be on this single term and its occurrences in thePali Canon. This would have been, for my purpose, too narrow, but tajhaiscertainly important to this study, and I therefore dwell on it somewhat here. Wefind tajhadefined as:lit. drought, thirst; fig. craving, hunger for, excitement, the fever ofunsatisfied longing.265BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE129"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Sanskrit equivalent trsjahas a similar sense. Although it seems to tend moretowards the literal sense, the figurative use is still present.266Perhaps the bestknown use of tajhais in the Four Noble Truths. We find a fairly standard versionof this in the Mahasatipatthana sutta:What, O Monks, is (the) Noble Truth regarding the origin of dukkha? It isthis craving, leading to rebirth, connected with267pleasure and passion, find-ing pleasure here and there, that is craving for sensual pleasure, craving forbeing and craving for non-being.268Heretajhais cast in its usual role – the primary root of dukkha. Elsewhere theroots of dukkhaare given a much more detailed treatment.269While there is a sig-nificant amount of material devoted to the discussion of tajhain the Sutta-pitaka,it is a term that crops up much more rarely in the Abhidhamma pitaka.270Tajhacomes across usually as a very negative mental phenomenon. Tajhais that whichkeeps us tied to the process of saÅsara, as we can see at It.15:A man companioned by cravingWanders on this long journey;He cannot go beyond saÅsaraIn this state of being or another.Having understood the danger thus-That craving is the origin of suffering-A bhikkhu should wander mindfully,Free from craving, without grasping.271Throughout the Pali texts, we are repeatedly recommended to destroy tajha, andits elimination or destruction is often explicitly linked with the attainment ofnibbana.272I say relatively little here on tajhaasakusalaas this seems apparent –it is a common view in both the Pali Canon and in interpretations of it. However,the nature of tajhadoes need a certain amount of clarification.We can see in the passage quoted above three types of tajhagiven: kama-tajha, bhava-tajhaandvibhava-tajha. In the light of the previous discussion ofkama, the first seems straightforward enough, although it is worth noting thatherekamais used in the sense of an object of desire, rather than as a form ofdesire itself; this is consistent with the way we saw it defined. But what of theother two types of tajha?Bhava-tajhaandvibhava-tajhacan be seen as representing types of crav-ing predicated on two extreme (wrong) views, those of eternalism and annihila-tionism.273That is, the first is a craving for continued becoming. We can seethis on one level as the root of the urge to self-preservation – indeed we mighteven say Self-preservation. By this I mean that bhava-tajhacan be seen asthe desire or craving to continue existing as oneself (both in this life andbeyond death). Such a craving is based, it would seem, on the belief that we couldBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE130"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"do such a thing – it is rooted in the belief in an atman-like Self which couldfeasibly continue.274Likewise, we can see vibhava-tajhaas based on the belief that the destructionof the Self is possible – which makes no sense if there is no Self to be destroyed.At another level, we might read vibhava-tajhaas the root feeling of forms ofaversion. It can be seen as the desire to avoid that which is unpleasant. In an inter-esting move, Mathieu Boisvert associates tajhawith aversion in general muchmore closely:According to Buddhism, craving reflects our discontentment with thepresent moment, with reality as it is. We desire or crave somethingbecause of a deep inner dissatisfaction and because of our inability toaccept reality as it presents itself. Craving is nothing but aversiontowards our immediate situation. Similarly, aversion manifests itself asthe craving for a better condition. The word tajharefers both to cravingand aversion and henceforth, whenever the word craving is employed,aversion is also intended since both are the two faces of the same coin.275While this clearly applies to vibhava-tajha, is he right to apply aversion to tajhain a general sense? This makes craving seem inherently negative – it is alwayscraving for things not to be how they are. I think that on one level he is right – forin wanting something, we want what is not the case. But at the level of lived expe-rience we do not always experience craving in this way. While my craving for aglass of whisky may be related to my current ‘not-having whisky’ state, I feel itas a positive wanting of something. He does however make a useful link betweenthe nature of craving and our deep inner lack of satisfaction. This topic is dis-cussed, in the sense of anattaand its link to desire, at some length in Chapter 5.We saw earlier in this chapter the triad of lobha, dosaandmohaas represent-ing three negative components of consciousness. Damien Keown connects thesewith the nature of tajha:Linked together the three root vices form what we might term ‘thetriangle of tajha’, as the sum of intellectual and moral deficiency andthe cause for the arising of suffering.276Is his idea of a ‘triangle of tajha’ sustainable? At first it may certainly seem so.We can see that mohacan be seen as representing avijja, the root cause of tajhain the paticca-samuppadaexplanation. Lobharepresents the notion of kama-tajha, while dosacould be viewed as representing vibhava-tajha– in that it canbe seen as aversion, the inverse of desire forsomething.However, this is all too neat and tidy, and the terms seem rather forced intoplaying these roles. Kama-tajhaseems to be something more than just lobha, anddosa’s meaning is not identical with that of vibhava-tajha. Lobhais used tooloosely277in the Canon to play the role he gives it here, and mohaseems to haveBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE131"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"a sense more akin to confusion and delusion278rather than the ignorance associatedwithavijja; although there may be an overlap in meaning, they are far from beingsynonymous. Nonetheless, this analysis that Keown offers does illustrate some ofthe aspects of tajha, and locates it as akusala. Furthermore, in the SunakkhattaSutta(M.II.258) we can see tajhaexplicitly associated with dosa,279chandaragaandavijja– a similar if not identical grouping to the three ‘fires’ discussed byKeown:Craving has been called an arrow by the recluse; the poisonous humourof ignorance is spread about by desire, lust and ill-will.280This reinforces the idea that while tajhamay not be confined to the three fires,and they may not be confined to explaining only tajha, there is a significant andclose association between ideas of ignorance and hatred or aversion and the notionoftajha. This helps us to view tajhanot as a unitary negative thing, but to see itmore holistically as part of a complex of mental states. This seems not only morein line with the view we find in the Buddhist Pali texts (for all mental states, notjusttajha), but also in line with what we might best term the ‘process approach topersonhood’ that Buddhism advances.In assessing the spiritual importance of desire, when looking at tajha, we cometo a central point. In the process of change laid out by the Buddha, must a tajha-desire always be transformed into, or replaced by, a different type of desire beforeit can be viewed as kusala? One view of the Buddhist approach to desire is thatone is not seeking to end, but rather to transform, desire. This idea is found explic-itly in some Hindu texts, and arguably is also found in some forms of MahayanaBuddhism, especially in Tantric thought. In his book on Buddhist sexuality,Bernard Faure refers to this when discussing the transgression of moral bounds:The concept of ‘pivoting’ or ‘overturning’ (Skt.paravrtti) seems to liebehind the view that rather than negating passion, desire, and sexuality,one can transmute them.281Although Faure is claiming to discuss a ‘generic Buddhism’,282his comments onthis topic are primarily supported by Mahayana texts. Indeed, whether the Palitexts to be studied here share the view of the Hevajra-tantrathat ‘by whateverthing the world is bound, by that the bond is unfastened’283is doubtful. That is,what evidence can we locate – if any – for the view that one must overcome a spir-itual barrier through the re-direction of that very obstacle? Can we really usetajhato overcome tajha? While the Canon abounds in negative uses of tajha,there are notable exceptions. The most striking of these must surely be that atNettipakaraja87:284There are two types of tajha, skilful and unskilful. Unskilful tajhaleadsto saÅsara, skilful tajhais abandonment, it leads to diminution.285BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE132"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"This is a surprising passage. Tajhaseemed safe as a form of akusaladesire, butin the light of this passage, it appears that this may not always be the case. Howare we to understand this comment? Can we argue that such a claim is incompat-ible with other claims made in Canonical texts, such as within key doctrinalformulae? The presence of tajhain the twelve links of paticca-samuppadaissurely not enough to mark it as inevitably akusala.The other nidanas do not all seem to be akusalaby their nature. In the broad-est sense of the term we might say that all tend towards dukkha– that seems def-initionally true by their inclusion in the formula. However, we do not have to seeall aspects of the twelve-fold paticca-samuppadaprocess as inherently akusala.Indeed, it would seem problematic to talk about anything having inherent proper-ties in the context of anattaandanicca. However, we should not mistakeBuddhism’s lack of what contemporary philosophers tend to call ‘essentialism’for something it is not. Some things are akusala– such as the intentional killingof another sentient being, or harbouring hatred for others (or indeed oneself ).How are we to marry the lack of inherent properties with the making of broad eth-ical and spiritual claims in Buddhism? This is not the place to enter into too fulla discussion of this notion, but it would seem that phenomena can have fixed rolesin causal processes – they always lead to certain results, without this compromis-ing the notions of anattaandanicca. The notion of paticca-samuppadaallows usto move beyond an essentialist metaphysic to an ontology of process.In the context of tajha, the claim that there can be kusalaas well as akusalaforms of it is remarkable. As discussed in the overall introduction, thekusala–akusaladistinction is not to be taken as purely one of type, but also as oneof degree.286Two actions, for example, can both be akusala; but waging chemi-cal warfare on people seems significantly more akusalathan using head-licekilling shampoo on a child’s hair.I will return to the idea of relative kusala–akusalajudgments shortly, but nowwish to consider two writers who take very seriously the notion of a kusalaformoftajha. We saw such an idea above in the passage from Nettipakaraja87, andboth writers use this in their analysis. Bruce Matthews, in his book Craving andSalvation, argues explicitly for the possibility of kusala tajha. In addition toNettipakaraja87, he cites the more detailed enumeration of the types of tajhafound in the Sakgiti Sutta. After the three types of tajhadiscussed above (kama-tajha, bhava-tajhaandvibhava-tajha), and types of tajhaassociated withthe world of sense-desire, the world of form and the formless world, we finda controversial and important claim about three types of tajha:Three further types of craving– craving for [the world of ] form, cravingfor the formless [world], for cessation.287This last form of tajha, that of nirodhatajha, is the important one here. Nirodha,as cessation, is often associated with the cessation of dukkhaand is used in posi-tive contexts surrounding the attainment of nibbana. Is this, then, a form of tajhaBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE133"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"which aims at the Noble goal? Matthews suggests that ‘Controversy surrounds themeaning of nirodha tajha.’288He cites numerous positions with regard to thisphrase, such as T. W. Rhys Davids’ view that it indicates ‘craving for life to end’,289which seems rather close to the notion of vibhava-tajha. While, as discussedbelow, there are other views of nirodha-tajha, the Vibhakgaanalysis of it – whereit discusses the various types of tajhaenumerated in the Sangiti Sutta– describesit in such a way as to associate it very closely with vibhava-tajha:What then, is craving for cessation? Passion, infatuation, infatuation ofconsciousness, accompanied by an annihilationistic view. This is called‘craving for cessation’.290If we turn back a page or so in the Vibhakga, to where the triad of kama-tajha,bhava-tajhaandvibhava-tajhaare described, we find the definition of vibhava-tajhato be identical to the above definition of nirodha-tajha.291Matthews, however, also refers to Johansson’s view292ofnirodha-tajha, claim-ing that ‘it refers to craving for the cessation of everything that is negative’.293Matthews goes on to say that:Others294maintain that it [nirodha tajha] refers to a more noble, albeitparadoxical, craving for nirvaja.295Now, this might, given what I have said above, not be very different from the viewof Johansson – for nibbanais, as indicated, often associated with the cessation ofthat which is negative. Why, though, does Matthews suggest that this interpreta-tion of nirodha-tajhais paradoxical? Is it the cessation of, among other things,desire that he refers to here? ‘The desire to be without desire’ seems to be the areahe is aiming at here. I may desire that I no longer desire something negative – thisdoes not seem inherently paradoxical. The question here is to do, to an extent,with the typeof desiring – the wayof desiring. Is tajhafor a good object stillpartly akusala? In the ‘way we want’, in the context of tajha, is the way ofwanting what may be problematic? This question will be returned to later.Matthews then cites Nettipakaraja87, which he takes as indicating that tajhamay have a role in moving us towards nibbana, when he writes:This passage lends definite support to the argument that craving fornirvaja was taken to be at least partially beneficial from a soteriologicalpoint of view.296Although he does not state it explicitly here, this indicates that tajhais indeedcapable of assuming a kusalaform, as Nettipakaraja87 states, for as we sawfrom the definition of kusala–akusala, that which moves us towards nibbanaisby definition kusala.This brings us to another important passage in the construction of the notion ofakusalaform of tajha– the Bhikkhuni.sutta. Here a nun seems to offer herselfBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE134"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"sexually to Ananda, and he responds with a moral lesson. In the suttahe arguesthat while craving may be overcome by craving, sexual intercourse is not to beovercome by sexual intercourse:Sister, this body has come into being through food; yet based on food,food can be abandoned. This body has come into being through craving;yet based on craving, craving can be abandoned.297Ananda goes on to say that this does not hold true for sexual intercourse. Thisseems to indicate that tajhacan be used as a basis for the abandoning of tajha.Later in the same sutta, this is elaborated in more detail, where a monk has heardof another who has attained nibbana, and responds thus:Then he thinks, ‘Oh, when shall I too realize the taintless liberation ofmind, liberation by wisdom?’ Then, some time later, based on that crav-ing, he abandons craving. It is on account of this that it was said: ‘Thisbody has come into being through craving; yet based on craving, cravingcan be abandoned.’298Here we have an intriguing picture. The monk here has a tajhafornibbana, andthis moves him to make the spiritual endeavours that lead to the destruction orabandonment of tajha. Note, though, that this abandonment comes some timeafter the tajhafor it. While tajhahas a positive sense here, it is distanced fromthe achievement of the goal. Tajhahere can be an initial spur to moving in theright direction. I am not trying here to dismiss the importance of this passage, forif well-directed tajhacan, even in the long-run, move us towards, rather thanaway from, nibbana, then we are to consider it kusalato some extent,299as thisflows directly from the nature of kusala–akusalaas defined in the introduction.Matthews refers in his discussion of this to K. N. Jayatilleke’sBuddhism andPeace, where Jayatilleke argues that:Here we should distinguish between ‘self-centred desires’ and a so-called‘master-desire’ for nirvaja which ‘is not on the same footing as the firstorder desires.’ The master desire, he adds, eliminates the self centreddesires, until both orders of craving are extinguished in the attainment ofcomplete awareness.300This approach seems initially sensible, but we do need to challenge aspects of it.Why must the ‘master’ form of desire be a tajha-type one? Given what is saidelsewhere in the Canon about tajha, it would seem one of the least suitable formsfor playing such a role.Something such as chandawould seem much more of a likely candidate.Furthermore, it is not wholly clear here how one might go about overcoming the‘master’ desire – it seems qualitatively distinct from the self-centred forms (anotherBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE135"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"reason for not seeing tajhaas the best term for both types of desire), and moreneeds to be said in order to sustain the view of Jayatilleke, as outlined by Matthews.Matthews himself does not seem wholly convinced either, and while admitting ofthe possibility of kusala tajha, is guarded about its spiritual potential:What does need to be emphasized is that the texts nowhere assert thatcraving is an end in itself in the realization of nirvaja. The passages justexamined (D.3.216, Nett. 87, A.2.114301) show that positive (kusala,nissaya) craving can at best be seen as a stepping stone to getting rid ofcraving altogether.302This seems a fairly balanced conclusion, given what has gone before.Robert G. Morrison seems to have a more positive view of tajhaaltogether.His article Two Cheers for Tajha303sets out to:present a more sympathetic view, a view that highlights the wider impli-cations of tajha, and contends that without it there would be no Buddhistspiritual life – no brahmacariyaor ‘pursuit of excellence’ – and thereforeno Buddhas.304He is clearly going much further here than Matthews above. Morrison’s piece isnot just saying ‘maybe tajhacan sometimes be spiritually useful’, for he has amuch grander role for tajhato play.We saw, in previous chapters, the possible metaphysical and creative power ofdesire, and these notions are worth bearing in mind when Morrison claims:To understand tajhaas simply one affect among others would be a mistake.As we shall see, tajhais a term that has cosmic significance, and is bestunderstood as a metaphor that evokes the general condition that unawak-ened beings find themselves in.305This is an approach that Morrison takes seriously, and I will take his argument inthe stages he presents it. He begins, as he must after what he says in the quoteabove, with an attempt to establish this ‘cosmic significance’, through a cosmo-logical perspective. To see how he does this we must return to the Aggañña Sutta,which was mentioned during my discussion of the term saraga. As mentionedearlier, this suttainvolves a situation where the beings of the world fall from a‘higher’ rebirth to a gross or physical form due to desires that arise in them.Morrison sees this as almost-a-creation story, and even goes as far as to comparethe sweet pudding-skin-like earth to the apple in the Biblical ‘fall’ – an object oftemptation.We can see then how tajhamight acquire the cosmological role he wishes toascribe to it. It is, in this view, the engine of creation.306Now, this is deeply res-onant with many of the views I have discussed in relation to Hinduism, but canBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE136"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"we apply it to Buddhism in this way coherently? To an extent we can, but we donot need the Aggañña Suttato help us do it.That existence –bhava– is a result of tajhais manifest in the process of con-ditioned arising.307But why pick out tajha? Why not some of the other factors?As we shall see, Morrison does look at avijja, but why not some other form ofdesire? What is it that leads him to attribute such ‘cosmic’ status to tajha? On theevidence thus far, he does seem to be overstretching the Aggañña Sutta, but hedoes propose further support for his claim based on the omnipresence of tajhawithin conditioned beings. After referring to the presence of tajhain a devaintheAggañña Sutta, he suggests that:Elsewhere, the Buddha declares that tajhais the ‘fuel’ (upadana) thatlinks one life with the next, implying that tajhais the radical conditionfor existing anywhere within the Buddhist cosmos, including its higher,more refined reaches.308This is interesting, and in many ways more substantive a point than that drawnfrom the Aggañña Suttaalone. However, we might question the centrality oftajhahere. It is a key factor in becoming – no sentient being comes to be with-out it. Now, on one level a certain class of beings doesexist without tajha–enlightened beings exist (post their enlightenment, and prior to their death) andare free from tajha, but they would not have come to be without tajha.However, there are other factors involved in the process of becoming, mostnotably avijja. Morrison, as we shall see shortly, does try to establish the primacyoftajhahere; but even if successful, can it stand alone in the manner he seemsto be suggesting? Even if we were to accept the importance of tajhaas a meansof fuelling becoming, which in part is undeniable, this does not mean we are tocheer for tajha. In the Buddhist analysis, being born is not a cause for rejoicing,but is rather a gateway to dukkha. But given the fact of our existence, even if wetake a more cheery approach to life – if we are glad to be alive – should we thanktajhafor that? It would seem that this is the way that Morrison is moving.Morrison continues his attempt to establish a cosmological role for tajha,and does so partly based on A.V.116 where we find Purima, bhikkhave, kotina paññayati bhavatajhaya– ‘Monks, a first point309of craving-to-be cannot beknown’.Morrison goes on to argue that bhava-tajharepresents the primary form oftajha, and that tajhaas an ever-present form, especially given its role in theAggañña Sutta, is a basic cosmological principle. In his view, the Canonicalpassages mentioned here lead to the view that tajhais:understood to be the primal condition out of which all other affects canbe said to develop. Tajha, from this perspective, may be understood asthe all-pervasive and fundamental characteristic of the Buddhist cosmos;itsraison d’être.310BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE137"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"As Morrison wishes to establish that bhava-tajhais in some way tajhaper se,what of kama-tajhaandvibhava-tajha? His first position is to suggest thatbhava-tajhais the most fundamental (‘the most general and basic’)311of thetriad. He tackles kama-tajhafirst:Kama-tajhais ‘thirsting’ after specifically sensual experiences and is,therefore, an aspect of the more general bhava-tajha, which is ‘thirsting’afteranyform of being or experience – it is simply the urge to be, or,more correctly, to become(bhava).312I am not sure we need go along with such a view. First, can we just place all sen-sual experience in so easily with bhava-tajha? It seems to me that while bhava-tajharepresents the craving to be, kama-tajhamore accurately represents thedesire to have – be it an object, or an experience derived from interaction with aphysical object.313We did see, in Freud and Schopenhauer to an extent, as well asin parts of Chapter 2, the view that all individual instances of desiring derive fromsome general and primal form of desire, but can we here apply it to Buddhistthought with regard to tajha? Morrison gives no further substantial support inmaking this claim, and I remain unconvinced that bhava-tajhawould be the besttype of desire with which to advance such a proposal.If we come to his claim that bhava-tajhaontologically precedes vibhava-tajha, he argues his case thus:If we assume that existence does not inherently involve a Freudian‘Death Wish’, then the third tajha, vibhava-tajhaor ‘thirst for non-existence’, is more likely to be the outcome of the continual frustrationofbhava-tajhaandkama-tajha, and is therefore a secondary andderived state.314There are a number of things to take issue with here. If we look at how I definedvibhava-tajhaearlier, we do not have to see it as a ‘Death Wish’ – we can see itas a craving based on an annihilationist world-view, and bhava-tajhaas based onan eternalist world-view.315Why does this make one more primary than the other?Furthermore, the desire to avoid the unpleasant, another way to view vibhava-tajha, does not seem of necessity derived from frustration. Desires to avoid theunpleasant or seek the pleasant do not seem appropriately placed in an ontologi-cal hierarchy. The view Morrison advances here seems based on a partial misun-derstanding of the nature of the three types of tajha. Finally, on this matter, evenwere Morrison successful in making the case for bhava-tajhaastajhaper se,and by extension, based on A.V.116, the case that the start of tajhacould not befound, what would this actually tell us? We are not informed that other mentalfactors dohave a beginning that can be known.Morrison’s claim is that other effects flow from tajha– it precedes them – andeven were he able to demonstrate that no beginning to tajhacan be known, heBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE138"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"would also have to show that a beginning couldbe found for those things which hebelieves to be effects of this primal tajha. On tajhaas cosmological principle, onthe basis of the above discussion, I remain rather unconvinced.Morrison continues in his discussion of tajhaalong a line not dissimilar to thatof Matthews, in that tajhacan be seen as a spiritual tool, viewing the roots ofGotama’s Noble search as rooted in tajha. While it may be the case that a tajhadesire may lead to a quest that later becomes Noble and ultimately goes beyondalltajha, does this indicate that all religious striving originates in tajha? This isthe case only if we see tajhaas desire per se. If we see it as one form of desireamong many, then this need not be the case. Morrison’s desire to redeem or reha-bilitatetajhawould make sense if and only if there were no other forms of desir-ing available. Were his attempt to make tajhaa metaphysical principlesuccessful, he would indeed need to establish the centrality of tajhato thespiritual quest.In arguing for the necessity of tajhaas a force likely to motivate us towardsnibbana, Morrison might initially seem to make the same mistake as those whoassert that Buddhism recommends the end of all desiring. Morrison sees tajhaasthe whole story regarding desire in Buddhism. He has a point regarding the veryoutset of the spiritual journey: that grasping after spiritual truth is better thangrasping after the suffering of one’s enemies. It is tempting to suggest that such aview is rather close to the Mahayana notion of ‘skilful means’, but the Pali textsare not without evidence of a similar approach. While the notion of ‘skill inmeans’ is developed greatly in later thought, we do find the Buddha engagingin ‘graduated teachings’,316and other episodes in the texts supply examples of‘skill in means’.317Further, things do not have to be the worst of all possible in order to be dis-couraged. Punching my doctoral supervisor on the nose is wicked, no doubt. Fewwould disagree that it is better than killing 20 students by bombing a canteen.Given that, however, this does not constitute grounds for saying ‘Two Cheers forPunching Doctoral Supervisors’. Were tajhathe only form of desiring availableto the Buddhist, Morrison would be convincing – but it is not. Morrison alsomakes a number of points regarding the relationship of tajhaand views, ditthi,which I address in Chapter 4.Having spent some time looking at tajha, what conclusions can be drawnabout it? The possibility of kusala-tajhais intriguing, and to an extent seemsacceptable, but it is – if we continue to view the kusala–akusaladistinction assomething akin to a spectrum – only just kusala. It is something we can utilise,but that which can surely only carry us so far. If we are to continue with the pre-vious imagery, it seems like a type of desire which will soon need abandoning, orat least transforming into some other, more kusala, type to carry us much furthertowards nibbana. Towards the end of this section, it begins to seem as if the pre-scription for tajhais re-orientation and re-direction. This clearly relates in manyways to the objects of desires, but the problem with tajhais more than just itsobject. Clearly, also, if the goal is to overcome all craving then we cannot surelyBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE139"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"be seeing tajhain too positive a light. Maybe we are, to tajha, to see ourselvesas malign hitch-hikers – letting tajhacarry us forward, only to finally reveal thatwe have used it to later annihilate it.Conclusion: landscapes of desireWe have seen throughout this chapter the notion that desire, in certain forms, canform a part of the Buddhist spiritual path. We saw the notion of a desire for deliv-erance. While Muccitukamyataseems post-Canonical in its development, the ideasit draws upon run throughout the suttas, and we have seen many of them here.Some desires, such as tajha, seem in need of undermining fairly early on thepath to nibbana,318but we may see forms of striving, which are rather akin todesires, leading us right to the brink of nibbana. In its role in the ‘bases of suc-cess’,chandacan play its part also in such a process. Only when there is nothingleft to achieve, once that which is to be done has been done, only then need westrive no more.319Returning to themes introduced at the beginning of this chapter, we saw thatthe ‘desire for the Self ’ found in Hinduism was either inappropriate, or at the veryleast problematic, in a Buddhist context.How is desire related to anatta? This is a topic that has been mentioned a lit-tle, but that needs further comment – some of which will be found in the nextchapter, and in the conclusion. It is clear that there needs to be some assessmentof the relationship between the Self and desire. In Buddhist terms this is whatI am doing in both this and Chapter 4. I am laying out how desire operates in thecomponents that go to make up our empirical Self. A Vedic thinker might demandmore, as may a Western metaphysician. Their demand might be that I address notthe factors of personhood, but the relation of desire to the Self itself, what wemight call the Self-in-itself. Now, clearly it is just such a Self-in-itself that anattaopposes.320In proposing the anattadoctrine, we are left with only the khandhas, and I havebegun to partially outline the relation of desire to the khandhas; Chapter 4 willdeal more explicitly with this topic, when desire is placed into the context of themind–body relationship. However, if there is no atta-type Self to relate to desire,there is still more to do than just understanding how desire is to be found operat-ing within the khandhas.If we propose that both the belief in a Self and the occurrence of negative(akusala) desire spring, ultimately, from the same root, from avijja, then we needto consider desire (and notions of Self ) in the light of Buddhist understandings onopinion and belief – how ignorance and wrong-views can be removed, and howthis process relates to the refining and ultimate overcoming of desire. This is oneof the key goals in Chapter 4.One key point worth making here concerns how desire and anattarelate to oneanother. Both are about ‘lack’ or ‘absence’. Desire, often, involves that whichwe are without;321anattatells us that our within is without anything permanent,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE140"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"stable or reliable. Might the belief that our desires really can be fulfilled beanalogous to the belief that we really are an entity which endures over time andhas some sort of essence or true underlying nature? Clearly both views fail torecognise the mutability of existence, anicca.In the light of the discussions in this chapter, what has been achieved? The mostobvious conclusion one can draw regards the complexity of the Buddhist view ofdesire found in the Pali Canon. As demonstrated in this chapter, desire isconceived of in numerous ways and these differing conceptions have varyingstatuses, going well beyond the notions of good and bad desires being for goodand bad objects respectively.The main concern I have had here is with the kusalastatus of desires. Why amI so interested in the kusalastatus of desires? We can recall from the Introductionthatkusalastates of mind propel us away from dukkhaand towards nibbana.Surely the true worth of a mind-state is the manner in which it moves us eithertowards or away from misery and suffering. Furthermore, in the Buddhist view-point ethics, ontology and epistemology merge.Actions – inclusive of mind-states – have particular consequences (be theykammic or due to other aspects of paticca-samuppada); these actions make senseonly when a full ontological picture is taken into account, as it is due to the natureof the universe – the manner in which it is occupied by inter-related entities – thatthese events have their particular results; and only through wisdom and knowledgecan we become cognisant of the effects of our actions (again, mental included) anddevelop the means to effect successful interventions in the processes of our desir-ing. It is just these process-mechanics that I investigate in Chapter 4.There are two interpretations of the diverse representations of desire we find inthe Canonical texts which I wish to reject. One is that the Canon is a jumble withregard to desire. That the lack of immediate clarity is the result of an essentialconfusion in early Buddhist thought over the nature of desire. Despite somevariant and occasionally befuddling passages, there is also much consistency andsubtle debate. The second is the contrary to this – that we have in the Pali Canona complete, coherent and comprehensive typology of desire. Would that it were so!Not only is there the occasional aforementioned confusion, but more than this,there is still evidence of the tensions which characterised the Hindu material dis-cussed in Chapter 2. The debates surrounding the kusalastatus of tajhaare alonesufficient to demonstrate this.The Pali Canon does notfully resolve these tensions, but it does seem to go along way towards it. While its typology is imperfect and incomplete, it shows thepossibilities of such a scheme. It would be an ambitious undertaking, whereby allpossible manifestations of desire were analysed, classified and assessed. Indeed,whether the approach were explicitly Buddhist, psychological or syncretistic, itmay prove that the fluid and dynamic nature of consciousness would never allowsuch a schema to be placed over it. Nonetheless, the Buddhist material examinedhere, with its own dynamic meditation-based response to desire, offers thespiritual aspirant, who would engage with their desires, much to go on.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE141"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"With regard to desire then, the Canon may not be the resolution of all tensionsand the repository of ultimate wisdom, but maybe it can be a signpost; a pointertowards views of desire which enrich and deepen our lives – rather than being theenemy of happiness against which we must enter constant battle mindful of theinevitability of defeat. While the next chapter addresses many of the issues arisingout of the material in this chapter, it is already clear that rather than a ‘paradox ofdesire’, Buddhism offers us a partial map.The world of our experience isin some senses made by desire – this we haveseen. There seems less metaphysics in the Buddhist approach than the Hindu, andwe should expect this. Buddhism is suspicious of much metaphysics, but wishesinstead to present us with the means of interacting in positive ways with the desire-carved topography of existence. The Buddhist texts examined above can be seen torepresent an ethical cartography, something by which to seek and navigate a paththrough the landscapes of desire which represent the world of lived-experience.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: VARIETIES OF DESIRE142"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"When things become manifestTo the ardent contemplating brahmin,He abides scattering Mara’s HostLike the sun illuminating the sky1IntroductionAs we move into this chapter, it is worth pausing for a moment to consider thestage we have reached thus far. My attempt to establish a coherent and consistenttypology of desire as found in the Pali Canon has been partially successful. Wehave seen a variety of terms and the varieties of their usage, but the picture is notalways as clear as it might be, and many terms that seem in places to be inherentlyakusalaare used on other occasions in a more positive sense.We might read this as sheer inconsistency, but there is another approach. Analternative interpretation is to consider this as indicative of the possibilities of trans-mutation. This clearly echoes material discussed in Chapter 2, where the tensionbetween notions of the removal and transformation of desire is often felt. Thepicture in Buddhism is not so simple. It would seem that there are two threads inthis, the treating of desire-terms as generally akusala, but occasionally more kusala.First, we can see the variation of a desire-types’kusalastatus, as the afore-mentioned potential of the transformation of desire. Second, we might also seeit as recognising a qualitative distinction between two fundamentally differenttypesof desire – but ones where the difference is hard to discern from outside ofthe individual concerned. This typology is not, as I have indicated, fully devel-oped and coherent. However, one can discern in the Pali Canon the beginningsof such a typology.The possibility of a typology of desire is complicated by the notion of the trans-formation of desire.2Ifakusalaforms of desire are capable of being transmuted,via spiritual endeavours, into kusalaforms, then a typology distinguishing inher-ently kusalaforms from akusalaforms is not needed. However, neither approachis fully developed. Rather we get a taste of both, the two overlapping at times, andelsewhere one of these two approaches seems presented as the key one. It is the4BUDDHISM AND DESIREThe dynamics of desire143"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"purpose of this chapter, in part, to disentangle these threads. In seeking thisclarification, the possibility is left open that no such overall clarity is possible.This may prove to be the case for a number of reasons, but two seem most likely.First, the compilers of the Canon may have left us an entangled picture. Desireis so deeply part of our being in the world, that unravelling its multiple threadsand their relations with each other, and other aspects of Buddhist Dhamma, maybe nigh impossible: the Canon may just be unclear on this matter.The other possibility here is that the ideal of desirelessness is incapable ofbeing captured by words. While this strategy has then the danger of being seen asopportunist, it may be viable in this context. For one who has attained nibbana,desire – as we understand it as unenlightened beings – does not occur.The wishes and aspirations of a tathagatamay be so different in their very naturethat there is no fully accurate and complete way to convey them in words. Thismight lead to the adopting of two strategies. First, the drawing of analogies betweensuch desires and transformed versions of the desires we dohave; second, the iden-tifying of the less akusalaforms of desire that are part of the psycho-emotionalspectrum available to the unenlightened.This does seem a useful approach, and may have some mileage in it, but it isnot a complete solution to these tensions and concerns. It may be the case thatsuch a relation could exist between the aspirations of a tathagataand the desiresof a puthujjana, but what of the right-desires of the ‘noble ones’ on the path, butwho have not yet reached the goal? Can we view their kusala-desires as more likethe wishes of a tathagatathan those of a person not on the Path at all? Maybe wecan draw, at least, an analogy between the two. However, this needs not only anunderstanding of paticca-samuppada, but also may only be fully coherent froma more lofty spiritual perspective than I am here able to offer.It may be that a notion that may reconcile these two notions of the ‘removal’ ofdesire, and its ‘transmutation’ is that of its ‘refining’. In the notion of ‘refining’desire, we may be able to elaborate a notion of change that encompasses both theremoval of akusaladesireandits transformation – as well as proving compatiblewith the partial typology uncovered thus far. A refined form of desire would havehad its more akusalaaspects removed, and hence appear transformed. A distinc-tion we might draw between refiningandtransformingis that refining might indi-cate the removal of akusalaelements of desire, while transforming might initiallyindicate the changing of the objects of desire, followed by a change in the tone ofthe desire, until it begins to lose its akusalaaspects, and we can then consider theprocess of refining to have begun.Furthermore, various types of desire would require relatively more or lessamounts of refining in order to achieve the status of a fully refined, wholly kusalamental state – at which point they could be described as having been transcended.This approach will be assessed again at the close of this chapter, to see if it canbe maintained in the light of what is said here about the role of desire in paticca-samuppadaand the mind–body relationship. I will further seek to see ifthe understanding of ‘views’ that emerges here has any impact on this claim.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE144"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"In examining the role desire plays in paticca-samuppada,I was initiallyinclined to describe such an analysis as the unearthing of a Buddhist psychologyof desire. Upon further reflection, I became a little ambivalent about describing itin such a manner.In some ways, it may be that the approach of paticca-samuppadais deeplypsychological; uncovering, as it does, the operation of consciousness and relatedstates. However paticca-samuppadais broader in scope. It encompasses a fulleraccount of causality than the purely mental, and – as will be discussed in thischapter – offers a philosophical insight into the nature of mind–body relationsnormally lacking in what is classed as ‘psychology’. An investigation of desire willby its nature tend towards the more psychological aspects of paticca-samuppada.However, it is not bordered and enclosed in as specific, formal and hard-edgeda manner as terming it a ‘psychology of desire’ would imply.What we can see occurring in this chapter, though, is a focussing in on themicro-level of the operation of desire. This is why I have described this chapteras investigating the ‘dynamics’ of desire. Previously I have been working with abroad metaphysical canvas, looking at a macro-level understanding of desire. Inlooking, inspired in part by Hindu approaches, at the cosmological significanceof desire we have seen the notion of desire as creative. What has begun to emerge,though, is the notion that this creation occurs in terms of our consciousness play-ing a key part in this creative drama. In order to see what is happening in relationto desire in this macro-level process, we need to investigate the Buddhist accountof its root causes. These roots lie within us. Within us are the tools by which wecraft the world we inhabit. As such, desire may be a rude and clumsy tool for theforging of our experienced world, but also – I am led to think by what has beenexamined in Chapter 3 – it may be a more precise and subtle instrument. Theinvestigation into paticca-samuppadain this chapter is for the purpose of uncoveringthis dynamics of desire.While my intent here is more academic than therapeutic, such an investigationshould provide an insight into how we might become more skilled practitionersof wanting. If desire is one of the key means by which we fashion our livedexperience of the world, this may give us the necessary means to build aworld-of-experience less drenched in misery, stress and frustration.This chapter, then, begins by examining paticca-samuppada, and then moveson to assess the role played in the paticca-samuppadaprocesses by desire. Therole of desire goes beyond the presence of tajhaas a nidanain the twelve-foldformula of paticca-samuppada, and I attempt to look at both the causes and con-sequences of this role in the processes of conditioning. This leads me to a concernwith the mind–body relationship.While some desires might be fairly considered as wholly occurring within themind, many – arguably most – are for external objects, although the desire is still,of course, within the mind. Desire for an external object may be deemed as a formof the mind reaching out into the world – desire acting as a bridge between theinternal and external.

I will move on from this to look at an element ofmental life that has striking similarities to the Buddhist view of desire, in the waythat it is understood in Buddhism: views. This may seem an odd topic to addressat this stage, but on closer inspection it becomes evident that its akusala/kusalastatus and the way it is discussed seems to echo the discourse on desire that I haveoutlined.4By the end of this chapter I will be in a position to try and establish an overallview of desire in the Pali Canon. This summative overview will be given inChapter 5, where I shall also seek to engage this final picture in a dialogue withthe various perspectives on desire outlined in the first two chapters of the book.The nature of paticca-samuppadaWere we in any doubt regarding the significance of paticca-samuppadawithin Buddhist thought, we would find a stark assessment of its importance intheMahahatthipadopama Sutta, where Sariputta places the following wordsin the mouth of the Buddha:5One who sees6Conditioned Arising, sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees Conditioned Arising.7Here understanding of paticca-samuppadaand understanding of the Dhammaingeneral are seen as synonymous. To understand the true nature of things is tounderstand the manner in which things are related – this makes good sense, atleast once we are familiar with the notion of paticca-samuppada. But just what ispaticca-samuppada?Paticca-samuppadais a common notion in Pali Canonical texts, and probablythe most widespread translation is as ‘Conditioned Arising’, or as ‘DependentOrigination’. But what are we to take it to mean? The basic formula used toexpress the notion of paticca-samuppadais found at M.I.262–3 as:When this exists, that comes to be;With the arising of this, that arises.8The formula is completed a little later in this sutta, when we have the summary ofpaticca-samuppadawith regard to cessation, following the one above of arising:When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.9BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE146"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"This begins to give us a sense of it. Paticca-samuppadacan be, at least in a broadsense, seen to represent the Buddhist notion of causality. That is, paticca-samuppadaoffers an explanation of the causal relations between the components of reality.10If we turn to the PED, we see paticca-samuppadadefined as:‘arising on the grounds of (preceding cause)’11happening by way ofa cause, working of cause & effect, causal chain of causation; causalgenesis, dependent origination.12David Kalupahana explains his understanding of paticca-samuppada, while alsoconcurring with the aforementioned view of its centrality:The Buddha claimed that his search for the nature of things led him tothe discovery of the uniformity of the causal process...It was the knowl-edge of the causal pattern that enabled him to put an end to all defilingtendencies and thereby attain freedom (vimutti).13The most striking phrase here is ‘uniformity of the causal process’. It is clear thatpaticca-samuppadarefers to causality, but in what does its ‘uniformity’ consist?The uniformity referred to here is surely the universality of its application. Thenotion of Conditioned Arising applies to all non-nibbanic experience andphenomena. All mental and physical aspects of reality are seen as operatingaccording to this ‘uniform’ causal process. Not only does it explain how thingscome to be and end, but it does so without the need of reference to God, brahman,an underlying atta –Self – or any other such metaphysical entity.Paticca-samuppada,however, should not be taken as purely indicating aprocess of cause and effect. This is what makes it so subtle a notion – both obvi-ous and difficult at the same time. That things come about due to causes seems,on first glance, obvious – almost a truism. What makes it a notion which is thebasis of meditation, and seen as complex and hard to grasp, is that it calls on noexternal aspect. There is no first cause, and no guiding agency. Furthermore, it isnot a teleological principle – it has no aim. The reason things come into being isthat certain conditions necessary for such an arising have been fulfilled – nothingmore, nothing less. Describing it in this manner makes it seem highly reductive,but as I hope emerges in this chapter, it varies in many ways from the brand ofreductionism associated with Western science.14Adding to this lack of metaphysical necessity, having only conditional necessity,is that paticca-samuppadacannot be seen purely as cause and effect because it –despite some common misinterpretations – does not ascribe effects to singlecauses. Discussing the twelve-fold nidanaformula (which I address shortlybelow), Peter Harvey makes this multiplicity of causes, or plurality of causeswhich need to be fulfilled, clear:A standard formula of twelve nidanasis most common, but there arealso variations on this, which emphasize the contribution of otherBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE147"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"conditions. These variations show that the ‘that’ of the abstract formula15is not a single determining cause, but a major condition, one of several.Each is a necessary condition for the arising of ‘this’, but none is alonesufficient for this to happen.16If we need extra confirmation of this claim by Harvey, we can find Buddhaghosamaking the point that the process of ‘arising’ is not a matter of single causes andresults:Here there is no single or multiple fruit of any kind from a single cause, nora single fruit from multiple causes, but only multiple fruit from multiplecauses.17But if this is so, does this not undermine the whole twelve-nidana paticca-samuppadaprocess? Buddhaghosa goes on to explain why it is that the Buddhagives such an explanation:For the Blessed One employs one representative cause and fruit when it issuitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to suit the idiosyn-crasies of those susceptible to being taught. And he does so in someinstances because it is a basic factor, and in some instances because it isthe most obvious, and in some instances because it is not common to all.18This makes the whole picture much clearer, if not simpler. What the paticca-samuppadaformula expresses is an understanding of the process which might bebest described as ‘functional’. It identifies the main causes, the obvious ones –including, in an important sense – the ones we can do something about. TheBuddha’s teaching of paticca-samuppadawas not a lecture in philosophy forthe curious, but the unfolding of a method to achieve a goal. With this in mind,we need not take Buddhaghosa’s comments as unsettling or undermining what isfound in the paticca-samuppadaformulae throughout the Canon.So,paticca-samuppadais to be understood as a universal and uniform explanationof ‘the functioning of phenomena’.19However, as we might expect, given the prag-matic focus of Buddhist concern, this notion is applied with the greatest intensity onthe process of how we come to be reborn in this world of pain, misery and frustration.This most widespread application of the principle of paticca-samuppadaconcerns the aforementioned twelve-fold nidanaformula. It is clearly going to beuseful here as we can see that tajha, and other relevant terms, crop up within it.It is stated at numerous points in the Canon, such as in the MahatajhasankhayaSutta. I discuss some of the links in more detail later in this chapter, but give thetwelve-fold formula now as the basis for an understanding of paticca-samuppada:So, monks, with ignorance as condition formations arise; with formationsas condition consciousness arises; with consciousness as condition,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE148"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"mind-and-body arise; with mind-and-body as condition, the six sense-basesarise; with the six sense-bases as condition, contact arises; with contact ascondition, feeling arises; with feeling as condition, craving arises; withcraving as condition, grasping arises; with grasping as condition, becom-ing arises; with being as condition, birth arises; with birth as condition,ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, grief and despair cometo be. This is the means by which this entire mass of dukkhacomes to be.20Here we have a formula beginning with spiritual ignorance, and leading us,through these various elements, to the unpleasant circumstances in which we nowfind ourselves. Unless we attain nibbana, this gives us a picture of our past,present and future.Within this process, the most obvious concern in this current context is theappearance of tajhaat link number eight. Tajhaarises dependent on vedana–feeling. It is in response to incoming (and internal) sensation that tajhacomesabout (although in the light of other conditions as well). Tajhaacts as a primarycondition for the arising of upadana– attachment or grasping. Feeling is relianton the contact of sense with sense-objects. The stages prior to this can be seen asrequiring some explanation. That the six-sense bases rely upon our possession ofmind-and-body (namarupa) is fairly clear, but how are we to understand thatnamarupais reliant on consciousness?Such a connection has to be seen in the context of the Buddhist notion ofrebirth, and accounts of how one comes to be. In the production of namarupa, wecan see viññajaas that which allows their development in the womb, as we cansee put explicitly in the Mahanidana sutta:‘I have said “Consciousness conditions mind-and-body.”. . . If consciousnesswere not to come into the mother’s womb, would mind-and-bodydevelop there?’‘No, Lord.’21Here we can see how it is that the presence or arrival of viññajais a prime conditionfornamarupa’s development. When there is the appropriate union of the father andmother of a child, at the appropriate time, there still needs to be viññajapresent forconception to occur. The term usually used is not viññajathough, but the being tobe reborn: the gandhabba.22Can we see viññajaas the link between conscious-nesses – between lives? David Kalupahana, with reference to D.II.62f, claims:All this is evidence that it is consciousness that serves as a connectinglink between two lives, and this, of course, is unequivocally stated in theearly Buddhist texts.23Kalupahana goes on to cite D.III.105, where one of the attainments discussed isthe ability to view viññaja-sota24– the moving from one life on to another inBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE149"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"other sentient beings. The connecting of life-to-life by viññaja, then, makesreasonable sense in the context of the paticca-samuppadaformula outlined above.25Furthermore, consciousness (viññaja) continues to condition namarupathroughout life. We can see this with relation to the young, as D.II.62–3 continuesfrom the passage cited above:‘And if consciousness of such a tender young being, boy or girl, werethus cut off, would mind-and-body grow, develop and mature?’‘No Lord.’‘Therefore,Ananda, just this, namely consciousness, is the root, thecause, the origin, the condition of mind-and-body.’26As Harvey states, ‘This shows that discernment27conditions the sentient body notonly in the womb, but also during life.’28The relationship of viññajaandnamarupais, as with paticca-samuppadarelations in general, complex, and at times the con-ditioning can be seen to be mutual. We can see this in the Mahapadana sutta, whereVipassi,29as a bodhisattaprior to his attaining Buddhahood, is reflecting on theprocesses of paticca-samuppada:Then indeed, monks, the bodhisatta Vipassithought this:‘What now would it be for consciousness not to exist, the cessation ofwhat brings about the cessation of consciousness?’Then indeed, monks, through wise attention the following insight cameto be known to the bodhisatta Vipassi:‘Through there not being mind-and-body, consciousness does not exist,the cessation of mind-and-body leads to the cessation of consciousness.’30This is a reversal of the normal approach, and indeed in the text follows the moreusual assertion that namarupais then dependent on viññaja. The two views arenot in tension though, for rather we might see their conditioning relationship asmutual. We might think that this is partly so because viññajais surely part ofnamato an extent, albeit an aspect thereof able to be understood separately fromthenama-rupacomplex. However, this does not seem to be the case. Viññajadoes not seem to be part of namarupa.As Harvey states:namarefers to those non-physical states of a person, apart fromdiscernment [viññaja], which are always present, thus comprising basicsentience.31He goes on to outline how viññajarelates to the namaaspects of a person:For the ‘early Suttas’, then, the most important dividing line withinpersonality was not that between the non-physical (arupa) and thephysical, but between discernment and the rest of personality, mentalBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE150"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"and physical: the ‘sentient body’ (kayaornama-rupa), of whichdiscernment is seen as the ‘lord’.32Issues raised by this will be explored further when I come to the mind–bodyrelationship later in this chapter.In looking here at the notion of paticca-samuppada, we have been able to seethe manner in which this process is seen as operating. I could explore theprocesses of paticca-samuppadafurther, but this would be a major undertaking,and I need here to retain my focus on desire. What is important in the currentcontext is to see how desire fits into this picture.Desire and paticca-samuppadaClearly, the most obvious role of desire in the paticca-samuppadaprocess is thatplayed by tajhaas one of the nidanas. We saw previously that tajhaaroseconditioned by feeling, and itself acted as the primary condition for the arising of‘attachment’. While this makes sense, it is best viewed in the context of theoverall definition of tajhain the Pali texts.Why does this need addressing again here? Because if we consider thefeeling–craving link, we might be tempted to speculate that there is a problemhere. For indeed many feelings can be clearly seen to link to the arising of arelated desire, but can all? Clearly the link can be broken, such that we do notrespond to the feelings we derive from our sensory contact with the world in suchanakusalamanner. But even leaving that aside, might not some feelings lead toresponses other than desire or craving? While a pleasant feeling may lead to acraving for the pleasant object, an unpleasant feeling may well be more likely toillicit aversion to something, rather than a craving for it. We find this in texts suchas the Chachakka Sutta:When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one sorrows, grieves andlaments, weeps beating one’s breast and becomes distraught, then theunderlying tendency to aversion lies within one.33This is why we need to return to the three classes of craving enumerated in the tex-tual accounts of tajha. In Chapter 3, I cited the three types of tajhaas found innumerous locations, including the Mahasatipatthana sutta,askama-tajha,bhava-tajhaandvibhava-tajha.34We can see how a pleasant feeling may well lead tokama-tajha, but what of an unpleasant feeling? Perhaps the best way to understandthe aversion that such a feeling is likely to arouse is as vibhava-tajha.While we maynot, on a surface level of consciousness, experience aversion as ‘craving for non-being’, we might also see the broader scope of vibhava-tajhaas including the desireto avoid things we dislike, to be free from painful or difficult circumstances.35The feeling however does not, of necessity, have to lead to any of these formsoftajha, for the feeling itself is not identical with the craving. It is at just suchBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE151"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"a point that we can plainly see the scope for meditative interventions. While theoverall process of paticca-samuppadacan be addressed – especially its root ofavijja– it is this response to the feelings generated by sensory interaction thatwould seem most open to our own interactive manipulation via meditation.This is a critical stage of the process. When phassa(contact, stimulation)occurs in relation to one or more of the six sense bases, we have, as it were, anincoming sensory occurrence (even if from the non-rupasense-base of mano).What is then generated within us at this stage is vedana– a feeling, whether ofpleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain. It is with this as condition that wehave the arising of the key stage here – the arising of tajha.This makes clear thatit is how we respond to vedanathat is critical.36Indeed, Lama Anagarika Govindacautions us against seeing vedanaas leading, of necessity, to tajha:Sensation (vedana) is not the ‘cause’ of craving (tajha) and still less iscraving the necessary consequence of sensation.37We have the opportunity to step aside from our habitual responses, to prevent ourresponse leading on to upadana(attachment, grasping, clinging), and to find ameans of responding to sensory input that does not lead to attached states of mindtowards the objects of experience. Of course, by ‘sensory input’ here we mustcontinue to understand this as a broader notion than that of, say, A. J. Ayer’s ideaof ‘sense datum’,38for the six sense bases represent this wider idea of the fivephysical, or conventional, senses along with the idea of mano, ‘mind-organ’.What is intriguing here is just how manooperates in this context. It is notmerely a receptacle for the empirical world – it is not a bucket into which thesenses are poured, and although ‘mind’ will be addressed in more detail later inthis chapter, we need to understand here its role within the idea of the sense-bases.We could see it in terms of being a set of mental events which we become awareof,39but how does this link with the idea of the arising of phassabased on it?Were one to take such a view – that manois the sense that perceives the mentalcontent, separate from mano– there might well be the danger that one would thenbegin to think of a Self which is distinct from mano, where the mind is the objectexperienced with a discrete Self as the subject. This is too fragmented a view forthe approach taken in the Pali Buddhist approach. Not only is there the dangerhere of developing an erroneous atta-ditthi, but also, as will be demonstratedlater, the holistic or integrated approach to mental functioning taken in the textsopposes such a distinction.We may do better to see the role of manoin a different light. Rather thantreating it as an equal member of the six sense bases, we might view it as havinganother role. We might view manoin the role of integrating the five senses into aexperiential whole. Here mind is what transforms the complex jumble of rapidlyarriving sense-data (here Ayer’s notion seems more appropriate) into the experi-ence of the senses that the person is subjected to. While manoalso has objects ofits own, concepts, memories and the like, we might, if of a Kantian bent, say thatBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE152"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"manois what turns the interaction of the world of noumenaand our senses intothat which we experience as the phenomenalworld. Harvey suggests this veryrole for mano:Buddhism emphasizes that, whatever the external physical world is like,the ‘world’ of our actual lived experience is one built up from the inputof the five senses, interpreted by the mind-organ.40Heremanohas a role quite distinct from that of the other sense bases. It is, then,through the interaction of this complete ‘perceiving system’ that we develop thevedanathat craving is a response to. The MLD translation of the Samma-ditthisutta– wherein the six sense bases are enumerated – has an interesting explanatorynote on the nature and role of manoin this context:Mind-base (manayatana) is a collective term for all classes of consciousness. One part of this base – the ‘life continuum’ (bhavanga)or subliminal consciousness – is the ‘door’ for the arising of mind-consciousness.41Here we get a view which seems, if not at odds with that of Harvey, at least witha different emphasis. But what do they mean here by ‘mind consciousness’?Mind consciousness (mano-viññaja) comprises all consciousnessexcept the five types of sense consciousness just mentioned. It includesconsciousness of mental images, abstract ideas, and internal states ofmind,42as well as the consciousness in reflection upon sense objects.43So, if the ear-base leads to ear-consciousness (as is frequently said in the suttas),44we might expect the mind-base to lead to this notion of mind-consciousness.There may be problems with this view though. First, and most obviously, viññajaprecedes the sense bases in the twelve-fold formula of conditioned arising.However, we do not need to see the formula of conditioned arising in severelylinear form. While viññajain general may arise at an earlier point in the process,these specific types of viññajado seem dependent on the presence of the sensebases for their arising. Furthermore, this sequence is not followed slavishly inthe texts themselves. As Bruce Matthews points out when he is arguing against theview (of E. R. Saratchandra) that viññaja’s early place in the sequence impliesthat it possesses a narrow meaning of just ‘sensation’. Matthews sees the twelve-foldsequence in broader terms:Saratchandra’s notion that the traditional cause and effect sequence offactors prevents viññajafrom bearing a developed sense of consciousnessseems to reflect an excessively mechanistic view of the sequence.45BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE153"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Matthews goes on to point to passages such as M.I.293 where viññajaappearslater in the sequence.46Second, seeing manoas just another ‘sense-organ’ seems to leave out thenotion of manoas an integrating principle of experience. Furthermore, as sug-gested above, what is it that has47the experience of manoviññaja? If we were tosee the five rupabases as integrated by the manayatana, it would follow that thefive consciousnesses arising from them might be likewise integrated bymanoviññaja, but this is not really the issue. The key point here is to avoid a toosimplistic view of the nature of mano,as Matthews suggests:misunderstanding also arises from an inadequate appreciation of the roleofmanoas a ‘sixth sense’ in Buddhism....But although manois one ofthe senses, it must be emphasized that, in a special way, it is more thanthis;manois the ‘integrator’ or matrix of the other senses.48It is this more holistic49and integrated approach to the role of manothat seemsthe most sustainable. Indeed the use of manoin the Pali texts does give it thiswider role. At M.I.191 it is attributed a role sitting between the existence of asense object and the experience of it; that is, manois what leads from a raw pieceof external reality to our conscious experience thereof:when internally the mind is intact and external mind-objects come into itsrange and there is the corresponding (conscious) engagement, then thereis the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness.50However, it is worth noting that the text also gives parallel statements on the fivesenses as well: about the eye, the ear and the like. However, that does not preventus from seeing manoas a sensory organiser, as well as a sensory-receptor formind-objects. What is also revealing of the role of manois that it is, unlike othersense-organs, in need of special levels of ‘guarding’ or mindfulness. All thesense-doors need ‘guarding’, but manoseems in need of particular attention. Wecan see this in the Dhammapada:One should guard against agitation of the mind,one’s mind should be of good conduct,giving up bad-conduct of the mind,one should be of good-conduct of the mind.51Here the mind is seen as capable of good and bad conduct – much more thana mere organ of the senses.R. E. A. Johansson offers a detailed analysis of manowherein he asks a number ofquestions. In response to asking ‘Ismanoconsciousness?’ he observes that while it isgiven as a ‘sense’, passages such as Sn. 83452indicate its capability for thought, lead-ing him to the conclusion that ‘Manois therefore a center for conscious processes.’53BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE154"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Johansson goes on to offer support for the integrating of sensory experience asa key role for mano, arguing that manoresponds in such a way as to be thisintegrator, or as he puts it:Manois, therefore, a coordinating center for the other senses, andperhaps an instrument for recollecting past events (\u0001memory).54This matches with what has been argued above, but this notion of manoas ameans of accessing or recalling memories is interesting. One presumes that thisis when this integrative instrument is turned at inward data – and makes sense ofprior impression – away from its usual role of marshalling its resources to offeran integrated view of new, incoming impressions.If we see the notion of a ‘mind-door’ process alongside that of the other fivesense-door processes, this may give an insight into the nature of mano. Whilethere is not the space here to get drawn into the complex ways in whichAbhidhammaunderstands the perceptual process,55it may be useful in onerespect. In seeking to see how manosits alongside the other five senses, we mightlearn more by seeing what the objects that enter consciousness through the minddoor are. That is, who comes knocking at the mind-door? At numerous places, wesee that it is a mental object, as Lance Cousins reminds us:But what is the object at the mind door? Traditionally it may be any kindof object – past, present or future, purely conceptual or even transcen-dent. In the normal case, however, it will be either a memory of the pastor some kind of concept.56This gives us a further sense of the manner in which manois seen to operate;manois not only a means to process raw sensory data, but also a means by whichmental objects are dealt with.Manothen has a key and varied role. It is involved in perception, that much isquite obvious, but it also needs focussing on in relation to the notion of ‘heedfulattention’. As Johansson suggests, ‘the phrase manasi-karoti is used in manyforms to express attention’.57TheDhammapadapassage above also indicates anactive role for mano, giving it a sense of thinking, but also an ethical component.This leads us far away from it just being a naive notion of the brain as a sense-organ (although I am not convinced that it rules out this forming part of its broadand inclusive definition), and to concur with Johansson’s view of mano:Manois generally conceived as an active agency, not only as a sense,content with passively receiving impressions and passing them on.58If we look further, into Abhidhammaanalysis of this, we find lengthy if notalways that enlightening discussions in the Vibhakga. After a fairly predictableaccount of the bases, albeit very detailed, there is an account of the ‘elements’BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE155"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"(dhatu). These are given (Vibh.82) as ‘extension, cohesion, heat, motion, spaceand consciousness’.59This would seem of little relevance to the current discus-sion, but if we look beyond this to the more detailed sections, we find the moredetailed twelve-fold account, which contains the notion of the ‘mind-element’,themano-dhatu.60U. Titthila’s translation of this gives an interesting view ofmental activity in relation to the sense-experience (such as eye-consciousness)arising from the interaction of the sense bases and contact :Therein what is mind-element? Immediately after the cessation of theeye-consciousness-element that has arisen there arises consciousness,mind, ideation, heart, lucence, mind, mind base, controlling faculty ofmind, consciousness, the aggregate of consciousness; and, depending onthe aforesaid, mind element.61Interestingly, the same series occurs after the other sense-consciousness-elements(such as tongue-consciousness-element) – all lead to these various mental events –including the mind base. Here we see a more complex and mutually conditioningpicture than in the basic twelve-link formula. While there is not the space here tofollow this up in greater detail, it does seem that upon closer examination the fivephysical/conventional senses spark within us the setting in motion of mano– and itis through the mano-managed response to phassathat we come to consciousness ofan object of experience.62Vedanamakes sense in this context not as just a neutral collision of the worldand our sense-apparatus, but the feeling that vedana63refers to is the subjective(in the sense that it is mind-negotiated) manner in which we experience the world.It is thisworld that we tend to respond to with craving – not to the world-as-it-is-independent-of-us-perceiving-it. This now ties in much more clearly with the ideaof ignorance as a key factor.Craving then is not inherent within us in the sense of a fatal flaw, or someaspect of human nature (‘sentient-being nature’?), but can be much more clearlyunderstood as, in part, due to the way we view the world. This gives a pragmaticjustification to Pali Buddhism’s seeming pre-occupation (at least in Abhidhammatexts) with the process of perception. Greed and craving, the villains of the desirepantheon, do not arise spontaneously, but are – to a large extent – the result of aprocess where our perception of ‘reality’ is skewed and distorted by an ignoranceof the nature of the world.64At a most fundamental level this ignorance is surelyof the three marks –anicca, dukkhaandanatta. It is these conditions – of incom-ing sensory experience processed in a manner conditioned by our deep ignoranceof the true nature of things – that lead to craving.If we consider tajhaas based on feeling, does not desire – at least in this form –seem to be primarily reactive? Such a view is not as helpful as it might seem. Ifwe see it as reactive because it is dependent on conditions, because it is a responseto feeling, then everything has to be also seen as reactive – for everything in thisworld, nibbanaexcepted, is conditioned. Therefore we need not see the necessityBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE156"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"of conditions for the bringing about of desire as indicating that desire is somehowpassive.Having seen how tajha-desire fits into the twelve-fold paticca-samuppadaformula, we still need to see how else we can see it playing a role in the processesof conditioning. Following tajhain the twelve-fold approach is upadana.Thisterm has been discussed in Chapter 3, but it is via it that we reach the final triadof the twelve-fold formula. I group the last three together as they collectivelydemonstrate one sense of the power of desire.The power of desire was a central theme in Chapter 2, and may seem to havetaken something of a back seat in the Buddhist analysis thus far, but it is throughthe conditions of tajhaandupadanathat we are led to coming into being andbeing born, and therefore continue to be subject to ageing, death and otherassorted unpleasantnesses.In the context of rebirth, we can see the power of desire fully uncloaked. Whatthis brief analysis of Conditioned Arising has done is to let us see beyond the natureof desire, as discussed in Chapter 3, on to the consequences of desire and its roots.We can now see the full sense of what is indicated by the second Noble Truth; howdesire as craving and attachment leads to dukkhain the broadest sense by deliver-ing us repeatedly into this world. Matthews has recognised this vital aspect of theoperation of craving:Perhaps the most striking feature of the rebirth process is the central rolecraving has in necessitating or provoking it, as well as transmitting theenergy that characterises rebirth. In this way craving takes on an impor-tance not just in the present life but in the whole structure of saÅsara.We can say with confidence that, more than any other factor, craving‘turns the wheel’.65He seems clearly right in his first comment here, but is craving as pre-eminent ashe suggests by the phrase ‘more than any other factor’? It is certainly one of themost critical, and as I have suggested here one where we have – along with avijja–a significant opportunity to effect an intervention. Nonetheless, we must be waryof raising tajhato too high a status, lest we begin to mistake it for a notion of‘human nature’. Craving does indeed ‘turn the wheel’, or act as ‘fuel for thefire’,66but it can act as such only in the context of spiritual ignorance –avijja.67An illustration of the power of tajhawhich has much populist application inthe Buddhist world, but which for me seems charged with poignancy, is related toa specific type of rebirth born of craving, greed and attachment. That is, the fateofpetas – ‘the departed’. We can view this unfortunate post-death fate as anembodiment of the consequences of desire.Often described as ‘hungry ghosts’,68petas (Sanskrit: preta) are those whoseattachments to this world are so strong that at death they do not attain a ‘fresh’rebirth, but remain close to their previous lives as tortured spirits. The term islinked to that used in the Vedas to refer to ‘spirits’69– especially in the sense ofBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE157"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"those who attain the realms of the fathers, but also as what we might commonlyrefer to as ghosts.70Popular belief represents some forms of these beings as having huge bellies buttiny mouths – a true embodied form of the nature of craving. The seventy-fourthdilemma71of the Milindapañha, concerns offerings to the dead, and gives an insightinto the types of petas. Rhys Davids’ note, in his translation, also helps us see petaswithout making the error of attributing to them a ‘soul of the departed’-type status.He writes of petas that they:are not ghosts, disembodied ‘souls’, but new beings whose link ofconnection with the departed is ‘not soul’, but Karma.72While we may feel him a little over-pedantic regarding the term ‘ghosts’, it isinteresting to see them as ‘new beings’ – for they are often seen as closely con-nected with the ‘old being’ – but then, new born children may be seen to exhibitingrained personality traits from their preceding existence. As so often in a cer-tain style of post-Canonical text, Milinda’s questions seem to revel in foul details,talking of the petas who live on vomit and the like, but two of the categories ofpetaare dominated by hunger and thirst, or just thirst. The state of petas is oftenseen as deeply miserable (see M.I.76), but is still seen as preferable at times (suchas at M.II.193) to the animal realm. I have only been able here to touch on thestate of petas, but it is worth noting that this sub-human birth is seen as particu-larly characterised by the thirsting and craving that we will need to eliminate togo beyond, or maybe above, human birth.We have, then, seen here how desire can be understood in the context ofConditioned Arising. But to see desire more fully we need to not only see whatitis, as discussed in Chapter 3, and howit is a cause and an effect, as above, butalso examine ‘where’ it is. Where is it that this thing ‘desire’ occurs? This leadsus to consider the site of its arising – the nama-rupacomplex.The mind–body relationshipThe analysis offered so far in this chapter has seen how forms of desire relate topaticca-samuppada. In the twelve-link nidanaprocess, we saw tajhaas the resultof various conditions being fulfilled. One of these, and surely one of the mostinteresting, is nama-rupa. This term is sometimes translated as ‘name-and-form’ –the literal translation, but may also be, and often is, rendered as ‘mind-and-body’.We can perhaps see it as an overall term for referring to the five khandhas, as thecombined elements that go to make up a person.73It is within this nama-rupacomplex that desire arises, and in order to gain an overall picture of desire, weneed to examine this site of its arising.The relationship between mind and body is an important topic in Westernphilosophical thought, and Indian philosophy has also wrestled with the complexquestions regarding the way mind and matter, the mental and the physical, relateBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE158"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"to each other and interact. To draw together the threads of our view of desire here,it is therefore necessary to gain an understanding of the Buddhist view of thisrelationship.Clearly this issue has relevance for more than desire. The relationship betweenmind and body will indicate to us whether or not, for example, it makes sense tothink of mind as existing without body,74or whether the distinction between anunenlightened and an enlightened being can be understood in terms of the typesofdukkhathey can be subject to (the enlightened normally being considered ascapable of suffering only physical dukkha).Some older Western stereotypes of Buddhism saw it as a religion of harshasceticism. However, there is a clear rejection of extreme forms of spiritual prac-tice. In accounts of the Buddha’s life, we see him try such methods and find themineffective as a means to spiritual satisfaction or liberation. In the Mahasaccakasutta, prior to taking up the path that finally leads to nibbana, the Buddha rejectsthe extreme methods he has been trying:Indeed, by these severe austerities I have not attained super human-states,75any discrimination in knowledge or insight fit for the noble. I wonder, couldthere be another path to awakening?76So, the body is not to be tormented or subject to extreme action such as starvation.In the same sutta, we find an excess of the pursuit of sense-pleasure likewiserejected,77and the distinctive middle-way outlined. As a result of this approachwe can presume an attitude to the body that refrains from seeing it as somethingto be defeated in this harsh manner.78However, this view of the body is not to be taken, as a result of this, as whollypositive. Indeed, we often find it described in considerably less than glowing terms.Reflection on the foulness of the body is a common strategy for trying to free us fromattachment to the body. This is often in conjunction with deeply graphic descriptionsof the body after death, such as in the Satipatthana sutta, where the dead body, eatenby worms, jackals and the like is compared to the body of the living:This body, indeed, is of the same nature, it will be thus, it is not exempt.79This rams home the message of the transience and fragility of our embodiedexistence. Buddhaghosa seems almost a little too keen to reinforce this in theVisuddhimagga.80We might view the rejection of extreme asceticism and thisviewing of the body as something gross and unpleasant as being in tension.Overall though, we can see the two as compatible. The former is the judgment thatthese practices cause unnecessary dukkha, the very thing that Buddhism seeks toavoid, and as an ineffectual means to spiritual progress there can be no justificationfor recommending or indulging in such practices.The latter is, one presumes, an approach to the body which seeks to undermineour deeply seated attachment to both the body and the pleasures which areBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE159"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"channelled to our consciousness via the sense-doors of the body. Theseattachments are problematic due to the fleeting nature of the body and its health,and likely to lead us to further dukkha.Before I continue though, it is incumbent upon me to take a look at this nama-rupaentity, this temporary collection of conditioned phenomena that iswhat ‘we’ are. To do so I will begin by looking at namaandrupaindividuallybefore trying to see how they operate together.Following from the discussion above, I begin with rupa.Rupais most essentiallya term for ‘physical form’.81The PED gives it as ‘form, figure, appearance, princi-ple of form, etc’.82While its usual application is to the physical form of persons, itis also used to refer to materiality in general. This materiality is seen as made of thefour great elements of matter:83the earth element, the water element, the fireelement, and the air element. As we might expect, commentarial and Abhidhammaliterature is happy to expand these categories in some detail,84where a distinctionis made between these primary elements and ‘derived’ forms of materiality.85Mindfulness of the body is a vital component of Buddhist meditation practice,often initially based on observation of the breath. However, beyond the breath, aware-ness and paying attention to the body and its functioning can have great spiritualvalue. Citing S.V.158 and S.V.182, and referring to M.III.99, Gethin comments that:In a rather similar way, for the bhikkhuwho develops mindfulnessconcerning the body ten benefits (anisaÅsa) are to be expected; the lastof these is the destruction of the asavas.86Clearly the body, if not a wholly positive entity, has some role to play in thespiritual life then, if its contemplation can be instrumental in this manner.Namais literally ‘name’, and is used throughout the Canon to refer to people’snames. However it is also widely used to refer to the non-material aspects of aperson. Of the five khandhas, four of them are covered by nama:vedana,sañña,sakkharaandviññaja.87It is when these are combined with rupathat we are ableto coherently talk of a ‘person’ being present. The PED states this, but adds anintriguing gloss:These88as the noëtic principle combined with the material principlemake up the individual as it is distinguished by ‘name & body’ fromother individuals. Thus namarupa\u0001individuality, individual being.These two are inseparable.89While the bulk of this comment seems wholly in keeping with the usage of namaandrupain the Canon, the last sentence is surely more controversial. It may seema perfectly sensible claim, as one would expect that, in our current scientific viewof persons, namais conditionally contingent on the presence of rupa. Certainly anumber of scholars take this view, Kalupahana feeling it to be a relatively settledmatter. Discussing the process of rebirth and the manner in which consciousnessBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE160"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"may act as the link between lives, he writes:It is important to note that in the early texts90there is no mention of thisconsciousness surviving even for a moment without the support of apsychophysical personality. In other words, early Buddhism does notcontribute to a theory of disembodied existence.91This is in keeping with a general Buddhist theory of mind and matter as deeplyentangled and intertwined within the entity of a person.92We do find much to sup-port this view in the Pali Canon, but perhaps the clearest summary of this is to befound in the Milindapañha,93in a dilemma posed by the King entitled the Nama-rupa-patisandahana-pañho– ‘the question of the rebirth as name-and-form’:The King said ‘Honourable Nagasena, you were talking of name-and-formjust now, but what is “name”, what is “form” ?’‘It is this way O King; what is gross,94this is form. What is subtle,mental,95this is name.’‘Honourable Nagasena, why is it that name is not reborn alone, or formalone?’‘O king, these are closely connected to one another, they are of a natureto arise together.’‘Provide me a simile.’‘It is as with a hen, O King, an embryo96would not come to beseparately, an egg97would not come to be separately. Both are closelyconnected to one another, arising into being together. In this very way, OKing, if there were no name, there would be no form; Name and formare both closely connected with one another, arising into being together.They are as this as they run through all time.’‘You are ready, Nagasena.’98Here, in Nagasena’s usual manner, we find a clear statement of the mutualreliance of namaandrupa. There does seem to be a problem though. Nagasenaseems to be either unaware of (which seems unlikely), or forgetful of, the formlessrealm (a rebirth destination where we have no rupa), as well as – inversely – thestate of cessation where mind stops. If we take the above view of the nama–ruparelationship to refer to just kama-lokarebirths, the argument may be seen to losemuch of its force. I shall return to this issue shortly.Summarising the view given in the Pali texts, Peter Harvey claims that thisdeep inter-connectedness of namaandrupaprevents Buddhism from becominga form of mind–body dualism:Whilenamais centred on cittaandrupais centred on the ‘four greatelements’, there is no dualism of a mental ‘substance’ versus a physical‘substance’: both namaandrupaeach refer to clusters of changing,interacting processes.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE161"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The processes of namaandrupaalso interact with each other, fromthe moment of conception, mutually supporting each other.99While this seems in line with the view outlined throughout this section, Harveymakes a more intriguing claim:The Palisuttas(though not later Pali material) includes indications thatthe early Buddhists regarded consciousness (viññaja) as able to ‘breakfree’ of the network of interactions.100This can be seen to have other implications (such as for the nature of nibbana),but also is interesting with regard to the ‘formless realms’ – where viññajaisseparate from both rupa(which is not present) and nama, but is still conditionedby mental factors which are part of nama.While Harvey uses this notion, in avariety of pieces, as the basis of his approach to nibbana, the viability of nama,or at least elements of nama, existing independently of rupais challenging. Many,under the influence of reductive Western science, see ‘mind’ as somehow depend-ent on the physical brain; be this in terms of identity theory, or seeing mind assome kind of epiphenomenona of the brain.The idea of elements of our mental make up being able to exist independentlyof the physical is hard for us to grasp, but the suttas are suggestive of such a pos-sibility. Some of the powers of arahats such as mind-projection and mind-sharingseem to break aspects of namaaway from its rupaconditions.101We also need the notion of there being the possibility of namabreaking awayfromrupa, if the aforementioned notion of a ‘between-lives state’ is to beviable.102Clearly some take the view, as Kalupahana does above, that such a stateis incompatible with the stance of early Buddhism, and it is not accepted byTheravada orthodoxy. But if we were to accept the possibility of separation, sucha notion may be more coherent. Harvey clearly feels that such a breaking-awaycan be achieved,103and does so on the basis of his argument that:Early Buddhism accepted a kind of spirit-like life-principle whoseprimary process is discernment.104This life principle is not identical withthe mortal body, nor wholly different from it; though it is ‘supported’ byand ‘bound’ to. It leaves at death.105Such a principle is, by its very nature, surely an element of one’snamaexistence.How are we to understand such claims though, in the light of previous statements,such as that of Nagasena, that indicate the deeply intertwined nature ofnama–rupa? If we wish to maintain Harvey’s claim that Buddhism avoids thedualism he describes (which is rather Cartesian in nature), can we allow for thisrupa-lessnama?If we take a broad view of Buddhist thought, there may prove to be no reasonwhy we cannot accept such matter-independent mentality. Buddhism has a moreBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE162"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"consciousness-populated view of the cosmos than contemporary reductivescience. In a world-view containing ‘formless states’ as rebirth locations, a universeofdevas and petas, a consciousness freed or temporarily separated from materi-ality seems less peculiar a notion. For example, when the types of becoming –bhava– are enumerated in paticca-samuppadaanalysis, we find three types ofbecoming. Appropriately enough, we can see this in the Samma-ditthi Sutta:There are, Sir, three types of becoming: becoming in the world of sense-pleasures, becoming in the (realm of elemental) form,106becoming inthe (realm of) formlessness.107This clearly indicates non-rupaforms of bhava, and such an arupabhavaindicates that the relation of namaandrupathat we are experiencing in our currentlives is only conditional, and not necessary. This should not surprise us. Whilebothnamaandrupaare both temporary collocations, there is no reason to believethat this indicates both stop and end together. Furthermore, if we take rebirthseriously we must surely presume some elements of namato outlive the cessationof our rupastates which takes place at the death of the body.However, this does not necessarily indicate that nama, or elements of it, areable to be free of rupainthisworld.108In these other realms mentioned it seemswholly feasible, but there seems little to support such a notion as widespread inthe Pali Canon. Perhaps the most convincing evidence for one who would arguefor a this-world rupa-lessnamais the powers of arahats. However, an arahathas a radically altered form of nama, and one may presume that they also havea drastically modified form of nama–ruparelationship.109At this point I have begun to establish the Buddhist notion of the mind–bodyrelationship as representing a holistic concept of the ‘person’. A person is thenmade up of these mutually conditioning and deeply intertwined sets of processes.That said, how does such a view contribute to the current concern with desire?Desire is surely primarily a namaphenomenon. But, as we have seen, it is sooften a reaction to the rupa, to the world of matter, most directly to vedana. Wesaw previously that desire is a response to ‘feeling’, which itself derives from‘contact’, based on the ‘six sense-bases’. What is intriguing here is whether thisindicates that desire requires a rupabasis. Were the analysis of the twelve nidanasto see only the five-senses as conditions for tajha, then we could draw such aconclusion. However, Buddhism offers us six sense-bases. The non-physical oneof these is mano– mind. We have seen manoalready in this chapter, but I wishto return to it here to see how we can understand it in relation to the arising ofdesire-states.Mind as a ‘sense-door’ has an odd ring to western ears. We can easily see thebasis of sensory perception in the five senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing andtaste; but mind? If we see namaas non-physical, we might be tempted to thinkthat we can treat manoas equivalent to the brain as a form of perception, the phys-ical basis of mental states. This need not conflict with the view that certainBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE163"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"specific states of ‘mind’ can exist independently of manoas brain. Such stateswould not be able to have any of the ‘five-sense bases’ as conditions, but mayhave as conditions mental events. Of course some of these mental states which actas conditions for non-rupa-dependent mental states may themselves have an orig-ination in a nama–rupainteraction. But is this view of manocompatible with itsusage in the Pali Canon?Manomerits one of the longest entries in the PED, and from the primarydefinition of the term it is not clear that the aforementioned view of manoas thesense-response to the activity of the brain is going to be sustainable:Mano represents the intellectual functioning of consciousness, whileviññajarepresents the field of sense and sense-reaction (‘perception’),andcittathe subjective aspect of consciousness.110Clearly perceptive acts occur within a specific element of consciousness, andleaving cittato deal with the subjective component does leave room for the inter-pretation I have offered of mano, but is this enough? If we do wish to continueviewing manoas the sensing of the phenomena produced by brain, then the restof the PED view may be more supportive:The rendering with ‘mind’ covers most of the connotation; sometimesit may be translated ‘thought’. As ‘mind’ it embodies the rational facultyof man, which as the subjective side in our relation to the objectiveworld, may be regarded as a special sense, acting on the world, a senseadapted to the rationality (reasonableness, dhamma) of the phenomena,as our eye is adapted to the visibility of the latter. Thus it ranges as the 6thsense in the classification of the senses and their respectivespheres.111If we do take this view, then all tajhawould seem to derive from a rupabasis –ifmanohas a ruparather than namabasis.We do not need, however, to adopt this position. Mano, as previously noted inthis chapter, has a more complex role. If we see manoas, in part, the manager ofthe sensory process, we can avoid a simplistic view of it as ‘brain’ while retainingforsaññathe role of sensory perception itself.Another reason to reject the view of manoas ‘brain’ is that it is not seen as partofrupa, the physical body. As Peter Harvey states, drawing on the Patthana(1.5)and the Vibhakga(413) that:Not only the physical basis of mind, but the mind itself is present fromconception.112This seems to undermine the possibility that manois brain, as it would seem thatmanocan exist where there is, as yet, no brain.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE164"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Where then does this leave us with regard to the overall position of themind–body relationship, and the place of desire therein?Desire here seems to arise as a response to the sensory process. We have seenthis in relation to paticca-samuppada. What has been gained through an exami-nation of mind–body understandings is the way in which desire can be seen asmental in almost all aspects. Stimulation of desire may originate outside the per-son, but the desire itself arises as part of a set of mental causal processes. It seemsunlikely that the physical alone can be a source of the arising of desire; desireis a mental response, based on a combination of perception, choice and otherconditioning factors.113If we are to intervene in the processes of desire, it iswithin the mind that such interventions are to be undertaken. This may seem anobvious conclusion, but it represents an important first stage in coming to thecontrol and management of our desires.Furthermore, we have begun to see the role desire has in the framing of ourconsciousness. This is a two-way process; for as desire contributes significantlyto the way we view the world, our conscious (and sub-conscious) responses tosensory and mental events determine the nature and extent of any desire thatoccurs. We might, and this is partly why I now move on to look at the status of‘views’, argue that craving-desires and ignorance of the way things really are(tajhaandavijja) are mutually reinforcing mental factors.The status of views: a structural analogy?Buddhism presents an interesting position with regard to the way it conceives itsown teaching. One on hand, as we shall see, we are warned to be careful to avoidbecoming ‘attached’ to specific views or doctrinal positions. On the other hand, wesee Buddhism as a tradition deeply concerned with the clarification and articulationof its teachings. In D. J. Kalupahana’sBuddhist Philosophy: A Historical Analysishe writes of the concern with and keenness for the clarification of Dhammain earlyBuddhism.114He may well be correct in attributing the fierce energy which seemsto have been expended in scholastic activity and debate in early (and much later)Buddhism, to the Buddha’s injunction that after his parinibbanatheDhammaandtheVinayawere to be teachers of the Order.115What, however, is undeniably strik-ing is the Canonical concern with beliefs, often what we might term philosophicalbeliefs – both their nature and, significantly, their consequences.Furthermore, we also see explicitly an understanding of Buddhism’s owndoctrines that sees them as, ultimately, something that will be no longer neededafter enlightenment. We see this attitude most famously in the simile of the raft.We find this, besides cropping up elsewhere,116in the Alagaddupama Sutta.Herethe Buddha explains that, as with a raft, the Dhammais not to be held onto, orgrasped at, once its purpose has been achieved:In this way monks, I have shown you that the Dhammais like a raft, forthe purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.117BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE165"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"This is reinforced in the Mahatajhasankhaya Suttawhere correct, accurate andspiritually useful views are also seen as a potential object of grasping, againstwhich the Buddha warns:‘Monks, pure and cleansed as this view is, if you do not cling to it, havegreed for it, treasure it, be attached to it, then have you understood thattheDhammais like a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for thepurpose of grasping?’‘Yes, Sir.’118Bhikkhu Bodhi summarises the Buddha’s attitude to views when he writes:The Buddha regards the adherence to views as part and parcel of thephenomenon of suffering, and in many suttas he has shown the problemsto which such adherence can lead.119While I shall return shortly to the precise nature and status of views, this doesgive us a sense of the extent to which doctrines and teaching are seen as func-tional or instrumental in the Pali Canon.120Steven Collins applies this to bothspecific teachings and the overall way of life of a renunciant:It is not only the conceptual formulations of doctrine which are thought tobe potential objects of mistaken and harmful attachment. Both the generalattitude of renunciation necessary for a monk, and the states of mind pro-duced in him by the practice of Buddhist meditation, are only of value asinstruments, and must not themselves replace nibbanaas the final goal.121I will return to the specific issues shortly, but, you might ask, why, in a bookconcerning the status, nature and consequences of desire, am I addressing thesame aspects of ‘views’? There are, as hinted at in the introduction to this chap-ter, a number of striking analogies between the treatment of desire and of views.Both are mental states with – at least most of the time – objects other thanthemselves.Views, especially as referred to by the term ditthi, are potentially problematicand a spiritual hindrance in a manner strikingly close to that of desire. It is notjust that incorrect or inaccurate views are likely to lead us into dukkha(whichthey clearly are, especially considering avijjaas the root nidanain the formulaeofpaticca-samuppada), but that there may be something problematic in-itselfabout the wayin which we hold them. Attachment to views,122even if they arepotentially accurate ones, can be harmful and therefore considered as akusala–in the same way that a grasping, tajha-desire for a good or appropriate object ofdesire can also be potentially akusala.To demonstrate this we can return to the twelve-fold paticca-samuppadaformula discussed previously. We saw that tajhawas the condition123forBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE166"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"upadana– which I translated there as ‘attachment’, but which might haveequally well been rendered as ‘grasping’.124The texts indicate four classes ofsuch grasping. These crop up at numerous points, such as in the Sakgiti sutta,during the great list of the fours:Four Graspings: at sense-pleasures, at views, at precepts and vows, at aSelf-doctrine.125He we see ditthias an object of grasping, of attachment, and it is not in the bestof company here. For example, attavadais not a belief that is kusala-variable,but a harmful akusalamental state to possess. We can perhaps see this structuralconnection with desire here, as at times there are distinctions made betweenkusalaandakusalaviews, and at other times views seem universally akusala. Ina passage just preceding the one above from the Sakgiti suttawe see viewscondemned again:Four floods:126of sense-pleasures, becoming, views, ignorance.127Notably, Walshe renders ditthogoas ‘[wrong] views’,128making a presumptionthat it is only inaccurate views that constitute an obstacle on the spiritual path.The four oghas here are identical with the four asavas – cankers, or ‘stains’.129And at D.III.230 the four floods are also identical with the four ‘attachments’ –upadanani.To continue this mirroring of desire, we also find the removal of views fromour mental profiles as leading to nibbana. At the end of the Cu¬asihanada sutta,the ending of the four upadanas is examined, and the Buddha tells the monks:Monks, when ignorance is abandoned, and knowledge130arises in themonk, with the ending of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he clingsneither to sense-pleasures, nor does he cling to views, nor to precepts andvows, nor to a Self-doctrine. Not clinging, he is not disturbed;131not dis-turbed, he attains individually nibbana.132He understands ‘birth is ended,the Holy life has been lived, that to be done has been done, there is nofurther coming to this world’.133There is a contrast here between salvific knowledge and ditthi. This could beread as an injunction to abandon views generally, but also might be seen asreferring only to ‘wrong-view’. Of course, there is also the notion of Samma-ditthi– right-view – but we will come to this later in this chapter.Ditthiis often viewed as being, on its own, ‘wrong-view’. We find ‘view’, forexample, condemned in the Abhidhammaliterature. In the AbhidhammatthaSakgaha,ditthiis listed as one of the fourteen akusala-cetasikas, or unskilfulmental factors.134Rewata Dhamma and Bhikkhu Bodhi translate ditthihere as‘wrong-view’, and in their guide to the Abhidhammattha Sakgahathey offer theBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE167"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"following analysis of ditthias an akusala-cetasika:Ditthihere means seeing wrongly. Its characteristic is unwise (unjustified)interpretation of things. Its function is to preassume. It is manifested as awrong interpretation or belief. Its proximate cause is unwillingness to seethe noble ones (ariya), and so on.135With regard to the use of ditthi, Carol Anderson claims that it is rarely used ina neutral sense:Even when ditthiis used without the adjective ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, viewconnotes either right or wrong-views; very few passages offer a neutralinterpretation of view.136As we have seen, when ditthialone is used it is commonly seen as ‘wrong’ view.The problem with viewsViews are not faring very well then, but why? What is so wrong with the holding ofopinions? It may well relate to the consequences of their possession, in the contextof the manner in which they are held. To make a judgment on this we shall have tosee if there are views which are not akusala, and what prevents them from being so.Indeed, we can quickly see that not all specific views are akusala. For example,in the Mahaparinibbana sutta, the Buddha tells the monks of views leading towardsnibbana, that they should be: yayaÅditthi ariyaniyyanika137– ‘continuing in thenoble view that leads to liberation’.This is not an isolated case. Indeed the Noble Eightfold Path contains Samma-ditthi, (‘right-view’). This is encountered throughout the Canonical texts (e.g. atM.III.73). This is where we can begin to see why I have felt it necessary to exam-ine the status of views. At times they do seem condemned outright, while elsewherea distinction is made between right and wrong-views. This split between a totalrejection and a kusala/akusalatypology of views seems to mirror that done withregard to desire. Is a resolution of this tension possible? In order to answer this Ineed to further examine the nature of views and the reasons for attributing to themthis important, if ambiguous, status.Oftenditthiseems to be assumed to refer to wrong-view – to miccha-ditthi– whenonly ditthiitself is mentioned, as we saw above. Often it is left to the reader to deter-mine from the context whether it is views in general or just wrong-views that arebeing condemned. In the analysis in the Canon of grasping, of upadana, it is – as wemight expect – broken down into various categories of grasping or attachment. In theSamma-ditthi Sutta(M.I.51) we find these enumerated again:These are the four kinds of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clingingto views, clinging to vows and precepts, and clinging to a doctrine of self.138BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE168"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Here we see ditthias an object of attachment that ought to be abandoned, and itis views in general which seem to be problematic. One might, however, see theuse of ditthihere as shorthand for miccha-ditthi, for wrong-view. This does seemto be the approach taken, and indeed ditthiis referred to as ‘esp. false theory’ inthe PED’s definition of the term alone.139The CSCD’s PED (which is somewhatbrief, but which also tends to represent common Canonical usage) gives ditthias‘Sight, view, the eye; religious belief, doctrine; false doctrine, heresy’.140We h av ethe same problem elsewhere, such as when ditthiis considered as a ‘canker’.In Chapter 3, I mentioned the three ‘cankers’ (or as Walshe calls them ‘thecorruptions’) – the asavas However, at times a fourth asavais mentioned, that ofditthi. We can see this in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta(D.II.81). Walshe offers thefollowing translation:The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from thecorruptions, that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, offalse views and of ignorance.141What is notable is that Walshe gives us ‘false views’, but the Pali reads only ditthasava.142We can also see the asavaof views in the Petakopadesa, where wefind the common lists of wrong-view concerning the Self, culminating in thefollowing phrase:He who does not see ‘I am this’, his canker of views has come to beabandoned.143We see here again the placing of views as negative – to be, like desire is so oftencast, something to be overcome or abandoned. Overall there do, then, seem to bevariations in the way views are handled in the Pali Canon. In some places there doesseem to be this outright injunction to be free of them altogether. The sense of dis-comfort that one gets from the way views are discussed in the Canon, and the notionthat we might be better off without them, derives from a concern of becomingattached to them. Rupert Gethin recognises this strand of thought in the texts:in certain contexts what seems to be significant about ditthiis not somuch the cognitive content of a view, but the fact that we cling to it asdogma, the fact that it becomes a fixed view: this alone is true, all elseis foolishness. Thus even so-called ‘right views’ can be ‘views’ (ditthi)in so far as they can become fixed and the objects of attachment.144Grace Burford recognises this concern with attachment to views, and identifieswith a particular set of Canonical passages:The specific condemnation of attachment to ditthis follows logically fromthe general condemnation of desire. The Atthakavaggaargument againstditthis focuses on this type of attachment as particularly pervasive andBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE169"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"dangerous. The issue is not whether one’s particular view is true or false,but whether one is attached to any particular view. Presumably even ifone were to discover a true ditthi(and this possibility is never explicitlyruled out in this text) aligning oneself with it, to the exclusion ofconflicting views, would prevent one from attaining the ideal.145TheAtthakavaggais part of the Sutta-Nipata, and is one of the most interestingsections of the Pali Canon with regard to views. This is most notable in the Sutta-Nipata786–7, where we find the following verses:For the person with spiritual excellence, nowhere in the world does hehave any mentally-constructed view about the various spheres of becom-ing. As he has eradicated delusion and deceit, in what manner can he bereckoned? He cannot be reckoned in any manner whatsoever.He who is attached enters into debates about doctrines. By what andhow can an unattached person be characterized? He has nothing to graspor reject; he has purified all views here itself.146Not long later in the Sutta-Nipatawe find a similar position, at verse 801:For him [the Sage] there is no desire to strive for this or that, in thisworld or the next. He has ceased to associate with dogmas for he nolonger requires the solace that dogmas offer.147The problem in this second verse is not with ditthibut with ‘dogma’. The Pali atthe end of this verse –dhammesu niccheyya samuggahataÅ– seems to be alongthe lines of being free from the commonly understood/widely accepted teach-ing/view. It is this which H. Saddhatissa renders above as ‘dogma’. Whiledhammais the idea of a doctrine148that one might be attached to, it is ditthiaboutdhamma(in the sense of ‘doctrine’) that is seen as something to be overcome.Clearly the most intriguing line among those above refers to the notion of theone who has ‘purified all views’. What can this mean? Is it akin to notions of thepurification or transformation of desire? Is it a radically altered way of holdingopinions that avoids the dangers of holding views in a dogmatic manner? I willreturn at a later stage to this notion of the ‘purification’ ofditthi.For a summary of the problems with ‘views’, we can turn to ThanissaroBhikkhu:First the content of the view itself may not be conducive to the arising ofdiscernment, and it may even have a pernicious moral effect on one’sactions, leading to an unfavourable rebirth.149This clearly applies to content-based problems with view – what are clearly‘wrong views’. Furthermore, my views and your views, like my desires and yourBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE170"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"desires, may be a source of conflict between us:Secondly, apart from the actual content of the views, a person attachedto views is bound to get into disputes with those who hold opposingviews, resulting in unwholesome mental states for the winners as well asthe losers.150This makes sense, but the next problem that Thanissaro Bhikkhu gives us offersa slightly nuanced position:Thirdly, and more profoundly, attachment to views implicitly involvesattachment to a sense of ‘superior’ & ‘inferior’, and to the criteria usedin measuring and making such evaluations.151Thanissaro Bhikkhu sees this as an important notion, and while not reallymentioning the fuller problems of our ‘attachment to views’, this is a worthwhilepoint. He sees the holding of views as associated with a certain negative way ofthinking – of placing categories on the world of experience. Clearly this derivesfromavijja, our ignorance of how things really are. He reinforces this whendiscussing the Aggivacchagotta Suttaand the Buddha’s lack of views:The construings the Buddha relinquished include views not only in theirfull-blown form as specific positions, but also in their rudimentary formas the categories & relationships that the mind reads into experience.152The holding of views can be seen as the production of mental constructs, basedon a specific avijja-conditioned way of engaging with the world and the resultsof the perceptual process.No-view or right-view?While the Canon is replete with passages warning us of the dangers of gettingdrawn into distracting and misleading metaphysical disputation, the passagesrecommending the eradication of views are relatively rare:he [the Buddha] says that he does not dispute with the world; it is theworld that disputes with him (Sn.III.138). It seems but a short step fromhere to the statement that he has no viewpoint (ditthi) at all; but thisextreme position is found only, I believe, in one group of poems.153Gombrich feels that a religion, especially one that wishes to proselytise, cannotdo without debate. But is this the view of these poems? And even if it is, is thisan abandonment of the possession of beliefs? Here we may have a twofold BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE171"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"understanding. It is not just the content of views that matters – whether they areright or wrong-views – but the wayin which they are held.Gethin seems more assertive than Gombrich in claiming views to be somethingto be overcome or abandoned, albeit partly on the basis of the same Sutta-nipatapassages:right view should not be understood as a view in itself, but as freedomfrom all views. This way of thinking is perhaps most clearly expressed ina series of poems found in the atthaka-vaggaof the Suttanipata, but isalso implicit in the treatment of ‘views’ more generally in the Nikayas.154Steven Collins has no hesitancy in seeing that, in the end, views are to be leftbehind. While discussing views of the Self, he sees attachment to views as relatedclosely to desire:Views of self, then, are not merely castigated because they rest on sup-posedly untenable intellectual foundations; rather they are conceptualmanifestations of desire and attachment, and as such need not so muchphilosophical refutation as a change of character in those who holdthem. This change of character will issue ultimately in the attainment ofenlightened status; the enlightened sage holds no views of self, as weshall see, because he is beyond conditioning.155But how are we to respond – how do we abandon our attachment to views?Thanissaro Bhikkhu offers an insight into how this is to be achieved, how viewsare to be abandoned:An important point to notice is that attachment to views must be abandonedthrough knowledge, and not through skepticism, agnosticism, ignorance, ora mindless openness to all views.156The alternative to the possession of views in this negative manner is discussedshortly, but here we can see how not to abandon views. Just as tajhais to be endedby understanding how it arises (and what it leads to), so with views our responseshould not be one of the unthinking reactions that Thanissaro Bhikkhu lists above,but rather one that seeks to see ditthiin the context of paticca-samuppada.This approach, of suggesting that we should not have views, has occasionallymanaged to exert a little influence beyond the borders of Buddhist thought.Indeed, the Theosophist writer Bas Rijken van Olst finds great inspiration in theaforementionedSutta-nipataverses, saying of them:In this context, having no views is considered wise, for the sage that hasreached a level of understanding where he knows that strife and disputeend once you stop being attached to this or that theory. These fragmentsBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE172"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"from the Sutta-Nipatabreathe an atmosphere of tolerance and freedomfrom all doctrinal limitations.157Inspirational as these verses may be, are we to take the view that van Olst developsin his article which seems to contrast intellectually held beliefs with the inexpress-ible knowledge of the mystic? While there may be a certain mileage to such anapproach, even Samma-ditthiseems to have a certain rational content – but it doesraise an important issue. That is, is the difference between ditthiandSamma-ditthian epistemological one – are they different ‘ways of knowing’ – or perhaps – ‘waysof seeking to know’?One might suggest that the tendency to become attached to views is a form ofSelf-assertion, that it is a form of the atta-belief, for it can be seen as the ‘I amright’ or ‘I know the truth, you don’t’ kind of attitude. This may pose a particulardanger for the renunciant, who has committed his or her time to discovering ‘theanswers’. While the primary danger for the laity may be that of attachment tokama, for the renunciant, ditthimay play a similar role, thereby reinforcing thelink between views and desire.Concern over the way of viewing – as much as the content of the view – makessense in the context of what we can see as the overall approach to philosophicalissues taken by the Buddha. Much of early Buddhist thought can be seen as areaction to, and rejection of, the essentialist tendencies in Hinduism. As Gombrichclaims, of the Buddha:he was not an essentialist, and in contrast to the brahmins was interestedin how things worked rather than in what they were.158This approach is clear in the Canon – where the attention is repeatedly focusedupon issues of process. In relation to desire then, no wonder it became – inChapter 3 – such an entangled matter to define desire, for the concern in the textsis not so much on what desire is, but rather on the role desire plays in theprocesses by which we come to suffer. Likewise with views, it may prove to bethe case that it is, along with the correctness of a view, the manner of its posses-sion that is vital to its kusalastatus.159Indeed, were we here to return to thedebates in the introduction, regarding the nature of the kusala/akusalajudgementitself, we could argue that it is on the basis of the roles things play in the variousprocesses leading to either dukkhaor liberation that they are to be ‘ethically’assessed. This surely supports the notion of kusalaas skill – or skilful insight intothe operation of reality.Samma-ditthi– the nature of ‘Right-View’Before moving on though, I wish to return to the notion of right and wrong-view.I do so with particular reference to Samma-ditthi, because we can see in thetexts a common strategy applied to this notion. This strategy is the way that theBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE173"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"ethico-religious prescriptions of Buddhism are often to be understood in twoways – in a lower and higher way.160This applies to Samma-ditthi. We find thisexpressed in the Mahacattariska Sutta(M.III.72), where all the Eightfold Pathfactors are given this bivalent treatment:Right view, I say, is twofold: there is right view that is affected by taints,partaking of merit, ripening on the side of attachment; and there is rightview that is noble, supramundane, a factor of the path.161This is, as I say, a common strategy – to offer a mundane and supramundaneversion of kusalafactors. The mundane tends to better rebirths, while the supra-mundane tends to liberation. The text offers further elaboration at this point,which primarily concerns the content of ordinary Samma-ditthi, and is a littlevague on the content of noble Samma-ditthi, concentrating instead on the wisdominvolved.162However, as Rupert Gethin notes with reference to theMahacattariska Sutta(M.III.72) passage cited above:The commentary explains that the former is concerned with ordinaryinsight (vipassana), while the latter is concerned with the right viewgained at the time of attaining the transcendent path.163While his primary interest here is the extent to which Samma-ditthiadmits ofdegree (of different levels), it is tempting to speculate that the higher form ofright-view may be likened to the transforming of the manner in which views areheld, while the lower concerns the content of views. This is not explicitly sup-ported, and therefore must stand only as tentative extrapolation. However, of theelements of the transcendent path, the attaining of the state of ‘stream-enterer’ isworth noting. The stream-enterer is not perfect, they are only part way (althoughquite a lot further than most of us, it has to be said) to liberation, but, as Gethinpoints out,164certain negative cittas have been left behind by this point in theirspiritual development, a number of them concerned with ditthi.165He goes on tomake a revealing comment that begins to make me feel less guilty regarding theunsupported speculation above:If we examine the Dhammasakganidescription of each of the four tran-scendent paths, we find that the path of stream-attainment is describedas ‘for the sake of abandoning views’ (ditthigatanaÅpahanaya).166The other transcendent paths (of the once-returner, non-returner and the Arahat)concern the abandoning of desire, aversion, avijjaand the like. This makes thenotion of the noble form of Samma-ditthias not just the correcting of the contentofditthibut the altering of the way we view altogether, much more sustainable.Returning to the previous notion of a ‘purification’ ofditthi, we do find anexplicit term for such a thing in the last chapter of the Abhidhammattha Sakgaha,BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE174"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"where it –ditthivisuddhi– is defined as follows:Purification of view is the discernment of mind and matter with respect totheir characteristics, functions, manifestations, and proximate causes.167However, this does not seem to contain any explicit notion of a specific reorien-tation of the manner of holding views, but rather seems to be another way ofdescribing the content of Samma-ditthi –through explaining that insight intopaticca-samuppada, primarily, is what constitutes a ‘purified’ view. Indeed, intheRathavinita Sutta, we are told that this ‘purification of view’ is not the pointof the spiritual quest (though of course it may prove a kusalaaspect of movingtowards this point):‘Now, friend, is it for the purification of view that one lives the holy lifeunder the Blessed one?’‘Indeed not, friend.’168TheSuttagoes on to state that the purpose of the holy life is the attainment of finalnibbana, while also – using the ‘relay of chariots’ simile – indicating that things suchas the purification of view are needed to reach this final goal. At times, though, wedo find purification of view associated with a kind of seeing that seems very far frommost understandings of ditthi– certainly from wrong-view and ordinary right-view,and maybe even the more noble form of right-view. We can see this in thePatisambhidamagga, in the phrase ‘dassanatthena ditthivisuddhi abhiññeyya’169–‘Through its meaning of seeing, purification of view is to be directly known.’170Thisis part of a long series of faculties and their meanings. Here it seems that the mean-ing of purification of view is to be known or understood through the idea of ‘seeing’.This fits with the idea, that I shall address shortly, of supramundane Samma-ditthiassome type of ‘direct seeing’, rather than the holding of an accurate opinion.There is also a discussion of purification of view in Buddhaghosa’s treatmentof the aggregates in the Vissuddhimagga.171The discussion here follows thecanonical linking of purification of view and purification of virtue (sila),172butexpands and separates the detail, so that purification of view fits into a series offive purifications173which form the ‘trunk’, following from two others:the [first] two purifications, namely, purification of virtue and purificationof consciousness, are its roots.174Here we see an image of one’s knowledge, for this is the context in this section oftheVissuddhimagga, as climbing up a tree – again a necessary step, but not oneto become stuck upon. Indeed, we can see Samma-ditthias something whichbelongs not with the goal, but with the Path, as Bhikkhu Ñajananda claims:Thus the truth value of Dhamma – of SammaDitthi– pertains to thepath, and it is essentially a viewof the Goal and not the Goal itself.175BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE175"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"We see views, again, here as functional, as part of a process – but not to be takenas the purpose of the process itself.Interestingly, Carol Anderson claims that there are three stages in the developmentof ‘right-view’, and it seems to be the first of these that is in addition to the twodiscussed above:The first stage of right view is a general sense of affirmation toward theteachings of the Buddha (a pro-attitude) and the second stage is a greaterfamiliarity with the tenets of Buddhist doctrine. At neither of thesestages, nor at the third stage of liberating insight, should views begrasped or held.176I have two points to make with regard to this. First, I am not sure that the generalpositive stance towards Buddhist teachings constitutes a ‘view’ in the sense thatditthiis used, other than maybe ‘the view that Buddhism is a good thing’. Second,while it has become clear that one should not grasp views, can one ‘have’ a viewwithout it being ‘held’? I may be being pedantic here, but with at least referenceto Anderson’s middle stage, or what we might see as mundane Samma-ditthi, itwould seem that one is a holder of a view – the right-view. It is only when weattain the insight represented by the higher form of Samma-ditthithat we cease tobe a holder in this way.Here we have seen the status of views, and there clearly seems to be somethinghigher than ditthi, or at least there is this sense of a higher form thereof, in terms ofunderstanding. This is some form of direct seeing, which does not rely upon the con-scious adoption of specific doctrinal positions.177One point where we do find anintriguing contrast between the direct seeing of the enlightened and the holding orpossession of views is in the Aggivacchagotta Sutta(M.I.486). The Buddha is herebeing asked about his views by Vacchagotta (although in dialogue the Buddha seemsto prefer the more familiar ‘Vaccha’), and rejects a whole cartload of viewpoints sug-gested by Vaccha, many of them relating to areas of metaphysical speculation. A, nodoubt rather frustrated, Vaccha finally asks the Buddha if he holds any view at all:Then does Master Gotama hold any speculative view at all?Vaccha, ‘speculative view’ is something that the Tathagata has put away.For the Tathagata, Vaccha, has seen this: ‘such is material form, such is itsorigin’.178Here, as Ña~amoli and Bodhi’s notes point out, there is a nice play on wordsbetween the idea of ‘views’ and that of ‘seeing’:In the Pali a word play is involved between ditthigata, ‘speculative view’,which the Tathagata has put away, and dittha, what has been ‘seen’ bythe Tathagata with direct vision, namely the rise and fall of the fiveaggregates.179BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE176"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"As the PED notes,180ditthais a term for that which is seen. This passageillustrates rather neatly the distinction I have been seeking to develop in this chap-ter. The dogmatic views that Vaccha offers are rejected not only on the basis oftheir inaccuracy, but also as they are of a class of citta, a kind of mental state, thatan enlightened being has transcended in favour of this direct seeing.181In order to extend this idea of the contrast between the possession of views anddirect seeing, we can see views as being a way of perceiving the world that ismentally constructed. To see ditthias mental constructs may seem an emptynotion, adding little to what is said above, but to do so indicates that views arevery different from the kind of direct seeing that the Buddha seems to prefer. Tohold a view is to do something in addition to observing. Among other things itmay be said to ‘freeze’ things – to have a view of something which is fixed, maybetake a snapshot of a moving image, and when we view the image, the thing itrefers to has gone; making the picture inaccurate as a representation of how thingsarenow. Given the dynamic nature of Buddhist thought with reference to paticca-samuppada, this is an important point. To have a view is, as David Kalupahanapoints out when discussing the Buddhist philosophy of history, to evaluate – tomake a specific judgement:‘Views’ (ditthi), according to the Buddha, are products of humandispositions (sakkhata) or of intentions (pakappita). Human dispositionsare, for the most part, determined by excessive attachment (raga) oraversion (dosa) or confusion (moha), while some are not so determined.Views, whether they be right (samma) or wrong (miccha), are thereforeevaluative in character.182Here we can see that views are ways of constructing a mental landscape. To do sois dangerous as such constructions tend to arise conditioned by – as pointed outabove specifically –raga, dosa, and moha, and more generally by avijja. Evenright-views can be seen as evaluative, that is they make judgements.183However,we should perhaps be wary of following this line too far. Buddhism doesmakejudgements, and openly. Distinctions between kusalaandakusalaacts are impor-tant, and I feel that the position of views is not so extreme as to prevent this.Another way to describe the concern with views is that many speculative viewsare, by their nature, partial. That is, by taking a certain stance, we close off otheraspects of reality. In this context, it is not all evaluations that must be abandoned,but a certain way of evaluating – we must avoid using our views to narrow ourperspective and close our minds to other possibilities.The deeper sense of right-view, then, might be best seen as distinct fromconventional right-view in its refusal to enter into such closure-seeking. Thissurely adds strength to the notion of right-view in its deeper sense as direct see-ing, as opposed to purely holding accurate rather than inaccurate opinions. Wemight associate noble right-view more with wisdom than the seeking of accurateknowledge, and this fits with many of the concerns over the ways views andBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE177"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"beliefs are treated. As Hoffman writes:Unlike knowledge, wisdom is thus necessarily spared the indignity ofbecoming a commodity.184While he is not talking explicitly of ditthihere, the point sticks. Ditthiare all tooeasily treated as a commodity. Noble right-view can be seen as more openand dynamic than the stasis-seeking closure of micha-ditthiand even lowerSamma-ditthi.We can find this further strengthened when we see another account of theBuddha’s discussion with Vacchagotta. In the VacchagottasaÅyutta185we finda topic similar to the account of the discussion with Vaccha above, but here thepossession of the speculative views the Buddha will have nothing to do with iscontrasted more widely. Here the contrast is with more than just ‘seeing’ thetruths of Buddhist teaching. It is here said that various failures of insight lead tothe situation whereby ‘those speculative views arise in the world’.186These viewsarise due to the factors listed here:Because of Not Knowing; Because of Not Seeing; Because of NotBreaking Through; Because of Not Comprehending; Because of NotPenetrating; Because of Not Discerning; Because of Not Discriminating;Because of Not Differentiating; Because of Not Examining; Because ofNot Closely Examining; Because of Not Directly Cognizing.187This is intriguing. The speculative views are based on a lack of certain competen-cies. Some fit well with the position I have been outlining here, such as ‘seeing’and ‘directly cognizing’, but others require some comment. In the view thatSamma-ditthi, in the more noble sense, is a direct seeing, what are we to make ofcomponents such as ‘discerning’, ‘discriminating’ and ‘differentiation’? Theseseem like just the kind of mental manipulations of experience that are so prob-lematic in the discussion of Kalupahana’s position above. One can only presumethatallperceiving of the world by an individual requires these elements of theperceptual process.While this is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of the process asseen in Abhidhammatexts, perhaps we can come to the view that all views –sammaormiccha– have to be initially based on what we can discover of theworld through the process of sensory perception.Perhaps we can come to the view that while we have to make distinctions, theSuttas are full of them. We should keep in mind not only the need to avoid beingattached to these distinctions, but also that those things which we separate bymaking distinctions are, at the same time, linked – through conditions, throughpaticca-samuppada. We need to be able to see differences and distinctions withinthe fluid, dynamic world, without freezing these evaluations into separatesubstances or isolated entities – it is into the latter trap that views so often fall.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE178"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"A paradox of views?Before moving on to look at the connection between desire and views in detail,I wish to examine a claim that we can see in the Buddhist treatment of views a‘paradox of ditthi’, equivalent to the paradox of desire discussed in the Introduction.This follows from my discussion above on whether no-view is equivalent toright-view, and is proposed by Grace Burford in her Desire, Death and Goodness.Burford identifies the Atthakavaggasection of the Sutta-Nipataas puttingforward the idea of ‘no-view’ as an ideal, but sees this as potentially problematic:The view of no-views is a teaching of non-duality. As such, it cannotexplicitly deny the validity of views that deny the validity of other views,without undermining its own authority.This paradox brings to mind another that is raised by the Buddhistteachings: The paradox of desire.188Here we see the crux of her concerns with this teaching of ‘no-views’. Burfordtakes on the connection with desire to claim that the discussions around viewsreflect a deeper problem with the understanding of desire:By extending the objects of desire to include views, the author(s) of thisteaching189eventually forces the issue of the paradox of desire. By shiftingthe focus away from desire for wealth and existence, toward attachment toviews, the author(s) brings out the less obvious (and there- fore eventuallyeven more troublesome190) inconsistency of the teaching that identifiesdesire as the problem and then fails to show how desire to end desire isdifferent from any other sort of desire. One cannot ignore the ease withwhich the anti-views argument is developed here: from that first premisethat desire is the root of all evil comes the argument that preference forany particular view, path, and even goal is counter-productive on thepath to the ideal.191A number of points here need engaging with. First, I feel I have begun to showthat Buddhism doesidentify what makes kusaladesire distinct from akusaladesire. As I have argued, this is not only through desire’s object (or Burford wouldbe wholly right here), but also through the nature of the desire – the manner ofwanting. Second, we can extend this to our understanding of views.The promotion of no-views as an ideal in the Atthakavaggamay initially seemat odds with the promotion of Samma-ditthielsewhere in the Canon, but this is,I think, a matter of two ways of describing the same thing. SupramundaneSamma-ditthican be seen as right in the sense of being the attitude to views thatone should take, but also as no-view as it is a radical reorientation in our mannerof viewing. We may still, once in possession of this higher right-view, be able toevaluate the varying qualities of content-based ditthis.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE179"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"To possess no-views is to be unattached to any views, to see and not grasp. Justas desirelessness does not prevent us from having a hierarchical kusala-basedassessment of desires, so having no-views does not prevent us seeing the relativemerits and dangers in specific ditthis held by others. This represents an importantway of overcoming these notions of paradox.Desire and views: craving and ignoranceHaving examined Burford’s claims regarding the connections between desire andviews, I now return fully to the issue of desire. In returning to desire, I wish todemonstrate how it connects to the notion of ditthi. To do this we can turn to thetwo most central doctrinal formulae of Pali Buddhist thought: the Four NobleTruths and the teaching of paticca-samuppada– Conditioned Arising. Both iden-tify what they see as the root or base cause of dukkha– of the unsatisfactorynature of the world, or more accurately our lived experience of the world. TheTruths implicate tajha, while we find that the twelve-fold formula of paticca-samuppadalays much of the blame at the door of avijja.Some might see a potential problem here – a tension based on a chicken-and-egg-like ‘which came first?’, ‘which is the worst/true cause of suffering?’ set ofquestions. Such questions not only presume the kind of linear cosmology that haslittle relevance here, but also presume the necessity of a cosmogony that willexplain them. We see the two, ignorance and craving, together at S.II.24:Bhikkhus, for the fool, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving,this body has thereby originated.192Which seems primary or foremost depends on how you look at the processesinvolved. The AvijjaSutta(A.V.113f ) seems to treat them as of equal value, andwhile both are seen here as being without a first instance, they are excluded fromacting as metaphysical principles by being seen as arising in specific instances,and having nutriments –aharas. For ignorance, we find, is nourished by the FiveHindrances,193while the next sutta, the TajhaSutta, identifies the nutriment ofbhava-tajhaasavijja.194This is interesting for two reasons. First, it seems that ignorance is being seenas more primary than tajha, but this is complicated by the presence of a form ofdesire as the first hindrance. Therefore we can see ignorance and desire, albeit invarious forms, as mutually conditioning. Second, here bhava-tajhais treated in away that is similar to the approach of Robert Morrison, seeming to see it as theprimary form of tajha. However, here tajhais being discussed in the context offirst causes,195of an original arising, so we should perhaps not be too surprisedto find bhava-tajhaas most central in this specific context.As a final point on tajhaandavijjaas the central problems in human life, andobstacles to spiritual progress, we find two passages in the Itivuttakawhichdemonstrate this clearly. Suttas 14 and 15 are named the AvijjanivarajasuttaÅBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE180"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"andTajhasaÅyojanasuttaÅrespectively. The former opens with the followingclaim about avijja:Bhikkhus, I do not perceive any single hindrance other than the hin-drance of ignorance by which humankind is so obstructed and for solong a time runs on and wanders in saÅsara.196The following Suttaopens with an almost identical claim about the nature andeffects of tajha:Bhikkhus, I do not perceive any single fetter other than the fetter ofcraving by which beings are so tied and for so long a time run on andwander in saÅsara.197This may seem contradictory, but in the context of what has been said above, andin the light of paticca-samuppada, these twin claims do make sense. In comingto this understanding of how the two are equally problematic, we need to see themas linked. The medium by which we can seem them as yoked together is ditthi.In seeking to understand the relations between avijjaandtajha, ditthiis avaluable, indeed vital, notion for it serves as a conceptual bridge between theseideas. Gethin also casts ditthiin much the same role:this is precisely where the notion of ditthicomes in, for it combines boththe root causes of suffering: ignorance and greed.198This is an important idea, and one that ties together much of what I have beendriving at in this chapter. Miccha-ditthiis a representation of both craving orgrasping andignorance at the same time. In both the senses of ditthihere – ofwrong content (ignorance) and the wrong means of believing (grasping/craving) –we see revealed the interconnectedness of these causes of dukkha. However, when‘viewing’ is done not in the sense of a form of upadana, but as noble Samma-ditthi, it ceases to be the holding of an opinion or belief. What is representedbySamma-ditthiis, particularly with reference to its more noble form, a directseeing – an, if you will permit, insight. As Gethin suggests:Rather than the occurrence of a mere belief or opinion in the flow ofmental states, samma-ditthiis presented in the Abhidhamma as in somemanner as always be [sic] a direct seeing of the four truths, and neversimply a ‘pro-attitude’ towards or belief in, say, the four truths.199Now, we might take these comments to indicate an epistemological distinction.The phrases ‘pro-attitude’ and ‘belief in’ seem all too ready to be contrasted witha notion of Samma-ditthias ‘knowledge’. We need not be so tentative though,despite the contemporary reticence often exhibited towards ‘knowledge-claims’.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE181"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"If we take seriously the words of the Buddha in the Kalama sutta, then directseeing via personal experience is the only means to knowledge – for the replac-ing of speculative assertion and dogmatic grasping with a seeing which almostfulfils the Western philosopher’s triple-criteria of ‘Justified True Belief ’. Only onthe last one might there be some niggling as to whether this direct awareness qual-ifies as belief, and given the consequences of such attainment – a movementtowards liberation from all suffering – getting drawn into such a debate begins tolook just like the kind of disputation we have here seen so many warnings against.Reason and desire revisitedIn the first chapter we saw an important opposition established between desireand reason. From the Greeks onward we saw the two as in tension – one followedthe heart (desire) or the head (reason); this is a common image in Westernthought, both in philosophy and common usage. Having seen how Buddhismviews desire, might we be tempted to suggest that it has a greater liking for anapproach dominated by rationality?While I do not wish, at this stage, to become embroiled in a debate on the natureand status of reason in Buddhist thought, this is an issue worth considering for tworeasons. First, as stated, there is this common opposing of desire with reason as itsother. Second, there is something in the Pali usage that has interesting similaritieswith the structure of representation already seen between desires and views.On one level we can see this heart/heard distinction found in Western thought asrepresented in Buddhist practice by the need to balance the faculties of faith and wis-dom. This may go some way to representing the Buddhist view, but given the analyt-ical nature of much Buddhist work, what of reason – is wisdom reliant on rationality?The key Pali term in this context is takka. This is a term that does not seem tobe regarded as the highest activity of the human – as Aristotle might be seen toview reason.200Indeed, the PED starts off its definitions of takkaon a fairly neg-ative note: ‘doubt; a doubtful view. . . hair-splitting, reasoning, sophistry’.201ThePED equates it with ditthi, and we can see the connection. In its usage it can oftenbe seen as a negative form of reasoning – an excessive tangling of thought. Wecan see this to an extent in the Kalama Suttaat A.I.189.202In this famous sutta, the Buddha tells the Kalamas, confused as they are by thepreponderance of teachers with their various competing theories and doctrines,about the way to judge between the teachings of those samaja brahmajakesamuttaÅagacchanti203–the renunciants and Brahmins who come toKesamutta. The Buddha lists various aspects of a teacher or teaching which arenot to be taken as a sign of its reliability, most importantly its efficacy.204In hisview, we are told that we should go:Not by reports, by lineage, (oral) tradition, collected scriptures, logicalreasoning, inferential reasoning, by the result of reflection, by the appear-ance of a view, by what seems possible, by the importance of a teacher.205BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE182"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"This passage is often used to claim that the Buddha wished his followers to testhis teachings themselves, and can be seen as the basis for the view that Buddhistphilosophy can be tested in some empiricist sense.206I, however, do not wish tobe drawn too far into these matters at this stage. Rather I wish to demonstrate thatwe might see ‘reason’ as something potentially negative in a Buddhist context. Atleast here it is seen as insufficient, it seems, to use reason alone to validate a spir-itual perspective – some form of empirical (or maybe supra-empirical) validationis also required/available. Kalupahana argues that there was, at the time of theBuddha, already some concern over the use of reason:Moreover, as is evident from texts like the Kalama-sutta, people hadalready begun to suspect the validity of reasoning (takka) and logic(naya) as means of arriving at a knowledge of truth and reality.207We can see takkaalso as something to be overcome, as in the Muni Sutta, wherethe one who has attained the goal is said to have ‘overcome sophistry [takka]’.208Saddhatissa’s translation here sees takkaas ‘sophistry’, marking a clear view ofthe nature of takkain this context.209But early Buddhism is clearly not intentionally irrationalist.210It is oftendeeply analytic,211so might we then think that it also has a more positive view ofrationality and reasoning? As yet, we have seen no general invective against reasonper se; rather it seems that the over-reliance on it, or the use of a certain type ofit, is where the problem lies.To consider ‘reason’ more fully, another term requires attention: vimaÅsa. ThePED gives a limited meaning, rendering it as ‘consideration, examination, test,investigation’.212While this is interesting – and vimaÅsais much more positive,being part of one of the four iddhipadas – it has moved us away from ‘reason’ inthe sense of logic, or as opposed to emotion. I include it though, with the inten-tion of indicating that Buddhism does favour thorough investigation and study ofphenomena.213To build up a full picture of the attitude to ‘reason’ in Buddhist thought,I would, at least, need to engage in a study rather like that of Chapter 3, but willlimit myself here to some key terms.214Many of the terms translated, in some sense, as ‘reason’, actually indicate‘reason’ in the sense of cause, or condition. For example, most uses of the termhetuare very close in meaning to paccaya.215We can also find sañcetana, whichis more along the lines of ‘thinking’. The PED gives it as ‘animate, conscious,rational’,216and it seems to just reflect the ability of a being to think or beconscious.217At this stage it is also worth mentioning dhamma-vicaya. This is listed as oneof the seven ‘Factors of Awakening’.218But what does ‘dhamma-vicaya’ mean?In his translation of the Sampasadaniya Sutta, at D.III.106, Walshe opts for‘investigation of states’.219This seems reasonable enough, but gives little senseof what it might involve. Is this meditational introspection, rational reflection, orBUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE183"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"something else? Rupert Gethin offers an etymological breakdown of the term,before coming to his conclusion:Sodhamma-vicayawould mean the ‘taking apart of dhamma’. In Buddhistthought to take dhammaapart is, I think, to be left with dhammas.Dhamma-vicayameans, then, either the ‘discrimination of dhammas’orthe ‘discernment of dhamma’; to discriminate dhammasis precisely todiscern dhamma.220This is interesting – for here, by coming to see the dhammas, we come to seeDhammain the broad sense. This process of discernment, and one involving dis-crimination of states, is useful. It demonstrates the central importance in comingto discern Dhamma, in coming to see the way things are, of discriminating. Herewe can see that rather than being abandoned as a spiritual hindrance, makingassessments and drawing distinctions is a vital component of the Path. It is themanner in which we do so, where we can take a kusalaorakusalaapproach – ofcourse – with regard to the actual discriminations we make. This should helpdeepen not only our sense of how reason operates, but also how views are to beseen in general.Overall, Buddhism seems a little suspicious of reason alone – reason as purelylogical investigation. What seems to be the case is that what Buddhism doesfavour sits somewhere between the two Western epistemological approaches ofempiricism and rationalism. Buddhism prescribes meditation; and this processrequires clear thought and investigation, but is not a process that can be purelydescribed as ‘reasoning’ – it is clearly more experiential, hence the nod towardssomething akin to empiricism. This topic is picked up again in the next, concludingchapter.ConclusionIt may seem as if this chapter has roamed somewhat, but what I have sought to dohere is to place the Buddhist notion of desire in context. By understanding whereandhowdesire occurs we have seen it as a process, and have been able to viewthat process in action.Furthermore, a key idea that has arisen in the course of this chapter has beenthe connections between desire and cognitive-states, particularly views andknowledge. This has been in a number of different ways. First, there is the notionthat both ditthiandtajhaare to be overcome, transcended and abandoned in orderto attain the final goal of nibbana.We have also seen, however, that knowledge – to be distinguished at times fromditthi221– is often seen as salvific. In the supra-mundane noble path, we can findtwo additional path-factors; samma-ñajay(right-knowledge) and samma-vimutti(right-liberation). As we find in the Janavasabha Sutta,222the former of the pairis seen as leading to the latter – knowledge leading to liberation.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE184"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"We also, in the Suttas, see the term ñaja-dassana. These two terms, individually,mean ‘knowledge’ and ‘seeing’ – but how to read their compound use? The PEDseems ( p. 287) to treat them as a dvandacompound,223as does the translation oftheMahasaropama Suttain MLD224where the term is rendered as ‘knowledgeand vision’. Interestingly though, the CSCD dictionary treats the compound as atappurisatype,225defining ñaja-dassanaas ‘insight given by knowledge’. Eitherway, and I am more persuaded by the first approach to the term here, we can seethat knowledge is a vital aspect of achieving the Buddhist goal.However, at times we might be tempted to suggest that it is the absence ofignorance (avijja, often given as equivalent with nibbana) rather than the pres-ence of knowledge, which is important. Why is so much of the suttas devoted toovercoming avijja? Why not just promote the development of knowledge? Onemight see this as an intentional and pragmatic form of rhetorical strategy. By con-centrating on the overcoming of avijja, Buddhism may be seen as seeking toavoid presenting knowledge in such a way as it becomes an object of desire andgrasping – of ditthi.226The second connection between desire and avijja227was that they can be jointlyseen as the primary, if not exclusive, roots of dukkha, and indeed of being. It isour misperception of the nature of reality that leads us to desire in unrealistic andharmful ways – we believe that we can find permanent objects of desire that willbring us permanent happiness. At the same time, our desires are such that theyblind us to the true nature of things, distracting us from taking the time to assessthe true nature of things as we rush heedlessly after fleeting objects.228Perhaps it is best to allow the last word on the topic of views to the Canon, wherewe find a kind of direct seeing extolled as the correct approach for the spiritualaspirant:Bhikkhus, held back by two kinds of views, some devas and humanbeings hold back and some overreach; and those with vision see.229So, how are we, overall, to view the arising of desire states? The only types of desirethat the paticca-samuppadaformula deals with explicitly are tajhaandupadana,but many of the others are likely to arise in similar ways. What is fairly clear fromwhat we have seen in this chapter is that desire consists of more than a straightfor-ward attraction–repulsion response to an object of perception. Desire does consistof a subject–object relationship – or at least is experienced in such a manner, par-ticularly by those in possession of atta-ditthi– but there is more to it than this. Aswe have seen, a significant number of conditioning factors come into play duringthe process. One’s level of ignorance is a factor, as is sañña, but a factor I have com-mented upon little, although implied by some of the others, is the level of calm ordisturbance within one’s consciousness. An agitated consciousness is more likely torespond in the attractor–repulsor manner mentioned above, while a calmed, stilledmind is more capable of reflection and consideration of sensory stimulation andfeeling, limiting the potential for non-mindful psychological responses.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE185"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"At the outset of this chapter, I suggested that desire was viewed in Buddhismas something in need of refining, and that this is the process that can lead to thetranscending of desire. Is this still tenable? It would seem to be a position that hassurvived what has been said here, concerning paticca-samuppada, relativelyunscathed. While the need to transcend desire has, if anything, been reinforced,the possibilities and process for refining desire have been clarified. An importantcorollary has been the notion that this is inextricably linked with the transcendingof views, and we have seen the explicit enumeration of a process that leads frommiccha-ditthito two qualitatively distinct forms of Samma-ditthi, to a final directseeing.Any understanding of the nature of desire in Buddhism has to be seen in thecontext of views, and the process of refining and transcending of desires andviews is something of a process that is more than parallel, but of necessity inter-twined and mutually supporting.It is worth, at this point also noting that the way desire is seen as something tobe gradually refined and overcome can also apply to views. We can see this in themove from wrong-views to ordinary right-view, to noble right-view. A stream-enterer has overcome sakkaya-ditthi,230but still may possess kama; a non-returnerhas no kama, but still has ragafor the rupaandarupalevels of existence, alongwith some aspect of avijja; and an Arahathas overcome all these and attainedthe goal.231A number of other issues have come up during this chapter, but as I wish torelate many of them to the conclusions from Chapter 3, I leave them for the next,concluding chapter.BUDDHISM AND DESIRE: DYNAMICS OF DESIRE186"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"That Bhikkhu who has crossed over the swamp,Crushed the thorn of sensual desire,Having arrived at the destruction of delusion,Is not disturbed by pleasures and pains.1As soon as you stop wanting something you get it.I’ve found that to be absolutely axiomatic.2IntroductionWe have seen desire from many sides now. But, do we understand desire at all?The experiential quality of desire is a yearning or hankering that, in spite of thepreceding chapters, seems to slip away from the net of language. Perhaps the bestwe can do is to gain an insight into how it arises, its consequences and use this asa means of intervening in these processes to better manage it.What I offer in this chapter is an attempt to harness the thought of Westernand Indian thinkers to try to give us a further insight into the Pali Buddhistunderstanding of desire. I do this in order to demonstrate the ways in which theBuddhist approach can be seen to contain shadows and echoes of these other tradi-tions. In doing so, I seek to demonstrate the extent to which the Buddhist view isan attempt to offer a comprehensive therapeutic response to our desiring.In order to achieve this, I begin by summarising the previous positions we haveseen, and follow this by examining a number of key themes which have emergedin these chapters. Finally I outline the way I see desire in Buddhism. In this view, I claim that Pali Buddhist thought on desire offers us a uniquely nuancedanalysis.Furthermore, I hope to establish that this view goes far beyond the merely ana-lytic or academic; indeed it may offer us a path of calm that leads away from thetumult of wanting towards a new kind of life. This flight from desire – the greatupsetter – is not a flight from life, or from choice or aspiration, but rather a flee-ing from the wanton wanting that threatens to enslave us. Freedom from desire isindeed a great liberation, for it allows us to choose and act in ways not predicated5CONCLUSIONDesire and the transformation of living187"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"on either metaphysical illusions or a desperate hankering after kinds of fulfilmentthat will always lie beyond our reach.3Western perspectivesDesire, then, appears as a gap, a discrepancy, an absent signifier.4In the first chapter we saw a broad range of views. Some key themes did emergefrom this though. Most clearly we saw many seeking to define desire in terms of‘lack’ or ‘absence’. Here the nature of desire is understood in terms of the objectof desire – it sees desire as consciousness of absence. Clearly not all awarenessof absence is the same as desire. I currently know5that I do not have an elephant’strunk protruding from my forehead – I lack this. Oddly enough though, I have nodesire for such a protuberance.Desire then is something more than just lack, or consciousness of absence. It isa positive, intentional mental state inclined at the possession of something onelacks. We might also wish to consider its negative form: intentional states inclinedat the non-possession of something we possess or might possess6– this is the desireto negate, aversion. We might see aversion as the mirror image of desire, for whatis aversion but a desire to avoid – a desire writ in negative? As such, much of whathas been said here can be seen to apply to states of aversion as well as of attraction.The Western thinking on desire as absence or deficiency was far from consis-tent though. At the most straightforward level we saw the view that we can onlydesire that which we do not possess,7but elsewhere we found desire placed at theheart of a metaphysical discourse. The insatiable nature of desire – the lack offulfilment that it represents – was, most particularly by Sartre, associated with alack of a fundamental nature. This lack can be understood as ‘nothingness’, asabsence of being. The relation between the notions of desire and absence will beexamined later in this conclusion.The powerful ideas of desire as creative and powerful – so to the fore in muchHindu thought – were, for much of the material we saw in Chapter 1, strangelyabsent. It was only in nineteenth- and twentieth-century thought that we see suchnotions emerging with any forcefulness. Even when these ideas do so, they are farfrom clear. For Nietzsche they are clothed in notions of ‘Will’, and for writers likeDeleuze we find them enmeshed in complex socio-political discourse.The most prominent contemporary writer on desire, Judith Butler, steeped inthe approach of Hegelian metaphysics and the contemporary French style ofdoing philosophy, has much to say. However, much of it is relevant only to theinternal debates of post-Hegelianism. What she does articulate thoroughly thoughis the understanding of desire as closely linked to the notion of bodies. In herconclusion she goes as far as to state:desire will be understood in the context of the interrelationship betweenhistorically specific bodies.8CONCLUSION188"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"And she goes on to suggest that ‘the “truth” of desire may well lie in a history ofbodies as yet unwritten’.9This ties desire closely with embodied existence. Likeso much later Western thought, desire is a regulator and instrument of the rela-tions of humans as beings whose bodies dictate to, as much as they are dictatedby, the nature of consciousness. The inner discourse that desire provides is one ofits own creation; it creates worlds of thought that negate. They negate the presentwith as-yet-unrealised possibilities. It is this type of approach that seems to leadButler to the final comments of her influential book:From Hegel through Foucault, it appears that desire makes us intostrangely fictive beings. And the laugh of recognition appears to be theoccasion of insight.10How are we made fictive through desire? In one sense it can be linked to the notion,found in Sartre, of negation. By negating the present we can conceive of thingsbeing other than they are. By the possession of desire, we visualise a world otherthan it currently is – a world in which we possess something we now lack; or, toavoid the use of this notion of lack, a world which is differently ordered. Desire isfictive for it is an imaginer of the non-factual, the could-be and wished-for.I must admit though that I am unsure how to understand quite what she is laughingat in the above quote. Perhaps when we recognise how we have been seeking viavisualisation, we come to see our desiring, to use existentialist terminology, asabsurd – and this insight prompts a ‘laugh of recognition’.Another key theme in the Western material surveyed was one that matchesmore explicitly with the Hindu and Buddhist approaches – at least on the surface.We did encounter, in the first chapter, desire regularly cast in a negative moralrole. Desire is what confounds our reasoning, what drives us to rash acts, to aban-don our moral sensibilities and can be seen as the core of selfish actions. Thisfound its culmination in Schopenhauer’s notion of the Will, a notion of humanenslavement that sees this force as the creator of human life as misery and toil.Of course, this was not an undisputed discourse.In Hume’s admirable scepticism and Nietzsche’s joyous affirmation, we finddissenters. One does not have to be a paid-up Freudian to recognise the signifi-cance of this approach – an approach that resists the vilification of desire andseems to offer a more fully rounded conception of the human. These dissentersrefuse to be drawn in by the bi-polar demarcation between the higher life of therational and the body-led world of desire. As we saw in Chapter 4, Buddhism alsoresists this Cartesian–Platonic approach to desire in the mind–body nexus.Overall, my examination of the Western approach was revealing. Not only forwhat was said, but that much of what was written stood almost in the margins.Desire has never been the central topic in Western philosophy, and from this onemight draw the conclusion that desire is not wholly seen as an appropriate objectfor philosophical enquiry. This may indicate the non-introspective tone that muchWestern metaphysical thought maintains. Indeed, we only find desire examined inCONCLUSION189"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"a more thorough and explicit manner once traditional Western approaches,particularly to ontology, began to be questioned and undermined in the nineteenthand twentieth centuries.Brahmanic views: desire and ontological necessityNot surely does the wind equal Kama, not the fire, not the sun, andnot the moon. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee,OKama, do I verily offer reverence.With those auspicious and gracious forms of thine, O Kama,through which what thou wilst becometh real, with these do thouenter into us, and elsewhere send the evil thoughts.11From the outset, Hindu thought wrestles with desire. The very origins of the universelie tangled with desire. While taken as a whole Hindu thought might seemambivalent to desire, we might better describe it as multivalent. We see desireoperating on numerous levels, from the cosmological to the ethical.At the heart of all these seems to lie a common conception though: desire ispowerful. Indeed, I would suggest that it is from this notion that the ethicalambivalence regarding desire flows. Desire can only be safely wielded by thecompetent. In the hands of the ignorant and greedy, it is a danger. Its ability to actas a creative force is what lies at the root of its power. By wanting we make real-ities. In a sense, the wanting of the ignorant might be seen as the tool by whichmayais crafted. From this recognition pour forth the perspectives on desire wewitnessed in Chapter 2.I am tempted to suggest that when we compare Western and Hindu concepts ofdesire, there is a striking inverted symmetry between the two. We could argue thatHinduism starts out, in its earliest origins, with desire as power – a potentiallydangerous (and often externalised) force of huge creative power and importance.But as it moves on, it views desire as something we are better off without – or thatour desires should face only God/Self-ward. This inverse symmetry might beestablished by arguing that the Western approach has moved from a view of desireas lack to a view of desire as powerful and creative.Such a rhetorical strategy just will not do, however. Why not? It looks quiteneat and has a certain satisfying closure about it. The problem lies with thecomplexity of both views. The Hindu view saw the dangers in desire from theoutset, and throughout Western thought the role of desire has been polyvalent andpolymorphous. The role of desire, in both traditions, is too wide for such a trite,albeit neat, piece of theorising.If we abandon this attempt to demonstrate a neat symmetry between Westernand Hindu approaches to desire, what do I mean by the term in the title of thissection ‘ontological necessity’? By this I seek to indicate the extent to which desireprecedes being. Desire can be seen in Hindu thought, in a way reminiscent ofcertain other well-known descriptions, as creator of the world, and its sustainer.12CONCLUSION190"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Can we even go as far as to liken desire to the fabric of the universe itself? Ifwe look at the hymn to Kamathat opens this section, then it would seem so.Beyond this though, we have seen how fundamental desire is in Hinduism. It isso basic to existence that to discuss it always draws us back to ultimate and diffi-cult questions – this is perhaps the source of its ethical ambivalence. If the entirefabric of the universe is not actually wholly woven from the threads of desire,surely at least we can see desire as a recurrent pattern – a series of criss-crossingfilaments that are interlaced into the very nature of the cosmos.Buddhism and desire: an emerging position?Who lives by no craft, unburdened, desiring the goal,With restrained faculties, wholly released,Wandering homeless, unselfish, desireless,Conceit abandoned, solitary – he is a bhikkhu.13This verse from the Udanaseems to capture something of the struggle withBuddhist thought represented by Chapters 3 and 4. Here the bhikkhuis describedas simultaneously desireless –niraso14– and desiring the goal –atthakamo.We have long abandoned the notion that Buddhism seeks the destruction of alldesires of all types. Nonetheless, the picture is still not wholly clear. The issue ofthe possibility of kusala tajhastill persists. I, for one, remain unconvinced of thenecessity of admitting such a notion. Furthermore, the attempts we have seen toraisetajhainto a cosmological principle are ultimately unconvincing, at least onthe basis of the SuttaandAbhidhammamaterial.What we have seen though, is a refining of desire. The breaking down of desireinto varying categories and types can be seen as negating the seeming paradox ofdesire mentioned in the introduction. However, it has become clear that the typo-logy of desire I set out to find is only present in part. While there are forms ofdesire which are seen as qualitatively distinct in ethical terms, this has proven tobe only part of the story.A key issue which has arisen is what ought to happen to akusalaforms of desire.This echoes both Hindu debates regarding desire and Buddhist thought on the notionofditthi. That is, ought they to be removed from the profile of our consciousness, orare they to be transformed?15On one level, one might suggest that this is a pseudoproblem, that a transformed desire represents the same thing as its removal. That is,that the two approaches are different ways of describing the same alteration withinone’scitta. Nonetheless, I am not fully persuaded that this is a sufficient explanation.In part it may be useful, but removal and transformation are not identical.A transformed phenomenon is still present,16one removed is absent. In that anarahatseems to retain certain types of wishing, one might argue in favour oftransformation, but this need not be universal. Some kusalaforms of desire maystill not be present in an enlightened being – for they would be redundant. Thenotions of striving examined in Chapter 3 are a vital component of the path, butCONCLUSION191"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"like the raft, are solely for the purpose of crossing-over. Once the journey’s end ismet, they do not seem to be needed.We might overall, then, view desire in three ways here. Some desires are suitablefor transformation. Types of chandacan be reoriented to kusalaobjects, and heldin a more kusalamanner, free of grasping. These may represent the kinds ofdesires present in arahats and Buddhas – for these beings have goal-driven acti-vity, such as the teaching of the Buddha. Even here though, to be viewed as partof the psycho-spiritual make-up of an enlightened being, these kusalaforms ofchandamust surely have been radically altered.17Most forms of desiring, as weexperience them now, must surely still be transcended – with others undergoinga transformation that may make them analogous to our desires, but qualitativelydistinct from them when present in the enlightened.Others such as tajhaneed eradicating. This does not rule out the notion ofkusala-tajhaaltogether. For to allow for such a thing does not tie us into a viewoftajhaas noble or worthy in any final sense. Having seen the kusala–akusaladistinction as one that admits of degree, we can clearly see some forms of tajhaas less akusalathan others, and maybe – for the individual at a specific point intheir spiritual development – more kusalathanakusala.Tajhacan be bestdescribed as becoming kusalawhen it begins to seek its own destruction.Third, we can identify things such as padhanawhich are kusala, but while theymay, in the religious aspirant, represent a transformation of previously held desire,they will ultimately be abandoned by one who has attained the final goal. We do notneed as many desires once the goal is attained. The functional, pragmatic, butwholly kusalaforms of striving have fulfilled their function, and – like the raft – wecan leave them on the banks of the farther shore. This tripartite approach to desiresis, I propose, compatible with the evidence I have advanced from the Pali material.What I now wish to do is to draw together some of the material from the variouschapters in a thematic fashion, so as to highlight and investigate a number of theissues which this project has identified. I begin with some reflections on thenotion of freedom.Roads to freedomFar between the sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken tollWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashingAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the soundsSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing.Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fightFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flightAn’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the nightAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.18Buddhist, and indeed other, discussions regarding the nature of desire are permeatedwith references to notions of freedom and liberation. Most commonly we haveCONCLUSION192"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"seen this in the context of how insight into the nature of desire, and a certainresponse to this insight, can be a vehicle for the attainment of freedom.In many ways, the freedom under consideration here has to be seen as a formof ‘negative’ freedom. That is, Buddhist notions of freedom are to be understoodas freedom fromvarious things. On the most obvious level, the discussion ofdesire alongside paticca-samuppadareveals that the concern here is not with thefreedom to do what you want, but rather consists in freedom from wanting itself.Of course this is a simplification, but it begins to impart a sense, and a flavour, ofthe nature of freedom in Buddhist thought.However, one of the other key thinkers who appeared in Chapter 1, and onewhom I will return to here, offers a perspective on freedom that is useful here.Jean-Paul Sartre’s notion of ‘radical freedom’ is so striking, primarily for its pres-entation of freedom as not inherently a good thing. Furthermore, it is not so muchsomething to be sought, but something we already possess, but which we need tosee the nature of in order to manage it properly.The obvious thing to draw from this is an analogy between this treatment offreedom and Buddhist attitudes to desire. If Sartre sees freedom as dominating thehuman condition, making us burdened by choice, we might argue that Buddhistssee us as burdened with desire, tajhabeing that which drives our actions. This maybe tenable, but in the Sartrean approach we flee our freedom – we deny it – andthrough acts of mauvaise foi19seek to pretend that we are not free.Do we flee desire in the same way? At times we might be seen to do so, claimingwe act out of necessity, or for some other reason, while our true motivation is thesatisfaction of desire. Nonetheless, I am not convinced that we can draw a stronganalogy between the two with any general applicability.Nonetheless, freedom matters here. The whole Buddhist engagement withdesire drives at freedom. Few would dispute the view that Buddhist thought seesdesire as limiting – and tajha-type desires are surely a prison. Not only do theykeep us contained within saÅsaricexistence, within that context they limit ourability to find contentment. Many forms of desire, as upsetter, keep us prisonersof turmoil and unhappiness. But while much talk of nibbanais framed in termsof freedom (from dukkha, from rebirth, from tajha), the road to freedom surelyis part-paved with non-tajhaforms of desire, and upon it there may even betajha-desire signposts, such a tajhafor a good object.Desire and reason: challenging a bi-polar distinctionHappiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination.20Surely reason is to be found, first and foremost, at the core ofmaddest desire!21In Chapter 1, we saw Plato recommend that reason should rule sovereignover desire, and noted that Buddhism also valued self-control. But Buddhismnever seems to split humans into the reason versus the emotions dichotomyCONCLUSION193"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"that we saw many of the Western writers of Chapter 1 using, even though wedid find some who questioned this division. A good illustration of this is thenotion of mindfulness, which can be seen to regulate both over-active reasoningand inappropriate emotion. Furthermore, mindfulness can also be used tostrengthen as well as limit. It can clarify insight, and reinforce states such assympathetic joy.In Chapter 4, we saw the suspicion and concern over the holding of views –ditthi– and alongside this a concern that takkamight well be a source of attachment.We can see a related concern in the work of the notoriously free thinkerNietzsche. We saw in Chapter 1 his admonishment of philosophers for their‘will-to-system’, and he eschews many of the traditional preoccupations ofphilosophers, going as far as asking:Granted that we want the truth: why not ratheruntruth? And uncertainty?Even ignorance?22He follows this, a few paragraphs later, with an alternative approach to assessingthe worth of a belief:The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it; it is here,perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, howfar an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving,perhaps species-rearing.23While Buddhism – at least not the type of Buddhism I have been looking athere24– might not go this far, the view that reason is to be secondary to a primarypragmatic concern is present in both these views. This radical challenge is impor-tant, it re-orientates us – and makes us as philosophers engaged in a manner thatdrives towards therapeutic, self-altering ends. Clearly there are parallels withAristotle here, but he does not go as far as Nietzsche or the Buddha.Buddhism, in this context, does not have to see reason and desire in conflict.Rather what it does is to view both as potentially useful, but is wary of them as poten-tial objects of attachment and yearning. The suspicion of reason found in somepassages in the Pali Canon should not be taken as indicating that Buddhism is irra-tional, or even non-rational.25Rather, reason is seen not as the goal, but a feature ofconsciousness that may aid us in our seeking of the goal, but may also be a waypointcapable of waylaying us.26Excessive logical analysis may prevent us moving beyondthe very point of insight and development that reason itself has brought us to.27Desire and ‘lack’This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, andthe execution confin’d;that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave to limit.28CONCLUSION194"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"All desire is bounded by a certain kind of lack – that lack of infinity in the world.While our wants may indeed, and not just in love, be boundless, the world isbounded. From the fact of mortality to the finitude of material resources, whetherpoet or economist, the world’s limitedness hems in the potential for desire’ssatisfaction.Our understanding of the relation between desire and lack, or absence, needs togo further than this though. We saw many of the Western thinkers defining desirein terms of absence, as an intentional attitude to something we do not possess.In Hindu thought, the ‘lack in desire’29was often viewed as a misperception. Likeso much Hindu thought, fulfilling the ‘lack in desire’ turns out not to be a processof acquiring that which we do not possess – but realising that we already possess it.The true object of all desires is ever-present and at hand – be it in the atmanofAdvaita–Vedanta, or the Krsja of theistic bhakti. In these perspectives, the reallackseems to be a lack of insight, or faith, rather than actual absence of a desired object.Here is where we find a significant contrast with the Buddhist approach. Thefutility of non-dhammadirected30desires derives from two factors. First, the fini-tude of embodied (and much disembodied) existence compares, as the quoteopening this section demonstrates, with the limitless nature of desire. Second, thetypeof satisfaction we seek is just plain unavailable. The Buddhist view sees‘lack’ in desire as wider than just seeking what we do not have. We seek thatwhich does not, indeed cannot, exist.So if the Buddhist view is of lack, it is of a different type of lack. Indeed, itwould seem that desire is driven by what we might term a ‘metaphysical lack’.What seems to lie behind our cravings is indeed an absence, but not solely, oreven primarily, the ostensibly desired object. The lack which drives tajha-typedesires is the lack of permanence and stability. It is the emptiness of the universethat leads to desire.31We seek something which will not let us down, which will be reliable. As wehave seen, the Buddhist universe contains no Ultimate Being or Brahman-likeessence which can provide this. Equally important is the idea that we ourselveslack any such permanence. Both objects of appropriate desire in Hindu thought –God and the Self – are either absent, or if present (like devas) are less than wethink they are.This lack of essence at the heart of our being has, since I first encounteredtheanattateaching, always put me in mind of the writing of Jean-Paul Sartre.32We can see his notion of mauvaise-foias an attempt to offer to ourselves a senseof permanence and to give meaning where there is none.One Western philosopher to connect the existential negation which we find inSartre and his ilk to Buddhist thought is William Barrett. He paints in broadstrokes his view of Buddhist thought, but evokes a powerful image:In Buddhism the recognition of the nothingness of ourselves is intendedto lead into a striving for holiness and compassion – the recognition thatin the end there is nothing that sustains us should lead us to love oneCONCLUSION195"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"another, as survivors on a life raft, at the very moment they grasp thatthe ocean is shoreless and that no rescue ship is coming, can only havecompassion on one another.33Here he seems to be in error, for indeed Buddhism explicitly teaches of the ‘furthershore’ ofnibbana, but nonetheless his imagery is striking. He sees Sartre’srecognition of nothingness as driving him in a different direction though:For Sartre, on the other hand, the nothingness of the Self is the basis forthe will to action: the bubble is empty and will collapse, and so what isleft us but the energy and passion to spin that bubble out? Man’sexistence is absurd in the midst of a cosmos that knows him not; the onlymeaning he can give himself is through the free project that he launchesout of his own nothingness.34While his view of Buddhism may be flawed, and I am not convinced that thedirections that the recognition of nothingness sends Buddhism and Sartre in areso opposed, Barrett still offers a valuable insight here. For both, the realisation ofthe lack of being within leads not to apathy and pessimism. Both Buddhism andSartre avoid espousing what Barrett calls a ‘purely passive nihilism’.35In both Sartrean and Buddhist thought the emptiness at our centre seemsalmost – to consciousness – like a vacuum, which we try to fill. This attempt todraw in, to fill this gap can be seen as the process which we find manifested inexperience as desire. This process whereby the hole at the centre of being wouldpull into it those objects in its orbits which seem to offer solidity, can be seen asthe desire of the pour-soito become en-soi, of the subject seeking to becomeobjectified.Like a black-hole that would totally fill itself, but that can never do so, this stateof affairs is spiritually – or psychologically36– hazardous. Someone that allowstheir direction to be set by the desires of a consciousness forever seeking to satisfyitself in this manner is doomed to tread a weary path to misery and frustration:As a lack of being, consciousness desires to fill itself with the in-itself.Its ideal is be the in-itself-for-itself. But this ideal is unrealizable. Itsdesire becomes a useless passion. Being unable to realize its ideal, con-sciousness is subject to constant frustration and suffering; it is unhappyconsciousness with no possibility of surpassing its unhappy state.37Of course, as mentioned above, the Hindu position we found in Chapter 2 wouldvary from this. By directing desire at the ultimate, especially as atman, the for-itself can indeed become an in-itself-for-itself – this is surely in line with thenotion of spiritual union with brahman.Others have also seen that underlying most, if not all, desires is a more generaldesire. The psychologist Lacan sees our drives and desires arising from a wish toCONCLUSION196"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"be ‘whole’. He places this sense of being not-whole in childhood – beginningeven from the differentiation that occurs at birth when we are one sex or another(‘it’s a boy’ means also ‘it’s not a girl’). His overall view of desire, albeit couchedoften in post-Freudian concepts, has a striking resonance with Buddhist thought,which Warren Hedges captures well:Lacan’s notion of desire is, at its heart, a desire for wholeness – a ‘holein the self ’ that the subject attempts to close through an endlessmetonymic chain of supplements: the perfect car, the perfect boyfriend,a tenure track job, etc. But as soon as one supplement is acquired, desiremoves onto something else. Desire is a (representational) itch than cannever truly be scratched.38This, to Buddhist ears, is almost eerily familiar. Of course, the Buddhist view maybe described as being able to remove the itch, if not through scratching it. Further,one might consider the ‘hole in the self ’ as akin to notions of anatta. Indeed thiswhole discussion on the absence that lies at the heart of desire is predicated onanatta. It is because of this structural feature of reality that tajhaforms of desireare seen as so problematic.Were the universe populated by substantial entities, be they atmanor permanentdivinity, notions of transformation might well achieve the upper hand in ouranalysis of what is to be done regarding desire. However, while this might seemto be the case, it is not clear that traditions with such beliefs go down such a road.Hinduism’s view on desire does contain this notion, but the transformatoryapproach is only dominant in some aspects of Hinduism. We do encounter sucha view in much Christian thought, where the removal of desire is, anyway, lessof a recurrent motif.There also remains another area where absence or lack with relation to desirerequires comment. That is, the lack of desire. In Buddhist thought the absence ofdesire, as we have seen, is often equated with positive spiritual states. But beforewe look at the Buddhist view, I wish to look at some other perspectives on the lackof desire.In Hindu thought, the absence of desire is often equated with ‘true desire’ –desire for God or the Self. We saw this amply demonstrated in Chapter 2. This fitsin with the transformatory approach outlined above. We might even see the term‘end of desire’ or ‘absence of desire’ in much Hindu thought as actually indicat-ing ‘no mundane desire’, ‘appropriate desire only’ or ‘exclusively God-directeddesire’. I shall consider shortly whether ‘nibbana-directed desire’ could play thesame role in Buddhist thought.Before moving on, though, I want to look at a Western perspective of sorts.While there has been concern over desire, especially among the Stoics and othersidentified in Chapter 1, the kind of discourse on desire found in both Hindu andBuddhist thought often raises certain concerns in Western thought. The concernrelates to the notion that ‘passion’ is a fundamental and vital (in both senses)CONCLUSION197"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"component of human life. To be ‘without passion’ is not, in normal socialcontexts, a compliment. Indeed, we may complain of someone that they ‘lackpassion’. Are we talking at crossed-purposes here though? By ‘passion’ in thissetting we might actually be trying to indicate something that Buddhism actuallyhas no problem with. We might mean ‘ethical commitment’, or ‘interest in life’ –but let us not gloss over this with too much ease. Much of what is indicated bythis notion is at odds with the Buddhist view – for often it reflects attachment.Western thinking lacks, as we have seen, a mainstream recommendation ofdetachment as a philosophical and religious ideal.39This notion will be addressedmore in detail shortly.Desire and goodnessThe desire of the righteous ends only in good;The expectation of the wicked in wrath.40A key concern at the outset of the project was to establish the ethical status ofdesire, in particular with reference to Buddhism, but also in more general terms.To what extent can we claim to have established such a position? We have seennegative ethical assessments of desire aplenty, but is it desire in-itself that is atfault in these instances? If we consider desire as the means of understanding thenature of the orientation of consciousness towards its objects, then desire wouldseem to lie at the heart of ethical considerations. By this reckoning, it is when wedesire that we express an ethical stance. In some senses, we could extend thisapproach to ‘willing’ in general, seeing it as the expression of the inclination ofthe mind towards the world. The Buddhist concern with the intention behind anact, in the understanding of kamma, is echoed in the famous opening words of thefirst section of Kant’sGrounding for the Metaphysics of Morals:There is no possibility of thinking of anything at all in the world, or evenout of it, which can be regarded as good without qualification, except agood will .41We do not need to adopt a Kantian ethical stance to see the importance of desireto morality. One way to view this relation has often been to see morality and desireas in conflict. One of the main deontological concerns with consequentialist ethicsis that they seem to make the desired and the good overly coincide. In a utilitarianethic, the good seems reduced to the fulfilment of desires. Many would suggestthat ethical action is about choosing the good over what we want. On the one hand,this makes ethics the process of doing what we shoulddo, rather than what wewantto do. A deeper transformation than this is required though. This deeperchange changes us from someone who, despites his desires, does the right thing; itchanges us to someone whose desired goals coincides with the good. We can seethis as the movement from a person who commits good acts, to becoming a ‘goodCONCLUSION198"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"person’. While this has the tone of Aristotelian virtue ethics, it matches much ofwhat we have seen with regard to Buddhist thought.However, one might argue that the Buddhist approach considers desire not asan attempt to redirect our processes of wanting, but as an attempt to suppresssome of our most basic human urges (such as sexual urges). The most well-knownWestern worries over the consequences of the repression of desire are found inFreudian thought.The Freudian view is that we need an honest dealing with desire, or at leastdesire as construed as the libido, rather than pushing it away and repressing it. Thereason for this stems from a direct recognition of the power of desire – thus itsrepression is a psychological strategy doomed to fail. Like weeds beneath con-crete, desire will always burst forth to sully the cleanliness and order of therepressed mind. This does not mean that desire is to be befriended in order totame it, but it shows that it requires more than pushing away; we must, for ourown mental health, not pretend it does not exist, or hope that if we ignore it, it willjust go away.This seems fair – we can see why this emerges from a Freudian view influencedby Schopenhauer, but some might be tempted to suggest that this is just whatBuddhism seems to do. Does not the bhikkhurepress their desires for sex, foodafter noon, high beds and the like? While I cannot speak for the response ofFreudian psychotherapists, Buddhist meditators might argue that their meditationpractice is a long way from the repressiveness of aspects of Victorian culture, andthe other targets of Freud’s concern.Is not the recognition of the pervasiveness of tajha– most clearly brought tothe fore here by Morrison and Matthews42– an admission of the futility of repres-sion? Furthermore, the path of the Buddhist monastic does not consist solely ofabstinence. Abstinence provides only a context – it is not the be-all and end-all ofmonastic life. A Buddhist position might well be, in response to comments above,that the aforementioned abstinences are needed to provide the psycho-spiritualdistance whereby one may begin to understand and deal honestly and openly withthe desires that arise within oneself.Desire and death: seeking the end of the world?By walking one can never reachThe end and limit of the world,Yet there is no release from sufferingWithout reaching the world’s end.Hence the wise one who knows the world,The one who has lived the holy life,Will reach the end of the world,Knowing the world’s end, at peace.He no more longs for this worldNor for any other.43CONCLUSION199"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"In seeking to escape saÅsara, we seek the end of life as currently experienced.Furthermore, if desire is the maker of our world – as I argue in the next section –then the Buddhist does indeed seek the end of the world, as in the above quotation.This is a powerful and possibly disturbing image, but what more can we say of theconnections between death and desire?In Chapter 1, we saw death linked with desire, Shakespeare offering the mostevocative articulation of this link. At a doctrinal level, such a connection might beviewed as absent from Buddhist thought, but there is a way in which we might seethem as linked. The figure of Mara embodies both death and kama, and this is anintriguing idea. He is symbolic of this connection, and we can see how akusalaforms of desire might be seen as the enemy of life. They may not, of necessity,hasten death (although they may drive us to risky behaviour at times), but they arean endangerment to the living of a fruitful life. Furthermore, tajhaleads us notonly into rebirth, but also re-death – for all that is born is, clearly, of a nature alsoto die. Desire implicates us then in coming repeatedly back to the act of dying.In another sense, death is the end of desire – the dead want not, lack not andremain only as the objects of the desires of others still alive. While the Buddhistbelief in rebirth extends us beyond a single lifetime, the prospect of our energiescoming to an end is, for most of us, one filled with dread.44But desire in the Buddhist view is what drags us beyond this annihilation – anannihilation made impossible by our lack of Self anyway; we return to being – notas the same Self, or a different Self, but as a flow. We continue as process, so thatwhile death is trauma, and death is loss, it is not the end. The only end there canbe is a noble end. Clearly there is a double meaning to this. The only worthyend, in the sense of that to be striven towards, is the cessation of all dukkhaandrebirth –nibbana– but this is also the only way to make repeated births anddeaths stop. Now it may seem a peculiar religious goal to seek the only way toend life, but is this what nibbanaactually represents?Isnibbanathe final release in the sense of being released from the burden ofexistence? I do not think it is. First, the nature of nibbanais contentious, andwhatever view we may take, it is explicitly not annihilation.45Second, for thepurposes of most humans, we are limited in the depth of our focus – we cannotsee beyond this life. Therefore, what Buddhism offers is a way of enriching thislife, of reducing the suffering (ours and that of others) in life. As such we canunderstand Buddhism not as the enemy of life, but as that which can transformlife; that which can take an existence of misery and frustration and allow us totransform it into a thing suffused with joy and calm.Desire, passion and loveLove!–you wrench the minds of the righteous into outrage,swerve them to their ruin – you have ignited this,this kindred strife, father and son at warCONCLUSION200"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"and Love alone the victor–warm glance of the bride triumphant, burning with desire!Throned in power, side-by-side with the mighty laws!Irresistible Aphrodite, never conquered–Love, you mock us for your sport.46In our examination of terms in Chapter 3, there was a serious concern with theproblems of ‘passion’, just as there was a concern with the complexities of love inChapter 2. As the earlier quote illustrates, where the Chorus bemoan the travailslove leads us into, love and passion, while often rated amongst the most valuableaspects of life, are fraught with danger and risk. While it might be tempting tosuggest that Buddhism takes the view that this is risk not worth taking, we maywish to go further – perhaps as far as claiming that not only are the odds, in thelight of aniccaandanatta, – stacked against us, but that our losing is a sure thing,a foregone conclusion.Is this pessimistic? Surely this is the kind of ‘life-denying’ approach thatNietzsche found so objectionable. Indeed, many feel that passion and love is whatmakes life worth living. Harlan Miller, drawing on Aristotle, puts this positionvery clearly:Really happy people are those actively engaged in the pursuit of somethingthey really want. Very extensive wantlessness is completely incompatiblewith happiness.47This is not a rare position amongst Western thinkers, and in Western culture moregenerally. We can see the alleged value of a life aflame with passion even in reli-gious contexts, as long as the object is the correct one. We saw this in Chapter 2with regard to bhaktiin Hinduism, but can also find it elsewhere, such as in thepoetry of Saint Theresa of Avila:O soul in God hidden from sin,What more desires for thee remain,Save but to love, and love again,And, all on flame with love within,Love on, and turn to love again?48I have heard numerous friends claim, particularly in response to Buddhist ideas,that the only thing worse than a life ruled by love and passion is a life from whichthey are absent. This seems directly at odds with a Buddhist position. Indeed, aswhen discussed in relation to Freud, many feel that not giving in to desire is moredangerous than following the path desire lays out for us:To be sure, the price to be paid to pursue one’s desire is high, butpsychoanalytic experience shows that to compromise one’s desire exactsperhaps an even higherprice.49CONCLUSION201"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"I have already argued that Buddhism seeks something other than the ‘suppression’of desire, but does it seek to – in its concern with desire – drain our life of some valu-able quality? Such a claim, that Buddhism seeks to drain the passion from life, toflatten out the highs and lows of our emotional landscape, must not go unchallenged.One might argue that the process of self-transformation that Buddhism seeksto initiate is a form of emotional housekeeping. In moving from a tumult ofcascading emotions, ripping continuously through consciousness, we may beginto move to a smaller number of vitally important psycho-spiritual processes.Buddhism seeks, for example, to promote a depth of compassion that normal,un-calmed, consciousness simply has no room or time to develop. The image ofthe Buddhist in the preceding paragraph is of an unfeeling, automata-like beingthat bears little resemblance to the ideals of character found in Buddhism.50The development of calm is important, but does not preclude feeling. Rather itis a precondition for the development of selected mental states to a fuller, richerand more ‘skilful’ (kusala) level. It is in this context that I suggest that theBuddhist project allows the individual to develop a well-crafted life. Life is some-thing to be mastered; we do not do it well out of sheer instinct, but – in my read-ing of the Buddhist view – we must develop competency in it. Insight into thenature, role and causal processes of desiring lie at the heart of this development.Desire and contingency: change and cravingHe who binds to himself a joyDoes the winged life destroy;But he who kisses the joy as it fliesLives in eternity’s sun rise.51The ultimate root of desire’s futility has been seen to be change. We saw this inChapter 1 with Seneca, and others. Excepting Christian thought, as beyondthe scope of this investigation, we see that only Hinduism seems able to find anappropriately permanent object of desire. Even nibbanawas ambiguous as anobject of desire, due to concerns about how we want it.What we find in the quotation from William Blake, above, is something alsofound in much Buddhist thought – the need to reconcile ourselves to transience.This is at the heart of the Buddhist rejection of claims that it is pessimistic.Furthermore, this should help us understand the ideas of the previous section –that it is not so much the wanting of things that is necessarily problematic; it israther the manner of our wanting that is critical. If we can learn to appreciate theworld in the context of change, of transiency, only then can we come to a life thatis capable of painless joy. In a piece written for a sick friend, the Greek poetPindar52gives a sense of how we must match our ambition to our realities:– We must ask from the GodsThings suited to hearts that shall die,Knowing the path we are in, the nature of our doom.CONCLUSION202"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Dear soul of mine, for immortal daysTrouble not: the help that is to be hadDrain to the last.53Until we achieve learn to live with both limit and transience, we can all too easilysee what the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova gets straight to the heart of, in one ofher short, untitled pieces:What’s war? What’s plague? We know that they will pass,Judgement is passed, we can see an end to them.But which of us can cope with this fear, this–The terror that is named the flight of time.54Desire and power: the creative craverI led you away from these fable-songs when I taught you:‘The will is a creator.’55Desire is a powerful force: this much stands beyond doubt at this stage. It is thenature of this power and the manner in which it expresses itself that is at stakehere. Part of how desire can be seen to create the world we live in as experienc-ing beings is linked to tajha’s long-term partner – avijja. It is through the waythat we view the world – deeply conditioned by avijja– that we come to experi-ence the world in terms of desire. One of the most fundamental misperceptions ofreality is the belief in the Self – which drives much of our desiring. This is sobecause we then move to act, cognise and emote in relation to the world in thecontext of how it applies to the Self, to ‘I’.Buddhists are not the only ones to realise the extent to which we make theworld around us, or the world-as-we-experience-it via our internal processes.Sartre presented an introductory study of how the emotions (which in hisapproach seems to include desire) in his The Emotions: Outline of a Theory,56about which Leslie Stevenson writes:This view. . . is that emotions are not things which ‘come over us’, butways in which we apprehend the world.57This seems to echo what has just been said about the Buddhist position.Desire can be seen as just such a thing. Although we saw, in Chapter 2, desire ascoming upon God in this way, it seems that for most of us, desire is a fundamen-tal factor in how we apprehend the world. But, and linked with avijja, it is morethan this; desire is what makes our lived world-of-experience58what it is. Asdiscussed in Chapter 4, the Buddhist view strongly suggests that desire is themeans by which we shape the world. In this sense it can be clearly understood ascreative. But does it go beyond this? Is desire creative in a sense that transcendsthe individual?CONCLUSION203"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Desire beyond the person: cosmic desireThe earth and sky were patterned through an intention;wind and space were patterned through an intention;water and fire were patterned through an intention.59Desire has, throughout this study, often been seen not as something that just arisesin a specific person for a specific object. This began in Chapter 1, where we founddesire discussed in terms of being a general principle, of which individual acts ofwanting are merely specific instances. This is most clearly found in Schopenhauer,where the Will acts as a world-making metaphysical principle. However, he is notthe only thinker to do this, although he does it to probably the greatest extent ofthose discussed in Chapter 1.Some have a more psychological approach, where desire arises in a generalsense, and then later takes an object. I have said little regarding Freud, his inter-ests coinciding with mine here only briefly, but we can see a useful connectionthat echoes some of the ideas raised in the conclusion to Chapter 1:There is also a noteworthy resemblance between Freud and Buddhism inemphasizing the role of the ‘instincts’ more than that of the ‘object’. Inthe last analysis what is emphasized in Buddhism is not the object or thesense organs, but the persistence of desire and lust. Freud says that thesexual instinct is in the first place independent of its object.60Here ‘sexual’ is very broad, not a narrow desire, as in Freud’s usage it encom-passes more than mere lust. We have seen some (particularly Robert Morrison)suggesting a pervasive role for tajha; here it is a metaphor for existence, the firstinstinct which drives life. On closer examination the early Buddhist texts do notwholly support this. Rather desire is not by itself anything; in the context of paticca-samuppadanothing is. Rather than a creator, desire is a condition (andconditioned); it is part of the process.In the sense discussed in the previous section, desire is the maker of worlds – itis a dominant, if not solitary (especially if we consider the status of avijja), com-ponent of our mental machinery. Nonetheless, if we wish to grant it, as we sawsome do in Chapter 2, the role of metaphysical principle – the maker of the external,empirical world – we will have to do so outside the context of the Pali Canon.Lust for life: desire and skilful livingThe same expedient – castration, extirpation – is instinctivelyselected in a struggle against a desire by those who are too weak-willed, too degenerate to impose moderation upon it.61This quote offers an intriguing perspective, and gives a sense that Nietzschebelieves that the often extreme rejection of desire – particularly when expressedCONCLUSION204"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"via the vilification of the body and the desires connected with it – is based on theinability of those who preach such a line to control their desires. As he says laterin the same section:Survey the entire history of priests and philosophers, and that of artists aswell: the most virulent utterances against the senses have notcome fromthe impotent, norfrom ascetics, but from those who found it impossibleto be ascetics, from those who stood in need of being ascetics.62From this comment, which is rather ungenerous, we get a sense of the frustrationof those engaged in combat with what their senses drive them to. I take from itthe notion that many misconceive the problem of desire. Rather than just fightingdesires, blaming ourselves for their presence and striving against them, we needto dig deeper. What is needed, I feel, is to gain insight into the causes and conse-quences of desire. Only then can we strive calmly, rather than in haste, panic, guiltand fear. The preceding chapters have led me to the view that the ‘core value’ thatone finds in the Pali Canon is neither insight nor compassion – though both arecorollaries of it. For me, the key here is calm. Calm allows us to assess desires –to make kusala–akusalajudgements – and to harness or release desires as we seefit. A fear of desire is as potentially dangerous as abandoning ourselves to itshedonistic embrace. If we see desire as the upsetter, then the overcoming ofdesire lies not in fleeing from it like a startled beast. Rather, spiritual victory liesin stillness – in equanimity.Contentment is of great value in Buddhist thought, and beyond. Contrastingwith the desire for a life burning with passion, aflame with desire, contentmentmay appear dull. Indeed the path of contentment is all too easily associated withlethargy, apathy and complacency. Clearly the Buddhist view emphasises onthat which has to be done prior to contentment, the energy we must muster, andthe work (albeit meditative) laid out for the monk or nun; this is not lethargy. All thesame the attitude of many people to contentment is ambivalent.In reflecting on Western perspectives, it would be too easy and inaccurate tosay that contentment is undervalued. Actually, from the stoics onward, we find ahealthy tradition of the seeking of peace. In the end, the Buddhist material offeredonly a partial typology of desire, but in many ways it offered much more than this.Its response to desire is not born out of fear, nor enmity, but seeks to be thera-peutic, as much as it is philosophical. Indeed, rather than leading us away, out ofour personal thoughts into abstracted forms of reasoning, its intent seems to be toturn us back upon ourselves – to turn us inward – so that we may face our desireshead on. Only then can we come to a reckoning with them, and may, armed witha stilled and calm consciousness, in the end overcome.CONCLUSION205"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"206This short glossary is to assist the reader unfamiliar with Indian religious thought.It does not seek to engage with theoretical issues related to the terms involved,as this – where necessary – is contained within the main body of the book.(S) Indicates a Sanskrit term, and (P) indicates a Pali term.

If you point a gun at me, as in theexample, and tell me that I must drink another cup of coffee or you will kill me, my‘desire to drink a coffee’ evinced by my actually drinking it, is surely an expressionof a more fundamental desire – not to be shot!26 Plus, of course, an inner conflict can arise when our competing desires within usdo not coincide. A desire to be healthy, and a desire to gorge oneself on creamcakes are likely to lead to an inner-conflict of desires as we stand at the door of thefridge.27 See, for example, M.I.137.28 Never mind that once we do get what we want, we all too often decide that it wasn’twhat we wanted after all, or that we now want something else. In some ways I amreminded here of a child’s tantrum – once one finally caves in and gives them thesweet they were crying for, they decide that the one they actually want is the one theyrejected at the shop, and you no longer have with you.29 Dollimore, J., Death, Desire & Loss in Western Culture. p. xii.30 In one sense we might claim that Abhidhammaprovides a glimpse into early Buddhistself-understanding – the way that early Buddhism came to an appreciation of whatwas indicated in the suttas.31 For a complete opposite of this view, albeit somewhat on the verges of contemporary‘Analytic’ thought, see A. J.

This was, ultimately,felt to portray, as it were, too mechanistic (and possibly reductionist) a picture of theBuddhist understanding of persons. ‘Dynamics’ seeks to capture more fully theBuddhist approach to our nature as persons.37 Goethe, ‘Spruch, Widerspruch’ [‘Saying and Gainsaying’].

A Buddhistaccount might reverse the two, seeing dukkhaas based on anicca(as lack of stabil-ity), or anatta(as lack of substantiality). Schopenhauer seems convinced that lack ofwholeness is miserable – that completion is the unobtainable goal we crave. Thisclearly echoes the Platonic approach in the Symposium, and to an extent foreshadowsthe work of Lacan.69 Schopenhauer, A., The World as Will and Representation.

We would rather will nothingness than not will – the pervasive will,sublimated maybe, but ever-present.105 Lechte, J., Fifty Key Contemporary Thinkers. p. 104.106 And to an extent, as I demonstrate in Chapter 2, like the Veda-Samhitas. Furthermore,a number of contemporary Continental philosophers seek to incorporate desire intothe discourse-lineage of Marxist and Hegelian thought. While this is beyond currentpurposes, books such as Lyotard’sEconomie Libidinalepoliticise desire and seek tolocate it in the realm of socio-political construction.107 We might also wish to consider parallels between Nietzsche’s notion of the Will-to-Power, especially when sublimated, and the notion of turning desire upon itself foundin some later Buddhist texts – see Bernard Faure’sThe Red Thread: BuddhistApproaches to Sexuality, where he discusses this in some detail.108 Stoeber, M., Dostoevsky’s Devil: The Will to Power.

The Nyayaapproach seems based primarily onthe removal of ignorance, via reasoning (be it through inference or analogy).9 Biardeau, M., Hinduism: The Anthropology of a Civilization. p. 71.10 In Buddhism avijja– ignorance – is the prime root of rebirth, see PED, p. 85.Furthermore, ignorance is even in the background of acts leading to positive karmicresults. In the Buddhist view, the enlightened do not generate karmic results, and soall those who generate positive karmic consequences from their acts must still be inpossession of avijja.11 It has been suggested to me [by Dr Dermot Killingley, University of Newcastle uponTyne (Retired)] that this is a poor translation and that ‘desire came upon it in the begin-ning’ is more accurate – desire as upsetting the balance – wanting as the first dualismof the monistic One. The second translation here seems more along these lines.12 Unless otherwise indicated, the original Sanskrit term for ‘desire’ in the citations fromHindu texts in this chapter is kama(orkamayatewhere ‘desire’ is a verb).

The undetermined questions at S.IV, 373–400.9 Although devotion and respect are still expressed to ‘him’.10 In the suttas we find numerous occasions where homage is paid to the Buddha. Oneof the most interesting is Vakkali. This bhikkhu, in the Khandasaμyutta(S.III.120f ),pays homage to the Buddha before the moment he takes his own life. Despite thisapparent suicide, Vakkali is still said to have attained nibbana. See n. 172 of CDB(p.1082) for an account of the commentary’s explanation of this incident.11 Along, of course, with the practising of this teaching – and by extension, that whichthis practice leads to.12 The problems with ‘views’ (ditthi) will be examined more fully in Chapter 4.13 This can also be seen as linked with the problems arising from the belief in a perma-nent Self – ‘Iknow the truth, youdon’t’.14 M.I.160–75.15 A Hindu being – a form of Brahma, the most senior of Hindu devas.16 This is rather a Christian-sounding set of attributes, but the devas lack of them, in aBuddhist understanding, does seem to quite well capture their lack of ultimatesignificance/status.17 I had hoped to follow up some of the issues raised by this episode, particularly theidea which seems expressed in the suttathat the Buddha may have foreseen the pos-sibility of his suffering mental weariness. However, due to considerations of space, Ihave had to leave these issues to be explored elsewhere.18 This is not a full definition of dukkha, but rather an illustrative one.19 Collins, S., Selfless Persons. p. 6.20 We need not make too big a thing of this. We might see it as no more that asking an influ-ential person for help – it is just in this case that the being asked is a deva, not a human.21 As, indeed, are all the things that humans usually focus their desires upon.22 D.III.207–271.23 One presumes that this refers to beings residing in one of the hells that exist in theBuddhist view of the cosmos, though ‘states of woe’ could also apply to animals andpetas.24 D.III.218.

Thisdistinction can be traced to M. Spiro’sBuddhism, and Society.26 At least in the Buddhist view. One’s attitude to the atmanin Hinduism is radicallyaltered by the identity of the atmanwithbrahman. The ‘I-am’ belief which the anattateaching is in opposition to has a radically different status in Buddhist thought.27 Harvey, P., An Introduction to Buddhism. p. 52.28 Kalupahana, D., Buddhist Philosophy: A Historical Analysis. p. 69.NOTES223"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"29 Of course, of the previous candidates, Buddhist Dhammais the most difficult to reject – butwe can see this, in a sense, as related to the desire for nibbana, for that is whatfollowing the Dhammawill ultimately lead to. The problems with even correct viewsas objects of attachment is discussed in Chapter 4.30 In addition to this, we can also place the joy we can allegedly generate on theBuddhist path in the positive column to balance the common presentation ofBuddhism as negative or miserable in tone and content.31 Whatever Nietzsche may say. For his description of Buddhism as a nihilistic religion,see Nietzsche, The Anti-Christ, Section 20, p. 129.32 To attain a state of nibbana, one must be free from alldesire – even kusalaforms. Inan article on animitta(signless) mental states, Peter Harvey states that any mental statethat has nibbanaas its object, if I read his argument correctly, is still an object-fulmind-state. The final attainment occurs when we have:viñña~a, schooled so as not to be taken in by nimittasand worldly objects, doesnot even take nibbana as object, but, objectless, transcends conditions and is theunconditioned.Harvey, P., ‘ “Signless Meditations” in Pali Buddhism.’ InJournal of theInternational Association of Buddhist Studies.

(Nibbanais described as the ‘stopping of the world’ –loka-nirodha.) This posi-tion may be questioned by some Mahayana thought, but nibbanais certainly to bedrawn in contrast to the world of the Self and gods.39 While this Sanskrit term for ‘own-nature’ is frequently associated with Mahayanathought, it seems to capture, here, something of the Theravada approach. Further-more, Sarvastivada Buddhism did use the notion of svabhavain explaining the natureofdhammas. Theravada thought also uses the notion to examine dhammas, but in dif-fering ways. See Harvey, P., An Introduction to Buddhism. p. 87. For more on svab-havasee SED, p. 1276.40 Although Alexander Piatigorsky prefers, for Buddhist thought, the term ‘meta-psychology’ – as he wishes to contrast the Abhidhamma approach with that of(presumably Western) reductionist approaches.

If you do not know of death, you will not be in a posi-tion to desire to avoid it. However the notion that ‘ignorance reduces desire’ is notreally found in Buddhism. Ignorance of certain things may mean that we do not desirethem, but is unlikely to prevent us desiring something.NOTES224"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"45 We might see the compassion as coming later – the initial effect as being of shock,but I always feel the shock of these events in Gotama as going beyond ‘self-interest’.46 M.I.163.

For an account of the dangers of dosaand it being contrasted with khantipatience – see Vism.295.78 PED, p. 331. There can easily arise some confusion here, as the Sanskrit term doshais equivalent to the Pali term dosa, both meaning ‘evening’ or ‘night’. However asecond meaning of doshain Sanskrit is of ‘fault, vice, deficiency, want’ (SED,p. 498.). See SED, p. 498 and PED, p. 332.79 SED, p. 507.80 Which I would wish to clearly distinguish from a ‘dull indifference’.81 The PED, p. 543, gives mohaas ‘stupidity, dullness of mind and soul, delusion, bewil-derment, infatuation’.82 As it does in some suttacontexts.83 SED, p. 905.84 PED, p. 588.85 De Silva, C.

Perhaps the best way weNOTES226"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"can view saragais as something akin to ‘lustful’, and not so very far from raga, towhich it is etymologically linked.89 The PED gives gedhaas ‘greed’ (PED, p. 253). This is sometimes found*in connec-tion with sense pleasures, in the form kamesu gedha, such as in the Appaka sutta(S.I.73–4), where beings that obtain some degree of worldly success are described as,all too often, kamesu gedhaμapajjanti– falling into greed for sense-pleasures (CDBgives this as ‘yielding to sense-pleasures’, p. 169).When we find gedhaalone, such as in the Mahasuññata Sutta(M.III.117), it isnotable that it again occurs in combination with apajjati– to yield to, or fall into. Weare told in this suttaof those who, when in seclusion (but, it would seem, followingthe wrong teacher), are visited by Brahmins and the like and fall back into worldlyconcerns. Antevasupaddavo, a disaster for the pupil, or what MLD calls a ‘pupil’sundoing’ (MLD, p. 977.), comes about when they gedhaμapajjati,avattati bahullaya(M.III.117) – ‘fall into greed, and return to luxury’. Thus it seems that gedhaseemsprimarily concerned with the greed that can torment a renunciant – that which canupset one trying to make spiritual progress – and we saw in Chapter 2 the potential ofdesire as an ‘upsetter’.[*The PED claims this is a common connection – of kamesu gedha, but I foundit to be quite rare, especially in the Suttas. A search of the entire CSCD edition(usingkamesu gedh*[where ‘*’ is a ‘wildcard’]) revealed only three instances,two here in the cited passage from the Appaka sutta, and one in the Culaniddesa.Indeed, gedhais found in the CulaniddesaandMahaniddesamore than it isanywhere else.]90Paπka– literally ‘mud, mire’. See PED, p. 382.91 TBA (p. 470) translates janikaandsañjananias ‘genetrix, fettering genetrix’. Theobscure English term ‘genetrix’ means mother. The PED gives sañjananaas ‘pro-ducing, progenetrix’ (p. 670) and janikais a form of janaka(see PED, p. 278). Whilejanakarelates again to production, janikarelates to the idea of a ‘mother’ again. Inthe context of this confusion, I have opted for a non-literal option that I hope conveysthe appropriate feel.92 See PED, p. 710, where this term is identified with desire – presumably as part of abinding up with lust, a net of lust.93Visattikais a fairly common term for desire, which the PED notes is ‘almost alwaysa syn. of ta~ha’ (PED, p. 639). So much is it a synonym of ta~hathat it very oftenappears in close proximity:Yassa jaliniVisattikata~hanatthi kuhiñci netave.Taμbuddham anantagocaraμapadaμkena padena nessatha.(Him in whom there is not that entangling, embroiling craving to lead (any life),him the trackless Buddha of infinite range,– by which way will you lead him?)Dhp. 180. Translation from DP, p. 162. (Also see Dhp. 335.)It may have a little more of the sense of ‘clinging’ or ‘attachment’ thanta~ha, butthere is little else to distinguish it.94 This and the previous term both use vana, which is, as PED, p. 608 indicates, oftenalso equated with vana– also ‘jungle’: both have a strong figurative sense of desire.The image of desire as a jungle is powerful. Desire is something we become lost in,cannot find a way out of and, stretching the image a little, a jungle is something weneed a guide to help us through to the farther side. There can also be as a relation hereto the term Nirva~a– which we could take as ‘absence of jungle’ – to be enlightenedis to have found a way out of the tangled jungle of desire.95Sinehahas a primary meaning of ‘viscous liquid, unctuous moisture’ (PED, p. 710),and we can see here the idea of desire as ‘sticky’, echoing some of the Jain notionsNOTES227"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"discussed in Chapter 2. Affection can be seen as moist in that we form bonds andattachments easily under its influence. There is also the term pemawhich indicateslove and affection. In the Khaggavisa~a sutta (Sn.41), we see pemaas something tobe avoided, as part of the fondness that leads to distress at the inevitable separationfrom those we are fond of. It is part of a series of verses that entreat us, for our ownsakes, to ‘wander alone’.96 The term jappais a rarely used one, but a good illustration of a solidly akusalaform of desire. The PED gives it as ‘desire, lust, greed, attachment, hunger’. (PED,p. 279). We find jappain an unambiguous setting at Sutta-Nipata945 (in the Attada~daSutta, 15.11):Gedhaμbrumi mahoghoti, ajavaμbrumi jappanaμ;aramma~aμpakappanaμ,kamapaπko duraccayo.(I call this craving the great flood, I call this being absorbed in desire, attentiveto sense-objects. The swamp of desire is hard to cross.)Jappahere is something that is part of the great bog, or swamp of kama. As such, itrepresents something to be overcome. We can also see jappaas negative, as akusala,at Sn.1033, jappabhilepanaμbrumi, dukkhamassa mahabbhayaμ– ‘The hunger ofdesire pollutes the world, and the source of great fear is the pain of suffering’ (Trans.Snip. p. 118).97Pucchañjikatais a rare term, and there seems to be some confusion over how totranslate it. The PED, p. 463, notes this, and refers to the commentary to thispassage. It seems that it may relate to anxiety about possession or non-possession ofobjects.98Sadhukamyatais an interesting term. It is desire for sadhu(which the PED, p. 703,gives as good, virtuous, pious). TBA, p. 470, renders it as ‘desire for the nicer’. It maybe seen here in the context of being a form of lobhaas a desire for a possibly goodobject – but wrongly held, possibly for the wrong reasons. Vibh.351 lists it as a formoftinti~a– a form of greedy desire, and it directly precedes a list relating to personalvanity. We might see it as a form of conceit or possibly pride.99 TBA, p. 479, gives adhammaragoas ‘incestuous lust’, and LDB, p. 401, (D.III.70)opts for ‘incest’ – drawing on commentarial readings of the term. It can be seen asinappropriately directed forms of lust.100Nikantiis another term for desire, possibly derived from kama. The PED ( p. 351)gives its derivation as from the Sanskrit nikantibased on ni\u0001kamati, and its mean-ing as ‘desire, craving, longing for, wish’.Nikantioccurs primarily in commentarialtexts. I give it as ‘longing’ here only to provide some vartiety in the translation.101 In this context we can see dhammata~haas craving not after the Dhamma in a gen-eral – positive – sense, but in the abhidhammasense of dhammas.102Yo rago sarago anunayo anurodho nandinandirago cittassa sarago icchamucchaajjhosanaμgedho parigedho saπgo paπko ejamayajanikasañjananisibbinijalinisaritavisattikasotaμvisataayuhanidutiyapa~idhi bhavanetti vanaμvanatho san-thavo sineho apekkhapatibandhuasaasisanaasisitattaμrupasasaddasagandhasarasasaphotthabbasalabhasadhanasaputtasajivitasajappaabhijappajappanajap-pitattaμloluppaμloluppayanaloluppayitattaμpucchañjikatasadhukamyataadhammarago visamalobho nikanti nikamanapatthanapihanasampatthanakamata~habhavata~havibhavata~harupata~haarupata~hanirodhata~hasad-data~harupata~hagandhata~harasata~haphotthabbata~hadhammata~haogho yogogantho upadanaμavara~aμnivara~aμchadanaμbandhanaμupakkileso anusayopariyutthanaμlatavevicchaμdukkhamulaμdukkhanidanaμdukkhappabhavomarapaso maraba¬isaμmaravisayo ta~hanadita~hajalaμta~hagaddulaμta~hasamuddo abhijjhalobho akusalamulaμ– ayaμvuccati “lobho”.NOTES228"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"In translating this passage I make use of TBA (p. 470–1), but also try to offer my ownview on certain terms. It is also worth noting that TBA mistranslates jappaas ‘mutter-ing’ – due to confusion with the Sanskrit root jap(see SED, p. 411). Pali also containswords, such as japatiandjapana(see PED, p. 279), for muttering from this root – it isclear here that it is jappaas a form of desire that is intended.103 PED, p. 118.

It says, after mentioning Plato’sPhaedo(458,9), that ‘neither the Greek nor the Indian thinker has thought itnecessary to explain how this effect is produced.’ This is an odd comment. It clearlycannot refer to how the state of ta~hais produced because it follows the statementabove with a discussion of the production of ta~hain the formula of paticca-samuppada. It can only then refer to the issue of how a certain type of hunger-likedesire is able to bring about the phenomenon of rebirth. Does Buddhism really notoffer an account of this process – it, as I argue in Chapter 4, certainly seems to offerjust such an account.266 See SED, p. 454.267 The PED gives sahagata( p. 700) as ‘accompanying, connected with, concomitant’ –although in this famous verse the exact sense which is intended does not seemimmediately obvious.268 D.II.308:Katamañ ca, bhikkhave, dukkha-samudayaμariya-saccaμ?Yayaμta~haponobhavikanandi-raga-sahagatatatra tatrabhinandini,seyyathidaμkama-ta~habhava-ta~havibhava-ta~ha.269 The place of ta~hainpaticca-samuppadawill be more fully explored in Chapter 4.270 Robert Morrison, whose views will be addressed in more detail shortly, speculatesabout why this might be the case – arguing that its poetic tone and figurative deriva-tion makes it less suited to be the abstraction and listing of Abhidhammamaterial.

Nanda is, in Ud.3.2, considering disrobing due to a preoc-cupation with a beautiful girl he knew. The Buddha offers Nanda ‘Five hundred pinkfooted nymphs’ (Ud-It, p. 37) if he will remain living the monastic lifeunder the Buddha. Nanda promptly agrees, but later, upon realising nibbana,releases the Buddha from his promise to supply the nymphs. There are all kinds ofissues raised by this episode, but primarily it shows not only the pedagogic flexibil-ity of the Buddha, but also how the notion of relative, as well as absolute, conceptionsof the good are accommodated in Buddhist thought.318 Even though some aspect of ta~hais seen to persist until Arahatship.319 At least for our own liberation. Work on the behalf of others can be seen to continuein the enlightened – unless they are a PaccekaBuddha, who does not teach.320 At least with respect to the Vedic view, and although I take on board thecritique offered by Richard Gombrich, where he claims that what the Buddha arguesagainst is the Upanisadic view of the Self, which is ‘something very few westernershave ever believed in and most have never heard of ’ (Gombrich, R., How BuddhismBegan. p. 16), I still think that the anattateaching rules out much contained in certainWestern views of Selfhood. These issues will be, to an extent, returned to inChapter 5.321 Or believe that we are without – as is the case for much of the discussion inChapter 2.

However, constrictions of space have notenabled me to do so here.4 After our examination of the Upanisads, perhaps this is less surprising than it mightotherwise be. The Upanisads are well-known for viewing knowledge as salvific, andalso see this process as caught up with the overcoming of desire.5 Although, as Ñanamoli and Bodhi point out (p. 1222, n. 341 of MLD), the actualstatement is not found as said by the Buddha anywhere in the Canon. Even with theaid of modern technology (i.e. CD-ROMs) I have been unable to locate this statementin any discourse directly delivered by the Buddha.6 Here passatiis rendered as ‘to see’, but ‘to understand’ or ‘to have insight into’ areequally good terms.

We can see this discussed at M.I.111–2,where we can see that ‘sañjanati’, cognition, arises from vedana. There seems scopehere for the notion that vedanadoes not have to, always, lead to ta~ha. Either by inter-vening in the stages that sit between the two, or via altering other conditioning factors(such as the undermining of avijja), the arising of ta~hain response to vedanacan beprevented. In A.IV.146–7, cognition and volition (cetana) are implied as sittingbetween the arising of vedanaandta~ha.

J., The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge. p. 58f.39 Although this makes it more like the kinds of things that mano, as a sense, has as itsobjects –dhammas.40 Harvey, P., An Introduction to Buddhism. p. 59. Also see Harvey, P., The Selfless Mind,Chapter 5. We can see this in the suttas at S.IV.95, where the manner in which we con-struct the world of our lived experience is explained. Interestingly this is a more detailedclarification of the passages on the end of the ‘world’ that I discuss in the final chapter.41 MLD, p. 1186.42 What would an external state of mind be like, one wonders?43 MLD, p. 1187.44 Or at the very least conditions the consciousness-event-series to arise as ear-consciousness.45 Matthews, B., Craving and Salvation. p. 25.46 Although he is right in claiming that in M.I.293 (the Mahavedalla Sutta), ‘perceptionand feeling come before viñña~a’ (Ibid., p. 25), more interesting is the claim in theMahavedalla Suttathat feeling, perception and consciousness (vedana, saññaandviñña~a) arise not so much sequentially but intertwined together. M.I.293 states:‘feeling, perception and consciousness, friend – these states are conjoined, notdisjoined’.(Trans. from MLD, p. 389; Yacavuso, vedanayaca saññayañca viñña~aμ–ime dhammasaμsattha, no visaμsattha.)The text goes on to state that they cannot be separated out from each other and that itis impossible to describe the difference between them. This demonstrates what Iwas saying earlier with regard to the intertwined nature of paticca-samuppada,and the difficulty of extracting linear sequential understandings of cause-and-effectfrom it.47 Were I being pedantic, I could suggest that there is no-thing that hasthe experience(in the light of anatta), and could rather ask wherethe experience occurs within theBuddhist model.48 Matthews, B., Craving and Salvation. p. 39.49 In the sense of viewing manoas part of the overall experience of consciousness.NOTES241"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"50 Translation from MLD, p. 284; M.I.191:Yato ca kho, avuso, ajjhattiko ceva mano aparibhinno hoti, bahiraca dhammaapathaμagacchanti, tajjo ca samannaharo hoti, evaμtajjassa viñña~abha-gassa patubhavo hoti.51 Dhp 233:Manopakopatakkheyya, manasasatvuto siya;Manoduccaritathitva, manasasucaritatcare.52 Here we find the phrase manasaditthigatani cintayanto– ‘thinking in the mind ofdiffering views’.

The first twelve can be seen ascorresponding to the twelve ayatanas. This term, ayatana, can be seen to representthe ‘sphere of perception’ (PED, p. 105) – the world of senses and their objects.61 Translation from TBA, p. 114. Vibh. 88.Tattha katamamanodhatu?

This process of conscious-ness becomes part of a complex explanation of the manner in which perceptionoccurs. As such, while interesting, I follow it no further here.63 While five-sense-based forms of vedanamay not be seen as subjective in this way, ifwe see manoas an integrator of what arises via the physical sense, we can see all expe-rience as, in one way or another, being mediated via the mano-consciousness process.64 We might describe this ignorance as twofold. On one hand there is the misperceptionof reality, partly due to negative conditioning factors. Second there is what we mightterm ‘ignor-ance’ – the choosing to ignore that which is difficult or overly challengingto the way we select to view the world.NOTES242"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"65 Matthews, B., Craving and Salvation. p. 34.66 We might be more precise, and claim that in some senses, ta~hais spark, whileupadanais the up-taking of the fuel.67 To maintain this image, we might describe avijjaas the oxygen – the necessarycontext for the fire.68 Although this only applies to one of the forms of petas.69Pit®.70 See PED, p. 472.71 Mil. 294.72 QKM, Vol. II, p. 151.73 Harvey equates nama-rupawith the term ‘sentient body’, but does not includeviππa~ain it.

See M.I.56 on this approach, wherebreathing practice is used to still the body.79 M.I.58:ayampi kho kayo evaμdhammo evaμbhavievaμ-anatito.80 For example in Chapter 6, Asubha-kammatthana-niddesa– foulness as a subject ofmeditation.

Given by the PED as ‘reasoning, consideration, examination’ (PED, p. 159),this term is fairly rare in the Canon. If we look to the newer ADP definition, we cansee that uhanais still some way from ‘reason’ in the logical sense: ‘paying attention(to), considering; reasoning, deliberation’ (ADP, p. 524). This then, is rather likesome of the above terms.218 The factors of awakening – the bojjhakgas – are discussed in detail in Chapter 5 ofGethin’sThe Buddhist Path to Awakening.219 LDB, p. 420.

(Eds.), BuddhistStudies in Honour of Walpola Rahula. p. 119.227Ditthi, in negative forms, can be seen as a combination of the two – the graspingrelates to desire, the avijjarepresenting the partiality of asserting one set of viewsover another in a way based on misperception.228 There may also be an element of ‘ignor-ance’ here: having a vague sense of uneaseabout our desires, but surpressing or ignoring it.229 Translation from Ud-It. p. 184.

They would not just beinactive, but aprapti– permanently turned off.16 If we take an Abhidhammaview, no phenomenon can continue to be present overtime – at least if we take seriously the notion of ‘momentariness’ – whereby mentalstates are constantly passing away and arising. The effect, however, within ourconsciousness appears as seamless.

If we take seriously the idea of ‘skil-ful means’ – a belief may be valuable to an individual, in that it propels them towardBuddhahood, but not true in any absolute sense – particularly in the context of theemptiness (funyata) of all dharmas.25 In the sense Rudolph Otto uses the idea in his Idea of the Holy– although the expe-rience of nibbanamay be rather akin to his concept of the numinous.26 Of course, Zen Buddhism is renowned for its concern with seeking to move us beyondthe limits of the rational, most obviously via the use of koans.27 Were reason capable of delivering us from our woes, we would surely see the spectacleof depressed patients emerging from their therapists with logic textbooks in their hands.To an extent, though, some have wished to extend the role of ‘reason’ in therapeuticcontexts – such as the recent developments in ‘philosophical counselling’ and aspectsof cognitive behavioural therapy. None but perhaps the most enthusiastic proponents ofthese approaches would be likely to suggest that reason is the solution to all our mentalills. In seeking, especially in philosophical counselling, to encourage clear thinking inthe troubled, the approach seems partly in concurrence with the Buddhist methods Ihave been outlining here (except that, for the Buddhist, we all need this therapy).28 Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida. 3.1.80.29 The sense that we are seeking to obtain that which we have not.30 And possibly some dhamma-directed desire. An akusala-ta~hadesire for spiritualprogress, a grasping after enlightenment is not helpful, and by definition – by beingakusala– it will not contribute to forward movement on the path.31 Along with our misperception of this, and possibly our refusal to recognise this – ourignor-ance.32 I am also, in this context, somewhat taken by the French writer Paul Valéry’s line:‘God made everything out of nothing.
