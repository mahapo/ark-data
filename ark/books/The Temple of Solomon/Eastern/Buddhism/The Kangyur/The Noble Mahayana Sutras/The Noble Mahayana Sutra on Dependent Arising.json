[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IntroductionI.1The topic of this sūtra, as is evident from its title, is the Buddhist doctrine of thedependent arising of conditioned phenomena. This concept is considered by many Buddhists to be the essence of the teaching, the Dharma. Dependent arising is often presented as a series of twelve links (nidāna) of causes and effects that begins with ignorance and ends with death. This schema is found in many canonical texts, and is the principal topic of the two works that precede the present sūtra in the Degé Kangyur, the Śālistambhasūtra (Rice Seedling Sūtra, Toh 210), and the Pratītyasamutpādādivibha gaṅnirdeśasūtra (Sūtra Teaching Dependent Arising with Its Beginning and Divisions, Toh 211).1I.2The teaching on dependent arising is epitomized by the famous “creed” (dhāra īṇ) in verse-form, stating that the Buddha teaches the causes for the arising of phenomena as well as that which is their cessation. This verse formula is perhaps best known from a narrative in the Vinaya recounting Śāriputra’s life. The story tells of Upati ya (as Śāriputra was called before he met the Buddha) first hearing ṣabout the Buddha from Aśvajit, one of the Buddha’s five erstwhile companions and earliest disciples. When Upati ya asks Aśvajit to summarize the very essence of the ṣBuddha’s teaching, Aśvajit answers him by reciting this verse. As soon as he hears it, Upati ya immediately attains a preliminary state of realization.ṣ2I.3In the sūtra translated here, however, these same lines are taught toAvalokiteśvara by the Buddha himself.3 The Buddha then instructs his followers to insert them into stūpas in order to generate the merit of Brahmā, an extraordinary type of merit.4 The practice of inserting these verses, as well as impressing or inscribing them on religious images, appears to have become popularduring the second half of the first millennium,5 and was observed by Xuanzang in the seventh century.6 The creed can be found inscribed on, or inserted within, miniature caityas or stūpas at holy sites throughout the Buddhist world such as Sarnath, Bodh Gaya, and Rājag ha, as far east as Kedah and Java, and as far west asṛAfghanistan.7 This practice was continued by the Tibetans into the second millennium and to this day it is considered by Buddhists to be a meritorious act.8I.4Xuanzang mentions that these objects were considered relics of the Dharma (dharmaśarīra). Buddhist scripture came to be identified as a type of relic of the Buddha from the time of early Mahāyāna discourse, according to which worshipping the words of the Buddha was considered to be equivalent, if not"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"superior, to worshipping the Buddha himself.9 Canonical sources, such as the Śālistambasūtra(Toh 210), have furthermore equated dependent arising with the Dharma itself.10Thus, inserting or inscribing the verse of dependent arising empowers an object just as a fragment of the Buddha’s remains would.11 Included in the Tibetan text of this sūtra is the Sanskrit transliteration of the verse, implying that they were used like a mantra or dhāra īṇ;12 the Sanskrit syllables are considered potent in their own right as a manifestation of the Dharma and thus of the Buddha himself.I.5The sūtra is found in three places within the Kangyur, as well as in an abridged version in two locations.13 To date we do not know of any extant Sanskrit original version, and although there appear to be a few minor spelling mistakes and inconsistencies found in some versions, there are no significant variations among the available Tibetan texts.THE TRANSLATIONThe Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra onDependent Arising1.1[F.125a] Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!1.2Thus did I hear at one time. The Blessed One was in the Realm of the Thirty-Three Gods, seated on the throne of Indra. With him were great hearers such as the venerable Aśvajit; bodhisattva mahāsattvas such as noble Maitreya, nobleAvalokiteśvara, and Vajrapā iṇ, who were adorned with immeasurable precious qualities; as well as various gods such as the great Brahmā, who is the lord of theSahā world, Nārāya aṇ, the great Īśvara, Śakra, who is the chief of the gods, andPañcaśikha, who is the king of the gandharvas.1.3On that occasion, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara rose from his seat and, having draped his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the peak of Mount Meru. His palms together, he then bowed toward the Blessed One and addressed to him these words:1.4“Blessed One, these gods all really wish to build a stūpa. Now that they are present"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in this entourage, please teach them the Dharma in such a way so that theirmerit of Brahmā [F.125b] will increase, and the merit of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will increase much more than that of all types of beings in the world of gods, māras, and Brahmā, including renunciants and brahmins.”1.5At this, the Blessed One spoke the verses of dependent arising:ye dharmā hetuprabhavā hetu te ā tathāgato hy avadatṃṣṃte ā ca yo nirodha eva vādī mahāśrama a ṣṃṃṇḥ 14“All phenomena that arise from causes,The Tathāgata has taught their cause,And that which is their cessation;Thus has proclaimed the Great Renunciant.1.6“Avalokiteśvara, it is like this. This dependent arising is the dharmakāya of all the tathāgatas. A person who sees dependent arising sees the Tathāgata. Avalokiteśvara, if a faithful son or daughter of a noble family builds, in a remote place, a stūpa the size of a gooseberry fruit, with a central pillar the size of a needle and a parasol the size of a flower of the bakula tree, and inserts this verse of dependent arising which is the dharmadhātu, he or she will generate the merit of Brahmā. When such persons pass on from here and die, they will be reborn in the world of Brahmā. When they pass on from there and die, they will be reborn with fortunes equaling those of the gods of the Pure Abodes.”151.7After the Blessed One had thus spoken, the hearers, bodhisattvas, the whole assembly, and the universe of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised his words."}]
