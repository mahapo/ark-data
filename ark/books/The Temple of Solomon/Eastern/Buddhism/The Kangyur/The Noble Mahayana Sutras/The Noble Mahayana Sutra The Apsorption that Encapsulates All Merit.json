[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IntroductionI.1Like a number of other Great Vehicle sūtras, The Absorption That Encapsulates AllMerit consists of a rich and at times disjointed amalgam of stories, teachings, and conversations. Although the sūtra begins in a seemingly historical setting in the vicinity of Vaiśālī, in the course of the narration we travel throughout our world system in times past, present, and future, as well as other world systems presided over by their respective awakened beings. Beginning in the voice of a general narrator who returns to describe supernatural events from a bird’s-eye view—earthquakes, cascading flowers, flashes of light, and the like—the text for the most part unfolds as a discussion, and thus emerges from the mouths of a cast of characters with whom we are gradually acquainted. Some of these characters are familiar: the Buddha, of course, and bodhisattvas like Mañjuśrī and Nārāya aṇ, as well as the śrāvakas Maudgalyāyana and Ānanda, who make brief guest appearances in what is largely a Great Vehicle ensemble.The central plot surrounds the conversion and awakening of a newcomer, a “strongman” named Vimalatejā. The sūtra’s structure is framed loosely around an instruction by the Buddha that successfully converts Vimalatejā, and this instruction is the basis for the sūtra’s name.I.2The text commences in a typical way, with the description of a setting in India—a mansion in Āmrapālī’s grove in the area of Vaiśālī, where the Buddha is residing with his entourage of countless human and nonhuman beings. The Buddha gives a teaching that is not spelled out in the text, but which apparently is impressive enough to prompt Nārāya a to rise up and praise its orator. Nārāya a, who will ṇṇserve as the major interlocutor for the remainder of the text, then exhorts the Buddha to expound further; first he presents a series of supplications to the Buddha, and subsequently a series of questions.I.3The supplications are noteworthy in that aside from purely soteriologically orientedprayers, they also include prayers for the preservation and sustained high reputation of the Buddhist community, indicating concerns from within the tradition about the place of Buddhists within society. The twenty-three questions that follow effectively span the entirety of what is involved in bodhisattva praxis. Asa response to Nārāya a’s extensive list of questions, the Buddha hints at a teaching ṇthat would constitute a complete answer to each and every one of Nārāya a’s ṇinquiries, and this teaching provides the sūtra’s name. Although the Buddha says nothing more about the teaching at this point, the exchange grounds the text thematically in the topic of merit, suggesting as it does that the entire bodhisattva"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"spiritual path stands and falls with it.I.4The setting of the narrative then changes from Āmrapālī’s grove to a nearby place inthe town of Vaiśālī, where the sūtra’s chief protagonist, Vimalatejā, is dwelling. Through the omnipresent narrator, we zoom in on this strongman as he is indulging in a bout of self-aggrandizement concerning his stature as a strong and powerful human being. He almost comes to the conclusion that there could be no one mightier than him in the world, before he remembers having heard of a special person named Gautama. Gautama is of course said to possess the ten strengths of an awakened being, which, if true, would certainly eclipse the merely physical and worldly might that Vimalatejā possesses. So he resolves to visit the Buddha to clear away his doubts. This sets up another major theme of the text, a playful inquiry intowhat it really means to be “strong.”I.5On this note, the story segues back to the Buddha’s encampment in Āmrapālī’s grove, where Vimalatejā arrives with his nose in the air. Noticing Vimalatejā’s presence and haughty attitude, the Buddha ventures into a lengthy, rather pertinentdialogue on the topic of power; although this discussion is carried out withMaudgalyāyana, it is directed entirely at Vimalatejā. The discussion consists of a set of progressively more astounding comparative descriptions that reveal the inimitable quality of the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ power which, as we—and Vimalatejā—come to see, is literally unrivalled in the world. Humbled and inspired to expand the scope of his own strength, which he had previously thought to be matchless, Vimalatejā then takes refuge in the Three Jewels and forms the resolve of a bodhisattva.I.6This leads us back to where the previous scene left off, before it was interrupted by the arrival of the self-inflated visitor. Nārāya aṇ, the interlocutor, returns to the questions he had asked the Buddha, and reminds him that he had not yet explainedexactly what was referred to by the term the absorption that encapsulates all merit.The Buddha graciously bestows a reply, at which point we discover that the term refers to nothing other than the mind of awakening (bodhicitta).I.7The Buddha’s explanation then takes the form of four “introductions” to the topic athand. These consist of another set of characteristically mind-boggling, evocative comparisons that build up to the conclusion that nothing—even within the powers of the gods Śakra and Brahma—could truly be more meritorious than engendering the mind of awakening. This effectively makes a link in very simple terms (it is fair to say that this sūtra is addressed to, and comprehended by, nonspecialists)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"between power, merit, and the bodhisattva endeavor. After a series of miracles, at which a huge portion of the audience forms the resolve set on awakening, an apparent first chapter comes to a close—apparent because, although all Kangyurs contain at this point the mention of a first chapter being concluded, some catalogues state that this may be an error of transcription with no thematic significance, corresponding as it does with a change of fascicles. No mention is made of subsequent chapters, as would usually be the case.1I.8Chapter 2, or the second fascicle, begins with a long dialogue between the Buddha and Vimalatejā, in which the Buddha sets out to elaborate further on the principle of merit and how it is accumulated. This discussion centers around three practices identified by the Buddha as being ideal for the accumulation of merit: generosity, discipline, and learning. These provide a systematic framework for the expression of numerous Buddhist ethical and soteriological principles, and thus this passage could be said to be the weightiest in terms of religious doctrine.I.9Although the ideas within this passage are presented in fairly straightforward termsand largely in the form of mnemonic lists, they also extend beyond mere ethical behavior and delve into the Great Vehicle notion of insight (prajñā) into the empty nature of things. Bodhisattvas are exhorted, for instance, to become free of dualism,and such a nonconceptual mind-state will allow them to practice generosity with their own bodies. This is compared, in an evocative simile, to the way a tree allows its parts to be taken for various uses. This emphasis on insight will later be reinforced by the Buddha’s categorical statement that learning is the most crucial ofthe three endeavors.I.10Prior to this, however, the section on the accumulation of learning in chapter 2 is noteworthy in that it provides another layer in both the plotline and thematic content of the sūtra. This occurs when the Buddha recounts a story from his past life as Great Supreme Sage, who sacrificed his own body in order to receive spiritualinstruction. The recitation of this selfless action is potent enough to summonImmaculately Renowned King, a buddha from an entirely different world system, who proceeds to expound, coincidentally, on the teaching known as the absorption that encapsulates all merit. Thus is introduced another major theme of the text, namely the importance of undergoing hardship for the sake of the Dharma.I.11The remainder of Buddha Immaculately Renowned King’s sermon is made up of another short set of mnemonic lists. After recounting these, the Buddha then articulates the moral of the story regarding the importance of fortitude in pursuing the Dharma, while also making an interesting comment about the presence of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"“Dharma treasures” hidden in various “mountains, mountain caverns, and trees,” which are awaiting revelation.I.12The Buddha then concludes the general discussion on the three practices, identifying learning as the most crucial practice. The conversation betweenVimalatejā and the Buddha, which is now firmly grounded in the topic of insight and its pursuit, then turns to the notion of “acceptance that phenomena are unborn” (anutpattikadharmak āntiṣ) and what leads to it. This could be said to be the buildup to the major turning point in the sūtra’s storyline: at the conclusion of the discussion, Vimalatejā has an epiphany that leads him to levitate high up in the air, which in turn induces the Buddha to display a cosmic smile that illuminates theuniverse. Afterward the Buddha, prompted by Ānanda, relates the key moments in Vimalatejā’s past lives that brought him to where he is now, and furthermore prophesies Vimalatejā’s future awakening.I.13The arc of the story then segues again as Vimalatejā makes his debut as a teacher in response to a series of questions by Nārāya aṇ. In his answers, Vimalatejā demonstrates a remarkable, sudden penetration of profound Buddhist ideas, carrying the course of the discussion into the nature of nonduality and the imminence of awakened qualities within all beings. He is even led by Nārāya a to ṇcomment on several challenging statements from other sūtras, such as the line, “Rely on the true meaning; do not rely on the words.” Vimalatejā answers these questions with ease and is commended by the Buddha. A conversation between Nārāya a and Mañjuśrī now follows, in which the latter expounds on similar ṇthemes.I.14The final section shifts into a loose, communal atmosphere of shared insights, as various characters, including several new ones, chime in whenever they are inspiredto make comments. First a god named Free of Demons delivers an oration that is notable for its exhortation that bodhisattvas should engage in seemingly unethical practices as part of their spiritual endeavor—even “demonic” ones—if they can do so without being polluted by them. This sets the stage for a long string of abstract and often paradoxical statements regarding bodhisattva practice that come in turn from the mouths of the Buddha, Mañjuśrī, and others. Mañjuśrī later makes a comment on the irrelevance of monasticism to the bodhisattva endeavor, reiterating that true insight should be regarded as the decisive factor as to whether or not a bodhisattva is considered a “renunciant.” This would seem to suggest that the sūtra’s expected audience may indeed have consisted of—or at least included—laypeople. It also suggests that the sūtra emerged from a milieu in which lay spirituality was encouraged and considered respectable. Finally the text concludes with an explanation by the Buddha on the way in which merit creates what are"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"known as themarks of one hundred merits, as well as his announcement that his life will soon end.I.15In this way, The Absorption That Encapsulates All Merit presents a relatively simplified sampling of the rich philosophy and atmosphere of Great Vehicle Buddhism, while at the same time constituting a literary work that functions on several levels. On the narrative level, it is the story of a seemingly uneducated outsider named Vimalatejā, who has a spiritual awakening and then impresses the Buddhist establishment. On another level, it is a commentary on the nature of human power and merit, which we progressively come to see are rooted in insight. It also displays evidence from within the Buddhist tradition that its adherents were concerned about the preservation and positive reputation of their cultural institution. All of this unfolds in Āmrapālī’s grove near Vaiśālī where the Buddha timelessly dwells, and the Great Vehicle teachings emerge in constant revelation.I.16The Absorption That Encapsulates All Merit is extant in Tibetan and in two Chinese translations, but no Sanskrit version is known to have survived. The Tibetan version was translated from Sanskrit by Prajñāvarman, Śīlendrabodhi, Yeshé Dé, “and others,” in the late eighth or early ninth centuries. Although it is notone of the best known sūtras, it is quoted in at least two Indian treatises in the Tengyur, and citations of several different passages appear in a number of Tibetan commentaries.THE TRANSLATIONThe Noble Great Vehicle SūtraThe Absorption That Encapsulates All MeritChapter 1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1.1Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!1.2Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Vaiśālī in the mansion in Āmra pālī’s great grove, together with a great assembly of ten thousand monks. All these monks were foe-destroyers whose defilements were exhausted. They were without afflictions and controlled. Their minds were perfectly free, their insight perfectly liberated. They were noble beings, great elephants, successful and accomplished. They had laid down their burden and fulfilled their aims. They had eliminated the bondages of existence and, thanks to their correct knowledge, their minds were perfectly liberated. They had obtained supreme perfection in masteringall mental states.1.3There were also twenty thousand bodhisattvas, all of whom were nonreturners. These bodhisattvas had accomplished retention and were unhindered in their eloquence. They had attained the superknowledges and were adept in the practice of absorption. They had perfect mastery, moreover, in mindfulness, intelligence, realization, steadfastness, insight, and method. Foremost among these twenty thousand were the bodhisattva great being Caryamati, the bodhisattva great beingSi hamati ṃ, the bodhisattva great being Uttaramati, the bodhisattva great beingViśe amatiṣ, the bodhisattva great being Vardamānamati, [F.71.a] the bodhisattva great being Anantamati, the bodhisattva great being Dharmamati, the bodhisattva great being Maitreya, the bodhisattva great being Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, and the bodhisattva great being Nārāya aṇ. Together with them were forty thousand gods, all of whom were thoroughly immersed in the Great Vehicle, as well as Śakra, Brahmā, and many world protectors. Surrounded and revered by this retinue of many hundreds of thousands, the Blessed One taughtthe Dharma. On this occasion, the Blessed One’s teaching was particularly pithy and overwhelmed the masses of non-Buddhists.1.4Afterward the bodhisattva great being Nārāya a rose up from his seat, draped his ṇshawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One and supplicated him as follows.“Blessed One, this teaching of yours is exceedingly pithy. It is exquisite indeed, and overwhelms everyone, including misguided non-Buddhists, the countlesswanderingmendicants, and the naked ascetics. Accordingly, Blessed One, please take the bodhisattva great beings under your care, please give your aid to the bodhisattva great beings, and please keep the bodhisattva great beings in your protection."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Chapter 22.1Then the mighty strongman Vimalatejā inquired of the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what are the instructions for attaining this absorption that encapsulates all merit?”The Blessed One replied to the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family, there is one single instruction for attaining this absorption that encapsulates all merit. What is it? It is to not forsake the omniscient mind. Son of noble family, through this instruction alone will one attain the absorption that encapsulates all merit.2.2“Son of noble family, there could also be said to be two instructions for attaining theabsorption that encapsulates all merit.

Those bodhisattvagreat beings who seek to increase their merit will listen to this absorption that encapsulates all merit. Those bodhisattva great beings who seek to attain an inconceivable amount of merit will listen and devote themselves to this absorption that encapsulates all merit. Those bodhisattva great beings who seek to attain inexhaustible merit will exert themselves in this absorption. Those bodhisattva great beings who seek to attain an ocean of merit will take up this absorption; they will uphold it, read it, and explain it. Those bodhisattva great beings who seek to acquire the ‘marks of one hundred merits’ will exert themselves in the practice of meditating on this absorption.”2.12The mighty strongman Vimalatejā then continued his questions to the Blessed One:“Blessed One, how is it that a bodhisattva great being should endeavor in order to perfect such qualities as these—inexhaustible merit, ocean-like merit, inconceivablemerit, the accumulation of merit, and the marks of one hundred merits?”The Blessed One answered the strongman Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family, there are three things that constitute the foundation of merit, the accumulation of merit, [F.83.b] the gathering of merit, the expansion of merit, the inexhaustibility of merit, inconceivable merit, and ocean-like merit. What are these three? They are the accumulations of generosity, discipline, and learning.2.13“Son of noble family, how should bodhisattva great beings endeavor in accumulating generosity, you ask? Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should not accept anything unless they can imagine giving it away and have an attitude of generosity toward it. They should not keep any possession unless they are willing to give it away. They should not keep any attendants or any retinue that creates a feeling of attachment when others ask for it. Bodhisattvas should not accept a kingdom that they would be unable to give away when others ask for it. They should not accept any such things, whether enjoyments, wealth, material objects, or precious items, whatever they may be.2.14"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should think in this way: ‘I will give this very body of mine away to all beings, and if I can give this away, what need to mention external, material things?’ And also: ‘If there is anyone who could make use of anything I have, I will give that thing to that being, without any resentment or regret. I will give my arms to those who want arms, my legs to those who want legs, and my eyes to those who want eyes. I will give away my flesh to those who want flesh, my blood to those who want blood, my marrow to those who want marrow, all parts of my body to those who want them, and even my head to those who want a head. Of course the same thing goes for physical possessions such as my wealth, [F.84.a] grain, gold, silver, gems, jewelry, horses, elephants, chariots, riding mounts, villages, cities, towns, countries, kingdoms, palaces, marketplaces, mountain hamlets, male and female servants, employees, sons, daughters, wives, or retinue.’2.15“‘Furthermore, if there is anyone whose aims could be met with anything that I mayhave, I will give it to that being; I will give it away without any sense of resentment or regret, nor any hope for reward. I will do so no matter what. Beyond this, I will do nothing but help beings, be compassionate and loving to them, and work to bring them together. May I reach awakening, and then do everything so that these beings realize all dharmas.’ Son of noble family, any bodhisattva who arouses such an attitude is truly a bodhisattva.2.16“In addition, son of noble family, bodhisattvas have no concern for life or limb. Even at the cost of their lives, they will not become involved with any negative actions. They will not sustain themselves through any sort of wicked sustenance in order to nourish their physical bodies. They will not become angry with anyone, even at the cost of their lives. They will not become involved in anything unwholesome for the sake of valuables. They will not instigate fights and quarrels for the sake of attendants and retinue. They will not deceive others for the sake of their wives, sons, or daughters. They will not develop a covetous or greedy attitude toward others’ valuables. Since they have few desires, they do not give rise to even one moment of an unwholesome mind-state, let alone many moments.2.17“Endeavoring in this way, they leave behind intense desire and attachment. Leavingbehind intense desire and attachment, they stop pursuing ambitions. [F.84.b] When they do not pursue ambitions, they strive in what is genuine. Striving in whatis genuine, they attain genuine progress. Once they make genuine progress, they will remain in genuine practice. When they abide in the genuine, they will please the genuine spiritual guides, so that they can follow, keep company with, and serve them. Following, keeping company with, and serving the spiritual guides in this way, they learn from them the teachings of genuine certainty. Learning these"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"teachings, moreover, they will put them into practice. Then, having entered into thegenuine Dharma, they can help all beings who are immersed in mistaken practices. Endeavoring to help beings, they will no longer fall into mistakenness. Once they are immersed in what is right, they will become expert in beings’ various superior and inferior capacities, and correct and incorrect ways of understanding. Son of noble family, in this way, bodhisattvas who engage in the accumulation of generosity will attain extraordinary qualities of this kind.2.18“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should perceive inner and outer phenomena as one, and not perceive them dualistically. There is no duality between what constitutes the element of earth internally and what constitutes the earth element externally; it should not be dualized. How so, you mayask? This body is like grass, a tree, a wall, or the scenery along a road: it is inactive, actionless, inanimate, insubstantial, and composed of elements. If someone were tocut it, chop it, or strike it with a cudgel, sword, stick, or lump of dirt, one should notgive rise to the idea, ‘I am experiencing this.’ One should not be concerned about one’s body, nor attached to one’s life. Moreover, not only should one keep the resolve not to have harsh or angry feelings toward such beings, [F.85.a] one should have an attitude of loving kindness for them as well.2.19“Son of noble family, take the analogy of a medicinal tree. Say a part of its roots are taken, or its trunk, or branches, or bark, or leaves, or flowers, or fruits, or core. It does not have such thoughts as, ‘You can take from my roots but not my trunk,’ or ‘You can take from my trunk but not my roots,’ or ‘You can take from my branches but not my leaves,’ or ‘You can take from my leaves but not my branches.’ Nor does it think, ‘You can take from my twigs, flowers, fruits, bark, and core, but not from what is not my core,’ or ‘You can take from what is not my core, but not from my core.’ Indeed the medicinal tree forms no such thoughts whatsoever.2.20“Nonetheless, while being free of concepts, the medicinal tree heals people from grave, medium, or lesser maladies. In the same way, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should see their bodies, made of the four major elements, as being like medicinal trees: whatever any being needs, they should let them take it. They let those in need of arms take their arms, those in need of legs take their legs, those in need of eyes take their eyes, those in need of meat take their flesh, those in need of blood take their blood, those in need of bones take their bones, those in need of marrow take their marrow, those in need of a head take their head, or those in need of all their limbs and organs take them all.2.21“Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings who think in this way, with such an"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"accumulation of generosity, emerge definitively through their inexhaustible merit. When these bodhisattva great beings give something, they dedicate the act entirely so that miserly beings may develop consummate generosity. They dedicate it entirely so that destitute beings may achieve great prosperity. [F.85.b] When they give away all their limbs and organs, they dedicate the merit so that all beings might possess all their limbs and organs intact.2.22“There are, nonetheless, three things to which they will never dedicate an act of generosity. What are these three? They will never dedicate it toward attaining the gratification of desire, political gain, wealth, or power. They will never dedicate it sothat they themselves may acquire merit. They will never dedicate it in order to attain the state of a śrāvaka or a solitary buddha.2.23“When they practice generosity, they dedicate the act of giving toward perfecting four types of purification. What are these four types of purification to be perfected? They dedicate their generosity toward the purification of the buddhafields. They dedicate it to the purification of the community of bodhisattvas. They dedicate it toward bringing all beings to maturity. They dedicate it toward purifying omniscient wisdom. That is how bodhisattva great beings dedicate their generosity toward the perfection of four types of purification.2.24“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings stabilize their generosity and do not let it become exhausted. How might the bodhisattvas’ generosity become exhausted, you ask? Son of noble family, the generosity of bodhisattvas will become exhausted if it is associated with four traits. What are these four? Not dedicating; lacking skill in method; aiming for lower rebirths; and associating with negative companions. Son of noble family, the generosity of bodhisattvas will become exhausted if it is associated with these four traits.2.25“On the other hand, son of noble family, [F.86.a] if the generosity of bodhisattva great beings is associated with four other traits, it will be stabilized and not become exhausted. What are these four? To fully dedicate the act toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening; to be skilled in method; to strive for spiritual dominion; and to follow a spiritual guide. Son of noble family, the generosity of bodhisattva great beings will be stabilized and not become exhausted if it is associated with these four traits.2.26“Moreover, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings practice generosity while actualizing four things. What are these four? Not to give up the mind of awakening;"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"to be loving to beings; not to go against the word of the thus-gone ones; and not to hope for a reward from the ripening of one’s spiritual or material generosity. Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity while actualizing these four things.2.27“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity to establish beings in three things. What are these three? To establish all beings in awakening; to establish them in the Dharma teachings; and to establish all beings in unsurpassed happiness. Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity to establish beings in these three things.2.28“In addition, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in pursuit of two things. What are these two? Great prosperity and a generous attitude. Bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in pursuit of these two things.“Moreover, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity to abandon two things. What are these two? Attachment [F.86b] and stinginess. Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity to abandonthese two things.2.29“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in order to perfect two things. What are these two? Insight and wisdom. Son of noble family, in order to perfect these two things should bodhisattva great beings practice generosity.“Moreover, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should practice generosity in order to attain two things. What are these two? Knowledge of extinction, and knowledge of nonarising. Son of noble family, in order to attain these two things should bodhisattvas practice generosity.2.30“In addition, son of noble family, any act of generosity carried out by a bodhisattva may be of four kinds. What four? Generosity with an impartial attitude; generosity without expecting reward in the form of ripening; generosity dedicated to awakening; and generosity that perfects gentleness, calmness, and tranquility. Son of noble family, these four ways of giving constitute the bodhisattva great beings’ ways of generosity.“Therefore, son of noble family, a bodhisattva who wishes to manifest inexhaustible"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"merit should endeavor in these sorts of accumulations of generosity.”2.31The mighty strongman Vimalatejā then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the way the Thus-Gone One has expounded on the accumulation of generosity so that others can apprehend all buddhadharmas is truly marvelous. Blessed One, those bodhisattva great beings who possess such an accumulation of generosity as this will not diminish in merit, will not diminish in wisdom, [F.87.a] nor will they diminish in insight.”2.32The Blessed One replied, “Indeed, son of noble family. It is just as you have said. Those bodhisattva great beings who possess such an accumulation of generosity as this manifest inexhaustible and ocean-like merit. Since they possess noble qualities,they will not fall destitute. Since they possess the lineage of Dharma, they will also be prosperous. Since they possess the seven riches, they will also be wealthy. Since they have the marks of one hundred merits, they possess great merit as well. Since they nurture all beings, they are also a field of merit.”2.33The Blessed One then continued to address the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family, what is the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of discipline, you ask? It is not to let discipline deteriorate and not to give up the training. It is to have compassion for those with faulty discipline, and sincere respect for those who are disciplined. It is to carry out and follow the path of the ten virtuous deeds correctly—with purity in regard to the three physical disciplines, with purity in regard to the four verbal disciplines, and with purity in regard to the three mental disciplines—aswell as leading others to this path and establishing others in it.2.34“It is not to praise oneself; not to belittle others; to embody the various types of discipline; not to be conceited about one’s discipline; not to lose one’s endeavor; not to stray from the qualities of an ascetic or from having few possessions; to preserve the lineage of the noble ones; to guard one’s mind; not to find fault in others’ confusion; not to do anything negative; to feel aversion for the unfolding of existence; to lead others into the roots of virtue; [F.87.b] to rejoice in others’ deeds; not to have the character of a pleasure-seeker; not to abandon life in solitude; to assist those who are unwell and be pleased and joyous to do so; to follow one’s words with actions; to be tolerant of those who are disrespectful; and not to becomefull of oneself when people are respectful, nor arrogant or discouraged when meeting with gain or loss, fame or disrepute, praise or slander, pleasure or pain.2.35"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"“It is to give up attachment and anger; not to hold grudges; to stay loving at all times without ever stopping; to keep an impartial attitude toward both friends and enemies; not to cling to the component of discipline as supreme; not to dedicate one’s merit toward other vehicles; not to pay homage to other gods; to be free of any type of view; to quell both latent and manifest afflictions; to give up regret; to be free of remorse; to delight in giving everything away; to be free from attachment to any mode of birth; to take rebirth in existence intentionally; to be tolerant of the unpleasant; to apply diligence; to take hold of the mind; to be undistracted from theobject of one’s observation; to be accepting of and not intimidated by the unborn nature of phenomena. Son of noble family, such is the bodhisattvas’ accumulation of discipline.2.36“With this accumulation of discipline as a foundation, they do not lapse in their training, even if it costs them their lives. They do not maintain discipline for the sake of gaining political authority. They do not maintain discipline to reach the higher realms, the state of Śakra, or the state of Brahmā; not for wealth, not for power, not for caste, not for fame, not for renown, acclaim, or to be eulogized; [F.88.a] not to gain anything, not to garner respect, not to prolong their lives, not for clothing, not for food, not for bedding or cushions, not to be cured of an ailment, and not for medicines.

They maintain discipline out of the wish for miraculous powers, and out of the wish for magical powers. This type of discipline is unimpaired, undamaged, uncorrupted, undistorted, stable, self-reliant,perfected, well considered, unsullied, unblemished, immaculate, fragrant, extolled by the wise, praised by all buddhas, free of defect, and constitutes the essential spiritual practice in accord with the Dharma.2.40“In possession of this component of discipline, there are ten things from which theywill not fall away. What are those ten things? They will not fall away from the dominion of the wheel-bearing monarch, while at the same time conscientiously striving for awakening. They will not fall away from the state of Śakra, while at the same time conscientiously striving for awakening, and wishing only to behold the buddhas. They will not fall away from the state of Brahmā, while still conscientiously striving for awakening. They will not fall away from beholding the Buddha, as they have attained faith based on understanding. [F.89.a] They will not fall away from hearing the Dharma, as they put the teachings into practice assiduously just as they have learned them. They will not fall away from understanding of the bodhisattva vow. They will not fall away from unabated confidence, as they seek to understand everything with regard to the roots of virtue.They will not fall away from concentration. They will not fall away from being extolled by all the buddhas, solitary buddhas, śrāvakas, and bodhisattvas. They will not fall away from attaining swift superknowledge and perfecting the wisdom of omniscience. Bodhisattva great beings who possess this component of discipline will not fall away from these ten things.2.41“Bodhisattva great beings who are established in the component of discipline in thisway are forever revered by the gods, always extolled by nāgas, perpetually honored by yak as, always worshipped by gandharvas, and constantly venerated by the lord ṣof nāgas and by demigods. They are always respected by the ruling caste, priests, merchants, and householders. The wise always hasten to their presence. The buddhas always keep them in mind.

They will not migrate to states of birth in families that have wrong views. [F.89.b] They will not migrate to any of the lower states. It is thus that bodhisattva great beings who genuinely and properly uphold the component of discipline will not migrate to these four states.2.43“Moreover, bodhisattva great beings who genuinely uphold the component of discipline in this way will not deviate from four things. What are those four things? They will not deviate whatsoever from the mind of complete awakening. They will not deviate from recollecting the Buddha. They will not deviate whatsoever from the Dharma, which they have learned and mastered. They will not deviate whatsoever from remembering the incalculable eons. In this way, bodhisattva great beings who genuinely uphold the component of discipline will not deviate from these four things.2.44“Furthermore, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings who genuinely uphold the component of discipline in this way will not end up in four dangers. What four dangers? They will not end up in danger related to the sacred Dharma. They will not end up in the intermediate eon of weapons. They will not end up in the intermediate eon of famine. They will not end up in the intermediate eon of disease.In this way, son of noble family, the bodhisattva great beings who genuinely upholdthe component of discipline will not end up in these four dangers.2.45“In addition, son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings who abide by the component of discipline in this way will attain four exalted states.

The qualities of awakening and buddhahood have their basis in the component of discipline. Whoever has discipline also has absorption. Whoever has discipline also has insight. Whoever has discipline also has liberation. Whoever has discipline also has perceived the wisdom of liberation.2.48“Son of noble family, [F.90.b] what is the discipline that pacifies the afflictions? And why are the afflictions so called? Because of the way they afflict, and since they afflict beings in the three realms in this way, they are called afflictions. What, then, constitutes their pacification? When there is no thinking, no conceptualization, no imputation, no movement, no arising, no ideation, no mental involvement—this is the pacification of the afflictions.2.49“Son of noble family, those bodhisattva great beings who do not know how to pacifythe afflictions do not have a component of discipline that is utterly pure. Why is that? Because they might be able to end up in the realm of Brahmā, but still will be left with afflictions. They might be able to end up at the summit of existence, but they still will be left with afflictions. Therefore, son of noble family, you should understand through these descriptions that, in this way, anyone who is without the afflictions of the three realms also has a pure component of discipline.”2.50Then the mighty strongman Vimalatejā inquired of the Blessed One, “Blessed One, if it is indeed the case that one who lacks the afflictions of the three realms has a pure component of discipline, then, Blessed One, how is it that a bodhisattva who isfree of afflictions aspires to the three realms?”2.51The Blessed One answered the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"bodhisattva great beings do not aspire to the three realms in order to become afflicted. Son of noble family, certain beings who are not truly afflicted in their nature will nevertheless undergo the process of affliction in the three realms in order to bring beings to maturity; this is the bodhisattvas’ method. It is like this, son of noble family: [F.91.a] imagine someone trying to paint an array of vivid images in the air. What do you think, son of noble family, would it involve some difficulty for that person to do so?”2.52Vimalatejā replied, “Indeed it would, Blessed One. Indeed it would, Bliss-Gone One. Such a person would indeed have difficulty in doing that.”2.53The Blessed One continued, “Son of noble family, certain bodhisattvas who are not truly afflicted in their nature will nevertheless undergo the process of affliction in the three realms in order to bring beings to maturity. While they bring those beings to maturity, they teach the three vehicles. This involves far more difficulty.”2.54Vimalatejā replied, “Blessed One, those bodhisattva great beings who have perceived the gate of liberation, yet out of their love for beings remain in the three realms, must indeed have great compassion. It is analogous, Blessed One, to a person who first escapes his own threatened execution and then returns to the place where execution was threatened, telling the executioners, ‘Don’t kill anyone else! Kill me instead!’ Blessed One, in this analogy the place where execution was threatened represents the three realms. Being executed represents remaining in theworld.2 The threatening executioners represent the formations. Being rid of the threat of execution represents the bodhisattva great beings being free from the three realms, while in fact, in order to bring all beings to maturity and in order to liberate all beings, they continue to do nothing but roam in those three realms.2.55“Blessed One, by engendering a mindset of great compassion, bodhisattva great beings outshine all the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas. On what account? Blessed One, on account of the fact that the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas do not have such great compassion, nor such expertise in methods.” [F.91.b]2.56The Blessed One now said to the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family, how should bodhisattva great beings exert themselves in the accumulation of learning? And how should they strive in learning? Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings should humble their pride before their preceptors and instructors, and compliantly engender a mindset of revering, respecting, admiring,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and cherishing the teacher. In this way, they should regard the teachings as medicine. They should regard their preceptors and instructors as consultants. They should regard themselves as sick people. They should regard the one who bestows the Dharma instructions as a doctor. They should regard all beings as being ill.2.57“In pursuit of the Buddha’s teachings, they should have no concern for their physical well-being, nor should they have any special attachment to their lives. They should regard various possessions as utter encumbrances. They should not develop attachment for being wealthy. They should focus on the Dharma and give up all valuables. They should forsake all worldly people in order to apprehend the sacred teachings and their meaning. Seeking only spiritual achievement, they should forsake gain, respect, and eulogy. Seeking only spiritual dominion, they should forsake political authority. They should seek to give up all afflictions and exert themselves in pursuing the sacred Dharma. Bodhisattva great beings who uphold the sacred Dharma gain possession of all roots of virtue. Therefore, son of noble family, those who seek awakening, who wish to awaken fully to completely perfect buddhahood, [F.92.a] and who wish to erect the pillars of insight, should exert themselves in learning.2.58“Son of noble family, it is like this. Consider the way that due to the pillars that support the Palace of Victory, the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-three have a gathering place. In the same way, son of noble family, the pillars of insight are upheld through the strength of learning, making a gathering place for the whole world, including bodhisattva great beings and gods. Son of noble family, bodhisattvas who form the resolve set on awakening vow to be a bodhisattva, saying, ‘May I become a buddha.’ However, unless they exert themselves in pursuit of learning, they will be participating in the distortion of all beings’ insight.2.59“Son of noble family, when a bodhisattva great being endeavors to exert himself in the pursuit of learning, it becomes a support for all beings to perfect their insight. On these occasions, even the gods delight and rejoice in it, proclaiming, ‘Ah! This sublime being—with his mind purified through learning, diligence, and insight—will be able to achieve the ten powers! Ah! This sublime being will be able to cut entirely through the whole incessant web of affliction with the sword of insight. Ah! This sublime being will be able to teach the Dharma so that all beings may be rid of their afflictions. Ah! This sublime being will be able to dwell at the seat of awakening, where the victorious ones of the past resided. Ah! This sublime being will be able to vanquish the hordes of demons, and even their mounts. Ah! This bodhisattva will be able to turn the Dharma wheel with its twelve aspects!’2.60"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"“Son of noble family, when a bodhisattva exerts himself in learning the Dharma, then, son of noble family, the abodes of the demons fall into gloom. At the same time, all the evil demons and deities of the demonic legions throughout the great trichiliocosm [F.92.b] experience pain and despondency, thinking, ‘This being is not in our control. We have no power over him. He will totally destroy us. He has control over us.’2.61Why is this? Because with such learning, son of noble family, one develops insight. With insight, the afflictions are pacified. Without afflictions, demons have no ingress. With learning comes understanding. With understanding, one pursues the Dharma in the correct way. When one exerts oneself in genuine pursuit of the Dharma, evil demons will have no ingress. With learning, one is freed of wrong views and engenders the genuine view. When one is immersed in what is genuine, demons have no ingress. Immersed in what is genuine, one comes to understand the meaning and becomes invulnerable. Seeking the true, one genuinely pursues that truth.2.62“Son of noble family, you should understand from these descriptions how bodhisattva great beings, who exert themselves in extensive learning, become able to vanquish the four demons. What are the four demons? The demon of the aggregates, the demon of the afflictions, the demon of the lord of death, and the demon of the god—these are the four demons will they be able to vanquish.2.63“Moreover, son of noble family, let me relate to you just a little of the way bodhisattvas of the past, who strove for and pursued the Dharma, endeavored in learning. Son of noble family, once, an immeasurably and inconceivably long time ago—immeasurably further back than an incalculable eon—there lived a great sage by the name Supreme One. He was an eminent sage who dwelt in the forests, woods, and mountains, possessed the five superknowledges, and lived his life totally out of love and compassion. [F.93.a]2.64“One day, as he was staying in the woods, he began to ponder, ‘The fact that I live my life by love does not seem to make anyone happy. It seems love cannot pacify the attachment, anger, or delusion of beings, nor any of the afflictions they have accrued over the course of infinite eons. Love does not seem to lead to the genuine view of the noble ones.’ He then continued to wonder, ‘So where does the genuine view of the noble ones come from?’ And then the idea came to him: ‘There seem to be two causes, two conditions that lead to the genuine view of the noble ones. What are those two factors? Others’ words, and one’s own correct mental engagement."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"These must be the two causes, the two conditions that lead to the genuine view of the noble ones.’ He then resolved to exert himself in quest of the Dharma, with the thought, ‘Now, where will I find the sublime teachings?’2.65“His ardent spiritual quest for the Dharma led him throughout many villages, cities,towns, countries, kingdoms, and palaces. Despite his efforts, he could not find anyone preaching the Dharma. Then there appeared before him a god from the demonic legions. Advancing directly in front of the sage, the god announced, ‘I havein my possession a verse about the names of the Buddha, which was spoken by one buddha among the blessed buddhas.’“‘ Then speak it,’ the sage answered.“The god replied, ‘For that you will have to peel off your own skin and dry it in the sun to make paper out of it. Then create an ink formed from your blood, and a pen from one of your bones. If you can do that, you may request from me this verse spoken by the Buddha, and I will bestow it on you.’2.66“Son of noble family, then the great sage Supreme One thought to himself, ‘Since time immemorial in cyclic existence, [F.93.b] for hundreds of thousands of eons, this body of mine has committed faults one rebirth after the next, taking all kinds ofbirth. And how many hundreds of thousands of hardships have I had to endure—at the hands of enemies and murderers, or by thieves and royal henchmen, having all my body parts sliced and chopped into many pieces with sharp knives, and having been slashed, bound, beaten, and menaced, all for the sake of desire or greed. And through all this, all of these bodies and all of these experiences I have undergone have done nothing to benefit even a single being. Now that with this worthless bodyI may acquire the Dharma—what a wonderful opportunity I have!’2.67“Delighted and full of joy, he engendered the perception of that god as his instructor, and with a sharp knife skinned his own body and dried it in the sun to make paper. He drew blood from his own body and used it to concoct ink. Finally he fashioned a pen from one of his bones, and then with his palms together addressed the god: ‘Divine being, please tell me the verse spoken by the Buddha that summarizes the names of the Buddha. I have done whatever you commanded. I have skinned my own body and dried it to make paper. I have concocted ink from my own blood. I have fashioned a pen from my own bones.’“At that moment, son of noble family, faced with the great sage Supreme One’s devotion and eagerness, that god of the demonic legions became ashamed and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"vanished on the spot.2.68“Son of noble family, witnessing the god vanish at that moment, the great sage Supreme One thought to himself, ‘Although I have not been able to hear that verse, it was to be able to hear it that, out of devotion to the Dharma, I peeled the skin from my own body, dried it to make paper, concocted ink from my own blood, and pulled out one of my own bones to make a pen. The root of virtue garnered through such an act of devotion to the Dharma will not be wasted; it will not fail. [F.94.a] I did not succeed, but out of altruism and without hypocrisy, I engendered compassion for beings and made paper of my own skin, ink from my blood, and a pen from my bone without concern for life and limb. Thus, through whatever truth and honest words may be in my devotion to the Dharma, through such truth and honest words, may all the great beings who teach and expound on the Dharma, whether in this world or another, please reveal themselves to me, and allow me to hear the Dharma!’2.69“Son of noble family, as soon as the great sage Supreme One had said this, at that very moment, at that very instant, at that very second, his words were known in a world system thirty-two buddhafields below this one known as Totally Immaculate.There dwelt the Thus-Gone One, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect BuddhaImmaculately Renowned King. He lived there, flourished there, and taught the Dharma. Knowing the great sage Supreme One’s pure intentions and perceiving, too, the maturity of the beings in this world, the Thus-Gone One Immaculately Renowned King immediately vanished from that realm along with five hundred bodhisattvas.2.70“At that very moment, in that very instant, in that very second, as quickly as a strong person can stretch out his arm and draw it in, they appeared before the greatsage Supreme One. As soon as the Blessed One, thus-gone one, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect Buddha Immaculately Renowned King appeared there, the woods were instantaneously filled with an immense glow, and a rain of flowers fell. At the same time, the sound of Dharma teachings rang out from all the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits in the forest. [F.94.b] At the same time, many trillions of gods assembled.2.71“As soon as the glow from the Blessed One, the thus-gone one Immaculately Renowned King struck the great sage Supreme One, his wounds and gashes disappeared, and his body and complexion were restored to their normal state. Then the great sage Supreme One bowed his head to the feet of the Blessed One, thethus-gone one, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect Buddha known as"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Immaculately Renowned King. He circumambulated the Blessed One three times and then, putting his palms together above his head, all ten fingers touching each other, he said to the Thus-Gone One Immaculately Renowned King, ‘I take the Blessed One as my guide. I take the Blissful One as my guide. I take refuge in the Blessed One, the Dharma, and the Sa gha of monks. Blessed one, please teach me ṅthe Dharma, and by any means, I will learn it and thereby dispel the darkness of wrong views of misguided beings with faulty views, becoming myself a teacher of the Dharma of the genuine view. Blissful One, please teach me the Dharma!’2.72“It was then, son of noble family, that the Thus-Gone One Immaculately Renowned King gave a teaching that commenced with this absorption that encapsulates all merit for those gods and bodhisattvas, with the great sage Supreme One at their head. Among the audience of gods, there were eight thousand who had previously refined the roots of virtue, who now formed the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. The great sage Supreme One himself felt tremendous happiness, delight, and elation, and achieved indestructible courage. Such was the teaching that was given. [B.3]2.73“That Blessed One then also taught the following eight adamantine statements: [F.95.a]•‘All phenomena are devoid of afflictions and thus pure.•‘All phenomena are completely bereft of all defilements and thus undefiled.•‘All phenomena are genuinely beyond any basis and thus baseless.•‘All phenomena are nondual and thus without gateway.•‘All phenomena have been shown in all ways to be gateways to liberation and are thus gateways in all ways.•‘All phenomena are without going and thus without transference.•‘All phenomena are entirely bereft of all going and thus without going.•‘All phenomena are indivisible into past, present, and future, and thus are theequality of the three times.’“The blessed one Immaculately Renowned King taught these eight adamantine statements so that all phenomena may be ascertained.2.74“Similarly excellent are these eight statements on the gateways to dharmas so that bodhisattva great beings do not become dullwitted:•‘Naming them is a gateway to all phenomena, because it establishes all kinds of gateways."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"•‘Words are a gateway to all dharmas because they are uttered by different voices.•‘Signs are a gateway to all dharmas because all phenomena are beyond fixation.•‘Their cognition is a gateway to all dharmas because they are hollow, empty, and void.•‘Their essential self-existence is a gateway to all dharmas because they have no essential self-existence.•‘Their exhaustion is a gateway to all dharmas because it is the absence of anything.•‘Imputations are a gateway to all dharmas because imputations do not arise.•‘Their sameness is a gateway to all dharmas because it is their single taste.’“These supreme statements on the gateways to dharmas are taught so that bodhisattva great beings do not become dullwitted.2.75“Similarly excellent are these eight seed phrases, which lead to inexhaustible eloquence:•‘The seed phrase Supreme a teaches how all phenomena are primordially [95b] non-originating.•‘The seed phrase supreme pa teaches all phenomena from the ultimate perspective.•‘The seed phrase supreme na teaches the comprehension of the name and form of all phenomena.•‘The seed phrase supreme da teaches the calming and pacification of all phenomena.•‘The seed phrase supreme sa teaches transcendence of all phenomena.•‘The seed phrase supreme ta teaches the indivisibility of all phenomena within suchness.•‘The seed phrase supreme ka teaches the exhaustion of all phenomena.•‘The seed phrase supreme ma teaches the way all phenomena are bereft of middle and extremes.’“These eight supreme seed phrases lead to inexhaustible eloquence.2.76“Thus one should endeavor in equanimity and with mindfulness and awareness to apply these eight seed phrases, eight statements on the gateways to dharmas, and eight adamantine statements. One should endeavor in correct discernment with behavior that is never frivolous. And one should endeavor always to seek and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"pursue what is wholesome.2.77“Son of noble family, this was the way the Blessed One, the thus-gone oneImmaculately Renowned King responded to the request for statements about the Dharma. In doing so, he illuminated and sent tremors through the world system. He then vanished along with the bodhisattvas, only to reappear at the same moment, the same instant, the same second, in his own buddhafield. There was no sign of him leaving from or arriving in those buddhafields.2.78“Son of noble family, on that occasion, the great sage Supreme One achieved indestructible eloquence. Attaining perfect recall as well, he obtained the protectionof the deities. Protected by the deities, he was able to subdue hostile demonic forces. And so he traveled through various villages, cities, towns, countries, kingdoms, and palaces, teaching the Dharma to others. [F.96.a] In this way, he elucidated and expounded extensively on this absorption that encapsulates all merit.2.79“For one thousand years he taught the Dharma. He matured 84,000 beings to the level of śrāvaka, 84,000 beings to the level of solitary buddha, 84,000 beings to the level of unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, 84,000 beings to the level of wheel-bearing monarch, 84,000 beings to the level of Śakra, and 84,000 beings to the level of Brahmā. He established 84,000 beings in the meditation of love, 84,000 beings in the meditation of compassion, 84,000 beings in the meditation ofjoy, and 84,000 beings in the meditation of equanimity. He led an unfathomable number of beings to advance to the higher realms. Eventually, when the great sage Supreme One passed away, he and 84,000 gods were reborn together in the Totally Immaculate world system, the buddhafield of the thus-gone one, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect buddha Immaculately Renowned King.2.80“Son of noble family, in case you have hesitations, reservations, or doubt thatGreat Supreme Sage might be someone else, do not harbor them. Because it was I who at that time, in those days, was the great sage Supreme One. It was through the blessing of my truthful resolve—my desire and devotion for the Dharma—that the blessed one, the thus-gone one Immaculately Renowned King was invoked from that buddhafield below.2.81“Vimalatejā, you should understand through such accounts that for bodhisattva"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"great beings who yearn for the Dharma, the thus-gone ones do not pass beyond suffering, nor does the sacred Dharma ever disappear. [F.96.b] How is that? Vimalatejā, bodhisattva great beings who yearn for the Dharma with perfect motivation and devotion cause the blessed buddhas to manifest and teach the Dharma, even though they may dwell in a different world system. Vimalatejā, the Dharma treasures of bodhisattva great beings who yearn for the Dharma are found within mountains, mountain caverns, and trees. They contain incantations and infinite gateways to the doctrine laid out in tomes yet to be discovered.2.82“Vimalatejā, to bodhisattva great beings who yearn for the Dharma, divine beings who have beheld previous buddhas grant courage. Vimalatejā, when the lifespan of bodhisattva great beings who yearn for the Dharma comes to an end, the blessed buddhas and gods can grant them lifespan and power. If they wish, through the buddhas’ and gods’ blessings, they can live for a thousand years, or even two, three, four, or five hundred thousand years—or even for an eon, or longer than an eon, for as long as they might desire.2.83“Vimalatejā, for bodhisattva great beings who have engendered devotion to the Dharma, the blessed buddhas even eliminate aging and sickness. They endow them with recollection, and endow them with realization and eloquence as well. The blessed buddhas also eradicate any viewpoints that bodhisattva great beings who have engendered devotion to the Dharma might have, and endow them with the genuine view instead. Vimalatejā, bodhisattva great beings who have engendered devotion to the Dharma cannot be harmed in any way by others. [F.97.a]2.84“In the light of this, Vimalatejā, bodhisattva great beings should endeavor to gain expertise in the accumulation of learning. Bodhisattva great beings who endeavor to gain expertise in the accumulation of learning will attain such extraordinary qualities as these—or even greater and better than these.2.85“Vimalatejā, these three practices constitute the foundation of merit, the accumulation of merit, the emergence of merit, the expansion of merit, the outflow of merit, inexhaustible merit, inconceivable merit, an ocean of merit. The magnitude or measure of the merit of those bodhisattva great beings who live by them is beyond comprehension. Vimalatejā, the magnitude or measure of the dropsof water in the ocean could indeed be reached. However, the quantity of merit of bodhisattva great beings’ accumulation of generosity, discipline, and learning defiescomprehension in terms of magnitude and measure. Vimalatejā, one could reach and identify the magnitude and measure of the weight of all the mountains, trees,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"forests, and grass on earth within the trichiliocosm. However, I assure you that the quantity of merit gathered in the bodhisattva great beings’ accumulation of generosity, discipline, and learning could not be measured.”2.86At that point, the mighty strongman Vimalatejā asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, of these three accumulations—the accumulation of generosity, the accumulation of discipline, and the accumulation of learning—which is superior, which is foremost?”The Blessed One replied, “Vimalatejā, [F.97.b] of the three accumulations—of generosity, discipline, and learning—it is the accumulation of learning alone that is regarded as superior, eminent, preeminent, consummate, foremost, extraordinary, paramount, unsurpassed, unexcelled, and the most prominent of all. Son of noble family, you can think of the accumulations of generosity and discipline as analogous to a mustard seed, and the accumulation of learning as having the size of MountMeru, king of mountains. Son of noble family, you can also consider the accumulations of generosity and discipline as analogous to the trails of birds in the sky, while the accumulation of learning is like the limitless sky throughout the ten directions.2.87“Son of noble family, the accumulation of generosity fulfills two functions. What arethose two functions? It alleviates poverty and creates prosperity. The accumulation of discipline also fulfills two functions. What are those two functions? It counteracts the lower states and brings about the higher states. The accumulation of insight fulfills two functions as well. What are those two functions? It eliminates any views and brings about insight. Son of noble family, the accumulation of generosity involves defilement and grasping, and ripens in the aggregates. Son of noble family, the accumulation of discipline, too, involves defilement and grasping, and ripens in the aggregates. Son of noble family, the accumulation of learning is undefiled, devoid of grasping, and does not ripen in the aggregates. Therefore, son of noble family, those bodhisattva great beings who strive to be diligent should exert themselves in the accumulation of learning.” [F.98.a]2.88On the occasion of this teaching on the accumulations of generosity, discipline, and learning, three thousand beings who had previously engendered roots of virtue formed the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. Five thousand gods purified their Dharma eyes regarding phenomena so that they became cleared of dust, and immaculate. The mighty strongman Vimalatejā, too, achieved acceptance of the Dharma accordingly."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2.89Subsequently the mighty strongman Vimalatejā asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what qualities should a bodhisattva great being possess in order to swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn?”2.90The Blessed One replied, “Son of noble family, there are four qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn. What are those four? To have the conviction that the body is like a reflection; to have the conviction that the voice is like an echo; to have the conviction that the mind is like an illusion; and to have the conviction that all phenomena are the inexhaustible true nature. Son of noble family, a bodhisattva great being who possesses these four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.2.91“Moreover, son of noble family, there are four other qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn. What are those four? To extend love to all beings, while at the same time not havingthe idea of ‘beings’; to have the conviction that all phenomena are empty and impermanent, while not making them into a ‘ground’; to perceive all buddhas, while having no fixation with regard to the physical eye; and to be skilled in discerning the mind, while not focusing on the mind as being a ‘mind.’ Son of noble family, a bodhisattva great being who possesses these four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.2.92“Furthermore, son of noble family, [F.98.b] there are four further qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn. What are those four? To give up everything as a way to renounce views; to have pure discipline as a means to quell all the afflictions; to engender the strength of patience in order to progress in the Dharma; and to foster diligence in order to gain liberation by virtue of solitude. Son of noble family, a bodhisattva great being who possesses these four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.2.93“Son of noble family, there are four additional qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn. What are those four?

Son of noble family, a bodhisattva great being who possessesthese four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.2.95“In addition, son of noble family, there are again four more qualities that a bodhisattva great being should possess to achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn. What are those four? To realize directly the three gates of liberation; [F.99.a] to comprehend the three times; to transcend the three realms; and to have trust in the fact that all phenomena are inherently without birth. Son of noble family, a bodhisattva great being who possesses these four qualities will swiftly achieve acceptance that phenomena are unborn.”2.96At that explanation of these fourfold enumerations of qualities for accomplishment,the mighty strongman Vimalatejā achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn.He felt joy and elation, and simply through that he ascended into the air to the height of seven palm trees. The trichiliocosm shook in six ways. Hundreds of thousands of human and divine instruments sounded. A rain of lotus flowers fell, and the whole world was filled with an immense glow.2.97The Blessed One then smiled. As is an attribute of the thus-gone ones, when he smiled an assortment of blue, yellow, red, white, crimson, crystal, and silver-colored light rays emanated from his mouth. These lights filled the universe with aninfinite, limitless radiance that eclipsed that of the sun and moon and reached even theBrahmā realm, before returning to dissolve into the crown of the Blessed One’s head.2.98At that moment, venerable Ānanda rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One and asked him, “Blessed One, since the blessed buddhas do not smile in the absence of causes and conditions, what are the causes for this smile, and what are the conditions?”"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"2.99He also expressed this in verse: [F.99.b]“You who have attained supreme wisdom and have vast, pure vision,With senses calm, you have achieved sublime, transcendent tranquility;Your body shines with divine light, radiant like a golden mountain.Why is it you displayed this smile, O Blessed One?2.100“While your intelligence understands the three times as they are,As well as the mental doings of gods and men,You are perpetually free of ideas, in attainment of supreme wisdom—Please explain the meaning of your moon-like face’s smile.2.101“As many buddhas as have come in the past, or will in the future,As well as those dwelling now—you are their equal.You who know how beings engage in various good deeds,Please divulge everything, by way of a prophecy.2.102“Your body pervades this entire buddhafield,Your speech resounds widely through numerous buddhafields,Your mind has love for all beings within them.Victorious One, your wisdom is infinite—please explain why.2.103“You have understood that things are void, like a moon in water,Fleeting as an illusion, fundamentally a dream,Ephemeral as clouds, and transient by nature.Lion among Men, please divulge the reason for your smile.2.104“Realizing emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, you are free,Your mind always gentle, expert in the very nature of phenomena;While a tempest rages in the sky, you seem free of elaboration.Why did you smile?

I saw it indeed, Blissful One.”2.108The Blessed One continued, “Ānanda, over the course of a hundred thousand cyclesof three incalculable eons, the mighty strongman Vimalatejā will fully awaken to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood. In the eastern realm known asUtterly Purifying, in the eon known as Praised by Brahmā , he will appear in the world as a thus-gone one, a foe-destroyer, a completely perfect buddha. He will be someone who is knowledgeable and virtuous, a blissful one, someone who knows the world, a charioteer to guide beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods andmen, a blessed buddha known as King of Many Arrangements. Ānanda, that buddha realm known as Utterly Purifying of the Thus-Gone One, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect Buddha King of Many Arrangements will be filled with prosperity, abundance, happiness, plentiful harvests, and gaiety, and will have many human and other inhabitants. As an analogy, Ānanda, the riches and enjoyments of beings in the realm of the Utterly Purifying buddhafield will be on a par with those of the gods in the Joyous Heaven.2.109“In order to gather bodhisattvas, the Thus-Gone One King of Many Arrangements will teach only the bodhisattva collection without expounding anything else.

There will be no extremists. The buddhafield will be made of beryl and be adorned with lotus flowers of gold from the Jāmbū River.”Eventually the mighty strongman Vimalatejā descended from midair. He bowed at the feet of the Blessed One, requested ordination from the Blessed One, and was"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ordained in the teachings of the Thus-Gone One.2.110The bodhisattva great being Nārāya aṇ now said to the Blessed One, “The way that the Blessed One has expounded on the doctrine of discipline, Blessed One, is indeedmarvelous. Blissful One, it is indeed marvelous. Even those who visit the Thus-Gone One to denigrate him, pick out his faults, make trouble, or ridicule him feel deeply pleased, delighted, and overjoyed as soon as they see the Thus-Gone One. Their pride, conceit, and arrogance are utterly subdued. They bow solely to the Thus-Gone One, and prostrate themselves solely to the Thus-Gone One with their palms joined. Blessed One, that was how the mighty strongman Vimalatejā arrived, with immense pride, conceit, and arrogance. Yet he has heard the teaching in this way and has achieved the state of a great being. He will teach the Dharma to eradicate the pride, conceit, and arrogance of an unfathomable, countless number of beings. Blessed One, toward how many thus-gone ones, foe-destroyers, completely perfect buddhas in the past did the mighty strongman Vimalatejā engender the roots of virtue in pursuit of completely perfect awakening, such that now he has attained thesuperknowledges so swiftly?” [F.101.a]2.111The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Nārāya a, “Nārāya a, in the ṇṇpast, the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, longing for unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, engendered the roots of virtue toward six billion, two hundred million buddhas. Subsequent to that, he served an unfathomable, countless numberof blessed buddhas; he took them as his teachers, venerated and worshiped them, and in doing so practiced chastity.”2.112Nārāya a then asked, “Blessed One, what roots of nonvirtue led him to be lacking ṇin the mind of awakening, such that he arrived before the Thus-Gone One with the intention to quarrel, full of pride, conceit, and arrogance?”The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Nārāya a, “Nārāya a, there ṇṇare four traits with which a bodhisattva will neglect the mind of awakening. What are those four traits? Immense pride, disrespect for the Dharma, deprecating the spiritual guide, and speaking falsehoods.

What are those four? To be pretentious; to have deceit in the way one serves beings; to be two-tongued toward spiritual guides; and to be overly fixated on gain and respect. Nārāya a, a ṇbodhisattva who has these four traits will neglect the mind of awakening.2.115“Nārāya a, there are four additional traits with which a bodhisattva will neglect theṇmind of awakening. What are those four? Not to recognize the workings of demons;to be obscured by the veil of karma; to be weak in altruism; and to lack insight and method. Nārāya a, a bodhisattva who has these four traits will neglect the mind of ṇawakening.2.116“Nārāya a, why was it that the mighty strongmanṇ Vimalatejā neglected the mind of awakening? Let me tell you. Once, in the distant past of this Excellent Eon, there appeared in the world a thus-gone one, a foe-destroyer, a completely perfect buddha, one who was knowledgeable and virtuous, a blissful one, one who knew theworld, a charioteer to guide beings, an unsurpassed being, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed buddha known as Krakucchanda. During the period of his teachings,there was a priest named Wealthy as the Great Sal Tree. Misled by demons, this priest developed immense pride, and so he did not make visits to the Thus-Gone One. On top of this, so overcome was he with pride, he would stay around spiritual teachers, both priests and laypeople, to fight, quarrel, and dispute with them. He was disrespectful to the Dharma as well as to Dharma teachers.2.117“At that time, he lacked five things. What five? He had not met the Buddha, not heard the Dharma, [F.102.a] had not had various discussions with bodhisattva great beings who had entered the Great Vehicle, had not dedicated the roots of virtue, and had not stabilized the mind of awakening. Thus he had taken up negative qualities, while not taking up the mind of awakening, and thereby, Nārāya aṇ, did he lack these five things.2.118“Nārāya a, if by any chance you have hesitations, reservations, or doubts that the ṇbrahmin priest Wealthy as the Great Sal Tree at that time, in those days, might be someone else, do not harbor them. For at that time, in those days, it was the mightystrongman Vimalatejā who was the brahmin Wealthy as the Great Sal Tree. Due to his pride, he neglected the mind of awakening. Yet he was protected by his previous"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"roots of virtue and saved only by the mind of awakening; thus he was not reborn in the lower states. He was inflated with pride and had the strength of a mighty strongman, yet through the Buddha’s power, he could not avoid meeting the Buddha. Overwhelmed by the powerful force of the Thus-Gone One, he came here, and he heard of the powerful strength of the Thus-Gone One and the bodhisattvas. Thereby all his pride, conceit, and arrogance were eliminated. Since he did nothing harmful, he met the Thus-Gone One. This was a root of virtue that manifested from causes in the past; thus was he able to swiftly attain acceptance of the superknowledges.”2.119Then the bodhisattva Nārāya a asked the mighty strongmanṇ Vimalatejā, “Son of noble family, what qualities have you engendered to achieve such acceptance?”To this Vimalatejā answered, “I have engendered all the qualities of an ordinary being.”Nārāya a continued, “How did you engender them?”ṇVimalatejā responded, “Just as they do not come into being and just as they do not perish, that is how I engendered them. Just as they cannot be grasped [F.102.b] andjust as they are unborn, that is how I engendered them.”2.120Nārāya a asked, “Son of noble family, what is the difference between the qualities ṇof ordinary beings and the qualities of buddhas? What distinguishes them?”Vimalatejā responded, “They are distinguished in name, though in fact there is no real distinction.”Nārāya aṇ then inquired, “Vimalatejā, what is truly meant by the qualities of ordinary beings?”Vimalatejā said, “They have no true meaning; there is nothing designated and no concept.”2.121Nārāya a asked, “Vimalatejā, what does the true meaning eliminate? What does ṇthe true meaning establish?”Vimalatejā replied, “Nārāya a, the true meaning eliminates the qualities of ṇordinary beings and establishes the qualities of the buddhas.”"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Nārāya a continued, “Vimalatejā, what is truly meant by the qualities of the ṇbuddhas?”Vimalatejā answered, “Nārāya a, the true meaning of the qualities of the buddhas ṇis nonduality.”2.122Nārāya a then said, “The Thus-Gone One has declared, ‘Son of noble family, rely ṇon the true meaning, do not rely on the words.’ He has also stated, ‘There are two causes and circumstances for the correct view to arise, namely other’s words, and one’s own correct mental engagement.’ So how would you explain what are wordsand what is meaning?”2.123Vimalatejā responded, “Nārāya a, a bodhisattva relying on the true meaning does ṇnot reduce his words. Moreover, that words have no reference point is their true meaning. Their true meaning is the true meaning that is inexpressible. For one relying on the true meaning, there are no phenomena whatsoever, and also no true meaning. Why is that? It is because all phenomena are inexpressible, worthless, notdwelling in any place or direction, remaining in themselves [F.103.a] and ceasing inthemselves.3 The Blessed One has also stated, ‘The definition of the true meaning isperpetual cessation.’ Therefore, Nārāya a, one who relies on the true meaning doesṇnot proliferate or elaborate on anything. That which is not proliferated or elaborated is the true meaning.”2.124Nārāya aṇ then asked, “Son of noble family, is there a system according to which relying on the true meaning is to rely on all phenomena?”Vimalatejā answered, “There is, Nārāya a. It is in the sense that all phenomena are ṇempty, that all phenomena are void. It is precisely in the sense that they are empty that they are to be relied on. It is precisely in the sense that they are void that they are to be relied on. In this way, Nārāya a, the one who relies on the true meaning ṇrelies on all phenomena.”2.125Nārāya a declared, “Therefore, Vimalatejā, all phenomena are dependent.”ṇVimalatejā then replied, “Precisely, Nārāya a. It is just as you have said. All ṇphenomena depend on the ultimate truth. They have their gateway in the ultimate truth. We should pursue them within the ultimate truth. We should pursue them in the sense that just as phenomena are not established, nor is the absence of phenomena established. The noble ones’ pursuit is a nondualistic pursuit. This pursuit does not involve doing anything. In this pursuit, there is nothing to be done,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"nothing to be carried out. The pursuit is taking place when there is nothing being done, nothing being carried out. As long as one does not go against the true meaning, it is appropriate to strive.”2.126As the mighty strongman Vimalatejā expounded on the true meaning, the minds of five hundred monks became freed of defilement and without grasping. Eight thousand gods purified the eye of Dharma regarding phenomena so that it became cleared of dust and immaculate.2.127The bodhisattva great being Nārāya a then told Vimalatejā, [F.103.b] “Vimalatejā, ṇthe Thus-Gone One declared, ‘Rely on the true meaning. Don’t rely on the words.’ This is because beings lack skill in the true meaning and experience things dualistically. They also lack skill concerning words, misinterpreting them and failing to understand their true meaning. Thus the Thus-Gone One advised them to rely on the true meaning and not on the words. That way, by relying on the true meaning, they will understand that the very nature of words is sameness, and they will then transcend words altogether.2.128“Son of noble family, those who assume that absorption alone is sufficient and do not learn the teachings of the vinaya will not become free of cyclic existence, since their attitude is pretentious by nature. The Thus-Gone One’s statement that there are two causes or circumstances that lead to the genuine view is thus intended to draw such people who are pretentious by nature into extensive learning. If they then learn the teachings and practice them correctly, their pretense will go away. With those on the path in mind, the Blessed One declared:2.129“‘ Through learning, one will comprehend dharmas.Through learning, one will not do evil.Through learning, one will give up harm.Through learning, one will gain nirvā a.’”ṇ2.130The bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ then asked, “Son of noble family, how should a monk practitioner engage with the Dharma in a genuine way?”Vimalatejā replied, “If one never engages with the Dharma and is never separate from it, that is the way to genuinely engage with the Dharma. Nārāya a,ṇ genuine engagement with the Dharma refers to an absence of engagement. Furthermore, Nārāya a, when a monk does not engage, he does not activate any faults, nor does ṇ"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"he activate the self: this is genuine engagement. When we analyze in terms of beginning and end, then the one being spoken to, the topic of discussion, [F.104.a] the understanding aimed at in the discussion, and explanations of what should be abandoned, what should be realized, and what meditation should be done, are all found not to have a past cause, a future cause, or a present cause—that is genuine engagement.2.131“When one sees that all phenomena have essentially ceased, that is genuine seeing. When one sees that all phenomena are naturally at peace and naturally in a state of union, that is genuine seeing. When one sees that all phenomena have never originated, that is genuine seeing. When one sees that all phenomena have never originated nor arisen, and sees that they are entirely beyond suffering, and one doesnot see one who is seeing and something seen, and does not see them as they are, and does not see them at all—when one so sees, that is genuine seeing.”2.132At this, the Blessed One said to the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, “Excellent. Excellent, son of noble family, excellent. If something is taught or to be taught, it should be taught in this way. To exert oneself in the correct way is to become undeluded about everything. To exert oneself in the correct way is to be unobscuredabout everything. To exert oneself in the correct way is to be beyond bondage and liberation. How is this? It is because correct exertion involves no effort to abandon or be rid of anything. To see all phenomena genuinely, to see them as they truly are,is genuine vision.2.133“What does it mean to see phenomena as they truly are? It is non-seeing alone.Non-seeing is a reference to non-origination. Non-origination is a reference to non-arising. [F.104.b] Non-arising is a reference to non-seeing. It was because I had this in mind that you declared, ‘When all phenomena are not originating and not seen, one will penetrate flawless reality.’ This is genuine vision—to penetrate flawless reality. Why do we use the phrase penetrate flawless reality? That which isthe sameness of self is the sameness of non-self. That which is the sameness of non-self is the sameness of all phenomena. Hence the expression penetrate flawless reality.”2.134The bodhisattva great being Nārāya aṇ then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, abodhisattva may correctly understand this Dharma discourse regarding how all phenomena have such characteristics, and how they are inherently and entirely beyond suffering; upon hearing it, he or she may then believe and be convinced of it. That he or she nevertheless does not pass beyond suffering in the interval"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"period4 is indeed marvelous, Blessed One. Bliss-Gone One, it is indeed marvelous.”2.135The Blessed One replied, “Nārāya a, such is the skill in method of these ṇbodhisattvas. Being so skilled in methods, they suffuse every mind-state they have with four things. What are those four things? Great love, great compassion, omniscient wisdom, and the uninterrupted preservation of the spiritual tradition after the Buddha has appeared.“Nārāya a, they apply these four to everything. They perfectly understand how all ṇphenomena are inherently beyond suffering. They have belief and conviction in what they have heard. Yet still they do not pass beyond suffering in the interval period. They learn the teachings of the vinaya for the sake of beings. Their certainty in understanding and seeing is one of non-seeing. Why is that? [F.105.a] Because they do not give up on any being.”2.136Then the mighty strongman Vimalatejā asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what faults do bodhisattvas have, those whom the Blessed One described as certain to fall?”2.137The Blessed One replied, “Son of noble family, I do not at all regard bodhisattvas as having any faults, and do not have any such concepts whatsoever. Nevertheless, they may focus on the vehicle of the śrāvakas instead of focusing on all sentient beings, instead of focusing on the lineage of the Buddha, the lineage of the Dharma,the lineage of the Sa gha, and the Great Vehicle. They may neglect and disregard ṅthe state of omniscience. They may fail to make aspirations to completely and perfectly awaken. Developing aversion to everything that is composite, they might enter the faultlessness of the śrāvakas.2.138“Bodhisattva great beings should keep their focus on all beings; they should keep their focus on the lineage of the Three Jewels and on the Great Vehicle, and therebylook to the wisdom of omniscience, and have no regard for life and limb. They should understand the single characteristic of all phenomena, and yet not enter faultlessness. Out of their regard for beings, they should familiarize themselves with concentration. And they should not let themselves enter the faultlessness of śrāvakas. Son of noble family, you should understand through this description the way in which bodhisattvas are free of faults, and yet do not enter faultlessness.”2.139The mighty strongman Vimalatejā then said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, this marvelous doctrine of the bodhisattva great beings is not to be found among the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"śrāvakas and solitary buddhas; how wonderful!”2.140On this occasion, since Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta was present in the gathering, [F.105.b] the bodhisattva great being Nārāya aṇ mentioned to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, on this occasion of the absorption that encapsulates all merit, Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta has not presented a talk.”2.141Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta then said to the bodhisattva great being Nārāya a, “Son of ṇnoble family, bodhisattvas do not carry out the practices toward awakening out of a desire for merit. They do not carry out the practices toward awakening out of a desire for gain, praise, or eulogy, nor for the higher states, wealth, followers, fame, renown, or honor.”2.142Nārāya a then asked, “So, Mañjuśrī, why do bodhisattvas carry out the practices ṇtoward awakening?”Mañjuśrī answered, “Son of noble family, bodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakening out of compassion for all beings. Bodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakening out of their longing for the Dharma, their wish to eliminate all beings’ suffering, their wish to eradicate the mistaken afflictions, and their wish to experience a similar suffering themselves;5 they do not carry out these practices out of a wish for gratitude. Therefore, son of noble family, bodhisattvas carry out the practices toward awakening without regard for body or mind, without any clinging, in an unflagging manner without fixation, concepts, or mental engagement. They are undeterred and cannot be stopped, nonconceptual, steadfast,and without attachment or anger. They are exceedingly brave, invincible, unexcelled, unafraid, fearless, intrepid, humble, unabashed, stable, [F.106.a] and unwavering. They arise from detachment, with a single aim, a single principle, reduced to a single thing, remaining in a single principle, striving with a single conviction, wishing all beings to be free, with that single wish, that very wish.”2.143Nārāya a asked, “Mañjuśrī, how does a bodhisattva carry out the bodhisattva ṇpractices?”Mañjuśrī replied, “Son of noble family, whenever a bodhisattva no longer practices awakening to come to an end, to be born, not to come to an end, or not to be born, nor with the conceit of being perpetually at an end or unending, nor disturbed at being perpetually unborn, then a bodhisattva who so practices is carrying out the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"bodhisattva practices.2.144“In addition, Nārāya aṇ, a bodhisattva tells himself that the mind of the past has ended, and does not become involved; that the mind of the future, has not yet come, and does not become involved; and that the mind of the present will not remain, and does not become involved. The bodhisattva great being who practices in this way—without getting attached to the mind of the past, future, or present—is carrying out the bodhisattva practices.2.145“Moreover, Nārāya a, bodhisattvas experience generosity and awakening, sentient ṇbeings and thus-gone ones, all in a non-dualistic way. They experience discipline and awakening, sentient beings and thus-gone ones, all in a non-dualistic way. Theyexperience patience and awakening, sentient beings and thus-gone ones, all in a nondualistic way.

They experience concentration and awakening, sentient beings and thus-gone ones, all in a nondualistic way. They experience insight and awakening, sentient beings and [F.106.b] thus-gone ones, allin a nondualistic way. Whenever bodhisattvas practice the perfections in this way, itis said that simply by virtue of the fact that they are not in conflict with the characteristics or essence of the practice, those bodhisattvas are carrying out the practices of awakening.2.146“Furthermore, Nārāya a, bodhisattvas do not tell themselves that forms are empty.ṇForms are empty by themselves. In the same way, they do not tell themselves that feelings, perceptions, formations, or consciousness are empty. Consciousness is empty by itself. Form is not brought to an end by emptiness; it is simply that form, since its very nature is emptiness, has always been at an end. Likewise feelings, perceptions, formations, and consciousness are not brought to an end by emptiness; it is simply that consciousness, since its very nature is emptiness, has always been at an end. All phenomena are at an end simply because they are at an end by their very nature; it is not because form is at an end that all phenomena are at an end. Nor is it because feelings are at an end, or because perceptions are at an end, or because formations are at an end, or because consciousness is at an end, that all phenomena are at an end. The bodhisattvas who practice in this way are carrying out the bodhisattva practices.2.147“In addition, Nārāya aṇ, bodhisattvas do not try to get rid of the traits of ordinary beings, nor do they practice in order to give rise to the qualities of buddhahood. They do not practice in order to go beyond cyclic existence, nor in order to perfect the state of transcendence of suffering. They do not see unwholesome qualities as"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"fully established, yet neither do they see wholesome qualities as truly established. They do not truly see any knowing apart from what is known. Bodhisattvas are those who, inseparably from the realm of phenomena, are disposed to the practice. Nārāya a, bodhisattvas who practice in this way are carrying out the bodhisattva ṇpractices.2.148“Furthermore, Nārāya a, bodhisattvas determine that the realm of sentient beings ṇ[F.107.a] is limitless, as is the realm of phenomena. Yet they do not practice in order to bring the realm of sentient beings to an end and eliminate it. Why? Because the realm of sentient beings and the realm of phenomena are not two things and they cannot be separated, because they are devoid of characteristics. Therealm of phenomena neither increases nor decreases, and nor does the realm of sentient beings either increase or decrease. All characteristics of the realm of phenomena are also the characteristics of the realms of sentient beings.2.149“Moreover, Nārāya a, because bodhisattvas know that all phenomena lack ṇcharacteristics, they do not practice in order to put an end to the realm of phenomena and the realm of sentient beings, nor do they practice in order to increase them. They practice in order to know how the afflictions come about within them due to mistaken imputation, how they come about due to error, and how they remain once they have manifested. They do not practice in order to destroy the harms in cyclic existence, nor to destroy the self, sentient beings, living beings, or individuals. Nārāya a, bodhisattvas who practice in this way are carryingṇout the bodhisattva practices.” [B4]2.150When Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta bestowed this Dharma teaching, the discourse on practice, sixteen gods who were genuinely immersed in the Great Vehicle achieved acceptance that phenomena are unborn.2.151Then the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, in order to make reverence to this Dharma discourse and to uphold it, made the solemn promise, “Blessed One, I will assist those beings who are devoted to this Dharma discourse to accomplish all their goals.”2.152Finally the god named Free of Demons addressed Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, I, too, [F.107.b] have been inspired to speak about the way in which bodhisattva great beings carry out the bodhisattva practices.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Mañjuśrī replied, “God, if you know it is the right time, then express your inspiration.”2.153The god then proceeded, “Mañjuśrī, any practice related to any phenomenon constitutes bodhisattva practice. Any practice related to any demon constitutes bodhisattva practice. Any practice of any being constitutes bodhisattva practice. Any practice related to training or nontraining constitutes bodhisattva practice. Any practice of any solitary buddha constitutes bodhisattva practice. Any practice of any buddha constitutes bodhisattva practice. Why? Because bodhisattva great beings must train in everything.”2.154Bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ asked the god Free of Demons, “God, how do bodhisattva great beings carry out this type of practice of everything?”The god responded, “Nārāya a, bodhisattva great beings should train in all the ṇ84,000 kinds of conduct of sentient beings. These consist of the 21,000 kinds of conduct related to attachment, the 21,000 kinds of conduct related to anger, the 21,000 kinds of conduct related to delusion, and the 21,000 kinds of conduct in which all three come together. Bodhisattva great beings should engage in all of these kinds of conduct of sentient beings. They should engage in conduct related to attachment, and be free of attachment. They should engage in conduct related to anger, and be free of anger. They should engage in conduct related to delusion, and be free of delusion. They should engage in conduct related to every type of fault, and be free of every type of fault. While bodhisattvas engage [F.108.a] in every type of conduct, they should not be tainted by that conduct. In order to bring beings to maturity, bodhisattvas appear to be carrying out all types of conduct —this is bodhisattva practice.”2.155Bodhisattva Nārāya a then asked, “God, how is it that any practice related to any ṇdemon constitutes bodhisattva practice?”The god answered, “Bodhisattvas should view all kinds of demonic conduct within the mental processes, yet they should avoid becoming caught up in any of the workings of demons. They should not initiate the workings of demons. They should apply this engaging in all types of conduct. They should demonstrate conviction in demons alone, yet they should not fall under their power. They should learn the ripening of demons, yet be free of the workings of demons.”2.156Nārāya a then asked, “God, how is it that any practice related to training, to ṇ"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"nontraining, or to any solitary buddha constitutes bodhisattva practice?”The god answered, “Son of noble family, it is in this way that bodhisattvas connect to those who have interest in the practice that is the lack of essential nature of all practices, the practice that has no ripening, the practice that has no dwelling, the practice that has no transference, the practice that has no birth.”2.157Having spoken this teaching, the god Free of Demons said toMañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, this is the extent of my inspiration. Starting with what I have said about practice, please expand on it, and express it in your own way.”Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, in answer to the god’s request, said, “God, bodhisattva practice entirely transcends all domains. How? Such practice cannot be considered within the domain of the eyes and visual form. Likewise it cannot be considered within the domain of the ears and sound, the nose and scent, the tongue and taste, the body and touch, or that of the mind and mental objects. God, you should understand from this description [F.108.b] how sublime beings’ experience entirelytranscends all these domains. Moreover, god, no matter what practices bodhisattvas are involved in, they never displease the blessed buddhas. Bodhisattvas who act in this way are carrying out bodhisattva practice.”2.158The god then said, “Mañjuśrī, what do bodhisattvas do to please the blessed buddhas?”Mañjuśrī answered, “God, the thus-gone ones have fully and perfectly awakened to the true emptiness of all things. So if bodhisattvas become fixated on some viewpoint, even if it is the Buddha’s teachings, or the view of the transcendence of suffering, they disappoint the thus-gone ones. God, the thus-gone ones have fully and perfectly awakened to the true signlessness of all things. So if bodhisattvas characterize something, or habituate themselves to characteristics, they disappoint the thus-gone ones.2.159“The thus-gone ones have fully and perfectly awakened to the true wishlessness regarding all things. The thus-gone ones have fully and perfectly awakened to all things’ uncompoundedness, lack of existence, lack of occurrence, lack of origination, lack of emergence, absence of marks, and absence of characteristics. They know that no phenomenon comes, goes, or remains. They know that phenomena are inherently pure, inherently luminous, inherently beyond suffering, and like space. So if bodhisattvas apprehend some phenomenon or the essential nature of some phenomenon, they disappoint the thus-gone ones, the foe-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"destroyers, the completely perfect buddhas.2.160“God, if on the other hand bodhisattvas understand that all views are encapsulated in the view of emptiness, that all views are encapsulated in the view of signlessness, [F.109.a] that all views are encapsulated in the view of wishlessness, and that all views are entirely beyond the three realms, then they will understand all things’ uncompoundedness, lack of existence, lack of occurrence, lack of origination, lack of emergence, absence of marks, and absence of characteristics. They will understand that no phenomenon comes, goes, or remains. They will understand that phenomena are inherently pure, inherently luminous, inherently beyond suffering, like space, and inherently free of affliction. In this way, bodhisattva great beings do not disappoint the blessed buddhas.”2.161The Blessed One, bestowing his approval on what Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta had explained, said “Excellent, Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, excellent. You have put it excellently. Bodhisattvas who practice in this way are indeed carrying out bodhisattva practice. They will also swiftly receive their prophecy. Mañjuśrī, I knowthis clearly. Previously, during the time of the Thus-Gone One Dīpa karaṃ, there was no virtuous practice I had not already performed. However, I did not receive my prophecy. And why was that? Because I was practicing in a conceptual manner; I was practicing with effort, and practicing in an apprehending manner. But then, when I met the Thus-Gone One, the foe-destroyer, the completely perfect Buddha Dīpa kara, I transcended all practices. Just upon seeing him, and witnessing the ṃBlessed One’s conduct, I attained that conduct as well, and realized the fact that all phenomena are inherently unborn. It was on this occasion that the Blessed Thus-Gone One Dīpa kara prophesied, ‘In the future, you will be the thus-gone one, the ṃfoe-destroyer, the completely perfect buddha Śākyamuni.’ It was at this time, too, that I attained acceptance that all phenomena are unborn. [F.109.b]2.162“Therefore, Mañjuśrī, those bodhisattva great beings who wish to swiftly attain acceptance that all phenomena are unborn should devote themselves to nonapprehension and effortlessness as described in this discourse on practice; they should apply themselves to liberation.”2.163Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, in order to attain what achievements is acceptance attained?”2.164The Blessed One answered, “Mañjuśrī, it is in order to attain the aggregates, the elements, and sense sources that acceptance is attained. Moreover, Mañjuśrī, it is in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"order to attain all phenomena that acceptance is attained. Mañjuśrī, what is called attaining acceptance is to attain their unending true nature. Mañjuśrī, what is called attaining acceptance is a reference to what is genuinely true. Mañjuśrī, attaining acceptance is not to involve oneself in mundane things. It is to be uninvolved in the phenomena of ordinary beings; the qualities of training and of nontraining; or the qualities of solitary buddhas, of bodhisattvas, or of buddhas. In fact it is called attaining acceptance because there is no involvement with any phenomena. Acceptance is so called because it is not just momentary, in terms of the characteristics of all phenomena and their apprehension. This acceptance has nothing whatsoever that can be considered to do with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind. It has nothing to do with pretense. Not only is it unending, that acceptance also has no end. Not only does that acceptance have no object, it is also not without an object. That is why it is called acceptance.”2.165When this teaching on acceptance was given, five hundred bodhisattvas attained acceptance that all phenomena are unborn, and declared, “We will strive to preserve this absorption that encapsulates all merit. [F.110.a] We will perfect all its incomparable qualities. Blessed One, bodhisattvas should respectfully learn all its profound topics and put them into practice.”2.166Bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ then asked Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, how do bodhisattva great beings become trained in these profound teachings?”Mañjuśrī responded, “Nārāya a, when bodhisattvas know that all phenomena are ṇuncreated and unchanging, simply by so knowing, Nārāya a, those bodhisattvas ṇhave become trained in these teachings. When they know that all phenomena are uncompounded, and have no regret about what they have done or confusion about what they have not done, those bodhisattvas have become trained in these profound teachings. They have become trained when they carry out their activities, when they acknowledge what they have done instead of failing to acknowledge it, when they do not become elated if respected, or disheartened if disrespected, and when they do not apprehend a doer or someone who experiences. They have become thoroughly trained when they give generously and then dedicate that generosity toward awakening. They have become trained when they do not apprehend generosity, awakening, a self, or another. They have become trained, too, when they maintain discipline, practice patience, foster diligence, apply concentration, cultivate insight, and dedicate these toward awakening, yet do not apprehend that insight or the other. Thus should you understand that bodhisattvas,when they do not apprehend awakening, a self, or another, have become trained. [F.110.b] Bodhisattvas who do not apprehend their physical, verbal, and mental virtue, also, have become trained. Bodhisattvas who do not apprehend their skill in"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the physical, verbal, and mental accumulations, too, have become trained.”2.167Then Bodhisattva Constant Stable Diligence said to Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, I too have become inspired to speak about how bodhisattvas become thoroughly trained.”Mañjuśrī replied, “Son of noble family, if you know it is the right time, please express your inspiration.”2.168Bodhisattva Constant Stable Diligence then proceeded, “Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas have become trained when they cause even one being to enter the Buddha’s teachings. If a bodhisattva is eating food with someone, accepting something from someone, or giving something to someone, and draws that person toward awakening, then both of them receive the bodhisattva’s pure benefit. If a bodhisattva draws someone into spiritual practice, then both the giver and recipientreceive the bodhisattva’s pure benefit. The root of virtue is always shared with others whenever a bodhisattva proclaims the words Buddha, Dharma, and Sa ghaṅ to others; or when he brings the Buddha, Dharma, and Sa gha to mind ṅwhile making a gift; or when he mentally cultivates generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, concentration, or insight; or when he proclaims these six perfections to others and causes those beings to reflect on them. If he carries all this out and then dedicates it toward awakening, the bodhisattva has become trained, [F.111.a] and that food has become suitable for consumption.2.169“When practicing patience, bodhisattvas do not become disturbed, even if thieves and brutes insult and revile them. They do not harbor ill will, either, and in order tomake such beings happy, they cultivate diligence and give rise to strength, diligence, and great power. One should understand that in doing so, they have become trained in bodhisattva practice.“Though someone may try to entice them by giving them a billion gold coins, or even a four-continent world system filled with gold coins, bodhisattvas will remain vigilant and not tell lies. If someone should request a teaching, they will not respond with deceptive statements. Nor, if someone should denigrate the Dharma, will they respond in a nonspiritual manner. One should understand that bodhisattvas who act in these ways have been trained.2.170“If bodhisattvas have been fasting for seven days, though someone may offer them ameal, they will only maintain the mind of omniscience, and will actualize the mind"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"of awakening, which is solely in order to liberate all beings. One should understand that these bodhisattvas have then become thoroughly trained.“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, in order to hear the Dharma, bodhisattvas are ready to cross the entire earth, even if it were covered with swords or filled with fire, with noconcern for life or limb. They would reflect, ‘Aggregates, elements, and sense sources are easy to acquire, but it is not easy to encounter the blessed buddhas. It isnot easy to find a Dharma teacher, and not easy to find beings who respect the Dharma.’ With this in mind, they would train accordingly. One should understand that when bodhisattvas have espoused this kind of tenacity, they have become thoroughly trained. [F.111.b]2.171“In addition, Mañjuśrī, one should understand that bodhisattvas have become thoroughly trained when to have one four-line verse, a summary, or a spiritual instruction makes them extremely joyful, but to have a wheel-bearing monarch’s royal dominion brings them no joy. Or when sharing a four-line verse of scripture with even a single being makes feel extremely joyful, but attaining the state of Śakrahas no such effect.“Also, Mañjuśrī, one should understand that bodhisattvas have become thoroughly trained when being generous to a being who has taken rebirth as an animal, such asa dog, makes them extremely joyful, but achieving the state ofBrahmā does not.2.172“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, one should understand that bodhisattvas have become thoroughly trained when dedicating what they have discovered through learning toward the state of omniscience makes them extremely joyful, yet an unfathomable quantity of jewels does not. Or when the mind of omniscience makes them extremely joyful, yet a great trichiliocosm filled with the seven precious materials does not. Or when mentally dedicating one root of virtue toward awakening—focusing on awakening while dedicating it to the aid and happiness of all beings—makes them extremely joyful, but gain, honor, and eulogy in any regard do not.2.173“Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas should always strive to bring beings to maturity. Bodhisattvas should have the firm fortitude necessary to pursue extensiveknowledge. Bodhisattvas [F.112.a] should have the fortitude to give up every part of their bodies. Bodhisattvas should accept worldly things cheerfully. Bodhisattvas should never give up their training, even at the cost of their lives; they should be intelligent in their conduct. Bodhisattvas should have the strength of patience and maintain a tolerant disposition in the face of offensive words. Bodhisattvas should be without laziness, keeping the perfectly pure buddhafields in mind. Bodhisattvas should have the one-pointed determination never to be apart from the mind of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"awakening. Endeavoring in the six perfections, bodhisattvas should never forget themind of awakening. Bodhisattvas should be unflagging in persistence in their own objectives, in not forsaking any being, and in distinguishing the circumstances of allbeings.2.174“Bodhisattvas should be steadfast in their vow to preserve the Buddha’s lineage. Bodhisattvas should be completely honest in body, speech, and mind, avoiding deceit in every respect. Bodhisattvas should be intent solely on what is wholly virtuous in order to safeguard those beings who come for refuge. Bodhisattvas should have no attachment and concern for their bodies and lives. Bodhisattvas should be gentle and welcoming to visitors. Bodhisattvas should speak sincerely without frowning. Bodhisattvas should be like the earth, without attachment or anger. Bodhisattvas should be easy to be with and gentle. Bodhisattvas should be agreeable and eloquent. Bodhisattvas should bow before all beings and overcome their pride. [F.112.b] Bodhisattvas should have humbled their pride, like dogs. Bodhisattvas should be undeceiving, fulfilling the promises they made in the past. Bodhisattvas should be impartial toward all beings. Bodhisattvas should have a loving mindset toward all beings. Bodhisattvas should have great compassion, striving for the aims of all beings. Bodhisattvas should take pleasure in endeavoringto pursue the Buddha’s teachings and all roots of virtue. Bodhisattvas should maintain equanimity, without any regard for the joys and delights of sensual pleasures.2.175“Bodhisattvas should be without stinginess, giving up their bodies and lives entirely. Bodhisattvas should be free of clinging to material possessions as their own. Bodhisattvas should be intent on giving up all concepts and views. Bodhisattvas should be rich in the great wealth of the seven riches. Bodhisattvas should be steadfast and grounded in practice. Bodhisattvas should be insatiable in pursuit of the infinite qualities of buddhahood. Bodhisattvas should be replete with the perfections.2.176“Bodhisattvas should have the heroism that comes from conquering the four demons. Bodhisattvas should be the foremost physicians, skilled in healing all beings of their maladies, the afflictions. Bodhisattvas should be objects of veneration, never apart from the mind of awakening. Bodhisattvas should be fields of merit in their concern for all beings. Bodhisattvas should be like lotuses, unstained by the mud of mundane things. [F.113.a] Bodhisattvas should be like boats, bringing all beings to freedom. Bodhisattvas should be like bridges, with no contempt for anyone, high, medium, or low.

Bodhisattvas should be like kings, with a vast orientation. Bodhisattvas should be like Śakra, worthy of being relied upon by all beings. Bodhisattvas should also be like Brahmā, acting as lord of all things. Bodhisattvas should work for all beings’ welfare, establishing them in the lasting happiness of the transcendence of suffering. Bodhisattvas should be like a father or mother to all beings, giving them things that are helpful and pleasing. Bodhisattvas should be unspoiled and unimpaired by any wholesome or unwholesome qualities. Bodhisattvas should be free of enmity, impartial toward both friends and enemies. Bodhisattvas should not put their trust in any mode of birth. Bodhisattvas should be spiritual benefactors, giving liberally. Bodhisattvas, without being infatuated by their conscientiousness, should be entirely free of carelessness. Mañjuśrī, bodhisattvas who endeavor in bodhisattva practice—who are conscientious in practice, vows, training, [F.113.b] and diligence—are capable of fully awakening to unexcelled and perfectly complete buddhahood.”2.178The Blessed One, expressing his approval of what Bodhisattva Constant Stable Diligence had explained, said to him, “Excellent, son of noble family, excellent. You have described very well the skill of remaining constantly in the bodhisattva’s practice. Son of noble family, bodhisattva great beings who wish to achieve this absorption that encapsulates all merit should avoid everything that is not meritorious, and exert themselves in taking up everything that is meritorious.”2.179Bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ then asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, what distinguishes bodhisattvas who have achieved this absorption that encapsulates all merit? What signs do they have? What marks? What qualities?

Whatever they even wish for is actualized, so they are able to genuinely alleviate all poverty.

They achieve the power of Śakra,Brahmā, and the world protectors, and are empowered as objects of veneration by all beings. Their superknowledge is unimpaired, and they achieve superknowledge. [F.114.a] They gain control over all modes of birth. All the riches of the teachings increase in them, and in their methods they are inexhaustible treasuries. They are free of harmful views, and perceive everything with their insight.2.181“They have no desire for the levels of the śrāvakas or solitary buddhas. They are the ones who train all the śrāvakas and solitary buddhas. They have expertise in the faculties of beings, which they use to bring them all to maturation. They revel in concentration, absorption, equipoise, and the gateways of liberation. Being devoted to giving, they possess untaught generosity. Their three vows being utterly pure, they possess untaught discipline. Having actualized love in their mindstreams, they acquire unfathomable patience. Never discouraged, they work diligently for all beings. Devoted to solitude, they reach perfection in concentration. To bring all beings to maturation, they take birth in the desire realm. Skilled in the discernmentof what is pronounced and what is not pronounced,6 through insight they possess pure liberation. Having abandoned dangerous paths, they possess vision. They are never apart from beholding the true nature and buddhahood. They are never apart from pronouncements of emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, the unconditioned, non-occurrence, non-origination, and non-substantiality. They retain everything the Buddha has said. They are never apart from meeting the community of irreversible bodhisattvas.2.182“They possess all the qualities of buddhafields, [F.114.b] and are liberated without obscurations. They have dispelled the four demons, and have thus vanquished demons and hostile forces. They are characterized by being irreversible, and have acceptance of the profound. Through the magical power of the Buddha’s teachings, they gain swift superknowledge. They even understand the stream of teachings theyhave not heard. They hold all the extensive, pure qualities of buddhafields, and possess all intentions. They leave behind all transmigration caused by their own habitual tendencies. They manifest all sorts of bodies, forms, and bodily natures, and are certain of mentally created abodes and bodies. They are not affected by any opponent. They uphold the blessed buddhas’ sublime teachings. They give up even their bodies and lives to preserve the sublime teachings. Since they display the domains of buddhas and have forever passed beyond suffering, they do not pass beyond suffering.2.183“Having no anxiety or trepidation in the face of an audience, they attain fearlessness.

Their meanings, teachings, definitions, and eloquence are all perfect, and they have achieved true discerning knowledge. [F.115.a] They are conscientious, and devoted to unimpeded wisdom. They point out true omniscient wisdom to all beings, and dwell in the activity of buddhas.2.184“Nārāya a, bodhisattvas who have certainty in this absorption that encapsulates all ṇmerit can be distinguished in these ways. These qualities can also be characterized as their signs, marks, qualities, or benefits.”2.185Then bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, may all beings achieve this absorption that encapsulates all merit! May bodhisattvas who have achieved this absorption come to acquire as well all the qualities and benefits that are not possessed by any śrāvakas and solitary buddhas! Blessed One, any beings who have not come to hear about this precious absorption—or who do not devote themselves to it once they have heard it—must indeed be influenced by demons.”2.186The Blessed One replied, “Precisely, Nārāya a. It is just as you have said. Moreover,ṇthose bodhisattvas who have emerged, are emerging, or will emerge definitively by way of this absorption, acquire an unfathomable number of qualities. They acquire an inconceivable number of qualities.”2.187Nārāya a then askedṇ Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, when bodhisattva great beings wish to achieve this absorption, what Dharma should they strive in?”2.188Mañjuśrī replied, “Nārāya a, bodhisattva [F.115.b] great beings who wish to ṇachieve this absorption should not strive to eradicate the qualities associated with ordinary beings, nor to attain the qualities of awakening. They should not strive in any way toward the Dharma or dissociate themselves from non-Dharma; that is the way they should strive.

They should not form concepts about merit being of a defiled or undefiled type. They should not form concepts about things being meritorious or unmeritorious, whether they are immoral or moral, conditioned or unconditioned, mundane or supramundane. They should devote themselves to all merit that is subsumed in the realm of phenomena. They should embrace merit in the sense that it shares the same characteristics as a nonfluctuating formation. They should regard all beings’ merit as being like this, since they experience the absence of cyclic existence. They should regard the merit of one buddha or that of all buddhas as being similar. At the same time, they should not regard things as being similar or dissimilar, even in the slightest degree, since there are no such distinctions in the realm of phenomena. [F.116.a] They should have conviction that all merit—whether it is that of ordinary beings, that which is associated with training or nontraining, that of solitary buddhas, that of bodhisattvas, or that of completely perfect buddhas—is unreal and insubstantial, with no fixed place or location. And yet they should have conviction that all merit has a connection with all sentient beings.2.190“Son of noble family, consider how any possible physical form is considered to consist and be composed of the four great elements. In the same way, bodhisattva great beings should have conviction that merit has a connection to everything. Theyshould not become infatuated by their merit, since it is the eternal, unending true nature.2.191“Nārāya a, bodhisattva great beings who wish to achieve this precious state of ṇabsorption should not be intimidated by four types of inexhaustible, immeasurable merit. What four types? Immeasurable great compassion for all beings, the immeasurable buddhafields, immeasurable awakened wisdom, and immeasurable engagement with all beings’ mental activity. Nārāya aṇ, bodhisattvas should not be intimidated by these four.2.192“Bodhisattva great beings likewise should have conviction in four inconceivable things. What four things? The inconceivable ways that karmic actions ripen, the inconceivably manifold experiences of beings, the inconceivable ways of awakened liberation of the blessed buddhas, [F.116.b] and the inconceivable pure places where bodhisattvas take birth as wandering beings.

How do they transcribe it, recite it, and gain the acceptance that comes with assimilating it?”Mañjuśrī replied, “Nārāya a, I would not call bodhisattva great beings laypeople if ṇthey happen to even hear of this absorption, nor if they acquire it, transcribe it, recite it, and do not abandon it. [F.117.a] They should only be referred to as renunciants. Why do I say this? Because that is how bodhisattvas who strive to realize this absorption come to free themselves of all notions. Wherever they may be, they do not reject any type of unending merit or wisdom. Nārāya aṇ, in order to bring beings to maturity, bodhisattvas manifest in various colors and forms.2.196“Moreover, Nārāya a, they connect with everything and do not exclude anything. ṇConsider, Nārāya a, the way the moon and sun connect to everything, extending ṇout to the four continents, not excluding anything. In the same way, Nārāya a, ṇbodhisattvas do not dwell in any particular conduct. They do not live as householders and become involved in the affairs of householders. Nor do they become renunciants, living as renunciants and dwelling in the affairs of monks. They could not be described in either way.2.197“Why is this? It is because such bodhisattvas are to regard all modes of birth as unreliable. Consider, Nārāya a, how a highly precious gem such asṇ beryl might be placed in any type of vessel without losing its nature as a precious gem. Similarly, Nārāya a, even though bodhisattvas who abide by this absorption might live as ṇ"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"householders, they should be referred to as renunciants, since they do not lose the identity of the realm of phenomena.”2.198Bodhisattva Nārāya a then askedṇ Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, “Mañjuśrī, [F.117.b] whatshould bodhisattva great beings abide by, so that they will not lose this absorption that encapsulates all merit, and so that they will attain an inexhaustible amount of merit and wisdom?”Mañjuśrī answered, “Nārāya a, there are four ways that bodhisattvas should live. ṇWhat four ways? Bodhisattvas should live without any special attachment to their bodies or lives, and without longing for gain, respect, or eulogy. Bodhisattvas should live in emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness, and not live falling into the certainty of śrāvakas and solitary buddhas. Bodhisattvas should seek out the wisdom of awakening and the knowledge of correct discrimination, and live withoutholding onto deceit, conceit, ideas, or concepts. Bodhisattvas should live in freedomfor all beings alike, and live without apprehending a self, sentient being, life, sustenance, being, or person. Nārāya aṇ, these are the four most superior, eminent, and supreme ways for bodhisattvas to live. They will lead to inexhaustible accumulations of merit and wisdom, to the abandonment of all types of views, and even to the realization of all the qualities of awakening.”2.199Bodhisattva Nārāya a then asked, “Mañjuśrī, how do bodhisattvas achieve these ṇways of living, such that they become renunciants even while living as householders?” [F.118.a]2.200Mañjuśrī replied, “Nārāya a, bodhisattvas have four abodes. What are these four? ṇAbiding in love, abiding in compassion, abiding in joy, and abiding in equanimity. Nārāya a, these four are bodhisattvas’ abodes. Nārāya a, wherever bodhisattvas ṇṇlive—whether in towns or in monasteries—if they abide by these four, they can be aptly described as dwelling in the abodes. Taking as one’s abode a compound like the Palace of Victory, or a mansion, is not what is meant by dwelling in the abodes. Nārāya a, if bodhisattvas lack the fourṇ abodes of Brahmā and yet think they are dwelling in the abodes, they are not only fooling themselves, but the whole world including gods, humans, and demigods. Their alms rounds will be meaningless.2.201“Nārāya a, any and all bodhisattvas who practice chastity emerge definitively by ṇmeans of the four great abodes of Brahmā. Therefore, Nārāya a, those who do not ṇmanifest the four abodes of Brahmā or the accomplishment of the concentrations ofnoble beings are a long way from abiding in the true practice of chastity. They have"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"not forsaken pride, and are still conceited with the mundane view of the transitory collection.”2.202Bodhisattva Nārāya a then asked, “Mañjuśrī, how do bodhisattvas abide in love? ṇHow do they abide in compassion? How do they abide in joy? How do they abide in equanimity?”Mañjuśrī replied, [F.118.b] “Nārāya a, bodhisattvas should abide in these four in ṇthe following way. They abide in love when they think, ‘I shall liberate all beings.’ They abide in compassion when they think, ‘I must set all beings free.’ They abide in joy when they think, ‘I shall establish all beings in the qualities of awakening.’ And bodhisattvas abide in equanimity when they think, ‘I shall free all beings from worldly concerns.’2.203“Moreover, Nārāya aṇ, bodhisattvas abide in love when they have the conviction that the realm of phenomena is empty. They abide in compassion when they have the conviction that all phenomena are void. They abide in joy when they have the conviction that all phenomena are beyond attachment, bondage, and liberation. And they abide in equanimity when they have the conviction that all phenomena are beyond coming and going. In this way, Nārāya a, bodhisattvas abide in love, ṇcompassion, joy, and equanimity.2.204“To put it another way, Nārāya a, bodhisattvas abide in love when they are not ṇintimidated by phenomena lacking inherent identity. They abide in compassion when they are not intimidated by phenomena being void. They abide in joy when they are not intimidated by all the qualities of awakening having the true nature of sameness. And they abide in equanimity when they are not intimidated by the unending true nature of all the buddhafields.2.205“In addition, Nārāya a, the definition of love is the absence of enmity. The ṇdefinition of compassion is the absence of behavior.7 [F.119.a] The definition of joy is the absence of ill will. The definition of equanimity is to be neither arrogant nor timid.2.206“Furthermore, Nārāya a, there can be love and compassion that are not great love ṇand great compassion. Śrāvakas and solitary buddhas do not have great love and great compassion. What śrāvakas and solitary buddhas have is love and compassion, the wish that all beings be happy—and that love is not great love; that"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"compassion is not great compassion.2.207“So what are great love and great compassion? Great love is an impartial attitude toward all beings. Great compassion is what liberates all beings from every kind of suffering. Great love is to forsake your own welfare and to take birth intentionally within existence, among the five kinds of wandering beings. Great compassion is to think that you will free beings from the negative states of cyclic existence and establish them in positive ones.2.208“Nārāya a, you should understand through these descriptions that the love and ṇcompassion that śrāvakas and solitary buddhas have is not great love or great compassion. Nārāya aṇ, bodhisattva great beings, therefore, should possess great love and great compassion.”2.209As this teaching was being given, eight thousand living beings formed the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, saying, “Blessed One, we toowill abide by what Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta has explained here.” [F.119.b] Eighty thousand bodhisattvas achieved the absorption that encapsulates all merit. And eight thousand living beings purified their eyes of Dharma regarding phenomena sothat they became cleared of dust and immaculate.2.210Then Bodhisattva Nārāya a asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the thus-gone ṇones, the foe-destroyers, the completely perfect buddhas, are said to possess the marks of one hundred merits. What merits enable one to accomplish the thus-gone ones’ marks of one hundred merits?”2.211The Blessed One answered Bodhisattva Nārāya a, “Nārāya a, imagine that as ṇṇmany beings as there are in as many universes as there are grains of sand in the Ganges were brought together, and each of them had as much merit as a wheel-bearing monarch. The sum total of the merit of all those beings with as much merit as a wheel-bearing monarch would then match the merit of Śakra, lord of the gods.2.212“Nārāya a, imagine that as many beings as there are in as many universes as there ṇare grains of sand in the Ganges were brought together, and each of them had as much merit as Śakra.

If you were to then bring that entire amount of merit together—the sum total of the merit of all those beings—it would effectively be analogous to carrying out an extravagant offering ceremony.Nārāya aṇ, the amount of merit generated by that extravagant offering ceremony and by its results, multiplied by one hundred, would create one of the marks of a great being that manifests on the body of a thus-gone one. That is why a thus-gone one is referred to as possessing the marks of one hundred merits. [F.120.b] It is such skills that enable the thus-gone ones to manifest on their bodies all thirty-two major marks of a great being as well; these marks are beyond the comprehension of any being. Therefore the thus-gone ones are said to possess the marks of inconceivable merit.”2.215As this teaching on the marks of one hundred merits was being given, the trichiliocosm shook in six ways and was bathed in a bright light. One hundred thousand instruments sounded without being played, and a shower of flowers rained down. Everyone in the whole world, including the gods, was amazed, and burst into a great buzz and jubilation. Joining their palms and bowing to the Blessed One, they all proclaimed together:“The attainment of those who form the resolve set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening is a most excellent attainment indeed!

Wherever this Dharma discourse on absorption is being propounded, we will cross as many world systems as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges in order to hear it, and we are even ready to die for the sake of hearing this teaching.” [F.121.a]2.216The Blessed One replied, “Just so, children of noble family! It is just as you have said. Know that sons and daughters of noble family who fail to hear of this absorption, who fail to retain it, read it, master it, and expound it correctly and in detail to others, must be under the influence of demons. Children of noble family, I would not describe as learned any bodhisattvas who do not expound in detail and correctly to others this absorption that encapsulates all merit.”2.217Then the gods and bodhisattvas together requested the Blessed One, “Blessed One, please grant your blessings that this Dharma discourse on the absorption that encapsulates all merit will be practiced and propagated by all means in times to come.”2.218At that moment the Blessed One emitted light from the coil of hair between his eyebrows. This light illuminated infinite, limitless world systems, while resounding with the phrase, “This Dharma discourse is blessed by the Thus-Gone One, the Foe-Destroyer, the Completely Perfect Buddha!”2.219The Blessed One then said to the venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, before long, when three months have passed, the Thus-Gone One will pass beyond suffering. I entrust this Dharma discourse to you, so that you will retain it and teach it widely to others.“Ānanda, for any being who holds this Dharma discourse in mind, the blessed buddhas do not pass beyond suffering. Neither do their teachings wane. Why? Because, Ānanda, if someone puts this Dharma discourse into practice, he meets the Buddha.

Ānanda, as long as you meet Dharma discourses that I have taught, like this one, that in itself is meeting the Buddha.”2.221As he said this, everyone in the world, including Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta, the bodhisattva Nārāya aṇ, the mighty strongman Vimalatejā, the community of bodhisattva great beings, the great śrāvakas, venerable Ānanda, numerous gods, as well as gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas, all rejoiced and extolled what theBuddha had taught."}]
