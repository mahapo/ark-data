In thefashion typical of Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha’s discourse unfolds within a worldview vastlydifferent in scope from ordinary reality. Here we meet bodhisattvas who have journeyed acrossbillions of universes to hear the Buddha’s teaching, bringing with them samples of the splendors andpleasures that adorn their distant buddha realms. The vast scope of this sūtra pertains not only to thedistances traveled, but also to the timespan covered. Through his omniscience, the Buddha recallsevents that happened at the dawn of time and predicts affairs yet to unfold in a far-distant future. Inthis way our ordinary perceptions of time and space are challenged as we enter the worldview of theGreat Vehicle. I.2 The sūtra begins outside Vārāṇasī, in the Deer Park where the Buddha first turned the wheel ofDharma after his awakening. This time, however, he is not just speaking to his five previouscompanions, the audience for his first teaching. Now, we are told, there are 20,000 monks, 12,000bodhisattvas, 20,000 deities, and several hundred thousand other beings present. I.3 As is customary in sūtra literature, the Buddha delivers his Dharma talks at the request ofsomeone who poses a particular question and asks for clarification. In this particular sūtra, the roleof the questioner is played by a bodhisattva named Padmaśrīgarbha, who asks the Buddha how onecan attain a particular type of absorption known as the illusory absorption and, after attaining thatabsorption, quickly attain complete awakening. I.4 The Buddha is pleased with this request and praises Padmaśrīgarbha for asking such a meaningfulquestion. He then proceeds to explain that there is one quality that underlies all attainments ofawakened qualities and the state of awakening itself. When in possession of this one quality, abodhisattva will naturally proceed along the path until finally gaining perfect buddhahood. TheBuddha reveals that this crucial and indispensable quality is not to abide anywhere in the threerealms, whether internally in the mental sphere or externally in the outer world. I.5 If one is able not to abide in this manner, one will come to understand that all phenomena areunborn, an understanding that enables one to practice the bodhisattva path. With the realization thatall phenomena are unborn comes the understanding that phenomena are likewise illusory andempty. This is the point at which one attains the illusory absorption. When this absorption isattained, one is able to display a variety of bodies in order to teach and guide sentient beings. At thatpoint, full and complete awakening is not far off. I.6 Padmaśrīgarbha continues to ask the Buddha about the illusory absorption, and he wonderswhether anyone among his peers in the Buddha’s retinue might have obtained this absorption.Indeed, the Buddha confirms, several students have gained this absorption, but all of them havePage 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"attained their realization by associating with two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta, who live in Sukhāvatī, the distant realm of Buddha Amitābha. I.7 Padmaśrīgarbha implores the Buddha to manifest a miraculous sign that will summon these twobodhisattvas, so that others may be blessed by their presence in this world and likewise attain theillusory absorption. The Buddha consents and emits a light from the hair between his eyebrows, alight so bright that it illuminates the entire world of Sukhāvatī. When all the bodhisattvas inSukhāvatī ask Amitābha about the origin of this light, he reveals that it is being emitted by BuddhaŚākyamuni to indicate that a Dharma teaching will shortly be delivered. Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta request permission to attend the teaching, and Amitābha encourages them to go.The two bodhisattvas bring with them on the journey no less than 840 million other bodhisattvas,who each manifest a beautiful mansion as an offering to the Buddha Śākyamuni. Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta multiply this offering by emanating 840 million exact copies within eachmansion, thus producing a mind-boggling display of gifts. I.8 The pilgrimage to this world is not an arduous one by any means, being completed within a singlesecond. Once the bodhisattvas arrive, they pay homage to Buddha Śākyamuni and sing his praises ina series of beautiful verses. The bodhisattvas and hearers in the retinue of Buddha Śākyamuni are,of course, amazed by the arrival of all the bodhisattvas from Sukhāvatī and their impressive displayof offerings. So they ask the Buddha about the merit that allows Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta to perform such a display. The Buddha reveals how these two bodhisattvas areable to multiply their bodies in inconceivable ways, thus gaining merit by serving countless buddhasin endless realms. I.9 Next, Buddha Śākyamuni recounts the story of how Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta firstgave rise to the mind of awakening that signifies the beginning of the bodhisattva path. We hearhow these two beings, in a far, far distant past, were born miraculously from two lotus flowers in therealm of a buddha known as King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, who himself was a previousemanation of Buddha Amitābha. The place where it all unfolded, we are told, was none other thanthe world of Sukhāvatī, at that time known as Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities andFull Display of Happiness. I.10 As is typical of many Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha proceeds to reveal the circumstancessurrounding the future awakening of the protagonists in question, in this case Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta. Once Buddha Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa and no trace remains of histeachings, Avalokiteśvara will fully awaken at dawn on the very next day and receive the nameBuddha Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja. At that point the realm will no longer be known asSukhāvatī, but rather Complete Gathering of Wealth. Next, once this particular buddha passes intonirvāṇa, Mahāsthāmprāpta will awaken in a similar fashion and be known asSupra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja. I.11 The names of these two future buddhas turn out to be of key importance in the sūtra, becauseanyone who happens to hear them will be irreversibly destined to unsurpassed and perfectawakening. The blessing of hearing these two names is also such that any woman will be able to putan end to future female rebirths, and in that way join the saṅgha of monks. Page 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I.12 At this point the Buddha’s teaching is complete, and everyone in attendance rejoices and arousesthe mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Many of the listeners in attendance developvarious signs of accomplishment and become free from obscurations. Avalokiteśvara andMahāsthāmprāpta also cause a miracle so that the entire retinue can behold all the limitless,uncountable buddhas in all directions, who are making prophecies for their unsurpassed and perfectawakening. I.13 As is typical of Great Vehicle sūtras, toward the end of the story the Buddha speaks of the greatamount of merit to be gained by upholding and propagating the sūtra, and everyone gathered at theoccasion promises to spread the teaching to the best of their ability. The Buddha repeats hisstatement that any woman who hears this teaching will be transformed immediately into a man.(Today’s readers should keep in mind that these teachings were given in a society where the statusof women was generally low, and women were expected to be subservient and deferential to men. Itis also important to remember that the Buddha did allow women into his order, which at the timewas a radical endorsement of women as worthy spiritual practitioners.) I.14 Finally, while thousands of gods scatter flowers and praise on the Buddha and the assembledbodhisattvas, a young girl stands up and announces that she has decided to give up the negativeemotions that cause beings to be born as women. Instead, she promises, she will set her mind oncomplete awakening. In front of the Buddha she vows to become an example for other women byrelinquishing her female body, and she requests the Buddha’s blessings to help her do so.Immediately her body is transformed and becomes that of a man. With this metamorphosiscomplete, the Buddha foretells that she is destined to become a future buddha known by the nameRepeller of All Disturbing Emotions, and the sūtra comes to an end. I.15 No Sanskrit version of the text is known to exist, but in addition to this Tibetan translation thesūtra survives in two earlier Chinese translations. The Tibetan translation, by Surendrabodhi andYeshé Dé, must have been completed in the early translation period, as it is listed in both early 9thcentury inventories, the Denkarma (ldan dkar ma) and Phangthangma (phang thang ma). Accordingto the catalogues of both the Degé and Narthang Kangyurs, the sūtra has nine chapters or sections (le’u), and the Narthang catalogue mentions that the existence of nine le’u is mentioned by the GreatFifth Dalai Lama in the list of texts of which he received the transmission (gsan yig). However, nosuch formal section breaks can be seen in the Tibetan text as preserved in the different Kangyurs,and it would be unusual for a relatively short text such as this to be divided into formally distinctchapters. It may be that in this and similar catalogue entries1 the term le’u is being used to denote“episodes” or “scenes,” rather than in its more usual sense of chapters; it would not be impossible todiscern nine or more parts to the narrative in this text. I.16 Unlike the names of some of the specific absorptions described in sūtras, “the illusoryabsorption” is a term that occurs in a wide range of canonical texts, including the Prajñāpāramitāsūtras, the Laṅkāvatāra, and in several tantras and their Tengyur commentaries.2 This sūtra, aswould be expected from its title, is indeed sometimes mentioned or cited in later Tibetan works inconnection with the illusory absorption itself. More often, however, it is mentioned as one of thescriptural sources of the stories of Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta. The other notable sourceis the Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka (Toh 112), which contains a similar but much more detailed account of thepredictions of these two bodhisattvas’ future attainment of complete buddhahood, as well as aPage 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"different episode from their previous lives.3 Page 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATION The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra The Illusory Absorption 1.1 Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas! 1.2 Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Deer Park by the Hill of theFallen Sages near Vārāṇasī, together with a great saṅgha of twenty thousand worthy monks andtwelve thousand bodhisattvas that included the bodhisattva great beings Harisiṃha, Siṃhamati,Supratiṣṭhitabuddhi, Anupamamati, Dharaṇīṃdhara, Agnidatta, Varuṇa, Ratnākara, Guhyagupta,Bhadrapāla, Vidyutdeva, Vairocana, Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, Jñānākara, Anikṣiptadhura,Amoghadarśin, and the bodhisattva great being Maitreya. Also in attendance were twenty thousandgods who had all entered the Great Vehicle, such as Susīma and Supratiṣṭhitabuddhi. [F.211.a] Atthat time the Blessed One, surrounded and venerated by a retinue of several hundred thousandbeings, was teaching the Dharma. 1.3 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha stood up, draped his shawl over one shoulder, andknelt on his right knee. With his palms together, he bowed toward the Blessed One, and inquired ofthe Blessed One, “If this is an opportune moment for the Blessed One to grant me answers to somequestions of mine, may I put them to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfectBuddha?” The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha, “Padmaśrīgarbha, it isalways opportune for the Thus-Gone One to address your concerns. Padmaśrīgarbha, ask the Thus-Gone One, the worthy, completely perfect Buddha, whatever you wish, and I will address yourquestions, so that you may feel at ease.” 1.4 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how is it thata bodhisattva great being renders irreversible his progress to unsurpassed and completely perfectawakening, comes to possess the five types of clairvoyance, and attains the illusory absorption?How is it that, as soon as he attains that absorption, he emanates whatever bodies in whatever waywill perfect sentient beings’ roots of virtue, and teaches the Dharma according to sentient beings’inclinations? How does he quickly awaken to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood?” 1.5 The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha, [F.211.b] “Padmaśrīgarbha,excellent! Padmaśrīgarbha, previously you have served the victorious ones, gathered the roots ofvirtue, and venerated a myriad buddhas. You feel love and compassion for all beings, and that iswhy you ask the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha about this. That is excellent!Page 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Padmaśrīgarbha, therefore, listen well and pay attention. Then I shall explain it to you.” The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Wonderful!” and helistened as the Blessed One had directed him. 1.6 The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, there is one quality that, if a bodhisattva great beingpossesses it, renders irreversible his progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, andgrants him the five types of clairvoyance and the illusory absorption. Moreover, as soon as heattains that absorption, he emanates whatever bodies in whatever way will perfect sentient beings’roots of virtue, teaches the Dharma according to sentient beings’ inclinations, and quickly awakensto unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood. “What is that single quality? Padmaśrīgarbha, the bodhisattva must not abide anywhere in thethree realms, neither abiding internally nor externally. As he does not abide, he will see reality. Ashe sees reality, he will unite with reality. As he unites with reality, nothing will impede his mind. Asnothing impedes his mind, he will engage in authentic conduct. 1.7 “What does it mean to engage in authentic conduct? It is as follows. [F.212.a] All phenomenaarise in dependence. There is no phenomenon that can remain constantly. All phenomena arise fromcircumstances. There is no phenomenon that arises without circumstances. Any phenomenon thatarises in dependence is unborn. Therefore all phenomena are unborn. To realize that all phenomenaare unborn is to know how to practice the bodhisattva’s path. In this way, one attains the basis forbenefiting all beings and can proceed with a compassionate outlook. With such conviction, onecomes to understand that all phenomena are illusory. All phenomena are magically manifestbecause they are imputed. Those imputations are also utterly empty. The realization that allphenomena are empty is the attainment of the illusory absorption. “As soon as one attains this absorption, one emanates whatever bodies in whatever way willperfect sentient beings’ roots of virtue, and teaches the Dharma according to sentient beings’inclinations. In this way, one quickly awakens to unsurpassed and completely perfect buddhahood.” 1.8 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, is there anybodhisattva great being here in this gathering who has attained this illusory absorption?” The Blessed One replied, “Padmaśrīgarbha, there are sixty holy beings here in this gathering whointentionally wear the armor and who have attained the illusory absorption. There are sixty holybeings, including the bodhisattva great beings Maitreya and Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta, who haveattained this illusory absorption.” 1.9 Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, did these holy beings [F.212.b] attain thisillusory absorption here in this world? Or did these holy beings attain this illusory absorption insome other realm?” The Blessed One answered, “Padmaśrīgarbha, to the west of this buddha realm, passing throughone trillion buddha realms, there is a realm known as Sukhāvatī. Right now the Thus-Gone, worthy,completely perfect Buddha Amitābha resides there, flourishes there, lives there, and teaches theDharma. In his buddha realm live the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattvagreat being Mahāsthāmprāpta, both of whom have attained this absorption. Padmaśrīgarbha, it isfrom conversations lasting seven days with those two holy beings that other bodhisattva greatPage 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"beings attain this illusory absorption.” 1.10 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, there mustbe many bodhisattva great beings who attained the illusory absorption in that buddha realm. BlessedOne, the reason is that the bodhisattva great beings who are born in that buddha realm can engage inDharma conversations with those two holy beings without any effort.” The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, it is exactly as you say. The bodhisattva great beingswho abide there within the illusory absorption are indeed limitless and countless.” 1.11 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, [F.213.a]thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, please use your miraculous powers to show a mentalsign by which the two holy beings will come to this Sahā world, and the whole Sukhāvatī worldtogether with the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha will also arrive here inthis world. The reason is, Blessed One, that if those two holy beings come to this buddha realm, thesons and daughters of noble family who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will perfect theirroots of virtue. They will hear the Dharma talks of those two holy beings, and they, too, will therebyattain the illusory absorption. Here in this buddha realm they will be able to behold Sukhāvatī aswell as the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha Amitābha. Witnessing that, the sons anddaughters of noble family will arouse the mind of unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.They will make aspirations to be born in that buddha realm and, as soon as they are born there, theywill render irreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.” 1.12 The Blessed One, understanding the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha’s request, emitted abright light from the hair between his eyebrows. The light pervaded this entire trichiliocosm with abright golden radiance. Throughout the entire trichiliocosm, all mountain ranges and forests as wellas the central mountain, the Mucilinda Mountains, the Greater Mucilinda Mountains, thesurrounding mountains, the greater surrounding mountains, and all places of deep darknessthroughout the world were bathed in that golden light, [F.213.b] eclipsing even the sun and themoon—so well known for their great miraculous ability, great strength, and great power—to thepoint of invisibility. Toward the west, crossing through a trillion buddha realms, that brilliant goldenlight pervaded the entire realm of Sukhāvatī. There, the light prostrated at the feet of the Thus-Gone,worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, circumambulated him seven times, and, in thatblessed one’s presence, disappeared. 1.13 The beings who lived in Sukhāvatī, including the bodhisattvas and the great hearers, lookedtoward this Sahā world and saw the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamunisurrounded by the gathering of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha of hearers. As theysaw it all, as clearly as seeing an āmalakī fruit right in their own hand, they were filled with joy andgreat happiness, and exclaimed, “Homage to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completelyperfect Buddha Śākyamuni!” 1.14 Here in the Sahā world, the assembled retinue of the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfectBuddha Śākyamuni consisted of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas,demigods, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragās, humans, nonhumans, Śakra, Brahmā, the guardiansof the world, and bodhisattvas. All of them could now also vividly see the world of Sukhāvatī andthe Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, [F.214.a] who was shining like thePage 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"king of mountains, surrounded by the assembly of bodhisattvas and attended upon by the saṅgha ofhearers. They saw the entire buddha realm in this way. Just as a person with perfect sight can see theface of another person only a fathom away without any strain, from this world and this buddharealm they saw the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, as well as the worldof Sukhāvatī, which appeared in a great display of fine features, filled with trillions of qualities.Witnessing it, they were filled with joy and great happiness, and said, “Homage to the Blessed One,the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha!” 1.15 When that buddha realm was shown to them, 84,000 beings here in this buddha realm, who hadnot previously aroused the mind of awakening, now gave rise to the mind set upon unsurpassed andcompletely perfect awakening. They dedicated the roots of virtue toward taking birth in the world ofSukhāvatī, as well as toward unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. In the world of Sukhāvatī, the assembled bodhisattva great beings and great hearers saw the Sahāworld and were amazed. They joined the palms of their hands and prostrated toward the BlessedOne, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni while they called out, “Homageto the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni!” As soon as the bodhisattva great beings and the great hearers had spoken these words, the entireworld shook in six ways: [F.214.b] it vibrated, shuddered, and reeled; quivered, trembled, andquaked; wobbled, rocked, and swayed; boomed, thundered, and roared; rattled, shook, andconvulsed; and clattered, rattled, and clanged. 1.16 Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great beingMahāsthāmprāpta went before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect BuddhaAmitābha. Prostrating with their heads to the Blessed One’s feet, they respectfully stood to one side.Standing together, the two holy beings said to the Blessed One, “The Blessed One, the thus-gone,worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni has attained very stable powers. Blessed One, it isamazing. Blissful One, it is amazing. Why? Blessed One, it is like this. When so much as the nameof the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni was pronounced,even this inanimate earth shook in six ways.” 1.17 The Thus-Gone Amitābha said to the two holy beings, “Sons of noble family, not only was thename of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni pronounced inthis buddha realm, the name of that Blessed One was also pronounced in many other buddha realms.Those buddha realms, too, all shook in six ways when touched by that light. In those buddha realms,limitless and countless beings heard the name of the Thus-Gone One Śākyamuni, [F.215.a] andthereby perfected their roots of virtue and rendered irreversible their progress to unsurpassed andcompletely perfect awakening. Then, from among the assembly of bodhisattvas, four hundredmillion bodhisattvas heard the name of the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni. When theyheard it, they all gathered and, in a single voice, dedicated the roots of virtue toward unsurpassedand completely perfect awakening. The Blessed One also prophesied that they would renderirreversible their progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.” 1.18 Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great beingMahāsthāmprāpta said to the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, “TheBlessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, has sent forth a light that we have previously never seen norheard of. Now, since the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect BuddhaPage 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Śākyamuni, would not emit such a wonderful and beautiful light without causes or circumstances,please tell us what the causes and conditions are for the Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, tosend forth such a wonderful and beautiful light.” 1.19 The Thus-Gone Amitābha said to the two holy beings, “Sons of noble family, what you say istrue. That Blessed One would not send forth such a wonderful and beautiful light without anycauses and conditions. And why? Because the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completelyperfect Buddha Śākyamuni, is about to deliver a Dharma teaching on how to accomplish theprecious absorption known as the bodhisattvas’ application. That is why [F.215.b] the Blessed OneŚākyamuni emitted this wonderful and beautiful light as an omen of that Dharma teaching.” 1.20 Then the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great beingMahāsthāmprāpta said to the Thus-Gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, “In orderto gaze upon, honor, venerate, and serve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfectBuddha Śākyamuni, and also to hear his Dharma teaching, we, Blessed One, will travel to that Sahāworld.” The thus-gone one Amitābha said, “Sons of noble family, you know that the time has come forthe Blessed One, the thus-gone Śākyamuni, to teach the Dharma to an assembly headed by the twoof you, so please do go ahead.” 1.21 With this permission, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great beingMahāsthāmprāpta called out to the four hundred million bodhisattvas assembled in the retinue of theBlessed One, the thus-gone Amitābha, “Sons of noble family, come! In order to behold, honor,venerate, and serve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni,and also to hear his Dharma teaching, let us travel to the Sahā world. Why? Because the BlessedOne, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, gave up all the many perfectlypure buddha realms and, through his aspirations and great compassion, manifested in that afflictedbuddha realm. Because he undertook austerities, it was amidst those sentient beings who have basedesires and raging attachment, anger, and delusion, [F.216.a] that he fully awakened to unsurpassedand completely perfect buddhahood.” 1.22 As soon as the two holy beings had spoken these words, all of the bodhisattva great beings in theworld of Sukhāvatī assembled and said in a single voice, “Blessed One, any being who even hearsthe name of the Blessed One, thus-gone Śākyamuni, reaches excellent attainments. That being so,what need is there to mention those who actually see him with their physical eyes and engenderfaith? Blessed One, we shall also travel to the Sahā world in order to behold, honor, venerate, andserve the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and also tohear his Dharma teaching.” The Blessed One said, “Sons of noble family, you know that the time has come, so please goahead.” 1.23 So the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāptaset out from the world of Sukhāvatī, surrounded and preceded by 840 million bodhisattvas. At thatpoint they manifested their miraculous powers, and by those miraculous powers 840 millionbodhisattvas each emanated 840 million mansions. The miraculously manifested mansions werePage 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"square, structured around four pillars, even and well proportioned, and of excellent design.

Some of the goddesses held conches, drums,clay kettle drums, wooden kettle drums, lutes, and flutes, while others sang melodiously, and yetothers held up reed pipes, one-stringed lutes, and three-stringed lutes. In this way they were playinginstruments, singing songs, and making music in abundance. Some goddesses were holding vesselsof powdered red sandalwood; some goddesses were holding vessels of powdered uragasārasandalwood; some goddesses were holding vessels of powdered aloe wood and sandalwood; somegoddesses were holding vessels of powdered black aloe wood and sandalwood; some goddesseswere holding vessels of all types of powdered sandalwood; some goddesses were holding vessels ofpowdered blue lotuses, pink lotuses, water lilies, and white lotuses; some goddesses were holdingvessels of powdered flowers of māndārava, mahāmāndārava, pāruṣaka, mahāpāruṣaka, mañjuṣaka,mahāmañjuṣaka, roca, mahāroca, cakra, mahācakra, sarvacakra, atyarthaśobhaticakra, candra,mahācandra, atyarthaśobhaticandra, paramacandra, sthāla, and mahāsthāla; some goddesses wereproffering vessels of all types of powdered flowers, perfume, incense, flower garlands, andointments. 1.25 In each mansion appeared an ornately decorated lion throne upon which the form of a thus-goneone was seated, adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great being. [F.217.b] In each of themansions appeared 84,000 pearl garlands, made of white, red, and blue pearls. In each of themansions appeared 84,000 victory banners made of divinely manufactured fabric, each of themcovered in a lattice of small golden bells. In each of the mansions appeared 84,000 censers ofincense. In each of the mansions appeared 84,000 parasols of various colors, multiple colors,hundreds of thousands of colors, beautiful, well-crafted, and of fine proportions. In each of themansions appeared 84,000 rows of palm trees. In each of the mansions appeared 84,000 jewel trees.In each of the mansions appeared 84,000 lattices of small bells that, when stirred by the wind,Page 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"sounded tunes resembling the music performed by skilled musicians playing trillions of divineinstruments. Such were the sweet and beautiful tunes that rang out from those bells when stirred bythe wind. In each of the mansions appeared ponds, the bottom of each lined with gold dust, adornedwith beryl and crystal, and encircled by a ring of the seven precious gemstones. The ponds werefilled with blue and pink lotuses, water lilies, and white lotus flowers, and on them were wild geesecalling out. The ponds were filled to the brim with water of eight properties, making them excellentfor the birds to quench their thirst. Each of the mansions was surrounded by seven rows of jeweltrees, and 84,000 jewel strings bound them all together. The light shining from each of the mansionsextended for 84,000 leagues. Such was the layout of all the mansions. [F.218.a] Inside each of those mansions, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattvagreat being Mahāsthāmprāpta then again emanated the entire display of all the mansions that theyhad produced, along with all of their elaborate internal contents, in a precise copy. 1.26 Once the two bodhisattva great beings had emanated those displays inside each of the mansions,the displays together with 840 billion bodhisattvas all vanished from the world of Sukhāvatī andarrived here in this Sahā world in just a single moment, a single second, a single instant. It happenedas quickly as it takes for a strong person to extend his arm and flex it again. At that point the twobodhisattvas miraculously transformed this Sahā world so that it became as even as the palm of ahand. Such was the miracle that they manifested. All the bodhisattvas also arrived together with the840 million mansions. This great display of qualities was absolutely resplendent. The light thatshone from the mansions pervaded this entire trichiliocosm. 1.27 Then the two bodhisattvas went before the Blessed One, the thus-gone, the worthy, completelyperfect Buddha Śākyamuni. They prostrated with their heads at the feet of the Blessed One, thethus-gone, the worthy, completely perfect Buddha Śākyamuni, and circumambulated him threetimes before standing off to one side. As they stood there, those two holy beings, [F.218.b] in asingle tune and a single voice, praised the Blessed One with these verses: 1.28 “We prostrate to your unrivaled splendor, your mass of qualities! Great Omniscient Sage, you have perfected all good qualities.You outshine everyone and transcend the desirous path of the three realms.Supreme leader of the Śākyas, we prostrate before your stainless, moon-like face. 1.29 “Your body is beautiful, like the stainless sun.You wear the armor of the thirty-two perfect signs,And light up the world with your adornments, the excellent marks.Perfect man, no one in the three worlds can compare to you. 1.30 “When faced by the light from the body of the Blissful One,The light of the sun, the moon, every jewel and fire in the world,That of any human, or gods like Śakra and Brahmā,Is eclipsed, dimmed, and shines no more than a pool of ink. 1.31 “Victorious One, while present in one realm,You instantaneously go to limitless others for the sake of beings.Page 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"No one can comprehend the departure and arrival of the teacher.Your many deeds and disciplines tame beings. 1.32 “In a single pore you can display limitless realms,Yet nothing increases or decreases.This is beyond the workings of karma, cause and effect.No being is harmed, and nothing is confused. 1.33 “To some supreme beings you display the pure lands,Where there are no hell beings, animals, or pretas,And which are full of the renowned sons of the victorious ones—A realm of perfect delight beyond the eight unfree states. 1.34 “To remedy others, gods and humans lacking fear and careless in their ways,Once you show them the unbearably afflicted realms,The states to which they could go as hell beings, animals, and pretas,They all take refuge fully in the Blissful One. [F.219.a] 1.35 “In some other realms you manifest in the form of space;Likewise, in other realms you blaze in the form of fire and flames.You manifest by filling other realms with water;These emanations are the domain of omniscient wisdom. 1.36 “In order to tame others you display limitless forms.To some you appear in the shining form of the Lord of Desire,Lord of the Brahma realm who attained the supremely peaceful absorption,And the Lord of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, the thousand-eyed blazing vajra. 1.37 “Many hundreds of beings are delighted and worship you;Through the ten virtues, limitless beings are tamed.You are supreme among ministers, merchants, and royal counselors;Fearless when enemies descend, you are unharmed by their attacks. 1.38 “With the four means of attracting disciples, you gather beingsAnd establish them on the path to perfect awakening.Through meritorious action you become a universal monarchWho masters the four continents in possession of the seven riches. 1.39 “To some, here in this world, you demonstrated birth,And taking seven steps over the ground,With your beautiful voice endowed with eight aspects, you said:‘This birth of mine will bring an end to birth and death.’ 1.40 “During the time of Dīpaṃkara you had abandoned all defilements,And yet, to ripen beings for the supreme wisdom of awakening,To some you stayed, a pure being, amidst a retinue of queens.Page 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Lord of Men, you also taught the queens and your son. 1.41 “You gave up your parents, your cherished retinue of friends and relatives,Your kingdom, wealth, and many treasuries of jewels.Śakra, Brahmā, and the demigods revered you;Great Sage, you left home and lived in the forest. 1.42 “To benefit beings, for six years you underwent hardship, [F.219.b] Focused in supreme and precious all-pervasive concentration.In order to defeat all the hordes of extremists,You, a pure being, went to the foot of the bodhi tree. 1.43 “In order to ripen beings for the supreme wisdom of a buddha,Lord of Men, you entered into the supreme illusory absorption;Victorious One, you took on a physical appearanceOf such a kind that would tame the world. 1.44 “Just as an illusionist, in order to trick others,Will produce many illusory manifestations, so too, you,Lamp of the World, in order to tame beingsProduced the many manifestations of your buddhahood. 1.45 “Heroic Sage, to some you showed the taming of Māra and his armies.And did what no one else out of all the extremist hosts has done:You attained immaculate omniscience beyond nirvāṇa,And turned the unsurpassable and unchanging wheel. 1.46 “Over many billions of eons you discovered awakening;On all paths you turned the wheel.Lord of men, like a moon reflected in water, you appear to all;Self-Originated Blissful One in infinite places, we prostrate to you. 1.47 “To some, you show the Dharma body of a Buddha,The permanent, stable, enduring, unchanging,Immutable, unborn, stainless, and unceasing Dharma.It pervades all the ten directions, which are like an optical illusion. 1.48 “To some you say, ‘In no time at all, you will be separated from your loved ones,So it is no good for you to put your trust in this compounded world;’And thus you show them how all beings are like a dream, an illusion, a mirage,And impermanent, unstable, and momentary. 1.49 “The physical activity of the Blissful One knows no bounds or borders;The domains of your verbal and mental activity are also unfathomable.

Are you free from any misfortune andagitation? Are you enjoying good health and well-being?” 1.55 They also said, “Hearers of the Blessed One, behold how delightful the world has become.” When the bodhisattvas and great hearers here in the Sahā world [F.220.b] saw the great display ofmansions that pervaded this entire world, as well as its many riches, they were amazed and thoughtto themselves, “Is it due to the power of the Thus-Gone One, or is it due to the power of thesebodhisattva great beings, that all of this has arrived here from the world of Sukhāvatī?” 1.56 At that point, inspired by the Buddha, the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha asked theBlessed One, “Blessed One, all these many mansions that now fill up and adorn this Sahā world areamazing! Blissful One, they are truly amazing! Did all of this arrive here in the Sahā world from theworld of Sukhāvatī due to the power of the Thus-Gone One or due to the power of thesebodhisattvas?” The Blessed One answered the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha, “Padmaśrīgarbha, thatthese many jewel mansions now fill up and adorn this Sahā world is not due to the power of theThus-Gone One. Rather, it is due to the power of the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and thebodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmprāpta.” 1.57 Padmaśrīgarbha exclaimed, “Because of their power, this Sahā world is now filled and adornedwith these many jewel mansions. The perfection of the aspirations and roots of virtue of these twoholy beings is inconceivable! Blessed One, it is amazing! Blissful One, it is truly amazing!” Page 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Blessed One said, [F.221.a] “Padmaśrīgarbha, it is just as you say. For innumerable trillionsof eons, these two holy beings have perfected the roots of virtue. Padmaśrīgarbha, these two holybeings have attained the illusory absorption. As they abide within the illusory absorption, they candemonstrate such miraculous emanations. Padmaśrīgarbha, when you look toward the east, what doyou see?” 1.58 When the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha looked toward the east with the unobscureddivine eye of a bodhisattva, he saw as many buddha realms as there are grains of sand in the riverGanges, with as many blessed buddhas as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. At the feet ofall of those blessed buddhas were the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattvagreat being Mahāsthāmprāpta, prostrating and inquiring about their health, saying, “The BlessedOne, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha Amitābha is asking if the Blessed One is ingood health. Are you free from any misfortune and agitation? Are you enjoying good health andwell-being?” 1.59 The same thing occurred in the south, in the west, in the north, below, above, and in all the tendirections. In all directions Padmaśrīgarbha saw as many buddha realms as there are grains of sandin the Ganges River, filled with and adorned by a great display of mansions made of variousprecious substances. In all those buddha realms he saw blessed buddhas, and he witnessed the twoholy beings prostrating before all those blessed buddhas. As he saw this, he was filled with greatwonder. The bodhisattva great being [F.221.b] Padmaśrīgarbha was amazed, and exclaimed to the BlessedOne, “The accomplishment of the illusory absorption by these two holy beings is inconceivable!Blessed One, it is amazing! Blissful One, it is truly amazing! Why do I say so? Because these twoholy beings abide in that absorption, and thus are present in all buddha realms.” 1.60 The Blessed One then produced a miraculous display so that the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbhacould see the buddha realms in all ten directions. He could also behold blessed buddhas in thosebuddha realms, and he saw how the two holy beings prostrated at the feet of the blessed ones. In asimilar way, the entire retinue present could see the buddha realms in all ten directions, behold theblessed buddhas in those buddha realms, and see the two holy beings prostrated at the feet of theblessed ones. Witnessing this, thirty-two thousand beings in the retinue of the Blessed Onedeveloped the mind set on unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. Such were the miraclesthat the Blessed One produced. 1.61 Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, from which thus-gone one did these two holy beings develop the mind set on unsurpassed and completely perfectawakening? And how long ago was that? What was his name? Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy,completely perfect Buddha, please tell us!” The Blessed One replied, “It is thus that other bodhisattvas, too, should perfect their conduct,actions, and aspirations. [F.222.a] Therefore, Padmaśrīgarbha, listen very well and keep in mindwhat I will now explain.” The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha said, “Blessed One, excellent!” and he listened as the BlessedOne had advised. Page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"1.62 The Blessed One continued, “Padmaśrīgarbha, previously, in times past, an inconceivable numberof eons ago, an endless number of eons ago, at a time stretching further back than any number ofeons, a number of eons so great that the number of atoms found in 100,000 worlds—all the limitlessand inconceivable number of such atoms—would not equal the number of eons, there was a worldcalled Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness. In that worldwas a blessed, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect buddha who had perfect knowledge andconduct. He was a blissful one who knew the world, an unsurpassed charioteer who trained beings,and a teacher of gods and men. His name was Blessed Buddha King of the Golden-Hued Lion’sPlay. 1.63 “Padmaśrīgarbha, in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfectBuddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, there was a display of precious qualities. I will onlygive you a mere illustration of this, just to mention a few of the qualities, so listen. Padmaśrīgarbha,tell me, are there many displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, Amitābha?” Padmaśrīgarbha replied, “Blessed One, there are indeed—inconceivably many. They arelimitless, and it would not be easy to describe them in words.” 1.64 The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, consider this analogy. Imagine a person splits the tip ofa hair into one hundred pieces, and then uses the tip of one of those pieces to lift up one drop ofwater from the ocean. [F.222.b] Tell me now, Padmaśrīgarbha, which would be greater, the amountof water that has been extracted or the water that remains?” Padmaśrīgarbha replied, “Blessed One, the extracted water would be less. The amount remainingis measureless.” 1.65 The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, think about this and understand it. The amount of waterextracted from the ocean in a single drop by that person using a hundredth of a hair tip representsthe displays of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy,completely perfect Buddha Amitābha, while the body of water remaining in the ocean represents thedisplays of precious qualities in Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display ofHappiness, the buddha realm of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha,King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play. 1.66 “His saṅgha of hearers was also endless. Right now the Thus-Gone Amitābha’s saṅgha of hearersis said to be boundless, but the saṅgha of hearers belonging to the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy,completely perfect Buddha, King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, was a hundred thousand timeslarger than that. His saṅgha of bodhisattvas was also of comparable size. That blessed, thus-goneone taught the Dharma exclusively within the three vehicles. Padmaśrīgarbha, even if I had as manyeons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River to describe the display of precious qualities inthe buddha realm of the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of theGolden-Hued Lion’s Play, as well as the display of qualities of his hearers and the causes for theirhappiness, I would not run out of things to say, and I would be unable to complete my description ofthe display of qualities in that buddha realm. 1.67 “Padmaśrīgarbha, [F.223.a] back then, during the life of the blessed Thus-Gone One, King of theGolden-Hued Lion’s Play, there was a virtuous and religious king who ruled over a thousandworlds. He was known as Glorious Splendor. Padmaśrīgarbha, King Glorious Splendor had onePage 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"billion sons. All the young princes had the twenty-eight marks of a great being, and all of them hadgenuinely attained unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening. Padmaśrīgarbha, King GloriousSplendor also had seventy-six thousand pleasure groves for his enjoyment, while each of his sonshad ten thousand pleasure groves.” 1.68 Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, were there nowomen in that buddha realm?” The Blessed One answered, “No, Padmaśrīgarbha, there were not. In that buddha realm not eventhe word ‘woman’ was heard. All those young princes had been born out of chastity. They were allborn in a miraculous manner. All those beings sustained themselves on the joy of concentration andthe joy of the Dharma, and in that buddha realm there was no gross type of food. Padmaśrīgarbha,King Glorious Splendor had no formal duties, so together with his sons he worshipped the BlessedOne for 840 trillion years. That Blessed, Thus-Gone One knew the king’s good intentions, so hetaught him how to gain expertise in the mode of Dharma known as the boundless seal. 1.69 “Padmaśrīgarbha, you may wonder what that ‘expertise in the mode of Dharma known as theboundless seal’ might be. Well, Padmaśrīgarbha, it is that bodhisattva great beings never fail tostrive for boundless activities. [F.223.b] They never fail to undertake boundless efforts. And why?Because those bodhisattvas’ generosity is boundless. Their discipline is boundless. Their patience isboundless. Their diligence is boundless. Their concentration is boundless. Their knowledge isboundless. Their embrace of saṃsāra is boundless. Their love for beings is boundless. Their displayof realms is boundless. Their hearers are boundless. Their perfect forms are boundless. Their voicesare boundless. Their eloquence is boundless. 1.70 “Padmaśrīgarbha, bodhisattvas will dedicate any root of virtue that has been created, even asingle instance of the thought of awakening, so that it becomes boundless. You may wonder howdedication can make it boundless. Well, at the time a bodhisattva dedicates that root of merit to allsentient beings, the non-birth of all those sentient beings is actualized, and it is through his passinginto the parinirvāṇa of a buddha that they will pass into parinirvāṇa. That, son of noble family, iscalled boundless dedication. 1.71 “Their emptiness is boundless. Their signlessness is boundless. Their wishlessness is boundless.Their lack of conditioned existence is boundless. In this way they are free from desire and liberatedwithin the realm of phenomena, the limit of reality. They are unborn, serene, free, beyond suffering,and boundless. Son of noble family, in short, all phenomena are boundless. Therefore allphenomena are said to be unborn and unceasing. Whatever is unborn and unceasing is boundless. 1.72 “Padmaśrīgarbha, the Blessed One, thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha, King of theGolden-Hued Lion’s Play, taught King Glorious Splendor perfectly how to gain expertise in themode of Dharma known as the boundless seal, so that he, too, could reflect on the boundlessDharma. Then, as King Glorious Splendor received the teaching on the boundless Dharma from thatblessed one, [F.224.a] he was satisfied and pleased. He rejoiced and was extremely delighted. Sincehe was so joyful and happy, together with his sons he praised that blessed one with these verses: 1.73 “ ‘Guide, you are the master of all dharmas.You conquer the hordes of theoreticians;Page 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"You eliminate all of the demons’ disputes and disturbing emotions.We prostrate to you, incomparable ocean of wisdom. 1.74 “ ‘The sun, the moon, and the light of fires,The radiance of Śakra, Brahmā, jewels, and lightning,Are eclipsed by the splendor of the blissful one.We prostrate to you, luminous leader of men. 1.75 “ ‘Sage, throughout an ocean of eons,You perform many hardships.Since the result of that activity is so beautiful,Beings never tire of beholding you. 1.76 “ ‘Seeing that beings are pained by many sufferings,And tormented by birth, old age, sickness, and death,Great sage, your compassion for themWill never change as you teach the Dharma of peace. 1.77 “ ‘You are like a physician for all beings in the three existences;You purify all attachment, anger, and darkness.Dharma physician, you develop compassionAnd teach on the unsurpassed state of peace. 1.78 “ ‘You know well all beings’ actions.Since you understand everyone in the infinite worlds,You teach the Dharma that brings themTo supreme nirvāṇa. 1.79 “ ‘Supreme man, your compassion is suchThat it is a compassion unrivaledBy all hearers and conditioned sagesIn all the infinite worlds. 1.80 “ ‘A gathering of merit endowed with the supreme marks,The body of the Victor is like a golden mountain,More splendorous than ten million suns.We prostrate to you, unrivaled perfect man. 1.81 “ ‘When from the expansive cloud of Dharma5 the rain of teachings falls,Those who have the vast inclinations to be within its scope,And were not intimidated by the acts of previous buddhas,Always find themselves before the blissful one. 1.82 “ ‘During an inconceivable number of trillions of eons,It is exceedingly difficult to behold the perfect man.Yet through the workings of merit the mind is purified [F.224.b] Page 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"And the guides become visible. 1.83 “ ‘The bodies of the Victor fill the entire realm of phenomena And are present in all infinite realms.They know no actual coming or going,And yet fill the world like a vessel. 1.84 “ ‘You who see the truths and teach the ultimate,You are a benefactor of the Dharma with a peaceful mind;Having crossed over, you liberate others who were in bondage.We prostrate to you, Blissful One. 1.85 “ ‘You have pulled out the tree of rebirth by its root;You have reduced to rubble the massive mountain of pride;You know no agitation and are beyond deceit and deception.We prostrate to you, who are completely at peace. 1.86 “ ‘Perfect man, you have gone beyond all attachments,And your realization is like earth, water, and fire.Victor, you are impartial toward all beings.We prostrate to you, who are like wind and space. 1.87 “ ‘Great sage, your qualities are like a treasure;Your body appears from an ocean of merit.Even if we had billions of eons to speak of themWe would be unable to exhaust the ocean of your qualities. 1.88 “ ‘Gods and men worship your ocean of qualities,And I with my sons offer worship as well.By whatever merit accrues from worshipping the Victor,May we become a great sage like you!’ 1.89 “Padmaśrīgarbha, on another occasion King Glorious Splendor was in his pleasure grovepracticing concentration, when two beautiful and captivating lotus flowers made of uragasārasandalwood sprang up on either side of him. From those two lotus flowers, two beings miraculouslyappeared; one bore the name Precious Mind, and the other was called Perfect Wealth. They satcross-legged in the flowers. 1.90 “Padmaśrīgarbha, when King Glorious Splendor arose from his absorption, he saw those twobeings sitting there, cross-legged, and at the sight he spoke this verse:“ ‘Are the two of you gods or nāgas?Or yakṣas, gandharvas, or kiṃnaras?Or humans or nonhumans?Friends, please answer this question.’ Page 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"1.91 “Padmaśrīgarbha, [F.225.a] the being who had appeared on King Glorious Splendor’s rightreplied with these verses to King Glorious Splendor: “ ‘My friend, all phenomena are empty,So why do you ask their names?Since all phenomena are devoid of names,What name are you asking for? 1.92 “ ‘In emptiness, there are no gods,No nāgas or rākṣasas,Nor any humans or nonhumans.None of them exist within emptiness.’ 1.93 “Padmaśrīgarbha, the other being then spoke to King Glorious Splendor in these verses:“ ‘Name is empty of name;In names there are no names.All phenomena are devoid of names,And still they are described using names. 1.94 “ ‘Whatever nature a name might haveIt cannot be seen or heard,And no action can bring it to an end,So what name are you asking for?6 1.95 “ ‘Conventionally names are formed,And names are given and spoken.Thus, my name is Precious Mind,And he is Perfect Wealth.’ 1.96 “Padmaśrīgarbha, once these two beings had spoken these verses, the king attained the five typesof clairvoyance. Together with King Glorious Splendor, the two beings then went before theBlessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddha King of the Golden-Hued Lion’sPlay. They prostrated with their heads to the blessed one’s feet, circumambulated the blessed onethree times, joined the palms of their hands together, and stood to one side.

And why?Because at that time, at that point, the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfectPage 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Buddha Amitābha was named King Glorious Splendor. Padmaśrīgarbha, you should also not thinkthat at that time, at that point, the two beings called Precious Mind and Perfect Wealth wereanybody else. And why?

Son of noble family, this was the first timethat these two beings developed the mind set upon unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening.” 1.117 Then the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, it isamazing how these two holy beings, devoting themselves so much to the profound and withoutapprehending their own names, have both been developing the mind of awakening for so long! Howmany other blessed buddhas apart from that thus-gone one have these two holy beings served?” The Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, it may be possible to count the number of grains ofsand in the Ganges River. [F.226.b] But it is not possible to count the blessed buddhas who werevenerated by those two holy beings since the time of that thus-gone one. That is how long these twohave been developing the mind of awakening. Those two holy beings wear inconceivable armor andpossess boundless skills. In fact it is impossible to comprehend the scope of those two beings’qualities.” 1.118 Then the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “From here, in whichdirection is that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display ofHappiness where the Blessed One, the thus-gone King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play lived?” The Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, at that time, at that point, the world of Sukhāvatī inthe west was that world called Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display ofHappiness.” 1.119 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, “Please tell us what kind ofdisplay of precious qualities the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, completely perfect Buddhamanifested in the buddha realm of those two holy beings in order to aid many beings, show love forthe world, and bring happiness and health to all, including gods and men. How were his perfecthearers? How long did they live? What kind of enjoyments did they have? What was their radiancelike? And what were the names of the two holy beings after they awakened to unexcelled andcompletely perfect buddhahood? Why, you may wonder, am I making this request? It is so thatother bodhisattvas may hear the Thus-Gone One describe the great aspirations of those two holybeings, [F.227.a] so that they, too, may perfect similar great aspirations.” 1.120 The Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, the extent of the thus-gone one Amitābha’s life isboundless. Even if you had a trillion eons to describe its limits, it would not be easy. Son of noblefamily, although the life of the thus-gone one Amitābha is boundless, all compounded phenomenaare empty, unstable, without solidity, and fleeting. Therefore, son of noble family, in a distant futurethe Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect Buddha Amitābha will also pass into nirvāṇa.Though he will pass into nirvāṇa, his sacred Dharma will remain for 84 trillion eons. Just as whenhe was alive, his passing into nirvāṇa will also accomplish sentient beings’ roots of virtue to theirfull extent. 1.121 “At that point, however, other sentient beings will no longer behold that thus-gone one. Yet thePage 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"bodhisattvas will obtain the absorption of remembering the Buddha. They will always andcontinuously behold the Buddha and not be separate from him. Son of noble family, when Amitābhapasses into nirvāṇa, lotus flowers and trees made of the seven gems will emit several hundred Gatesof Dharma similar to the Dharma teachings that the thus-gone one taught. 1.122 “Son of noble family, after the Thus-Gone One Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa, there willcome a night when the sacred Dharma disappears. As soon as that happens, at the break of dawn onthe very next day, [F.227.b] the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara will awaken to unsurpassedand perfect buddhahood at the foot of a bodhi tree made of various gems. As he perfectly andcompletely awakens, he will be known as Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja. The preciousqualities displayed in the buddha realm of the Thus-Gone OneSamanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja will be so extensive that even a thus-gone one who isotherwise able to recount how many grains of sand there are in the river Ganges will not be able tobe comprehend them. There are so many causes for happiness and the precious qualities found inthat buddha realm, but, son of noble family, let me just give you a brief illustration of their number. 1.123 “The display of precious qualities in the buddha realm of the Blessed One, the thus-gone King ofthe Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, which I described before, would not equal even one hundredth of thisdisplay of qualities. Nor would it measure one thousandth, or ever one hundred thousandth of it. Infact no number, example, or illustration would suffice. In this buddha realm even the names ofhearers and solitary buddhas do not exist. This buddha realm is entirely filled with bodhisattvas. Sonof noble family, even if one were to gather all of the hearers, solitary buddhas, and bodhisattvas ofthe Blessed Amitābha, they would not equal even one hundredth of the bodhisattva saṅgha of theBlessed One, the thus-gone one Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja. Nor would they measureone thousandth, or even one hundred thousandth of that. In fact no number, analogy, or illustrationwould suffice. As for his lifespan, it will be 96 trillion eons. The sacred Dharma that he teaches willremain for 630 million eons.” 1.124 The bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha said to the Blessed One, [F.228.a] “Blessed One,will the name of that world also be Sukhāvatī?” The Blessed One said, “No, son of noble family, it will not. That world will be called CompleteGathering of Wealth. Son of noble family, during the lifetime ofSamanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja, until he passes into nirvāṇa, he will be worshipped by thebodhisattva Mahāsthāmprāpta. After he passes into nirvāṇa, that bodhisattva will uphold his sacredDharma and propagate it, so that the sacred Dharma may remain for long. 1.125 \"Later, when the sacred Dharma has disappeared in that buddha realm, Mahāsthāmprāpta willawaken there to unsurpassed and perfect buddhahood. He will appear in that world as a thus-gone,worthy, perfect buddha, a learned and virtuous being, a blissful one, someone who knows the world,an unsurpassed charioteer who tames beings, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed buddha known asSupra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja. Just as were the perfect bodhisattvas and the perfectenvironment belonging to the Blessed One, the thus-gone, worthy, perfect BuddhaSamanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja, so will they be, precisely and without any difference, forthe Blessed One, the thus-gone Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja. His lifespan and the period ofhis sacred Dharma will also be the same.

[F.228.b] “Padmaśrīgarbha, any woman who hears the account of how the Blessed One, the thus-gone Kingof the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, passed into nirvāṇa, and who hears the name of these two futurebuddhas, will no longer have the identity of a woman, and after 400 million eons she will destroysaṃsāra. She will render irreversible her progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. She willalways see the Buddha, listen to the Dharma, and serve the Saṅgha; and as she moves to the nextlife, she will take ordination. She will recollect her past lives and attain unimpeded eloquence andretention.” 1.127 Then, from within the retinue, 960 million gods, men, and other beings called out in a singlevoice, “We pay homage to all thus-gone ones: those yet to come, those who presently remain, andthose in the ten directions who have passed into nirvāṇa. We rejoice in their names!” And theycontinued, “Blessed One, this entire gathering now engenders the mind of unsurpassed and perfectawakening.” Then the Blessed One prophesied their unsurpassed and perfect awakening. Eight trillion fourhundred thousand million beings purified their eye of Dharma regarding phenomena so that itbecame stainless and unobscured. Seven thousand monks freed their minds from defilementswithout further clinging. 1.128 Then, at that time, the bodhisattva great being Avalokiteśvara and the bodhisattva great beingMahāsthāmprāpta caused a miracle by which the entire retinue could see all the limitless,uncountable blessed ones in the ten directions making prophecies for their unsurpassed and perfectawakening. [F.229.a] Such was the miracle that they performed. At this spectacle, everyone present exclaimed, “Blessed One, we now see the extent to whichthese two bodhisattva great beings are cared for by those blessed buddhas! It is amazing to see somany blessed buddhas making prophecies regarding these two holy beings!” 1.129 Then the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how much merit iscreated when a son or daughter of noble family remembers this sūtra taught by the Thus-Gone One,carries it, reads it, comprehends it, and extensively and genuinely teaches it to others?” The Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, it could be asked what would be accomplished andwhat would be the reason for me to reply to the question you have put to the Thus-Gone One. Sonof noble family, it is because base sentient beings may distrust the Thus-Gone One’s teachings, andwill therefore continue to meet with harm, unhelpful situations, unhappiness, and misfortune.” 1.130 Padmaśrīgarbha said, “Blessed One, in this assembly there are sons and daughters of noble familywho are dedicated to the vast, indeed extremely dedicated; this teaching will also appear to beingsyet to come. So it is for the sake of the welfare and happiness of many beings that I request theThus-Gone One to explain.” The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, that being so, I ask you to listen well to what I will sayand keep it in mind.” The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha said, “Blessed One, excellent!” and he listened as the BlessedPage 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"One had instructed him. 1.131 Then the Blessed One said, “Son of noble family, say there is a man who is strong, powerful, andwith great amounts of merit. Now, however many beings one may think there are in what one thinksof as the realm of beings, the Thus-Gone One has said that there are many more than that; [F.229.b]it is not like the realm of the earth. All those beings that person supports with his head, shoulders, orhands for limitless tens of millions of eons. For as long as he lives, he offers them clothing andfood, and provides them with all types of pleasant provisions and services.7 Now tell me,Padmaśrīgarbha, would that man’s merit increase greatly on this basis?” 1.132 Padmaśrīgarbha said, “A lot of merit is created when just a single person develops a lovingattitude, even if only for as long as it takes him to snap his fingers. So how much more would becreated if someone embraces all beings with love and serves them with all necessities for theirhappiness for endless, limitless, tens of millions of eons?” The Blessed One said, “Padmaśrīgarbha, you should be inspired by this, and you should fullyunderstand it: any son or daughter of noble family who, immersed in faith and full of interest,develops the mind of awakening based on a sūtra that the Thus-Gone One has taught, like this one,and takes hold of the sūtra, remembers it, reads it, understands it, and teaches it extensively to otherswill, based on that foundation, give rise to a much greater amount of merit.” 1.133 The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha declared to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, when the Thus-Gone One has passed into nirvāṇa, I will take hold of this sūtra, which has been taught by the Thus-Gone One, and grasp it, read it, understand it, and teach it extensively to others.” The bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha and the 960 million bodhisattvas then all declared, in a singlevoice, “Blessed One, we too will take hold of this sūtra and grasp it, read it, understand it, [F.230.a]and teach it extensively to others.” 1.134 The Blessed One said to the bodhisattva Padmaśrīgarbha, “Padmaśrīgarbha, if any woman hearsthis Dharma teaching, she will immediately be transformed from the state of a woman, unless thereare the two causative factors, jealousy and stinginess.” Then Śakra, who is lord of the gods, Brahmā, who rules the Sahā world, the four great kings, andmany hundreds of thousands of gods scattered divine māndārava flowers on the Blessed One andthe bodhisattva great beings. While playing billions of divine instruments, they called out, “Thosesentient beings who hear this Dharma teaching, grasp it, and teach it extensively to others will reapa great profit.” The Blessed One said, “Sons of noble family, what you have said is true. Any sentient being whoholds this Dharma teaching in his hands or hears it, and subsequently feels devotion for it, will giverise to roots of virtue before ten thousand buddhas.” 1.135 Then a young girl named Viraja rose from her seat in the congregation and, motivated byaltruistic thoughts, announced, “Blessed One, with an altruistic motivation I have decided to give upany jealousy and stinginess, and instead develop the mind of unsurpassed and perfect awakening.Blessed Thus-Gone One, you speak the truth. Blessed One, if it is so that were I to become aBuddha, and other women should happen to hear this Dharma teaching, they will also be freed frombeing a woman as soon as they hear it, to that end, Blessed One, may all my woman’s organs nowPage 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"disappear from my body, and those of a man appear!” [F.230.b] 1.136 Instantly the girl’s female organs vanished, and her body became that of a man, of whom theBlessed One prophesied that his progress to unsurpassed and perfect awakening had now beenrendered irreversible, and that he would become a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddhanamed Repeller of All Disturbing Emotions. When the Blessed One had spoken this teaching, the bodhisattva great being Padmaśrīgarbha, themonks, and the many bodhisattvas, as well as the world with its gods, men, demigods, andgandharvas, rejoiced and praised what the Blessed One had said.
