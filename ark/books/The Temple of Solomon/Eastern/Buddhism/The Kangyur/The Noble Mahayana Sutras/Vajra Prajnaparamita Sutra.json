If one does not dwell in dharmas, he dwells in praj¤ à pàramità.Ÿ That is why every one of the Great Praj¤à assemblies begins with an explanation of “not dwelling.ŸThat Såtra also says, “At that time the World Honored One, using Dharmas which were not witticisms, discussed the marks of the Tathàgata. For the sake of all Bodhi-sattvas he proclaimed praj¤à, the profound principle and tendency of the Dharma door of the word ‘wheel’ saying, ‘All dharmas are devoid of marks because they are apart from the many marks. All dharmas are wishless, because they are without seeking. All dharmas are still, because they are eternally quiescent. All dharmas are impermanent, because they are without a permanent nature. All dharmas are without bliss, because there is nothing which can be blissful. All dharmas are without self, because they have no self-mastery.

All dharmas cannot"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiibe obtained, because in searching for their mark, it cannot be found.Ÿ That explains the principle and tendency of the emptiness of the nature.That Såtra also says, “At that time the World Honored One, further using the storehouse of those who dwell in and maintain the Dharma, discussed the marks of the Tathàgata. For the sake of all Bodhisattvas he proclaimed praj¤à, the total pervasiveness of sentient beings who dwell in and main-tain the Dharma, the profound principle and tendency of the supreme storehouse Dharma door, saying, ‘All sentient beings are the storehouse of the Tathàgata, because Samantabhadra Bodhisattva’s own substance is all-pervasive. All living beings are the storehouse of vajra, because they are anointed by the vajra-storehouse. All living beings are the storehouse of proper Dharma, because they rely on proper speech to bring about change. All living beings are the storehouse of won-derful karma, because in matters of karma they rely on the additional practices.’Ÿ The previous passage explained that existent dharmas are non-existent. This passage explains that non-existent dharmas are not non- existent. Non-existence and not non-existence is the principle and tendency of the Middle Way.In the past, five hundred bhikùus became doubtful and disbelieved when they heard the emptiness dharma of praj¤à. Arising from their seats, they departed. The Bodhi-sattva Net Brightness instructed the Brahmà God Beneficial Consideration to devise an expedient means to instruct them."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiiThe Brahmà God replied, “Even if they were allowed to depart for as many kalpas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River, they could not get out of this Dharma door. They are like a fool who, fearing emptiness, tries to walk away from emptiness. No matter where he goes, he does not leave emptiness behind. Those bhikùus are just like that. Although they may go a long way, they cannot leave the mark of emptiness.“They are also like a man who seeks emptiness. Racing east and west he says, ‘I want emptiness! I want emptiness!’ That man merely says the name of emptiness; he does not perceive emptiness. Those bhikùus are also like that. Desiring to attain nirvàõa, they practice in the midst of nirvàõa and do not attain it. For what reason? Nirvàõa is merely a name, and just like emptiness which is merely a name, it cannot be obtained.ŸWe who investigate the Buddha’s teaching should know that the Buddha’s teaching is the teaching of the Dharmarealm; it is not differentiated into national traditions. The Buddha’s teaching is the teaching of all people; it is not divided by regional interests. The Buddha’s teaching is the teaching of living beings; it is without racial prejudice. The Buddha said, “All living beings have the Buddha-nature. All can become Buddhas.Ÿ Whether you believe or not makes no difference because eventually you will come to believe.

Above all, translations of såtras must be certified as the authentic transmission of the Buddha’s Proper Dharma. This translation of A General Explanation of the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra by Tripiñaka Master Hs‚an Hua, done under the auspices of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, a body of more than thirty members of the Sa¤gha and scholars, and certified by the Venerable Master Hs‚an Hua, bears such author ity. It will be of interest to those concerned with the translation of the Buddhist Canon into the various languages of the world to review the procedure employed by the Buddhist Text Translation Society in the translations it undertakes.Eight regulations govern the conduct of Buddhist Text Translation Society translators. (1) A translator must free himself from the motives of personal fame and reputation. (2) A translator must cultivate an attitude free from arrogance and conceit. (3) A translator must refrain from aggrandizing himself and denigrating others. (4) A translator must not establish himself as the standard of correctness and suppress the work of others with his fault-finding. (5) A translator must take the Buddha-mind as his own mind. (6) A translator must use the wisdom of the Selective Dharma Eye to determine true principles. (7) A translator must request Elder Virtuous Ones from the ten directions to certify his translations. (8) A translator must endeavor to propagate the Teaching by print-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xviing såtras, vinaya texts, and ÷àstras when his translations are certified to be correct.The work of the Buddhist Text Translation Society is done by committees, four in number. (1) Primary Translation Committee; (2) Revisions Committee; (3) Editorial Com-mittee; and (4) Certification Board. Each person who works on a given såtra signs his name to it and accepts responsibility for its clarity and accuracy.øàkyamuni Buddha originally spoke the Vajra Såtra in India. When the Buddhadharma was transmitted to China, the Great Patriarchs certified translations into Chinese. The High Master Hs‚an Hua, Professor of the Tripiñaka (Tripiñakàcàr ya) and of the Dhyànas (Ch‘an Shih), is heir to that tradition. Based upon the Chinese texts, the Master publically lectures såtras, ÷àstras, and vinaya, and delivers his own oral commentary also in Chinese, which his disciples preserve on tape. The Buddhist Text Translation Society is primarily concerned with translating these works, and making the Master’s invaluable commentaries available to the world.A tape is first translated by a chief translator, a member of the Primary Translation Committee. He may rewrite or polish, but his primary responsibility is to render, as accurately as possible, what is on the tape into the language of transla-tion. He types his translation in triplicate, leaving ample room for subsequent correction on the typed sheets themselves. He signs and dates each copy, retaining one for the Primary Translation Committee, and handing the remaining two on"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviito the Revisions Committee. At that point his responsibility for the translation’s wording ends, although he will probably be consulted about changes and revisions in the subsequent work.The Revisions Committee also listens to the tape, and corrects or revises both copies of the rough draft identically. The work done by the Primary Translation Committee is not erased, for those who edit and review the work at a later date should be able to see quite clearly both the original transcript and the alternate versions. Each member of the committee who works on the såtra is responsible for its accuracy at that point. He indicates the date he received the drafts, how much work he did on them each day, and signs and dates the copies when he has finished. Of the two typed drafts; Revisions retains one copy and hands the other on to the Editorial Committee.The Editorial Committee also listens to the tape. It compares the rough draft version and the revisions made by the second committee, and decides upon a correct version. This committee is responsible for the såtra’s accuracy from that point on. The members of the Editorial Committee who work on a given translation also make the language readable, “increasing where deficient, and decreasing where excessive.Ÿ Their aim is not, however, literary brilliance which distracts the reader’s attention from the meaning of the text; the Editorial Committee works to make the principles of the Dharma very clear.

The members concerned sign and date each copy, retaining one for the Committee and handing two on to the Certification Board.The Venerable High Master Hs‚an Hua is Chairman of the Certification Board, as he is of the Buddhist Text Translation Society as a whole. As the Abbot of San Francisco’s Gold Mountain Dhyàna Monastery, the headquarters of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, and President of the International Institute for the Translation of Buddhist Texts, where much of the work of the Buddhist Text Translation Society is undertaken, he personally supervises the work of translation. The Master alone can certify that a given translation transmits the Mind-to-mind Seal Dharma handed down from øakyamuni Buddha through the Indian Patriarchs to the first Chinese Patriarch Bodhidharma, and in successive transmissions, on to modern times, when the Venerable High Master Hsu Yun, in the late 1940’s, transmitted that Dharma Treasury to the Venerable High Master Hs‚an Hua. Certification by the Venerable Master is, therefore, an essential step in preparing the authoritative translation of any work from the Buddhist Canon.The Master reviews the final version of all translated works with members of the Certification Board who are fluent both in Chinese and in the language of the translation. He points out any major mistakes, especially with regard to doc-trine. A text so certified is therefore true and actual Dharma, and tallies with the mind of all Buddhas. One may, in full confidence, rely upon it to cultivate."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xixThe Certification Board, having approved the final text, retains one typed copy and has the other sent for printing. The Editorial Committee checks proofs when they come back from the printer to see that they accord with the final rewrit-ing which the Certification Board author ized. In that way, all share the work and all share the responsibility.The members of the Buddhist Text Translation Society are all Buddhist disciples, hold at the very least the Five Lay Precepts, and have studied the Buddhadharma for many years. What is more they have put the Dharma into practice at every step of the way. All of the Sa¤gha members who are disciples of the Venerable Master observe the ascetic practices of eating only one meal a day at noon and of never lying down, and many of the laymen and laywomen also cultivate some of these practices. Some members have attained to advanced stages in meditation; others are very erudite and may have university degrees ranging up to a Ph.D.; others are single-mindedly mindful of the Buddha Amitàbha; while others specialize in uphold-ing the rules of conduct, or in the Secret School. All the Master’s disciples cultivate all five schools of practice in varying proportions. Trained by such a Master, vigorously cultivating in such a way, and with their lives devoted to the world-wide dissemination of the Buddhadharma, the members of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, through following the translation procedure outlined above, are able to guarantee the authenticity and accuracy of the texts they send to press."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xxThe committee members who particularly worked to translate A General Explanation of the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra by Tripiñaka Master Hs‚an Hua are as follows: (1) Primary Translation was done by Bhikùuõã Heng Ch’ih, whose skill as a translator is matched by her skill in medita-tion. A long-term disciple of the Venerable Master and one of the first group of five Americans to receive the full left-home precepts, Dharma Master Heng Ch’ih has been translating the Master’s Dharma now for many years. She is experienced in on-the-spot translation of the Master’s lectures, which are made every time the Master lectures publically, as well as in all aspects of translation from tapes and written works. She also helps put out the monthly Buddhist Journal Vajra Bodhi Sea, and both teaches and continues to study the Dharma at Gold Mountain Monastery in San Francisco. The Vajra Såtra is at the core of her personal practice of the Way, and so she has a clear understanding of its profound principles.Bhikùuõã Heng Ch’ih sat through the entire ninety-eight day Ch’an Meditation Session sponsored by the Sino-American Buddhist Association in 1970 -1971, another first in the West. This makes her eminently qualified to translate a såtra concerned with the very heart of meditational practice leading to Enlightenment. Above all, Bhikùuõã Heng Ch’ih is dedicated to the propagation of the Buddhadharma as embodied in the Master’s words. She has from the beginning faithfully followed the translation procedures which have been described, recognizing that translation must be a joint endeavor employing the talents and wisdom of more than just a few."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxi(2) Revision was done by Bhikùuõã Heng Yin, the first American woman to receive the full Bhikùuõã Precepts, and one of the Venerable Master’s first American disciples.

She already has many works of translation and origi-nal compositions to her credit, among them the translation of The Sixth Patriarch’s Dharma Jewel Platform Såtra and Commentary by Tripiñaka Master Hs‚an Hua, recently pub-lished by the Sino-American Buddhist Association under the auspices of Gold Mountain Dhyàna Monastery.(3) Editing was done by three committee members.

Dharma Master Hsien gives on-the-spot translations of the Master’s lectures, and is herself currently delivering a lecture series on the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Blossom Såtra, based on the Venerable Master’s commentary on that Såtra, for which she uses both the Chinese and Sanskrit texts in her preparation. Dharma Master Heng Hsien has been teaching Indian Civilization at U.C. Berkeley, and she also teaches various languages, including Sanskrit, at Gold Mountain Monastery.

The Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra belongs to the fourth, or praj¤à period, and among the first four teachings, it is the third, the specific teaching.The Great Praj¤à Såtra which contains what the Buddha said about praj¤à, comprises over 600 volumes of which the Vajra Såtra is just one. Praj¤à is important, as can be seen by the fact that the Buddha, having spoken praj¤ à for a full twenty years, declared that the Praj¤à Såtras would be disseminated to every land.Tr ipiñ a k a Ma s ter H s‚an Tsang, partially fulfilling that prediction, translated the Great Praj¤à Såtra from Sanskrit into Chinese in the T’ang Dynasty at Ta Hsing Shan Mon-astery with the aid of more than one thousand bhikùus and over two thousand laymen. Ta Hsing Shan was not a small place. From the Abbot’s room to the front gate was a distance of over three miles and the monk in charge of opening and shutting the front gate usually rode a horse in order to cover the distance in a reasonable length of time. Being so large, the monastery easily accommodated the three to four thousand people involved in the work of translation.During the year the Great Praj¤à Såtra was trans-lated, the peach trees blossomed six times. That auspicious"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28occurrence testified to the importance of the Praj¤à Såtra. It is also widely known that the flower spirits and the grass and tree spirits all came to protect the wonderful Dharma assembly.The opening lecture of the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra marks the beginning of another praj¤à assembly in America. The events which led to this assembly began in 1968 when a group of eager students from Seattle came to the Buddhist Lecture Hall in San Francisco to participate in the first official seven-day meditation session ever held in America, lasting daily from six in the morning to nine in the evening — al-though the participants found it rigorous, it was actually very expedient. Authentic dhyàna sessions start at 3 A.M. and run straight through to midnight.At that time those people made a good impression on me and it was clear that they could work within the discipline of the Buddhadharma. During that session they requested explanation of the øåraï gama Såtra. It is said,Dharma does not arise alone.Relying on conditions it is born.The Way is not practiced in vain.Meeting conditions there is a response.I met their request, and during the summer of 1968 the øåraï gama Såtra was lectured in its entirety. It was followed by the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Blossom Såtra.I have come to America to create High Masters, future Patriarchs, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. After hearing the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29øåraï gama Såtra, several Americans wish to leave the home life under me. To broaden their understanding of the Buddha-dharma and for the sake of all the other fruits of the Way which will follow them, I am lecturing the Dharma Blossom Såtra.On the anniversary of the day Avalokite÷vara Bodhi-sattva left the home life, several people requested an expla-nation of the Vajra Såtra. I consented and began to speak the Såtra in addition to the lectures on the Dharma Blossom Såtra.The explanation of the Vajra Såtra will be simplified by omitting the usual discussion of the Seven Types of Såtra Titles and the Five Profound Meanings. Let’s just open the door and look at the mountain. The work divides into three sections:1. General Explanation of the Title, (Chapter One);2. The Translator, (Chapter Two); and3. Detailed Explanation of the Text, (Chapter Three through Thirty-four).Vajra is a Sanskrit word which defies translation because of its numerous connotations, but essentially vajra is an inde-structible substance, usually represented by diamond. Vajra is here metaphorically extended to refer to the principles of this Discourse on Dharma. Vajra refers to the vajra heart, the vajra nature, and the vajra praj¤à. The vajra praj¤à is the vajra nature which in turn is the vajra praj¤à."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Vajra is identical with the self-nature, the essential life force of all living beings, because both are indestructible and adamantine. Furthermore, the eternally dwelling heart all beings have in common is the same as the vajra nature, since it too cannot be destroyed. Praj¤à, as the highest form of wisdom living beings can attain, is real mark praj¤à, eternally indestructible. It is therefore referred to as vajra praj¤à.According to the traditional explanations of the Seven Types of Såtra Titles, vajra in the title refers metaphorically to praj¤à, an essential Buddhist dharma. But more point-edly it may be said that praj¤à is vajra, the heart is vajra, the nature is vajra. To discriminate by way of analogy only serves to dull the brilliance of that splendid truth. Although dharmas may be used as figurative expressions of the one principle, as is here the case in speaking of the one principle as an indestructible vajra, originally and conclusively there is only one Dharma. Such divisions of the one principle are mere expedients which serve to accord with the various understandings of living beings. Divided we have the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra, united it is the Vajra Såtra. It could also be called the Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra. There is no need for rigid interpretation. The Vajra Såtra itself speaks of “no fixed dharmas.Ÿ If a person holds tightly to the view that one is one and two is two, the explanation of the principle becomes lifeless.Vajra is durable, luminous, and able to cut. The sub-stance of vajra is durable, able to destroy what nothing else can, and yet is itself indestructible. The substance of vajra"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31fully controls devious influences, including heavenly demons and outside ways.The light, which is the characteristic mark of vajra, has the power to break up all darkness, yet protects itself from all destruction. Light dawns when darkness is destroyed. In protecting the faultless dharma, vajra eradicates all that is di-vergent and perverted. When deviant dharmas are allowed to persist in the world, then darkness flourishes. When deviant dharmas are destroyed, the faultless proper dharma shines forth more brightly to abide far longer in the world.As light is the characteristic mark of vajra, cutting is its function. Vajra can cut like the keen blade of a knife. Cutting metal, carving jade, slicing through steel as if slicing through mud — that is the power of vajra. Such sharpness pierces all obstructions and controls all deviations. Nothing can defeat it.The heart which is vajra does not refer to the heart within the breast. That heart is flesh and has very little use when compared to the vajra heart.The heart of vajra is also not the false-thinking heart, the sixth mind consciousness. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind each have a consciousness:Eyes have eye-consciousness,ears have ear-consciousness,the nose has nose-consciousness,the tongue has tongue-consciousness,the body has body-consciousness,and the mind has mind-consciousness."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32Common people, whose awareness does not penetrate beyond the sixth mind-consciousness, consider the flesh heart to be their true heart. That is the first mistake. The second mistake is thinking that their fa lse-thinking heart is also their true heart, as ânanda did in the øåraï gama Såtra.“The Buddha told ânanda, ‘That is not your heart. It is the dust (objects) before you, the empty false marks of thought which delude your true nature. Because of this, from beginningless time right up to your present life, you have taken a thief as your son, lost your original source, and thereby undergo the turning of the wheel.’ŸThis passage from the øåraï gama Såtra is very important. It speaks of the sixth mind-consciousness which has an ex-ceptional talent for preoccupying itself with trivial and incon-sequential thoughts. Those false thoughts that are produced send the sixth consciousness-mind suddenly east, west, north, south; suddenly up, suddenly down. One need not sit in a rocket in order to go to the moon; the mind just gives rise to the thought, “Ah, the moon...Ÿ and instantly one is there. A single false thought sends one straight to India, a single false thought and one is off to China. One produces a false thought and the streets of Japan are right before one’s eyes. The same is true of Germany, France or anywhere one has been; a single false thought and one is there again.ânanda thought the false-thinking heart was the real heart. The Buddha told ânanda, “That is not your heart."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33What is it? It is just the empty false appearance of dust objects before you. Those appearances manifest from your false thinking and delude your true nature. From beginningless kalpas until now you have always taken that for your heart. To do so is like thinking a thief is your son, and it makes you lose the knowledge of your eternal source. That source is the eternally indestructible precious nature, the enlightened bright heart. For that reason you appear and disappear endlessly in the six paths of the turning wheel.ŸThe third heart is the true suchness heart which is real mark praj¤à. The true suchness heart is so great there is nothing beyond it, and so small there is nothing within it. One will find nothing smaller or larger than true suchness. The true suchness heart is the vajra heart, the real nature of every one of us.Praj¤àGreen bamboo... yellow flowers —Everything is praj¤à.The Sanskrit word praj¤à is included among the Five Kinds of Terms Not Translated which were established by Dharma Master Hs‚an Tsang in the T’ang Dynasty.

Within those Ten Categories are con-tained a total of 701 volumes of Praj¤à Såtras.An investigation of Dharma should include considera-tion of the places in which the Buddha spoke Dharma and the number of assemblies that received the teaching. The praj¤à teaching was spoken in Four Places at Sixteen As-semblies:1. Seven assemblies were held on Vulture Peak, also called Efficacious Vulture Mountain, near the city House of Kings.2. Seven assemblies were held in the city of øràvastã in the Jeta Grove in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the Solitary. That is where the Vajra Såtra was spoken.3. One assembly was held in the Maõi Jewel Treasury Palace of the Bliss From Others’ Transformations Heaven.4. One assembly was held beside the White Heron Pool in the Bamboo Forest Park near the House of Kings."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36The Vajra Praj ¤ à Pàramità Såtra was spoken at the third assembly held at the second location, the Jeta Grove. So the Såtra begins, “Thus I have heard at one time the Buddha was staying in øràvastã in the Jeta Grove in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the Solitary.ŸOf the Three Kinds of Praj¤à — literary, contemplative, and real mark — literary praj¤à arises from the study of Såtras, but a true understanding of the literature only comes through contemplative praj¤à. Contemplative wisdom, fully developed, penetrates the final goal: real mark praj¤à. If praj¤à does not manifest, it is simply an indication that the basic wisdom inher-ent in all people has not been brought to fruition. The wisdom which is real mark praj¤à arises only when nourished by the waters of literary and contemplative praj¤à.Pàramità. Some say it is as sweet as pineapple.1 Not only that, it is the sweetest of sweets. It is separation from suf-fering and attainment of bliss. When ever a task is well done the people of India say it is “pàramità,Ÿ just as we would say it is “finished.Ÿ But pàramità means more than just finished, it means the task has been perfectly accomplished.Pàramità means “arrived at the other shore.Ÿ If you, take a bridge or ferry from San Francisco to Oakland, your promotion from elementary school is “pàramità.Ÿ Obtaining arrival in Oakland is “pàramità.Ÿ Receiving a certificate of 1.

This is also “pàramità.ŸEverything can be “pàramità-ed.Ÿ For example, a person takes up the practice of dhyàna meditation. The day that person opens enlightenment will be the day of pàramità. The øåraï gama Såtra Lecture and Cultivation Session in the summer of 1968 was another example. The day it began was “this shore.Ÿ One hundred and six days later was Mahàpraj¤àpàramità. In general, any job done well and done completely is called pàramità.Now we are all studying Buddhadharma. In the begin-ning it is difficult to understand, and so some people come to the Lecture Hall once and do not dare to return, fearing the extreme difficulty in practice. One first needs good roots and then one needs patience. Those who remain to cultivate come to realize that the Buddhadharma is the most important thing in the world. “If I don’t understand the Buddhadharma it is as if I haven’t eaten enough. I must hear the Såtras and listen to the Dharma. It is more delicious than the finest food in the best restaurant.Ÿ If listening to Såtras can be put in place of one’s heart’s delight, then, when one has attentively listened to the entire Såtra, that too is pàramità.Såtra.

One who wishes to walk that road must rely on the Dharma to cultivate. The Dharma is in the Såtras.The word Såtra has many meanings.1. It is called “an emanationŸ because it comes from the Buddha’s mouth.2. Såtra is also called “a bright revelationŸ because it can illumine the whole world with its light.3. Såtra is also called “a constantŸ because it is a method which never changes. Whether in the past or in the present, the Såtra remains the same. Not one word can be taken out, not one added. It neither increases nor decreases.4. The Såtra “strings together.Ÿ Like beads on a string, the principles of the Buddhadharma are linked together in the lines of the Såtra from beginning to end.5. The Såtra “attractsŸ living beings in the same way that a magnet draws iron filings. Living beings drawn to the Såtras come to have a thorough understanding of the Buddhadharma.6. The Såtra is a “methodŸ of cultivation held in ven-eration by living beings in the past, present, and future.7. Såtra is also called a “bubbling spring.Ÿ The prin-ciples flow from the Såtras like water from a bubbling spring which moistens the entire earth, causing all living beings to be filled with the joy of Dharma and to obtain delightful dhyàna food. The complete title of the Såtra is the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39Preface:The TranslatorTranslated by Tripiñaka Dharma Master Kumàrajãva during the Yao Ch’in Dynasty.1. In the Yao Chin period, Tripiñaka Master Kumàrajãva translated the Såtra, giving it the title Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra. In later times the Såtra came to be translated by five other Dharma Masters.2. Dharma Master Bodhiruci translated it in the Y‚an Wei period and used the same title as Kumàrajãva.3. Dharma Master Paramàrtha translated the Såtra in the later Ch’en Dynasty also under the same title.4. In the Sui Dynasty, Dharma Master Upagupta translated the Såtra under a different title. He added the word “cutting,Ÿ calling it the Cutting-Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra.5. In the Tang Dynasty during the 19th year of the reign period Chen Kuan, Dharma Master Hs‚an Tsang trans-lated the Såtra, reversing Upagupta’s title slightly and calling it the Vajra Which Can Cut Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra. Dharma Master Hs‚an Tsang was a great, virtuous, high monk who walked from China to India via Siberia in order to study the Såtras.

His translation of the Såtra bore the same title as that by Dharma Master Hs‚an Tsang.Of those six translations, Dharma Master Kumàrajãva’s is considered the finest. It was Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an who discovered the reason Master Kumàrajãva’s translations are the ones people most like to read and recite. Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an especially cultivated the precepts and rules. In the Four Great Deportments — walking, standing, sitting, and lying down — he was extremely proper. As is said in the øåraï gama Såtra,“He rigorously regulated his demeanor out of stern respect for the pure Dharma.Ÿ Such deportment commands the respect of ghosts and spirits as well as that of men and gods. Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an was a model for all to follow.The four Great Deportments refer to walking, stand-ing, sitting, and lying down. Walk like the wind. That does not mean like a gale which tears down mountains, uproots trees, and blows over houses. It means like a gentle breeze. Stand like a pine. Sit like a bell. That does not mean like the bell’s clapper — always swaying to and fro. Sit like the ancient bells which were made so heavy nothing could move them. Then one has sufficient samàdhi power. Lie like a bow. That is called “lucky lying down.Ÿ Put your right hand under your right cheek, and your left hand on your left thigh. øàkyamuni Buddha entered nirvàõa in the “lucky lying downŸ posture."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41In response to Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an’s superb cultivation of the Three-Thousand Deportments and the Eighty-Thousand Fine Practices, the gods brought him of-ferings. Those of you who wish to be high masters should protect and maintain the precepts and rules, and then the Dharma protectors and good spirits will protect you. If you break the precepts, they will not. Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an was “dignified and pure in Vinaya, a great model for the triple realm.Ÿ He was an example for those in the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm, and in response the gods brought him food to eat.One day when a god appeared with food, Vinaya Master Tao Hs‚an asked him, “Why does everyone like Kumàrajãva’s translations?ŸThe god, named Lu Hs‚an Ch’ang replied, “Because Kumàrajãva has been the master translator for the past seven Buddhas. The Såtras he translated are the same as the Buddhas’ heart, so everyone likes to read and recite them.ŸMoreover, when Kumàrajãva was about to die he said, “I personally don’t know if there are mistakes in the såtras I have translated, but if there are none, when I am cremated my tongue will not burn. If I have made mistakes, and the trans-lations are not in accord with the Buddhas’ heart, then my tongue will burn.Ÿ After Kumàrajãva completed the stillness, his body was burned but his tongue remained untouched by the fire, fully certifying that the såtras which Dharma Master Kumàrajãva translated are completely correct."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42Yao Ch’in Dynasty. The Yao Ch’in (344-413 A.D.) is the name given to the reign period of Emperor Yao Hsing. It is not the same as the Ying Ch’in, reign period of Ch’in Shih Huang, or as the Fu Chin, reign period of Emperor Fu Chien. When Fu Chien was assassinated by Yao Ch’ang the dynasty was renamed Yao Ch’in in honor of the new emperor. Yao Ch’ang in time was succeeded by his nephew Yao Hsing, and the dynasty name Yao Ch’in was retained. It was during the reign of Yao Hsing, a strong supporter of Buddhism, that Kumàrajãva translated the Såtra.Tripiñaka. Tripiñaka refers to the three divisions of the Buddhist canon:1. the såtra division, spoken for the study of samàdhi;2. the vinaya division, spoken for the study of morality;  and,3. the ÷àstra division, spoken for the study of wisdom.Dharma Master. Dharma Master has two meanings:1. he masters the Dharma and gives it to others, and2. he takes the Dharma as his master.There are four kinds of Dharma Masters: those who explain the Dharma for others, through lecturing såtras and discussing"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43principles of Dharma; those who read and recite the såtras for others; those who write out the såtras for others; and those who accept and maintain the såtras themselves. The last kind of Dharma Master accepts the principles of a såtra in his heart, and with his body puts the principles into practice. His cultivation is the embodiment of a såtra’s meaning. Not all Dharma Masters are Tripiñaka Masters. Some may have read only the såtras, or only the Vinaya, or only the ÷àstra division. As a Tripiñaka Dharma Master, Kumàrajãva had penetrated all three divisions of the canon: the såtras, the ÷àstras, and the Vinaya.Kumàrajãva. Kumàrajãva was the son of Kumàrà yaõa, who refused to inherit his father’s high position in order to leave the home life and cultivate the Way. During his travels as a mendi-cant, Kumàrà yaõa was received by the King of Kuchà, a small country of central India, and invited to be National Master there. Later by imperial command he was forced to marry the king’s sister, Jãvà. While she carried their son Kumàrajãva, her wisdom and power of learning increased remarkably, a phenomenon which also occurred while øàriputra was in his mother’s womb.Later Kumàrajãva’s mother wished to leave the home life. Finally, after a period of fasting she received permission from her reluctant husband, who, although formerly a bhikùu, had by then developed a strong attachment to his beautiful wife. After Jãvà became a bhikùuõã she quickly certified to the first fruit of Arhatship."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44The Sanskrit name Kumàrajãva means “mature youth,Ÿ because even as a youth he had the virtuous conduct of an elder. In one day he could memorize more than thirty-six thousand words. In two days he was able to recite the entire Dharma Blossom Såtra from memory. At age seven Kumàrajãva left the home life. One day while visiting a temple in Kashgar with his mother, he picked up a huge censer on one of the altars and lifted it over his head as an offering to the Buddhas. After doing so he thought, “This is too heavy for me to liftŸ and the discrimination rendered him incapable of holding the censer, so that he had to cry out to his mother for help. From that experience he came to the sudden and total realization that everything is made from the mind alone.During the Fu Ch’in Dynasty in China an astrologer predicted that a great sage would come. The Emperor Fu Chien recognized the sage to be Kumàrajãva, and sent a massive army commanded by General Lu Kuang to escort the Dharma Master to China. The King of Kuchà, disregard-ing Kumàrajãva’s advice that the advancing troops were not militant, countered the “invasion.Ÿ In the ensuing battle Kuchà’s king was killed and his army defeated. Many political changes followed which delayed Kumàrajãva’s arrival in China until the Yao Ch’in Dynasty. Kumàrajãva established a transla-tion center in Ch’ang An, the capital city, where he translated over three hundred volumes of Såtra texts, among them the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra, volume 577 of the Great Praj¤à Såtra."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46Chapter 1The Reasons for the Dharma AssemblyThus I have heard.

I have heard is the requirement of hearing,3. At one time is the requirement of time,4. The Buddha is the requirement of a host,5.

Since the requirements begin every såtra, they are called the “Common Preface.Ÿ The text which immediately follows them varies with each såtra, and so it is called the “Specific Preface.Ÿ In this såtra the Specific Preface is:At that time, at meal time, the World Honored One put on his robe, took up his bowl, and entered the great city of øràvastã to beg for food. After he had finished his sequential begging within the city, he returned, ate his food, put away his robe and bowl, washed his feet, arranged his seat and sat down.The Common Preface is also called both the “ForewordŸ and the “Postscript.Ÿ When lecturing såtras one can discuss this section as a foreword to the såtra and also as a Postscript ap-pended at a later date.“Can a preface really be called either a Foreword or a Postscript?Ÿ you might ask.There is nothing fixed about it. Whatever is fixed is not Buddhadharma. The Vajra Såtra makes clear the principle of no fixed dharmas. When something is fixed upon, the re-sultant attachment causes obstruction which in turn leads to affliction. When there is no attachment, emptiness is without affliction. When all is empty, to what can one be attached? What then cannot be put down? When one is completely empty of self, what affliction could there be?

When there is not even a person who feels pain, what affliction can there be? Where would the affliction come from? This is easy to talk about but difficult to do.The six requirements are called the Postscript because they were not part of the original Såtra. The Buddha did not say “Thus I have heard...Ÿ That text was added afterwards by the Venerable ânanda when the såtra division was compiled. The Postscript is also called the Prologue. Therefore the six requirements may be called the Foreword, the Prologue, and the Postscript.The Buddha instructed that all Såtras he spoke should begin with the four words “Thus I have heard...Ÿ Those who investigate Buddhist såtras should know the history of those four words.After the Buddha had finished speaking the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Blossom Såtra, the Nirvàõa Såtra, the Buddha Bequeaths the Teaching Såtra, the Kùitigarbha Såtra and others, he announced that he was going to enter nirvàõa.

I need your advice, Buddha.Ÿ“All right, speak,Ÿ said the Buddha.“The first question is, after the Buddha enters nirvàõa we want to compile the Såtras.

The next question is where should we live? There are so many of us. How will we get along?

You have been our Master, but when you enter nirvàõa who will our Master be? Will it be the oldest? Great Kà÷yapa is the oldest. Will it be someone middle aged? That would be Aj¤àtakauõóinya. If it is to be the very young-est — I’m the youngest, but I can’t be the Master. I can’t do it, Buddha.ŸThe Buddha said, “You don’t need to be Master, and neither does Aj¤àtakauõóinya or Great Kà÷yapa.Ÿ“Who will it be then?ŸThe Buddha said, “Take the Pratimokùa as your master.Ÿ The Pratimokùa is the Vinaya — the precepts and rules. “Take the precepts as Master.Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53The Buddha said that all people who have gone forth from home should take the Pratimokùa as Master.

His profound sincerity so moved øàkyamuni Buddha, who was staying in the Bamboo Grove, (about sixty or seventy"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56miles southeast of Ràjagçha), that he emitted a light to guide Sudatta. Seeing the light, Sudatta thought it was dawn, and eagerly dressed and set out. It was actually the middle of the night and the city gates had not yet been opened, but when the Elder arrived at the city wall, the gates, due to the Buddha’s spiritual penetrations, were open and he passed through them and proceeded on his way to see the Buddha. Sudatta followed the directions given him by his friend, and was guided by the Buddha’s light.When he arrived at the vihàra he didn’t know the correct procedure for greeting the Buddha. Again his deep sincerity evoked a response, and four gods transformed into bhikùus, circumambulated the Buddha three times to the right, went before the Honored One, bowed three times, knelt, placed their palms together, and made their inquiries. The Elder Sudatta followed their example, and then knelt before the Buddha who rubbed his crown and said, “Why have you come?ŸSudatta simply said, “Buddha, you are too good. I have never seen a Buddha before, and now I don’t want to leave you. Will you come and live near my home?ŸThe Buddha agreed saying, “All right, but do you have a place? The twelve hundred and fifty disciples who constantly accompany me will need to be fed and housed. Do you have accommodations large enough for all of us?Ÿ“I’ll find a place,Ÿ promised the Elder, and he returned home to begin an extensive search of the area which ended when he saw Prince Jeta’s flower garden. It was perfect in"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57every respect, affording a good view, yet convenient to the city proper. The grounds themselves were charged with effi-cacious energy. Everything about it was first rate, except that it belonged to the Prince.

That’s my price.Ÿ Prince Jeta was assuming the Elder Sudatta could not possibly afford grounds which cost their area in gold. Never did he guess that Sudatta’s money and his desire to hear the Dharma both were adequate.

It never oc-curred to me you would actually be willing to pay such a price. My garden can’t be bought for any amount.ŸThe Elder quietly replied, “Now you say you won’t sell? You are heir to the throne, and an Emperor’s word should be reliable. A king doesn’t lie or speak recklessly. You had better sell, because if people can’t trust your word now, why should they believe you after you assume the throne?ŸThe Prince recognized his predicament. “Very well,Ÿ he said. “Since you used gold coins to cover it, you have pur-chased the ground.

It was true that the tops of the trees had not been covered with gold, and if he refused to consent, the Prince might chop them down and then the garden would be far less beautiful. “All right, we’ll divide it.ŸTherefore it is called “The Jeta Grove in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the Solitary.Ÿ The Prince’s name is mentioned first since he was royalty, and the Elder Sudatta, known as Anàthapiõóada, “The Benefactor of Orphans and the Solitary,Ÿ who held a ministerial position in the court, is mentioned second.Together with a gathering of great bhikùus. After øàkya-muni Buddha realized Buddhahood, he went first to the Deer Park to cross over the Five Bhikùus including âj¤àtakauõóinya. Then he contemplated and saw that Uruvilvà Kà÷yapa, who had a large following of disciples, could be converted. øàkya-muni Buddha was an Elder Sa¤ghan and had the manner of a High Master, but when he arrived to pay his visit, Uruvilvà Kà÷yapa did not acknowledge him with respect because he thought, “I am the leader of many men. Everyone calls me the Worthy One....Ÿ Unaware of the Buddha’s background, he unceremoniously launched into an investigation of dharma with him. Soon, however, he realized what he had confronted, for no matter what he said, he never managed to have the last word. He could not defeat the Buddha in debate! Having failed with words, he resorted to his spiritual power as a fire worshipper. With the intention of burning the Buddha, he con-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59jured up a great fire. His strength was impressive, but the fire failed to touch the Buddha, and, in fact, veered back toward Kà÷yapa himself, who, on the verge of being burned alive, was helpless and immediately surrendered to the Buddha.Uruvilvà had five hundred disciples and his brothers had two hundred and fifty each, all of whom took refuge with the Buddha, bringing the number of disciples to 1,005.Later the Buddha converted Sariputra and Mahàmaud-galyàyana who had one hundred disciples each. When they took refuge, the Buddha’s disciples amounted to 1,205 in all. Ya÷as, the son of an elder, and his disciples also took refuge with the Buddha. This actually makes a total of 1,255 disci-ples who were the Buddha’s constant followers. Såtra texts round off the number to 1,250.At that time has five meanings:1. It was the time when the Buddha wanted to speak, began to speak, and was speaking.2. It was the time which breaks up the views of outside ways. Some outside ways deny the existence of past, present, and future. At that time means the explanation has occurred in the past, is occurring in the present, and will occur in the future. These words therefore separate the Buddhadharma from the dharma of outside ways.3. It was the time of planting seeds. Seeds that are planted and nourished will grow. Uncultivated seeds will perish. If one has developed good causes in past lives, but does not cultivate that fruit further in this life, he will have"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60roots that wither and die. If these good roots are continually cared for, they will bear further fruit. So if you have roots that are sufficiently good to allow you to hear Såtra lectures, do not just come occasionally; come as often as possible. The more you come, the deeper your roots will grow.4. It was the time to listen to såtras. That does not mean just listening once or twice. It means listening regularly, for the more you hear the more you understand. In listening to såtras three conditions must be fulfilled:a. a true teacher,b. a true teaching, andc. true study.With only one or two of these conditions fulfilled, study is useless. For instance, if you have a true teaching and truly study, but lack a true teacher, then you cannot understand that teaching. All three conditions must be met for cultivation to succeed.5. It was the time when the Buddha wanted to speak the Dharma and beings wanted to listen. The Buddha wished to speak in the way living beings wanted to hear. The Buddha and living beings are not two, one high and the other low. They are equal.World Honored One is one of the Ten Special Names of the Buddha. When the Buddha descended from the palace in the Tuùita heaven into the realm of people and was born from the right side through the ribs of his mother Màyà, he immediately"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61took seven steps, then with one hand pointing to heaven and one hand pointing to earth, he said, “Above heaven and below heaven, I alone am honored.Ÿ When he had finished speak-ing, nine dragons spouted water to bathe his body. Thus the Buddha is known as the World Honored One. World refers not only to the worldly but to the world transcending, for all realms, both mundane and transcendental, honor, revere, and bow to the World Honored One.The mention of meal time clearly shows that the Buddha, like ordinary people, still eats and drinks. When it was time to eat, the World Honored One put on his robe. There are three robes worn by members of the Sa¤gha:1. The antarvàsas, the five-piece robe, is a work robe. It is made in a pattern of five strips, each of which contains two pieces, one long and one short;2. the uttaràsa¤ga, the seven-piece robe, is worn for ceremonies and when listening to Dharma; and3. the saüghàñã, also called the “perfect robe,Ÿ or “great robe,Ÿ is composed of up to 108 pieces in twenty-five strips. Each piece in the robes represents a field and so they are also called “field of blessingsŸ robes. Members of the Sa¤gha wear the saüghàñã when receiving offerings from laymen, who thereby “plant fields of blessings.Ÿ When putting on the robe a verse is recited which says,“Good indeed is the liberation cloth!Unsurpassed field of blessings robe...Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62This robe is worn when lecturing Såtras and speaking Dharma from the high seat, when accepting offerings of pure food from the king or ruler of a country, and when begging for food.Meal time was not a casual affair for the Buddha as it is for lazy people who sleep until time to eat and then get up and wait for someone to prepare the food and serve it to them. Even though the Buddha had realized Buddhahood with its spiritual penetrations and wonderful functions, at meal time he still put on his robe and took up his bowl. The bowl refers to the Sanskrit word pàtra which translates as the “vessel of appropriate size,Ÿ implying that this bowl will hold enough to satisfy one’s needs. øàkyamuni Buddha was given his bowl by the Four Heavenly Kings who manifested to present it to him in person.He took his bowl and entered the great city of øràvastã to beg for food. Members of the Sa¤gha beg for food in order to give living beings an opportunity to plant seeds in the field of blessings. Because living beings did not know about going before the Triple Jewel to plant blessings, the Sa¤gha members went to the living beings by entering the cities and begging from door to door, neither by-passing the poor to beg from the rich, nor by-passing the rich to beg from the poor, unlike Subhåti who exclusively begged from the wealthy.The Buddha reprimanded his two disciples Subhåti and Great Kà÷yapa for their manner of begging. First he scolded Subhåti for thinking, “Wealthy people have money because in former lives they fostered merit and virtue. If I don’t beg from"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63them and give them the opportunity to plant further blessings, then next life they will be poor. They will not continue to be wealthy and honored.Ÿ So Subhåti only begged from the rich. However, wealthy people eat good food. Although he said it was to help them plant blessings so they could continue to be wealthy in future lives, I believe that in actuality Subhåti liked to eat good food and that is why he begged from the rich. That is what I say, but perhaps Subhåti was not like the rest of us, who constantly think about eating well. It is true that he wanted to help them continue their blessings.Second, the Buddha scolded Great Kà÷yapa because, in his arduous practice of asceticism, he not only ate just one meal a day, but he begged only from the poor. His thought was, “These people are poor because in former lives they did not foster merit and virtue. They did not do good deeds when they had money, and so in this life they are poor. I will help them out of their predicament by enabling them to plant bless-ings before the Triple Jewel so next life they will be wealthy and honored.Ÿ The poorer the house, the more he begged there, even to the point that the poor people took the food out of their own bowls in order to have an offering for him. I believe that because Patriarch Kà÷yapa cultivated asceticism he wanted to undergo suffering, and did not want to eat good things. He knew how people with money eat, and did not want to eat well himself. There is a Chinese proverb which says:To be sparing with clothing increases life.To be sparing with food increases blessings."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64Great Kà÷yapa was one hundred and twenty years old when he took refuge with the Buddha. Life after life he had been frugal, and in this life, because he did not like to eat rich food, he only begged from the poor, just the opposite of Subhåti. Both of those methods are extreme, and not in accord with the Middle Way, and it is for this reason that the øåraï gama Såtra says that the Buddha scolded them and called them Arhats.The Buddha was equitable in his begging and did not favor rich or poor. His disciple ânanda followed his example and practiced equal compassion. “ânanda already knew that the Tathàgata, the World Honored One, had admonished Subhåti and the Great Kà÷yapa as Arhats whose hearts were not equable.ŸHe (ânanda) decided that throughout his begging round he would pay no attention to whether his donors were clean or unclean, reputable kùatriyas or lowly caõóàlas. He would practice equal compassion, rather than seek out the mean and lowly, and in that way enable all living beings alike to obtain measureless merit.The Buddha’s impartiality in begging is indicated by the strict door-to-door sequence he followed. When he finished begging at one house he went to beg at the one beside it, and so forth on to the next.After he had finished his sequential begging he returned to the Jeta Grove in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65Solitary, where he ate the food, put away his robe and bowl, and washed his feet. The Buddha traveled the roads barefoot, so after he returned and had eaten he washed his feet.Then he arranged his seat and sat down. When the begging was finished, the food eaten, his robe and bowl stored, and his feet cleansed — after this basic routine had been attended to — the Buddha then arranged his seat and sat down. This does not mean that he piled pillows beneath and pillows behind, pillows all around and then eased himself onto a plush couch like some people do. It means he made a gesture or two — straightened a mat, tidied the seat a bit, and then sat down.Real mark praj¤à was expressed in the Buddha’s performance of the daily routine. That is not to say the em-phasis was placed on the performance itself, to announce, “I cultivate!Ÿ Rather, if one understands Dharma, everything is cultivation. That is not true of one who affects the manner of an experienced cultivator declaring, “Look at me, I just sit here thus,Ÿ whereas the next minute finds him fidgeting, squirming, and talking a mile a minute. People who cultivate the Way seldom talk. Do not talk too much. If you do you will hinder other people’s cultivation as well as your own. In a place where the Sa¤gha lives one cannot hear the sound of a single voice. If conversation is necessary it is carried on in very low tones so as not to disturb others. People who wish to use effort in cultivation of the Way should study the Buddha and in every movement, every gesture, avoid obstructing others."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66Chapter 2Subhåti’s RequestAt that time the Elder Subhåti arose from his seat in the assembly, uncovered his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, put his palms together with respect and said to the Buddha,After øàkyamuni Buddha had put away his robe and bowl, washed his face, arranged his seat and sat down, an Elder named Subhåti stood up in the assembly. There are Three Kinds of Elders: the elder in years, the Dharma-nature elder, and the elder in blessings and virtue.1. The elder in years must be old and have held the precepts for a long time, as had Mahàkà÷yapa, the oldest and longest precepted of those in øàkyamuni Buddha’s Dharma assembly. There are three grades of elders in years:a. low rank, those who have held precepts for at least ten years;b. middle rank, those who have held precepts for more than twenty years; andc. high rank, those who have held precepts for more than thirty years.2. The Dharma-nature elder may be young, but he must possess great wisdom and be able to lecture såtras and speak Dharma with sufficient power to teach and transform living beings. His stature comes from his deep understanding"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67of Dharma, his penetration of wonderful principle, and his unobstructed eloquence. For example, the Buddha’s disciple øàriputra mastered the entire Buddhadharma in just seven days and became an Elder at the age of eight. At that time he mounted the high seat: and spoke Dharma, totally confound-ing the best debators from the five parts of India. All they could do was prostrate themselves before the eight-year-old child and confess themselves defeated. Of all øàkyamuni Buddha’s disciples, øàriputra was foremost in wisdom and had unobstructed eloquence.There are Four Kinds of Unobstructed Eloquence: of phrasing, principle, Dharma and delight in speech.a. Unobstructed eloquence of phrasing enables one to answer any question, however difficult, without perplexity.b. Unobstructed eloquence of principle is a necessary complement to that of phrasing, because along with having limitless powers of debate, one must always speak in accordance with principle.c. Unobstructed eloquence of Dharma means that no matter what is said, one can counter with a higher principle. There is a saying, “Everything is the Way. Left and right meet the source.Ÿd. Unobstructed eloquence of delight in speaking enables one to obtain the Delight in"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 Speech Samàdhi. Then, even if the audience is unwilling to listen, one’s words flow like water and no one can resist the current.3. The elder in blessings and virtue must have the reward from having planted blessings and acted with virtuous conduct.Elder is a term of respect and definitely not a title one assigns oneself saying, “I am an elder. Everyone should call me ‘Elder.’Ÿ Subhåti, the elder in the Vajra Praj¤à Dharma Assembly, was an elder in years, a Dharma-nature elder, and an elder in blessings and virtue.Subhåti has three meanings: “empty-born,Ÿ “well-manifest,Ÿ and “good luck.Ÿ In Subhåti’s household there were one hundred and eight storehouses filled with the Seven Precious Gems: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, mother-of-pearl, red pearls, and carnelian. When Subhåti was born, it was found that the storehouses were entirely empty. One after another the vaulted doors were opened to reveal absolutely nothing within. “Who has stolen my jewels?Ÿ cried Subhåti’s distraught father. “We had such wealth and now are penniless. What is the meaning of this son?Ÿ He went to a diviner who calculated that the disappearance of the jewels and the birth of the child had been simultaneous, and so his father called the infant “empty born.Ÿ Analyzing the child’s birthchart, the diviner declared it very lucky, whereupon the child was further named “good luck.Ÿ Seven days after Subhåti’s birth, all of the family wealth reap-peared in the one hundred eight storerooms. That moved the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69father to rename his son “well-manifest.Ÿ Subhåti grew up while øàkyamuni Buddha was in the world teaching and transform-ing living beings, and he left home under the Buddha.Subhåti arose from his seat in the assembly. From among the thousands of millions of billions of men and gods in the assembly, Subhåti got up from his seat. He saw øàkyamuni Buddha sitting there in a state which can only be described as “thus, thus, unmoving, completely and eternally bright,Ÿ and he knew the Buddha was presenting the Dharma of praj¤à wisdom. For in his daily routine — walking, standing, sitting, and lying down — øàkyamuni Buddha always taught real mark praj¤à, contemplative praj¤à, and literary praj¤à.The wonderful door of praj¤à can only be entered by means of wisdom. Subhåti’s wisdom, blessings, and virtue were complete, and so he understood that the Buddha was teach-ing the Dharma door of real mark praj¤à. For that reason he arose from his seat in the assembly and uncovered his right shoulder. According to Indian custom, uncovering the right shoulder was a gesture of utmost respect, and Chinese monks, honoring the custom, left the right shoulder bare in their ad-aptation of the Indian robe.The Chinese modified the robe slightly in other respects, however, using shades of dark brown for the five and seven piece robes rather than the saffron color worn by the Sa¤gha of India, Thailand, Burma, and Ceylon. Also, since the climate of China is colder than that of India, monks needed additional"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70clothing under their robes for added warmth. But with the robe not directly against their skin, they were not aware if it came loose. Patriarch Bodhidharma therefore designed a clasp on the left shoulder to secure the robe, and the clasp became a standard part of Chinese robe design.Subhåti uncovered his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, put his palms together with respect, and said to the Buddha. The ritual performed in requesting Dharma symbolizes the purity of the Three Karmas:1. uncovering the right shoulder and placing the right knee on the ground represents the purity of body karma.2. Placing the palms together respectfully represents pure mind karma.3. Verbalizing the request indicates the karma of the mouth is pure.“How rare, World Honored One, is the Tathàgata who re-members and protects all Bodhisattvas and causes them to be well-endowed.ŸThe rare occurrence Subhåti refers to is the appearance of a Buddha, a World Honored One. øàkyamuni Buddha had arranged his seat and sat down without saying a word. Was Subhåti making something out of nothing, making waves where there was no wind, setting up wrong where there had not even been a right, placing a head on top of a head, adding a mark to a mark: was he just looking for trouble? If the Buddha had spoken a principle or made a sign it might"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71have made sense to respond, “How rare, World Honored One...,Ÿ but all øàkyamuni Buddha had done was arranged his seat and sat down.This passage merits very special attention, for the main point of the vajra Såtra is right here. By the time øàkyamuni Buddha had arranged his seat and sat down, he had already finished teaching Dharma. That is why Subhåti uttered his words of praise. For øàkyamuni Buddha had taught the praj¤à of real mark which is apart from the mark of the spoken word, apart from the mark of the written word, apart from the mark of the conditioned heart, apart from each and every mark. Only sages who had certified to the fruit understood: common people were not up to it. Realizing that, Subhåti hoped øàkyamuni Buddha would speak a provisional teach-ing, an expedient Dharma of literary praj¤à, for the sake of living beings. That is why he prefaced his request for Dharma by saying, “How rare is the World Honored One....Ÿ Truly rare is the Tathàgata. Rarely is there a World Honored One. The real mark praj¤à is a protection and an endowment for all Bodhisattvas. The Dharma is extremely wonderful.“World Honored One, if a good man, or good woman, resolves his heart on Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi, how should he dwell, how should he subdue his heart?ŸSince Subhåti was requesting Dharma on behalf of living beings, he repeated his address to the World Honored One, “øàkyamuni Buddha, World Honored One,Ÿ he said, “you have already taught real mark praj¤à, but most living"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72beings have not understood or clearly recognized it. Please, World Honored One, teach it once again for living beings in the future Dharma Ending Age. If men and women of good conduct resolve their hearts on Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi...ŸAnuttarasaüyaksaübodhi is a Sanskrit word which means “Unsurpassed, Proper and Equal, Right Enlightenment.Ÿ The term is not translated because it is an honorific designation for the ultimate fruit, that of Buddhahood. Anuttara means “unsurpassed.Ÿ Saüyak is translated as “proper and equal,Ÿ and Saübodhi means “right enlightenment.Ÿ Right enlighten-ment is testified to by those of the two vehicles, and it is what differentiates them from common unenlightened people. The proper and equal enlightenment of the Bodhisattvas differs from the right enlightenment of the two vehicles in that those who have it have testified to an enlightenment equal to the Buddha’s. It is, however, still not the Unsurpassed Enlighten-ment. Once they have testified to proper and equal enlighten-ment, Bodhisattvas are called “surpassed lords.Ÿ The Buddha is known as the “unsurpassed lord,Ÿ because there is nothing above him. The Dharma Masters of great virtue who translated såtras in the past retained the original Sanskrit name of the Buddha’s position, and Dharma Masters who followed them honored the decision in their own translations.Subhåti asked the Buddha, “If someone resolves his heart on Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi, how should he dwell? Which means, how can he eternally dwell in his true heart? “How"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73should he subdue his heart?Ÿ How can he tame all false, vain thoughts? How can he subdue his greed? How can he tame his enmity? How can he conquer his stupidity? That is what is meant by subduing his heart. The evil heart must be conquered, just as if one were fighting to win a war.“How does one conquer greed, anger, and stupidity?Ÿ One counters them with morality, concentration, and wisdom.Greed, anger, and stupidity are morality, concentration, and wisdom, and vice versa. It is a matter of how one uses them. For example, one can use money to buy marijuana and get high, or he can use the money to help someone else. Relieving someone else’s suffering is a far better use of money than selfishly smoking marijuana. It’s the same money; only the use differs.So it is with greed, anger, and stupidity; morality, con-centration, and wisdom. When one understands how to use them, they are morality, concentration, and wisdom; when one is so deluded that one cannot make them function, they are greed, anger, and stupidity. Ice does not differ from water, and water does not differ from ice. Just as water is ice and ice is water, so too afflictions are Bodhi and Bodhi is afflictions. Bodhi and afflictions are not two. If one cannot use it, Bodhi changes to afflictions; if one can, afflictions become Bodhi. However,What is spoken is Dharma.What is practiced is the Way;Even if you speak extremely well,With no real practice, there is no real Way."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74One must actually go and do it. One must honestly, truly, rely on the Buddhadharma and cultivate. Relentlessly cultivating morality, concentration, and wisdom, and putting to rest greed, anger, and stupidity are the means to subdue the heart. When one subdues the false heart, the true heart eternally dwells as a matter of course. The “eternally dwell-ing true heart, clear nature, bright substanceŸ results from putting to rest the false heart, which allows the true heart to manifest.The Buddha said, “Good indeed, good indeed, Subhåti it is as you say. The Tathàgata remembers and protects all bodhisattvas and causes them to be well-endowed. Now listen attentively; I shall tell you. A good man or good woman who resolves his heart on Anuttarasaüyak-saübodhi should thus dwell, should thus subdue his heart.Ÿ“Yes, certainly, World Honored One. I want to hear. I am delighted to listen.Ÿøàkyamuni Buddha, delighted that Subhåti came to request Dharma for the sake of living beings, praised him saying, “Good indeed, good indeed. Ah, you, Subhåti, you are truly good. I really like you. You are my good disciple. It is as you have said, I, the Tathàgata, remember and protect all Bodhisattvas and cause them to be well-endowed by teaching the Dharma-door of praj¤à. You should pay particular atten-tion.

Listen well. A good man or good woman who resolves his heart on Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi should thus dwell in his true heart, thus subdue his false heart.Ÿ The essential place in the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra lies in the word thus. At that point øàkyamuni Buddha gave an indication which is not apparent in the literature. “What was it like?ŸIt was thus. At that pointThe road of words and language is cut off.The place of the heart’s working is extinguished.The presence of words in the mouth ends. The conditioned deliberation of the mind vanishes. Thus is “like this.Ÿ The wordless teaching instructs one to investigate dhyàna and sit in meditation. One should dwell thus. Dwell at the place that is thus. One’s true heart dwells at that place. One should subdue one’s thoughts thus. One can investigate dhyàna and, using the skill of still consideration, naturally subdue one’s false heart. Therefore thus represents no obvious sign which emerges, but rather indicates a manner.“What manner is that?ŸIt is the lack of manner inherent in markless praj¤ à, and it constitutes real mark praj¤à.Subhåti understood.

Yet of the immeasurable, boundless numbers of living beings thus taken across to extinction, there is actually no living being taken across to extinction. And why? Subhåti, if a Bodhisattva has a mark of self, a mark of others, a mark of living beings, or a mark of a life, he is not a Bodhisattva.ŸThe Buddha told Subhåti how all Bodhisattvas should subdue their hearts. All can mean “many,Ÿ the entire host of Bodhisattvas, or it can refer to each individual Bodhisattva; or it can refer to just one specific Bodhisattva. Many is just one, one is likewise many.

If you, as a common person, believe that you can become a Buddha, how much the more easily can you become a Bodhisattva!The Sanskrit word Mahàsattva means “great being,Ÿ and refers to great Bodhisattvas.“How large is a great Bodhisattva?ŸHow can you ask about the size of a great Bodhisattva? He is just as great as a great Bodhisattva. The Seven Mean-ings of Mahàsattva will give an idea of his grandeur:1. He has perfected great roots.For limitless kalpas the Bodhisattva has made offerings before the Buddha to the Triple Jewel, bowing and revering the Buddha, Dharma, and Sa¤gha, and performing many meritorious and virtuous deeds. From these acts great roots develop. In a later passage the Vajra Såtra says:You should know that such people have not planted good roots with just one Buddha, two Buddhas, three, four, or five Buddhas, but have planted good roots with measureless millions of Buddhas."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"792. He has great wisdom.His great wisdom is evident in his resolve to realize Bodhi. Without wisdom such a decision cannot be made. Good roots and the wisdom acquired from cultivation in past lives enable people to read the Såtras and participate in dhyàna sessions. A person lacking good roots would, from the moment he entered the monastery door, find his heart jumping as though it were inhabited by a monkey, and pounding so hard that standing would be uncomfortable and sitting unbearable. He would resemble a god manifesting the Five Marks of Decay, squirming and fidgeting in his seat and finally running away.On the other hand, even though I threaten to beat my disciples, and scold them daily, they do not run away. Why don’t they run away? Because they have good roots. Don’t think that a blow from the incense board is easy to endure. It’s no joke. All of you who have not yet become enlightened are candidates for beating. By now I should have beaten you all into running. My intention is to bring you all to enlightenment.Not only must one have great wisdom and the resolve to realize Bodhi, but one must also extensively rescue living beings. Avalokite÷vara Bodhisattva’s Universal Door exem-plifies such resolve. However, in taking living beings across, one should not become attached to the mark of taking them across like the Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty.

But “the straight mind is the field of enlightenment,Ÿ and Bodhidharma simply said, “You haven’t any merit.ŸEmperor Wu heard those words as if he had been struck by a blow and replied, “Why you black-faced monk, how can you say such a thing to me?Ÿ He thereupon refused to acknowledge the Patriarch, and since the Emperor would no longer receive his teaching, Bodhidharma took his leave.The Emperor actually had been taking living beings across, but he was attached to the mark of taking them across, and sought certification from the Patriarch.Who would have guessed that Bodhidharma would look him straight in the eye as if to say,Ÿ I don’t care if you are the Emperor, I refuse to submit to your Imperial decorum.Ÿ The Emperor lacked genuine wisdom, and thus becameattached to marks.3. He believes the great Dharma.The Buddhadharma is deeper than the great sea, higher than Mount Sumeru. It is difficult to fathom and difficult to penetrate, but with faith one can taste its flavor. Entry into the ocean of Buddhadharma is impossible for the person who lacks faith. Just as one might gaze at the ocean and heave a great sigh,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81saying, “It’s so big I could not drink it dry in my entire life,Ÿ so too might one react when confronted with the precious store of Buddhadharma, saying, “How can I ever study all the Såtras?Ÿ However, if one has faith, if one truly believes, then from the shallow one can enter the deep; from the near one can reach the far; from a little one can gain a lot. With constant investigation, little by little one penetrates the precious store of Buddhadharma. Deep faith, firm vows, and actual practice are the ingredients. No matter how wonderful the great Dharma is, without firm faith the wonderful cannot be obtained.Great Dharma refers to Praj¤à wisdom. One simply need believe in his own originally existent wisdom. A passage of the Vajra Såtra says: “Whoever produces a single thought of pure faith is completely known and completely seen by the Tathàgata.Ÿ The Buddha knows if you bring forth a single thought of pure faith. Receiving the telegram he sends the reply:Relentlessly Cultivate Morality Concentration Wisdom Stop Put Greed Anger Stupidity To Rest StopThe person who receives the reply should respond imme-diately by relentlessly cultivating morality, concentration, and wisdom and putting greed, anger, and stupidity to rest. However, the Dharma is so subtle and wonderful that the person who receives the telegram from the Buddha may not even realize it.4. He understands the great principle.This is the understanding that one is, oneself, originally a"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82Buddha. The principle is Buddha; Buddha is the principle. The Buddha is one who has already realized Buddhahood. The Mahàsattva understands that he himself has not yet realized Buddhahood, but that basically the Buddha and he are one, not two and not different. The Buddha’s cultivation of virtue is perfected, that of living beings is not. Living beings are not-yet-realized Buddhas; Buddhas are already-realized living beings. One should not become confused about this and profess to be a Buddha, saying, “I am Buddha and the Buddha is me.Ÿ The Buddha is a living being who has realized Buddhahood; living beings are not-yet-realized Buddhas.“How is it that we are originally Buddhas?ŸReal mark praj¤à is not separate from the hearts of living beings. The Buddha is the heart of living beings. Our true heart is the Buddha. As present, however, we have not excavated and uncovered our own true nature, and we use a false thinking heart to manage our affairs. By analogy, the false thinking heart is like a blind man, and the true heart like a man who can see.“Why do we conduct ourselves solely on the basis of false thoughts? Have we lost our true heart?ŸNo, the true heart has not been lost. The øåraï gama Såtra explains that we use false thinking because “one unen-lightened thought produces the three fine marks.ŸThese three — the mark of karma, the mark of turning, and the mark of manifestation — occlude the true nature so that the Tathàgata’s precious store cannot appear. When we truly believe we are the Buddha and have actually perfected"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83the Buddha’s marks of wisdom and virtue, we will understand the great principle.5. He cultivated the great conduct.In cultivation one should not have a little success and feel satisfied, mistaking the transformation city for the ultimate truth. People of the two vehicles obtain some small advantage and are content. Their satisfaction with certification to the first, second, third, or fourth fruits of Arhatship prevents them from turning from the small to the great.Some come half-way and think they have reached the goal. There is the case of the ignorant bhikùu who obtained the state of the fourth dhyàna and thought he had certified to the fourth fruit of Arhatship, saying, “I’ve already arrived at my goal.Ÿ He was actually only half-way there.Common men go half-way and then turn back. Without even reaching the fourth dhyàna heavens they begin to retreat, “It’s too far, too hard, for the likes of us,Ÿ they say.Some are waylaid in a transformation city, like the one described in the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Blossom Såtra. Why was such a city conjured up?Ÿ Followers of the two vehicles cultivated a day or so seeking the Bodhisattva Way without attaining it. Then they cultivated another day, and still did not become Bodhisattvas. The following day, although they reached the Bodhisattva Way, they did not reach its end, and they decided the process was just too long. These “daysŸ represent years, decades, aeons of time. The longer the culti-vators sought to obtain their goal, the more bitter their suffer-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84ing became. The more weary they grew, the less they were able to proceed. “I cannot go on. It’s too far. I didn’t know it was such a long way. I am really tired,Ÿ they cried.Seeing their plight, the Buddha conjured up a transfor-mation city and called to them, “Look! There’s a city ahead where we can rest a few days. Our goal is but a short distance beyond the city.Ÿ When they entered the city, the people of the two vehicles became infatuated with the abundance of gold, silver, and precious gems and decided to settle there. “This place is a real treasure house,Ÿ they thought.In cultivation one must be patient with suffering and fatigue. Practicing the great conduct, one must be patient, yielding, and generous. One must practice the six perfections, the first of which is giving for the benefit of others and not seeking only to help oneself.“I have seen members of the Sa¤gha begging,Ÿ someone says. “Their cultivation of the Way is solely involved with asking for money, not with giving it.ŸAh, but when bhikùus give money they do not advertise it. I have known Dharma Masters who were so truly commit-ted to helping people that, if asked, they would offer their flesh to eat and blood to drink. For the sake of others they would willingly offer their own flesh and bones to heaven and earth. It is just that you have not known a person who has truly re-solved his heart on Bodhi and who cultivates great conduct. Or perhaps you have, but didn’t recognize him, for such a one cannot say to you, “I am one who cultivates great conduct.Ÿ Since he cannot tell you, you have no way to know that he"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85is one who can endure wind, rain, cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, bearing what people cannot bear, yielding what people cannot yield, eating what people cannot eat, and enduring what people cannot endure.On the other hand, those who imitate the style of a seasoned cultivator in order to impress people are useless. “Look at me. I can eat what others cannot eat.Ÿ That is false giving. Playing the great martyr and relinquishing house and home, family and wealth, for the sake of appearances is false giving. No matter how good the property or how fine the wife, if one’s self-sacrifice is done as a public display, the giving is not true. If it is not done for the sake of appearances, then giving is cultivating the great conduct.6. He passes through great kalpas.The cultivation of a Bodhisattva involves planting good roots, but not before one Buddha only. One who fully cultivates passes through three great asaükhyeya kalpas.7. He seeks the great fruit.The Bodhisattva Way is cultivated by those who seek the great fruit. Foreign lands are not sought after, because Bodhi-sattvas are not small landlords who set about conquering other countries in order to build an empire. Only Anuttarasaüyak-saübodhi, the highest fruit of cultivation, is the goal of great beings.A Mahàsattva, one whose conduct encompasses those seven aspects, should thus subdue his thoughts. “How?ŸIn no particular manner, but rather, thus. Thus is a"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86direct statement. It is the principle substance of real mark, and so it is said to have no particular manner of execution. The absence of distinction is referred to as thus rather than described in superficial terms.One should subdue his thoughts by thinking, “I must cause all living beings to enter nirvàõa without residue and be taken across to extinction. All living beings may be divided into Twelve Categories. Of the twelve, which are discussed in detail in the øåraï gama Såtra, ten are listed in this Såtra text. Those not listed include “those not totally with formŸ and “those not totally without form.Ÿ Those not totally with form include living beings which basically have form, but which maintain it only through parasitic relationships with other living beings, such as transparent jellyfish who have no eyes and use shrimp to act as their seeing faculty. Those not totally without form include living beings which basically are formless but which voluntarily appear when called upon through mantras, such as mantra spirits and ghosts.The first four of the Twelve Categories are:born from eggs due to thought,born from wombs due to emotion,born from moisture due to a process of union, andborn by transformation due to a process of separation.In the process which involves thought, emotion, union, and separation, doubt is created. With the arising of doubt, karma is made; with the existence of karma, one undergoes retribu-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87tion, each according to his kind. Each and every birth depends upon causal conditions which determine the retribution to be received.Beings are born from eggs due to thought. An example by way of analogy is the setting hen which broods over her eggs from morning to night thinking, “My little chicks should come out soon. Come out, come out, little chicks.Ÿ She thinks for a long time until finally she thinks them out of their shells. The eggs break into chickens, brought forth from thought.Beings are born from wombs due to emotion. The womb exists because of the love and emotion which occur between male and female. The intercourse of this love and emotion results, under the requisite conditions, in pregnancy in the womb.Beings are born from moisture due to union. The union of karma with warmth produces, under the right con-ditions, moisture-born creatures, bacteria, viruses, and the like.Beings are born by transformation due to separation. When a karmic formation separates from something old and becomes something new there is birth by transformation, as for example the metamorphosis of a moth.Beings with form refers to beings such as auspicious and inauspicious essences which result from astrological phenomena. Such beings take form, but the form is not permanent.Beings without form refers to beings in the Four Formless Heavens, the Heaven of Boundless Emptiness, the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88Heaven of Boundless Consciousness, the Heaven of Nothing Whatsoever, and the Heaven of Neither Thought nor No Thought.Beings with thought refers to ghosts, spirits andessences, either good manifestations like Bodhisattvas, or evil ones like weird freaks.Beings without thought refers to those which have turned into earth, trees, metal, or rocks. An example by way of analogy is a mountain in Hong Kong called, “Gazing After Her Husband,Ÿ so named because in the past there was a woman who climbed the mountain daily with her child in order to stare out to the sea in search of her husband who had gone off to war and never returned. Because she sustained that solitary thought for a long time the woman eventually turned into stone. High on the mountain can still be seen the stone figure of the woman bearing her child as she stands gazing out to sea.Beings who are not totally with thought refers to living beings which are involuntarily born into the form of another creature due to that creature’s thought powers, such as the larvae of the mulberry moth whose body is transformed into that of a wasp through the thought power of a “lone wasp.Ÿ The wasp readies its nest and places within it some mulberry larva. It then proceeds for seven days to recite a mantra over the insects. The mantra is simply “Be like me! Be like me!Ÿ After seven days the mulberry larva becomes a wasp.Beings who are not totally without thought refers to those whose bodies are originally thoughtless matter, but who"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89come into existence within that matter due to the longing of the parent. Consequently those beings become possessed by extremely bizarre thoughts.I must cause them all to enter nirvàõa without residue and be taken across to extinction; The I here is the false “IŸ of the Bodhisattva used expediently to communicate with living beings who still possess a view of self.All of the ten classes of living beings in the three realms are led to enter nirvàõa without residue. Nirvàõa is a Sanskrit word which translates as “perfect stillness.Ÿ Taken across to extinction means having put the two obstacles, the obstacle of afflictions, and the obstacle of what is known, to an end. It also means that the beings have transcended the Two Deaths: share-section birth and death, and change birth and death.There are four kinds of nirvàõa:1. Nirvàõa of the pure, clear self-nature. The self-nature is inherent in everyone. It is not subject to birth and death and is not larger in sages or smaller in ordinary people.2. Nirvàõa with residue. By using the flame of wisdom on the fuel of afflictions, the secondary bonds of delusion are severed; but the basic bond of the body remains. The body which remains is subject to share-section birth and death; that is said to be nirvàõa “with residue.Ÿ3. Nirvàõa without residue. When afflictions and the residue of share-section birth and death are extin-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90guished, the multitude of sufferings is eternally stilled. There is no further residue.4. Nirvàõa of no dwelling. Here wisdom and compassion are mutually interactive. Those who have attained the nirvàõa of no dwelling continue to cross living beings over but are themselves not subject to birth and death.The nirvàõa without residue mentioned in the text includes the latter two of the four kinds of nirvàõa.Although Bodhisattvas take numberless beings to extinction, there are actually no living beings taken across. That is the manifestation of the perfect substance and the great function of praj¤à. The substance of real mark praj¤à is without the slightest inequality. As is said later in the Såtra, “This dharma is level and equal with no high or low.Ÿ The function of contemplative praj¤à originally is without a mark; as the text later says, “Those who have relinquished all marks are called Buddhas.ŸIf a Bodhisattva crosses living beings over and yet at-taches to a self who takes them across, the four marks are not yet empty, and the false heart is not yet subdued. Such a person turns his back on praj¤à and becomes involved in the four marks that unite to form a self. The mark of self is the root of all marks. If one can turn the illusion of self around, then he can take living beings across to nirvàõa. He can separate himself from the four marks, subdue his heart, and thereby become a true Bodhisattva."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91Chapter 4Wonderful Conduct without Dwelling“Moreover, Subhåti, as to dharmas, a Bodhisattva should not dwell anywhere when he gives. He should not dwell in forms when he gives, nor should he dwell in sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, or dharmas when he gives. Subhåti, a Bodhisattva should give thus: he should not dwell in marks. And why? If a Bodhisattva does not dwell in marks when he gives, his blessings and virtues are im-measurable.“Subhåti, what do you think, is space in the east measurable?Ÿ“No, World Honored One.Ÿ“Subhåti, is space in the south, west, north, or in the intermediate directions, or above, or below, measurable?Ÿ“No, World Honored One.Ÿ“Subhåti, the blessings and virtue of a Bodhisattva who does not dwell in marks when he gives are just as immeasurable. Subhåti, a Bodhisattva should only dwell in what is taught thus.ŸTo have no dwelling is to have no attachment. No attachment is liberation. Therefore, not dwelling, one is liberated, independent, and not blocked or obstructed by anything.Moreover, a Bodhisattva should not dwell anywhere when he practices giving. In other words he should not be"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92attached when he gives. If he is able to free him self from attachment, he has understood that the Substance of the Three Wheels, composed of1) one who gives,2) one who receives, and3) that which is given, is empty.If your act of giving carries with it the thought, “I practice giving and have done many meritorious and virtuous deeds,Ÿ or if you are aware of the receiver, or of the goods given, then you have not left the mark of giving. You should give and be as if you had not given. If you attach to the marks of the six sense objects, forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, and mental dharmas when giving, your merit and virtue are limited. If you fall victim to the thought, “I contributed a million dollars to a certain temple,Ÿ then all you have is a million dollars’ worth of merit. When the money runs out, so do your merit and virtue.If you are not attached to the mark of giving, you accrue limitless merit and virtue, even by giving as little as a single cent. If you fail to practice the proper method of giving, then although you may give gifts throughout as many great kalpas as there are motes of dust, you will still have accomplished nothing. It still has been just like boiling sand to make rice; no matter how long you cook it, it never becomes rice.øàkyamuni Buddha used the analogy of “empty space in the ten directionsŸ to represent the extent of merit and virtue involved in the act of giving which is detached from the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93mark of giving. He said, “Subhåti, a Bodhisattva should only dwell in what is taught thus.Ÿ A Bodhisattva who has already resolved to realize Bodhi should think of what he has thus been taught and adhere to it in cultivation.If you remember what you have given, then I will forget it. If you can forget it, then I will keep it in mind. It is the same with the Buddha who, knowing the hearts of all living beings, is aware that you have not forgotten the merit and virtue of your acts of giving, and so he finds it unnecessary to remember them himself. When you forget them, the Buddha remembers. Do you think it is better for you or the Buddha to remember?You think, “I’m afraid that if I forget, the Buddha will forget, too, and then I simply will not have any merit at all.ŸNever fear. If you forget about your acts of giving the Buddha will eternally remember them. As it says later in the Vajra Såtra, “All the various thoughts which occur to all living beings are completely known to the Tathàgata.Ÿ When you do good things, you remember them, but when you do bad, do you also cherish the memories? No, you try to forget your offenses immediately, yet you fondly ponder the good you have done. You should forget the good and remember the bad. Why remember the bad? So you will not do it again. Why forget the good? So you will feel the need to do more.For those who study the Buddhadharma, every anni-versary of a Buddha or Bodhisattva’s birthday, leaving home day, enlightenment, or nirvàõa is an excellent time to make offerings to the Triple Jewel, as the meritorious virtue derived"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94increases several thousand-fold.

Those who have money can give money, those who have strength can give strength. But one should not think about it. That is genuine giving.2.

Because the existence of marks is false. All marks decay and become extinct. In the midst of marks one must be separate from marks. When there are marks, know them as empty. Then you see the Tathà-gata’s Dharma body , which is without form or appearance. If you rely on marks to see the Tathàgata, you have made a mistake.Later in the text a four-line gàthà says:If one sees me in form,If one seeks me in sound,He practices a deviant way,And cannot see the Tathàgata.The originally existent wisdom of praj¤à is separate from all marks. Not grasping any marks, genuine praj¤à is found."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97Chapter 6Proper Belief is RareSubhåti said to the Buddha, “World Honored One, in the future will there be living beings, who, when they hear such phrases spoken will truly believe?ŸThe Buddha told Subhåti, “do not speak in such a way!

All who hear such phrases and produce even one thought of pure faith are completely known and completely seen by the Tathàgata. Such living beings thus obtain measureless blessings and virtue. And why? Those living beings have no further mark of self, of others, of living beings, or of a life; no mark of dharmas and no mark of no dharmas. If living beings’ hearts grasp at marks, then that is attachment to self, to others, to living beings, and to a life. For that reason you should not grasp at dharmas, nor should you grasp at no dharmas. Regarding that principle, the Tathàgata often says, ‘all you bhikùus should know that the Dharma which I speak is like a raft.

When you are near the Triple Jewel your good roots increase. Take heed. Do not do bad deeds. Offer up only good conduct. The inhabitants of Utta-rakuru cannot see the Buddha, hear the Dharma, or see the Sa¤gha, and so their good roots die. In order to plant good roots one should first take refuge with the Triple Jewel. To plant further good roots one can receive the five precepts, the eight precepts, or the ten major and forty-eight minor precepts of a Bodhisattva available for laymen,; or the 250 bhikùu or 348 bhikùuõã precepts available for those who wish to leave the home life.The good roots one plants by accepting and holding the five precepts and cultivating the ten good acts cannot be seen, smelled, tasted, or touched because they are without a mark. “All with marks is empty and false,Ÿ but people do not realize that, and only know how to nurture their bodies, not their good roots.“What are good roots?ŸGood roots are another name for your Dharmabody and your wisdom.

If you plant good roots with non-Buddhist religions, you will not be able to reap any ultimate benefit, no matter how many good roots you plant or how long you nurture them.Living beings who produce the purest, most sincere thought of belief upon hearing the Vajra Såtra are those who have planted good roots before limitless millions of Buddhas. Giving rise to such a true, real heart, a heart which is without the least divergence or scepticism, they obtain limitless and unbounded blessings and virtue.Such people have realized the emptiness of people and so have no mark of self, others, living beings, or a life. Having no self means seeing the self as empty. Having no mark of others means seeing people as empty. Self and people both empty, living beings are also empty. Naturally when living beings are empty then there is no mark of a life, which refers to the continual quest for immortality as well as to the constant pursuit of all things which one loves and cannot see through.Having realized the emptiness of people one should also realize the emptiness of dharmas, and relinquish the mark of the non-existence of dharmas as well. When there is not any right dharma or any wrong dharma, one has arrived at the basic substance of dharmas.If those living beings’ hearts grasp at marks, if they hold to the mark of people, they still grasp at the four marks and have not obtained liberation.

If they grasp at the mark of dharmas they are still attached to the four marks; if they grasp at the mark of the non-existence of dharmas, they are also attached to the four marks, because they have not seen through and smashed them. They have not realized the emptiness of people, of dharmas, and of emptiness itself.Regarding that principle, the Buddha often said to the bhikùus, “You should know that the Dharma which I speak is like a raft.Ÿ The raft is used to cross the sea of suffering — birth and death. Before you have ended birth and death, you use the raft in cultivation. Once you have ended birth and death, you should put the raft aside. If you do not put the raft aside you have an attachment. If you do not put Dharma aside you have an attachment.Attachment to dharmas infects one like a disease. Using the dharma which teaches the emptiness of dharmas as medi-cine, the disease can be cured. Once cured, if a person fails to realize he is well and continues to take medicine, then he develops a senseless attachment to the medicine, and that amounts to yet another sickness. Those who have realized the emptiness of people and the emptiness of dharmas must also relinquish attachment to the non-existence of dharmas.The marks of dharmas should be cast aside. When one has ended birth and death one should put the dharmas aside. People and dharmas are empty. One should even cast aside true proper Dharma, how much the more so the non- existence of dharmas.

He said, “My idea of what the Buddha has said is that there is no such thing as Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi. There is no dharma by that name. There being none, what could be attained or what lost? Why is there no such dharma? Because there is no concrete dharma which the Tathàgata could speak. What the Tathàgata speaks of as Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi is nothing more than a name. In actuality even the name is empty and without independent existence. Since it basically does not exist what could be at-tained? What could be lost?The teaching is spoken because there are people. The medicine is prescribed because there is sickness. The Dharma which the Tathàgata speaks cannot be grasped. It is like sweeping the floor when it is dusty. Who speaks? Who sweeps?

Before everything has been put down, nothing can be picked up. It is necessary to put attachments down with the left hand and with the right hand pick up real mark praj¤à. But to say one can pick up praj¤à is just a figure of speech. That is not to say there is actually something which can be grasped with the hands. If one could grasp all of empty space in one fist, then one could grasp hold of real mark praj¤à. If unable to grasp all of empty space with one swipe of the hand, one should make no futile attempt to clutch at real mark praj¤à. Real mark praj¤à exhausts empty space and pervades the Dharmarealm. All things are basically within real mark praj¤à. How could a firmer grip than that be had?

By means of sixteen hearts one can cut off the eighty-eight categories of view delusion and certify to the truth.View delusions are the result of the greed and love which arise when viewing situations. Before one sees some-thing, one has no greed or love concerning it, but once the thing is seen, greed and love for it arise. The production of greed and love regarding states is termed view delusion.

When one completely attains the sixteenth heart, Subsequent Wisdom Regarding the Way, that is certification to the first fruit of Arhatship. It is called a Way of Liberation, for at that point delusion is completely severed and liberation is obtained.The first three stages of Arhatship, called fruit positions, are similar to unripened fruit on a tree.

Because he is not attached, he is given the title One of the First Fruit, or One Who has Entered the Flow. Neverthe-less, that is merely a name, not an actual substance.

A Sakçdàgàmin means one who returns once more, but he actually does not have a returning. For that reason, he is called a Sakçdàgàmin.ŸAfter øàkyamuni Buddha spoke about the first fruit, he knew that many people would wonder if the first fruit and the second fruit were different, whether the first fruit sage had no thought of certifying to the fruit, but the sage of the second fruit did have such a thought.One who has certified to the first stage Arhatship has seven more births and deaths to undergo. He is born seven times in the heavens and seven times among men.One of the second fruit, the Sakçdàgàmin, returns but once, being born once in the heavens and once among men.

Anàgàmin means one who does not return, but he actu-ally does not have no returning. For that reason, he is called Anàgàmin.ŸAgain øàkyamuni Buddha thought that perhaps people would consider the sage of the third fruit different from one of the first or second fruit, so he continued the discussion with Subhåti.An Anàgàmin is called One Who Does Not Return because he has cut off all thought delusion within the desire realm and no longer is compelled to be reborn in that realm.The second fruit Sakçdàgàmin must return once to the heavens and once among men before he cuts off the last three categories of his thought delusions in the desire realm.

Can an Arhat have the thought, ‘I have obtained Arhatship.’?ŸSubhåti said, “No World Honored One. And why? Actually there is no Dharma called an Arhat. World Honored One, if an arhat had the thought, I have at-tained Arhatship that would be attachment to self, to others, to living beings, and to a life. World Honored One, the Buddha says that in my attainment of the No Strife Samàdhi I am the foremost among men, that I am the foremost Arhat free from desire. World Honored One, I do not have the thought, ‘I am an Arhat free from desire.’ If I had the thought, ‘I have attained Arhatship’ then the World Honored One could not say, ‘Subhåti is the foremost of those who delight in practicing Araõa.’ Since Subhåti actually has no practice, he is called ‘Subhåti, who delights in practicing Araõa.’ŸArhat, a Sanskrit word, has three meanings: worthy of offerings, killer of thieves, without birth. Being a bhikùu is the cause for becoming an Arhat; becoming an Arhat is the result of having been a bhikùu. In the cause he is a mendicant. In the result he is one worthy of the offerings of gods and men. In the cause he is one who frightens Màra. In the result he is one who kills the thieves, the thieves of affliction. In the cause he is one who destroys evil. In the result he is one who is without birth.The Arhat of the Small Vehicle kills the thieves of affliction. The Bodhisattva should not only kill the thieves, but should also kill that which is not the thief, that is to say,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118ignorance. At the realization of Arhatship, ignorance is not considered a thief, but at the culmination of Bodhisattvahood it is, because of the realization that all affliction comes from ignorance.Although the Arhat has realized The Position of No Study, he still has ignorance. Even equal enlightenment Bodhi-sattvas still have one last particle of ignorance which acts as a thief and which Bodhisattvas recognize to be the greatest thief. Therefore it is said that they must kill that which for the Arhat is not a thief.Subhåti was asked if an Arhat can have the thought that he has obtained Arhatship, and he replied, “No, because although he has certified to the fruit of Arhatship, it is just a name and nothing more.Ÿ Not only upon certification to the fruit of Arhatship is there no realization, but even upon at-tainment of Buddhahood there is none. There is no tangible dharma which can be called Arhat. It is an empty name. If one thinks it exists, one has an attachment to dharmas and has not realized the emptiness of dharmas.If an Arhat did have the thought that he has obtained Arhatship, he would be attached to self, others, living beings, and a life. He would not have realized the emptiness of self or of dharmas, nor would he have obtained Arhatship. The thought of obtaining Arhatship carries with it the mark of self, which in turn produces its partner, the mark of others. Having the paired dharmas of self and others creates the mark of living beings, which in turn leads to the mark of a life. He would therefore be attached to the four marks."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119Subhåti again spoke to the Buddha saying, “World Honored One, the Buddha says I have obtained the No Strife Samàdhi.Ÿ Strife refers to debating and fighting. The Sixth Patriarch spoke of this:Debating — thoughts of victory and defeatStands in contradiction to the Way.Giving rise to the four-mark mind,How can samàdhi be obtained?In cultivating the Way one should not involve oneself in com-petition, fighting to be first or second. People who cultivate the Way should be like water. Lao Tzu said:Superior goodness is like water:Water benefits the myriad things and does not contend with them.It flows to places which repel mankind and thus it approximates the Way.“Water benefits the myriad things and does not contend with them.Ÿ Trees, flowers, and grasses need water to grow. People need water to live. Flying creatures drink water, and fish, turtles, shrimp, crabs, and the like also need water to survive. Those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, and by transformation all must have water. Water does not refuse to moisten any of the myriad things, nor does it bicker or bargain. “It flows to places which repel mankind and thus it approxi-mates the Way.Ÿ Water does not linger in the high mountains, but flows to the lowest places, unlike people who enjoy high"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120places and avoid low ones. Because it tends to flow towards the low places, water is in accord with the Way.Lao Tzu was a transformation body of the Venerable Mahàkà÷yapa. When the Buddha entered the world, he saw that living beings in China committed many offenses and did not rely on the Dharma to cultivate, so he sent Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Yen Hui to China to teach and transform living beings. All three were transformation-bodies of Bodhi-sattvas.Lao Tzu introduced the concept of the unconditioned to the Chinese people. If one can understand unconditioned dharma, one can then come to understand that which is not unconditioned. The Buddhadharma speaks of that which is unconditioned and yet not unconditioned. The Sixth Patriarch said “Debating — thoughts of victory and defeat — stands in contradiction to the Way.Ÿ Suppose in cultivating the Way you should go south, but because you like to argue you go north instead. Perhaps you should go east but you rebel and go west. When you argue, you are in opposition to the Way. “Giving rise to the four-mark mindŸ means producing the marks of self, of others, of living beings, and of a life. “How can samàdhi be obtained?Ÿ The No Strife Samàdhi is having no thoughts of victory or defeat.The Buddha says that Subhåti is the foremost Arhat apart from desire.

Separating from desire one obtains the No Strife Samàdhi and becomes pure. If one has not left desire he cannot obtain the No Strife Samàdhi — the bliss of purity.Subhåti said to the Buddha, “World Honored One, I do not have the thought that I am one who has obtained the No Strife Samàdhi, or that I have certified to Arhatship, or that I am number one among men — the foremost Arhat free from desire. Why?

Why? Because if I had such a thought, just that would be contention and impurity and would not be freedom from desire. That too would be a false thought.“But because I am actually without practice — I do not actually ‘do’ anything — I am not attached to anything. I am not attached to self or to dharmas; since I do not arrogantly say ‘I have obtained Arhatship, I am pure and do not fight.

On that occasion, øàkyamuni Buddha was walking on the road and saw in the distance the bhikùu Burning Lamp Buddha walking toward him. øàkyamuni Buddha also saw that on the road between them was a large puddle of muddy water. Because he cultivated as a Bodhi-sattva and dedicated himself to helping everyone, he realized that the bhikùu coming toward him would be hampered by the puddle; and lay down in the muddy water to serve as a bridge for the bhikùu. But the puddle was large and his body did not entirely span it.

That means you do not broadcast your good deeds to insure that whatever merit and virtue may have accrued be properly credited. Such a heart is impure. It is dirty. If you have the thought of self and others when you do virtuous acts to adorn Buddhalands, then there are no virtuous acts and there is no adornment.

The analogy is being extended several thousands of ten thousands of times.Subhåti said that although the blessings and virtues derived from giving that amount of the seven precious gems would be many, they would be the reward of conditioned blessings, that is, blessings and virtue with outflows. Anything conditioned eventually becomes extinct, and the presence of outflows keeps one bound to non-ultimate states.The Buddha then spoke of a man, or woman, who cultivates the five precepts and ten good acts, and who receives and holds the Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità Såtra — anywhere from lecturing the entire Vajra Såtra to receiving and holding no more than one of its four-line gàthàs. To receive refers to ac-ceptance in the heart; to hold refers to practice with the body — that is, truly to listen and then to offer up your conduct. First you receive it with your heart. For example, the Såtra says a Bodhisattva should leave all marks in order to obtain Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi. You ponder that in your heart:"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131“Ah, a Bodhisattva must leave all marks must mean he must not be attached to the mark of self, the mark of dharmas, or to the mark of emptiness.Ÿ Once your heart understands you ac tually undertake its practice. You give without the mark of self, others, or the mark of a life span in between. Your giving is devoid of attachment to the giver, the recipient, or the gift given. You perform meritorious deeds without involving your-self in the mark of performing meritorious deeds.Perhaps you receive and hold this four-line gàthà:There is no mark of self,And no mark of others,No mark of living beings,And no mark of a life.You encounter someone and say, “The Vajra Såtra says that we should be without a mark of self. We should not see “meŸ as so important, nor should we be involved in the existence of “you,Ÿ or the mark of “others.Ÿ If we have no self or others, then there is no mark of living beings, and thus no mark of a life.ŸThe person listens and thinks, “Oh, you have to sepa-rate from all marks.ŸOne who can leave all marks is a Bodhisattva. A Bodhisattva does not say “I did that act of merit. I have this much virtue. I built a monastery. I printed that Såtra.Ÿ He is devoid of such marks; that is, he truly forgets them.

If no one asks, you don’t have to volunteer all the details of your most recent meritorious deed. But if you print the såtra and forget it, so that when it’s done, it’s done, then there is no mark. However, although you forget it, no merit and virtue exist. When you have no outflows, the merit and virtue have no outflows. If you have outflows, the merit and virtue also have outflows. If you can understand unconditioned dharmas, your merit and virtue also become unconditioned.Perhaps you chose the lines which say:If one sees me in form,If one seeks me in sound,He practices a deviant way,And cannot see the Tathàgata.This gàthà is in the latter portion of the Vajra Såtra. The Buddha himself spoke it, and so the me refers to øàkyamuni Buddha. If one sings a fine song for the Buddha and searches for him in that way, he cannot perceive the Tathàgata’s Dharma body. Earlier in the Såtra the Buddha asked, “If a body were as big as Mount Sumeru, would that body be big?ŸSubhåti first replied that it would be very big and after-ward said, “It is spoken of by the Buddha as no body: there-fore it is called a big body.Ÿ What is a no body? It is not a body."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133If it is not a body, what is it? If it is not a body how can it be called a big body? No body refers to the Dharma body. The Buddha’s Dharma body is incomparable. If you have a body as big as Mt. Sumeru it is still comparable to Mt. Sumeru. Even if it is bigger than Mt. Sumeru it can still be compared to it. The Dharma body is beyond compare. Matchless. There is only one and not two. There is no second thing. That is a big body. The no body is the Dharma body, not the reward body. In the Buddha’s teaching, the Dharma body is the true Buddha. So it is said, “This offering is made to the pure Dharma body Vairocana Buddha.Ÿ Vairocana Buddha pervades all places. “...to the perfect full reward body Rocana Buddha... to the millions of transformation bodies, øàkyamuni Buddha.Ÿ The reward body and the transformation bodies are not true Buddhas.

The blessings and virtue you obtain from speaking for others, even but four lines, are more than those obtained from the gift of as many of the seven precious gems as would fill three thousand great thousand world systems equal to the number of grains of sand in as many Ganges Rivers as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. Why? This merit and virtue is conditioned, merit and virtue with outflows, which has a mark.

All actually refers to all beings in the six paths of rebirth: gods, men, asuras, animals, hungry ghosts, and beings in the hells. However only gods, men, and asuras are specifically mentioned in the passage of Såtra text, because it is not easy for beings in the three evil paths to make offerings to the Triple Jewel.The world. There are two kinds of worlds, the sentient world, and the material world. The sentient world includes all beings with sentience, who have breath and blood. What lacks breath and blood is called insentient. The material world includes rooms, porches, halls, houses, mountains, rivers, the great earth, all the ten thousand things.The sentient world is also called proper retribution. Why does the world exist? Because sentient beings exist. If there were no living beings there would be no world. The material world is insentient, and since the insentient depends upon the sentient, it is called the dependent retribution. Proper retribu-tion refers to beings undergoing their appropriate retributions, as is the case with the people who live in the world. Proper and dependent retributions form the world.Gods refers to beings in the heavens. Men refers to people in the world. Asuras may be found among animals and among men, as well as among gods, and are described as beings who like to fight. For example, gods who war against the heavenly generals are asuras.

People refuse to sell asuras alcohol knowing that if asuras become drunk they beat up other people. The asura’s situation is one of having the blessings of the gods, but lacking their authority. In other words, they merit the reward of the heavens, but they lack the virtuous conduct of gods.How does one become an asura?Those who constantly seek revenge become asuras. For instance, if someone uses one sentence to scold you, you retort with two sentences to put him down. If some one hits you with one fist, you smash him back with both of yours. In general, you want to pay back double, and by acting that way when you fight, you quickly become an asura.When someone speaks, a four-line gàthà of the Såtra, not only should people come to make offerings, but gods should come as well.What does it mean to make offerings?There are offerings which are made to the Buddha, of-ferings which are made to the Dharma, and offerings which are made to the Sa¤gha. Offerings to the Buddha include placing incense, f lowers, lamps, fruit, adornments, or perhaps tea or water before a Buddha image. Offerings to the Dharma refers to the careful protection of the Dharma. When reading"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138såtras you should not be sloppy or casual. When you are not reading them you should not just carelessly lay them aside. You should have a specific place designated for såtras, and when you place them there you should do so very gently and respectfully, laying them squarely so that no corners extend beyond the edge of a table. Anyone who has opened his Buddha eye can see that wherever a såtra is not securely placed, Wei T’ou Bodhisattva comes and stands, patiently holding up the corner of the såtra with his hand.Also, placing the såtra in an unclean place is disre-spectful and cannot be considered an offering to the Dharma. Buddhist såtras should be placed above all secular books. You should have the same regard for såtras as for your own body and life. If you tear, or rip up såtras or heedlessly burn them, you will be so stupid in future lives that you won’t be able to remember anything no matter how many times people attempt to teach you. The same retribution befalls those who are stingy with the Dharma. For instance, in a former life Ani-ruddha endured the retribution of extreme stupidity because prior to that he had known the Dharma and had refused to speak it for others. Later he planted many good roots, so when he met øàkyamuni Buddha he certified to the fruit of Arhatship. If you destroy såtras there is no telling when you will again see a Buddha. In the future you will be stupid and subject to unthinkably many additional retributions.Offerings to the Sa¤gha vary according to country and custom.

Medicines may be given as an offering and stored until the need for them arises.People who are at home should make these offerings. People who have left the home life receive them. Since Sa¤gha members receive offerings in that way, they cultivate the Three Recollections and Five Contemplations as they take their daily meal. Actually, members of the lay community as well as members of the Sa¤gha should practice the Three Recollections as they eat.With the first bite of food one thinks, “I vow to cut off all evil.Ÿ The vow precludes giving rise to any evil thought, not to mention doing evil deeds. With the second bite of food one thinks, “I vow to cultivate all good.Ÿ You should not just mechanically recite the vows and consider that sufficient.

How come he gets to eat better food than I do?Ÿ You should not give rise to such greed. Instead you should be mindful of Five Contemplations:1. Reckon the amount of work it took to bring the food to where you eat it.Figure out how much work the farmer did to plant the fields, and the amount of manual labor needed to cultivate, weed, nourish, and water the crops as they ripened. When ripe the rice had to be harvested and the chaff had to be sepa-rated from the grain. Through this contemplation you come to realize it was not easy to bring the food to your bowl.2. Consider whether your virtuous conduct is suf-ficient for you to accept the offering.Ask yourself, “Do I have any cultivation? Do I have any Way virtue?

Vajra is so durable it cannot be destroyed by anything, but can itself destroy everything.“If vajra breaks up everything, then I won’t have any-thing, and of what use will that be?Ÿ you may ask.The reason you don’t realize Buddhahood is just because you “have everything.Ÿ If you didn’t have anything, you could realize Buddhahood. “EverythingŸ refers to your attachments — all those things you cannot put down.What is the source of everything?Things come from recognizing the existence of marks. Whatever has marks has form and appearance and will change and become extinct. That which has no mark is without form and appearance and will neither change nor become extinct. No one can destroy that which has no mark. No mark is no thought, and no thought is the basic substance of the ten thousand dharmas. If you can reach the realization of no thought, you have returned to the source.Durable vajra breaks through thought, but not through no thought.

If they had reached the state of no thought themselves, then they would not be heavenly demons and those of external ways. But because they have thought, they exist in form, create dharmas with outflows, and plant causes with outflows. The durability of vajra can break through all such outflowing dharmas and causes.Vajra is luminous. Its light can break up all darkness. Vajra is able to cut. A sharp knife can sever something with a single slice, while a dull knife saws and saws and still cannot cut through. Vajra functions like a keen blade as it slashes through deviations to reveal the orthodox. Vajra severs all the deviant knowledge and views of heavenly demons and those of external ways, chops through people’s afflictions, and slices through ignorance.Vajra is an analogy. Praj¤à Pàramità is a dharma. Thus the title of the Såtra is established by reference to dharma and analogy.There are Three Kinds of Praj¤à: literary praj¤à; con-templative praj¤à; and real mark praj¤à. Literary praj¤à refers to the såtras. With literary praj¤à you can give rise to contem-plative praj¤à, which in turn enables one to penetrate through to real mark praj¤à. Real mark is no mark, but is not without marks. It is no mark and not without marks.Although essentially there is but one kind of praj¤à, it may be divided into the three aspects, literary, contemplative, and real mark. Praj¤à is a denotation for a basic substance which is itself empty, which is itself false, and which is itself"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147the Middle Way. Without attachment to it, it is empty. Without attachment to emptiness it is false. Abiding in the emptiness and falseness without attachment is the Middle Way.The term Praj¤à is not translated because it includes many meanings.Pàramità means to arrive at the other shore. Arriving at the other shore means completing whatever task you are doing. For example, when a common person cultivates to attainment of the Buddha position, he is said to have arrived at the other shore. The other shore is opposite this shore. If this shore did not exist, the other shore would not exist either. This shore refers to birth and death, and the other shore refers to nirvàõa. Completing the crossing from this shore of birth and death over the sea of afflictions to the other shore of nirvàõa is called pàramità.“You, Subhåti, Empty Born, you should use the name Vajra Praj¤à Pàramità and pay the highest respect to this såtra, as if you were constantly holding it atop your head.Ÿ Protecting and respecting Buddhist såtras is the same as respecting the Buddha himself. Why? A previous passage of the Såtra text said, “In any place where the Såtra is found, it is as if there were a Buddha there.Ÿ Any place this Såtra is found there can be found the Buddha’s Dharma body, the Buddhadharma, and the Sa¤gha. For that reason you should venerate it."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"14 8“Subhåti, Praj¤à Pàramità is spoken of by the Buddha... .Ÿ In order to comply with the needs of beings, the Buddha spoke of the existence of praj¤à pàramità.

The Buddha spoke Dharma and at the same time asked Subhåti if he had spoken any Dharma. How should he be answered? Subhåti told him that he had not spoken Dharma. Subhåti probably took one look and understood the principle of emptiness. He was called Empty Born because he was foremost in understanding empti-ness, so he understood that with true, real praj¤à it is not the case that anything is spoken. So he said, “There is nothing spoken. The Tathàgata has not spoken anything.ŸMost people are unable to comprehend this passage of text. Clearly the Buddha spoke Dharma, and yet he asked if he had spoken Dharma. Subhåti, moreover, replied that he had not spoken Dharma. What is the meaning of that?øàkyamuni Buddha and Subhåti were discoursing on true, real praj¤à. Since true, real praj¤à does not reside in a framework of language, what can be spoken? The empty mark of all dharmas is beyond words and speech. The Buddha spoke Dharma for forty-nine years and when the time of his nirvàõa arrived, he said that he had not spoken one word. He said, “If anyone says the Tathàgata has spoken Dharma, he slanders the Buddha because he has been unable to under-stand what I have said.Ÿ“Since the Buddha did not speak Dharma, why are there so many såtras spoken by the Buddha?Ÿ one may rightly ask."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150The answer to that lies in the doctrine of speaking conditioned Dharma for people bound to conditions and speaking uncon-ditioned Dharma for people who dwell in the unconditioned.The Vajra Såtra says, “Even dharmas should be relin-quished, how much the more so no dharmas.Ÿ The Buddha said he had not spoken Dharma because he was concerned that people would become attached to the mark of Dharma. Being attached to Dharma is the same as being attached to self. People’s attachment to emptiness must also be broken. When the Dharma door of praj¤à is spoken, even emptiness must not become an attachment.“Subhåti, what do you think? Are all motes of dust in three thousand great thousand worlds many?Ÿ Motes of dust refers to invisible particles of dust which verge on emptiness. If a visible mote of dust is divided into seven parts, one of those sevenths is called a “particle of dust verging on emptiness.Ÿ It is the same as empty space. For instance, in empty space there are many dust motes too small to be seen by the naked eye. They are examples of particles of dust verging on emptiness. So the Buddha asked if the minute particles as well as ordinary visible motes of dust in a three thousand great thousand world were many.Subhåti replied, “Very many.Ÿ “The dust is spoken of by the Tathàgata as no dust.Ÿ From the point of view of the real mark, the Middle Way, they are said to be motes of dust.

In actual fact, “motes of dustŸ is just a name.The world systems are spoken of by the Tathàgata as no world systems... . Pa rticles of dust verging on emptiness make up the world. A mote of dust is the smallest form of de-pendent retribution. A world is the largest form of dependent retribution. The largest dependent retribution comes about from a collection of the very smallest forms of dependent retribution. The world exists because great quantities of dust motes collect together. If the motes of dust were separated the world would disappear. So the world systems are spoken of by the Tathàgata as no world systems, therefore they are called world systems. The doctrine above does not go beyond the empty, false, and Middle. Recognizing the empti-ness of all dharmas is actual truth. Recognizing the falseness of all dharmas is common truth. Recognizing that all dharmas are neither empty nor false is the truth of the Middle Way. Fur-thermore, throughout the present discourse on praj¤à, nothing has been spoken. It is just as when Subhåti eloquently spoke praj¤à and the Brahmà Heaven King listened well to praj¤à, until finally Subhåti asked him, “What have I said?ŸTo which the Brahmà god replied, “The Venerable One has not spoken.Ÿ“Well, what have you heard?Ÿ pursued Subhåti. “I also did not hear a thing,Ÿ came the reply. “That is true praj¤à.Ÿ confirmed Subhåti."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152When nothing is spoken and nothing is heard, that is called true praj¤à.

When øàkyamuni Buddha was cultivating the Way he gave up his body to a tiger and cut off his flesh for an eagle. Once when cultivating in the moun-tains in a former life, øàkyamuni Buddha saw a mother tiger and her cub in the snow. Because of heavy snows, the other animals had hidden away, and the tiger could find no prey to supply herself with food and drink. Both she and her cub were about to die of starvation. The cultivator realized that if the one starved two would die, and he made a vow to give his body to the tiger to eat. Think of that. A tiger is a vicious beast. Who would want to sacrifice his own body to such an animal? However, øàkyamuni Buddha lay down before the tiger and allowed himself to be eaten.Another time when øàkyamuni Buddha was cultivating the Way on the causal ground, one day a little bird ran into his hut terrorized by a huge eagle which was pursuing it. “Save me! Save me!Ÿ cried the little bird, “That eagle wants to eat me!Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154“How can I save you?Ÿ asked øàkyamuni Buddha.“If you save him I will starve to death,Ÿ shrieked the eagle. “If you save one life and kill another that is no compassion.ŸWhen øàkyamuni Buddha heard the eagle’s plea, he cut off a piece of his own flesh and gave it to the great bird to eat. The eagle downed it in no time and came back for more. He ate yet another piece and still was not full. He continued to come back for more until finally the Buddha said, “All right, you may have my entire body.Ÿ The bird then picked his bones clean.Formerly øàkyamuni Buddha went to extremes of giving in his search for the Buddha Way. But in the present time, if people give even a little money, their hearts ache, their liver hurts, and their whole body is wracked with pain.“I gave two hundred dollars and could not sleep for three nights straight.Ÿ they moan. “It took me a whole week to earn that much and it will be another week before I see another two hundred.Ÿ They keep very accurate books.“Can we keep sloppy books, then?Ÿ you may ask. No. You should not keep sloppy books either. øàkyamuni Buddha did not keep track of such deeds when he was on the causal ground, and as a result he realized Buddhahood. The very reason you have not realized Buddhahood is that you are interested in keeping your books too clearly.When øàkyamuni Buddha was on the causal ground he gave up a thousand bodies to rescue and take living beings across.

That is also considered giving up one’s body and life.The blessings and virtues of a person who accepts, maintains, and speaks for others even as few as four lines of verse from the Såtra are greater than the blessings of someone who gives up his body and life as many times as there are grains of sand in the River Ganges.

Why did he say that? Because giving body and life can at best save another’s life and body, but does not thereby cause another to return to the origin — to turn back to his original face, his originally existent Dharma body. However, speaking Dharma for another can cause him to turn his back on the dust, unite with enlightenment, and realize Buddhahood. A living being’s Dharma body has thereby been saved, and consequently the merit and virtue is incomparable."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"157Then Subhåti, upon hearing the Såtra spoken, and deeply understanding its purport... Subhåti, completely under-standing the meaning and implications of the doctrine of no mark expressed in the Vajra Såtra, wept. Tears flowed from his eyes and his nose ran. Usually people cry when they are sad or worried or when something unfortunate happens, but occasionally they also cry from joy, just as Subhåti then did. “Extreme happiness brings sorrow.Ÿ The Buddha expressed the depths of praj¤à so thoroughly that Subhåti was overjoyed at being able to hear the specific teaching, the wonderful Dharma door of praj¤à. Subhåti realized that his former contentment with the Small Vehicle dharmas had been misguided. His awakening may be thus expressed:“Upon realization, I do not reproach myself for the past;I know that in the future I can rectify mistakes. Aware that I am not too far down the muddled path,I have now awakened to today’s rights and yesterday’s wrongs.ŸThe Small Vehicle was Subhåti’s “muddled pathŸ and his further awakening indicates that his former attachment to Small Vehicle dharmas had not been very great, he had “not gone too far down the muddled path.Ÿ“Awakened to today’s rights and yesterday’s wrongsŸ means he had realized it was right for him to seek the Great Vehicle"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"158Dharma, and that his former fondness for the Sound-Hearer fruit of the Small Vehicle had been a mistake.

This second exclamation of “how rareŸ regards the Såtra. Subhåti means to say, “There-has never before been such a såtra, World Honored One. It is very rare. The Såtra which our Original Teacher øàkyamuni Buddha now speaks is so profound that it is difficult for those of the Small Vehicle to comprehend.Ÿ“From the time I obtained the wisdom eye...Ÿ Disciple Subhåti followed øàkyamuni Buddha to study the Buddha-dharma and obtained the wisdom eye. The wisdom eye may refer to one of the Five Eyes, and may also refer to using wisdom as one’s eyes, rather than blindly following along with the crowd. If the blind lead the blind then none can find the Way. Those who lack wisdom are led about blindly. Those with the wisdom eye distinguish right from wrong, black from white, and Dharma from what is not Dharma. Subhåti said, “All the wisdom I have obtained since I first began to cultivate the Way does not measure up to the praj¤à which øàkyamuni Buddha now speaks.Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"159Subhåti further said, “I believe what I hear.

His realization is ultimate and his merit and virtue incomparable. Why? Because he has unified his heart of faith and relinquished all doubts. It is by his total belief that he obtains the principle and substance of real mark, and he thus is very rare, foremost.“World Honored One, the real mark is no mark, therefore the Tathàgata calls it the real mark. “World Honored One, now as I hear this Såtra I believe, understand, receive, and hold it without difficulty.

The mark of others, the mark of living beings, and the mark of a life are no marks. And why?

If he had lacked good roots, then upon hearing the wonderful Dharma of praj¤à his faith would have been defiled by doubts and skepticism. However, in the past he had made offerings to limitless Buddhas and had planted all good roots of which there are eleven kinds:1. faith;2. shame;3. remorse. You would do well to produce a heart of shame and remorse, recognizing your own wrongdoings and changing the bad to good. In that way you plant good roots. Lack of shame and remorse indicates a lack of good roots;4. absence of greed;5. absence of hostility;6. absence of stupidity;7. v i g or ;8. tranquility, which refers to the light ease of sitting in dhyàna;9. non-laxity, which means not being careless or lazy, not running wild and being too casual.

He realized, however, that anyone in the Dharma Ending Age, at the time when people are Strong in Fighting, who could believe, understand, receive, and hold the Såtra would be a foremost individual and, very rare. And why? Such people will. Have no mark of self, meaning they have no greed. No mark of others, meaning they have no anger. No mark of living beings, meaning they are not stupid. No mark of a life, meaning they have no desire. They have no greed, anger, stupidity, or desire — these four kinds of attachments. The four marks are without a mark. No mark is real mark. Real mark is no mark. And why? Because real mark is also distinct from all which has no marks. If you can obtain real mark, that is obtaining the principle substance of the self-nature of all Buddhas. Those who have relinquished all marks are called Buddhas.

There is none. Therefore it is called the pàramità of patience, From the point of view of the Middle Way the pàramità of patience is a name and nothing more.Why is the pàramità of patience said to be devoid of patience? “Subhåti, it is just as when I, on the causal ground, had my body dismembered by the King of Kali¤ga.Ÿ Long before in a former life, øàkyamuni Buddha had been a young cultivator practicing in the mountains about thirty miles from the capital city where the King of Kali¤ga held court. One day the King decided to go hunting and called together a party of soldiers, ministers, and officials to accompany him. To complete the party he summoned the most beautiful con-cubines in the palace. Actually he could not bear to part with his women for even the duration of a hunting trip. He found them a most pleasant pastime.The hunting grounds on the mountain were very large, and the King of Kali¤ga immediately set out in pursuit of big game, leaving the timid women behind to entertain them-selves. As the women strolled around on the mountain, they happened upon the young bhikùu who was only eighteen or nineteen years old and quite handsome, despite the fact that his hair had grown long and his clothes were tattered. When they first spied him they thought he was a kind of weird crea-"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"166ture or a man-eating beast, and they panicked. “Look,Ÿ they gasped, clutching one another, “there’s a wild animal that looks like a man!Ÿ“I am not a wild animal, I am a cultivator of the Way,Ÿ the young man assured them.When the concubines heard that the creature could talk their curiosity was aroused, and they edged closer to speak with him. “What does it mean to ‘cultivate the Way’Ÿ they asked, for they had never been outside the confines of the palace, and so had never heard of such a thing. The young cultivator spoke Dharma for them. Seeing what they had never seen before, and hearing what they had never heard before, soon they were enthralled and forgot everything — even who and where they were.Meanwhile the King of Kali¤ga returned from his ex-pedition to discover that his palace concubines had wandered away. He set out to find them. Eventually he caught sight of them gathered around the strange-looking man. The King, bent on discovering who the man was and what he was doing with the concubines, crept silently towards them like a spy on a secret mission. When he got close he paused, listened to the young cultivator speaking Dharma, and realized that the con-cubines were so enraptured they had not noticed the arrival of their king. Whereupon the King of Kali¤ga cleared his throat and challenged the young man, “What are you doing here?Ÿ“I am cultivating the Way,Ÿ replied the bhikùu. “Have you attained the fruit of Arhatship in your cultivation?Ÿ asked the king."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"167“No,Ÿ said the young cultivator, “I have not certified to Arhatship.Ÿ“Have you attained the third stage?Ÿ continued the king.“No,Ÿ said the bhikùu, “I have not certified to the third fruit.Ÿ“I’ve heard there are people who live in the mountains and by eating a certain kind of fruit they attain immortality, but they still are not free of greed and desire. They still have lust in their hearts. You are so young and you haven’t certified to any of the fruits of the Way. Do you give rise to thoughts of lust?Ÿ asked the king.“I have not cut it off.Ÿ replied the bhikùu.With that reply the King of Kali¤ga became enraged. “If you haven’t cut off lust, then when you see my... these women... you see them like this... how can you be patient with the lust which arises in your heart?Ÿ he challenged.“Although I have not cut off lust, I do not give rise to lustful thoughts. In my cultivation I contemplate the nine kinds of impurities.Ÿ“Ha!Ÿ spat back the king, “You cultivate the contem-plation of impurities. You are a cheat! What proof do I havethat you do not lust after my women? What proof that youcan bear your thoughts of lust?Ÿ“I bear them.Ÿ replied the bhikùu. “I can bear any thing.Ÿ“Oh you can, can you?

How do you know?Ÿ demanded their king, bristling with jealousy. “Look at him,Ÿ said the officials, “you cut off his ear and he did nothing. He has not even flushed. He just sits there as if nothing had happened.Ÿ“How do you know that he feels as if nothing had happened? I wager in his heart he hates me.

It is more likely that you are a liar as well as a cheat. Perhaps you can cheat these women, but you can’t cheat me. I shall cut off your hand and see what you do. Can you bear it?Ÿ His voice shook as lie brought down the sword again.“It is all the same to me.Ÿ said the bhikùu.“All right, if it is all the same, then I shall cut off your other hand,Ÿ which he did, saying with barely controlled rage, “Still not angry? Are you enraged yetŸ“No, I am not enraged.Ÿ said the bhikùu.“I don’t believe you. Nobody could stand to have both hands cut off and not get angry. You are certainly a freak.Ÿ he said as he cut off one of the bhikùu’s legs. “Still not angry?Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"169The king chopped away at the other leg. “Angry?Ÿ he nearly screamed once more.The maimed bhikùu continued to sit as before, although now both his ears, his nose, both his hands, and both legs were totally severed from his body. “I am not angry,Ÿ he said once again.But by then the Four Great Heaven Kings were angry, and cursing the king, they sent down a rain of hailstones the size of dumplings. The hail beat down so violently that a section of the mountain near the party fell away and went roaring down the slopes. The king froze with fear upon real-izing his mistake. He knelt before the earless, noseless, hand-less, legless bhikùu and begged forgiveness. “I was wrong, I was wrong,Ÿ he cried in terror. “Heaven is punishing me. Do not be angry, please do not be angry.Ÿ“I have not become angry,Ÿ said the bhikùu.“That’s not true,Ÿ cried the panic-stricken king. “If you are not angry, why is heaven punishing me?Ÿ He still thought the bhikùu had called down a curse on him.“I can prove that I have not become angry,Ÿ said the bhikùu. “If I have, then the extremities of my body will not mend. But if I have not become angry, then my hands, legs, ears, and nose will grow back the way they were.Ÿ No sooner had he finished speaking than his legs, hands, ears, and nose perfectly rejoined the trunk of his body. When he was whole again the bhikùu made a solemn dedication to the king, “Upon realizing Buddhahood I will take you across first.Ÿ"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"170Later when the young cultivator was reborn as a young prince who realized the Way and became øàkyamuni Buddha, he first went to the Deer Park to take across the former King of Kali¤ga, the Venerable âj¤àtakauõóinya.After hearing that account, some people may say, “I think I shall find a bhikùu who practices patience in the mountains and cut off his ears, nose, hands, and legs. Then he will make the vow to take me across when he first realizes Buddhahood.Ÿ That plan would be fine if you were assured of meeting a cultivator with a compassionate, patient heart like øàkyamuni Buddha’s. However, if the cultivator gave rise to one thought of anger while you were slicing away at him, then you would fall into the unintermittent hells. So you had better think twice before attempting that method. Besides, you are not a king. If you were a king you might manage it.øàkyamuni Buddha referred to his encounter with the King of Kali¤ga at that point in order to remind Subhåti that he understood the pàramità of patience. “When the King of Kali¤ga dismembered my body, I had no mark of self, no mark of others, no mark of living beings and no mark of a life.Ÿ“And why? When I was cut limb from limb, if I had had a mark of self, a mark of others, a mark of living beings, or a mark of a life, I would have been outraged.“Subhåti, further I recall that in the past, for five hundred lives, I was the patient immortal. During all those lives I had no mark of self, no mark of others, no"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"171mark of living beings, and no mark of a life. For that reason, Subhåti, a Bodhisattva should, relinquishing all marks, produce the heart of Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi. He should produce that heart without dwelling in forms, he should produce that heart without dwelling in sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, or dharmas. He should produce that heart which does not dwell anywhere, any dwelling of the heart is no dwelling. Therefore the Buddha says, ‘the heart of a Bodhisattva should not dwell in forms when he gives.’Subhåti, a Bodhisattva, to benefit all beings, should give thus. All marks are spoken of by the Tathàgata as no marks, and all living beings are spoken of as no living beings. Subhåti, the Tathàgata is one who speaks the truth, who speaks the actual, who speaks what is so, who does not speak what is false, who does not speak what is not so.ŸIf you harbor a view of self, you can become angry. With no self there is no anger. Because the Buddha had no anger, his four limbs grew back. Had he become angry his affirmation would not have been efficacious....for five hundred lives I was the Patient Immortal. The Buddha points out that for five hundred lifetimes he was able to endure all kinds of suffering and face any difficult situation, all because he had no attachment to the four marks.A Bodhisattva should, relinquishing all marks, produce the heart of Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi. He should give"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172rise to the Unsurpassed, Proper and Equal, Right Enlighten-ment. He should not attach to dwelling in the six dust-realms. Giving rise to a heart which is not attached to anything, one experiences the unobstructed perfect fusion of all things.Any dwelling of the heart... that is, if your heart becomes involved in attachments ...is no dwelling. To say it is no dwell-ing is not the same as the “not dwellingŸ referred to in the line ‘He should produce that heart without dwelling anywhere.’ What is meant here is that anything on which the heart may rely is not true and actual. In other words, if you have an attachment, you have a mark of self, others, living beings,and a life.For that reason a Bodhisattva’s heart should not be attached to forms when giving. Bodhisattvas cultivate the six pàramitàs and the ten thousand practices. Giving is the first of the six pàramitàs. There are three kinds of giving: giving wealth, giving Dharma, and giving fearlessness.1. The gift of wealth is a gift to the living which does not transcend the present life.2. The gift of Dharma may take place when you meet a living being who is free of animosity and has no desire to harm you. Then you may speak Dharma and cause him to awaken to the unconditioned. If you can also cause such a living being to leave behind all fear and trembling, you are practicing the pàramità of holding precepts within the pàramità of giving. Or you may encounter a living being who"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"173wants to harm you, and by speaking Dharma you enable him to conquer his anger and hatred. If you can enable someone who displays enmity or resentment toward you or who wishes you harm to abandon aggression, you have used the pàramità of patience to perfect your giving.Perhaps you tirelessly benefit people and are not the least bit lazy in teaching and transforming living beings, and enjoy speaking Dharma for whomever you see. To resolve that “Whatever Buddhadharma I know I will speak for others without regard for the acceptance or rejection of my teachingŸ is not to fear fatigue and suffering. That is to employ the pàramità of vigor in practicing giving.Perhaps your speaking of Dharma is extremely well organized. You never confuse summations, scramble lists, or muddle principles. In listing the pàramitàs you are able to speak them in their proper sequence: giving, holding precepts, patience, vigor, dhyàna samàdi, and praj¤à. If in lecturing you encounter a reference to the Five Roots and Five Powers, as for example when they appear in the Amitàbha Såtra, you are able to explain them correctly as: 1. faith, 2. vigor, 3. mindfulness, 4. samàdhi, and 5. wisdom, rather than con-fusing them and explaining them as the six dusts, such orderly correct speaking of Dharma is an example of the use of the pàramità of dhyàna samàdhi in giving. If someone asks you a question and you become flustered and say, “Uhhh, I don’t know...Ÿ then your skill in dhyàna samàdhi is wanting.However, even those with samàdhi need wisdom. Wisdom enhances the development of eloquence so that"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174“left and right the source is revealed, the Way is clear and straightforward.Ÿ No matter how you speak, you reveal the essence of the principle, because your wisdom is unobstructed. That is, you use the pàramità of praj¤à wisdom in your giving.Thus the three aspects of giving, the giving of wealth, the giving of Dharma, and the giving of fearlessness encom-pass the six pàramitàs.The Buddha again instructed Subhåti, “In order for a Bodhisattva to benefit living beings, he should give as I have previously stated, while not dwelling anywhere. The object of the Buddhadharma is to rid people of attachments. “Let the gentle breeze and the bright moon come as they may.Ÿ Let. things come naturally, do not be attached. By attaching to marks when giving, you cultivate the rewards of the heavens. To cultivate the Buddha-fruit you should not attach to marks. But you must truly and actually do it. You cannot say, “I am not attached to marks. There is really nothing at all! I don’t need to do anything.Ÿ To think like that is to fall into false emptiness.All marks are spoken of by the Tathàgata as no marks. Basically all marks are devoid of marks. ...and all living beings are spoken of as no living beings. Originally their self-nature is Buddha. But now, because they are confused, they are living beings. Once enlightened they become Buddhas. If you use the Buddhadharma to teach and transform living beings, in the future all of them can return to the origin and realize Buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"176Lest his words cause people to become frightened, ter-rified, or doubtful, øàkyamuni Buddha assured Subhåti, “The Tathàgata’s words are true and honest. They are frank and to the point.Ÿ The Buddha does not lie. Everything he says con-tains the principle of true suchness. The Tathàgata does not speak false words, nor does he expound strange and weird principles designed to arouse panic and alarm in the hearts of his listeners.“Subhåti, the Dharma obtained by the Tathàgata is neither true nor false.“Subhåti, a Bodhisattva whose heart dwells in dharmas when he gives is like a man who enters dark-ness, who cannot see a thing. A Bodhisattva whose heart does not dwell in dharmas when he gives is like a man with eyes in the bright sunlight who can see all kinds of forms.“Subhåti, in the future, if a good man, or good woman, can receive, hold, read, and recite this Såtra, then the Tathàgata by means of all Buddha-wisdom, will completely know and see that person. That person accom-plishes measureless and boundless merit and virtue.ŸThe real Dharma which the Tathàgata has obtained is true, real wisdom neither true nor false.

True emptiness does not obstruct wonderful existence, wonderful existence does not obstruct true emptiness. So the Dharma is neither true nor false. That means there is no attachment to marks. Abandoning the attachment to marks is the principle of true emptiness and wonderful existence. If the Bodhisattva cultivating the Way finds it necessary to attach to conditioned dharmas, his giving will remain within the confines of the attachment to marks. Such conditioned giving can only bring birth in the heavens or birth among men as its reward.Conditioned giving which reaps a heavenly blessingResembles brandishing a sword in empty space;Just as when the arm grows tired the sword must fall,Subsequent lives will fail to sustain such heights.Those who only know how to cultivate blessings and do not know how to cultivate the Way, will descend among men when their heavenly reward has ended, and there be compelled to endure more suffering.

Furthermore, he gives up his body as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River in the evening. Nor is the offering for one day only, but for measureless millions of kalpas. Yet the blessings and virtue derived when a person merely hears the Såtra and believes it with no reservations surpass those of the person who gives up bodies as many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River each morning, noon, and evening for measureless millions of kalpas.With no reservations means that the listener has no certainty but believes wholeheartedly.

Those who study the dharmas of the Small Vehicle are attached to a view of self, which is a kind of greed. They are attached to a view of others, which is a kind of hostility. They are attached to a view of living beings and a life, which is a kind of stupid-ity. Such people cannot hear, receive or recite the contents of the Vajra Såtra. Because they are only fond of Small Vehicle dharmas, they are unable to receive the wonderful principles of the Great Vehicle, the Dharma of real mark which has no marks.

Incense. The finest, most expensive incense should be offered to the Buddha.

The Brahman woman in the Earth Store Bodhisattva Såtra sold her house and sacrificed her wealth in order to make a great offering to Enlightenment Flower Samàdhi Self-Existent King Tathàgata.

If you don’t believe that, just consider how a police dog is able to trace a human scent at a distance of three to five miles. However if you make offerings of incense to the Buddha with the hope of gaining a fragrant body, then you have missed the point. You should not seek for it. When your merit and virtue are sufficient your body will quite naturally be fragrant. The gods, for example, have fragrant bodies because they made offerings of incense to the Buddha in former lives.

Perhaps he had slandered others or always caused them trouble. As a result of such deeds he basically should fall into the three evil paths of the hells, hungry ghosts, and animals. But since he has received the subtle, wonderful, profound real mark Great Vehicle Buddhadharma, the retribution for his former grave offenses is lessened. The retribution takes the form of having people ridicule him when he recites the Såtras. Thus he has heavy offenses, but a light retribution.So when you recite såtras, if people ridicule you and call you superstitious, such ridicule contributes to the develop-ment of your virtuous conduct. Why do people disparage you like that? Why do they ridicule you, look down on you, and call you stupid? By regarding you in that way, they enable your offenses from former lives to disappear.

So when the Buddha rescues living beings, it is really the living beings who rescue themselves.

The thought drove him insane, and he ran around madly looking for his head. Actually his head was not lost. He himself had jumped to that conclusion.

The Vajra Såtra says, “...this Dharma is level and equal without high or low, there-fore it is called Anuttarasaüyaksaübodhi.Ÿ That is the equalit y of all dharmas. “The Tathàgata neither comes nor goes.Ÿ That is the equality of all dharmas.[[ 4. The equality of one and many is missing from this book — don’t know why — no explanation is given in the book. “PDFmaker’s comment.Ÿ]5. The equality of all views. What is the view of self, the view of others, the view of living beings, and the view of a life? There is none. That is the equality of all views. Medicine is prescribed according to the sickness, but once cured, you no longer take the medicine. If you remain on medication after the illness has been cured, further illness will result. That is the equality of all views.Those five aspects express the essence of the entire Vajra Såtra, but to understand praj¤à, the principle of empti-ness, one further thing is needed: faith. If you do not believe the principle of emptiness then no matter how often it is ex-plained, it will do you no good. The Buddhadharma is like a great sea. Only by faith can one enter."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252Chapter 32The Response & Transformation Bodies are Unreal“Subhåti, someone might fill measureless asaükhyeyas of world systems with the seven precious gems and give them as a gift. But if a good man or good woman who has resolved his heart on Bodhi were to take from this Såtra even as few as four lines of verse and receive, hold, read, recite, and extensively explain them for others, his blessings would surpass the other’s.ŸRealizing that some people are willing to give as a gift as many of the seven precious gems as would fill measureless asaükhyeyas of worlds, you should ask your self, “Can I give away all my wealth?Ÿ If you cannot, your merit and virtue are not as great as that of the person mentioned here. However if you cannot give up your wealth, it does not matter. Keep it and come to study the Buddhadharma. Then you can give away dharma.Perhaps in studying the Buddhadharma one learns to recite the Vajra Såtra; or as little as a four-line gàthà from it. One accepts it with one’s heart, maintains it with one’s body, reads it from a book, recites it from memory, and extensively explains it to others. If you can do that, your blessings and virtues are greater than those of someone who gives away gems which would fill limitless, numberless worlds. Isn’t that easy? That is why I say you can obtain great merit and virtue without necessarily giving up your wealth."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"253How should it be explained to others?

With no grasping at marks refers to contemplative praj¤à. Thus, thus, unmoving refers to real mark praj¤ à. Praj¤ à was discussed at the beginning of the Såtra, and at the end the text again makes reference to praj¤à.When you explain a såtra for others, you should not become at t ached to marks. You should not think, “I am gaining a lot of merit and virtue by explaining this four-line gàthà for them.Ÿ Although you are correct that your merit and virtue are great, you should not harbor a mark of their size. If you do, you grasp at marks and become attached to them. If you are able to refrain from grasping at marks, then the existent is as if non-existent, and the actual is as if empty. Basically someone with Way virtue is as if devoid of Way virtue. A man who is truly educated is as if devoid of education. That means that at all times in all places you should be free of the mark of a self.Thus, thus, unmoving is real mark praj¤à. It is true, actual wisdom.

There is no dharma which is not thus: that is real mark praj¤à.And why? Why does one need literary, contemplative, and real mark praj¤à? øàkyamuni Buddha spoke four lines of verse which those who study the Vajra Såtra should regularly recite:All conditioned dharmasAre like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows,Like dew drops and a lightning flash:Contemplate them thus.Everything is a conditioned dharma. Eating, wearing clothes, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, running a business — all activities are conditioned dharmas. Those are examples of external conditioned dharmas. There are also the Five Skandhas, form, feeling, thought, activities, and conscious-ness, which are conditioned dharmas. The four principal ele-ments, earth, water, fire, and wind, are conditioned dharmas. The six roots, the six dusts, the twelve places, and the eight-een realms are all conditioned dharmas. All those dharmas, whether external or internal, are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows.What is a dream? No one knows. If we knew then we would not dream. People are in a perpetual dream.

In the same way, we are unable to remember the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"255events of our former lives, because they have disappeared in this present life’s dream.Someone may have a dream in which he becomes wealthy, is appointed an official, and is on the verge of be-coming president, when suddenly someone else says to him, “Sir, you are actually having a dream.Ÿ But in the midst of his dream of riches and position, the person cannot believe what he is told.“Everything that is happening to me is real,Ÿ he says, “I’m wealthy, I’m an official, I’m a candidate for president. How can you say that I am dreaming?Ÿ However, when he awakens from his dream, he will know without being told that all those events happened in a dream.So too we people are as if in a dream. Now I will tell you: this is a dream. Although I’ve told you, surely you will reply, “What do you mean, a dream? This is all real. These things are actually happening. How can you say it is a dream? You cheat people.ŸWhen your cultivation is accomplished, you will awaken from this dream and know without being told that everything you did in the past was a dream. The reason you do not believe me when I tell you that you are dreaming is that you still have not awakened from your dream. When you awaken you will agree, “Yes, it was all a dream.ŸIllusions are unreal, like a magician’s tricks.

A magician appears to have spiritual penetrations and wonderful functioning, but what he does is unreal. Although it seems real, if you inves-tigate, it is seen to be illusory, non-existent. Such acts as the lotus in the fire can fool children or fools into believing the lotus is real; but an adult can take one look and know that it is a trick.When you understand the Buddhadharma you know that everything is empty and illusory. The world is empty and illusory, realized from a conflux of conditions which only seem to be real. When you do not understand the Buddhadharma, you are like the child or the fool who considers everything to be real. This is not to belittle people, it is a simple fact. People who do not understand the Buddhadharma think that being wealthy is real and think that official positions actually exist. In actuality, everything is one. A person is the same whether he is rich or impoverished. If you understand that everything is empty and illusory, then you cannot be confused by anything. You will not become attached to unreal states.Bubbles are also basically unreal, and quickly disappear to show their emptiness.Shadows follow people around. When there is form, then there is a shadow. The form is an actual substance, the shadow is empty. If explained in more depth, even form itself is empty and totally unreal. If you do not believe that, then just continue to be attached to your body, protect and maintain it, and see whether or not it dies."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"257Like dew drops and a lightning flash. If you look outside early in the morning you will find dew, but after sunrise the dew will have disappeared. A lightning flash is also impermanent.Contemplate them thus. You should look upon all condi-tioned things in this way. If you do, then heaven will be empty and the earth will be void. The measure of your heart will be as vast as the heavens and as broad as empty space, free of impediments. Without impediments there is no fear.I have no fear. I have never been afraid of anything from the moment I was born. Dead men, living men, strange essences or weird creatures, tigers, lions — I fear none of them. Bring me a tiger and I’ll turn it into a kitten. Try it out. I can be this way because I have no obstructions. With me, everything is OK. If everything is like dew drops and a light-ning flash, like dreams, illusions, bubbles, or shadows, then what can obstruct? There are no obstructions, and so there is no fear. The Heart Såtra says, “When there are no impedi-ments there is no fear.Ÿ With no fear, “Upside-down dream-like thoughts are left far behind.Ÿ Therefore I say, “I do not fear tigers.Ÿ If you do not believe me, bring in a tiger and I’ll sit in meditation beside it.After the Buddha spoke this Såtra the elder Subhåti, all the bhikùus, bhikùuõãs, upàsakas, upàsikàs, and the world with its gods, men, and asuras, heard what the Buddha had said, rejoiced, believed, received, revered, and practiced."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"258After the Buddha had finished speaking the praj¤à of true emptiness, the Vajra Såtra, the Elder Subhåti, who had ten kinds of virtuous conduct; the bhikùus; bhikùuõãs; the laymen; laywomen; the gods; people; as well as the asuras, who had the blessings of the heavens but not the status; upon hearing the praj¤à of wonderful existence and true emptiness, gave rise to great joy, believed, accepted, and respectfully practiced the Såtra. All were as happy as if they had obtained a precious gem, and they had: the jewel of wisdom, the Dharma jewel of praj¤à. They believed. They lost all their desires, casting them aside. I hope that when we finish studying the Vajra Såtra you can cast all your upside-down thoughts far away. Rid yourself of enjoyment of food. Rid yourself of desire for sleep. Banish your striving for fame. Abolish your urge to become rich. Cast all the aspects of your heart’s desires to some far-away place. If you can rid yourself of the desires for wealth, sex, fame, food, and sleep, you can cut off the roots of the hells, and advance to the fruit position of Buddhahood — the Eternally Bright Pure Land.This is the end of the Vajra Såtra. Everyone who studies this Såtra should transform his body so that it becomes as durable as vajra. He should make his vows, his determination, and his faith as sharp as vajra. And he should make his wisdom as bright as vajra. He should completely accept the wonderful principle of praj¤à, and personally practice it in order for there to he praj¤à pàramità, arrival at the other shore.Those who practice will not fall behind.
