It marks a significant stage in the growing importance of Avalokiteśvara within Indian Buddhism in the early centuries of the first millennium. In a series of narratives within narratives, the sūtra describes Ava-lokiteśvara’s activities in various realms and the realms contained within the pores of his skin. It culminates in a description of the extreme rarity of his mantra, which, on the Buddha’s instructions, Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin obtains from someone in Vārāṇasī who has broken his monastic vows. This sūtra provided a basis and source of quotations for the teachings and practices of the eleventh-century Maṇi Kabum, which itself served as a foundation for the rich tradition of Tibetan Ava-lokiteśvara practice.

The sūtra is thus of particular importance, as this mantra now holds a central role in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, especially throughout the lay popula-tion. This sūtra also records Avalokiteśvara’s transformation into the principal figure of the Buddhist pantheon, greater than all other buddhas, let alone bodhisattvas. In this sūtra, Avalokiteśvara is a resident of Sukhavātī and acts as a messenger and gift bearer for Amitābha, even though he is also described as superior to all buddhas and therefore paradoxically has both a subservient and dominant status. The Sūtra in India and its translations The Kāraṇḍavyūha probably dates to around the fifth century CE. In terms of where it was composed, the text indicates familiarity with the cesspits of Vārāṇasī, and as-sumes the reader’s knowledge of Candradvīpa, the southern part of Bengal where the Ganges Delta is situated. In the Tibetan version, the merchants who wish to sail to Laṅka ask whether the winds are blowing toward the land of the Greeks. This ap-pears to locate their port of departure on the northwest coast of India. In terms of time, the text is located within a culture where the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas had a dominant place in Indian culture, particularly the Skandha Pūraṇa, probably during the Gupta period of the third to fifth century. The earliest surviving manuscript is comprised of fragmentary pages from two manuscripts discovered within a Gilgit stūpa in the 1940s. It was written in a hybrid of Middle Indic and Sanskrit, now called Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, which was fre-quently used in sūtras. Adhelheid Mette, who has published these fragments, sug-gests that it was composed in the fourth or fifth century;1 the script in which it is written had fallen out of use by the early seventh century, and the fragments show variations between the two manuscripts that are the result of the texts having gone through generations of copying. Other existing Sanskrit manuscripts (see below) date from a century or more later than the ninth century Tibetan translation. According to Lokesh Chandra,2 in 270 CE Dharmarakṣa of Dunhuang translated the Kāraṇḍavyūha into Chinese. Then, between 435 and 443 CE, Gunabhadra trans-lated it into Chinese again. However, this is a case of misidentification. The sūtra they translated was the Ratnakaraṇḍavyūha. The Kāraṇḍavyūha itself was not trans-lated into Chinese until 983 CE, considerably later than the Tibetan translation; the translator was T’ien Hsi-tsai. The sūtra also exists in a later, longer and more polished form, entirely in verse"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"viii THE BASKET’S DISPLAY and incorporating passages from such texts as Śantideva’s Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra, which has great importance within Nepalese Buddhism. Dating to the fifteenth centu-ry, it is one of the last Sanskrit Buddhist sūtras. It has not been translated into Tibet-an. Avalokiteśvara Avalokiteśvara is noticeable by his absence in early sūtras where Mañjuśrī figures prominently. In the Sukhāvatīvyūha or The Display of the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī, which describes the realm of Amitāyus, the buddha who later became known by the name Amitābha, Avalokiteśvara has yet to appear. He makes his first prominent ap-pearance in the longer Sukhāvatīvyūha in which he stands beside Amitāyus as one of his two principal bodhisattva attendants. The other bodhisattva was Mahāsthāmaprāpta, and in a number of subsequent sūtras they are included as a pair in the introductory description of the assembly of those who are listening to the teaching. In one of the Kāraṇḍavyūha’s internal contradictions, both Mahāsthāmaprāpta and Avalokiteśvara are listed as being in the audience awaiting Avalokiteśvara’s appearance. Each bodhisattva later had a chapter dedicated to him in the White Lotus Sūtra, but while Avalokiteśvara reached preeminence over all buddhas in the Kāraṇḍavyūha, Mahāsthāmaprāpta declined in importance. In the Tibetan tradition, even in the Su-khāvatīvyūha, he has become conflated with Vajrapāṇi. At the time of the composi-tion of the Kāraṇḍavyūha, Vajrapāṇi, who in earlier Buddhism was a powerful yakṣa, appears as one of the gathered bodhisattvas, which is indicative of sūtras that contain mantras. However, this is a recent development, as one of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities given in the sūtra is that he terrifies Vajrapāṇi! Vajrapāṇi would soon join Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara to form the principal trinity of bodhisattvas in the early tantra tradition. The Kāraṇḍavyūha does not mention Avalokiteśvara’s abode in this world on the Potalaka Mountain, which was a later feature that first appeared in South Indian Buddhism. The origin of the popular four-armed version of Avalokiteśvara appears within the sūtra as the goddess who is the embodiment of the six-syllable mantra, referred to throughout as a vidyā (which is a feminine noun) or often as the queen of mahāvidyās. Many forms of Avalokiteśvara appeared in India, such as the thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara included in fasting practice, and in the eleventh century there appeared the higher tantra form named Jinasāgara, a red, four-armed Avalokiteśvara in union with a consort. This practice was introduced into Tibet in the beginning of the twelfth century. Eventually Avalokiteśvara practices spread throughout the Buddhist world. There are still ancient Avalokiteśvara statues even in Śrī Laṅka, though the figure is identi-fied as Śiva in Tamil areas and as Maitreya in Buddhist temples. Avalokiteśvara was prominent in China for centuries before the Kāraṇḍavyūha was translated into Chi-nese. In particular Avalokiteśvara became a dominant figure in Chinese Buddhism as Kuan Yin (or Guanyin in Pinyin), transforming into a female bodhisattva, a process described by Chün-Fang Yü in Kuan-yin: The Chinese Transformation of Ava-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY ix lokiteśvara, as the result of focusing on his incarnation as the Princess Miao-chan.3 The Kāraṇḍavyūha in Tibetan Buddhism The Pillar Testament (Tib. bka’ chems ka khol ma) from the eleventh or twelfth cen-tury states that the Kāraṇḍavyūha was one of the texts that descended from the sky in a casket onto the palace roof of the fifth-century ruler of the Yarlung Valley, Lhatho-thori Nyentsen (Tib. lha tho tho ri gnyan btsan), and that during the reign of his de-scendant Songtsen Gampo (Tib. srong btsan sgam po), who became the king of most of the Tibetan plateau and introduced Buddhism to Tibet, it was translated by Thönmi Sambhota, the inventor of the Tibetan alphabet.4 In the thirteenth century Nelpa Paṇḍita, rejecting this legend, stated that the casket was brought by a paṇḍita on his way to China.5 However, he only records the maṇi mantra as being within the casket, which happens to be called a za ma tog or “a solid and precious casket” (rin-chen za ma tog) and not a reed basket. Nevertheless, this is probably why this sūtra became associated with the legend. The earliest and only translation of the sūtra appears to be the one presently in the canon. All of the versions of the Kangyur except one have a colophon ascribing the translation of the Kāraṇḍavyūha to Yeshé Dé and the Indian paṇḍitas Dānaśīla and Jinamitra, who collaborated with each other on the majority of their translations. The Narthang Kangyur (Tib. snar thang bka’ ’gyur) is alone in attributing the translation to Śākyaprabha and Ratnarakṣita. Nanam Yeshé Dé (Tib. sna nam ye shes sde) was a Tibetan who became the prin-cipal translator in the translation program set up under the royal auspices of King Trisong Detsen (Tib. khri srong lde btsan) (r. 742–798 CE). The translation work took place in a building dedicated to the translation program. It was situated within the circular compound of Samye (Tib. bsam yas) Monastery. Yeshé Dé’s name is in the colophon of no less than 347 texts in the Kangyur and Tengyur, three of which are his own original works in Tibetan. Jinamitra was invited to Tibet during the reign of Trisong Detsen, and 234 texts name him as Yeshé Dé’s co-translator. Dānaśīla, also known as Mālava, was invited to Tibet from Kashmir during the reign of Ral-pachen (Tib. ral pa can) (r. 815–838 CE) and was involved with the translation of around 165 texts. He was also the author of seven texts, five of which he helped translate. He was still active in Tibet during the reign of King Langdarma (Tib. glang dar ma) (r. 838–841 CE). Jinamitra and Dānaśīla were also two of the four or five Indian paṇḍitas who played principal roles in the completion of the Mahāvyuttpati, the Sanskrit-Tibetan concordance that was intended to regulate the translation of Sanskrit texts into Tibet-an. Work on this dictionary began during the reigns of Trisong Detsen and Senaleg (sad na legs) (r. 800–815 CE), but it was completed in the reign of Ralpachen (ral pa can). The catalog for the Tangtong Denkar Palace (pho brang thang stong ldan dkar) collection, which was compiled in 824 CE, lists the Kāraṇḍavyūha. There is at least one instance in the Kāraṇḍavyūha where the translation does not accord with the Mahāvyuttpati. In describing the twenty peaks of the mountain that is the belief in the existence of an individual self in relation to the skandhas (“aggre-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x THE BASKET’S DISPLAY gates”), the peaks are described as samudgata, which the Mahāvyuttpati translates as “high” (Tib. mtho ba). In the Kāraṇḍavyūha, however, it is translated as “arisen” (Tib. byung ba). Unless the translators changed their minds, this would appear to identify the translation as having taken place before the Mahāvyuttpati was complet-ed. Therefore we can say that the translation was certainly made during the decade between 815 and 824 CE, and presumably in the earlier part of that decade, around 820 CE or earlier. Neither Yeshé Dé nor Jinamitra are specified to have lived beyond the end of Ralpachen’s reign in 824 CE. Yeshé Dé’s remains are said to be interred within a stūpa on Hepori Hill next to Samye Monastery, where he worked on so many translations. A later translation or revision of the Tibetan version was never made. However, the Kāraṇḍavyūha served as the basis for the eleventh-century Maṇi Kabum (A Hun-dred Thousand Teachings on the Maṇi Mantra; Tib. ma Ni bka’ ’bum), which was attributed to Songtsen Gampo, although the extracts from the sūtra that it includes are clearly derived from the early ninth-century translation. The Maṇi Kabum was a highly influential work in propagating the practice of Avalokiteśvara, known in Ti-betan as Chenrezi (spyan ras gzigs), the repetition of the maṇi mantra, and the identi-fication of Songtsen Gampo as an emanation of Avalokiteśvara, and has had a much greater impact on Tibetan culture that the sūtra upon which it is based. Translation of the Title The title of the sūtra is somewhat ambiguous. A karaṇḍa is usually a basket made of reeds. The karaṇḍa is frequently portrayed in the background of portraits of Indian siddhas as a large pot-bellied basket with a lid, containing collections of scriptures. These siddhas are also portrayed making the hand gesture representing the basket, the karaṇḍamudrā (“basket gesture”). There is even a layperson’s hairstyle named karaṇḍamakuṭa (“basket crest”), where the hair is arranged on top of the head in the shape of a tall, rounded basket with a lid. Another word for basket is piṭaka, which forms the basis of the most common metaphor for the Buddha’s teachings, “the three baskets” or tripiṭaka, which contain the Vinaya, Sūtra, and the Abhidharma or its predecessor the Mātṛkā. However, there are many instances in Tibetan literature where za ma tog, the translation of karaṇḍa, means something more solid and smaller than a pot-bellied reed basket, as in the pre-cious casket (Tib. rin chen za ma tog) in the legend of the Kāraṇḍavyūha’s appear-ance to King Lhathothori. The name of the earlier Ratnakaraṇḍasūtra could at first seem to mean “precious casket,” but the contents of the sūtra validate the Tibetan translation as The Basket of the [Three] Jewels (dkon mchog gi za ma tog).6 There are also instances in the Sanskrit where the word karaṇḍa is apparently used for something more solid than a reed basket. There is a dhāraṇī in the tantra section of the Kangyur that has in its title the phrase dhātukaraṇḍa (Tib. ring bsrel gyi za ma tog), which means “the casket of relics,” or “reliquary.”7 The Kāraṇḍavyūha is spelled with a long initial a in all existing Sanskrit manu-scripts, while every Tibetan edition has a short initial vowel. The long vowel is more likely to be lost than added, as errors generally replace the uncommon with the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xi common. The enhanced vowel is used in Sanskrit to denote affiliation, origin, and ancestry. In the case of kāraṇḍa, the word usually means “ducks”; they live among the river reeds that are used to make baskets. Here kāraṇḍa may be signifying that this sūtra has its origin in the basket that contains the description of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities. A basket or casket is normally spelled without the long vowel: karaṇḍa. There are also titles in the Tengyur that contain the word ratnakaraṇḍa (without the long vowel) where it means “a casket that is made of a precious material,” even though that meaning is not necessarily evident in Tibetan because of the syntax of the titles in question.8 Therefore, after hesitating between “basket” and “casket” and wishing there was one word for both (or at least a word for a lidded, pot-bellied reed basket), we chose “basket” as the better translation, primarily because of the way karaṇḍa is used in the sūtra itself. This term occurs only within the description of the Avīci hell. The Vaidya edition has visphurad ratnakaraṇḍavat, which means “raging [flame] like a precious casket,” but this appears to be a corruption, with the Cambridge manuscript having visphurantaṃ karaṇḍavat, and the Tibetan not having the equivalent of ratna (“precious”). If karaṇḍa is being used here to describe the shape of the flame, then it is referring to the distinctive shape of the reed basket, wider at its middle. This shape is still associated with za ma tog in contemporary Tibetan, and it is also compared with the shape of an egg. Vyūha has a wide range of meanings, but is based on the idea of things being set out or displayed, and was therefore translated into Tibetan as bkod pa. The word can also mean “description” or “explanation” and even “chapter.” The sūtra is therefore a display from a basket, or the presentation of its contents. The later Nepalese version of the sūtra has a longer title, Guṇakāraṇḍavyūha, which could be translated as A Display from the Basket of Qualities, the “qualities” being those of Avalokiteśvara. Both versions of the sūtra are dedicated primarily to a description of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities, which are stated to be greater than that of any buddha. The use of vyūha in the title is also evocative of the earlier Gaṇḍavyūha, which forms the last chapter of the Avataṃsaka, where gaṇḍa means “supreme” or “best.” The influence of the contents of that chapter is also discernable in this sūtra. Oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ The Kāraṇḍavyūha’s principal content is the introduction of the oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ mantra and the descriptions of its inconceivable benefits. These are also the most quoted sections of the sūtra. However, it contains no instructions on the qualities and benefits of each syllable, of the kind that subsequently became widespread in Tibetan Buddhism. It also gives no explanation of the meaning of the mantra as a whole, a meaning that has been understood in various ways. Donald Lopez has given an ac-count of various interpretations of the mantra in the West in his Prisoners of Shan-gri-la.9 Alexander Studholme, in his The Origins of Oṃ Maṇipadme Hūṃ, describes how the sūtra was composed within the context of familiarity with, and under the influ-ence of, Purāṇic literature, in particular the Skandapurāṇa. In this sūtra, Ava-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii THE BASKET’S DISPLAY lokiteśvara has taken on various attributes and characteristics of Śiva, to the extent that one passage could be misread as describing Avalokiteśvara to be the creator of the universe. Even so, he is still being described as the creator of its deities, including Śiva and Viṣṇu. In particular, Avalokiteśvara’s mantra is evidence of the influence of Śiva’s five-syllable mantra, oṃ namaḥ śivāya (“Oṃ—Homage to Śiva!”), which is found in the Skandapurāṇa together with a description of the benefits of its recita-tion. In classical Sanskrit grammar, padme would be the locative case, which has led to the interpretation of oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ as “jewel in the lotus.” However, mantras are typically given in the vocative or dative case, usually with the name of a deity being invoked. Padme is in fact the vocative for padma, this being Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. In classical Sanskrit, the e-ending vocative form is only used for feminine nouns.10 P.C. Verhagen has translated one of the few native Tibetan texts to be found in the Tengyur, a grammar text that uses this very mantra to explain the e-ending vocative form for masculine nouns.11 This vocative form of masculine nouns is a characteristic of the Magadhi, or northeastern Middle Indic, dialect. However, this form appears to have been much more widespread, extending as far as Sanskrit loan words in the Tocharian language of Central Asia.12 Maṇipadma is therefore a com-pound and is a name for Avalokiteśvara meaning “Jewel Lotus.” Difficulties Inherent in the Sūtra The sūtra itself is rarely read in Tibet, other than in the annual ritual chanting of the Kangyur, and as mentioned above it has been eclipsed by the eleventh-century Maṇi Kabum. There is no evidence of it having had any significant impact on religious life in Tibet in the preceding centuries. In spite of the eventual importance of the oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ mantra, the sūtra is still primarily known only through select quota-tions. One reason for this is that very little of the teaching and meditation practice of the Maṇi Kabum is to be found in the sūtra. Another reason is the difficulty involved in reading the sūtra due to its structure of narratives within narratives. After a buddha is initially introduced, he is subsequently only referred to as “Bhagavat,” and it is easy for readers to lose track of which level of the narrative they are reading. Although the speakers’ names were not repeated in the original, we have added them in here for clarity. We have not marked these inser-tions with square brackets, again for the sake of readability. Another problem with the sūtra is that although it is a compilation of narratives, the sūtra does not always use its source material in a skillful manner. The Sanskrit original itself does not compare well with the clarity and style of writing found in other sūtras. There are abrupt transitions, inconsistency in the use of pronouns, and the contents of one part of the narrative appear to be in contradiction with those of another. For example, the Buddha tells the tale of the merchants being rescued from the land of the rākṣasīs in the first person, but there are sporadic lapses into what must have been the original third person of the narrative. The asura king Bali’s ac-count of his downfall likewise transitions from a first- to a third-person account. In common with many other Mahāyāna sūtras but perhaps more frequently than most of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xiii them, the Kāraṇḍavyūha refers to itself within its own narrative as a sūtra that is be-ing taught, requested, or longed for, but appears to describe itself as being comprised of verses, almost as if the Kāraṇḍavyūha is a different sūtra that is simply being re-ferred to in this sūtra. The sūtra assumes that the reader is familiar with the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa, the two great epics of Indian literature, and the story of Viṣṇu’s avatar as a dwarf deceiving Bali, the lord of the asuras. Tibetan readers, however, would be unfamiliar with personages referred to in passing in the text, such as Śukra, who is both the deity of the planet Venus and counselor for the king of the asuras. Viṣṇu is usually referred to as Nārāyaṇa in the sūtra, but in the passage where he rescues the Pāṇḍavas and other kṣatriyas of Mahābhārata fame, he is referred to as Daśarathapu-tra (“son of Daśaratha”), which is actually the name of Rāma, another of Viṣṇu’s av-atars. This may be because the story of the dwarf avatar also appears in the Rāmāyaṇa when it is told to Rāma, that is, Daśarathaputra. The sūtra also includes a variation of a well-known jātaka tale in which the Bud-dha as a horse saves merchants from the island of the rākṣasīs,13 which has been re-told with variations many times in Buddhist literature. Here it is retold with Avalokiteśvara as the horse and the Buddha as the head merchant who is being res-cued. However, this too implies an unexplained internal contradiction; the sūtra had earlier narrated how Avalokiteśvara, in the form of a handsome man, had converted all the rākṣasīs from their cannibalistic ways to become devotees of Buddhism. Problems Arising from the Tibetan Translation The Tibetan translation occasionally transliterates the Sanskrit rather than attempting to find a Tibetan equivalent, particularly when it comes to fauna and flora—even the Sanskrit word for wolf is simply transliterated as tarakṣa. There are also instances of obscure translations of words that do not agree with the Mahāvyuttpati. In some passages, we relied more on the Sanskrit than we had originally anticipat-ed because there is evidence that the manuscript from which the Tibetan translation was made had suffered from scribal corruption, as revealed by the surviving Sanskrit and confirmed by the English translation of the Chinese. For example, when describ-ing the maṇḍala as adṛṣṭa (“not seen”), this was corrupted to aṣṭa (“eight”); a moun-tain made of padmarāga (“ruby”) was corrupted to padmarakta, which was translated as “red lotuses” (pad ma dmar po); and in the middle of Buddha’s describ-ing Avalokiteśvara’s qualities, ayaṃ (“this”) was corrupted to ahaṃ (“me”) so that the Buddha seems to be describing himself. There are also omissions of sentences in the Tibetan (whether as the result of omission in the original Sanskrit manuscript or later copies of the Tibetan) that affect the narrative or meaning. The omissions are particularly evident when there are lists of qualities or meditations that are more easily left out in the process of copying manuscripts. On the other hand, there are also instances of members of lists that are preserved in the Tibetan but omitted in the available Sanskrit texts. The most egregious flaw in both the Tibetan and Chinese translations, and one which has already attracted scholarly attention, occurred on rendering the obscure"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv THE BASKET’S DISPLAY term ratikara, which literally means “that which creates joy,” and is also the name of one of the apsaras that are in the audience for this sūtra. The later Nepalese version used instead dvīpa, the common word for lamp, but both the Chinese and Tibetan translators, even with the assistance of Sanskrit scholars, were understandably stumped by this odd word, particularly as the ratikara laughs and speaks. Both Yeshé Dé and T’ien Hsi-tsai chose to make it refer to the rākṣasī wife speaking in her sleep, as she is the only other person in the room and is the merchant’s paramour. This en-tailed interpolating the word sleeping into the translation. However, the result makes little narrative sense, whereas the unlikely meaning of lamp does make narrative sense. The Translation into English Our aim was to make the most readable, accurate, and coherent version of the sūtra as it is preserved in the Tibetan translation. The Degé edition and the version in the critical edition of the Kangyur were therefore our principal sources. Sanskrit manuscripts do not necessarily reflect the original form of a text, even though they are in the original language, because they may have their own accretion of omissions and additions that have occurred in the centuries following the time a Tibetan or Chinese translation was made. There has not yet been a critical edition from all available Sanskrit manuscripts, but we consulted three Sanskrit editions, the most important being a palm-leaf manuscript from the Cambridge University Li-brary, which was written in the beginning of the second millennium before the de-velopment of the Devanāgarī script. It is notable for being closer to the Tibetan. Of easier access but less representative of the original text are the Sāmaśrami edition of 1872 and the 1962 Vaidya edition that is based closely on Sāmaśrami. The Sāmaśrami is available on the Online Sanskrit Texts Project of the Theosophical Network, and the Vaidya is openly available on the internet. To complete the transla-tion of some difficult passages, we also referred to the Gilgit manuscript fragments, though they were not readily accessible. Silfung Chen’s online English translation from the Chinese proved interesting in its correspondences with these editions. Nevertheless, as noted above, there were a number of points where we relied on the Sanskrit to fill in missing elements, words, members of a list, and sometimes whole sentences, although it is possible that some of the latter may have been later additions to improve the flow and clarity of the sūtra’s sometimes clumsy narrative. Where the Tibetan translation was modified in favor of the Sanskrit, annotations in-dicate that this is the case. An important objective was readability, so the syntax does not necessarily reflect that of the Tibetan or Sanskrit versions. For example, an active construction may be used instead of a passive construction found in the original. The inconsistencies of first and third person have been resolved, and, as noted above, names are repeated when otherwise the reader might lose track of who is speaking or to whom the text is referring. Hopefully this will make reading the sūtra in English far less challenging than attempting to do so in Tibetan or Sanskrit. Readers will find the variant readings in Tibetan and Sanskrit in the notes if they wish."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xv Summary of the Text Buddha Śākyamuni is at Jetavana Monastery with many disciples. Lights shine upon the monastery and miraculously transform it. The bodhisattva Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asks the Buddha where the lights came from. The Buddha ex-plains that they came from Avalokiteśvara, who had just visited the Avīci hell and the city of the pretas, and then describes those visits. Then Buddha Śākyamuni recounts being a merchant at the time of Buddha Vipaśyin and how he heard him describe how various deities, including Śiva and Viṣṇu, were created from Avalokiteśvara’s body. Buddha Śākyamuni then recounts being Bodhisattva Dānaśūra at the time of Bud-dha Śikhin and how light rays shone from Buddha Śikhin. In response to questioning by Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi, Śikhin says that the lights and other omens are a sign of the approach of Avalokiteśvara, who then arrives from Sukhāvatī with an offering of lotuses from Buddha Amitābha. After Avalokiteśvara’s departure, Śikhin describes to Ratnapāṇi how Ava-lokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit is inconceivable by using a series of analogies. Then he describes how Avalokiteśvara teaches this very sūtra to the asuras in the form of an asura. Buddha Śākyamuni then states that he was a rishi (ṛṣi) at the time of Buddha Viśvabhū. Before repeating what Viśvabhū taught, Śākyamuni relates how Ava-lokiteśvara taught upside-down beings in the realm of gold and four-legged beings in the land of silver. There then follows a long description of Avalokiteśvara’s visit to the asuras in the land of iron. Avalokiteśvara teaches the asuras the inconceivable merit that comes from making offerings to a buddha. Bali, the king of the asuras, tells Avalokiteśvara that he had in the past made an offering to the wrong recipient. He had imprisoned all the kṣatriyas, but Viṣṇu secretly freed them and came to him in the form of a dwarf asking for two steps of land. Bali offered him three, but Viṣṇu took on his divine form and covered the whole world in two steps. He then banished Bali to the underworld where he now dwells for having failed to fulfill his promise. Avalokiteśvara then describes to him the suffering in hells that awaits those who have not made offerings to the Buddha. Avalokiteśvara then radiates light rays to where Viśvabhū and his pupils are resid-ing in Jetavana Monastery. Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asks Viśvabhū where the lights came from. Viśvabhū states that the lights are a sign that Avalokiteśvara is coming. However, Avalokiteśvara first goes to a land of darkness to teach the yakṣas and rākṣasas about the merit that comes from this sūtra. Avalokiteśvara then goes to the Śuddhāvāsa realms, where in the form of a Brah-min he begs from a poor deva. The deva goes into his empty palace to give him whatever he has, but finds it full of jewels and food that he then offers to the Brah-min. Avalokiteśvara in the form of the Brahmin tells the deva that he is a bodhisattva from Jetavana Monastery.

Avalokiteśvara then goes to Magadhā, where starving beings have been eating each other for twenty years, and he causes a rain of food to fall. One of the people, a man who is hundreds of thousands of years old, realizes that only Avalokiteśvara could have caused this miracle, and tells the others of the benefits of making offer-ings to him. Avalokiteśvara then goes to Buddha Viśvabhū. Bodhisattva Gaganagañja meets him, Viśvabhū teaches the six perfections, and the audience disperses. This is the end of part one. Part two begins with Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asking for teachings from Buddha Śākyamuni, who lists the samādhis that Avalokiteśvara has. Then Buddha Śākyamuni recounts being a head merchant who became stranded on Siṃhala Island with other merchants. Each of them goes to live with a rākṣasī. One night, a talking lamp warns the head merchant that the women are all rākṣasīs. As proof, the lamp directs him to an iron fortress where other merchants are being kept prisoner and then eaten. Then the lamp tells him of Bālāha,14 a miraculous horse on which the merchants can escape. As they flee upon the horse, all the other merchants look back, fall off the horse, and are eaten by the rākṣasīs, while the head merchant reaches home safely. Buddha Śākyamuni states that Avalokiteśvara was the horse. Buddha Śākyamuni then begins a description of two pores on Avalokiteśvara’s body and their inhabitants. Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, to the Buddha’s approval, describes the benefits that come from this sūtra. Buddha Śākyamuni describes another pore and explains to Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin that the pores are immaterial and cannot be seen even by bud-dhas. Buddha Śākyamuni describes two more pores, saying that those who remember Ava-lokiteśvara’s name, meaning the six-syllable mahāvidyā, will be reborn in them, but that no one, not even the buddhas, know this mantra. After Buddha Śākyamuni describes more benefits that come from the mantra, Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin declares his intention to obtain it. Buddha Śākyamuni recounts his own fruitless search for it until, after meeting tril-lions of buddhas, he finally met Buddha Ratnottama who directed him to Buddha Padmottama. Padmottama describes the incalculable benefits that come from saying the mantra once and then describes his own long fruitless search for the mantra until he came to Buddha Amitābha, who instructed Avalokiteśvara to give the mantra to Padmottama. Avalokiteśvara does so through a maṇḍala made of precious stones and gives the instructions on how to make the maṇḍala."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xvii Buddha Śākyamuni follows this narrative with a description of how incalculable the benefits are from even one syllable of the mantra. He then tells Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin that he can only obtain it from an unnamed dharmabhāṇaka who has lost his monastic vows and lives in Vārāṇasī. Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin goes to him in a huge procession of people and offerings. The dharmabhāṇaka describes the benefits of the mantra and, at the urging of Ava-lokiteśvara, who appears in the sky, gives the mantra to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, who returns to Buddha Śākyamuni. Seventy million buddhas recite the mantra of the goddess known as both Cundi and Cundā. Buddha Śākyamuni then describes five more of Avalokiteśvara’s pores. Buddha Śākyamuni then describes the oceans that come from Avalokiteśvara’s big toe, and says there are no more pores but those ten. Then omens of Avalokiteśvara’s arrival appear. He leaves Sukhāvatī and comes to Buddha Śākyamuni and offers him lotuses from Buddha Amitābha. Buddha Śākyamuni then directs Maheśvara and Umādevī to receive the prophecies of their future buddhahood from Avalokiteśvara. Buddha Śākyamuni then gives a teaching on the incalculability of Avalokiteśva-ra’s merit and listing the samādhis he has. Then Buddha Śākyamuni recounts when he was with Buddha Krakucchanda and saw Samantabhadra and Avalokiteśvara both practicing various samādhis. Krakuc-chanda declares that not even the buddhas have Avalokiteśvara’s samādhis. Buddha Śākyamuni then describes the benefits that come from this sūtra, and Ava-lokiteśvara departs. Then Ānanda requests teachings on monastic conduct. Buddha Śākyamuni prophe-sizes how there will be monks who do not maintain their conduct in the future and who should be expelled. He describes the tortures in hell and other rebirths that await laypeople who misuse the property of the Saṅgha. Ānanda departs and the sūtra concludes. Outline of the Sūtra This outline is intended as a guide to the complicated narrative levels of the sūtra. I. Sūtra narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni is in the Jetavana Monastery when lights appear, trans-forming the monastery’s appearance. Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin questions Bud-dha Śākyamuni about this, and the Buddha states that the cause of the lights is Avalokiteśvara visiting Avīci hell and then the city of the pretas. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Avalokiteśvara appears in Avīci hell and liberates beings. As a result, Yama’s creatures go to Yama and describe Avalokiteśvara’s arrival. Yama goes to Avalokiteśvara and praises him. II. Sūtra narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni responds to a question from Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin about whether Avalokiteśvara has left hell. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Avalokiteśvara leaves the hells, visits the city of the pre-tas, and liberates them from their suffering. This very sūtra sounds in their realm."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xviii THE BASKET’S DISPLAY III. Sūtra narrative -Buddha Śākyamuni says that he remembers being a merchant listening to Buddha Vipaśyin.15 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Buddha Vipaśyin describes the activities of Ava-lokiteśvara in the past. A. Buddha Vipaśyin’s narrative: Avalokiteśvara emanates such deities as Maheśvara (Śi-va), and Avalokiteśvara gives a prophecy to Śiva about the future rise of Shaivism, and how this will not bring liberation. IV. Sūtra narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni tells Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin about his memories of being a bodhisattva named Dānaśūra when Buddha Śikhin taught about Avalokiteśvara. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Lights radiate from Buddha Śikhin, prompting Bodhi-sattva Ratnapāṇi to question Buddha Śikhin. Signs appear as omens of the coming of Avalokiteśvara from Sukhāvatī. Avalokiteśvara arrives and tells Buddha Śikhin he has been liberating hell beings and pretas, and then Avalokiteśvara departs. In response to a question from bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi, Buddha Śikhin describes Avalokiteśvara’s quali-ties. A. Buddha Śikhin’s narrative: Buddha Śikhin gives analogies for the inconceivability of Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit. He describes his various manifestations as a guide for beings and his visit to the asuras where he teaches them the benefit of this very sūtra (even though the sūtra is itself the description of these events). V. Sūtra narrative: The story of Buddha Śikhin teaching Ratnapāṇi ends abruptly. Buddha Śākyamuni then describes his memory of being a rishi with Buddha Viśvabhū when he taught on Avalokiteśvara. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Buddha Viśvabhū begins a description of what Ava-lokiteśvara has been doing. A. Buddha Viśvabhū’s narrative: There is a brief description of how Avalokiteśvara vis-its adhomukha (“head-down”) beings in the realm of gold and four-legged beings in the realm of silver. There then follows a lengthy episode in the land of iron where he meets Bali, the king of asuras, who tells him how he came to be in the underworld. i. Bali’s narrative -Bali explains how he imprisoned many kṣatriyas, including the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas of Mahābhārata fame, and how Nārāyaṇa rescued them. Then he describes how he followed the tradition of a king making a vast offering from his wealth and granting the requests of anyone who came. Viṣṇu comes as a Brahmin dwarf requesting the amount of land that he can cover in two footsteps. Bali offers him three footsteps’ worth. Viṣṇu takes on a gigantic form, encompasses the world in two steps, and then banishes the asuras to the underworld. B. Buddha Viśvabhū’s narrative: Avalokiteśvara teaches Bali and the asuras, primarily describing the tortures by Yama’s guardians in hell. Then he takes his leave, saying he has to go to Jetavana Monastery. (Although this is the time of Viśvabhū, not Śākya-muni, here Viśvabhū’s own reported narrative transforms with no clear dividing line into Śākyamuni’s narrative about Viśvabhū.) 2. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Avalokiteśvara radiates light rays to Viśvabhū in Jeta-vana Monastery. The appearance of the light rays prompts the bodhisattva Gaganagañja to ask Viśvabhū a question as to their source. A. Buddha Viśvabhū’s narrative resumed: Avalokiteśvara leaves the realm of the asuras. (Although he had previously said Avalokiteśvara was leaving for Jetavana, Viśvabhū now says that he is going to Tamondhakāra, a realm of darkness inhabited by yakṣas and rākṣasas, where he teaches them analogies concerning the merit of knowing this very sūtra.) Avalokiteśvara leaves that realm for the Śuddhāvāsa realms, where he appears in the form of a Brahmin who begs from an impoverished deity. The poor deity goes into his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xix empty palace to look for something to give the Brahmin and discovers his pots mi-raculously filled with jewels. Avalokiteśvara then goes to the island of Siṃhala, which is inhabited by rākṣasīs, where he appears as a handsome man. They all become his wives, follow the Dharma, and attain liberation. Avalokiteśvara goes to Vārāṇasī, where he takes on the form of a bee and flies over a huge cesspool in the city. His buzzing is actually the sound of the Namo buddhāya prayer, and it liberates all the insects living in the cesspool. Avalokiteśvara then goes to Magadhā, where people in the wilderness are eating each other for lack of food. He causes a miraculous rain of food and drink to fall. An old man among them describes the source of this miracle. i. Old man’s narrative: The old man gives a description of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities. 3. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: (Here Viśvabhū’s own narrative transforms, with no clear dividing line, into Śākyamuni’s narrative about Viśvabhū.) Avalokiteśvara goes in-to the sky and thinks that it has been a long time since he has been to see Buddha Viśvabhū, so he decides to go to Jetavana. Avalokiteśvara arrives in Jetavana to see Buddha Viśvabhū. There is a brief mention of Viśvabhū teaching the six perfections and then everyone leaves, concluding part one of the sūtra. VI. Sūtra narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni responds to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin’s request for teachings on Avalokiteśvara by first giving a list of Avalokiteśvara’s samādhis. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: An account of when Śākyamuni was the leader of five hundred merchants who became stranded on the island of the rākṣasīs, and how he alone escaped on Avalokiteśvara in the form of a horse. VII. Sūtra narrative: Śākyamuni says he will describe Avalokiteśvara’s ten pores and their in-habitants and landscapes. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Śākyamuni describes the first and second of Ava-lokiteśvara’s pores: (1) The pore Suvarṇa, where gandharvas dedicated to the Dharma live. (2) The pore Kṛṣṇa, where rishis and gandharvas live who play music that teaches birds and animals, who then remember the name of this very sūtra. VIII. Sūtra narrative: Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin describes the benefits of possessing and writ-ing the sūtra to Buddha Śākyamuni’s approval. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni describes the third of Avalokiteśva-ra’s pores: (3) The pore Ratnakuṇḍala, where female gandharvas live who remember the name of Avalokiteśvara. IX. Sūtra narrative: Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin wishes to go to the pores but Buddha Śākyamu-ni describes how Samantabhadra failed to find the pores in twelve years of searching. Bud-dha Śākyamuni describes how Avalokiteśvara has a subtle form that even he cannot perceive, and that Avalokiteśvara has eleven heads, a hundred thousand arms, and a trillion eyes. Buddha Śākyamuni laughs and tells Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin that it is not yet time for Av-alokiteśvara to come, and then returns to the description of the ten pores. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: He describes the fourth and fifth of Avalokiteśvara’s pores: (4) The pore Amṛtabindu, where devas live on the bhūmis and gandharvas live on moun-tains of gold and silver. (5) The pore Vajramukha, where kiṃnaras live who contemplate the six perfections and human suffering and remember Avalokiteśvara’s name. X.

Buddha Śākyamuni tells him that the buddhas have spent sixteen eons looking for the mahāvidyā but failed to find it. He gives a description of the benefits gained by those who do possess, repeat, and wear it. Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin says he will use his own skin, bone, and blood to write it down if he can obtain it. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Śākyamuni describes how in a previous life he searched through many realms and met trillions of buddhas but failed to find the mahāvidyā. Then Buddha Ratnottama sends him to see Buddha Padmottama, and Śākyamuni tells of his search. A. Buddha Padmottama’s narrative: This is a description of the merit gained by repeating the mahāvidyā and a story of how, in the past, Padmottama searched for the mantra through many realms and met many buddhas but did not find it. Padmottama comes to Amitābha and tells him of his search. Amitābha tells Avalokiteśvara to give the mahāvidyā to Padmottama. Avalokiteśvara describes to Padmottama how to make the maṇḍala of the mahāvidyā so that he may in the future give the mahāvidyā to others. In response to Amitābha’s questions, Avalokiteśvara describes how to give the mahāvidyā if one cannot make such a maṇḍala. Avalokiteśvara gives the mahāvidyā to Padmottama, who returns to his realm. XI. Sūtra narrative: The sūtra does not state specifically that Padmottama gives the mahāvidyā to the Buddha Śākyamuni, and Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin does not ask the Buddha for it but asks where he can go to find it. Buddha Śākyamuni describes the dharmabhāṇaka in Vārāṇasī who possesses the mahāvidyā. Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin goes to Vārāṇasī with a great procession of people and offerings, praises the dharmabhāṇaka, and asks for the mahāvidyā. The dharmabhāṇaka describes the qualities of the mahāvidyā, wrong paths, and the devotion of even Prajñāpāramitā to the mahāvidyā. Avalokiteśvara appears in the sky and tells the dharmabhāṇaka several times to give the mahāvidyā to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin. The dharmabhāṇaka does not create a maṇḍala, as was described by Avalokiteśvara, but simply recites the mahāvidyā to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin. Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin re-turns to the Jetavana grove and tells Buddha Śākyamuni that he has received the mahāvidyā. Trillions of buddhas recite the dhāraṇī of the goddess Cundi: oṃ cale cule cunde svāhā. No explanation for this dhāraṇī is given, so the reader is assumed to be familiar with it. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: Abruptly, without any transition, the description of the last five of Avalokiteśvara’s pores continues from where it had previously been left off. (6) The pore Sūryaprabha, where bodhisattvas dwell. They can see Avalokiteśvara and the seven buddhas when they remember the mahāvidyā. (7) The pore Indrarāja, where irreversible bodhisattvas live. (8) The pore Mahoṣadī, where bodhisattvas who have just developed bodhicitta live, and gandharvas live on mountains. (9) The pore Cittarāja, where pratyekabuddhas live. (10) The pore Dhvajārāja, where buddhas live who teach the six perfections to the hu-mans of Jambudvīpa. XII. Sūtra narrative: Buddha Śākyamuni, in response to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin’s question, says there are no more pores than those ten, but that beyond the last pore, the four oceans come from Avalokiteśvara’s big toe. He states that Avalokiteśvara is coming to give prophecies to Śiva (Maheśvara) and Umādevī about their eventual buddhahood. Avalokiteśvara arrives with a gift of lotus flow-ers from Amitābha. Maheśvara asks the Buddha for a prophecy, and he is sent to Ava-lokiteśvara who prophesies his buddhahood and then does the same for Umādevī. Buddha Śākyamuni, in response to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin’s question, describes the qualities of Avalokiteśvara. 1. Buddha Śākyamuni’s narrative: He gives a description of the inconceivability of Ava-lokiteśvara’s merit and a list of Avalokiteśvara’s samādhis, which differs from that given earlier. Śākyamuni describes his memory of being Bodhisattva Dānaśūra at the time of Buddha Krakucchanda. He sees Samantabhadra with Avalokiteśvara. They each enter different"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY xxi states of samādhis, and Buddha Krakucchanda emphasizes Avalokiteśvara’s superiority. XIII. Sūtra narrative: Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asks for this very sūtra to be taught (although it is near its conclusion), and the Buddha describes the benefits of the sūtra. Sarva-nīvaraṇaviṣkambhin sits silently. Avalokiteśvara and all the other various kinds of beings assembled leave. In an abrupt change of content, Ānanda asks Śākyamuni Buddha about monastic training. Śākyamuni condemns bhikṣus with incorrect conduct, saying they should be banished from the community. He prophesies how in three hundred years, people will use the property and possessions of the Saṅgha or monastery, and describes the sufferings they will endure, such as in the hells. Ānanda leaves, and again the various classes of beings are said to leave (though they had al-ready done so earlier), and the entire world rejoices in the Buddha’s words.

[F.203.b] At the time of this great gathering, light rays shone in the great Avīci hell. Having shone there, they came to the Jetavana Monastery, where they became adornments for the monastery: pillars adorned with divine, precious jewels; multistoried build-ings that were covered with gold; buildings with doors made of gold and silver; buildings with steps made of gold and silver; and upper stories made of gold and sil-ver, the silver upper stories having gold pillars adorned with divine jewels and the gold upper stories having silver pillars adorned with divine jewels. In the gardens around Jetavana, there appeared various kinds of wish-fulfilling trees. They had trunks of gold and leaves of silver and were bedecked with a variety of adornments, with beautiful monastic robes,65 with Kaśika cloth, with hundreds of thousands of pearl necklaces, and with hundreds of thousands of crowns, earrings, braided ribbons, armlets, and anklets. Outside the monastery there appeared hundreds of trees, which, like the wish-fulfilling trees, were made from precious metals and were bedecked with precious bracelets. Within the Jetavana Monastery, there appeared stairs made from diamonds and en-trance chambers hung with pearls and silks.66 Many bathing pools also appeared. Some were completely filled with water that had the eight qualities.67 Some were completely filled with a variety of flowers: they were completely filled with blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, white lotuses,68 tiger claw flowers and great tiger claw flowers,69 and udumbara flowers. Moreover, there were a variety of tree blossoms: magnolia, [F.204.a] ashoka, ole-ander, trumpet flower, mountain ebony, jasmine, and other beautiful tree blossoms. The Jetavana Monastery appeared completely beautified. Then from within that assembly Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin arose from his seat, bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee and facing the Bhagavat, placed his palms together and addressed these words to the Bhagavat: “Bhagavat, I have perceived a great wonderful marvel. Bhagavat, where did these great light rays come from? Who has this power?” The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva70 Avalokiteśvara en-tered the great Avīci hell. When he had completely liberated the beings there, he went to the city of the pretas. It was he who emanated these light rays.”71 Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, as the great Avīci"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 27 hell is without respite, how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter it? In the great Avīci hell a wall encloses a ground made of burning iron, which has be-come one raging flame in the shape of a reed basket. Within this Avīci hell there is a pot from which comes the sound of wailing. Many hundreds of thousands of tens of millions of hundreds of millions of beings have been thrown into that pot. Just as green or black mung beans are massed together in a water-filled vessel, rising and sinking as they are cooked, [F.204.b] that is how the beings in the great Avīci hell undergo physical suffering. Bhagavat, how did Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara enter the great Avīci hell?” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara entered the great Avīci hell just as a cakravartin king enters a grove made of divine jewels. Noble son, it had no affect upon his body. As he approached the Avīci hell, it cooled. The beings that were Yama’s guards were in a state of agitation and extremely terri-fied. They wondered,72 ‘Why has an inauspicious sign appeared in this Avīci hell?’ When the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara entered the Avīci hell, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels appeared, the pot burst open, and the inferno of fire transformed into a pool. On seeing these inauspicious signs appear in Avīci hell, Yama’s guardians be-came dismayed. “Then Yama’s guardians gathered their swords, clubs,73 short spears, long spears, maces, discuses, tridents, and so on, and, taking all their Avīci utensils,74 went to the Dharmarāja Yamarāja. When they arrived, they told him, ‘Divine One, know first that our place of work is completely destroyed.’ “Dharmarāja Yamarāja asked them, ‘Why is your place of work completely de-stroyed?’ “Yama’s guardians answered, ‘Divine One,75 know first that an inauspicious omen appeared in this Avīci hell, all of which became peaceful76 and cool. There entered a handsome being, with his hair in a topknot, his body beautified by divine adorn-ments, with an extremely loving mind, and resembling a golden statue.77 [F.205.a] That is the kind of being that arrived. The moment he arrived, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels appeared, the pot burst open, and the inferno of fire was transformed into a pool.’ “Yamarāja wondered, ‘What deity has manifested this power? Is this a special re-sult that has occurred through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara, Nārāyaṇa, or some other deity? Have they descended to this level? Or has a powerful rākṣasa been born who rivals great Rāvaṇa?’78 “He looked with his divine sight into the heavens, wondering whose blessing this could be. Then he looked back into the Avīci hell and saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there. “Yamarāja went to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, bowed down his head to his feet, and made this special praise: ‘I pay homage to Avalokiteśvara, Maheśva-ra, lover of lotuses, giver of the supreme boon, who has power; who illuminates the world;79 who brings relief; who has a hundred thousand arms; who has a hundred thousand times ten million eyes; who has eleven heads; who reaches Vaḍavāmukha; who delights in the Dharma; who completely frees all beings; who brings relief to turtles, crocodiles, and fish; who creates the greatest mass of wisdom; who brings"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY joy; who is a splendor of jewels; who is sublime; who extinguishes Avīci; who is adorned by the splendor of wisdom; who delights in wisdom; who is the one to whom all devas make offerings, pay homage, and show reverence; who brings free-dom from fear; who teaches the six perfections; who illuminates like the sun;80 [F.205.b] who creates the lamp of Dharma; whose perfectly supreme form is whatev-er form is pleasing; who has the form of a gandharva; who has a form like a moun-tain of gold; who is deep like the vast ocean; who has attained the ultimate yoga; who shows his own face; who has many hundreds of thousands of samādhis; who brings true pleasure; who has a beautified body; who manifests as the supreme ri-shi;81 who brings freedom from the terrors of bondage in stocks and manacles; who is free from all existences; who has many retinues; who creates abundance;82 who is a precious wish-fulfilling jewel; who teaches the path to nirvāṇa; who brings the city of the pretas to an end; who is a parasol for beings; who liberates beings from illness; who has a sacred thread made of the nāga kings Nanda and Upananda;83 who reveals the beneficial lasso; who has hundreds of mantras; who terrifies Vajrapāṇi; who terri-fies the three worlds; who frightens yakṣas, rākṣasas, bhūtas, pretas, and piśācas,84 vetālas, ḍākiṇīs, kūṣmāṇḍas, and apasmāras; who has eyes like blue lotuses; who has profound wisdom;85 who is the lord of knowledge; who brings freedom from all af-flictions; who accumulates various paths to enlightenment; who has entered sacred liberation; who has paths to enlightenment accumulated within his body; who com-pletely liberates pretas; and who has hundreds of thousands of samādhis as numerous as atoms.’ “In that way, Yamarāja praised Avalokiteśvara with a particularly sacred praise. Then Yamarāja circumambulated him three times and departed.” [F.206.a] Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, did Bodhi-sattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave?” The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, he left the Avīci hell and went to the city of the pretas. Many hundreds of thousands of pretas came running toward him. They were like burned tree trunks; they were like standing skeletons; they were covered with hair; they had stomachs the size of mountains and mouths the size of a needle’s eye. “As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived at the city of the pretas, it cooled and the vajra hail ceased. The staff-wielding guard at the gates, who had thick calves and red eyes, became kind and said, ‘I should not be performing this duty.’ “Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s mind was filled with compassion on seeing these beings, and he emitted ten rivers from his ten fingers; he emitted ten riv-ers from his ten toes; and he emitted great rivers from all his pores. When the pretas tasted the water, their throats widened, their bodies became whole, and they were completely satisfied by the supreme flavor of divine food. “Then they contemplated the human existence.86 They thought about saṃsāric ex-istence in this way: ‘Oh! The humans in Jambudvīpa are happy. They can perfectly enjoy cool shade. Happy are those humans in Jambudvīpa who are always supporting their parents and honoring them.

Noble son, not even the tathāgatas have Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara’s prowess.” Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked, “Bhagavat, how is that so?” [F.207.a] The Bhagavat replied, “Noble son, there appeared in this world the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct,89 the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavat Vipaśyin. “At that time, Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, I was a merchant named Sugandhamu-kha, and I heard Tathāgata Vipaśyin describe the qualities of Avalokiteśvara.” Then Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “What were the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara that you heard the tathāgata de-scribe?” The Bhagavat replied, “Āditya and Candra came from his eyes, Maheśvara came from his forehead, Brahmā came from his shoulders, Nārāyaṇa came from his heart, Devi Sarasvatī came from his canines, Vāyu came from his mouth, Dharaṇī came from his feet, and Varuṇa came from his stomach. “When those deities had come from Avalokiteśvara’s body, that bhagavat said these words to the deity Maheśvara: ‘Maheśvara, in the kaliyuga, when beings have bad natures, you will be declared to be the primal deity who is the creator, the maker. All those beings will be excluded from the path to enlightenment. They will say these words to ordinary beings: ‘It is said: the sky is his liṅga, The earth is his seat.

At that time, light rays of various colors emanated from the mouth of Bha-gavat Śikhin. They were blue, yellow, red, white, orange, and the color of crystal and of silver. They shone on all worlds in the ten directions, then returned and entered the mouth of the bhagavat. “From within that assembly Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi arose from his seat, bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee and facing Bhagavat Śikhin, placed his palms together and addressed these words to him: [F.208.a] ‘Bhagavat, why did this sign appear?’ “Bhagavat Śikhin replied, ‘Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is coming from the realm of Sukhāvatī. I manifest this kind of sign when he is coming. When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes, a profusion of wish-granting trees appears, a profusion of mango trees appears, star jasmine flowers and magnolia trees appear, ponds covered with flowers appear, and precious trees appear. There is a rain of various flowers,92 a rain of precious stones—jewels, pearls, diamonds, ber-yl, conch, crystal, and coral—and there is a rain of divine cloth. In the vicinity of the monastery the seven jewels of a cakravartin appear—the precious wheel, the pre-cious horse, the precious elephant, the precious jewel,93 the precious wife, the pre-cious householder, and the precious counselor—and the ground appears to be made of gold. When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara comes from the realm of Su-khāvatī, the entire world shakes six times.’ “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin, ‘Bhagavat, what are these omens of?’ “Bhagavat Śikhin answered, ‘Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is arriving, and that is why these omens appear.’ “As the earth shook and it rained beautiful lotuses, [F.208.b] Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara came to Bhagavat Śikhin. He was holding lotus flowers, each with a thousand petals and a golden stem. He bowed down his head to the bha-gavat’s feet and offered the lotuses to him. He said, ‘Tathāgata Amitābha sends these flowers to you. The Tathagāta asks if you are in health, if you are at ease, and if all is well.’94 “Bhagavat Śikhin took the lotuses and placed them on his left. He then spoke of"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 31 the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. ‘How did you, Ava-lokiteśvara, accomplish your task among the pretas, the beings in the Avīci hell, the beings in Kālasūtra and Raurava, the beings in Hāhava, Tāpana, the great hell Pretāyana, the great hell Agnighaṭa, the great hell Śālmali,95 the great hell Śītodaka, and others?’96 “Avalokiteśvara replied, ‘The beings in those great hells are my task. I will com-pletely ripen those beings, and then I will bring them to the highest complete enlight-enment.’ “Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, having given this answer, bowed his head to the bhagavat’s feet, departed alone,97 and disappeared into the sky as a blaz-ing mass of fire. “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin, ‘Bhagavat, if I may ask for an answer to a question, how much merit has Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara accumulated?’ [F.209.a] “Bhagavat Śikhin replied, ‘If someone were for a deva’s eon to serve tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats,98 necessary medicine, and utensils—the merit that would be produced through those tathāgatas would be the same as that of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if it were to rain day and night on the four great continents for a twelve-month year, I could count each drop, but, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, the ocean is 84,000 yojanas deep and has an immeasurable expanse, but I can count each drop all the way down to Vaḍavāmu-kha. However, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśva-ra’s accumulation of merit. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count every hair on all the four-legged creatures in the four great continents, such as lions, tigers, bears, hyenas, deer, camels, jackals,99 and so on, and oxen, donkeys, cattle, elephants, horses, buffalo, and cats, but, noble son, I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if stūpas100 for tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as atoms were made in divine gold and precious stones, [F.209.b] and in one day the relics were placed in them all, I can calculate the accumulation of that merit, but I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count the number of leaves in a for-est of agarwood trees, but I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśva-ra’s accumulation of merit. “‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if all the women, men, boys, and girls in the four great continents were to gain the result of becoming stream entrants, once-returners, non-returners, arhats, and pratyekabuddhas, their merit would only be, as said before, equal to the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara.’ “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin, ‘Bhagavat, I have never"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY seen nor heard of tathāgatas having the kind of accumulation of merit that Bodhisatt-va Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has, let alone bodhisattvas.’ “Bhagavat Śikhin said, ‘Noble son, even if all who are tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas like me were gathered in one place and provided for an eon with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats, necessary medicine, and utensils, those tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas [F.210.a] would still not be able to calculate Bodhi-sattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit. So, noble son, it is need-less to say that I cannot do so all by myself in this world. “‘Those who remember Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s name will have happiness in this world. They will be completely freed from the sufferings of aging, death, and illness. They will be freed from the unavoidable sufferings of saṃsāra. Like white and pale yellow birds, like kings of geese moving with the speed of the wind, they will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī. They will hear the Dharma by listening to Tathāgata Amitābha teach. The sufferings of saṃsāra will not afflict their bodies. They will not become old or die. They will have no desire, anger, or stupidity. Their bodies will feel no hunger or thirst. They will not know the suffering of being inside a womb. Completely inspired by the taste of the Dharma, they will be reborn within a lotus and will remain in that realm until Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s powerful commitment is fulfilled and all beings have been brought to liberation.’ “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi asked Bhagavat Śikhin, ‘Bhagavat, when will that powerful commitment be fulfilled?’ “Bhagavat Śikhin replied, ‘He completely ripens the many beings who circle in saṃsāra, teaches them the path to enlightenment, and teaches the Dharma in whatev-er form a being can be taught through. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a tathāgata to beings who are to be taught by a tathāgata.

That, noble son, is how Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara completely ripens beings and teaches them the Dharma of nirvāṇa.’ “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi said to Bhagavat Śikhin, ‘Bhagavat, this is extraor-dinarily marvelous. I have never seen nor heard of such a thing before. Not even the tathāgatas have what Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has.’ “Bhagavat Śikhin said, ‘Noble son, in this Jambudvīpa there is a cave named Va-jrakukṣi in which a hundred thousand million times ten million asuras live. Bodhi-sattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the asuras there in the form of an asura. He teaches them the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. He says to the listening asuras,102 “You must listen.” ‘Then all other asuras, with loving minds and peaceful minds, with palms placed together, come to listen to this Dharma teaching from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara: “Those who turn their minds to this king of the sūtras will have happiness in this world. Hearing it will purify them of the five actions with immediate results on death. At the time of death, twelve tathāgatas will come and reassure them, saying, ‘Noble son, do not be afraid. You have heard the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. You have prepared various paths for going to Sukhāvatī. [F.211.b] You have prepared various parasols, various crowns, various earrings, and various necklaces.’ When that kind of omen appears, at death they will go without impediment to Sukhāvatī.” ‘Ratnapāṇi, in that way, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma of nirvāṇa to the asuras and shows them the entranceway to nirvāṇa.’ “Then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi bowed his head to Bhagavat Śikhin’s feet and de-parted.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat, “It is very difficult, Bhagavat, to hear the manifold description of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities.” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, there will be a description of Avalokiteśvara’s qualities after he has left Vajrakukṣi and come to the land of iron. Listen to it at that time. Before that there is this teaching:103 “In a later time, there was the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of devas and humans, the buddha, the bhagavat Viśvabhū. “At that time, Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, I was a rishi who taught patience and lived in a cliff among the mountains where people did not go. At that time, I heard Tathāgata Viśvabhū describe the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. “Avalokiteśvara had gone to the land of gold and taught the eightfold noble path, the Dharma that teaches nirvāṇa, to the upside-down beings104 who lived there. “Then he left the land of gold and went to the land of silver. Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to the four-legged beings who lived there, ‘You"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY must listen with perfect, pure thought to this Dharma teaching on contemplating nir-vāṇa, on turning the mind to nirvāṇa.’ Then Avalokiteśvara taught them the Dharma. “Those beings sat before Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and said to him: [F.212.a] ‘Show the path to blind beings! Be a protector and refuge to beings who have no protector! Be a father and mother to those who do not have a father and mother! Be a lamp for the darkness of the three lower existences! Be aware of us and show us, with great compassion, the path to liberation.105 The beings who have ob-tained and always remember your name are happy; they are free from this kind of suffering that we experience.’ “Then the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Dis-play, issued forth into the ears of those beings. When they heard it, they reached an irreversible level and were established in the highest happiness. [B.2] “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara left for another land, which was made of iron, where he approached the asura king Bali.106 “When the asura king Bali saw Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approach-ing from the distance, he went toward Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, ac-companied by his queens, his retinue, and many asuras such as Kubja and Vāmanaka107 with their retinues. Bali bowed down at his feet and said these words: ‘On this day, my life has borne fruit. On this day, my wishes have been fulfilled. On this day, my wishes have been fulfilled, for I am completely happy on actually seeing you.’ “Bali offered a bejeweled throne to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and said, ‘Bhagavat, look with compassion upon those who like to perform bad actions, who lust after the wives of others, [F.212.b] who are dedicated to killing, who kill others, and who are old and dying. Be a refuge to those who are weary of saṃsāra. You, lord, be our father and mother and show the path to we who are bound in bondage.’ “Avalokiteśvara said, ‘Noble son, it is like this: I will explain how much merit is acquired by those who give alms to a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyaksaṃbuddha. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, were there to be as many bodhisattvas like myself as there are grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers, and were they to be in one place with every facility for a deva’s eon, they would still be unable to calculate that aggregation of merit. So it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by myself in the realm of the asuras. ‘Noble son, it is like this: I can, for example, count how many atoms there are, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count each drop in the vast extent of the ocean, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if all the men, women, boys, and girls in the four continents were to apply themselves to work, and those people in the four continents were to do no other work than growing mustard, and from time to time the king of the nāgas would send down rain, and the mustard would grow perfectly for"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 35 one harvest; and then if the men, women, boys, and girls were to load that mustard into carts, bags, and baskets, onto camels, donkeys, and cattle, and collect the great harvest together; and then if the donkeys and cattle threshed it to make a vast heap of mustard seeds, [F.213.a] noble son, I could count each one of those grains, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, the lower half of the supreme mountain Sumeru extends downward for 84,000 yojanas and the upper half extends upward for 84,000 yojanas. Noble son, if Sumeru were to become a mass of birch bark; if the vast ocean was to become an inkwell; and if all the men, women, boys, and girls who live in the four continents were to become scribes; and if they were to write on the limitless, endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark, I would be able to count each letter, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giving. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if all those scribes were to become bodhi-sattvas on the tenth bhūmi, then the accumulation of merit of all those bodhisattvas on the tenth bhūmi would then equal the accumulation of merit through that alms giving. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count each grain of sand in the ocean, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit through that alms giv-ing.’ “Then the asura king Bali, with tears, a darkened face,108 choking, with stuttering words and sighs, said these words to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara: ‘What kind of gift did I, Bali, make, with my queens and retinue, that brought me bondage in this lifetime? I made an offering to a bad recipient, and I am now experi-encing the result of that action. Even a handful of dust thrown toward an omniscient one transforms into amṛta, but I made my offerings not knowing that, [F.213.b] and made an offering to a petitioner who came to me in the form of a dwarf. ‘I had prepared offerings of elephant- and horse-drawn carts carrying diadems, earrings, and necklaces, hung with precious yak-tail whisks, and covered with strings of pearls, a net of pearls as a rear adornment, and jingling golden bells hanging from silver cords. ‘I had also prepared offerings of a thousand tawny cows with silver hooves, golden horns, and covered with nets of pearls. ‘I had also prepared an offering of a thousand young women with excellent com-plexions, who were full-bodied, very beautiful, similar to and rivaling divine maid-ens; adorned with divine jewelry; wearing diadems, earrings, and necklaces; adorned with armlets, bracelets, anklets, and girdles; and wearing rings, sash necklaces, and gold rings on the big toes of their left feet.109 They jingled as they moved, and wore clothing of silks in a variety of colors. ‘I had also prepared a hundred thousand precious seats, numerous heaps of gold, heaps of silver, and heaps of jewels. ‘I had prepared numerous heaps of clothing and jewelry. ‘I had prepared many hundreds of thousands of herds of cows along with herders. ‘I had prepared numerous kinds of food and drink. I had prepared divine food with"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY supreme flavors. ‘I had continuously prepared bejeweled bells of gold and silver, many bejeweled lion thrones of silver and gold, many thousands of divine yak-tail whisks, parasols, shoes adorned with gold, and bejeweled gold diadems. ‘At that time, I had invited a thousand kings, a hundred thousand Brahmins, and many hundreds of thousands of kṣatriyas, and I became arrogant on seeing110 that I was their sole ruler. [F.214.a] ‘I now confess my first bad action. I tore out the hearts of the kṣatriya wives, slaughtered the boys and girls, bound all the great kṣatriyas in stocks111 and shackles, and took them to a copper cave. I imprisoned many hundreds of thousands of kṣatri-yas in that copper cave. I fastened the legs and arms of those kṣatriyas, such as the Khasas and Pāṇḍavas, with iron chains and iron pegs to keep them in that cave. ‘I made doors for the cave: the first door was made of wood, the second door was made of acacia, the third door was made of bronze, the fourth door was made of cop-per, the fifth door was made of iron, the sixth door was made of silver, and the sev-enth door was made of gold. Then I heaped seven mountains, one on top of the other, in front of the golden door.112 ‘Then I went in search of Daśarathaputra,113 one day in the form of a beggar, one day in the form of a bee, one day in the form of a pig, and one day in the form of a man, transforming into a different form each day, but I did not see him. ‘Then, after contemplating, I began to make my offerings. Daśarathaputra, seizing the opportunity, quickly removed the seven mountains, throwing them to another place. He then shouted loudly to the kṣatriyas. Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula, Sahadeva, Bhīmasena, Arjuna, the Kauravas, and the other kings heard him and were relieved and comforted.114 ‘Daśarathaputra asked, “Are you alive or dead?” ‘They replied, “We are alive, Bhagavat.” ‘Then the great hero destroyed all the doors and looked inside the copper cave. All the bound kings saw Nārāyaṇa. They discussed among each other, saying, “Either the time has come for the asura king Bali to die, [F.214.b] or the time has come for us to be slain.” They said to each other, “It is good if we die in battle, but it’s not good to die in chains. If we die in chains, the way of the kṣatriyas will come to an end, but if we die on the battlefield, we will be reborn in the higher realms.” ‘Then all the great kings returned to their own cities and made preparations with many horse-drawn chariots. ‘While they prepared their very precious chariots and weapons, Daśarathaputra transformed himself into a dwarf who wore a deerskin as a sash, held a bamboo staff, and carried a stool. He came to where I was and arrived at my door. ‘The guard stationed there said, “Brahmin dwarf, you can’t enter.” ‘He said, “I have come a long way ‘Then the guard asked, “Brahmin, where do you come from?” ‘He answered, “I have come to the rishi king from Candradvīpa.” ‘Then the guard came to me115 and said, “Your Majesty, a Brahmin dwarf has ar-rived here.” ‘I, the lord of the asuras, asked, “What is it that he requires?”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 37 ‘The guard said, “Your Majesty, I don’t know.” ‘Then I said, “Go and bring the Brahmin to me.” ‘The guard summoned him, saying, “Come in, great Brahmin.” ‘Then he came inside and was placed on a precious seat. ‘Śukra, who was renowned as my upādhyāya, was also present at this time and said to me, “This is a person who brings doom.116 He will certainly cause you an ob-stacle.” ‘I asked him, “Bhagavat, how do you know that?” ‘Śukra answered, “I know by seeing his signs and omens.” ‘I asked, “What can we do?” [F.215.a] ‘Nārāyaṇa thought, “If he thinks about this, he will definitely decide against mak-ing a gift, so I will put divinely inspired speech into his mouth.” ‘So I said, “Come here, Brahmin. What is your wish?” ‘The Brahmin answered, “I ask for two steps of ground.” ‘I said, “Great Brahmin, if you are asking for two steps, I will give you three.” ‘The dwarf accepted this gift, saying, “This is auspicious.” He accepted it along with a gift of water, sesame, and gold, and then vanished. ‘Śukra said to me, “Rishi King, I said that this was a man of doom who had come, but you did not pay heed to what I said. So may you experience the result of your actions!” ‘Then Nārāyaṇa appeared in his own form. He was vast, with the sun and moon on his shoulders, and holding a sword, a bow, a wheel, a long spear, and a short spear117 in his hands. I, lord of the asuras, became faint, grew dizzy, fell headlong, and said, “What have I done? I have taken poison with my own hand!” ‘Nārāyaṇa took two steps and said, “Give me my third step!” ‘I said, “There can be no third. You have taken all the ground that can be taken. What can I do?” ‘Nārāyaṇa said, “Wherever I place you, there shall you stay.” ‘Then I, lord of the asuras, said to him, “Whatever you command, that I will do.” ‘Nārāyaṇa asked, “Is this true? Is this true?” ‘I answered, “It’s the truth, it’s the truth.” ‘Thus Nārāyaṇa caught me in the noose of truth. The offering site was destroyed and the offering bowls discarded. The Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas took away the maid-ens. The Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, and the others118 took away the golden lion thrones, the divine parasols, the bejeweled shoes, the clothing, the jewelry, the bejeweled golden armlets, [F.215.b] and the tawny cows, destroying the offering site. ‘I, lord of the asuras, having been expelled from the offering site,119 contemplated my situation and said, “I was about to make an excellent offering, but I made an un-fortunate offering that has resulted in this bondage. Homage to you, lord. Do what is to be done. It will be as you do.”120 ‘Then Nārāyaṇa took me, my queens, and my retinue and placed us in the under-world. ‘I121 have this to say to the bhagavat: In the past I made that gift to a bad recipient, and now I am experiencing the result of that action. ‘Be my refuge, holder of beautiful lotuses."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY ‘I make this praise to the one who wears a matted topknot; to the one who has an omniscient buddha122 upon his head; to the one who brings relief to many beings; to the one who has compassion for the inferior and desolate; to the one who has beauti-ful eyes like parasols; to the one who has illuminated the world;123 to the one who is a supreme king of healing; to the one who is a perfectly pure being; to the one who has the supreme attainment of yoga; to the one who has perfect liberation; to the one who is a lover of liberation; to the one who is like a wish-fulfilling jewel; to the one who protects the treasure of the Dharma; to the one who is a teacher of the six per-fections; and to the one whose thoughts are good. ‘The beings who remember your name, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, will have happiness.

The beings who remember your name will have good thoughts. They will go to the realm of Sukhāvatī, and listen to the Dharma from Tathāgata Amitābha.’ “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara made a prophecy to Bali, the lord of the asuras: [F.216.a] ‘You, lord of the asuras, will become the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of devas and hu-mans, the buddha, the bhagavat Śrī. You will guide all the asuras. In your buddha realm there will not be the word desire, there will not be the word anger, there will not be the word ignorance, and you will come into possession of the six-syllable mahāvidyā.’ “As a gift for requesting the Dharma, Bali presented Avalokiteśvara with strings of pearls worth a hundred thousand silver coins125 and diadems adorned with various jewels. “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara began to teach the Dharma. ‘Listen, great king. Human beings are continually thinking about transitory things, about acquisitions,126 about great pleasures, about male and female slaves, servants, and hired workers, about costly clothes, beds, and seats, about valuable treasures, riches, stores of grain, and storerooms, about sons and daughters, and about wives and parents. They are ignorant. Those things that they are attached to appear as dreams do. ‘At the time of death, there will be no one to protect them. When they are separat-ed from their lives they will look back at Jambudvīpa. They will see the great river filled with pus and blood. They will see the great trees that blaze with fire, blaze strongly, and blaze fiercely. When they see them they will be terrified. Yama’s guards127 will bind them with nooses and drag them away. When their feet are cut through on the great road of razors, as they lift that foot another foot will replace it. [F.216.b] Numerous ravens, vultures, eagles, and dogs will devour them. They will experience the sensation of great suffering in the hells. When they step off the great road of razors, five hundred thorns, each with sixteen spikes, will pierce each foot. They will cry out, “What have I, who delighted in bad actions, done?”128 ‘Yama’s servants will reply, “Friend, you did not offer alms to the Tathāgata. You did not hear the gaṇḍī being beaten. You did not circumambulate a stūpa anywhere.”"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 39 ‘Then they will reply, “We were without faith, delighted in bad actions, rejected the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, and are experiencing the result of those actions.” ‘Then Yama’s guardians will take them to King Yama, bring them before him, and present them to him. ‘King Yama will say to the guardians, “Show them today your place of work!” ‘Then Yama’s guardians will bring them to the great Kālasūtra hell and put them into it. Inside there, though a hundred spears strike them, they will not die. Though a hundred spears strike them a second time, they will not die.

There will be no one to protect them in that other world. Therefore, great king, you must diligently create merit in this life.’ “In that way Avalokiteśvara gave Bali the appropriate Dharma teaching. [F.217.a] Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to that great king, ‘I must leave, for today many are gathering in the Jetavana Monastery.’129 “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara radiated many blue, yellow, red, white, crystal, and silver light rays that reached Tathāgata Viśvabhū, before whom devas, nāgas, yakṣas, mahoragas, and humans had gathered. “From within that assembly of bodhisattvas the bodhisattva named Gaganagañja arose from his seat, bared one shoulder, and kneeling on his right knee and facing Bhagavat Viśvabhū, placed his palms together and addressed these words to him: ‘Bhagavat, where did these light rays come from?’ “Bhagavat Viśvabhū said, ‘Noble son, the light rays came from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, who is in the palace of Bali, the lord of the asuras.’ “Bodhisattva Gaganagañja then asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū, ‘Is there a way for me to see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara?’ “Bhagavat Viśvabhū answered, ‘Noble son, he is coming here.’ “When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara left the palace of Bali, lord of the asuras, divine flowers fell on Jetavana Monastery, and extremely beautiful wish-granting trees appeared there. They were hung with hundreds of thousands of adorn-ments, with many hundreds of thousands of strings of pearls, with silk, with monastic robes,130 and with clusters of garlands. Their trunks were red, and their leaves were made of gold and silver. There were also many trees made of coral, many blossom-covered trees, [F.217.b] and pools that were completely filled with flowers. “Then Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū, ‘Bhagavat, is Bodhi-sattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara not coming?’ “Bhagavat Viśvabhū answered, ‘Noble son, he has left the palace of Bali, lord of the asuras, and is going to an extremely dreadful land131 named Tamondhakāra where there are no humans.

It has been a long time since you were here in Tamondhakāra.’ “He answers, ‘I have been doing much. I have not been ripening my own mind for the sake of one being, but have been, with the motivation of great compassion, ripen-ing many beings.’132 “The yakṣas and rākṣasas lead him to a lion throne of divine gold and jewels, upon which he sits.

Those who hear and then possess, study, promulgate,134 and have their minds com-pletely focused on even one four-line verse135 of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will be inspired to accumulate merit. ‘Noble sons, it is like this: For example, I know the number of atoms that exist, but, noble sons, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. ‘Noble sons, it is like this: For example, I can count the drops in the vast ocean, but, noble sons, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from even one four-line verse136 of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. [F.218.a] ‘Noble sons, if tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers were gathered together in one place and for twelve eons were provided with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats,137 necessary medicine, and utensils, they would still not be able to calculate the merit that comes from even one four-line verse138 of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display. So it is needless to say that I cannot do so all by my-self in Tamondhakāra. ‘Noble sons, it is like this: For example, even if all the households in the four con-tinents built monasteries of gold and jewels and built a thousand stūpas inside each of those monasteries, and in one day inserted relics in them all, the accumulation of merit from one four-line verse139 of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, would be far greater than the merit from inserting the relics. ‘Noble sons, it is like this: For example, just as the five great rivers flow into the great ocean, noble son, in that same way merit accumulates from one four-line verse140 of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Dis-play.’ “Then the yakṣas and rākṣasas asked Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, ‘What kind of accumulation of merit is obtained by those beings who write out this precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display?’ ‘Noble sons, their accumulation of merit is immeasurable. Those who engage in writing out the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Dis-play, are engaged in writing the 84,000 compilations of the Dharma.

Wherever they are reborn, in every life they will remember their previous lives. Their bodies will have an aroma like gośīrṣa sandalwood. From their mouths will come the scent of the blue lotus. Their bodies will be completely perfect, and they will have im-mense, powerful strength.’ “In that way Avalokiteśvara taught them an appropriate Dharma. Some of the yakṣas and rākṣasas attained the result of becoming a once-returner. The others at-tained the result of becoming a non-returner.141 The yakṣas and rākṣasas then said, ‘Stay here.142 Do not go anywhere else. We will build a stūpa of divine gold in Ta-mondhakāra. We will create a circumambulatory walkway of gold.’ “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to them, ‘I have to bring many beings onto the path to enlightenment.’ “Then the yakṣas and rākṣasas, resting cheeks on hands, brooded and said to each other, ‘Our Avalokiteśvara is going to leave us, and we will not be able to talk about the Dharma with him.’ “As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was leaving, the yakṣas and rākṣasas followed him. Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara said to them, ‘It is too far for you to come, so you should go back.’ “The yakṣas and rākṣasas bowed down at the feet of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara and returned. “Then Avalokiteśvara vanished into the sky as a mass of flames.” “Avalokiteśvara then manifested in the form of a Brahmin and went among the devas in the Śuddhāvāsa realms. [F.219.a] “Among those devas there was a deva named Sukuṇḍala who was poor and suffer-ing. Avalokiteśvara came to that deva in the form of the Brahmin and said to him, ‘I’m hungry and thirsty.’ “The deva said to the Brahmin, ‘Great Brahmin, I have nothing at all.’ “The Brahmin said, ‘You should give me what little you have.’ “So Sukuṇḍala entered his divine palace and looked inside his pots. He saw that some pots had become completely filled with priceless precious jewels, other pots had become completely filled with food that had the supreme flavors, and the left side of the divine palace had become completely filled with divine clothing. Sukuṇḍala thought, ‘Without a doubt the one at my door is an excellent recipient for offerings, and he has brought me this attainment of splendor.’ “Sukuṇḍala invited the Brahmin into his divine palace. The Brahmin entered, and Sukuṇḍala offered him the divine jewels, served him the food with divine perfect flavors, and gave him the divine clothing.143 The Brahmin ate and recited a benedic-tion. “Deva Sukuṇḍala then asked him, ‘Great Brahmin, where do you come from?’ “He replied, ‘I come from the monastery named Jetavana.’ “Sukuṇḍala then asked him, ‘What is that place like?’"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY “The Brahmin answered, ‘It is a place that is delightful, filled with divine jewels, and completely beautified by divine wish-granting trees. There are beautiful flowers, many kinds of bathing pools, many who have the qualities of right conduct and are worthy recipients for offerings, and there are the miracles of Tathāgata Viśvabhū. Son of a deva, that is how pleasant that place is.’ “The deva then said, ‘Brahmin, you definitely speak the truth. Who are you? Are you a deva or a human? If you are a human you don’t seem to be one.’ [F.219.b] “The Brahmin replied, ‘I am not a deva and I am not a human. I am one who has compassion for the poor and the wretched. I am one who shows them the path to en-lightenment. I am a bodhisattva.’ “Deva Sukuṇḍala then offered his diadem and earrings to the Brahmin and recited: ‘Oh, the one who is comprised of qualities Is devoid of all evil. On this day the seed has been planted, And on this day the fruit has been produced.’ “After the deva had recited this verse, the Brahmin departed.” “The great Brahmin descended from the deva realms to the island of Siṃhala. Arriv-ing there, he transformed himself into a handsome form and approached the rākṣasīs. When they saw his handsome body they desired him. Desiring him, they came to him and said, ‘Sir, take us young women. We have no husband. For we who have no hus-band, be a husband. For we who have no protector, be a protector. For we who have no support, be a support. These are your homes with food; homes with drink; homes with clothes and a variety of multicolored beds,144 beautiful gardens, and beautiful pools.’ “He said, ‘Only if you do as I command.’ “They answered, ‘We will!’ “He then taught them the noble eightfold path. He made them recite the fourfold scriptures. Some of them attained the result of becoming a once-returner, and some attained the result of becoming a non-returner.145 The rākṣasīs were no longer afflict-ed by the suffering of desire; there was no anger in their minds; they did not wish to cause anyone’s death; they continually delighted in the Dharma; and they took vows. They promised, ‘We shall kill no more. We will nourish ourselves in the same way that humans do in Jambudvīpa: with food and drink. From now on we will not act like rākṣasīs, and we will keep the upāsikā vows.’146 In this way the rākṣasīs took vows.” “Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then left the island of Siṃhala [F.220.a] and went to a place where many hundreds of thousands of different kinds of insects lived within a cesspit in the great city of Vārāṇasī. When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrived there, he transformed himself into the form of a bee that made a buzzing sound that was heard by the insects as the words, “Namo buddhāya, namo dharmāya, namaḥ saṃghāya.”147 The insects remembered the words namo"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 43 buddhāya, namo dharmāya, namaḥ saṃghāya,148 and the thunderbolt of wisdom de-stroyed the mountain, which has twenty peaks, that is the view of the aggregates as a self,149 and they were then all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas named Sugandhamukha.” “After Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara had ripened those beings, he left the great city of Vārāṇasī. “Then he went to Magadha. When he arrived in the land of Magadha, he saw be-ings that had lived for twenty years in the wilderness eating each other’s flesh. Bo-dhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara wondered, ‘By what method can I bring contentment to these beings?’ “Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara then caused divine rains to fall. First there was a rain of water, and the water brought them satisfaction. Then there came a rain of divine food with supreme flavors, and they were completely filled. When they were completely satisfied by eating the food, a rain of grain fell. Then there fell ses-ame, rice, jujubes, and wild rice. Whatever those beings wished for, their wishes were fulfilled each time. “Those beings in the land of Magadha were amazed, and they all sat down150 to-gether. Seated,151 they asked each other, ‘What deity manifested all of this?’ “Among them there was one being who was many hundreds of thousands of years old. He was aged, old, feeble, hunchbacked, and bent like a cow’s ear. He said to them, ‘Only Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has this kind of power [F.220.b], no other deity.’ “Then those gathered there asked him, ‘What are the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara?’ “Then the man began to describe Avalokiteśvara’s qualities to them: ‘He is a lamp for those in darkness. He is a parasol for those burned and pained by the sun. He is a river for those afflicted with thirst. He gives freedom from fear to those who are ter-rified and afraid. He is medicine for those afflicted with sickness. He is a father and mother for beings who suffer. He is a teacher of nirvāṇa to those reborn in Avīci. Those are his special qualities. ‘Those who remember his name will have happiness in this world and will com-pletely leave behind every suffering in saṃsāra. ‘Those who continually gather and offer flowers and incense to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will become cakravartin kings who possess the seven jewels. The seven jewels are: the precious wheel, the precious horse, the precious elephant, the precious jewel, the precious wife, the precious householder, and the precious counselor. ‘Those who offer flowers to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have ar-omatic bodies, and wherever they are reborn, their bodies will be perfect.’ “The old man taught Avalokiteśvara’s special qualities in that way. Then those gathered there returned to their homes, and the aged man, having taught them an ap-propriate Dharma, returned to his home, and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara [F.221.a] vanished into the sky.”"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY “While Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was in the sky he thought, ‘It has been a long time since I’ve seen Tathāgata Viśvabhū,’ and so he next went to Jeta-vana Monastery. Bhagavat Viśvabhū saw him coming. “As Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approached the Jetavana monastery, he saw devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, hu-mans, and nonhumans, and a gathering of many hundreds of bodhisattvas. “Bodhisattva Gaganagañja asked Bhagavat Viśvabhū, ‘Bhagavat, which bodhisatt-va is arriving?’ “Bhagavat Viśvabhū said, ‘This is Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who is arriving.’ “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara bowed his head to Bhagavat Viśvabhū’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and sat on his left. “Bhagavat Viśvabhū asked him, ‘Are you tired? Are you weary? Noble son, what work have you been doing?’ “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara told Viśvabhū what had occurred. Bodhisattva Gaganagañja was extremely amazed and said, ‘I have never seen such a field of activity as that of this bodhisattva. There is no such field of activity among the tathāgatas, let alone among the bodhisattvas.’ “Then Bodhisattva Gaganagañja came to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and sat before him. Seated,152 he asked Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, ‘Are you tired? Are you weary?’ “He replied, ‘I am not tired and I am not weary.’ “They talked with each other and then became silent. [F.221.b] “Then Bhagavat Viśvabhū began to teach upon the six perfections: ‘Noble sons, listen. Having become a bodhisattva, you must complete the perfection of generosity. Similarly, you must complete the perfection of conduct, the perfection of patience, the perfection of diligence, the perfection of meditation, and the perfection of wis-dom.’ “Having taught that Dharma he became silent. “Then the assembled beings each returned to their own dwelling places, and the bodhisattvas returned to their own buddha realms.” This completes part one of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 45 Part Two Then Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin addressed these words to the Bhagavat: “Bhagavat, I request that you teach what samādhis Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara has previously remained in.” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, they are like this: The samādhi named Creation, the samādhi named Illumination, the samādhi named Sublime Vajra, the samādhi named Sunlight, the samādhi named Dispersal, the samādhi named Armlet, the samādhi named Supreme Vajra Victory Banner, the samādhi named Ornament, the samādhi named King of Arrays, the samādhi named Seeing the Ten Directions, the samādhi named The Supreme Illumination of the Wish-fulfilling Jewel,153 the samādhi named Dharma Holder,154 the samādhi named Descending into the Ocean,155 the samādhi named Totally Stable,156 the samādhi named Giving Joy,157 the samādhi named Vajra Victory Banner,158 the samādhi named Viewing All Worlds,159 the samādhi named Completely Present,160 [F.222.a] the samādhi named Truly Bowing Down, the samādhi named Coiled at the Crown, the samādhi named Supreme Illumination by the Moon,161 the samādhi named Many Attendants, the samādhi named Divine Bright Earrings,162 the samādhi named Lamp of the Eon,163 the samādhi named Manifesting Miracles, the samādhi named Supreme Lotus, the samādhi named King’s Power,164 the samādhi named Extinguishing Avīci, the samādhi named Blazing, the samādhi named Divine Circle,165 the samādhi named Drop of Amṛta, the samādhi named Circle of Light, the samādhi named Immersion in the Ocean, the samādhi named Door of the Celestial Palace, the samādhi named Cuckoo’s Song, the samādhi named Scent of the Blue Lotus, the samādhi named Mounted, the samādhi named Vajra Armor, the samādhi named Elephant’s Delight, the samādhi named Lion’s Play, the samādhi named Unsurpassable, the samādhi named Subduing, the samādhi named Moon on High, the samādhi named Shining, the samādhi named Hundred Light Rays, the samādhi named Sprinkling, the samādhi named Brightening, the samādhi named Beautiful Appearance, the samādhi named Summoning the Asuras, the samādhi named Meditation, the samādhi named Sum-moning Nirvāṇa, the samādhi named Great Lamp,166 the samādhi named Liberation of Sensation,167 the samādhi named King of Lamps,168 the samādhi named Creating the Supreme State,169 the samādhi named Creating Indestructibility,170 the samādhi named Facing the Deities,171 the samādhi named Creating Union, the samādhi named Teaching Ultimate Truth, the samādhi named Lightning, the samādhi named Array of Names,172 the samādhi named Gaping Lion, the samādhi named Face of Arcturus,173"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY [F.222.b] the samādhi named Approaching, the samādhi named Flash of Intelli-gence,174 the samādhi named Increasing Power of Mindfulness, the samādhi named Aspiration, the samādhi named Carriage of Victory, and the samādhi named Teach-ing the Path. “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has those samādhis.

Even the tathāgatas do not have that kind of accumulation of merit, let alone a bodhisattva. [B.3] “Noble son, in the past, when I was a bodhisattva named Siṃhalarāja,175 I was going to the island of Siṃhala with five hundred merchants. We were going to Siṃhala Island bringing much merchandise in chariots, in bags, baskets, and pots, carried by camels, oxen, donkeys, and so on, so as to go to villages, towns, suburbs, cities, and markets. “I found an excellent ship that had been to Siṃhala Island many times. I asked the pilot, ‘Toward what lands are the winds blowing? Are the winds blowing toward Ratnadvīpa,176 or are the winds blowing toward Yavanadvīpa,177 or are the winds blowing toward the island of the rākṣasīs?’178 “The pilot answered, ‘Know this, lord: the breeze is blowing toward Siṃhala Is-land.’179 “Then we set sail in the great ship in the direction of Siṃhala Island, but the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island sent untimely winds that broke the great ship into pieces. We180 fell into the water and swam to the shore. “Then five hundred rākṣasīs took on the form of maidens, and with a great cry came down to the shore. They gave us cotton robes. We put them on, wrung our clothes dry, [F.223.a] and went to sit under a large magnolia tree. Seated, we talked among ourselves, asking each other what we should do, but we agreed that there was nothing we could do, and we became silent. “Then the rākṣasīs came to us and said, ‘You who are not masters of a house, be-come masters. You who have no refuge, obtain a refuge. You who have no home, obtain a home. These will be your homes supplied with food. These will be your homes supplied with drink. These will be your gardens for you to enjoy. These will be your bathing pools for you to enjoy.’ “After the rākṣasīs said that, each one took a merchant home to be the master of her house. The senior rākṣasī181 took me home to be the master of her house. She sat-isfied me with food that had perfect, divine flavors. Having satisfied me with food, she frolicked with me, and in this way I was perfectly satisfied with human pleas-ures. Two or three weeks182 passed in that manner. Then one night as I was lying in bed, I was astonished to see that the lamp was laughing. I had never seen or heard before of a burning, laughing lamp.183 I asked it, ‘Why are you laughing?’ “It answered, ‘This is one of the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island. She is going to kill you.’ “Then I asked it, ‘How do you know she is a rākṣasī?’ “It answered, ‘If you don’t believe me, take the road south184 and follow it. You will come to a high fortress185 without windows or doorways. Many hundreds of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 47 merchants have been thrown in there. Some are alive. Some are dead. If you don’t believe me, follow that road. Follow that road and observe. Then you will believe me.’ “Then I186 made the rākṣasī enter the sleep named Ignorance’s Net, and I went out at night, armed with a sword187 that glowed like moonlight. [F.223.b] I took the road that led south, and followed it until I eventually came to an iron fortress. I walked around it, but couldn’t find a door. However, there was a magnolia tree beside the iron fortress, and so I188 climbed up it. I made the sound of spitting, and the mer-chants inside who heard me189 said, ‘Great head merchant, know this! We have been thrown into this iron fortress. Each day a hundred men are taken and eaten. When they’ve been eaten, their bones are scattered around the iron fortress.’ “That is how they described what had happened to them. I climbed down the mag-nolia tree and went quickly back up the southern road. “When I returned to the house, the lamp asked me, ‘Head merchant, did you see?’ “I answered, ‘I saw,’ and then asked it, ‘What can I do?’ “The lamp said, ‘Lord, I have a way by which you can comfortably and happily leave Siṃhala Island and see Jambudvīpa once more.’ “It said, ‘There is a divine king of horses named Bālāha who has compassion for the desolate and destitute. Bālāha, the king of horses, eats the herb named sar-vaśetāna,190 rolls back and forth on the golden sand, shakes his body, and then asks, “Who is going to cross over to the far shore?” You should then say, “Lord, I am go-ing to cross over to the far shore.”’ “After the lamp told me this, I went to lie down next to the rākṣasī. She awoke and asked me, ‘Noble son, why is your body cold?’ “I answered, ‘I went outside the town to defecate and urinate. [F.224.a] That’s why my body has become cold.’ And so she went back to sleep. “At sunrise I got up and said to all the merchants, ‘Come with me. We are going outside the town.’ “Then we all left the town. When we were outside the town and had sat down,191 I asked them, ‘How affectionate are your wives toward you?’ “Some said, ‘She is very loving toward me.’ “Some said, ‘She takes care of me with food that has perfect, divine flavors.’ “Some said, ‘She provides me with all kinds of clothes.’ “Some said, ‘She gives me diadems, earrings, and necklaces.’ “Some said, ‘I don’t have to do any physical work.’ “Some said, ‘She cares for me with sandalwood, musk, and camphor.’ “After the merchants told me these things, I said to them, ‘It’s not right for us to be attached to rākṣasīs in this way.’ “When they heard me say this, they were disturbed and asked, ‘Great head mer-chant, is it true that they are the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island?’ “I answered, ‘It’s true, it’s true. By the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, they are not humans. They are rākṣasīs.’ “The merchants then asked me, ‘What can we do? Do you have a plan for us?’ “I said to them, ‘On Siṃhala Island there is Bālāha, the king of horses, who has compassion for the desolate and destitute.

Each person should prepare provisions for the journey.’ [F.224.b] “They promised they would and returned to town, each to their own home. “The rākṣasī asked me,193 ‘Are you tired? Are you weary? Have you seen the de-lightful gardens and the delightful bathing pools?’194 “I answered, ‘I haven’t seen any.’ “The rākṣasī then said, ‘Noble son, in this Siṃhala Island there are pleasing gar-dens of all kinds that are completely filled with flowers, and there are many hundreds of bathing pools.’ “I said, ‘I will go to those gardens and the various flower-filled pools in three days’ time. I will gather beautiful flowers there and then return. Therefore you should prepare good traveling provisions for me.’ “She said, ‘Noble son, I will do so.’ “I contemplated my predicament, thinking, ‘These rākṣasīs will kill us if they find out.’ I remained silent, contemplating this predicament. The rākṣasī served me good food, and as I ate it, I sighed. “The rākṣasī asked me, ‘Noble son, why did you sigh?’ “I said to her, ‘The people of Jambudvīpa and my homeland are so pleasant.’ “The rākṣasī said, ‘Noble son, what would you do in your homeland? In this Siṃhala Island you have a home with food, a home with drink, a home with clothes, a variety of delightful gardens, and a variety of delightful bathing pools.195 Enjoy these divine pleasures. Why be sorrowful in Jambudvīpa?’ I said nothing in reply. “That day passed, and on the second day, my provisions of good food were quick-ly prepared. Everyone had made his preparations, and at dawn on the third day we all left the city, coming out through its gate. When we were outside, we agreed that not one of us would turn to look back at Siṃhala Island. After we had made that agree-ment, we hurried as quickly as we could, and eventually reached the location of Bālāha, the king of horses. [F.225.a] “Bālāha, the king of horses, was enjoying the sarvaśetāna herb. When he had fin-ished enjoying it, he rolled back and forth on the golden sand and shook his body. When he shook his body, the island of Siṃhala shook. “He asked three times, ‘Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore? Who is going to cross over to the far shore?’196 “The merchants said, ‘We are going to cross over to the far shore.’ “Bālāha, the king of horses, said to us, ‘None of you must look back at Siṃhala Is-land. None of you must turn your eyes toward Siṃhala Island.’ “We agreed to do as he said. Then first I alone mounted him, and then the five hundred merchants mounted him. When we were all mounted, the rākṣasīs who lived on Siṃhala Island came running after us, making a great clamor, weeping and wail-ing pitifully. Hearing the noise, the merchants turned round and looked back at them, and when they did so they fell headlong into the water. When they had fallen into the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 49 water, the rākṣasīs pulled them out and ate them. “I arrived in Jambudvīpa alone. When we reached the shore, I circumambulated Bālāha, the king of horses, three times, bowed to him, and departed. I journeyed to-ward my home and eventually arrived there. My father and mother embraced me and wept, and their tears dissolved their cataracts so they regained their sight. “Then I sat with my parents and told them everything that had happened. My par-ents said, ‘Son, we have got you back alive. We do not need wealth. We only need a walking stick for when we are old; someone to guide us on the path when we are blind; someone to make food offerings to us when we have died; and someone to be our protector when we are dead. Son, you have brought us delight like a cooling breeze.’ That is what my parents said to me. “Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, those are the sufferings I experienced when I was a head merchant. [F.225.b] Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, it was like this: Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara was Bālāha, the king of horses, and he rescued me from the fear of death. “Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, it is like this: I cannot calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsatt-va Avalokiteśvara’s accumulation of merit, but I can say just a little about his pores. “Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, it is like this: A trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore named Suvarṇa. They do not experience the sufferings of saṃsāra and are satisfied by perfect happiness. They perceive divine objects but are free from attachment. They have no aversion, they do not become angry, and they never have malice. They all dwell on the noble eightfold path and always aspire to the Dharma. Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, it is like this: In this pore named Suvarṇa there is a wish-fulfilling jewel named Avabhāsa. Whenever the gandharvas wish for something, their wishes are fulfilled.” “Beyond the pore named Suvarṇa, there is a pore named Kṛṣṇa, within which a tril-lion rishis dwell. Some have one clairvoyance; some have two clairvoyances; some have three clairvoyances; some have four clairvoyances; some have five clairvoy-ances; and some have the six clairvoyances. “Within that pore the ground is silver and the mountains are gold with silver peaks adorned by rubies.197 There are seventy-seven such mountains, and on each of those mountains live eighty thousand rishis. Those rishis have leaf huts198 where there are wish-fulfilling trees with red trunks and gold and silver leaves that shine like jewels. [F.226.a] There are four pools near each wish-fulfilling tree. Some are filled with water that has the eight qualities, and some are completely filled with divine flowers.

When they play music, deer, birds, and so on contemplate deeply. They see the suffering and happiness of beings in saṃsāra199 and the way in which suffering is experienced in Jambudvīpa.

Whenever they wish for something, their wishes are fulfilled.” Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, I am utterly astonished.” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, why are you astonished?” Bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, if those kinds of things appear just because someone thinks of the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, [F.226.b] then those who listen to, cause to be written out,201 possess, recite, study, and have their minds com-pletely focused on the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Bas-ket’s Display, will have happiness. “Those who write a single letter from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sūtra of the Basket’s Display, will have happiness and will not see these suffer-ings of saṃsāra. They will not be reborn as an untouchable202 or of mixed caste;203 they will not be reborn as someone with defective senses; they will not be reborn as lame, hunchbacked, with a deformed nose, a goiter, or a cleft lip, nor with leprosy.204 Their bodies will not be afflicted by illness. They will have health, great strength, and clear faculties.” The Bhagavat gave his approval, saying, “That is excellent, Sar-vanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin. Your eloquence and your teaching of this kind of Dharma to a gathering of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahora-gas, humans, nonhumans, upāsakas, and upāsikās is excellent!

That you repeated-ly make these requests is excellent, excellent. “Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, it is like this: Beyond the Kṛṣṇa pore there is a pore named Ratnakuṇḍala. Many trillions of female gandharvas live within it. Those fe-male gandharvas have excellent figures; are beautiful and attractive; have magnifi-cent, fair complexions; their bodies are adorned with divine jewelry; and they rival the apsaras.

Their bodies do not experience the sufferings that humans do. Those gandharva maidens remember the name of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ava-lokiteśvara. Whenever in the three periods they remember it, all valuable things ap-pear for them.” Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, I will go to those pores because I want to see them.” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, those pores cannot be perceived, just as the ele-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 51 ment of space cannot be perceived.

Having entered that path, they have gone to the realm of Sukhāvatī where they hear the Dharma from Tathāgata Amitābha.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, how can I see Bo-dhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara?” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, you will see him if he comes here, to the Sahā universe, to look at me, bow down to me, and honor me.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “I request it, Bhagavat, that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara come.” The Bhagavat answered, “Noble son, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first comes when a being is ripened.” Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin rested his cheek on his hand216 and said, “What point is there in my having a long life that is devoted to bad actions, deprived of the sight of Avalokiteśvara, blind, and following a path of dark-ness?”217 Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, when is Bodhi-sattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara coming?” The Bhagavat laughed and said, “Noble son, it is not yet time for Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara to come.

Oh, the suf-fering! Separation from the desired and beloved and encountering the undesired and the disliked is extremely unendurable suffering! There are those who are born in Kālasūtra, born in Raurava, born in the great hell of Hāhava, born in Agnighaṭa, born in Vajraśaila,224 and born in the city of the pretas.225 Those beings have the greatest suffering.’ “The kiṃnaras contemplate in that way, and following that contemplation they contemplate the essence of nirvāṇa. “Noble son, the kiṃnaras who rejoice in the Dharma in that way continually re-member the name of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. Remembering his name, they receive all kinds of things. “Thus, noble son, it is difficult to find Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, [F.229.b] who is the father and mother of all beings, who brings freedom from fear to all beings, who reveals the path to all beings, who is a kalyāṇamitra for all beings. Noble son, this is what Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara is like. “Noble son, it is difficult to obtain his name. Those who remember the name that is the six-syllable vidyāmantra will be reborn in those pores. They will no longer continue to be in saṃsāra. They will go from one pore to another, living within those pores until they reach the level of nirvāṇa.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, where can the six-syllable mahāvidyā be obtained?” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, even the tathāgatas do not know the six-syllable mahāvidyā, let alone the bodhisattvas.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, do the tathāgatas, arhats, and samyaksaṃbuddhas not know it?” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, the six-syllable mahāvidyā is the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. Those who know that supreme essence know liberation.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin asked the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, are there any be-ings who know the six-syllable vidyāmantra?” The Bhagavat said, “Noble son, no one knows the six-syllable mahāvidyā.

[F.230.a] “Noble son, all the tathāgatas have spent sixteen eons wandering in search of this six-syllable mahāvidyā, so therefore how could bodhisattvas know it? It is the su-preme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. “If someone traveled throughout this realm of beings, there would be found a few226 who know the six-syllable mahāvidyā. Those beings who continually possess the six-syllable mahāvidyā and are dedicated to repeating it are meritorious. When they repeat it, bhagavats and buddhas to the number of sand grains in ninety-nine Ganges Rivers gather around them, bodhisattvas to the number of atoms gather around them, and they reach the entranceway to the six perfections. “The devas of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise also gather there. The four mahārājas guard the four directions. Many millions of trillions of nāgas such as Nāga King Sāgara, Nāga King Anavatapta, Nāga King Takṣaka, and Nāga King Vāsuki227 guard the ground.228 Also, the yakṣas from above the earth guard the open space above them. “Ten million tathāgatas reside in each pore of that noble son. Residing there they give their approval, saying “Excellent, excellent, noble son! You have acquired such a wish-fulfilling jewel as this. Seven generations of your descendants will attain lib-eration.229 Noble son, even all the beings who live in your stomach will become irre-versible bodhisattvas. “Noble son, those who wear this six-syllable mahāvidyā on their body or on their throat230 will be known to have a body that is a vajra body, will be known to be a stūpa containing relics, and will be known to be the wisdom of ten million tathāgatas. [F.230.b] “A noble son or noble daughter who repeats the six-syllable mahāvidyā will have indestructible mental brilliance. He or she will become a pure mass of wisdom. That person will have great love and great compassion. That person will complete the six perfections each day. That person will receive the consecration of a vidyādhara cakravartin. “Those who inhale that person’s breath, whether in love or in anger, will become irreversible bodhisattvas. They will quickly attain the highest complete enlighten-ment and be samyaksaṃbuddhas. “All those who just touch that person with their clothing231 will become bodhisatt-vas in their last existence. “Women, men, boys, and girls who just see that person, and even the deer, birds, oxen, donkeys, and so on, who see that person, will all become bodhisattvas in their last existence. They will not experience the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, death, and separation from the beloved. They will become inconceivable yogins.” In that way the Bhagavat encouraged the repetition of the six-syllable mahāvidyā. Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, I wish to hear the six-syllable mahāvidyā, which is the inconceivable yoga and the immeasurable and highest dhyāna; which shows the way to the nirvāṇa of supreme enlightenment; which is the entranceway into liberation; which pacifies desire and hatred;232 which"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 55 fills the treasury of the Dharma;233 which uproots saṃsāra and the five existences; which brings the hells and afflictions to an end; which takes those who have become animals to a higher existence; [F.231.a] which completes the taste of the Dharma; and which is the imperishable234 teaching of omniscience. “Bhagavat, how can I obtain it? I would offer the four continents filled with the seven precious materials to anyone who bestows upon me the six-syllable mahāvidyā. “Bhagavat, if I can’t find a birch bark page to write it on, nor ink, nor a reed pen, I will make ink from my blood, I will slice off my skin to make a page, and I will break one of my bones to make a pen. Bhagavat, I have no concern for my body. The one who bestows it upon me will be my parents, my guru of gurus.” Then the Bhagavat said to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, “Noble son, I remember going to as many worlds as there are atoms in the world for the sake of obtaining this six-syllable mahāvidyā. I honored many millions of trillions of tathāgatas, but I did not obtain it, and I did not hear it from those tathāgatas. “At that time I went, weeping, to the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, the one with wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the unsur-passable guide who tames beings, the teacher of gods and humans, the buddha, the bhagavat Ratnottama. “The tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Ratnottama said, ‘Noble son, don’t weep so pitifully. Noble son, go to the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbud-dha Padmottama.235 He knows this six-syllable mahāvidyā.’ “Noble son, I went to Tathāgata Padmottama. I approached the realm of Tathāgata Padmottama, arrived there [F.231.b], and bowed my head to the feet of Tathāgata Padmottama. I placed my palms together before him and said, ‘Bhagavat Pad-mottama, I must obtain this six-syllable mahāvidyā, which purifies all bad karma merely by the remembrance of its name. I seek to obtain that which is difficult for a bodhisattva to obtain. For that purpose I have been to many worlds, in distress. I have arrived here, exhausted and without any result.’ “Then Tathāgata Padmottama praised the qualities of this six-syllable mahāvidyā: ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can know the number of atoms, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count the grains of sand in the ocean, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, a person builds a building that is a hundred yojanas high and five hundred yojanas wide, and completely fills it with sesame seeds.

If every hundred eons that man takes out one sesame seed, I can calculate236 the time when such a building would be emptied down to the floor, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, if the people in the four continents were all"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY to work at various kinds of agriculture, such as barley, wheat, rice, green or black mung beans, and so on; and jujubes, horse gram, and so on; and the nāga kings sent rain at the appropriate times; and those grains grew, ripened, and were harvested; if Jambudvīpa were made into one threshing floor, and the grain was brought in carts, in animal loads, in bundles and baskets, and put on that threshing floor, trodden by oxen and donkeys, and made into one big heap; [F.232.a] then, noble son, I could count every single grain, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, in Jambudvīpa there are great rivers that flow day and night.

Day and night they flow into the ocean. Noble son, this is how the accumulation of merit in-creases as the result of a single repetition of the six-syllable mahāvidyā: I can count each drop in those great rivers, but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit that comes from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, I can count each hair on all four-legged be-ings such as herds of oxen, donkeys, buffaloes, horses, and elephants; dogs, jack-als,247 goats, and similarly lions, tigers, wolves, deer, monkeys, hares, pigs, and so on; and rats and cats, and so on; but, noble son, I cannot calculate the accumulation of merit from repeating the six-syllable mahāvidyā once. ‘Noble son, it is like this: For example, the king of mountains, named Vajrāṅkuśa, is 99,000 yojanas high and extends downward into the sea for 84,000 yojanas. Va-jrāṅkuśa, the king of mountains, is 84,000 yojanas wide on each side.

This is a subtle Dharma, an imperceptible Dharma, an unknown Dharma; it is the attainment of the ultimate essence. It has been established through the qualities of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara’s skillfulness in methods. In that way, no-ble son, [F.233.a] I too obtained skillfulness in methods through the six-syllable mahāvidyā. ‘Noble son, I also wandered through many hundreds of thousands of millions of tens of millions of worlds, and then in front of Tathāgata Amitābha, with palms placed together, I wept because of my emotion for the Dharma. ‘At that time, Tathāgata Amitābha, who knew the present and the future, said, “Noble son who is united with the yoga of meditation, do you desire the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās?” ‘I replied, “I do desire it, Bhagavat;254 I do desire it, Sugata. I have gone to many worlds in search of the six-syllable mahāvidyā, Bhagavat, just like a thirsty person seeks water.

They will also quickly attain the highest complete enlightenment, which is complete buddhahood. “The ācārya should not give it to those who are inappropriate. It should be be-stowed upon those who aspire for it with faith, or bestowed upon those who aspire for it with faith in the Mahāyāna. It should not be given to tīrthikas.” ‘Then the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Amitābha said to Bodhisatt-va Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, “Noble son, what if the noble son or noble daughter is poor and cannot use precious sapphire jewel powder, emerald powder, or gold or sil-ver powder?” “Bhagavat, he should use powder dyed with various colors and use various flowers and various incenses.” “Noble son, what if, because he has gone to another land and lacks the facilities, he cannot even obtain those?” “Then the ācārya should imagine the maṇḍala in his mind, and the ācārya should teach the nature of the mantras262 and gestures.”’ “Then the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama263 said to Bo-dhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara, ‘Noble son, give the six-syllable mahāvidyā queen to me. I will liberate many millions of trillions of beings from saṃsāra so that they will quickly attain complete buddhahood with the highest complete enlighten-ment.’ “Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gave the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās264 to the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama: Oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ.” [F.234.b] [B.4] “When Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara gave the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama, every-where from the four continents to the deva realms shook like plantain leaves.

Bhagavat, just like those who are not satisfied by just a taste of amṛta, Bhagavat, I am not satisfied by simply hearing about the six-syllable mahāvidyā.

Noble son, that is what the six-syllable mahāvidyā queen is like. Those who recite that name are rare. Possessing its name just once will make them equal to someone who has provided all the tathāgatas with all requisites: with robes, food, bowls, bedding, seats,294 necessary medicine, and utensils.” Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin then said to the dharmabhāṇaka, “Give me the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās.” The dharmabhāṇaka295 thought and thought about this. Then a voice came from the sky saying, “Give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās!” The dharmabhāṇaka wondered where this voice had come from. Again there came the voice from the sky, saying, “This bodhisattva has undergone many hardships. Give him the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās!” The dharmabhāṇaka looked up into the sky and saw someone who had a body white as the autumn moon, a crown of coiled hair, an omniscient buddha296 upon his head, and a beautiful lotus in his hand, and was adorned with the splendor of lotuses. Then the dharmabhāṇaka said to Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin, [F.238.b] “Noble son, the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara has given permission for the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās to be given to you.” Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin reverently placed his palms together to receive it. Oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ. As soon as this was given, the earth shook in six ways. Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin obtained these samādhis: the samādhi named Unceasing True Nature, the samādhi named Love, Compassion, and Rejoicing, the samādhi named Practicing Yoga, the samādhi named Established in the Entry to Liberation, the samādhi named Illuminating Everywhere, the samādhi named The King of Ar-rays, and the samādhi named Holding the Dharma. Those are the samādhis he at-tained. As soon as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin had obtained the six-syllable queen of mahāvidyās, he offered the four continents, completely filled with the seven jewels, as payment to that upādhyāya. The dharmabhāṇaka said, “There is no payment required for even one of the sylla-bles, let alone the six syllables of the mahāvidyā, nor will I take anything from you, noble son. You are a bodhisattva, a noble being, with no one higher, and you are my pupil, noble son.” The dharmabhāṇaka presented him with a string of pearls to the value of a hundred thousand silver coins and said, “Noble son, in accord with my in-struction, present this to the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni.”"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 63 Then Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin bowed his head to the feet of the dharmabhāṇaka and departed, having obtained what he sought and with his wishes fulfilled.

[F.239.a] Then the bhagavat, the tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha Śākyamuni asked, “Noble son, did you find what you sought?” “Bhagavat, it happened, as the Bhagavat knows.” Seventy-seven times ten million297 samyaksaṃbuddhas gathered there, and those tathāgatas recited this dhāraṇī: Namaḥ saptanām saṃyaksaṃbuddhakoṭinām tadyathā oṃ cale cule cunde298 svāhā299 (The homage by seven times ten million samyaksaṃbuddhas is like this: Oṃ cale cule cunde svāhā.)

They are decorated with braided lengths of strings of pearls and silk, and they are hung with hundreds of strings of pearls. “Within each of the many-storied palaces there is a precious wish-granting jewel named Śārada,301 that provides each bodhisattva with everything he needs. “When those bodhisattvas have entered their many-storied palaces, they remember the six-syllable mahāvidyā. When they remember it, they realize nirvāṇa. They see the seven tathāgatas that are at the level of nirvāṇa. They also see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara. [F.239.b] When they see him, faith arises in their minds. After that has occurred, the bodhisattvas leave the many-storied palaces. Then some go to their walkways; some go to the gardens of precious wish-granting jewels; some go to the bathing pools; and some go to the sides of the mountains, which are made of precious ruby jewels. “When they arrive there, they sit cross-legged, sitting up straight, and establish themselves in focused mindfulness.

They contemplate sadness concerning the body, thinking, ‘Alas, there is suffering: the suffering of birth, aging, sickness, and death; the suffering of being separated from the beloved and pleasant; the suffering of encountering the dis-liked and unpleasant; the suffering of being born in Avīci; the suffering of being born in Kālasūtra; and the suffering of being born in the city of the pretas.’ At that time they are sitting cross-legged, their bodies straight, establishing themselves in focused mindfulness, dwelling in the mountains. “Noble son, beyond that there is the pore named Cittarāja,306 in which live many millions of trillions of pratyekabuddhas.

When they die and leave the hells, they will be reborn in Jambudvīpa as poor people, blind from birth. Therefore, Ānanda, protect the property of the Saṅgha. “Bhikṣus, those who have the vows of training should have the three Dharma robes. One Dharma robe is worn by the Saṅgha so that there will be confidence in the Saṅgha. The second robe is for when one goes to the king’s palace. [F.247.b] The third robe is for when one goes to the villages, towns, marketplaces, and hamlets. So the bhikṣus must have the three robes.” “Those bhikṣus who have good conduct, who have good qualities, and who have wisdom368 should remember my words of instruction. “Bhikṣus, the exclusive property of the Saṅgha, such as the embers of the Saṅgha’s fire, the smoke of the Saṅgha, the vajras of the Saṅgha, or the baggage of the Saṅgha, should not be used. There are remedies for poison, but there are no remedies for us-ing the property of the Saṅgha.”369 Then Brother Ānanda said to the Bhagavat, “Bhagavat, every bhikṣu will remem-ber these words of instruction given by the Bhagavat and will keep the pratimokṣa vows, will follow the Vinaya, and will preserve the Bhagavat’s words of instruction.” Then Brother Ānanda bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet and departed. Then the mahāśrāvakas departed to their own buddha realms. The devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans also departed.

The greater tiger claw tree is presumably Erythrina variegata, which grows much taller. 70 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “Mahāsattva.” 71 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “It was he who emanated these light rays.” 72 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has this passage as a description of the events instead of the thoughts of Yama’s guards: “At that time Yama’s creatures were dismayed as they saw bad omens appear in the Avīci hell, for when the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara arrived there, lotus flowers the size of cartwheels...” 73 According to the Sanskrit.

Tibetan omits “...with an extremely loving mind, and resembling a golden statue.” 78 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan interpreted mahārāvaṇa incorrectly as “the elephant of the gods,” a name for Indra’s elephant. 79 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates pṛthivīvaralocanakarāya as “the eyes of the world.” 80 According to Cambridge and Tibetan.

Tibetan omits “who has profound wisdom.” 86 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “Then they contemplated the human existence.” 87 The Tibetan ’jig tshogs means “an aggregation that is destroyed.” The Sanskrit satkāya means “existent accumulation,” a secondary meaning of kāya, which is usually translated as sku, meaning “body.” The mountain is singular in the Sanskrit and has twenty peaks, which are the views of the relationship of the self to each of the five skandhas or aggregates—i.e., the self is form, form possesses self, self possesses form, and self is located within form—and the same for the other four aggregates (sensations, identifications, mental activities, and consciousnesses), which comes to twenty views. 88 According to the Sanskrit.

Tibetan has “statues.” 101 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has ngal bso po, the translation of viśrama (“tranquility”). 102 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “He says to the listening asuras.” 103 The dialogue between the Buddha and Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkhambin is absent in both the Tibetan and Cambridge. It has been added here from Sāmaśrami as the narrative is more confusing without it. 104 In Indian literature such as the Pūraṇas, those beings that do not produce descendants are reborn in a realm where the inhabitants continually hang upside down. The seven underworlds, called patala, include realms made of gold. The implication here is that Avalokiteśvara is traveling through the underworlds, one of which is ruled by Bali, which this sūtra describes as being made of iron. The hells and the preta realm are also located below the ground. 105 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has the peculiar “Show us the path of liberation that creates sensation.” 106 The Sanskrit editions added an extra sentence here: “As he approached, King Bali saw him in the distance, resembling a disc of gold emitting light rays of various colors.” This would easily have been omitted when copying a manuscript, since the next sentence begins in a similar way. 107 One example of these names being used separately for two attendants, as opposed to the compound name Kubjavāmanaka for one asura, is found in verses 31–32 and 35–36 in chapter 69 of the Bṛhatsaṃhita by Varāhamihira (505–587 CE), where Kubja and Vāmanaka are listed as separate attendants of kings. See Varāhamihira (1869, 287). 108 This is a poetic metaphor for a face covered or darkened by tears as clouds darken the land. 109 List of jewelry is given according to the Tibetan. 110 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “I became astonished on having become...” 111 According to the Sanskrit.

The English translation of the Chinese translation has Nārāyaṇa transforming into these different beings. 114 According to the Sanskrit the five named kṣatriyas are the five Pāṇḍava brothers, and the Kaurava brothers were their enemies. This is the principal theme of the Mahābhārata epic. 115 This passage is awkward in the original text, as from this point on, descriptions of Bali shift from first-person voice to third-person voice. In this translation we have maintained the first-person voice throughout, as noted in the introduction. 116 According to the Sanskrit.

Tibetan omits “mantras.” 263 In the original text the narrative suddenly changes here from Padmottama’s first-person narration to Śākyamuni’s narration. 264 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “queen of.” 265 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has the vighnas and vināyakas being frightened and the others fleeing. 266 According to Cambridge and Sāmaśrami. Tibetan has only Padma. Vaidya, though it had Padmottama earlier, has Patrottama at this point. 267 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “statues.” 268 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan and Cambridge have this further on in the list, before “the samādhi of Seeing All the Tathāgatas.” 269 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “Possessing the Six Perfections.” 270 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “recites, and is completely focused on.” 271 According to Cambridge (jaṃgamayuṣyatitha, corruption of jagadāyuṣyatitha). Omitted in Vaidya. Tibetan has “should be seen as the shore of the merit of beings.” 272 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “merit,” which was conjoined with the preceding phrase. 273 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “should be seen as being like the Ganges and all sacred places.” 274 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits. 275 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “Dharma treasury.” 276 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “his conduct is not controlled.” 277 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “cloth from China.” Sāmaśrami and Vaidya follow this with dhyuṣitāni, which is not included in Cambridge or Tibetan. 278 See note 69. 279 According to Sanskrit vārṣika. Tibetan has vāraṣikā. The name means “a monsoon flower.” It is described as white and fragrant. Though the Sanskrit dictionary gives Arabian jasmine (Jasminum sambac), the description matches gardenia (Gardenia gummifera). 280 According to the Tibetan compound kunda (Jasminum multiflorum) and dhyuṣita (white). Sanskrit has śakunakādhyuṣita. Cambridge has śakuntādhyuṣita. 281 According to the Sanskrit, vimalika; Tibetan has vimānaka. 282 Transliterated into Tibetan as vyaśārika. Vaidya has śālika, but Cambridge has śārikā. The myna is a vocalizer that has always been a popular house pet in India, the Gracula religiosa or the Turdus salica. 283 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “his conduct was not controlled.” 284 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “I lack the highest complete enlightenment, so...” 285 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “Give me the completely pure state of great stability.” 286 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “unequalled.” 287 Literally “Indra garments.” This obscure term is found only in this sūtra. It appears in the Sanskrit to be a kind of compound called madhyamapadalopī, “omission of the middle word.” As this appears to be in a list referring to colors of cloth, the first part of the compound is presumably short for indradhanu, indrayudha, or indrakārmuka, all meaning “rainbow.” 288 According to the Sanskrit. The obscure word dhyuṣita is found only in this sūtra. It is also used to describe star jasmine earlier in the sūtra, which has been interpreted as “bright white.” It has also been interpreted as a variant of a word meaning “dwell,” and therefore the Tibetan translates it as “dwelling” (literally “based”) garments. Edgerton sees it as related to duṣya, which he interprets as meaning “very fine” when applied to cloth. 289 According to the Tibetan. Sanskrit has just divasa (“day”), which is presumably short for divasakara (“daymaker”), a common term for the sun."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 290 Sāmaśrami has nagnaśravaṇeṣu and Vaidya has nagnaśramaneṣu, which are here synonymous. This could refer to Jains—monks of the Digambara sect are always naked—but nakedness was also a common feature among Śaivite and Vaiśnavite ascetics. Cambridge has nagnaśávareṣu (“naked savages”), referring to the tribal people living in the mountains of present day Orissa. The Tibetan is based on a similar version, but with the compound divided into two, “naked ones and mountain men” (gcer bu pa dang ri mi). 291 This is the traditional division of the twelve kinds of teachings given by the Buddha. The sūtras, literally “threads,” does not mean entire texts as in the general meaning of sūtra but the prose passages within texts; the geyas are the verse versions of preceding prose passages; the vyākaraṇas are prophecies; the gāthās are stand-alone verses; the udānas are teachings not given in response to a request; the nidānas are the introductory sections; the avadānas are accounts of the previous lives of individuals who were alive at the time of the Buddha; the itivṛttakas are biographies of buddhas and bodhisattvas in the past; the jātakas are the Buddha’s accounts of his own previous lifetimes; the vaipulyas are teachings that expand upon a certain subject; the adbhūtadharmas are descriptions of miracles; and the upadeśas are explanations of terms and categories. 292 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “What is the essence?” 293 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “with their hands.” 294 See note 98. 295 According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has mkhan po for dharma upādhyāya, or “preceptor.” 296 This is referring to Amitābha. 297 The mantra itself has seven times ten million buddhas. The compiler must have been aware of the apparent contradiction and is presumably stating that in this sūtra a greater number of buddhas are reciting this mantra than did so in the Cundī sūtra. See also note 305. 298 According to Tibetan and Cambridge. Vaidya and Sāmaśrami have cunye. 299 This is the mantra of the Goddess Cundi in the form written in The Dhāranī Named Goddess Cunde (folio 46b7). However, it is oṃ cale cule cundi svāhā, the form that is popular in Chinese Buddhism, in the same text as repeated in the Dhāraṇī section of the Kangyur (The Dhāranī Named Goddess Cunde, folio 143a5). Cale cule cunde are the vocative forms of Calā, Culā, and Cundā, three variations of her name. Cundi is the vocative for Cundī. The words seventy million buddhas are a reference to her being the mother of seventy million buddhas as described in her sūtra, which was not translated into Tibetan, but was translated into Chinese (The Dhāraṇī of Cundī). This sūtra was evidently popular in India at the time of the creation of the Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra, at least in its present form. 300 Here the narrative abruptly changes to continue on directly from the description of the previous pore (Vajramukha). No attempt has been made to smooth this fracture of the original. 301 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan did not translate but transliterated it as śaridaka. 302 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “many hundreds of thousands.” 303 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “and jewels.” 304 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “many.” 305 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “ninety thousand.” 306 According to the Sanskrit, cittarāja. The Tibetan had sna tshogs kyi rgyal po (“King of Variety”), translating citrarāja. The Chinese has “Painting King,” which was also translating citrarāja. 307 Not the same as the identically named “seven jewels of the cakravartin.” The seven jewels were associated with the seven heavenly bodies: ruby, moonstone or pearl, coral, emerald, yellow sapphire, diamond, and blue sapphire. 308 According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. Cambridge has “the trunks are red, and the leaves are red-gold.” Tibetan has “the trunks are red pearl, and the leaves are gold and silver.” For consistency in the description of the trees, the Vaidya and Sāmaśrami versions have been followed. 309 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has the verb “hung” used for both the jewels and the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 83 adornments. 310 According to Cambridge (Dvhajārāja) and Tibetan (rgyal mtshan gyi rgyal po). Vaidya and Sāmaśrami have Dhvajāgra. 311 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “ninety-nine thousand multistoried palaces.” 312 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “divine.” 313 According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit omits “and jewels.” 314 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “they face Jambudvīpa and teach the Dharma.” 315 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits mahoragas. 316 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “in a realm within this universe.” 317 The preceding two paragraphs were absent in the Tibetan, and could easily have been omitted in the copying of Sanskrit manuscripts. 318 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “divine magnolia trees appeared and divine lotus pools appeared.” 319 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits. 320 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “who holds a lotus.” 321 “Lord of Ashes,” according to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has only Iśvara (“Lord”). 322 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “who creates the eyes of the world.” 323 According to Cambridge (śubha-padma-hastāya) and Tibetan (pad ma bzang po phyag na mnga’ ba). Omitted in Vaidya and Sāmaśrami. 324 According to the Sanskrit. 325 Himavat (“having snow”) is also an alternative name for the Himalayas. 326 “Noble son” is from the Sanskrit, which makes it clear that this sentence is a continuation of Śākyamuni’s speech. Otherwise it could seem to be the description of a conclusion of a section of the book. The uncommon word nirvyūha, used for the two parts this sūtra is divided into, was translated in the Tibetan version as le’u, which is more commonly used to translate parivarta and normally means a chapter. Neither the Cambridge manuscript nor the Tibetan has a chapter division at this point in the text—unlike later Sanskrit manuscripts, which have here and elsewhere a number of additional divisions into chapters, which they call prakaraṇa. The text from which the Chinese translation was made included neither this Maheśvara episode, nor the preceding description of the oceans coming from Avalokiteśvara’s toe. This strange final sentence of the Maheśvara episode, therefore, in which the Buddha is giving a title and text division to what has occurred, is probably indicative of yet another case of unskilful compilation in this sūtra. 327 The Tibetan has translated this freely as “my path is without obstacles.” 328 These are probably synonymous with Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa in other sūtras, which can refer either to the submarine mountain that contains the hells or the circle of mountains around the edge of the world. 329 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “Mahāmucilinda.” 330 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “Mahāsaṃsṛṣṭa.” 331 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “Pralambodhara.” 332 A pala is approximately .15 or 3/20 of an ounce, or 4.5 grams, and is said to be the equivalent to the weight of 640 grains of rice. The weight of four rice grains is called one guñjā; five guñjās are one paṇa; eight paṇas are one karṣa; and four karṣas are one pala. In practice the actual weight of the pala varied in different regions. The Tibetan has srang, which, though often translated into English as “ounce,” is much less, and is roughly equivalent to the pala. 333 According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has just “ink.” 334 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “write on the endless.” 335 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “Eyes of Lightning.” 336 According to Cambridge (anantavyūha) and Tibetan (bkod pa mtha’ yas pa). Vaidya and Sāmaśrami have andhavyūha."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 THE BASKET’S DISPLAY 337 According to the Sanskrit, Pratibhānakūṭa. Cambridge has Pratibhāsakūṭa, “Mountain of Brilliant Light”; Sāmaśrami has the corrupt Pratihāsakūṭa, “Mountain of Laughter.” The Tibetan has spobs pa’i phung po, agreeing with Vaidya; spobs pa is the standard Tibetan translation of pratibhāna. 338According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “the samādhi named Vajra Wall.” 339 According to the Tibetan and Sāmaśrami. Cambridge has “purification of the senses” (-śodhano instead of -mocano). 340 Tibetan translates locana (“illumination”) as “eyes.” Cambridge has śodhana (“purification”). Vaidya and Sāmaśrami have candra- (instead of indriya) vara-locana (“The Moon’s Sublime Illumination”). 341 “Day-maker” (Sanskrit: divakara, Tibetan: nyin byed) is an epithet for the sun. 342 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “The Sun’s Sublime Eyes.” 343 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “The Complete Eyes of the World.” 344 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “The Sacred Eyes of the Buddha Realms.” 345 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has “Facing the Deeds to Be Done.” 346 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits. 347 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits. 348 According to the Tibetan. Sanskrit omits. 349 According to the Sanskrit.

Vaidya has the corrupt vividhamādhi, and Sāmaśrami has viviṇamādhi. 352 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “Sacred Eyes of the Moon.” 353 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “Sacred Eyes of the Sun.” 354 This paragraph omitted in Tibetan. 355 This paragraph only in Tibetan. 356 According to the Tibetan. Vaidya has bhadrarāja (“excellent king”), Sāmaśrami has rāja (“king”), and Cambridge has Indrarāja (“Indra king”). 357 The Tibetan uses the same word for “open” while the Sanskrit has two different synonyms. 358 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan translates as “the right hand side,” another meaning of the word dakṣiṇa. 359 According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “six buddhas.” 360 Literally “blue,” but in Sanskrit this is a euphemism for “black.” 361 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “gandharvas.” 362 Bhadanta, a relic from the Middle Indic language of the original monastic communities, which in its Sanskritized form would be bhadrānta, “one who has the utter limit of goodness.” It is translated into Tibetan as btsun po, “noble one.” 363 According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan here is particularly obscure: “They should not do the supplication and the fourth.” See also note 364. 364 The announcement that someone wishes to take ordination, followed by three inquiries as to whether any bhikṣu present has an objection, are together called “the four motions.” 365 According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan omits “and they will be reborn as insects in a cesspool of feces and urine in the great city of Vārāṇasī.” 366 “Kodrava” is specifically Paspalum scrobiculatum, which is kodo millet. Tibetan has rgya shug, or “jujubes.” 367 Generally in Indian mythology the Vaitarāṇi River is analogous to the River Styx, as it separates the living from the dead.
