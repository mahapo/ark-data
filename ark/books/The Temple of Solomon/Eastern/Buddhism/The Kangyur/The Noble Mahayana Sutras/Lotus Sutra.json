Thus his teachings were alwaysappropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which theteaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed torelieve the suffering to which it was addressed.Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago,his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. Yetno one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into Englishthroughout the history of Japan. It is my greatest wish to see this done and tomake the translations available to the many English-speaking people who havenever had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings.Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty-four thousand teachings in a few years. I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhistcanon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project.It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criti-cized. Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himselfor herself to initiate this project, it will never be done. At the same time, I hopethat an improved, revised edition will appear in the future.It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhistscholars from the East and the West, this monumental project has finally gottenoff the ground.

Under his leadership, a special preparatorycommittee was organized in April 1982. By July of the same year, the Trans-lation Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened.The initial Committee consisted of the following members: (late)HANAYAMAShōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, ISHIGAMIZennō, (late)KAMATAShigeo, KANAOKAShūyū, MAYEDASengaku, NARA Yasuaki, (late)SAYEKIShinkō, (late) SHIOIRIRyōtatsu, TAMARUNoriyoshi, (late) TAMURAKwansei, URYÁZURyūshin, and YUYAMAAkira. Assistant members of theCommittee were as follows: KANAZAWAAtsushi, WATA NABEShōgo, RolfGiebel of New Zealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium.After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selectedone hundred thirty-nine texts for the First Series of translations, an estimatedone hundred printed volumes in all. The texts selected are not necessarily lim-ited to those originally written in India but also include works written or com-posed in China and Japan. While the publication of the First Series proceeds,the texts for the Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works;this process will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese,have been published.Frankly speaking, it will take perhaps one hundred years or more to accom-plish the English translation of the complete Chinese and Japanese texts, forthey consist of thousands of works. Nevertheless, as Dr. NUMATAwished, it isthe sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue unto comple-tion, even after all its present members have passed away.Dr. NUMATApassed away on May 5, 1994, at the age of ninety-seven,entrusting his son, Mr. NUMATAToshihide, with the continuation and comple-tion of the Translation Project.

Orig-inally from the royal family of Kucha in the present-day autonomous provinceof Xinqiang, China, Kumārajīva is generally believed to have translated theSaddharmapuṇḍarīka-sūtra(Scripture of the White Lotus of the Marvelous Law)into Chinese in 406 C.E.In translating the Chinese text into English we used the Kasuga Edition ofKumārajīva’s version of the Lotus Sutraas the basic text, rather than the TaishōEdition. With very few exceptions the readings in these two editions are almostexactly the same in meaning, and the differences are too slight to have any sig-nificant effect on the translation. We have tried to make our translation as read-able as possible without straying from the original meaning.The last line of the first verse in Chapter XXIII (Taishō Vol. 9, No. 262,53b25), which we have translated as, “I have paid homage to the Bhagavat/Inorder to attain the utmost wisdom,” has no corresponding reading in any extantSanskrit manuscript, nor is it found in the Tibetan canon or the Chinese versiontranslated from the Sanskrit by Dharmarakṣa in 267 C.E.(Taishō Vol. 9, No.263). Furthermore, it is absent in a number of authoritative editions of theBuddhist canon in Chinese.According to the late Professor Shōkō Kabutogi, the foremost specialist invarious editions of Kumārajīva’s version of the Lotus Sutra,the Kasuga Editionis superior to other editions. The most reliable edition, printed in 1263, is nowkept at the Tōshōdaiji in Nara. We are pleased to say that this text was publishedin facsimile under the editorship of Dr. Kabutogi (Tokyo: The Reiyukai, 1979).Furthermore,at the advice of Dr. Kabutogi, the late Professor Yukio Sakamotoincluded this version of the text along with his three-volume Japanese transla-tion in the pocketbook series published by Iwanami Shoten (Tokyo, 1962–67).In many cases, however, we have not necessarily followed the traditional Sino-Japanese interpretation.xiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Translators’ IntroductionIn this connection we have consulted the Sanskrit and, on rare occasions,the Tibetan versions. Of the former, the so-called Central Asian recension, andin particular the Kashgar Manuscript, is of great importance. This manuscriptwas no doubt copied in the ancient oasis town of Khotan, but it is generally calledthe Kashgar Manuscript because the majority of the manuscript was obtainedthere in 1903 by N. F. Petrovsky, the Imperial Russian consul at the time. Themanuscript unfortunately has not been kept intact. It is now scattered in a num-ber of places throughout the world and some folios are missing or damaged.Never theless, the available portions have been almost completely reproduced infacsimile under the editorship of Professor Lokesh Chandra of the InternationalAcademy of Indian Culture in New Delhi (1976; reprinted by The Reiyukai in1977). As the fruit of painstaking work, Professor Hirofumi Toda of TokushimaUniversity published a romanization of this text (Tokushima, 1981).It is interesting to note here that in a number of cases, particularly those ofChinese proper names, either in transliteration or translation, Kumārajīva’s ver-sion agrees with the readings of the Central Asian Sanskrit recension rather thanthat in others, such as those found in Nepal or at the ancient site of Gilgit in thenorthwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and some of those found in Tibet.In such cases we have gladly adopted the version from the Central Asian recen-sion, since some of the readings in Chinese were puzzling.Within the Buddhist canon, the Lotus Sutrais one text that should be readas a whole. We recommend reading the text from the beginning and continu-ing chapter by chapter so that this mag nificent drama can be fully grasped as itunfolds. In this sense, Chapter I can be seen as a dramatic prelude, while thewell-known parables that emerge during the course of the sutra serve to clarifyand enliven the entire narrative.For the reader who wants a quick summary of the Lotus Sutra, we suggestthe preface to Professor Leon Hurvitz’s meticulous work, The Scripture of theLotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma(New York: Columbia University Press, 1976).Those who wish to conduct further research into the Lotus Sutraare advisedto consult an indispensable bibliographical work by Professor Hajime Nakamura,Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes(Hirakata: Kansai Uni-versity of Foreign Studies Publication, 1980), and an earlier work by Akira Yuyama,A Bibliography of the Sanskrit Texts of the Saddhar ma puṇḍarīka sūtra(Canberra:Australian National University Press, 1970). The latter volume includes infor-mation on versions in other languages.xiv"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Translators’ IntroductionAcknowledgementsOur translation work on the first edition of this volume was first launched inthe spring of 1980. Our hope was that the final result would be a text readilyunderstandable to English readers. Since then the work has often been inter-rupted by other commitments. During these years we have been indebted to theassistance of a number of people. Among them, Dr. Gregory Shopen and Dr.Terry Abbott joined the first stage of our project and gave of their time selflessly.In the course of our revisions, Dr. James Hubbard spared no pains in goingthrough the entire English text. We are grateful to him not only for his correc-tion of our English but also for the suggestions stemming from his excellentknowledge of Buddhist Chinese.In the very final stages, we decided to rapidly review the translation byonce again comparing the Chinese with the Sanskrit versions. In this processwe were assisted by Ms. Kiko Thiel and Dr. James Raeside, who helped us withnuances and shades of meaning in their native languages. We must also thankMr. S. Kawabata and Mr. T. Torii, who was, throughout, unsparing in his effortsto guide the project to a conclusion. Last but not least, our heartfelt gratitudegoes to the staff members of the International Institute for Buddhist Studies andthe International Department of the Reiyukai for their untiring assistance.We feel pleased and honored that our translation has been adopted in thisseries, and we believe this must indicate that the philosophy underlying ourtranslation matches the goals of the Society for the Promotion of Buddhism(Bukkyō Dendō Kyōkai) and its English Tripiṭaka Series.xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE LOTUS SUTRA"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter IIntroductionThus have I heard. Once the Buddha was staying in the city of Rājagṛha, onthe mountain called Gṛdhrakūṭa, together with a great assembly of twelvethousand monks, all of whom were arhats whose corruption was at an end,who were free from the confusion of desire, who had achieved their owngoals, shattered the bonds of existence, and attained complete mental disci-pline.

The nun Mahā prajāpatī was there, together withher six thousand attendants; and also the nun Yaśodharā, Rāhula’s mother,together with her attendants.There were also eighty thousand bodhisattva mahā sattvas, all of whomwere irreversible from highest, complete enlightenment (anuttarā samyak-saṃbodhi). They had obtained the dhāraṇīs, were established in eloquence,and had turned the irreversible wheel of the Dharma. Each had paid homageto countless hundreds of thousands of buddhas, planted roots of merit in theirpresence, and had always been praised by those buddhas. They had also cul-tivated compassion within themselves, skillfully caused others to enter thewisdom of a buddha, obtained great wisdom, and reached the other shore. Allof them were famous throughout countless worlds and had saved innumer-able hundreds of thousands of sentient beings.

It was profound in meaning, elegant in speech, and endowed with thecharacter of the pure path of discipline and integrity.“To those seeking for the śrāvakavehicle he taught the Dharma withrespect to the Four Noble Truths, causing them to overcome birth, old age,illness, and death and to attain nirvana. He taught the Dharma with respectto dependent origination to the pratyekabuddhas; and to the bodhisattvas hetaught the Dharma with respect to the six perfections (pāramitās), causingthem to attain highest, complete enlightenment and perfect all-knowledge(sarva jñātā).“Then there was another buddha named Candrasūryapradīpa, and afterhim another buddha also named Candrasūryapradīpa. And so in this waytwenty thousand buddhas all had the same name Candrasūryapradīpa. Theyalso had the same family name Bharadvāja.“O Maitreya!

The first was called Mati, the second Sumati, the third Anantamati, thefourth Ratimati, the fifth was called Viśeṣa mati, the sixth Vimatisamudghātin,the seventh Ghoṣamati, and the eighth was called Dharmamati. These eightprinces were endowed with dignity and power, and each of them ruled overfour great continents. Having heard that their father had renounced house-hold life and obtained highest, complete enlightenment, all of them aban-doned their kingdoms and also renounced household life. Each caused thespirit of the Mahayana to arise within him, practiced the pure path of disci-pline and integrity, and became an expounder of the Dharma. They all plantedroots of good merit under many thousands of myriads of buddhas.“At that time, the Buddha Candrasūryapradīpa taught the Mahayanasutra called Immeasurable Meanings,the instruction for the bodhisattvasand treasured lore of the buddhas.

You should know that at that time there were twenty koṭisof bodhisattvas in the assembly who wanted to hear the Dharma.

Even though hehad repeatedly recited the sutras he never became versed in them and for-got the greater part. That is why he was called Yaśaskāma, ‘Fame Seeker.’But because he had also planted various roots of good merit, he was able tomeet innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhaswhom he rendered homage to, honored, revered, and praised.“O Maitreya!

They merely run about, back and forth, looking attheir father.“Thereupon the affluent man thought:This house is already engulfed in flames. If my children and I do notget out, we shall perish in the fire. I will now use skillful means to helpmy children escape from this disaster.“Since the father already knew that his children were attached to vari-ous rare toys and unusual things that each of them liked, he said to them:The toys you are fond of are rare and hard to obtain. If you do not takethem you will certainly regret it later. Right now, outside the house,there are three kinds of carts. One is yoked to a sheep, one to a deer,and one to an ox. Go play with them. Children! Run out of this burn-ing house immediately and I will give you whatever you want!“The children, hearing what their father had said about the rare toys,became excited and, in their eagerness to get to them they pushed each otherout of the way in a mad rush out of the burning house.“Then the affluent man saw that his children had got out safely and weresitting unharmed in an open area at a crossroad. He was relieved, happy, andjoyful. The children said to their father:Father, please give us the toys you promised: those [three] carts, oneyoked to a sheep, one to a deer, and one to an ox!“O Śāriputra, the affluent man then gave each child the same kind oflarge cart.

Because the man had great and immeasurable wealth and hisabundant storehouses were full. He thus thought further:Since my treasure has no limit, I should not give my children inferiorcarts. These are my children and I love them all equally. I have animmeasurable number of large carts such as these, decorated with theseven treasures. I should equally distribute them to each child withoutdiscrimination. Why is this? Even if I gave carts like these to every-one in the country, their number would not be exhausted. Why shouldI not give them to my own children?“At that time, the children each climbed into a great cart and had anunprecedented experience, one beyond their original expectations.“O Śāriputra! What do you think about this? This affluent man gave tohis children equally a large cart decorated with precious treasures. Has hedeceived them or not?”Śāriputra replied: “No Bhagavat! The affluent man only tried to helphis children escape from the disastrous fire. He saved their lives and did notdeceive them. This is by no means a deception. Why? Because by savingtheir lives they obtained marvelous toys. Moreover, they were saved fromthe burning house by skillful means.“O Bhagavat! If this affluent man had not given them even the smallestcart, it still would not have been a deception. Why is this? Because thisaffluent man thought before:I will help my children escape with skillful means.“This is why it was not a deception.

Although that affluent man had physical strength he didnot use it. He only earnestly employed skillful means to save his childrenfrom the disaster of the burning house, and later he gave each of them a largecart decorated with precious treasures. The Tathāgata is exactly like this.“Although the Tathāgata has power and fearlessness he does not usethem, but rescues sentient beings from the burning house of the triple worldonly through wisdom and skillful means, teaching the three vehicles to theśrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and the buddhas, saying:Do not take pleasure in living in this burning house of the triple world.And do not thirst after inferior objects, sounds, smells, flavors, andtangibles. If you are attached to these objects and have desires, thenyou will be burned.

At that time the impoverished son, who had been wan-dering about, taking odd jobs, by chance finally reached his father’s house.Standing at the side of the gate he saw his father in the distance sitting onthe lion seat with his feet propped up on a jeweled stool, respectfully sur-rounded by many brahmans, kṣatriyas, and householders. His body wasadorned with pearl necklaces worth thousands of myriads. He was attendedon both sides by clerks and servants holding whisker fans. Above was a jew-eled canopy with various hanging flowered banners. Perfume was sprinkledon the ground, which was strewn with a variety of beautiful flowers. There8016c"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Chapter IVwere rows of precious objects, and people were coming and going, buyingand selling. With various trappings such as these, the father appeared verymajestic indeed.“The impoverished son, seeing his father wielding such great power,became terrified and regretted that he had ever come to that place. He thoughtto himself:He must be a king or of a similar rank. This is not a place where I canobtain things as a hired worker. It would certainly be better for me togo to a poor village, a place where I can use my ability and easily obtainclothing and food. If I stay here for very long I will be seized and putto forced labor.“Thinking this way, he quickly fled. At that time the wealthy man, sit-ting on the lion seat, realized that he had seen his son and became extremelyhappy. He then thought:Now there is someone to whom I can leave my fortune and treasures.I have been constantly thinking about my son but had no way to meethim, and now suddenly he has come. This is exactly what I wanted.Although I am old I still yearn for him.“The man immediately dispatched his attendants to chase his son andbring him back. Then the attendants quickly ran and overtook him. Theimpoverished son was frightened and cried out in fear:I did nothing wrong! Why are you seizing me?“The attendants grabbed him more firmly and forced him to return. Thenthe impoverished son thought:They have seized me even though I have done nothing wrong. I shallcertainly be killed.“He was so terrified that he collapsed unconscious on the ground. Hisfather, seeing this from a distance, told the attendants:I don’t need him. Don’t force him to come! Pour cold water on his faceand bring him to consciousness. Don’t say anything more to him.8117a"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Lotus Sutra“What was the reason for this? The father knew that his son was of lowlyaspiration, and that his own wealth and position would cause him problems.Although the father knew without doubt that the man was his son, he usedskillful means and did not say to others, ‘This is my son.’“The attendant then said to the son:You are free to go wherever you wish.“Then the impoverished son, happy because he had never felt such relief,stood up and went to a poor village to seek for food and clothing.“At that time, wanting to get his son back, the wealthy man employedskillful means and secretly dispatched two attendants of wretched and hum-ble appearance. He said to them:Approach the impoverished fellow and gently tell him that there is aplace for him to work where he will be paid double. If he gives hisassent then bring him back to work. If he asks you what kind of workthere is for him to do, tell him that he will be employed to sweep dungand that both of you will work with him.“Then the two attendants immediately went in search of the impover-ished son. When they found him they told him this. At that time he took hispay and immediately went to work sweeping dung.“The father, seeing his son, felt pity and wondered what to do. Then oneday while looking through the window he saw his son in the distance appear-ing emaciated and wretched, soiled with dung and dirt. The father took offhis necklaces, fine garments, and ornaments and put on torn, filthy clothes.Covering himself with dirt and taking a dung sweeper in his right hand, hemade himself look fearsome. He said to his workers: ‘Work hard and don’tbe lazy!’“Through this kind of skillful means he was able to approach his son.He spoke to him further saying:You! I want you to always work here. Don’t go anywhere else and Iwill pay you more. There will be no difficulty in getting the things youneed, like utensils, rice, noodles, salt, and vinegar. I also have an oldservant. If you need him I’ll give him to you. Be at ease! I am just likeyour father, so don’t worry about anything!

At thattime, even though the impoverished son rejoiced at being treated this way,he nevertheless still considered himself a humble employee. For this reasonhis father let him continue to sweep dung for twenty years. At the end of thisperiod of time each had come to trust the other. Yet even though the son hadfree access to his father’s house, he still lived in the same place as before.“O Bhagavat! One day the wealthy man became ill and knew he wasgoing to die before long. He said to the impoverished son:This is what I have been thinking and I want you to understand my inten-tions: I now have plenty of gold, silver, and precious treasures fillingmy storehouses. Get to know exactly how much is being taken in andout of them. Why do I want you to do this? Because you and I are oneand the same. Take good care of our fortune and don’t let it be lost!“Then the impoverished son obeyed his instructions. Although he learnedeverything about the gold, silver, precious treasure, and the storehouses, henever wanted to take even the least amount. Nevertheless he still lived inthe same place as before and was still not able to get rid of his feeling ofinferiority.“After a short time had passed the father knew that his son’s mind hadbecome composed, that his will had increased, and that he was ashamed ofhis former feelings. When the father was just on the verge of death he orderedhis son to meet the king, ministers, kṣatriyas, householders, and relatives,who had already assembled there. The father then declared:This is my son, my own progeny. When we were in a certain city heleft me and fled. He wandered around for more than fifty years under-going hardships. His original name is Such-and-such, and my name isSuch-and-such. Long ago when I was in that city I worried and searchedfor him. At last and unexpectedly I met up with him.

This very wealthy man is the Tathāgata, and all of us arethe heirs of the Buddha. The Tathāgata has always said that we are his chil-dren. Because of the triple sufferings, O Bhagavat, we experienced pain,were confused, ignorant and attached to inferior teachings in life after life.Today the Bhagavat has made us think about getting rid of the dung of fal-lacies regarding the reality of the world and that, in this respect, we diligentlystrove to attain the nirvana only as one seeking a salary for a single day’slabor. We had already attained it and were extremely happy and satisfiedwith it. We said to ourselves:Because we have made diligent efforts to comprehend the Buddha’steaching we have attained a great deal.“But the Bhagavat had formerly perceived that we were attached todesires and content with lowly aspirations. While letting us be so he did notexplain that we were to have a portion of the treasure house of the Tathā-gata’s wisdom and insight. Through the power of skillful means the Bhaga-vat has taught the wisdom of the Tathāgatas. Although we had attained nir-vana from the Buddha as our salary for one day’s labor, we thought we hadattained much and did not seek the Mahayana.“Furthermore, we have manifested and explained the wisdom of theTathāgata for the bodhisattvas; but we ourselves had no aspirations regard-ing it.“Why is this? The Buddha, knowing that we were content with lowlyaspirations, taught us according to what is appropriate through the power ofskillful means. But we did not know that we really were the heirs of theBuddha.“Now we fully know that the Bhagavat is unstinting in regard to the wis-dom of the buddhas. What is the reason for this?

The Tathāgata is exactly like this. Now for your sake he hasbecome a great leader who knows the long, dangerous, and evil road of birth,death, and desire’s confusion. You should leave it and be saved.“If sentient beings hear only about the single buddha vehicle they willthen want neither to see nor approach a buddha. They will think that the buddhapath is long and attainable only after enduring severe and protracted suffer-ing. The Buddha, knowing their minds, knowing that they are weak-willedand of lowly aspiration, teaches them the two nirvanas through skillful meansin order to let them rest halfway to the goal. If there are sentient beings whoabide in either of these two stages, the Tathāgata immediately teaches:What you have accomplished is not complete. The stage you abide inis close to the wisdom of the buddhas. You should observe and con-sider that the nirvana you have obtained is not the true one. It is onlythrough the power of the Tathāgata’s skillful means that the singlebuddha vehicle is explained as three.“The Buddha is just like that leader who conjured a great apparitionalcity to let the people rest.

Beating a drum I proclaimed to the four direc-tions that I was seeking the Dharma, saying:I will be as a servant for the rest of my life to whosoever can teach methe Mahayana.“At that time there was a sage who came to this king and said:I possess the Mahayana teaching called the Lotus Sutra. If you faith-fully obey me I will expound it to you.“Having heard the sage, the king became joyful and ecstatic and, accom-panying the sage, he did everything he was asked. He gathered fruits, drewwater, collected firewood, and provided meals. He even provided his ownbody as a bed for the sage. Yet he never tired in either body or mind and inthis way served the sage for one thousand years.

This Buddha Sarvarūpasaṃdarśana will give pre-dictions of highest, complete enlightenment one by one to bodhisattvas total-ing six thousand in number.”Then the nun Yaśodharā, the mother of Rāhula, thought this: “Whilegiving the predictions, the only name the Bhagavat did not mention wasmine.”The Buddha addressed Yaśodharā, saying: “In the future you will cul-tivate the bodhisattva practice of the teachings of hundreds of thousands ofmyriads of koṭis of buddhas.

These bodhisattvas are very rare.In respectful obedience to the Buddha they have made this great vow: ‘In thetroubled world to come, we will preserve, recite, and teach this Lotus Sutra!’“O Bhagavat! How can these bodhisattva mahāsattvas teach this sutrain the troubled world to come?”The Buddha addressed Mañjuśrī, saying: “If the bodhisattva mahā sattvaswant to teach this sutra in the troubled world to come, they should abide inthe four kinds of practices. The first is to establish the sphere of their bodhi-sattva practice and the sphere of their relationships and thereupon expoundthis sutra for the sake of sentient beings.“O Mañjuśrī! What is the sphere of the practice of the bodhisattvamahāsattva? If a bodhisattva mahāsattva abides in the stage of perseverance,is gentle, tranquil, nonviolent, and unafraid; and furthermore if he remainsunmoved with regard to existent things and perceives them in their true aspect,and neither acts nor discriminates, this is called the sphere of the practice ofthe bodhisattva mahāsattva.“What is the sphere of the relationships of the bodhisattva mahāsattva?The bodhisattva mahāsattvashould not consort with kings, princes, minis-ters, and chief officials. He should not consort with heretics, brahmans, Jains,and others, or with worldly writers, critics of poetry, materialists, or extremematerialists. Nor should he become acquainted with pranksters, boxers,wrestlers, clowns, and various jugglers, nor with outcastes and people whoraise boars, sheep, chickens, and dogs, nor with hunters, fishermen, and thosewith evil conduct. A bodhisattva should teach such people the Dharma ifthey come to him, but expect nothing.“Nor should a bodhisattva consort with monks, nuns, laymen, and lay-women who seek the śrāvakavehicle. Nor should he greet them.

The bodhisattva mahāsattvashould expound theteaching without any thought of desire for, or wish to see, a woman’s body.“If a bodhisattva enters someone else’s home he should not talk to younggirls, maidens, and widows. A bodhisattva should also not approach the fivekinds of impotent men nor be intimate with them. He should not enter some-one else’s home alone; and if for any reason he should enter it alone a bodhi-sattva should do nothing but singlemindedly contemplate the Buddha.“If he should teach the Dharma to women he should not show his teethwhen smiling nor reveal his chest. A bodhisattva should not be intimate withthem even for the sake of the Dharma. How much less for other things!“A bodhisattva should take no pleasure in keeping young disciples, śrā-maṇeras, or young boys. Nor should he take pleasure in having the sameteacher as them. He should always take pleasure in meditation and, in a quietplace, practice to control his mind. O Mañjuśrī! This is what is known as thefirst sphere of relationships.“Furthermore, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas perceive the emptiness ofall dharmas in their true aspect. All things are unerring, unmoving, nonre-turning, irreversible, and like empty space which lacks substance. They arebeyond all language. They are not produced, nor do they emerge, nor do theyarise. They do not have any name or mark, and in reality they have no sub-stance. They are immeasurable, limitless, without obstacles or obstructions.They exist only through dependent origination, arising through error. Thatis why I teach the permanent joy of perceiving the aspects of all existentthings in this way. This is what is known as the second sphere of relation-ships of a bodhisattva mahāsattva.”At that time the Bhagavat, wanting to elaborate upon the meaning ofthis further, spoke these verses:If, in the troubled world to come,A bodhisattva with a fearless mindWants to teach this sutra,He should enter the sphereOf the bodhisattva practiceAnd the sphere of relationships.194"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Chapter XIVHe should always stay away from kings,Princes, ministers, chief officials,Dangerous pranksters, outcastes,Heretics, and brahmans.He should not consortWith excessively proud scholars,Who are attached to scriptures of the inferior vehicleContained in the three baskets (Tripiṭaka);Nor with monks who violate the precepts,With those who call themselves arhats,Nor with nuns who like to joke and laugh.He should not become acquainted with laywomenWho are attached to the desires of the five senses,And seek nirvana in their present lives.If these people come to the bodhisattvaWith good intentionsIn order to hear about the buddha path,The bodhisattva should then fearlesslyTeach them the DharmaWithout any expectations.A bodhisattva should notBecome intimately acquaintedWith widows, maidens,Or impotent men.Nor should he consortWith slaughterers, butchers, hunters,Or fishermen who kill for profit.He should not consortWith people such as thoseWho make a livingFrom selling meatOr from pandering prostitutes.He should never become acquaintedWith dangerous wrestlers,Or the varieties of jugglers or courtesans.19537c"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Lotus SutraHe should not teach the DharmaTo a woman alone in a quiet place.When he teaches the DharmaHe should not joke or laugh.If he enters a village to beg for foodHe should be accompanied by a monk.If there is no monk he shouldSinglemindedly contemplate the Buddha.This is what is known asThe sphere of the bodhisattva practiceAnd the sphere of relationships.Within these two spheresHe can teach at ease.He should not practiceThe superior, mediocre, or inferior teachings,The conditioned and the unconditioned,Or the teaching of the real and the unreal.Nor should he discriminateBetween men and women.He should not acquire, comprehend,Or perceive any phenomenon.This is what is knownAs the sphere of theBodhisattva practice.All dharmas are empty and without substance,Impermanent, without origination or cessation.This is known as the sphereOf the relationships of the wise.Through the error of discriminationOne sees all existent thingsAs existing or nonexisting,Real or unreal,Produced or unproduced.Being in a quiet place, the bodhisattvaCarries out practices to control his mind196"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Chapter XIVAnd remains as firm and unmovedAs Mount Sumeru.He should regard all dharmasAs being without substance,Like empty spaceWhich has no firmness.All dharmas are neither producedNor do they emerge;They are immovable, nonreturning,And always remain in their single character.This is known as the sphere of relationships.Any monk after my parinirvāṇaWho enters the sphere of practiceAnd the sphere of relationshipsWill not be disheartenedWhen he teaches this sutra.A bodhisattva, at proper times,Should enter a quiet chamberAnd contemplate all dharmasWith correct thoughts,According to the meaning.Arising from meditation he should revealAnd expound this sutraTo kings, princes, ministers, and brahmans.Then his mind will be at ease and unafraid.O Mañjuśrī!This is the bodhisattvaWho firmly abides in the Dharma from the beginningAnd in the world to come will be ableTo teach the Lotus Sutra.“Furthermore, O Mañjuśrī, after the Tathāgata’s parinirvāṇa, anyonewho wants to teach this sutra in the Age of the Decadent Dharma shouldabide in ease of practice.

Even if someone counted the number of the great bodhi-sattvas for thousands of myriads of koṭis of kalpas they would not be ableto finish. There would be no end. From long ago these bodhisattvas havebeen planting roots of good merit in the presence of immeasurable, limitlessbuddhas.

It is, O Bhagavat, difficult tobelieve such things in this world.“Suppose a handsome man with dark hair, twenty-five years of age,were to point to a hundred-year-old man and say:He is my son.“And the one-hundred-year-old man points to the young fellow and says:He is my father and he raised me!“This would be difficult to believe; and what the Buddha has now taughtis exactly like this. It has not, in fact, been so long since the Buddha attainedthe path. Yet for the sake of the buddha path this great assembly of bodhi-sattvas has been diligently striving for innumerable thousands of myriads ofkoṭis of kalpas.

They have gradually and ably practiced wholesometeachings and are skilled at discussions. They are jewels among humans anda great rarity in the entire world.“Today the Bhagavat has correctly said that after he attained the pathof the Buddha he caused the thought of enlightenment to awaken in the bodhi-sattvas for the first time.

Although we abide in the stage ofnonretrogression we cannot understand it. O Bhagavat! Such worlds as theseare incalculable and limitless.”Then the Buddha addressed the assembly of the great bodhisattvas, say-ing: “O sons of a virtuous family! I will now explain it clearly to you. Sup-pose all these worlds, whether or not a particle was left in them, were reducedto particles, and each particle represented a kalpa.The period of time sinceI became a buddha would exceed this by hundreds of thousands of myriadsof koṭis of nayutas of incalculable kalpas.

During this interim I explained about theBuddha Dīpaṃkara and others.

Because the Tathāgata perceives all the marks of the tripleworld as they really are: that there is no birth and death, coming or going;that there is also no existence or extinction in the world, truth or falsehood,sameness or difference. The Tathāgata does not view the triple world as sen-tient beings in the triple world see it. The Tathāgata perceives such thingsclearly and without mistakes.“Since sentient beings have various natures, desires, behaviors, thoughts,and distinctions, the Tathāgata, wanting to cause them to plant roots of goodmerit, has explained various teachings through a variety of examples, expla-nations, and illustrations. He has not desisted from doing buddha acts evenfor a single moment and in this way it has been an extremely long time sinceI attained buddhahood. My lifespan is immeasurable and incalculable.

If they see the Tathāgataalways existing without extinction, they then become proud, self-willed, andnegligent. The thought that the Buddha is difficult to meet and that he is tobe respected cannot awaken in them. That is why the Tathāgata teachesthrough skillful means, saying:O monks! You should know that the appearance of the buddhas in theworld is very difficult to encounter.“Why is this? Because some of those with little merit may not see theBuddha during the passage of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myr-iads of koṭis of kalpas.“For this reason I say:O monks!

It is entirely true, never false, all for the sakeof saving sentient beings.“Suppose there were an excellent doctor. He is wise, knowledgeable,his prescriptions are effective, and he has skillfully cured a variety of dis-eases. This man has many sons, say ten, twenty, or even one hundred in num-ber. For some reason, he has to go far off to another country and, while heis away, his children, whom he has left behind, drink some poison.

Seeing their fatherin the distance they all rejoice greatly and kneeling respectfully address him,saying:It is good that you have returned safely. In our ignorance we took thispoison by mistake. We entreat you to cure and save us, and restore usto life.“Seeing his children suffering in this way, the father searches for benefi-cial herbs possessed of good color, aroma, and flavor, according to the med-ical manual. Blending them together after grinding and sifting, he gives themixture to the children and says:This is an extremely beneficial medicine with good color, aroma, andflavor. All of you take it! It will quickly remove your pain and youwill never be afflicted again.“Then the children who have not become delirious see this beneficialmedicine of good color and aroma, and immediately take it. The afflictionis completely removed and they are cured. The remaining children, thosewho are delirious, seeing their father coming to them, rejoice and ask himto seek a cure for their illness. Although he offers them the medicine, they226"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Chapter XVIwill not take it. Why is this? The poison has so deeply penetrated them thatthey have become delirious. They do not think that the medicine with goodcolor and aroma is good.“The father thinks:These children are to be pitied. The poison has completely warpedtheir minds. Although they rejoiced upon seeing me and sought a curethey will not take this beneficial medicine. I will now cause them totake this medicine through skillful means.“Then he says to them:You should know that I am now old and feeble, close to death. I willnow leave this beneficial medicine here. You should take it. Do notworry about not recovering.“Having left these instructions he goes to another country and sends amessenger back home to tell them: ‘Your father has already died.’ Upon hear-ing that their father is dead, the children become very distressed and think:If our father had lived he would have taken pity on us and protectedus. But now, abandoning us, he has died in a distant country.“They now consider themselves orphans having no one to rely upon.Through constant grieving their minds become clear, and only then do theyrealize that the medicine has fine color, aroma, and flavor. They immediatelytake it and the poison is completely driven out. The father, hearing that allhis children have completely recovered, immediately returns and makes hisappearance.”The Buddha then asked the bodhisattvas: “O sons of a virtuous family!Do you think there is anyone who would say that this good doctor is guiltyof lying?”The bodhisattvas replied: “No, we do not, O Bhagavat!”The Buddha said: “I am just like this.
