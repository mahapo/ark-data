It is also the only canonical scripture to focus on this deity. The text’s importance is therefore commensurate with the importance of the goddess herself, who is the chief Buddhist deity of magnetizing, in particular the magnetizing which takes the form of enthrallment. The text is a treasury of ritual practices connected with enthrallment and similar magical acts—practices which range from formal sādhana to traditional homa ritual, and to magical methods involving herbs, minerals, etc. The text’s varied contents are presented as a multi-layered blend of the apotropaic and the soteriological, as well as the practical and the philosophical, where these complementary opposites combine together into a genuinely spiritual Buddhist work.

Translated by Thomas Doctor from the Tibetan of the Degé Kangyur, with continuous reference to an English translation and critical edition of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts by Wieslaw Mical. English text edited by Gillian Parrish. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Introduction The very foundation of all Buddhist paths is the recognition of the unsatisfactory nature of saṃsāra, the cycle of conditioned existence, and the quest for liberation from it. Building upon that basis, the Great Vehicle holds that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are indeed inseparable and that the goal of all practice must be the liberation from suffering, not only of oneself, but of all other beings. It is a debated point as to whether tantra has its own unique view. Where there is unanimity, however, is that the path of the tantras adds a panoply of methods that enable the practitioner to achieve the goal of the Great Vehicle swiftly and effectively. The tantras are concerned principally with the stages of “deity yoga.” With the guidance of a skilled teacher and after suitable preliminary training and empowerment, the practitioner is introduced to, and subsequently trains in recognizing, the divine nature of the world and its inhabitants. This is symbolically centered on the generation of the deity as the embodiment of enlightenment in one of its many aspects—a depiction in terms of form, sound, and imagination of the very goal to which the practitioner aspires. Through various modes of such practice, which differ according to the different levels of tantra, the practitioner is able to recognize, access, and actualize his or her own innately enlightened nature. The female deity Kurukullā, whose practice is the subject-matter of this text, has a particular place and orientation amid the pantheon of meditational deities. Like all deities, she is a personification of buddhahood in its entirety. As a female deity, she is understood to embody the wisdom aspect of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" enlightenment (i.e., emptiness), and as a form of the savioress Tārā, herself a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, she personifies all-embracing compassion. But her particular quality is related to the “activity” of enlightenment. Many Great Vehicle scriptures describe the spontaneous and effortless activity of buddhas for the benefit of beings. In Vajrayāna that enlightened activity is spoken of in terms of four modes, or types, of activity: pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and destroying. It is the third of these, magnetizing, that is the special field of Kurukullā, and it is to deploy that particular quality of enlightenment that a practitioner would undertake her practice. While there are as many as thirty-seven Kurukullā sādhana liturgies included in the Tengyur, and many more in the indigenous Tibetan literature, the text translated here is the only work in the Kangyur that focuses on Kurukullā. Rather than being a systematic presentation of one form of practice, it takes the form of a compendium of varied elements—ranging from formal sādhanas to traditional fire offering ritual, and to magical recipes and methods involving herbs, minerals, and other ingredients—from which a practitioner might draw in order to constitute a range of Kurukullā-centered practices. The text’s varied contents are presented as a multi-layered blend of the apotropaic and the soteriological, as well as the practical and the philosophical. The text’s pattern of contents is in keeping with the term kalpa figuring in the title. An ancient meaning, already found in the Ṛgveda, of the word kalpa, is “sacred rule” or “precept,” applying, in particular, to ritual procedures. As such, the scriptures that carry this term in their title are mostly ritual compendia or manuals of ritual practice. With the emergence of Vajrayāna a number of these works appeared, such as the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa, the Kurukullākalpa, and the Vajravārāhī-kalpa. As these titles might then suggest, they are ritual compendia for their specific deities. The word kalpa derives from the root kḷp, which means “to prepare” or “to arrange.” This meaning is also reflected in the contents of the works that belong to this genre—they are"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" primarily concerned with the technicalities of the ritual rather than with philosophical debate about the principles involved. This is, however, not to say that the latter is altogether absent. Genre-wise, kalpas are closely related to tantras, inasmuch as they are divinely revealed by the Buddha or one of the great bodhisattvas, such as Avalokiteśvara or Vajrapāṇi. Moreover, both kalpas and tantras are concerned with a particular deity, or set of deities, and aim to guide the practitioner in the rituals and practices related to that deity. The Tibetan version of the Practice Manual of Noble Tārā Kurukullā is structured into five chapters, whereas the Sanskrit has essentially the same content structured into eight. Chapter One begins with the statement of its authenticity, and for this, the text declares that it is a direct literary descendant of the Tantra of the Arising of Tārā (Tārodbhava). These Kurukullā teachings, as found in our text, were given by Lord Avalokiteśvara on the Potala mountain, in response to a plea by a female audience consisting of different classes of semi-divine beings. Responding to their request, Avalokiteśvara begins to explain Kurukullā worship and its requisites, which include the drawing of the deity’s image (Kurukullā in her four-armed, seated form), the eighteen-fold pūjā, the mantra and the gathering offering. The main three benefits of this practice are the ability to enthrall beings, to increase wisdom, and to remove poison. These benefits all have a spiritual dimension if the practitioner possesses a bodhisattva attitude: with loving kindness he or she will be able to control wild animals, with compassion practitioners will deliver the entire world from pain, and by becoming identical with Tārā-Kurukullā, they will be able to provide assistance to beings in need. The practice of compassionate virtue is the key to this success. In Chapter Two there follows a description of the sādhana of the wish-fulfilling tree, through which one makes offerings to the buddhas and provides sentient beings with all that they need. This sādhana of the wish-fulfilling tree is followed by the main"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" sādhana of the Kurukullākalpa. It is introduced by the statement that the mind is the sole “reality,” and because of its being such, the key to attaining buddhahood is the cleansing of the mirror of mind. The means for this cleansing is this very sādhana. As it follows the formal structure of a typical yoginītantrasādhana with its prayers, worship, visualizations, etc., it is not necessary to recount here all the traditional details. After summoning the “wisdom being,” one requests an empowerment (abhiṣeka, dbang), and along with the empowerment one is given the injunctions regarding the follow-up practice. The sign of success is that the lotus-mudrā formed with one’s hands at the end of the six-month practice period will burst into flames. By proceeding as described, the practitioner (sādhaka, sgrub pa po) will attain the three enlightened bodies and will thereby be able to enact the great deeds of the Buddha. At this point in the text, there is an interruption in the description of the empowerment and of the samaya-pledges (which are resumed much later in the text), and we have instead a discourse, given by Vajrapāṇi, on the three enlightened bodies, followed by a Nāgārjuna-style exposition of the doctrine of emptiness. When asked how the mudrās, mantras, maṇḍalas and siddhis should be interpreted in the context of emptiness, Varjapāṇi explains that they too are part of the chain of dependent origination—i.e., that the accomplishments are achieved in dependence on the mudrās, the mantras and so forth. Chapter Three begins with a section containing various methods and related information on the main types of Kurukullā activity—enthralling, increasing wisdom, and removing poison, with discussion of the deeper spiritual implications of these three acts. We are told what materials should be used as mālā beads for these three types of activity, and are given specific instructions on the lighting of sacrificial fires (the shape of the fire pit, the type of fire-wood, etc.) and on the substances used as offerings. Some methods further described involve medicinal plants and other materials. The teacher also points out the more profound purposes: by enthralling beings with the mind of loving kindness one can establish all of them in enlightenment,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" by increasing intelligence one can attain the perfection of wisdom and achieve liberation, and by removing poison one brings peace to the world. Further, we are given instructions on the method of visualizing the syllable hrīḥ (the seed syllable of Kurukullā) on different parts of the body and told the benefits arising from that: if it is on the clitoris, then enthrallment will follow; if on the chest, wisdom will increase; if between the teeth, one will remove poison. Connections are explained between the removal of faults of the body, speech and mind, and the acts of enthrallment, removing poison, and increasing wisdom, respectively. There is also a connection between removing poison (in the spiritual sense) and increasing wisdom. When the poison of ignorance is neutralized, desire is pure wisdom. It is explained that the goddess Pāṇḍarā (implicitly identified with Kurukullā) is, in essence, desire. Her non-dual passion is, however, completely free from poison and thus none other than wisdom. The section on these different methods ends with a description of other Kurukullā magical practices, mostly for bringing results other than the main three outcomes specified above. These include: a yantra for warding off snakes, amulets for enthrallment and protection, rituals for bringing wealth with the help of drawings or a cowrie shell (the latter is also said to help one obtain a kingdom or even win at dice). In Chapter Four we return to the description of the empowerment and the samaya ritual. This includes the description of the Kurukullā maṇḍala and the divination wherein a flower is tossed into the maṇḍala. After the divination, the initiand is told to observe secrecy regarding his practice and is given the samaya injunctions. The practitioner is instructed to rely on red substances, abstain from non-virtue, accomplish all the qualities associated with the perfections (pāramitā, pha rol tu phyin pa), and respect and pay homage to all women. Once the samaya has been received, the four empowerments are bestowed, using water from the four jars of “the arrow,” “the bow,” “fearlessness,” and “the lotus.” An offering maṇḍala is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" described, with eight pitchers containing precious substances, along with a “pitcher of victory.” The disciple, suitably attired, is ushered into the maṇḍala and taught a secret method to control the nāgas. The Kurukullā dhāraṇī is now given—a lengthy formula aimed at bringing rain and prosperity. Further methods involving interaction with nāgas are also described—for stopping excessive rain, for curing leprosy and snakebites, and also for magically summoning and enthralling nāga women. Chapter Five contains three nidāna stories, which are accounts of situations that prompted the Buddha to give the Kurukullā teachings. The first story is about the Buddha’s son, Rāhula, who, while being “pulled” (i.e., subjected to a particular kind of magic) by a nāga, recites the Kurukullā mantra and is miraculously transported into the Buddha’s presence. Witnessing thus the power of Kurukullā’s mantra, he requests from the Buddha the Kurukullā teachings. The second story is about Mahākāla and Hārītī. Mahākāla, not being happy in his marriage with the ill-tempered demoness Hārītī, neglects his duty to protect the teachings. The Kurukullākalpa is then taught to help Hārītī enthrall Mahākāla, and in this way, mend things between these two unhappy lovers. As this is successfully accomplished, great happiness ensues. The third story is about Rohiṇīkumāra, a boy who, although born with auspicious marks, is dull-witted. His father asks the Buddha about possible ways to increase Rohiṇīkumāra’s intelligence, and in response, Buddha teaches the boy the Kurukullākalpa. As a result, Rohiṇīkumāra acquires great learning and wisdom. The next section treats of alchemy (applied in combination with the Kurukullā mantra), which, as may be expected, is meant to bring the accomplishments of sky-travel and longevity. Here we find instructions on: 1) producing a mercury preparation which will enable the alchemist to fly through the sky as well as give him the power to enthrall women, 2) producing silver using a specially processed mercury (this is meant to lead, eventually, to the ultimate benefit for oneself and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" others), and 3) attaining the accomplishment of longevity by employing special plant-preparations. The last part of Chapter Five describes the magical use of herbs and other substances (in combination with the Kurukullā mantra), as well as amulets, yantras, and other practices, which may be described as magical. Some of these means include: an ointment protecting one from wild elephants; a paste, which, when smeared on shoes, will enable the wearer to walk on water; an incense for the well-being of monks; an ointment to stop children from vomiting breast-milk; inscribed amulets affording protection and bringing good fortune; an amulet to be worn on one’s forearm to bring wealth; an alms-bowl inscribed with the Kurukullā mantra which enables the owner to procure alms in a place where they are difficult to obtain; various methods of enthrallment; a method preventing miscarriage; methods ensuring easy childbirth; remedies for breast diseases; practices meant to prevent premature greying of the hair; a paste meant to help women secrete vaginal lubrication (for pleasurable love-making); a remedy for premature ejaculation; a method for putting out a fire by sprinkling it with wine; and enthrallment methods involving yantra. Other wished-for results include: obtaining a fine son, healing different types of fever, curing eye diseases, overcoming impotence and finding buried treasures. Finally, the closing passages of the chapter once more ground the text and its teaching in the compassion of Avalokiteśvara, and beyond him in the infinite activity of the buddhas throughout space and time. The final colophon in the Tibetan text gives the names of its two translators: the Indian Kṛṣnapaṇḍita and the Tibetan Tsültrim Gyalwa (tshul khrims rgyal ba, 1011-c. 1068). The latter is also known as Naktso Lotsawa (nag tsho lo tsā ba), a prolific translator who met the Indian master Atiśa Dipaṃkāraśrījñāna (982-1054) at the monastic university of Vikramaśīla and followed him on his journey to Tibet. With Atīśa and Kṛṣnapaṇḍita, Tsültrim Gyalwa translated numerous classical texts of both sūtra and mantra."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" This English translation was prepared on the basis of the readings of the Degé Kangyur found in the Comparative (dpe bsdur ma) edition. The translation emerged in a process of continuous reference to a critical edition of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts and an English translation from the Sanskrit already prepared by one of the collaborators in this project.1As the various Sanskrit manuscripts of the Kurukullā are not readily available and present important variants, we have decided to include the critical edition as an appendix to this translation. While endeavouring to produce a rendering of the Practice Manual of Noble Tārā Kurukullā informed by the full range of available Sanskrit and Tibetan manuscripts and editions, we have nevertheless retained the primary objective of translating here the Tibetan text contained in the Degé Kangyur. Where the Tibetan text is open to multiple interpretations, the English translation follows the Sanskrit manuscripts whenever this can be done while staying within the field of meanings conveyed by the Degé text. In general, words in Sanskrit have been reconstructed on the basis of the Sanskrit manuscripts rather than the Tibetan transliterations. Where the translation diverges from the explicit message of the Tibetan manuscript, the discrepancies have been noted. There are numerous further instances where the Tibetan and Sanskrit texts differ. These can be appreciated through a comparison with the forthcoming annotated translation from the Sanskrit.

Then, having changed into a garment of three pieces, He should correctly draw the Enchantress: Single-faced, with elongated eyes, [I.19] Four-armed and of the color of kunkuma, Sixteen years old and displaying an amorous sentiment, Puffed up with pride on account of her magical feminine charm.

He should present a feast for the congregation of listeners, and next offer a feast with gifts for the community of those practicing the secret mantra of the Great Vehicle. Placing his right knee on the ground, and with his robe thrown over one shoulder, he should receive the desired accomplishments.

[II.32] With the following verses to the buddhas One should request empowerment: “Just as Bodhivajra offers The great worship to the buddhas, [II.33] So too, in order to protect me, Please, now grant it to me, O Khavajra.” With the so-called ‘empowerment of the Victor’"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"14 Locanā and the other four arise.

[II.36] With red light of different hues She illuminates the three worlds. One who has obtained the jewel of empowerment Will attain all accomplishments.

By means of this mantra, [II.38] And through the ritual of cane or cakes, One will obtain a sign during dream. The sword, the accomplishment of the netherworld, Invisibility, the extraction of essences, [II.39] Anonymity, celestial realms, Foot unguent, and eye ointment— The signs will be seen in dreams And the accomplishments themselves will manifest.

They attain the station of the lord of the gods And become lords of the triple universe. [II.47] When born in the family of Buddha, They become turners of the wheel.

[II.51] All the blessed ones, the thus-gone ones, then addressed the great bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, so as to examine his noble mind: “How, O Vajrapāṇi, could the buddhas, the blessed ones, who possess vajra bodies, who possess dharmadhātu bodies, possibly die at some location on earth?” Vajrapāṇi, in turn, offered the following words to those buddhas and bodhisattvas: “The bodhisattvas have asked me this, ‘How could buddhas, who possess vajra bodies, dharmadhātu bodies, bodies of non-duality, possibly die at some location on earth?’” And he proceeded, “Listen, O bodhisattvas, the so-called nirvāṇa [F.34.a] means a passage to the realm of bliss.” The bodhisattvas enquired: “O Vajrapāṇi, do the buddhas, the blessed ones, go to the realm of bliss after they relinquish the dharma body, or do they go to the realm of bliss by means of the enjoyment body, having left behind their emanation body?

Does the one who is the Buddha exist, or not exist?” The bodhisattvas replied, “O Vajrapāṇi, buddhas neither exist nor do they not exist.” Vajrapāṇi spoke: “Indeed, it is the unborn that is born.

"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"21 Chapter Three The progression of the ritual for reciting the mantra, Shall now be explained. By merely understanding it, The practitioner will reach success. [III.1] Coral is used for enthrallment, Puṣkara removes poison, And with crystal insight will expand. These are to be used in three activities. [III.2] In a pit the shape of an aśvattha-tree leaf, which is the pure nature of the place of birth, one should light a fire with wood from the aśoka-tree. One must then, in the prescribed way, perform one hundred and eight offerings of red lotus flowers. The fire should be obtained from the home of an actor. The offerings are to be smeared with the three sweets and presented together with the root mantra. Next comes the diagram. One should draw a triangular maṇḍala on cotton smeared with the mark of the moon. Within it, one writes entreating words that include the names of the practitioner and the one to be won: “Let me succeed in attracting such and such a person!” As one enriches this with the root mantra, one should write with a paint of liquid lac, blood from one’s left ring finger, camphor, kunkuma, and musk. If one wishes to increase insight one should, in the same pit as before, burn arka and karavīra with the sacrificial fire used for"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"22 brahmin oblations. One should offer aṭarūṣaka leaves10 or sweet flag ten thousand times. For removing poison, one should light a fire in the same basin with wood of the sandal tree, and in that offer the flowers of the piṇḍatagara. Thus one will become a curer of all poison. One will heal the different pains and bring peace. This is the rite of the gāruḍa knowledge tantra. On the paths of the triple universe One will attract and engage with All those who are known as noblewomen By means of oblation and the diagram. [III.3] Loving-kindness through looking with impassioned love— [F.35.b] It is through such a mind that one performs enthrallment. Having enthralled all beings, One establishes them in the enlightenment of the Buddha. [III.4] This is the rite of enthrallment. The so-called “knower of everything” Cannot be attained without insight. The one who wishes to attain it, Should therefore develop incisive insight. [III.5] Through the practice of recitation and oblations One will encounter all phenomena. The mind that is pure, bright, and stainless— That indeed is the transcendent insight. [III.6] The yogin will be liberated. The leaves of gṛhābhidhāna, Ṣaṭhī, liquorice Brahmāṇī, māgadhī, and honey— These are to be eaten. [III.7]"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"23 This is the ritual for increasing insight. Next11 there is honey with ghee, Cakrāṅkita, and the good root— By applying this to the place struck by the poisonous fangs, Or by drinking it, one will neutralize the poison. [III.8] This is the medicine that overcomes poison. Jārī and caṇḍālikā, Snehamallī and ghee, As well as dead intestinal worms— When eaten, these effect enthrallment. [III.9] This is the medicine for performing enthrallment. The removal of poison brings peace in the world; From the development of insight comes buddhahood. Turning the wheel of Dharma will be accomplished In an instant by the one who practices enthrallment. [III.10] For accomplishing the benefit of oneself and others There is no other means within the Great Vehicle. The practice of a spell just once Will immediately be convincing. [III.11] Thinking of the syllable hrīḥ at the vessel of frenzy Will cause women to drip. Thinking of it upon the tongue or in the center of the heart, Will engender insights. [III:12] When meditated upon in relation to the bite of the fangs This beautiful syllable of Dharma Will destroy poison. This heart of Tārā conquers the three worlds— [III.13] That should be understood by those who love."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"24 As the negativities of speech completely disappear, one will be able to remove poison; when those of the mind disappear, insight will increase; and when the flaws of the body are exhausted, one will bring about enthrallment. [III.14] Hence, since this world is attached to non-virtue, it does not gain accomplishment. Therefore, O sons of the victorious ones, you must act to benefit, and give up evil. By means of the specific gestures the faults associated with the body certainly disappear [F.36.a] and, through the mantra, so do the faults associated with the composites of the tongue. [III.15] The faults associated with the mind fade away in those whose minds delight in meditation. With the joy of stainless faith, the cognitions of the body become unmoving—that is the time of the Buddha’s blessing. The one who sees with an eye free from evil and who possesses compassion will become king of the three worlds. With his power of merit superior because of generosity, he becomes the foremost on the surface of the earth, a benefactor endowed with diligence. [III.16] Having given up laziness, and by means of wisdom, he will not experience even a bit of the suffering of hell. Therefore, one relies on the wealth of the compassion of the sons of the victorious ones, and on their diligent conduct. Perceiving the buddhas in the center of the sky, one regards the buddhas by the power of concentration. Even in sleep one should always perceive oneself to be surrounded by the buddhas. [III.17] At the time of death the wise proceed to the summit of mount Meru; Buddhas riding in various vehicles— These are seen by the ones who are compassionate by nature. Doing evil produces the perception of the cities of hell. [III.18] This is the tantra for purification. Where there is desire there is poison And also insight is present there.12"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"25 Therefore, how can Pāṇḍarā Be regarded as the queen of speech?13[III.19] She is indeed the curer of poison Abiding on the level of Hayagrīva.14 Manifesting as the speech of the vajra of passion, She enthralls the three worlds. [III.20] This is the practice of the tantra of the desire family. Next follows another method: Having created a triangular maṇḍala And, in addition, another triangle, The wise must, starting from Indra’s quarter, Write the syllable oṃ and so forth. [III.21] The six seed-syllables are in the six corners, And the seed-syllable of Dharma is in the center. Placed within a phuḥ syllable, It should be drawn on the doorstep. [III.22] This is the tantra for driving away snakes. Now, to bring women fortune, another method shall be explained: One should draw a lotus flower with seven petals and apply the seven syllables to it. In its center one should, according to the enthrallment-procedure, write the name of the person to be enthralled, [F.36.b] supported by a pair of hrīḥ syllables. One should draw this on birch bark, or on cotton with flowers, and make it into a charm that is to be worn on the upper arm. The master will become the slave of a woman And kings will turn into servants.

Next follows the diagram for protection: One should draw a four-petal lotus, And then, in its center, a moon. In the east one should draw an arrow, And in the south, a bow. [III.24] In the west is a hand showing the mudrā of fearlessness, And in the north, one draws a lotus. In the central moon is the one to be protected Surrounded by the seven seed syllables. [III.25] As for the outer perimeter, It is adorned with a garland of utpalas. Having drawn this on birch bark, One should wear it on one’s upper arm. [III.26] Moreover, children, the old, and the young will be self-protected by the diagram. If one desires the attainment of a lord, one should draw a citron and, in its center, a bow. Inside the bow, one should draw a jewel-shaped lotus-bud. In the center of the lotus-bud is the syllable jrūṃ, surrounded by the seven syllables. One should draw this on a golden tablet and keep it in the upper part of the house. One should surround it with an outer garland of lotuses, and, on the eighth or twelfth day of the month, using a jar containing five types of jewels, one should take it down. Having washed and worshipped it, one should recite the mantra one hundred and eight times. Within a year, one will become the equal of Kubera. Such a charm should be worn correctly. Next follows another method: on a Tuesday, if one finds a cowrie shell lying with its face up, one should place it in the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"27 palm of the hand and recite the mantra one hundred thousand times. If one plays dice, one will be winning. Taking up the cowrie one should recite the Kurukullā mantra one hundred and eight times. On the twelfth or eighth day of the month, one should perform ablutions and make offerings. Then one should wrap the shell in silk and wear it on one’s arm. [F.37.a] The one who does so will become a great master of riches. If one puts this shell in a box and hides it in the ground one will every day obtain a kārṣa’s worth of wealth. This is the tantra on obtaining wealth, a kingdom, royalty, and the fruit. This completes the third chapter.

[IV.4] At this point the sattvavajrī mudrā should be displayed, a flower should be offered to the circle, and the words “praticcha vajra hoh” be spoken. Then, as the cover is removed, the maṇḍala is to be revealed. In the best case, the flower has fallen in the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"29 center. If it has fallen on the arrow, the student will be capable of performing the acts of enthrallment. If it has fallen on the giver of fearlessness, the student should study the removal of poison. If it has fallen on the utpala, it is the development of insight that should be studied. And if it has fallen on the bow, omniscient wakefulness is to be pursued. At the time of the entry, the following should be declared: “You must not speak of this supreme secret of all the thus-gone ones in front of anyone who has not entered this maṇḍala. Your samaya vow would definitely degenerate. Having failed to avoid the distressful, you would certainly die and fall into hell.” After that the samayas are to be given with the words, “The Three Jewels must never be abandoned...” and so forth, just as it is extensively taught in the tantra. The oath is to be administered with the following words: “If any among the great samaya vows of the King of Dharma Which you have received from me [F.37.b] should degenerate The buddhas and bodhisattvas Who engage in the supreme conduct of secret mantra [IV.5] Will extract and consume The great blood and the great heart.

You must not kill living beings, Not speak what is not true, Not take what has not been given, [IV.11] And not associate with another’s wife. Three acts of the body, Four of speech, And three of the mind— [IV.12] Give up these unvirtuous acts. Dharma, material things, Love, and fearlessness— You must always practice this four-fold generosity. [IV.13] If you possess nothing, be generous through acts of meditation. Also, you must always display the four means of magnetizing, Along with the body of the perfections, The powers, and the masteries. [IV.14] You must not look down on females, Particularly not anyone by the name of Tārā. Even a householder practitioner of secret mantra May not take such a woman.

She therefore became depressed, and in order to enthrall Mahākāla this Kurukullā compendium was taught. From then on, her fortune became vast and excellent. For that reason, O children of noble family, if you wish to enthrall sentient beings you should familiarize yourselves with this mantra and this manual of instructions. It also came to pass that Sunanda’s son was born handsome and good looking, athletic and in possession of auspicious marks, and yet nevertheless dull-witted. Sunanda therefore requested the Blessed One, “O Lord, my son was born handsome and good looking, athletic and in possession of auspicious marks, and yet nevertheless dull-witted. How, O Lord, may he develop insight? Lord, if this child becomes literate he shall become a protector of your doctrine.” Upon hearing this, the Blessed One, with words preceded by mindfulness, [F.40.a] spoke this manual of practice and gave this mantra. As soon as he had done so, Sunanda’s son, Rohiṇīkumāra by name, acquired insight. By the twelfth year he was free from being intimidated by any of the treatises, as he was thoroughly acquainted with all of the crafts and arts.
