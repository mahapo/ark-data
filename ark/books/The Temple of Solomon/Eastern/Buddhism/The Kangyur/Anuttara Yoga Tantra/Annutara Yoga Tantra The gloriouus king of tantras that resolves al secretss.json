The work is organized according to a dialogue between the Buddha and Vajragarbha—the lead interlocutor throughout many of the Yoginītantras—and the Buddha’s responses give particular attention to the specifications of the subtle body completion-stage yoga involving manipulations of the body’s subtle energy channels, winds and fluids in conjunction with either a real or imagined consort. The tantra sets its interpretation of these common Yoginītantra themes and imagery within the wider context of the four initiations prevalent in this class of tantras. In resolving the secrets connected with each initiation, the text elaborates the different levels of meaning connected with each initiation’s contemplative practices. Acknowledgments Translated by the Dharmachakra Translation Committee. The principal translator for this text was James Gentry, who also wrote the introduction. Andreas Doctor later edited the translation and compared it with the original Tibetan. The Dharmachakra Translation Committee would like to thank Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche for suggesting this tantra for translation and Khenpo Sangyay Gyatso for his generous assistance with the resolution of several difficult passages."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Introduction This translation is based on seven Tibetan-language textual witnesses of a translation from Sanskrit into Tibetan ostensibly executed by the 11th century translation team of the Indian paṇḍita Gayādhara and the Tibetan translator Drogmi Śākya Yeshé (’brog mi shā kya ye shes). The Sanskrit manuscript(s) upon which tradition claims Gayādhara and Drogmi based their translation has since vanished from the purview of Buddhists and Buddhist scholars.1 In reliance, then, on the two conjectured dates of Drokmi’s death, this tantra’s terminus ante quem can only be roughly estimated to be either 1043 or 1072.2 Tibetan historical records claim that Gayādhara continued to be active after Drokmi’s death.3 Judging from its bibliographic location within the relevant Kangyur collections, as well as from the distinctive themes it advances, this tantra belongs to the Yoginī class of tantras. Post-10th century Tibetan classification schemes4 that were formalized by the 14th century in the structure of the Tibetan Kangyurs typically catalogue the translated texts of the Yoginītantra class, which Tibetans called “Mother tantras,” alongside what they called “Father tantras”5 and “Non-dual tantras,”6 to make up the more inclusive category of “Unexcelled Yoga Tantra” (yoganiruttara / anuttarayoga tantra).7 The Unexcelled Yoga tantras, believed by most Tibetan exegetes to be the ultimate revelation of the Buddha of our eon, therefore occupy the first major bibliographic category in the “tantra collection”8 of most Kangyur collections. Unexcelled Yoga tantras are in turn followed by the tantra classes of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" “Yoga,” “Conduct” and finally “Action,” an order thought to represent along a descending gradient the relative soteriological power of the yogic techniques emphasized in each textual class. The same hierarchical logic is also reflected in the Kangyur’s internal sub-divisions of Highest Yoga tantra itself, where the highest of the high, Non-dual tantras, are followed by Mother tantras and then by Father tantras, once again reflecting in descending order Tibetan conceptions of the relative profundity and power of each sub-class’s methodological emphasis. In relating the rationale for this tripartite hierarchy in his commentary on the Guhyagarbhatantra, Longchenpa (klong chen rab ’byams pa dri med ’od zer, 1308–1364) echoes the following popular tantric dictum: Father tantra primarily teaches generation stage, mother tantra primarily teaches completion stage, and non-dual tantra primarily teaches their integration.9 In terms of content, then, Yoginītantras emphasize the apex of those Buddhist tantric methodologies developed on the Indian subcontinent from the 9th through the 12th centuries CE10 which later Tibetan exegetes collectively refer to as “completion stage” practices. Such practices are distinguished by Tibetans from those of the Father tantras, where the emphasis is on male deities, images, and symbols, and the associated practices of “development stage,” or deity yoga, in which one imaginatively recreates self and environment in the form of a central male deity and his celestial domain. In contrast, the Yoginī or “female practitioner” tantras are said to emphasize more the special efficacy of female deities, principles and symbols. These tantras likewise promote yogic techniques—the “completion phase” practices of Tibetan parlance—involving highly choreographed manipulations of the energy channels, winds and seminal fluids that constitute the human body’s subtle physiology. Such practices center on the controlled arousal and movement of winds and fluids throughout the subtle body by means of sexual union with a real or imagined female practitioner or deity. Other salient features of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" the Yoginītantras include imagery related to Indian charnel grounds and the profusion of fierce male (heruka) and female (yoginīs and ḍākinīs) divinities believed to cavort there; the ritual preparation, exchange and consumption of “polluting” substances such as bodily fluids and fleshes; an emphasis on the intimate connection and correlation between language, cosmos and subtle physiology; and a considerable degree of language and imagery shared with Hindu Śaiva tantric traditions, particularly the Kāpālikas.11 For Indian and Tibetan commentators of Yoginītantras the term yoginī not only denotes the overtly sexual nature of the practices these texts prescribe; it also connotes the power and efficacy of contact with the feminine in all its human and divine forms. Yet, alongside the profusion of elements that might reflect a non-monastic origin or audience, the Yoginītantras also often assume knowledge of traditional Buddhist topics of learning like the dharmas of the Abhidharma, the ordination status of the various lay and monastic vow holders as stipulated in the Vinaya, and understandings of self, mind and world drawn from Middle-way and Mind-only formulations. The Hevajratantra and the Cakrasaṃvaratantra, the two most well known and widely practiced Yoginītantras, exhibit well this hybrid combination of characteristics. Due to the social, political and economic fragmentation that followed the collapse of the Tibetan empire in 840-42 CE, Tibetans were unable to begin translating the Yoginītantras until over a century later, toward the end of the 10th century, when Tibetans once again resumed their large-scale importation of Indian Buddhist texts and traditions. This renewed interest in Indian Buddhism among Tibetans, a movement which has recently come to be called the “Tibetan Buddhist renaissance,”12 was characterized foremost by the rise of an elite class of Tibetan scholars specially trained in the daunting task of translating and interpreting the developments in Indian Buddhist theory and practice which had transpired in the intervening century. From the inception of this period the new class of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" translator-scholars was thrust into the limelight and enjoyed the status of aristocracy. Drokmi the translator appears to have been an especially important figure within this new ecclesiastical network. Ronald Davidson’s 2005 study entitled Tibetan Renaissance: Tantric Buddhism in the Rebirth of Tibetan Culture, which explores the major socio-religious figures and themes of this important period in Tibetan history, devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 5: “Drogmi: The Doyen of Central Tibetan Translators:” 161-209) to the life and career of Drokmi, including his relationship with the Indian scholar Gayādhara. I refer the reader to this chapter for a detailed discussion and analysis of Drokmi’s and Gayādhara’s lives and influence. Here it suffices to note that Tibetan historical records depict Drokmi as having been especially steeped in Yoginītantra traditions. Drokmi receives credit, along with Gayādhara, for having produced authoritative translations of some of the most influential Yoginītantras to circulate in Tibet, most notably, the seminal texts of the Hevajratantra system of practice and exegesis.13 Drokmi is also described as having produced, again together with Gayādhara, a translation of the famous Root Text of Mārgaphala (Path and Fruit), which would later become a core feature of the institutional identity of the Tibetan Sakya tradition. The process by which the first few generations of Sakya hierarchs integrated the laconic Root Text of Mārgaphala with the Hevajratantra ritual system to craft a powerfully influential sectarian identity forms the subject matter of much of Davidson’s 2005 study. Further readings on the rubric and contents of Buddhist Yoginītantras include Gray (2007), Isaacson (1998), Sanderson, (1995a, 1995b and 2001) and Snellgrove (1959 and 1987). A brief review of the structure and content of The Glorious King of Tantras That Resolves All Secrets reveals the presence of several Yoginītantra traits. The tantra is organized according to a dialogue between the Buddha and Vajragarbha, who is the lead interlocutor of the Buddha’s entourage throughout many of the Yoginītantras, such as the Hevajratantra, and others. After a"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" brief opening narrative frame common to the Yoginītantras, Vajragarbha poses a series of four questions about each of the four major terms of the tantra’s title: secret, resolution, tantra, and king. The Buddha offers responses, which in turn elicit further questions. Vajragarbha’s opening four questions structure the body of the text as a whole, while his follow-up questions tend to open sub-topics for further discussion. The following outline, which I have extracted in accordance with Vajragarbha’s questions, reveals the tantra’s thematic flow. Folio numbers correspond to the Degé witness.

While the tantra is located in each of these Kangyurs within the second bibliographic subdivision of the “collected tantras” section, among the penultimate Yoginītantras, the location of the “collected tantras” section varies somewhat between collections. The present translation is based primarily on the Degé edition, in consultation also with the six other available witnesses.

The Blessed One dwelt in equanimity in the womb of the Vajra Lady, which is the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas. Then, the entourage, including bodhisattva Vajragarbha and others performed three circumambulations counter clockwise, made outer, inner, and secret offerings, and asked the following: O Blessed Vajra Holder! What is “secret”? How is it resolved? What is the meaning of tantra? And what is its king? The First Secret The Blessed One said: “Secret” is four-fold. First is the practice of the development stage"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 Related to the vase initiation. I taught meditation on the support and the supported So that practitioners might relinquish Dualistic concepts of a universe and inhabitants. Its individual features all have an intended meaning. Firstly, in other tantras, I taught about emptiness and so forth. Among the particulars of the support and supported, The first concerns the intention behind the support. Imagine that, like one candle lighting another, The syllable hūṃ at the heart Projects a black-hued e, Which forms a vast, deep triangle. The three corners are enlightened body, speech, and mind. This signifies the destruction of the three poisons. The sides are the three liberations. This signifies the destruction of the ten non-virtues That emerge from ordinary body, speech, and mind. The dharma body is immaculate, And therefore [F.187.b] naturally all-pervading. This is the significance of vast. Since even the noble listeners, solitary realizers, And bodhisattvas as well, Do not realize the dharma body, It is explained with intention as deep. Then, again the hūṁ at the heart Projects a hūṁ syllable that forms into a vajra, Which forms into a vajra tent. There are two obstacles: first, to life,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"3 And second, to liberation. These are the two obstructing forces, The outer and the inner. The outer creates obstacles to life. The inner creates obstacles to liberation. The significance of the vajra tent Is that it protects from the two-fold obstructions. Then yaṁ, just as before, Projects a shape, like a half-moon. It provides control over the abandonment of conceptuality And the dawn of non-conceptuality. This is the meaning of domination. Concerning the significance of the four flags, I have taught that it signifies all things Present throughout the three times. The triangular fire maṇḍala from raṁ Signifies wrathful ritual. The three-pronged vajra signifies the three buddha bodies. The round water disk from baṁ Is said to be the cessation of mental activity. The vase is the four aspects of the dharma body. The square golden earth from laṁ Has the nature of prosperity. The five-pronged vajra is the five gnoses. The eight peaks of Mount Meru above that Signify the eight liberations. Symbolizing the absence of conceptuality about an ordinary universe and inhabitants, The eight charnel grounds Should be arranged to left and right in order."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 The concepts related to each feature, moreover, Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions. Symbolizing the power of the antidote fully developed, Trees are continuously arranged in sequence. The directional protectors are arranged as symbols For the overcoming of concepts oriented toward the ten non-virtues. The eight nāgas are stationed To destroy the wicked ones Of attachment, hatred and ignorance. Rain clouds are arrayed So that body and speech16 may act for the welfare of17 beings, With divine pride in the two form buddha bodies Endowed with great compassion. [F.188.a] Inner and secret are the same. Likewise, as for the ultimate, the fourth, One should learn the oral tradition. Then, inside, the celestial palace appears. Bhruṁ creates an eight-spoked wheel. The eight spokes stand for the eight consciousnesses. The wheel transforms into the body of Vairocana. Viewed from the outside, he is luminous inside. Likewise, from inside out, Meaning that all appears as one. The five kinds of gems18 symbolize the five buddha bodies. The five colors indicate the five families. The four corners are said to be the four pure abodes. The four sides are the four means of magnetizing. The four gates are the four foundations of mindfulness."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"5 The eight pillars are the eight liberations. The four beams symbolize the four gnoses. All the gate adornments and so forth, Are said to be the powers and the like. Then, as for the seats inside the palace, They are lotuses born from vowels as seed-syllables. The lotus seat indicates not being stained By the afflictions such as passion, etc. The sun and moon atop the lotuses Symbolize skillful means and wisdom. The corpse is taught first For the destruction of the self, or conceptuality. The four-featured seat of the central deity Is given as a seat to each member of the retinue, Since they each are an aspect of the central deity. That completes the supportive maṇḍala Conjoined with its intended meaning. Next, the deities are generated According to the four types of birth. The miraculous manner is to arise instantaneously, Like a fish jumping out of water. Birth from heat and moisture is to arise from conditions, Like a lotus nurtured by the sun. Birth from an egg happens through projection and absorption, Like copper produced from stone. Birth from a womb occurs from union, Burned from above and formed from below, Like a statue created from wax.19"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 Vairocana is completed with the palace. Later, the Heruka is generated. Conferring initiation is the Blessed One Akṣobhya. Praise is Ratnasambhava. Offering is Amoghasiddhi. Tasting ambrosia is Amitabha. [F.188.b] The accomplishments that emerge From these six aspects are extraordinary. Then, concerning the recitation, or meditation, There are those of superior, mediocre and inferior faculties. It is said that superior ones Are to meditate, or recite in full. The mediocre should focus on the central deity in father-mother union. The inferior are to apply themselves to the eyes of the central figure. Having reached stability on the eyes of the central figure, They are to meditate on the thirty-seven features in full. The mediocre are to do likewise. Located in the body are channels; circulating within them are winds; Mounted on these is the mind—the inferior practice involves shape; The more profound involve mantra and seminal drops; And the ultimate involves dharma and the seven parts. Teaching this way is exceedingly profound. Everything taught above Should also be understood as four-fold. Each one, moreover, is four-fold; The manifold manner is exceedingly profound. Outer and inner is the meaning of mantra."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"7 The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning. Regarding the outer is the inner. The secrecy of just that is the secret meaning. Proficiency is the meaning of perfection. The maṇḍala image is the outer meaning. Inwardly, concerning the characteristics of the maṇḍala, The aggregates, elements, and sense media Are each transformed into a deity, either five, six, or thirty-seven; Left, right, above, below, the gates, and so forth— These should be understood from a master’s oral instructions. Then Vajragarbha asked: What is the completion Of the “thirty-seven”? How are they “developed”? What are their stages? What is the supportive maṇḍala like? And how are the sessions and breaks? How are view and conduct united? Tell me, O Spiritual Hero! The Blessed One said: The thirty-seven, the pristine cause, Gives rise to non-dual gnosis, the effect. Therefore, the cause, which precedes the effect, Is to become the principal deity. Even in just becoming the Heruka All causes are complete; The twenty-four locations and so forth Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions. The effect does not come from a mistaken cause—"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 Barley does not sprout from a grain of wheat. [F.189.a] Nor does it come from an incomplete cause— There is no sprout from damaged grain; Nor without a cause, Like fragrance from a space flower. The cause is not a cause without conditions, Like a forest fire without wind. The beginner thus endowed with these four parts Will abandon concepts. “Development” is said to be done By one who adheres to deity practice. Multiple aspects, external and internal, Are explained as its stages. The particular supportive maṇḍala, Is said to be of three types— Without courtyard, without canopy, and with canopy— According to inclination. Due to the divisions of the four chakras, Daily sessions are taught as four.20 Breaks should also be understood to be four. It is taught that a practitioner who switches To twenty-two and a half minute hours and meditates in eight sessions Equalizes sessions and breaks. During breaks, practitioners Of mediocre and inferior faculties Should project the deities in full And properly perform offerings, and so forth, Like one candle igniting another. “View” refers to equipoise; Subsequent attainment is explained as conduct."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"9 When practicing the development stage, One is permitted to observe the conduct of wearing the six adornments. In connection with the secret initiation, One is allowed to observe the conduct of adornments and ambrosia. I have said that those of the vajra family, the ratna family, The padma family and the karma family are permitted to observe the conduct. Those connected with the wisdom-gnosis initiation Have in common what was taught above, and In particular, are permitted to observe the conduct of the seal. With either conduct devoid of view, Or view devoid of conduct, One transgresses the pledges of secret mantra And takes birth as a hell-being in Endless Torment. Therefore, conduct devoid of view should be abandoned; It is the conduct of a hostile demon. Likewise, view devoid of conduct is also to be abandoned; Tormenting the body through austerities [F.189.b] And despising the aggregates that are Vairocana and so forth Is simply the work of a dry intellectual. Consequently, view and conduct are to be unified— When an elephant rises it rises all together, And when an elephant sits it sits all together. Vajragarbha then asked: What is meant by “ambrosia”? What conduct is associated with it? How do its qualities emerge? Tell me, O Central Deity,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 All the meanings of the adornments and the rest! The Blessed One said: Ambrosia is taught as three-fold. Firstly, one enjoys the outer ambrosia. Arrange the five hooks In the five ambrosias and the five meats. This should begin on the eighth and fourteenth days of the month. One should then gather silha wood, Akṣobhya, and dry manure. This should begin on the twelfth and sixteenth days of the month. One should then take Heruka, Vairocana, and essence of dry manure. The eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days Of the waxing and waning lunar periods Are taught as auspicious times for everything. The appearance of the lion should be white and excellent, Its body and speech gentle and without any fault— This is the basis for the formation of flesh. As for ox, or elephant, This should be the flesh of one from which musk and the like emerges Based on the single material cause of it eating a ketaka flower. Beef should be flesh that contains bile. Horse meat should come from the king among horses, Whose complexion is neither white nor red, With flesh that neither changes shape nor color. Human meat must be the flesh of a seventh-birth. An adept should investigate his body, speech, and mind. The food container should be a skull-cup in a single piece. The ambrosia should be accomplished with the ingredients inside it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"11 Superior, mediocre, and inferior signs— Blazing, wafting, and bubbling— Are explained as pertaining to the external signs. Furthermore, the point of signs having arisen is that old age is eradicated. If sounds have not been heard there will be no accomplishment. When sounds have issued forth one will become pure. Inner ambrosia is self-arisen. Having interrupted the flow of ambrosia dripping From the nine orifices of the one with the bell, It fills the body like sesame seeds. Then, as the breath enters the avadhūtī The circulation of the upper sixth is elicited. When silha and camphor abide in the center, [F.190.a] The lower sixth circulates. This is the secret ambrosia, Which vanquishes grey hair, wrinkles, and death. The practice of conduct is two-fold: For superior and beginner persons. The ambrosia of the outer sixth is bestowed In order for them to adhere well to the development stage And abandon fixation to caste."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 Beginners have both outer and inner ambrosias, Whose potencies are also manifold— It renders them devoid of grey hair and destroys conceptuality. It consecrates the four maṇḍalas. It is taught that one will seize the sixth Which is situated at the center, Four finger-widths above the upper tip of the relative, Through gaining familiarity with the fifth. Settling the breath at the location of the navel, The upper sixth is seized. Its potencies are also manifold. One will be devoid of craving and feel buoyant. Just like an eagle, One will soar in the sky without plummeting. It is said that the lower sixth is situated At the center of the superior and disconnected ones. It is taught to superior persons And its potencies are also manifold. It blocks the orifice of the one with the bell. It destroys anger, the first of the adornments. The stage of subjugating Rudra In the great charnel ground of Śītavana Is that conceptuality is destroyed with ambrosia. The four enlightened activities are in common. Through the seal, desire is purified. Vajragarbha then asked: What is meant by “the sixth”? What is a superior person like? How is desire purified? Tell me, O Spiritual Hero! "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"13 The Blessed One replied: From the four of right, left, above and below, Emerges space, the fifth. The fifth’s absence of nature Is taught to be “the sixth.” Preceded by joy, supreme joy, Innate joy, and the freedom from joy, Great bliss, the fifth, emerges. Great bliss being pure, devoid of nature, Is the sixth, pertaining to the lower door. Therefore, even those who aspire for the sixth [F.190.b] Meditate on the complete fifth, Preceded by the fourth. For example, when the power of alchemy Is applied to a copper object, The copper itself becomes gold, And the gold itself comes from just copper. Likewise, the Buddha does not teach That the sixth appears from anything but the fifth. Throughout a year, month, fortnight, A day, night, and hour, The sixth emerges for only a moment. It is not the purview of beginners. In the same way, a drop of ambrosia Placed in a vessel of water Is only experienced as water. The ambrosia is not experienced. Still, based on water, The ambrosia is also caused to be experienced.

An adept should determine all of them As being inside or outside of the spinal column. There are also two types of chakra. First are the chakras themselves; second the channels.

One hundred and twenty internal channels Are located in the fat and give rise to marrow. Thirty-two secret channels Are located in the bones and give rise to camphor. The three suchness channels Are located in the secret place and give rise to bliss. There are seventy-two thousand houses. Each house has a hundred thousand further houses. The types of worms21 present in those houses Are seventy-two thousand and their number Should likewise be understood as multiplied by a hundred thousand.

With the triad of day, night, and twilight These should be understood by the adept as nine. The camphor located in those channels Is the ambrosia emergent from union.

The hooks transform into the five ambrosias. The karmic winds fan the flames, Which melts the moon, the central deity, and so forth— This is ordinary ambrosia. The three letters and the sun melt— This is called “divine ambrosia.” That which is summoned by light rays I have taught to be wisdom ambrosia. Circumambulating three times, enlightened body, speech, and mind, Is the practice of blessing. Tasting and offering the ambrosia Is taught to be the “practice of offering.” Then comes the practice of play [F.192.b] Which should be understood to mean the right and left.

The enjoyment chakra is absorbed within the dharma chakra. As for the sequence of absorption above, Everything fuses into a seminal drop. This is like how a single sun Shines throughout the ten directions, Yet its profusion of rays is fused with it. It is also like the parasol of a universal monarch, Which is an assembly of wooden machinery. Moreover, once absorbed into the dharma chakra at the heart, [F.193.a] In the center of the sun and moon disc, the size of a chick pea, Is a seminal drop, the size of a mustard seed. Around this, on the left and right, Is a mantra garland as fine as a strand of hair. The vowels and consonants enwrap the drop like a snake. Those are the practice of the seminal drop.

The anus quivers and the body hairs rise. Twelve non-observations of the basic character of joy Is taught to be its nature. With the circulation of the spirit of enlightenment, one reflects on non-conceptuality. Twenty-five non-observations of supreme joy Completely fills the secret gem. The non-observation of innate joy Is taught to be the dharma body. The interruption of the flow of bliss is the joy of cessation; Its non-observation is the two form buddha bodies. Moreover, all the preliminaries, The subsidiary techniques, and actual union, Along with their intention, are in stages.

The three buddha bodies and the five gnoses Are radiated as the features of the fruition. The causes are absorbed within seven And the fruitions are absorbed within three. The causes dissolve into the fruitions, and The fruition should be meditated upon as two-fold. All phenomena are the essence of mind. Mind is of an empty nature. All is of one taste in being empty. This is the expanse devoid of accepting and rejecting. In order to fully purify desire, Desire rooted in the five seals of enlightened body— The pair of the great seal and the gnosis seal, Along with the samaya seal, the dharma seal and the action seal— Becomes exceedingly profound. This is great bliss, which is three-fold— The natures of development and completion, And the chakra of great bliss. The first abides as the letter e at the secret nose-tip.

The natural chakra of great bliss Is replete with the flavor of22 great bliss, Just as a sesame seed is with sesame butter. Like sap dripping From a cut tree branch, From that great bliss itself comes the Form of hundreds, thousands, Tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands of tips of hair. First comes a cloudy form; The second resembles smoke. Third is the form of lightning; The fourth resembles a butter lamp. The sequence of all these, moreover, Occurs according to the order of the emanation chakra and the rest. The emergence of the form of cloud Is the sign for birth, the syllable a. That which resembles a butter lamp Is taught to be the sign of haṁ, for23 death. The fifth, which resembles space, Should be understood as the empty sign For the intermediate state, non-duality. Moreover, [F.194.a] vibrating and so forth Should be learned from a master’s oral instructions. Next, concerning the third secret, The characteristics of the four joys In connection with the wisdom-gnosis initiation are as follows: The anus quivering, body hairs rising, And the body vibrating are the essence of joy.

Moreover, the characteristics of all these, Such as the factor of the spirit of enlightenment, and so forth, Should be understood in terms of what was taught above. Joy is called “luminance;” Supreme joy is radiance. Extreme joy is imminence. Innate joy is clear light. The nature of the four gnoses Are the antidotes that destroy the four demons. The coarse level is secretly destroyed by four. The four subtle demons are naturally Destroyed in the four chakras. The four joys based on the chakras Themselves appear as the four gnoses, And therefore destroy the four demons. The three poisons based on desire Are the demon of afflictions, Involving twelve attributes of desire. The Secret Guardian of Bliss destroys the afflictions.

The four concealed things are the demon of the gods."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 The chakra of awareness destroys the demon of the gods.

[F.194.b] It is due to the particularities of concepts And, furthermore, the particularities of inclinations And the particularities of various religious systems, That such a plethora has been taught. A practitioner who has traversed the three initiations Is taught to be a great, fully ordained monk. For it is taught that he24 will accomplish all. Vajragarbha then asked: What is such a triple-initiation fully ordained monk like? What are his activities? The Blessed One said: Fully ordained monks, and so forth, are three-fold: Individual liberation, bodhisattva, And knowledge-holder fully ordained monks.

Concerning the particular three great ones, By being in service to the virtue of the vase initiation, One is in the service of virtue, a permanent lay-vow holder. Therefore, with seven, they are great. One who is in accordance with the virtue of the secret initiation Is in harmony with virtue, a novice. With seven, they become great. By upholding that very virtue of wisdom-gnosis, One is an upholder of virtue, a fully ordained monk. With seven, they are great. These particular three great ones Are also the three non-returners, In that reverting back to karmic maturation, cyclic existence, and the lower vehicle— The three abandonments—are renounced by the three vehicles, respectively, And those of the knowledge-holder vehicle adhere to the fruition.

I have not taught that one should perform secret conduct [F.195.a] In the apparel of all three vehicles. For example, copper is wrought from stone. Based on copper, one can enjoy the appearance of gold. When there is copper, there is no stone. By becoming golden, stone no longer appears.

Here one should meditate, having overcome This perpetually shifting mind itself, As well as its attendant objects of meditation— The forms and so forth that it latches onto. Having fully relinquished all reference points Of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects, Since the nature of mind is inconceivable, One should not think of anything whatsoever. When the nature of mind is submerged within the empty, And the empty is well-submerged within the mind, Concepts of empty, not empty, and so forth, Are destroyed, leaving the mind like the sky. There does not exist a support, there is nothing supported. Even the matchless state does not exist. The perfected presence of precisely that Is innate non-dual awareness.

If one enters the outer, inner, concealed, And ultimate maṇḍalas and obtains initiation, One must meditate, recite, and so forth, Lest one might obstruct and denigrate the secret mantra. Disparaging any spiritual practice, Ridiculing26 vajra siblings, disciples27 with shared tantric commitments, Breaking the root and branch samaya vows, Cursing the lama—by the fruition of these One will be born as a hell-being in Endless Torment.

The meaning of tantra is threefold. The chakra of great bliss is the causal tantra; The secret nose-tip is the means tantra; The Secret Guardian of Bliss is the fruitional tantra. The vase is taught to be the causal tantra; The secret is the means tantra; The wisdom-gnosis is the fruitional tantra. Birth is taught to be the causal tantra. Death is taught to be the means tantra. The intermediate state is the fruitional tantra. “Tantra” means continuum; Its king, which teaches secrets, Has taught secrets as four-fold.

For more on the notion of “grey texts,” see Davidson (2000), pp. 202-224. 2 The textual record is inconsistent with regard to Drokmi’s precise birth and death dates. Gene Smith’s Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center records his birth at 992/993 and his death at 1043?/1072?. Very little information appears to exist with regard to Gayādhara’s precise dates. 3 Gö lotsāwa Zhönupal (’gos lo tsa ba gzhon nu dpal ), p. 207. 4 For more on the Tibetan classification schemes for Indian tantric literature translated between the 10th through the 12th centuries see Gibson (1997), Snellgrove (1988), and more recently, Dalton (2005). 5 New translation schools usually cite the Guhyasamājatantra as the paradigmatic example of the Father class of tantras. 6 The Kālacakratantra is most often cited as the paradigmatic Non-dual tantra, although the nature and boundaries of this category has been a controversial topic among Tibetan exegetes. 7 Gray (2007, p. 5, fn. 10) states that the category “highest yoga tantra,” which translates “anuttarayoga-tantra,” is attested to in Tibetan translations of Indian Buddhist tantric literature like the Vajrapañjara and its commentaries. Moreover, Christian Wedemeyer in a personal correspondence has mentioned that “annuttarayoga-tantra” never appears in the Sanskrit literature, only “yoganiruttara.” 8 rgyud ’bum . 9 phyogs bcu mun sel (see bibliography), f. 479.

This is because Old School adherents claim that the tantras otherwise known as 10 These dates are advanced by Isaacson (1998). 11 Alexis Sanderson’s work has been particularly focused on the fluidity between Buddhist and Śaiva tantric textual traditions.
