[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IntroductionI.1Destroyer of the Great trichiliocosm is the first scripture in a series of five; the other four texts are The Great Peahen, Queen of Incantations (Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī, Toh 559), The Noble Great Amulet, Queen of Incantations(Mahāpratisāravidyārājñī, Toh 561), The Sūtra of Great Cool Grove, (Mahāśītavana, Toh 562), and Upholding the Great Secret Mantra(Mahāmantrānudhāra iṇ, Toh 563).1 Together these scriptures have been apotheosized in the Mahāyāna tradition as five goddesses known collectively as the Pañcarak ā, or the “Five Protectresses.” In the Tibetan tradition this collection is ṣknown by the moniker gzungs chen grwa lnga, “The Fivefold Great Dhāra ī.” In ṇthe Degé Kangyur collection these texts constitute 49, 60, 43, 25, and 12 folios respectively, making a total of 189 folios.I.2Tibetan redactors of Kangyur collections have catalogued this set of five texts together within the final Action (kriyā) tantras section of the “tantra collection” (rgyud ’bum) division. Indeed, these scriptures do contain elements—powerful incantations, an emphasis on external ritual hygiene and other material details such as auspicious dates, and so forth—that resonate with standard Krīyayoga practice as understood in Tibet. Yet missing from nearly all these texts is any extensive mention of the contemplative visualization exercises, specialized ritual gestures (mudrā), elaborate ma ala diagrams, and initiation ceremonies so ṇḍtypical of full-blown Buddhist tantra. A close perusal of these five texts might then lead the reader to construe them as standard Mahāyāna texts with a preponderanceof elements—magical mantra formulas, ritual prescriptions, pragmatic aims, and soforth—that only later coalesced and developed into a typically tantric practice tradition with its own unique set of view, meditation, and conduct. To complicate things further, the core of the Mahāmāyūrī, for one, is rooted in Indian Buddhist traditions that predate even the rise of Mahāyāna.2 The Mahāmāyūrī also appears as a remedy for snakebites in the earlier Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinayavastu.3 This accords with Gregory Schopen’s general observation, based on inscriptional evidence, that “dhāra ī texts were publically known much earlier and more widely ṇthan texts we think of as ‘classically’ Mahāyāna”.4I.3Regardless of their bibliographical position in the Tibetan canon, the Five Protectresses have been among the most popular texts used for pragmatic purposesthroughout the Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna Buddhist world. While it seems certain that these texts each developed independently and were only later combined into a five-text corpus, their popularity is attested by their eventual spread to Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia, China, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia (Hidas 2007: 189). In"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"East Asia, the textual tradition associated with the Mahāmāyūrī in particular was instrumental in integrating Buddhist and indigenous notions of divine kingship.5Moreover, the tradition of all five goddesses and their texts still occupies a place of central importance today in the Vajrayāna Buddhism practiced by the Newar population of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Newar Buddhist communitiesof Kathmandu have even translated the texts of the Five Protectresses into the modern vernacular, based on which they continue to stage a number of annual ritesfor a broad range of pragmatic purposes.6 Newars often propitiate the Five Protectresses together by means of a five-section ma ala and other tantric ṇḍelements that do not necessarily feature in the scriptures themselves. This tradition reflects a specifically tantric ritual treatment of the texts, which, judging by the presence of tantricsādhana practices associated with these five texts in the Tibetan Tengyur collections, had already developed by the time the Tibetan translations were executed. This helps account for why Tibetan redactors construed these five texts as belonging to the category of Krīyatantra, and not to the Dhāra ī or Sūtra ṇsections. Indeed, the Tibetan translation of the Mahāpratisarā reflects a recension of the Sanskrit text, which, Gergely Hidas suggests, “most likely served the better integration of this text into the Vajrayāna, changing the historical locus of the nidāna to a mythical Vajrayānic setting.”7I.4The designation Five Protectresses denotes the set of five texts, the incantations presented therein, and the goddesses presiding over each. It is believed that all these texts, particularly their incantations, provide special protection against a widerange of illnesses and misfortunes for those who memorize, recollect, read, copy, teach, wear, or otherwise come into contact with them. Each text promises protection against specific misfortunes, with considerable overlap witnessed between the texts. Despite the pragmatic thrust of these scriptures, each text also contains numerous allusions to doctrinal notions. The range of effects described therein sometimes, though rarely, extends beyond the pragmatic sphere to include the purification of negative karma, deliverance from the lower realms, and even the attainment of buddhahood.I.5Destroyer of the Great trichiliocosm was translated into Tibetan under Tibetan imperial patronage sometime during the early ninth century by a translation team that included the translator-editor Bandé Yeshé Dé (ca. late eighth to early ninth centuries) and the Indian scholars Śīlendrabodhi, Jñānasiddhi, and Śākyaprabha. The Degé edition, which forms the basis of this English translation, was re-edited several centuries later by Gö Lotsāwa Zhönnu Pal (’gos lo tsā ba gzhon nu dpal, 1392–1481), based on a Sanskrit edition that had been in the possession of Chojé Chaglo (chag lo tsā ba chos rje dpal, 1197–1263/64)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I.6The text primarily addresses illnesses caused by spirit entities, collectively referred to as graha or bhūta throughout the text, which are thought to devour the vitality ofmen, women, children, and animals. The text describes these graha or bhūta as belonging to four different subspecies of beings, each of which is presided over by one of the four great kings, guardians of the world, who hold spiritual sovereignty over the territories and resident spirit beings present throughout the four cardinal directions. According to the cosmology presented in the text, the great king Kubera (who is also called Vaiśrava aṇ in some passages) dwells in the north, where he presides over the yak a variety of graha. The great ṣking Dh tarā ra ṛṣṭ dwells in the east, where he reigns over the gandharva grahas. The great king Virū hakaḍrules in the south, where his entourage consists of kumbhā a grahas. And the great kingṇḍ Virūpāk aṣ reigns in the west, where his entourage is nāga grahas. Each group of grahas, moreover, is responsible for a particular category of illness, with its own unique set of physical symptoms.I.7The narrative of this sūtra revolves around Buddha Śākyamuni’s gradual dispensation of a series of incantations and rituals centered upon formulas intended to prevent violent grahas from striking, or to heal those already afflicted. These prescriptions unfold in the context of the Buddha’s conversations with the four great kings and the god Brahmā about their mutual concern to control the grahas after their boundless greed has plagued Vaiśālī and its Licchavi people with a natural disaster and an epidemic of cosmic proportions. The text also includes ritual prescriptions for the monastic community to purify their consumption of alms tainted by the “five impure foods.” This refers generally to alms that contain meat, the consumption of which is expressly prohibited for successful implementation of the dhāra ī incantations. In this final section of the text all five ṇProtectresses are mentioned, suggesting that Destroyer of the Great trichiliocosm emerged only after the other four scriptures of the group, despite its position as first in the collection.I.8This English translation is based primarily on the Degé edition, with close consultation of Yutaka Iwamoto’s (1937) edited Sanskrit edition, as obtained electronically through GRETIL: Göttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages. When encountering variant readings between Tibetan and Sanskrit editions, we tended to select the Tibetan Degé readings and note the variations. This choice was made based on the profusion of variant Sanskrit witnesses that postdate the ninth-century Tibetan translation, and our own ignorance of the witnesses and criteria employed in the creation of Iwamoto’s edited Sanskrit edition."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE TRANSLATIONThe SūtraDestroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm1.1[F.63.b] I pay homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!1.2Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in Rājag haṛ, on the southern slope of Vulture Peak Mountain in the luminous grove of jewel trees, the domain of the Buddha, together with a large monastic assembly of 1,250 monks. This assembly included venerable Śāriputra, venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, venerableMahākāśyapa, venerable Gayākāśyapa, venerable Nadīkāśyapa, venerableĀjñātakau inyaṇḍ, venerable Nandika, venerable Mahākātyāyana, venerable Bakkula, venerable Vā pa ṣ, venerable Ko hila ṣṭ, venerable Vāgīśa, venerable Aśvajit, venerableSubhūti, venerable Suvāhu, venerable Aniruddha, venerable Uruvilvākāśyapa, venerable Revata, and venerable Ānanda, among others.1.3At that time, the Blessed One and his monastic assembly were venerated, revered, honored, and worshipped by Ajātaśatru, king of Magadha, son of Vaidehī, who offered them clothes, food, bedding, medicine, and other material necessities. Just then, the earth shook tremendously, a massive cloud formation appeared, there wasan untimely wind, strong hail began to fall, and a heavy rain fell from the massive cloud. Thunder roared and lightning flashed. Chaos erupted throughout the ten directions. A thick darkness then settled, such that the stars disappeared and even the sun and moon were dimmed. [F.64.a] No longer gleaming and luminous, they ceased to shine.1.4With his pristine, divine vision, superior to that of humans, the Blessed One saw those frightening things occur in the city of Vaiśālī. He saw that villages belonging to certain Licchavi people of Vaiśālī were afflicted with elemental spirits. He saw that some of the village youth, astrologers, councilors, prime ministers, court members, servant men and women, laborers, messengers, and attendants were alsoafflicted with elemental spirits. He saw that the monks and nuns and the men and women with lay vows throughout the entire land of Vaiśālī were all frightened, looking up to the sky, and crying out in horror. They paid homage to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sa gha. He saw that from among the brahmins and ṅ"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"householders without particular devotion toward the Buddha’s teachings, some paid homage to Brahmā; some paid homage to Śakra; some paid homage to the guardians of the world; and still others paid homage to Maheśvara, Mā ibhadra ṇ, Pūrnabhadra, Hārītī, the sun, the moon, the planets, the stars, or those spirits that dwell in mountains, forests, thickets, trees, rivers, fountains, ponds, pools, wells, and reliquaries. He saw that everyone was sitting and wondering, “How can we be freed from the peril of such a calamity?”1.5The Blessed One then manifested a miraculous feat by which a sound was heard throughout all realms of the trichiliocosm, causing the world of gods, humans, and demigods to have faith and assemble. [F.64.b]1.6At that point, Brahmā, master of the world; the gods of the Brahma realm; Śakra, lord of the gods; the gods of the realm of the Thirty-Three; the four great kings and the gods of their realm; the twenty-eight yak a generals; the thirty-two great yak a ṣṣwarriors; and Hārītī with her sons, together with their retinues, all with sublime complexions, used their respective complexions and powers to bathe Vulture Peak Mountain in bright light, like a pristine dawn once the night has passed. Approaching the Blessed One, they bowed their heads to his feet, sat to one side, then praised the Blessed One in verses of unified phrasing, cadence, and meter:1.7“You shine with the luster of burnished gold,Like the light of the full moon.As stable as Vaiśrava aṇ,You are the source of all jewels.1.8Lion-Like One, with your elephant-like gait,You advance like an elephant in rut.You are like a golden mountain,Or an ornament made of gold from the Jambu River.1.9Like the moon in a cloudless skyStudded with stars,You are adorned with sublime characteristicsIn the midst of a śrāvaka assembly.1.10This world with its gods"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Comes to the Sage for refuge.The time for safeguardingThe welfare of humans has neared!1.11This sūtra, Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm,Disclosed by the previous buddhas,Is the supreme boundary that seals the area,All the way to the ends of the surrounding mountains.1.12We pay homage to you, heroic being!We pay homage to you, supreme being!To the great Sage, king of Dharma,We pay homage with palms joined!”1.13The Blessed One remained silent for a moment, then said to the four great kings, “Great Kings! It would be improper to think that your assembly could harm my assembly. That is because [F.65.a] it is in this world of humans that the Buddha hasappeared, the sublime Dharma has been eloquently taught, and the Sa gha has ṅexcellently practiced it. The seed planted from this has yielded buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, arhats, and śrāvakas in the world. Based on generating the roots of virtue with respect to them, beings of the world are born into any of the thirty-two divine realms. And kings, moreover, with their four-division army, become cakra-ruling kings with dominion over the four continents. They exercise righteous rule over the entire earth all the way to the oceans. They also come to possess a thousand sons, valiant, courageous, handsome in all respects, with the impetuousness of the power of great champions, who vanquish opposing groups and take possession of the seven kinds of precious substances. Thus, you should worry little about such a thing happening in this world.”1.14Then, the great king Vaiśrava aṇ arose from his seat, draped his upper robe on one shoulder, and knelt on his right knee. Bowing to the Blessed One with palms joined,he said to him, “Blessed One, we have houses, abodes, and estates, including villages, gardens, mansions, apartments, and residences scented with incense censers and strewn with flowers, with porticos, archways, and small windows.

His mind was serene, his sense faculties were restrained, his mind was temperate, and he had attained the perfection of sublime tranquility. His sense faculties were isolated and withdrawn. He was as well trained as an elephant, and as lucid, limpid, and clear as a lake.

Looking throughout the four directions, he extended his golden arm, adjusted his upper garment, and said, “This queen of all incantations,Destroyer of the Great trichiliocosm, is a Dharma teaching that liberates from allgrahas. It is the seal of many buddhas, as many perfectly awakened, thus-gone arhats as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges.

He will not associate with bad companions. He will not encounter those who dwell in bad states.

[F.85.a] He will be worthy of veneration by all assemblies of bhūtas. If even the four great kings show their faces when one holds this sūtra,Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, how much more so will yak as, ṣrāk asas, and other ordinary beings? Why is that? It is because those who perform ṣincantations in the world for the sake of healing sentient beings render these secret mantra syllables supreme, principal, exalted, sublime, profound, vast, authentic, impenetrable, and unique—it is the seal of the Dharma.”1.378Then, Indra, The Thousand-Eyed One,King of the Gods, Śacipati,Paid homage with palms joined,And said to the Lord of the World:1.379“This incantation,Which benefits all worlds, was eloquently spoken.I will describe the incantation, the secret mantra,In conjunction with medicinal substances.1.380“Take śirī a ṣ flowers, the apāmārga plant,ka aka ṭ fruit, aloeswood,śaileya, e amañji hāḍṣṭ,sūkarī, marka īṭ, and jayā,1.381“Paripelava, rasa, vīrā,sāmaka, busā, tagara,sandalwood paste, costus root,nakha, kata leaves, marā,1.382“Priya gu,ṅ sp kkā ṛ, rocanā,31mustard seeds, red arsenic,cinnamon, vacā, saffron,And an unguent32 of asafetida mixed with leaves."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"1.383“Mixing these together and making them into an ointment33Delivers one from all harms.When it is rubbed on the eyesOf those afflicted with bhūtas,It delivers those seizedBy the vajra and thunderbolt arrows of bhūtas.1.384“When it is smeared on a large tree,Or on a large shrine,Then whoever sees that spotWill not be threatened by bhūtas, andBhūtas will not dwell there,Nor will any other harm doer.1.385“When it is appliedTo kettledrums, conch shells,clay drums, and small kettledrums,Then, wherever their sounds are heard,The circles of bhūtas will be frightened.

[F.86.a]1.398“Homage to you, heroic being!Homage to you, supreme being!”1.399Paying homage with palms joined,They vanished right there.1.400Then, at dusk, the Blessed One emerged from his meditative composure and said tothe monks,“Monks! Receive, hold, recite, teach, and master the sūtra called Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm! It will be for the long-term welfare, benefit, happiness, and comfort of the world with its gods!1.401“Monks! If any of my monks were to tie a cord to a barren tree with this sūtra,Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, then leaves, flowers, and fruits would grow on it. So it goes without saying what it can do for a body endowed with consciousness—unless, that is, the ripening of prior karma precludes it.”1.402When the Blessed One had spoken, the monks then asked him, “The five great sūtras taught by the Venerable Blessed One are Destroyer of the Great Trichiliocosm, Great Peahen, Great Cool Grove, Great Amulet, and Great Application of Secret Mantra. Venerable Blessed One, you have instructed that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"these sūtras should be upheld by those who refrain from the five kinds of impure food.34 You have also said that we should take ordination and live on alms. However, Blessed One, there are very few alms that are unmixed with the five kindsof impure food. In this way, since there are many more that are mixed with the five kinds of impure food, how, Venerable Blessed One, should we conduct ourselves in this regard?”1.403The Blessed One answered the monks, “Monks, it is precisely for this reason that, inorder to protect oneself, one who holds the sūtra Destroyer of the Greattrichiliocosm should also hold the Dhāra ī of the Unblemished Gem ṇ. In this way one should think of food as being agreeable when taking alms. [F.86.b] One should even consider food mixed with the five kinds of impure food as being unmixed with the five kinds of impure food. One should also consider all compounded phenomena as impermanent, impermanence as suffering, and suffering as selfless. Where are the five kinds of impure food? Who has the five kinds of impure food? Who eats the five kinds of impure food? No sentient being is perceived.1.404“If alms are adulterated with the five kinds of impure foods, one should protect oneself on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth lunar days. On those days, a girl of royal caste, who has been well cleansed, well adorned, and who has fasted for a day and taken the five precepts, should wind four red strings into a cord. Then, while the incantation is being recollected by a holder of the secret mantra, a knot should be tied in the cord. Next the cord should be cut with a new knife and burned. Then, the cord should be laid in a jewel or metal vessel filled with water, covered with flowers, and scented with various fragrances. This incantation should then be recited until the cord surfaces inside the vessel. The cord should then be tied to the wrist and the following should be recited:1.405“‘ Deceived by his priests,Śrīgupta made an offering35Of poisonous almsTo the protector, the Lion of the Śākyas.1.406“‘ Accepting it from him,The teacher removed the poison and ate the alms.Through these words of truth,May food be transformed into ambrosia!"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"1.407“‘ May Brahmā and Indra—Lord of the gods and sovereign over the realm of the Thirty-Three—The four guardians of the world,Mā ibhadra ṇ, Maheśvara,The rāk asīṣ Mahākālī,And likewise Ca a Ca ālinī—ṇḍṇḍ1.408“‘ All with fierce devotionFor Vipaśyin in his divinity,Śikhin, Viśvabhū,Krakucchanda,Powerful in his divinity,Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa,And the Lion of the Śākyas—1.409“‘ Accept these flowers, flagrances,And burnt offerings!1.410“‘ Thus satiated and revered, [F.87.a]May they purify my food!May they ensure that even food mixed with the five impure foodsIs unadulterated for me!1.411“‘ I will eat all the food,Even what is mixed with the five impure foods!1.412“‘ May all adulterated foodsFrom all the collections of seedsEnclosing the essential nutrients of the soilBe unadulterated for me!1.413“‘ Just as the cord, cut and burned,Was restored once more,May adulterated foods likewiseBe made unadulterated for me!"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"1.414syād yathedam khakhame khakha khakha khukhume śime śime śihume śime śimesvasti svasti svasti svasti mama śānte sārāgre |1.415“‘ Just as what is mixed with the five impure foodsIs eaten without being adulterated—Just like the burned cord—May this truth manifest!1.416syād yathedam kalake kalale balani karu a ālāye agne sa krāmane svāhāḍṃ |1.417“‘ I go for refuge to Buddha Vipaśyin, Śikhin,The Thus-Gone One Viśvabhū, Krakucchanda,Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa,And fearless Gautama!1.418“‘ I worship the bodies of those seven supreme humansWith flowers and fragrances!With body, speech, and devout mind,I go to them for refuge!1.419“‘ May the gods who have special devotionFor those buddhas replete with supernatural powersBe elated and joyous,And with devout minds protect me!’ ” 1.420At these words from the Blessed One, the monks rejoiced, and praised what the Blessed One had said."}]
