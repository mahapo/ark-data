[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IntroductionI.1Like most Buddhist tantras, the Ca amahāro a atantra ṇḍṣṇ (CMT) is regarded within the Vajrayāna tradition as a divinely revealed text, with its teachings delivered directly from the level of the sambhogakāya, that is, the bliss body of LordBuddha. In such tantras, the sambhogakāya deity who delivers the original discourse varies—it could be Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapā iṇ, or others. In this case, it is Lord Vajrasattva. The teaching itself takes the form of a dialogue between Vajrasattva and his consort. Lord Vajrasattva here assumes the identity of the deity Acala (Immovable One), which is another name for the deity of the title, Ca amahāro a a ṇḍṣṇ (Fierce Great Angry One). His consort is Vajradhātvīśvarī (Goddess of the vajra Realm).I.2As is the case with all tantras, the person who put the CMT into writing chose to remain anonymous in conformity with the tradition, which no doubt saw the authormerely as a medium for conveying this secret teaching. However, in the search for the earthly origin of this text, the circumstantial evidence seems to point to a Nepalese origin, most likely Newar. Of the more than one hundred extant manuscripts of the CMT, ranging in date from 1380 up to the twentieth century, all were written in Nepal, as were the only two known manuscripts of the CMT commentary, the Padmāvatī.I.3Although the tradition of this tantra and its title deity never became widespread or popular outside the Kathmandu Valley, it flowered and thrived for almost a millennium among Kathmandu’s Newar Buddhist community, leaving a rich legacy still evident today. There is at least one active shrine of Ca amahāro a a in the ṇḍṣṇKathmandu Valley; it is part of the sacred Hira yavar a Mahāvihāra complex in ṇṇPatan. Most shops that sell Buddhist art in Kathmandu offer a selection of Ca amahāro a a paintings, and the CMT is still being taught by Newari ṇḍṣṇBajracharyas—themselves part of its unbroken spiritual heritage—such as Yagnyaman Pati Bajracharya, who traces his family line back to the eighth-century Buddhist master Vilāsavajra.I.4The CMT appears to have drawn on a number of earlier scriptures, including theGuhyasamājatantra (Toh 442), the Hevajratantra (Toh 417), theSiddhaikavīratantra (Toh 544),1 and the Cittaviśuddhiprakara aṇ of Āryadeva (Toh 1804). In turn, it influenced other works, such as the Vidyādharavinodatantra.2However, among all the works devoted to the deity Ca amahāro a a ṇḍṣṇ, the CMT is unquestionably the most important. Other"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"works centered on this deity includesādhana, dhāra īṇ, and stotra compositions—allof them, as their genres might suggest, much shorter than the CMT.I.5One should note, however, that the CMT was not the first scripture to introduce its main deity. There is at least one earlier occurrence of the name Ca amahāro a a, ṇḍṣṇfound in the first chapter of the Siddhaikavīratantra as part of the mantra o ṁca amahāro a a hū phaṇḍṣṇṁṭ.3 Moreover, the deity himself seems to predate the name Ca amahāro a a. Under his other name,ṇḍṣṇ Acala, he has a tantra devoted to himself, the Acalakalpa. This is one of the core kriyātantras of the Tathāgatakulagroup, predating the CMT by a few or even several hundred years. The name Acala is also found in the Vairocanābhisambodhi 4 (Toh 494), oneof the two knownCaryātantra texts extant in Sanskrit.5 Although the cult of this deity under the name Ca amahāro a a was more or less confined to the ṇḍṣṇKathmandu valley, it spread farther afield under the name Acala, reaching as far as Japan, where the practice of Acala (“Fudō” in Japanese) became important in Shingon Buddhism.6I.6The text of the CMT exists in the original Sanskrit and in translations. Only parts of the Sanskrit text have been edited and published.7 Since no previous edition exists of the complete text, we had to reconstruct the Sanskrit text of the remaining chapters from manuscripts, revising the existing editions in the process. The resulting Sanskrit text of the complete tantra8 is a half-critical, half-diplomatic edition chiefly based on the oldest and the most correct of the CMT manuscripts.9The Tibetan canonical translation was the work of the translator Trakpa Gyaltsen (grags pa rgyal mtshan, 1148–1216) and the Indian scholar Ratnaśrī. It was completed at the monastery of Sakya (sa skya), in the year of the Snake, most likely1209.10 This date, therefore, sets the terminus ante quem for the composition of theCMT. This translation, which is the only one known to exist in Tibetan, is included in all the major editions of the Tibetan Kangyur.11I.7There are also two partial translations from recent years: an English translation by Christopher George12 and a German translation by Peter Gäng.13 George translated chapters 1–8, whereas Gäng translated the whole tantra except chapters 17–21, which he abridged into one short chapter. The translation presented here is therefore the first complete translation of this text since the Tibetan appeared. In general, it follows the Sanskrit edition, although it does at times incorporate the Tibetan; such instances are listed in the endnotes. However, as there are literally hundreds of minor differences between the Sanskrit and the Tibetan, not all"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"variations have been noted; only major discrepancies have been included.I.8The translation also attempts to reflect the exegesis found in the Padmāvatī, the only extant commentary on the CMT, which was written by one Mahāsukhavajra. The Padmāvatī is preserved in two Nepali manuscripts, one of which is a direct copy of the other. The older of the two, used for this translation, can be dated to 1297. This commentary has never been edited or translated, except the part corresponding to chapters 9–12 of the CMT, which was edited by Harunaga Isaacson to accompany his edition of the root text of these four chapters. Professor Isaacson’s edition, along with text-critical and analytical notes, was kindly made available for the present translation. The Padmāvatī covers select chapters only, and even then tends to skip lengthy parts of the text. This Sanskrit text, which was never translated into Tibetan, is in many places corrupt and fraught with ambiguities, and the manuscript is unfortunately not always legible. Nevertheless, aprovisional transcript of the complete text was prepared to help interpret the root text in the course of this translation.I.9The text of the CMT presumes the reader’s prior knowledge and understanding of Buddhism’s main principles, including the tenets of Vajrayāna. Further, it requires that the reader has faith and devotion, which is so indispensable for the intuitive grasp of, and the eventual awakening to, the true nature of things—the nature that is described as empty (śūnya). According to the CMT, this awakening is irreversibleand is therefore termed indestructible awakening (vajrabodhi). It can only take place when all dualistic concepts, such as “pure” and “impure,” fall away. And it is here that the seemingly revolting practices found in our text become significant: they are a call to give up our deluded dualistic notions, while at the same time constituting a touchstone for the direct experience of reality, a reality where even what may seem revolting to the conceptual mind can now be experienced as the deity. The inclusion of such “extreme” practices is a testimony to the fact that the CMT presents us not with mere sophistries, but with practices rooted in actual experience.I.10One needs to assume that the practice of Ca amahāro a a ṇḍṣṇ is secret to the same extent that all the Yoginītantra deity practices are. The CMT distinguishes between two types of conduct: the first, which is for everybody to see and which accords withBuddhism’s ten wholesome practices, is described as open (praka aṭ), and the other, which is secret, is termed inverted (viparīta). The motto of inverted conduct is:By passion, passion is killed;"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A conflagration is killed by fire.One should destroy poison with poison,Applying the instructions. (CMT, 12.6)I.11The text clearly states that the master must not give instructions on the “inverted” practices to someone who has not first been initiated into the ma ala of ṇḍCa amahāro a a. The initiation itself would not be effective unless the pupil has ṇḍṣṇrealized the empty nature of mind, and the practices must not be undertaken by someone who has not achieved sufficient control over his prā a-mind (ṇvāyucitta). However, as there are currently no lineage masters who could give the Ca amahāro a a empowerment or even the reading authorization (Tib. ṇḍṣṇ lung) for the formal Ca amahāro a aṇḍṣṇ sādhanas, or who could give instruction in other Ca amahāro a a practices found in the CMT, it would be difficult, if not ṇḍṣṇimpossible, to become initiated into these practices. As for simply reading the CMT,one should proceed at one’s own risk—with the prerequisite, at the least, of an openand respectful frame of mind.I.12To facilitate the arising of nondual awareness, the tantras, especially those of the Yoginī class, bring in another essential element. This is the overwhelming intensity of experience that obliterates mental acts of self-reference. When this experience is founded on an exclusively benevolent frame of mind, such as the feeling of great affection (mahārāga), there is a chance that dualistic fixations can melt away, bringing on an irreversible change. This brings us closer to the specific content of theCa a ṇḍmahāro a aṣṇtantra, namely its sexual practices. When used skillfully, sexuality becomes a powerful tool. The ritual union engages the two partners on all levels—the physical level; the level of the five senses (the senses constituting a bridge between the body and consciousness); and all the different levels of consciousness. The partners, perceiving each other as deities, generate strong love and devotion for one another. Their union allows for an intense experience, which brings the mind effortlessly into focus and sharpens the awareness. After the intensity peaks, there is a brief natural gap, when the three kleśas—desire, aversion,and indifference, which normally drive one’s conceptual thinking—completely cease. All that is needed at this point is recognition. This recognition can be arrived at and stabilized through the repeated practice of ritual union.I.13The theory and practice of this union as presented in the CMT revolves around the four joys (caturānandāḥ). One observes these four as they arise during the ritualized lovemaking, and one learns to discern the “gap”—an ineffable state of nondual awareness at the point at which supreme joy (paramānanda) gives way toinnate joy (sahajānanda). This gap can be discerned during the innate joy phase,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"which, as the commentary tells us, corresponds in the male to the period between the moment when semen reaches the tip of the penis, to the moment when all of thesemen has entered the vagina. Once this gap—an interruption in the continuum of the subject, the object, and grasping—is recognized, one gradually learns to prolongthis state of mind until one attains stability. The four joys are, in fact, the foundation stone for the practice of the deity Ca amahāro a a ṇḍṣṇ, and also the central theme of the soteriological part (roughly the first sixteen chapters) of the CMT.I.14Readers not familiar with the social customs of the period might feel surprised at the young age of girls—sometimes as low as twelve—accepted as consorts in the practice of sexual yoga. Sexual initiation early in life was the norm of the day and certainly not unique to the tantras. In India, the ancient norm-setting law books (sm tiśāstras ṛ), which remained authoritative throughout the entire Indian phase ofVajrayāna Buddhism, were concerned not so much with the youngest age at which sexual activity was permissible, but rather with the oldest before which the girl must become sexually active in order not to miss her first opportunity to conceive. One law book warns of consequences if this opportunity is missed: “When she reaches twelve..., the forefathers (pit ṛ) of the girl who has not yet been given in marriage will themselves drink her menstrual discharge every month” (Parāśarasm tiṛ, 7:5–6). Another book concurs: “A girl who sees her own menstrualblood in her father’s house shall be known as an outcaste” (Vi usm ti ṣṇṛ, 24:41). Thepurpose of the sexual act as espoused in different literary genres may have varied (from the reproductive in the sm tiśāstras ṛ to the soteriological in the Yoga- and Yoginītantras), but the early sexual initiation is evidenced throughout the whole spectrum of Indian literature. That said, one must add that the age most often recommended by the tantras was actually not twelve but sixteen; this is paralleled by the age of the deity forms visualized during the sādhana.I.15The sexual practices, however, are far from being the only content of the CMT, which is varied and rich. This tantra aims to be a guide, complete in itself, which takes care of both our soteriological and mundane needs. Since the CMT includes all the standard elements of a classical Buddhist tantra of the later period, it may beunnecessary to describe, or even list, all these elements here. Instead a brief mention of some of its salient features might be of benefit. (For a full list of topics, please consult the chapter headings in the contents section.)I.16One such feature is the exalted position of women. This thread, present throughout the text, starts from the premise that the man and the woman are deities—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ca amahāro a a and ṇḍṣṇ Vajradhātvīśvarī, respectively—and both should worship each other as such. The text, however, dwells on the service rendered by a man to a woman, rather than the other way around. The woman is the one who grants the ultimate beatitude and the final awakening, and she is the one who deserves infinitegratitude and devout service. This may be best illustrated by a quotation:Women are heaven, women are the Dharma,And women are truly the supreme austerity.Women are the Buddha, women are the Sa gha,ṅWomen are the Perfection of Wisdom . (CMT, 8.14)I.17The word used for “service” is sevā, which in Sanskrit means “attending to” (as a servant would to a master). It also means “sexual intercourse,” which—being in itself a form of service—here takes a ritualized form. Again a quotation summarizes it all:For a woman, the man is a deity;For a man, the woman is a deity.They should honor each otherBy uniting the vajra and the lotus. (CMT, 10.9)I.18The content of the CMT thus ranges from soteriological, through magical (which combines soteriological and mundane elements), to practical. Consequently the textbecomes, in turn, a manual of deity practice with its development (utpatti) and completion (utpanna) stages, a compendium of magical practices comprising the four types of tantric (not necessarily “enlightened”) activity, and a do-it-yourself manual offering instruction on various practical subjects, some as mundane as waterproofing cloth or dying one’s hair. Among the different types of magic, prominence is given to the rites of enthrallment (vaśīkara aṇ); and among the magical remedies, to those enhancing sexual experience during lovemaking. The CMT is also a rich source of materia medica; it contains a wealth of ritual prescriptions and recipes in which magic blends with folk medicine.I.19The plant names and other materia medica presented a particular difficulty during the translation work. There are discrepancies between the traditional sources as regards plant names, and sometimes several plant species contend for the same name. Modern scholars of āyurveda or ethnobotany do not always agree among themselves concerning the correct identification of some plants. A certain amount of care was taken, however, to identify every plant by the names found in the Sanskrit and the Tibetan texts. A number of reference works and specialized websites were consulted, but, needless to say, not all the plants and substances have"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"been identified reliably, and some could not be identified at all. Some passages in the sections containing such recipes still remain unclear.I.20The mantras and dhāra īṇs have been translated, for the most part, as they often take the form of a request or a prayer, and their semantic content is usually related to the ritual in which they are employed. This particularly applies to the longer formulae, such as garland mantras or dhāra īs. However, because they are meant ṇto be recited in their original Sanskrit form, which is believed to possess liturgical and magical significance, their full Sanskrit text has been given in notes. Translation of these formulae, again, presented a problem, and the reader should note that many words that are not standard Sanskrit have not been identified with certainty, and some have not been identified at all.I.21Technical Sanskrit terms that do not have English equivalents have either been translated descriptively, or the original term was used with a link to the glossary. Asthe ritual jargon of the tantras is often incompatible with modern English in terms of semantics and usage, the reader will find that certain English words in our translation have been used in a somewhat unconventional way. For example, in ourtranslation the direct object of the verb to incant can be not only the mantra but also, just as in Old English, the object over which the spell or the mantra is to be recited. Although there is a significant precedent for this particular usage in modern English, in genres ranging from academic works to the Harry Potter novels,this could still seem “incorrect” to many readers.I.22As already mentioned, the CMT includes instructions that are not intended as spiritual per se. Among the methods of the do-it-yourself type, the tantra distinguishes a special category that it refers to as kutūhala, that is, “curious” or “odd.” As this name suggests, these methods—such as setting a cow bone ablaze, making things glow at night, or causing iron to appear as copper—might have been included in the tantra because of their curiosity rather than their practical value. Obtaining the necessary requisites for some of these practices might require killing animals or performing other acts conventionally regarded as unwholesome. A few of these practices might appear, by society’s norms, as frivolous, if not gratuitously harmful. These “odd” elements are, however, neither unique to the CMT (many tantras include a chapter or section devoted to them), nor do they purport to be part of this tantra’s main message. The aim and purpose of the CMT’s profound teachings lies in the realization of nondual awareness through the practice of the four joys. As such its unique beauty is in the love and devotion experienced in the union of the two partners—the wisdom and the means."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"TRANSLATIONThe Tantra of CanṇḍṇamahāroṣṇanṇaCHAPTER 1Introduction1.1[F.304.b] Oṁ, homage to Ca amahāro a a!ṇḍṣṇThus have I heard at one time. Lord Vajrasattva dwelt within the vulva of the goddess of the vajra Realm, which is the essence of body, speech, and mind of all tathāgatas.

Ak obhya ṣ is the father, Māmakī is the mother. Seeing their mutual passion, one feels aversion for the father and attraction for the mother. Because of delusion, one enters as the consciousness of a new being. One emerges from the womb as a newborn. One kills the father in order to take his place, and seizes the mother because of motherly love received in one’s former births, and alsofor the sake of exquisite pleasure. One, too, begets sons and daughters, who are, respectively, White Acala, Delusion Vajrī, and so forth. The sons, for their part, are patricides, wholly intent on fornication, and nothing but enemies.

The meaning is that, directly after death, the insubstantial mind assumes a physical shape.16.7"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"“From this ignorance arise formations of which there are three types: (1) the formations of the body are exhalation and inhalation, (2) the formations of speech are speculative knowledge and analytical knowledge, and (3) the formations of mind are attachment, hatred, and delusion. Ignorance, combined with these formations, exhales and inhales; it wanders to and apprehends material objects, and it analyzes and apprehends that which is immaterial; it becomes infatuated, hostile, or bewildered. [F.329.a]16.8“From these formations arises consciousness, which is sixfold: eye- consciousness, ear- consciousness, nose- consciousness, tongue- consciousness, body- consciousness, and mind-consciousness. When combined with these six, ignorance sees, hears, smells, tastes, feels, and cogitates.16.9“From this consciousness arise name and form. Name is the four aggregates, starting with sensation. Form is form alone. With these two put together and rolled into one, we have what is called name and form. The meaning is that ignorance takes on the form of the five aggregates that are grasped onto. Among these, sensation is threefold: pleasurable, painful, and neutral. Perception is the internal description of things after apprehending their particular forms. The formations are the primary and subsidiary mental states that apprehend the particular circumstances of general things. The consciousnesses have already been described. Form has the nature of four elements: (1) earth is characterized by heaviness and hardness; (2) water, by liquidity and fluidity; (3) fire, by heat and the ability to heat; and (4) wind, by its changing course, diffusiveness, and its being set into motion easily.16.10“From name and form arise six cognitive fields—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind fields.

This is the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"acquisition of the five perpetuating aggregates. [F.329.b]16.12“From this birth arises old age, which is being old and worn-out, and death, which is the cessation of mind and its contents.124 Then, reflecting on old age and death, one becomes overcome with grief. One laments, ‘I have not striven for liberation.’ Plagued by diseases, one is overcome by pain. Thinking about it again and again, one falls into depression. Even though one is already depressed, one is further assailed by misfortunes and becomes exasperated.16.13“The meaning is as follows. A being in the intermediate state after death possesses the full range of the six cognitive fields up to their furthest limit, which entails the fields governed by ignorance and so forth. Although remaining in just one place, that being will look at the three worlds and see a woman and a man making love. Driven by the karma created in his previous lives, he will perceive the couple making love in a form that corresponds to his future form of existence. Upon seeingthem, the meeting occurs with great intensity.16.14“At that point, if one is going to be a man, one sees oneself in the form of a man. One feels extreme passion for one’s future mother and is overcome by intense hatred for one’s future father. The passion and the hatred are sensations of pleasureand pain respectively. Wondering how to have sex with the female, one is bewildered by that sensation, which is neither painful nor pleasurable.16.15“Then, out of great craving, which is impelled by the wind of one’s previous karma, one decides to make love to her. Upset, one thinks, ‘Who is that man having sex with my woman?’ Thinking this, one enters through the fontanel of one’s future father just like a falling star. Because one resides in the mind—the mind that abidesin the father’s semen—one perceives oneself making love to one’s future mother and grasps at the pleasure. At that point, one has become essentially identical to thesemen. Because of being excited with great passion, one passes through the centralchannel and emerges from the father’s penis. Passing through the channel ofthe goddess of the vajra Realm located in the orifice of the mother’s vulva, one is established in the birth channel of the womb. [F.330.a] Subsequently a new life begins by internalizing the secretions.16.16“In due order, the stages of conceptus, embryonic nucleus, compacted matter, lump, and fetus with limbs unfold, and eventually one is born within nine or ten months, emerging through the same way that one entered. Thus a birth takes place."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"16.17“If, however, one is going to be a woman, one feels passion for the future father and hatred for the future mother. One then sees oneself as having a female form. Entering through the fontanel of the future mother, one falls into the vagina, becomes fused with the semen, and remains in her birth channel. Then, in the sameway as before, one emerges and is born.16.18“So in this way, people are born into the world through ignorance and the rest. And these people are only the five aggregates. These five aggregates circle unhappily around in sa sāra. But those who seek liberation should not occupy themselves ṃwith this suffering.16.19“After the cessation of ignorance and the remaining links, the aggregates will also cease.125 This cessation, however, would be an empty state126 of no value to the seekers of liberation, who should not occupy themselves with useless things.12716.20“For such seekers, existence is not liberation, but nor is nonexistence.128 They should instead practice the secret union of wisdom and means that is devoid of both existence and nonexistence. This union has the nature of great bliss;129 it is the glorious lord Acala himself; it is the mind that has the single form of the four joys; it abides in neither existence nor nirvā a; it is liberation.ṇ13016.21“The world comes into being through passion;It meets its end when passion ends.131By knowing the meaning of Acala fully through passion,The accomplishment of Buddha will blossom forth.16.22“The mind that rejoices in the essence of pleasureAnd does not stray during union with the wisdom-consort,That mind, shaking off the great demon of cessation,132Is referred to by the name Acala.” [F.330.b]CHAPTER 17Increasing the Semen"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"17.1Then the Blessed Lady said:“Lord, this sexual unionCan increase and vitalizeThe semen, menstrual blood, penis, vagina, and breasts,Since it prevents the development of diseases.17.2“As there are methods for bringing the woman’s mind to the state of enthrallment,And also for treating barrenness,133For arresting the semen, and causing the menstrual blood to flow—Please explain these methods.”17.3The Blessed One then said:“Well done!
