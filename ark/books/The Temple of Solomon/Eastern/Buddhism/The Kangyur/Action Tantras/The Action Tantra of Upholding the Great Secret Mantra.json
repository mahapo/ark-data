[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"IntroductionI.1Upholding the Great Secret Mantra (Mahāmantrānudhāra iṇ,1 Toh 563) is the fifth scripture in a series of five; the other four texts are Destroyer of the great trichiliocosm (Mahāsāhasrapramardanī, Toh 558), The Great Peahen, Queen of Incantations (Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī, Toh 559), The Noble Great Amulet, Queen of Incantations (Mahāpratisāravidyārājñī, Toh 561), and The Sūtra of Great Cool Grove, (Mahāśītavana, Toh 562).2 Together these five texts have been apotheosized in the Mahāyāna tradition as five goddesses known collectively as the Pañcarak ā, or the “Five Protectresses.” In the Tibetan tradition this collection is ṣknown by the moniker gzungs chen grwa lnga, the “Fivefold Great Dhāra ī.” In ṇthe Degé Kangyur collection these texts constitute 60, 49, 43, 25, and 12 folios, respectively, making a total of 189 folios.I.2Tibetan redactors of Kangyur collections have catalogued this set of five texts together within the final Action (kriyā) tantras section of the “tantra collection” (rgyud ’bum) division. Indeed, these scriptures do contain elements—powerful incantations, an emphasis on external ritual hygiene and other material details such as Auspicious dates, and so forth—that resonate with standard Krīyayoga practice as understood in Tibet. Yet missing from nearly all these texts is any extensive mention of the contemplative visualization exercises, specialized ritual gestures (mudrā), elaborate ma ala diagrams, and initiation ceremonies so ṇḍtypical of full-blown Buddhist tantra. A close perusal of these five texts might then lead the reader to construe them as standard Mahāyāna texts with a preponderanceof elements—magical mantra formulas, ritual prescriptions, pragmatic aims, and soforth—that only later coalesced and developed into a typically tantric practice tradition with its own unique set of view, meditation, and conduct. To complicate things further, the core of the Mahāmāyūrī, for one, is rooted in Indian Buddhist traditions that predate even the rise of Mahāyāna.3 The Mahāmāyūrī also appears as a remedy for snakebites in the earlier Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinayavastu.4 This accords with Gregory Schopen’s general observation, based on inscriptional evidence, that “dhāra ī texts were publically known much earlier and more widely ṇthan texts we think of as ‘classically’ Mahāyāna”.5I.3Regardless of their bibliographical position in the Tibetan canon, the Five Protectresses have been among the most popular texts used for pragmatic purposesthroughout the Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna Buddhist world. While it seems certain that these texts each developed independently and were only later combined into a five-text corpus, their popularity is attested by their eventual spread to Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia, China, Mongolia, Korea, Japan, and Indonesia (Hidas 2007: 189). In"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"East Asia, the textual tradition associated with the Mahāmāyūrī in particular was instrumental in integrating Buddhist and indigenous notions of divine kingship.6Moreover, the tradition of all five goddesses and their texts still occupies a place of central importance today in the Vajrayāna Buddhism practiced by the Newar population of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. Newar Buddhist communitiesof Kathmandu have even translated the texts of the Five Protectresses into the modern vernacular, based on which they continue to stage a number of annual ritesfor a broad range of pragmatic purposes.7 Newars often propitiate the Five Protectresses together by means of a five-section ma ala and other tantric ṇḍelements that do not necessarily feature in the scriptures themselves. This tradition reflects a specifically tantric ritual treatment of the texts, which, judging by the presence of tantricsādhana practices associated with these five texts in the Tibetan Tengyur collections, had already developed by the time the Tibetan translations were executed. This helps account for why Tibetan redactors construed these five texts as belonging to the category of Krīyatantra, and not to the Dhāra ī or Sūtra ṇsections. Indeed, the Tibetan translation of the Mahāpratisarā reflects a recension of the Sanskrit text, which, Gergely Hidas suggests, “most likely served the better integration of this text into the Vajrayāna, changing the historical locus of the nidāna to a mythical Vajrayānic setting.”8I.4The designation Five Protectresses denotes the set of five texts, the incantations presented therein, and the goddesses presiding over each. It is believed that all these texts, particularly their incantations, provide special protection against a widerange of illnesses and misfortunes for those who memorize, recollect, read, copy, teach, wear, or otherwise come into contact with them. Each text promises protection against specific misfortunes, with considerable overlap witnessed between the texts. Despite the pragmatic thrust of these scriptures, each text also contains numerous allusions to doctrinal notions. The range of effects described therein sometimes, though rarely, extends beyond the pragmatic sphere to include the purification of negative karma, deliverance from the lower realms, and even the attainment of buddhahood.I.5Upholding the Great Secret Mantra was translated into Tibetan under Tibetan imperial patronage sometime during the early ninth century by a translation team that included the translator-editor Bandé Yeshé Dé (ca. late eighth to early ninth century) and the Indian scholars Śīlendrabodhi, Jñānasiddhi, and Śākyaprabha. The sūtra promises protection against a range of threats, from illnesses, natural disasters, and dangers while traveling, to warfare, corporal punishment, and theft. This text frames all of these perils as originating from the animosity and ill will of human beings and spirits. The principal focus is threats posed by the capricious spirit world of “non-humans” (mi ma yin), who feed off the life force, vitality, flesh,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and blood of humans. The negative impact of these non-humans extends beyond the individual to include homes, villages, towns, cities, regions, and entire countries. The text claims to be efficacious by means of “drawing” or demarcating a “boundary” around those in need of protection, sealing them off from the source of harm and thereby restoring health and internal cohesion. It is through “receiving, holding, reciting, preaching, and mastering” this scripture that such a protective boundary is formed.I.6The narrative of the sūtra begins with an interchange between the Buddha and the god Brahmā. Brahmā, along with his divine retinue, visits the Blessed One at theJetavana hermitage and requests that he “guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being” to the entire trichiliocosm of a thousand million worlds, just as the god himself does for the chiliocosm of a thousand worlds under his care. The Buddha acquiesces to his request by remaining silent. He subsequently proceeds to teach the scripture’s dhāra ī formulas and to extol its many benefits. Much as in ṇthe Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī, but with less elaboration, the Buddha prescribes the invocation by name of the spirits responsible for personal and communal misfortunes. These litanies, which the Buddha separates into groups based on the locations and activities of these beings, hierarchically arrange the spirits so that they are all subordinate to the Buddha’s command and to the command of his sa gha. The Buddha states that just “upholding” or intoning these names along ṅwith the mantra formula that accompanies each group will urge them to obey members of the sa gha so that they desist from causing harm and instead serve the ṅpragmatic needs of the sa gha and surrounding lay communities.ṅI.7Owing to the absence of a reliable Sanskrit edition that reflects the Tibetan translations, this English translation is based on the Tibetan Degé edition, in consultation with the Pedurma (dpe bsdur ma) comparative edition. Thus, rather than adjudicate on the many variant readings of the dhāra ī formulas found in the ṇdifferent Tibetan versions of this text, we have chosen to defer this issue for now and record only the Degé version until a Sanskrit edition is produced that might shed further light on the matter.THE TRANSLATIONThe Sūtra ofUpholding the Great Secret Mantra1.1[F.150.b] Homage to the Three Jewels!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Homage to the Buddha!Homage to the Dharma!Homage to the Sa gha!ṅHomage to the seven perfectly and completely awakened buddhas, along with their śrāvakas—those who have perfectly gone, and those who have perfectly entered!1.2Following this homage:May these incantations be practiced for a purpose!May these incantations be accomplished!May their purpose—the goal for which they are practiced—Be accomplished!1.3Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was dwelling in the Jetavana,Anāthapi adaṇḍ’s grove in Śrāvastī. At that time, Brahmā, Master of the Sahā world, with the gods of the Brahmā realm; Śakra, lord of the gods, with thegods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three; the four great kings, with the gods of their realm; the twenty-eight great yak a ṣ generals; and Hārītī with her children and retinue of servants went before the Blessed One, bowed their heads at his feet, and stood to one side.1.4Standing there, Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, bowed toward the Blessed One with palms joined, and said, “Venerable Blessed One, I rule as lord over the realms of the chiliocosm. [F.151.a] Venerable Blessed One, when needed I guard, protect, look after, and bring peace and well-being to the realms in the chiliocosm.

Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, understood that the Buddha had acquiesced by his silence, and at that moment he vanished.1.6Subsequently, the Blessed One said to the monks, “Monks, last night I was approached by Brahmā, master of the Sahā world, along with the gods of the Brahmā realm; Śakra, lord of the gods, with the gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Three; the four great kings, with the gods of the realm of the four great kings; and the twenty-eight great yak a generals; and Hārītī with her children and retinue of ṣservants also came.1.7“Brahmā, Master of the Sahā world, said to me, ‘Venerable Blessed One, I rule as lord over the realms of the chiliocosm.
