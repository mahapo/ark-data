The discourse commences with Buddha Śākyamuni relating to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara the benefits of reciting the various names of Śrī Mahādevī. The Buddha describes how Śrī Mahādevī acquired virtue and other spiritual accomplishments through the practice of venerating numerous tathāgatas and gives an account of the prophecy in which her future enlightenment was foretold by all the buddhas she venerated. The Buddha then lists the one hundred and eight blessed names of Śrī Mahādevī to be recited by the faithful. The sūtra ends with Buddha Śākyamuni giving a dhāraṇī and a brief explanation on the benefits of reciting the names of Śrī Mahādevī, namely the eradication of all negative circumstances and the accumulation of merit and happiness. Acknowledgments This sūtra was translated from Tibetan into English, under the supervision of Khenpo Ngawang Jorden, by the monks Jamyang Choesang and Kunsang Choepel, and the lay people Boyce Teoh and Solvej Nielsen, members of the Sakya Pandita Translation Group (International Buddhist Academy Division), Kathmandu, 2010. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Introduction This text extols the virtues and benefits of devotional practices, such as the recitation of sacred names and formulae or mantras. It can thus be said to be related to the bhakti or devotional movement in the religious life of the Indian subcontinent, a form of religious expression found in all major religions of the world. Faith (śraddhā; dad pa) is an essential factor of the path to awakening. It is listed among the five spiritual faculties (indriya; dbang po) and the eleven wholesome mental states.1 In this sūtra, Śrī Mahādevī cultivated her faith by venerating and chanting names of the enlightened ones, thus accomplishing the roots of virtue that become the cause of her future awakening. The narrative takes place in the buddha realm Sukhāvatī, where Buddha Śākyamuni explains to Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara the benefits of reciting Śrī Mahādevī’s names. He further explains how Śrī Mahādevī herself gained the roots of virtue by venerating numerous tathāgatas, which the Buddha lists. He then relates the prophecy of Śrī Mahādevī’s future enlightenment, bestowed upon her by those buddhas, and lists her one hundred and eight names. The sūtra ends with Buddha Śākyamuni giving a dhāraṇī and a brief explanation on how to practice the recitation of Śrī Mahādevī’s names. Because the Tibetan version of this sūtra lacks a colophon, there is no information regarding the translator or the date of translation of this text from Sanskrit into Tibetan. Versions of this sūtra in Sanskrit and Chinese are still extant today. This appears to be the first translation into a Western language. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" The Degé edition of this sūtra was compared with various editions of the Tibetan canon, namely, the Narthang, Beijing and Lhasa editions, as well as with the Sanskrit of the Gilgit manuscript as edited by Nalinaksa Dutta. The English translation has been made on the basis of the Tibetan, with a few exceptions as indicated in the notes. The great many proper names contained in the sūtra are here given in Sanskrit; but translations have been added in parentheses in the case of the “one hundred and eight names”—which are, rather, epithets describing Mahādevī.

The Bhagavān was dwelling in Sukhāvatī together with the great saṅgha of bodhisattvas, amongst them the following bodhisattva mahāsattvas of the excellent eon2: Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Bodhisattva Mahā-sattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkaṃbhin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Kṣiti-garbha, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ākāśagarbha, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Vajrapāṇi and Bodhisattva Sarvabhayahara, and similarly Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvamaṅgaladhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvapuṇyalakṣaṇadhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Candra-sūryatrailokyadhārin, Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Sarvatīrtha-maṅgaladhārin, and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta. Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara went to the place where the Bhagavān was, paid homage at the Bhagavān’s feet, and remained at one side.

As Indra, Brahmā and the guardians of the world all offered their praises and acclaim, the Bhagavān, having gazed at Śrī Mahādevī, addressed Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara as follows in his Great Brahmā voice: “O Avalokiteśvara, if any one of the kings, ministers, bhikṣus, bhikṣunīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas or śūdras retains this praise “The One Hundred and Eight Names4 of Śrī Mahādevī which are Renowned as Stainless,” then the kṣatriya king’s kingdom, the fears of those beings there, as well as the epidemics and harmful influences will all be pacified,5 and no one at all will fear robbers, rogues, humans or nonhumans. Wealth, grains, treasuries and stores will all increase, and the Glorious Mahādevī will no doubt abide in the home of this kṣatriya king” Then those bodhisattva mahāsattvas spoke the following words: “O Bhagavāṇ, these [F.248.a] words are well said. Excellent! Excellent! Those people who will retain the names of Śrī Mahādevī and who will put them into practice once they have heard them6 will have those aforementioned qualities and benefits.” Then Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Ārya Avalokiteśvara asked the Bhagavān the following: “O Bhagavān, where did Śrī Mahādevī generate her roots of virtue?” The Bhagavān replied: “Śrī Mahādevī [F.247.b] generated roots of virtue in the presence of tathāgatas as numerous as the grains of sand of the River Ganges. O Avalokiteśvara, previously, in the past in a world system called Ratnasaṃbhavā, the tathāgata called Ratnakusumaguṇasāgaravaiḍūryakanakagirisuvarṇakāṁcanaprabhāsaśrī came forth into the world.
