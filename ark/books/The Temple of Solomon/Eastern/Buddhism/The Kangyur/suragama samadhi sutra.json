I believe that this is because the Buddha's basic approach was to prescribe a different treatment for every spiritual ailment, much as a doctor prescribes a different medicine for every medical ailment. Thus his teachings were always appropriate for the particu-lar suffering individual and for the time at which the teaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed to relieve the suffering to which it was addressed. Ever since the Buddha's Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago, his message of wisdom and compassion has spread through-out the world. Yet no one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into English throughout the history of Japan. It is my greatest wish to see this done and to make the translations avail-able to the many English-speaking people who have never had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha's teachings. Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha's eighty-four thousand teachings in a few years. I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taisho edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project. It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criticized. Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himself or herself to initiate this project, it will never be done. At the same time, I hope that an improved, revised edition will appear in the future. It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundred Buddhist scholars from the East and the West, this monu-mental project has finally gotten off the ground. May the rays of the Wisdom of the Compassionate One reach each and every person in the world.

Under his leadership, a special preparatory committee was organized in April, 1982. By July of the same year, the Translation Committee of the English Tripitaka was officially convened. The initial Committee consisted of the following members: HANAYAMA Shoyu (Chairperson); BANDO Shojun; ISHIGAMI Zenno; KAMATA Shigeo; KANAOKA Shuyu; MAYEDA Sengaku; NARA Yasuaki; SAYEKI Shinko; (late) SHIOIRI Ryotatsu; TAMARU Noriyoshi; (late) TAMURA Kwansei; URYUZU Ryushin; and YUYAMA Akira. Assistant members of the Committee were as follows: KANAZAWA Atsushi; WATANABE Shogo; Rolf Giebel of New Zealand; and Rudy Smet of Belgium. After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Com-mittee selected 139 texts for the First Series of translations, an esti-mated one hundred printed volumes in all. The texts selected are not necessarily limited to those originally written in India but also in-clude works written or composed in China and Japan. While the pub-lication of the First Series proceeds, the texts for the Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works; this process will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese, have been published. Frankly speaking, it will take perhaps one hundred years or more to accomplish the English translation of the complete Chinese and Japanese texts, for they consist of thousands of works. Nevertheless, as Dr. NUMATA wished, it is the sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue unto completion, even after all its present members have passed away.

To my great regret, however, Dr. NUMATA passed away on May 5,1994, at the age of 97, entrusting his son, Mr. NUMATA Toshihide, with the continuation and completion of t he Translation Project. The Committee also lost its able and devoted Chairperson, Professor HANAYAMA Shoyu, on June 16, 1995, at the age of 63. After these se-vere blows, t he Committee elected me, Vice-President of t he Musashino Women's College, to be the Chair in October, 1995.

One of t he most profound of all Mahayana texts, it depicts a vision of Buddhism that is thoroughly transcendent and at the same time uniquely humanistic. Here the Buddha Sakyamuni is no mere his-torical personage, but the one e t e r n al cosmic B u d d ha who is t he source of all other Buddhas. The Dharma Sakyamuni teaches is the Suran-gama Samadhi, the meditative concentration of the \"heroic march\" to Buddhahood, which is presented in overwhelmingly lavish terms as the very key to the enlightenment of the Buddhas and all of their awesome spiritual power. And the prize that awaits those who prac-tice and achieve mastery of this incredible samadhi is not merely enlightenment in individual terms, but the insurpassable and perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood itself. Indeed, this text implies it would be impossible to remain in any Hmayanist state of enlightened ex-tinction, since the Surahgama Samadhi even gives the Buddha the power to recall the Pratyekabuddhas (those who are enlightened by their own efforts and who pass into extinction without teaching oth-ers), and Arhats (those who complete the entire Hinayana path to achieve total Nirvanic extinction) from their religious comas to achieve perfect Buddhahood. The text is c l a s s i c a l ly Mahayana in format and structure. It begins with a grand assembly on Mount Grdhrakuta (Vulture Peak), where the Buddha is surrounded by great numbers of b h i k s u s, Bodhisattvas, and other beings. T he dialogue begins w i th a question by a Bodhisattva named Resolute Mind (one of several figures who appear here who are not known in other texts), then proceeds involving a number of par-ticipants, including Bodhisattvas, Sravakas (the human disciples of 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Surangama Samadhi Sutra the Buddha identified with the Hinayana), gods, and goddesses. It also uses several different supernatural manifestations, such as the simultaneous offering of innumerable elaborate chairs for the Bud-dha by all the most highly ranked gods present, the appearance of Mara bound hand and foot and unable at first to attend the preach-ing of the Sutra, and the manifestation of the palaces of Mara and innumerable Indra gods. The grand climax of all these is t he Buddha's manifestation of all the innumerable Buddhas of the ten directions, shining with light and surrounded by their assemblies, who then offer flowers to form canopies over the heads of these Buddhas, first over Sakyamuni and then over all the others. This magnificent epiphany is presented as part of a dramatic hesitation toward the end of the dialogue, when some of the Bodhisattvas in Sakyamuni's assembly become discouraged by the apparent difficulty of the path to Buddhahood being described. Finally, there is t he charge to Ananda to preach the Sutra, which is also carried up by one of the many Indra kings who appear in the text. The incomparable merits of copy-ing, reciting, and teaching the Sutra are extolled, and as the scene closes countless numbers of sentient beings generate the Bodhicitta, the intention to achieve insurpassable and perfect enlightenment, eighteen thousand Bodhisattvas attain the Surangama Samadhi, an equal number of bhiksus and bhiksunis (monks and nuns) attain Arhatship, and even greater numbers of laypeople and gods attain different levels of understanding. From the very beginning of the dialogue it is apparent that this Sutra (or, rather, its anonymous author) grapples with a fundamen-tal problem that faced the practitioners of the Mahayana: how to account for the apparently dismal spiritual fates of Hlnayanist prac-titioners, the Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Arhats. Resolute Mind Bodhisattva's opening question concerns whether or not there exists a samadhi that causes Bodhisattvas to rapidly achieve perfect en-lightenment, while at the same time allowing beings of l e s s er aspira-tions to practice successfully according to their own understanding even as they proceed along the Mahayana path. We l e a rn that this is indeed one of the cardinal attributes of the Surangama Samadhi, so 2"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Translator's Introduction that those who appear to practice and even believe themselves to be practicing the so-called Hinayana will actually achieve Buddhahood according to the Mahayana at some point in the future. Even more, as the text proceeds we learn that the Surangama Samadhi allows many enlightened beings to manifest themselves in any number of worldly shapes for the purpose of teaching sentient beings, so that gods, kings, monks, and laypeople may actually be forms taken by the enlightened for salvific purposes. The ultimate variation on this theme is the information given toward the end of the scripture that Manjusri Bodhisattva was actually a perfectly enlightened Buddha (his name and the particulars of his true identity are given) who had manifested himself as a Pratyekabuddha in thirty-six billion different lifetimes in order to teach sentient beings. This is a magnificent contradiction of t he Buddhist doctrinal con-vention—explicitly refuted in the text—that entry into Nirvana as a Pratyekabuddha or Arhat represents a spiritual dead end, a total extinction from which one cannot return. (The discouragement felt by some of the Buddha's listeners at the end of the text, already mentioned above, is actually that they might have to labor mightily for the achievement of the Surahgama Samadhi yet still get side-tracked into a lesser enlightenment.) This text simply cannot allow the Hlnayanist to remain in such a spiritual void, and it does not stop with merely saying that they are to be retrieved from their extinctions, but goes on to describe a religious world in which personal identity may be adopted and manifested at will for teaching purposes. Given such thoroughgoing fluidity of identity, the earlier doctrinal conven-tions about the distinctiveness and irreversibility of different spiri-tual paths are not just rejected but thoroughly transformed. There are several other themes present in this Sutra that should not go unmentioned. The existence of innumerable other Buddha lands is basic to the philosophy of the scripture, since Bodhisattvas have to worship other Buddhas in order to achieve their own Buddha-hood. Several other Buddha lands are mentioned by name and de-scribed, although the only one known widely from other sources is the Wondrous Joy world of the Buddha Aksobhya. It is especially 3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Surangama Samadhi Sutra interesting to notice, t h e n, t h at Amitabha/Amitayus and his Sukhavati are unmentioned. Also, great significance is placed on the Buddha's bestowal of t he prediction of f u t u re Buddhahood throughout the text, and even Mara is the recipient of such a prediction—before he has even sincerely generated the Bodhicitta. Offerings are extremely im-portant in this text, and they seem to receive greater weight than other forms of r e l i g i o us praxis. The spiritual identity and fate of women is touched on in a couple of the scripture's anecdotes, most particu-larly regarding two hundred goddesses introduced as attendants to Mara, who are revealed by the Buddha to have already \"planted good roots\" under five hundred Buddhas in the past. The Buddha goes on to predict that they will make offerings to innumerable Buddhas in the future and after seven hundred eons will themselves achieve Buddhahood. Although the Buddha states that their next lifetimes will be as human females serving the future Buddha Maitreya, their transformation into male form is never explicitly mentioned. But all these features are of secondary importance to the reli-gious significance of the Surangama Samadhi itself. What are we to make of this incredible and spectacular concentration? Indeed, the explanation of the Surangama Samadhi is so conceptually abstruse that it amounts to an encapsulation of the entirety of the Mahayana Buddhist path. The description of how one learns it begins with a common simile for meditation practice, the progressive training in archery so that one can hit even small targets. Following this, the practitioner is told to study a sequence that proceeds rapidly through the mind of ecstasy, the profound mind, great sympathy, great com-passion, and so forth, through the five supernatural \"penetrations\" and the six M a h a y a na Perfections, so t h at he achieves forbearance of the birthlessness of the dharmas and thus receives a prediction of Buddhahood. At this point, the practitioner is at the eighth Bodhi-sattva stage, but it is only at the tenth stage that he is able to attain the Surangama Samadhi. This is compared to perfect mastery of ar-chery, in which one can consistently hit targets smaller than a single hair.

This is the highest offering that can be made to the Tathagata.\" At that time there was a Brahma king within the assembly named Equivalent Practice, who addressed the Buddha, saying, \"O World-Honored One, which Tathagata is the real one, the one on the seat I have prepared, or one on another seat?\" The Buddha told Equivalent Practice, \"All the dharmas are empty, like phan-tasms, and only exist in conjunction with each other.

After the extinction of the Dharma, there were sentient beings there who had karmic connections [lit., causes and conditions] to be saved as Pratyekabuddhas; but even if a hundred thousand hundred-million Buddhas had preached the Dharma to them they would not have believed it or accepted it— they could only achieve emancipation through [the impact of see-ing] the body and deportment of a Pratyekabuddha.
