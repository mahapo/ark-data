Therefore, there is no way that ordinary beinp could under-nand Lama Ycshe'a seem qualities; they could only tee his qualities in accordance with the level of their mind. However, since individual experience is one of the most effective ways of realizing that the cacnce of the guru is Buddha. I would like to remember again the wonderful qualities of Lama Y eshe that I did have the karma to see . • THE QUALITIES OF lAMA'S HOLY BODY Even people who had never met Lama Y eshe got a very warm feeling simply from seeing a photograph of him; they immediately felt he was someone who was very kind and concerned about othen. I once sent an English pen friencl Audrey Cohen, a photo of Lama in a group of monks. Although I didn't explain which of the monks was Lama, Audrey wrote to say that she got a good feeling from JCeing a panic-ular monk in the back row; this monk was Lama. Many people reacted in a similar way to seeing Lama's holy body. Even though many Tibetans did not know who Lama Ycshe was and had not heard of his background as a great scholar, simply seeing Lama made them very happy, and they often felt devotion arise toWards him. Once when we wen: visiting Bodhpya some Tibetans from Sildcim met Lama in the street and immediately sensed a holy purity in him; they felt that he must be a great bodhiaava. The meeting had such a strong impact on them that they asked some nearby monks who Lama was, but no one really knew. That same evening one of the Tibetans came to see me and explained how impressed they had all been by meeting Lama in the street. He had incredible faith that Lama was a great holy being. vii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THI Buss OP INNU F1u viii Simply seeing Lama·s holy body brought peace and joy to the mind, and a wish to see more of him. Even without being introduced to him, people naturally respected Lama. Even people who had not met the Dharma felt that Lama was different from ordinary people. When they met Lama, they sensed very panicular qualities of purity and holiness; they felt not only that he was learned but also that he had a deep spiritual quality. In the general view, Lama's physical aspect changed with the development of his mind. For several years before he passed away, he looked very light and very radiant. This was an expression of his tantric realizations. Those who were aware of the signs could rccog-ni~ the outer changes that were evidence of his inner development, especially of completion stage tantric realizations. Even when Lama was showing the aspect of serious illness, he would suddenly look so bright and magnificent that you could almost think that he had no sickness at all. Out of his great compas-sion, Lama manifested various aspects as needed to subdue different sentient beings . • THE QUALITIES OF LAMA'S HOLY SPEECH Lama's holy speech was like nectar, and its power is the personal experience of those who received teachings from him. Every single word came out of his bodhicitta; every single word was for others. When other Tibetan lamas give a public talk in the West, where there are usually people who arc completely new to the Dharma, they often speak on subjects with which they arc f.uniliar rather than on sub-jects the people in the audience need to hear. Lama, however, would not usually talk on any one fixed subject but would address the various problems, spiritual and mundane, of the people in his audience. Like offering a smorgasbord, Lama would speak on one subject, then switch to another, then another, without there ncccssari.ly being a connection between the subjects. Even though they might not like all the foods served, everybody would find something they liked among the various dishes. No matter what their social class or level of education, everybody rcccivcd an answer to their problems that suited"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Foaawoao the nature of their mind. Even though they might have arrived with confused minds, they mumed home extremely happy and satisfied. After an hour's talk from Lama, no one could walk away saying that they hadn't found the solution to their problems. This amazing skill is proof that Lama's holy action of teaching was Buddha's action. It might appear to some people that Lama was simply telling many jokes to make people laugh, but those with a Dharma background appreciated how practical Lama's talks were. Somrone who had been following Buddhadharma for twenty years and had heard many secret, profound teachings still found Lama's talks practical and ben-eficial. Lama's advice was not pic in the sky; it could be related to everyday life. Some people came to Lama's lectures out of curiosity, just to see what a Tibetan lama looked like; they had no panicular wish to receive teachings from a Tibetan lama or to study Buddha's teach-ings. Others came sincerely seeking peace of mind and some solution to the problems in their lives. From Lama's external appearance, they probably didn't expect him to have any methods to solve their prob-lems. However, the more they listened to Lama, the more pcaccfu1 their minds became and the more they appreciated Lama's special qualities. Even someone with a mountain of pride in their own knowledge, which no one else could crush, would have their pride subdued by hearing Lama talk. They would naturally become more humble as a result of the teaching. At the same time, Lama himself had incredible humility, the quality of a learned person. After Lama had talked for an hour, the people in the audience would realize that this Tibetan lama was remarkable, with extensive knowledge and many answers that they didn't have. During that hour they would be greatly inspired to learn more about Tibetan Buddhism; refuge in Dharma was actualized in their minds. Lama was unbelievably kind, because he planted the fim inspiration to lis-ten to the holy Dharma and then apply it in practice. From this inspi-ration comes enlightenment. When Lama gave personal advice to his students, he would give each person cualy the advice they needed and make them extreme-ly happy. Lama had an incredible ability to understand the various ix"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THI Buu or INNU F1u X solutions that suited the level of mind of each person. When he advised people, Lama didn't rely upon dice and scriptures; his pre-dictions came from his own wisdom. When Lama taught introductory courses on lam-rim, the graduated path to enlightenment, the people listening to Lama talk felt that they could almost transform their minds into the realizations of the path to enlightenment. For example, when Lama gave teachings on bodhicitta even for a few minutes, bccaux of his own realization ofbodhicitta, the people in the audience felt as if they had achieved the realization of bodhicitta. It gave no freedom for the selfish attitude to arise. It was similar when Lama taught on tantra. A sign of having attainments of the tantric path is that a practitioner's teachings on tantra are very dear and very effective. This was obvious when Lama taught on completion stage practices such as the Six Y ogas of Naropa. just by hearing Lama's teachings on the Six Yogas and doing one or two meditations, many students had experiences. The clarity and the effect of the teachings proved that they came out of Lama's experi-ence of the tantric path. This is the essence of the small understanding that an ordinary being could have of the qualities of Lama's holy speech. After listen-ing to Lama speak, people felt no doubt that he was a holy being. a great bodhisattVa. Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness from the earth, through his teachings Lama dispelled the darkness of ignorance from the minds of so many people . • THE QUALITIES OF LAMA'S HOLY MIND Lama had a very open heart and mind; he was open to all traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and to all religions. He had a very broad view and was also very farsighted. There was nothing tight, dosed, or lim-ited about Lama's approach to life. He was not someone walking a narrow road. Even though Lama didn't have a reputation for being learned, he was respected by lamas from all orders of Tibetan Buddhism. Lama had an understanding of sutra and tantra not only according to the Gdug presentation but also according to the Nyingma, Sakya, and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Kagyu views. He was knowledgeable not only about Tibetan culture bur also abour W cstmt culrure and philosophy, which he had stud-ied seriously. Lama was not confused by words and external appear-ances that seemed to imply differences between sutra and tantra and the various orders. He would check the meaning behind the words to reach his own understanding, then concentrate on putting that mean-ing into practice. This was a panicular quality of Lama Y eshe. The actual essence of Lama's holy mind was great compassion, just as it is wim His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Lama was filled with great compassion, cherishing other sentient beinp. You can undemand Lama's great loving kindness from the way he took care of his srudents like babies. He was more than a mother, more than a &ther. Nor only did he give reachings to his students, but he consundy encouraged them in their Dharma praaice and helped them ro solve their prob-lems. Lilce a father, he would listen to all their problems and then give them personal advice as wdl as teachings. He wrore many letters each day, late at nighr, ro give advice to srudents. Even though he had so many other things to do, Lama gave so much of his time and his life to solving the problems of his srudcnts and their families. Lama would mix wirh people, enrenaining rhem in wharevcr way made them happy and dissolving the tightness in their beans. To make people happy he would go ro the beach or ro a restau-rant. Because he did these things only to bencfir others, they became causes for developing his own mind and realizations. Lama told me thar the whole poinr is to transform every action you do--caring, drinking, sleeping-into Dharma, so that your life becomes meaningful. Lama used to say that some beings even usc their breathing to benefit others. Even though Lama didn't say so, I felt that he was acrually describing his own qualities and experience, panicularly his realization of bodhicitta. Despite many doctors warning him of the seriousness of his bean condition, Lama was always cxtmndy busy traveling, giving tt2Ch-inp, writing, reading tcxa, guiding the FPMT (Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana T radirion) Cenrcrs, and giving advice to studcnrs. When Lama was at Kopan Morwrery, for example, even though he was concerned with giving guidance to all the Ccnrers and Foaawoao"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THa Buu o• INNia F1u xii to individual students, he would teach the Kopan monks; take care of their food and clothing; supervise what was happening in the kitchen and library; water the garden-and he still found time to wash the dogs with mange. He would accomplish so much in one day out of the unbearable compassion he felt for suffering sentient beings. From the first time that Lama had x-rays in Kathmandu in the early 1970S, the doctors kept on telling him that he would not live long. The first doctor told Lama that his bean condition was so serious that he had only one year to live. Many other doctors later gave a similar diag-nosis. However, even with this life-threatening physical condition, Lama lived for many years, during which he traveled extensively and engaged in many activities. Lama dedicated his life to others. An ordinary person with such dangerously poor health could not have lived so long nor achieved so much. Because of the unbearable compassion he fdt for his students, Lama tried to live as long as pos-sible to guide his students and help them make their lives meaning-ful. While he was alive, he dedicated all his time and energy to others, day and night. Lama was able to live even when physically the situation seemed to be hopeless because of the power of his great bodhicitta, his strong will, and his Wltric rcaliutions. Another of Lama's panicular powers was the great scope of his vision; he had the ability to make huge plans to benefit the teachings and sentient beings. Many people could not comprehend the scale of these works and felt that the projects were too difficult to accomplish. When Lama's plans were actualized, however, they proved to be high-ly beneficial for those who had carried them out as well as for many other sentient beings. Such great works showed the qualities of Lama's holy mind: his great compassion, great will, capability, and undemanding. If Lama had not had such a brave ani tude to work for others, besides the planning and accomplishing of such projects, even the thought of them would not have arisen. For me, one of Lama's most amazing qualities was that while he was so busy guiding all the FPMT Centers and individual students, his own practice and realizations did not degenerate. Month by month, year by year. Lama's practice actually developed. This incred-ible capability is one of the main causes of my faith in Lama. When"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Lama visited each Center, he would see all the students and advise them, as wdl as take care of the Center itself. While working fully for orhen, doing hundreds of thinp, Lama would still be able to do his own practice, and there was always development of his realizations. In some ways, it looks u if Lama wu born with realizations of the three principal paths: renunciation, bodhlcitta, and right view. Lama showed early signs of renunciation of this life. When he was a young child and had been in Sera Monastery for some time, he went back home to visit his family. Seeing the sufferings and hardships of fam-ily life and the big difference between being a monk and living a worlcUy lay life made him appreciate the incredible benefits of living in ordination. By visiting his &mily home, Lama developed renunci-ation and bad not the slightest interest in worldly life. Fouwoao Even though it looks as if Lama was born with bodhicina, accord-ing to what he aaually said, it seems he generated bodhicina while receiving a Lmu CJHJ,. commentary from His Holiness Trijang Rinpochc, the late junior Tutor to His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Lama, along with the great meditator Gcn Jampa Wangdu, Gcshc Lama Konchog, and thousands of other monks, including many learned geshes and high lamas, received the Lmu CJHJp. commen-tary. After hearing this commentary, many geshcs left the monastery and went to the nearby mountains to meditate and lead ascetic lives. When it came to the commcnwy on the lam-rim prayer in I.,.,. ChiJpt4 Lama said that he didn't find anything new in the section on impermanence and death. Nor did he find anything special in the pan on renunciation. But when it came to the section on bodhicina, equal-izing and exchanging sdf for others, Lama said that he fdt very strong-ly that this was the real teaching of Buddha. the very heart of Dharma. Lama said that while he and Gcn Jampa Wangdu were receiving these teachinss, they did not waste their time; t:Very day they medi-tated immediately after the sessions. In the general view, it looks as if Lama generated the realization of bodhicitta at that time. When Gcn Jampa Wangdu came to sec Lama at Tushita Rmcat Centre in Dharamsala, they often tcasc:d each other. Lama always put down ascetic monks, saying that even though they might physically be living on high mountains, their minds were clinging to worldly"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THa Buss o• INNI!I Faaa xiv things. Lama would then say, \"Oh, the whole world comes to me. I have everything and I enjoy it.\" Gen Jampa Wangdu used to say, .. Training the mind in the three principal paths is ancient talk.\" This meant that he had completed the realizations a long time ago. Lama would then reply, \"Oh, I real-ized emptiness ages ago, when I was debating on Madhyamaka in the counyard at Sera Je.\" Lama said that he realized emptiness when he was a young monk in Tibet. In terms of tantric practice, Lama's main deity was Heruka Chakrasamvara. I didn't know very much about scriptures when Lama and I lived together at Buxa Duar, 1 but even at that time, when Lama was studying Buddha's rules of discipline, he was already read-ing many tantric texts. From the time that we came to Nepal from India in 1968, Lama read only tantric teachings, not so much on the generation stage of Heruka but on the completion stage. From time to time I would look at the texts he was reading. In 1975, on the sec-ond teaching tour to America, we stayed for a month in Madison, ncar Geshc Sopa Rinpochc's house, to have a holiday. During that time, Lama was reading various tantric texts dealing with the clear light. This indicates that Lama was experienced in these practices and had these attainments. One of Lama's special qualities was that he never showed others that he was a great practitioner. Even to those close to him Lama did not show the external appearance of meditating. You never saw Lama sitting cross-legged in meditation posture for very long. He was either very active or relaxing. Lama, however, practiced very skillfully. Like Shantidcva, he was a great hidden yogi. When Shantideva was at Nalanda, the other monks in the monastery thought that he spent his whole time doing only three things: eating, sleeping, and defecating. They did not think that Shantidcva did any Dharma practice. Like Shantidcva, Lama kept his actual meditation hidden. Whether he was in the West or in the East, after lunch each day Lama would usually go to rest for one or two houn, but actually all those \"naps\" were meditation sessions. In the beginning I didn't rcaliz.c what Lama was doing and thought his rest was just like ordinary sleep; then gradually I realized that it was actually meditation. The"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Foaawoao reality is that when Lama appeared to be sleeping at night and after lunch, he was practicing Dharma in a very skillful way. I remm1ber one day at Kopan when Yangtse Rinpoche's family came to visit us after lunch. Y angtse Rinpoche is the incarnation of a famous lama, Geshe Ngawang Gendun, who was one of Lama's teachers. Yangtse Rinpoche's father, Jampa Thinley, used to be in Lama's class in Tibet and was a dose friend. Because of the visit, Lama didn't have time to rest after lunch, and after the family had left Lama said that he felt a great loss that he hadn't found time to rest. Lama appeared very sorry, like an ordinary person who had lost a big sack of gold. To someone who wasn't aware of Lama's hidden practice it looked as if Lama was clinging to the comfon of sleep. It didn't make sense to feel so sony about having missed an hour of rest, especially for a Dharma practitioner. Lama's \"rest\" had nothing to do with a physical problem or with karma and disturbing thoughts. It was to ensure the contint12tion of his realizations of the path. Once a practitioner has realizations, since the continuity of the experience needs to be maintained by meditating every day, even a few minutes of meditation becomes extremely precious. The second last time that Lama was at Kopan, he went one day to rest in the small hut at the top of the hill. When he came back, Lama said, \"It's strange. Normally I don't fall asleep, but this time I fell asleep for a few minutes and I dreamt that a powerful protector made offerings to me.\" This just slipped out, but it shows that when Lama rested after lunch he normally didn't go to sleep. Also, Lama often said that it was imponant to cat foods such as curd, honey, garlic, and meat. I understood the reason for this only when I saw in Pabongka Dcchen Nyingpo's Collmion of Notn that meditators with realizations of the completion stage we thc:sc: foods to develop the dements and drops in their body, so that they have stronger experiences of the dear light and strengthen the conditions for the illusory body. Lama ate these foods not to benefit his body but to develop his realizations. He was concerned not about external physical health but about inner mental health. When Lama requested His Holiness Trijang Rinpoche for teach-ings on the Six Yogas ofNaropa, Rinpoche advised him to request the XV"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THI BLIII OJ INNU fill xvi teachings from His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who had fresh c:xpcri· ence of the practice. Lama received the teachings on the Six Y ogas alone in His Holiness's private meditation room, which was a small, bare room. While receiving the teachings, Lama practiced and had many experiences. Once in Dharamsala, when I had lung, or wind disease, Lama told me, .. With achievement of bliss and voidness, there is no wind dis-case. There is no place for tighmcss if you have bliss in your bean. • I think Lama was talking from his own experience. Great meditators, even when dealing with problems, experience no depression thcm-sdvcs because of their tantric realizations. I think Lama's realization of bliss and voidness overwhelmed the many problems he had to deal with in relation to the Dharma Centers and students. He was never depressed and was always very happy. At the end of 1982., Lama taught the first course on the Six Y ogas of Naropa at lstituto Lama Tzong Khapa in Italy. From that time, even though he didn't normally travel with thimf'us and pictures, Lama always kept a panicular picture of Lama Tsongkhapa with him. It was a common postcard, but Lama told me that it was very precious, and in my ordinary view he seemed to have much more devotion for Lama T songkhapa. When he returned from the course, Lama told me, •While I was at lstituto Lama Tzong Khapa, I did Heruka self-initiation every morning before I taught the Six Y ogas of Naropa. It seemed to benefit the students very much. Because I read many scriptures, the teachings were very dfective, and many people had experiences. • During that time, Lama was reading the section on the illusory body from the completion stage of Guhyasamaja in Lama Tsongkhapa's Lllmp Thortn~ply JIJ,.miNlting th~ Fiv~ Stllgn, which contains the most extensive teaching on the illusory body. Lama then added, .. At this time I developed incrcdi· bly deep devotion for Lama T songkhapa because of his profound teachings.• Jacie Keeley, Lama's secretary, also told me that during the course at Istituto Lama T zong Khapa, she noticed one morning that Lama was crying just as he was about to begin his teaching on the Six Y ogas. After Lama returned from giving the teaching, jacie asked him why he had been crying. Lama said, •1 saw my guru.• It seems that Lama"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"saw His Holiness T rijang Rinpochc, his root guru, who had passed away more than a year before. Lama wrote a poem in praise of Lama Tsongkhapa's dear expla-nations of the illusory body. Lama said that he had been unclear about how to achieve the illusory body until he had read Lama Tsongkhapa's writings on the subject. He felt that is was only by the kindness of Lama T songkhapa that the practices of the illusory body had been clarified. Lama also wrote a commentary on the Six Y ogas of Naropa, but he did not complete it. In my view, Lama achieved the illusory body when he was at lstituto Lama T zong Khapa. I think so because Lama said that he had found incredible f.aith in Lama T songkhapa and because he then read texts solely on the illusory body, mosdy from the Guhyasamaja Tanaa.l relate Lama's devotion to Lama Tsongkhapa to the &a that Lama T songkhapa gave the clearest and most extensive explanations of how to achieve the illusory body. When I looked through the texts that Lama took with him to Vajrapani Institute in mid-1983, when he taught the second course on the Six Y ogas of Naropa, I found that they were all on Guhyasamaja and the illusory body. This indicates that Lama himself had achieved the illusory body. Lama seemed to be able to read various texts in different rooms at the same time. When Lama was in retreat at Tushita Retreat Centre, for inswu:e, he would have one text open in the retreat room, another open in the outer room, and yet another text open outside in the greenhouse. This reminded me of the stories His Holiness Zong Rinpoche told about meditators who had achieved the illusory body. While they were sleeping at night, they would use their subde body to read and memorize many scriptures at the same time. I thought that Lama was able to read so many texts in such a shon time because he did it at night with the illusory body. From the way Lama talked so confidently about the many actions that a yogi could do with their subde body, I could see that Lama himself had this power. When a new retreat house was being built at Tushita Retreat Cen-tre, one morning a big fire suddenly staned. The carpenters and other workers were trying to put the fire out with water, but every-one feared that it was burning out of control. At the time Lama was Foaawoao"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THa Buss o• INNaa F1u xviii having breakfast nearby on the roof of his house with his brother, Geshe Thinley. Lama didn't even stand up to look at the fire. He just sat in his chair, quite relaxed. The rest of w were very worried, but Lama was not worried at all. When I went to Lama, he said, \"The fire isn't a big danger. It won't cause any harm.\" Even though the Aames were very big, Lama remained relaxed, and he mentioned the story of a Tibetan monastery catching fire dur-ing Lama Tsongkhapa's time. Lama Tsongkhapa didn't need water or a lot of people to help him. He simply sat where he was and used his subde body to put out the fire. I felt that the story was related to Lama's own actions to stop the danger from the fire. Lama Y eshe was a great tantric practitioner, a real ascetic medita-tor, even though he didn't live alone in a cave. Lama was a great hid-den yogi. He was a valid base to be labeled \"yogi\" not because he could perform tantric rituals but because he had unmistakcn rcaliu-tions of dear light and the illusory body. He reached the stage of tantra 1Nihamutira. Not long before he passed away, when Lama was considering whether to have a heart operation, he said, •It doesn't maner whether the operation is successful or not. I have used myself as a servant to oth-ers. I was able to do enough, and now I am completely satisfied. I have no worries.\" This is a great teaching for w; it is the essential teaching of Lama Y eshe and of Guru Shakyamuni Buddha.

More than anything else, Lama wanted everybody to '\"taste• the praaice of inner fire. He expected everybody to work hard and maintain a retreat regime.

With dear and inspiring discussions of such topics as the basic purity of the mind, the means for recognizing and overcoming our limiting thought patterns, the self-transformational techniques of tantric deity-yoga meditation and so fonh, Lama Y cshe presented the tantric vision of totality in a form accessible to as wide an audience as possible. In that introductory work it was his intention to convey the Bavor of these most advanced Buddhist teachings in such a way that spiritual seekers, regardless of their cultural background or religious affiliation, might be motivated to discover their own basic purity, ful-fill their highest potential, and be of maximum benefit to others. Included in IntrotiMaion to Tantra were a number of passages selected from the last two major teachings given by Lama Y cshe before his passing. These teachings had been delivered at lstituto Lama Tzong Khapa in Pomaia, Italy, in 1981 and at Vajrapani Institute in Boulder Creek, California, in 1983.

Instead, as is the case with all authentic teachings of Buddhist tantra, they ulti-mately derive from Shakyamuni Buddha himself, the so-ailed his-torical Buddha who lived 1,soo years ago (s6J-483 B.C.E.). However, as His Holiness the Founccnth Dalai Lama has stated in Tht Wor/J ofTibn.n BwJJhism. We need not presume that all of the teachings of tantra were propounded by the Buddha during his historical lifetime. Rather, I think that the teachings of tantra could have also cmcrgcd through the extraordinary insighu of highly rcaliud individuals who were able to explore to the fullest extent the physical dements and the potential within the human body and mind. AJ a result of such investigation, a praaitioncr can attain very high realizations and visions, thus enabling him or her to receive tantric teachings at a mystical level. Therefore, when we rdlcct on tantric teachings. we should not limit our pmpectivt by rigid notions of time and space.

The principal form that Shakyamuni Buddha assumes when pre-senting the advanced teachings of tantra is that of Vajradhara--dte Holder of the Diamond Scepter-who is sometimes called the Buddha of the T antras. In general, the blessings, instructions, and realizations of these tantric teachings come down to the present via two types of lineage: the distant and the dose. The former is com-prised of the successive guru-disciple relationships that link one gen-eration with the next, the realized disciple of a panicular master becoming mentor to disciples of his or her own.

In Naropa's case, he not only received tanttic initiation, or empowerment, from his human guru, Ttlopa, but was able to establish communication with Buddha Vajradhara directly; the Buddha of the Tantras manifested to him in the form of such tantric mcditational deities as Hcvajra, Herulca Chaluasamvara, and Vajrayogini. As for Je Tsongkhapa, he was not only heir to the lineage of Indian, Nepalese, and Tibetan mastcn that spanned the four hundred years separating him from Naropa, but he also rcceivcd inspiration from Vajradhara through his own patron deity, Manjushri, the embodiment of the wisdom of all enlightened beings. Thus the teachings we know as the Six Yogas of Naropa, including the inner fire practices that arc the main subject matter of this present work, should not be mnsidercd the later fabrications of Indian gurus or Tibetan lamas but arc ultimatdy rooted in the enlightened realizations of Shakyamuni Buddha himself, passed down in unbroken lineages of realized practitioners to the present day . • THE AUTHOR AND HIS STYLE OF TEACHING Lama Thubten Y eshe began his Buddhist training at Sera Monastery, one of the three great institutions oflcaming and practice founded by Je T songkhapa and his disciples in the vicinity of Uwa, the capital of Tibet. After the Chinese takeover of Tibet in the 19sos. he com-pleted his formal training at the Buxa Duar refugee camp in north-c:astcm India. Unlike most of his fellow monks at Sera, who confined their studies to the Gelug tradition founded by Je T songkhapa, Lama Ycshe was gready interested in teachings by masters of all traditions. His open-minded, nonsectarian approach is attested to by the fact that while at Buxa Duar his own students included lamas from these various traditions. The Buddhist education Lama Y cshe received had two major divisions. The fim of these is called sum and is named after those 3"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE Bu~s oF INslR fiRE 4 teachings. or discourses-such as the PrajNiparamitli Sutras, or DiJcours~s on th~ Pnftction of Wi.ulo~in which Shakyamuni Buddha set forth the various aspects of the general path leading to full spiritual awakening. The course of study at the Tibetan monas-teries included not only these teachings by Buddha himself but the commentaries on them by such Indian masters as Chandrakini (Guitk to rhr MidJk Way). Maitreya/Asanga (Onutmt>nt of Ckar RraliZAtions). Shantideva (A Guitk to tht> BoJhiS4nva s Way of Lift). Atisha (LAmp on rhr Path to En/ighunmt>nt) and many others. Through study, debate. and meditation upon these texts and the later commentaries on them by a succession of Tibetan masters, and through intimate exposure ro the authentic oral traditions enliven-ing these texts. students at Sera and the other monasteries had the opportunity of gaining insight into and realization of the vast and profound meaning of Buddha's teachings. With the foundation in moral discipline. Iogial analysis, compas-sionate motivation, insightful wisdom. and so forth provided by these surra studies. well-qualified practitioners were able to ddvc into the second of the two major divisions of their education: the profound study of tantra. The Sanskrit term .. tantra\" is applied to those advanced teachings of Buddha ShakyamuniNajradhara by means of which the full enlightenment ofBuddhahood. the ultimate goal of all Buddhist paths, can be attained in the shortest time possible. Each tantra focuses upon a meditational deity embodying a particular aspect of enlightened consciousness; in Lama Yeshe's case, he received empowerment and instructions in such tantras as those of the medi-tational deities Heruka Chakrasamvara. Vajrayogini, Vajrabhairava, and Guhyasamaja and studied the famous Six Y ogas of Naropa fol-lowing Having thr Thru Convictions. a commentary based on the per-sonal experiences of Je T songkhapa, as cited above. He received the lineage blessings of these practices from some of the greatest tantric masters of the day, including Kyabje Ling Dorjcchang (1903-83) and Kyabje Trijang Dorjechang h901-81), the Senior and Junior Tutors, respectively. of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama (b. 1935). Lama Y eshe did not merely study these profound tantric teachings, he put them into practice in extensive meditational retreats and in his"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"JNTIODUCTION daily life. As became clear to many toward the end of his life, his main practice was that of Heru.ka Chakrasamvara, and he devoted much time and energy to gaining deeper and deeper realizations of this Highest Yoga Tantra. According to his hcan-son and disciple, Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, Lama Y cshe wrote privately about his own meditational experiences of both Heru.ka Chakrasamvara and the Six Yogas of Naropa and would often speak to Lama Zopa about clear light and bliss, the essence of these advanced tantric practices. It is not surprising, then, that the last two major teachings Lama Y cshe gave were on the inner fire practices of the Six Y ogas, through which the blissful experience of the clear light is attained, and that he opened each of these teachings with an empowerment into the tantra of Heruka Chakrasamvara. Nor is it surprising that the final practice he himself engaged in, up until his hcan stopped beating, was that of Heruka Chakrasamvara. What is panicularly inspiring, however, is that through his mastery of the blissful clear light con-sciousness dawning at the time of death, Lama Y cshe was able to pass away and be reborn in a state of full conscious control, even to the point of choosing as his future parents two students of his who had helped establish a meditation center in Spain called Oscl Ling, the Place of Clear Light. Their son, Tenzin Oscl Rinpoche, born in 1985, was recognized as the reincarnation of Lama Y cshe by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and is currendy enrolled at Sera Monastery in South India, where a number of the great Tibetan schools of learning have been relocated.

He did this to give them a wte of the inexhaustible treasure of blissful energy existing within each and every one of us right at the present moment. Although such blissful energy, by itself, cannot liberate us from the vicious circle of dissatisfaction and suffering, our ability to experience it directly-to •wte the chocolate,\" as he would often say-can have a significant and beneficial effect upon us.

The inspiration provided by such direct experience can empower our entire spiritual praaice. The courses in Italy and California, from which the material in this book has been taken, were run as meditational retreats, and Lama Y eshe' s lectures were designed to guide and encourage the partici-pants in their efforts to gain an actual experience, rather than a mere intellectual understanding, of what meditation has to offer. The emphasis was on clarifying the insuucrions of the Six Y ogas, without an in-depth examination of their historical significance or philosoph-ical basis. Because most of the course participants were already f.unil-iar with the necessary preparatory material through previous exposure to Buddhist teachings, the way was dear to focus single-pointedly on the step-by-step practices of inner fire itself. So, in a sense, TIN Bliss of lnnn-Firt is like a second IntrtN/wtion Ill T11ntr11, opening up the world of Highest Yoga Tanua's advanced practices the way the earlier work opened up the world of tantra in general. The present work, in addition to dealing with more advanced sub-ject maner, diffen from ia predecessor in that it concentrates on~ cific technical aspects of tantric practice. AJ the reader will discover, TIN Bliss of l11nn Firt offers detailed instructions on the various phases of inner fire meditation. This emphasis on meditational instruction makes the present work a valuable manual for those inter-ested in engaging in serious and prolonged practice themselves. However, because many readers will lack the background necessary for a full appreciation of these teachings, it may be hdpful to intro-duce Lama Yeshe's instructions with a few remarks about the tantric path in general and the platt within this path of the yoga of inner fire . • AN OVERVIEW OF THE PATH To begin with, the ultimate purpose of all Buddhist teachings is to lead others to enlightenment, or Buddhahood. This fully purified and expansive state of consciousness is characterized by limidess compassion, wisdom, and skillful means; the Mahayana, or Great Vehicle, teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha stress that only by attain-ing such complete awakening of mind and heart can we fulfill our"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTaooucnoN own innate spiritual potential and, more important, be of maximum benefit to othen. As already stated, the Mahayana presents two interrelated approaches to this full and complete enlightenment: the more gener-al path of surra and the esoteric path of tantra. The surra vehicle (Skt. SldriiJtlllll) sets fonh methods whereby the obscurations veiling one's innate purity of mind arc gradually removed, like peeling away the layen of an onion. At the same time, the mind's positive qualities of love, compassion, wisdom, and so fonh arc gradually enhanced so that evenruaUy one attains a state beyond the limitations of ordinary, egocentric consciousness. The trainings in nonanachment, compassionate altruism, and penetrative insight so vital to Sutrayana praaice form the foundation of the tantric vehicle as well. But T antrayana-also known as Mantrayana and Vajrayana-is distinguished from Sutrayana by being a so-called resultant vehicle. That is to say, the qualified prac-titioner of antra is empowered to take the future result of the path, the experience of enlightenment itself. as the very basis of his or her practice. In place of the ordinary, limited self-image, the tantric trainee cultivates the powerful vision of having already attained full enlightenment in the form of a particular meditational deity (Tib. yU/Itm). All the elements of ordinary experien~ne's surroundings, sensory enjoyments, and activities-are likewise viewed as having undergone a similar enlightened trarufonnacion. Everything is seen as pure and blissful, just as a Buddha would experience it. By training in this way it is possible to achieve the aaual result of full enlightenment much more swiftly than by relying on the Sutrayana approach alone. The theme of enlightened transformation pervades the vast scope of tantric teachings and praaiccs. Energies and states of mind that are considered negative and antithetical to spiritual growth accord-ing to other religious paths arc transformed by the alchemy of tantra into forces aiding one's inner development. Chief among these is the energy of desire. According to the fundamental teachings of Sutrayana, desirous attachment only serves to perpetuate the suffer-ings of samsara: the vicious circle of uncontrolled life and death, born from ignorance and fraught with dissatisfaaion, within which 7"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THI Buu or INNia F111 8 unenlightened beings trap themselves. Therefore, if one truly wishes to be free from this samsaric cycle of misery, it is necessary to elimi-nate the poison of desirous attachment from one's heart and mind completely. While the Tantrayana agrees that ultimately all such ignorandy generated desires must be overcome if freedom and enlightenment are to be achieved, it recognizes the tremendous energy underlying this desire as an indispensable resource that can, with skill and training, be utilized so that it empowers rather than interferes with one's spiritual development. Of course, any path utilizing the powerful and potentially destruc-tive energies of desire and the other delusions is dangerous indeed. If followed improperly or with a selfish motivation, tantra can le2d the misguided practitioner into realms of mental and physical suffering of unimaginable enormity. That is why even though tanttic teduUques may be oudined in a book such as this, they can only be followed safely and productively under the watchful eye of a fully qualified tantric master, and only by those who cultivate a particularly power-ful altruistic motivation, receive the requisite cmpowermcna, keep purdy their tantric pledges, and undergo the proper preliminary trainings. It is said that for those who do rely on an accomplished tantric master and observe the precepts of tanttic practice purdy, it is possible to reach the goal of full enlightenment within the space of one short human lifetime, even within a few years. Not all the tantric systems have equal power in propelling their trainees along the path to enlightenment. Instead, tantra is divided into four progressive classes-(1) Action. (l.) Performance. (3) Yoga. and (4) Highest Yoga-and it is only through the pure praaice of a system belonging to the supreme class of Highest Yoga T antra that full enlightenment can be attained in the swiftest possible manner. What chidly differentiates these four classes from one another is the varying abilities of their respective trainees to utilize desire on the spiritual path. While followen of the lower classes of tantra can con-trol and utilize only the less passionate levels of attachment-traditionally likened to the desire aroused when (l) looking at, (1) laughing with, and (3) embracing an attractive panner--the qualified practitioner of Highest Yoga T antra is one who can channel into the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INTIODUCTION path of spiritual evolution energies as intense as those associated with (4) sexual union itsdf. Harnessing desire in Highest Yoga T antra is accomplished in twO successive levels of practice: the evolutionary stage and the comple-tion stage. The former. also known as the generation stage, serves as a preparation and rehearsal for the latter and involves, among other things, cultivating what are known as the dear appearance and divine pride of one's chosen meditational deity. For example, if one is fol-lowing the tantra of the wrathful male deity Heruka Chaluasamvara, one practices overcoming the ordinary view of oneself as a limited, samsaric being and cultivates in its place the enlightened self-image of actually being this powerful deity. This not only involves gaining familiarity with the various qualities of Chakrasamvara's body, speech, and mind so that one can experience oneself as possessing these attributes, but also demands a degree of mastery in meditation upon ultimate truth: shii\"J''IIl, or emptiness. The subject of emptiness is too vast to go into in any great deal here. Suffice it to say for now that it involves ridding the mind of all falsdy conceived, fantasized modes of existence arising from igno-rance of the way in which things actually do exist. It is fundamental to all Buddhist systems of practice, whether sutra or tantra, to recog-rtize that the limited, concrete view we have of ourselves and our sur-roundings is in the nature of ignorance and therefore the source of all suffering; all such misconceptions must be overcome if we are ever to achieve lasting liberation from samsaric dissatisfaction. ~ Lama Y eshe declared in lntrtJtiiKtion to Tantr11, \"As long as we are burdened by these misconceptions, we remain trapped in the world of our own projections, condemned to wander forever in the circle of dissatisfac-tion we have created for ourselves. But if we can uproot these wrong views and barush them completely, we will experience the freedom, space and effortless happiness we presently deny ourselves• (p. 69). As stated, then, the practice of tantra involves a combination of emptiness-yoga-through which all ordinary conceptions of one-self are dissolved-and deity-yoga-in which one cultivates the enlightened identity of a panicular meditational deity. ~ the Dalai Lama points out in TIN World of Tibn.n BruJJhism, \"A unique 9"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TuE Bun OF INNf.a hat 10 characteristic of ... Highest Yoga Tantra is that it employs in its pro-found path various meditative techniques that have corresponding similitudes not only to the resuhant state of Buddhahood, that is, to the three kayas, but especially to the bases of purification on the ordinary level of human aistence-for example, death, intermedi-ate state, and rebirth\" (p. 125). These correspondences are outlined in the accompanying table and the significance of the three Buddha bodies (~) can be explained briefly as follows. The attainment of full enlightenment, or Buddhahood, is said to accomplish two purposes: those of oneself and those of others. With enlightenment comes the elimination of all obscurations of the mind, which are created by ignorance and pro-duce suffering. as well as the enhancement of limitless beneficial qual-ities such as blissful awareness and universal compassion; this perfection of consciousness completely fulfills the practitioner's own purpose for following the spiritual path. But such an extremely sub-tle, unobstructed, and fully evolved consciousness-the truth body, or dharmakaya, of a Buddha-can fulfill the needs of others only if it manifests in forms to which those not yet fully enlightened can relate. Therefore, with the compassionate motive to benefit others, there first emerges from the unobstructed sphere of dharmakaya the subtle enjoyment body (sambhogaltll)a), which only higher bodhisattvas can perceive, and then the grosser emanation body (nimuuuzltiiJII). which even ordinary beings can contact. It is through the guidance and inspiration provided by these two form bodies (rupuaya) that the purposes of others are accomplished.

INzrt/o), to rebirth-which also corresponds to the move-ment from sleep, through dreams, to reawakening-in such a way that these three times are taken into the path and regarded as the thrtt bodies of a Buddha. Although one contemplates deeply upon the increasingly subtle states of consciousness experienced during death and upon the transformations associated with the intermediate state and rcbinh, th~ changes do not actually occur at this time. Instead, these evolutionary stage practices serve as a rehearsal for the actual transformations that take place only during the advanced lev-els of the completion stage. For it is during the completion stage that one gains control over the clements of the vajra body-the subtle channels, winds, and drops existing within the envelope of the gross physical body-and with this control comes the ability not merely to simulate the death experience but to bring about the actual transfor-mations of consciousness occurring during that experience. All completion stage practices arc directly or indirectly associated with the meditative technique known as inner fire, the main subject maner of this present volume. Through mastery of inner fire, one can gain full conscious control over the vajra body and the ability to bring the mind to its most subtle and penetrating state: the blissful dear light experience. This extraordinarily powerful state of mind is unequaled in its ability to gain direct, penetrative insight into ulti-mate truth and thereby eliminate all affiictive states of mind. Through the profound completion stage practices, the activities of one's body, speech. and mind become the natural resources of unprecedented spiritual growth as all forms of desirous energy arc channeled into the path. Eventually one develops the ability to nego-tiate the hazards of death and beyond with complete awareness and control. And finally, at the culmination of the path, one attains the blissful state of unlimited awareness known as full enlightenment, spontaneously and effonlcssly fulfilling one·s compassionate inten-tion to work for the wdfiare of all other beings.

T antra and Inner Fire L ord Buddha taught the path to enlightenment at many different lcveb, in accordance with the variety of needs and capabilities of sentient beings. To give his most advanced teachings, known as Tanttayana or Vajrayana, he manifested in his esoteric aspect of Vajradhara. Tantrayana is the quickest vehicle to full enlightenment. According to Lord Buddha's general teachings, known as Sutrayana, desire is the cause of human beings' problems, so it must be avoided. According to Tantrayana, however, this very desire can be used in the path to enlightenment. On the basis of strong renun-ciation, the great compassion of bodhicina, and the right view of emptiness, tantric practitionen usc the energy of their own pleasure as a resource and, in the deep concentration of lll1111Uihi meditation, unify it with the wisdom that realizes emptiness. Eventually this gives rise to simultaneously born great blissful wisdom, which in turn leads to enlightenment. In tantra we are dealing with pleasure, not with pain. The penon who is qualified to practice tantra is able to cope with pleasure, to experience pleasure without losing control, to utilize it. This is the essential characteristic of the tanuic personality. Tantra does not work for people who arc miserable, because they have no resource of pleasure to utilize. In tannic practice, we work with the energy of our own human body. This resource is composed of six &cton: the four dements (earth, water, fire, and air), the channels of our subde nervous system, and the blissful JnmJ.lj,; drops that exist within the channels. 1 The human body is the gold mine of tantta; it is our most precious possession. 2.1"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE S1x Yo~,;As or f'AaorA 22 What we need is a skillful method to harness this powerful energy so that we can achieve not only more and more satisfaction in our everyday lives, but eventually the total satisfaction of full enlighten-ment. What we need is the practice of inner fire. Inner fire is the first subject in the set of tantric practices known as the Six Yogas of Naropa. The other five arc the yogas of the illu-sory body; dear light; transference of consciousness; transference into another body; and the intermediate state, or bardo. During this teaching, my main emphasis will ~ on the yoga of inner fire. In Tibetan we say that inner fire is 14m ltyi mang-Jo. \"the founda-tion stone of the path.\" It is fundamental to the realizations of the illusory body and dear light-to the realizations, in fact, of all the advanced completion stage practices of tantra. I will discuss this in more detail later; but, in shon, in order to achieve enlightenment we use the practice of inner fire to cause all the airs, or vital energies, within our body to enter, stabilize, and absorb in the central channel of our subtle nervous system. This leads to the experience of simulu-nrously born great bliss. This bliss-which is not mere sentimental pleasure bur a profound experience beyond our ordinary imagina-tion-is then unified with the wisdom that understands emptiness in a process that eventually leads to the union of the illusory body and the absolute dear-light wisdom, and finally to full enlightenment. Inner fire is tummo in Ti~tan. and the literal meaning of tummo is \"brave female.\" Tum means courage or bravery; mo, used in Tibetan grammar as a female modifier. represents the wisdom of nonduality. Tummo is courageous because it destroys all delusions and superstitions and female ~cause it enables our subtlest level of consciousness to realize simultaneously born great blissful wisdom. This is the essential purpose of tantric practice, and inner fire can help us to achieve it. Inner fire meditation really suits the Western mind because Westerners like to work with material, with energy. You like to play with it, fix it, change it, manipulate it. With inner fire you are doing exactly that; but the diffcrena is that you arc playing with your inner energy, your own pleasure resource. Also, Westerners like instant satisfaction. It's what you expect. Well,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"TANTaA AND INNia F1u inner fire gives you this. It is the direct path to enlightenment that you have heard about. It is a very simple process: very practical, very scien-tific, and very logical. You don't have to believe that inner fire brings bliss for it to work; you just do the praaice and get the results. The lam-rim, the step-by-step presentation of the path to enlight-enment, brings satisfaction in a more religious way; inner fire is more scientific because actualizing it docs not depend upon religious belief. If you act, the experience automatically comes. No customs or riruals arc involved. With inner fire, you arc dealing directly with your own inner reality; you arc simply increasing the power of the kundalini and heat energy that you already possess. It is amazingly powerful, like a volcano erupting from within you. The philosophy and methods of lam-rim arc presented intellec-tually, and to some extent you can be intellectually convinced. But this conviction is like a cloud in the sky. When it is there, your spir-itual practice is strong; but when the cloud disappears. you get dis-couraged, and your practice becomes weak. After being oriented towards lam-rim, when you hear that inner fire meditation is the fundamental path lading to the realization of enlightenment, you arc suddenly in a new world. Inner fire is the real chocolate! Whereas you may find it difficult to get results with other meditations, inner fire is a sensitive, quick way to convince yourself that you arc progressing. It will surprise you. When you practice it you will think, \"What else do I need? This is the only way.\" Other practices will seem second-rate. Sutrayana explains detailed meditation techniques for developing deep samadhi, but it has nothing to compare to inner fire meditation, which brings an explosion of nonduality wisdom, an explosion of bliss. Concentrating on a sensation or even on the Buddha is fine, but it can't lead you to the greatest realization of simultaneously born great blissful wisdom. Inner fire is like the main door leading into a complex of hundreds of treasure houses. All the facilities for magnetizing realizations arc there. Since it penetrates the very center of the universe of the body, it is incredibly sensitive in producing realizations. In fact, the super-stitious, conceptualizing mind cannot count the realizations brought by inner fire. It is the secret key that opens you to •0 realizations. 13"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THI Sax YoGAI o• N.noPA Even if you could stay in samadhi meditation twenty-four houn a day for twenty days, Milarepa would say to you, i\"bat means nothing! It does not compare to my inner fire meditation. • This is how he responded to Gampopa at their first meeting, after Gampopa had described his meditation experiences. There must have been a reason for Milarepa to say this. He was not just making propaganda. cxager-ating the power of inner fire. He had no partiality and bad givm up all worldly competition. Milarepa was simply saying that even remaining for many days in a deep, undisturbed samadhi meditation is nothing when compared to inner fire meditation. Inner fire is incomparable. Personally, I like inner fire meditation. I don't claim to have any realizations, but I have tried it and I am convinced. Inner fire med-itation will absolutely convince you too. It will change your entire notion of reality. You will come to trwt the tantric path through this meditation. We really need tantra these days because there is a tremendous explosion of delusion and distraction. Good things are happening in our lives, but many bad things are happening too, and we need the atomic energy of inner fire to blast us out of our confusion. In fact, without tantric practice, enlightenment is not possible. In the beginning your inner fire meditation might not be sua:css-ful. You might even have a negative reaction, such as an explosion of heat that drenches your body with sweat. However, I believe that even an imperfect result like this is still significant because it shows you the power of your mind. It is said that anybody can do inner fire meditation. If you have never done it before, it might seem difficult, but it is aaually simple . .. How can I meditate like this?• you might think. •1 am not a great meditator.

You never know what you can do; you cannot always see your own potential. Perhaps you were a great meditator in a previous life. Right now your mind might be completely distracted, but one day your potential will suddenly ripen, and you will be able to meditate. Look at Mllarepa. I doubt that you have created more negative karma than he did; he killed many people when he was young. But"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"TANTaA AND INNU Fau because of his inner strength, he was also able to develop perfect renunciation, perfect bodhicitta, perfect right view, perfect Six Yogas ofNaropa.

Sometimes those who arc succcssfu1 at samsara, who create sttong negativity, can also be successful at liberation. On the other hand, those who don't have success at samsara can't be successful at libera-tion either. My point is that you never know what human beings can do. Be brave! Try as much as possible to do the inner fire meditation. Even if you arc not completdy successful, at least you will gain some expe-rience, and that is good enough. -Let us dedicate ow energy to all universal living beings. praying that they aaualize the essence of tantra and discover the union of their own unsurpassed bliss and nonduality wisdom.

The Six Yogas and the Mahasiddha N aropa The Six Yogas of Naropa were not discovered by Naropa. They originated in the teachings of Lord Buddha and were cvenrually transmitted to the great dcvcnth-c.cntury Indian yogi Tilopa, who in tum transmitted them to his disciple Naropa. They were then passed on to many Tibetan lamas, including Marpa and Milarcpa, some of whom wrote down their experiences as commentaries on the Six Y ogas. I will be explaining the practice of inner fire according to Having UN Tin-« UJ11victions, a commentary on the Six Yogas by Lama Je T songkhapa. I will not translate the entire text, but will instead give you the essence of the teaching. Even though I am not a successful meditator, I have received teachings on this text from my gurus on at least three occasions,1 and I have tried to do the practice. As I have already mentioned, Lama Tsongkhapa lists the Six Yogas as inner fire meditation, the yoga of the illusory body, the yoga of clear light, transference of consciousness, transference into another body, and the yoga of the intermediate state. Lama Tsongkhapa explains the subjects without adding or subtracting anything. He says that all the subjects arc covered by these six topics and that anybody who expects additional meditations is ignorant of the tradition. What does he mean? I think Lama Tsongkhapa means that to teach some-thing from yow own experience that is not contained in these six sub-jects is foolish. It would be like Tibetans boasting that they can make better pizzas than Italians. Sometimes the subjects of the Six Yogas of Naropa arc classified into two, three, four, or even ten divisions. In accordance with the needs of a meditator's mind, for example, there can be three divisions: 27"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THI Sax Yoc:Aa or NAaou the practices for attaining enlightenment in this life, in the interme-diate state, and in a future life. Or there can be twO divisions: the acrual completion stage meditation subjects and the cooperative causes for developing them. For example, some of the breathing exercises arc not formally pan of completion stage practice, but they help the com-pletion stage meditations. Previously, some lamas were interested only in the actual comple-tion stage meditations and did not explain these cooperative methods. The holden ofMarpa's lincagcs,2 however, explain the various minor techniques that arc needed to help you succeed in completion stage yoga. For inner fire meditation alone, Marpa explained hundreds of technical methods. Some Kagyu texts on the Six Y ogas of Naropa, explaining accord-ing to Marpa's heritage, count six subjects: inner fire meditation, illu-sory body yoga, dream yoga, dear light yoga, intermediate state yoga, and the yoga of transference of consciousness. Other Kagyu lamas list eight yogas, adding evolutionary stage yoga and conson practice to these six. Milarcpa divides the six yogas differently: evolutionary stage yoga, inner fire meditation, conson practice, dear light yoga, illusory body yoga, and dream yoga. There arc many different ways to count the yogas. Some Tibetan texts question whether all the Six Y ogas of Naropa acrually come from Naropa. It seems that in Naropa's time there might have been six separate texts and that some ofNaropa's disciples might have later combined the six. This might or might not be true, but it doesn't really matter. History is always debatable. As long as we arc able to taste the chocolate of this practice, who cares about such academic questions? The Tibetan tide of Lama Tsongkhapa's text is Yi-cM sum Jm, which I translate as Hllvint 1M Th\"~ Convictions. Yi-ciN means con-viction, which implies that you can have confidence; sum means three; and Jm means having. In other words, this commentary has three distinguishing characteristics. The first is that Lama Tsongkhapa's descriptions of the meditations arc dean-clear and integrated. The second is that although there arc many subjects, each is presented so distinctly and dearly that it can be comprehended"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THI Stx Yocou AND THI MAHAIIDDHA NAIOPA easily by anyone with discriminating wisdom. The third characteris-tic is that in order to prove his points, Lama Tsongkhapa quotes many scriptuccs. both the rantric texts of Shakyamuni Buddha and the treatises of many of the lineage lamas. Lama T songkhapa takes great care to base each of his statements on the words of lineage lamas such as Tilopa. Naropa. Marpa, and Milarepa. He uses quotations to show how his explanations are linked to theirs and to demonstrate the long history of these teachings. He gives dear, scientific explanations and uses convincing proofs on every subject. Thus we can have confidence in Lama Je Tsongkhapa's commentary. In Tibetan, the Six Yogas ofNaropa arc called N11-ro chD JnJt. Nil-,., refers to Naropa; chD. which means dharma, can refer to doctrine or phenomena; and JrrJt means six. Some people have translated Nil-,., dHJ t/nJt as .. The Six Doctrines of Naropa\"; others as .. The Six Yogas ofNaropa.\" My feeling is that although .. The Six Doctrines· is literally correct, it gives the impression that the teachings are purely philosophical or theological. They arc not. They arc something very practical, something to be actuali.ud right now. I believe that .. The Six Yaps of Naropa\" conveys the right meaning. the right feeling. I think Naropa would be unhappy if we were to usc the term .. The Six Doctrines of Naropa. • I have reasons for saying that Naropa would be unhappy if we were to regard his Six Y ogas as purely philosophical. Naropa was a well-educated monk and the top professor at the ancient Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda. With a mind like a computer, he had vast knowledge of the sutras and tantras. He was famous as an expcn debater and was able to defeat all the non-Buddhist scholars in pub-lic encounters. Nc:venhclcss, Naropa was unhappy and dissatisfied and longed for realization. He thought to himself. ·There's something wrong. I have learned all these intdlcctual ideas and I can explain absolutely every-thing about the Buddhadharma, yet I still feel empty and dissatisfied. Something is missing. • 19"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THa S1x YoGAI o• NAaou 30 Naropa' s guru instructed him to recite one of Heruka' s mantras, O'!' hri~ ha ha hu'!' hi'!' phil!. until he found a solution to his prob-lem. Naropa recited scvcw million mantras. Then one day, while reciting the mantra, he fdt the canh shake. A voice spoke to him from space, •You are still a baby! You have a long way to go. Your knowledge is merely intellectual, and this is not enough. In order to gain real satisf.action you must find Talopa. He is your special guru. • So Naropa left the monastery in search ofTilopa. When he even-tually found him after months of difficulties, Talopa was sitting on the ground cooking live fish. He looked more like a madman than a great yogi! Nevertheless, Naropa became Tilopa's disciple. Year after year Naropa requested his guru for initiation; and year after year Tilopa would get him to perform some outrageous action, always denying him the initiation he so desperately wanted. Naropa strug-gled like this for twelve years, and twelve rimes he almost died. One day while they were walking together in the desert, Tilopa suddenly decided to give Naropa the initiation. Unable to make any other preparations, Naropa mixed his urine with sand and offered this to his guru as a mandala. Then JHl'\"-Tilopa beat him on the head with his sandal. Naropa went into deep meditation for seven days. It is good for us to hear this story of Naropa. These days we have no shortage of intellectual information, but I truly believe there is a shortage of frrtiliution. We collect so much information, but we do very little with it. This is why we have so little success in our spiritu-al practice. Many of my older students, for example, have heard the lam-rim twenty or thiny times and know everything about it from beginning to end. Y ct still they are dissatisfied. -This is why Naropa is a good example for us. Even though he was highly advanced intellectually, he had not discovered satisfaction within himself. He left Nalanda in search of a tantric master and then struggled for all those years. He practiced continuously until he achieved his goal, enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"3· The Mahasiddha J e T songkhapa In the Western academic world, the common interpretation is that Lama Je Tsongkhapa was just a philosopher. Western academia do not seem to recognize him as a great yogi, a great tantric practi-tioner, a mahasiddha. Actually, Lama Tsongkhapa taught and wrote more on tantra than on sutra; but because he did not publidy show his mahasiddha aspect, W cstcrners have the impression that he was merely an intellectual. 1 Some people think that Gelugpas, the followers of Lama T songkhapa, do not practice nonconccprual meditation. They think that the other traditions of Tibetan Buddhism meditate in this way, but that Lama T songkhapa negated nonconccprual meditation and taught only intellectual, analytical meditation. I have heard Westerners say, •Getugpas arc always intdlccrualizing. always squeez-ing their brains.• This is not uuc. Lama Tsongkhapa was already a great meditator while still a teenager. From then on, he did not experience ordinary sicknesses; when he had a small health problem, he would cure him.sd£ Also, if a Rood or an avalanche was about to happen. he would say a prayer, and the disaster would be avcned. If you read Lama Tsongkhapa's biography, you will see that he was a great mahaaiddha. Manlam Cbcnmo, the great prayer festival celebrated in Uwa for the two weeks after the Tibetan New Year, was started by Lama Je T songkhapa. 2 The monks, nuns, and laypcople of all the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism came together to make offerings, including thou-sands of butterlamps, and to say prayers. One day during the first fa-rival, the many thousands of buttcrlamps in the temple became one 31"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THe S1x YoGAS OP NAaou 32 huge mass of flame. The fire was soon out of control. Terrified that the temple might bum down, people ran to Lama T songkhapa for help. He sat down, went into deep samadhi meditation, and suddenly all the flames were extinguished, as if blown out by one gust of wind. Lama T songkhapa was able to do this through his inner fire med· italion. We Tibetans believe that when you can control the four de· ments of your own nervous system through inner fire meditation, you can also control the external dements. Lama Tsongkhapa didn't need an ordinary fire engine; with his inner fire engine, he instantly extin-guished the flames. This proves that Lama T songkhapa was a power-ful realized being. At that time he also had visions of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas, perceiving them in the skies above Lhasa. Lama T songkhapa also had no shortage of telepathic power. For example, he was once staying in a small retreat hut some thiny min-utes' walk from the place where he later advised Sera Monastery be built. Suddenly one day he disappeared, and nobody knew why. Later that same day a delegation from the Emperor of China arrived; the Emperor had heard of lama Tsongkhapa's F.une and wished to invite him to come to China, but he was nowhere to be found. No one knew the delegation was coming that day, but Lama Tsongkhapa knew, and he escaped over the mountains. This shows Lama Tsongkhapa's telepathic power, but it is also a good example of his perfect renunciation. He vomited at the thought of worldly pleasure. Can you imagine us in that situation? We would definitely accept the invitation. I can't even resist an invitation to visit a rich benefactor, let alone an emperor. Although Lama Tsongkhapa was incredibly famous, he never went to distracting places but pre-ferred to stay in isolated places in the mountains. On the other hand, we go to the most confused places, which shows that our renuncia-tion is not yet perfect. Lama Je Tsongkhapa had many thousands of disciples all over Tibet and constantly received offerings, but he had no bank account, no house, and not even one piece of land on which ro grow his food. He gave away everything he received and stayed dean-clear. Lama T songkhapa was the head of Ganden, a monastery he founded, but he stayed there as if he were simply a guest: he would arrive, receive"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THt MAHASIDDHA Jt TsoNGltHAPA offerings, give them away, then leave with nothing. Lama T songkhapa is a perfect example of someone living in accordance with Dharma. Lama Tsongkhapa's death also reveals that he was a mahasiddha. From his childhood, Lama Tsongkhapa had a special relationship with the Buddha Manjushri and received teachings directly from Manjushri. Two or three years before Lama Tsongkhapa died, Manjushri told him that he was about to die. Suddenly countless Buddhas appeared. They requested Lama T songkhapa not to die and gave him an initiation of boundless energy so that he could live longer. Manjushri then told him that his life span had been extended and prcdiaed the new time of his death. Shonly before Lama T songkhapa died, one of his teeth fell out, and everybody saw that it emitted rainbow light. He gave the tooth to Khedrub J e, one of his hcan sons, but this disappointed his other disciples, who asked if they could have some of the tooth. Lama Tsongkhapa told Khcdrub Je to place the tooth in a box on the altar, where radiant rainbow light continued to emanate from it, and every-one prayed and meditated. A week later, when Lama T songkhapa opened the box, the tooth had uarufonned into a tiny Tara image surrounded by relic pills. Lama Tsongkhapa gave the Tara statue to Khedrub Je and the relic pills to the other disciples. He also prcdiaed that aftrr five hundred years the rclia would be brought to Bodhgaya in India. This predic-tion was accurate. Although the Chinese Communists destroyed what remained oflamajr Tsongkhapa's body, some of the relics were saved and taken to Bodhgaya by Tibetans fleeing into exile in India. When Lama Tsongkhapa finally died, he died perfccdy. Fim, he put everything in order. Next, he asked one of his disciples to bring him his skullcup. He then performed the inner offering meditation and took thirty-three sips of the inner offering, a sign that inside he was the Guhyasamaja deity.3 Finally, sitting in meditation in his full robes, he died. These arc the aaions that distinguish a mahasiddha from an ordinary being. An accomplished master docsn 't have to announce, •1 am a mahasiddha.\" His aaions prove it.

On the other hand, if you don't have strong motivation now, you will end up shaking with terror and completely lose control when your death comes. If you have prepared yourself beforehand, you will remember what to do at the time of death. At one point after Lama Je Tsongkhapa had passed away, Khedrub Je was sad because he felt that Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings were disappearing. Lama Tsongkhapa had explained the entire path to enlightenment thoroughly from beginning to end, from Hinayana to Paramitayana and T antrayana, and thousands upon thousands of people had meditated upon his teachings and achieved realizations. However, Khedrub Je thought. \"Lama Je Tsongkhapa's teachings seem like a mirage. Unfonunately the Tibetan people are degenerat-ing. He taught us not to ding to the desires of the sensory world, yet people have more grasping and more desires than ever.• Khedrub Je felt very sad, and he cried and cried. He then prayed and offered a mandala. Suddenly Lama T songkhapa appeared to him in a vision. He was in a youthful aspect, seated on a jeweled throne surrounded by deities, ~ and dakinis. He said to Khedrub Je, ·My son, you shouldn't cry. My principal message is to practice the tantric path. Do this and then transmit the teachings to qualified dis-ciples.

Even though we arc degenerate, we arc very fortunate to have the chance to hear Lama Tsongkhapa's way of explaining the tantric path and to try to actualize it.

Even after you have learned lam-rim, there arc still times when you arc unclear about what you have to do. When you look at the lifestyles of the mahasiddhas, many things become dear. We can see from their biographies that intd1ectual knowledge of Dharma alone is not enough-we have to practice. There arc many stories of learned Dharma scholan having to ask for guidance from people who have not studied any of the vast treatises but who have really wted the few teachings they have received. I remember Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche, the Junior Tutor to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, saying in his teachings that when it comes to practice, many intellec-tuals have to go to beggars on the street to ask for advice. Even though these scholan may have intdlectuaUy learned the entire sutra and tantra teachings and may even teach them to many students, they arc still empty when it comes to practice. Rinpoche was saying that this is happening in the Tibetan com-munity, but it is good for us, too, to keep his words in mind. Can you imagine spending twenty or thirty years studying the Dharma and still not improving within yourself. still not even knowing how to begin to practice? You might think that this is not possible, ytt it can happen. The Six Yaps of Naropa arc not something philosophical. You have to act, so that some inner transformation takes place. The teach-ings must become real for you. Take karma, for instance. When we talk about karma, we intellectualize so much. We need to come down to earth. Karma is not something complicated or philosophical. 37"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE S1x YocAs OP NAROPA Karma means watching your body, watching your mouth, and watch-ing your mind. Trying to keep these three doors as pure as possible is the practice of karma. There arc many monks leading ascetic lives in Dharamsala in India, where His Holiness the Dalai Lama lives. Even though they arc perhaps not very learned, they spend many years meditating and doing retreat in small huts on the mountainsides. On the other hand, there arc other very learned monks who do not wam to live ascetic lives. Those living in retreat on the mountain really try to taste the Dharma, and I think they succeed. They taste the chocolate, while the famous scholars miss out. In the end, it doesn't matter who you arc; if you want to taste something, you have to go to the taste-place. It is exactly the same in the West. Many people easily gain an incredible imcllcctual understanding of Buddhism, but it is a dry understanding that docs not fertilize the bean. There arc some Western professors, for example, who have studied Buddhism for years. They have high degrees in Buddhist studies and have published books on the sutras and tantras. Yet many of them admit that they arc not even Buddhists, which means they haven't actualized what they write about. They can read Lama jc Tsongkhapa's texts and translate them using incredible words, but for them it remains mere theory. I find this shocking. On the other hand, some people have heard just a few lam-rim teachings, such as the workings of the negative mind, but they begin to look inside themselves and to meditate. The teachings gradually become parr of them. The mere intellectuals, however, think that the negative mind is somewhere dsc--up on top of Mount Everest, per-haps. They don't care about the negative mind because they think that it doesn't refer to them. Many of my students who arc interested in learning more about Dharma ask me whether they should learn Tibetan. I say to them, \"If you want to learn Tibetan, learn it. If you don't want to learn it, don't. There is plenty of information available in English and other languages.\" I have my reasons for answering them in this way. I'm sympathetic to Western students, and I've been watching them for many years. Many of my students have learned Tibetan, but after"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THI PoiNT ls TO PaACTICI they have learned it, some of them seem to practice Dharma less. This doesn't make sense to me. Tibetan is not a holy language. In every culture you learn a language-it's pan of samsara. In learning Tibetan, you learn a Tibetan samsaric trip. This is why I am not very interested in my students learning Tibetan. The important point is to taste the chocolate. No matter how small a piece you get. as long as you taste it, you will be satisfied. I remember something His Holiness the Dalai Lama said during a commentary on the Six Yogas of Naropa. He described his visit to some Kagyu monasteries, where he saw many monks who were not especially learned but who were practicing very seriously in retreat, leading ascetic lives and undergoing many hardships. These monks studied a small pan of a commentary, then immediately put great energy and effort into meditating on it. His Holiness said that, on the other hand, some Gdugpa monks are very learned but do not put much energy into their practice. His Holiness expressed the wish for there to be a balance between those who have not learned much yet put incredible energy into practicing meditation and those who arc incredibly learned yet do very little meditation practice. I am sure His Holiness was not joking, nor was he being sectarian. He was impressed by the Kagyu rctreatants. My point is that as soon as you clearly understand a subject, you should hold it in your heart and practice it. You will then taste the teaching. For example, once someone has shown you exactly how to make pizza-how to combine the tomatoes, the mozzarella cheese, the herbs, and so forth-that is enough for you to make pizza and to eat it. However, Western people are easily confused. If someone comes along and says to you, \"Oh, you don't know much! You can't make pizza because you don't know how to make curry,\" you will think that you can't cook at all. Of course, I am not saying that you should not learn Dharma well; but take whatever you learn into your heart and integrate it. In fact, according to the great Sakya Pandita, someone who tries to meditate without first receiving the teachings is like a person without arms or legs trying to climb up a steep mountain.

We might interpret the words '\"fim this, second this, third this• to mean that we have to srudy for thiny or fony yean before we even stan to meditate. Such misconceptions do exist. Suppose I ask one of my students how long he has studied Buddhadharma, and he answers, \"Ten yean., I then say to him, '\"Ten years? Ten yean' study means nothing. In order to be able to practice you have to study at least thirty or fony yean, because first you have to study for a long time, then you have to reflect on everything, and finally you have to practice day and night. Lama Jc Tsongkhapa said so.\" It is easy to be misled in this way. Understanding the three ncgativities of body, the four of speech, and the three of mind is enough for you to learn to avoid them.1 We don't need to learn the entire sutra and tantra teachings in order to practice the opposite of these, the ten vinuous actions. It is essential that we bring the correct undemanding of Buddhism into the Western world, not one bound by culrural chains.

Relatively speaking, he had not yet studied much, but he went into rcueat and had many meditation experiences. Lama Tsongkhapa's way of practicing unified listening, analytical checking, and meditation, and it also unified sutra and tantra. It is important to have a firm practice. Students who have listened to Dharma teachings for many years sometimes say, \"I am confused! I don't know where to stan.

The preliminaries themselves are also divided into two: the common and the uncommon preliminary practices. 1 W. THE COMMON PRELIMINARIES The common Mahayana preliminaries are all of the lam-rim medita-tions, such as those on the value of human life, renunciation, refuge, loving kindness, bodhicina, emptiness, and so forth. Lama T songkhapa explains that in order to actualize the Six Y ogas ofNaropa, we must first practice all these meditations. He later adds. however, that he will not give details here of the common prelimi-naries because he has already written extensively about them in his lam-rim texts. 2 Lama Tsongkhapa points out that all the lineage lamas advised their disciples to practice the common Mahayana preliminaries before doing tantric practice. He shows this by using quotations from Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, and Pagmo Drupa. Even though the prdiminaries are sometimes not mentioned as pan of the Six Yogas, these great masters always taught them before giving actual instructions on the Six Y ogas. Failing to prepare the mind in this way would be like putting too much luggage on a yak; when the yak falls down the mountain, both the yak and the luggage are lost. Also, as Milarepa put it, when the guru docs not teach in the right way, both the guru and disciple will fall over the precipice of disaster, like two yaks yoked together. 45"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"PaiLUUNARY PaACTJCU We can clearly sec from Lama Tsongkhapa's writing that he is nonsectarian. This commentary, with its many quotations from early Kagyu masters such as Milarepa and Gampopa, shows his extensive research into the other traditions. If the advice is correct, Lama Tsongkhapa doesn't care who gives it. Egotistical teachers praise their own tradition and have nothing good to say about the other orders of Tibetan Buddhism. Lama T songkhapa. however, shows great respect for the Kagyu tradition. Lama Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gclugpa order, had the opponunity to write about the Six Yogas of Naropa because of the kindness of the early Kagyu masters. If lamas such as Marpa and Milarepa had not transmitted these teachings, Lama T songkhapa would not have known about them, and we also would not have the opponunity to practice them. Lama T songkhapa emphasizes that the preliminaries are very pow-erful and that our practice will not be stable unless we do them. He says that if we don't cut the ego-games of this life, we cannot have sta-ble Dharma practice. If we don't have devotion that goes beyond our mouth, taking refuge is meaningless. If we don't comprehend karma, taking protective vows is a joke. If we haven't developed renuncia-tion, seeking liberation is useless. If we don't have loving kindness, calling ourselves Mahayanists is empty talk. And if we don't have the strong will to practice the six perfections of a bodhisanva, our bodhi-sanva ordination is also a joke. This is simply lam-rim: saying things in a different way sometimes brings comprehension. Lama Jc T songkhapa quotes Lama Atisha and Milarcpa extensively on this point about not doing Mickey Mouse practice . • THE UNCOMMON PRELIMINARIES The uncommon, or tantric, preliminaries also have two divisions: the general preliminaries and the specific tantric preliminaries, or ngorulro. The general preliminaries arc receiving an initiation (sec chapter 6) and observing the ethics of the bodhisanva and tantric vows, or S4mllJIL In the Gdug tradition there arc nine specific"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"PaauaaNG THI MIND tantric preliminaries, but Lama Tsongkhapa mentions only threel-mandala offerings, Vajrasanva practice, and guru yoga-and dis-cusses in detail only the last two (sec chapters 7 and 8) because they are emphasized in the teachings of the lineage lamas of the Six Y ogas of Naropa. Lama Tsongkhapa also points out that once we have established the preliminaries, we need to meditate on evolutionary stage yoga in order to become qualified for the completion stage practices of the Six Yogas (sec chapters 9 and 10). In Hllflint tht Thrtt Convictions, Lama T songkhapa pays consider-able attention to the tantric preliminaries. We should perform one hundred thousand of each of the tantric preliminaries, but I don't think this always happens nowadays. In Lama Tsongkhapa's time, I think his followers did the preliminaries as he advised. My assump-tion, however, is that later some Gelugpas thought, •These prelimi-nary practices with their hundreds of thousands of mandala offerings, water-bowl offerings, prostrations, guru yoga, and Vajrasanva man-tras are for people who are not intelligent. They need this kind of preparation, but an intelligent person like me doesn't.\" It is possible that you too may become proud in this way, making some fantastic, elegant statement about being a great meditator and that prostrations are for people with no brains. This view is com-pletely wrong. Also, you should not imagine that doing these preliminaries inten-sively is cxdusivdy a Kagyu or Nyingma tradition and that Gelugpas don't need to do them. This is a wrong impression. All Tibetan tra-ditions say that you must do the seven-limb practice, 4 so how can you give up prostrations? Some Gclug texts say that the most important preliminary is med-itation on the three principal paths-renunciation, bodhicitta, and emptincu-and that the other preliminaries arc secondary. You might interpret this to mean that you don't need to do the prelimi-nary sets of prostrations and so fonh, but this would be a mistake. Lama T songkhapa was a realized being, yet he still did prostra-tions. In fact, he did so many that his body made an impression in solid rock. The mark left by his body is still visible at his hermitage in Tibet. While doing the prostrations, he had a divine vision of the 47"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"PaauwJNAaY PaACTICII Thiny-fivc Buddhas of Confession.

In order to experience their power, it is necessary sometimes to do these practices intensively in retreat, just as Lama Tsongkhapa did. It is a profoundly different experience. Now, let's offer a dedication. \"May I and all mother sentient beings develop perfect renunciation, perfect loving kindness and bodhicitta, and perfect wisdom of emptiness, and thereby be qualified to practice inner fire meditation and attain mahasiddha realizations, just as Naropa and Je T songkhapa did.\""},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"6. Receiving Initiation The first of the general uncommon preliminaries, as I have men-tioned, is receiving tantric initiation. To practice the Six Y ogas of Naropa, we need to receive the four complete initiations--vase, secret, wisdom, and word-of a great initiation of Highest Yoga T antra. Merely receiving an oral transmission of a practice is not sufficient. Since the Six Yogas of Naropa arc closely connected with Heruka Chakrasamvara and Hcvajra, they arc the best initiations to receive. Lamaje Tsongkhapa mentions that before giving Gampopa teach-ings on the Six Yogas, Milarcpa asked him, \"Have you received initi-ation?\" When Gampopa replied that he had, Milarcpa gave him me commentary. Lama Tsongkhapa cites here another quotation &om an ancient tantric text, TIN DilzmonJ RoSilry T~tntrtz, which says that ini-tiation is essential, that it is the root of realizations, and that receiv-ing tantric teachings without an initiation causes both the teacher and the disciple to go to the lower realms. By showing that all the great lineage gurus advised their disciples to first receive initiation, Lama Tsongkhapa proves that initiation is a necessary preliminary to the Six Yogas ofNaropa. What is initiation? It is the beginning of the experience of medita-tion and concentration, of penetration into me nature of the reality of all phenomena. Initiation leads us into the mandala of a deity and into the torality of the experience of that deity. It is an antidote to me dissatisfied, samsaric, fanatical, dualistic mind. During initiation we should completely let go of ow preconceptions and fixed ideas of who we arc, of ow limited self-image. Instead, we need to identify with the wisdom-mind of the deity, which is ow own perfect potential. 49"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"PULIWINAIY PRACTICIS so The tantric teachings place much emphasis on great bliss as the basis of the initiation experience. Of course, if you don't have blissful experiences in your daily life, it will be difficult to experience bliss in your meditation-but we all experience happiness and bliss to some extent. The tantric teachings show us how to work with and expand our natural physical and mental resources of pleasure, and eventually how to unify bliss with the wisdom that understands emptiness and achieve liberation. Initiation docs not mean that a guru gives you some incredible power. You already h.w the qualities of profound wisdom and great bliss within you; initiation simply activates them. The quality of the initiation you receive does not depend on the guru. It depends on you. The lama giving the initiation must have received the lineage of the initiation and done the basic retreats, but the important point is the disciple's attitude. If you arc motivated by the sincere wish to transform yourself so that you will be able to ben-efit others, you should receive the initiation. It is imponant to have a dedicated attitude. In fact, according to Buddhist psychology, unless you dedicate yoursdf to others, you will never be satisfied. Instead you will be bored and lonely. It is logical that dedication to others brings you the satisf.action that you crave. To receive an initiation in order to achieve some kind of power for your own ego is not good; but to do so in order to dedicate yowsclf to oth-ers and thereby achieve something for yourself is totally appropriate. You should visualize that you arc receiving the initiation not from an ordinary human being but from the mandala deity. During a Heruka Chakrasamvara initiation, for example, you should see the lama as Guru Heruka, with a body of infinitely blue, radiant light. Even though a hundred people might panicipate in an initiation, they do not all have the same experience. Each person experiences the initiation according to their own level of skill and personal develop-ment. Actually receiving the initiation depends on the person's mind, not on their bodily participation. As I mentioned, it depends on their ability to let go of their limited self-image. Initiation is a serious business. Naropa had to wait twelve years and perform outrageous feats before Tilopa would give him an initiation."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"RICIIVING INITIATION In ancient times initiation would not be given in public to large groups of people as they often are nowadays. Only a few people would be allowul to anend at one time. And the four initiations would not be given all at once as they are now. Disciples would receive the first pan, then go away and digest it. When they had reached that panic-ular level in their practice, they would then come back to receive the next level of the initiation. It is much easier for us to receive initiation nowadays. Lama T songkhapa emphasizes that during initiation we should go slowly: penetrating. meditating. concentrating. We shouldn't be too concerned if our meditation during an initiation seems to be only at the level of imagination and not the actual experience. Simply imag-ining the experience plants seeds in the field of our consciousness, and these seeds will slowly grow. It is just like the story of the ham-burger: first someone had to imagine it, then gradually it manifested in the American culture. Al you come to understand the process of tannic initiation, you will discover the real meaning of tantra. The initiation process, in fact, embodies the aaual experience of the stages of tantric realiza-tion, from the beginning right up to the stage of mahasiddha attain-ment. The vase initiation emphasizes evolutionary yoga praaice. the secret initiation emphasizes the illusory body, the wisdom initiation emphasizes dear light wisdom, and the word empowerment empha-sizes the unity of the fully developed illusory body and dear light. The Six Yogas of Naropa explain exactly how to approach this real-ization of the word empowerment, which is the experience of full enlightenment. At the end of an initiation, you should feel that you have become enlightened. and you should make the determination, \"From now on I will nor project rhe hallucinations and concrete conceptions of my sdf-piry mind. the source of misery. Instead, I will identify with my divine wisdom-energy, the source of pleasure, and offer this to all liv-ing beings.· As long as we maintain mindfulness and don't lose control, it doesn't maner how much blissful pleasure we experience. With the right attitude, our pleasure becomes our liberation. 51"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"7· Purifying Negativities I n the view of tantra, attainment of higher realizations depends on first purifying ncgativities. There is no point in pushing your med-itation until you have done something to lessen the obstacles to real-ization. I think you often push too much. You complain, \"'I meditate and meditate, but my meditation never improves. • This happens because you have not yet created the right conditions for realizations. You need to do powerful purification practices, such as the Vajrasanva meditation and mantra recitation, which is one of the tantric prelim-inaries described in detail in H~tving tiN Thrn Conviaions. Vajrasanva is the manifestation of the purity of all the Buddhas. In general, Vajrasanva practice helps to improve both your meditation and your lifestyle. Meditate intensively on Vajrasattva whenever you experience problems in your life or have difficulty studying or prac-ticing Dharma. You can sense when you need Vajrasanva practice. Even though you mightn't have single-pointed concentration, you will definitely experience some transformation by doing just three months ofVajrasattva retreat. The Indian tantric text TN Essmti4J OrnAmmt says that reciting twenty-one Vajrasattva mantras each day ensures that neither our natural negativities nor the negativitics of breaking our tantric vows will increase. Broken tantric vows arc the most serious obstacles to realizations, making the breaking of other vows seem insignificant. The text adds that reciting a hundred thousand Vajrasattva mantras can purify every negativity. Many of the lineage lamas say that doing a Vajrasanva retreat properly can purify even the breaking of all the tantric root vows. 53"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"PaiLUUNARY PaAcncu S4 You should utilize Vajrasanva practice as much as possible, espe-cially if you have not done a full Vajrasanva retreat. You can combine Vajrasanva purification with the practice of inner fire, alternating them; they help each other. In this way you can complete the one hundred thousand Vajrasanva mantras while discovering the power of inner fire. Praaicing the tantric preliminaries and completion stage together brings success. It is good for beginners to practice inner fire in the morning and to perform ten minutes of Vajrasanva purifica-tion in the evening before going to bed. You will then sleep comfon-ably, with a happy mind. If you go to sleep with a miserable mind, you will aaivate heavy karma all night. The conventional, relative mind causes negativity to become bot-ded up and to increase. However, if you can recognize that even the concept of negative energy is an illusion and has the nature of nondu-ality, the negativity will be: lessened. Just like everything else, positive and negative are interdependent; they are made up by our own mind. Sometimes new Dharma students think, \"Oh, no! So much talk about sin and negativity!\" They think that God or Buddha created the negativity, but this is not trUe. Our own minds create the negative karma. We are the ones who think we are negative. As long as we con-sciously or unconsciously bc:lieve that we are impure, the self-pitying imagination will always be: present, and we will then do self-pitying actions because we are emanating self-pitying vibrations. That, s why purification is so imponant. To purify means to psychologically work out our situation and our karma. The best way to do this is to realize the non-self-existence of negativity and of the self. Since this is difficult to understand, how-ever, we need to do something about the psychological concepts that weigh us down. I firmly believe that negativity is shaken by reciting the hundred-syllable mantra of Vajrasanva even one time. I know it is powerful. Of course, there is a big difference between reciting a mantra correctly and incorrectly. We often recite mantras mindlessly. Reciting a hundred thousand mantras carelessly cannot be: compared with reciting one mantra perfectly."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"PuaJPYtNc NacAnvntu Lama Je Tsongkhapa describes the Vajrasanva meditation in detail in H11vi11f tiN Thrn Cot~viaiom, but I won't go into detail here as I have explained it elsewhere. 1 I will simply give you the essence of the practice. VISualize Vajrasanva and his conson seated above your head on a lotus and moon seat. Their bodies arc composed of radiant white light. Recognize the equal realizations of the male and female deities. There arc three ways to visualize the process of purification. With each visualization, you simultaneously recite the Vajrasanva mantra. In the first technique, white nectar-like milk or liquid yogun-Aows forcefully down from the hearts of Vajrasanva and his conson. It comes down through their central channels to their joined lower chakras, then down through the lotus and moon seat. Like a power-ful waterfall dropping from a great height, the nectar forcefully enters through the crown of your head and rushes down your central chan-nel, completely purifying you. All your gross negative energy, your internal garbage, is forced out through the openings of your lower body in the form of snakes, scorpions, worms, ants, or whatever else you find cffcaive. Alternatively, you could imagine the ncgativitics coming out as roosters, pigs, and snakes, symbolic of the three poi-sonous minds of lust, ignorance, and hatred. AU your gross negative energy is purified and disappears down into the canh. In the second method, the blissful nectar coming from Vajrasanva and his conson pours down your central channel and fills you from your feet up to your crown. Visualize all your impure energy being forced up by the nectar and leaving your body through your nostrils and mouth, in much the same way that water poured into a dirty glass causes the rubbish in the glass to come to the top. This second technique is more subde than the first. The third technique involves light-energy rather than liquid. This powerful blissful light is white, but with a rainbow hue. It instandy shatters the darkness inside you. The darkness in your brain chakra, your throat chalua. yow heart chakra, and everywhere else disappears without a trace.

Shakyamuni Buddha revealed the tantras and other teachings two thousand five hundred years ago. but arc these teachings real for you? He taught the Four Noble Truths, but is that enough for them to become truth for you? Shalcyamuni Buddha, Naropa, Marpa, Milarepa, and Lama Jc T songkhapa have already taught the essentials of the Six Y ogas of Naropa, but without someone to introduce them to you, arc they real for you? You may have books that explain exact-ly how to practice the Six Y oga.s of Naropa, but the results of follow-ing instructions &om a book arc questionable. T antra is highly technical, internally technical, so a teacher is essential. Someone has to show you the practices so that they become an organic experience.

When our guru teaches us the Four Noble Truths, he gives us inspiration and blessings. He makes the Four Noble Truths real for us, so that they become our own realizations.

This is logical and simple. It is not that the guru says, \"I have shown you the Four Noble Truths; you must believe in them.\" In this respect, I think the relationship between Western studencs and their teachers is better than that between Eastern students and their teachers, because no formal customs are involved. Westerners question everything, and I find this a very honest approach. If some-thing does not make sense to you, you say so openly. If something makes sense to you, you say, \"Yes, this is helpful. I will use it.\" There is no custom obliging you to answer or behave in a cenain way. If you like or don't like something, you simply say so. This is very difficult for Eastern students to do, because they feel a social obligation to behave in a cenain way. I feel the Western way is more realistic. Because of the cultural differences, Tibetans sometimes don't under-stand the devotion of Western students, nor do Westerners understand the devotion of Tibetans. Different cultures have distinctly different perceptions. I will give you an example of this. When my student Claudio is working as my attendant, he will casually ask me, .. Lama, would you like som(' t('a or coffee?\" Tibetans would be shocked by Claudio's behavior. In Tibetan culture it is unacceptable for a student to approach his teacher so informally. The approach mwt be very respectful. But what is it all about? Only a cup of coffee! Whether the student behav('s according to Tibetan or Western custom does not make it better coffee. It is just a cultural difference. Tibetans would say, \"Look at the way that Italian student approaches his teacher!

A Westerner, on the other hand, would demand, \"Lama Je Tsongkhapa said what? Why did he say that? How can he say that?

A few years ago, a learned Tibetan lama whom I had invited to teach at my Dharma center in England said to me, ·Maybe you don't really need a highly qualified teacher for Western people.

To meditate on guru yoga, visualize the essence of your guru mani-festing in the space of nonduality in front of you in the form of Vajradhara. Guru Vajradhara sits on a lotus and sun seat on a throne supported by eight snow lions. He is radiant blue in color, holds a vajra and bell, and embraces a consort of the same color. Seeing their radiant blue light-bodies in space arouses great bliss and the wisdom of nonduality within you. Blue light and space automatically remind us of nonduality. At their crown chakra is a moon scat with a white syllable D'fl on it; at their throat chakra, a lotus scat with a red d.fJ; and at their hcan chakra, a sun scat with a blue hi'fl.

Light radiates from the ~~u,. in Guru Vajradhara's hcan into the ten directions. On each ray of light we can visualize one of the lineage lamas of the Six Yogas of Naropa, such as Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Milarcpa. Gampopa, Pagmo Drupa, Buton, or Lama Je T songkhapa. These arc the masters who practiced and achieved realization of inner fire and who discovered the totality of the illusory body and dear light wisdom. When I visualize all these lineage gurus. I like to sec each of them in the aspect of a mahasiddha. Mahasiddhas have vajra bodies vibrant with blissful kundalini energy. They have no desire for external objects because they have achieved perfect samadhi and simultane-ously born wisdom. To sec the lineage lamas in this way encourages and energizes us. Merely imagining them in this aspect causes tanta-lizing, blissful kundalini to flow in the central channel. Lama T songkhapa did not actually instruct us to visualize the lineage lamas in this way, but it docs not contradict his advice. We should not think we cannot do something simply because it was not mentioned by Lama T songkhapa. The usual way of depicting Lama T songkhapa, as a Buddhist monk, emphasizes his purity. In Tusruta Pure Land. however, he has a different name and a different manifestation. 1 Also, I mentioned earlier Khcdrub Je' s five visions of Lama T songkhapa. In one of these Lama T songkhapa manifested as a mahasiddha riding on a tiger. I like to visualize him in this form. As I mentioned earlier, Naropa was originally a monk at Nalanda Monastery; he was a superintelligent professor whom nobody could defeat in debate. Later, dissatisfied with this role and with mere intel-lectual knowledge. he went in search ofTilopa. After Naropa became Tilopa's disciple, Tilopa told him to give up dressing like a maha-pandit. So Naropa took off his respectable robes and put on mahasid-dha clothes, complete with a tiger skin. The professor became a wild-looking hippie."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THe INSPIRATION oP THe Guau Even though the Gclugpa tradition places strong emphasis on ethics and monastic purity, when ordained lamas give initiations, they sometimes take off their ordinary robes and wear the clothes of a mahasiddha. When I received a Heruka initiation from one of my gurus, he came dressed like this. There arc also photographs of Je Pabongka Rinpoche and His Holiness Trijang Rinpoche wearing mahasiddha clothes. V1Sualwng all the lineage gurus in mahasiddha aspect is very powerful in breaking down our ordinary concq>ts. A different manifestation inspires a different vision. It is the same for us. If we want to engage in tantric practice, we should follow Nampa's example and give up our concern with our appearance and reputation, with the way we look and what people think of us. Perhaps we should take off our clothes and sit on a tiger skin with ashes on our body like an Indian sadhu. When Claudio and another of my Italian students, Piero, first came to see me years ago. they came dressed as mahasiddhas. When they came to the teaching, they even brought an animal skin to sit on. Different aspects can give us different energy according to our needs. For me, Milarepa is a good example. When I was studying phi-losophy as a young monk, I often read Milarcpa's biography. It made a deep impression on me and took away all difficulties. Another image that inspires me is the fasting Buddha. It is useful sometimes to look at this ascetic aspect of Shakyamuni Buddha. It makes us think, \"He was a human being like me. How did he do these things?\" -So, Guru Vajradhara is in the space in front of you.

Giving material offerings, such as money, is easy; the offering of practice is much more difficult. Milarcpa said, \"I have no worldly offerings to give my guru. I have only the offering of meditation.\" That is the very best offering.

They energize and inspire you to develop all the realizations. Because we are practicing the Six Y ogas of Naropa, we should make strong prayers for success in inner fire meditation and for quick accomplishment of the inner fire realizations; for successful medita-tion on the illusory body and for quick realization of the illusory body; and for successful meditation on clear light and realization of clear light. Or if you are feeling anxious, dissatisfied, and in need of blissful kundalini energy, pray for your entire nervous system to become intoxicated with this blissful energy and for you to realize the eternal state of bliss. After making such strong requests, visualize that all the lineage lamas dissolve into Guru Vajradhara.

Great compassion is within you; wisdom is within you; God and Buddha arc within you. If you have a dualis-tic concept that you arc down here and Guru Vajradhara is some-where up there, you will never comprehend the unity. Guru yoga is profound; it cannot be expressed in mere words. -You can undcmand the qualities of Guru Vajradhara only according to your own level of spiritual development. You cannot push and you cannot intcllcctualiu. When you understand that there arc many dif-ferent levels, the practice of guru yoga becomes quite reasonable.

Even if our most egotistical, miserable, dissatisfied mind is present, instead of expanding this egocentric mind we must recognize its dharmakaya nature, its totality-of-the-guru nature. This direct, organic energy is digested into the great wisdom of unification: \"You are the guru, you are the deity, you are the daka and dakini, you are the Dharma pro-tector.\" This is the teaching of tantra. This is similar to Christianity. which accepts one God as an embodiment of the principle of totality. The Buddhist tantras describe many deities, dakas and dakinis, and Dharma protectors, but in fact they are all embodiments of the one reality of totality.

Highest Yoga T antra is divided into two stages: the evolutionary stage and the completion stage. The practices of the Six Yogas ofNaropa belong to the completion stage. In evolutionary stage yoga. which some people prefer to call gen-eration stage yoga, we learn to identify ourselves as a Buddha, a deity, a fully enlightened being (sec chapter 10). In intensive meditation, we develop the dear and vivid appearance of ourselves as a deity and the divine pride of actualJy being the deity. In order to do this, however, we must fim practice purifying the ordinary experiences of death, intermediate state, and rebinh. This, the essence of evolutionary stage yoga, is accomplished through meditating on the three pure experi-ences of the dharmakaya (truth body), sambhogakaya (enjoyment body), and nirmanakaya (emanation body). The experience of death is to be transformed into the dharma.kaya, the experience of the inter-mediate state into the sambhogakaya, and the experience of rebirth into the nirmanakaya. The evolutionary stage practice of purifying the experiences of death, intermediate state, and rebirth happens at the level of mere imagination, not at the level of actual experience. When we think, •Now is the time of the death experience. The four elements are"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"GOING BIYOND APPIARANCU 68 dissolving,\" we are simply imagining the death process. However, when we practice completion stage yoga, through the power of con-centration we actually experience the process that occurs at death, with absorption of the four elements and all the conceptual minds. The question might arise, If evolutionary stage practice u only at the level of our imagination, why do we need to engage in it at all? Lama T songkhapa explains dearly and completely why it u necessary to actualize the evolutionary stage before engaging in completion stage practices. Some Tibetan lamas have stated that the evolutionary stage practice of actualizing the deity is not necessary and can even become an obstacle to reaching completion stage. Lama Tsongkhapa points out here in the text that misconceptions exist in Tibet that meditation on evolutionary yoga is necessary only for receiving worldly realizations and is therefore unnecessary for the accomplish-ment of the highest realization. Lama T songkhapa explains that all the lineages coming from Marpa 1 say that the fim step is to lead students through evolutionary yoga. To demonstrate this point, he quotes a passage from Milarepa, \"First you have to go through evolutionary yoga in order to cut the difficult vuions of dying, intermediate State, and rcbinh.. Many other great lamas of the past have agreed that the evolutionary stage has to be actualized as well as the completion stage. Expressing hu own opinion, Lama T songkhapa states that the proper basis for success in completion stage yoga is evolutionary stage yoga and that, as a preliminary to completion stage practice, practi-tioners should have stable concentration on themselves as the deity. Also, in general, the practice of evolutionary stage yoga should have three qualities, or flavors: all beings should be seen as deities, every experience should be inseparable from the wisdom of nondual-ity, and every experience should have the nature of great bliss. Accomplishment of evolutionary yoga is a high realization, with both gross and subde levels. With the gross level of attainment, you are able to build up a dear mental image of the: entire mandala with its var-ious deities, celestial mansion, and surrounding environment. With the subde level of attainment, you have indestructible samadhi and can vividly imagine your entire mandala. in miniature, for several hours."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"TaANuoawJNG OaATH, INTaawaoJATI STATI, AND RaaJaTH However, even though we have not yet achieved the subdc attain-ment of the evolutionary stage. we can still stan completion stage prac-tices such as the Six Yogas ofNaropa. You shouldn't fed that inner fire is a big leap. \"T d better meditate on renunciation for the rest of my life. That is more reasonable.\" Don't think this way! Lama T song-khapa. as well as many lamas of other traditions, developed the skill to practice both evolutionary and completion stages in each day. Lama Tsongkhapa's biography explains that in some sessions he praaiced evolutionary stage yoga and in others, completion stage. Training in this way helps to bring realizations. It is right to engage in evolution-ary and completion stage yogas at the same rime because they support each other. For example, sometimes you may find evolutionary stage yoga difficult, but for some reason the completion stage practices seem easier and more familiar, and touch your bean more. When you prac-tice both stages together, you taste the blissful chocolate . • BRINGING THE THREE KAYAS INTO THE PATH Lama T songkhapa strongly emphasizes that whenever we actualize a deity as the path to liberation, we must usc the technique of trans-forming death, intermediate state, and rebirth into the three kayas and bringing the three kayas into the path to enlightenment. This is the essential practice of evolutionary stage, and it fruitfully and suit-ably leads to the completion stage. How do we engage in evolutionary stage practice? Generally, regardless of which deity we arc actualizing, evolutionary stage yoga involves the practice of a daily SMilutNL The sadhana begins with tak-ing refuge and generating a bodhicina motivation to achieve enlight-enment in order to benefit others. This is foUowcd by the practice of guru yoga, the root of the entire tantric path, as I described earlier. After this, just before meditating on the three kayas, we recite the emptiness mantra O'!' nNlbhi~ Sllrv.Jh417flllb nNibhdvlliuJJho 'httm and meditate on its profound meaning. Basically, this mantra States that the nature of everything that exists is pure, that all existent phenomena, including us, are nondual in character. It is referring to the non-sdf-existencc, the noninherent existence, or the emptiness of everything that exists. This is absolute reality. Conventional reality is"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"(.;OI!\"G 8tYONO APPEAIA!\"CB 70 like a dream, a magician's trick, a projection, or a mirage. Thinking in this way as we recite the emptiness mantra dissolves our concrete concepts. Our normal dualistic mind constantly distorts reality. We either add extra qualities to reality or we underestimate it. We never seem to find the middle way. We project impurity upon the pure. \"I was born with impurities, I am impure now, I will die impure and end up in hell.\" Even if we don't consciously think this, it is there inside us. We believe we arc fundamentally impure. \"How can I be pure?\" our self-pity mind thinks. We must rid ourselves of this idea, which is the cause of all our diseases of body and mind. The point is that the fundamental nature of our mind is pure and spacdike. Ego-mind tries to project something impure on top of this, but it is impossible to add to something that is spacclikc in nature. Such impure projections arc momentary, like clouds in the sky. Even though the sky allows the coming and going of douds, they arc not a permanent characteristic of the sky. A similar relationship exists berw~n rhe fundamemal character of our mind and our dualistic mind. The nonduality nature of our mind has always been pure, is pure now, and will always be pure. What we call \"impurities\" arc the superficial douds of ego that come and go. We have to recognize that they are transitory and that they can be removed. They are simply energy. Their relative, negative, confused, fantasy nature is not our fundamental nature. Realizing this cuts off the self-pity ego. The whole point of doing meditation is to discover this funda-mental principle of totality. The moment you reach this experience of nonduality you have no room for heavy emotions or sentimental-ity. The pure, penetrative awareness cuts through relative obstacles and touches the deepest nature of human existence. At that moment of experience there is no conceptual labeling by the dualistic mind; at that moment, there is no Buddha or God, no subject or object, no heaven or hell.

We have to begin the experience of emptiness somewhere, and space is the prime exam-ple used by all Tibetan lamas to represent nonduality. The main point is that we are trying to have an experience that goes beyond mundane ego puzzles. From the philosophical point of view, emptiness has no form, no color, no smell, and so forth, and we can understand this from ow own experiences of emptiness. In the moment of experience, the sen-sory world has no way to magnetize your mind. The narrow, dualis-tic puzzles disappear, allowing the natural state of mind to radiate and embrace reality.

Stay as long as you can in this experience of omnipresent wisdom, this state of nonduality. Every tantric practice is related to something natural within our normal experience. Here, the experience of clear light is similar to the experience at the time of death, when all the gross consciousnesses, both sensory and conceptual, have naturally ceased to function.

Some texts say that at this point you should recall the bodhicitta motivation you generated at the beginning of the meditation and think, \"As long as I remain in the dharmakaya experience, nobody can see me.

You will know from your own experience when you are ready to move from the dharma.kaya to the sambhogakaya. At that time visual-ize that a blue~ appears from the space of nonduality. Or, if it is easier for you, visualize a shaft of blue light, a candle flame, or the syl-lable hw1fl. It is not necessary to do this exactly as I say or exactly as described in the texts. Be flexible in your practice; tailor the medita-tion to suit your own experience. The point is that the sambhogakaya has to have some relationship to the intermediate state, which is sub-de, so your sambhogakaya experience should also be subde.

The deity and the mandala arc manifestations of simultane-ously born blissful wisdom. There arc different traditions concerning the deity to visualize when you practice the Six Y ogas of Nampa. Some lamas use Hcvajra. some Vajrayogini, and others Heruk.a. There arc also different traditions of Heruk.a, such as the lineages of Luhipa and Drilbupa.

And even though in general you should visualize the 75"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Go1Nc BnoNo APPUIANCIS elaborate form of the deity during evolutionary stage practice, if you find so much detail distracting, just visualize yourself in the simple form of the deity. This is sufficient in the beginning. You have arisen from the sambhogakaya as the nirmanakaya form of Hcruka, with a body of radiant blue light. You are sanding, have four &ccs and twelve arms, and are embracing Vajravarahi, who has a body of radiant red light. You need to have a dear and vivid appearance of yourself as the deity, visualizing every detail as precisely as you can. When you begin your meditation session, focus your attention at the top of the deity's body and slowly move downward, contemplat-ing one area at a time. Then move from the bottom to the top. Once you arc f.uniliar with the visualization, hold in your mind the com-plete image of the deity, focusing neither too tighdy nor too loosely. Eventually your visualization will be perfect. Also, remember to ener-gize bliss and nonduality. Don't worry if you find it difficult to sec yourself as Heruka in the way he is depicted in Tibetan paintings. Your body is already beauti-ful and handsome, so leave it as it is and simply change its color. Actually, seeing yourself as a deity has nothing to do with Tibetan culture. You think you arc not involved with a culture when you pro-ject your usual self-pity image of yourself, but in fact you arc. Instead of seeing yourself in that way, transform yourself into blissful, radi-ant, blue light and cultivate strong divine pride. The special charaacristia of Heruka arc universal love and compas-sion. We all need love and compassion, don't we? We arc craving for someone to love us and take care of us. Hcruka manifms our archetypal ideal so that we can identify ourselves with the energy of universal love and compassion and actually become universal love and compassion. Our worries about whether or not someone loves us disappear when we generate the strength of love, compassion, and wisdom. You can sec how this works in your everyday life. No one wants to come near you when you arc full of self-pity or having a nervous breakdown. People fccl uncomfortable around you. But when you arc full of love and compassion, you can't keep people away from you. This is natural. Because we arc looking for happiness, we don't want to go near miserable people."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"AIUING AI A OIVINI BIING Heruka's face is handsome but slighdy wrathful, laughing but also frowning slighdy. Why is universal love and compassion depicted in this way? Because this is what we need. When we receive even a little bit oflove, we become emotional and out of control. That's not good. because the other person can't handle you when you are like that. There needs to be a middle way. Tantra teaches us that we need powerful transformation. Identifying with the profound qualities of Heruka and seeing our-selves as infinite, radiant, blue light arc powerful methods for elimi-nating self-pity concepts and garbage-imagination. What is our main problem? It is that we think, .. 1 am the worst person in the world. I am full of hatred, desire, and ignorance. • These concepts arc totally negative, and you must purify them.

Obsessed with your own shoncomings, you put tremendous pressure on yourself. You punish younclf by regarding yourself as ugly and wonhless. Other people may think you arc beautiful, but still you project your-self as ugly. T antra says that essentially every human being is divine and pure. This is why it is important to identify yourself so strongly as being a deity, to regard yourself as perfectly developed. Instead of seeing your body as something miserable, transform it into a radiant blue Iight-body. Outwardly this might seem strange, but inwardly there is a profound meaning. Blue light symbolizes nonduality, so the moment you visualize this blue light, which is like clear blue sky, your dualistic, concrete concepts break down; you no longer believe in them. This is not a philosophical point or a matter of blind &ith-you can experience it. From the tantric point of view, each color we per-ceive-blue, red, yellow, or whatever-is directly related to what is happening in our internal world. It is important to be aware of this. The radiant blue light of Hcruka helps us to touch reality, which is the most important thing in the world. The Herub mandala expresses inner and outer reality rather than a fantasy world of pro-jections. Most of us arc unaware of reality; we never touch it. n"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"GoiNG BuoNo APPURANCIS Western actors explain that when they play a panicular role in a movie, they have to go through some of the experiences of that per-son in order to express his feelings and actions realistically.

Your psychic energy has to transform convincingly into the blissful, radiant blue Iight-body of Heruka. W csterners often have a problem with deities. They think. \"Why should I see myself as Heruka? This is just another fanwy, another delusion. It is difficult enough for me just to be a man or a woman. I have enough uouble in this world with my complicated views of who I am and of how to relate to a man's world or a woman's world.

Heruka is within you. To ask why you need to manifest as Heruka means that you don't understand that the quality of the deity is the quality of your own being. To recognize and comprehend your profound qualities, you visualize yourself as Heruka rather than identifying with your usual feelings of being ugly and unwanted.

However, it is our mind that puts us in a miserable concentration camp, not our body. The point is that the mind is powerful and can manifest anything. When you can convincingly see yourself as be2utiful and handsome, your self-pity concepts will vanish and you will become the manifes-tation of your own profound qualities. Everyone can achieve this.

However, when we arc practicing inner fire meditation in an intensive retreat, we can cut down on words and prayers. This means that in order to arise as Hcruka, we can usc the short sadhana T~ Yoga of tht Thrtt Purifications, which contains both the Vajra-sattva and Hcruka meditations. I have not made up this shortcut approach. His Holiness Trijang Rinpochc, an actual manifestation of Heruka, mentioned this during his teachings on the Six Yogas. The point is that when you arc actu-alizing completion stage yoga, because you arc spending most of your time in intensive meditation, you don't need many words. This makes sense. Reading too many prayers can cause you to lose the real taste of the practice. Taking a shortcut like this out of laziness is not acceptable; but if you are meditating intensively on completion stage, you have no time to read pieces of paper. Sometimes people are so caught up in details that they lose the overall picture. For example, if you have to recite twenty-four sadhanas every day and each sadhana takes you an hour to recite, what is the result? You cannot practice the Six Y ogas of Naropa in this way. When you read your sadhanas, you have to look at the pieces of paper; but when you practice inner fire, you just have to dose your eyes. I also think that it is not necessary to read all the words of a sad-hana if you perform all the meditations. If you remember the process from beginning to end and have a complete mental picture of all the meditations, you do not need to read the words. Once you have performed the meditations, what is there left to do? Words can defi-nitely be an obstacle. However, even if we usc a shortcut method, we still need to make the meditation rich.

The Characteristics of Body and Mind We come now to the actual teaching on the completion stage yogas. Lama Je T songkhapa begins by describing the basis of these yaps, the body and the mind.

Although there is no sig-nificant difference, Western people might find the second approach easier. Therefore, I will fim explain the nature of the body and then that of the mind . • CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BODY Lama T songkhapa actually explains the characteristics of the body in a way different &om other commentaries, and we can cover this later (sec chapter IS, p. 117). I will now explain them according to the other commentaries. The body can be said to exist simultaneously on three lcvds. These att the gross body, the subde body, and the very subde body. The gross body is composed of the blood, bones, five sense organs. and so forth. The subde body, also known as the vajra body, comprises the channels and the energy-winds and drops that exist within the chan-nels. There att thousands of these subde physical channels running throughout ow body. The main ones that we use in meditation are the central channd, which runs up and down our body just in &ont of the spine, and the two side channels, which run alongside the cen-tral channel. At various poina along the central channel, smaller channels branch off to form channd wheels, or chartu. I will discuss the channels and chakras in more detail later (sec chapter 14)."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"GoJNC BuoNo APPIAIANCIS The energy-winds, or airs, that we arc discussing do not refer to the air that we breathe in from the outside world, but to the subtle winds that flow throughout our channels. These subtle winds enable our bodies to function and arc associated with different levels of mind.1 In tantra there is a saying, '\"The mind rides on the wind.\" This means that our consciousness is mounted on the winds; they always move together through the subtle channels. We arc working with and learning to control these winds during inner fire meditation. Our vajra body also contains subtle liquid energy, the red and white drops. The Tibetan word for these drops is tigk, but I prefer to usc the Hindu term ltunJ4/ini because it is more universal. The tantras also refer to the drops as boJhidttll. Actually, in Tibetan we say ltun-dlz dtl-bu jang-snn, which translates as \"moon-like bodhicit-ta.\" Although these red and white drops arc always together in all the channels, the female red drops predominate at the navel chakra and the male white drops at the crown chakra. (Some tantric praaiccs speak of the kundalini drops as deities; they say that dakas and daki-nis dance throughout the nervous system.) The third aspect of the body, the very subtle body, manifests at the time of death. After the absorptions of the four clements comes the experience of the three visions: the white, red, and black visions. After these, the clear light of death arises. The subtle states of consciousness that experience these visions, referred to as \"the four empties,\" arc simultaneously accompanied by subtle wind energy, the most subtle being the wind that accompanies the clear light mind in the inde-structible drop at the heart chakra. This subtlest of winds is the very subtle body. When the yogi or yogini arises from the experience of clear light wisdom, this very subtle wind manifests as an illusory body. With achievement of the illusory body, a very high attainment, there is total unity of body and mind. At present we don't have good com-munication between body and mind. Our bodies and minds have dif-ferent energies and arc not unified with each other. Understanding the subtle body and the very subtle body helps us to recognize that we have other bodies within us in addition to our physical body-so we don't have to worry too much when our gross body is degenerating or being uncooperative."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THa CHAaAcTaauTICI or BoDY AND MIND The tantric teachings also explain the germination and evolution of hwnan beings: how the consciousness in the intermediate state per-ceives the male and female energy of the parents and is attracted to it, then enters the fenilizcd egg. k I described earlier (sec chapter 9), in tantric meditation you visualize the male and female energy as a white moon with a reddish hue and yourself as radiant light that lands in the center of it. This corresponds to yow own rebirth. Western explanations of how the egg and sperm enter the mother·s womb and of the subsequent development of the fetus are ~ry simi-lar to those in the tantric teachings. I was amazed at the similarities when I saw a television documentary about this process. Tibetans ha~ the words but not the visual presentation; W estemers put it all on film. Sometimes I don •t know what is going on in your minds cul-turally, so I hesitate to tell you certain Buddhist ideas. Seeing this film, however, encouraged me. Tibetans explain how the fetus dcvd-ops, with the wind energies pushing this way and that; how the heart chakra is the first chakra to develop; how the channels grow from there; and then how the other channels develop. We have detailed explanations of how energy develops and functions to coordinate the internal and external. Also, the Kalachalua T antra gives ~ry interesting explanations about the relationship between the sun, moon, stars, and time, and between internal energy and the external universe, as well as advice on how to meditate on these things. We have incredibly detailed infor-mation about all of these subjects. 2 It is important to learn these kinds of scientific details, and this is illustrated by the following story. Vasubandhu and his brother Asanga once had a competition to sec who could best describe a calf that was still in its mother's womb. Asanga investigated telepathi-cally and saw that the calf had a white patch on its forehead. V asubandhu, however, undcmood how the body of a calf actually lies in a row's womb; he realized that his brother had made a mistake bccaUJC he could not integrate the information he had received tele-pathically.

When the calf was born, it was seen that Vasubandhu's scientific understanding had won over Asanga's telepathic power. It is very useful to understand the nature of the vajra body and how it functions, because you can then learn to manipulate its differ-ent energies. You can learn how to approach the pleasure centers and misery centers and how to switch them on and off. For example, if you arc familiar with your entire nervous system, you can alleviate any pain you experience. To release tension in your upper body you might have to massage a point in your lower body. By knowing the interrelationships within your body, you can relieve the discomfon. According to tantra, pain in a panicular area of the body is often due to energy blockages, which in tum arc related to blocked states of mind. If you understand the fundamental structure of your body, you will know how to release any tension that arises. Your body is organic, and you n~d to learn to listen to its rhythms until you feel that each cell in your nervous system is talking to you. When you develop such sensitive awareness of your body, it is almost as though you can tell it what to do. Instead of clomping around heavily, your whole body feels light and blissful, as if you are walking on air. It is liberating. Simply touching yourself will produce bliss. We have that resource. Instead of being a source of pain, your entire body can become a source of bliss. You reach a point where your body and mind cooperate so perfectly that you feel body is mind and mind is body. There is an incredible sense of unity. We pay a lot of attention to our body. However, we concentrate our effons merely on externals, such as cleanliness and appearance. In the Six Yogas ofNaropa we arc dealing instead with the subtle body, the vajra body. By utilizing various meditation techniques, we learn to control the energies of this vajra body, especially the wind energy; and because the mind rides on the wind, we arc able to direct the mind wherever we want. Eventually we can direct it to enlighten-ment. This is why it is imponant to educate ourselves about the nature of our subtle nervous system."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THt CHAIIACTflliSTJ<;S Of BoDY AND MIND • CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIND The mind also has thrtt divisions: the gross mind, the subtle mind, and the very subtle mind. The gross mind is composed of the five sense perceptions, which arc very limited, crude judges of phe-nomena. The subtle mind includes the six root delusions, the twenty branch delusions-in fact, all the eighty conceptual minds.3 These minds arc subtle in the sense that it is difficult to understand their characteristics and functions. It is difficult for us to understand how they hold concepts and how they bring the various problems of life. Ul's take the example of desire, one of the six root delusions. We do not really understand what desire means. In the West, desire seems to refer to sense gratification. However, in the Buddhist view, desire is not a craving of the senses but the mental concepts and projections that we build up on an object, thereby bringing us problems. Desire misinterprets and distons the object; we then hallucinate and drive ourselves crazy. I am always skeptical when somebody says that they know the meaning of desire. It is not easy to understand desire. I think it is very difficult, and it takes time. If you know the nature of desire, you can really control your mind because you arc able to question and to understand your own view of desire's objects. Otherwise, you cannot sec the mind's tricks. With its constant \"I feel, I want,\" desire plays tricks on you, leading you to a constant restlessness that can mess up your life. Desire makes countries confused: the East and the West arc confused because of desire; the Middle East is confused because of desire. Husband and wife arc confused because of desire. Even disci-ple and teacher can be confused because of desire. Don't arrogantly think that you know everything about desire. To really understand desire, you have to put much time and effon into investigating it with strong meditation. With meditation, you can definitely understand desire; without meditation, you cannot. You can listen to explanations about desire for a year, but you will still only understand it intellectually. To comprehend desire you have to go inside yourself and build a solid understanding there. It is not enough to have some dull, vague understanding."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"GoiNG BuoNo ArruaANCIS 88 The third aspect of the mind is the very subtle mind.

Unifying Relative and Absolute Some texts on the Six Yogas of Naropa describe various charac-teristics of the gross, subdc, and very subdc minds, and I have also described them briefly. In Havint 1M Thrtt Convictions, how-ever, Lama Tsongkhapa emphasizes that the fundamental point is to understand the absolute nature of the mind, which is emptiness. He therefore goes into this topic in great detail. Lama T songkhapa begins by quoting from Th~ Hnajra Tantrll in T W() S«tions, which says that there is no mind that perceives form, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Lama T songkhapa interprets this to mean that the mind docs not have an innate, self-existent charaacr. However, the mind docs exist relatively as an interdepen-dent phenomenon. Lama T songkhapa says that non-self-existence is the original charaacr of all phenomena, including the mind. He points out that it is not that phenomena arc fint self-existent and then become non-self-existent by means of logical reasoning. This is not the case, although it almost seems as if it is. Non-self-existence is not simply some philosophical idea but Lord Buddha's scientific explanation of the nature of all phenomena. The mind is essentially pure and free from duality. Some schools of thought regard unimportant phenomena as non-self-existent, whcrca.s they sec important phenomena such as the mind as absolute and therefore self-existent. However, in Nagarjuna's view, there are no exceptions; all phenomena are non-self-existent. Buddha has the same lack of self-existence as a garbage bag. There is no such thing as a self-existent, or dualistically existent, Buddha. The totality of a garbage bag, the totality of Buddha, and our totality are one."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"GoiNG BnoND APPeAaANcas According to the Buddhist point of view, mind is the creator of the world. It creates everything, including our happiness and our prob-lems. Y ct even the potential of the mind to create phenomena docs not have a self-existent character. This potential exists because of the nondual nature of the mind, because of the unity of the mind's absolute, non-self-existent nature and its relative, interdependent nature. This nature is not something that we have to invent; it is already there. We just have to realize it. In Having tht Thrtt Convictions Lama T songkhapa also quotes one of Marpa • s songs, in which Marpa describes how he traveled cast ncar the Ganges River, where he met his guru Je Maiuipa. Through Maitripa's great kindness, Marpa discovered the fundamental \"non-growing\" nature. This refers to non-self-existence, or emptiness. Marpa continues, \"I beheld the face of the clear light of the subde consciousness, saw the three kayas, and cut through all relative, con-ventional puzzles.\" Lama Tsongkhapa then quotes Je Maitripa, who says in Tm &fkaions on Simpk Suchnm that anyone who wishes to find the proper understanding of reality, of emptiness, should not follow the philosophical doctrines of the V aibashika, Sautrantika, Chittamatra, or Svatantrika-Madhyamaka schools. The teaching on emptiness to follow is that of the Prasangika-Madhyamaka, as expounded by Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti. Compared to their interpretation of emptiness, all other views seem second-rate. An understanding ofNagarjuna's experience is especially important for success in completion stage yogas such as the Six Yogas ofNaropa. Of course, a proper understanding of the Chittamatrin and Svatan-rrika-Madhyamakan interpretation will take you part of the way. The main point to understand is that in an absolute sense the mind is empty, or non-self-existent, while relatively it exists in depen-dence upon causes and conditions and so forth. All the phenomena of samsara and nirvana, including the mind, exist like an illusion, a dream, or a reflection in a mirror. Even though it is sometimes said that something is nonexistent because it is like an illusion, a dream, or a reflection in a mirror, this is not philosophically correct. It is speaking loosely to say, \"This phe-nomenon docs not exist because it is an illusion. It is just one of my"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"UNifYING RILATIVI AND AasoLUTI projections.\" In fact, the reverse is true. The phenomenon exists pre-cisely because it exists as an illusion, which is interdependent. A reflection in a mirror is also interdependent; it exists because of the mirror. Also, you cannot say that the mind and the objects of the illusory world are nonexistent in the way that the hom on a rabbit, s head is nonexistent. The rabbit's hom docs not exist even relativdy, but the mind docs. Lama Tsongkhapa is saying, '\"Wait a minute. Stop! You arc going too far.\" There is a danger that we won't undemand the unity of relative and absolute existence. Our problem is that we arc too extreme. T alee a tissue, for exam-ple. The minute we say that the tissue exists, a self-existent projection comes to our minds. When we then talk about the nonduality of the tissue, the tissue seems to disappear, and we have the impression that the tissue cannot even function as a tissue. This is not the way it is. In the space of nonduality the tissue is made, bought, and used. The tissue is nonduality. We think that the tissue is functioning in a concrete, self-existent way, but Lama Tsongkhapa docs not agree at all. It has a subjective origin and an objective, non-self-existent character within it; there-fore, it functions. Nor can you say that non-self-existence is here in this space and you then put the tissue into it. Non-self-existence is unified with this tissue. Nonduality totally embraces every pan of this tissue. When we describe the nonduality. the non-sdf-cxistence, of the tissue, it is not that the tissue is fim sdf-cxistent and that we then push philosophically to make it non-self-existent. There is no way to push. Lama T songkhapa is going to say that because the tissue exists in its own panicular way, it has the characteristic of nonduality. Every activity. from coming together ro breaking apan, happens because of the universal reality of nonduality. It is the same with every movement of energy-growing, interacting, transforming. Within the movement of energy, there is no self-existent motion. Pan of my nature is this tissue·s nature; pan of your nature is tissue-paper nature. You probably don't want to have tissue-paper nature, but in an absolute sense, there is no difference bctwccn a tissue's nature and your nature. 91"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"GoiHG BevoNo APPEARANCES 92 Sometimes we push too much when we apply logic in order to understand emptiness-\"This is non-self-existent because of this and that reason.\" By simply looking at a situation, hownoer, we can sec that the situation itself expresses nondualicy. This is why Lama Tsongkhapa says that dependent-arising is the king of logic: \"This tis-sue is non-self-existent because it is a dependent-arising.\" Nondualicy docs not mean nonexistence. A tissue exists relatively because it functions. You can touch it, usc it to wipe your nose, and then throw it away. It comes and goes. In that sense it exists conven-tionally, but it docs not have the solid existence that it superficially appears to have. Even though it appears to exist dualistically, it docs not have a dualistic way of existing. To say that something exists simply means that it functions, that conventionally it does something. That is all. It is momentary and it functions. But when we talk about absolute nature, we arc speaking about a broader view, a bigger view. The absolute nature of a thing is pan of you, part of me, pan of mozzarella cheese, pan of chocolate. Existence is for the relative mind only. Even good and bad exist in dependence on the mind, the time, the situation, the environment, and so fonh. For example, perhaps at one time it was considered good to give a potato as a gift, but nowadays a person who received such a gift would be shocked. Good and bad arc relative. But at the same time there is a broader real icy within the space of a thing. When you experience the totality, the nondualicy, of a phenomenon, it is like space. Here in Having tiN Th\"~ ConviaionJ Lama T songkhapa quotes Milarcpa: .. The omnipresent Lord Buddha explained that all phe-nomena exist only for those of unintelligent mind.\" What docs he mean by \"unintelligent\"? Milarcpa is referring to the narrow, relative mind. According to the absolute view, there is no Buddha, no subject of meditation, and no meditator; there is no path, no wisdom, and no nirvana. There is nothing. All these arc merely labels, names, words. This means that there is no u/faistmt samsara or nirvana.

There would also be no karma; and if there were no cause and effect, how"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"L'NifYtNG RHATIVE AND A•sotUTI! could there be samsara or nirvana? Milarepa's point is that all sam-sara-phenomena and nirvana-phenomena exist only for the conven-tional, relative mind. Lama Tsongkhapa agrees that Milarcpa's interpretation of relative and absolute is perfectly correct. Lama Tsongkhapa has a wonderful way of putting things togeth-er. In this text he describes the characteristics of mind, both relative and absolute, in an unusual and profound way. The way he points out the unity of the conventional and absolute reality of all univer-sal phenomena is incredible. He really wants us to understand this unity. Lama Tsongkhapa doesn't mention it as such, but I think that unifying the relative and absolute is the most subtle point in the Buddhist teachings. If you don't use his explanation intelligently, however, it will not mean much to you. You need to think deeply about it, read about it, and meditate on it, then gradually you will understand. Why docs Lama Tsongkhapa place such great emphasis on nondual-ity? In order to discover simultaneously born bliss through inner fire meditation, you must let go of concepts of concrete self-a.istence. Without some comprehension of nonduality, you may produce heat and bliss, but you will never succeed in inner fire. This is because you will lack wisdom, which means the right view. Most times when we experience bliss, we end up with the wrong view. Pleasure is not a bad thing in itself. but for most of us it just pro-duces misery and trouble because we lack wisdom. Tantra emphasizes taking pleasure without hesitation. digesting it, and turning it into the great blissful wisdom of nonduality. We need to be realistic. We live in a fantasy world and fail to touch our fundamental narure. We suffer from a shonage of wisdom. This is why a technique that helps us to touch the fundamental reality of nonduality is most imponant for us, and why Lama T songkhapa emphasizes it here. Through it we can experience everlasting simulta-neously born bliss. We should all practice touching reality in our daily lives.

In his text on the Guhyasamaja empowerment, Lama Tsongkhapa explains that even though we might not yet have a profound under-standing of emptiness, it is sufficient in the beginning to have a gross sense of it as being spacelike in nature. Je Pabongka, a real manifes-tation of Heruka, also comments that even if we don't have much intellectual undemanding of emptiness, it is enough to stan with the belief that there is no concrete existence. Lama T songkhapa talks in an earthy way and at our level. Since we do not yet fully understand Nagarjuna's point of view, we have to work at our own level. Lama Tsongkhapa, Je Pabongka, and the other great lamas are very practical. They teach us in a simple way, like teaching a baby, and gradually lead us to perfection. -We should now dedicate our positive energy ... May all sentient beings touch their fundamental nature.

I will also explain vase breathing later (sec chapter 16). Now I will talk a little about the exercises. and then I will explain the meditations on the channels, chakras, and syllables.

In order to be successful in inner fire meditation, we need to clean up our nervous system, and these exercises do this by force-fully removing the blockages of energy in the body. They arc espe-cially useful for practitioners of inner fire who have done the meditations too strongly. During a retreat, for example, they arc practiced in the breaks between meditation sessions. They arc also useful for anyone who is meditating a lot and not doing much phys-ical exercise. Some yogis and yoginis in Tibet performed the exercises naked; others wore a costume a little like a swimsuit. The pants were blue, which is symbolic of Hcruka, with a red waistband, symbolic of inner fire. You cannot do the exercises properly in ordinary clothes. It is best to do the exercises when your stomach feels empty and comfortable. Begin each session by taking refuge, generating bod-hicitta, and meditating on Vajrasanva. Then, visualiz.ing Guru Vajradhara and the lineage lamas, meditate on guru yoga and recite the prayer to the lineage lamas. Arise from emptiness as Heruka with conson. Your Iight-body is radiant, completely empty, and as clear as crystal. Vasualize the three principal channels and the four chakras (sec chapter I<J). Everything is dean-clear and transparent, and there arc no blockages in any of the channels. With this awareness, you then perform the exercises. Maintaining awareness of yourself as the deity, even while doing these physical exercises, is extremely important. Don't think of yow-self as an ordinary person who is just pretending to be the deity. Fed strongly that your body is the deity's body, yow speech is the deity's mantra, and your mind is great blissful wisdom. This stops the self-pity mind. Do not lose the divine pride of being this illusory deity, nor your comprehension of yourself as nondual. This makes the exer-cises very powerful.

You should breathe slowly, not quickly, during the hatha yoga. Do the vase breathing in a reasonable way, holding your breath according to your ability. If you have to breathe in again at some point during an exercise, breathe through your nostrils, not through your mouth. In the beginning the exercises may seem difficult, so take your rime with them. Doing them too strongly or too quickly will only exhaust you and tax your nervous system. Perform each exercise care-fully and correctly, so that it feels blissful. There is no point in rush-ing through them just to get a reputation for doing all five exercises in one breath. This is not a competition. You are doing something constructive and beneficial, so take your time. Lama T songkhapa says that the body should be loose during the exercises. With practice, your body will eventually become completely flexible, like rubber. This will not happen immediately, of course; but if you do the exercises every day, you will definitely experience the benefits. And remember to shake your body well in the final exercise at the end of the hatha yoga session because this hdps the blood to circulate better and the channels to function well. Some people mistakenly think that it is most imponant to meditate and to take care of the mind, but that the body is not very imponant. In tantra, however, the body is as imponant as the mind because the body has the resource ofkundalini energy, and this kundalini-uranium can be harnessed to produce powerful realizations. This is why we have a tantric vow not to criticize or neglect the body. Tantra says that you should take care of your body, keeping it healthy and giving it good food, because you need to have tremendous energy. Giving your body more protein, for example, increases the blissful kundalini power. Respect your body. Don't think that it is just a source of prob-lems.

Imagine that your entire nervous system, from your feet up to your crown, is blissful. There is no space for pain and misery in either your body or your mind. You could say that the purpose of Tibetan yoga is to make it impossible mentally and physically to have space for misery. A Gelugpa lama wrote that a sign of having gained control over the mind is that the body and its nervous system become conducive to meditation. In other words, your realizations show in the way you coordinate the energy of your body. This is quite impressive, and hatha yoga helps you to accomplish this. The exercises awaken your entire nervous system and bring you bliss twenty-four hours a day. Therefore, the body is definitely something to be respected. You could say that one of the things you arc trying to do when you meditate on inner fire is develop awareness of your body. You are learning to communicate with your own physical energy, especially your heat energy and pleasure energy. You are learning to find the right buttons. The dispensing machines in the West are good exam-ples. You just go to the machine and push the right button. You want Coca-Cola? Here is Coca-Cola. You want coffee? Here is coffee. In a similar way, when you know your own body, you can get whatever you wam from it. You don't need to look outside for anything once you have discovered your own pleasure centers and kundalini power. This is why orgasm is used as a symbol for the experience of ever-lasting bliss. Lama Tsongkhapa's text mentions this. According to tantra, the resource of orgasm is something good; we can learn from it. The point of all these physical exercises is to increase desire and blissful kundalini energy, but not for samsaric pleasure.

The point is that we lose the strength of our kundalini energy, and that is not good. Ordinary physical exercises usually increase superstition, but these hatha yoga exercises can help us to develop nonsuperstitious wisdom. It is possible that while doing one of the exercises, you will simply touch some pan of your body and go straight into deep samadhi meditation.

This process leads to the union of the illusory body and clear light, and finally to full enlightenment. One of the first praaical steps we need to take to achieve this result is to learn about the structure of the vajra body, especially of the channels and chaluas. We have to visualize them in meditation until we arc totally familiar with them. To prepare for visualizing the channels and chakras, we need to visualize our body as hollow, or empty. This meditation is simple but very important. When you do it well, there is less chance of experi-encing difficulties later when you investigate the channels and chaluas.

The four that we utilize most during inner fire meditation are the navel, hean, throat, and crown chakras. We should learn to visualize these four chakras; we should hold our mind on each of them until we eventually penetrate them. Lama T songkhapa says that the navel chakra is red, shaped like a triangle, and has sixty-four branch channels that bend upward from it, rather like the ribs of an upturned umbrella. The heart chakra is white, shaped like a ball, and has eight branches that point downward toward the navel, like the ribs of an upright umbrella. The throat chakra is red and also shaped like a ball, with its sixteen branch channels OJXning upward. Finally. the great blissful chakra at the crown is multicolored and triangular. and its thirty-two branch channels OJXn downward toward the throat. The two sets of branch channels opening toward each other in this manne-r symbolize-s me-thod and wisdom. The-triangle is sym-bolic of the wisdom-female energy and the circular shape symbolizes male energy. I have seen Hindu drawings with a triangle at the navel, just as Lama T songkhapa describes here, but sometimes the navel chakra is drawn with a circular shape. My feeling is that the shatx is not very important. Use whichever shape you feel comfortable with. Drawings can be useful to demonstrate the chakras and channels. Some Tibetan lamas have made drawings according to their own visions, but these can be difficult to understand because it is not possible to depict exactly what is seen in a vision. Lama T songkhapa explains that in general the branch channels should be visualized as extremely small, but in the beginning it is bet-ter to visualize them as having whatever size you find comfonable. If you cannot visualize all the branch channels clearly, simply concen-trate on the center of the chakra. Lama T songkhapa also explains that the side channels loop around the central channel at each of the four principal chakras, thus forming"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"CIUNNI'I s ANil CIIAIOIA!\\ knots.

Some tt.·xts say that the navel chakra should he visualized directly behind the navel. Ltma Tsongkhapa says clearly that the navel chakra is f(mr finger-widths below the navd, where the side channels curve: into the central channel. Other texts agree. This location is quite logical and convincing. \\Vhen you check, you notice that there is not much feeling at the navel itself, but there is incredible feeling four finger-widths below the navel. However, since the central channel is not located at the front of the body but close to the spine, you should visualize the navel chakra dose to the spine. The location of the navel chakra is important because the airs from the two side channels have to c:mc:r the centr.tl channel cxact.ly at this point. There are also doubts about the location of the crown chakra, which is also called the bliss chakra. Literally, \"crown\" refers to the top of the head; therefore, the crown chakra is sometimes said to be between the skin and the skull at the crown of the head. In my opin-ion, howe\\·er, this chakra is in the brain, where there is much active energy. This is where the bliss center is located. Some texts call this the head chakra, but we could also call it the brain chakra. In any case, visualize this chakra somewhere between your eye-brows and your crown, at a point more toward the back of the head. It doesn't need robe in a precisely designated place. \\X'e are dealing with psychic reality, not physical reality. However, from your own experience you will slowly discm.-er the exact location within your body of all the chakras. Your practice will then become more precise. The throat chakra is located directly behind the Adam's apple. The heart chakra is in the center of the chest midway between the two breasts and, again, is more toward the spine than the front of the body.

As well, there is the middle secret chakra, also known as the jewel chakra, which is white and has eight branch channels: and there is the tip secret chakra, which is at the end of the penis, where the central channel ends. A question might arise: The secret chakras of the male body are explained very clearly, but what about the female chakras? A woman also has three secret chakras: the secret, middle secret, and tip secret. For a woman, however, these tlm.·c arc hidden inside her body. The rip secret chakra, where her cenrral channel ends, is at the end of the cervix where it opens into the vagina.2 Tht• man's organ is outside, but the woman's is held inside.

From the brow chakra you go back into the central channd to the crown chakra and look down at the throat chalua. Again go to the throat and observe its sixteen branch channels. Go down to the heart and look at the eight branch channels there. Continue down to the navel and sec clearly each of the sixty-four branch channels. Next investigate the secret chakra, the jewel chakra, and finally the tip secret chakra. Finally, return to the hcan. Make the journey up and down the central channel many rimes, always ending up at the hcan chakra. You should not be concerned that visualizing the three channels continuing down below the navd in this way will conflict with the inner fire meditations. Here we arc simply investigating everything as preparation for the inner fire meditations. In any case, later when we practice the four joys, we will need to visualize the central channd going all the way down to the lower chakras. Meditate in this way until you are completely familiar with your channels and chakras. Eventually. you will know exactly where every-thing is. just as you know where everything is in your purse. Imagine that as you travd up and down the central channd, the rainbow light of the kundalini drop hdps to regenerate and activate the channels. Blocked channels arc opened. crooked channels arc straightened. and wrinkled ones arc smoothed. Everything becomes rainbowlikc. All the channels become as soft as silk, transparent, and serviceable, almost as if they would do anything you tell them to do. When you do this meditation, you should not keep your con-centration for too long at the hcan chakra. As I mentioned earlier, Lama T songkhapa warns that staying too long at the hcan chakra can create dangerous tension. In fact, you should also not spend much time at the throat or crown chakras.

Blissful Syllables R emembcr that you have a body of radiant rainbow light in the form of Heruka. It is not crowded with blood and bones, but is empty and has dear channels and chaluas that arc free from all blockages and confusion. In the previous meditation, you traveled to all the chakras and investigated their structUre. You are now ready to put a seed-syllable in the center of each of the four main chakras. This will be your object of concentration. Lama T songkhapa says that placing seed-syllables in the chakras is vital to generating the four blisscs. Eventually, when the kundalini at our crown chakra melts and flows down the central channel, because we have already concentrated on the letters at each chalua, we will be able to hold the kundalini longer at each point. We will thus inten-sify the experiences of bliss there. You should place the lcncrs right in the center of the four princi-pal chakras. The syllables should be visualized as small and as subde as possible, the size of a mustard or sesame seed. Lama T songkhapa emphasizes that they should be subdc. This encourages the airs to enter automatically into the central channel and to absorb strongly. Because of this, your concentration will be stronger, and you will therefore ~nerate stronger bliss. First we place a syllable in the navel chakra. W c put there the short a, or in Tibetan a tunt (sec next page), which looks like the final stroke of the Tibetan letter a ( ~ ).

His Holiness Trijang Rinpoche also said that visualizing the syllables closer to the spine allows the inner heat to grow more gradually, strongly, and profoundly. It is not good to have the heat rise extremely quickly, like an explosion. Next place a blue hu,., with a crescent moon, drop, and nada on a moon disc at the heart chakra.

When you contemplate the short a (and the other syllables), your consciousness should completely unify with it. It looks so enticing that you just want to merge with it. Lama Tsongkhapa states that we should not sec the syllable ·out there\" and ourselves separate from it. Instead, we should become completely unified with each syllable. AU the letters should be very bright and in the nature of kundalini. Lama Tsongkhapa says that they drip with kundalini, like dew.

During the waking state, the navel chakra is important for the practice of inner fire and the crown chakra for con-sort practice. This is because at these times the subtle energy drops abide at each of these points. Lama T songkhapa also discusses the view of the Kalachakra T antra, which says that the navel and brow chakras arc associated with waking state practices and that the throat and secret chakras arc imponant for practice during dreams. Lama T songkhapa then gives his own views. He says that as we go to sleep. the winds gather strongly at the hcan and jewel chakras and that we remain in deep sleep as long as they remain there. (The drops and winds also gather strongly at the jewel chakra when we arc in deep sleep; this is why men sometimes ejaculate then.) During heavy sleep we do not dream. Once the sleep becomes lighter the winds also become lighter; they gather at the secret and throat chakras, and at that time dreams come. When the air energies move to the brow and navel chakras, we wake up. Even though these chakras arc fundamental to practice during sleep and dream states, this docs not mean that they arc not impor-tant during the waking state as well. Lama Je Tsongkhapa says that penetrating and contemplating each chakra brings its own panicular results and realizations. In the system of practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa, however, everything is approached through the navel chakra. ~ In all the meditations on the channels and chakras, we are advised to visualize them as clear and rainbowlike. In reality, however, at the moment they are not like that at all. Our side channels adhere to the central channel, squeezing and blocking it. The channels arc often shriveled and wrinkled, and there is much crowding and confusion at the chakras where all the smaller channels branch out. How arc the chakras loosened and opened so that the air energies can enter the central channel? How do the channels become clear and rainbowlikc?

Breathe in slowly and gently through both nostrils until your lungs arc completely filled, visualizing that the air is filling the two side channels. Remember not to inhale through your mouth and to bring in a complete breath. Although some lamas say to breathe in strongly, Lama Tsongkhapa emphasizes that the inhalation should be very slow and very gentle. In the second step. visualize that the right and left channels arc filled with air, like inflated balloons. With the third step, while holding the breath, you swallow a little saliva, tense your diaphragm, and press firmly down. Feel that these downward movements push the inhaled air all the way down the two side channels to the shon a at your navel chakra. You might need to cxen a little force to hold the air there. Then, still holding your breath and pressing down with the diaphragm, tighten the lower doors by contracting your pelvic mus-cles. This brings up the lower airs to embrace and unify with the upper airs at the navel chakra. Feel that the shon a is magnetizing the air energies, drawing them all into the central channel. Imagine that the upper and lower airs unite precisely at the shon a, 2 which is in the central channel in the navel chakra. (The reason this breathing tech-nique is called vase meditation is that the shon a is held by the upper and lower airs as if it were in a vase or a teapot.) Hold your breath and tense the upper and lower muscles for as long as you can. Don't think that the process is complicated or that you will have difficulty doing it. Many things seem to be happening at the same time, but the main steps involve bringing the airs from above and below and unifying them at the navel chakra. Rather than forcing the process, you should feel that the shon a automatically draws all the airs into the navel chakra. Good concentration helps all this to happen naturally. Finally, we come to the founh step. When you can no lon~r com-fortably hold your breath, you should exhale through your nostrils, visualizing that the unified upper and lower airs held at the shon a shoot up the central channel like an arrow. They completely absorb inside the central channel, energizing much bliss. 123"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"AwAKENING TH£ VAJMA Boov 12.4 You should exhale slowly at first, but toward the end of the expi-ration breathe the air out forcefully until your lungs feel empty. Although Lama Tsongkhapa's text docs not mention to breathe out strongly (in fact, he advises us to release the breath gently and quietly}, I have seen many lamas do it this way. While some lamas say that you should visualize the air leaving the body at the crown, Lama Tsongkhapa says that it should be kept inside the central channel. This is understandable since our main aim is to have all the winds enter, stabilize, and be absorbed there. From the navel chakra the air goes to the heart, throat, and then crown, but it does not exit from the crown chakra. l(~ Although we visualize all the air going into the two side channels when we breathe in, our purpose is to fill dte central channel, not the side channels. In order to accomplish this, we bring the air down completely and hold it below the navel, where· the side channels enter the central channel. When we swallow saliva and then milk the airs from the side channels into the cenual channel at the navel chakra, the central channc:l automatically opens, and all the airs from the side channels enter imo it. When the side channels are open and functioning, the central channel is closed; and when the cenual channel is open and func-tioning, the side channels are closed. Lama Tsongkhapa says that these are the only alternatives. According to Lama Tsongkhapa's experience, holding the unified upper and lower airs at the navel chakra can be uncomfortable in the beginning. with the abdomen sometimes becoming a liule bloated. He explains, however, that with practice the discomfort passes and the abdomen naturally shrinks. Some people might fed that they cannot bring the airs from above and below to unify at the navel chakra; others might feel that their abdomen is too small. The solution is not to force anything.

Without any effort, you visualize that the short a forcefully draws the airs from the two side channels, as well as from all the other channels, and from above and below, into one unified absorption.

You could also experience strong heart pal-pitations, suffer cold sweats, or feel sick. Don't strain. Just practice in a relaxed and nanual way. Perform the technique slowly and gendy, and allow the process to develop in accordance with your personal capacity. Everyone's body is different. Some people have large stom-achs, others small; some have large channels, others small. Everyone should breathe according to their individual proportions. In any case, the process is the same.

A lama can instruct you in the techniques, but you should decide from your own experience what works best for you.

Lama Tsongkhapa's commentary actually says that vase breathing is not absolutely required for success in the inner fire meditations. You can breathe with small natural breaths, yet deep down you hold the energies. Holding the upper and lower winds together at the navel chakra is the key to success in inner fire meditation. You should practice vase breathing over and over again. until you can do it cffonlcssly. It is not a difficult technique; in filet, it is unbelievably easy. A sense of bliss arising from the secret chakra will indicate that you are making progress. Even performing the vase meditation without much concen-tration will induce bliss. You don't need to be a great meditator. All you have to do is practice, live peacefully, control yourself, relax, and you can experience blissful energy even without good concentration. ~ Vase breathing can also be used as a way to extend your life span. It is said that each of us takes a fixed number of breaths during our life, and if we can learn to control our usual rapid breathing and breathe more slowly. we can prolong our life. Also, I think that slowing the rhythm of our breathing slows down our nervous system, and then our mind automatically slows down as well. In this way our concentration spontaneously becomes much stronger and our mind less distracted. There arc various ways to assess your progress in vase breathing. Kagyu practitioners have a method of timing the vase breath in which you touch one knee, then the other, then your forehead, and finally snap your fingers three times. This cycle is counted as one unit of measurement. Being able to do 1o8 of these while holding a vase breath is considered a sign of great success; seventy-two indicates middling success; and thirty-six, small success. The Kagyu texts explain that this success is only from the point of view of a beginner.

However, there is a big difference between the nonsu~rstitious wis-dom of Hinayana and Paramitayana and the blissful, simultaneously born wisdom of tantra. Lama Tsongkhapa points this out very clearly. Inner fire meditation is the most powerful way to achieve blissful, indestructible samadhi. This is iUustrated by the story I mentioned earlier of the first meeting between Gampopa and Milarepa. Gampopa told Milarepa that he had such deep samadhi meditation that he could meditate for many days without distraction or slug-gishness. Milarepa simply laughed and said, 'Tm not impressed by that! Dear son, there is no comparison between my tummo short 11 and your indestructible samadhi meditation. I don't know why you're so proud of it. You cannot get olive oil by squeezing sand. My inner fire meditation is incomparable.\" Milarepa was not speaking out of egotistical pride. Inner fire med-itation is very special. As Milarepa put it, sitting for many days in a conventional samadhi is like trying to get oil by squeezing sand. This is impossible. Inner fire meditation, however, quickly produces the real oil. Milarepa is talking from his own experience. Inner fire meditation is far more effective than ordinary deep meditation. It quickly grows into an explosion of nonduality wisdom, an explosion of tdepathic power, an explosion of realizations. It is the key to countless treasures. Why is inner fire meditation such a powerful way to achieve blissful samadhi? First, its meditation object is not external, but inside your own body. Second, it is located in the central channel.

Focwing on the con-centration object, the short ll, which is you yourself, in this pyramid leads to indestructible concentration. There is no movement and no distraction. Penetrative concentration at the navel chakra is the foun-dation that makes everything else possible. A founh point that makes inner fire special is that it generates such incredible bliss that your mind simply wants to stay at the pleasure center at your navel. It has no desire to go outside to anything else. Inner fire bums up your dissatisfied energy, bringing you total phys-ical and psychological satisfaction. In any case, how can your mind move from the navel chakra once the vase meditation has forcefully brought the winds to the short It? Your mind rides on the wind, so if the vehicle is not moving. the mind cannot go anywhere. It has no choice; it has to stay there. In this way, with inner fire meditation we quickly attain indestructible samadhi . • PREPARING fOR INNER fiRE As I mentioned earlier, your stomach should be empty and comfon-able when you do the inner fire meditation. Also, you need to keep your posture erect so that the energy of your entire body is strong. Your meditation will not work if you have a sloppy posture. Keeping your body upright and slightly tensed brings about unity and com-munication from the toes to the crown. Start the meditation by dissolving yourself and everything else into emptiness, and then arise from emptiness in the form of Heruka. Suongly identify with being the deity, having a body of radiant blue light, a rainbow body, or a crystal body. Recognize that you, Heruka, are a reflection of the simultaneously born wisdom of nonduality. Suddenly Guru Vajradhara appears in the space of nonduality in front of you. He is embracing his conson, and their bodies of radiant blue light energize you with great bliss. Recognize Guru Vajradhara as the deity, the daka and the dakini, and the Dharma protector. 133"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"DucovEaJNG ToTALITY 134 Vajradhara is surrounded by the lineage gurus of the Six Yogas of Naropa: Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Milarcpa, Gampopa, Lama T song-khapa, and the others.

They energize us and give us great inspiration to develop the realization of inner fire.

In order to achieve this totality, you arc now going to practice the yoga of inner fire.

The red O'fl at the throat chakra and the white ha'!' at the crown communicate with each other, arousing the unity of bliss and nonduality.

Breathe in gendy. slowly. and com-pletely through both nostrils. Feel the air filling the side channels. You can visualize the air as blue or smoke-colored if you like. Also, imagine that air is drawn in through all the pores of your Hcruka body, not just through your nostrils. Swallow a little saliva, and with that downward movement, press the air down to the navel chalua. Then tighten the muscles of your lower doors so that the lower air comes up to the navel chakra to unify with the upper air. The short 11, which is your consciousness, has the magnetic power to draw into itself not only the wind &om the right and left channels but also the wind &om all the pores of your body, from the upper and lower chakras, and &om all the ten directions. Be sure to visualize this because it will give you a strong feeling that the winds have aaually entered the central channel. 135"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"DucovaaJNC ToTALITY The airs heat the short a intensely. just as blowing on a coal fire makes it hotter and honer.

Blissful kundalini drips down from the throat chakra through the bean chalc.ra to the short a, causing the fire to blaze even more intensely. Breathe in again.

Continue your practice until you reach that point. _.,INNER HEAT, ORDINARY HEAT Correct inner fire meditation definitely produces heat. If you use these meditation techniques taught from the experience of Tibetan lamas, there is no doubt that inner heat will come. There is no way that the heat will not come. The real inner heat gained through concentration melts the kun-dalini in the central channel, and this produces bliss, which is then used to understand nonduality. The unified bliss and wisdom of non-duality consumes superstitions and ego conflicts. We do not have bamboo, pine, or olive trees to burn as our inner fuel, but we do have plenty of ego garbage and superstitions. The main function of inner fire is to burn all our delusions and superstitions and allow a non-superstitious, simultaneously born great blissful wisdom to grow. All nonconducive energy is burned by the inner fire, and only the useful energy remains. Our meditation causes tremendous energy to be absorbed into the central channel, which automatically draws in all the garbage from the other channels. Upon entering the central chan-nel, this negative energy is transformed and perfected so that it can no longer harm you. Lama T songkhapa explains that the real inner heat stans very gently; the heat is very small and very subtle, and it starts deep within the body. It is also heavy heat. Although the Tibetan word used to describe the quality of the heat translates literally as \"heavy,\" it doesn't mean heavy in the ordinary sense.

The main point, however, is to concentrate single-pointedly on the sbort a and devdop stable inner fire in the central channel. This tech-nique leads eventually to the experience of simultaneously born bliss. ~BLISS AND NONDUALITY Whenever heat begins, bliss begins. This is because of the power of the absorption of the winds, the power of the short a, the power of concentration, and the power of the melting of the drops within the central channel. You really taste the chocolate when all these factors arc gathered together. During inner fire meditation, it is important to recognize the bliss-ful nature of any heat-in fact, of every physical and mental sensa-cion-that arises. You should also recognize its nature of nonduality, clarity, radiance, transparency, and its reflection-like quality, so that the bliss itself becomes the wisdom of nondualiry. Also, whenever you experience nondualiry, you should recognize its blissful character. As soon as we feel any bliss, we should put effort into generating the wisdom of nondualiry. This is important from the very begin-ning. The bliss itself should be digested and transformed into wisdom. Bliss becomes wisdom, wisdom becomes bliss. Otherwise, the experi-ence becomes one of ordinary pleasure, an explosion of emotional desire and superstition. If we constructively build up the unification of bliss and nonduality, there is no danger of this happening. If you don't have a strong comprehension of the non-self-existence of the bliss, there is a danger of experiencing overwhelming desire when you are not meditating as well. \\'(Thenever you open your eyes, many objects will magnetically attract you because your desire is aroused.

This comes about because we do not understand the fundamental nondual nature of existence. Without this understanding, inner fire meditation can produce tremendous sensory energy. If we arc not careful and do not channel the energy in the right way, inner fire can produce tremendous desire. However, this docs not mean that we should not have pleasure. We should have pleasure! We can have incredible pleasure, but it has to be controlled so that it can be transformed into clean-dear pene-trative wisdom. It is good for human beings to experience pleasure, but it is wrong to experience it without wisdom. The unique quality of tantra is that it always unifies the male energy of bliss with the female energy of wisdom. These two must always occur together. We must put cffon into ensuring this, because for so long this has not been our habit. Remember, the right inner fire should bring the unification of bliss and the wisdom of nonduality. It is dangerous to forget this, because inner fire meditation is a very sensitive technique. Something will definitely happen, and if good things arc not happening. bad things surely will . • UNCONTROLLED KUNDALINI According to Lama T songkhapa, to melt the kundalini at the crown dTcctivcly, the inner fire must be ignited at both the navel and secret chalms and the winds must absorb into the central channel. This brings the yogi or yogini the experience of the four joys. He points out that ordinary people, whose airs have not even entered the central channel, can also experience the melting of kun-dalini when the navel and seem chakras arc energized. This is what causes ordinary orgasm. Some people experience this uncontrolled ftow of kundalini during meditation. Simply by performing the vase breathing meditation, they experience blazing of the inner fire and melting of the kundalini. Blissful kundalini seems to come from everywhere, like falling rain. When this happens, there is danger of 147"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"0Jscov£RJNG ToTALITY losing control of the kundalini energy. A man, for example, would lose semen. Lama T songkhapa says that it is not desirable to have the kundalini flow uncontrollably. It is not correct to do inner fire meditation in the morning and have the kundalini Row spontaneously in the afternoon. There is a danger that it will merely increase ordinary physical desire. Because kundalini is the main resource that we use in inner fire meditation, it is imponant for both males and females not to lose their sexual energy. Naturally, as beginners, we will find it difficult to control the energy when we experience it strongly; we have limited concentration and have not yet learned how to bring the airs into the central channel. As Lama Tsongkhapa explains, it is not good to lose too much kundalini energy during meditation, but it is natural to lose a little occasionally. Don't panic and think, \"Oh, I have lost some kunda-lini energy. Now I have broken my vows.\" When you are a beginner, you sometimes lose kundalini drops. Don't worry about it. I lose it som~tim~. and I don't worry about it. Losing a small drop of liquid during your meditation causes no real damage or loss of strength. It does not make you unable to facil-itate the kundalini. However, experiencing orgasm through sexual contact or during sleep will cause loss of this facility and damage your strength. You can discover this through your own experience. When you lose kundalini energy strongly in meditation, the significant point is not that you are breaking your vow but that you are losing the strength of your kundalini. The physical exercises and concentra-tion will help you to develop control. Control ofkundalini energy is important even in ordinary orgasm. You cannot have a perfect orgasm if you cannot control your energy. It is the same in tantra. You cannot experience perfect bliss if you can-not control your energy. The fact is that if we lose our energy, we have no energy to utilize. In order to use energy, we need energy. If we don't have it, we cannot use it. This is logical, and you can see it dearly from your own experience. When you concentrate well and control your energy, you can experience more bliss, which you then unify with the wisdom of nonduality."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"GooD THINGS AND BAD THINGs CAN HAPPIN If kundalini stam to flow uncontrollably during your meditation and you begin to experience orgasm, try as much as possible to hold it and have it expand inside the secret chakra. Try to hold the energy there as long as possible. The longer you can hold it, the more plea-sure you will experience and the more possibility you will have of uti-lizing that pleasure by unifying it with tht universal reality of nonduality. In this way, you learn to control your body as well as your mind. By the way, the semen that comes from the male sex organ during ordinary orgasm docs not come from the central channel. For both males and females, the energy and bliss of ordinary sexual experience docs not come from the central channel. You should be clear about this. Tht bliss of ordinary orgasm is produced by tht kundalini touching the outside of the central channel. In the logic of tantric yoga, if the kundalini entrgy gtnerates such bliss when it touches the outside of tht central channel, there is no question that it will generate incredible bliss when it flows inside the central channel. Bringing all the winds into the central channel gives rise to an experience of incomparable super-bliss. Drawing the airs into the central channel and activating this bliss is mainly accomplished through the power of concentration. Therefore, someone who loses kundalini energy because they arc liv-ing the normal life of a layperson can still be successful in the prac-tice of inner heat yoga as long as they can maintain strong concentration during inner fire meditation. This is logical. Naturally, those who have weak concentration and also lose physical energy in this way will find it difficult to generate strong blissful energy. Practitioners who experience uncontrolled leaking of kundalini before the airs have absorbed into the central channel must remem-ber to bring the energy back up the channel before completely losing control. Lama T songkhapa points out that practitioners who lack strong concentration will find the kundalini more difficult to control the lower down it flows, especially if it flows below the navel chakra.

VISualizing yourself as a deity, you sit in the full lotus position with your head bent a little for-ward.

Another technique is to visualize that the inner fire moves down-ward and pwhes the kundalini back up in the same way that heat pushes up water when you boil it. Waves of blissful energy come to the heart chakra and spread throughout it. The blissful waves then continue up to the throat, crown, and brow chakras and spread through each of them in tum.

Simultaneously Born Great Blissful Wisdom • CAUSING THE WINDS TO ENTER, STABILIZE, AND ABSORB Success in inner fire meditation causes all the winds to first enter the central channel, then stabilize, and finally absorb there. What is the sign that the air energies have entered the central chan-nel? Normally, the passage of air is stronger through either the right or left nostril, alternating between the two. However, once the airs have entered the central channel, the breath moves equally through both nostrils. Lama Tsongkhapa says that even after gaining a constant signal that the energies have entered the central channel, we should continue the meditations until the process happens dfonlcssly. However, even when our concentration is single-pointed and the airs enter the central channel dfonlcssly, we need to expand our expe-rience until the airs have become stabilized and then totally absorbed in the central channel. What is the sign that the airs have become stable? As the energies stabilize in the central channel, breathing becomes subtle and sub-dued, the movement of breath through the nostrils stops completely, and the abdomen ceases to move. This indicates that there is no movement of air in the two side channels. At this point, in the Western medical view the yogi or yogini would be regarded as dc:ad because breathing has stopped. But don't worry! We can take in air in many other ways, including through the pores of the body and the c:ars, for example. Western doctors may not know of these phenomena, but this organic breathing is a fact. 157"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"DucoveaiNG ToTALITY When yogis and yoginis gain control over their internal wind ener-gies and can direct them into the central channel, they also develop control over the external wind energies. This is illustrated in the story I told you earlier about Lama T songkhapa going into meditation and extinguishing the fire from the buttcrlamps in the Uwa temple. Tibetan lamas believe that the way in which Lama Tsongkhapa stopped the fire has great significance. If we arc successful in inner fire meditation and learn to control our inner winds, we will also be able to put out fires with our meditation. And we will be able to go through solid maner. such as mountains. The third phase in the process is absorption of the air energies in the central channel. By the time the winds have entered the central channel and stabiliud there, our concentration and bliss would be very powerful. The energies then begin to absorb, and we experience the stages of dissolution that happen naturally at the rime of death. With dissolution of the four clements, we experience the vilions of a mirage, smoke, fireflies, and a flickering flame. followed by the white, red. and black visions. and finally the dear light. In this way we bring all the experiences of the death process into our life. It is common for meditators to be afraid that they arc dying when they first experience absorption of the energies. The sinking of the four clements has a negative connotation because it is normally fol-lowed by death, and we don't want anything to do with death, do we? But the yogi or yogini brings that experience into the here and now and transforms it into something blissful.

When we do usc them corrccdy, we can produce the everlasting satisfaction of simultaneously born great blissful wisdom . • THE FOUR JOYS Our goal, our destination, is to experience simultaneously born bliss and to unify it with wisdom. There arc many dcgrttS of bliss, but what we want is the completion stage experience of bliss, in which the winds have entered, stabilized, and utterly absorbed in the central channel. The power of the inner fire and the force of the absorption of the airs cause the kundalini at the crown to melt. It then flows slowly down the central channel to the throat, hcut, navel, and tip secret chakras. Success in bringing the kundalini down the central channel through these four chakras gives rise to the four joys. The founh joy is the experience of simultaneously born bliss. This bliss is unique to tantra and cannot be developed without the physical kundalini energy. Lama Tsongkhapa is clean-dear on this point. We first hear about the four blissful states of kundalini energy during Highest Yoga Tantra initiations. They arc joy, great joy, extra-ordinary joy, and simultaneously born joy. During initiation we only imagine these four blissful states, but through inner fire meditation we can actually experience them. The entire process of ~nerating the four joys begins with pene-trative concentration on the short a. This activates the inner fire, which causes the winds to enter, stabilize, and absorb in the central channel. Lama Tsongkhapa says that the inner fire must be ignited at both the navel and secret chakras. This causes the kundalini at the crown to melt and flow slowly down the central channel. Lama T songkhapa points out that the kundalini flow is naturally slow because of the strength of the wind absorption. A prolonged flow of energy is what we arc seeking. Your crown chakra is energized and your entire brain is blissful. The kundalini flows like honey down to your throat chakra, and you feel jtiJ. The throat chakra is filled with bliss. Penetrate the throat 159"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"D1scovt:RJNG ToTALITY 160 chakra. holding the energy there and feeling bliss unified with the wisdom of nonduality. The kundalini then slowly flows from the throat to the syllable hii'!' at the hean chakra, where it activates grtat joy. Again, stay there, expc:riencing this special bliss and unifying it with wisdom. Slowly the unified male and female energy of the kundalini flows down to the short a at the navel chakra, where it arouses txtraordinllry joy. With this blissful mind, meditate on emptiness. Feel that you touch the totality of universal reality. From the blissful navel chakra, the energy flows down into the secret and middle secret chakras, filling them with blissful kundalini. Gradually it reaches the tip secret chakra and arouses simullllnMus/y born joy. This founh joy is the peak bliss, super-bliss. This simulta-neously born bliss totally unifies with nonduality and actually becomes the wisdom of emptiness, the experience of clear light. For a qualified practitioner, once the winds have entered, stabi-lized, and absorbed in the central channel and the kundalini has melt-ed and come all the way down to the tip secret chakra, there is no way to lose the kundalini drops. Because the winds that normally move within the body have been absorbed, there is nothing to propel the kundalini out of the body. It is imponant to understand Lama Tsongkhapa's thinking on this point. The yogi's or yogini's concentration, and therefore control, guarantees that the kundalini will flow properly. As the energy flows slowly down the central channel. it is definite that the profoundly blissful experience of the four joys will arise, culminating in the com-pletion stage simultaneously born bliss when the kundalini reaches the tip secret chakra. It is explained elsewhere that, with the four elements already absorbed, the white vision appears as the energy enters the secret chakra. The red vision appears when the kundalini reaches the mid-dle secret chakra, and the black vision just before it reaches the tip secret chakra. Finally, the yogi or yogini experiences the totality of dear light when the energy enters the tip secret chakra.

The Sutrayana experience of the wisdom of emptiness c~annot he compared with the experience of this subtle consciousness embracing nondualiry.

If you have a strong orientation toward the Sutrayana way of understanding emptiness, the tantric way of actualizing emptiness could seem almost like a distraction or an interference. Sutrayana speaks of emptiness in quite different terms. It explains it with a negating approach, almost as a nihilistic experience.

Becoming Vajradhara • EMBRACING A CONSORT According to Lama Tsongkhapa, meditators arc qualified to practice with a conson when, through inner fire meditation, they have per-fectly learned the three stages of entering, stabilizing, and absorbing the winds; and, through familiarity with this practice and the power of the absorption of the winds, they have developed complete control over the flow of kundalini and thus experienced simultaneously born bliss. In order to increase the experience of the four joys, the yogi or yogini can then practice with a conson. The great yogi Jc Pabongka, on the other hand, explains in his commentary on the completion stage of Chinarnani Tara that the yogi or yogini can practice with a conson when the bean chakra opens and the kundalini flows. His view is that they should not prac-tice with a conson until they have opened the tightness of the knots of the bean chakra. In other words, they arc not qualified for the practice until the airs have not only absorbed in the central channel but begun to absorb at the hcan chakra. To engage in the practice before this point is a mistaken action and a ca~ of rcbinh in the lower realms. Now, I would like to debate with Lama Tsongkhapa. Je Pabongka's view is that a yogi or yogini is ready to practice with a conson only when the winds have absorbed in the hcan chakra and opened it by releasing the knots there. Lama Tsongkhapa, however, says that they can practice with a conson when the entering, stabiliz-ing. and absorbing of the winds becomes a habitual experience and they can control the flow of kundalini. 165"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"DISCOVI'UNG TOTALITY 166 I am not quite clear myself about these two statements. It seems to me that it is still possible that the heart chakra will not be open even though the airs have entered, stabilized, and absorbed in the central channel, as Lama Tsongkhapa explains. In this case, how can the prac-titioner be qualified to practice with a consort? Even though the energy has entered. stabilized, and absorbed in the central channel, it is possi-ble that the yogi or yogini still docs not understand emptiness and thus is not ready to practice with a consort. Think about this point. Why is a consort necessary? At this point, the airs have already entered the central channel, stabilized, and absorbed. The four cle-ments have ceased and the yogi or yogini has seen all the visions. With the flowing of the kundalini energy, they have experienced the four joys, culminating in the experience of simultaneously born bliss, and with that bliss they have comprehended nonduality. In other words, they have gone beyond grasping. Since they have already expe-rienced simultaneously born great blissful wisdom, why do they need to practice with a consort? The point is that there are degrees of these experiences: degrees of air absorption, degrees of bliss, and degrees of realization of nondualiry. Practice with a consort causes the airs to enter the central channel more strongly; and the more strongly the airs enter, the more strongly they will stabilize and absorb, and the more bliss will be generated. The purpose of practicing with a consort is to increase these experi-ences, and eventually to energize total absorption of the winds at the heart chakra, total bliss. and total realization of nonduality. Up to this point, the yogi or yogini has used a mental consort in meditation and has only begun to open the heart chakra. They need the help of a daka or dakini to totally open it. To energize the complete experience of great bliss, the male and female must help each other to bring the embracing energy into the central channel. There is a lot of confusion about consort practice, so you should understand clearly what Buddhist tantra has to say about it. The completion stage experience of great bliss achieved with a consort is incredible. It is beyond expression, beyond all concepts, beyond words. Accepting a consort is the unsurpassed way to achieve enlight-enment. In fact, having reached the point of being qualified to take a"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"consort, a yogi or yogini will definitely become enlightened in that life; they will achieve Vajradharahood. It is also explained that both the male and female practitioners should be qualified to practice and should be of equal good fortune and intelligence.' When the male and female panncrs are equally qualified, they both experience the absorptions. Jc Pabongka also explains that the conson should be shown to you by your deity, your lama, or the dakinis. Of the four types of consorts, he considers the best to be the mantra-born conson, which means someone who has become qualified through their practice of tantra. 2 Once the yogi or yogini has experienced bliss with a conson, each time they meditate on emptiness, they recollect the experience exactly and enter dirccdy into blissful samadhi. This is not like our experience of eating mozzarella chccsc: we cat it once and like it, but then we need to cat it again to get the pleasure. Without actually eat-ing it, we don't get the satisfaction. However, for yogis and yoginis who have reached a cenain level of development, it is enough for them to have the experience with a conson just once. Merely by remembering their previous experience with a relative conson, they will go cffonlessly into deep samadhi and experience perfccdy all the absorptions. Anyway, in the terminology of tantra, emptiness is the absolute conson, and finally that is enough . • THE OTHER FIVE YOGAS As I mentioned earlier, Lama Jc Tsongkhapa lists the Six Yogas of Naropa as the yogas of inner fire meditation, the illusory body, clear light, transference of consciousness, transference into another body, and the intermediate state. Lama T songkhapa explains that after practicing with a conson and deepening the realization of simultaneously born blissful wisdom, the yogi or yogini meditates on the waking-state practices of illusory body yoga and clear light yoga. These two subjects arc derived from the Guhyasamaja T antra. People often misunderstand the term \"illusory body,\" thinking that it merely refers to the practice of seeing everything as an illusion. Lama Tsongkhapa says that this is not the case. In fact, when the yogi"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"DucovaaaHG ToTALITY 168 or yogini arises from the experience of the totality of clear light, their very subde wind instantaneously manifests as an illusory body. Resembling a deity, this body is known at this stage as the impure illu-sory body. It is subde and delicate, is not composed of flesh and bones, and is separate from and does not depend upon the gross body. The practitioner can manifest this illusory body, perform many ben-eficial actions for others, and then return to their ordinary gross body. Method and wisdom are now unified; they occur simultaneously. The yogi or yogini continues their practice in order to deepen their realization of clear light and to devdop the pure illusory body, which is even more subde than the one previously achieved. In addition to meditating on clear light during the waking state, yogis and yoginis also practice the clear light of sleep; and during sleep they practice dream yoga meditation. Lama T songkhapa explains how dream yoga is gradually developed on the basis of med-itation on the clear light of sleep. While going to sleep, you again meditate on the energy entering, stabilizing, and absorbing in the cenrral channel. You experience the absorptions of the four clements, the three visions, and then reach the clear light experience. Actually, this is a natural process. When we go to sleep, the absorptions of the dements and experience of dear light happen automatically. This sounds good, but right now our sleeping is an ignorant experience. Yogis and yoginis, however, train themselves to be conscious of the entire process. Having meditated succcssfully and held the dear light experience, they can easily move from there into dream yoga. We naturally manifest a dream body when we dream; yogis and yoginis, however, after experiencing the clear light of sleep manifest an illusory body. As Lama T songkhapa points out, the practice of dream yoga is part of the illusory body yoga. In order to accomplish it, we need to be accomplished in meditation on the dear light of sleep; and in order to succeed in that, we need to have experienced the dear light in the wak-ing state. First we learn to work with the clear light in our waking state, and then in our sleep. After that we can succccd in dream yoga. However, success in both waking-and sleeping-state yogas depends upon inner fire meditation. Inner fire is the fundamental practice."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"BICOWINC VAJUDHAU Once we have attained proficiency in the illusory body of the dream state we can succeed in intermediate state yoga. Hence this also depends on the power of inner fire meditation. The same applies to the yoga of the transference of consciousness and the yoga for pro-jection of consciousness into another body. These two also depend upon the ability to direct the energies into the central channel. Without the preliminary of the winds entering the central channel, these two yogas of transference of consciousness cannot happen. Some people think that transference of consciousness is easy, but Lama Tsongkhapa disagrees. He states dearly that you must first practice inner fire meditation and be able to direct the energies into the central channel before you can practice transference of conscious-ness. Lama T songkhapa is not only giving his own opinion on the matter. In his cornmenW')' on transference of consciousness, he quotes the words of Shakyamuni Buddha extensively and transmits the lineage pcrfcctly. According to Lama Tsongkhapa, transference of consciousness is not an easy task. All these subjects need to be studied in detail when the time comes to practice them, so it is not necessary to elaborate on them now. Remember that inner fire is the practice fundamental to all of them. It is like a chain linking you to all the realizations. Understanding this is in itself a profound realization. -Lama Tsongkhapa's special field is tantra, and he is especially renowned for his teachings on the illusory body. His way of describ-ing the entire process, complete with meditation instructions, is distinctive and incredibly dear. His teachings are very helpful and inspiring. While giving this teaching, I have been fcding especially grateful to Lama Je Tsongkhapa. His profound explanations of the Six Yogas ofNaropa have inspired me to feel much devotion for him. There is no doubt in my mind that he was a great mahasiddha. Earlier in the text, Lama T songkhapa quoted Marpa as saying that he had received the heritage of these teachings from ·me gatekeeper of Nalanda.\" which means Nampa.

He: continues, ..

Your Pleasure Is Your Responsibility B y now, you should have all the information you need on the subject of inner fire. Practice the various meditation techniques as much as possible. If you usc these techniques, yow spiritual growth is ensured because you will gain the strength and energy to practice continuously. You need the reinforcement of positive experiences, but it is not good to experience a little success and then stop the prac-tice. Lama T songkhapa points out that it is important to continue the practice once you have some signs of progress. It is said that it is possible to attain enlightenment in a few years. or even a year, by means of practicing inner fire meditation. It is such a true method that if you practice it sincerely, the discovery of total-ity is not far away. Anyone with enough intelligence and good fonune can experience the results of inner fire simply by meditating on these techniques as instructed, even if they do not believe in them in a religious way. This makes them especially appropriate for W estemers, who arc generally not orientated toward religious belief. Inner fire meditation is scien-tific and logical, and you can experience its results without having to wait for a future life. You don't even have to believe in future lives. You just have to do the practice. In any case, maybe it is better to believe that you will be enlightened in this life through practicing the Six Y ogas of Naropa than to believe in future lives. I want you to have a strong, powerful motivation. Buddhism con-siders mental attitude to be fundamental to the way we interpret our life and our world, so it is important to have the correct motivation for our practice. Motivation is the way to remain interested and clear, because it hdps us to sec which way to go. 173"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"LIVING WITH INNia F1al! 174 Motivate strongly, pray strongly, to experience inner heat, blissful channels, blissful winds, blissful kundalini, and the union of simulta-neously born bliss and wisdom.

Don't think, \"I am not very accomplished in evolutionary stage yoga, so I should not prac-tice completion stage.\" Lama T songkhapa himself did four sessions of meditation every day. He practiced evolutionary stage yoga in the morning and completion stage yoga in the afternoon. Practicing the two together is the right thing to do. Inner fire meditation can actually help you to realize evolutionary stage yoga. Initially, you might find concentrating on the deity and attaining samadhi difficult; but when you stan to practice inner fire--pam.L-..cverything comes together. Also, the Tibetan tradition usually explains a graduated path to the attainment of realizations: first you do this, and then you do that. Inner fire meditation hdps this process and this graduated process helps inner fire meditation. Also, you shouldn't think, \"How can I meditate? First I should study for twenty or thirty years, and maybe then it will be reasonable for me to meditate. At present I am ignorant of all the vast subjects of Buddhism; therefore, I could not possibly get even a glimpse of single-pointed concentration. In any case, I have a job and I'm very busy. How can I possibly try to develop samadhi meditation? Tibetan monks who live in the mountains and never see anybody can devdop single-pointed concentration, but I am always surrounded by crowds of people. It is impossible for me to meditate.\" This thinking is definitely wrong. We are always making excuses. You should do your meditation every day, and at the same time, you can work, recite prayers, and perform other activities. It is possible to engage in other activities while developing single-pointed concentra-tion, especially once you have received instructions on inner fire.

They meditate on a concentration object every day as well as do other activities. & beginners, we have to try to bring the experience of heat and bliss to the chakras and channels and thus achieve clear light. Even though we have not yet reached the clear light stage, we have already had some experience of it. Clear light is fundamentally existent with-in us. We have to expand this experience until we reach totality. This is not something to merely talk about inteUectually. You have to judge when you need gas and how much you need. If you turn the gas too high, you will overcook: you will become overblissful and overheated. It'll be a disaster! So judge carefully. In Shaky:ununi Buddha's approach to human growth, you are the one responsible. Buddha or the guru or God is nor responsible. You have to judge by your own experience, which is why you need to develop confidence in yourself. Remember the story of Milarepa. After he had spent a couple of yean with Marpa, Marpa sent him away. Milarepa was then alone in the mountains with no one he could ask for advice. He was empty-handed; he had nothing. You can definitely judge for yourself. You should appreciate this and believe in yourself. You know which technical meditations you need and when to apply them. Sometimes you won't need any of the techniques. Just with natural, subde breathing, your concentration wiU be reasonably good, your inner fire energy will grow, and you wiU feel blissful. In that state of mind, you will have no superstition, no pressure of mundane thoughts. It will be a clean-clear stare, with no this or that and with no movement toward sensory objects. You learn to let go of many things. Also, just as you change your friends, you can change the statues and pictures of Buddhas and lamas on your altar. Don't think that you must have a panicular pictUre on your allaf because otherwise other people will think that you are not being respectful. Who cares about what other people think? This is just politics. When you pay ancntion to such criticism, you arc not communicating with yourself. It is your business, not theirs. It i.s your altar, and arranging it is your experience.

And the stronger your kundaJini energy becomes, the greater the success you wiU have with inner fire meditation. Taking care of your body is imponant because it is the source of simultaneously born bliss. For example, in order to increase the sex-ual energy of male-female kundaJini, you should eat food that is high in protein and exercise regularly.lt is logical that the more energy you have, the more you can usc. During periods of intensive practice of inner fire meditation, even laypeople should try to control the loss of sexual energy. According to Buddhist tantra, losing sexual energy during intercourse weakens the physical strength of your body. This weakening of the body then weakens the flow of kundaJini. You do not have to believe this sim-ply because it is what the Tibetan texts and Tibetan lamas say. Check your own experience. This docs not ncccssarily mean that laypcople should live like monks or nuns. However, when you are practicing strongly, you should control yourself and not lose kundaJini. When you are not practicing strongly, there is no commitment not to lose energy; you just act normally."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Youa Puuuat Is Youa RuPoNsaaauTY Laypcople with a regular sex life should usc the force of inner fire meditation to hold the kundalini in the secret cha.kra for as long as possible during intercourse. Imagine that you experience simultane-ously born great blissful wisdom before you release the energy. Having this control brings even greater bliss and satisfaction, espe-cially when you have generated strong energy within you because of your magnetic anraction to the other person. You can utilize this energy in the secret path to liberation. Why am I telling you this? I don't want to ruin my reputation by having people say, .. Don't go ncar Lama Yeshe! He burned out my married life and ruined my relationship ... T antra is very practical in emphasizing the usc of desire energy. Of course, when we first meet someone we arouse pleasure and excitement within each other, almost to the point of energizing kundalini. Later all we do is ener-gize misery! Instead of becoming each other's pleasure object. we become each other's prisoner. Each of the fow classes of tantra is meant for a particular type of practitioner. What differentiates one class of tantra from another is the intensiry of the desire energy used in the path to enlightenment. In Action T antra, great bliss is aroused by simply looking at all the beautiful deities; in Performance T antra, smiling and laughing is used to energize bliss; in Yoga Tantra, blissful energy is generated from holding hands; and in Highest Yoga Tantra, the energy of the sexual embrace is used. H11ving tht Thrtt Convictions states that lay practitioners even at the level of evolutionary yoga can rely upon a partner to some extent to develop bliss and wisdom.

A5 long as we are developing bright universal wisdom, it docsn 't matter what tools we usc. As long as you arc dear that you arc responsible for the growth of the totaliry of the simulta-neously born great blissful wisdom of your own Vajradharahood, anything you do that benefits your growth is good, even if it is social-ly unacceptable.

Never Forget Inner Fire T he yoga of inner fire is a profound teaching, and it should be used in a meaningful way. You should meditate on inner fire as much as possible. It is really such a simple technique. It is good to set up a place for meditation wherever you arc living. For a few dollan you can make a meditation box like meditators used in ancient times. Since you cannot lie down in a meditation box, at least while you arc in it you have to sit up and meditate. It is good psychology to set yourself up in this way. Be mindful of your experiences and keep a written record of them if you like. You have to understand that these technical meditations arc set up in such a way that you will achieve results. Everybody who practices them should have some experiences. We should practice as seriously as N aropa did. The Six Y ogas of Naropa is a completion stage tantric practice that is both complete and profound. These six subjects contain the nucleus of the practices of both the father and mother tantras. The way to take the essence of these teachings is not through an intellectual approach but through action. You simply have to act. You must practice continuously. When you practice inner fire in retreat, start by doing five or six short sessions each day. In the beginning it is better to do short sessions of perhaps an hour and a half each, because then you will do them well. When you become more accomplished, you can do sessions of many houn in length; if you do long sessions at the beginning, you will merely become sluggish and sleepy. Also, do the physical exer-cises for half an hour at least once a day. 179"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"J80 \\\"qhcn you arc not in rcueat, it is best to do the hatha yoga and the inner fire meditarions early in the morning on an empty stomach.

People in the \\Xlest tend to eat a large meal in the evening, so in that case it is better to do the practice in the morning. All me inner fire meditations should be done with single-pointed concentration. This includes the meditations on melting the blissful lllndalini energy; me entering, stabilizing, and absorbing of the winds; and the whole process of the sinking of the four elements and the arising of me three visions. They are all intended to be samadhi experiences. People may feel some conflict between doing strong samadhi med-itation and their daily meditation commitments. In the Tibetan sys-tem, you have permission to reduce your other prayers when you are doing strong single-pointed meditation, such as in an intensive retreat on inner fire. Your practice is the best prayer in any case. You can relax about relative prayers because you are doing absolute prayer. There should not really be any conflict. The most important point is the meditation. On the oilier hand, you shouldn't casually think, \"I'm doing absolute prayer, so I can give up relative prayer.\" To ratio-nalize like this can be dangerous. You have co chink carefully about how co adjust your life. During periods of intensive inner fire meditation, you should not sit too close to fires or get sunburned, as this may stimulate the wrong energies. It doesn't matter when you are not medicating intensively; at those times you can go to the beach as usual and burn yourself to a brown color. Unfonunately, you should also avoid cold foods, such as icc cream. Eating very cold things damages your natural resource for inner fire meditation. Also avoid salty foods and drinks when you are doing inner fin: meditation. You may think that Tibetans have no idea about chemicals and such things, but we have known about them for many hundreds of years. Also, you should not eat acidic foods, such as lemons.

Direct all the blissful energy into the inner fire in the central channel at the navel chalua. T antra is very practical when it talks about taking desire and samsaric pleasure into the path to enlightenment. The purpose of inner fire meditation is to increase pleasure.

In order to taste inner fire we have to understand the unification of the relative and absolute. We have to know how to put bliss and wisdom together. Inner fire meditation is a process in which we learn to unify bliss and emptiness inseparably. Bliss energy is emptiness; emptiness is bliss.

Mastery of inner fire quickly brings the mind to its most refined and penetrating state-the experience or clear light, an extra-ordinarily powerful state of mind that is unequaled in its ability to directly realize ultimate reality. lama Yeshe's aim was for his students to actually taste the experi-ence of inner fire rather than merely gain an intellectual understanding. Lama's own realization or the transformative power of these practices comes through, inspiring his students to discover for themselves their own capacity for inexhaustible bliss. LAMA YES HE, the author of the bestselling clas-sic Introduction to Tantra. was the founder of the worldwide network or Buddhist centers. the Foundation for the Preservation of the Maha-yana Tradition (FPMD.
