He entered the Mey College of Sera Monastery at an early age and proceeded through the demanding twenty-year program of Buddhist philosophical stud-ies. Upon successful completion of the public examination by the best scholars of the day, Rinpoche was awarded the highest degree of Hlarampa Geshe with honors. In 1954 he entered Gyu-me Tantric College, completed the course of study, and later reached a high-ranking administrative position. In 1959 Rinpoche fled Communist-occupied Tibet along with the Dalai Lama and tens of thousands of other Tibetan refugees. Actively involved in the education of Tibetan children in India, he helped compile a series of textbooks for the Tibetan curriculum and taught at several resettlement schools including those at Darjeeling, Simla, and Mussoorie. In 1972 Khen Rinpoche came to Howell, New Jersey to partici-pate in a Buddhist translation project. Several years later he was invited to serve as Abbot of Rashi Gempil Ling, a Buddhist Temple established by Kalmuk Mongolians. Rinpoche also founded the Mahayana Sutra and Tantra Center, with branches in Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and New York, where he has taught extensively for more than twenty years. In 1991 the Dalai Lama appointed Khen Rinpoche Abbot of Sera Mey College in south India, a position he held for two years.

However, a series of prerequisites must be met before anyone can undertake to practice the instructions described here. You must begin by taking refuge in the Triple Gem and generating the altruistic aspiration to achieve enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Then, starting with the practice of how to serve a spiritual teacher properly, you must gradually train yourself in all the topics of the teaching known as the stages of the path for the three types of practitioner. Following this, you should rely on the saving guidance of a Mahayana spiritual teacher who can allow you to enter the door to the secret practices of the Vajrayana tradition. This is accomplished by properly receiving from him the four levels of an Anuttarayoga Tantra initiation in the mandala of either Chakrasamvara, Guhyasamaja, or Vajrabhairava. Of these three, the ideal would be to receive this initiation in the mandala of Chakrasamvara. In addition, it is essential that you properly observe all the vows and pledges that are given during the initiation. Mter meeting these requirements, a practitioner is fully qualified to enter the mandala of the supremely holy Vajrayogini and to receive her blessing in the form of a four-stage initiation. Following that, you should seek to obtain a complete teaching on all the common and unique instructions of the two stages of her profound path. In addition to hearing the instructions, you must strive to gain a clear and certain understanding of how to practice them, so that"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":")CVIII S1.1hl tmc J)dl h m J~:cllliM Po.t?AritSr you can carry them out continually throughout the six sessions of each day. The spiritual practices of Vajrayogini's path are divided into two levels known as the generation stage and completion stage. Of these, I have mainly explained here the practices that relate to the generation stage. In doing so, I followed the outline of the eleven yogas, which begin with sleeping yoga, waking yoga, and so on as set forth by the great Sakya patriarchs. The instructions relating to these eleven practices are presented in the context of a word-for-word explanation of the Vajrayogini sadhana ritual. This commentary is based on the understandings that I myself gained from profound teachings on the instructions handed down by the former lamas of this lineage. I have also described many unique instructions that ordinarily must be received orally and are not explicitly referred to in the words of the Dak-kye ritual. They are included here out of concern that they might gradually be forgotten and eventually lost forever. May whatever virtue roots that are generated through having explained these instructions to the best of my ability serve to preserve the Buddha's teaching in general, and especially the teaching of the supremely holy Vajrayogini. Her instruction is the quintessence of Chakrasamvara's mother tantra system, which itself represents the quintessence of all the esoteric teachings of the Vajrayana. I pray that these teachings never deteriorate and that, having spread as far as the peak of samsaric existence, they remain for all time.

Generally, we are all impermanent. You have the expressions \"permanent job\" and \"temporary job.\" We can learn something from these. It is in this sense that the teaching given here is \"permanent\" and the lama is also \"permanent.\" I have been giving instructions on this practice for nearly twenty years. It has been like a permanent job. In this sense the students are also \"permanent,\" since they have been studying it for that long. Similarly, the practice itself is \"permanent\" since it is one that you do regularly-the kind that you study and learn throughout your whole life. Here you will get instruction on a few pages of the teaching; but that is not enough to make it a permanent practice. You have to put these instructions into a \"permanent file\" that you will use for as long as you live. These instructions are the guide for your main practice. You might ask yourself, \"Why is he giving me a permanent teaching? Why are we studying it? Why should we make this a permanent practice?\" In this country there are many kinds of insurance: life insurance, medical insurance, car insurance, house insurance, property insurance. I don't have to tell you what insurance is-you buy insurance because you believe you'll have problems in the future and will need help to get through them. When you get insurance you think, \"This will help me; this will protect me.\" But these ordinary kinds of insurance will only help you in this life. Why do you buy insurance? You think, ''I'm scared. I'm afraid.\" Afraid of what? You're afraid that you'll have all kinds of problems; that you might get sick, have an accident, or that your house might"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"bum down. There are many different problems we can experience. So you say to yourself, \"I buy insurance because I'm scared. That's why I pay for insurance.\" Your fear is what urges you to buy insurance and make your payments. But all these problems relate only to this life. When this life is finished, all of its problems will also be finished. Even now you are coming to this teaching looking for insurance. But the kind you're looking for is ultimate insurance that covers you for a much longer time-an insurance for your future lives. You think, \"In the future when problems come, I will need protection; I will need someone who can help me. So I'll look for the best insurance, an infallible insurance company that will never go bankrupt and will never tum me down.\" That infallible insurance is Buddhahood. Once you attain Buddhahood, you will be saved automatically. At that time you won't have to worry because all your problems will come to an end. But how do you get rid of those problems? How do you get that insurance? You have to get that insurance from the infallible president of the Infallible Insurance Company. You have to receive instructions and get the insurance from him. Who is that president? Buddha. How do you get instructions that will insure you? From Buddha's teachings. And how do you make the payments? By doing your daily practice. You have to learn the instructions and practice them daily. Because both the teacher and the teachings are infallible, you will definitely get the result. It's like that. You have to achieve Buddhahood since it's the ultimate infallible insurance you're looking for to protect you in the future. Of course there are many, many stages in the process of getting that insurance; you have to follow them one by one, step by step. One method is the Hinayana path that will provide you with temporary insurance but not ultimate insurance. In order to get ultimate insurance you have to practice the Mahayana path. But if you practice the Mahayana path according to the Sutrayana way, it takes eons and eons to get that insurance. Buddha Shakyamuni himself practiced that path for many, many eons and finally succeeded in getting the ultimate insurance. Therefore, even though you may enter the Mahayana path, if you follow the Sutrayana way, it takes an extremely long time to get that result."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"fnlROd(JCLIOn 5 Here there is a very crucial point that you have to understand. From your side you cannot get discouraged and think, \"Oh, I can't practice for that long. I can't work so hard for that long.\" From the practitioner's side, it is improper to think that way. You must decide, \"No matter how long the practice takes, no matter how difficult it is, I will do it. I will keep going until I completely finish the practice.\" From your own side, you have to make that kind of decision. But you must also reach a second decision, which is to look at things from the perspective of others, and think, \"If I follow the Sutrayana way for that many eons, all sentient beings will have to continue suffering for that entire time. I cannot bear to let these mother beings suffer in samsara for that long. I cannot bear it. A mother wouldn't just stand by while her kids were burning in a fire or drowning in a lake. There is no time to wait. She would immediately do whatever she could to rescue them. Similarly, you should think, \"I cannot bear to let all sentient beings suffer in samsara for that many eons. Therefore, I want very much to help them as soon as possible, to save them from their suffering, to liberate them.\" That is the decision you have to reach by considering things from the perspective of all mother beings. \"But how can I do this quickly? I cannot bear to let all sentient beings suffer in samsara for eons and eons. I want to help them as soon as possible. Is there a way to do this very quickly?\" If you were to ask the Buddha this question, he would say, \"Yes, the way to do this is to enter the tantric field of practice. It is not enough that you study and practice only the Sutrayana teachings; you must also enter the tantric vehicle; you must practice Tantrayana.\" That is the answer the Buddha would give you. There are four levels of practice in Tantrayana. However, not every one of these has the quality that enables you to help sentient beings immediately. Action Tantra (ja gyii) doesn't have that quality. Performance Tantra (chii gyii) doesn't have it. Yoga Tantra (nelior gyii) doesn't have that quality either. Only Highest Yoga Tantra (neljor lana mepey gyii) has that quality. Highest Yoga Tantra is the highest level of tantric practice. The short name for this kind of tantra in Tibetan is la-me gyii. Gyii means tantra; Ia-means higher or above; me is the negative particle. Therefore, la-me gyii means the unsurpassed or Highest Yoga Tantra. You have to enter this tantra."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Even though Highest Yoga Tantra is the level of tantra that you must enter, it has many different forms. In our Ganden Oral Transmission Lineage (ganden nyen gyii) the three most important tantras are Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, and Yamantaka. Among these, Guhyasamaja and Yamantaka are known as father tantras; Chakrasamvara is a mother tantra. Where do the terms \"father tantra\" and \"mother tantra\" come from? They come from your knowledge and from a Buddha's knowledge. We have both the father tantra's basic substance and the mother tantra's basic substance. Along with the basic substances of these two systems, there are also the father and mother tantras' paths and their ultimate goals. Among the three tantras I mentioned, Chakrasamvara is the name of the male deity in the mother tantra system. A line from the Vajrayogini ritual says, \"glorious Heruka, the King of Tantras .. .''l Heruka is the name of the male deity who is the king of the mother tantras; his consort is the queen of the mother tantras, or Vajra Queen. The next line of the ritual refers to her when it says \"The Vajra Queen's supreme near-essence mantra.''2 So the Vajrayogini tantric teaching system is also a mother tantra. Among the mother tantras, the Vajrayogini tantra is the Vajra Queen's system of practice and the Chakrasamvara tantra is the King's system of practice. 1 · This division into mother and father tantras is based on whether they emphasize the miracle body (gyulii) or clear light (w6sel). Gyulii means Buddha's miracle body. Gyu is short for gyuma, which means miracle; Iii means body. Wosel means the mind's ultimate brightness, the brightness of the mind's ultimate wisdom. Therefore, the systems that emphasize the crucial points relating to the miracle body belong to the category of father tantras, while the systems that emphasize teachings on the dear light of ultimate wisdom belong to the mother tantras. Since Guhyasamaja is a father tantra, its teachings emphasize the miracle body, describing what it is, how to achieve it, what it is made of, how to practice it, and so forth. The Vajrabhairava~. tantra is 1The line in Tibetan is: Heruka pel gyii-kyi gyelpo le ... This line appears in \"Prayer to See the Glorious Face of the QUeen of Kechara.\" See page 262. 2Ibid.

Chakrasamvara's system, however, is a mother tantra, which emphasizes the clear light of ultimate wisdom. The reason there are different kinds of father tantras and mother tantras like Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, and Vajrabhairava is that each disciple has different wishes, abilities, and propensities. If you teach certain disciples about clear light, it won't help them to produce the proper result right away. However, if you teach the same disciples about the miracle body, they will quickly achieve results and will also achieve clear light in the process. Both the father and mother tantra systems are referred to as nyi me-kyi gyu or Non-Dual Tantra. Nyi means two; me means not separate; gyu means tantra. Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, and Vajrabhairava are all forms of Non-Dual Tantra. This kind of tantra combines both the miracle body and clear light. None of these tantras teaches either of these aspects exclusively; all of them contain teaching systems that relate to both. The emphasis of a particular tantra may differ, but the main elements of the teaching, as well as its function and results, are all the same. Therefore, we call all of these systems Non-Dual Tantra. The tantric college where I entered the practice of Non-Dual Tantra is called Lower Tantric College or Gyii-me. Gyii is the general name that refers to tantra. Me means lower, referring to the college's geographical location. It got that name because it was situated in a lower place relative to the other main tantric college, which was called GyUto, or Higher Tantric College. Gyu-me is also known by the secret name Sangdu Dratsang. Sangdu means Guhyasamaja; Dratsang means college, that is, Guhyasamaja College. It is so called because the main practice and teaching system studied there related to the Guhyasamaja tantra. We had to study the Guhyasamaja school system for the first six months of the Tibetan calendar. For the seventh, eighth, and ninth months we studied the Chakrasamvara school system. Then for the final three months we had to study the Vajrabhairava school system. I was very lucky to attend Gyii-me Tantric College. During one period, all five hundred monks in the college studied and practiced the Chakrasamvara system together for three months. Following that, we stayed in retreat for seven days. Each day of this retreat"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"started at what we called morning but what you would call late night, or eleven o'clock. We would get up, wash our face and hands, and sit down to practice together. Then we were brought tea for our breakfast. After that we had to recite and meditate on a ritual until about six o'clock the following morning. It was unbelievable. At the end of the retreat all the monks had to gather together and do a jinsek or fire offering ceremony. During both the retreat and fire offering, I served as leader for the rituals. It was an incredibly wonderful and especially significant time for me. Some tantric systems have a body mandala practice and some do not. For example, the Yamantaka tantra does not have a body mandala practice. Tantric systems that do include this practice are more profound and efficient. The Guhyasamaja system, which we call gyu-gyi gyelpo, or the King of Tantras, is one of the tantras that includes a lUkyil or body mandala practice. In this practice you transform thirty-two parts of your body into the thirty-two deities of Guhyasamaja's mandala. Those thirty-two deities are generated from thirty-two separate parts of your body. Chakrasamvara has a body mandala practice that is even more profound and more efficient than Guhyasamaja's body mandala practice. Chakrasamvara's body mandala is not generated by transforming thirty-two parts of your physical body into thirty-two deities. Instead, you are transforming sixty-two different parts of your body's nerve branches. These nerves function at various places throughout your body, such as the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and so on. Here, you transform the outer tips of those nerves into the sixty-two deities of Chakrasamvara's mandala. Now, the body has three levels: a rough body, a subtle body, and a very subtle body. In Tibetan we say Iii la rakpa trawa shin tu trawa. In the Guhyasamaja system the rough body is what we tum into the body mandala's deities. In Chakrasamvara's body mandala, we tum the nerves of the subtle body into deities. Because the substance is subtle, the practice likewise becomes more subtle. This is why Chakrasamvara's body mandala is more efficient and profound than Guhyasamaja's body mandala. In Vajrayogini's body mandala practice, it is not the outer tips of the nerves that are transformed, but rather the inner tips or roots of the nerves located within the heart chakra. This is where the thirty-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"lnrRoducnon 9 seven dakinis of the Vajrayogini body mandala are practiced, making this body mandala practice more efficient than the other two I mentioned. Here, the meditation practice consists of turning the inner tips of your nerves into dakinis or deities. In this form of body mandala practice your mind has to be very flexible; you are visualizing \"outer\" objects-that is, those thirty-six dakinis-but you are visualizing the entire body mandala inside your heart chakra and meditating on it there. Sometimes those dakinis are visualized as being life-size, sometimes as large as mountains, but they always fit comfortably in your heart chakra. This kind of agility of concentration is known as ting nge dzin-gyi tsel. That is what makes this a most profound tantric practice. You received the initiation and teachings on this already. I hope it has stayed in your mind and that you are practicing it sometimes. If you don't practice it, you will forget it. Do not forget it! You should remember it. How can you make sure that you remember the practice? What can you do? You can practice every day. Then it will become clearer and clearer and your practice will get better and better. I have said that meditating on the body mandala of Chakra-samvara's school system is a very profound and efficient practice. Why is it so efficient, so profound, so holy? Because Buddha Shakyamuni himself appeared in Chakrasamvara's complete mandala and taught the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra. That Root Tantra has fifty-one chapters of which the first describes in brief the categories that make up the entire Chakrasamvara teaching. Chapters two to fifty present all these subjects in detail, one by one. Chapter fifty-one summarizes all of the meanings contained in the previous chapters, so that practitioners can learn about how to begin the practice, what kind of progress to expect, and the goal they can reach. These explanations are gathered together in this way for the benefit of followers. We call the subject matter contained in the fifty-first chapter de nyi chu shi or the \"fourteen essential topics.\" Because it is so holy, I have urged you to recite at least this small portion of that chapter. It plants very holy seeds in your mind, which is why we recite it regularly."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Go dang chakgya nga la sok/ Sherab yenlak pur bu gur/ A-li ka-li she jo ne/ Gyu sok tongpa ngon drowa/ Juk pa dra la sok pa ne/ Ji si du pey jor den pa/ Dutsi tsim-je nya ngen de/ Lak pey chiipa wang kurwa/ Go cha chenpa yang dak sung/ Ngak nam kun-gyi chopar ja/ De tar de nyi chu shi nil Dor du ne ni she pa yin/ The attire, the five mudra ornaments, and the rest; Wisdom's limbs; dagger and tent; Uttering the vowels and consonants; The cause and so forth, which are preceded by voidness; From the entering of the nada and so on; Until the yoga of absorption; Nectar that satisfies; dissolution; Hand offering; initiation; Protection by great armor; Worshipping with all the mantras-With these I have taught in brief The fourteen essential topics. In the term de nyi chu shi, de nyi means category or essential topic; chu shi means fourteen. The entire Chakrasamvara teaching system is included in these fourteen essential topics; all of these are also contained in the Vajrayogini practice. Therefore, the Vajrayogini teaching system, together with the related practices and recitations, contain all of the Buddha's general teachings. In particular, it also contains the quintessence of all the Buddha's tantric teachings, including the Chakrasamvara tantra and all the father and mother tantras. The Vajrayogini teaching system and practice has three unique characteristics. The first is that it is a great collection of instruction; me-ngak du chewa. Me-ngak means instructions of both sutra or tantra."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"lnr:Roducnon I I Du chewa means a great collection; that is, all the sutra and tantra instructions are included in Vajrayogini's teaching system with no crucial points left out. This characteristic is particularly important for Westerners. Since most of you are so busy, you need the most efficient, easiest, and most complete kind of practice. The second characteristic is that this instruction is easy to practice, or lak tu lang dewa. This characteristic relates to the visualization. The Guhyasamaja system includes a mandala that contains thirty-two deities, each having a specific color, mudra, and holding different instruments. Similarly, Chakrasamvara's mandala has sixty-two deities. The visualization in the Vajrayogini practice is much easier. The mandala consists of a double chOnjung, or dharma source, within which you visualize a single deity-you yourself in Vajrayogini's nirmanakaya form. Therefore, Vajrayogini' s practice is easy for you to do. The third characteristic is that by doing this practice the goals are achieved especially quickly, or ngodrup hlakpar nyurwa. In order to spiritually tame beings who are overcome with desire, Vajrayogini appears in the world in the form of an ordinary woman and bestows her blessing upon practitioners. Since worldly beings are overcome with desire, Vajrayogini and the wisdom dakinis take on ordinary forms and act on their behalf. Whenever those who have entered the practice come into contact with these beings, their minds are blessed. Also, just through practicing Vajrayogini's quick path and by coming into contact with these divine beings, the practitioner will have no difficulty achieving outer and inner K.achO, or Vajrayogini' s paradise, and will be able to achieve the attainments without great difficulty. You also have to know the value of this teaching system. The more you learn about Vajrayogini's practice, the more you'll understand how valuable it is and the more you'll progress. The more you study and strengthen your faith in the practice, the more knowledge you will gain. You have to understand that what you are doing is extremely valuable and important. This teaching system comes from Buddha Chakrasamvara. In this form he is very difficult to visualize since he has four faces, twelve hands, and holds twelve different instruments. However, in the Vajrayogini ritual you only have to visualize Buddha Vajradharma (Sang-gye Dorje Cho). A description of that visualization is found in"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"12 SutX tmc {Jdrh w Kcchv«\\ P<lR<lrltsc the Dak-kye: Sang-gye Dorje Cho-kyi nampa chen kundok marpo ... (see page 79), which means he is visualized as red with one face and two hands holding a vajra and bell crossed at his heart. Sang-gye Dorje Cho is an infallible lama, an infallible teacher. We call him lama tsema. Tsema means infallible. This is the first of four infallibilities that the teaching possesses. The second infallibility is lung tsema, or infallible teaching. Lung means main scriptural source of the teaching, which is those fifty-one chapters of the root tantra taught by Buddha. He also taught an explanatory tantra called Dorje Kandro (Vajradaka). These are the main sources for the Dak-kye. This is not just someone's idea that was researched and put together to make a teaching. It is not like that. The third infallibility is tenchO tsema or infallible treatise. Tencho tsema refers to the instruction handed down by Naropa as well as his original composition known as \"Naropa's Small Treatise\" (Shung Chung). How did he compose that treatise? Vajrayogini appeared to Naropa again and again and taught him the meaning of the root tantra's fifty-one chapters, as well as explanations relating to the teachings and practices of the Dorje Kandro tantra. Naropa composed his work based on all these instructions that he received directly from Vajrayogini. Therefore, his treatise is also infallible. Our Dak-kye is based on this text. The fourth infallibility is nyam nyong tsema or infallible experience, After having received teachings directly from Vajrayogini and having practiced them, Naropa gained perfect knowledge and experience. This teaching includes infallible experience because it is based on the knowledge he acquired. It is because this teaching has these qualities that I told you to consider the Dak-kye and this teaching system as your \"permanent\" practice. These should be your \"permanent\" object of study and you should become \"permanent\" students of this practice. Its ultimate goal should be your \"permanent\" goal. When you realize the value of these Vajrayogini teachings you will feel urgency about studying them. But who can study them? You have to be qualified to study and listen to these teachings. The first qualification is that you must at least practice renunciation, bodhichitta, and correct view, or as they are known in Tibetan, ngeniung, jangsem, and yang dakpey tawa. Even though you may not"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"lnrRoriucnon I 3 have gained complete knowledge of these subjects, at least you have to have a clear understanding of what they are. We call these three kinds of knowledge \"the three principal aspects of the path\" or lam-gyi tsowo nam sum. It was Manjushri who referred to them by this name when he transmitted them to Je Tsongkapa. The first of the three know ledges is ngenjung, or renunciation. Ngenjung means definitely leaving or emerging from; that is, leaving samsara and becoming free from its suffering. The second knowledge is jangsem, or bodhichitta. The jang in jangsem refers to Buddhahood, and sem means the mind that wants very much to achieve Buddhahood in order to benefit other beings. The last of the three knowledges is yang dakpey tawa, or correct view. Yang dakpa means perfect or correct; tawa means view. Correct view is the cognitive state whose object is the real nature of all phenomena, including your own real nature, your body's real nature, your mind's real nature, and the real nature of other beings' minds and bodies. You have to practice in order to realize your most subtle air and mind by awakening it. In this practice correct view refers to the realization of this most subtle air and mind. You have to gain these three knowledges in a genuine and uncontrived way, or what we call chiima rna yin ba. Choma here means to generate these know ledges in your mind temporarily or artificially through a process of reflection. ChOma rna yin ba means being able to generate them automatically and without effort. For example, if someone were outside talking about President Clinton and he was inside and heard them, he would immediately think, \"Oh, they're talking about me.\" That thought would arise automatically and would not have to be produced artificially. He has that quality already. That is the meaning of chama rna yin ba. Even if you cannot gain these three knowledges in an uncontrived way, you must at least be able to generate them artificially. It is very important that you produce them temporarily; you should try to hold them in your mind as long, as clearly, and as firmly as possible. Eventually, of course, they will arise spontaneously in your mind. After having understood these three principal aspects of the path, you can take initiation. Initiation means getting permission through planting seeds. Permission means to be allowed to hear, to study, and to practice the tantric teachings. The seeds of understanding that"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"are planted during initiation are encouraged to grow through your study and practice. Study and practice are like the water and fertilizer that will cause actual seeds to ripen and sprout. The function of the initiation is to plant seeds. Getting initiation means to have understood well what you heard; that is, your understanding is the seed that is planted. To say you got the initiation means that you got the seeds because you caught the meanings. Initiation is not just hearing the sound of bells and damarus, but clearly understanding what you heard. If you received the initiation and got those seeds, but don't make the effort to produce a sprout, those seeds won't last very long and will eventually be destroyed once you forget these teachings. Just as real seeds are eaten by bugs and other creatures, if you neglect these, soon there will be nothing left of them. So, before the seeds of the initiation disappear, you must listen to these teachings, study, and make progress. This teaching system has two stages: generation stage (kye-rim) ·and completion stage (dzok-rim). These are the two main paths that allow us to gain the ultimate spiritual insurance. The teaching I am giving you here will deal mainly with the eleven yogas of Vajrayogini's generation stage. Generation stage is related to the process of taking birth. Ordinary birth comes from an ordinary bardo or intermediate state, and an ordinary bardo comes from an ordinary death. For an ordinary person these three stages will definitely come in the future. However, a good tantric practitioner does not allow them to occur in the ordinary way. What is the main purpose of our practice? It is to transform ordinary death, the ordinary bardo state, and ordinary rebirth into the path. This is accomplished by the practice that relates to a Buddha's three bodies (ku sum lam kyer). Ku means body, a Buddha's body. In Sanskrit it is called kaya. Sum means three, or a Buddha's three bodies; lam kyer means to take up as the path. A Buddha's three bodies in Tibetan are called chii ku, long ku, and trul ku. Cho ku, or jnanadharmakaya in Sanskrit, means a Buddha's wisdom body; long ku, or sambhogakaya, means enjoyment body, or a Buddha's deity body; trul ku, or nirmanakaya, means emanation body. Buddha Shakyamuni, who appeared in India many years ago, was a Buddha's nirmanakaya form. Since he wanted everyone to be"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"lm::Rod(}cnon I 5 able to see him, he manifested himself in the form of an ordinary human being. The Buddha's enjoyment body is his deity form that resides in a paradise. The only disciples and followers who can perceive this body directly are Mahayana Bodhisattva Aryas. Even if the Buddhas were to appear in this world in their enjoyment body form, we would not be able to see them. For example, long ago Asanga meditated for twelve years on Maitreya. From the day he began his meditation, Maitreya came to his place and appeared before him, but Asanga could not see him because he appeared in his deity form, in the enjoyment body or sambhogakaya. In our practice we have to transform the three ordinary experiences of death, bardo, and rebirth into paths for achieving these three bodies of a Buddha. This is what is meant by taking the three bodies as the path or ku sum lam kyer. As practitioners we have to use these three result kayas as the object of our paths according to our level. There is a generation stage ku sum lam kyer practice and a completion stage ku sum lam kyer practice. Here I will be teaching you the complete set of teachings that relate to the generation stage practice of taking the three bodies as the path. This ku sum lam kyer practice has three parts, which will be explained later. You have to do generation stage ku sum lam kyer with your meditation, concentration, and visualization. You do this by purifying your ordinary samsaric body and turning it into light. Then tum this light into emptiness. Having done this, think, \"I am now in the jilanadharmakaya form. That's me; I am that.\" From that emptiness you appear in the deity's form; that is, in Vajrayogini's form. This is what you do while meditating. Then you visualize yourself in sambhogakaya form and again think, \"That's me; I am that.\" Finally, you visualize yourself in nirmanakaya form, thinking, ''That's me; I am that.\" You have to have this structure in your mind. Even though you haven't actually achieved these kayas yet, you have to meditate on them firmly as if they were real, as if you had already achieved them. This is what is called \"divine pride\" (nga-gyel) and \"pure appearances\" (sel-nang). In the tantric field we call such practice chomey neljor, takpey neljor, or kye-rim neljor-synonyms meaning \"produced by the practitioner's meditation.\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"There are also two classes of generation stage practice: rough generation stage (kye-rim rakpa) and subtle generation stage (kye-rim tramo ). Eventually you can learn and practice both of these, but first you have to finish rough generation stage practice. Once you've achieved that, you get a promotion to do subtle generation stage practice. Even if you cannot achieve those levels, at least by practicing them you plant positive bakchaks, or seeds, in your mind. If you do not finish those practices in this lifetime, should you have a good opportunity in the future, you will have the seeds and the knowledge of how to practice them. Of course you cannot achieve everything immediately, just like that! It shouldn't be boom, boom, boom and then burned out like fireworks. Those are always very nice to watch, but the next morning there is nothing left but a little trash here and there. Your practice shouldn't be like that; it should be steady, like making the Empire State Building-starting from the bottom, building up, and then finishing at the top. Once it is completed everyone can go there and enjoy it. We should be thinking, \"I am terrified that I will have to experience an ordinary death, an ordinary bardo, and an ordinary rebirth, and will have to continue suffering in samsara for eons and eons. Therefore, I need some ultimate insurance.\" This ultimate insurance is to achieve the Buddha's three bodies. The way to get that insurance is by practicing ku sum lam kyer, or taking the three bodies as the path. This is the main practice. However, in order to do this practice, your mind must be very clean. You have to transform it into a perfectly clear field where the Buddha's three kayas can mature without difficulty. Therefore, you must first clear away the stones and trim the bushes. One way to arrange and clean the field of your mind is by practicing Vajrasattva meditation (dorje sempey gom de), which is included in the Dak-kye. Once you have cleaned your mind, you have to cover it with good fertilizer, which is your virtue. So next you must collect virtue. The best, most efficient way of doing this is by practicing guru yoga (Iamey neljor). As Buddha Vajradhara said: Chapa tamche pang ne ni/ Lama chOpa yang dak gyi/"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Having given up all other offering practices, Make offerings solely to your guru. lnrRoducnon I 7 In the Dak-kye, guru yoga follows the Vajrasattva meditation. These two practices are the way to transform your mind into a perfect field so that the Buddha's three kayas can develop. These initial practices are definitely the best way to collect great virtue and clear away great obstacles; of course they are the \"permanent\" practitioner's main activity. When practicing Vajrasattva meditation and guru yoga, you have to practice in front of the merit field (tsok shing). But before you can practice either of these, you must first take refuge, which is the basis of all Buddhist practice. The actual Dak-kye ritual begins with the practice of taking refuge. The entire set of Vajrayogini's generation stage teachings includes the eleven practices known as kye-rim neljor chu chik. The first three are the yogas of sleeping, waking, and tasting nectar. These three yogas are done before we begin reciting the Dak-kye ritual; they are not included in the recitation of the sadhana. All eleven generation stage practices are described in the following lines by the Sakya patriarch Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen: Nyel dang dang dang diitsi nyang/ tse-me lama dak hlar kye/ drowa dakpey neljor dang/ pawo pami:i jin-gyi lab/ ngak de yin de nyi chik yin/ sam-gyi mi kyab neljor dang/ chi:ilam-gyi ni neljor tef detar neljor chu chik go/ Sleeping, Waking, and Tasting Nectar, Yoga of lmmeasurables, Guru Yoga, and Generating Oneself as the Deity, The Yoga of Purifying Beings, Receiving Blessings from the Heroes and Heroines, Verbal and Mental Recitation, The Inconceivable Yoga, and The Yoga of Regular Activities; These are the Eleven Yogas."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"f ~nrq~·~~·~~l~·~ ~~·q~·~~·~~·l~·~ ~l·~~~·q~·~~·~~l FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD: SLEEPING YOGA WAKING YOGA YOGA OF TASTING NECTAR"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"FIRST: SLEEPING YOGA (t}p THE ELEVEN YOGAS THE FIRST THREE ARE: sleeping, waking, and tasting nectar. Birds sleep; all other animals sleep; ordinary people sleep; but yogis and yoginis should transform their sleep into extraordinary sleeping practice, which is the first yoga. How should they sleep? The easy way to do sleeping yoga is like the practice of sam mi kyab tun mong wa, or common inconceivable practice, which occurs later in the ritual. The incon-ceivable practice can be divided into two types: common in-conceivable practice (sam mi kyab tun mong wa) and unique inconceivable practice (sam mi kyab tun mong ma yin pa). The one I am referring to here is the common inconceivable yoga. There are two sleeping practices: one relates to generation stage ('/eye-rim) and the other to completion stage (dzok-rim ). The generation stage sleeping practice involves a more elaborate visualization than the completion stage sleeping practice, and can be done by those who prefer to do extensive visualizations. The dzok-rim sleeping yoga is easier to practice because the visualization is not elaborate. Therefore, you should do this one as your regular daily practice. The visualization is the same as that of the common inconceivable yoga, which is the tenth of the eleven generation stage yogas. First, emanate light rays from your heart.

At this point, your body dissolves into the Bam syllable in your heart. That syllable then dissolves from the bottom up as far as the nada flame. Finally, the nada flame also dissolves into clear light. That clear light is a state in which all phenomena, including your body and mind, have dissolved into emptiness. You should meditate on this state for a short time just before you fall asleep so that you sleep in a state of meditation in which you are perceiving nothing but emptiness. If you wake up during the night you have to recall this meditation and go back to sleep reflecting on it. For an ordinary person sleep is just sleep, a temporary mental state that simply enjoys sleeping. But for yogis and yoginis even sleep can be used as a form of meditation to perceive shunyata. You also have to think that your mind is a Buddha's jftanadharmakaya or wisdom body. A Buddha's omniscience is always absorbed in the realization of shunyata. Similarly, your mind should be meditating on shunyata while you sleep. This is the actual meaning of sleeping practice."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"f:IRSl:.

The sleeping practice of meditating on shunyata is a method of purifying your mind. Of course the purest mind is a Buddha's jiianadharmakaya. The practice of perceiving your mind as Buddha's wisdom purifies your mind. Therefore, we call sleeping practice tuk dakpa, the mind that is pure. Tuk means mind; dakpa means pure, making it pure through the practice of sleeping yoga. At this point you wake up from that pure mind. As you wake up begin by thinking, \"If I were to stay in meditation on shunyata I could not directly help all sentient beings. In order to help them I must wake up in the physical form of Vajrayogini's nirmanakaya or form body.\"' You have already made your mind pure during sleep.

Mter waking up you are ready to make your speech clean. When most people wake up they need to wash their mouth with Scope to clean their breath. Here, instead of Scope you have to clean your speech with holy nectar by tasting it in the morning. How do you do this? First you stir the inner offering (which will be discussed later) three times counterclockwise with the left ring finger. Then take the essence-one drop-with the thumb and ring finger. Draw a triangle (which represents the chonjung, or dharma source) on your right hand, starting at the base of the palm. Visualize an Om syllable there. As you say \"Om\" aloud, make the first line to the upper right of your palm. Then visualize an Ah syllable there. As you say the syllable \"Ah,\" draw a line to the left side of your palm, where you visualize a Hung syllable. Then as you say \"Hung,\" draw the third side of the triangle. After that, pick up the essence of the nectar from the middle of that dharma source. The nectar's essence is bliss-voidness wisdom.

After those substances have been purified, they flow back through the channels and completely fill the central channel, causing you to experience great bliss. As you experience that great bliss, meditate on the emptiness of agent, object, and action. Meditate on this blissful experience of emptiness for a while. Since this practice purifies everything that you experience from the throat, it also purifies your speech. That is why this is called sung dakpa or speech that is pure. These three practices are described in the following lines from the Extensive Monlam Prayer: Nyel dang datsi nyangwey neljor-gyi/ Go sum gawa sum Ia rOlwar shokf May my three doors delight in the three joys Through the yogas of sleeping, waking, and tasting nectar. The three doors refer to your body, speech, and mind. The three joys refer to the great bliss that you experience when you do these three practices. The meaning of these three joys is the same as the three purities of Chakrasamvara's system. You should have a small container for your inner offering nectar so that you can practice the third yoga every morning. The nectar is prepared by dissolving a holy nectar pill in some black tea. This will last a long time even though you use it every day. However, that holy nectar pill should be a proper one containing the blessing of holy lamas. The nectar pills I have given you contain the blessings of Yongzin Yeshe Gyeltsen's inner offering nectar. We believe this lama was a reincarnation of Je Tsongkapa. These pills also contain the blessings of the First Panchen Lama Lobsang Chokyi Gyeltsen, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama Thupten Gyatso, K yabje Pabongka Rinpoche, and Kyabje Trijang Dorje Chang.

Generally, you should think, \"For the purpose of achieving that goal I am going to eat, drink, or work on something; for that purpose I am going to read or write something, or help other people.\" You should do everything with that motivation. Until you hear about a great skill like this, of course you won't know about it. Once you have heard it you have gained very useful knowledge. Any good action that you do with this unique motivation becomes a cause for achieving Vajrayogini's state of ultimate union. This is certainly true for virtuous actions."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"There are three kinds of activities: virtuous, neutral, and nonvirtuous. With an excellent motivation you can definitely turn good deeds into causes for achieving Buddhahood. By the power of your motivation you can also turn neutral activities into causes that will bring Buddhahood. Sometimes it's even possible to turn what would otherwise be bad activities into causes for achieving Buddhahood. Knowing about this is a great skill. Such knowledge is a characteristic that relates to the Mahayana field, showing the great importance of your motivation. The name of the fourth practice is the yoga of immeasurables. This yoga includes taking refuge and generating unique bodhichitta. The purpose of going for refuge is to help all sentient beings, to protect them. There are so many sentient beings they cannot be counted; therefore, they are immeasurable. This is one way to understand the use of the word \"immeasurable.\" Taking refuge and generating bodhichitta also include the practices that are known as the \"four immeasurables.\" Additionally, the fourth yoga contains the practice of instantly arising as Vajrayogini, blessing the inner and outer offerings, and Vajrasattva meditation. It is important to understand the structure of the practice. First you begin with taking refuge, the basis of all Buddhist practice. There are many levels to taking refuge; here you are doing the highest kind of taking refuge and generating the highest kind of bodhichitta in the form of the unique tantric motivation. These are the basic knowledges. You also have to clean your mind by getting rid of your bad deeds. Without doing so you won't gain spiritual realizations very easily and you will have difficulty making progress in your practice. Obstacles will block you, which is why you have to remove your bad deeds. The method for getting rid of them is Vajrasattva meditation. THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OFT AKING REFUGE What are we doing when we take refuge in the merit field? This is like going before these holy beings and asking them, \"Please give me ultimate insurance.\" This ultimate insurance relates to samsara's"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"{:ouRrh f}o[p 3 I general problems and to the special problems of Mahayana practitioners. Briefly, all samsara's problems come from karma and the mental afflictions (le dan~ nyon mong ). These are very important. Le means karma, or deeds; nyon mong means the afflicted mental states, or the motivation that produces karma. These two main causes result in endless suffering for both ourselves and others. This is the meaning of samsara' s general suffering. There are also many specific levels of suffering. First, there are the sufferings of the three lower realms, which are very heavy and last an extremely long time. In the three higher realms the suffering is lighter, but still there are many, many problems. We buy ordinary insurance after thinking about the general samsaric suffering that will come to us. However, without the ultimate insurance we will have to experience the endless and unbelievably heavy suffering that is caused by karma and the mental afflictions. But this suffering can be stopped if we gain that ultimate insurance. Then, even when samsara's suffering does come, the Three Ratnas4 can help and protect us. That is the purpose of taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The three objects that we visualize when taking refuge are the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Taking refuge in them is a way of getting insurance and protection. In one sense each of these represents a quality that was achieved by other practitioners. Through their efforts they achieved the status of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Because they are qualified, they have the knowledge and power to protect us. That is why we go to them for refuge. When we take refuge in them we think, \"Please help me with my problems.\" The Buddha, the teacher, is like a doctor in a hospital. The Dharma is like a doctor's advice and medicine. The Sangha is like the nurses who are the doctor's helpers. When we get very sick, we go to the hospital because only those people are trained to help us and no one else.

Now, who else can help us besides doctors? Nurses, or those who assist the doctors, can also help us. The Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Aryas are like nurses; they are following the same path and receiving the same instruction; they too are trying to achieve the ultimate insurance. Since they can help us to understand the teaching, they are an infall1ble object of taking refuge. When we are sick the doctor gives us advice and the nurses tend us. By following the doctor's advice and taking the medicine as instructed, we can regain our strength and recover. Regaining our strength while staying in the hospital is like going for refuge to the Three Ratnas. After receiving their instruction and practicing it well, we will achieve the paths, step by step, and eventually we will reach the ultimate goal. Achieving that goal is our ultimate insurance. What is taking refuge? When we are looking for insurance that will protect us from samsara's suffering, we discover that only the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha can help us. This is why we take refuge in them. There are two ways of taking refuge: the first is to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha that other beings have already achieved. They have the ability to help you. This is called gyu kyab. Gyu means cause; kyab means protection or refuge. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha that other beings have already achieved are the gyu kyab because they serve as causes for you to achieve your own Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. By receiving and practicing the instruction that they themselves carried out, you too will achieve their status in the future; you will have reached a safe place and be saved automatically; you will have gained the ultimate insurance, which is the result Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. This result Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha that you yourself will eventually achieve is the second kind of object of refuge or dre kyab. Dre means result; kyab means protection or refuge.

Real taking refuge happens in your mind through understanding their qualities and believing that the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha can help you.

Although the opening words dun-gyi namkar lama korlo dompa yab yum identify the central figure as Lama Chakrasamvara in union with his consort, the central figure that you actually visualize is Lama Buddha Vajradharma alone, without a consort.

He sits on a throne surrounded by the lineage lamas. This first group is made up of the root and lineage lamas. To their right, or to your left as you face them, is the second group made up of Buddha Shakyamuni in the center surrounded by all the Sutrayana Buddhas.

Visualize that she is surrounded by the four essence dakinis who, in tum, are surrounded by the remaining thirty-two dakinis: eight body dakinis, eight speech dakinis, eight mind dakinis, four corner dakinis, and four door dakinis. Surrounding them are at least four rows of tantric deities, representing the four levels of tantra. At the back, behind all of these groups, visualize a huge mountain of Dharma volumes whose actual essence is the knowledge, omniscience, and inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom (detong nyi su mepey yeshe) of all the beings in this refuge field. Each letter in these volumes blazes with light and emits its own sound. In a row at the front edge of this whole assemblage are the Dharma protectors.

Dun-gyi namkar means in the space in front of you where you visualize the object of refuge. The nature of this space and your own nature are the wisdom that is inseparable from bliss.

This means that the entire refuge field is combined in the one Buddha Vajradharma-his outer form represents the Sangha Jewel; his speech represents the Dharma Jewel; and his mind represents the Buddha Jewel. Thinking about him in this way, you can then take refuge. Just closing your eyes and reciting these words is not taking refuge. The right way to take refuge is to think about your own and all other sentient beings' problems, to recognize that you need a protector, and to realize that the only infallible protector is the Three Jewels. This is the proper motivation for taking refuge. In this Vajrayogini teaching system there are two kinds of activities that relate to the instruction. First you have to receive the instructions in class, then you have to put them into practice when you are sitting on your cushion. But before you can put the instructions into practice, you have to make sure you have a correct understanding of all their meanings, including the words of the ritual and how to do all the visualizations. First of all, the cause of taking refuge is the practitioner's awareness of samsara's general problems as well as the more specific problems. \"I need protection. Please help me. I take refuge in you"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"with the belief that you can help me, that you can protect me.\" But this is not enough. You should also be thinking about other beings' problems. This is the motivation for taking refuge according to the Mahayana tantric system. Besides thinking of your own problems, you should think about how to remove other beings' problems and how to make them free. This compassion for other beings should be your most important concern. The two most crucial elements in Vajrayogini's generation stage practice are to cultivate clear appearances (sel-nang) and divine pride (hla-yi nga-8Yel). As you take refuge, visualize yourself in the form of Vajrayogini in the center of a great gathering. By doing this you are maintaining dear appearances. However, when you do the refuge practice and Vajrasattva meditation, you should only keep dear appearances in which you visualize yourself in Vajrayogini's nirmanakaya form and suspend divine pride. While taking refuge and doing Vajrasattva meditation you shouldn't think, \"I am Vajrayogini\" and identify yourself as having achieved her status since you have to recognize and acknowledge your problems to the object of refuge. What problems do you have? Vajrayogini's nirmanakaya doesn't have any problems or anything to purify. Of course she doesn't-but you do. That is why you have to suspend divine pride when taking refuge and doing Vajrasattva meditation. On the other hand, you should still maintain the clear appearance of yourself in Vajrayogini's outer form because that is what prevents your activities from becoming those of an ordinary person, and allows them to be more efficient and powerful. Because you have so many powerful obstacles, you need a great warrior to fight them, which is why you have to visualize yourself in Vajrayogini's form. At this point, while seated in front of the object of refuge you should be thinking about your own samsaric problems, as well as those of other beings. Visualize your mother next to you on your left, and your father on the right. It doesn't matter whether they are living or have passed away. Directly in front of you, visualize any enemies you may have. It's important that you realize that all of these beings are no different from you; you are all suffering and wish to be free from suffering. You should also visualize that all the beings of the six realms-hell beings, hungry ghosts, animals, human beings, demigods, and"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"{:O£IRrh {)ofitl 37 gods-a countless number of mother beings, surround you. You don't have to think of this as a specific number of beings since what is measureless cannot be counted. But in your mind you should think that all sentient beings are gathered there. Our instruction says that we have to visualize the beings of all six realms in human form even though they are experiencing the suffering of their own realm. As you take refuge, visualize that all the beings surrounding you are taking refuge along with you and that you are leading the recitation like a chant leader or um-dze.

Dzokpey sang-gye chomden de nam means completely enlightened Buddhas, the Blessed Ones; Ia kyab su chi wo means I take refuge in them. A completely enlightened Buddha is one who has abandoned all the obstacles and achieved all the knowledges. Once you have achieved this, you become a Buddha. \"Blessed One\" refers to certain characteristics of a Buddha. 5 Dampey cho nam means supreme Dharma; Ia kyab su chi wo means 1 take refuge in the supreme Dharma, which is represented by that huge collection of scriptures behind the group of lamas. Pakpey gendun nam means the Arya San~ha; Ia kyab su chi wo means 1 take refuge in the Sangha of Realized Ones. Here, you focus on the group that is to your right, whose central figure is Mafi.jushri, as well as the row of Dharma protectors at the very front. The group surrounding Maii.jushri is made up of the Arhats and Aryas of all three vehicles. Reflect that with great dignity, you lead all sentient beings in taking refuge. The commentaries describe that thinking this way is a good omen signifying that in the future all sentient beings will become your followers. Once you have achieved Buddhahood, or Lama Vajrayogini's sun~juk status, they will come to you to receive the Dharma. THE BENEFITS OF TAKING REFUGE There are eight benefits of taking refuge: 1) we will become Buddhists; 2) it is the foundation for the vows; 3) it removes bad karma; 4) we accumulate great merit; 5) we will be protected from harm; 6) we will avoid falling into the lower states; 7) we will achieve our goals; and 8) we will attain Buddhahood. Since the benefits of taking refuge include achieving Buddhahood, it is no small practice-it is unbelievably great. The first of the benefits is that you will become a Buddhist. If someone asks you, \"What religion are you?\" and you say, \"I am a 5See explanation of \"Blessed One\" below, pp. 210-211."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Buddhist,\" whether you actually are a Buddhist or not depends on your having sincerely taken refuge in your mind. If you don't have the mind of taking refuge, you are not a Buddhist. The second benefit is that if you have taken refuge, you have the right to take all the vows-the Pratimoksha vows, Bodhisattva vows, and Tantric vows. The third benefit means that the act of taking refuge immediately destroys many bad deeds. The fourth benefit is that you are less likely to be reborn in the lower realms in the future. If you remove all your bad deeds, you will not go there at all.6 GENERATING BODHICHIITA If you haven't taken refuge you are not a Buddhist. Similarly, if you haven't generated bodhichitta, you are not a Mahayana practitioner. Bodhichitta is extremely important. Just as taking refuge has many benefits, bodhichitta also has great benefits. However, a discussion of these would be too broad to include here.? Generating bodhichitta means to develop the wish to achieve Buddhahood. Bodhi means a Buddha's enlightenment; clzitta means mind. You should want very much to achieve this goal as soon as possible. The unique way of generating bodhichitta is to seek to achieve enlightenment yourself within this very lifetime as soon as possible in order to benefit all sentient beings, to liberate them. That kind of mind is bodhichitta. But in order to accomplish this you have to do some kind of practice. At this point you should think, \"I am going to listen to and then practice the Vajrayogini teachings for that purpose.\" 6For a discussion of the eight benefits of taking refuge, see pp. 213-219 of Liberation in Our Hands, Vol. II, by Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche, tr.

Complete enlightenment means abandoning all the obstacles and achieving all the knowledges and cessations. If you accomplish that, you become a Buddha. Semchen tamche means all sentient beings; korwey du-ngel-gyi gyatso means the ocean of samsara's suffering. Samsara's suffering is not small; it is deeper than an ocean and wider than space.

Nyam su langwar gyi wo means I will practice them. THE FOUR 1 MMEASURABLES Vajrayogini's paths are not just some small practice. For instance, at this point you have to learn and be able to practice the four immeasurables-a well-known Mahayana practice that even"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"beginners must know. \"Immeasurable\" comes from the fact that the object of your practice is all sentient beings who are beyond count. There are four meditations in relation to that immeasurable object. The first of the four immeasurables is equanimity, which means not distinguishing among beings. Distinguishing would be dividing sentient beings in your mind, thinking, \"I want to help these, but not those.\" You can't think like that. Equanimity is thinking about all sentient beings equally, about how you will help them. The words semchen tamche (all sentient beings) in this part of the recitation refer to the practice of immeasurable equanimity. The second practice is immeasurable compassion, indicated by the words of the text korwey du-ngel-gyi gyatso le drel ne (after liberating all sentient beings from the ocean of samsara's suffering). When we recite these words we should think about beings' suffering in samsara and want very much to liberate them from that condition. After you have liberated all sentient beings from samsara's suffering, what will you do? The third practice, immeasurable loving kindness, is expressed directly by the words dzokpey jangchub-kyi dewa Ia go par ja (I will establish them in the bliss of complete enlightenment). Loving kindness is an attitude of wanting beings to have the happiness that they lack. Indirectly, these words indicate the fourth practice, immeasurable joy, which is to think how nice it will be when they attain that happiness once you've established them in Buddhahood. Also included in this part of the recitation are generating the two kinds of bodhichitta-wishing bodhichitta and engaging bodhichitta. Generating wishing bodhichitta is expressed by the words Semchen tamche korwey du-ngel-gyi gyatso le drel ne dzokpey jangchub-kyi dewa Ia go par ja (1 shall attain the status of a completely enlightened Buddha. After liberating all sentient beings from the ocean of samsara's suffering, I will establish them in the bliss of complete enlightenment).

The main method of practice is expressed by the words, \"For that purpose, I am going to practice all the levels of Vajrayogini's paths.\" The two main parts of Vajrayogini's path are generation and completion stage practices. These stages are also mentioned in the verse at the end of the supplication section of the sadhana (see page 124). Kye-rim sabmo kacho neljor dang/ Dzok-rim u-mey neljor gompey tii/ Dechen hlenkye yeshe kyewa dang/ Kacho gopang topar jin-gyi lob/ By the power of practicing the profound yoga Of the generation stage and the central channel yoga of the completion stage, Please bless me to achieve innate wisdom of great bliss and the Queen of Kechara' s status. Once you have done the practices of generating bodhichitta and the four immeasurables, you are qualified to enter the Mahayana Dharma field and practice the Mahayana paths. Taking refuge allowed you to enter the Buddhist path. Without taking refuge, you don't have the right to practice any of the Buddhist paths. Without bodhichitta, you don't have the right to practice the Mahayana path, and even if you tried, it wouldn't work.

The object of refuge emits light rays, which touch you and all the sentient beings surrounding you. These light rays are the blessing of the refuge object's body, speech, and mind. First, visualize that the light rays touch all sentient beings around you and bum away all their impurities of body, speech, and mind. Then those beings tum into Vajrayogini's form. By virtue of having achieved her power, they fly to Dakpa Kacho like a group of startled birds. In Dakpa Kachii they can see Chakrasamvara, Vajrayogini, and all the dakas and dakinis directly and stay there together enjoying that paradise with them."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Finally, that whole object of refuge itself turns into light. That light dissolves into you and you receive the blessings of their body, speech, and mind. The last part of this visualization is what the words of the Dak-kye describe.

Kar mar ting sum means white, red, and blue light. Visualize that. the .Sangha ·greup turns into white light, representing the blessings of all the Buddhas' bodies. The huge mountain of Dharma scriptures turns into red light, which represents the blessings of all the Buddhas' speech. Finally, the group of Buddhas and lamas turns into blue light, representing all the Buddhas' minds. Nampar shu ne means the object of refuge turns into three kinds of light. Rang la timpey means the light dissolves into me. The white light rays dissolve into the top of your head; the red light rays dissolve into your throat; and the blue light rays dissolve into your heart. Because of that, you receive the Three Jewels' blessings of body, speech, and mind. Ku sung tuk-kyi jinlab means blessings of body, speech, and mind. Topar gyur means you receive those blessings. INSTANTLY ARISING AS V A]RAYOGINI By the power of receiving those blessings your own body turns into light; this light shrinks into the double dharma source (chiinjung) in your heart. The dharma source then dissolves into the moon cushion, the moon cushion dissolves into the mantra syllables, and the mantra syllables dissolve into the Bam syllable. The Bam syllable dissolves from the base up to the head of the letter; the head of the letter continues dissolving into the crescent, the circle, the first bend of the nada, the second bend of the nada, and the third bend of the nada, which itself dissolves into shunyata. At this point you have to meditate on taking death as the path to the dharmakaya (chiwa chii kii lam kyer). This process of dissolution corresponds directly to the way an ordinary person experiences death. A person who is dying experiences a series of dissolutions that follow one after the other"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"until actual death occurs. For an ordinary person this final stage of actual death can only be followed by an ordinary bardo. As a practitioner, instead of letting yourself experience ordinary death, you have to transform it into the clear light of a Buddha's wisdom body. That wisdom body is similar to an ordinary person's death. This practice of taking ordinary death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body has four qualities. It is very important to know them. The first quality is called \"complete absence of appearances\" (nangwa tong sangwa ). Nangwa means objects appearing to your mind. Tong sangwa means complete emptiness. The \"sangwa\" in the expression tong sangwa is an intensifier that means something like \"vividly empty.\" At this time the practitioner must be careful not to fall into either of the two extremes, which we call tak-ta and che-ta, or eternalism and nihilism. What does that emptiness look like? Is nothing there or not? You cannot say there is nothing there. If you deny that there is nothing there, then what is there? Something is there, but what is that something? It is self-existentlessness, the absence of self-existence. That is there. That is just the negation of self-existence. That self-existentlessness is there. Therefore, emptiness is not nothingness. There is something there; that is the real nature of everything-your real nature, your mind's real nature, and the real nature of all other entities. If you understand what emptiness of self-existence means, you won't fall into the eternalist extreme when you meditate. Tak-ta means the eternalist extreme. For example, although I am not a self-existent person, if I believe I am a self-existent person, the object of this belief would be the eternalist extreme (tak-ta ). Because its object does not exist, that view is wrong. Therefore, I am not a self-existent person. I am self-existentless, a self-existentless phenomenon. That self-existentlessness is my real nature. The other extreme is explained as follows. If someone were to think, \"If I am not a self-existent person, then I do not exist at all.\" This is the other extreme view, the object of which is the nihilist extreme (che-ta). Although I am not a self-existent person, I still exist; I am here; I am sitting, I am talking, I am thinking; I am doing something. It is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"reasonable to have that belief. If you have this understanding, you will be free from the nihilist extreme. Falling into the nihilist extreme terminates your existence. The nihilist view holds that if you are not self-existent, then you cannot be there at all. This means you are finished. You are no longer there. That is a wrong view whose object is the other extreme. These are very important points. The two extreme views are mentioned in this verse from the Three Principal Aspects of the Path ( lam-gyi tsowo nam sum). Shm yang nangwey yo ta sel wa dang/ Tongpey me ta sel shing tongpa nyi/ Gyu dang drebur charwey tsul she naf Tar dzin tawey trokpar mi gyur ro/ Moreover, when you realize how appearances remove the extreme of being, And voidness removes the extreme of non-being, And how to perceive voidness in causes and effects, You will not be overcome by any extremist view. The words tar dzin tawey mean these two extreme wrong views. They are like big thieves. If you gain a perfect understanding of the middle view, these extremes cannot steal your mind. If you understand these extremes and develop the correct view or yang dakpey tawa, you will be able to stay in the middle without falling to either side. It was Mafijushri who gave us the expression \"three principal aspects of the path,\" which refers to renunciation, bodhichitta, and correct view. This knowledge about correct view is very important for tantric practitioners. A mechanic or other skilled worker first has to gain knowledge from study and experience and then become skilled in using his tools; otherwise, he cannot do his work nicely. You, as a tantric practitioner, need to develop a perfect understanding of emptiness together with bodhichitta in order to achieve the results of tantric practice. Bodhichitta and correct view of emptiness are the main qualities of the tantric path from beginning to end. As I mentioned, the emptiness you tum into is an emptiness that is not nothing, but rather an emptiness that is a lack of self-existence."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"foUiu:h ()o[P IJ7 Nangwa tong sangwa means that all appearances have dissolved completely into emptiness. This first quality of taking death as the path to the dharmakaya keeps you from falling into the etemalist extreme. The second quality of this practice is the subjective awareness of the lack of self-existence or nge ngor rangshin mepa. This refers to the awareness of the self-existentlessness of all phenomena, particularly yourself and your mind. This keeps you from falling into the nihilist extreme. You won't fall into nihlism because you are aware that you exist there as the one who is meditating, thinking, holding an object, perceiving something. What you are meditating about is shunyata. When you are meditating about shunyata, what does your mind, the subject, look like? Your mind, that subject, is wisdom-the wisdom that perceives your real nature. What kind of wisdom is that subject? Is it a general wisdom? No, it is a wisdom that experiences great ecstasy. That subject is not only wisdom, it is wisdom combined with great ecstasy. This is the third quality of taking death as the path to the dharmakaya, called the experience of great bliss, or nyong yul dewa chenpo. How did you gain this great ecstasy? By dissolving everything into the Bam syllable inside your heart chakra within the uma nerve or central channel. That is where everything is done. All your actions-thinking, meditating, and perceiving-occur inside the uma nerve. At the same time the subject's air is also functioning inside the uma. When the air moves inside the uma, especially in the heart chakra, you experience great ecstasy, since this is a characteristic of that most subtle air. That great ecstasy is what the subject is experiencing. What stage has this subject reached? Should you be thinking that this subject is a mind that is still cultivating the path? No; you have to think that this is a mind that has achieved the result of the path, that it is a Buddha's wisdom body or jftanadharmakaya. Identifying yourself with this wisdom body, you should think, \"This Buddha's wisdom body is me; I am that.\" This is the fourth quality of the practice, or identifying yourself with a Buddha's wisdom body (cho kii nga-gyel shakpa). The practice of taking death as the path to the dharmakaya is one in which you meditate on emptiness while experiencing great ecstasy"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"and identify that with the path's result-a Buddha's wisdom body. It is called taking death as the path to the dharmakaya (chiwa cho kii lam kyer) because you as a yogi or yogini are practicing to achieve the dharmakaya by means of a meditation that corresponds exactly to the way an ordinary person dies. From the very beginning you generated the motivation, \"I must achieve sungjuk dorje chang's status, or Buddhahood, because I cannot bear to wait for such a long time to liberate all sentient beings.\" Having made that decision, you should now think, \"If I remain in this state, I will be very happy and peaceful, but meanwhile all mother sentient beings will be experiencing suffering. A Buddha's ultimate wisdom combined with bliss is a quality that ordinary persons cannot perceive, nor can even high Bodhisattvas, Arhats, or Aryas. Only Buddhas can perceive each other's omniscience. But if unenlightened sentient beings cannot perceive me, then 1 cannot help them directly. Therefore, I must appear in a physical form that at least Bodhisattva Aryas can perceive.\" Now visualize that out of emptiness there appear a lotus and sun cushion. On top of the sun cushion there appears a red light about the size of a thumb, whose nature is the combination of your most subtle mind and its air. That light arises from the dharmakaya's combination of wisdom and bliss. It is similar to an ordinary bardo being. You have to recognize it as yourself having arisen in a Buddha's enjoyment body or sambhogakaya. \"Although this body can be seen by high Bodhisattvas and Aryas, it cannot be seen by everyone. Since it cannot benefit all sentient beings, I must appear in a form that everyone can see.\" Thinking this, visualize that you turn into Vajrayogini's emanation body or nirmanakaya. The wisdom body, the enjoyment body, and the emanation body are a Buddha's three bodies. Generating them is the practice known as \"taking the three bodies as the path\" or ku sum lam kyer. In order to practice this you need to have the structure in your mind. What are you doing? You are practicing to achieve the path's result, which is a Buddha's three bodies. How do you do this? By practicing paths that are similar in form both to a Buddha's three bodies and to the three ordinary states of death, bardo, and rebirth. What is the result?

With a ritual we transform these substances into the inner offering. First, let me give an easy explanation of what inner offering is. A person is made up of five heaps (pungpo nga). The first three are form heap (suk-kyi pungpo), feeling heap (tsorwey pungpo), and conception heap (dushe-kyi pungpo ). The fourth we call the heap of compositional factors (du-je-kyi pun gpo). This heap includes all the other secondary mental states excluding feelings and conceptions. The name \"compositional factor\" refers in particular to the mental state that collects and puts together objects, subjects, and sense powers. Your anger is one of the mental states included in this fourth heap. The main compositional factor puts together your anger, your enemy, and your eye sense power. When these three factors come together, you see your enemy's face. The mind grasps this object and perceives it as your enemy. The function of the fourth heap is to combine subject, object, and sense powers; while it does this it can also produce the mental afflictions. This is an example of how this heap functions negatively. However, an example of how it functions positively is when this heap puts together the image of a Buddha, the eye sense power, and the eye consciousness, and produces faith. Generally speaking, there are many mental states. The Hinayana Vaibhashika school system lists forty-six; the Mahayana schools list fifty-one. Of these, feeling and conception are grouped as separate heaps. All the other mental states are grouped together in the fourth heap. The fifth heap is made up of consciousness (namshe-kyi pungpo ). The five heaps, then, are form, feeling, conception, compositional factors, and consciousness. These heaps are mentioned in the Heart Sutra: suk me, tsorwa me, dushe me, du-je me, nampar shepa me ... ,\" [There is] no form, no feeling, no conception, no compositional factors, and no consciousness.\" This means that they"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52 Sunl1mc J}dr:h w kcc:h»«\\ f}dRo.d1sc are not self-existent. These words teach the shunyata of the five heaps. The five heaps must be purified through your tantric practice. Once you have completely purified them, they turn into the five Buddha families: the eastern Buddha Vairochana, the northern Buddha Amoghasiddhi, the central Buddha Akshobhya, the western Buddha Amitabha, and the southern Buddha Ratnasambhava. In addition to having five heaps, you also have five elements. Four of these are the familiar ones of earth, water, fire, and air. The fifth element is represented by the consciousness heap, which is also known as the consciousness element. Sometimes six elements are described. When numbered this way space is recognized as the sixth element. An example of these ordinary elements is the earth element, which, if you are old or sick, you may try to make more flexible by stretching and exercising. It is these five elements that you are trying to purify. At some point, when you have finally purified all of them, they will turn into the five dakinis, or the five consorts of the five Buddhas. Now the five fleshes and the five nectars have to be explained. These ten substances are related to the completion stage practice. Therefore, the substances are visualized according to whether you are practicing a mother tantra or a father tantra system. Because this Vajrayogini practice belongs to the mother tantra class, the inner offering substances and the method of practicing them are related to the high knowledges of completion stage practice. There are four stages to preparing the inner offering: clearing, dissolving, generating, and blessing (sangwa, jangwa, kyepa, jin-gyi laba). CLEARING AWAY BAD SPIRITS Clearing (sangwa) means to make free. To make free of what? Before the inner offering has been blessed, any bad spirit can come and enjoy it in the same way that flies go to food. Although you can't see bad spirits, demons, or devils, they definitely come because it's so easy for them. They cling to the substances and enjoy them. Therefore, you cannot bless the inner offering unless you first chase"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"~Cx.mrh {)o{}d 53 them away. The mantra you recite in order to dear these spirits away is Om kandarohi hung hung pet. The container that you use for your inner offering is usually kept covered. Our lineage instructs that you remove the lid as you recite the mantra. At the same time, visualize that you emanate many Kandarohi dakinis from the nada flame of the Bam syllable in your heart. In this system, we usually visualize Kandarohi as having only two hands, but while blessing the inner offering, we visualize her as having four hands. In one pair of hands she holds a chopknife and nectar-filled skullcup, just like Vajrayogini. In the second pair she holds a damaru and katvanka. These dakinis come out from your heart and chase bad spirits very far away. After they have done their job you have to withdraw them into the nada flame in your heart. Withdrawing them into your Bam syllable's nada has a significance that relates to the aim of completion stage practice. The recitation of the Kandarohi mantra is like announcing, \"I am going to bless the inner offering.\" The first time you recite Om kandarohi hung hung pet you don't actually spray any of the inner offering nectar. DISSOLVING INTO EMPTINESS Dissolving (jangwa) refers to dissolving the skullcup and all the substances into emptiness. Visualize this as you recite the words Om svabhava shuddha sarva dharma svabhava shuddho ham/ Tongpa nyi du gyur. This means that all these substances and their container dissolve into emptiness. GENERATING 1HE PURE SUBSTANCES Tongpey ngang le means from that emptiness. Yam le lung means in the space of that emptiness a Yam syllable appears, which then becomes the wind mandala. The Yam syllable is a letter Ya with a circle above it. The shape of the wind mandala is a half moon, with the flat part facing you. All the classes of tantra follow the philosophical system of the Madhyamika school, which holds that all entities are merely ascribed. Ascribed by what? By terms and conceptual knowledge."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The term being ascribed here is \"wind mandala.\" With this term, and the conceptual knowledge of its meaning, this half-moon-shaped wind mandala comes into existence. Because this wind mandala is merely ascribed, it does not exist in and of itself-it is not self-existent. The wind mandala is ascribed in relation to a collection of things that represent the basis of ascription. By understanding that the wind mandala is something whose existence is merely ascribed, the practitioner knows that it cannot be self-existent. This way you can gain right view. For an entity to be ascribed you need a basis of ascription, a term, and correct conceptual knowledge. Through this process of ascription, functional objects come into being. This explanation teaches you the meaning of dependent origination or tendrel. Is this air element relative truth or ultimate truth? It is relative truth, not ultimate truth. How do we know? Because the thing that we are talking about is an ascribed object whose nature is voidness. The circle above the Ya letter refers to the voidness that is the wind mandala's real nature. Its real nature is empty just like that circle. Therefore, that circle teaches you that the wind mandala's quality is emptiness. The letter Yam teaches you that it is just ascribed on its basis and that its relative truth nature is a merely ascribed existence. These two are mutually supportive. If it is just ascribed, that is to say, if it relies on something else, it cannot be self-existent; therefore, that circle indicates self-existentlessness. What form does emptiness take? In what form does it appear to us? It appears as all manner of functional objects. It is in this way that appearance and emptiness are mutually supportive. This explanation about the Yam syllable teaches the philosophy of the Madhyamika school. Such understanding is a main knowledge in tantric practice. That is what the phrase Yam le lung means. Ram le me means from a Ram syllable the fire mandala appears. Ah le min-go gye bu sum means from Ah syllables appear three human heads arranged as hearthstones. In each comer of the fire mandala appears a letter Ah. The one in the far right comer is white, the one in the far left is red, and the one in the comer closest to you is blue. These Ah syllables then turn into three freshly severed human heads, which are arranged here as hearthstones. When you go camping and"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"want to prepare food, you have to make a fireplace with at least three stones. Then, when you make the fire, you can put your pot over those three stones and cook something. These stones are what we call tab-do. That is how these human heads are being used here. These three heads, which are white, red, and blue represent three states of mind that come just before you attain clear light, particularly the proximate clear light of the completion stage. The first one is called \"white luminosity\" (nangwa karlampa ); this state is also represented by the first of the three bends in the Bam syllable's nada. The second state is called \"red radiance\" (chepa marlampa), represented by the second bend of the Bam syllable's nada. The third is called \"black near-attainment\" ( nyer tob naklampa), represented by the third bend of the nada. The three states of white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment and the practice of taking the three bodies as the path that occur in both the generation and completion stage practices are also represented in this ritual for blessing the inner offering. Teng du means on top of these three heads. Ah le topa means that an Ah syllable appears that turns into a skullcup. Yang shing gya chewey means the skull is not small but huge and spacious. Nang du means inside that skull. Om Kam Am Tram Hung nam le diitsi nga means the five nectars appear in that skull from the syllables Om, Kam, Am, Tram, and Hung. In the father tantra system both the nectars and the fleshes are arranged clockwise, with the fleshes visualized first in the cardinal directions. In the mother tantra system, however, the five nectars are visualized first, and are arranged counterclockwise starting in the east, at the forehead part of the skull, which is closest to you. In the east, a white Om syllable, the seed of Vairochana, turns into the first nectar, yellow feces, marked by a white Om syllable. The Om syllable's essence is mirror wisdom (melong yeshe). If I were to hold up a mirror in front of you, everything, including you, would appear in it. Similarly, all entities appear simultaneously to a Buddha's wisdom. In this way we can understand how that wisdom is like a mirror. How is this nectar different from ordinary feces? It is extraordinary because it appears from the seed syllable for the eastern Buddha Vairochana, whose essence is a Buddha's mirror"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"56 Suol1mc {Jc\\c 11 w kcc:l~\\ ~rlrsc wisdom. This feces' existence is just ascribed; it is not self-existent. This is shown by the circle that appears above the Om syllable, which marks the feces. In the north, a green Kam syllable, the seed of Amoghasiddhi, turns into white brain matter, marked by a green letter Kam. The Kam syllable's essence is performance wisdom (jadrup yeshe). In other tantras \"great flesh\" (sha chen) is interpreted as meaning bone marrow, but here it refers to brain matter. The skullcup that Vajrayogini holds is filled with red bodhichitta and brain matter. In the west, a red Am syllable, the seed of Amitabha, turns into white bodhichitta or semen, marked by a red Am. The Am syllable's essence is discriminating wisdom (sortok yeshe ~ In the south, a yellow Tram syllable, the seed of Ratnasambhava, turns into red bodhichitta, marked by a yellow Tram. The Tram syllable's essence is sameness wisdom ( nyam nyi yeshe ). In the center, a blue Hung, the seed of Akshobhya, turns into blue urine marked by a blue Hung. The Hung syllable's essence is the wisdom of the dharma sphere (chiiyin~ yeshe). Lam Mam Pam Tam Bam nam le sha nga means the five fleshes appear from the syllables Lam, Mam, Pam, Tam, and Bam. Arranged clockwise starting in the southeast is a white Lam, seed of dakini Lochana, which turns into black cow flesh marked by a white Lam. In the southwest, a blue Mam, seed of dakini Mamaki, turns into red dog flesh marked by a blue Mam. In the northwest, a red Pam, seed of dakini Pandaravasana, turns into white elephant flesh marked by a red Pam. In the northeast, a green Tam, seed of dakini Tara, turns into green horse flesh marked by a green Tam. In the center, a red Bam, seed of dakini Vajravarahi, turns into red human flesh marked by a red letter Bam. These five are not pieces of flesh, but rather the whole body of those five beings. There are other tantric systems in which the heads of the four animals face the center of the skull. Here, the head of the human body in the center should face west and should also be sunk down a bit in the nectar. However, the heads of the other four animal fleshes should face out toward the rim of the skullcup. All of them should be"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"partially submerged in the nectar. There are two explanations about how to visualize the way the nectars are marked by these syllables. One tradition says to visualize the syllables as standing upright in the nectar and being partially sunk into it, and the other instructs that they be visualized just lying flat on the substance. Our lineage follows the second tradition. The syllables that mark these substances signify both their relative and ultimate truth natures. BLESSING THE SUBSTANCES Blessing the substances has three stages: purifying, transforming, and magnifying, or jan8wa, tokpa, and barwa respectively. Purifying means removing the ordinary color, taste, and smell from these substances. Lung yo means the air element is stirred; me barwey means the wind causes the fire to blaze; topey nang-gi dze nam means the substances inside the skullcup; shuwar gyur means those substances dissolve. The first part of the visualization is not described in these words of the ritual. Imagine that you send out light rays from your heart. When these reach the wind mandala, they cause that mandala's air to move, which in tum causes the fire mandala to blaze. As that fire ignites beneath the skullcup, the substances inside it become hotter and hotter. When the fire element gets hot enough, all the substances in the skull begin to boil and finally melt into one substance. At this point the substance has a very bitter taste and its color is dark orange. Boiling the substances removes impurities of color, smell, and taste. De dak-gi teng du means just above that; Hung le kyepey katvanka karpo go turdu te ne means an upside-down white kah,anka, which has arisen from a Hung syllable; shuwa means it melts into the skull. Topar hlung ne means after falling into the skull; dze de dak ngul chii dokchen du gyur means those substances turn the color of mercury. Just above the skullcup there suddenly appears a white letter Hung, which is Heruka's nature. This turns into a shiny white katvanka that hangs upside-down over the skull and looks as if it were sculpted out of butter. When the steam from the boiling"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"substances reaches the katvanka, it begins to melt, dripping into the skullcup. After swirling counterclockwise three times in the substance it dissolves and disappears. As a result, the nectar turns the color of mercury-a milky white color. The nectar is now cool and sweet. Because the katvanka has Heruka's nature, just by having fallen into that substance it transforms everything into nectar. When the Panchen Lama Lobsang Chokyi Gyeltsen did the ritual of making the inner offering, it would sometimes actually boil over as he blessed it with his meditation. He actually turned it into real nectar. Such nectar is a combination of three kinds of nectar. The first is medicinal nectar that prevents illness (nawa mepa men-gyi diitsi). When you take it, you will experience less sickness. It is a real yogi's medicine. The second is the nectar of immortality that prolongs life (chiwa mepa tse-yi diitsi). The third is the nectar of pure wisdom (sakpa mepa yeshe-kyi diitsi), which means the essence of this nectar is wisdom that is not stained by any of the mental afflictions. Because this inner offering has such qualities it gives these three great results. This nectar is so powerful that if you were to put a spoonful of it into the mouth of someone who had been dead for a week, it could bring that person back to life. This is what we call chiilen, or life-giving elixir, which famous yogis have been able to make. This ritual of making the nectar is Buddha Vajradhara's or Sang-gye Dorje Chang's own system of making We-giving elixir. It is the highest kind there is. The third stage of blessing is called magnifying (barwa), which gives the nectar a very special quality. No matter how much you use, it can never be exhausted. The amount always remains the same. Barwa means giving it that special quality of inexhaustibility. This can also be referred to as pclwa, which means increasing or becoming greater. This does not mean that the nectar will spill over, but rather that it is inexhaustible. No matter how much you use, it will never run out. The ritual describes how this quality is acquired. Dey tengdu means above that skull; yang sel-gyi trengwa means a row of the sixteen Sanskrit vowels and thirty-four consonants. The sixteen vowels are: A A I I U U ~ ~ ~ ~ E AI 0 AU AM AH. The consonants are: KA KHA GA GHA NGA CHA CHHA JA JHA NYA TA THA J;>A J;>HA ~A TA"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"f:octRrh (Jo{P 59 THADA DHA NAPA PHA BA BHA MAYA RA LA WA SHA !?HA SA HA I<$HA. Sum tsek su nepa means there are three rows arranged one on top of the other. The bottom row is white, the middle row is red, and the top row is blue. Om Ah Hung du gyur means the three rows of letters shrink together becoming a white Om, a red Ah, and a blue Hung. These are the seeds of all the Buddhas' body, speech, and mind. Woser-gyi means light rays from those syllables reach all the Buddhas' paradises. Chok chii deshin shekpa dang pawo dang neljorma tamche-kyi tuk-ka ne means from the hearts of all the Buddhas, dakas, and dakinis of the ten directions. Yeshe-kyi diitsi kuk ne means those light rays draw back wisdom nectar from their hearts. All the blessings and powers of those Buddhas' body, speech, and mind are brought back in the form of white, red, and blue nectar, which dissolves into those three letters. Nenpey means that the three letters fall into and combine with the inner offering in the skullcup. Mangpor bar shing pelwar gyur means that the wisdom nectar, when added to the inner offering in the skullcup, causes it to increase and become inexhaustible. At this point recite Om Ah Hung three times. In some schools, practitioners dip the vajra into the nectar to spray it when they recite the mantra \"Om kandarohi ... \" But in the Ganden Oral Transmission school first we recite Om kandarohi hung hung pet and then we pick up the nectar with the left ring finger and thumb. The ring finger of the left hand represents Vajrayogini and the thumb represents Chakrasamvara. Picking up the nectar with these two fingers joined, we sprinkle the offerings with that nectar. While some schools use beer and alcohol to prepare the inner offering, our school uses only black tea with a nectar pill dissolved in it. Therefore, you have to have nectar pills, or diitsi rilbu, of which there are many different kinds. We use fruit and medicinal herbs in place of those five fleshes and five nectars. Some schools use actual urine and feces. If you are a very great sage who can take a dead piece of wood, plant it, and make it take root and grow again, then you have enough spiritual power to tum those actual substances into real nectar. Such people can offer that kind of nectar to the merit field, to the objects of taking refuge, the Buddha, Dharma, and"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Sangha. If you are not that kind of yogi, you would be offering something impure and therefore be doing an unbelievably bad deed. So, you have to use tea instead. When we do the Tsok offering, however, we do use actual alcohol and meat, which are referred to by the special Sanskrit terms madana and bala, respectively. The madana represents wisdom and the bala represents great ecstasy. In order to represent the union of great bliss and emptiness, we must use actual meat and alcohol in the Tsok offering ritual. ULTIMATE MEANING OF THE INNER OFFERING The ritual for blessing the inner offering is extremely profound since it contains the whole essence of Vajrayogini's practice from the beginning up to Buddhahood. The outer wind mandala refers to the air element that supports the outer world. The wind mandala in this practice also represents our inner wind, and in particular, the wind known as the \"downward-moving wind\" (tur sel-gyi lung). This is one of the ten inner airs. It is located mainly in the lowest part of the torso. One of its functions is to control or eliminate bodily waste. When this inner air moves, it activates an inner fire. But it's not necessary to explain here about the outer fire element. The inner fire element is called tum-mo or \"the hot one,\" located in the navel chakra. When your inner air element causes this tum-mo to ignite inside the central channel, the tum-mo produces great ecstasy, which, when combined with the wisdom that realizes emptiness, is known as simultaneous bliss-wisdom. This wisdom is achieved after the dissolution of the three mental states of white luminosity (nangwa karlampa), red radiance (chepa marlampa), and black near-attainment ( nyer tob naklampa). The three human heads that are arranged like hearthstones represent these three mental states. Their dissolution is followed by the arising of the mind of clear light, which has two levels: the proximate clear light (pei wosel) and the actual clear light (dOn-gyi wosel). This clear light is the most important wisdom. The skullcup in which the substances dissolve is white on the outside and red on the inside. White represents great ecstasy and red"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"{:ouRr:h {)o[p 6 I represents wisdom. The presence of these two qualities in the skull represents the union of bliss and voidness, or the combination of great ecstasy and wisdom. The ten different substances inside the skullcup correspond to different aspects of the practitioner-the five nectars represent the five heaps and the five fleshes represent the five elements. These five heaps and five elements are the ten substances that are used \"symbolically\" to prepare the inner offering. Inner offering means that the substances that compose the nectar are not made from outer objects but rather are found in the practitioner. When the fire burns and boils, these substances turn a dark orange color that has a very bitter taste. The melting of these substances represents the purification of your five heaps and five elements. The nature of your five heaps is that they contain the seeds of the five Buddhas and the five wisdoms of a Buddha. These heaps are what are being transformed into nectar. The final stage of purification occurs during meditation when the three states of white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment dissolve into the clear light. Once they have dissolved, no impure substances remain. All of them have turned into the nature of wisdom. Those three states actually dissolve into the clear light both when you achieve the proximate clear light and when you achieve the actual clear light. These two wisdoms are only achieved at the level of the completion stage. During the generation stage you imagine yourself achieving a Buddha's wisdom of dear light when you practice taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body. At one stage in the ritual you visualized that a white katvanka melted and fell into that nectar. This caused the substances in the skullcup to change to a silvery color, to become cool, and to taste very sweet. It was at this point that the substances turned into real nectar. That real nectar symbolizes the practitioner arising from the experience of dear light into the miracle body (gyulii). The practitioner who arises from the proximate dear light enters into what is called the \"impure\" miracle body, or rna dakpey gyulii. The practitioner who arises from the actual clear light enters into what is called the \"pure\" miracle body or dakpey gyulii. This explanation is known as the ultimate meaning of the inner offering ritual."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"62 Su6lmJC P,.rh ro k.echr:\\Rd fJ.w,diSC BLESSING THE OUTER OFFERINGS Om kandarohi hung hung pet/ Om svabhava shuddha sarva dharma svabhava shuddho ham/ Tongpa nyi du gyur/ Tongpey ngang le Kam le to-pey no nam-kyi nang du Hung le cho dze nam rang shin tong nyil Nampa cho dze so so nampa chen/ Je le wangpo druk-gi cho yul du sakpa mepey dewa kye par chen terwar gyur/ Om kandarohi hung hung pet.

Inside each skullcup appears a Hung syllable; these tum into the offerings whose nature is emptiness, whose form is that of each offering, and whose function is to produce extraordinary, stainless bliss when experienced by the six sense powers. In order to bless the outer offerings you have to use the inner offering, which was just explained. Joining the ring finger and thumb-representing Vajrayogini and Chakrasamvara respectively-pick up the nectar and sprinkle the offerings while reciting Om kandarohi hung hung pet. As you do this you emanate the dakini Kandarohi from your heart, who chases away all the demons, ghosts, and bad spirits that are clinging to the offering substances. Without first chasing away the demons and then blessing those offerings, you cannot offer them to the merit field. Therefore, you remove those demons by reciting Om kandarohi hung hung pet. Dissolve the offerings into emptiness as you recite Om svabhava shuddha sarva dharma svabhava shuddho ham. Tongpa nyi du gyur means they dissolve into emptiness. Now there is nothing left of the ordinary substances; all of them have turned into shunyata. At this point you have to remember that when you are chasing the demons from the offering objects and dissolving them into emptiness, you should direct your attention to wherever the objects are situated."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"{:ouRrh {jo(Jd 63 Blessing the outer offerings occurs in the same four stages as blessing the inner offerings-dearing, dissolving, generating, and blessing. Up to here you have finished the first two stages-clearing and dissolving. The third stage means to newly generate the outer offerings from that state of emptiness. When doing this, you should visualize that they appear directly in front of you. The outer offerings are arranged in two rows. The row that is farthest from you, called \"offerings made to those generated in front\" (dun-kye-kyi chiipa), represents offerings that are made to the merit field. These are arranged from left to right. The other row consists of the \"offerings made to yourself generated as the deity\" (dak-kye-kyi chopa). This row, which is the one closest to you, is arranged from right to left. The offerings should be arranged this way on the altar and should be visualized in the same way when you generate them in front of you. Tongpey ngang le Kam means Kam syllables arise from that state of emptiness. When you recite this, visualize that two rows of Kam syllables, eight in each row, appear in front of you. These Kam syllables then tum into skullcups. The reason we visualize Kam syllables is that the Ka in that syllable is the initial letter of the Sanskrit word for skullcup (kapala ). The circle above the letter Ka forms the syllable Kam. That circle represents the emptiness that is the skullcup's ultimate nature. Ka refers to the relative truth nature of the skullcup; it means they are objects that are merely ascribed by names and conceptual knowledge. This explanation is the same as the one I gave above for the Yam syllable. Topey no nam-kyi nang du means Hung syllables suddenly appear inside those skull cups. These Hung syllables represent the essence of all the Buddhas' minds. Hung le cho dze nam means these Hung syllables turn into the individual offerings inside those skullcups. Rang shin tong nyi means their nature is emptiness. Nampa cho dze so so nampa chen means their form is that of each individual offering.

The musical instrument also has to be visualized inside a skullcup. The function of these offerings is to produce the combination of bliss-wisdom in the minds of the merit field as they experience these substances with their six sense powers. Je le means function; wangpo druk means six sense puwers. Since each member of the merit field has six sense powers, offering these to the merit field produces inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom in their minds. Cho yul du means as objects of the sense powers. As beginning practitioners, when we see shapes, colors, or experience smells or other objects, we cannot immediately recognize these as objects of our combination of bliss-wisdom. So we automatically perceive these things as ordinary; that is, ordinary flowers, ordinary incense, and so forth. But after generating them as special objects with this ritual, they can produce extraordinary untainted wisdom-wisdom that is free of all mental afflictions-in the minds of the beings of the merit field. This wisdom is referred to here in the Dak-kye as sakpa mepey dewa kyepar chen. When these offerings are experienced by the merit field's sense powers, great bliss is produced in their minds. Terwar gyur means the offerings produce such bliss. After reciting these words and doing the visualizations, you have to recite the name of each offering, which is enclosed by the syllables Om, Ah, and Hung. \"Om Ah Hung\" is the essence mantra of the body, speech, and mind of all the Buddhas.

You have to make the corresponding gestures or mudras while reciting each of these mantras. These mudras should be performed discreetly without exaggerated movement of the hands. At Gyii-me Tantric College we had to make the gestures close in with the hands not extending beyond the width of the body. Also, by the time you recite Ah Hung in the mantra, the mudra for each offering has to be completed. Om argham Ah Hung. This first water offering is for drinking. Om padyam Ah Hung. The second water offering is for washing. In India, when very important guests were invited to your house, you had to serve them water for washing their feet. After that the guests could enter the house. Padyam refers to that water for cleaning the feet and hands. Vajra piipe means flowers, which are offered as a flower garland to be worn on the head, or something similar. Vajra dhupe is incense that is like a powder, which is sprinkled over the fire, or incense sticks that are put in a holder. Vajra dipe means light. Vajra gandhe means fragrant saffron water that is put on the body. Vajra naividye means food. As you do these mudras, you hold the vajra and bell in your hands. When reciting the mantra for the music offering, Om vajra shapta Ah Hung, you pick up the damaru and play it along with the bell. The bell should be held in front of your heart signifying that the sound of the bell urges you to develop inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom (detong nyi su mepey yeshe). The damaru is played at the level of the navel to awaken the tum-mo that produces great ecstasy and the realization of emptiness.

On a moon cushion at Vajraheruka's heart sits a Hung syllable surrounded by the Hundred-Syllable Mantra garland. A stream of white nectar flows from the mantra, removing all my sicknesses, demons, bad deeds, and obstacles.

As I said earlier, taking the three bodies as the path (ku sum lam kyer) is the main practice of the generation stage. But in order to do this practice, first our mind must be very clean and transformed into a perfectly clear field where the three kayas can grow without difficulty. Therefore, we have to clear away all the obstacles, bad"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"fcxmrh !)ago. 67 deeds, and mental obscurations. One of the best ways to prepare this field of our mind is by doing the practice of Vajrasattva meditation (dorje sempey gom de). Once we have cleaned our mind, we have to cover it with good fertilizer, which is our virtue. The most effective way of doing this is by practicing guru yoga (Iamey neljor), which follows the Vajrasattva meditation in the Dak-kye ritual. Having prepared our mind by doing these two practices, we can then begin to practice taking the three bodies as the path. Rang-gi chi wor means above the crown of my head. Pendey den Ia means on lotus and moon cushions. In our lineage you have to visualize the lotus cushion as having one hundred thousand petals instead of four or eight as described in other systems. The text that describes the practice is brief. On top of that moon cushion in the center sits Dorje Sempa, or Vajrasattva, who in this case is referred to as Vajraheruka. The mantra also is called the \"Hundred-Syllable Vajraheruka mantra.\" Actually, Vajraheruka and Vajrasattva are one and the same. Yab means male deity; yum means female deity. Kundok karpo means their bodies are white in color. Shel chik chak nyi-kyi means with one face and two hands. Dor dril dang dri to dzinpey means that the male deity Vajraheruka, holds a vajra and bell and his consort holds a chopknife and a skullcup full of nectar. Pen tsun kyu pa means they are embracing one another. Yab chakgya druk means that the male deity Va jraheruka, is adorned with six mudra ornaments. 8 Yum chakgya nge gyen means his consort is adorned with the five mudra ornaments. Dorje dang pe-mey kyil trung-gi shukpey means that Vajraheruka is sitting in the \"vajra\" position and his consort is sitting in the \"lotus\" position. Tuk-kar means in his heart; dawey teng du hung means in the center of the moon cushion stands a white Hung syllable. Hung-gi tar ngak treng-gi korwa means the Hundred-Syllable Mantra surrounds the Hung syllable. Diitsi karpo gyun bab-pey means not just one or two drops, but a continuous stream of white nectar flows down from the mantra 8See pp. 163-164 of the Sixth Yoga for a description of the first five ornaments. The sixth ornament consists of ashes from human bones smeared on the body."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"68 Sool1mc P.,.ch m kn:fw«l ~ISC syllables. Ne. means sickness; don means inner and outer demons; dik means all bad deeds; and drip means obstacles, or the seeds of all your bad deeds. After deeds are done their seeds or propensities still remain with you. This is the meaning of \"obstacles\" here. Ne don dik drip tamche jangpar gyur means all sicknesses, bad spirits, bad deeds, and obstacles are removed. The nectar washes all of these away. In brief, the visualization is this: Vajraheruka and consort are sitting on top of your head. A stream of nectar flows down from the Hung and mantra chain in his heart. This nectar flows out from the place where their bodies are joined and passes directly through the moon and lotus cushions upon which they are sitting. It then enters your body through the top of your head and washes away all of your sicknesses, as well as the inner and outer demons' influences of bad deeds and their seeds. All of these bad qualities are washed away leaving you completely clean. An ordinary person cannot do this practice efficiently or nicely. But you are in Vajrayogini's form. At this time you should maintain the clear appearance (sel-nang) in your mind of yourself in Vajrayogini's form. However, for the time being you have to release the divine pride in which you think \"I am actually the result time's Vajrayogini.\" At this point you have to think, \"I am a very sick person, I have a lot of demons in my mind, I have a lot of bad deeds, I have a lot of obstacles, and I want to get rid of them.\" An example of the cleaning process is like this. If you were to wash a kettle or pot inside and out, it would become clean, but still you would not be able to see through it. This way of washing is like the practices done by an ordinary person. However, when you practice Vajraheruka meditation while visualizing yourself in Vajrayogini's form, it is like washing a glass jar; if you clean it both inside and out you can see through it, from inside out and outside in. Our lineage lamas, Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche and Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche, taught us the Vajraheruka meditation in this way. You want very much to remove your sicknesses, demons, and bad deeds, but how do you do it? You have to beseech Lama Vajraheruka yab-yum, who sits above your head. You are asking him to help you when you are reciting the Hundred-Syllable Mantra. Our lineage lamas give an instruction on this point. If I ask you what you are doing, you will say, \"I am practicing Vajraheruka"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"f:OURrh YOfid 69 meditation.\" If I ask why, you will say, \"To make my mind clean.\" And if I ask, \"To clean what?\" You will respond, \"To clean away my bad deeds and obstacles.\" And if I ask you, \"Do you have a lot of bad deeds? Are you always collecting bad deeds? Do you already have a lot of them?\" At this point you might think to yourself, \"I haven't done that many bad deeds. Maybe I don't have too many. Maybe I am already clean. I haven't done any serious bad deeds. I don't have a lot of bad deeds to remove.\" That kind of thinking is wrong and is the main obstacle to the Vajraheruka practice. If you think that way, you won't feel any urgency to do this meditation because you won't feel that you have to. You will feel content and relaxed and that it's not necessary to clean your mind because you won't think you've collected that many bad deeds. You shouldn't think that way. First you have to think about how many bad deeds you have collected. You have to realize how rich you are in bad deeds. By thinking about this, the belief that you don't have many bad deeds will go away. There are three kinds of thoughts: good, bad, and neutral. There are also three kinds of deeds: good deeds, bad deeds, and neutral deeds. From the time you woke up this morning until now you've had many, many thoughts. You should ask yourself, \"How many of those thoughts were good thoughts? How many were bad thoughts? How many of those thoughts were neutral? What did these thoughts motivate me to do by body and speech? Did I rejoice about anything? Was I unhappy, angry, or upset about anything? What thoughts came to my mind this morning?\" You can answer that. A point is made in the logic texts: while you can't be sure about external objects, you can be sure about your own thoughts; you can recognize and remember them. You have already been up today for a certain number of hours. Yesterday there were twenty-four hours. Last week had seven days. Last month had many days and many hours. Last year had many months, days, and hours. All the while you have gotten a little older. What is it that you have been thinking and doing during this time? The number of thoughts is unbelievable! Among them, how many of your thoughts and deeds were good? Most of them were bad. If those are only the bad thoughts and deeds that you collected in this"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"70 Su6l,mc P.,.r h m kcchv?.t.l. {J.vMdiSC one life, think of the number of bad thoughts and bad deeds you collected in all your countless past lives! In each life we were always thinking or doing things; most of these were bad deeds. Therefore, in all of those past lives we did mostly bad deeds this way. Bad deeds come from cherishing yourself, from constantly thinking about your own purpose and your own benefit. That thought stays in your mind almost naturally. As a result you ignore the purpose and benefit of other beings. For eons and eons, from beginningless time up to now, you collected an almost countless number of bad deeds throughout all those lives. If you were to reach a high enough spiritual level, you could count them. If they had form, all of space could not contain them. Most of them were very heavy bad deeds coming from a strong motivation and strong action. Not only that, when you completed those heavy actions, you even rejoiced about them. You have also done very bad things toward holy objects. Recently in New York two kids killed their mother by shooting her. Even though for them their mother is a holy person, they killed her anyway. We too have behaved that way many, many times. We have harmed Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, Aryas, the Sangha, the Dharma, and hurt other beings as well. Those are unbelievably heavy bad deeds. If you realize this, then you will understand that you are very rich in bad deeds. Therefore, you need to clean them away. You might think, \"Even though I am so rich in bad deeds, why do I need to clean them?\" You have to use reason and logic. First of all, think, \"I cannot memorize the holy books. Those holy words won't stay in my mind. I cannot recite them from memory.\" Second, \"Not only can I not recite them, I cannot understand their meanings. Even if I receive an explanation of some subject, it is still difficult for me to understand it.\" Third, \"Even if I try to meditate, I don't achieve or gain anything. I stay at the same level all the time, like a log; my quality never changes. Why has this happened to me?\" The reason is that your bad deeds are blocking you, hurting you, obscuring you. Buddhas don't have any sicknesses; they don't have any inner demons; they don't have any bad deeds or stains of bad deeds. For that reason the activities of their body, speech, and mind are clean and unobstructed. But your body, speech, and mind are"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"[:OURrh ()o{J'o 7 I completely bound by these obstacles. That is how you should understand it using logic. Therefore, you have to realize that you definitely need to clean them. Now that you know that you need to clean them, you have to ask yourself, \"Is it possible to clean them or not?\" There are many stories that illustrate how different people did, in fact, clean them. Among bad deeds, the heaviest are the five immediate bad deeds. These are: killing your father; killing your mother; killing an Arhat; causing the Buddha to bleed; and splitting the Sangha wheel. There are also many other kinds of bad deeds. According to Hinayana doctrine, you can avert the effect of some bad deeds, but not the five immediate bad deeds. Hinayanists believe that you cannot remove the potential of bad deeds that wiii produce a result. But in the Mahayana, and especially in the Tantrayana teaching, it is possible to clear away all your bad deeds; they can be completely removed. There are two activities that you should always include in your practice: accumulating merit (tsok sak) and removing obstacles (drip jang ). You have to tum everything you do into an act of collecting virtue or removing your bad deeds. \"If I do this will they go away?\" Of course. If you can collect them, then why can't you also remove them? There is an American expression, \"You have to finish what you started.\" If you collected them, you can remove them. In this way, through logic, you can understand how you can get rid of your bad deeds. All bad deeds and obstacles are composed entities. They are impermanent. Impermanent things, whether good or bad, can be affected by causes. So if you do something to remove bad deeds, this acts as a cause. Why would this not produce the result of removing the bad deed? There is no reason it would not produce that result. All bad deeds can be removed because they are impermanent. Another instruction is this. Now, do these heavy obstacles, these bad deeds have any good qualities? Of course good deeds have good qualities. But bad deeds, do they have any good qualities? Usually bad deeds are bad. They don't have any good qualities. But they do have one special quality. They can be removed if you try. All bad deeds have that quality. But, if you don't try, they wiii stay very happily with you. This is why you have to practice Vajraheruka meditation. Its purpose is very great; it is no small practice."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72 S(JNI/lJC {}dch co kcc:hlR<.\\ {bRa.drsc What are the methods for removing bad deeds and obstacles? These are contained in Shantideva's work Compendium of Training (Lab tii). There are six methods: 1) reciting profound sutras on emptiness; 2) meditating on emptiness; 3) reciting holy mantras; 4) reciting the names of Buddhas; 5) making offerings; and 6) having holy images made. Among the six, the one used here is reciting the Hundred-Syllable Mantra in the form of a request. It also includes meditating on the emptiness of the practice. The words of the mantra are: Om vajra heruka, which means you are calling out to Lama Vajraheruka by name, 0 Vajraheruka, and requesting him to do something. Samayam anupalaya means please keep your vow. Lama Vajraheruka, don't abandon me, please take care of me. Heruka means calling him again by name for emphasis. Tvenopatita means stay close to me, Lama Vajraheruka. Dirdo me bhava means stay firmly in my mind. Sutokayo me bhava means please stay happily in my mind. Supokayo me bhava means please nourish my mind and bless me so that it develops. Anurakto me bhava means please hold my mind fast with your compassion; don't let me go. Sarva siddhim me prayatsa means please give me all the goals from the beginning of the path up to Buddhahood. Sarva karmasu tsa means please give me all the activities, the four kinds of tantric powers, which are pacifying, increasing, controlling, and destroying. Pacifying (shiwey le) means removing all obstacles from your mind and bringing your mind ultimate peace. Increasing (gyepey le) means the power to increase life span, health, and spiritual knowledge. Controlling (wang-gi le) means to gain the power to overcome bad deeds and gain mastery over the knowledges. We need both of these controlling powers. Finally, destroying (drakpo le) means the power to fight with and conquer outer and inner demons. Me tsitam means my mind. Shriyam kuru means please make my mind very glorious, very dignified, very rich in knowledge. Hung is the seed of all the Buddhas' omniscience; the five syllables Ha ha ha ha ho represent the essence of the five Buddhas. Bhagavan Vajraheruka means calling 0 Blessed One, Vajraheruka, please help me. Another version of the Hundred-Syllable Mantra says \"Bhagavan sarvatathagata,\" which means all the Buddhas, not only Lama Vajraheruka. Ma me mundza means please don't abandon me. Heruka bhava means keep"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"your Heruka nature. Maha samaya sattva ah hung pet means the being who keeps the great vow or agreement. Ah is the seed of the Buddhas' speech; it also means that all dharmas lack self-existent origination. Hung represents the wisdom that experiences great bliss. The · syllable pet is the mantra for overcoming evildoers and suffering; it brings the wisdom of inseparable bliss-voidness and also causes beings in the lower realms to be raised to the higher states. As you recite the mantra visualize that you are receiving that nectar. There are many different visualizations that can be done as part of the Vajraheruka meditation. Our lineage instruction is that you only have to do the three main ones, which are known as \"dispelling obstacles from above,\" \"dispelling them from below,\" and \"dispelling in a heap.\" Dispelling from above (yen de) means that as you receive the nectar from Vajraheruka and consort it enters through the top of your head and purifies your mind and body as it flows downward, pushing down all impurities, which are visualized in the form of sooty coal-colored liquid. This is like a herdsman who drives sheep and cows down the side of a mountain. The nectar reaches all the way to the bottom of your body and washes out all impurities through the lower doors leaving the body filled with nectar. The earth then splits open; beneath it the Lord of Death surrounded by his retinue of demons await with wide-open mouths to swallow those impurities that are in the form of sooty liquid. These demons are always watching and waiting for a chance to terminate your life. After swallowing all your impurities, they become satisfied and decide they will never harm you. Now you are free. With this the earth closes up. The second visualization is \"dispelling from below\" (men de). The nectar that flows into your body fills you from the bottom up. As it rises, it carries up the remaining bad deeds and obstacles that were not previously washed away. These are expelled through the upper doors and, as they come out, disappear into space. This is like a herdsman driving cows and sheep up the side of a mountain. The third visualization is \"dispelling in a heap\" (pung de). The stains are the most difficult to wash away. Visualize that all of them gather in a dark heap in your heart. The outer form is a black heap of darkness whose essence is your remaining bad deeds and obstacles. This time, you visualize that the nectar flows into your body and"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"7ll Su6{ ITTIC {Jc.r:h W kcc~ J}dRo.dtsc instantly removes all the bad deeds and obstacles that are gathered in a heap at your heart. Just as if you were to turn on a light in a dark room the darkness would instantly vanish, likewise, when the nectar reaches your heart these impurities instantly vanish. You have to strongly believe, \"Now I am free of all my impurities because Lama Heruka and his consort have helped me. Now I am completely clean.\" How many of your bad deeds will you remove with this practice? Will you be able to remove them totally or only partially? That depends on your practice. If you practice the four strengths intensely, you will remove them completely. If your practice of the four strengths is weak, you will reduce their power but will not eliminate them completely. What are the four strengths (nyenpo tob shi)? The two practices of taking refuge in the Three Jewels and generating bodhichitta are included in Vajrasattva meditation. These two practices together are the first strength, or the strength of the basis. You have to have very strong faith in the object of refuge and generate as much compassion and loving kindness toward all beings as you can. The stronger your faith and compassion, the stronger your power to remove obstacles and bad deeds. The second strength is regret. Even though you have practiced very hard for a long time you may not have achieved any result. This is because of the obstacles you have collected in the past. Recognizing this, you should think, \"I have done many bad deeds over a long period of time in this and previous lives. I really regret having done them. But now I have a very good opportunity to remove these obstacles.\" This kind of regret is the second strength that helps to dig them up by the roots. Although this strength uproots your bad deeds, it does not remove them. The third strength is the strength of the antidote. This strength is what actually dears away or removes those bad deeds. How do you do this? By doing Vajrasattva meditation, by asking Lama Heruka yab-yum to bless you, and by receiving the flow of nectar. The fourth strength is the strength of turning away from wrongdoing. You should think, \"If I can clean away all my obstacles and bad deeds, I will never collect them again; I will never do that again.\" You should resolve never to do such deeds again."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"f:ouRr:h Uogo. 75 If you can meditate with these four strengths, Lama Heruka and consort will be very happy.

It is easier to combine two objects that are clean. A clean object cannot combine nicely with a dirty one. At this point you have become clean after having received Vajraheruka's blessing.

Guru yoga is the way to collect good causes that are powerful, efficient, and plentiful. It also enables you to collect those causes very quickly. Guru in \"guru yoga\" means lama or Dharma teacher. The Tibetan for \"yoga\" is \"neljor.\" Nel means true or accurate. ]or means to join with. Here \"neljor'' means joining your mind strongly to your lama's nature and activity. Guru yoga and Vajrasattva meditation are the two most important practices, as well as being the easiest and most efficient. These sections of the Dak-kye are very short, which is especially fitting for Americans, since you are always so busy. Because you need twenty-eight hours a day, eight days a week, it is difficult for you to practice nicely. So, for you, these practices are very useful, very holy, and very efficient. Who is the guru of guru yoga practice? Is that guru different from Buddha? If I just tell you about this in my own words, I don't think it will help you very much. Therefore, here are some quotations that appear in the commentaries that might strengthen your belief. Otherwise you might think, \"Oh, what is he saying? He's demanding too much respect from us. Sometimes he even says he is a Buddha. I don't believe it.\" Those kinds of thoughts are bad thoughts, or tokpa ngenpa, which can come up suddenly because we have been in samsara for so long. We have those tendencies. The first quotation is from the Hevajra Tantra. The innate cannot be described by another Nor can it be found anywhere. It must be realized through one's merit And by carrying out the guru's timely instruction. The main point of this verse is the innate. \"Innate\" refers to both proximate clear light and actual clear light. The word innate in Tibetan is hlenchik kye. Hlenchik means together, and kye means arising or occurring. That which arises together is your most subtle air and mind. These have existed together since beginningless time and will continue to exist together until Buddhahood."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"This most subtle air and mind has always been with you, but you haven't been able to recognize it. To recognize and experience this \"innate\" mind is no small thing; it is the most difficult thing to achieve. You must tum your most subtle mind and its air into the combination of wisdom and bliss. That is something that only yogis and yoginis can achieve within this life. When ordinary persons die the most subtle air and mind arises, but this is not the innate wisdom. Through practice and knowledge, a yogi or yogini, while experiencing death, can recognize it as an element of practice. It is possible for a practitioner to tum death into an element of the path. For an ordinary person who has no such knowledge, death will just be another round in the cycle of samsara. This innate wisdom or clear light cannot be experienced on the basis of someone else's description. No matter where you might look for it, in the formless realm, form realm, or desire realm; in India, Europe, the East Coast or West Coast, you won't be able to find it. The practitioner who can attain it will definitely arrive at Vajradhara's state of ultimate union within this lifetime. Where can you find it? You can't find it anywhere. You can only achieve it through a lama's timely instruction. The lamas will show you when you will gain it. They will show you that you gain it when you reach the proximate clear light and again when you reach the actual clear light. With his instruction, your lama will give you the means for achieving it. This is what the lama will teach: the time you will achieve it and the method for achieving it. You also need the power of your own virtue as another supporting condition. The essence of the verse above is that you can only gain this innate wisdom through hearing instruction from your lama. Dromtonpa, the most famous Kadampa sage, and emanation of Avalokiteshvara, told his teacher Atisha, \"In Tibet we have many, many practitioners and meditators, but none of them have been able to achieve the kind of knowledge that the sages in India did.\" Atisha responded, \"All the Mahayana qualities, especially tantric knowledge, however great or small, must be gained through relying on a lama. You Tibetans see your lama as an ordinary being, so how could you possibly gain such know ledges and goals of the path!\" Here is a quotation from a work by the Panchen Lama Lobsang Chokyi Gyeltsen known as the Root Verses on tlze Mahamudra:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Sem-gyi cho nyi tongwa yang/ Tsok sak drip jang la to pel Yik gya bum tsam tung shak ni/ Gya chak gang mang ngon tang tef Dii sum sang-gye tamche dang/ Y erme tsawey lama la/ Nying ne sol deb yang yang ja/ Seeing the true nature of the mind Depends on accumulating merit and removing obscurations. Because of that, first recite the Hundred-Syllable Mantra A hundred thousand times or so, And the Confession of Downfalls hundreds of times. From the bottom of your heart, Again and again supplicate your root lama Who is inseparable from all the Buddhas of the three times. \"Mind\" here does not refer to your ordinary mind; it is your most subtle mind. Being able to realize the true nature of your most subtle mind depends on collecting merit and removing obscurations. The way to purify your mind is by doing Vajrasattva meditation, which includes reciting the Hundred-Syllable Mantra. You must recite the mantra a hundred thousand times or so and your practice must include the four strengths already mentioned. Another way to purify your mind is by reciting the Confession of Downfalls Sutra, also known as the Three Heaps Sutra. This is a ritual that includes reciting the names of thirty-five confession Buddhas while prostrating to them. These recitations and the act of making prostrations are an important element of preliminary practices. When the verse says to do these first, it means that they are preliminary practices. Your root lama's essence is inseparable from the Buddhas of the three times. He is their emanation. From the bottom of your heart, you have to supplicate your lama not just once but many times. In fact, the Hundred-Syllable Mantra of the Vajrasattva meditation represents such a supplication. Seeing the true nature of your mind here refers to your most subtle air and mind that exists innately in you. You have to realize"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the true nature of this most subtle mind as a means of becoming a Buddha, as a means of achieving Buddhahood. Before you can do this you have to strive with great effort to collect virtue and remove your bad deeds. This is done in relation to a particular object or field; the supreme field is your root lama. From the practitioner's side you have to see your lama as a real Buddha. If you do this, you will have great aspiration to practice the preliminaries in order to achieve the ultimate goals. You must practice these intensely and for a long time. This is instruction that Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche gave in relation to these lines. Whose kindness has helped you more? The Buddhas' or your lama's? When you contemplate the instructions on this topic you will recognize how the root lama shows you greater kindness than all the Buddhas. In this way you will understand how the root lama is the supreme field for accumulating merit and removing obscurations. When I was a young monk in the monastery we studied very hard and thought very hard; we read and memorized many books and learned many things from our teachers and debated these subjects day and night on the debate ground. We also practiced a lot and worked very hard to attain Buddhahood. Sometimes the thought would occur to me, \"After I achieve Buddhahood, I won't have any more work to do. So what do Buddhas do, nothing? Where do they go?\" That is how I thought. Those kinds of thoughts can be blessings from the lama. Just by thinking like that you will start trying to find the correct view. That way you get closer and closer to it. The Buddhas worked very hard for many, many kalpas to abandon the obstacles and achieve all the knowledges. Finally, they achieved Buddhahood. From the time they generated bodhichitta and took the Bodhisattva vows, they promised to work only for the benefit of all sentient beings. Then I asked myself, \"After working so hard for so many kalpas in order to achieve Buddhahood, and having achieved Buddhahood, then what do they do? Where do they go? Where are they now?\" It occurred to me that these two-their motivation of wanting to benefit all beings and the thought that they would no longer have to do anything upon attaining enlightenment-didn't fit together in my mind. According to the lineage lamas' instructions, the· Buddhas' only purpose is to be of benefit to beings. Naturally, we too are among"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"those sentient beings and therefore they are seeking to benefit us as well. They have all the knowledges and are free of all obstacles. The difficulty comes from our side; if they were to appear in front of us in a Buddha's form, we wouldn't be able to see them or receive instructions from them because our level is too low. Since their level is so high their efforts wouldn't work. The fault is from our side only. However, if they were to emanate at a lower level than our own, we wouldn't believe them. We would think we were superior to them. If we don't believe them, of course we won't accept their instruction. Therefore, the only way they can benefit us is by emanating in a form that is similar to ours; that is, as a human being. If they appear as a human being we can see them and receive teachings from them. That way we can see and hear them. That is the best way the Buddhas can help us-by teaching us the Dharma. Through such reasoning we can understand that the root and lineage lamas are emanations of the Buddha. Because of our level, the best way for the Buddhas to benefit us is in the form of our root lama. Therefore, our root and lineage lamas are real Buddhas. And if they are an emanation of one Buddha, they are an emanation of all the Buddhas. The wisdom and virtuous qualities of the Buddhas are the same. Buddha found that the best way to teach us is by appearing like us, as human beings, who show themselves as having spiritual qualities that are a little bit better than ours. The teachings and instructions they give us are a little bit higher than the way we usually think. Through practicing we can further improve our understanding. When Buddha appears at our level, he is appearing in a nirmanakaya form. Buddha Shakyamuni appeared in Bodhgaya twenty-five hundred years ago. That form was a nirmanakaya that appeared as a human being for a short time--eighty years-then disappeared. The Buddhas have emanated many, many forms. That is why there are so many images in the merit field as you may have seen in tangkas. When you see these you might think, \"There are many different images there. Why does the Buddha need so many emanations?\" If you were to gain real knowledge you would realize that even that many emanations is far too few since there are so many different levels of beings, so many different wishes and abilities. Because Buddhas help beings according to their own level,"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"86 5H6l1Tne J)dc:h w k.ccfw«>. ~diSC they have to emanate forms that are appropriate to each one. Therefore, when you are visualizing the merit field and think you cannot visualize so many figures, actually, all the figures you could possibly visualize would still be far too few. VISUALIZING THE ASSEMBLAGE OF LAMAS Now you have to visualize the assemblage of lamas. The words of the Dak-kye that describe this visualization begin with Dun-gyi namkar, which means in the space in front of you. Oak sel nyi su mepey yeshe refers to the wisdom that is the combination of great ecstasy and emptiness. This is the highest wisdom, the unique tantric form of generating bodhichitta. Oak sel describes this wisdom as being pure and bright, which are the qualities of the proximate and actual clear lights. Pei wosel and don-gyi wosel are all real dak sel, or pure, bright wisdom. Nyi su mepey means this wisdom combines the two-the combination of great ecstasy and wisdom. In the space in front of you, visualize a divine palace with all the lamas seated inside. Rang nang le drupey means that this palace is not an ordinary one built by architects. It is formed out of that unique wisdom itself appearing as a palace. Shel ye kang means an exquisite pal:lce. Dru shi means that the palace is square; go shi means it has four doors. Gyen means it is adorned with beautiful ornaments. Ta bab dang chepa means that there is a very beautiful portico in front of each door. Tsen nyi tamche yong su dzok pey means that this palace is complete with all structural and ornamental features. D-su means at the center, inside the palace is a throne. Seng-ge chenpo gye-kyi tekpey means the throne is held up by eight great lions. Rinpochey tri means a holy jewel-studded throne. On top of that throne is natsok pema, or a lotus cushion whose petals are different colors. Dawa nyi mey den-gyi means that on top of that lotus are a moon and sun cushion. Teng du means on top of the lotus, moon, and sun. Drinchen tsawey lama means the kind root lama. De nyi Sang-gye Dorje Cho-kyi nampa chen means that very root lama, who is appearing in the form of Buddha Vajradharma. What does he look like? Kundok marpo means the color of his body is red. Shel chik means he has one face; chak nyi-kyi means with his two hands. Dorje dang drilbu means he holds a vajra and bell;"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"f:1fXh ()o{}d 8 7 tuk-kar nol ne dzinpa means II? is holding them with his arms crossed in front of his heart. U-tra relpey cho pen chen means his hair is tied up in a crown like top knot. Shab dorjey kyilmo trung-gi shukpa means he sits with legs crossed in the vajra position. Shonu means a youth. Langtso means health. Chu druk lon pey natso chen means he appears as a youth who has reached the age of sixteen. Dar dang riipa dang means he is clothed in silk garments and adorned with bone ornaments. Rinpochey gyen tamche-kyi gyenpa means he is also adorned with all the holy jewel ornaments. In this visualization there is one large throne in the center. The root lama is seated on his own small throne in the center of that larger one. Standing directly in front of him on another small throne similar to his own is Vajrayogini. Directly in front of her is Naropa seated on another throne. Similarly, each of the lineage lamas is sitting on his own individual throne. Each throne is complete with the lotus, sun, and moon cushions. All the lineage lamas surround the root lama counterclockwise. They are identified by name in the supplication verses that come near the end of the guru yoga section of the Dak-kye. Next to Naropa are his two Nepalese disciples, the two brothers from Pamting. Next to them is the translator Sherap Tsek. Next to him is the translator from Mel called Lodro Drakpa. Then come the five Sakya patriarchs and all the other lineage lamas down to Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche Dechen Nyingpo, who for me is the last lineage lama for my visualization. You have to add Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche Lobsang Yeshe, who was my root lama. If you take Pamtingpa to include both brothers, the Elder Jigme Drakpa and the younger Ngawang Drakpa, then you will have thirty-nine lineage lamas; if you take Pamptingpa to mean only the elder brother, then the list will total thirty-eight. Either way, this list recognizes Pabongka Rinpoche's two root lamas, Ngulchuwa Jigme Wangpo and Trehor Kangsar Kyabgon Rinpoche Lobsang Tsultrim. Because the lamas have wisdom bodies, those that are closest to you do not block the ones behind them. The Dak-kye describes this part of the visualization with the words Dey dun ne tsam te yonkor du, which means the lineage lamas are seated in a circle around the root lama, starting in front and proceeding counterclockwise. Sang-gye Dorje Chang ne tsawey Iamey bar-gyi gyiipey lama tamche means all the lineage lamas make up a group"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"1111 SuN nne {)..\\< /J co kcr:iW«\\ P.\\H£\\rlrsc that starts from Buddha Vairadhara and continues up to the last lineage lama just before the root lama .9 All of these lineage lamas are in the aspect of Hero Vajradharma except for Vajrayogini who is in her own form. As the words of the Dak-kyc indicate, Pawo Dorje Cho-kyi nampa chen means they appear in the form ~~f Hero Vajradharma. Kundok marpo means their bodies are red. Shelchik chak nyi means they have one face and two hands. The hand instruments that the lineage lamas hold are different from those of the root lama. Yepey detong-gi dra drokpey damaru trolwa means with their right hands they play a damaru whose sound ezrokes awareness of bliss-voidness wisdom. Yonpey topa diitsi gangwa tuk-kar dzinpa means in their left hands they hold nectar-filled skullcups at their hearts. Drumo yon na katvanka nampa means in the crook of the left arm they hold a katvanka. Shab dorjey kyiltrung-gi shukpa means they sit with their legs crossed in the vajra position. Riipey gyen druk-gi gyen ching means they are adorned with the six bone ornaments. Shonu langtso dar Ia bab pa means they have the appearance of a youthful adult. \"Youthful adult\" should be understood as a young man of twenty years. This age difference between the lineage lamas and the root lama represents the fact that the lineage lamas came earlier. The root lama and all the lineage lamas are marked by three syllables. Tso kor tamche-kyi trelwar Om means the main figure and the surrounding lamas are all marked at the forehead with a white Om syllable. Drinpar Ah means their throats are marked with a red Ah syllable. Tuk-kar Hung means their hearts are marked with a blue Hung syllable. The whole visualization up to this point is called \"generating the pledge beings.\" The \"pledge beings\" refer to the mental image that you visualize in front of you. The next step is to invite the wisdom beings from all the Buddha fields and dissolve them into the pledge beings. 9In the actual visualization the central figure represents both the root lama and the first lineage lama. Although the recitation refers to the first lineage lama as Sang-gye Dorje Chang (Buddha Vajradhara), you are visualizing him as Sang-gye Dorje Cho (Buddha Vajradharma). VaJradhara is blue and has only the jewel ornaments while Va1radharma is red and has both the jewel and bone ornaments. Otherwise, their ultimate nature is the same."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"{:1(Xh ljo[jd 89 Tuk-key Hung le woser tro means light rays emanate from the Hung syllables at the hearts of all the lamas who represent the pledge beings. Rang shin-gyi ne ne means these light rays invite the wisdom beings to come from their pure realms. One meaning of \"pure realms\" is that you are inviting them to come from their paradises. The other meaning is that you are inviting them to arise from the sphere of emptiness. Who are these wisdom beings? Lama yidam kyilkor-gyi hlatsok dang! Sang-gye jangsem pawo kandro/ Cho kyong sungmey tsok dang chepa means all the lamas, tantric deities with their divine assemblages, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, heroes, dakinis, and Dharma protectors. Om vajra samadza means all of them come instantly when invited and sit on top of each of the lamas in the merit field. A complete assemblage of wisdom beings then dissolves into each of them. When you recite Dza Hung Bam Ho, Dza means that the wisdom beings gather above each of the pledge beings. Hung means that each set of wisdom beings dissolves into each of those pledge beings. Bam means that they mix inseparably. Ho means that after they have merged, the merit field looks upon you happily. Re re ang kyab ne kun dii-kyi ngo wor gyur means that each of the root and lineage lamas becomes an all-inclusive object of refuge. Each of them represents a combination of all the Buddhas, tantric deities, heroes, dakinis, and Dharma protectors. Just as you visualized that many, many divine beings came and dissolved into them, now each of the lamas has become a combination of all of them. This now becomes the perfect merit field through which you can collect virtue. PROSTRATING TO THE MERIT FIELD Gang-gi drin-gyi dechen ne/ Kechik-gi ni tob gyurwal Lama rinchen tabii ku/ Dorje chen shah pe la dii/ I bow at the lotus feet of the lama, The Vajra-holder, like a wish-granting jewel, Whose kindness instantly brings The state of great bliss."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"How do you collect virtue in relation to the lamas? The first way is to make prostrations. If you do this nicely you can collect a great amount of virtue. If you are practicing in a place where there is enough room to do actual prostrations, you can do so. However, when you are in a crowded place you cannot make prostrations with your body, but you can make them with your speech by reciting these words, and with your mind by taking refuge and generating strong faith in the lamas. Gang-gi drin-gyi means by whose kindness, referring to the great kindness of the root and lineage lamas. The greatest kindness they show us is by teaching the way to attain the state of ultimate bliss. Dechen ne means the state of great bliss. This state is the ultimate great ecstasy and wisdom of Buddhahood. Kechik-gi ni tob gyurwa means that through the lamas this state can be attained in an instant. H we practice nicely we can achieve Buddhahood within this life. A human life is like an instant compared with the life span of gods or hell beings. It is also like an instant in comparison to the amount of time that we have been in samsara. Lama rinchen tabii ku means the lama's body is like a wish-granting jewel. His body is the most precious body, his speech the most precious speech, and his mind the most precious mind. Dorje chen shab pe Ia dii means I prostrate to the lotus feet of the one who holds the vajra. Dorje Chen and Dorje Chang are the same. Dorje refers to ultimate wisdom of bliss-voidness. The lama possesses that vajra. Therefore, as you recite this verse you are making prostrations to his feet. By making prostrations while keeping the meanings in your mind and reciting these holy words, you will collect an unbelievably great amount of virtue.

The Lotus-type dakini is the central Buddha Akshobhya's consort. These dakinis become the consorts for each of the lineage lamas. The root lama's consort is the Vajrayogini who is already part of the merit field. All the dakinis that you emanated from your heart turn into Vajrayogini's form.

Causing them to realize emptiness in this way is the offering of ultimate reality. How does this come about? The great ecstasy experienced in the secret offering is pure and free of obscurations.

There is a saying in the Lamrim tradition that a practitioner should make offerings that will astonish his neighbor. This means that when a neighbor sees how great your offerings are, he'll think you must be crazy for offering so much. On the other hand, if you are a yogi or yogini, you only have enough resources to continue practicing. Such practitioners have no wealth, nor are they trying to acquire any. Therefore, they aren't in a position to arrange great material offerings. What can such practitioners do? They can offer something far greater than material things. They can offer the Kusali Tsok. As yogis and yoginis, you have to think about this practice before you start to do it. You should think about it this way. If you had a big kingdom and someone were to come and request, \"Please give"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"me some laborers, I need some people to help me with my work.\" You could say without much difficulty, \"Okay, take as many as you need.\" Then someone might ask you, \"I need a good minister or secretary. Please give me one.\" Although this might be a bit more difficult, you would still do it. Then again someone else might come and request, \"Please, I need your son and daughter.\" This is even more difficult, but you might still give them away, though reluctantly. And then someone might come and request, \"Please, I need your queen; give me your queen.\" That is still more difficult. Finally, someone might request, \"Please give me your head.\" Each of these requests becomes more and more difficult because what is requested is more and more precious to you. Of course, to a king or minister, life and body are most dear. For yogis and yoginis, the value of outer things cannot compare with their body, because with it they can achieve Buddhahood, or the state of ultimate union. Therefore you should reflect, \"I have taken birth many, many times in this world; I have experienced many, many lives. Each time I wasted my body; I didn't achieve anything meaningful. But this time I will prepare my own body as an offering to the merit field. With my body I can collect a great amount of virtue because it is the most precious thing I own.\" PREPARING THE NECTAR Rang sem Kacho Wangmo tebsor tsam/ Chiwo ne ton tsawey lama dang!

For the preceding guru yoga practices up to this point-prostrating, making offerings, and doing the Seven Pure Practices-the merit field was made up only of the root and lineage lamas. In the Kusali Tsok practice, however, there are four additional groups to whom you make offerings. The first group is directly in front of the lamas. In the center is Buddha Shakyamuni surrounded by tantric deities of the four classes, Sutrayana Buddhas in the form of both the enjoyment body and emanation body, the Dharma in the form of scriptures, as well as the Sangha of Bodhisattvas, Listeners, and Solitary Realizers. To the left of that group as you face them, is Manjushri surrounded by dakas, dakinis, and Dharma protectors.

First visualize a group of seven dakinis who scoop up nectar and go to the root lama Buddha Vajradharma. Each one offers him nectar. Offering him nectar seven times symbolizes the seven unique qualities of a Buddha (kaior yenlak dun): (1) a body of ultimate enjoyment because it is a Buddha's ultimate physical form; (2) a body that is in a state of ultimate union with its own self-manifested consort; (3) a mind that is filled with innate great bliss; (4) a body whose nature lacks self-existence; (5) a mind that is filled with compassion acting spontaneously on behalf of all beings; (6) a body that exists continuously and doesn't exist only intermittently because it neither abides in samsara nor in the peace of Hinayana nirvana; and (7) a body that will not cease to exist until samsara is emptied.

Chopey kor sum means the three spheres of the offering practice, which are: the objects who receive the offering, the agent who makes the offering, and the offering itself.

That combination of bliss and voidness refers to the nature of the practitioner's own wisdom. No one can describe the way the practitioner experiences that wisdom. It is much too holy and profound. Therefore, meditate that these three aspects of the offering are inseparable from your own wisdom and, at the same time, focus on their ultimate nature, or voidness. What does it mean to say that their nature is the combination of bliss-voidness wisdom? When you achieve the actual clear light you perceive emptiness directly just as all the Buddhas do. Their wisdom penetrates so deeply into the nature of emptiness that their minds become inseparable from the object. The subject, or mental aspect of bliss-voidness wisdom, and its object, or emptiness, become like one essence. You have to study this subject and reflect on it for a long time so that your understanding is deepened. If you do this for only a short time you will not reach a deep understanding. What is the nature of inner offering? Where does it come from? It comes from its own real nature-its emptiness. It is emptiness that appears as inner offering. Therefore, the inner offering itself is an appearance of its real nature. If you meditate about this, eventually you will realize how the appearance and its real nature are inseparable. At this point you have to think that because all sentient beings have achieved Buddhahood they fly to their own paradise, or Dakpa Kacho.

The general explanations of this practice are the same as those given in the Lamrim teaching. to After the mandala offering we request blessings of the root and lineage lamas; therefore the mandala offering should be thought of as having two purposes: to collect great virtue and to make an offering to the merit field as part of your request for blessings. The mandala with which you make the offering should be made of the most valuable materials that you can afford. The best kind is made of gold, then of silver; but you can also just use a flat stone. It is usually said that the mandala should not be smaller than the cup or bowl that you use to eat or drink from. You should always have your mandala with you so that you can use it to make offerings. When monks take the Bhikshu vows they receive a statue of Buddha. This is an object that they must carry with them everywhere they go. Lord Atisha also had a holy stupa that he carried with him everywhere. Whenever he accidentally committed a misdeed, he would immediately set up his stupa, make prostrations to it, and confess. Similarly, we should carry our mandala everywhere because offering it is an excellent way of collecting virtue. As part of the Six-Session Guru Yoga practice you must make the mandala offering six times every day. It is much better to do this offering with an actual mandala than just using the hand gesture or mudra. There are various systems for the mandala offering ritual.

In Tantrayana, bliss-voidness wisdom is the agent that removes ordinary appearance, ordinary belief, and the three poisons.

Finally, pick up some grain in your right hand and hold up the mandala as a gesture of respect. The next verse describes the essence of the mandala offering, the material it is made of, the form in which it appears, and the object to whom it is offered. It also describes the three kinds of mandala: outer, inner, and secret.

The de of delong means great ecstasy; tong means emptiness and refers to both emptiness and the wisdom that realizes it. In this case it mainly refers to wisdom. Hlenchik kyepey means that the great ecstasy and wisdom are occurring in combination. Yeshe-kyi is the great wisdom that combines those two qualities. Sung nam means that this wisdom is appearing in the form of the mandala. The mandala is made of pung kam kye che le jung wey, which means it is formed from your l1eaps, your constituents, and inner bases or ayatanas. The heaps are your five skandhas, the constituents refer to the eighteen dhatus, and the bases or ayatanas are the six sense powers. The outer form of the mandala is described with the words ri ling rinchen ter bum nyindar che. Ri means Mount Meru; ling refers to the four main continents and eight subcontinents. Kinchen means the seven gems of royalty. Ter bum is the treasure 1Jessel; nyindar che means together with the sun and moon. These are the twenty-three objects contained in Je Tsongkapa's system. You offer the mandala to kyab gon tuk-jey ter, which means Lord and Savior, a treasure of compassion. These words refer to the root and lineage lamas. Ul-war gyi means I offer you this mandala. The outer mandala is represented by the external world consisting of Mount Meru and the rest. The inner mandala is created from the practitioner's own body, including the flesh, blood, sense powers, and other constituents. The practitioner visualizes these as all the elements of the mandala, including Mount Meru, the continents, the sun, the moon, and so forth. The secret mandala is to meditate that one's own great bliss-wisdom is appearing in the form of Mount Meru and the rest. The mandala offering of shunyata is to realize that all these objects arise out of their ultimate nature and thus are emptiness appearing in those forms.

The instructions of the final verse come from the Sangchen Lobshe tradition, which means \"teaching and training in the Great Secret.\" This tradition came to Tibet from India and was first transmitted to the Sakya school. When you recite the verse, visualize placing on top of Mount Meru all the objects that produce desire, hatred, and ignorance in you.

Not only is it practiced in tantra, but also in the Lamrim, where you offer it to the merit field. The two final verses should be chanted in the same style as is used for the prayer in the Dak-kye known as Ta ye gyel wa ma or \"Limitless Conquerors.\" The rhythm and melody of this chant were introduced by Takpu Dorjechang, who heard dakas and dakinis"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"singing it when he was staying at Wolka Cholung. Wolka Cholung is in southern Tibet where Je Tsongkapa stayed in retreat for many years. In Tibet I had a very good mandala but I lost it after the Chinese invasion. When we arrived in India I used a round flat stone. Later I got a very nice mandala. When I came to America I gave it to one of my students. Now you have finished all the practices for purifying yourself and collecting virtue. SUPPLICATING THE LINEAGE .lAMAS After offering the mandala, we need to ask the lamas to give us their blessing. Without requesting, we won't receive blessings. The supplication to the lineage lamas should be recited in a beautiful, melodic way. As you recite each of the lineage lama's names, focus on that lama and ask for his blessing. When you reach the supplication to the root lama, focus on the central figure, Buddha Vajradharma. Along with naming all the lamas, the verses also mention a quality unique to each one. It's like saying \"the great professor so and so.\" The main request is hletzkye yeshe tsol, or \"Please grant me innate wisdom.\" \"Innate wisdom\" refers to inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. This wisdom is associated with different levels of realization. Actual innate wisdom is first achieved in the completion stage when you reach the final part of mind isolation (sem wen). If you gain that wisdom you will definitely achieve Lama Vajrayogini's status within this life. When you recite the supplication verses you are asking the merit field to give you the main tool that you need for tantric practice. What is that? It is the innate wisdom that combines great bliss with realization of emptiness, or dechen hlenchik kyepey yeshe. This wisdom is crucial at every stage of the path from the very beginning up to the time you reach the ultimate goal. Saying, \"Please grant me innate wisdom\" implies that you don't have it yet. Why are you asking for it? Because it is so very important."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"f:1(ch Yofld Ill During the initiation, before you enter the mandala, Lama Vajrayogini emanates a helper who comes out and asks you, \"Who are you? What do you want\" (bu kyo su yin chi la ga )? Then you reply, \"I am a person of good fortune\" (kelsang dak), which means I am a Bodhisattva. \"What I want is great bliss\" (dewa chenpo lawo). Great bliss here means the innate wisdom that combines great bliss with realization of emptiness. Vajrayogini's helper continues, \"What will you do with that\" (de yi bu la chi shik ja)? And you answer, \"I will fulfill the commitment of supreme Buddhahood\" ( sang-gye chok-gi damtsik go). Damtsik, or commitment, literally means something that you cannot abandon. Here you should understand that innate wisdom cannot be abandoned if you want to achieve Buddhahood. Therefore, even here at the very beginning when you are taking the initiation you are requesting the innate wisdom that you don't yet have. Now you, as a generation stage practitioner, have reached the point in the Dak-kye where you are again requesting the lamas to grant you innate wisdom. Achieving innate wisdom is what liberates you from the bonds of samsaric existence. This is what is meant by the line in the Tsok ritual, \"Please free me quickly from the bonds of samsaric existence\"(sipey chingwa nyurdu driilwar dzo).ll Where are those bonds? They are inside the heart chakra. How are you bound? The uma or central channel is tightly bound there by the right and left nerves called the roma and kyangma. Those two nerves form a tight knot by twisting three times around the central channel. This knot around the uma in the heart chakra is what you should understand as the ''bonds of samsaric existence.\" That knot in the heart chakra is what prevents our most subtle innate mind from functioning. Even though we have this subtle mind, it is dormant. What are those bonds? The roma is the nerve located parallel and to the right of the central channel. It is called the \"hatred nerve\" because hatred and its air travel through this channel. This is one of samsara's very strong chains. The kyangma is the nerve located parallel and to the left of the central channel and is called the \"desire nerve\" because desire and its air travel through this channel. These 11 This line is from Je Tsongkapa's \"Song of Spring\" (chi lu ), which is recited during the Tsok ritual."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"are what form the knot around the uma at the heart chakra. The most subtle mind and its most subtle air, which reside within the heart chakra, always exist together and have always been with us from beginningless time up to now. All our other mental states, rough and relatively subtle, are temporary because they sometimes arise and sometimes disappear. The subtlest air and mind are with us all the time; that's why they are called innate or hlenkye. Wherever you exist the subtlest air and mind are also with you. Hlenchik kyepey yeshe, or innate wisdom, comes from this most subtle mind. This explanation is very important; you shouldn't forget it. You won't hear instruction like this very often. Don't be someone who recites, \"Please grant me innate bliss-wisdom,\" and then asks himself blankly, \"I wonder where that innate wisdom is; I wonder what it's like.\" You have to understand why the innate mind and its air cannot function even though they are with us. They cannot function because the temporary mental states and their airs are active. The most subtle mind can awaken only when the less subtle and rough mental states and their airs have ceased to function. The most subtle mind begins to function when the most subtle air moves. For beginners, practicing the Dak-kye ripens you so that later the most subtle mind can be awakened. Don't be lazy! If you are lazy about practicing the Dak-kye, you alone are making yourself silly. Outwardly, you are showing the form of a yogi or a yogini by coming to class, but your essence is that of a silly person, because you don't want to learn about or practice the main keys and know ledges of this path. Reciting the Dak-kye and trying to learn its meanings are not a punishment! You shouldn't think that after receiving the initiation and entering this path you are being punished by having to recite the Dak-kye. It's not like that. The reason you take an initiation is that you do not want to remain silly. Therefore, you have to practice the Dak-kye since it is the best way to learn the meanings, gain knowledge, and do spiritual activities. So decide that beginning right now, you will try to recite the Dak-kye regularly, and learn all its meanings. That way when you sit on your cushion you will have a better understanding of the practice. You should also try to perfect your practice by setting aside some"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"{:1{TIJ !}ogt\\ I I 3 extra time to focus on each section of the Dak-kye. That way you will get results. Another way to understand the innate wisdom you are requesting is with the part of the practice called \"taking ordinary death as the path to the dharmakaya\" (chiwa cho kii lam kyer). In the Dak-kye this begins with: Then, [your mind appearing as an immense Bam syllable] after shrinking back steadily from its outer edge into an extremely small Bam syllable, gradually dissolves from the bottom up until only the nada flame is left \" (Lar yang ta ne rim-gyi dii te shin tu trawey Bam-yik du gyurpa wok ne rim-gyi nadey bar du tim). (See pages 137-138.) For a person who is in the process of dying, this corresponds to the dissolving of the four elements and their airs. At this time, all the rough minds associated with the sense powers and outer objects stop functioning. As this occurs, the dying person experiences a series of signs: a mirage, smoke, sparkling lights, and steady candlelight. These signs are followed by the three subtle mental states known as white luminosity (nangwa karlampa), red radiance (chepa marlampa), and black near-attainment (nyertob naklampa). For a practitioner who has reached the completion stage, these experiences arise after he has completed the levels known as body isolation (iii wen) and speech isolation (ngak wen), and is about to achieve mind isolation (sem wen). The culmination of mind isolation is known as the proximate clear light (pei wosel). Both the person who is about to die and the completion stage practitioner actually experience the signs of a mirage and so on. But at the generation stage, we only imagine that we are experiencing these stages. This subject will be explained in more detail in the next section, Generating Oneself as the Deity. The states known as white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment are subtle minds. Great yogis and yoginis might meditate on white luminosity for several weeks or even months. In doing so, they meditate on the emptiness of this subtle mind, generating the combination of great ecstasy and wisdom. A yogi's meditation on the three subtle minds is known as the threefold emptiness of mind isolation (tongpa sum-gyi sem wen). As generation stage practitioners, we can only imagine that we are experiencing"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"these subtle minds. But we still meditate on the voidness of these imagined states and try to generate bliss-voidness wisdom. After these three subtle minds dissolve, there is a period of unconsciousness that precedes the awakening of the most subtle mind and its air. The ordinary dying person emerges from the last part of the black near-attainment stage like someone who regains consciousness after having fainted. He awakens into a state of complete clarity that is like a cloudless and dust-free sky not marked by any color. This is the final moment of a person's life called the \"clear light of death\" (chiwa wosel). The completion stage practitioner generates this state through meditation; for him it is called \"the proximate clear light that is the culmination of mind isolation\" (sem wen tar tuk pei wosel). At this time the yogi perceives emptiness very clearly, without being obstructed by any of the three subtle states. White luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment are known as conceptual states because the bliss-voidness wisdom that is developed when they occur does not perceive emptiness with perfect clarity. Even when you achieve the proximate clear light and perceive emptiness with great clarity, it is still not direct perception. Nevertheless, at this time yogis and yoginis do achieve real innate wisdom that combines bliss and voidness (delong hlenkye-kyi yeshe ). For an ordinary person the clear light of death only lasts a short time. By practicing the generation stage regularly, it is possible to recall innate wisdom when we are dying. This allows us to generate the clear light of death as innate wisdom instead of as ordinary death. Through achieving that clear light of wisdom we can arise in the deity's miracle body (gyulii) instead of having to experience the ordinary bardo state. The innate wisdom that you are requesting in the supplication verses is this most subtle mental state in which you perceive emptiness with great clarity while experiencing great ecstasy. After hearing this explanation you should be able to tell whether you have this wisdom or not.

This is one of three Vajrayogini teaching lineages that were practiced in Tibet. The other two systems were founded by Maitripa and lndrabhuti. Naro is short for Naropa; Kacho is short for Kachoma, or the Queen of Kacho Paradise, another name fgr Vajrayogini. Because she appeared in slightly different form to each of these three yogis, Naro Kacho identifies both how she appeared to Naropa, as well as the body of teachings she transmitted to him. Mindrollam sang ne means the crucial points of the excellent path that ripens and liberates. The ripening path is generation stage practice and the liberating path is completion stage practice. Naropa shin lekpar dompa Ia means that Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche taught those crucial points as perfectly as Naropa had originally taught them.

If someone asks you what kind of yoga practice you do, you should be able to say, \"I do generation stage practice.\" For what purpose? \"To achieve the very profound status of the Kacho Queen.\" Dzok-rim u-mey neljor means the central channel yoga of the completion stage. If someone asks you what else are you practicing, you should be able to say, \"I am practicing completion stage yoga.\" What's the difference between the generation stage and the completion stage?

Dechen hlenkye yeshe kyewa means please bless me to develop the innate wisdom of great bliss through those practices. Kacho gopang topar jin-gyi lob means please bless me to achieve the status of the Kachii Queen. Kacho again refers here to Kachiima, or Vajrayogini. One of the unique characteristics of Vajrayogini's generation stage practice is that if you have enough virtue and your practice is perfect, Vajrayogini herself will appear and take you to her paradise called Oakpa Kacho. Once she takes you there you can continue practicing to achieve all the spiritual goals. Vajrayogini's path is"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"referred to in the request from the Dak-kye: \"Supremely holy Vajrayogini, please take me and all sentient beings to Kechara Paradise. Please grant us all the worldly and transcendent spiritual attainments\" (see page 266). It's definitely possible to achieve this result; many, many yogis and yoginis have reached Dakpa Kaclzo in this way. This is one of the main goals of the Vajrayogini practice. A second goal of your practice is to achieve Vajrayogini's status within this lifetime while seated on your meditation cushion. Through perfecting the central channel yoga of the completion stage you can achieve the real innate wisdom of great bliss-first with the proximate clear light, then with the actual clear light, and finally with the ultimate inseparable bliss-wisdom of Vajrayogini's status. But, you can't practice completion stage successfully until you have mastered the generation stage. This shows how practicing generation stage is necessary for achieving both goals. REQUESTING THE FOUR INITIATIONS Now you have to receive the blessing of the four initiations. The first time you received the four initiations from Vajrayogini was on the day you entered her mandala. From that day on, you must maintain the power of the blessing and not allow it to degenerate. This is accomplished by doing the practice in the Dak-kye called \"Receiving the Blessing of the Four Initiations\" (wang slzi jitzlah ). The purpose of this practice is to restore and maintain the power of the blessing received during the initiation, as well as to make it more and more firm. The first empowerment is called the \"pitcher initiation\" (hum-pey wang) because it is received through a pitcher that contains holy nectar. During the initiation the lama touched the pitcher on your head, gave you nectar to taste, and sprinkled nectar on you. He also explained that when you experience the nectar in these ways, you have to generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The act of generating bliss-voidness wisdom during this part of the ritual is the first initiation. Although you do not generate actual bliss-voidness wisdom at this time, it is essential for you to strongly imagine that"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"you do. You have to develop that wisdom to the best of your ability and then think, \"Now I have gained real bliss-voidness wisdom.\" Suppose someone asks you, \"Have you ever received an initiation?\" You would say, \"Yes, I have.\" And if this person asks, \"Did you receive the pitcher initiation?\" you would again say, \"Yes.\" Now if you are asked to explain how you received the pitcher initiation, you might answer, \"Oh, I think he gave me some nectar a few times and put a pitcher on my head; that was the pitcher initiation.\" This shows that you don't know the real meaning of the pitcher initiation. The three other initiations are the secret initiation (sangwey wang), the wisdom initiation (sherab yeshe-kyi wang), and the word initiation (tsik-gi wang). The fourth initiation, for example, is to introduce the disciple to the ultimate goal, Vajrayogini's ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom. All of the initiations are received by generating a particular understanding of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom at various times during the initiation ritual. Many of the instructions, including this one on receiving the blessings of the four initiations, are described as having to be \"learned from the mouth\" (shel she) of the lama. To hear these instructions directly from your lama's mouth, you must please him and then request that he give you the explanations. Here I must say something ~bout how the various Buddhist teachings are related to one another and the proper attitude you should have toward them. Our main goal is to reach the state of ultimate union of Vajradhara, or Buddhahood. This goal is reached by doing the completion stage practices. In order to practice the completion stage, you must first perfect the generation stage yogas and achieve their result. But the generation stage yogas cannot be done without receiving a Highest Yoga Tantra initiation. Before you receive the blessings of a Vajrayogini initiation, you must receive a preliminary Highest Yoga Tantra initiation, the best being that of Chakrasamvara because of this deity's close relationship with Vajrayogini. It is also acceptable to receive a Guhyasamaja or Yamantaka initiation. However, in order to be qualified to receive a tantric initiation, you must first gain the knowledges of the Lamrim teachings. Even if you don't achieve all the Lamrim realizations perfectly, at least you must hear a complete set of the teachings to plant the seeds or bakchaks of"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"{:1{Xfl {Jo{}<\\ I 2 7 that knowledge in your mind. This will establish a positive condition so that you can eventually achieve the actual knowledge at some time in the future. In any case, without hearing the Lamrim teachings, you cannot receive a Highest Yoga Tantra initiation, and without that initiation, you cannot receive the blessing of a Vajrayogini initiation. Without her blessing, you cannot meditate on the Vajrayogini generation and completion stage practices, and without these practices, you cannot achieve the state of ultimate union. This is how all the Sutrayana and Tantrayana teachings are related to one another. It also shows why your knowledge of them should be complete and perfect; you should have the whole set in mind. I am a little unhappy, then, that only some of you come when teachings on the Lamrim are being given. It makes me think that some of you are becoming strange practitioners, because you are not hearing the complete set of teachings and instructions. If you come to the teachings sometimes and sometimes not, you must think that you don't need the whole set of teachings. If you want to take a bite from an apple, you need a full set of teeth. If you don't have all your teeth and you're not wearing a bridge, you cannot bite an apple nicely; you cannot get the taste. Similarly, you cannot get the proper taste of the Sutrayana and Tantrayana teachings if you lack the complete set of instructions. You should remember this point. There is an expression that says, \"Sometimes, we don't have any choice.\" But most of the time you do have a choice; you can arrange your schedule so that you do come to the teachings when they are announced. Suppose I ask you, ''What are you doing nowadays?\" You might answer, \"Nowadays I am doing the completion stage practices.\" \"Oh, that sounds very good. Tell me, what are completion stage practices?\" \"They involve the central channel and the chakras. You know, there are many chakras.\" \"Did you receive instructions on how to do those practices?\" \"Sort of.\" When you say \"sort of,\" usually it means that something is not that good."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"128 Subltmc {Ja.d1 m kcc~ ~dt5'C \"Tell me then, what are the important practices that you have to do before the completion stage practices?\" \"Well, there are many; but I don't know that much about them.\" \"I've heard that you have to finish generation stage practices before you can do the completion stage practices. What are the generation stage practices? What is their meaning and purpose?\" \"I don't know. Actually, I don't know about the generation stage practices. There are many Tibetan words in the Dak-kye that explain the practices and their purpose. But I only read the romanized version of the Oak-kye and those words aren't explained anywhere.\" If you stay like that, your practice will only get worse and worse. Don't let that happen; otherwise, you will just be wasting your life. There are some very beautiful Tibetan fables called \"Bird Stories\" (ja drung ). One goes like this: Long ago there was a hawk and a vulture who were friends. One day as they were sitting together, the vulture asked the hawk, \"Your head's a little bit flat. How did it get that way?\" \"I've received many, many initiations. That's what made my head flat.\" \"Oh, that's very good. You received so many initiations that your head got flat. But you also seem a little hard of hearing. What happened to your ears?\" \"I'm a little deaf because I didn't listen nicely during the initiations.\" Then the hawk said to the vulture, \"My friend, your eyes look a little yellow. How did they get like that?\" \"They got that way because I always eat greasy food. The grease gave me jaundice and that made my eyes turn yellow.\" \"Oh, I see. Well, what about your legs? Their skin is as rough as tree bark; how did they get that way?\" \"My legs got that way because I didn't have any grease to rub on them.\" Did you catch the meaning?

However, if the Buddhas tried to appear to us in a form that was higher than a human being, we could not see them; and if they tried to appear in a form lower than ours, we would not place our trust in them. Therefore, the Buddhas choose to appear in a form that is exactly the same as the beings they are going to help. Since the lamas teach the Dharma, they are the human forms that the Buddhas take in order to help us. Dak-gi gyii jin-gyi lab tu sol means please bless my mind. As I already explained, to be blessed by the lama means for him to use his power to instantly change your mind from an impure state to a pure one. She solwa tab-bey means because of this supplication the merit field begins to dissolve. The full visualization is not contained in the words of the Dak-kye. First, visualize that the mandala palace turns into light. This light then dissolves into all the root and lineage lamas. Takor-gyi gyiipey lama nam ii-kyi tsawey lama Ia tim means after the mandala has dissolved, the surrounding lineage lamas dissolve into the central root lama. All the lamas' thrones turn into light and dissolve into each of the lineage lamas. There are two ways that the lineage lamas can be dissolved. In one, the most recent lineage lama dissolves into his root lama; then that lama dissolves into his root lama and so on, until finally Vajrayogini dissolves into Buddha Vajradharma. In our lineage, however, we visualize that first Vajrayogini dissolves into Naropa, who dissolves into his disciple until, finally, the most recent lineage lama-who for you would be Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche-dissolves into the central root lama Buddha Vajradharma. An ordinary person cannot dissolve into another person due to having an ordinary body. But these lamas have wisdom bodies; they don't have ordinary physical forms. Therefore, they do not block each other and, because of that, they can emanate and dissolve easily. So they dissolve into the root lama. Then the root lama's throne also dissolves into the central lama. Before visualizing that Buddha Vajradharma dissolves into light, as a good omen imagine that he and you remain alone together. Imagine that Buddha Yajradharma looks upon you with such great"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"131l Soolnne {)dr:h ro kec.·lk\\Rd f]dRc.d1sc loving kindness and compassion that he is ready to dissolve into you.

Tsawey lama yang rang la je su chakpey wo marpo nampar shuwa means that because of his overwhelming affection for me, the root lama's throne first dissolves into his body; then your root lama himself also dissolves into a very clear and bright orb of red light. That light is the combination of the body, speech, and mind of all the lamas and all the Buddhas, and the essence of all their ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom. Rang-gi chi tsuk ne shuk means the red light enters through the crown of my head. Nying-gar Bam-yik marpo nampar gyur pa dang rang sem yer me du drepar gyur means the red light finally merges inseparably with my mind that appears in the form of a red Bam syllable in my heart. You should always have the awareness that you have a red Bam syllable standing on a moon cushion inside the double dharma source in your heart. The light dissolves into these. At this point you have to think, \"Now I have achieved Buddha Vajradharma's four bodies. I have achieved the four bodies of all the lamas and all the Buddhas.\" Although you might have the bad thought that you don't have a Buddha's four bodies, all of them are actually there. The red color of your Bam syllable is the enjoyment body; its ability to appear in many different forms is the emanation body; its realization of emptiness is the wisdom body; and its quality of being completely free of any self-existent phenomena is the essence body. Therefore, think, \"Now all the bliss-voidness wisdom of the Buddhas and the lamas has merged inseparably with my mind that is appearing in the form of a red Bam syllable.\" Then meditate for as long as you can on ultimate wisdom that combines great bliss with the realization of voidness."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SIXTH: YOGA OF GENERATING ONESELF AS THE DEITY"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"SIXTH: YOGA OF GENERATING ONESELF AS THE DEITY C9fHEN YOU REACH THIS POINT IN THE RITUAL all the ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom of the Buddhas and root and lineage lamas has dissolved into your mind and merged with it. Because of this, their wisdom and your mind in the form of a red Bam syllable have become one. Now you are ready to begin the sixth yoga. Another name for this yoga is the practice of \"taking the three bodies as the path\" (ku sum lam kyer). This practice has three parts: taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body, taking the intermediate state as the path to a Buddha's enjoyment body, and taking rebirth as the path to a Buddha's emanation body. The purpose of these meditations is to purify our three ordinary experiences of death, intermediate state, and rebirth, and to begin transforming them into the wisdom, enjoyment, and emanation bodies of a Buddha.

Finally, even the nada disappears, and I become the wisdom body of inseparable bliss and voidness. Om shunyata jfiana vajra svablwva atmako ham. Bam-yik de nyi je cher song te means that Bam syllable, whose essence is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom, begins to grow increasingly larger, dissolving all the objects it touches and turning them into its own nature. First it dissolves your body and turns it into inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. While its essence is wisdom, your body's outer form takes on the appearance of the expanding Bam syllable. Next, the Bam syllable dissolves the two outer dharma sources inside which you, as Vajrayogini, are standing. If you are visualizing the body mandala, there are two sets of dharma sources: one inside Vajrayogini's heart, which contains all the body mandala deities, and the other that surrounds the outer Vajrayogini. As the Bam syllable continues to expand, it dissolves the cemeteries, vajra walls, and ring of fire that make up the outer portion of Vajrayogini's mandala. Also imagine that the Bam syllable dissolves the house where you are now sitting, and that it too takes on the form of the Bam syllable. Then visualize that the town you live in, the country, and the world all tum into the Bam syllable. Finally, not only this world but all the worlds in the entire universe dissolve, leaving nothing but one incredibly huge Bam syllable whose nature is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Namkey ta dang nyampar gyur pe means the Bam syllable becomes equal in size to the limits of space.

You should also understand that now there is nothing anywhere in the universe except you, your body, and your mind, which are all contained in the form of this immense red Bam syllable.

Shin tu trawey Bam-yik du gyurpa means the syllable continues to shrink until finally it becomes an extremely small Bam syllable. Don't think of the Bam syllable as a separate object that is appearing in front of you. You are not a spectator who is watching as it grows large and then becomes small again. You yourself are the Bam syllable that expands and then becomes extremely small. You also have to know all the parts of the Bam syllable. Its \"head\" means the top part of the syllable's body. Also, arranged one on top of the other just above this body are a moon crescent or da-che, a circular drop or tik-le, and a nada or flame having three bends. Wok ne rim-gyi nadey bar du tim means the tiny Bam syllable itself now gradually dissolves from the bottom upward as far as the nada flame. First, the bottom part of the syllable dissolves into the top part. Next, the top part, or head of the syllable dissolves into the moon crescent. Then the moon crescent dissolves into the circular drop, and the circular drop dissolves into the nada. Nada yang mi mikpar detong yer me-kyi cho kur gyur means finally the nada too disappears or dissolves into the wisdom body of inseparable bliss and emptiness. The nada has three bends that dissolve from the bottom up until finally the entire Bam syllable disappears. At this point, you should reflect, \"Now I have become a Buddha's ultimate wisdom body of inseparable bliss-voidness.\" The mantra Om shunyata jiiana vajra svabhava atmako ham means \"I am that state of ultimate adamantine wisdom that realizes voidness.\" The wisdom body is the first of a Buddha's three bodies-it is the mental body of a Buddha's omniscience and ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom. \"Inseparable bliss and voidness\" means the wisdom that simultaneously perceives voidness and experiences great ecstasy. These two mental qualities are not separate states; they are contained in one mind. They are inseparable because this great ecstasy is itself the wisdom that perceives voidness directly, and this wisdom that perceives voidness directly is also great ecstasy. This section of the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Dak-kye ritual describes the meditation practice called \"taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body,\" which the first part of \"taking the three bodies as the path.\" There are many instructions about this practice that are not revealed in the words of the ritual. You must learn them directly from the mouth of your lama. This practice of generating yourself as Vajrayogini is mentioned in the following verse from the Extensive Monlam Prayer: Jang shi chiwa bardo kyewa sum/ Ku sum lam du kyerwey me jung tab/ Lam dre tokpa kyewey min je chokf Dak hlar kyepey neljor tarchin shok/ May I complete the yoga of generating myself as the deity, a wondrous system That takes the three objects to be purified-death, the bardo, and rebirth-As paths to the three bodies, and a supreme ripening path That prepares me to gain realizations of the path and its result. This verse is very useful for you. The three objects to be purified through the practice (jang shi) are ordinary death, the ordinary bardo state, and ordinary rebirth. If you want to acquire fine gold or high-grade oil, first you have to purify and refine the ore or raw material. Crude oil, for example, cannot be used right away; it must first be purified. By purifying and cleaning it thoroughly, you can make the special fuel used in jets and rockets. Therefore, the three ordinary samsaric states of death, bardo, and rebirth are similar to that crude oil. What are you trying to accomplish with your practice? You are trying to clean and purify yourself. What are the objects that must be cleaned and purified? They are your own ordinary death, ordinary bardo state, and ordinary rebirth. Where are these three states right now? Fortunately, you have not experienced them yet. However, you know that they will definitely come at some time in the future. In the past you have experienced these three states in an ordinary way. Ordinary death gave you an ordinary bardo state, and your"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Sva:h {jn[Jcl 1 ll 1 ordinary bardo state was followed by an ordinary rebirth. This is how the wheel of samsara has always turned, and it is a process you have not been able to stop before now. To stop samsara's wheel from turning, you have to purify yourself. But where do you start? You have to begin by purifying and putting an end to ordinary death. If you can purify and stop your ordinary death, it cannot possibly bring you an ordinary bardo state. If you can get rid of your ordinary bardo state, you will not experience an ordinary rebirth. This is how you can terminate the suffering of samsaric life. This is the meaning of fang shi chiwa bardo kyeu1a sum. The way to purify your future death is by not allowing it to come as ordinary death. Although death will definitely come, you have to turn it into the \"death that is a Buddha's wisdom body\" (chiwa cho ku ). This is also called the \"clear light of a Buddha's wisdom body\" (wiisel chO ku), a term that occurs in this passage from a Guhyasamaja text: Gyuma long ku wosel cho ku dang/ Natsok trul ku sum Ia re re shing/ Nampa sum sum sewa nampa gu/ The three: magical enjoyment body, wisdom body Of clear light, and manifold emanation body, Each have three forms that make up the nine-fold mixings. The name of that ultimate wisdom body is \"clear light,\" and the phrase \"clear light of death\" should be understood in the same way. \"Clear light of death\" means to prevent death from becoming ordinary by turning it into the clear light of a Buddha's wisdom body through a practice that is very similar in form to ordinary death. This practice is also the easiest and most efficient method for stopping ordinary death. In Sutrayana practice, samsaric birth and suffering are stopped by fighting against the root of samsara. You must practice in a way that is completely opposite to the way samsara operates. In the Sutrayana teachings, the root of samsara is the ignorance that holds things to be self-existent (dak-dzin ). This wrong belief holds that you, your"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"physical body, and all objects are self-existent. To fight against this ignorance you must develop a mind that has the exact opposite view. Ignorance holds you as a self-existent object; therefore, the antidote is to view yourself in the opposite way-that is, as an object that is empty of self-existence. In tantric practice your ordinary experiences are all skillfully turned into a form of the path. Instead of fighting against them, you can develop a series of minds that are very similar to them. By habituating yourself to these practices, you can apply them effectively in the future when the important ordinary experiences suddenly occur. When actual death comes, for example, you can wake up and recognize how the various stages of this process relate to your regular practice. You can remember what point in the dying process you have reached and not allow it to become an ordinary experience. It is possible to develop this level of awareness if you practice the meditations regularly and habituate yourself to them. First you must learn about the experiences of an ordinary person who is about to die. The mind has four degrees: rough, medium, subtle, and most subtle. Rough minds are those that see visible objects, hear sounds, experience tastes, and feel tangible objects. Anger, desire, and ignorance are somewhat less rough than these sense consciousnesses, so they represent medium minds. When you reach the mental states represented by the three bends of the nada flame on top of the Bam syllable, you are experiencing the subtle forms of mind. Finally, when these disappear, the most subtle mind awakens and begins to function. All these types of mind are associated with a corresponding inner air. These airs are like a horse and the related minds are like a cowboy or their rider. Without a horse, a cowboy cannot do anything. Similarly, without air the mind is like a dead body. The mind functions when air moves. If the mind moves, this means that its air has already moved as well, because the two function together. The airs that function with the mind are related to the body's four elements-earth, water, fire, and air. Each of these four inner elements also has its own specific airs; there is an air for the earth element as well as one for the water, fire, and air elements."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"When an ordinary person is about to die, the first element to lose its power is the earth element. This occurs when the earth element's air ceases to function. At this time, the dying person can no longer move his hands or any other part of the body. If someone picks up and then drops this person's arm, it will stay in whatever position it happens to fall. He cannot recognize or clearly see anyone who comes to visit. He cannot hear sounds well because his rough consciousnesses are disappearing. In the meditation practice, this is the point where you visualize that the Bam syllable's main body dissolves into the head, or top part, of the syllable. An ordinary dying person will experience the outer sign of heaviness, as though the body were a stone or a log. All physical strength and the ability to move the body are lost. In his mind he will also perceive an image of something that resembles a mirage. The person who is about to die and the yogi who has reached a certain level of the completion stage will actually experience this inner sign. As a generation stage practitioner, you can only imagine the experiences at this stage. Nevertheless, you should think, \"Now the power of my earth element has ceased; my earth element has dissolved into my water element. Now my rough minds with their airs are ceasing to function.\" In the commentaries it says that one element \"dissolves\" into another. This doesn't mean that one particular element actually merges into the essence of another; rather, it means that each element loses its power to function. Therefore, as the power of one element is exhausted, that of the next one becomes more evident. For example, when four people are standing in a room you don't notice any one of them more clearly than the others. But if one leaves, then the features of the other three become a little more evident. If one of these three persons leaves, the characteristics of the two that remain become a little more dear. And if another leaves, the features of the one remaining person become much more prominent. Similarly, the dissolution of the elements actually means that as the power of each element ceases, the characteristics of the remaining ones become more evident. The next stage is for the water element to dissolve to the fire element. The outer sign for a dying person is that his tongue and mouth feel very dry; fluids in other parts of his body also begin to"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"IIIII Sublmr {1\\rh co fu:c:lllRL\\ /JdR..\\drsc: dry up. The inner sign is that the image of smoke appears in his mind. This is similar to when there is a lot of smoke in a room and the door is opened. What you would see is a thin cloud of smoke hanging in the air. The image of smoke in this inner sign, however, is not very heavy; it is a dark blue color. Dying persons and completion stage practitoners don't have to imagine this inner sign; they actually experience it. But generation stage practitioners only imagine that they are experiencing this sign and then visualize that the head of the Bam syllable dissolves to the moon crescent. At this time, you must also reflect, \"Now I am experiencing the smoky appearance, and my water element's power is becoming exhausted.\" As practitioners, you must remember the order in which the elements dissolve. The next one is the fire element. When its power is exhausted, the outer sign for the dying person is to feel cold as his body begins to lose its heat. He also perceives the appearance of sparkling lights, like fireworks in the sky. At this stage, visualize that the moon crescent dissolves into the circular drop, or tik-le, and think, \"Now I am experiencing sparkling lights, which means that my fire element is dissolving into my air element.\" After that, the air element's power ceases to function. When this happens, all the rough minds and their airs stop functioning. The ordinary person who reaches this stage no longer feels any physical sensations and even his coarse breathing stops; but he has not actually died yet. To a dying person's mind, the inner sign of the air element dissolving is like steady candlelight. It is steady because the air element's power is exhausted and cannot cause the light to flicker. At this stage, visualize that the circular drop dissolves into the lowest third of the nada. The next three stages are the subtle states of mind, which are represented by the three bends of the nada flame. They are called white luminosity (nangwa karlampa), red radiance (cltepa marlampn), and black near-attainment (nyer tob naklampa). White luminosity refers to a dying person's perception of an appearance that is like the color of a clear fall sky covered by soft, white moonlight. This corresponds to the first of the three bends in the nada flame. As this stage ends, visualize that the lowest bend of the nada dissolves into the middle bend. At this point a dying person experiences the state called red radiance, which is like a clear sky covered by the reddish"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"S~,Xrh ()o{P 145 light at sunrise. When this stage ends, the second bend of the nada dissolves to the top part. A person at the third state, called black near-attainment, is very close to reaching the final state of the most subtle mind. This stage is divided into two parts. During the first part, the dying person experiences what resembles a sky covered in darkness. This is caused by the fact that although the subtle minds and airs have stopped functioning, the most subtle air and mind is still dormant. During the second part of black near-attainment, the dying person becomes unconscious. When this phase ends and consciousness is regained, the ordinary person awakens into a completely clear state that is like a sky free of all obstacles and obstructions. There is no moonlight, no sunlight, and no darkness. For an ordinary person this is the actual moment of death, which is known as the clear light of death. All the stages of the process that precede white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment represent rough and medium mental states. The three states of white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment are the subtle mental states. For a practitioner, these are also called the threefold emptiness (tongpa sum), because he or she has to meditate on the emptiness that is their real nature. For example, when experiencing the blackness of the state of near-attainment, the practitioner meditates on the emptiness that is the real nature of that darkness. When the completion stage practitioner actually generates these three subtle mental states, he can generate real inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Because he becomes unconscious during the last part of black near-attainment, he cannot do much at that time. But after it passes, he awakens into the most subtle state called the clear light of complete emptiness (tamche tongpa wosel). It is called complete emptiness because the three subtle states have disappeared and dissolved into the emptiness of the mind. At this time, the mind is completely clear; all the rough and subtle obstacles are gone. When you are actually dying you have to recognize that clear light as being the same as the wosel you experienced during your own meditation. Upon reaching this level, the completion stage practitioner has perfected the stage called \"mind isolation\" (sem wen) and can realize emptiness very clearly. At this point, the practitioner achieves the real innate wisdom that combines great bliss with realization of"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"I 't6 SuN mx· fl.\\lh l o kcdl::IR£\\ f JdR£\\rl1sc emptiness. However, since he is not actually perceiving voidness directly, this stage is called the proximate clear light (pei wosel ). For generation stage practice, visualize that the third and last bend of the nada disappears and you awaken into the clear light of a Buddha's wisdom body. Then meditate on the four qualities of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body. The first quality is to recognize that this state is completely empty of appearances (nangwa tong sangwa ). Because your mind is meditating on voidness, all other appearances have disappeared. Your mind is the subject and it is perceiving voidness as the object. The second quality is that this subject is perceiving its object as the absence of self-existence ( nge ngor rang shin mepa). But this subject is also not an ordinary wisdom. It is a mind that combines the realization of emptiness with the experience of great ecstasy. This experiential element is the third quality, or the experience of great ecstasy (nyong yul dewa chenpo ). Finally, the fourth quality is to identify yourself with a Buddha's wisdom body (cho kii nga-:zyel shakpa). To recognize this combination of wisdom and ecstasy as a Buddha's ultimate wisdom body (yeshe clzo ku) you maintain the divine pride that believes, \"I am this ultimate wisdom body that is the path's result-that is me; I am that.\" For a generation stage practitioner, this divine pride (hla-yi nga-gyel) is the most important element of your practice. The second most important element is the practice of generating clear appearances (sel-nang ), which I will discuss later. You must understand that this generation stage practice corresponds exactly to the process of ordinary death. By cultivating this practice, you have to develop the skill and knowledge that will not allow your own death to occur as ordinary death. You have to develop the ability to transform this ordinary process, step by step, into the clear light. You must learn to meditate on all the various stages. If your mind becomes habituated to this practice, you will be able to apply it when that important time actually comes. The clear light of death is the ordinary death that everybody experiences, or the basic clear light (shi-yi wosel). First, practitioners have to learn how to transform that into the path's clear light (lam-gyi wiisel), and then into the clear light that is the path's result (drebii wiisel). For generation stage practitioners, the path's clear light is the meditation in which you generate the divine pride that thinks, \"1"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"have now achieved the ultimate wisdom body that is the path's result.\" The clear light, which is the path's result or your ultimate goal, is a Buddha's actual wisdom body. These are the three kinds of clear light. The mantra Om shunyata jiiana vajra svabhava atmako ham contains all the meanings that make up the practice of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body. Shunyata jiiana vajra means the vajra wisdom that perceives emptiness. Atmako ham means \"I am that nature; that is me.\" When you reach this point in the recitation, you should meditate on the four qualities that I just explained. Not long after a person reaches the clear light of death, that mind and its air will begin to move. The mind and air in the state of clear light are referred to as the \"most subtle combination of mind and air\" (shin tu trawey lung sem). It is the continuum of this most subtle mind and air that goes to the intermediate state and, after that, to rebirth. Ultimately, this is the mind that takes you to Buddhahood. But if you enter one of the hells, you do so by a process that begins with this mind. This mind turns into samsara when you allow it to proceed in the ordinary manner. The aim of your practice here is to transform ordinary death into the spiritual path that leads to Vajradhara's state of ultimate union. While you can't reach this goal right away, practices such as \"taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body\" will eventually lead you there. When doing these practices, you must meditate on emptiness. Now, there are many different levels of persons. Some don't have the ability to perceive emptiness, and may not even want to. We are not permitted to teach emptiness to this kind of person. If we do, we break one of the root Bodhisattva vows. On the other hand, we must teach those who believe in emptiness and wish to learn about it, even if they don't have the ability to perceive it right away. Such persons should be taught about emptiness so that the seeds of understanding can be planted in their mind. At some point those seeds will ripen, and they will then be able to understand emptiness well and perceive it very easily. Understanding emptiness is the main key to achieving Vajradhara's state of ultimate union. A synonym for emptiness is \"the profound\"; in fact, it is a most profound object. Without the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"profound subject, or wisdom that perceives this profound object, we cannot achieve that state of ultimate union; we cannot achieve Buddhahood. Without this wisdom we cannot terminate samsara's suffering. The lack of this wisdom is what has forced us to remain in samsara for eons and eons, suffering endlessly in one life after another. Hearing about emptiness and gaining some understanding of it is like a powerful weapon that shoots holes through every part of samsara's great fortress, leaving it ready to collapse. This is why it is so important to hear and think about emptiness; it is a very great virtue and the most effective weapon for destroying the fortress of samsara. In taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body, we visualize the Bam syllable gradually dissolving from the bottom up until finally the last part, the nada flame, disappears. As I already explained, the subtle mental states of white luminosity, red radiance, and black near-attainment are represented in this part of the visualization. You have to remember how these three subtle mental states are preceded by the dissolution of the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air. As the elements dissolve, the inner signs of a mirage, smoke, sparkling lights, and steady candlelight appear, one after the other. These are followed by the white luminosity that is like a clear sky covered with white moonlight; the red radiance that is like a sunlit sky; and the black near-attainment that begins like a sky covered in darkness and ends with a period of unconsciousness. After this, your mind awakens into the clear light that is like a sky free of all white, red, and black obstructions. Now I will give you some deeper explanations. Where is a person's most subtle mind usually located? Do we have it or not? Of course we do, but we cannot recognize it because it has been asleep for a long time within the heart chakra. In the heart chakra we have what is like a small shell. Its upper half is the unique white bodhichitta received from our father at conception; the lower half is the unique red bodhichitta that we received from our mother. These two halves are joined together forming a cover around our most subtle mind. This is where our most subtle mind is sleeping. This most subtle mind is the mind's original nature, its primordial state. Until the rough minds dissolve, first to the medium and then to the subtle minds, the subtle mental states cannot function. However,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"SI)Crh Yofld II.J9 while the subtle mental states are still functioning, the most subtle mind and its air cannot move and function. The rough minds must dissolve into the medium minds, the medium minds into the subtle minds, and finally the subtle minds into the most subtle mind within the heart chakra. As mentioned earlier, the heart chakra is inside the central channel. Air doesn't usually travel inside the central channel. However, through meditation practice great sages can open their central channel, gathering all the rough, medium, and subtle airs into it, causing them to dissolve there. Then they dissolve the subtle airs and drops into the red and white shell inside the heart chakra and into the most subtle air and mind encased within that shell. After that, the most subtle mind and air will start functioning. Some time after the most subtle air and mind have awakened, the most subtle air will begin to stir. For an ordinary dying person, this is the moment when the mind leaves its place in the heart chakra and the final point of death occurs. As soon as this happens, that person enters the intermediate state or bardo. At the very beginning of a new life, an ordinary person's most subtle air and mind function for a short time. After that, they are covered by the subtle, medium, and rough minds that gradually begin to function. When the rougher minds function, the more subtle ones become still. A dying person will actually experience the dissolution of the airs and the appearance of the inner signs. As practitioners, we want to develop inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom while doing the practice of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body. But we aren't able to develop this wisdom inside the central channel because it is very difficult to gather the rough and medium winds there. Until we can do this, however, we cannot experience the real state of clear light. For now, we can only imagine these states. We have to think, \"Now I have reached this level; now the first sign has appeared; now the second sign,\" and so on. Therefore, our practice consists of forming the idea that we have achieved the various levels of meditation. Because of this, a synonym for the generation stage practice is contrived yoga (chiimey neljor). I have said that a dying person actually experiences these states.

The top half of the shell that encases the most subtle mind is white bodhichitta. The main seat of white bodhichitta in the body is at the center of the chakra inside the top of the head. First the upper airs dissolve into the opening at the top of the central channel, releasing the knot at the chakra in the crown of the head. This allows white bodhichitta to flow down through the central channel until it reaches the knots at the heart chakra. The state of white luminosity is experienced as this white bodhichitta flows down from the crown chakra. Great sages who generate white luminosity can meditate on its emptiness for up to a week. The main seat of red bodhichitta in the body is at the center of the navel chakra. After the stage of white luminosity ends, the airs in the lower part of the body dissolve into the lower opening of the central channel. This releases the knots in the lower chakras, allowing the red bodhichitta in the navel to travel up the central channel until it reaches the knots of the heart chakra. The state of red radiance is experienced when this red bodhichitta comes up the central channel. After the upper and lower subtle winds and drops gather at the heart, the knots formed there around the central channel by the right and left channels are released. This allows th.? white bodhichitta that came down the central channel and the red bodhichitta that came up the central channel both to dissolve into the shell covering your most subtle mind inside the heart chakra. This shell is also known as the indestructible drop. The dissolution of the red and white bodhichitta into the indestructible drop represents the first part of the black near-attainment stage, which is like a sky covered in darkness. The latter part of black near-attainment, a period of unconsciousness, occurs after the red and white bodhichitta have dissolved but before the most subtle mind and air have awakened. Once the subtle air and mind of black near-attainment have completely dissolved into your most subtle air and mind, you will wake up into the state of clear light. This most subtle air and mind is represented by the red Bam syllable that you visualize in your heart.

A practitioner can recognize these states during meditation and transform them into a means of generating inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The ordinary state of clear light is called the \"mother's clear light\" (ma-yi wosel). The clear light that a completion stage practitioner can develop is called the \"son's clear light\" (bu-yi wosel). When a yogi or yogini does not allow death to proceed in the ordinary way, it is called \"mixing the clear lights of mother and son\" (wosel rna bu sepa ). These are unique explanations. If you want more detail, you will have to meditate and perceive these experiences directly. The most important part of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body is to understand the four components of this practice: (1) perceiving the state as being completely empty of appearances; (2) generating the mind that realizes this state lacks self-existence; (3) experiencing this state as great ecstasy; and (4) recognizing the state as a Buddha's wisdom body that is the path's result and generating the divine pride of identifying yourself with that result. Let me ask you about the first part, the complete emptiness of appearances. Do you have the quality of emptiness? Of course you do, everyone does; not only sentient beings, but all other objects also have emptiness as their real nature. It is very important for you to have a clear idea of emptiness. Now don't think that I am crazy for what I am going to say. The house that you are sitting in is actually an emanation of emptiness. Emptiness is its real nature. An object can tum into its real nature of emptiness, or that emptiness can tum into an object, like a temple. You are also an emanation of your real nature, an emanation of your emptiness. So that you don't become confused about this point, you should also understand that all entities fall into one of two categories-permanent or impermanent. Impermanent entities are physical matter (suk), mind (shepa), and those causally produced phenomena that are neither mental nor physical in nature (den min du-je ). Physical matter or form is easy to understand. It is those things you can see and touch. Mind includes consciousness (namshe) and the secondary mental states (sem jung ). Den min du-je are a little more difficult to understand, but this is just a brief description. I won't tell you more than this here. You can learn more about this in a logic"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"class. Permanent entities include emptiness and several other things such as space. The fourth component in the practice of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body is to recognize your meditative state not as the path, but as the path's result; you have to believe, \"Now I have achieved Vajrayogini's wisdom body.\" Although you haven't actually achieved this result, it makes your practice more powerful to think this way. The Sutrayana is also known as the cause vehicle and the perfection vehicle. Nowhere in the Sutrayana is there any mention of a practice in which you are to believe that you are a Buddha and that you have achieved a Buddha's omniscience. The Tantrayana is referred to as the vajra vehicle and the result vehicle. In this tradition, you must think that you have already achieved the knowledges that are the path's result. You have to think, \"Now I have achieved the wisdom body, the enjoyment body, and the emanation body.\" This is what makes tantric practice so incredibly powerful. It is not easy to destroy the huge number of bad deeds you have collected for kalpas upon kalpas. Therefore, you need a very powerful antidote like this so that you can destroy them. TAKING THE 1 NTERMEDIATE STATE AS THE PATH TO A BUDDHA'S ENJOYMENT BoDY When you are doing the practice of taking death as the path to a Buddha's wisdom body, you are meditating on a state of emptiness that has the four characteristics just described. The only thing present in this state is your own mind, which is being perceived as a Buddha's inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. At this time you don't have a physical body; all physical form has been dissolved into this state. Now you have to develop this motivation: \"If I remain in this state for too long, I won't be able to help all sentient beings. Therefore, I must appear in a physical form that at least Mahayana Aryas will be able to perceive.\" You are absorbed in meditation on the emptiness of your most subtle mind and air. Now you have to imagine that when your most subtle air begins to stir, you arise from this state of emptiness into the form of a tiny, fine red Bam syllable with moon crescent, circular"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"SI)Crh (}ogt\\ 153 drop, and nada flame. Your most subtle air is the material cause of this syllable and your most subtle mind is its secondary cause. The combination of these two is what produces the tiny Bam syllable that is now standing in that empty space from which it arose. Its nature is Vajrayogini's divine miracle body appearing as a red Bam syllable. Then you have to strongly believe, \"This is a Buddha's enjoyment body that is the path's result.\" The actual enjoyment body is a divine body that arises from your most subtle mind and its air; therefore, you must regard the Bam syllable in the same way. You must also generate the divine pride that thinks, \"I am that Bam syllable; that Bam syllable is me.\" This is called taking the intermediate state as the path to a Buddha's enjoyment body. If you cannot turn that most subtle mind and air into a Buddha's miracle body, they will become the ordinary intermediate state. The ordinary intermediate state arises out of ordinary death. Because you didn't experience ordinary death, you can cause your most subtle mind and air to turn into a Buddha's enjoyment body. Therefore, you have appeared as the red Bam syllable instead of entering the ordinary intermediate state. This enables you to avoid taking an ordinary samsaric rebirth and to terminate all of samsara's suffering.

This is the main part of generation stage practice. While meditating, you have to think that now you have turned into Vajrayogini's emanation body and achieved the path's result. You are appearing as the complete mandala of the deity and her entire paradise. You have to think, \"I am Vajrayogini's emanation body; I have terminated all obstacles and achieved ultimate knowledge. That is me; I am that.\" You must develop this divine pride very strongly. It is described in tantric scriptures as the \"sole recollection of generation stage practice\" (kye-rim drenpa chikpa). Relating to this point, there are also two similar expressions that appear in Guhyasamaja commentaries. \"Recalling the deity single-mindedly\" (chik tu hla drenpa) means that you should visualize and remember this deity with one-pointed concentration and not allow your mind to stray to any other object. Here, deity refers to Vajrayogini's emanation body. \"Recalling the single deity\" (hla chik tu drenpa) means when you are practicing generation stage you should meditate only on the one deity; you shouldn't meditate on any other deities and mandalas. Here this means that you should visualize only the single form of Vajrayogini that is used for generation stage practice. You should remain in this meditation state as long as possible. \"As long as possible\" means for as long as you can maintain undamaged concentration. Though you may sit until your knees become sore, whatever dear meditation you developed will have long since disappeared. What are the obstacles that damage your meditation? The two main ones are mental scattering (giipa) and mental sinking (jingwa ). Scattering is when your mind cannot stay on the meditation object and follows other objects. This is one enemy. The other is mental sinking, which occurs when your mind loses strength and can no longer hold the object dearly. Your meditation will be damaged if it falls under the influence of either of these two. When you actually try to do these visualizations, you will realize how long you can maintain your meditation nicely and perfectly. What is your meditation object? It is the complete mandala described in the words of the ritual. How should you try to visualize this object? If you are sitting in a temple or a room with many other"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"people, first look around and observe everything you see. Next, try to form a single mental image of everything that you noticed. Try to make everything appear in your mind as one whole set; don't visualize different parts separately or one by one.

There are three fences-the first or outermost one is a ring of fire; the second consists of vajra walls, a roof, and a ceiling; the third is the eight cemeteries; inside them is Vajrayogini's palace that appears in the form of two intersecting dharma sources. In the center of that palace there is a sun cushion on top of an eight-petalled lotus. Lying under your feet on this sun cushion are the male god Shiva and his female counterpart. Finally, you are standing there in the form of Vajrayogini's complete emanation body. At this point you have to identify yourself with that image and have the divine pride that thinks, \"That is me; I am that.\" In the beginning of your generation stage practice, this divine pride is the most important element. It is cultivated by generating this meditation object and thinking, \"That is me; I am that.\" Later you have to cultivate the element of the practice called \"clear appearances\" (sel-nang). These two, divine pride and clear appearances, are the main elements of practice during the generation stage. Clear appearances means forming a clear image of all the objects in the mandala. You have to learn to generate the complete visualization very clearly, while at the same time maintaining your divine pride.

Dewa kyepey nyam chen means she has the appearance of one who can awaken ecstasy because her own mind is filled with the great ecstasy of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Mingo kampo ngey u-gyen dang means her head is adorned with five human skulls. These skulls are like a crown and represent the five Buddhas. You should also visualize them as being very beautiful and having jewels between them as well as on top. Kampo ngachii doshel chen means she has a garland of fifty human skulls around her neck. This garland reaches almost to her knees. The fifty skulls represent a Buddha's pure speech; the number fifty is the total of the sixteen vowels and thirty-four consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet. Chermo means she is naked. This signifies that since Vajrayogini has no obstacles and no impurities, she has no need to cover herself. Her body is pure because she has removed all her bad deeds and obstacles. Chakgya nge gyenpa means she is adorned with the five mudra ornametzts made of bone: 1) a wheel ornament on the crown of her head; 2) earrings; 3) a necklace; 4) meditation threads-one over each shoulder and under the opposite arm; and 5) armlets, bracelets, and anklets.

Vajrayogini's wisdom is so powerful and bright that she emits light rays that form a circle of fire around her. In your meditation, you have to visualize all of these qualities one by one until they appear very clearly. This should be done starting from the outermost fire fence until you finally reach Vajrayogini's body in the center. The reason for visualizing them in this order is to help ripen your mind for achieving the completion stage. Completion stage practice is done inside the central channel. Starting the visualization from the outside and working your way in toward the center helps you to gather your air into the central channel. As your visualization of the mandala improves, you refine the clear appearances aspect of the practice. You are making all the appearances in the visualization clear in your own mind. By the time you reach the part of the visualization where you are standing in the middle of a blazing wisdom fire, the image of the entire mandala should appear very clearly in your mind."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"SEVENTH: YOGA OF PURIFYING BEINGS"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"SEVENTH: YOGA OF PURIFYING BEINGS dT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED Vajrayogini's three bodies-her wisdom body, her enjoyment body, and her emanation body.

One explanation is to visualize Chakrasamvara in union with Vajrayogini on the tip of each of the light rays that emanate from your heart. As the light rays reach sentient beings, Chakrasamvara and consort land on top of each being's head. From there they bless all sentient beings and the places where they live.

Visualize that just red light rays emanate from your heart, purifying beings and their realms. At the end of the meditation you should strongly believe, \"Now I have purified all sentient beings completely. There are no longer any impure higher or lower states left anywhere in samsara. All the impure realms and impure sentient beings have been made pure.\" Then rejoice at having fulfilled your ultimate aim. At the beginning of the practice, you generated the motivation of wanting to achieve Vajradhara's state of ultimate union as soon as possible within this life. You also recited, \"I shall attain the status of a completely enlightened Buddha. After liberating all sentient beings from the ocean of samsara' s suffering, I will establish them in the bliss of complete enlightenment. For that purpose, I am going to practice all the levels of Vajrayogini's paths.\" (See page 40.) In order to do this you expressed the desire to learn about and practice Vajrayogini's paths. At this point in the practice, you must meditate that you have actually fulfilled your aims. You have achieved Buddhahood and completely fulfilled a Buddha's activities for the sake of all sentient beings. In the Sutrayana teaching Bodhisattvas have to enter the Mahayana path and accumulate a huge amount of virtue, exerting themselves with great difficulty and in many different ways for three periods that each last a \"countless\" number of great kalpas. The various levels of training on this path are referred to in the Praji\\a Paramita mantra by the words Gate gate paragate parasamgate. During the first period of \"countless\" kalpas, the Bodhisattva completes the two levels called the \"Path of Accumulation\" (tsok lam) and the \"Path of Preparation\" (jar lam). During the second period, he completes the first seven of the ten Bodhisattva levels. During the third period, he must complete the last three Bodhisattva levels before finally reaching Buddhahood. With this Vajrayogini practice you can accumulate the same amount of virtue as it takes to collect in three periods of \"countless\" kalpas when practicing the Sutrayana path. That is why these practices are so powerful, efficient, and so much easier and more holy than those in the Sutrayana path. Where is it that a person achieves Buddhahood?

It isn't proper for you to become a Buddha without any Bodhisattvas or Arhats as your disciples. You need an extremely large number of followers. The practice of purifying beings helps you arrange for such a following; it enables sentient beings to come later and fill your actual paradise. All of these various elements of the path allow you to collect great virtue. This Vajrayogini practice enables you to gather followers in the future. Therefore, the practice of purifying beings is no small meditation; it has very great meaning.

Recall the structure of the practice up to this point. First, you did the unique forms of taking refuge and generating enlightenment mind. Then you practiced Vajrasattva meditation to purify your mind by removing bad deeds and obstacles. Next, you filled the clean vessel of your mind with great virtue by practicing guru yoga. At the end of that practice, you requested blessings from the merit field of root and lineage lamas. As a result they all dissolved into the central root lama, who then dissolved into your Bam syllable. After that, you did the practice of taking the three bodies as the path in all its detail, and generated yourself in Vajrayogini's wisdom body, enjoyment body, and emanation body. All of you know something about oracles. The person who serves as an oracle is like a receptacle. When the mind of a particular deity enters his body, he makes predictions, gives advice, and offers different kinds of help.

BoDY MANDALA Before you invite the Buddhas, dakas, and dakinis to come and bless you, you have to do the body mandala practice. There are four main types of mandalas: mandalas painted on cloth, sand mandalas, mandalas produced by mental concentration, and body mandalas. The first two of these are referred to as artificial mandalas because they have to be newly made and created artificially. Artificial mandalas can also be made from other materials, such as wood or clay. The body mandala, however, is a natural mandala; it is made with objects that occur naturally and that you naturally possess. This type of mandala can only be created by yogis and yoginis and not by other persons. What are the natural materials used in a body mandala? A less subtle form of the body mandala uses different parts of the rough body; the more subtle form is created from the nerves in your body and the unique substances that flow through them. These objects don't have to be acquired anywhere; they occur naturally within you. You acquired them when your body was formed. In short, the body mandala is created from unique natural substances found in your body. A verse by Ghantapada (Drilbupa) states: The two that are artificial in nature are held To be based on the disciples' capabilities. They are not practiced by the wise because Liberation comes through seeing ultimate truth. Artificial mandalas, such as those painted on cloth or made with sand, can be arranged by disciples who can hire someone to make them. But this is not the type of mandala that scholars and sages should practice. Sages practice the body mandala that occurs"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Ctghrh (Jo{ld 175 innately, because it has special qualities that help you gain liberation by perceiving ultimate reality. Therefore, it is a much holier kind of mandala. As mentioned in the introduction, not all tantric systems have a body mandala practice; the Yamantaka tantra doesn't have it. While the Guhyasamaja system does have a body mandala practice in which thirty-two parts of the body are turned into deities, this body mandala is somewhat rough in comparison to the ones taught in the Chakrasamvara system. Our body has rough, subtle, and most subtle parts. Guhyasamaja's body mandala is formed from the rough body. In the Chakrasamvara male deity system, a body mandala is formed from the outer tips of the body's nerves. These objects are turned into many different deities. In Vajrayogini practice, however, the body mandala is generated at the inner tips or roots of the nerves located inside the central channel. This makes Vajrayogini's body mandala the most profound and most effective in helping you to develop the completion stage realizations. Both the Chakrasamvara and the Vajrayogini body mandalas are related to the same sixty-two deities, but that of Vajrayogini is easier to visualize and practice. How do we actually generate Vajrayogini's body mandala? The most crucial instructions about how to begin the practice aren't written in any of the main Vajrayogini commentaries. In addition to a commentary that contains Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche's instructions, we use several others that contain teachings given by Ngulchu Dharmabhadra, Shaluwa Risur Rinchen Lobsang Kyenrab, and Takpu Lobsang Tenpey Gyeltsen. The most important instructions about the body mandala practice, however, must be learned directly from a lama's mouth. My own root lama Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche also told me that the crucial points are not written in the commentaries. He once asked me, \"Did you see any of them there?\" and I replied, \"No, I didn't see them.\" Then he started to explain them to me. Let me explain the practice in a way that makes it easy to understand. First, you must visualize three nerves. In the middle is the uma or central nerve or channel. On its right is the roma channel, and on the left is the kyangma channel. Normally, the central channel is bound by knots at various places in the body, such as the head, throat, heart, navel, and pelvis. These knots are obstructions that"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"block the central channel. Everywhere except for the heart the knots are formed by the roma and kyangma twisting once around the central channel. The knot at the heart, however, is stronger because both the roma and kyangma coil around the central channel three times. This makes it the most difficult channel for yogis to open. The body's chakras are also located at the places where these knots occur. Because you are visualizing yourself as Vajrayogini, however, you don't have to visualize any of the knots. Simply envision the three nerves standing parallel to each other. Although they are touching, they form three separate channels. These nerves actually run from the top of the head all the way down to the pelvic region. Sometimes you have to visualize the bottom tips of these nerves in other areas of the lower body, but for the body mandala practice, visualize that they go to the very bottom of your body. After reaching the top of your head, the central channel curves down until it ends at the point between your eyebrows. The roma and kyangma nerves curve down in the same way and continue as far as the right and left nostrils. These channels are a little thicker than a stalk of wheat or slightly thinner than a regular pencil. The four main chakras in the body are the navel chakra, the heart chakra, the throat chakra, and the crown chakra. The crown chakra is called the \"chakra of great ecstasy\" (dechen-gyi korlo ), which has thirty-two spokes. These spokes are branches that extend out from the central nerve. The throat chakra has sixteen branches and is called the \"chakra of enjoyment\" (longcho-kyi kor/o ), because the things we eat and drink are enjoyed through the throat. The heart chakra, which has eight branches, is called the \"dharma chakra\" (cho-kyi korlo), because it is here that we have to gain the most important dharma of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The navel chakra has sixty-four branches that extend out from the central channel and is called the \"emanation chakra\" ( trul-pey korlo ). For the body mandala practice, it is enough that you have this brief understanding about the four main chakras. During the actual meditation, you only have to visualize two of them, the heart and navel chakras. It is dangerous to put these oral instructions down in writing. There are charlatans who haven't received any initiations or instructions about the practice or haven't received any of the lineage blessings. They just like to make empty talk and are mainly"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"interested in becoming famous and wealthy. Only those who have received the initiation and oral instruction are allowed to learn about this practice. These materials should never be shown to anyone who doesn't have the proper qualifications. Such a person will only misuse these explanations and may cause harm to the Buddha's teaching. Buddha said: This teaching of mine is so profound that it can only Be destroyed by a person who imitates me. Bombs and powerful weapons cannot destroy the holy teachings. Only people who try to act like the Buddha can destroy them. They completely destroy them mainly by mixing many wrong ideas with the genuine instruction and practice. This is why you have to be very careful.

Remember also to visualize the four bliss-whirls at the four comers of the double dharma source. Inside it, visualize only a moon cushion; there is no eight-petalled lotus cushion. On top and in the middle of this moon cushion is a pea-like shell mentioned earlier (see pages 148-149). The lower half of this shell is the red bodhichitta you received from your mother at conception, and its upper half is the white bodhichitta you received from your father.

I hear people using it all the time, but I wonder if they really know what it means. Tum-mo is a substance that is hot by nature and red in color; therefore, it is a red heat. The source of this tum-mo is the red bodhichitta in the heart that you received from your mother at conception. After your bBdy develops, red bodhichitta from the heart travels down to the navel chakra, which becomes the main seat of this substance. Because it is hot by nature, it is called tum-mo or chandali in Sanskrit, which means \"fiercely hot one.\" It is described as having the shape of an a-tung, which is the symbol for the \"a\" vowel in Sanskrit. It is also very tiny. The bottom is slightly wider and the upper part comes to a sharp point. Visualize that the tum-mo inside the navel chakra becomes much hotter. A very tiny and intensely hot flame rises from the tum-mo and travels up inside the central channel. It goes straight through the bottom of the moon cushion in your heart chakra and, after penetrating the red and white shell on top of the moon, it dissolves into the Bam syllable inside. This causes the two halves of the shell to melt and dissolve into the Bam syllable as well.

In the heart chakra and just outside the central channel are four nerve branches that extend in the four cardinal directions. These are four of the eight branches that make up the heart chakra. The nerve in the east is called sumkonna (traivritta), the one in the south doma (kamini), the one in the west kyim-ma (geha), and the one in the north tum-mo (chandika ).

The eight syllables Hung Hung, and so on, which are inseparable from the nerves and substances related to the eight doors of the mouth and the rest, turn into Kakasya (Crow Face), Ulukasya (Owl Face), Svanasya (Dog Face), Shukarasya (Pig Face), Yamadadhi (Firm Queen of the Dead), Yamaduti (Messenger Queen of the Dead), Yamadamstrani (Queen of the Dead Who Has Fangs), and Yamamathani (Destroyer Queen of the Dead). All these dakinis have the same physical form, gestures, and ornaments as the supremely holy one. Starting at the front edge of the moon cushion and proceeding counterclockwise in a circle around it are the thirty-two syllables of Vajrayogini's mantra. They are standing there upright appearing very brightly. Now visualize that each of the first four nerves in the heart chakra has a second branch angled to the right. These eight branches are the nerves of the heart chakra. Three more nerves branch out from each of these eight, making a total of twenty-four. Roughly speaking, there are six nerves located in each of the four directions. Each of the twenty-four nerves also has three branches, resulting in seventy-two nerves. These seventy-two nerves also have branches that altogether form the 72,000 nerves that extend throughout the body. All of these nerves also contain unique bodhichitta substance. For this part of the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"body mandala, however, you only have to focus on the first twenty-four nerves that branch off from the eight in the heart chakra, along with the substances that flow through them. These twenty-four nerves are arranged in eight groups of three. The first or leftmost nerve in each group is associated with Vajrayogini's mind, the middle one with her speech, and the rightmost one with her body. From left to right, then, the three nerves in each group are arranged in this order: mind nerve, speech nerve, and body nerve. Though all the nerves contain some elements of both the red and white bodhichitta, the main substance that travels through the mind nerves is air. Therefore, these nerves appear blue in color. The speech nerves mostly contain red bodhichitta, so they appear red in color. And the body nerves mostly contain white bodhichitta, making them appear white in color. The eight mind nerves, which are blue, emanate tiny segments filled mostly with air. These eight segments dissolve into the first eight syllables of Vajrayogini's mantra-Om, om,om, sar, va, bud, dha, da. These syllables are in the northeast quadrant of the moon disk. The eight speech nerves emanate segments filled with red bodhichitta that dissolve into the next eight syllables-ki, ni, ye, va, jra, var, na, ni. This group of syllables are in the northwest quadrant. The eight body nerves emanate segments filled with white bodhichitta that dissolve into the next eight syllables-ye, va, jra, vai, ro, tsa, ni, ye. These syllables are in the southwest quadrant. Of the twenty-four mantra syllables, which have now become the nature of their respective substance-filled nerves, the first group dissolves and turns into the eight dakinis of the mind circle. The second group dissolves and turns into the eight dakinis of the speech circle, and the third group dissolves and turns into the eight dakinis of the body circle. You must recognize these twenty-four dakinis to be the very same twenty-four who reside in the twenty-four holy paradises that exist here in the desire realm. How many Kechara Paradises are there? The main one is in the north on top of Mount Meru, where Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini are always sitting in their mandala paradise. When you meditate, you should sit facing west if possible; or, if not, imagine that you are. This is because many dakinis live in the western region of Udiyana;"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"so you want to be facing in their direction. There are also twenty-four holy places throughout this world, mainly in the southern continent of Jambudvipa. Whole sets of dakas and dakinis live in these special places and great numbers of followers also congregate there. It is essential to recognize that the twenty-four body, speech, and mind dakinis in your body mandala are the very same dakinis that live in these twenty-four holy paradises. You must also remind yourself that their essence is the twenty-four substance-filled nerve segments in your body, because that is the material from which these dakinis were generated. These dakinis are not distinct from their male counterparts; they are a combination of both dakas and dakinis. Sometimes they appear as dakas and sometimes as dakinis, but their nature is inseparable. In this body mandala, they only appear in the outer form of dakinis. All twenty-four of these dakinis are also red, just like the central Vajrayogini. Now you have to visualize eight more nerves. These eight are the inner tips of the nerves that extend to the body's eight sense doors: the tongue, the navel, the sex organ, the anus, the area between the eyebrows, the ears, the eyes, and the nose. The function of these nerves is to enable us to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. These nerves also emanate substance-filled segments that dissolve into the last eight syllables of Vajrayogini's mantra-hung, hung, hung, pet, pet, pet, so, ha. After that, these eight syllables, which have become the nature of their respective substance-filled nerves, dissolve and turn into the four door dakinis: Kadongma (Skt. Kakasya); Ukdongma (Skt. Ulukasya); Kyidongma (Skt. Svanasya); and Pakdongma (Skt. Shukarasya); and the four corner dakinis: Shin-je tenma (Skt. Yamadadhi); Shin-je ponyamo (Skt. Yamaduti); Shin-je chewama (Skt. Yamadamstrani); and Shin-je jom-ma. (Skt. Yamamathani). All of them have the same body form, gestures, ornaments, and hand instruments as the central deity Vajrayogini, except the four door dakinis, who have one unique feature--that is, each of them has a different face. Kadongma has the face of a crow, Ukdongma has the face of an owl, Kyidongma has the face of a dog, and Pakdongma has the face of a pig. To summarize, thirty-two dakinis stand in a ring at the outer edge of the moon cushion around four essence dakinis who in turn surround the principal deity Vajrayogini. Thus, the complete body"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"mandala contains a total of thirty-seven dakinis. However, because the twenty-four mind, speech, and body dakinis are combinations of male and female deities, this adds twenty-four male deities and increases the number to sixty-one.

Tamche kyangl Jetsun mey kii-i nampa chen gyen cha luk yong su dzokpa wo means all these dakinis have the same physical form, gestures, and ornaments as the supremely holy one, Vajrayogini. How big is the area inside the center of the heart chakra? It is only about the thickness of a stalk of wheat. Within that space you have to visualize two intersecting dharma sources. Inside them are a moon cushion with Vajrayogini at the very center. Nearby and surrounding her on four sides are the four essence dakinis. Forming a ring near the outer edge of the moon are thirty-two more dakinis. You have to visualize each of these thirty-seven dakinis as being the size of a normal human sitting comfortably in that place. If one were to look from the outside, the heart chakra would not appear to have changed; it retains its normal size. From the inside, human-size dakinis can stay there comfortably without being crowded together. To do this meditation practice effectively you have to develop a proper level of skill and ability in your mental concentration. If I look through a quarter-inch hole close to my eye, I can see a whole roomful of people. They \"fit\" there without anyone getting smaller and without the hole getting any bigger. Since this can be accomplished with ordinary objects, there is no reason why the same cannot be done with a profound form of meditation. If you watch a baseball game on television, you can see a whole stadium filled with tens of thousands of people as well as a large field with baseball players running and catching balls and hitting home runs. All of this can fit into the small area of a TV screen. Why then couldn't you achieve this same ability in your meditation practice? When you begin to achieve mental quiescence, you have to cultivate even greater power and facility in your one-pointed"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"concentration. You must develop a kind of mental agility that is similar to the physical agility that gymnasts and other athletes display. Sometimes you have to visualize that the thirty-seven dakinis in the body mandala are as large as mountains but can still fit comfortably in your heart chakra, even though it didn't grow any larger. At other times you have to imagine the heart chakra and the two dharma sources as being huge, and that the thirty-seven dakinis are arranged in a small group at the center. This type of meditation is done when you reach the subtle generation stage. The level that precedes this is known as rough generation stage. The commentaries say that if you stay in retreat and practice one-pointedly for four months, you can master the rough generation stage. This is called \"achieving firmness of practice.\" After that, you can practice concentration with the meditations of the subtle generation stage. To achieve firmness in your practice means to gain real mental quiescence. That quiescence is unbelievably holy. The person who achieves it collects an extraordinary amount of virtue. As you practice, you must remember what the mandala's three fences represent-renunciation, bodhichitta, and right view. If you can keep these three knowledges with you all the time, your tantric practice will be very good. Otherwise, you run the risk of experiencing the kind of result that a great ascetic of long ago did. He had achieved genuine mental quiescence and remained in that state for a very long time. During his meditation, his hair grew very long and lay all matted in a heap on the ground around him. Soon some mice came and made a nest in his hair. To make their nest they had to chew the hair, which lay in strands scattered around the yogi. When the ascetic came out of his meditation and saw his long hair, at first he was very pleased. But when he noticed that some of his hair had been cut by mice, he became very angry and, because of that anger, he fell into hell instead of achieving nirvana. Therefore, when you practice meditation and try to achieve mental quiescence, you should try to practice perfectly. Don't allow yourself to end up going in the wrong direction. To be successful, you must have a proper motivation and meditation object, and you must pursue a proper goal."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"MIXING THE THREE MESSENGERS BY CAUSING THE UliSDOM BEINGS TO ENTER YOUR BoDY Now we have reached the second part of the eighth yoga in which you receive the blessings of all the male and female Buddhas. This is the practice from which the eighth yoga gets its name. It is also known as mixing the three messengers by causing the wisdom beings to enter your body. The Tibetan word for wisdom beings is yeshepa. Yeshe means wisdom, but here it is not just wisdom generally; it is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Adding the syllable pa at the end forms the word yeshepa, which means a person or being who has this wisdom. \"Wisdom beings\" refers to all the Buddhas, tutelary deities, dakas, and dakinis. Causing them to enter your body means inviting them to come and dissolve into you. After dissolving into you, they become mixed with your mind. Pem/ Rang-gi tuk-key Bam-yik le woser tro pa min tsam ne ton te chok chur song wey chok chii deshin shekpa dang/ Pawo dang neljorma tamche Dorje Neljormey nampar chen drangl Dza Hung Bam Ho/ Om yoga shuddha sarva dharma yoga shuddho ham/ Cho tamche nampar dakpey neljor-gyi dak nyi de nga wo/ Pem! Light rays emanate from the Bam syllable in my heart and emerge from the point between my eyebrows. Having reached the ten directions, they invite all the ten directions' Tathagatas, heroes, and dakinis, who appear in Vajrayogini's form. Dza Hung Bam Ho. Om yoga shuddha sarva dharma yoga shuddho ham. I am the nature of the yoga in which all entities have become pure. How do the wisdom beings become mixed with your mind? By mixing together with the three messengers. A messenger is someone who does something for you; one who travels and delivers a message from you to someone else, or goes somewhere and brings back something for you. The messenger's function is to carry out a mission on your behalf. Here the term \"three messengers\" describes"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"I Hll Suol11nc {Jo.r: h m Kcdk\\1«\\ pdl«\\dlsc three classes of dakinis that are recognized in the Vajrayogini practice: outer messengers, inner messengers, and secret messengers. The outer messengers are the dakinis who bring you the Buddhas' inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom and cause it to mix together with your mind. The outer messengers are of three types: the lower outer messengers are called \"mantra-born dakinis.\" These are women practitioners who have achieved at least the generation stage practice. Because you transformed all sentient beings into Vajrayogini's form, they are also regarded as similar to these lower outer messengers. The medium outer messengers are the \"field-born dakinis\" who live in the twenty-four holy paradises here in the desire realm. The supreme outer messengers are the \"innate dakinis\" who stay in Vajrayogini's main paradise called Pure Kechara (Dakpa Kacho). These three forms of outer messengers are accompanied by all the ten directions' lamas, Buddhas, tutelary deities, Bodhisattvas, dakas, dakinis, and Dharma protectors, who are appearing in Vajrayogini's form. The inner messengers are also of three types. The lower inner messengers are the eight nerves associated with the sense doors. The medium inner messengers are the twenty-four nerves that branch out from the eight nerves in the heart chakra. The supreme inner messengers are the four main nerves in the heart chakra, together with the central channel. The outer messengers first dissolve into these inner messengers and bless them. This allows you to generate the three secret messengers. The lower secret messenger is to meditate on the innate wisdom of great bliss by imagining that you have generated it. The medium secret messenger is to develop great bliss in combination with a conceptual realization of emptiness. The supreme secret messenger is to achieve a direct realization of emptiness while experiencing innate great bliss. Generating the three secret messengers gradually, one after the other, through this meditation practice is the meaning of mixing the three messengers. In order for the outer messengers to mix with your mind, you have to invite them. This is done by making the blazing mudra or gesture and uttering the mantra of invitation, Pem! The blazing mudra is a hand gesture that resembles burning flames. It is formed by touching together the fleshy part of the two thumbs and linking"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"the two index fingers. The remaining three fingers of both hands are extended and raised upward to resemble flames. The invitation is done by recalling the nature of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom; that is, that the object, subject, and action of this mind are all void of self-existence. Then, make this hand gesture, holding your hands in the mudra down by your left knee while focusing your gaze downward. As you say the mantra Pem!, raise your hands up in front of your forehead and make nine small circles in the air, the first three turning counterclockwise, then three clockwise, and finally three more counterclockwise. This act has three elements: a mudra or hand gesture, a mantra, and a samadhi or mental concentration. Here the mental concentration is to reflect on the nature of bliss-voidness wisdom as you do the entire visualization. If your invitation includes these three qualities, the wisdom beings must come. This is the most powerful way of inviting the Buddhas, dakas, and dakinis. These beings would never break their promise of action; therefore, they will definitely appear when you invite them. Peml Rang-gi tuk-key Bam-yik le woser tro pa means that as you say the mantra Pem, visualize that light rays emanate from the tip of the nada flame on top of the Bam syllable in your heart. If you are practicing the body mandala, you must visualize yourself as the Vajrayogini in the center of the body mandala. One figure is the outer Vajrayogini; a second one is in her heart inside the body mandala. The Bam syllable that you focus on to emanate light rays is the one inside the heart of the body mandala's Vajrayogini. Min tsam ne ton te means these light rays come straight up inside the center of your body and emerge from the point between your eyebrows. Chok chur song wey means the light rays then go out to the ten directions where they reach all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Chok chii deshin shekpa dang! Pawo dang neljorma tamche means these light rays reach all the ten directions' Tathagatas, heroes, and dakinis. Tathagata is another name for a Buddha. Hero is a male tantric deity or daka; dakini is a female tantric deity. Usually all these Buddhas and deities appear in different forms when they are staying in their own paradise. Dorje Neljormey nampar chen drang means that here they all change into Vajrayogini' s form when you invite them. Then they come to you in that form from"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"all the ten directions. Now you have to visualize that many countless Vajrayoginis, each with a complete mandala, approach and converge into one Vajrayogini and mandala just above your head. When you recite the first syllable Dza in the mantra Dza Hung Bam Ho, visualize that all the Vajrayoginis come toward you and merge together to form one deity standing above your head. When you recite Hung, each part of Vajrayogini and her mandala dissolve into the same part of you and your mandala. The three fences of that Vajrayogini's mandala paradise dissolve into the three fences of your mandala; the two intersecting dharma sources of her mandala dissolve into your two dharma sources; that main Vajrayogini dissolves into your Vajrayogini emanation body; the male Shiva and consort she treads on dissolve into the Shiva and consort that you are standing on; her hand instruments and ornaments dissolve into your hand instruments and ornaments; the moon cushion in her heart dissolves into the moon cushion in your heart, and so on. Although the wisdom beings and their mandalas here dissolve into you and your mandala, at this point they have not yet completely mixed together. It is like when you first pour milk into tea; for a short time the two can be distinguished because they haven't completely mixed together. When you recite Bam, you and the wisdom beings mix together inseparably. This means they come together like water and milk being poured into the same container. Or, you can visualize that the atoms of the wisdom beings and their mandalas merge inseparably with you and your mandala's atoms. When you recite Ho, the wisdom beings become happy about staying with you. Therefore, Dza means drawing the wisdom beings to you (gugpa); Hung means causing them to dissolve into you (chukpa); Bam refers to binding you and them together inseparably (chingwa); and Ho means that they stay there happily with you (nyeja). Om yoga shuddha sarva dharma yoga shuddho ham is the mantra for this practice. Om is the essence of all Buddhas' body, speech, and mind. Yoga means meditation practice; shuddha means pure; together they mean pure meditation practice. This is a pure meditation practice relating to Vajrayogini's tantric path. The words yoga shuddha also convey the meaning of a pure activity, the activity"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"ofjoining wisdom and means. Sarva dharma means all entities; these are the objects of your meditation practice. The second yoga shuddho refers to the purity of your mind, that subject which is meditating on this practice and perceiving the emptiness of all entities. Pure here means to be purified of any self-existent essence, to be purified of perceiving ordinary appearances ( tamel-gyi nangu1a) and having ordinary belief about yourself (tamel-gyi shenpa). Ham means I am that. You have to develop the divine pride that you have this knowledge that realizes the purity of all entities and of yourself. Cho tamche nampar dakpey neljor-gyi dak nyi de nga wo expresses the meaning of the mantra: I am the nature of the yoga in which all entities have become pure. Here yoga means a meditation practice that relates to both subject and object. The objects, all entities, are pure; the subject, you and your mind, are also pure. You realize that all objects are free of any self-existent essence and your own mind is also free of any self-existent nature. They are both the nature of your inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. You have to develop the divine pride, \"I am the nature of this realization.\" There are also several explanations of the mantra's meanings that appear in commentaries. One is: \"I am the embodiment of the body, speech, and mind of all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, dakas, and dakinis who dwell in the ten directions' countless pure realms.\" Another is: \"I am the embodiment of all the heroes and heroines in whom the wisdom of great bliss has merged inseparably with the emptiness that is the ultimate nature of all entities.\" This mantra also has the same meaning as Chakrasamvara's name. Chakra means wheel; here wheel means all entities. Samvara means to bind all these entities together with inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Therefore, all entities appear to him as the objects of his ultimate wisdom. When you recite the mantra, you should make the turning-lotus gesture (pekor-gyi chakgya) three times, followed by the gesture of embrace.

CONFERRING THE INITIATION AND PLANTING THE SEAL Conferring the initiation means to invite Chakrasamvara and all the sixty-two deities of his mandala to come and give you an initiation. The meaning of an initiation is to give a blessing that bestows the power to do certain activities. When you receive an initiation you have to preserve its blessing and not allow it to degenerate or become damaged. The way to keep this blessing whole is by putting a seal on it. The sign of this seal is for the last part of the holy nectar from the initiation that remains on your head to become transformed into Vairochana Heruka and his consort.

The offerings you make to yourself are called \"the offerings presented to you when you generate yourself in the deity's form\" (dak-kye-kyi chopa). The offerings made earlier to the merit field of root and lineage lamas are called \"offerings to beings who are generated in front of you\" (dun-kye-kyi chopa). When you arrange offerings on the altar, there are usually two rows. The row in back is the offerings that you make to those beings generated in front of you and the row nearest you is the offerings that you make to yourself when you have generated yourself in the deity's form. For the outer offering, there are eight objects: two water offerings, the five enjoyments, and music. The five enjoyments are flowers, incense, light, fragrance, and food. A beginning practitioner might think that it is proper to make offerings to the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, but improper to make offerings to yourself. However, this is a mistaken thought. You must remember that you have the thirty-seven dakinis in your heart and you are the combination of all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, dakas, and dakinis. Why then would it be wrong to make offerings to the combination of yourself and all these deities? You must make offerings to them, since they are the supreme object to whom offerings should be made. A second reason is described in the Guhyasamaja system, which teaches extensively about Vajradhara's state of ultimate union. A Buddha's qualities are explained according to many different classifications. For instance, there are the seven unique qualities of a Buddha's state of union (kajor yenlak dun) (see page 99). Another special group is the four purities of Buddhahood (dakpa shi): a pure field, a pure retinue, a pure body, and pure objects of enjoyment. The first quality, a pure field (shing dakpa or ne dakpa, pure region), means a Buddha's paradise is completely pure and doesn't have even the smallest bit of contamination. You practice activities to achieve this quality when you generate Vajrayogini's mandala of two"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"intersecting red dharma sources and three outer fences. By meditating on this mandala you collect the virtue that will enable you to create the place in which you can attain enlightenment. In the Sutrayana, there are special practices that are done separately for this purpose. These are said to take a hundred kalpas to complete. Here you are doing practices that bring you Buddhahood and a Buddha's paradise at the same time. The second quality is a pure retinue (kor dakpa). This means that when you reach enlightenment you need to have supreme disciples who are very pure. All the followers in your Buddha field should be Bodhisattva Aryas. Only such beings have the ability to see a Buddha's enjoyment body directly, as plainly as ordinary persons sitting in the same room can see one another. You are arranging for such a following when you practice the yoga of purifying beings. When you purify samsara's six states and the beings who live there, you are producing the causes that will allow you to have a pure following. A slightly different description of the four purities substitutes pure activities (dzepa yong su dakpa) for the quality of a pure retinue. However the meaning is similar. It is explained as referring to a Buddha's pure activities of helping sentient beings. The two main places in the ritual where we do this are during the yoga of purifying beings and during the mantra recitation. The third quality is that a Buddha has a pure body (ku dakpa ). When you practice taking the three bodies as the path, you are collecting the virtues that will bring you Vajrayogini's pure enjoyment body. In the ritual, your body is described as a perfect physical body adorned with all the ornaments. The fourth quality is that a Buddha has pure objects of enjoyment (longchO dakpa ). This means that whatever objects he may need-whether a chair, a park or garden, flowers, trees, or things to eat and drink-appear in his paradise in a completely pure form for his enjoyment. Our goal is to achieve these four characteristics ourselves. To do this we have to begin collecting virtue right now. The offerings that we make to ourselves here are a practice that will bring us pure objects of enjoyment when we achieve Vajrayogini's status in the future. In tantric Buddhism, the result of the path-Buddhahood-is practiced as the path itself (drebu lam je). The main obstacle to such a"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"200 Sub(lmc {Jdrh w kcc~WM ~dtsc practice is to have the strong belief that you are an ordinary person. The antidote for this is to cultivate divine pride and clear appearances. OVTF.R OFFERINGS First the outer offerings must be presented. In some of the more extensive rituals, the central deity emanates a duplicate of himself, who comes outside the mandala and then turns around to face it. He acts as a manager and emanates dakinis who actually present the offerings. After the offerings have been made, that duplicate of the central deity reenters the mandala and dissolves back into the main deity. Here the central Vajrayogini doesn't emanate a duplicate of herself. You simply emanate from your Bam syllable the dakinis that present the offerings to the deities in your mandala. Understanding this, you have to receive the offerings and enjoy them. The objects that are being offered have three characteristics: their essence is your inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom; their outer form is that of each separate offering; and their ability is that they can produce inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom in the minds of the beings to whom they are presented. Thus, the more you enjoy these offerings, the stronger your inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom becomes. As a practitioner, you have to enjoy these offerings and generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom while appearing in the form of Vajrayogini. She is a fully enlightened Buddha who doesn't have any defects, bad deeds, or obstacles. She has removed every kind of ignorance and confusion, and attained ultimate knowledge. Because you have achieved this status, you also don't have any bad deeds. However, at the beginning of the ritual you do the Vajrasattva meditation. This practice cleans your mind of its bad deeds, mental afflictions, obscurations, and their traces. But if you are Vajrayogini, then you don't have any of these bad qualities. This seems to be a contradiction. Why is this? The answer is that during the generation stage you have to practice the two crucial points of divine pride and clear appearances. During the Vajrasattva meditation, you have to forget about your divine pride temporarily. But you still have to do activities that are powerful and efficient. Therefore, you have to"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Erghrh Yo{}d 20 I maintain the attitude of pure appearances as clearly as possible. This means you have to keep a clear image in your mind that you are appearing in Vajrayogini's form together with the entire mandala. Then you can think about all the bad deeds you have collected from beginningless time up to now, and try to clean them by practicing Vajrasattva meditation and mantra recitation. During the generation stage, you have to make everything real, even though it isn't. The reason you have to practice everything as if it were real is because you haven't actually achieved the real result yet. This means you still have bad deeds that you have to clean. The Buddhist teachings must be learned from the very top down to the bottom. Then, no matter what part you take a bite from, you will be able to taste everything properly and you won't perceive any contradictions. But if you don't learn the whole set of teachings or you don't learn them nicely, you might become confused. Crucial points like this one have to be learned during a teaching. There is no custom of learning them at a different time. If I went to my root lama Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche privately to ask him a question about the practice, he would say to me, \"Didn't you attend the teaching on that?\" If I answered, \"Yes, I did,\" he would say, \"Then why are you asking me again? I taught you all the details about it during the teaching. Everybody heard it there. Why are you asking me again?\" If you ask your lama for a few instructions in private, you are likely to get only a few words. Not only that, you might even get a harsh scolding. This is a characteristic of our real Dharma teachers. Kyabje Rinpoche said, \"When the Dharma teacher is sitting on a throne, he will teach everything. The instructions will flow from him easily, like water. If he tries to teach after coming down from the Dharma throne, he isn't able to do so in the same way.\" There is a special quality that teachers receive when they are teaching from a Dharma throne; they will receive the blessings of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The listener should also have very strong faith. All these conditions should come together nicely. Now, a few points about the offerings themselves. If you ask some people to come and do some work for you, when the work is finished and the workers are tired, you have to invite them to sit down and offer them food and drink-whatever you have"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"arranged-and make them satisfied. Similarly, at this point you have completed the main practice of generating yourself as the deity, as well as the practice of purifying beings and receiving blessings from the heroes and heroines. Now all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have come and entered your mind. You don't need to have any doubt about this. All the Buddhas have real wisdom. Even their bodies are wisdom bodies. Therefore, unlike us, they don't have to arrange a car, a train, or an airplane to travel from one place to another. If you invite them, they will know it immediately because their minds are not blocked by any form of ignorance. They also don't have any problem coming to you nor does it take any time. They can come here or go there instantly. Because of their wisdom, they definitely have the ability to come and enter your body. That is their main job and purpose. If you look at an object in a room, such as a light hanging from the ceiling, your mind will reach there immediately. If you draw your mind back to your meditation, it will return without any difficulty. The mind's activities are unbelievable.

Therefore, you can present them right away. Rang-gi tuk-ka ne tropey cho pey hlamo nam-kyi cho par gyur means emanate offering goddesses from the Bam syllable in my heart who will present the offerings to you. Om argham pratitsa so ha is the mantra for the first water offering. This water is for you to drink. After the dakini presents the offering to you, you have to dissolve her back into your heart. This is accompanied by a hand gesture of snapping the fingers and drawing your hands toward your heart. This is repeated for all the other outer offerings. Om padyam pratitsa so ha is the mantra for offering water to wash your feet. Om vajra piipe Ah hung so ha is the mantra for offering flowers, both garlands and loose flowers. Om vajra dhupe Ah Hung so ha is the mantra for offering incense. The mudra or hand gesture for presenting this offering is to hold both your hands in front of you with the palms facing down and the four fingers of each hand extending down. This can be thought of as representing either putting powdered incense into a fire or of inserting incense sticks into an incense holder. Om vajra dipe Ah Hung so ha is the mantra for offering the light of a lamp. Om vajra gandhe Ah Hung so ha is the mantra for offering saffron water as perfume that is rubbed on the body. Om vajra naividye Ah Hung so ha is the mantra for offering food. Om vajra shapta Ah Hung so ha is the mantra for offering music; in this case for ringing the bell and playing the damaru. You have to learn how to ring the bell and play the damaru properly. Next, emanate six goddesses who present offerings to each of your six consciousnesses. This is a shorter form of an offering in which goddesses present sixteen different offerings. Here there are only six offerings. The first five are offered by the same five goddesses who presented the five sense objects to you in the last practice when you received the initiation blessing. They offer you visible form, sound, fragrance, taste, and tangible objects. Om Ah vajra adarshe Hung is the mantra for Rupavajri who offers to your eyes a mirror in which all visible forms are reflected. Adarshe means mirror in Sanskrit. Om Ah vajra vini Hung is the mantra for Shabdavajri who offers flute music to your ears. Om Ah vajra gandhe Hung is the mantra for Gandhavajri who offers saffron"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"water to your nose. Om Ah vajra rase Hung is the mantra for Rasavajri who offers food, such as fruit, to your tongue. Om Ah vajra parshe Hung is the mantra for Sparshavajri who offers clothes for your body. Om Ah vajra dharme Hung is the mantra for the sixth dakini, Dharmavajri, who offers a dharma source to your mind consciousness. A dharma source is the object that gives rise to the most holy Dharma of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Just seeing this object causes you to generate the extraordinary bliss-voidness wisdom that realizes the void nature of all dharmas. These are the outer offerings. As I mentioned already, the rules of Gyii-me Tantric College are very strict. When you make the mudras for the outer offerings, you must keep your hands close to your body, in front of your heart and within the width of your shoulders. Practitioners from other places do the mudras more exaggeratedly, but at my tantric college that is not allowed. INNER OFFERING Om om om sarva buddha dakiniye vajra varnaniye vajra vairotsaniye hung hung hung pet pet pet so hal Om Ah Hung/ This is the mantra for presenting the inner offering. The gesture is to sprinkle inner offering with the thumb and ring finger of your left hand. While doing this, visualize that many goddesses offer inner offering to all thirty-seven dakinis of your body mandala. SECRET OFFERING AND OFFERING OF ULTIMATE REALITY Vajrayogini has a katvanka resting against her left shoulder. Sometimes it remains in that form; sometimes it turns into Chakrasamvara's form. To do the secret offering, visualize that the katvanka on your left shoulder turns into Chakrasamvara. Then you, as Vajrayogini, join together with Chakrasamvara and generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The bliss that is produced in this way is the secret offering and the voidness perceived by this bliss-voidness wisdom is the offering of ultimate reality. This wisdom"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"perceives the real nature of all entities. These offerings are received by meditating on the practice. If you are a female practitioner doing the ritual alone, or if you are doing the ritual in a group and any women are present, then follow the normal order of the ritual and recite the following: Rang nyi Dorje Neljorma dang katvanka Korlo Dompar gyur pa nyom par shuk pey hlenkye-kyi detong kye par gyur/ Yab-kyi sang ne mi mikpey ngang le Hung karpo le jung wey dorje karpo tse nga pa Bya marpo le jung wey norbu marpo tse mor Bya serpo tsenpa/ Yum-gyi sang ne mi mikpey ngang le Ah le jung wey pema marpo dab rna sum pa Dya karpo le jung wey jangsem karpo tson pey te wa karpo tse mor Dya serpo tsen pal Om shri maha sukha vajra he he ru ru kam ah hung hung pet so hal Yab yum nyom par shuk pey jangsem shu wa chi wo ne drin par le-ba na gawal Drinpa ne nying-gar le-ba na chok gal Nying-ga ne te war le-ba na kye ga/ Te wa ne norbii tser le-ba na hlenkye-kyi yeshe kye pey dewa dang tongpa nyi yer mepey ting nge dzin la nyom par shuk/ De tar detong yer me du jar wa de cho pey kor sum rang shin-gyi tongpey de kona nyi-kyi don la tse chik tu nyam par shak pey sangwa dang de kona nyi • kyi cho pey nye par gyur/ As Vajrayogini, I enter into union with Chakrasamvara who appeared from my katvanka in order to generate innate bliss-voidness.

Then a red Bya syllable appears, which becomes a red jewel marked at its tip by a yellow Bya syllable. The female deity's secret organ disappears into voidness. In its place a red Ah syllable appears, which turns into a three-petalled red lotus.

This white center is marked at its tip by a yellow Dya syllable. Om shri maha sukha vajra he he ru ru kam ah hung hung pet so ha. The male and female deities enter into union, causing bodhichitta to melt from the crown of the head. When it reaches the throat, I experience joy. When it travels from the throat and reaches the heart, I experience supreme joy. When it travels from the heart and reaches the navel, I experience extraordinary joy. When it travels from the navel and reaches the tip of the jewel, I experience innate wisdom. Because of this, I become absorbed in the concentration of inseparable bliss and voidness. Through this union of bliss and voidness, I enjoy the secret offering and the offering of reality. These two offerings are identified with my one-pointed absorption in the reality represented by the lack of inherent existence that characterizes the offering's three spheres. Rang nyi Dorje Neljorma dang means I am appearing as Vajrayogini. Katvanka Korlo Dompar gyur pa means your katvanka turns into Chakrasamvara. Nyom par shuk pey hlenkye-kyi detong kye par gyur means that you and Chakrasamvara join together in sexual union, causing innate bliss-voidness wisdom to arise in your mind. This practice represents both the secret offering and the offering of ultimate reality. If you are a male practitioner doing the ritual alone or if you are doing the ritual in an all-male group, instead of reciting the first two lines of the previous section you recite the following: Rang nyi Neljormar selwey/ Noma pang pa bolar gyur/ Kakola ii yang dak ne/ Dram nyi drilbu dak tu gyur/ Sindru bola nyi du gyur/ Ga chen Heruka-yi suk/ Sang yum Dorje Neljormal Kandro kun dii dak nyi gyur/ Appearing as Vajrayogini, I give up my breasts and take on a bola, located in the center of the place where the kakola previously was.

At the very end, visualize that you return again to Vajrayogini's regular form, and recite: Lar yang Jetsun mey nampar gyur/ Once again, I return to the form of the Supremely Holy One. You should understand the two different ways of reciting this part of the practice and when they should be done. You have to learn some crucial points about this practice. There are several tantric vows that relate to it directly. One of the eight unique mother tantra vows is to not give up the correct view when you are entering into union (jortse ta dang drel mi ja ). One of the secondary tantric vows is to avoid entering into union without the three conceptions (dushe sum drel nyomjuk je). If you lack these three crucial conceptions then this practice will become a samsaric activity. The first conception is to view yourself as appearing in these deities' bodies. You do this when you recite, As Vajrayogini, I enter into union with Chakrasamvara who appeared from my katvanka in order to generate innate bliss-voidness. This means that you must visualize yourself as Vajrayogini and your katvanka as Chakrasamvara. You have to think, \"I am real Vajrayogini and I am real Chakrasamvara.\" You have to generate strong divine pride and pure appearances. Therefore, the first point is that you are visualizing yourself as appearing in the form of two deities who are pure Buddhas. You are meditating that they join together in order to develop inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The second conception is to view your speech as mantra. You have to reflect that your speech is not ordinary speech; it is Buddha dakini's speech. You also have to do mental concentration in connection with the mantras that bless the deities' secret organs. In addition, here you should think about the meaning of the mantra Om shri maha sukha vajra he he ru ru kam ah hung hung pet so ha."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The third conception is to view your mind as the supreme Dharma. This means that you are doing this practice to generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Yab yum nyom par shuk pey means the male and female deities join together. Jangsem shu wa chi wo ne means after they join together, the white bodhichitta substance melts and flows down from the crown of my head. Orin par le-ba na gawa means when this bodhichitta reaches my throat chakra, I experience the first bliss, called joy. At this same time, you have to meditate on the emptiness of this bliss. This experience is represented by the first of the bliss-whirls that appear in the four corners of Vajrayogini's mandala. Drinpa ne nying gar le-ba na chok ga means the bodhichitta continues to flow down from my throat. When it reaches my heart, I experience supreme joy, which is twice as strong as the first bliss. This also allows me to perceive emptiness more clearly. It represents the second of the four bliss-whirls. Nying ga ne te war le-ba na kye ga means when the bodhichitta travels from my heart and reaches my navel, I experience extraordinary joy, a bliss that is three times greater than before. My experience of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom continues to become clearer and my mind penetrates into emptiness even more deeply. Te wane norbii tser le-ba na hlenkye-kyi yeshe kye pey means when the bodhichitta .travels from my navel and reaches tile tip of the jewel at the end of the vajra, I experience innate wisdom. When the bodhichitta reaches my secret organ, I experience the innate bliss that is represented by the fourth bliss-whirl. At this time, your most subtle mind and air are experiencing the ultimate bliss and you are perceiving emptiness directly. Dewa dang tongpa nyi yer mepey ting nge dzin Ia nyom par shuk means that you have gained bliss-voidness wisdom and you have become absorbed in the concentration of inseparable bliss and voidness.

De tar detong yer me du jar wa de means this state is one in which bliss and voidness have been joined inseparably.

Sangwa dang de kona nyi-kyi cho pey nye par gyur means that you enjoy this experience of inseparable bliss and voidness, which is the essence of the secret offering and the offering of ultimate reality. You were introduced to the meanings contained in this practice during the Vajrayogini initiation. In the wisdom initiation, Vajrayogini joins together with all the Buddhas who have appeared in the form of Chakrasamvara. She then places the unique substance produced in that union into your secret organ. By lifting that substance up to your navel chakra, you experience the first bliss, called joy. Raising it from there to the heart, you experience supreme joy that is twice as great. From there the substance reaches the throat, and then finally to the top of the head. Every part of your body is covered with nerves. When the unique substance reaches the top of your head, it travels through all these nerves and produces great bliss all over your body. While experiencing this bliss, you perceive emptiness. Then you have to bring the substance back through the nerves and keep it in the head chakra. Understanding this part of the initiation is one crucial point relating to the secret offering and the offering of ultimate reality. The last two of the eight unique mother tantra vows are also very important points relating to this part of the practice. They are to practice the pure conduct of not releasing the kunda-like white bodhichitta (kunda mi jin tsang chO ten) and not feeling disgust when taking the bodhichitta substance (jangsem len tse kyuk tro pang). THE EIGHT LINES OF PRAISE A line from the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra says \"worshipping with all the mantras.\" (See page 10.) These eight lines of praise are a form of worshipping Vajrayogini by offering praise to her with mantras. Since they praise Vajrayogini's qualities, you have to think about their meaning as you recite them. Here they are recited in Sanskrit. In the Six-Session Guru Yoga practice and the Tsok offering, they are recited in Tibetan. In the Six-Session Guru Yoga practice there are also eight lines of praise to the male deity Heruka or Chakrasamvara. So there are two sets of eight lines of praise. When you recite both"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"sets together, first you recite the eight lines of praise for Heruka and then the eight lines of praise for Vajrayogini. Om namo bhagavati vajra varahibam hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the Blessed One, the Adamantine Sow. Hung hung pet. Om is the seed mantra for the body, speech, and mind of all the Buddhas. The Tibetan for namo is chaktsel, which means to bow down. However, just bending your body over is not making prostration; even caterpillars can do that. When you make prostrations to Vajrayogini, you have to keep a certain knowledge in your mind. The word chak in chaktsel is the honorific for hand. Tsel is also the respectful way of saying \"Please give it to me.\" Therefore, you should understand chaktsel to mean \"All my goals are in your hands. Please give me the ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom that you have in your hands.\" The Tibetan for bhagavati is chomden dema, which means Blessed One. The chom of chomden dema means to destroy. In simple terms, Vajrayogini has destroyed the two obscurations (drip nyi), and especially or~inary appearances and ordinary beliefs ( tamel-gyi nang shen). It shows that she has attained the ultimate cessation. Den means to possess. She possesses the ultimate knowledge of bliss-voidness wisdom. Besides ultimate knowledge, she also possesses a Buddha's great compassion and supreme power. De means to transcend; Vajrayogini's knowledge and her cessations have gone beyond samsara and Hinayana nirvana, and reached the ultimate goal of Buddhahood. She went beyond samsara by means of her inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom and she went beyond Hinayana nirvana by means of her great compassion. Ma is the feminine particle. It means that the ultimate bliss-voidness knowledge of a Buddha is appearing in a dakini' s form. Another explanation is based on several lines from the Hevajra Root Tantra:"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"A Buddha is called the Blessed One Because he has good fortune. Fortunes are said to be of six kinds, The qualities of perfect might and so on. Or he is the Blessed One for destroying The afflictions' demon and the rest. Clghr:IJ (}o[ld 2 I I The first two lines say that chomden dema means one who has good fortune. Good fortune is described as being of six types: perfect might, excellent physical form, ultimate fame, supreme glory, transcendent wisdom, and unceasing spontaneous energy. Blessed One can also be explained as one whose wisdom has destroyed the four demons: the demon of the mental afflictions, the demon of the five impure heaps, the demon of death, and the demon of the worldly god called \"Rati Ishvara\" ( Garab Wangchuk), which is another name for Shiva. Vajra varahibam in Tibetan is Dorje Pakmo, which means Adamantine Sow. Dorje means inseparable or very firm; that is, that which is incapable of being destroyed by obstacles. It also means that great bliss and wisdom are combined together inseparably. Pakmo means sow, which is a symbol for ignorance. This is the same as the pig that appears in the center of the drawing of the Wheel of Life and represents the root of samsara. Vajrayogini is the deity who destroys this sow of ignorance with her adamantine bliss-voidness wisdom. The last three syllables are hung hung pet. The two hung syllables occur frequently in the Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini practice; they represent the seed syllable of Chakrasamvara's mind. Pet has many meanings; in this case it removes and drives away all your outer and inner obstacles. Om namo arya aparadzite trelokya mati vidyeshvari hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the Noble One, Queen of Knowledge, the one who is invincible throughout the triple world.

Vajrayogini has triumphed over the mental afflictions in the triple world of the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm. The mistaken belief that entities are self-existent represents the ignorance that is samsara's root. Knowledge here is the wisdom that is the direct antidote for that ignorance. This perfection of wisdom exists both on the path and when the result of the path is attained. Vidyeshvari in Tibetan is rikmey wangchuk, which means Queen of Knowledge. Vajrayogini is the personification in a deity's form of the ultimate perfection of wisdom achieved at enlightenment. Om namah sarva bhuta bhaya avahe maha vajre hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the one who destroys all fear of demons with her great vajra. Hung hung pet. The Tibetan for sarva bhuta bhaya is jungpo jikpa tamche, which means all fear of demons. There are several interpretations of the word demon. The conventional meaning of demon refers to evil beings that can be found among the various realms of samsara. One of the four demons (dii) is called the demon of the worldly god (hla-yi bii dii ); therefore, even in the gods' realm certain beings are recognized as a form of demon. Those beings among demigods, hungry ghosts, animals, and even human beings who have very evil thoughts, whose wrong views are very strong, who have strong desire and hatred, and who do evil deeds, can also be thought of as demons. Some humans die and are reborn as harmful spirits; these are also demons in the conventional sense. Avahe maha vajre in Tibetan is dorje chenpo jom, which means she who destroys with her great vajra. Vajrayogini destroys all the fear of these outer demons with the chopknife she holds in her right hand."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The ultimate meaning of demon refers to the inner defects of the mental afflictions, egotism, and wrong views.

I prostrate to the one who is the vajra's seat, the invincible one with eyes that overpower. Hung hung pet. The Tibetan for vajra asani is dorjey den shuk, which means sl1e who is the vajra's seat. Here vajra refers to Chakrasamvara's male sexual organ. The seat of that vajra is Vajrayogini's lotus, because that is the place where Chakrasamvara's organ experiences bliss. This means Vajrayogini is the basis for generating inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. The Tibetan for adzite aparadzite is shen-gyi mi tub, which means im1incibleone; Vajrayogini is one whom no one can defeat. Washang kari netra is translated in Tibetan as wang je chen, which means she with eyes that overpower. This means Vajrayogini can control anyone merely by glaring at them with her three eyes. Om namo bhramani shokani rokani krodhe karaleni hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the one who desiccates Brahm a with the fury of her wrathful form. Hung hung pet. The Tibetan for bhramani shokani is tsangpa kempar dze; this means Vajrayogini has the power to desiccate Brahma. Brahma refers to the kunda-like white bodhichitta inside the head chakra. The Tibetan for rokani krodhe karaleni is tum-mo tromii suk-kyi. This means that Vajrayogini \"desiccates\" that white bodhichitta with the fury of her wratl~ful form. Fury here stands for her tum-mo or inner heat. Vajrayogini's wrathful form is also a metaphor for the great intensity"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"2 IIJ Suol tme /)drh m kcc!W?a jJdR.ldtsc of her tum-mo. She desiccates the white bodhichitta when the heat from her tum-mo travels up to the head chakra and strikes it there, causing it to melt and flow down. This collects all the bodhichitta in the nerves throughout the body and dissolves it into the central channel. By filling the central channel with this bodhichitta, she can draw all the inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom into the central channel and dissolve it there, filling her with that experience. Om namas trasani marani prabhedani paradzaye hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the Victorious One who terrifies and shatters demons. Hung hung pet. In Tibetan trasani marani prabhedani is dii nam trak ching kem pey. This means Vajrayogini terrifies and shatters demons. Outer demons are the demon Rati Ishvara ( Garab Wangchuk)-another name for Shiva-along with his retinue of evil beings. Inner demons range from the mental afflictions of desire, hatred, and ignorance to the subtle dualistic minds of luminosity, radiance, and near-attainment. Secret demons are all those evil human l::eings and spirits who dislike and hinder persons that strive to achieve enlightenment. Vajrayogini terrifies and shatters; that is, she splits apart the heads of all these demons. Paradzaye in Tibetan is shen-gyi chok le gyel. This means that by having destroyed all demons, Vajrayogini is the Victorious One-she has achieved complete victory over the two mental obscurations (drip nyi) and their subtle traces. Om namo vijaye dzambhani tambani mohani hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the one who conquers those that dull, stupefy, and confound. Hung hung pet.

Om namo vajravarahi maha yogini kameshvari ka ge hung hung pet/ Om. I prostrate to the Adamantine Sow, great yogini, supreme mistress of desires, and celestial being. Hung hung pet. Vajravarahi or Adamantine Sow was explained earlier in the first line of praise. Maha yogini, or jor chen in Tibetan, means great yogini. This is describing Vajrayogini as the great consort of Chakrasamvara. The Tibetan for kameshvari is dowangma, which means supreme mistress who has power over all desires. Vajrayogini can grant us all the temporary and ultimate goals. She has complete mastery and control of the entire path. Therefore, she can give us knowledge of any part of it, from how to serve a spiritual teacher up to the state of ultimate union. Ka ge is the Sanskrit word for celestial being. When you recite the eight lines of praise, emanate goddesses from your heart and visualize that they grasp your feet between their joined palms and praise you with this recitation. This practice serves both as a form of praise and as an offering. BENEFITS OF RECITING THE EIGHT liNES OF PRAISE In the root tantras Buddha Vajradhara describes endless benefits of reciting the eight lines of praise. Here I will briefly mention just a few. Whenever you see your root lama, or images of Buddhas, holy books, and stupas, or if you go on a pilgrimage to a holy place, first generate faith in them. Then, while making prostrations, recite the eight lines of praise seven or three times, or at least once. You should also visualize yourself as Vajrayogini and recognize that the external"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"world of the sky, earth, mountains, trees, forests, houses, as well as all the six realms' sentient beings who live there, are all her real nature. Then recite these eight lines of praise to yourself. This way you can easily collect the same amount of merit as if you praised all the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three times. You will also very quickly experience the same great bliss that Chakrasamvara himself continually enjoys. Anyone who recites these eight lines of praise will receive blessings from Heruka, Vajrayogini, the four essence yoginis, and the twenty-four pairs of dakas and dakinis. They will all come directly to you and enter your mind and remain there happily holding you in their compassion. Even other sentient beings who are alive at the same time as you and who can see, hear, and think about you will acquire great merit from your recitation of these lines of praise. When you recite the eight lines of praise, feel great joy that Chakrasamvara and all the dakas and dakinis are actually sitting inside you and blessing your mind. Then confess to them all your bad deeds that you collected since beginningless time, and beseech them to give you all the goals that you want to achieve in this life and in your future lives. After that, reflect that they have agreed to your request. This practice is a very skillful and powerful method for achieving great merit instantly without any difficulty. It has the same benefit as traveling great distances to go on a pilgrimage to any of the twenty-four holy Chakrasamvara places, such as the Mountain of Five Peaks in China, Mt. Kailash, or Tsari Mountain in southeastern Tibet. Some of these places are very dangerous; robbers and primitive people live there. It is also much easier to recite the eight lines of praise than to prepare great offerings of a hundred or a thousand butter lamps and other objects, or to recite prayers to Dharma protectors asking them to help you overcome illnesses and other obstacles. Therefore, if you want to do something that will benefit you in this life, in the intermediate state, and in future lives, you should regard this practice as most valuable and holy. If you want to help someone-whether alive, about to die, or already dead-then you should do this very recitation practice.

If you have time, you should meditate on these visualizations continually to improve your divine pride and pure appearances. You must generate divine pride, thinking, \"I am these thirty-seven dakinis. I am they; they are me.\" The pure appearances are made better by practicing the visualizations. The proper time for cultivating these practices extensively is before the mantra recitation. When you get tired from doing those meditations, you should begin the mantra recitation. There are various purposes for reciting the mantra, such as bringing you closer to the tutelary deity, removing bad deeds, making your speech more powerful, performing different tantric activities, planting seeds for achieving a Buddha's speech, ripening your mind so that you can gain the level of the completion stage called \"speech isolation\" ( ngak wen), and enabling you to quickly receive the deity's blessing that will grant you spiritual attainments. The ninth yoga has two parts, verbal recitation and mental recitation. For the verbal recitation, you need a mala or prayer beads. The tantras say that one of the best kinds of malas is made from the bone of a human skull. But you won't be able to find such a mala. The tantras also say that prayer beads made from bodetse seeds are suitable for reciting mantras related to all the different tantric activities.

However, you can bless your beads by reciting the Om Suma (Triple Om) mantra three times and blowing on them as you rub them between your hands. The Vajrayogini mantra recitation is a form of controlling activity (wang-gi le ). Therefore, the best way to hold your beads when you recite the mantra is to lay them over the ring finger of your left hand and pull the beads toward you with your thumb. If this becomes uncomfortable, after a while you can lay them over your index finger. VERBAL RECITATION There are several different kinds of recitation; the two main ones are mental recitation (yin de) and verbal recitation (ngak de). But there are also several visualizations related to verbal recitation; one is called the orb-like recitation (gong-bii depa) and another is the pledge recitation (damtsik-gi depa ). Other traditions describe these visualizations using different terms. There are also various expressions that describe styles of recitation. In the Gyii-me Tantric College for example, monks must recite the mantras in what is called \"a wrathful tone\" (trowo depa). They cannot recite mantras in a low voice; everyone must recite with one voice and it has to sound very forceful. A proctor walks up and down the lines of monks to make sure that everyone is reciting properly and no one has fallen asleep. Anyone found sleeping is made to hold his bowl in his hands until the administrator removes it. Another style is called \"whispering recitation\" (shubii depa). There are several general instructions about how a mantra should be recited. The various syllables should not be run together so that they sound like one continuous word. Each syllable should be clearly articulated. You shouldn't recite too slowly either. Therefore, recite at a lively rate, but not too quickly. The level of sound should be low but still audible to you and anyone within a distance of a few feet. A person farther away than that should not be able to hear you. During the verbal recitation, it is wrong if you don't produce the sound of the mantra by moving your mouth and tongue."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Nrnrh (}ogtl 223 Rang-gi nying gar chonjung marpo dru sum nyi tsek-kyi nang du dawey kyilkor-gyi ii-su Bam-yik la ngak treng kadok marpo yonkor du korwa le woser marpo pak me tro/ Semchen tamche-kyi dik drip jangl Sang-gye tamche cho/ De nam-kyi jinlab nii tu tamche woser marpo nampar chen drang Bam-yik ngak treng dang che pa la tim pey gyii jin-gyi lab-par gyur/ Om om om sarva buddha dakiniye vajra varnaniye vajra vairotsaniye hung hung hung pet pet pet so hal At the center of a moon cushion inside the two intersecting triangular red dharma sources in my heart is a Bam syllable surrounded counterclockwise by the red mantra chain.

The second is the one inside which the body mandala is located. The third is inside the heart of the body mandala's central deity-Vajrayogini. Here the ritual is referring to the latter. Dawey kyilkor-gyi ii-su Bam-yik Ia ngak treng kadok marpo yon kor du korwa le means a moon cushion is located there, and at the center of this moon cushion is a Bam syllable surrounded counterclockwise by the red thirty-two syllable mantra chain.

For example, if you light a ring of candles on a birthday cake, from a distance they look like a single mass of light."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Actually, each of the candles gives off its own light. Similarly, the mantra chain with the Bam syllable in the center appears as a single mass of red light inside the double dharma source. Also imagine that each of the mantra's thirty-two syllables emits its own sound. Woser marpo pak me tro means the Bam syllable and mantra chain emanate countless light rays. Semchen tamche-kyi dik drip jang means these light rays reach all sentient beings and purify them of their bad deeds and mental obscurations. This is one activity that the light rays accomplish. After reaching all the sentient beings of the three realms, these light rays first purify the places where these beings live and turn them into Vajrayogini's paradise. Then they turn all the sentient beings into Vajrayogini's form. Because of this, none of samsara's impurities are left anywhere. You should think to yourself, \"I have removed all sentient beings' suffering and bad qualities, and I have given them the ultimate happiness of Vajrayogini's state.\" Then draw all the light rays back and dissolve them into you. Sang-gye tamche cho means the Bam syllable and mantra chain emanate light rays once again and this time they present offerings to all the Buddhas. This is the second activity they accomplish. The tips of each of these light rays carry dakinis who are holding various offerings. The light rays reach all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, as well as the sentient beings who were just turned into Vajrayoginis. The offerings that are presented to them cause them to generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. At this time, you should reflect that all these Buddhas and Bodhisattvas experience great happiness. This joy is the main offering. The purpose of the offerings is to produce happiness in the minds of those who receive them. That is what puja-the Sanskrit word for making an offering-means. After you have satisfied all the Buddhas with these offerings, withdraw the offering dakinis and the light rays on which they travelled.

As you agreed during the initiation, you must recite the mantra at least seven times each day. Actually, you should continue reciting as long as you can. The Om Suma mantra is a combination of two mantras: Om sarva buddha dakiniye vajra varnaniye fumg hung pet so ha and Om vajra vairotsaniye hung hung pet so ha. There are three Om syllables at the beginning as well as three Hung and three Pet syllables at the end, because the complete mantra consists of three parts. The first part, sarva buddha dakiniye, means the dakini who is the essence of all the Buddhas; but this is not a call addressed to a female deity's form. While the term dakini literally means sky-traveller (kandroma ), the actual meaning here is that all Buddhas' great ecstasy travels in the sky of emptiness. Their wisdom penetrates deeply into the emptiness of all entities. Therefore, it refers to all the Buddhas' omniscience and their bliss-voidness wisdom; it describes a Buddha's wisdom body or dharmakaya. When you recite this part of the mantra, you are referring to Vajrayogini's wisdom body that is the essence of all Buddhas' minds. This wisdom is also our main goal. But to achieve it we need to learn the Dharma by having teachers speak to us. They have to teach us verbally. The second part of the mantra, vajra varnaniye, describes how the goal of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom is taught to us. It refers to Vajrayogini as the adamantine proclaimer. This means that she is the adamantine vajra of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom appearing as the sound that proclaims the Dharma's meaning to followers. When you recite this part of the mantra, you are referring to her enjoyment body or sambhogakaya that is the essence of all Buddhas' speech. In order to be taught about inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom, we need a teacher who is in physical form. The third part of the mantra, vajra vairotsaniye, describes Vajrayogini as the adamantine appearance. This means that she is the adamantine vajra of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom appearing to followers in a physical form in order to help them. When you recite this part of the mantra, you are referring to Vajrayogini as the emanation body or nirmanakaya that is the essence of all Buddhas' bodies."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Therefore, the entire mantra's meaning is that Vajrayogini appears in ~er emanation body form and uses the speech that is the essence of her enjoyment body to teach us about the ultimate bliss-voidness wisdom, which penetrates deeply into the emptiness that is the true nature of all entities. If you recite the mantra with this understanding, you will collect an incredibly great amount of virtue. The Om om om syllables at the beginning are said to refer to the body, speech, and mind elements of all the Buddhas' wisdom bodies; the hung hung hung syllables at the end refer to the body, speech, and mind elements of all the Buddhas' enjoyment bodies; and the pet pet pet syllables refer to the body, speech, and mind elements of all the Buddhas' emanation bodies. The final syllables so ha are an exclamation calling for the power of the mantra's blessing to become firmly implanted in your mind. As you recite the mantra, visualize that all the body mandala deities are emanating light rays. But if that is too difficult, you can visualize that they are emanating only from the Bam syllable and mantra chain in the heart of the central Vajrayogini. At the same time, visualize that the mantra itself is being recited by all thirty-seven of the body mandala deities. If you are doing a retreat, you should do all the visualizations at the start of each meditation period. Later in the period, as you continue reciting the mantra, concentrate ·on developing the dear appearances, without losing divine pride. This means you should meditate on the mandala and your deity form. This will help you to avoid stimulating the winds in your body too much, which could cause you to become sick. From time to time, you can focus again on the Bam syllable and mantra chain in your heart as you continue practicing the verbal recitation. SPECIAL QUALITIES OF V A]RAYOGINI'S MANTRA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE If you received the initiations of Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini from a lama in your previous life and have studied and practiced this path before, then you have a lot of good seeds for this teaching tradition. This makes you a very fortunate person in this field. Such a person can achieve spiritual goals in this life just by reciting the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Nmch ()o{Jd 227 Vajrayogini mantra and achieve the goals without having to stay in retreat for a long time. As the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra dec::lares: Success is achieved by reciting this mantra; It accomplishes all activities and virtues. The person who properly receives Chakrasamvara's initiation achieves the same result that could be achieved by recetvmg initiation into any of the four classes of tantra. He can invoke any of the peaceful or wrathful deities. Chakrasamvara's splendor is supreme and outshines that of all other deities. The excellent yogis and yoginis who learn about this practice will realize that all other teachings are like straw compared with the fire of Chakrasamvara's great practice. Therefore, you have to realize the value of this practice. Don't be like a beggar who doesn't know that a gold treasure lies buried in his backyard. Recognize the holy jewels that you hold in your hands and use them to derive as much value and benefit as you can from your human life. None of the other tantras could exist if Buddha had not taught Chakrasamvara in this world, because the essence and teaching system of all the other tantras are related to this system. All the other great tantras rely upon the teaching system of the Glorious Blood Drinker (Heruka). \"Blood Drinker\" is an epithet of Chakrasamvara. Blood here means emptiness. Chakrasamvara is called \"Blood Drinker\" because he always perceives emptiness directly. Chakrasamvara's teaching is the king of tantric teachings; Chakrasamvara's practice is the most efficient and supreme activity. You cannot find anything higher in any of the world's three realms. Vajrayogini's Om Suma mantra contains the essence of all the dakinis' mantras. Therefore, you can achieve the same goals as if you recited each dakini's mantra separately just by reciting the Om Suma mantra. The Root Tantra declares: It is the essence of all dakinis. Just reciting this mantra Brings all the attainments."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"There are four main kinds of tantric activities: pacifying, increasing, controlling, and forceful. Pacifying activities (shiwey le) remove outer and inner obstacles, such as illnesses. The purpose of increasing activities (gyepey le) is to increase a person's life span, wealth, fame, as well as virtue and spiritual knowledge. Controlling activities (wang-gi le) are for controlling inner and outer enemies, and to gain power over both good and bad things. If inner and outer enemies cannot be subdued by any of the first three kinds of activities, you have to use forceful activities (drakpO le ). Any of these kinds of activities anywhere in the three realms can be achieved through reciting and practicing Vajrayogini's mantra. This mantra enables you to easily achieve any spiritual goal you need. Therefore, this mantra is unsurpassed. It is the most holy and profound mantra for receiving all the spiritual attainments from the dakas and dakinis. Reciting Vajrayogini's mantra can bring you any temporary goals you may want to achieve, such as long life and wealth. It can cure physical illnesses, contagious diseases, and mental unhappiness. It can prevent frost and hail from damaging crops. It can avert famine and bring or stop rain as needed, and it can protect you from being harmed by nagas, demigods, and other powerful spirits. It can give you the power to gain control over other persons and to accumulate wealth. It can also enable you to forcefully overcome evil persons. These explanations are only a brief description of the special qualities of this mantra. However, the main benefit of reciting Vajrayogini's mantra and practicing the generation and completion stages of her path is that you can achieve the supreme goal of ultimate enlightenment within this very lifetime or within a relatively short period of time. No tantric teaching other than the Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini practice has such great blessings that actually increase when the times become more degenerate. Therefore, the opportunity to practice such a teaching is extremely rare in the world. Even tantric yogis and yoginis who don't achieve the state of ultimate union within this life will be led to Kechara Paradise by Chakrasamvara, dakas, and dakinis. Therefore, for them death is just a word; they do not experience the slightest pain. Instead, for them, death is like a son returning to his father's home. They can pass away with a great sense of joy, confidence, and security."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Nmrh UorJd 229 This practice also allows you to purify all your karmic obstacles. In your next life you will either be reborn in Kechara Paradise or as someone who has the opportunity to practice this holy Dharma. Therefore, if you abandon such a holy practice to pursue some other kind of spiritual path, your effort will be meaningless. That kind of activity is like trying to get butter by churning water. It doesn't matter what social class you are from, whether you are wealthy or not, or that your behavior may seem inferior to worldly persons. If you are a practitioner of this teaching, Chakrasamvara and all the dakas and dakinis will come and bless the place where you live and all the people who live there. Buddha Chakrasamvara himself declared in the Root Tantra: Whatever place is inhabited By a yogi or supreme hero, Even of low caste or a barbarian, That region is a favored one. In order to watch over beings, I shall always abide there. In short, anyone who practices the Chakrasamvara or Vajrayogini teaching gains merit and spiritual benefits that are beyond description. Therefore, the opportunity to practice this extraordinary deity's teachings and recite her mantra is the most profound and most holy method of deriving value from a precious human life that is endowed with the qualities of leisure and fortune. MENTAL RECITATION AND THE ~'0 INCIDENTAL COMPLETION STAGE PRACTICES In the mental recitation, you have to read the mantra silently with your wisdom. This means you don't recite the mantra aloud as you did during the verbal recitation. Your wisdom is appearing in the form of the Bam syllable in the center of the moon cushion inside your heart. From that Bam syllable, you have to mentally read the Om Suma mantra at least three times."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"There are also two incidental completion stage practices. In our lineage we have to do the mental recitation in between these two completion stage practices. Therefore, you must start with the first completion stage practice. Then you do the mental recitation, and finally the second completion stage practice. This order was established by great sages through their experience of how the completion stage realizations are best gained. They did this because the meditation object in the first completion stage practice is not as narrowly focused as the one in the mental recitation. Therefore, practicing in the order they prescribed helps to ripen your mind so that you can achieve the actual completion stage. FIRST INCIDENTAL COMPLETION STAGE PRACflC'..E When you do the first completion stage practice, you can withdraw the body mandala and just focus on your outer Vajrayogini or you can keep the whole body mandala visualization. If you withdraw the body mandala, focus on your main outer form as Vajrayogini with the two intersecting dharma sources in your heart. Inside the double dharma source visualize the moon cushion with the Bam syllable at its center surrounded by the thirty-two syllable mantra. The Bam syllable and the mantra chain are red and standing upright on the moon cushion. First you have to lower the double dharma source, complete with moon cushion, Bam syllable, and mantra chain, to your navel. If you didn't withdraw the body mandala, lower the double dharma source complete with the body mandala down to your navel in the same way. You do this by slowly inhaling and then, as you gently swallow your saliva, pushing down the whole set from the heart chakra to the navel chakra. You are not practicing correctly if you think that your mind has stayed in the heart chakra and you are watching the Bam syllable and mantra chain below you in the navel chakra. Your mind has to stay inside the Bam syllable and go down to the navel chakra and sit there along with it. From there visualize that the red tip of the nada flame on top of the Bam syllable becomes so hot that it is about to burst into flames. While visualizing the tip of the nada, you should also focus on the four bliss-whirls in the corners of the double dharma source. As you do this visualization, reflect that tht• whole"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Nmch Yorp. 231 meditation object is your wisdom. You have to hold your breath during the entire time that you are doing this practice. You have to complete the meditation before exhalin~ As you meditate, lightly rub your left knee with your right hand, then your right knee, and finally the top of your head; then snap your fingers. This represents one count. Do this practice for three counts and then slowly exhale. The reason this is considered a completion stage practice is that you are meditating inside your central channel at the navel chakra. The generation stage practices are mostly done by visualizing your outer body as appearing in the form of Vajrayogini. The main practice in the generation stage is taking the three ordinary experiences of death, bardo, and rebirth as paths to a Buddha's three bodies (ku sum lam kyer ). Even though your main practice is the generation stage, you are also allowed to do a brief completion stage meditation in this Vajrayogini system. It is called an \"incidental practice\" because it is not your main practice. Vajrayogini has three forms: outer, inner, and secret. The outer Vajrayogini is the deity who stays in Kechara Paradise. The inner Vajrayogini is the Bam syllable that normally sits inside your heart chakra. The secret Vajrayogini is your inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. In this completion stage practice you are meditating on the inner Vajrayogini. This is a unique quality of this Vajrayogini system. None of the other Highest Yoga Tantras-Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, Yamantaka, Kalachakra, or Hevajra-allows you to do any completion stage practices when you are still on the generation stage path. MENTAL REciTATION The mental recitation practice starts the same way as the first completion stage practice. This time, however, forget about the tip of the nada flame and the four bliss-whirls. After you inhale and hold your breath, you have to focus on each of the thirty-two bright red syllables of the Om Suma mantra and read them silently with your mind. Again, you can't release your breath until you have read the entire mantra at least three times. When you've done this, you can then slowly exhale."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Because the mantra syllables are closer to the middle of the central channel than the four bliss-whirls, your mind is focused more narrowly during the mental recitation practice. This helps to collect all the airs inside the central channel. If you were to do the first incidental completion practice after the mental recitation, it would have the opposite effect. SECOND INCIDENTAL COMPLETION STAGE PRACTICE Now raise the double dharma source with the moon cushion, Bam syllable, and mantra chain back up to the heart chakra. Having done this, visualize that the double dharma source dissolves into the moon cushion, the moon cushion dissolves into the mantra chain, and the mantra chain dissolves into the Bam syllable. Then, finally, let the Bam syllable gradually dissolve from the bottom up, until the nada flame disappears into voidness. Continue meditating for a while on that emptiness. Now visualize just the central channel going straight up through the center of your body to the top of your head and curving down to the point between your eyebrows. This is the central channel's upper tip. The bottom part of the central channel goes straight down to the secret place, or Vajrayogini's sexual organ, which is its lower tip. Visualize the central channel as having four characteristics. The first is that it is very straight, like a bamboo stick. It needs to be straight so that the airs and unique substances can easily travel through it. This will enable you to gain inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom very well. Second, it is very soft, like the petal of a lotus flower; don't visualize it as stiff and hard. This allows your sense of feeling to be more sensitive. Third, it has a very rich, deep red color. Fourth, it is very clear and bright, like candlelight; don't visualize it as dark or opaque and blocking light. Visualize it as about one-quarter of an inch in diameter. Let your mind go down through the central channel to its lower tip. Inside the hole there is a bliss-whirl made of white bodhichitta that is spinning counterclockwise. Then go up the central channel to the top of your head. From there, you can see at the opening of the upper tip a bliss-whirl made of red bodhichitta that is also spinning counterclockwise. First focus on the white bliss-whirl inside the"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Nmr:h Uogc. 233 central channel's lower tip. Visualize that it is spinning very fast; then draw it up slowly through the central channel toward your heart. As it rises up the central channel, meditate that it produces ever-increasing great ecstasy throughout your body and that your mind experiences this ecstasy. When.. the bliss-whirl reaches the heart, hold it there and visualize that it continues to spin counterclockwise. Keep one part of your mind focused on this bliss-whirl. Then let your mind go through the central channel up to the top of your head. From there, visualize that you can see the second red bliss-whirl at the central channel's upper tip between your eyebrows. Lift this spinning red bliss-whirl up through the central channel until it reaches the top of your head. After that, let it continue traveling down toward your heart. As it moves down, meditate that your awareness of emptiness is becoming more and more clear to your mind. Visualize that the red bliss-whirl reaches the white bliss-whirl and touches it. After spinning there separately for some time, they combine into a light red color. Then, the combined bliss-whirls start to get smaller and smaller until finally they disappear into emptiness at your heart. Focus on that emptiness with your mind and meditate on inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. When you have meditated long enough, wake up from that emptiness and visualize the three nerves, the chakras, and the double dharma source with the moon cushion, Bam syllable, and mantra chain in your heart. If you are practicing with the body mandala, visualize that whole set again in your heart. Finally, at the end of these practices, you have to recite the Hundred-Syllable Heruka Vajrasattva mantra once. This is done to make amends for any errors-such as losing your concentration or reciting the mantra syllables incorrectly-that you may have committed during these practices. This mantra removes the negative effects of your transgressions and restores your practice. While it is proper for you to meditate on these completion stage practices, you should only do them from time to time, so that you don't forget them. Don't make them your regular practice.

Inconceivable practice, sleeping practice, and taking the three bodies as the path are very similar, but in sleeping yoga and common inconceivable practice you don't apply the fourth quality because that thought, divine pride, has as its object a relative truth object, and therefore, in those two cases, you are cultivating a coarser mind of relative truth.

These mantras are referred to by several expressions; one is the \"Mantras of the Deity With Four Faces\" (she/ shibey ngak). This name comes from the Chakrasamvara practice in which the male deity recites the mantras with each of his four faces. They are also called the \"Terror-inspiring Mantras\" ( tsam ngam-kyi ngak) because their sound strikes terror into the hearts of all demons and harmful spirits. Here you appear in Vajrayogini's form and recite the mantras to encourage the Dharma protectors to eliminate all obstacles and harmful influences. Om sumbha ni sumbha hung hung pet/ Om grihna grihna hung hung pet/ Om grihnapaya grihnapaya hung hung pet/ Om anaya ho bhagavan vajra hung hung pet/ (2x) While reciting these mantras, reflect that their essence is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom and their sound is as powerful as a thousand simultaneous thunderclaps. The mantras literally mean, \"Om. Overpower them! Completely overpower them! Hung hung pet.\" \"Om. Seize them! Seize them! Hung hung pet.\" \"Om. Cause them to be seized! Cause them to be seized! Hung hung pet,\" and \"Om. Bring them back, 0 Adamantine Blessed One! Hung hung pet.\" Visualize that the mantras come out of your mouth in the form of a blazing fire that gives off sparks accompanied by numerous red light rays. As the mantras and light rays go out to each of the ten directions, they form a great sphere of red light all around you that protects you from harmful spirits and any obstacles to your practice. The four mantras are recited twice. The first time you recite them you make a finger-snapping gesture with the thumb and index finger of your left hand in each of the four cardinal directions, starting in the east and proceeding counterclockwise. When you recite Om sumbha ni sumbha hung hung pet, snap your fingers twice--once directly in front of you and then a second time slightly above that.

At the end, you can also visualize the adamantine ground, walls, roof, ceiling, outer ring of fire, and so on that appear in Vajrayogini's mandala, just as you did during the practice of taking rebirth as the path to Vajrayogini's emanation body. MAINTAINING THE THREE ATTITUDES When doing everyday activities in between meditation periods, you should practice maintaining the three attitudes (kyer so sum-gyi neljor). These relate to your regular activities of body, speech, and mind. The purpose of this practice is to prevent you from letting your everyday activities become ordinary and harming the beneficial effect of the activities you did during the meditation period. Otherwise, your meditation practice will be like the castles children build in the sand while playing on the beach, and the activities you do after your meditation period will be like a wave that comes along and washes away any sign of whatever they made. The practice you do during a meditation period should benefit what you do between meditation periods. Likewise, the activities you do between meditation periods should support the practice you do during a meditation period. This will prevent your spiritual practice from deteriorating and ensure that you quickly reach a higher level. The first of the three attitudes is called \"maintaining the attitude that all visible forms are the deity's body\" (nang-u.>a kii kyer so). Reflect that your mind is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom and, with your divine pride, identify yourself with the deity Vajrayogini. Then reflect that every external form you perceive is Vajrayogini's body appearing in many different sizes. Her body appears everywhere, like when you open a sesame pod and see the inside completely filled with sesame seeds. In doing this, it is enough to reflect that the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Clcvcm:.h Yoga. 249 nature of these visible objects is Vajrayogini's body; you don't have to visualize them as appearing in the form of her body. The second attitude is called \"maintaining the attitude that all sounds are void of any self-existent nature and their essence is the deity's speech\" (drak tong sung-gi kyer so). Reflect that all the Vajrayoginis you perceive everywhere are continually reciting the Om Suma mantra, and that every sound you hear is the sound of this mantra. The third attitude is called \"maintaining the attitude that all your thoughts are the deity's mind of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom\" (dren tok tuk-kyi kyer so). Generate the awareness that the deity you are meditating on, you the practitioner, and all the inner and outer entities you perceive are merely ascribed by your own mind; none of them has a self-existent essence. In combination with this view of emptiness, you should also cultivate the great compassion that wishes to free all sentient beings from their suffering. BLESSING THE OUTER OFFERINGS After arranging outer offerings on the altar, you have to bless them before you can offer them. The blessing ritual has three parts: clearing away hindering spirits (sangwa), dissolving the offering objects into emptiness (jangwa), and generating the offerings (kyepa). To chase away the demons you have to emanate the dakini Kandarohi from the Bam syllable in your heart. After this dakini chases them away, you have to dissolve her back into your heart. The second part of the blessing-dissolving the offerings into emptiness-is done to purify them and transform them from their ordinary condition. The third part is to generate the pure offerings in front of you. These pure offerings have three qualities: their essence is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom, their outer form is that of each individual offering, and their function is to produce pure bliss in the minds of the beings to whom they are offered. The words here are the same as those recited earlier in the ritual when you blessed the outer offerings before presenting them to the merit field of the root and lineage lamas (see pages 62-65)."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"2!10 Sublmx: /]arh l':o kcr:h:w. ~diSC Om kandarohi hung hung pet/ Om svabhava shuddha sarva dharma svabhava shuddho ham/ Tongpa nyi du gyur/ Tong pey ngang le Kam le to pey no nam-kyi nang du Hung le cho dze nam rang shin tong nyi/ Nam pa cho dze so so nampa chen/ Je le wangpo druk-gi cho yul du sak pa mepey dewa kye par chen terwar gyur/ Om argham Ah Hung/ Om padyam Ah Hung!

BLESSING THE TORMA OFFERING The ritual for blessing the torma is the same as that for blessing the inner offering (see pages 49-61). The only difference is in the objects that are being blessed. This time you are blessing the torma offering that you will offer to Vajrayogini and all the other guests. When you bless the torma, it turns into a nectar that is liquid in nature.

PRAISING V A]RAYOGINI AND THE DAKINIS After presenting the outer and inner offerings, recite the following two verses of praise to Vajrayogini. Pelden dorje kandroma/ Kandroma-yi korlo gyur/ Yeshe ngan-den ku sum nye/ Drowa kyob Ia chak tsello/ I prostrate to the glorious Vajra Dakini, queen of dakinis, The Savior of beings who has The five wisdoms and the three bodies."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"256 S{/Oltmc {Jc.\\rll w Kt··c:h.\\Ri\\ J~rltsr: Pelden means glorious. Vajrayogini is glorious not only because of the splendor revealed in all the great ornaments that adorn her body, but also because of the quality of her inner knowledge. Dorje Kandroma means Vajra Dakini. Vajra here refers to Vajrayogini's inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Dakini literally means sky-goer; here it refers to her ultimate wisdom that travels deeply into the sky of emptiness. Kandroma-yi korlo gyur means that this wisdom appears in the outer form of the deity who is the queen of dakinis. Yeshe ngan-den means Vajrayogini has the five Buddha wisdoms: mirror wisdom, sameness wisdom, discriminating wisdom, performance wisdom, and dharma-sphere wisdom. Ku sum nye means she has achieved the three bodies of a Buddha: the wisdom body, enjoyment body, and emanation body. Drowa kyob la chak tsello means I prostrate to the savior of beings. Ji nye dorje kandroma/ Kun tu tokpey ching cho chingl Jikten ja wey rim juk mal De nye nam la chak tsello/ I prostrate to all the many vajra dakinis Who cut the bonds of conceptual thought Even while doing various forms Of worldly activity. Ji nye dorje kandroma means all the many vajra dakinis that appear in the world. They are all different emanations of Vajrayogini. Kun tu tokpey ching cho ching means their main function is to cut the bonds of conceptual thought. Conceptual thought here means bad thoughts, such as the mental afflictions, and especially ordinary belief and ordinary perceptions. These thoughts are the main bonds that keep us from seeing ourselves as Vajrayogini's emanation body. The instrument that can cut them is inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Vajrayogini's main activity is to help beings cut these bonds. She does this by sending out many emanations of herself into the world.

PRAYER TO SEE THE GLORIOUS FACE OF THE QUEEN OF KECHARA \"Prayer to See the Glorious Face of the Queen of Kechara\" is the name of a miinlam prayer composed by Tsarchen Lose! Gyatso, one of our Vajrayogini lineage lamas. Vajrayogini once appeared directly in front of him when he was practicing in a region known as Penbo. Extemporaneously, he recited these eight verses to her. Because of the extraordinary circumstances in which the prayer came to be, it is extremely holy and has great blessings. There is also a special chanting style for this prayer called Takpii dak nang, which means the chant from Takpu Rinpoche's vision. The melody and rhythm come from hearing dakinis as they were singing holy dharma songs. Many great lamas experience visions in which they hear dakinis singing. Later they teach us what they heard and it becomes a special chanting style. Ta ye gyel wey detong do gar nil Si shi mik trul chir yang charwa le/ Deng dir kacho wangmo yi wong rna/ Nying ne dren no kyu-bey tse ge kyongl Of all the worldly and transcendent forms of illusion In which the pageant of limitless Conquerors' blissful wisdom can appear, Now it has arisen here as the sublime Queen of Kechara. I keep you in my heart; please hold me in your blissful embrace.

That wisdom is the main tool that produces her. The general meaning of do gar is theatrical show. Sometimes actors appear as a king, sometimes as a queen, sometimes as a minister, a criminal, or a judge. Generally, only ordinary persons are portrayed in a regular play, and only ordinary persons go to see such a performance. Vajrayogini, however, is a divine actress whose essence is the inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom of all the Buddhas. She can appear to everyone, samsaric beings as well as those who have transcended samsara. Ni is a grammar particle that emphasizes the word that precedes it. Ordinary magic shows are mik trul or illusions. A magician can create appearances of elephants and other objects. Si shi mik trul means a Buddha's inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom can appear in many worldly and transcendent illusory forms. Chir yang charwa le means of all the countless illusory forms in which that wisdom can appear; Deng dir kacho wangmo yi wong ma means now it has appeared here before Tsarchen Losel Gyatso as the sublime Queen of Kechara Paradise. Vajrayogini has appeared in a supremely beautiful form with all her ornaments and instruments. Nying ne dren no means I remember you and keep you in my heart all the time. Kyu-bey tse ge kyong means because I am a devoted practitioner, please hold me in your blissful embrace-that is, sustain me with the great bliss that comes from being embraced by you.

Wokmin shing na means when you are staying in Akanishta Paradise-another name for Vajrayogini's divine Buddha field of Dakpa Kacho-you appear as the main deity who is an innate dakini. There are several levels of dakinis: innate, field-born, and mantra-born. Innate or hlenkye means arising together. In this case it means great ecstasy and ultimate wisdom arise together and occur in the same ultimate mind. When that mind appears in a female deity's form, it is called the \"innate dakini.\" Hlenkye gyel yum ma, or Conqueror's innate consort, refers to this innate dakini. Conqueror here refers specifically to Buddha Chakrasamvara; Vajrayogini is Chakrasamvara's consort. Nyer shi yul na means when you are staying in the twenty-four holy places, you appear as field-born dakinis. These twenty-four places are found here in the desire realm and are also Vajrayogini's holy paradise. Shing kye dakima, or field-born dakinis, have the same essence as the innate dakini.

This type of disciple can wake up in Vajrayogini's impure illusory body (ma dakpey gyulii) during the bardo state. Even the lowest type of disciple who doesn't practice meditation extensively can achieve the state of ultimate union within sixteen lifetimes if he doesn't break any of the tantric vows and observes the offering ritual that is held each month on the tenth day of the waxing and waning moons (tse-chii chiipa).

This is a reference to a miraculous story that involves the practitioner named Kusali. Jetson Kusali describes him as the holy practitioner Kusali. Kusali is an epithet that means a person who hides his practice and maintains a humble appearance, avoiding any outward show of spiritual knowledge. In the Lamrim tradition this practitioner is also known as Getsul Tsembuwa, which means he was a novice monk who came from a family of tailors. Kusali was a follower of the great tantric yogi Krishnacharya (Nakpo Chiipa ), who was a great practitioner of Chakrasamvara. Krishnacharya, Luipa, and Ghantapada were the originators of the three main lineages of Chakrasamvara practice. Krishnacharya was a highly renowned teacher who was treated with great honor. Once when Kusali was traveling with his teacher, they came to the edge of the Ganges River. As they were preparing to cross, an old leper woman asked for help fording the river. No one but Kusali was willing to help the old woman. He wrapped her in a cloak and carried her on his back.

After she takes you there, you also want her to help you achieve all the spiritual attainments. Jikten dang jikten le depey ngodrup ma Iii pa tsel du sol means please grant us all the worldly and transcendent spiritual attainments. One interpretation of worldly spiritual attainments is that it refers to all the knowledges of the path before you achieve a direct realization of voidness. This means it includes all the paths of the generation stage and much of the completion stage. The direct realization of voidness in the tantric path occurs on the fourth level of the completion stage and is called the \"actual clear light\" (don-gyi wosel). This level follows the completion stage levels of body isolation (lu wen), speech isolation (ngak wen), and mind isolation (sem wen), as well as the \"impure\" illusory body (rna dakpey gu IU)."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Clevcnch (}o{P 267 After achieving the actual clear light, you have reached the transcendent path.

The last level is Vajrayogini's supreme state of enlightenment. OFFERINGS TO THE DHARMA PROTECTORS The next section is an offering to Dharma protectors. It is called the \"Wokmin\" offering because the word Wokmin appears at the beginning of the first verse. We have to bless the torma by reciting the following mantra syllables three times: Om Ah Hung Ha Ho Hrihl (3x) When you recite \"Om,\" put the base of your left palm on top of your right fist. Visualize that you are chasing away the bad spirits that hover around the torma. When you recite \"Ah,\" put the base of your right palm on your left fist and meditate that you are dissolving the torma into voidness. When you recite \"Hung,\" raise both palms and touch your hands together at the base of the thumbs. Visualize that you have generated the torma as nectar. Then recite the three syllables \"Ha Ho Hrih\" together and make the garuda gesture. At this time visualize the fourth stage of the blessing, which has three parts known as purifying (jangwa), transforming (tokpa), and magnifying (barwa). Purifying removes all the bad qualities of smell, taste, and so on from the nectar. Transforming means that you dissolve the Buddhas' wisdom into the nectar and turn it into real nectar. Magnifying means the nectar is made inexhaustible. Reciting these mantra syllables three times contains all the elements of the longer ritual for blessing the inner offering.

Once you reach there, you will be able to achieve all the temporary and ultimate goals. Although the Dak-kye recitation allows you to collect a large amount of virtue, you will also collect some bad deeds by the way if you don't do the practice properly.

While you recite the mantra, visualize that white nectar and light rays flow down from the Hung syllable and the Hundred-Syllable Mantra.

Finally, visualize that all the remaining bad deeds you still have gather in your heart in the form of a dark mass. Then visualize that the nectar and light rays flowing from Namnang Heruka's heart cause these bad deeds to disappear immediately into voidness.

Rab dze ji pey ku means her physical form is ma;estic and supremely beautiful. Druk chii yang den means the innate Vajrayogini's speech possesses the sixty qualities of a Buddha's divine speech. Tek chok drok pey sung means this speech proclaims the teachings of the supreme vehicle. This line indicates that Vajrayogini teaches Mahayana tantric Dharma in Kechara Paradise with speech that has sixty excellent qualities. Yeshe ngan-den means the innate Vajrayogini's mind possesses the five ultimate Buddha wisdoms-mirror wisdom, sameness wisdom, discriminating wisdom, performance wisdom, and dharma-sphere wisdom. De sel mi tok tuk means this mind is blissful, luminous, and free of conceptualization. Blissful refers to the great ecstasy of her bliss-voidness wisdom.

The form in which she appeared most often to lamas is the one that we visualize in the Dak-kye ritual, and the way she is described in this verse. Perna ra gey dok tsung Jetsun ma means this exalted one's body is the color of rubies.

We achieve this wisdom by meditating on the generation and completion stage yogas. In particular, we must generate inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom inside the central channel. However, there are many obstacles that keep us from gaining the wisdom that perceives voidness while experiencing great ecstasy. The main obstacles are the ordinary airs and impure substances that travel through the seventy-two thousand channels in the body. These ordinary airs and substances block us from awakening the air and substances inside the central channel. The left and right channels also bind the central channel tightly. Ordinary people can experience air and wind inside the central channel only at the time of death, because that is when the roma and kyangma release their hold on the central channel. But we cannot practice effectively at that time; therefore, it doesn't do us any good to have the central channel released then. We must practice before that time comes in order to clean the seventy-two thousand nerves along with the airs that travel through them. The practice of trying to control the airs and clean the roma and kyangma channels is done so that we can overcome the obstacles that prevent us from generating inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom. Tong trak dun chu tsa nyi tsok nam-kyi means with a host of seventy-two thousand. This refers to the many different kinds of inseparable bliss-voidness wisdom, as well as to the collection of outer dakinis that can be emanated by that wisdom. This verse is a prayer invoking this host of seventy-two thousand to help you remove your obstacles and to grant you their blessings. Drupa po yi bar che kun sel ching means that this host can help a practitioner eliminate his every obstacle. Do don ngo drup tsol wey means they can also grant him the aims he hopes to accomplish along with the spiritual attainments. Tra shi shok means may this good fortune come about. CONCLUSION Those of you who are rookies can ask some more experienced practitioners for help with the individual yogas. Each of these practices should be studied and learned in order, and then meditated on for at least two or three weeks. Wanting to listen to teachings on"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Elcvcnr-h Yoga 293 tape seems to be a characteristic of many of my students. They think, \"I can't go to class today; but that's all right, I can still listen to the tape.\" You reveal your quality when you talk and act like this. Some of you show another characteristic by saying, \"Oh, there is a translation for the first parts of the practice. I can learn them by reading that.\" Still others think, \"I went to a class in New Jersey, but I must have left my notes there. What should I do now? I guess I'll have to start the practice over from the very beginning. Let's see, I could listen to the tapes. I wonder what is written in the translation.\" Or you come to me and say, \"I have a question. May I ask you a question?\" This is improper behavior. You cannot make any progress this way. The Tibetan term sheja is a synonym for any existing entity. It means literally an object of knowledge. All of these practices are kinds of sheja. If you have knowledge of these sheja in your mind, then they themselves will also be in your mind. But if you lack this knowledge, then the objects will also remain beyond your reach. Some of you rookies may have a hard time reciting the Six-Session Guru Yoga (Tun druk) as well as the long Dak-kye. If so, for the time being you can recite the longer version of the Six-Session Guru Yoga and the short Dak-kye. When you come to the Tse-chu ritual, you can recite the long Dak-kye. You should also think about changing your schedule. Instead of going to a party or a movie or a stadium all the time, you should try to reduce these activities a little bit, so that you can increase your practice schedule. After you've practiced the Tun druk for a while, chewed it well and digested it, then you can start to practice the extensive Dak-kye. Buddha taught a great many sutras and tantras. There are over a hundred volumes in the Tibetan Kangyur; but this is only a very small part of what the Buddha taught. We couldn't translate all of them from Sanskrit. In one verse Buddha said: Gelong dak gam ke nam kyi/ Sek che darwey ser shin du/ Lekpar tak Ia nga-yi ka/ Lan~,'War ja yi gii chir min/"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Just as gold is burned, cut, and polished, Monks and scholars should examine well My teaching before they practice it; They should not do so merely out of respect. What this verse also implies is that you must practice what you have been taught. If you don't, then you will be like a sick person who goes to the doctor and receives many prescriptions, goes to a drug store to buy many medicines, and after that, goes home and doesn't take any of them. If a sick person ignores the doctor's advice and doesn't take the proper medicine, there is no way for him to be cured. Similarly, you won't be able to uproot the causes of samsara and cure your sickness of the mental afflictions without practicing this instruction. Now that you have gained an understanding of the instructions, you should also know the four unique causes that help you to achieve the goals of the practice. The first one is to have strong, unshakable faith in your lama, the tutelary deity, and the teachings (de pey chir mi dokpa ). The second is not to have any doubts about the teachings (sherab-kyi te-tsom mi sawa ). This is achieved by having a clear and firm understanding of the entire practice. The third cause is to have one-pointed concentration (yi tse chikpa), which means that you have only one deity as your main practice. For example, in India there was a famous king named Indrabhuti. Both he and his ministers were yogis and yoginis of the Guhyasamaja practice. Ghantapada, Krishnacharya, and Luipa were practitioners of the Chakrasamvara path. Lalitavajra and Amoghavajra practiced only Yamantaka. They all practiced only one tutelary deity. Although these sages practiced a single deity, in the end they could see many deities. They achieved this result because they practiced only with their main deity. Therefore, the best way for you to practice is with this single deity, Vajrayogini. I have already explained the good qualities and advantages of her path. In Tibet some people tried to practice Guhyasamaja because they heard this was the \"king of tantric deities.\" Later they tried to practice Chakrasamvara or some other deity. They tried to receive teachings on many deities' practices, but they couldn't achieve the result of seeing any of the deities directly. We have a Tibetan"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Clc:vc:nch ljogd 295 expression: Bo hla gya drup Ia hla chik mi tong, which means \"Tibetans practice a hundred deities, but do not see a single one.\" This isn't just an idle saying; it contains the important instruction that if you practice only one deity with single-minded concentration you will achieve the spiritual goals. The fourth cause is to keep your practice very secret (shin tu sangwa ). You must also keep all the meanings you learned during the initiation and teachings very secret. These are the four unique causes for achieving the spiritual goals (ngodrup drupey gyu tun mong rna yin pa shi). Gaining them will help you to succeed in your practice. I have explained them here because they are extremely important to know. If you practice the instruction and begin to show good colors and shapes, and gain good results, I will be very, very happy."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY TIBETAN TO ENGLISH Phonetic Tibetan English Tibetan Meaning bakchak ~ seeds;
