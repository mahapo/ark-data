Shortly before heleft this world, he shared his extensive experience of Buddhist practice withhis disciples in a series of instructions, the Eighty Chapters of PersonalAdvice. Beginning with basic topics such as faith, impermanence, andrenunciation, these simple yet profound instructions cover the path of thethree trainings—discipline, concentration, and wisdom—and culminatein the extraordinary view, meditation, and activity of the Great Perfection.Our teacher Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who was a living embodiment ofthe path that Zurchungpa describes, gave this teaching to a group of prac-titioners in retreat to be used as an aid for their practice, basing his expla-nation on a commentary on Zurchungpa’s text by his own teacher, ShechenGyaltsap Rinpoche.I am delighted that it will now be available to a wider public, and I amsure that all those who sincerely put this teaching into practice will deriveenormous benefit, both for themselves and for anyone whom theyencounter.Jigme KhyentseDordogne 2006.Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xvi"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Translators’ Introduction^4$)))00@4200)))446A notable feature of Tibetan Buddhist literature is the number of pithyand easily memorized texts that condense the classical teachings into prac-tical instruction manuals. Often cryptic in style, they provide the practi-tioner with keys that serve as reminders opening up a complete range ofteachings to be put into practice. Garab Dorje’s Hitting the Essence in ThreePoints, Atisha’s Seven-Point Mind Training, Gyalse Thogme’s Thirty-sevenPractices of the Bodhisattva, and Padampa Sangye’s Hundred Verses ofAdviceare just a few examples of such works that have become importantclassics in their own right.Less well known is Zurchung Sherab Trakpa’s Eighty Chapters of PersonalAdvice(zhal gdams brgyad bcu pa)—personal not only because they repre-sent the distillation of a lifetime’s experience of practice by a highly accom-plished master, but also because they answer the needs of individualpractitioners at different stages of the path. Each chapter deals with a par-ticular topic and contains between three and thirty-four single-sentenceinstructions.The Vajrayana teachings brought to Tibet by Padmasambhava, Vimala-mitra, and other masters in the eighth century AD have come down to usby means of two kinds of lineal transmission: the short lineage of the treas-ures (terma), which were hidden by these great teachers and later rediscov-ered by the emanations of their disciples; and the long lineage of oraltransmission (kama), in which the teachings have been transmitted frommaster to disciple until the present day. The early masters of this kamalin-eage belonged principally to four families, namely the So, Zur, Nub, andNyak clans, and of these, the Zur family is noted for three outstanding mas-ters: Zurpoche Shakya Jungne (the Great Zur), his uncle’s grandsonZurchung Sherab Trakpa (the Little Zur), and Zurchungpa’s own son, ZurDropukpa Sakya Senge. These three masters of the Zur lineage had suchmastery over mind and matter that, to judge from His Holiness DudjomZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rinpoche’s account in his History of the Nyingma School,1there was no dis-tinction in their lives between the miraculous and the everyday. We read ofthem levitating, walking on water, flying through the air on the rays of thesun, passing through rock, lengthening a temple pillar that was too short,and performing numerous other feats. When, after a year-long retreat,Zurpoche performed a tantric dance, his foot sank up to the ankle in a rock.Zurchungpa, prostrating to the footprint of his guru, left the imprint of hisown topknot and dangling earrings.Nowadays, with the abundant use of special effects in cinema and tele-vision playing to our fascination with the supernatural, it is all too easy forus to be dazzled by the Zur masters’ superhuman lifestyles and to forgetthat their miraculous displays resulted from years of genuine spiritualendeavor. They were fully enlightened beings who had completely tran-scended the feats they displayed. Their stories are intended to serve as inspi-rational models, and from reading them we can learn how to follow in theirfootsteps. In particular Zurchungpa’s life story teaches us two things: thathe earned his extraordinary degree of spiritual attainment by carrying outevery one of his teacher’s instructions to the letter; and that everything hedid, however spectacular, was simply a manifestation of his enlightenedactivity for the sake of beings. His flying through the air, for example,enabled him to travel long distances swiftly and thus give three sessions ofteaching in one day, each in a remote location many tens of miles from thelast. His sole purpose in this was to benefit beings and spread the teachingsmore expeditiously. And although such impressive feats undoubtedlyinspired devotion in his disciples, enabling them to receive blessings andprogress on the path, he never used them in order to become famous.✦✦Zurchung Sherab Trakpa (1014-1074) ✦✦Zurchung Sherab Trakpa was born to the accompaniment of wondroussigns. He learned to read and write in his seventh year, and in his ninth yearhe learned to chant the ritual of the peaceful and wrathful deities. A dis-agreement with his fiancée in his thirteenth year upset him deeply, and heleft home determined to meet Zurpoche Shakya Jungne and to devote hislife to practicing the Dharma. When he arrived, Zurpoche asked him whatclan he came from. Not daring to admit that he was the Guru’s secondcousin, Zurchungpa replied “I am just a very small Zur (zur chung).” Thename stuck.

Through his total devotion to Zurpoche, and by studying andpracticing day and night in remote hermitages, he attained an extraordi-nary level of realization. Although he resolved to remain for twenty-fouryears in continuous retreat at the hermitage Zurpoche had given him atMount Trak Gyawo, he was obliged for two main reasons to break hisretreat after thirteen years, and was therefore prevented from actuallyattaining the rainbow light body—the ultimate accomplishment of theGreat Perfection, where the practitioner’s body dissolves into light. Thefirst reason was that his attendant disturbed him during a long period ofsolitary practice: seeing that his master’s mouth and nose were coveredwith cobwebs and thinking that he had passed away, he cried out loud andbroke Zurchungpa’s concentration. The second reason was that his activepresence was required in order to ensure the preservation of the teachings.Zurchungpa was famed and respected not only by Nyingmapas but alsoby followers of the New Tradition. On one occasion a geshe well-versed indialectics sent his student to challenge Zurchungpa to a debate. “Let thispillar be the topic of debate,” he declared. Zurchungpa accepted by pass-ing his hand through the pillar, to the astonishment of the student, whosubsequently became his disciple. Not that Zurchungpa lacked the neces-sary dialectical skills to defeat his opponents. His debate with four otherssent by another geshe was carried out more on their terms, but it was soonover: his replies to their questions left them with no hope of a rejoinder.They later became his four principal disciples.The epoch of these three Zur masters was a golden age for the Mantra-yana. At that time, these teachings were only given to carefully selected dis-ciples, who then devoted themselves to intensive practice, following theirteachers’ instructions to the letter and thereby attaining the highest accom-plishment. By the nineteenth century, these secret teachings were muchmore widely taught, to the extent that Patrul Rinpoche could write (inThe Words of My Perfect Teacher), “In Tibet these days there cannot be asingle lama, monk, layman, or laywoman who has never received anempowerment.” As a result, the teachings began to lose their subtle forceand directness, and the proportion of tantric practitioners who attainedaccomplishment declined over the centuries.

And a considerable number of mas-ters of the Great Perfection passed away to the accompaniment of sounds,light, earthquakes, and other remarkable phenomena, dissolving most oftheir bodies into light and leaving remains which, when cremated, yieldedringseland other extraordinary relics. One such master was Shechen Gyal-tsap Pema Gyurme Namgyal, on whose annotated edition of Zurchungpa’sEighty ChaptersDilgo Khyentse Rinpoche based his commentary.✦✦Shechen Gyaltsap Pema Gyurme Namgyal (1871-1926)✦✦Shechen Gyaltsap, also known as Jamyang Lodrö Gyamtso Drayang, thename by which he refers to himself in the colophon of the present text, wasthe heart-son of Ju Mipham Namgyal Rinpoche (1846-1912) and waslargely responsible, with Khenchen Kunzang Pelden (c.1870-c.1940), forcontinuing Mipham Rinpoche’s teaching tradition. He studied with thegreatest teachers of his day, including Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892), from whom he received teachings on the present text, and JamgönKongtrul Lodrö Thaye (1813-1899). He was undoubtedly one of the mostlearned lamas of his time, and his collected writings fill thirteen volumes,which include an extensive commentary on Atisha’s Seven-Point MindTraining, a detailed explanation of the preliminary practice, and a treatiseon the nine vehicles. He was also one of the most accomplished practition-ers. He once completed what was intended to be a three-year retreat in onlythree months and left the imprint of his foot in a rock at the entrance tohis hermitage. It is said that when Shechen Gyaltsap’s body was cremated,it vanished without a trace, and that where the smoke settled on the leavesin the surrounding countryside, crystal relics were found.Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche was the first of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche’sprincipal teachers, for it was he who recognized and enthroned him as theincarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo’s mind. His many disciplesincluded Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo’s activity emanation, DzongsarKhyentse Chökyi Lodrö (1896-1959), who was also one of Dilgo KhyentseRinpoche’s most important teachers.xx/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xx"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"✦✦Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910-1991)2✦✦Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche was one of the last of the generation ofgreat lamas who completed their education and training in Tibet. He wasthe senior lama of the ancient Nyingma tradition, the guru of the royalfamily of Bhutan, and an outstanding upholder of the Practice lineage,having spent twenty-two years of his life meditating in retreat and accom-plishing the fruits of the many teachings he had received.He also composed numerous poems, meditation texts, and commen-taries—twenty-five volumes in all—and was a tertön, a discoverer of spir-itual treasures, whose visionary revelations bring Padmasambhava’sprofound oral pith instructions directly to us. Renowned for his ability totransmit the teachings of each Buddhist lineage according to its own tra-dition, he was the exemplary exponent of Tibet’s Rime, or nonsectarian,movement and the venerated teacher of many lamas of the four majorTibetan schools. He was also one of the leading masters of the pith instruc-tions of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, and one of the principal holdersof the Longchen Nyingtik tradition. His Holiness the Dalai Lama has saidthat he regards Khyentse Rinpoche as his principal Dzogchen teacher.Scholar, sage, and poet, Rinpoche never ceased to inspire all whoencountered him through his extraordinary presence, simplicity, dignity,and humor.Khyentse Rinpoche was born in 1910in East Tibet’s Denkhok Valley. Hisfamily descended from the royal lineage of the ninth-century king TrisongDetsen; his father was a minister to the king of Derge. When still in hismother’s womb, he was recognized as an extraordinary incarnation by theillustrious Mipham Rinpoche, who later named the infant Tashi Paljor andbestowed a special blessing and Mañjushri empowerment upon him.Even as a little boy, Rinpoche manifested a strong desire to devote him-self entirely to the religious life. But his father had other ideas. His two eldersons had already left home to pursue monastic careers; one had been rec-ognized as an incarnate lama and the other wanted to become a doctor.Rinpoche’s father hoped that his youngest son would follow in his ownfootsteps and manage the extensive family estates, and he could not acceptthat he might also be a tulku, or incarnate lama, as had been indicated byseveral learned masters.At the age of ten, the boy was taken severely ill; he was bedridden for nearlytranslators’introduction /xxiZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xxi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"a year. Knowledgeable lamas advised that unless he was allowed to embracethe spiritual life he would not live long. Yielding to everyone’s entreaties, hisfather agreed that the child could follow his own aspirations in order to ful-fill his destiny. Thus it was that, aged eleven, he entered Shechen Monasteryin Kham, East Tibet, one of the six principal monasteries of the NyingmaSchool. There, his root guru, Shechen Gyaltsap, Mipham Rinpoche’sDharma heir, formally recognized and enthroned him as an incarnation ofthe wisdom-mind of the first Khyentse Rinpoche, Jamyang KhyentseWangpo, the peerless lama who—along with the first Jamgön Kongtrul—set in motion a Buddhist renaissance throughout Tibet. All contemporaryTibetan masters draw inspiration and blessings from this movement.Khyen-tsemeans wisdom and love. The Khyentse tulkusare incarnationsof several key figures in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. These in -clude Longchenpa, the brilliant fourteenth-century Dzogchen master whoseprolific writings illuminate the entire range of Buddhist knowledge; JigmeLingpa, who in the eighteenth century founded the Longchen Nyingtik tra-dition; and King Trisong Detsen and Vimalamitra who along with Guru Rin-poche brought tantric Buddhism to Tibet in the ninth century.At Shechen, Khyentse Rinpoche spent much of his time studying andmeditating with his root guru in a hermitage above the monastery. Dur-ing this time Shechen Gyaltsap gave him all the essential empowermentsand instructions of the Nyingma tradition. Rinpoche also studied withmany other great masters, including the renowned Dzogchen KhenpoShenga, who imparted to him his own major work, The Thirteen GreatCommentaries. He received extensive teachings and transmissions frommore than fifty teachers in all.Before Shechen Gyaltsap passed away, Khyentse Rinpoche, then aged fif-teen, promised his beloved master that he would unstintingly teach who-ever asked him for Dharma. From then until he was twenty-eight, he spentmost of his time meditating in silent retreat, living in isolated hermitagesand caves or simply under the shelter of overhanging rocks in the moun-tainous countryside near his birthplace. His mastery of the mystic heat(tummo) practice was such that the inside of his cave was warm even dur-ing the icy Tibetan winters. He also left the imprint of his foot in a rockbelow one of his hermitages.Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche later spent many years with DzongsarKhyentse Chökyi Lodrö (1896-1959), who was also an incarnation of thefirst Khyentse. After receiving from Chökyi Lodrö the many empower-xxii/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xxii"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ments of the Rinchen Terdzö, the collection of Revealed Treasures (ter-mas), Rinpoche told him he wished to spend the rest of his life in solitarymeditation. But Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö’s answer was, “The time has comefor you to teach and transmit to others the countless precious teachingsyou have received.” From then on, Rinpoche worked constantly for thebenefit of beings with the tireless energy that is the hallmark of theKhyentse lineage.During the 1970s and ’80s, despite his age, Khyentse Rinpoche travelledall over the Himalayas, India, Southeast Asia, and the West transmittingand explaining the teachings to his many disciples. He was often accom-panied by his wife, Sangyum Lhamo, and his grandson and spiritual heir,Rabjam Rinpoche.Wherever he was, he used to rise well before dawn, praying and medi-tating for several hours before embarking on an uninterrupted flow ofactivities until late into the night. He accomplished a tremendous work-load with total serenity and apparent effortlessness.Rinpoche made three visits to Tibet between 1985and 1990. There, heinaugurated the rebuilding of the original Shechen Monastery, destroyedduring the Cultural Revolution, and oversaw the restoration of SamyeMonastery, which he consecrated in 1990.In Nepal, Khyentse Rinpoche transplanted the rich Shechen tradition toa new home—a magnificent monastery in front of the great stupa of Boud-hanath. This became his principal seat, housing a large community ofmonks, led by their abbot Rabjam Rinpoche. It was Khyentse Rinpoche’sparticular wish that this should be a place where the Buddhist teachingswould be continued in their pristine purity, just as they were previouslystudied and practiced in Tibet, and he invested enormous care in the edu-cation of the promising young lamas capable of continuing the tradition.Other projects dear to him included the building of stupas and monas-teries in sacred places, which he said would help promote world peace, fur-ther Buddhist values and practice, and help avert conflict, disease, andfamine. In India, he built a new stupa at Bodhgaya, the site of ShakyamuniBuddha’s enlightenment beneath the Bodhi Tree. Preserving Tibet’s ex -traordinary heritage of Buddhist literature was particularly important tohim. After the systematic destruction of books and libraries in Tibet by theChinese, many works existed in only one or two copies. Thanks to KhyentseRinpoche’s efforts, almost three hundred volumes of texts that might oth-erwise have been lost forever have been published.translators’introduction /xxiiiZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xxiii"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Through his extensive enlightened activity, Khyentse Rinpoche unspar-ingly devoted his entire life to the preservation and dissemination of theBuddha Dharma. His greatest satisfaction was to see the Dharma actuallypracticed.He made a number of teaching visits to the West during the last fifteenyears of his life, including two North American tours. At his European seat,Shechen Tennyi Dargyeling in Dordogne, France, where people from allover the world received extensive teaching from him, he guided severalgroups of students in traditional three-year retreats. It is a measure of hiscontribution to establishing Tibetan Buddhism in the West that no fewerthan five hundred disciples from Europe and North America attended hiscremation in Bhutan in 1992.No factual account of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche’s life can fully conveywho he was. Those who had the immense fortune to spend any time withhim knew they were in the presence of an authentic living Buddha, for hecompletely embodied the teachings he propagated and the great spiritualmasters whose lineages he held. Even strangers were profoundly touchedby his presence and instinctively sensed his exceptional humanity and spir-itual qualities. His whole life was a true continuation of the lineage thathad come down to him through Zurchung Sherab Trakpa and ShechenGyaltsap Rinpoche, and which he passes on to us in this teaching on theEighty Chapters of Personal Advice.✦✦Zurchungpa’s Eighty Chapters of Personal Advice ✦✦The Eighty Chapterswere Zurchungpa’s last teaching, the testament he gaveto his disciples before passing away. It is hardly surprising, then, that heconcerns himself exclusively with practice, and although a few of hisinstructions assume some basic theoretical knowledge of such topics as thefive aggregates, the eight consciousnesses, the ten actions, and so on, theemphasis is on how to put such knowledge into practice. There is little herethat has not been written elsewhere, but that is not to say that Zurchungpa’stext lacks originality. What is striking about his presentation of the GreatPerfection is that while he often appears to repeat himself, he shifts slightlyeach time, lending contrast and perspective to the teaching and adaptinghis angle to the particular needs and intellectual capacities of his individ-ual students.xxiv/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xxiv"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Eighty Chaptersare divided into five main sections. The first of theseis a short introductory section on faith and devotion, which are essentialqualities for anyone who wishes to understand the teachings and put theminto practice. This is particularly true in the Mantrayana, where realizationdepends on being open to the teacher’s blessings. The bulk of the text com-prises three main sections, each dealing with one of the Three Trainings,which encapsulate the whole of the Buddha’s teaching—discipline, con-centration, and wisdom. The training in discipline, for Zurchungpa, is notmerely a question of observing lists of do’s and don’ts. While these thingsare certainly important, for him the essential point is to create circum-stances that will help inner realization to blossom and to avoid those thatwill hinder such realization. A sincere desire to get out of samsara, a con-stant awareness of impermanence, and a vigilant mind are more impor-tant to him than the wearing of monastic robes. The section on the trainingin concentration deals not so much with how to concentrate, but ratherwith how to undistractedly keep in mind the view of the Great Perfection.And the realization of that view is the subject of the section on the train-ing in wisdom. These are exceptionally profound instructions that need tobe repeatedly heard from a qualified master. Some readers may find thelater chapters difficult to understand, but those who have already receivedsome “mind” teachings will hopefully be able to use these chapters asreminders that help to deepen their practice and understanding. The fifthand final section contains a single chapter summarizing the whole text.On their own, even the most approachable instructions in the EightyChaptersare not always immediately comprehensible. While it does notrequire a great deal of imagination to guess why “faith is like a wishing-gem,” as we read in the second chapter, Zurchungpa’s incitement in theforty-ninth chapter to “always strip naked” and to “commit suicide” callsfor some explanation, as does “‘slander the yidam” in Chapter Twenty. Thisis why Shechen Gyaltsap Rinpoche intercalated the lines of Zurchungpa’soriginal text with his own notes, usually in the form of a short sentence foreach instruction. In some cases he merely inserted a qualifying word orphrase; in others he found it useful to add one or more paragraphs. He alsoincluded a structural outline based on the teachings that JamyangKhyentse Wangpo had given him on this text and on a detailed commen-tary, which unfortunately we have been unable identify.

In the earlier sections, these different elements (root text,notes, and commentary) mostly appear separately, though they must beread together; in the later chapters, they are largely intermingled.✦✦The History of This Teaching✦✦In the summer of 1986, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche made one of his regularvisits to the Dordogne in France, during which he gave a series of teach-ings to the three-year retreatants at Chanteloube, who had just completedthe preliminary practices and were starting the “main” practice of the sad-hanas and mantra recitations. The teachings he gave therefore includednumerous empowerments, along with the oral transmission of a numberof important texts, including some by his root teacher, Shechen GyaltsapRinpoche. In particular he gave a detailed teaching on the latter’s anno-tated edition of Zurchungpa’s Eighty Chapters of Personal Advice, which hebegan by telling us, “While it is very important to receive empowermentsto mature one’s being, as we are engaged in practice it is also crucial to havethe liberating instructions—the explanations on the practice. I will there-fore give an explanation of these few pieces of spiritual advice.”We mention the background of this teaching not merely for historicalinterest but because it is important for readers to understand KhyentseRinpoche’s teaching within the context in which it was given. Zurchungpa’stext contains profound instructions that will be difficult to put into prac-tice effectively without first having received the necessary empowermentsand blessings from a qualified teacher. Although times have changed andthe Dzogchen teachings are given more openly than they were a thousand,or even fifty, years ago, it is certainly no less true that progress in the prac-tice of Dzogchen depends exclusively on the blessings of the lama. Read-ers who wish to get the most out of Zurchungpa’s advice need to use ithand-in-hand with the guidance of their own teacher.Khyentse Rinpoche’s manner of teaching consisted of reading the text—that is, Zurchungpa’s root text and Shechen Gyaltsap’s notes—interspersedwith his own oral commentary. In some of the later chapters especially, hegave little or no commentary and read out the text on its own. Many ofthese sections consist of so-called pith instructions, seemingly simplephrases used by the enlightened masters of the Great Perfection to conveytheir profound realization to individual disciples, in quite specific situa-xxvi/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page xxvi"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"tions. The words they used, often in relatively nontechnical language, weretools used as a support for transmitting ideas that completely transcendedthe literal meaning of the words themselves. The impact of these oralinstructions is naturally lessened when they are confined to the printedpage. And they are diluted even further in the process of being translatedinto English (with the syntactical constraints that translation implies andthe possibility of errors in the interpretation of their stylistic peculiarities)by individuals whose spiritual realization could never begin to match thatof the original authors.Khyentse Rinpoche gave this teaching in Tibetan, and it was fromrecorded tapes that Matthieu Ricard subsequently made an oral transla-tion for the benefit of the Chanteloube retreatants. The recording of thistranslation was then transcribed. Later the transcription was edited and afresh translation was made of Shechen Gyaltsap’s original text. Two edi-tions were used. One was published by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche atShechen Monastery in Nepal and was the edition he taught from. The otherwas a photocopy made by Matthieu Ricard of an original woodblock edi-tion brought back in 1989from Shechen Monastery in Tibet. Both editionscontain mistakes, but since the Nepalese edition omits some words andeven whole sentences present in the woodblock edition, we have generallytaken the latter as the more reliable and have done our best to incorporatethe corrections into our translation.A text of this sort contains much repetition of technical terms such as“absolute nature” and “unborn.” For stylistic reasons we have occasionallyused synonyms for some of these words. These and other technical termsare briefly explained in the Glossary. A deeper understanding of many ofthem may be obtained by reading books dealing with the graded path (lamrim), in particular Jigme Lingpa’s Treasury of Precious Qualities, Patrul Rin-poche’s The Words of My Perfect Teacher, and Gampopa’s Jewel Ornamentof Liberation.Many of the points that Khyentse Rinpoche mentions in his teachingwould have been impossible to index satisfactorily, and we have thereforeattempted to summarize them thematically in the Table of Contents.

I shall explain all I know of it.The most important thing when one is practicing in retreat is to developa feeling of disillusionment with samsara so that one can progress on thepath, and for this one needs to receive the pith instructions for the path.Here then are these instructions, set out clearly and concisely, for thoseZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:46 PM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"who have been through the preliminary practice properly and are nowdoing the main practice.✦✦ The Text ✦✦The text begins with homage:NAMO RATNA GURU BHYANAMO means “homage” or “obeisance.” RATNA is “jewel” or “rare andsupreme.”4GURU is “the Teacher.” BHYA5indicates the action of payinghomage. It therefore means:I pay homage to the precious Teacher.The text opens by saying:6Bowing down to the teacher who is Vajrasattva in reality,I shall thread a Necklace of Jewels,7The Eighty Chapters of Personal AdviceLaid out in detail with a structural outline—A treasury of gems of the three trainings.This is a homage to Zurchung Sherab Trakpa, who was someone whohad completely renounced wordly affairs and become a fully enlightenedsiddha. He was in no way different from Vajrasattva, so it is to him thathomage is paid.What do we mean by the three trainings? Whether we practice the sutrasor tantras, we cannot avoid going through the trainings of discipline, con-centration, and wisdom. As Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye himself saidwhen he wrote his vast treatise known as the Treasury of Knowledge, every-thing contained in this encyclopedia is included in the three trainings. Thetext we are studying now is like a treasury of jewels that condenses the mostprecious points of the three trainings. It includes many pieces of advice,arranged in eighty chapters. And in the same way that one makes a neck-lace by threading the jewels one after another, the author is now going topresent this text in full.The Buddha, having considered the various mental capacities of sentient beings,4/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"As far as the Buddha himself is concerned, only the teachings of the ultimate meaning are necessary: he does not need to teach the expedientmeaning. But as far as sentient beings are concerned, different kinds ofteaching are necessary to suit their various mental capacities, whethermodest, middling, or exceptional. Some beings have very vast minds; theycan understand the most profound and vast teachings. Some have less openminds, and others are extremely narrow-minded. There are thus teachingsfor all levels—the Great Vehicle, the Basic Vehicle, and so forth—that theBuddha has taught according to beings’ ability to understand and assimi-late them. However elementary or essentialized such teachings may be,their purpose in all cases is to set beings on the path to liberation, and thefinal destination is the same irrespective of the point of departure.Take the example of a mother feeding her baby. She starts by giving onlymilk, which is very easy for the newborn baby to take. If she were to givesolid food, the infant would not even be able to swallow it, let alone digestit. But when the child grows a little bigger, it can start having slightly moresolid food like the three white foods and the three sweet foods, yogurt, andso on. Then gradually, as it grows bigger, it is able to eat solid food of allkinds.Similarly, the Buddha has given the teaching in stages covering the wholepath of the sutras and tantras. He first gave the teachings for beings on theShravaka level and the teachings for the Pratyekabuddhas. Then, for thosebeings who have a vaster mind he gave the Mahayana teachings. That is notto say that there are fundamental differences in the way the Buddha him-self taught: his teaching can, rather, be likened to falling rain. When rainfalls from the sky, it falls in exactly the same way over the whole land, butwhat the water becomes when it reaches the ground depends on the kindof container into which it falls. If it falls on a lake with very pure water, therainwater will remain as it is, very pure and transparent. If it falls into adirty pit or muddy pool, it will take on the color and appearance of the dirtor mud. In the same way, although the mind of the Buddha alwaysexpresses the ultimate truth, depending on the level of the beings receiv-ing his teachings he set forth the absolute truth on a variety of levels, whichwe term “vehicles.” This is why hetaught the various vehicles of the Dharma.According to the Nyingma tradition there are nine such vehicles—threelesser vehicles, three intermediate ones, and three higher ones.

Deshek Gyawoparefers to Zurchung SherabTrakpa, the teacher who is one with the Buddha, and means “the Sugatawho dwells in Gyawo.” What did he do? He carefully studied all the teach-ings of the sutras and tantras in the same way that one prepares wool forweaving by teasing it and fluffing it out, removing the bits of grass andother dirt in it.He churned the milk of the Three Pitakas.If you churn milk thoroughly for a long time, you get butter; by churn-ing curd you obtain cheese and whey. In the same way, by going over themeaning of the instructions in the Three Pitakas—the Vinaya, Sutras, andAbhidharma—again and again, Deshek Gyawopa extracted the quintes-sence of the teachings, like butter from milk.He drank the words of the learned ones like water.The Dharma was originally introduced to Tibet from the supreme landof India. The great panditas from India were invited to Tibet, and togetherwith the Tibetan translators they translated the scriptures from Sanskritinto Tibetan. According to the teachings of the Ancient Tradition, althoughthe great panditas like the Abbot Shantarakshita and the great translatorsappeared in human form, they were not in any way ordinary people; theywere fully realized beings. Translators like Vairotsana, Chogro Lui Gyaltsen,and Kawa Paltsek were emanations of Ananda and other close disciples ofthe Buddha who took rebirth in Tibet in order to spread the teachings.Guru Rinpoche himself used to say such-and-such a translator was thereincarnation of such-and-such an Indian pandita. So they were not likeordinary translators, they were not ordinary beings. They had full realiza-tion of the whole of the Dharma and their minds became inseparable fromGuru Rinpoche’s wisdom mind. Thus it was that in the inconceivable,spontaneously accomplished temple of Samye, at the request of KingTrisong Detsen, who turned all his wealth into gold and offered full meas-6/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ures of gold each time he requested the teaching, the great panditas headedby Guru Rinpoche and Vimalamitra, and the great translators headed byVairotsana, translated the scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan. ThroughGuru Rinpoche’s blessings, the works translated included not only wellknown texts from India but also hitherto unknown teachings that had beenkept as treasures by the dakinis. This is a special feature of the Nyingmatradition.At a later period, the translator Ngok Loden Sherab8travelled to India,where he worked on a translation of the Ornament of the Sutras. In this hecame across a passage where the word “to be attached” occurs three timestogether. Wondering how he could translate the same word three times, heconsulted Vairotsana’s old translation and found that Vairotsana had trans-lated it as referring to the three tenses, past, present, and future,9with thesense of “hesitation.”10The passage actually meant “there is no hesitationin the past, present, or future.” When he saw this, Loden Sherab becamefully confident that the ancient translators were true Buddhas and praisedthem, saying,Vairotsana is like the sky,Ka and Chog are like the sun and moon,Rinchen Zangpo is like the morning star,And I myself am like a firefly.He explained this as follows. Vairotsana’s knowledge and wisdom are sovast that he is like the sky. Kawa Paltsek and Chogro Lui Gyaltsen are likethe sun and the moon. Rinchen Zangpo,11who is without peer among allthe translators of the New Translation tradition, is like the morning star,meaning Venus, which shines very brightly at dawn. And he himself, hesaid, had been given the title lotsawa,12but counted for no more than oneof the fireflies one sees on a summer night.Nowadays we can go to India very quickly and easily, but in the days ofthe great translators it was much more difficult. They had to travel on foot,carrying all their belongings on their backs and enduring the heat andnumerous dangers on the way. Once they had arrived in India, in order tostudy with the panditas translators had to obtain permission from the localkings, who in those days were very jealous and unwilling to let others studythe precious teachings, employing guards to prevent these teachings frombeing taken away to Tibet.Vairotsana, for instance, went to India for the first time at the age of thir-introduction /7Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"teen, and we can read in his life story of the immense difficulties and hard-ships he had to go through to receive the teachings. The translators visitednot only Bodhgaya but also all the great universities and seats of learninglike Vikramashila and Nalanda, where there might have been five hundredor a thousand panditas. Very few of these panditas, however, were panditasof the Mahayana, and of these even more rare were panditas versed in theSecret Mantrayana. Moreover it was by no means easy for the translatorsto make inquiries in the local language to find out which panditas mightbe holders of the secret pith instructions. It was only through his own clair-voyance and the blessing and predictions of protectors such as Ekajati thatVairotsana was able to know which teachings to look for and find the pan-ditas who held them. The translators of the New Translations also had toendure great hardships in order to receive the teachings, as we can see inthe life story of the great translator Marpa, who travelled three times toIndia and four times to Nepal, each time carrying everything on his back.He savored the realization and experience of former masters like salt.Just as adding salt to food improves its taste, Zurchung Sherab Trakpasavored the pith instructions of the previous lineage masters, their pro-found wisdom and understanding, their experience and realization; andhis hearing, reflecting, and meditating on the teachings was like adding saltto the teachings themselves.Looking at appearances as in a mirror,—meaning that he looked at the appearances of samsara and nirvana as iflooking at reflections in a mirror, beautiful or ugly—he saw that whatever one does there is nothing but suffering.In the three worlds of samsara, whatever one does with one’s body,speech, and mind, it is only the cause of suffering. This means that anysamsaric action13is the cause of suffering. At present we can eat good food,wear nice clothes, and have a comfortable place to stay, and we feel this isquite a happy situation. But to obtain that, we have in fact done nothingbut accumulate negative actions, which are the cause of future suffering.From the moment we are born from our mother’s womb, we cannot butset off in the direction of death. Then, when we finally meet with death,even if we are very powerful, we cannot influence death; however rich weare, we cannot bribe death; however beautiful we are, we cannot seduce it.8/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Look at the ordinary activities of beings in samsara: they are involved inprotecting those who are dear to them, in getting the better of those whoare not dear to them, in ploughing fields and conducting business andtrade. If you examine all these actions, they are all linked with negativity.There is hardly anything in them that is virtuous. Acting only in this neg-ative way is like eating food mixed with poison: it may taste delicious at thetime, but it will have deadly consequences.Therefore,He saw that the concerns of this world are to be given up.He saw that it is better to completely give up all one’s endless plans andprojects that involve thinking, “If I do this or that, in the future I will beable to enjoy good food, have good clothes, and be in such-and-such apleasurable situation.”He saw that besides accomplishing something meaningful for future lives, nothing is of any use.Why? Because there is not a single being born who will not die. Andthere is not a single being who dies and does not take another rebirth.When we leave this life, however rich we are, we cannot take even a hand-ful of food. Though we may have many fine clothes, we cannot take a sin-gle thread of them. Even this body, which we have cherished so much, wewill have to leave behind as a corpse. What we cannot avoid taking is theburden of our positive and negative actions. After we have crossed thethreshold of death with this burden, the place in which we will find our-selves will not be somewhere pleasant and agreeable where we can feelcomfortable and relaxed. It will be like coming to a huge plain, a place ofcomplete desolation in which we do not know where we are or where wecan go. We will be like a small child that is too young to walk, abandonedin the middle of a vast plain, where it will either die or be eaten by wild ani-mals. Each and every one of us will end up in this situation, with this fear.But we remain blind to it. We cannot see it coming. We cannot see beyondthis present life and spend our time complaining about our house, ourfood, and our possessions. We think that keeping our friends and gettingrid of our enemies is the most important thing. But actually it only bringsus harm. That is why the text continues,He saw that status and fame have to be thrown away like spit and snot.introduction /9Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Some individuals become very famous, and people say of them, “Theyare very learned, they are very powerful, they are very clever.” But whendeath comes, it will be of no use to them. They will be obliged to give upall their fame and wealth, discarding it like snot without being able to askthemselves, “Should I keep it or should I throw it away?”He saw the need to rid himself of retinue and bustle—for it is hard to make everyone happy—and to meditate alone.In ordinary life we are always having to concern ourselves with otherpeople. If we have a family, wife, husband, and children, we are concernedwith what will happen to them; we have to do everything to protect them,to ensure that they prosper. This involves endless activity, and in theprocess our entire human life runs its course. We never ask ourselveswhether all this will be truly useful or whether it will do us harm in thefuture. We should now see that these things are, in fact, a disturbance, andjust as we would wish to get rid of an enemy, we should want to get rid ofthese distracting conditions. If someone were to be hostile to our childrenor other members of our family, for example, we would think only of howto get rid of him, and even imagine using violence or killing him. But intruth there is no way one can subdue all one’s enemies, and there is no endto the number of enemies one can have. The only way is to completely giveup all these worldly concerns. One needs to go to a secluded place, a lonelymountain retreat, and turning one’s thoughts inward, to work hard at put-ting the teachings into practice.Deshek Gyawopa saw this, and he therefore went to the place known asTrak Gyawo, as we can read in the account of his life in the History of theNyingma School.14At Trak Gyawo he practiced intensively15throughout his life, just as Milarepa did. As a result of his practice, heachieved realization for himself and for others, and opened the way forspreading the teachings of the Ancient Tradition, expressing his full real-ization in the form of spontaneous spiritual advice for beings of the future:He himself made a living experience of these Eighty Chapters of Per-sonal Adviceon how to practice the whole of the Dharma.These are oral instructions that essentialize all the Buddha’s own wordsand the commentaries on them, which are extremely vast and difficult to10/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"understand. They are presented in a way that is easy to assimilate, like foodthat a child can digest, and are given directly into our hands, in the formof eighty pieces of advice. They are not empty utterances, but instructionsthat he himself followed. As he said, the reason he was able to get out ofsamsara, the ocean of suffering, and attain the level of Vidyadhara, takinga place on the seat of enlightenment, was that he practiced instructions likethese.For those who fear birth and death, this is a practice for today.There are two great sources of fear in samsara, the moment of birth andthe moment of death. The suffering and fear experienced at these twotimes have to be faced completely alone; there is no one who can really helpus. The only thing that can help alleviate those sufferings is the practice ofthe supreme Dharma. Nothing else can do so. But we do not know how topractice it: we have only become clever at doing worldly things. From anearly age we have learned how to make things comfortable for ourselvesand how to avoid being uncomfortable. This sort of attitude has resultedin a high degree of material achievement. We can fly through the sky in air-planes, and so on, and we have made life very easy from the material pointof view. But actually we are just like children running after a rainbow.These things do not really help us. We need to turn our minds toward theDharma by reflecting on these sufferings of birth and death. By doing so,we enter the path, going first through the preliminaries, and then proceed-ing to the main practice. As we practice, we will gradually get a true tasteof what it means to become disillusioned with worldly affairs and toprogress on the path. This is something that will come with experience.But we must not postpone it, thinking, “I will do this practice next monthor next year . . . .” If we have received a teaching today, it is today that weshould start putting it into practice, for it is only from the moment weactually plant a seed that it will start to sprout.He gave this as a spontaneous teaching, out of love, as direct heartfelt advice.Deshek Gyawopa spoke these words for the sake of the many beings whowould come in the future, so that if they were to hear this teaching andreflect and meditate on it, it might be of some help to them.Parents who love their children give them all sorts of helpful advice,telling them what is right and what is wrong: “If you do this, you will getintroduction /11Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 11"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"into trouble; if you do that, it will help you,” or “If you associate with thatsort of person, he will help you, but be careful not to go around with thatother person as he will trick you.” The same is true for this extraordinaryinstruction by Deshek Gyawopa, which will aid us both in this life and inthe next. If we fail to follow this advice, we will get into trouble and beharmed both in this life and in subsequent ones.He gives this advice as if he were opening his heart, expressing his deep-est, innermost thoughts for our benefit. It is like a final testament given toone’s children as one is dying. Afterwards the children will think, “Thesewere my parents’ last words,” and they will have all the more respect forwhat those words mean. Similarly, if we practice in accordance with themeaning of this, his final testament, it will greatly help us in the future.

To practice the Dharma,it is essential to have the solid foundation of the Pratimoksha, Bodhisattva,and Secret Mantrayana vows. Without these it is impossible to practice theDharma, just as it is impossible to build a big house without having firmground to build on.Once we have this well-prepared field, we can plant in it the seeds of con-centration from which experiences and realization will grow. We also haveto take care of the field properly, to till the earth, spread manure, and waterit; and the sun must shine on the field to warm it.If all these conditions are brought together properly, then the crop ofwisdom will grow without difficulty.

Once one has entered the door of the Dharma and been “hooked”by the Dharma, even if one does not practice very much, the blessing ofthe Dharma is such that one can only be benefited and drawn toward lib-eration. Of the many different kinds of activity, the Dharma, which is theactivity aspect of the enlightened Buddha, is the most important.

These two aspects include all the Three Jewels. The Buddha is theone who expounds the Dharma; the Sangha comprises the companions onthe path who accompany us in practicing the Dharma. Of all the differentmeanings of the word “dharma,”16the most important is this Jewel of theDharma, the vast and profound teaching of the Buddha.One might wonder whether the scriptures are the Jewel of the Dharma.They are not the ultimate realization,17but they are nevertheless the Jewelof the Dharma. This is because they are the support for that realization.Just as, on the physical plane, a statue or other image of our Teacher18inspires devotion when we look at it, and through generating devotion wereceive blessings and can progress along the path, similarly the scripturalDharma sustains our realization. This is why, when Lord Buddha passedinto Nirvana, he said that the Dharma would be his representative.Through studying the Dharma one can know what the Buddha himself islike and what the teaching is like; one can know the path to enlightenment.The Dharma is thus a likeness of the dharmakaya; it is the dharmakayamade visible.In order for us to practice the Dharma, faith must come first. We needto know what are the drawbacks of not having faith and what are the qual-ities and benefits that come from having it. Faith, disillusionment with theworld, and the desire to get out of samsara are not things that everyone hasnaturally, from the beginning. But they can be developed, for every sen-tient being has the tathagatagarbha, the buddha nature, within himself orherself. The presence of the buddha nature naturally helps all good quali-ties to grow, just as the presence of the sun in the sky naturally dispels dark-ness over the earth. It is this tathagatagarbha that is pointed out throughthe instructions of Mahamudra and the Great Perfection, and because ofthis buddha nature that we have within us, it is quite easy for faith, deter-mination to be free, and so forth to arise on their own within our minds.To help these qualities grow in us, we need to receive teachings from ourteacher, to follow him, and to reflect on the enlightened qualities we cansee in him. As we do so, we will naturally understand the drawbacks of nothaving faith.16/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Now we may talk about faith, but unless we know what we mean by faith,it will merely be an empty word.The essence of faith is to make one’s being and the perfect Dharma inseparable.When the Dharma and one’s being have truly mingled, then there is per-fect faith. Faith also implies aspiration, a sense of longing. When we longto become very rich, for example, we do everything necessary, undergogreat hardship, and expend a lot of energy to achieve this goal. The sameis true for wishing to become famous or to achieve any other worldly goal:if our aspiration and determination are strong enough, we will manage toachieve what we want. This is a very powerful quality. Similarly, with faiththere is a strong motivation and wish to achieve something, and a naturalunderstanding of the drawbacks of not having this sort of aspiration.When faith has become truly blended with one’s mind and become part ofit, then one’s Dharma practice naturally becomes genuine and pure. Thisis what is meant by the “perfect Dharma.”19This clear aspiration to prac-tice the Dharma is what we call faith.The etymology of the word “faith” is: the aspiration to achieve one’s goal.When we hear about all the qualities of the past Buddhas, the lives of thegreat teachers, and the realization they achieved, we may aspire to achievesuch qualities ourselves and to set out on the path. This longing is what wecall yearning faith. We may, for instance, think that the Dharma is some-thing valuable and therefore start to learn Tibetan. As we gradually beginto understand the language, our longing to understand the teachings willgrow more and more. This is the fruit of our aspiration. If we were to dis-tinguish different kinds of faith,The categories of faith are three: vivid faith, yearning faith, and confident faith.The first of these, vivid faith, is the natural interest and vivid joy we feelwhen we hear about the lives of Guru Rinpoche and the great siddhas, andthe miracles they performed.Yearning faith is the longing and hope we have when we then think, “IfI practice the teachings, then in this life or at least in a future life I myselfwill achieve the level of Guru Rinpoche and the siddhas.” We may alsoi. faith /17Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 17"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"experience yearning faith when we hear of the qualities of Buddhafieldssuch as the Pure Land of Bliss and aspire to be reborn there.Confident faith is the confidence that gradually builds up when we haveboth vivid and yearning faith and we think, “If I practice these teachings,there is no doubt that I will be able to attain Buddhahood myself.” It is thecertainty that as in the past beings were able to gain realization through theDharma, so it will be in the future. It is confidence in the truth of the teach-ings. It is confidence in death—in its fearfulness, imminence, and unpre-dictability—and in all the other aspects of the teachings.There are six faults that come from not having faith.If we do not have faith, we will not be suitable vessels for the teachings.Without faith one is like a rock at the bottom of the ocean—the Dharma will not benefit one’s being.A rock on the bottom of the sea may remain there for thousands of yearsbut it never gets any softer. It stays as hard as ever. Similarly, if we do nothave faith, the Dharma will never penetrate our being and benefit us.One is like a boat without a boatman.If the ferryman or boatman is absent, there is no way one will be able tocross a big river or lake. In the same way, without faithone will not be able to cross to the other side of samsara.One is like a blind person who goes into a temple—he is unable to see the precious relics and sacred objects, such as statues,that represent the Buddha’s body, speech, and mind; and since he cannotsee them he cannot give rise to faith, respect, and devotion.Similarly, if one has no faith,one will be unable to understand the words and their significance.20One is like a burnt seed—the sprout of enlightenment—devotion, diligence, and compassion—will not grow.Without faith18/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"One is like a sheep stuck in a penor like a sheep that has fallen into a steep-walled pit with no way to climbout:there is no liberation from suffering in the ocean of samsara.One is like a maimed person who has landed on an island of gold.Someone with no hands, even if he lands on an island filled with goldand precious jewels, is unable to bring anything back with him. Similarly,although in this life one may have obtained a precious human existence,met a spiritual teacher, and entered through the gateway of the Dharma, ifone has no faith, one will not be able to reap any of the achievements orqualities of the path:one will return empty-handed at the end of this precious human life—the freedoms and advantages will have been squandered.✦✦2 ✦✦The virtues of faith.Son, there are six virtues of faith.Faith is like a very fertile field.When a fertile field has been well ploughed and tilled, each grain thefarmer sows, whether wheat, rice, or any other kind, will yield thousandsmore grains, and the farmer will become very prosperous. In the same way,the whole crop of virtue will grow.When one has faith, one will naturally feel a great longing to practicethe Dharma, and through this one will be able to achieve all good quali-ties. As the Buddha said, faith is like a jewel or treasure. It is the root of allother trainings and practices.Faith is like a wishing-gem—it fulfills all one’s own and others’ desires.i. faith /19Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Someone who finds a wishing-gem and places it on top of a victory ban-ner will have all his wishes and prayers fulfilled. All the clothes, wealth,food, and valuable things he could want will be effortlessly provided, notonly for him but for everyone else in the region who prays and makeswishes before that wishing-gem. Similarly, if we have faith, everything wedesire to achieve in our Dharma practice, such as being able to listen to theteachings, to reflect on them, and to meditate on them, will be effortlesslygranted, along with all the good qualities that arise from these.Faith is like a king who enforces the law.He makes himself and others happy.As a result of faith, we naturally recognize that all happiness comes fromobserving the law of cause and effect, from acknowledging that negativeactions lead to suffering and that positive actions lead to happiness. Wedevelop mindfulness and vigilance, distinguishing between what is to beavoided and what is to be adopted, and we then become suitable vessels forthe qualities of the Dharma. When a king enforces the laws he has decreed,there is peace throughout the kingdom and there are no quarrels, feuds, orbandits. Similarly, when we have faith, not only are we happy, we are ableto make others happy too. The spiritual qualities that we gain from havingfaith will be perceived and shared by the people around us. And like amedicinal tree that heals anyone who touches it, our own faith will inspireothers to endeavor in the Dharma and to seek liberation.Faith is like someone who holds the stronghold of carefulness.He will not be stained by defects and he will gather qualities.A temple or mansion that is built on the solid rock of a mountain isextremely safe and invulnerable to attack from hostile forces. Inside it feelsvery secure and one can collect within it all sorts of valuable things. Simi-larly, if we have faith, we will gradually be able to gather and store safelythe whole treasury of precious qualities of the Dharma, such as those oflistening, reflecting, and meditating. Sakya Pandita said that if one studiesone verse a day, one can gradually become very learned, like a bee gather-ing honey. Even though a bee has a tiny mouth, by collecting the nectar itis slowly able to amass a large quantity of honey. Likewise, by studyinggradually with the mouth of faith we will be able to gather the qualities of20/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the Dharma—disillusionment with the world and diligence directedtoward liberation.Faith is like a boat on a great river.It will deliver one from the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death.With a boat one can cross even a very wide river. One has little difficultyin safely carrying oneself across and transporting all sorts of goods andvaluables. In the same way, if we have faith, we can recognize the defects ofour condition in samsara, where we are afflicted by the sufferings of birth,old age, sickness, and death. Moreover, we gradually recognize that the onlyremedy for this is the Dharma, and through practicing the Dharma we areable to free ourselves from these four root sufferings of samsara.When Buddha Shakyamuni’s disciples encountered problems, the Bud-dha used to explain how these difficulties had come about through actionsthey had committed in their past lives. By this means, his disciples natu-rally began to understand the workings of the law of cause and effect andthe fact that nothing in samsara is beyond suffering. As a result, they rap-idly attained the level of Arhat. Faith has the power to dispel any of thesefour main sufferings. To illustrate how it dispels the suffering of old age,there is a story from ancient India about an old man of ninety years whorequested ordination from Lilavajra. Lilavajra told him that since he wasso old and did not even know how to read or write, it was too late for himto take ordination and to begin the path of Dharma in the usual way. Butthere was a special practice he could do, and he gave him the empower-ment and instructions on the sadhana of White Mañjushri. Because the oldman had great faith and possessed the appropriate karma, within sevendays he had a vision of White Mañjushri and attained the accomplishmentof immortal life. It is said that to this day he dwells in Payul Phakpachen.So through faith one can even overcome the suffering of old age. One canequally alleviate the suffering of sickness. By meditating on the MedicineBuddha and reciting his dharani, one can purify the negative actions thatare the cause of one’s illness and thus be cured of disease.Faith is like an escort in a dangerous place.It will free us from the fears of samsara and its lower realms.i. faith /21Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Through faith we acquire confidence in the Dharma. We acknowledgethe defects of samsara and we realize that the cause of our suffering in sam-sara is our past negative actions, which in turn arise from afflictive emo-tions. This leads us to exert ourselves in practicing the Dharma, and as aresult we are naturally freed from the lower realms. This is why it is veryimportant to repeatedly generate faith in our minds.✦✦3✦✦The causes that nurture faith and its qualities.Having recognized the fault in not having faith and the advantages of hav-ing it, we now have to see how to develop faith and make it grow. Faith isnot something that beginners naturally have right from the start. It has tobe developed through different causes and conditions.Son, there are ten causes that give rise to faith.You need to know that there is no happiness in your present way of life and circle of friends.In all our previous lives until now we have constantly wandered in sam-sara. With our body, speech, and mind we have accumulated all sorts ofnegative actions. We have always clung to those dear to us and hated thosewe have perceived as enemies. We have been completely distracted by theeight ordinary concerns.It is important to realize that all this has been pointless. As a result of itall, we find ourselves in our present condition: though we want to be happy,all we manage to achieve is suffering. However affectionate and well-inten-tioned our parents, relatives, and friends may be, if we listen to what theysay, there is no way we will be led to practice the Dharma. They themselveshave been caught in samsara for such a long time that the only advice theycan give us is how to get the better of our enemies, how to plough the fieldsand grow crops, and how to get rich by doing business. They are friendsleading us in quite the wrong direction. There is a saying:Don’t ask your father’s opinion,Don’t discuss things with your mother,Tie your own nose rope around your head,Use the Dharma to get your head into the sun.2122/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The same is true of relationships with others: they are devoid of any hap-piness. This does not mean we suddenly have to regard all our friends asenemies. It is simply that we need to stop alternating between hatred forso-called enemies and excessive attachment to our friends. We should befree from attachment and hatred. We should feel only loving-kindness andcompassion for those whom we perceive as enemies, and in the best casewe should be able to introduce both friends and those who were formerlyour enemies to the Dharma. Bear in mind that introducing beings to theDharma is a way of repaying their kindness. It is said that even if one wereto carry one’s parents on one’s shoulders all the way round the earth, onewould still not be able to repay their kindness. So the best way to repay thekindness of beings, who have all been our parents, is to introduce them tothe Dharma. To repay his mother’s kindness, Buddha Shakyamuni went tothe Heaven of the Thirty-three, where she had been reborn, and stayedthere for the duration of the summer retreat,22expounding the Dharma.The teachings he gave there are recorded in the Kangyur in the Sutra inRepayment of Kindness.23Where Shechen Gyaltsap’s note saysUltimately these are the cause of suffering,he means that if we follow worldly ways, we may become quite successful,we may be rich and influential or have the command of a large army, butin order to achieve that we will have committed exclusively negative actionsinvolving deceit, lies, and malice. These are the very cause of suffering, andit is for this reason that Lord Buddha and his followers left home andbecame renunciants. They lived in secluded hermitages and devoted theirlives to practicing the Dharma, living on food given to them as alms andfree from the negativity that comes from all the things one normally doesto earn a living.You need to have confidence in the law of cause and effect,for it can never ever fail.The root of faith is confidence in the law of cause and effect. We shouldnever think that small positive actions have no effect. Just as by collectingdrops of water one can gradually fill a huge vessel, by reciting the six-syl-lable mantra a thousand times every day, for example, you will graduallyaccumulate a large number of recitations and acquire the excellent quali-i. faith /23Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ties associated with the mantra. On the other hand, never think there is noharm in doing a negative action, even a very small one. Even a tiny sparkcan burn a haystack as big as a mountain. Nor should we underestimatethe power of a tiny negative thought. We might think, “I have not harmedanyone physically, I haven’t spoken harshly. This is just a little thought; itis not that serious. It is not as if I had killed someone. And anyway, I canpurify it through confession.” But as it is said, a thought of anger arising inthe mind of a Bodhisattva for even a sixtieth of the time it takes to snapone’s fingers is enough to make that Bodhisattva fall into the Hell of Ulti-mate Torment as many times as there are such instants of anger. We haveto be constantly vigilant, watching what the mind is doing, looking to seewhether our virtuous thoughts have increased, whether we can cultivatethem further, and whether we need to apply the right antidote. We mustbe continuously aware of our good and bad thoughts, like children atschool who are marked up or down depending on whether they have giventhe right or wrong answer.There was once a brahmin in India called Ravi. In order to train his mindin virtue he made two piles of pebbles, one with white pebbles and onewith black. Each time he had a bad thought or did something wrong hewould put a black pebble aside. And each time he had a pure, virtuousthought he would put a white pebble aside. At the end of the day hecounted these white and black pebbles. In the beginning he found he hadalmost only black ones, but by being mindful and applying the proper anti-dotes day after day, he reached a stage where half the pebbles were blackand half were white. Gradually there came a day when he could hardly findany black pebbles; he had had only pure thoughts and actions during theday. This is how we can change our minds: because thoughts are com-pounded and conditioned, they can be changed. Thus even someone likea butcher can suddenly become deeply disillusioned with suffering, withsamsara, and giving up all negative actions, enter the path of liberation andultimately achieve enlightenment.Then there is the story of the hunter Kyirawa Gonpo Dorje. In the begin-ning he was such a fanatical hunter that he would kill any animal withinsight. Until he met Milarepa, his arrow never missed a single animal thatcaught his eye. Then he met Milarepa and felt tremendous devotion tohim. He gave up everything and in a single lifetime was able to go to a purerealm.24Understanding the law of cause and effect is thus very important.It is what the Buddha Shakyamuni taught when he first turned the Wheel24/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"of Dharma. He showed that suffering and the cause of suffering are whathave to be discarded and that the path and the fruit of the path are whathave to be achieved. To develop faith it is necessary to have confidence inthe law of cause and effect. If we do so, our faith will necessarily lead to aresult.In ancient India there was a very learned Tirthika philosopher calledDurdharsakala, whose knowledge of the ten branches of science was unri-valled. “No one in India is as learned as I am,” he thought to himself, andhe set out for the monastic university of Nalanda, where there were fivehundred Buddhist panditas. So learned was he that when he engaged theseBuddhist panditas in debate, he defeated most of them. He was on thepoint of defeating them all when the great pandita Aryadeva appeared and,sitting on a rock, took on Durdharsakala. In the debate that ensued, Dur-dharsakala was defeated. His punishment, as decreed by the local king, wasto have both his hands cut off, and he was left to sit at the gates of Nalandawith a novice monk to feed him. From where he was sitting he could hearthe Nalanda panditas reciting the Tripitaka. One day, as he listened, he real-ized that the passage being recited clearly concerned himself, for it was aprediction by the Buddha about a certain Tirthika sage who would cometo Nalanda, be defeated in debate, and finally gain faith in the Dharma,becoming an active proponent of the teachings. He suddenly felt tremen-dous confidence in the truth of the Buddha’s teachings. Asking the youngnovice attending him to bring him the volume of the Tripitaka and placeit on his head, he made the following prayer: “If this prediction is true, thenby the power of that truth may my hands be restored and may I be diligentin spreading and benefiting the Dharma. If it is not true, may I die here,right now.” Through the blessings of the Buddha—for the prediction wastrue—as he uttered these words, he found his hands restored. Not only didhe enter the path of the Buddhadharma, but he also went on to becomefamed as Lopön Pawo, one of the four most illustrious masters in the his-tory of Indian Buddhism.25This story also appears in a work by Patrul Rin-poche on the benefits of reading the Mahayana sutras, which containsnumerous examples showing clearly and simply how the law of cause andeffect functions.When we gain this sort of confidence in cause and effect, we will find itimpossible to indulge in negative actions and quite natural to perform pos-itive ones. Like a sick patient, once we are sure that a medicine is makingus better, we will not hesitate to take it, however sour or bitter it may be.i. faith /25Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"You need to remember death and impermanence.There is no certainty when you will die.Although one has this precious human body, it is utterly impermanent.There is no doubt we will lose it to death and resume wandering in sam-sara.

Moreover, the circumstancesthat might bring death are unpredictable. When we consider how many ofthe people we have met in our life are already dead, or seriously sick or suf-fering, we can see clearly how impermanence works. This sort of reflectionon death will induce us to go to a lonely place and devote our lives to spir-itual practice. It is why Jetsun Milarepa himself went to a deserted placeand spent his whole life in ascetic practice—because he was constantlyaware of the suffering and imminence of death.You need to remember that you will depart without your retinue or wealth.When you die, you have to leave them all behind, so they are no use to you.There was once a universal monarch named King Mandhata. As a uni-versal monarch he had all the seven attributes of royalty and travelledthrough the sky on a cloud, preceded by the golden wheel, which gave himdominion over everywhere he went. King Mandhata ruled the four conti-nents as well as the abodes of the Four Great Kings. He became so power-ful that he ascended to the Heaven of the Thirty-three and shared thethrone with Indra. But then it occurred to him that it would be nice if hecould sit on that throne alone. As a result of this negative thought, he fellback to the lowest states of existence and became a common beggar withnothing at all. Just like him, however much wealth we may accumulate,there will be nothing we can take with us at death. Even if our fame spreadsfar and wide like the roar of a thousand dragons, it will not follow usthrough death, nor will it help us at all at the moment of death, howeverflattering it is now. Even if we become as rich as Vaishravana, we will notbe able to take any of our wealth with us at the time of death. We will noteven be able to take our own body with us.

And if we have committed negative actions, howeverpowerful we may be, there will be no escaping their influence when we die.Like the body and its shadow, we can never separate from the result of ouractions. The imprints of our positive and negative actions are like a hugeburden on the shoulders of the consciousness, and as we enter the inter-mediate state this is the only thing that will not get left behind—it is cer-tain to follow us. If we have spoken a single harsh word to someone, it willbe there on our consciousness. If we have felt devotion for a single instant,it will be there on our consciousness. So if we have performed vast posi-tive actions, we will be reborn in a Buddhafield, where we can meet theBuddha in person and receive teachings; or at the very least we will bereborn in the higher realms of samsara among gods or humans. But if neg-ative actions predominate, then whether we like it or not, we will be thrownlike a stone into the lower realms.The point is that we are blind to the existence of future lives. We spendmost of our time endeavoring to become rich, attempting to get rid of any-one who prevents us achieving our worldly ambitions, and trying to lookafter those dear to us. And when we succeed in these, we are really proudof ourselves and think, “What a clever person I am.” But this will not helpat all. We tend to think we are safe in our fortress, but this is not the case.We will have to go where our actions take us, and there is no certaintywhere we will be reborn.

If our practice has been of middling quality, we can confi-dently expect to be reborn in a Buddhafield, where we will be able to con-tinue on the path. Failing that, we should at least have the confidence to beable to say to ourselves, “I have done this much practice, so I will certainlynot be reborn in the lower realms.”It is not enough to simply have been born a human—this is not what ismeant by a precious human life. There are billions of beings in this worldwho have a human body, but theirs is not the precious human body. Whatwe call the precious human body is one endowed with the five individualadvantages and the five circumstantial advantages. Beings without theseare like people who have no eyes, nose, or tongue with which to see, hear,or taste. They have a useless human life.In spring the farmers work late into the night ploughing the fields, sow-ing seed, and tilling the soil, because it is the right moment, and if they miss28/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"it, they will not get a crop. For us too it is the right moment: we have theseeight freedoms and ten advantages and we have met a spiritual teacher. Wehave gathered all the right conditions, so rather than falling prey to indo-lence and laziness we must seize this opportunity to practice the Dharma.You need to bear in mind that the whole of samsara is suffering,It is never anything other than the three kinds of suffering.Why should we want to get out of samsara? Because when we examinesamsara, we can see that nothing in any of the six realms is beyond suffer-ing. Beings in the hells suffer from heat and cold; those in the preta realmsfrom hunger and thirst; and animals suffer from being enslaved, from stu-pidity, and from being eaten by others. Human beings suffer from birth,old age, sickness, and death, from meeting enemies, from separating fromloved ones, from encountering what they do not want, and from not get-ting what they do want. The asuras suffer from jealousy and from fightingwith the gods. And the gods suffer from losing the perfect conditions theyhave enjoyed for so long. So there is not one of these six realms that tran-scends suffering. We in samsara should feel like a prisoner who has beenthrown into jail and whose only thought with every passing hour is “Whencan I get out? Will I be set free tonight? Tomorrow morning?” Once we real-ize the extent of the suffering in samsara, our only thought will be, “Howcan I find a way to get out of samsara? When can I manage to free myself?What is the quickest way to get rid of all the actions that make samsara goon and on?”You need to see the immense qualities of the Three Jewels,What can help us get out of samsara? It has to be something that is itselffree from samsara. And this quality is only to be found in the Buddha,Dharma, and Sangha, which we know as the Three Jewels or the Three Pre-cious Refuges. “Buddha” means someone who has rid himself of all defectsand acquired all good qualities. He is like someone very rich and at thesame time highly altruistic, who by virtue of his wealth can help an enor-mous number of people. As a result, if we feel even a single instant of faithin the Three Jewels or perform a single prostration toward them, they willnaturally be there in front of us without our needing to invoke them. Theblessings of the Three Jewels are so powerful that simply hearing theirnames can free us from the lower realms. And yet the chance to hear thosei. faith /29Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"names is still something very rare and precious, not to be had unless onehas gained the appropriate merit. One might spend a billion gold coins butone could never buy the opportunity to hear the names of the Three Jew-els. If beings immersed in intense suffering—animals, hell beings, and eventhose who experience the unbearable agony of the Hell of Ultimate Tor-ment—were to remember the names of the Three Jewels for a singleinstant, this would suffice for them to find themselves in that samemoment in a Buddhafield. But such a thought never occurs to them. Why?Because they do not have the right merit for such a thought to arise in theirminds; in their past lives they have never had any interest in practicing theDharma. On the other hand, even small children born in a place where theBuddha came and taught have the good fortune to have a connection withhim. From a very early age they know how to say, “I pay homage to the Tea-cher, to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.” Through this connec-tion they are able to follow the path of the Dharma throughout their seriesof rebirths.It is certain that they forever protect us from the suffering of samsara.Once one has been taken under the protection of the Three Jewels, sam-sara will recede further and further, and nirvana will come closer andcloser. The wisdom minds of the Buddhas are so filled with compassionthat whoever makes a connection with them will eventually be set on thepath to liberation. To take a present-day example, the Chinese havedestroyed many temples and statues in Tibet, thus committing negativeactions whose results they will have to experience as suffering. Yet the merefact that they have seen those precious representations of the compassion-ate Buddha and have thus made a connection with him will eventually leadin some future life to their practicing Dharma and being liberated. Thesame is true for beings—even wild animals or birds—who hear the soundof the Dharma. Even if they do not understand anything, feel faith, or gainrealization when they hear the scriptures of the Tripitaka being read, thatsound is so full of blessings that those beings will find the gates of the lowerrealms closed and will be brought onto the path.Now who can show beings these great qualities of the Three Jewels andguide those who have understood these qualities along the path? It is thespiritual master.30/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"You need to look at the lives and deeds of the Holy Beings.The activities of their Body, Speech, and Mind are unstained by faults or defects.When one meets a great scholar, out of admiration one naturally feelslike studying and becoming learned oneself. And when one meets a veryaccomplished being, one feels like practicing in order to become as real-ized as he is. Thus, meeting learned and accomplished beings creates aspontaneous desire to acquire the same qualities as they have. Look at thelife of Jetsun Milarepa: his story—how he renounced the world, followedhis teacher, and underwent much hardship to attain enlightenment—iswell-known even to non-Buddhists and is a universal source of admirationand respect. Similarly, anyone who reads about Guru Rinpoche’s deeds—how he protected beings from the lower realms, establishing them on thepath to liberation, and how he subdued all the negative forces in Tibet—feels like taking refuge in Guru Rinpoche.Whatever we see of the physical aspect, the words, or the mind of a spir-itual teacher will inspire us to practice the Dharma. Physically, he might bea perfect monk wearing the three monastic robes, and we will naturally feeljoyful and think, “Here is someone who has given up all worldly affairs,who is free from all family ties, who has no family to support, who canspend all his life practicing the pure Dharma.” We might hear the teach-ings or read the lives of great teachers such as Shabkar Tsogdruk Rang-drol—hearing how they renounced the world and stayed in mountainretreats—and we will naturally feel inspired to do the same and devoteourselves to Dharma practice.26As for the teacher’s mind, when we receiveteachings from him and reflect on their meaning, we will realize that thepreliminary practice helps us develop disillusionment, determination tobe free, and confidence; that the main practice leads to experiences andrealization; that hearing the names of the Buddhas frees us from the lowerrealms; and that all these are due to the qualities of the teacher’s enlight-ened mind, which has transmitted this understanding to us. The teacher istherefore like a stainless, perfectly pure jewel. Like the Norbu Jitaka gemwhose radiance alone makes the turbid water in a muddy pool completelyclear, a true spiritual master can turn everyone around him to virtue andto the authentic Dharma by the sheer radiance of his enlightened qualities.i. faith /31Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"You need to keep the company of excellent friends who abide by virtue.Their good ways will naturally rub off on you, and faith and other vir-tuous qualities will increase.Ideally we should be like a wounded animal, staying in solitary retreatwithout any companions.

In our own coun-try, we meet people who are well disposed toward us and we becomeattached to them. This leads us to engage in all sorts of actions based onattachment. Then there are people who obstruct us and we think of themas enemies. It is impossible to avoid attachment and hatred. When we man-age to get the better of our enemies, we feel very brave and successful. Inour dealings with those we like, we indulge in attachment and busy our-selves with all sorts of different activities. When we are able to help othersand show affection for those to whom we are attached, we feel we are goodpeople. In either case, whether we are bravely subduing our enemies or vir-tuously helping others, we feel very proud of ourselves.32/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Wholeheartedly adopt foreign lands.If you go somewhere where you do not know anyone, there is no causefor either attachment or hatred.

So there will be very fewcauses for distraction.Unless you give up the activities of a household, you will neverfind the time to practice the Dharma.When you are responsible for a household, you have to plough the fieldsor engage in commerce and look after the affairs of the house. You neverhave a chance to practice the Dharma. People in this situation may thinkor talk of practicing the Dharma but they are so busy they never have anyleisure to actually do so, and their aspirations are merely words. That is whyShechen Gyaltsap adds,Put aside the business of running a household.In other words, you should drop all plans and projects for making yourhousehold more prosperous or for increasing it.If you do not practice the moment faith arises, there will be no end to the jobs you have to do.We have had the good fortune to meet a teacher and to receive someteachings, but this will not go on happening forever. When we have thechance to hear the teachings, reflect on them, and meditate, we should doso immediately because this opportunity may never come again. Other-wise, out of indolence and laziness we may think, “I have received all theseprecious instructions, I will definitely start putting them into practice inthe future,” and we will keep postponing our practice. When the hunterKyirawa Gonpo Dorje met Milarepa, he felt great devotion and an ardentdesire to practice the Dharma. He told Milarepa that he would return homejust one last time to tell his family of his intention to practice the Dharmaand then come back. Milarepa answered, “If you do that, you will proba-bly change your mind. Start practicing now.” And in his Hundred Verses ofAdvice, Padampa Sangye says, “People of Tingri, while you’re thinking ofit, practice straight away.” Soi. faith /33Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 33"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Cut through your indecision.In other words, you should think, “Now I am determined to practice theDharma, I shall attend this teacher, I shall receive his instructions, and Ishall put them into practice.” This is something you have to decide by your-self and then actually implement.Do not blame others for your own lack of faith.If we do not feel much devotion, it is not because there is somethingwrong with one of our teachers or because our companions have affectedus adversely. It is purely because of our own defects and wrong way of per-ceiving things. The teacher is placing in our hands all the means for achiev-ing enlightenment, so we should see perfection in everything he does andsays. If we think he is truly the Buddha, whatever he does is perfect. Thissort of devotion will cause our impure perception, in which we see defectsin the teacher, to give way to pure perception, in which we see his enlight-ened activities as they actually are. Unless we have faith, we will see defectsin the teacher, as did Sunakshatra,28who declared that the Buddha’s teach-ings were simply designed to fool beings, and Devadatta, who despite beingthe Buddha’s cousin, spent his life trying to harm him. So examine yourown mistakes and defects andWind the nose rope around your head—that is, the rope Tibetans use to lead animals by the nose. In other words,mind your own mistakes.Unless you cast your possessions to the wind, you will neverexhaust your worldly ambitions.As long as we remain preoccupied with delicious food and comfortableclothes, wherever we are we will never be satisfied. However much we have,it will never be enough and we will always want more. On the other hand,if we can be content with just enough food to fill our stomachs and suffi-cient clothing to protect us from the cold, then whether or not we live inpleasant surroundings, whether or not we have friends, we will be free toprogress along the path to enlightenment, and that is more than enough.Whatever you have, use it to make offerings to the teacher and to the Three Jewels.34/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 34"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"If you are wealthy, the best way to use your wealth is to serve the Sanghaand to offer money for building temples and making objects that representthe Three Jewels.29You should also practice the three ways of pleasing theteacher. The best way to please him is through your own practice andaccomplishment. The middling way is to do everything you can to servehim physically, verbally, and mentally. The least beneficial way to pleasehim is to make material offerings.Wealth is like an illusion, but if we offer it and use it for meritorious pur-poses, we will gather merit. Merit too is like an illusion, but it helps lead toenlightenment, for such merit never disappears. There was once a youngcountry boy who was extremely poor. One day he saw the BuddhaVipashyin passing, begging for alms. He was suddenly filled with faith andwanted to offer him something, but because he was so poor he had noth-ing to offer except seven peas he was holding in his hand. With great devo-tion he threw the peas before the Buddha as an offering. Four of them fellin the Buddha’s begging bowl, two touched his heart, and one fell on topof his head. As a result of the complete faith he had when he made thisoffering, he was later reborn as King Mandhata. Because of the four peashe had offered, he ruled the four continents. Because of the two peas thattouched the Buddha’s heart, he had dominion first over the realm of theFour Great Kings and later over the Heaven of the Thirty-three. Andbecause of the pea that fell on the Buddha’s head, he had the good fortuneto share Indra’s throne.Everything depends on one’s attitude. The boy’s offering was very smallbut was made with a very pure attitude and therefore had a great result.On the other hand, an offering made simply with the intention of appear-ing important or gaining fame, or made with the competitive aim of beingbetter than anyone else, will bring hardly any benefit, no matter how big itis. That is why we should have the same attitude to worldly possessions asJigme Lingpa did: “Seeing all possessions and wealth as impermanent andwithout essence, seek the wealth of the seven noble riches.” The seven nobleriches are faith, discipline, a sense of shame in one’s own eyes, a sense ofdecency in others’ regard, and so forth. When we have them, all good qual-ities will grow from within. But if we accumulate a lot of wealth and hoardit greedily, we are simply creating the cause for rebirth as a preta.Unless you distance yourself from your relatives, there will be no interruption in your attachment and aversion.i. faith /35Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Stay far away from your relatives and friends, for when someone is goodto you, it is very difficult to avoid becoming attached.

We might think, “I will meet the teacher again next year and receiveteachings, and I will practice then,” but we cannot be sure that we will beable to do things as planned. We do not know what could happen even ashort time from now.Now, when all the favorable conditions have come together, you shoulddo anything to get free from samsara.When one is thrown into jail by the authorities, one’s only thought is,“How can I get out? Who can help me?” Similarly, when one is sick, oneonly thinks of finding a doctor and taking his medicine. One will do any-thing to get rid of one’s predicament. So now that we have gathered theconditions for doing so, we should be constantly preoccupied with gettingfurther and further away from samsara. We should be prepared to do any-thing to get even a millimeter further away from samsara.Doing nothing now when you have the means, the prayers youmake for future lives are empty chatter.You might say, “Right now I have to finish my work, I have such-and-such business to attend to, but I’ll pray that in a future life I will be a verygood practitioner.” But these are just meaningless words. Who knows whatwill happen in the next life? If we are caught up in so much attachment tofriends in this life, then in the next life our attachment will be even greater.Attachment to our wealth and activities is the very cause for rebirth in thelower realms.

You might as well carry on with all your worldly activities—doingbusiness and cheating others, crushing your enemies and promoting yourfriends. But if you think this is not actually the right way to benefit your-self, you will realize that you have only been harming and deceiving your-self. So instead,take your own mind as a witness.Jetsun Milarepa said, “The root of samaya is not to be ashamed of one-self.” There is no way the mind can lie to itself. We know what we have beendoing. We can easily see whether we have followed the teacher properly andwhether we have put his instructions into practice or not. The mind cansee the smallest things perfectly well—there is nothing it can hide fromitself. If one has made a little progress or gained a few good qualities, themind will know. But while it is very easy for one to know what is happen-ing in one’s own mind, it is difficult for others to judge from one’s exter-nal appearance and behavior.

You can give them away and devote yourselfto practicing the Dharma. For when death comes, you will have to aban-don them all anyway—against your will.

Youwill have to draw up your testament, leaving all your possessions behind.And on top of all that, you will not have acquired any spiritual qualities.i. faith /37Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"So it would be far better to use your wealth to serve the Sangha, to makeofferings to the teacher, and to offer it for worthy purposes.At the time of the Buddha there was a householder called Anathapin-daka who decided to give away all his land to build a vihara in which theBuddha and his disciples could stay. One day he was with the Buddha’s dis-ciple Shariputra marking out the ground for the vihara, and he noticedShariputra smile. An Arhat does not smile without reason, so he askedShariputra what had pleased him. Shariputra replied, “I have just seen thatthere is a palace already waiting for you in one of the Buddhafields.” Thatis how infallible the law of cause and effect is. At present Anathapindaka isin the Heaven of the Thirty-three enjoying the pleasures of the gods. Andas predicted by the Buddha, during this kalpa of a thousand Buddhas,Anathapindaka will come as a Bodhisattva, appearing as each Buddha’spatron, building a vihara for him, and being reborn each time in a Bud-dhafield.Whatever you have, your body and wealth, give it away for the Dharma.Jetsun Milarepa, for example, offered a big copper pot to Marpa, andthrough this offering he made the proper connection for becoming a fitvessel for the whole of Marpa’s teaching.Rather than concerning yourself with things you obviouslycannot complete, concern yourself with making an experience of what you definitely can complete.Whatever you do, there are things that you will never be able to copewith. You might think of subduing enemies and manage to get the betterof a few around you, but there is no end to those enemies. You could neversubdue all the enemies on earth.

There is no endto ordinary attachment. But what you really can do at present is to decideto practice the Dharma and devote all your energy to that. That is some-thing manageable—something you can cope with. Therefore,For the sake of the Dharma, be prepared for austerity and forbearance.Instead of preparing for next year —when you cannot be surewhether or not there will be a next year—prepare for death, whichis certain to happen.38/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"How can we say, “Next year I shall do this or that, I shall conduct such-and-such business, I shall accomplish such-and-such a task”?

That is why Shechen Gyaltsapnotes,Time is short, curtail your plans.Starting from this very moment, we should make a heartfelt aspirationto meet the teacher, to receive his teachings, to begin the preliminary prac-tice, and, having completed it, to continue immediately with the mainpractice, going through the generation and perfection phases and the prac-tices of the Great Perfection without pausing between one stage and thenext. If we have the deep intention to practice like this, then everything willhappen accordingly and there will be immeasurable benefits.

SoFor those who practice the Dharma it is very important to give up allconcern for this life.The thirteen points in this chapter concern things for which we shouldfeel distaste. What do we mean here by distaste? Like a jaundiced patientwho has no appetite at all for greasy food, a genuine Dharma practitioneris said to be someone who is completely uninterested in possessions,achievement, fame, or glory in worldly life.

The first one concerns theteacher:His realization is like space, beyond all partiality.Those whose realization has become as vast as the sky have no bias. Theydo not see samsara as something to be rejected, nor do they see the quali-ties of nirvana as something to be preferred and obtained. They have real-ized that all the afflictive emotions and the negative actions in samsara areby nature the kayas and wisdoms of the Buddhas.In the causal vehicle of characteristics, absolute truth is considered as thatwhich has to be realized, while the phenomena of relative truth are consid-ered as impure and to be rejected. But this sort of discrimination, this dualperception of pure and impure, of something to be obtained and somethingto be rejected, is not the correct view of the Secret Mantrayana. Why? Theroot of our wandering in samsara is the five gross aggregates. According tothe Mantrayana, which distinguishes between the way things appear andthe way things are, these aggregates, along with the elements, sense organs,and sense objects, may appear as our relative perceptions. But with regardto the way they are, they are the pure three seats—that is, they are by naturethe five Dhyani Buddhas and their consorts, the eight male and femaleBodhisattvas, and so on. When we fail to recognize this and cling to the grossaggregates, we give rise to the afflictive emotions. The aggregates thusbecome the cause for wandering in the three worlds of sam sara. Mantra-yana practitioners are able to dispel this deluded perception of the aggre-gates and so forth and allow their true nature, the way it is, to appear clearly.They thus achieve the perception of infinite purity. Theirs is realizationwithout any bias, in which there is no distinction between samsara as some-thing to be rejected and nirvana as something to be preferred and obtained.His experience is constant and level like the ocean.31Realization comes through three stages: understanding, experiences,and realization. The first of these is theoretical understanding, which40/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"comes from learning the teachings. Of course it brings some benefit, but itis not very stable. It is like a patch sewn onto a piece of clothing: it can comeoff again. Although we have some theoretical understanding, it may not bevery reliable in the face of different circumstances and might not help uscope with difficulties.Experiences are like mist: they will fade away. Practitioners who spendtheir time practicing in seclusion are certain to have many different expe-riences, but these experiences are very unreliable. As it is said, experiencesare like rainbows, but the great meditator who runs after them like a childwill be deceived. We may occasionally have flashes of clairvoyance, seeingthings we cannot ordinarily know. We may have signs of accomplishment,or predictions from the deity or the dakinis. But such experiences in mostcases give rise to hope and expectation. They are none other than the tricksof demons: they simply cause obstacles.When true realization dawns in one’s mind, it is like the king of moun-tains, Mount Meru, which no wind can shake. This means that in a thou-sand good circumstances the mind does not become attached and in athousand adverse circumstances the mind feels no aversion. It is said thatfor those who attain the level of Arhat it does not make the slightest dif-ference whether on one side there is a beautiful person waving a sandal-wood fan and on the other side a fearsome person threatening to kill themwith an axe. They feel neither attachment to the one nor aversion to theother. This is the quality of realization one achieves through the so-calledLesser Vehicle, so how much vaster should the realization of the Great Vehi-cle be. And in the Great Perfection we speak of the “exhaustion of phenom-ena in the expanse of dharmakaya.” “Exhaustion” here does not mean theextinction of phenomena but rather the exhaustion of all deludedpercep-tions. In that state, what is ordinarily perceived as suffering arises as per-fect bliss and all distinctions between good and bad have vanished. Allcircumstances, whether good or bad, thus become helpers, friends on thepath.His compassion shines evenly, like the sun and the moon.32When we have proper devotion and confidence in the Three Jewels andthe teacher, their compassion is always present, like the sun and moon thatmove constantly over the four continents. It is unthinkable that the sunand moon might ever stop shining, or that they might stop shining overone particular place. If your devotion to your root teacher and the Threei. faith /41Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Jewels is sound, you can be sure that they are watching over you with com-passion constantly, day and night, through happiness and suffering.To a teacher who has these three qualities, it is very important to be respectful.You should respect such a teacher with your body, speech, and mind. Itis said that in the beginning one has to be skillful in finding the teacher, inthe middle one has to be skillful in following him, and in the end one hasto be skillful in putting his instructions into practice. Someone who suc-ceeds in these three ways will travel the whole path without difficulty.To enter the path of Dharma, we have to be properly prepared and verysure of what we are doing. In ordinary life, people who are about to startan important project, get married, or build a house begin by carefully con-sidering the different elements of the situation. Similarly, if we want topractice the Dharma, we first have to find an authentic teacher, and for thiswe should not rely on how famous he is. Then having found an authenticteacher, we have to follow him properly and practice his instructions. Infollowing the teacher, it is said we should be like a belt that cannot be feltwhen worn; that is, we should never be a source of discomfort for him ordisturb him. Like salt, which readily dissolves in water, we should be ableto adapt to all circumstances and not be bothered by them. With our body,speech, and mind we should follow the teacher without causing trouble,doing whatever pleases him and never, even secretly, doing anything thatmight displease him. We should be like a swan or duck gliding between thelotus flowers, picking at the flowers and feeding, but without disturbingthe surface of the water or making the water muddy. Like this, if we pleasethe teacher throughout our life, then when death comes, our mind willreadily become one with the teacher’s mind in the same way that JigmeLingpa merged his mind with Longchenpa’s.As the teacher is the root of the path, follow him, pleasing him in the three ways.He is the “root of the path” because without a spiritual teacher there isno way one can progress along the path. Of the three ways of pleasing theteacher, the best is to put his teachings into practice. He gives teaching notbecause he expects any sort of recognition, remuneration, power, or fame,but simply because he can see how beings are deluded in samsara and howthey suffer on account of delusion. He gives instructions as a remedy for42/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"delusion, hoping that beings can thereby free themselves from ignorance.He does this out of sheer compassion like parents who kindly advise theirchildren to do certain things and warn them against doing other thingspurely for their own good, hoping their children will lead happy lives. Ifthe Buddha turned the Wheel of the Dharma three times, it was notbecause he was restless and had nothing better to do. Neither was it becausehe hoped to become famous. It was simply out of his intention to dispelthe ignorance of beings, and because he wished to set beings on the pathto enlightenment. As a result of his kindness, we can now hear the namesof the Three Jewels and read the teachings in the Three Pitakas that showwhat is positive and what is negative. Thanks to his kindness, the practiceof Dharma is accessible to us.Do not do anything disrespectful, even in a dream.It is said that if you dream you commit a negative act like killing, lying,or stealing, even though it is a dream, when you wake up, you must regretwhat happened in the dream and confess it. Likewise, if you feel disrespectfor the teacher, even in a dream, as soon as you wake up you should deeplyregret it and confess. Remember, too, that the more you pray to the ThreeJewels and to the teacher, the greater will be the blessings you receive.It is very important to give instructions to disciples who areproper vessels.Someone who has faith in the Three Jewels and the teacher, who is inter-ested in hearing, reflecting, and meditating, and who is very diligent shouldbe given the teachings without reserve, for this will bring great benefit.“Instructions” here refers to major instructions—the profound instruc-tions that lead to liberation and enlightenment—and not to minorinstructions for curing sickness, dispelling obstacles, and creating prosper-ity in this life. What then are the benefits that will come from giving suchinstructions to those who are suitable vessels?They will hold the lineage and benefit themselves and others, and theteachings and beings.In the best case, disciples will become lineage holders, like the SevenPatriarchs who held Buddha Shakyamuni’s teachings: they became equalto the Buddha himself and continued his activities, holding, expound-ing, and preserving the Dharma. Among Milarepa’s disciples there werei. faith /43Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Gampopa, who was like the sun, and Rechungpa, who was like the moon,and eight who were able to go to the pure realms in their lifetime, in thevery same body. These disciples were the true representatives of their tea-cher. It is through the kindness of such lineage holders, teachers who arefully enlightened holders of the teaching, that the different instructionsof the eight great chariots can still be given and practiced today, despitethe Buddha having taught the Dharma over two thousand years ago.33Do not be miserly with the teachings.Someone who is truly concerned with the next life and interested in theDharma should be shown all the texts and given all the instructions, with-out hiding anything. Of course, there is no need to reveal texts and instruc-tions on black magic since these can be harmful, but anything that ishelpful for the disciple’s practice should be given.It is very important to give up attachment to things, externally and internally.Practitioners who have full confidence in the Three Jewels need neverworry about food and clothing. These will come their way anyway. Whenthe sun shines in summer, it does not need to think about what it is doing—making the forests and meadows turn green, the flowers blossom, andfruits ripen, and warming everyone on the earth. It does all this naturally.Likewise, if you practice the Dharma sincerely, people will naturally be dis-posed toward you and will help you in your practice. Those who renouncethe world and take ordination are naturally respected by their families andothers, who are happy to support them. Those who are very learned do nothave to talk about it; they easily win respect. And siddhas who have attaineda high degree of accomplishment do not have to claim they are siddhas.Their accomplishment is evident and they are venerated for it. So we neednot be preoccupied or obsessed with external necessities; they will comeour way naturally. And in no event should we be attached to such things,otherwise we will be influenced by the eight ordinary concerns and be ledinto all sorts of activities in order to procure and keep them.Remember the defects of attachment to the pleasures of the five senses.When we crave beautiful forms, we become like moths, which areattracted to light and get burnt by the flame. However much enjoyment wemay derive from the pleasures of the senses, there will never come a time44/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"when we have had enough. The more we indulge in them, the more theybecome like honey smeared on a razor, cutting our tongues as we try to lickit off.The pleasures we desire will bring us ruin,They’re like the kimbafruit, the Buddha said.34So remembering these defects give up desire as much as you possiblycan.In practicing the instructions, it is very important to think in the long-term.In practicing the Dharma, the longer we maintain our diligence, themore good qualities will grow within us and the deeper our understand-ing of the Dharma will be. To really benefit from the teachings and developgood qualities, it is not enough to simply hear them. We have to be like thegreat teacher Vasubandhu: although he had developed the power of infal-lible memory and knew ninety-nine hundred thousand treatises by heart,he would still read them daily. He even used to recite them all night, seatedin a large oil jar to protect him from the wind. Jigme Lingpa said that trulydiligent Dharma practitioners remain diligent even when they get old; theybecome less distracted and busy. This is a sign of the real practitioner, whohas not been “touched by frost.”35Even if it takes very long, your days and life must be spent practicing.Jetsun Milarepa said, “Do not expect quick results; spend your time prac-ticing—in a race with death.” It makes no sense to think, “I have practicedfor one year; will I obtain realization? I have practiced for three years; willI obtain realization?” Simply think, “If I die, that will be that, but until thenI am going to practice.” As you become more and more acquainted withthe Dharma, your understanding will naturally become deeper and goodqualities will grow. When the Dharma hits the mark, it becomes more andmore effective.It is said that Dharma practitioners start out with suffering and end upwith happiness. When we start practicing, we have to go to a secluded placewhere we have very little food and must endure heat and cold. Moreover,the practice is difficult to begin with, there seems to be little progress, andwe do not have any signs of experience or realization. But then as we per-severe in the practice and the Dharma gradually becomes part of us, ourminds feel more and more confident and serene. In the beginning we arei. faith /45Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 45"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"bound to have obstacles, but with time we will feel happier and happier inthe practice.With worldly activities it is just the opposite: everything is very pleasantto begin with, but the end is very painful. We may start off happy, withwealth, a comfortable existence, and all life’s pleasures. But in order toachieve that, we will have accumulated mainly negative actions and cantherefore only end up suffering in this life and for many lives to come. Thisis why we must not view our Dharma practice in the short term. Neverthink, “I’ve practiced so hard for months and years, and I’ve still not hadany result.” Otherwise you will get discouraged when, after one, two, threeor more years, you have still not had any experiences. Take the example ofAsanga. He meditated for twelve years, praying to Maitreya, and in all thattime never had the slightest sign of accomplishment. Finally he had an expe-rience of genuine and overwhelming compassion, and at that momentMaitreya appeared to him in person. “I’ve been praying to you all these yearsand you never showed any sign of your presence,” complained Asanga.Maitreya replied, “I have been next to you from the moment you beganpracticing, but on account of your obscuration you did not realize I waspresent.” SoWith regard to the Dharma, do not be impatient. You need to accompany the teacher for a long time.To follow the teacher for a long time is of great value and it is otherwisedifficult to obtain all his qualities. Just as on a gold mountain all the trees,bushes, and flowers turn golden, if you follow the teacher like a shadow,you will become like Ananda: he never left the Buddha’s side and eventu-ally obtained all the qualities of his body, speech, and mind.36And just asall the gods and nagas take great care of the wishing-gem and make it theircrown ornament—that is, they recognize its great value—you shouldnever separate from your teacher even for an instant.Do not be skittishDo not be superficial and inconstant, thinking that following the tea-cher and receiving his teachings will make you famous or that receivingonly a few words of instruction and making a “Dharma connection” willsuffice.It is very important to develop fervent devotion to the yidam deity and the Three Jewels.46/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The essence of the Buddha’s teachings is to be found in the Three Jew-els and in the yidam deity, so you should have the intention to do the prac-tices related to them, praying and reciting the mantras over a long periodof time. If you do, the yidam will always be close to you, you will receiveblessings and eventually meet the deity face to face. In the Mani Kabum,Songtsen Gampo describes how to accomplish all the ordinary andsupreme activities of pacifying, increasing, controlling, and fiercely subdu-ing. He explains that for this one can do no better than to rely on Aval-okiteshvara as one’s yidam. He himself was able to meet Avalokiteshvaraas if shaking hands with him, and it is through Avalokiteshvara’s blessingsthat the Land of Snows was protected and the Dharma introduced to Tibet.Similarly, Lama Mipham37practiced all his life on Mañjushri as his peace-ful yidam and on Yamantaka as his wrathful one, and through this prac-tice his mind became united with the enlightened mind of Mañjushri.38All this depends on the strength of our devotion. The stronger our devo-tion, the greater the blessings. But to have no devotion is like hiding one-self in a house with all the doors and shutters closed. The sunlight willnever get in. Without devotion, even if we spend all our time near the tea-cher, his blessings will never enter us. At the time of Lord Buddha, therewere Tirthika teachers who spent some time in his presence and heard himteach, but since they had no faith they did not receive his blessings andcould not attain enlightenment.Without fervent devotion, blessings will not enter.At all times be diligent in taking refuge,because the root of all the Dharma is the refuge; it is the ultimate object ofmeditation of both the sutras and tantras.It is very important to cultivate diligence in the practice of virtue.It is said that if the Buddha Shakyamuni could become a fully enlight-ened Buddha after accumulating merit and wisdom for three measurelesskalpas, it was from having brought the transcendent perfection of diligenceto its ultimate point. He spent countless lives thus accumulating merit andin thirty-two of these was reborn as a universal monarch, each time accu-mulating boundless merit. As a result of this constant diligence, he finallybecame the Buddha, whom beings could know and meet. And it was withthis sort of constant diligence that Jetsun Milarepa was able to reach thelevel of Vajradhara within a single lifetime.i. faith /47Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Act like a beautiful woman whose hair has caught fire.A beautiful woman whose hair was on fire would not waste a second try-ing to put the fire out. With that sort of diligence there is nothing youwould not be able to accomplish.Do not fall under the influence of laziness,Without applying yourself, you will never succeed at anything. If you aretruly interested in listening, reflecting, and meditating, you should alwaysbe thinking, “There is so much to do, and no knowing when I might die,”and you should not waste a single instant on distracting activities.It is very important to steer clear of negative actions.To do so you need to be very mindful and vigilant. Be aware of whetheryour actions are positive or negative. Once you know what has to be takenup and what has to be avoided, you must avoid even the minutest negativeaction. If you find you have committed a negative action physically, ver-bally, or mentally, you must acknowledge it immediately, confess, andrepair the downfall. And if you see that you have done something positive,make a prayer: “May I do even more, may I increase in virtue.”Think of their fully ripened effect and avoid them as you would a speck of dust in your eye.It is important to examine your actions very closely. Particularly withminor negative actions, we do not see what the result will be immediately,but it is certain that those actions will mature and that we will have to expe-rience the result. Enlightened beings can see this very clearly. For them eventhe most minute negative action is like a speck of dust in one’s eye—onehas to get rid of it immediately. We ordinary beings, on the other hand, areunable to see the consequences of our actions. We are unaware of ourminor deeds and lose track of them like an arrow shot into a thick forest.We act without understanding where our actions will lead. But if we hadthe vision of an enlightened being, we would see that even the minutestaction has a result.It is very important to rely on the absence of thoughtsin your mind.The root cause that makes us wander in samsara is the chaining of our48/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"thoughts, and it is said that discursive thought is the “great ignorance” thatmakes us fall into the ocean of samsara. Unless we do something about it,this chaining of thoughts will go on and on forever. So it is very importantto employ the correct remedy, and here the main remedy is to cultivate thestate free from wandering thoughts.Let the thoughts related to the five poisons dissolve by themselves.For ordinary beings, thoughts related to the five poisons will keep oncoming up in the mind. Nevertheless, we should not let these thoughtsdominate us. Our approach to this can take different forms. In the BasicVehicle one applies the appropriate antidotes for such thoughts. For exam-ple, the antidote for anger is to meditate on patience, the antidote forattachment is to meditate on disgust, and the antidote for ignorance is tomeditate on the law of cause and effect and on interdependence, under-standing how ignorance leads to samsara, and so on. In the Great Vehicleone investigates the five poisons and comes to the conclusion that they arelike a dream or illusion: their ultimate nature is emptiness. Once oneknows this, one cannot be influenced by them. In the Mantrayana one real-izes that the basic nature of the five poisons is wisdom and, thus trans-formed, one uses them on the path of liberation and the path of skillfulmeans.In the postmeditation period, it is very important to rely on compassion and bodhichitta.Whether we are practicing virtue or giving up negative actions, weshould think that our sole purpose is to benefit sentient beings—all beings,without excluding a single one. As we realize the extent of beings’ suffer-ing and of our own inability to help them, we should develop the firmintention to do everything necessary to benefit them and dedicate all ourphysical, verbal, and mental actions to them. Otherwise, if we practice onlywith the self-centered intention to be comfortable in this life and to avoidbeing reborn in the lower realms in future lives, any virtuous practice wedo will have very limited results. Unless we begin with the altruistic atti-tude and end by sharing the merit with all sentient beings so that they canattain enlightenment, our practice is not the genuine Mahayana. We maycall it the “Great Vehicle,” but there is nothing great about it. The root ofthe Great Vehicle is that for the preparation one generates bodhichitta, forthe main practice one is free from concepts, and for the conclusion onei. faith /49Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"dedicates the merit to all sentient beings. Without these three suprememethods it is impossible to practice the Mahayana. The principal practiceof Bodhisattvas is to leave aside their own interests and consider othersmore important. We should follow their example.This is the root of the Great Vehicle and is therefore indispensable.Train in considering others more important than yourself.The Buddha manifested countless times in this world as different Bodhi-sattvas. He did not do this in order to repeatedly win fame and glory, norwas it merely to have food and clothes. It was simply due to his universalcompassion—his wish to help beings he saw snared by ignorance and tofree them from their suffering.It is very important to develop the conviction that the instructionsare unmistaken.When you receive authentic instruction, you should concentrate first onhearing it, then on reflecting on its meaning, and finally, through medita-tion, making it part of you. As you do so, you will gain the conviction thatthe instruction you have received is truly undeceiving and become confi-dent of its excellence.If you have no doubts, accomplishment will be swift in coming.The boundless benefits of putting the instructions into practice—med-itating on the yidam, reciting the mantra, and so forth—are described inthe relevant scriptures. Do not have any doubts about the truth of theseand you will swiftly achieve such qualities. But as long as you doubt andhesitate—wondering, “Does mantra recitation really have such power?” or“Can I really gain siddhi if I do the yidam practice?”—it will be impossi-ble for you to achieve realization or accomplishment.Furthermore, the root of attaining accomplishment is careful obser-vance of the three vows: the Pratimoksha vows of the Basic Vehicle, theBodhisattva precepts of the Great Vehicle, and the samayas of theVajrayana. This is why Zurchungpa says,It is very important to observe the vows and samayas.This is the well-tilled, fertile field in which good crops naturally grow.Therefore,50/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Do not let your mind be stained by the downfalls and faults related to the three vows.The three vows refer to the outer vows of the Pratimoksha, the inner pre-cepts of the Bodhisattvas, and the secret precepts of the vehicle of theVidyadharas. As a lay practitioner, you might think you have never takena Pratimoksha vow, but although you may not have been through the fullPratimoksha ritual, any Vajrayana empowerment you have received willhave included Pratimoksha vows as an integral part of the empowerment.There is no empowerment in which one does not take the three vows, oneafter another. How do we receive the Pratimoksha vows in that case?Through the kindness of the teacher we give rise to deep disillusionmentwith samsaric affairs. This is already part of the Pratimoksha vow, theessence of which is to realize the sufferings and shortcomings of samsaraand to develop a strong determination to be free.In the same way, if you have received a Vajrayana empowerment, thereis no way you cannot have taken the Bodhisattva vow, even if you did notgo through the formal ritual. At the beginning of an empowerment the tea-cher says, “These teachings should be received and practiced for the sake ofall beings, as numerous as the sky is vast.” This is the essence of the Bodhi-sattva vow, arousing bodhichitta. Likewise for the samayas, the Vajrayanaprecepts: the empowerment introduces one to the realization that all formsare the deity, all sounds are the sound of the mantra, and all thoughts arethe display of the absolute nature. For the body, we receive the vase empow-erment with the image of the deity. For our speech, we repeat the mantraand receive the secret empowerment. For the mind, we receive the thirdempowerment with the deity’s symbolic attributes. So in a Vajrayanaempowerment all the Vajrayana vows are complete. We have all receivedVajrayana empowerment,39so we have taken these three vows. It is there-fore very important to keep them and to avoid all faults and downfallsrelated to them, as such faults and downfalls are extremely negative.The essence of all these vows is summed up in this saying from thesutras:Abandon evildoing,Practice virtue well.Give up all negative actions and you will be keeping the three vows. Cul-tivate positive actions and again you will be practicing the essence of thethree vows.i. faith /51Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"However, if in performing positive actions—following the teacher, lis-tening to his teachings, and putting them into practice—and in giving upnegative actions you feel self-satisfied or proud and think, “What a gooddeed I’ve done,” this sort of clinging is a great defect. You should always becompletely free from clinging and see everything as a dream, as an illusion.Although you are following a teacher, in truth the absolute teacher is thedharmakaya, which is the nature of your own mind. The outer manifestedteacher you are following at present is himself like a dream. His manifestedbody is not permanent and he will again leave this world. The true innerdharmakaya teacher is never separate from you. So even if on the relativelevel you follow a teacher, practice, and do lots of positive actions, you mustdo so without any clinging, seeing all these as illusory by nature.It is very important to establish the unborn nature of the mind.As your mind and appearances are the display of the absolute nature, come to the clear conclusion that the nature of mind is unborn like space.In short, all the infinite phenomena of samsara and nirvana are noth-ing else than the projection of one’s own mind and are therefore an illu-sion. Nothing is truly existent and permanent. When you understand this,you will realize that everything is unborn like space, that its nature isemptiness. It is with this realization—that you yourself, the teacher, and allphenomena are like a dream and illusion—that you should practice themeditation on the wisdom deity and recite the mantra. And if you everhave a sign of accomplishment, even a vision of the yidam, you should con-tinue to recognize its illusory nature and avoid the error of feeling attachedor proud. To be conceited and think, “I have achieved a sign of accomplish-ment” is an obstacle, a demon. However high your realization may be, youmust never be proud of any signs such as clairvoyance that you may expe-rience, but remain free from clinging and see their dreamlike nature. Oth-er wise, if you are attached to such things, it will be impossible for even themost basic qualities of the path to develop in your mind. As the great sid-dha Saraha said, “Wherever there is attachment, there will be a downfall.”Even the husk of a sesame seed’s worth of attachment will create great suf-fering in the mind. So if you have any result in your practice, you shouldsimply think that it is the natural consequence of doing the practice andnot be proud of it.

To worthy disciples, as has already been statedin this text, the teachings should be given and not concealed, for they willbenefit them. But to give the teachings to someone who is not worthy is apure waste, just as pouring the snow lioness’ milk into an earthenware potresults in the pot being broken and the milk being wasted as well. Thegreater the extent to which the pith instructions are kept secret, the swifterthe results in the practice. In ancient times in the supreme land of India,the Vinaya teachings were widely taught. But all the practices of the SecretMantrayana were kept completely secret. In a gathering of a thousand pan-ditas, no one would ever know which of them were practicing the SecretMantrayana, who their yidams were, or what mantras they were reciting.It was only if one of them started flying through the sky or performingsome other miracle that people would realize he had been practicing theMantrayana. In Tibet, however, the Mantrayana teachings have graduallyspread and are now known to everyone. As result, the proportion of prac-titioners who actually attain accomplishment and realization is muchsmaller.Divulging the secret teachings leads to criticism, so be careful: take pains to check the worthiness of the disciple.This is why the teacher should know how to recognize the disciple’spotential. To someone worthy he should give all the instructions withoutholding anything back. But to disciples who do not have the appropriatequalities he should give teachings that will benefit them in accordancewith their real capacity—first the teachings for beings of lesser capacity,then the teachings for those of middling capacity, and so on, thus gradu-ally transforming them into suitable vessels.

At the same time, if we havefaith, diligence, and wisdom, we have the three qualities required for enter-ing the Vajrayana. In the Vajrayana, which is the highest and most pro-found of all the vehicles, the teacher first guides disciples who have faithby means of the ten outer empowerments that benefit. Then, to discipleswho also possess diligence, he gives the five inner empowerments that con-fer ability. To disciples who additionally possess keen wisdom, he bestowsthe three profound secret empowerments. These three qualities are equallynecessary in the Sutrayana: without faith it is impossible to progress alongthe path; without diligence there will be no result in the practice even ifone starts to listen, reflect, and meditate; and without keen intelligence andwisdom one will never get the vital point of the teachings, however mucheffort one makes.

So you must make a definite decision not to follow theadvice of anyone but your teacher and remain like a drop of mercury in thedust, which stays perfectly clean and does not mix with the dust around it.If your having things and your being delighted to give them away coincide with a beggar, it is simply that generosity is coming to perfection.In order to practice generosity, when you have things like food, clothes,money, and so on, you should be eager to offer them to the Buddhas or givethem to beggars. Then, if you meet a beggar, all the favorable conditionsfor an act of generosity will be present. You should take advantage of thesethree occurring together and give away as much as you can without beinginfluenced by niggardliness. If you think, “I won’t give now, I’ll give later,”or “This beggar doesn’t look desperate enough, I’ll give to one who is morein need,” you will never manage to be generous. Look at the bees, whogather so much honey and store it only to have it taken away in the end bysomeone else. And mice, who spend their time hoarding grains that arethen taken by others. Look at the many immensely rich people in this worldwho still never think of making an offering to the Three Jewels or givingto the needy.43Their wealth is piled up for no purpose; it is a complete58/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"waste. Someone who is very poor who offers just a single butter lamp witha pure intention will have inconceivably greater merit when he dies thanan apparently rich person who is unable to give anything away and makeofferings. Therefore,Without being trussed by the knot of miserliness, give away impartially.Do not be selective in your generosity, thinking that it is better to giveto one cause than to another. All forms of offering and giving are equallygood. You should not imagine that making an offering to the Buddha issomething very superior and dignified while giving to a beggar is very lim-ited (“He will just eat what I give him, and that will be the end of it”). TheBuddha himself became a Buddha by perfecting generosity and giving tothe needy. It was because he was so generous that great compassion andwisdom grew in him. So there is no difference between making offeringsto the Buddha and giving to the poor. In fact we should consider all thebeings we meet, beggars and so on, as teachers showing us the path andhelping us fulfill our wish to attain enlightenment. We should make offer-ings to them and give without discrimination.If, when you are practicing, the dam of suffering bursts, it is simply that you are purifying your negative actions.Rejoice and give up wrong views.If you spend your whole life practicing alone in a mountain retreat, youwill certainly have plenty of difficulties. You will fall sick, experience pain,and encounter many adverse circumstances. At such times do not think,“Although I am practicing the Dharma, I have nothing but trouble. TheDharma cannot be so great. I have followed a teacher and done so muchpractice, and yet hard times still befall me.” Such thoughts are wrong views.You should realize that through the blessing and power of the practice, byexperiencing sickness and other difficulties now, you are purifying and rid-ding yourself of negative actions you committed in past lives that wouldhave led to rebirth in the hells and other lower realms in future lives. Bypurifying them now while you have the chance, you will later go from blissto bliss. So do not think, “I don’t deserve this illness, these obstacles, thesenegative influences.” Realize instead that through the teacher’s kindnessand the power of the practice you can completely purify yourself of all yourii. discipline /59Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"past negative actions.

Make a wish that the suffering you yourself are expe-riencing may take the place of all other beings’ suffering, thinking, “Maytheir suffering be exhausted in mine.” So when you do experience such dif-ficulties, you should be very happy and avoid having adverse thoughts like,“Why are such terrible things happening to me? The Guru and the ThreeJewels don’t care for me, they have no compassion, the practice doesn’thelp.”If people are hostile with a Dharma practitioner who has donenothing wrong, it is simply that they are setting him on the path ofpatience.Avoid grudges and ill will; keep in mind the benefits of patience.As Kunkhyen Jigme Lingpa said:An enemy repaying your good with bad makes you progress in your practice.His unjust accusations are a whip that steers you toward virtue.He’s the teacher who destroys all your attachment and desires.Look at his great kindness that you never can repay!If someone criticizes or blames you even though you have not done any-thing wrong, do not get upset and angry or try to get even. Instead be grate-ful: regard it as an opportunity to purify your own actions from the pastwhen you yourself blamed others. Don the armor of patience, reflectingon this verse:No evil is there similar to anger,No austerity to be compared with patience.Steep yourself, therefore, in patience,In various ways, insistently.44Jigme Lingpa himself said that although many people accused and crit-icized him unreasonably, he always prayed, “May these people become mydisciples in a future life so that I can benefit them.” And indeed in his futurelives he manifested as Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje and as Jamyang KhyentseWa n g p o.45Here is a story that illustrates the benefits of patience.

One day theking and his retinue of queens went into the forest for a picnic. The kingfell asleep, and while he was sleeping, the queens wandered off and cameacross the rishi, Patient Words. When the king awoke and found that every-one had gone, he set out to look for his queens and eventually found themseated before the rishi listening to him teach. In a fury the king drew hissword and asked, “Who are you?”“They call me Patient Words,” replied the rishi.“Let’s see how patient you really are,” cried the king, and with his swordhe started cutting the rishi to pieces, slicing off his arms and legs. He wasat the point of cutting off the rishi’s head when the latter spoke:“As you cut me up bit by bit, I vow that in a future life, when I attainenlightenment, one by one I will slice away all your afflictive emotions.”Thereupon the king cut off the rishi’s head. From the rishi’s body, insteadof blood, there flowed milk. The king suddenly realized that this was notan ordinary being he had killed, but a siddha.“Who was this rishi?” he asked. When he learned that it was his very ownbrother who had become a great rishi by meditating in the forest, he feltdeep remorse. He took the body of the rishi back to his capital, held anenormous offering ceremony, and constructed a stupa in which the relicswere enshrined. When the rishi became the Buddha Shakyamuni, by thepower of his prayer in that previous life the king became one of the firstfive disciples who received the Buddha’s teaching at Varanasi. So a Bodhi-sattva is someone who takes refuge thinking, “May the harm that otherscause me create a connection through which they may attain happiness.”If we achieve some results from our practice and find ourselves beingrespected by people, we must never be conceited or proud that our activi-ties are increasing. See everything as a dream, as an illusion, and avoid get-ting attached to wealth and possessions, otherwise you will fall back intosamsara and end up having nothing at all.If your having consummate faith coincides with applying theinstructions, it is simply that you have come to the end of karma.The instructions are something we have to put into practice. Merelyreading the doctor’s prescription will never cure our illness.

We should use them correctly and not miss the point. Just as thebest way to kill someone is to stab him in the heart—he will not even sur-vive one hour—if you apply the instructions correctly and hit the vitalpoint, even one month of practice will be effective in dispelling your afflic-tive emotions and actions. Otherwise, however much you study and listento the teachings, the instructions and your own being will go differentways. Unless you gain stability in your practice so that you really over-whelm your ego-clinging and afflictive emotions, any so-called advancedpractice you do will be pointless, no more than an impressive-soundingname. But if you practice properly now,In the future you will not be reborn in samsara.Like a hooked fish pulled out of the water, you will have been hookedby the compassion of the Buddhas. If in this life you are diligent and prac-tice in the right way, even if you do not attain full realization, you will bereborn in a place where you can come across the teachings, meet the tea-cher, and continue to progress. The greater the connection you make withthe Dharma in this way, the more you will benefit. It was through practic-ing the Dharma that all the sages in the past attained their level of realiza-tion.The whole of the Dharma should serve as the antidote to attachmentand aversion.Otherwise doing a lot of practice will only increase your pride; spend-ing a long time in a cave or secluded place will just be a way to pile up pos-sessions, and you will become an evil spirit.

However hard they tried they were unable tomove it. Using his miraculous power the Buddha tossed the rock into theair with his toe, and when it landed again, he reduced it to gravel by point-ing his finger at it. Everyone was amazed and said, “Surely there is no onein the world more powerful than you.”62/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"“Yes,” replied the Buddha, “there is someone much stronger than me.”“Who can that person be?” they asked.“When I pass into nirvana, I shall meet the Lord of Death. He is far morepowerful than I am.”It is very important to constantly bear in mind that we are going to die,and that we will have to endure all the pain of dying. This does not applyonly to us. Think how many people have died in the past month. And con-sider howthey have died: some have died old, others have died young, andin all sorts of different circumstances. Where are all those people now, inwhich of the six realms have they ended up? Some of them must now beenduring the most terrible suffering. And we are bound to experience thosevery same sufferings too. When we reflect on all the torments that willbefall us, it seems that nothing in this worldly life is of much benefit to us.Do not be attached to happiness and comfort in this life.However delicious the food is that we eat, it all turns into excrement.However beautiful the clothes we wear, they are only covering what isunder the skin—foul components like flesh, blood, and lymph. So what isthe point of dressing one’s body up in brocades? This life is as fleeting as acloud in the sky; it can vanish at any moment. No one can say how longthey will live. And if they do live a certain amount of time, no one can saywhether they will be happy and satisfied all their life. Nothing is certain—neither the circumstances of our death nor those of our life, so we shouldhave no attachment to the things of this life. The only way to use our livesproperly is to practice the Dharma, and to do so when we are young andour bodies and minds are in their prime. We might think, “For the nexttwenty years, or perhaps a bit less, I shall earn and save enough money tobe able to stop working, and then I’ll practice the Dharma.” But who knowswhen we might die; who knows if in the meantime we might change ourminds? This is why the root text says,If you think you will finish your projects for this life first and after that practice a bit of Dharma, this is simply the demon’sdelaying tactics.It is very important not to fall under the influence of such a demon.What we call a demon is not something with goggling eyes, a gapingmouth, sharp teeth, and a terrifying look. The real demon is our predilec-ii. discipline /63Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"tion for worldly activities, our attachment to friends and relatives, ouraversion to enemies, and the fact that we are completely dominated by theeight ordinary concerns, together with the circumstances—both good andbad—that can make us stray from the Dharma. It is said that favorable cir-cumstances are more difficult to deal with and use on the path because theyare more distracting and make us forget the Dharma. So when we haveeverything we need—money, status, a comfortable home, food, andclothes—we should not be attached to these but view them as illusory, asthings that appear in a dream.Undesirable circumstances are relatively easier to deal with. It is rela-tively easier to meditate on patience when someone gets very angry withus or threatens us, and to practice when we are sick, because these arecauses of suffering and suffering naturally reminds us of the Dharma. Butwhen we are happy, when things are going well, these good circumstanceshave a tendency to blend very comfortably with our minds, like massageoil, which spreads easily over the body. When we enjoy good times, attach-ment rests easily on the mind and becomes part of our feelings. And oncewe are attached to good circumstances, the demon of the sons of the godshas arrived.

Even ifyour life is at stake, the Dharma is something you must never give up. Justas one uses spurs to make a horse go faster, the main spur to diligence is toreflect on death. Think how many people in the world spend their time try-ing to defeat those they consider as enemies. They spend years and yearsfighting, and often die before they reach victory.

Others spend their time looking after the inter-ests of their relatives and friends, but many die before being successful. Andbecause of the attachment they have, they are reborn as pretas. If we wereable to know precisely when we will die, we would be able to plan our livesand calculate exactly what we would do and when. But this is not the case.Some people die when they are going from one place to another. Othersdie when they are still in their mother’s womb. Some die young, others dievery old after going through all sorts of difficulties, illnesses, and all thesufferings of old age. There is no certainty at all about when we will die.And worldly activities are really very unimportant. So if you think you willcomplete all your ordinary projects first and practice the Dharma afterthat, you are not only wasting your time, but you also cannot be sure youwill ever practice. It is said, “Worldly activities are like children’s games. Ifwe abandon them, there will be nothing more to do. If we continue them,they will never end.” Moreover, it is important to realize how valuable theDharma is and to realize that if you have had the chance in your presentlife to hear the teachings and reflect on them, this is only the result of yourhaving accumulated merit in your past lives.Just how precious and rare it is to receive the Dharma is illustrated insome of the former lives of the Buddha. In several of these lives he wasreborn as a king in a place where there was no one teaching the Dharma.So great was the king’s longing to receive teaching that he erected a highthrone in front of his palace and offered his entire kingdom to anyone whowould come and expound the Dharma. On one occasion, a rishi arrivedand said he was willing to teach, but it would not be enough for the kingto offer his kingdom: he should be ready to give his own life. The kingreplied that he would happily do so. The rishi therefore told him to makean offering of a thousand lamps by piercing a thousand holes in his body,placing a wick and some clarified butter in each hole. Without hesitating,the king proceeded to do so and lit all the lamps. The rishi mounted thethrone and gave a single verse of teaching:Abandon evil doing,Practice virtue well,Subdue your mind:This is the Buddha’s teaching.Afterwards the rishi asked the king whether he had any regrets. Theking replied, “I am filled with joy at having received this teaching.” He wasii. discipline /65Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"profoundly grateful and felt no pain at all. At that moment all the godsappeared in the sky and praised the king’s determination to receive teach-ing. Through the blessing of his complete sincerity and joy in hearing theteaching and his total absence of regret in sacrificing himself, all hiswounds were miraculously healed.The king was required to undergo similar ordeals in other lives, likepiercing his body with a thousand nails or jumping into a pit of fire. Oneach occasion, he did so without the slightest hesitation and each time, onaccount of his joy at receiving instruction, he was completely cured. All thisshows just how precious it is to receive the teachings. We will always man-age somehow to find food and clothing, but the Dharma is much more rareand precious, so it is important to have a deep respect for it.If you want to cultivate extraordinary respect, examine the teacher’s outer and inner qualities.For us the teacher is the source of all good qualities and accomplish-ments. So you should examine him carefully to see the perfection in all hisouter and inner qualities, and take them as examples to be followed. Butin so doing, you must never have wrong thoughts or distorted views:Avoid thinking of defects.If you think the teacher has done something that seems not quite per-fect, you should realize that this is simply your own deluded way of per-ceiving him, as was the case for the monk Sunakshatra who thought theBuddha only gave teachings in order to fool people. Even if you see aminute defect, realize that it is your own wrong perception: rid your mindof such thoughts and cultivate pure perception. As the note says:Seeing faults reflects your own impure perception.When Guru Rinpoche came to Samye, although he was a fully enlight-ened Buddha and displayed many marvelous deeds and miracles, therewere still evil ministers who had wrong thoughts about him. They doubtedhis qualities and tried to obstruct his activities. Even King Trisong Detsenwas prey to such doubts. Having received instructions from Guru Rin-poche, he went to Yamalung and meditated in a cave, practicing the sad-hana of Amitayus. Through the blessings of this practice, Amitayusappeared in the sky before him and bestowed the empowerment from hisown long-life vase: the king received the blessing for attaining immortal-66/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ity. He then returned to Samye riding a horse and arrived just as Guru Rin-poche was bestowing the empowerment of long life. The Guru was at thepoint of dispensing the long-life nectar when one of the evil ministers whis-pered to the king, “Who knows whether the liquor has been mixed withpoison?” For a second the king hesitated, wondering whether it were true,and as a result the auspicious connection that would have secured the bless-ing he had received earlier was broken. This shows how important it is notto have wrong thoughts or doubts when there is actually nothing wrong.If you want your conduct to concord with all, do not obstruct the efforts of others.It is very important to maintain perfect harmony and good relationswith all your Dharma companions, brothers, and sisters. You should be likea belt for them, like something one wears all the time but does not feel. Youshould be very adaptable, like salt, which readily dissolves in any kind ofwater, clear or muddy. Relating to the teacher alone will not do; you mustbe able to cope with other people. Otherwise, you will cause your samayato deteriorate and upset the teacher. In everything you do, act in accor-dance with the Dharma and behave harmoniously with everyone. You cannever become a genuine practitioner by relating poorly to people—upset-ting everyone and acting contrary to their wishes.Furthermore, of the Dharma’s nine vehicles, practice the one that cantruly help you in accordance with your present capacity and condition.Never dismiss the so-called lesser vehicles, thinking that they are too lowfor you. Each vehicle has teachings that can help us according to our capac-ity. So you should receive and examine the teachings of the Shravaka Vehi-cle properly, seeing the truth in them and practicing them as much aspossible. Similarly, in the Bodhisattva and Mantra Vehicles you shouldlearn whatever is beneficial for you and practice them as well as you areable. Thus, do not discriminate against lower vehicles or long to practicethe so-called advanced teachings. Realizing that these teachings do notcontradict each other, practice them in such a way that they truly help youto progress. Then everything will arise as teaching. The Buddha gave all thevarious teachings out of compassion, and they are all imbued with his wis-dom: there is not a single word in them that can harm beings. Each one hasthe virtue of leading beings to liberation and enlightenment. So do not besectarian and think, “Our teachings are far superior to those of otherschools and philosophical traditions.”ii. discipline /67Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"As all the vehicles are true in their own terms, do not have rigid opin-ions about paths or philosophical schools.While we should never think that our own tradition is best and othertraditions are inferior, there is no harm in genuine discussion and debatethat is free of attachment and animosity, if it helps to clarify minor misun-derstandings or incorrect interpretations in our own view. Likewise, mis-interpretations of others’ views can be corrected by discussions betweenlearned siddhas.46So as never to upset the teacher, practice hard.It is very important not to upset the teacher or his other disciples. Tohave adverse views and act out of tune or disrespectfully with the teacherand those around him is not the way to please him, however much youmight think you are practicing his teachings. Be fully determined to carryout the teacher’s instructions exactly. Once you have received them, be dili-gent in practicing them as much as you can.

When a king’s subjects observe his laws care-fully, the king is satisfied and his reign is peaceful: it is easy to run the king-dom and everyone benefits. In the same way, if we rely on the Buddha’swords and the teacher’s instructions, our ten negative actions and afflictiveemotions will naturally decrease.68/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 68"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"All the precepts boil down to giving up the ten negative actions and thefive poisons as they are ordinarily experienced.48So be diligent and single-minded in getting rid of these five afflictiveemotions.

In thethree worlds of samsara, the main sufferings are the four rivers of birth,old age, sickness, and death. Under their influence there is no freedom topractice. The crucial point you need to know is that to stop the flow of thesefour rivers one has to listen to the teachings.If you want to halt the four rivers, you must ascertain the unbornnature of the ground-of-all.The root of our wandering in the three worlds of samsara and the sourceof all actions and afflictive emotions is the erroneous perception of pro-duction where there is no production.

So weneed to ascertain its unborn nature, to establish its empty nature.When we speak of the “ground-of-all,”49it can refer to two things. Oneis the support of all the afflictive emotions and of the imprints of ouractions. This is the deluded ground-of-all, which we have to be rid of. Theother ground-of-all is the primordial ground from which both samsaraand nirvana arise. It is the sugatagarbha or buddha nature present in everysentient being. It is what the “Prayer of Samantabhadra” refers to when itsays, “There is one ground.” This is what we are talking about here. Whenyou recognize this ground, you will know the absolute nature beyond ori-gin and you will thus realize that for all phenomena there is no coming intoexistence, no existing, and no ceasing to exist. Once you realize the unbornnature of the ground, you will no longer be swept away by the current ofthe four great rivers of suffering.When you have understood the unborn nature of the ground-of-all,the continuous flow of birth and death will ceaseand you will see the end of samsara. In the best case, you can put an endto samsaric rebirth in this very lifetime.

Once you have it, you do not need to think ofhelping others or to make a deliberate effort to do so. It just happens nat-urally. The main thing that helps us develop the precious bodhichitta is tomeditate on the four boundless qualities: love, the wish that all beings maybe happy and have the causes of happiness; compassion, the wish that allbeings may be free from suffering and the causes of suffering; sympatheticjoy, the wish that all beings who are happy may remain so and become evenhappier; and impartiality, the wish that happiness may come to each andevery sentient being without distinction, whether they are close to us orstrangers. We call these four qualities “boundless” for four reasons. First,their benefits are boundless. Second, the number of beings to whom weshould direct them is boundless, for sentient beings are as numerous as thesky is vast. Third, the qualities of enlightenment, which is the resultobtained from meditating on them, are boundless. Fourth, the attitude wehave when cultivating these four is boundless. Just as seed sown in a fieldthat is properly tilled, watered, manured, and exposed to the sun will nat-urally produce a good crop, if you meditate sincerely and deeply on thesefour boundless qualities, the precious bodhichitta will certainly take birthin your being.

Never think that the needto avoid negative actions and cultivate positive ones is a feature of the BasicVehicle and that there is no such need in the Great Vehicle or in theVajrayana. To do so is a fundamental error, which is why Shechen Gyal-tsap’s note says,Now, when you have the choice, do not confuse what is to be adoptedwith what is to be avoided.While you have in your hands the freedom to act and you know whichactions are negative, you should not err in the decisions you make and theway you behave.If you want your mind to engage in the Dharma, you must experi-ence the hardship of suffering.To turn our minds to the Dharma we first have to realize for ourselvesjust what suffering in samsara implies. Unless we have a taste of samsaricsuffering, our minds will never turn to the Dharma. Once we know whatsuffering is about, we will naturally try to find a way to be free from it. Sowe should understand the suffering inherent in samsara by studying thedetailed explanations on the preliminary practice. Moreover, we need tobe aware that by engaging in negative actions we are buying suffering infuture lives. So we should be mindful, vigilant, and careful, and confess andrepair our previous negative actions.Beginners should also understand that when they start practicing theDharma there is bound to be some difficulty. Trying to blend one’s mindwith the Dharma isdifficult, but this is a very worthwhile kind of difficulty.There is a saying: “In experiencing difficulty one achieves something rare.”It is only through great hardship that one can gain unique and worthwhileachievements. Buddha Shakyamuni, for instance, had to go through greatdifficulties accumulating merit over a period of three measureless kalpas,even though he himself said that the Great Vehicle was the vehicle forbeings of superior capacity. And if the Vajrayana is said to be the path forattaining Buddhahood in a single lifetime, that is not to say that it is aneasy path. Look at the hardships Jetsun Milarepa went through.

Their natural inclination is to takelife, to steal, and to do all sorts of other negative actions like harming oldpeople. They have never turned their minds toward the Dharma, let alonepracticed it. This is why it takes many months and years of practice for usto develop a peaceful, happy mind.

Dharma and worldly activities are like fire and water. If you prac-tice the Dharma genuinely, you cannot help giving up worldly activities.On the other hand, if you devote yourself to worldly activities, you willnever be able to practice the Dharma properly. So cultivate a deep desireto abandon the things of this world and a strong determination to prac-tice Dharma.To practice the genuine Dharma, you have to counter attachment tosamsaric perceptions.The root of our repeatedly taking birth in samsara is the alternatingdesire and loathing we have for the objects of the five senses—forms, tastes,smells, sounds, and physical sensations—together with the perceptionsour eight consciousnesses hold of these sense objects. When we feel attach-ment or, conversely, aversion to the experiences of the five senses, we sowthe seed for rebirth in samsara. It all starts with attachment. If we had noattachment, there would be no reason for aversion. Because we are stronglyattached to ourselves and to what is ours—our friends and relatives, ourbelongings, and so on—we feel aversion to anyone who might harm us oranything that is ours. But without attachment in the first place, there wouldbe no aversion. Once attachment and aversion are present, however, we feelwell-disposed to those who are good to us and we want to retaliate whenpeople hurt us. This leads to a multitude of actions, which are the activi-ties of samsara. Once our minds are dominated by attachment and aver-sion, any intention to practice the Dharma is eclipsed, so it is important togain realization of emptiness.No need to meditate on emptiness if you have not counteredattachment to the things you perceive.Meditation on emptiness implies a state like space. There is no occasionfor thoughts like “I,” “mine,” “my body,” “my mind,” “my name,” or “mybelongings.” This sort of clinging has no place in meditation on emptiness.76/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 76"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"So if you have thoughts like “my possessions” and so on, there is no wayyour meditation and practice can be genuine.One meditates on emptiness in order to release one’s clinging, believ-ing that things truly exist.A genuine practitioner does not have this attachment to relatives andpossessions, neither does he feel any aversion for enemies.Unless you are free from this, emptiness is no more than a word,it is quite useless.No need to practice meditation if you do not turn your mind awayfrom desire.To say “I meditate” and at the same time still have an ordinary mind withdesire and attachment will give no result.Great meditators who end up sidetracked by village ceremonies riskdying as ordinary men.Practitioners who have meditated in mountain retreats for a few yearsare often taken by ordinary folk to be very advanced meditators and manyof them begin to believe the fools who speak of them as great meditatorswho have reached a high level of realization. They start accepting offeringsand reverence from people, and they grow rich. They end up spending theirtime going from one village ceremony to another and behaving in a com-pletely worldly way. This is no use at all.No need for fine words if you have not assimilated the meaningyourself.53If you want to practice the Bodhisattva path, whatever you do—be it asingle prostration, one circumambulation, or just one recitation of themani—you must do it for the sake of all sentient beings, with the wish thatthey all attain enlightenment. This is the true practice. On the other hand,practicing without such an attitude, mainly to become rich and happy andto achieve greatness in this life, while saying nice things and speaking as ifone were a great Bodhisattva working for the benefit of others, is pointless.There are many who are fooled by smart talk about the view, so hit the crucial point of the natural state.ii. discipline /77Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"To say things like “Everything is void,” “There is no such thing as goodor bad, virtue or evil,” “All perceptions are spontaneously liberated as theyarise,” or “Afflictive emotions are liberated as they arise,” without havingtrue confidence in such a view and stability in one’s practice, is known asmerely carrying the view on one’s lips. This is why Guru Rinpoche said toKing Trisong Detsen, “My view is like space, but conduct must never sliptoward the view, for if it does, it will be a wholly black, demonic view.” Hesaid that the view should be as high as possible but that one’s conductshould comply with the most basic teachings.

That iswhat is called the skillful means of great compassion.The wisdom of emptiness involves seeing that all beings are ensnared byignorance and deciding to perform positive actions with one’s body,speech, and mind (for example, respectively prostrating and circumambu-lating, reciting prayers and mantras, and meditating on compassion), ded-icating all the resulting merit for the sake of all beings—all this withoutany attachment.If you can permeate the skillful means of compassion with the wisdomof emptiness, uniting the two, you will naturally be acting in accordancewith what we call the six transcendent perfections.Train in the path of the six transcendent perfections.Whatever you do in practicing the Dharma revolves around view, med-itation, and action. Of these, the view is of paramount importance. Whenyou are traveling through a country, you have to know where to go, whichform of transport to use, what the hazards are, and which routes are thesafest. Similarly, on the path to enlightenment, you must have a clear view,understanding how to travel the path. Action is a companion for the view,but should never conflict with it. The view itself may be as high as you wish:it should be the attitude of the Great Vehicle and the view of the Great Per-fection. But as far as your conduct is concerned, unless your view is com-pletely stable, your actions should never be on the same level as the view.It is wrong to adopt lofty conduct on the basis of there being no such thingas the result of an action, no such thing as cause and effect, no such thingas good and bad. Keeping your actions very down to earth will never inter-fere with the loftiness of your view. But if your conduct is on a higher levelthan your view, this will constitute a real obstacle.It is true to say that if you do not know how to unite view and con-duct, you are on the wrong path.As one traverses the nine vehicles, the view becomes increasinglyadvanced. The Shravaka’s view, for instance, asserts the existence of indi-visible particles and indivisible instants of consciousness. As a result of thisview, Shravakas are unable to let go of their firm belief in the true existenceof the material world. Although they have methods for purifying theobscurations of afflictive emotions, they are unable to purify the concep-88/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"tual obscurations. Bodhisattvas, on the other hand, do not have the beliefin the true existence of phenomena, and on this basis they accumulatemerit and wisdom on a vast scale, infusing everything with the wish to helpothers. As a result, their view is much vaster than that of the Shravakas.Nevertheless, in the Sutrayana there is still the dualistic notion of samsaraas something to be rejected and nirvana as something to be attained. Thereis no such dualistic concept for someone who has entered the Vajrayanaand has full realization of emptiness, of the view of the inherent union ofpurity and evenness. When we have realized this, we are on the swift pathto enlightenment. This is why it is important that the view should be ashigh as possible. But our conduct should match our capacity. In otherwords, our actions should suit the moment. For this, practitioners have tolook inward and ask themselves whether what they are doing is appropri-ate to their level or not. If we are unable to judge our own capacity, we risktaking the wrong path.Take heed that the view does not slide toward action, and that actiondoes not slide toward the view.Ultimately the view is not something to be sought outside: it has to befound within. So the text continues,It is true to say that the mind is by nature perfectly pure and clear,unstained by defects.When we speak of mind, the aware mind—with its many ceaselessthoughts—is not the ultimate mind. But once these thoughts have clearedaway, there is left the true, ultimate mind whose essential nature is empty,whose natural expression is luminosity, and whose manifestation is all-pervading compassion.60This natural state of the mind, when realized, islike the sun in a cloudless sky dispelling darkness all over the earth. Untilwe realize this natural state of mind, our determination to be free, our com-passion, and our contentment with what we have will all remain limited inscope.This nature of mind is not something that some beings have and othersdo not. Even ordinary beings completely caught up in delusion have it.Even tiny insects have it. It is simply that they have failed to recognize it.The recognition of this natural state of mind constitutes the perfectly pureview completely free from any stains or defects. As it is said of the perfectview of the Middle Way, “I have no postulate, there is no flaw in my view.”ii. discipline /89Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 89"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Once all the clingings to samsara and nirvana have dissolved into theabsolute expanse, one reaches the emptiness possessed of everything sub-lime, the view beyond all postulates of existence and nonexistence, and soforth. Kunkhyen Longchen Rabjam describes this as the ultimate view, thegreat purity and evenness. “Great purity” refers to the fact that there is nofundamental difference between samsara and nirvana; they are both, fromthe very beginning, the infinitely pure state of emptiness. “Great evenness”refers to the equality of all phenomena. It is pervaded by the unchanginggreat bliss, which is not the ordinary bliss obtained from the pleasures ofthe senses, like delicious food and so on, but the unchanging bliss that isthe natural condition of the Buddha’s enlightened mind.This supreme great bliss is ever present in the Buddha’s mind, so even ifwe were to look there, we would never find such a thing as suffering in hismind. Bodhisattvas who have realized this all-encompassing emptiness arecompletely free from expectation and apprehension. If someone is stand-ing by their side with a sandalwood fan wafting a cool, sandal-scentedbreeze over them, they do not feel elated or attached to this. If someoneinsults them or blames them without cause, they do not feel any ill will.Even if someone threatens to chop off their head with a sword, as in thestory of the rishi Patient Words, they feel neither fear nor anger. All this isthe result of their having fully realized emptiness. But the emptiness theyrealize is not a mere blank, in which there is nothing at all. Its natural qual-ity is clarity. The true view is the inherent union of emptiness and clarity.This realization of emptiness completely destroys all the afflictive emo-tions. And it is not only the full realization of emptiness that has suchpower. According to Aryadeva, merely thinking just once that phenomenamight possibly be empty—merely doubting their solid reality—is suffi-cient to tear the afflictive emotions to pieces. We ourselves may be quite along way from realizing emptiness, but we can approach it by watching thenature of the mind and ascertaining its empty nature. That is what we callthe path.Mind is intrinsically radiant and has never been contaminated byadventitious impurities, so its natural expression is the great purity.This is the very reason exerting oneself on the path is meaningful. If it were intrinsically impure, there would be no transforming it into something pure, and there would therefore be no point in striving on the path.90/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"That very nature has never been fundamentally changed. It has alwaysbeen there, and revealing it is known as the supreme accomplishment ofMahamudra, the ultimate goal. The reason Bodhisattvas have to accumu-late merit and wisdom for three measureless kalpas is because they stillhave not recognized this Mahamudra. Otherwise there would be no needto continue. We keep going because that is the way to progress and to rec-ognize the Mahamudra. Those who practice the three trainings on the pathof the Shravakas and Pratyekabuddhas gain only partial realization of theultimate emptiness, but this is already sufficient to rid themselves com-pletely of afflictive emotions. Thus, striving on the path is worthwhile,because it brings us closer and closer to realizing emptiness. Without dili-gence, we will never realize emptiness.Our efforts are also meaningful because we all have this buddha nature;it is fundamental to us. If the mind were not primordially pure, it wouldbe quite impossible to make it pure, just as it is impossible to extract goldfrom ordinary rock, however much one breaks it up and tries to melt andrefine it. But just as refining gold ore by washing, melting, and beating itwill eventually produce gold, striving on the path will unveil the nature ofenlightenment, which has been with us from the very beginning. This isprecisely why we can attain enlightenment. If that perfectly pure absolutenature were not already present within us, there would be no way to cre-ate it by exerting ourselves on the path. Indeed, it is said in the Vajrayanathat if one did not have the ground empowerment from the beginning,there would be no way to attain enlightenment. Unless the ground empow-erment were present in the disciple’s being, empowerment would not doany good. One cannot empower a grain of rice to be a grain of wheat. Giv-ing empowerment to a pea or grain of buckwheat and telling it that it isnow a grain of rice will not turn it into a grain of rice. But if it is already agrain of rice, then naturally it will grow and develop into a crop of rice.In the same way, the view, meditation, and action related to the absolutenature are present within one’s being. By unveiling this absolute naturethrough practice one can actualize Buddhahood. We all have the buddhanature. Now we need to recognize it through practice, like making fire bystriking steel and flint in the presence of tinder. We can attain Buddhahoodbecause its nature is intrinsic to us. It is important to understand this andput it into practice.ii. discipline /91Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"✦✦ 12 ✦✦Son, there are five things that are pointless:You might do them but the result will be wrong.These refer to certain things we might do that do not liberate us from sam-sara or lead us to ultimate enlightenment. Like worldly activities, they pro-duce the wrong result, the opposite of what we wish to achieve.There is no point in following a master who does not have the nec-tar of the teachings.It is important to check first whether he is authentic.If the teacher himself does not possess the nectar of the teachings, evenif you follow him very faithfully, there will be no result. All the effort youput into listening, reflecting, and meditating will be wasted because he can-not give you what he himself does not have. Conversely:There is no point in accepting a disciple who is not a proper vessel.If an authentic teacher pours the nectar of the teachings into animproper vessel, it is a waste for everyone. The teacher has given the teach-ing, but the disciple is unable to make use of it. It is wasted, like nectarpoured into a broken or leaking pot so that it spills on the ground. Some-one who is not a proper vessel may stay with the teacher and follow himlike his shadow, but he will derive no benefit from the teaching and mayeven develop adverse views, like the monk Sunakshatra. He spent twelveyears with the Buddha and learned the whole Tripitaka by heart, butbecause he had wrong views, he saw faults in the teachings and in the Bud-dha himself, and was subsequently born as a preta in a nearby garden.Even if he follows you like your shadow, do not give him instruction. It will benefit neither you nor him.There is no point in making a connection with someone who willnot keep the samaya.The samaya is the very life of the teaching and of one’s relationship withthe teacher, so there is no point in making a connection with someone whowill not keep pure samaya.

In the latter case, even if we have not committed any fault our-selves, simply associating or living with samaya breakers causes us tobecome obscured by their stain, just as a frog with contagious skin soresinfects all the frogs in the same pond and a drop of sour milk makes freshmilk also turn sour. So making connections with those who have brokenthe samaya helps neither us nor them.There is no point in performing positive actions that are mixedwith negative ones.For example, killing animals to earn money to build a temple or makerepresentations of the Buddhas’ body, speech, and mind,61or selling meatand liquor in order to sponsor the Sangha is tantamount to accumulatingnegative actions for the sake of the Three Jewels. It is quite contrary to theDharma and does not help at all.The preparation and conclusion must not be mixed with negative action.Anyone—a sponsor, for example—who performs a positive actionshould begin by having the pure intention to help the Dharma and to bene -fit all sentient beings. The beneficial act itself should be devoid of any neg-ative deed, such as taking life or cheating other people in order toaccomplish the so-called positive action. And after having performed avery virtuous deed like sponsoring the Sangha, one should not feel proudor look down on those who have not managed to do as much. Thus, to begenuinely positive, the action must be free from negativity in its prepara-tion, main part, and conclusion. Otherwise, if white and black deeds aremixed, the positive action will be spoilt in the same way as delicious foodis spoilt by mixing it with something unpalatable.It is the nature of mixed actions that they mature as happiness and suffering separately.ii. discipline /93Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 93"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"In other words, if an action consists of positive and negative deeds mixedtogether, one will experience both happiness and suffering in turn.There is no point in knowing the teachings if you do not actaccordingly.If you know the teachings of the Dharma but do not practice them, theywill be no more than empty words.

This is why the note says,It is important, rather, to integrate everything you know with yourbeing and to put it into practice.Whatever you have heard and learned, do not leave it as empty words.Incorporate it into your mind so that your mind blends with the teachings.Then the teachings will act as a remedy for your afflictive emotions, andthat is the point of the practice.✦✦13✦✦Putting the instructions into practice over a long period with determi-nation, armor,62and daring.It is said that with a single line of instruction one can attain complete Bud-dhahood.

To practice the Dharma, we have tobe free from the eight ordinary concerns—pleasure and pain, fame andobscurity, and so on. In particular, we should never practice with the ideaof becoming famous, nor should we be attached to any recognition we maygain from doing a lot of practice. Our minds should be completely rid ofthese eight ordinary concerns.When you are studying the texts, don the armor of forbearance.Earnestly put up with physical hardships and your inner fears regard-ing the profound meaning.It is very difficult in the beginning to study all the various scripturesthoroughly and to put them into practice correctly. As ordinary people, ourminds are full of afflictive emotions and are stained by past actions, whichcontradict what the Dharma teaches. Nevertheless, as we follow the teach-ings, our afflictive emotions and actions will gradually start to diminish.So it is important to put on the armor of forbearance, practicing withuninterrupted effort day and night. Even ordinary people do not mindgoing a whole day with nothing to eat or drink in order to attain mundanegoals, making a lot of effort and undergoing great hardship. But in pursu-ing their worldly activities, they are involved in negative actions and aresowing the seeds of future suffering, so it is all for the wrong purpose. Howmuch more meaningful it is to undergo similar difficulties—even for aday—for the sake of the Dharma, for it will purify our obscurations fromthe past and help us progress toward liberation. This is one kind ofpatience—putting up with difficulties in the practice. Another kind is tohave the patience to accept the profound meaning. Mahamudra and theGreat Perfection contain the highest teachings on the absolute nature andon emptiness, which are difficult for beginners to understand and accept.Indeed, some people feel afraid when they first hear the teachings onemptiness. Have the strength and openness of mind to accept theseadvanced and profound teachings, remembering that it was by practicingthe teachings on this view as vast as space that all the great enlightenedbeings of the past attained realization.When you are staying in sacred sites and secluded places, do notlet your mind hanker after food and wealth.ii. discipline /95Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 95"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Once you have received the teachings and diligently studied them, youneed to integrate them with your mind by practicing in a secluded place,where there are few people and where your practice will not be disruptedby ordinary distractions. Your mind should be constantly on the watch,recalling what is the correct way to practice and then checking whether youare indeed practicing correctly. If you do something with your body,speech, or mind that is contrary to the teachings, you should confess it,repair it, and promise not to commit it again. If you do something thataccords with the teachings, rejoice and dedicate the merit, thinking,“Through this may my obscurations be cleared away and may I eventuallybe able to benefit other beings.”What you must avoid doing, however, is thinking about the food you eatand worrying whether in the future you will have any food at all. It is par-ticularly important to be content with what you have. It is said, “Those whoknow contentment have true wealth at their door.” Be satisfied with hav-ing enough food to sustain you and enough clothing to protect you fromthe cold. Someone who is content with having just enough can adapt toany conditions and accepts things more easily. This is whyIt is important to have few desires and be content with what you have.Otherwise there will be no end to your desires, just as there is no end toa dog’s appetite. One can feed a dog a large meal, but as soon as it has fin-ished, it starts sniffing around for more. We are the same. We can eat a deli-cious meal and still want more. We can have all the clothes we need but stillwant to buy more. And there is no end to how much money we can have:if we have a million, we want two million; if we have two million, we wantthree. Unless we know how to be satisfied with what we have, our desirescan never be fulfilled. A Dharma practitioner should be someone whoknows how to have enough. Once you know how to be content in this way,you will realize that this is itself the greatest wealth one can have.When you want the profound teachings, follow a master well-versed in them.The highest teachings, such as those of the Great Perfection, are the mostprofound and quintessential teachings in Buddhism. If we wish to practicethem, we have to rely on a teacher who has a real knowledge of these teach-ings.

They will not lead you to practice genuinely, andthere will be no growth in your experience or realization. So you must firstbe diligent in listening to the teachings. Then, having received them, goover the instructions point by point, and clear up any doubts you have con-cerning their meaning. Finally, integrate them and make them a directinner experience. Having done this, go to a secluded place and make a firmcommitment: “From now until I attain enlightenment I shall do nothingbut put these instructions into practice.”When you meet a truly knowledgeable master, do all you can to please him and never upset him.By doing so, you will gain all the qualities of his knowledge.If you are able to please your teacher through your practice, you willmake progress on the path.

Because Naropa and Milarepawere convinced that their teachers were fully enlightened Buddhas, theydid not have a single doubt. They followed their masters’ instructions tothe letter, and for this reason they were able to attain enlightenment them-selves. If your teacher asks you to do something that you think is too bur-densome or beyond your ability—even though it accords with the Dharma—and you fail to implement his advice, it will be an obstacle to your prac-tice and will prevent your obtaining the qualities of realization.

In the process, we are diverted into wanting to becomerich and receiving offerings that are stained by wrong attitudes. So ratherthan remaining in a place with lots of people to distract you, stay alone, bediligent in the practice and be content with the little you have. Then youwill have no obstacles to your practice. You will find contentment in thislife and finally attain ultimate bliss, enlightenment.Thus attachment and aversion will not arise:With no one to keep you company, there is no attachment or aversion.Since sentient beings’ desires are never satisfied,It is impossible to make everyonehappy—even the Buddha couldnot do so—so stop trying to please people.Even when Lord Buddha was alive, there were non-Buddhist teacherswho criticized him, who were not satisfied with his teachings, found faultwith them, and developed wrong views. So if the Buddha was not able tokeep everyone happy, how can we ordinary beings ever hope to do so?

We have only asuperficial understanding but no sound realization, and we completelymiss the crucial point of the view, which is the very root of attainingenlightenment. Instead of inner realizationone repeats others’ words,such as the sayings of scholar-siddhas that describe the view,without having transformed one’s own being.The meditation gets lost in idiot meditation.Unless we have clarified all our doubts and uncertainties concerninghow to meditate, we may become complacent with only a vague, begin-ner’s experience of sustained calm.Without profound insight one does not destroy the foundation, afflictive emotions: experiences and realization cannot take birth.It is necessary to combine sustained calm with the view of profoundinsight, of emptiness, where there is no clinging. Otherwise, without pro-found insight, we can only crush the afflictive emotions somewhat, but wecannot eradicate them, and even if we spend many years in a mountainretreat, our practice will not give rise to meditative experiences and real-ization.As a result of having failed to realize the view,The action strays into wild, inappropriate conduct.Acting in ways contrary to the Dharma, one behaves like a madman.Without having gained firm confidence in the view, we engage inii. discipline /125Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 125"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"improperly considered actions, adopting a sham of Mantrayana conductand thinking it is all right to drink beer, eat lots of meat, womanize, and soon.

In fact, the vaster our realization of the absolute nature becomes, themore clearly we understand the need for these two. It is said that even whenwe reach the stage where there is no difference between the meditation andpostmeditation, we must still engage in practices that require effort. Westill have to continue practicing in four sessions and so on, because ourview may be as high as the sky but our conduct must be down to earth andas fine as flour.The samaya gets lost in being undervalued.We apply a measure to the samaya, thinking that we will keep the samayaup to a certain point beyond which there is no need to observe the minordetails. But it is wrong to imagine that keeping the samaya is easy, that oneneed only keep the root samayas and that the branch samayas do not mat-ter and can be overlooked.Without knowing the precepts to be observed, one disdains thesamaya, thinking there is no harm in spoiling it up to a point.The master is treated as one of one’s own.Thinking of him as an uncle,79one fails to develop faith or respect.Instead of seeing the teacher as the Buddha in person, we have the samefeelings for him as we do for our family and friends.

As a result, his blessings can-not enter us.The disciple attends teachings unwillingly.If you listen to keep others happy or for fear of people criticizing, you will never understand the teachings.126/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"We attend the teachings unwillingly, without any real motivation savethat of being concerned about other people’s opinions of us (if we do notattend, they might think that we are not interested).

In eithercase, we are not deeply concerned with listening to the teachings, reflect-ing on them, and putting them into practice.The practice is left for when one has the leisure.By falling under the power of sleep and indolence, one will neverobtain the result.We practice the Dharma when we are in a happy frame of mind and ourbody is relaxed and comfortable, but at other times we drop it. However,Jetsun Milarepa said, “There’s a long way to go, so practice without alter-nating between periods of being energetic and tense and of being loose andrelaxed.” For if we keep taking up the practice and then dropping it likethis, we will not obtain the result—experience and realization.One’s experiences are ghost sightings.Like a clairvoyant, one sees spirits and thinks of them more and more.We become one of those people who can see nonhumans—ghosts, spir-its, celestial beings, and the like—and instead of pursuing realization of theview and experiences in the practice, we lapse into thinking we are seeingghosts and claiming that the dakinis have given us various predictions andso forth; we finally become obsessed by all these spirits and celestial beings.Such things are of little value in gaining realization, and when we becomeproud of them, they act as obstacles and are the sign of the demon. As thesaying goes, “Obstacles are the sign of the demon; increase and decreaseare the signs of meditative experiences.” For it is the nature of experiencesthat they come and go.The result of the practiceis the achievement of worldly fame.The attachment and aversion of the eight ordinary concerns increaseand one is no different from ordinary people.ii. discipline /127Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 127"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Instead of undoing the fetters of the afflictive emotions in our mindsand giving birth to the wisdom of no-self, which is gained through sus-tained calm and profound insight, we err into running after worldly fame.We think, “I have spent years in solitary retreat.

I have completely destroyed the eight ordinary concerns.” Andwhen we let others believe this, we start to gather a large following of dis-ciples and to accept offerings and respect. This leads to many faults andtakes us further and further away from the Dharma, while the eight ordi-nary concerns increase more and more.One receives the instructions inauthentically.Without serving the teacher or putting the teachings into practice, one relies merely on having the texts and receiving the transmission.Thus one does not throw oneself with real diligence into experiencingthe practice.80We receive teachings but only superficially and not as suitable vesselswho will be able to practice them in the right way and subsequentlybecome holders of the teachings.

We will not have used thishuman existence to practice in accordance with the teachings: obtaining itwill have been meaningless.At death, one dies with regrets.While we are alive, we might think that we have understood the view,that we are meditating on emptiness, that we are practicing the Great Per-fection. But as it is said, “It is when practitioners have to face situations thattheir hidden faults show up,” and in the face of death our shortcomingswill become all too clear.

If we simply take it for granted that there has been no breachof samaya and that everything is pure and correct, we will be stained bysamaya breaches ourselves.

One will be able to reach the level of the yoga that is like aflowing river—meaning the practice will never have any interruption.Likewise, if one can maintain concentration day and night,This is the blessing of the mind, as exemplified by the middle of agreat river.Karma and afflictive emotions will not be able to interrupt this contin-uous flow of concentration.Like the black jackal, whose eyes see as well by night as by day, one isintroduced to the nonduality of perceiver and perceived.Having been introduced to the absolute nature, which is free from a sub-ject that perceives and an object that is perceived,This is the blessing of the realizationof nonduality, as exemplifiedby a jackal.Now, by recognizing that appearances are the mind, the mind is empty, emptiness is nondual, and nonduality is self-liberating, one clears away all misconceptions about the outer, inner, secret, and absolute.In the process of recognizing the nature of one’s mind, the natural stateof mind, we begin by saying, “outer appearances are the mind.” In otherwords, whether we perceive outer phenomena as pure or impure, in bothcases they are the projection or product of our own minds. Outer objectsare not inherently pure or impure. Next, when we turn inwards and exam-ine the mind carefully, we cannot find any color, shape, or location for thismind: it is what we term “empty.” Yet these two—outer phenomena thatappear and mind that is empty—are not two separate things like the twohorns of a goat. They are united: the mind appears as the perceptions ofphenomena yet it is empty; it is empty yet it appears. Moreover, the real-ization of this intrinsically nondual nature of appearance and mind is itselffree from grasping at the notion of nonduality. It is important to know howiii. concentration /155Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 155"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"to let this natural liberation of nonduality take place: if we cling to the con-cept of emptiness, we have to liberate that clinging to emptiness; if on theother hand we cling to appearance, we should let that clinging dissolve. Inthis way, we should dispel all misunderstandings and doubts about therealization of the different levels of emptiness: outer emptiness, inneremptiness, secret emptiness, and absolute emptiness.However, this alone is not much help if you have not liberated yourown mind into the absolute nature, just as ice, despite being water,does not function as water unless you melt it. So it is important tomeditate with intense devotion.The result of dispelling all misconceptions and doubts is that everythingis liberated in the absolute nature. But unless you can free this mind, whichhas attachment and aversion, in the absolute nature, it will not help sim-ply to think, “appearance is empty, emptiness and appearances are one.”Your mind will be like ice. Although the ice that forms when water freezesin winter is essentially water, it does not behave like water. Until you meltit, it is hard and sharp; water is soft and fluid. Ice can support the weightof objects; water penetrates and always flows down to the lowest point. Soit is important to meditate with intense devotion to the teacher. If you havefervent devotion, the blessings will enter, and it will be easy to travel thepath to liberation.Although a yogi currently on the path has truly realized the absolutenature of his mind, he has not yet liberated all phenomena in theabsolute nature, and so qualities such as the twelve hundred qualitiesdo not manifestly appear. Nevertheless, through gradual habituationto that realization, all phenomena are liberated or dissolved into theabsolute nature, and at that time all the qualities up to the level ofultimate Buddhahood become manifest.As a result of the teacher’s introduction, a yogi currently on the pathrealizes that the buddha nature is something that is truly within him. Withthe confidence of that direct realization of the ultimate nature of the mind,all subjective perceptions are liberated into the space of the absolute natureand the yogi actualizes what is called “liberating whatever arises as greatwisdom.” Someone who has seen the truth104gains twelve hundred quali-ties such as the ability in one instant to have a vision of one hundred Bud-dhas, to enter into and arise from one hundred concentrations, to turn one156/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"hundred wheels of the Dharma, and so on. These qualities are not mani-fest at present because one is obscured by the net of the body, but as thepower of the view of emptiness increases, they become clearer and clearer.This is why it is taught that while we are ordinary beings, as at pres-ent, our realization can both increase and decline. From the attain-ment of the first level onwards, realization increases but does notdecline. On the level of Buddhahood it does neither.We who are now on the path fluctuate in our practice. Our realizationis not stable, and our practice increases and declines alternately. When youmake some progress and realization and experiences are on the rise, do notbe influenced by pride and conceit. When your practice declines, do not bediscouraged and think, “I will never learn to meditate.” Eventually the alter-nation of growth and decline becomes exhausted and, having completedthe paths of accumulating and joining, one reaches the path of seeing.From that point onwards and until the tenth level one’s realization ofemptiness becomes vaster but it does not decline. Finally when one reachesthe ultimate level, the level of Buddhahood, it does not increase either. Atthat point there is no decline, for there are no defects, neither is there anyincrease, for the development of qualities has reached its culmination.✦✦25 ✦✦Showing, by means of illustrations, how using things as the path helps the meditation.The understanding of the absolute nature is something that has to be prac-ticed with one-pointed concentration. How we practice will now beexplained by means of illustrations.Son, there are four instructions for using things as the path.As it is said in the Six Prerequisites for Concentration:On account of material possessions one suffers.To own nothing is supreme bliss.By abandoning all its food,105The pelican becomes ever happier.For someone engaged in a life of contemplation, possessions and mate-iii. concentration /157Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"rial things are simply a disturbance, a cause of difficulties. To have no pos-sessions is supreme bliss. When we have nothing, we have no enemies. Weare happy because we do not have the problem of first acquiring wealth,then protecting it and trying to increase it. As we find in the saying:Base your mind on the Dharma,Base your Dharma on a humble life,Base your humble life on the thought of death,Base your death on an empty, barren hollow.106So if we give up all possessions, practice becomes very easy and we willfind sublime happiness, like the pelican. The pelican can collect a lot of fishin its bill, but it is prey to being chased by other birds that try to make itgive up its catch. It does not get a moment’s peace until it surrenders thefish to its pursuers. But once it has done so, it is much happier. Similarly,when we have no possessions, we are free to remain comfortably at ease.On the other hand, with possessions we become preoccupied with havingmore, and we worry that we might lose them to enemies and thieves.Accordingly,Make freedom from attachment the path, as exemplified by thepelican carrying fish.Now, in order to actually progress on the path we have to be free fromafflictive emotions, for it is afflictive emotions that bind us in ignorance.Since afflictive emotions can arise as primal wisdom,Make the five poisons the path, as exemplified by the recitation ofmantras over poison.This does not refer to the ordinary emotions as they normally presentthemselves. It refers to finding their true nature, the ultimate nature ofwisdom in the depth of these afflictive emotions. Once wisdom has trulyarisen within us and we recognize the empty nature of the afflictive emo-tions, they cannot harm us, just as when an accomplished yogi recites amantra over poisoned food, the poison is rendered harmless. By recog-nizing the empty nature of the afflictive emotions, they are liberated aswisdom and we can use them as the path. If we experience afflictive emo-tions in the ordinary way, they can only bind us down in samsara. But if158/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"we can recognize these emotions as wisdom, they will become helpers inour practice.Now afflictive emotions arise in the mind by means of the eight con-sciousnesses.If we recognize the eight consciousnesses as unborn, we cut the root ofexistence, the notion of a self.This idea of a self, the thought of “I,” is the very root of samsara. It is thisthat has to be cut. When a tree is cut at the roots, there is no need to cutthe branches, leaves, and flowers: they all fall at the same time and dry up.At present we have not been able to realize that the eight consciousnessesare unborn and we have therefore been unable to cut the belief in an “I” atthe root. But once we know how to get rid of this notion of an “I,” thenwhatever happens to us—suffering, happiness, attachment, or revulsion—it will all help our practice progress:Make the unborn nature of the eight consciousnesses the path, asexemplified by cutting a fruit tree at the roots.The unborn absolute nature is completely empty, like space, unstainedby relative phenomena such as the notions of permanence or nihilism thatconstitute wrong views. The view of this absolute, spacelike nature isunblemished by such extremes, like the lotus flower, which grows abovethe surface of the lake and is unstained by mud:As the unborn absolute nature is unaffected by relative phenomena,Make the great purity the path, as exemplified by the lotus growing from the mud.✦✦26 ✦✦Showing by means of illustrations how knowledge helps the meditation.Son, here are instructions on four things to be known.If you are to meditate with one-pointed concentration, you need to knowclearly what you have to meditate on.All phenomena in samsara and nirvana are devoid of true existence.iii. concentration /159Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"At present we perceive samsara as something we have to reject and nir-vana as something we have to attain. Now while this is correct accordingto relative truth, according to absolute truth the nature of the afflictiveemotions and actions that we are supposed to reject is nothing other thanemptiness, and the nature of the kayas and wisdoms we have to achieve isalso nothing other than emptiness. When we realize the dharmakaya,which is free from true existence, we will know that all perceptions are sim-ilar to a dream or an illusion and we will no longer crave these phenom-ena. As it is said, “While there is attachment, there is no view.”107Andabsence of attachment is the supreme view.Know freedom from attachment, as illustrated by the magician,for a magician knows that the things he has created do not exist truly andhe is therefore not attached to them.When you ascertain the nature of all phenomena, everything comesdown to the truth of emptiness. The entities of samsara that have to berejected are emptiness; the qualities of nirvana that have to be attained areemptiness. Their emptiness is not of different kinds: phenomena have thesame all-pervading nature, the one taste in multiplicity, the sole essence.Therefore,As phenomena and their nature are not two separate things,Know indivisibility, as illustrated by sandalwood or the musk deer.Sandalwood cannot be separated from its fragrance, nor the musk deerfrom its smell. It is in this same way that you should recognize the essen-tial indivisibility of samsara and nirvana.Since there is no relying on conditioned phenomena with characteristics,Know that relatives deceive, as illustrated by being let down by a friend.One cannot rely on the conditioned things of samsara like fame, wealth,rank, and so forth. There are no relative phenomena in samsara and nir-vana on which one can depend. It is important to know this. If, for exam-ple, you are traveling to a distant land in the company of a friend who thensomehow lets you down, you will realize you can no longer trust that160/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"friend. In the same way you should know that attachment to relatives andfriends is simply a cause of deception. Free yourself from clinging and donot rely on such things.Since the absolute nature has been present in you from the beginning,Know inseparability, as illustrated by a sesame seed or the flame of a lamp.The absolute nature has been constantly present within you since thevery beginning. It is not something that you have been given by the tea-cher’s blessings, like a gift. Nor is it something that has been changed fromsomething else, like a square of woolen cloth that is dyed a different color.It has not been newly fabricated. Rather, it is like the oil in a sesame seed:despite the sesame seed’s tiny size, there is always oil present in it. Or likethe flame of a lamp: whatever the size of the flame, the light it gives out isnaturally part of it. In the same way, you should know that none of thequalities of nirvana is ever separate from your essential nature.When one knows this, the bonds of belief in true existence and dualistic concepts are loosened by themselves, and immaculate wisdom is born in one’s mind.✦✦27 ✦✦Showing by means of illustrations how the crucial instructions helpthe meditation.Son, there are four crucial instructions.Although the creative power of the empty absolute nature appearsmultifariously, from the moment phenomena manifest they have no inherent existence: appearance and emptiness are united.Because everything is by nature empty, infinite manifestations can arise:from the natural creative potential of emptiness all the phenomena of sam-sara and nirvana can manifest as an infinite display. Although all thesemanifestations arise, it is not as if they are permanent when they are thereand impermanent when they are no longer there. Everything arises as in adream or like a magical illusion. It is like a rainbow, which, though itappears clearly in the sky, is not solid. It is apparent yet empty. But itsiii. concentration /161Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 161"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"emptiness and its appearance are not two separate aspects. It is not that therainbow being present is one aspect and its being empty is another. Therainbow is simultaneously apparent and empty, and there is no otheremptiness than the rainbow itself. The same is true for all the phenomenaof samsara and nirvana: they are empty from the very moment they appear.You need the crucial instruction that shows how to make a clear-cut decision regarding the unobstructed nature of appearances, as illustrated by a clean silver mirror.108Take the example of a mirror. If you take a silver mirror and polish itthoroughly, many images will arise on its surface. But though they appearclearly on the surface, they are not in the mirror nor are they sticking to themirror’s surface. We cannot say that they are inside the mirror or outside.How then do they arise? It is simply the conjuction of there being, say, some-one’s face in the front of the mirror and the mirror being there. As a resultof these different conditions, an image appears. Now anyone can under-stand that, although all sorts of images appear in a mirror, they do not existin any solid way. But we have to understand that the same is also true for allthe infinite manifestations of samsara and nirvana. The emptiness and themanifestation are indivisible: the emptiness cannot be separated from themanifestation. When we speak of emptiness and appearance, this does notmean that there are two things in the same way that we talk about the twohorns of an animal. It means that there is no emptiness besides the mani-festation and there is no manifestation besides emptiness. Once we are freefrom clinging to this sort of duality, our concepts of existence and nonex-istence will naturally fall apart. It is important to have a clear understand-ing—free of doubts—of this unimpeded manifestation.When one is not bound by clinging to what is not two as being two,phenomenal characteristics are freed by themselves.You need the crucial instruction on not being bound by character-istics, as illustrated by a prisoner who has been released.A prisoner who has just been set free is very concerned not to do any-thing wrong that might put him back in jail again. We should be similarlymindful and vigilant so that we are not bound by concepts of existence,nonexistence, eternalism, or nihilism; otherwise, we will be seriously tieddown by ignorance.162/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 162"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"What is the crucial point here? It is to know the meaning of the unbornnature of the mind. The mind does not have a color, shape, location, or anyother characteristics. So although there is nothing solid and no character-istics on which to meditate, once you have gained stability and confidencein the realization of the unborn nature of mind, do not stray into distrac-tion and wander from that recognition even for an instant. Simply remainin the state of nongrasping, which is free from mental activity.Although there is not even an atom to meditate upon with regard tothe unborn nature of your own mind, do not be distracted for aninstant. Be free from mental activity and conceptualization:This is the crucial instruction you need on not being distractedfrom the unborn nature, as illustrated by shooting an arrowstraight at the target.By aiming an arrow very straight, one is certain to hit the target. Like-wise, when the realization of the unborn nature is aimed at the target ofgrasping at a self, it is impossible for it not to hit the mark.With the realization of the triple space, do not move from the insepa-rability of the absolute space and awareness.There are three spaces: the outer space, the blue sky, which is like anornament;109the inner space, which is the nature of the mind; and the spacein between, the space in the eye channels that connects the outer and innerspaces. When these three spaces are blended together, one realizes theinherent union of the empty aspect, the absolute expanse, and the clarityaspect, one’s awareness. Do not waver from that understanding.You need the crucial instruction on resting in one-pointed concen-tration, as illustrated by an ophthalmic surgeon.110When people with an eye disease that is making them go blind find adoctor who can treat them, they listen carefully to the doctor and do every-thing necessary for the treatment to succeed. As a result of the treatment,their eyes open and they can see the mountains and all the other beautifulthings in the universe. If we listen in the same way, with one-pointed atten-tion, to our teacher’s instructions and practice them exactly as he tells us,one day our eyes will open and we will see the absolute nature just as it is.All the deluded perceptions of samsara and nirvana will clear by them-iii. concentration /163Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 163"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"selves, for they are, after all, groundless by nature, unborn and empty. Thenall our dualistic concepts of existence, nonexistence, and so forth will nat-urally fall apart.By this means deluded perceptions, being groundless, are cleared awayand phenomenal characteristics fall apart by themselves.✦✦28 ✦✦Personal advice on how to cut conceptual constructs regarding mental and extramental phenomena.Son, there are four “cuts.”111Whatever dualistic thoughts arise, there are none that are anythingother than the absolute nature.Cut the stream of the arising of dualistic thoughts and the following after them, taking the example of a tortoise placed on a silver platter.Of the many thoughts that arise in our minds, good or bad, none of themmove away and separate from the absolute nature for even a moment. Theyare like a tortoise placed on a silver platter: it finds the feeling of the smoothsilver surface underneath it so pleasurable that it does not move at all. Soif we never depart from the absolute nature, even when thoughts arise inour mind, there will be no way they can chain together and give rise to delu-sion. Normally, when we think of something in the past, it leads to anotherthought, which again leads to the next thought, and we project into thefuture, creating an uninterrupted chain of deluded thoughts with eachthought triggering the next. If we follow such chains of thoughts, they willnever stop. But if, whenever a thought arises, we remain in the absolutenature without wavering, the flow of these thoughts will naturally cease.Whatever appears, nothing has moved from the absolute nature.Decide that nothing is extraneous to the absolute nature, takingthe example of gold jewelry.Once we know how to remain in the absolute nature, the manifoldthoughts that arise in the mind are no different from gold jewelry. One can164/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"make all sorts of things out of gold, such as earrings, bracelets, and neck-laces, but although they have a variety of different shapes, they are all madeof gold. Likewise, if we are able to not move from the absolute nature, how-ever many thoughts we might have, they never depart from the recogni-tion of the absolute nature. A yogi for whom this is the case never departsfrom that realization, whatever he does with his body, speech, and mind.All his actions arise as the outer display or ornament of wisdom. All thesigns one would expect from meditating on a deity come spontaneouslywithout him actually doing any formal practice. The result of mantrarecitation is obtained without his having to do a large number of recita-tions. In this way everything is included in the recognition that nothing isever extraneous to the absolute nature.In that state one does not become excited at pleasant events or depressedby unpleasant ones. Everything,The whole variety of joys and sorrows, is one within the state of awareness.Decide on its indivisibility, taking the example of molasses and its sweet taste.We usually think of molasses as one thing and sweetness as another, andwe therefore have two names and concepts for these. But in fact it is impos-sible to separate the sweetness from the molasses itself. If we reach a sim-ilar clear-cut understanding that all phenomena in samsara and nirvana,all happiness and suffering, are included in the absolute nature, thenAll of samsara and nirvana arises from the creative display of the spontaneous primal wisdom.Decide that it is naturally manifesting awareness, taking the example of the moon in the sky and its reflection in water.When the moon shines on a lake, it is reflected on the water and themoon appears in its reflection exactly as it appears in the sky. Similarly,when we have a glimpse of awareness, it is what we call the illustrative wis-dom: it is an image of the actual wisdom, something that we can point toas an example of it. Even though it is only a glimpse, it is still of the samenature as the absolute wisdom, a true likeness of it. Through the recogni-tion of this illustrative wisdom, one is led to the recognition of the absoluteiii. concentration /165Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 165"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"wisdom,112which is like the moon in the sky. Both arise by themselves, andwe should understand clearly that there is no basic difference between theillustrative wisdom and the ultimate awareness or absolute wisdom. It is,rather, a question of one’s realization becoming vaster, of one becomingmore skilled in one’s recognition. Just as there is no difference in naturebetween the moon seen in the water and the moon seen in the sky, so it iswith the illustrative wisdom and the absolute wisdom.✦✦29 ✦✦Showing how dealing properly with samsara and nirvana helps themeditation.Son, there are four views.The essential nature being union, its display is arrayed as an orna-ment.View thoughts and appearances as the ornament of the absolutenature, taking the example of a rainbow adorning the sky.As we have already seen, the essential nature is the intrinsic union of empti-ness and appearance. All the infinite manifestations of samsara and nir-vana arise spontaneously as the creativity of the absolute nature. They ariseas its ornament and not as something different and separate from theabsolute nature or as something that interferes with it. When a rainbowappears in the sky, beautiful and multicolored, the sky is empty but therainbow appears in it like an ornament. Similarly, for a yogi who has real-ized the wisdom of the absolute nature, all manifestations appear as itsornaments. All thoughts appear as ornaments of the absolute nature, andthere is nothing, no meditational defect such as dullness or excitement,that can obstruct it.When one knows thoughts to be the absolute nature, attachment andaversion are put to death,and one no longer accumulates karma.View thoughts as the absolute nature, taking the example of tempering and honing a sword.With a sword that has been tempered and carefully sharpened, one cancut the toughest branches and even the trunk of a tree. Similarly, if the166/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"mind is tempered with the absolute nature, any thoughts that arise will besevered by themselves. As a result,There are no traces accumulated as habitual tendencies,and the tendencies of good and bad karma will not be perpetuated.View thoughts as leaving no trace, taking the example of birds flying in the sky.With a bird that flies all over the sky, this way and that, it is impossibleto point out exactly where it has flown, for it leaves no trace of its flight. Fora yogi, too, the many various thoughts, good or bad, that arise in his mindleave no trace because as soon as they arise they immediately dissolve in theabsolute nature. Thoughts related to attachment, aversion, and bewilder-ment may well arise in his mind, but since they dissolve as soon as they arisethey do not leave any trace. As a result, they do not lead to the accumula-tion of karma and suffering. Good thoughts also, like faith, devotion, andcompassion, may arise but immediately dissolve in the absolute nature andtherefore do not lead to pride or attachment developing in the mind.Phenomena are freed in the absolute nature.View existence as untrue, taking the example of waking from a dream.In a dream one dreams of all sorts of things good and bad; but whenone wakes up, there is nothing left of them. Just so, the whole display of theuniverse and beings continues to manifest infinitely; but once we have real-ized the absolute nature, we do not cling to notions such as good and bad,and we view all these manifestations as being without any solid existence.✦✦30 ✦✦Explaining the actual method of resting in meditation.Son, there are four kinds of meditation.Bringing together everything that favors concentration and masteringthe crucial point of how to rest in meditation, diligentlyMeditate with increasing habituation, taking the example of thewaxing moon.iii. concentration /167Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"In order for the realization of this absolute nature to dawn, we need to gatherfavorable conditions—to be free from conditions that break up the medita-tion and from distraction and grasping. Unless they are free from distrac-tion, beginners who try to meditate will not benefit much. Moreover it isimportant to find the right balance between being too tense and too relaxed.If we are too tense, we will suffer from disturbances of the subtle energiesand the mind will become unbalanced. If we are too relaxed, we will lapseinto ordinary states of mind. So we have to be well versed in the variousmethods of meditation. At the same time we need to have great diligence. Ifwe try to realize the absolute nature day after day, our realization will grad-ually become vaster and more stable, like the waxing moon, which growsfuller each day between the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month.This is the view of the Prajñaparamita (the Mother of the VictoriousOnes), the sphere of the inexpressible, inconceivable, supreme primalwisdom.The wisdom that we realize cannot be described. The more our realiza-tion grows, the more the qualities associated with it—spontaneous devo-tion and compassion—will bloom. And the emptiness aspect of thisabsolute nature is what we call the Mother of the Victorious Ones, that is,Prajñaparamita, who is the mother of all the Shravakas, Pratyekabuddhas,Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas.Meditate on thoughts and appearances as the inexpressible greatbliss, taking the example of having your mouth full of water.When one’s mouth is full of water, even if one wants to say, “Pet!,”113onecannot possibly do so. Similarly, when we realize the absolute nature,although the phenomena of samsara and nirvana are still experienced, itis impossible to express them in words. This is why Zurchungpa says,“meditate on great bliss.”Meditate that fame and the like—that is, the thoughts of the eight ordinary concerns—are not ultimately true, taking the example of mist, which doesnot truly exist.When the sky is full of mist in the morning, it seems as if there is some-thing veiling the sun, but in fact there is nothing one can catch hold of, and168/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"the mist does not affect the actual sky behind it. Similarly, practitionerswho have realized the absolute nature are not affected by the eight ordi-nary concerns: they do not crave fame and glory, and even if they happento get these, it does not make them proud. If they are criticized or blamed,they do not get depressed. Such things do not affect their minds. They arecompletely free from ordinary worldly concerns and they see everythingas in a dream, as an illusion. So they meditate seeing fame and related man-ifestations as impure—in the sense of irrelevant—like mist, which has notrue existence.Meditate on the uncontrived nature as empty, taking the exampleof water and bubbles;the nature of the mind is empty like space.In a river there may be many eddies and bubbles, but they are neversomething other than the water in the river. They are formed from water,they remain no different from water, and they again dissolve back into thewater.

The absolute nature is always present within them, like theempty space that is always present inside a bamboo stem.✦✦31 ✦✦Showing how conduct114should be endowed with experience and realization.Son, there are four kinds of conduct.In your conduct, turn your back on worldly ways: consider theexamples of a bride and a madman:in other words, make sure you are conscientious and considerate ofothers’ opinions, like an anxious newly-wed bride; do not act contraryto the Dharma like a madman who does whatever occurs to him.When a newly-wed bride arrives in her new home, she is very conscien-tious, well behaved, and concerned to create a good impression.115We p r a c -titioners should be just as careful in everything we do, and if we do thingscontrary to the Dharma, we should feel thoroughly ashamed, knowing thatiii. concentration /169Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"we are in the presence of the infinite Buddhas.

In the same way, the manifold appearances of samsaraand nirvana should be perceived as never having been extraneous to theabsolute nature.In your conduct, whatever appears—the five poisonous emotionsand so forth—should be primal wisdom: take the example of fireraging through a forest.In a forest fire, the stronger the wind, the further the fire spreads; themore wood it reaches, the more the fire blazes. And while the afflictiveemotions bind an ordinary person, for a yogi any thoughts that arise in hismind simply fuel his realization, which grows even stronger and clearer,because he experiences whatever appears as the display of wisdom.In your conduct, the many should have the single taste—phenomena and their nature or appearance and emptiness beinginseparable: take the example of salt dissolving in water.The absolute nature and relative phenomena are indivisible, as areappearance and emptiness, just as when salt dissolves in water, the saltinessand the water are completely inseparable.

What-ever the baby does, the mirror will reflect it. But the baby does not cling toit as being good or bad. Likewise, someone who is completely free fromclinging is not caught by notions of good and bad.The experience of wisdom taking birth where it has not previouslyarisen, as illustrated by a poor woman finding treasure:experience and realization are newly born.When a new experience or realization of wisdom arises in the mind, weshould be joyful, and the joy we feel should inspire us to even greater dili-gence in the practice, just as when a woman who is destitute finds treasureburied underground. She is overjoyed, knowing that for seven generationsto come there will be no need to worry about being poor, and she there-fore takes great care of the treasure she has found.The experience of neither apprehension nor esteem, as illustrated by a swallow entering the nestand a lion:one has gained decisive confidence.At one point we will gain a sense of certainty and confidence from hav-ing a clear idea of where we are on the path, of how antidotes work on theemotions, and of the view of emptiness. We will find that we have no hes-itation, like a swallow coming to the nest. Before building its nest, the swal-low looks carefully for a good site free from possible dangers. But once ithas built the nest, it flies straight to it, without any hesitation. Likewise, hav-ing carefully built up our meditation, we will reach a point where we haveno hesitation and we immediately recognize the nature of our experiences.Like the lion, the king of animals, which has no fear of other animals wher-ever it goes, a yogi has no apprehension, whatever experiences arise in hismind. At the same time, he is not proud or infatuated with his experiences.Neither does he esteem experiences, nor is he apprehensive about them.iii. concentration /171Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 171"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The experience of being unafraid of philosophical views, as illustrated by the lion who is not scared of the fox:there is no fear of the view and action of lower vehicles.When we have realized the absolute nature, we will not be tied by theviews and conduct of the lower vehicles.

When the vase is broken with a hammer, the space insideand the vast space outside blend as one and become indistinguishable.Appearances are recognized as being manifestations of the mind, like amother and child meeting.Once we have recognized that all outer phenomena are simply the self-manifestation of our own awareness or absolute nature, outer conditionedphenomena cannot deceive our inner absolute nature. This recognitionthat outer phenomena are our own projections is like a mother and childmeeting: between them there is certain recognition, without hesitation ormistake.When there is no effort,this isThe sign of the mind not getting involved in the pleasures of thesenses, as illustrated by a king seated on his throne.A king who has complete dominion over his kingdom has no need toactively increase his authority, nor to involve himself in the day-to-day run-ning of the state. Similarly, when we have confidence in the absolute nature,we will not be lured by attractions and sensory experiences outside. Themind will not run after objects of desire.

Other, ordinaryantidotes become irrelevant.If we are free from both the things to be rejected and the antidotesto beapplied, we will gain the confidence of a hawk. When a hawk sees a pigeonflying quietly through the forest, it does not hesitate for a second in swoop-ing down on its prey.

We cling to things that appear very beautiful or pleasant andfeel averse to things we cannot bear. As a result of being thus deluded by ourperceptions, we get involved in all sorts of different activities.We also cling to things that we believe to be other than what they are:As in the example of perceiving a rope as a snake,thinking it is, even though it is not,if you do not know that you are being fooled, you will wander.When one cannot see very well, one may mistake a rope for a snake andget a terrible fright—simply because one has not looked at the rope prop-erly. It is the same with the various desirable experiences we can have.Because we believe that they truly exist, we go to a great deal of trouble tofulfill our desires. Instead of recognizing the benefits of following a teacherand practicing the Dharma, we are fooled by our perceptions and so wewander endlessly in samsara.As in the example of the parrot eating poison(and, by thus imitat-ing the peacock, causing its own death),if you behave as if you have attained realization even though you havenot andyou cling to things thinking that they truly exist, you will wander.If we have not achieved the full realization of emptiness that allows us touse emotions as the path, and we try to perform activities that are thedomain of realized beings, we will go astray. Take the example of the pea-cock and the parrot. The peacock can eat poisonous berries, and doing soonly makes its plumage more brilliant. But if a parrot tries to do the same,it dies. Similarly, if we try to imitate the great siddhas in enjoying desirableexperiences, it will only tie us further to samsara, because we still have theconcept that the object of desire truly exists. Rather than enhancing ourpractice and serving to transform our afflictive emotions into wisdom, it willsimply result in our being obscured by our afflictive emotions and actions.iii. concentration /175Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Believing in existence where there is no existence, one is helplessly con-fused by attachment and aversion.As in the example of the child and the empty fisttricking it into thinking it contains a treat,116if you are fooled by your perceptions, you will wander in samsara.There are no phenomena that exist truly.

It comes from the mistaken belief that the universeand the beings in it truly exist. As a consequence of this dualistic clinging,we become very pleased with things like success, fame, praise, and gain, andget very upset by loss, criticism, and obscurity. For us the eight worldly con-cerns are all-important. At the root of this is the duality of the inner sub-ject, the grasping mind, and the outer object that is grasped. Because of thisgrasping relationship between subject and object we are attracted to thingsthat are pleasant and desirable and feel averse to anything that harms us,people’s criticism and so forth.

This is achieved through the practice ofsustained calm, which acts like a glass lantern protecting the lamp’s flamefrom the wind. This practice makes the mind more tranquil so that it is lessprone to being carried away by attachment and hatred. It is thereforeimportant to become skilled in the crucial point of letting the mind rest inconcentration. This entails avoiding any sorts of extreme. If you are tootense in trying to control the mind, your concentration will tire and yourenthusiasm for the practice will wane. On the other hand, if you relax toomuch, you will simply stray into an ordinary state. For this reason it is said:iii. concentration /183Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Tauten at times,Ease off at others:Here is a crucial point in the view.Do not be distracted from the expanse of the mind free of grasp-ing, like a straight arrow.There are four ways of meditating that concern practitioners who dothis sort of practice in mountain retreats. Regarding the first of these, inour ordinary state we conceive of phenomena and consciousness as trulyexisting. As long as we have such concepts, we are certain to accumulatekarma in samsara. If on the other hand we are able to recognize the unbornnature of the mind and be free from these concepts and fixations, and weremain without straying in the expanse of the mind that is free of grasp-ing, this is very powerful, like a perfectly straight arrow, which flies directlyto the center of the target.Without any mental grasping at the unborn nature,Do not be distracted from the absolute space, which is free fromthoughts, like a championathleteor like a painter of sacred art mixing his colors.At all times we should be aware of the unborn nature of the mind. How-ever, we must never cling to this unborn nature; we must remain com-pletely free. The point is to remain in the absolute nature, where there isno such thing as a meditator, an object of meditation, or an act of medi-tating. As long as one still has these sorts of notions and concepts, even ifone has a reputation as a “great meditator,” one’s meditation will not be inany way superior to the worldly concentrations.118So we must not strayfrom the absolute space, which is free from thoughts. “Thoughts” hererefers to the constant alternation of likes and dislikes, being pleased withfavorable situations and upset by unfavorable ones. Train in this total con-centration like a champion athlete training with bow and arrow or withthe sword. If he drops his mindfulness and vigilance and is distracted evenfor an instant, he will be struck by his opponent’s weapon.

We have tobe free from clinging to either of these extremes of existence and nonexis-tence. This cannot be achieved by intellectual fabrication.

It is not a question oftrying to isolate an empty aspect of the mind and to fix one’s mind on it,or of isolating a clarity aspect of the mind and clinging to that.

All these lead to actions, and that is how the wheelof samsara is set in motion.How should we let go of these clingings? By establishing the emptynature of the perceiving consciousness. Once we establish the emptynature of the mind, it is not that we cease to see objects, but rather that thesight of them no longer gives rise to clinging. Therefore, we no longer expe-rience the attraction and aversion that lead to delusion. Free of these cling-ings, we should remain in meditative equipoise, which only one’sself-awareness can experience. It is a state that is completely limpid andempty, like a vast open space, quite free from the stains of fixation. This isThe instruction on the state of mind devoid of all ordinary percep-tion and thought, like a dry skull,which has no eyes, ears, and tongue, and therefore has no ordinary percep-tions.Now for the actual instruction on the method of “resting,” which issixfold:It is said that in meditation an object on which one makes an effort tofocus is the prison of the view, so(1) Leave things effortlessly in the expanse free from references.In meditation, in which the yogi’s concentration is like the flow of ariver, the natural state unfolds. Through it we may have a glimpse of the186/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"absolute nature, and even though this glimpse is not full realization, wewill be sure that it is not something we have fabricated and that this naturehas been ours since the very beginning. Once you have recognized theabsolute nature, remain in it without modifying it in any way:(2) Leave everything without contrivance in the uncompoundedabsolute space.If we do not remain in that state of simplicity but make all sorts of fab-rications, these will obscure our recognition of the absolute nature. Con-stantly stirring water with a stick will never make the mud settle and allowthe water to become clear. But if the water is left as it is without being agi-tated, gradually all the mud particles will sink to the bottom leaving thewater perfectly pure, clear, and transparent. We should do the same withthe mind, leaving it in its natural state without interfering, without stirringit up with fabrications.(3) Though everything arises in your own mind, leave it without any notion of “I” or self.It is important to realize that all the phenomena of samsara and nirvanaappear as projections of your own mind, like the various reflections thatappear in a mirror. At the same time you must remain completely free ofany concept of a self. When the phenomena of samsara and nirvana appearin the mind, you should not grasp at them, thinking, “This is my mind,” or“This is the object,” or “I have perceived that object as beautiful (or ugly).”All perceptions should be left as they are without entertaining any notionof “I” or self.(4) Leave everything without conceptualization in the uncontrivedexpanse.The absolute nature is what we call the uncontrived state. This primor-dial, uncontrived nature is not a state that is blind to forms, deaf to sounds,and so on. On the other hand, it is completely free from attachment to whatis called beautiful and from aversion to what is called ugly. This means thatit is free from the notions of subject and object and the clingings associ-ated with these notions:(5) Leave things just as they are in the expanse free of subject and object.iii. concentration /187Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"(6) Leave things in the ineffable unborn expanse.By “unborn” we mean that this absolute nature is not something thathas come into existence at one point and may cease to exist at another. Itis completely beyond coming into existence and ceasing to exist. And it isnot something distant, that you have to search for far away: it is presentwithin the basic nature of your mind. How is this? If you do not prolongthe past thought and do not encourage a future thought to arise, if you lookbetween the past thought and the future thought that has not yet come andwatch the nature of the present moment, you can recognize the primor-dial uncontrived nature of the mind, which has always been within you.This is the wisdom free from thought, which is between the thoughts. It isliberation itself. When one is able to see this vivid state, this is what we callprofound insight, which is clear awareness.The instruction on the mind that, watching, sees nothing, like someone who has eaten poison.The example is that of the falling lines that appear to the eyes of someone who has eaten a poisonous plant. Its meaning is that by recognizing that the apparent objects of the six consciousnesses are devoid of reality one reverses the belief in true existence.People, and even animals, that eat the fruit or seeds of the plant knownin Tibet as thang tromexperience all sorts of hallucinations. All about themthey see scorpions, donkeys, and all sorts of terrifying beasts. Also, peoplewho suffer from phlegm disorders experience visual aberrations and seelines and dots and so on. All these are pure hallucinations, deluded percep-tions of things that have never truly existed. But our ordinary way of per-ceiving the six sensory experiences is no less deluded. We need to recognizethem as delusions, as devoid of any solid existence. Once we do so, we willbe free from our belief in the true reality of phenomena.The actual instruction concerns the primordial unborn nature and comprises six points:(1) The absolute nature is primordially unstained by clinging.This primordial nature is like the lotus flower, which grows out of themud but is not dirtied by it. Just as the lotus flower, with its beautifully col-188/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ored petals enclosing the anther and the nectar inside, is unsullied by themud, the primordial nature with all its qualities is completely unstained bythe dualistic clinging to subject and object.(2) The realization is naturally free from craving.It is free from the strong attachment to the eight ordinary concerns. Butthat freedom from attachment is not achieved by applying a remedy: crav-ing dissolves by itself, naturally.(3) The way of arising is spontaneous and free from grasping.It is something that happens on its own, unlike contrived meditation inwhich one makes an effort to maintain sustained calm and to preventdeluded thoughts from arising in the mind. It is the wisdom realization ofthe absolute nature arising spontaneously without trying to contrive it ortrying to control the mind.(4) The experience is naturally present and not something that is made.The wisdom of the absolute nature is always present and has been sincethe beginning. It is not something that has been made. And the experienceof the recognition of that natural presence is devoid of any clinging to therecognition itself.(5) The natural state is, from the very beginning, unborn andentirelydevoid of self.The recognition of the natural presence is not something to be soughtoutside. It is the natural manifestation of what is within us. Therefore,(6) The display arises spontaneously and is not something to be sought.If we adulterate appearances with our clinging, delusion will never cease.Therefore,For outer appearances not to be spoiled by inner clinging, there isThe instruction on the mind free from judgments, like an infant.iii. concentration /189Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Sometimes we think, “Today my meditation went well.

Babies do not feel attachment if somethingbeautiful is put in front of them, nor do they think of feeling afraid if theyare about to be killed by a butcher wielding a sword. They do not esteemgood, they do not distrust bad.The actual instruction:(1) The absolute nature is the uncontrived mind.The uncontrived mind is the Buddha’s mind. If we look at the uncon-trived nature of the mind, we will reach a state that is free from discursivethoughts:(2) The view is the mind without thoughts.It is the wisdom free from dualistic distinctions such as getting excitedabout good experiences and feeling uncomfortable about bad experiences:(3) The primal wisdom is the mind without concepts.It is the wisdom of the nondual mind.(4) The meditation is the undistracted mind.Although there is no particular object on which to focus, at the sametime the mind should not wander.(5) The essential nature of the mind is unwavering.When our recognition of that nature becomes quite steady, it does notwaver, like a mountain that is never moved by the wind. This is known as“leaving as-it-is like a mountain.”121(6) The samaya of the mind is the knowledge that nothing transcendsthe mind,for none of the phenomena that exist in samsara and nirvana ever pass out-side this absolute nature. When we realize that they are all the display ofthe nature of the mind, this is the true samaya of the mind.190/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"(7) The activity of the mind is not to give up—not to give up mindfulness in our actions, both in the meditation periodand the postmeditation period, until we attain complete and firm realiza-tion of the absolute nature. Only then will the meditation be free from thedefects of excitement and drowsiness.For leaving the consciousness just as it is, relaxed in its own state, there is:The instruction on leaving the mind as it is, as if stunned, like someone whose heart has been removed.The example is that of someone whose heart has been taken out: there is no hope of revival and the continuous stream of thoughts is cut. The instruction on “leaving as it is, as if stunned”122is that by leaving everything as it is in the uncontrived natural state—without a subject that leaves, without an owner, as if stunned—one will settle at ease, free of grasping and effort, in the arising of the multifarious phenomena.If one removes the heart from someone’s chest, there is no hope of hisremaining alive. Likewise when one has permeated all one’s perceptionswith the view of the absolute nature, delusion has no hope of staying.“Leaving everything as it is” means that one does not apply all sorts of fab-rications: one leaves things as they are in the mountainlike view. But it isnot that there is a subject that leaves and something that is left. There is noquestion of taking possession of the state of meditation and thinking, “Thisis my meditation” or “This is your meditation.” “As if stunned” implies thatthere is no owner. It is a neutral state in which there is a complete absenceof grasping. With all the myriads of perceptions that arise in the mind,there is no fixation or clinging to these perceptions. They are just left in acompletely relaxed state.In this natural state of the inseparability of the two truths, leave things in uncontrived simplicity, a state of clear, empty awareness that is not produced by effort through different causes and conditions.In short, the manifested aspect, which is the infinite display of phenom-ena arising interdependently in accordance with the laws of causality, is rel-ative truth.

It is the indivisible unionof clarity and emptiness, the absolute nature that is uncompounded anduncreated, the nature of the primal wisdom. That primal wisdom, whichis the essence of Buddhahood, has always been present in our minds, butin our present deluded condition it is obscured, like the sun obscured byclouds. However, from the point of view of that nature itself, there hasnever been any obscuration, just as from the sun’s point of view the sunhas never been obscured. Once this view of the absolute nature has beenrealized, it cannot be lost again, for it has always been there. Neither is itsomething that has to be looked for or acquired, because one has alwayshad it. It is free from discursive thoughts.Stay without thinking in the bliss that is not to be evoked and cannot slip awayfor the mind from the very beginning is not caught and is not fettered.In truth, the mind, since the very beginning, has never been caught orZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"tied. It is the primordial state of enlightenment, which has never beenbound or fettered. It is not something that one can lose, nor does one needto evoke it.Stay in vivid clarity, undistracted in the state beyond distractionfor distracting objects have never been extraneous to the absolutenature.Since even the objects of distraction remain within the absolute nature,it is impossible to stray from the absolute nature. This is the true undis-tracted state.How does one stay like that? There are six ways to be without contrivance:(1) If you look for mind, it is empty.At present, because we do not investigate things properly, we happilytake them for granted and assume that the mind actually exists. After all,the mind seems so powerful. With all its past, present, and future thoughtsit manages to accumulate so much karma. And yet, if we start to look forthe mind, it is impossible to find it anywhere—not in any part of the bodynor anywhere else. Neither is it possible to attribute to it any color or shape.If you look for the mind, you will only find emptiness.Nevertheless, despite its empty nature the mind does not stop producingthoughts. These thoughts must be recognized as being the mind’s naturalactivity, its creativity, like the light constantly given out by the flame of alamp. The reason we fall into delusion is because we fail to recognize that allthese thoughts are, in fact, nothing other than the display of the absolutenature. So you must not think that true meditation is an absence of thoughts,a calm state of extinction in which nothing arises at all. If your idea is toprevent thoughts arising, you will simply not realize the absolute nature:(2) Block it and you will spoil it.(3) Contrive it and you will adulterate it.If you try to fabricate this absolute nature, which has been there fromthe beginning, you will simply be mixing it with impurity, staining itwith defects.iii. concentration /193Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"(4) Meditate and you will be bound.In any purposeful meditation, where you have the concepts of a medita-tor and a meditation, you will be tied down by the very act of meditating.(5) Look at it and it will disappear.When you look at the nature of the mind, “there is no mind,” as it saysin the Prajñaparamita Sutras. You cannot find it; it vanishes, because thereis no true existence to be found in it.(6) Effort will obscure it.Therefore, do not seek, do not block, do not contrive, do not meditate,do not look, do not make effort: leave it just as it naturally is.There being nothing in the mind for it to act on, nor anything to dothrough the path of action, nor anything that is accomplished,Remain unhurried, with nothing to do, perfectly poised,123the practice neither overtaut nor slack, like the string of a bent bow.You should not say, “This is what I will meditate on,” for there is noth-ing—no definite object with characteristics—that you have to realize. Thisis because the nature of mind is uncompounded and empty. It is not pro-duced by any action, for it is primordially present. Simply remain in therecognition of this nature, watching it directly. Your practice should notalternate between sometimes being too tense and at other times being toorelaxed.

So recognize themind with this instruction—the natural dissolution of concepts:Relaxation is the crucial point of the mind, exemplified by some-one who has completed a task.What we call the fourth moment is that in which one does not followthe past thought, one does not invite future thoughts, and one is not atpresent distracted by anything. It is the fourth aspect of time that tran-scends those three moments. If you look into awareness, there is no objectto hold onto, neither any mind that clings. It is unstained by the conceptof subject and object. That direct experience is the natural dharmakayastate. With the spontaneous mindfulness of the absolute nature, as if thedharmakaya were looking at itself, one is neither narrowly concentrated asin the effortful mindfulness of sustained calm nor distractedly ordinary.This is the instruction for naturally dissolving concepts.Recognizing the mind in this way one reaches a state similar to that ofsomeone who has successfully completed an enormous task and is nowutterly relaxed and calm, not busying himself in any way. Likewise, whenthe mind sees its own nature, it is relaxed and does not make any deliber-ate effort.Being free from the clinging to the true existence of things, one has no concerns, thinking of things as good or bad:Freedom from concern is the crucial point of the mind,exemplified by someone who has recovered from an illness.It is important to be free from clinging to the true existence of things.Otherwise the mind will make distinctions—between good experiencesand bad ones, such as afflictive emotions and suffering.

A Buddha is someone who hascleared away all obscurations and therefore does not need to prevent afflic-tive emotions and so on, which are no longer present in him. Similarly, hehas all the qualities of the kayas and wisdoms, which are expressed natu-rally like the rays emitted by the sun, and so he does not need to deliber-ately accomplish or create these qualities. The crucial point, therefore, is tobe free of concepts and to not evaluate one’s meditation by wonderingwhether or not one is meditating correctly. Rather we should be like a madperson jumping off a precipice—without any hesitation.Everything that appears is liberated as primal wisdom, so the view isfree from duality, the meditation is free from fixation, the action is freefrom effort, and the result is free from aspiration.Freedom from expectation and apprehension is the crucial pointof the mind, exemplified by one’s havingmet a person one had beenlooking for.At this time, everything that arises through the six senses—visual, audi-tory, olfactory, gustatory, and so forth—will be understood as being thedisplay of wisdom and will therefore be liberated in its own wisdomnature.

The mind is by nature unborn, its display is unob-structed, its essential characteristic is absence of duality, and so on.

When one cuts a tree at the root, everything—thetrunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit—falls to the ground at the sametime. Similarly, if we cut ignorance at the root, the whole delusion of sam-sara will be instantly felled.How do we cut through delusion? From the point of view of the waythings appear, the ground—that is, our present condition when we starton the path—can be considered as impure, the path as a mixture of pureand impure, and the result as perfectly pure. But from the point of view ofthe way things are, there are no such things as pure and impure. Whatappears as impurity is simply an adventitious, temporary obscuration thathas no existence of its own. But fundamentally there is nothing that hasever become anything other than what it has always been, primordiallypure. The difference lies in whether or not this primordially pure nature isobscured. From its own point of view, the nature has not become worsewhen impurity is perceived; neither has it improved when purity is seen atthe time of the result. It is like space, which can contain all the differentuniverses, continents, mountains, and so forth and yet is not affected inany way by these things: it is not made better by things being beautiful, normade worse by things being ugly. Similarly, all the different phenomena ofthe ground, path, and result arise as the display of one’s mind, not affectedby concepts such as good and bad. By nature the mind is unborn, its dis-play is infinite and unobstructed, and its characteristic is the union of clar-ity and emptiness. This is how the nature of the mind is introduced, asbeing unborn, unobstructed, and free of duality. As it is said in the All-Accomplishing King, one of the Mind Section tantras, everything can bebrought back to the mind, because the root of delusion and nondelusionis to be found in the mind itself. It is this mind that will now be explained.Son, there are twelve points.The unborn ultimate nature of your own mind is not concealed anywhere and yetnobody can see it as a concrete object with characteristics.An ordinary being who uses the conditioned intellect to search for theunborn nature of the mind, the dharmakaya, will find that there is noth-ing to be seen. It is impossible to assign any characteristic to this nature ofthe mind in the same way that one attributes combustion and heat to fireor a tendency to stay at the bottom of its container to water.202/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 202"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Though it hasnever stopped being yourssince the very beginning,hitherto you havenot recognized it as your nature.In fact there is nothing to be seen, nothing to be sought, because themind has been with you from the beginning.

It is an example of ultimate beauty.Similarly, those for whom everything is backed by the realization of theunborn nature no longer have ordinary attachment and aversion, and suchpersons can therefore act like enlightened beings: whatever they do is bliss.Since they have fully realized the absolute nature, there is no question oftelling them, “This is the right thing to do; that is something you shouldnot do.” They have no concepts or limits, so they can act as they wish.Everything they do will be nothing but bliss.222/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 222"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Take the example of a smile and a scowl: two expressionsbut nomore than oneface.

But, whatever the expression, weare not talking about a different face. It is not degraded when smeared withthe dirt of samsara, neither is it improved when the dirt of samsara iswashed off. Samsara and nirvana remain within the expanse of theabsolute nature in the same way that the universe with its different conti-nents all appear in space.Take the example of a blind person: it makes no difference whetherone smiles at him or not. Similarly, since everything that arisesunobstructedly from the unborn absolute space is inseparable from itand has the same taste, in the absolute nature there is nothing to beadopted or rejected.If you smile at blind people, they do not think, “That person is happywith me.” If you frown at them, they do not think, “He is upset with me.”It is the same with phenomena: they are all of one taste, intrinsically one,appearing in an unobstructed way from the expanse of the unborn whileremaining inseparable from it. For this reason, in the absolute nature thereis nothing to adopt and nothing to give up.Take the example of the trunk of a plantain tree: it has no core.143Similarly, phenomenal existence has no essence,for when examined using such logical arguments as “Neither one normany,”144there is nothing to be found.The plantain tree is hollow inside: it has no solid core. It is also said thatit is without essence, in the sense that it bears fruit only once. If you ana-lyze phenomena with the aim of determining their ultimate nature, usingthe “neither one nor many” argument, you will find they have no true exis-tence.

One cannot, therefore, say that they exist.In relative truth,the appearance aspect that is the interdependent gathering of causes and conditions,they are unceasing, so they are beyond the extreme of nonexistence.This empty nature, the lack of intrinsic existence in phenomena, doesnot imply a blank naught in which there is nothing at all, as we find in theview of the nihilists. According to relative truth, all phenomena arise as aresult of the interdependent conjunction of causes and conditions. Thisenables us to explain not only how samsara is formed but also how it ispossible to progress toward nirvana. There is no contradiction between theabsolute nature and its infinite display and, because of this, one is free fromthe extreme of existenceand that of nonexistence.Ultimately, the two truths, or appearance and emptiness, do not existas distinct phenomena: there is no basis for such distinctions, they areinseparable—in other words, they are not two, so they are beyondthe extreme of both existence and nonexistence.One cannot say that the two truths are distinct or that appearance andemptiness are distinct, because if one examines the relative truth in depth,one arrives at the absolute truth, and it is within the absolute truth that therelative truth appears as its display.

So one must be freeof this extreme as well, the extreme of neither existence nor nonexistence.Regarding this there are four faults that occur if one asserts that thetwo truths are one and the same:Ultimately we must be free of all kinds of ontological extremes and pos-tulates. The two truths are neither two distinct things nor a single entity;they are beyond any concept of being one or two. To those who cling to theconcept of a single entity and say that the two truths are one and the same,excluding even the possibility of its having two aspects, it can be shownthat there are four faults in such an argument:(1) it would follow that ordinary beings who see compounded phe-nomena could see the absolute truth;If there were no difference whatsoever between absolute truth and rel-ative truth, this would mean that since ordinary beings can perceive therelative truth they must also be able to see the absolute truth. This is notthe case.(2) it would follow that the absolute truth could be an objective condi-tion for afflictive emotions arising;Relative phenomena are the causes for afflictive emotions arising, so ifrelative and absolute were the same, absolute truth would also be a causefor the arising of afflictive emotions. This is not the case.(3) it would follow that there was no distinction between relative andabsolute;If they were the same, there would be no way to recognize absolute truthas distinct from relative truth, and this too is not correct.iv. wisdom /225Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 225"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"(4) it would follow that the absolute truth would not depend on listen-ing to the teachings and reflecting on them.To experience the relative truth one does not need to practice theDharma or gain any experience in it, so if the two truths were exactly thesame, one would also be able to realize the absolute truth without listen-ing to the teachings, reflecting on them, and meditating: such things wouldbe unnecessary.And there are four faults that occur if one asserts that they are different,One might argue, on the other hand, that the relative truth and absolutetruth are essentially separate and distinct. Such an argument also has fourfaults,for it would then follow that:(1) the mind that had realized the absolute could not dispel the belief that relative phenomena truly exist;If relative and absolute were completely separate and unrelated, realiz-ing the absolute truth would not help to dispel our clinging to relative phe-nomena as truly existent. But in fact when one realizes the absolute truth,the belief in the true existence of relative phenomena is simultaneously dis-pelled.(2) absolute truth would not be the ultimate nature of relative phenomena;If they were separate things, the ultimate nature of relative truth couldnever be absolute truth. But in reality, when we examine the nature of rela -tive truth, we arrive at absolute truth.(3) the absence of intrinsic existence in relative phenomena would not be the absolute truth;The fact that the phenomena of relative truth have no true existence oftheir own isthe ultimate truth. So we speak of absolute truth in relation torelative truth.

We establish two truths in relation to the conditions, deluded or nondeluded, of a single mind: in the deluded state theabsolute truth does not appear to the relative, deluded mind, while in the nondeluded state the delusory relative does not appear to the mind that has realized the absolute truth. Thus the two truths are like light and darkness. On the one hand, they have one and the same nature but different aspects; on the other hand, their differences disallow their being one and the same. Both of these are explained in the Commentary.None of the above faults is to be found in our own tradition because wedo not subscribe to the views that see the two truths either as a single entityor as two distinct entities. All we are saying here is that the relative andabsolute truth are related to the condition of a single mind that is eitherdeluded or nondeluded. When it is deluded, this is the relative truth, andthe ultimate nature of things does not arise in the deluded mind. When theundeluded absolute truth is realized, the delusory perceptions of relativetruth do not arise. In this way relative and absolute truths are like darknessand light. One cannot have darkness and light at the same time. Likewise,relative truth and absolute truth, though fundamentally of the same nature,are simply two aspects, one obscured and the other enlightened, eachexcluding the other.

But when we meet with a qual-ified teacher, receive the teachings of the Great Vehicle, put them into prac-tice, and finally have the experience of recognizing the absolute nature, thetremendous joy and relief we feel is like that of the lost child if it were sud-denly to meet its mother. We should practice until we have that experienceof the absolute nature manifesting like the mother we had lost.In the intermediate state between birth and death one recognizes the primal wisdom as if one held up a torch in a dark cave.The intermediate state between birth and death lasts from the momentone is born until one dies. In order to destroy the delusory perceptions ofthis intermediate state we need to recognize the wisdom free from all delu-sion. This is like being cured of jaundice and seeing the whiteness of aconch as it has always been, or like lighting a torch in the darkness: even ifit is in a place that has been in total darkness for thousands of years, themoment one lights the torch all that darkness will immediately be dis-pelled.In the intermediate state of dream one recognizes everything thatappears as the mind, just as on an island of sages one would not find other beings even if one looked.When we fall asleep, the consciousness dissolves into the consciousnessof the ground of all and we experience deep sleep. From this state dreamsmanifest. We might dream that we become immensely rich, but when we258/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 258"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"wake up, we have not even a single needle and thread. We might dream thatwe have been installed on Indra’s throne, but we wake up only to find our-selves on our bed. All these dreams, whether good or bad, are simply theproduct of the subtle karmic energy that moves the mind. They are pro-jections of our own mind and nothing else. Just as one would never findany other kind of people on an island of sages even if one looked, one willnever find any dream appearances that are truly existent, that are anythingother than projections of the mind.In the intermediate state of concentration one makes clear what is not clear, like a model looking in a mirror.The intermediate state of concentration is the period between enteringmeditation and rising from it into the postmeditation period. It is impor-tant during this intermediate state to get rid of all mistakes in our concen-tration and to make clear what is not clear. This requires the attentivenessof a young woman looking in the mirror, examining her face carefully forblemishes so that she can remove them. Without a mirror she will neverfind those blemishes, even though they are on her own face. Similarly, forus the mirror of mindfulness is indispensable. Otherwise if we rise out ofmeditation and fall into delusion in our postmeditational conduct, thebenefit we gained through meditation will be lost. So, like the beautifulwoman looking in the mirror, during meditation we must check whetheror not we are straying into dullness or distraction, and during thepostmeditation period we must watch whether we are losing control, evenin the middle of acting very quickly.In the intermediate state of becoming one connects with one’s remaining stock of positive actions, like inserting a pipe into a broken irrigation channel.Between death and the next rebirth we have a mental body, which istossed about like a feather by the wind of karma, moving constantly fromplace to place. If in the life we have just left we started practicing theDharma and gained some experience and realization but did not attainultimate realization, it is now, in this intermediate state of becoming, thatwe must make a connection so that we can meet a teacher again and con-tinue our progress on the path.

First we must acquire the correct viewand gain complete conviction in it. Then we have to repeatedly make aninner experience of the view by means of what we call meditation, and thismeditation must be free from faults such as dullness and distraction. Inthis way we will reach a stage where the view and meditation are united. Ifwe do not have the correct view, however hard we try to meditate we willencounter problems and make mistakes. If on the other hand our view isperfectly sound, our meditation will naturally follow suit. But unless weobserve constant self-control in a place where there are no distractions, ourmeditation will be dissipated by external conditions. To help us avoidstraying from meditation, there are seven concentrations.260/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 260"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The concentration of the emptiness of the inner,that is, the consciousnesses of the sense organs, the eye being devoid of eye-ness, and so forth.The eye organ is what sees forms outside. The eye consciousness is what,on seeing forms, thinks of them as being beautiful or ugly and accordinglyclings to them or rejects them. Form is the object of the eye organ to whichit appears. If we think of what we see as truly existing, then clinging tobeautiful things and aversion to ugly things arise. But if instead we recog-nize that the object, the sense organ, and the consciousness are all threedevoid of true reality and we realize their emptiness, we will recognize theinner consciousness as empty, for it does not dwell outside, inside, or inbetween.The concentration of the emptiness of the outer,that is, the six objects, form being devoid of form-ness, and so forth.Recognition of the emptiness of forms outside is what we call the con-centration of the emptiness of outer phenomena, for outer phenomena—the whole universe and beings—are completely impermanent. Not onlywill they be destroyed at the end of the kalpa, but with the passing of theseasons, and even with every second that goes by, nothing remains thesame. This is equally true for the thoughts inside us. Past, present, andfuture thoughts seem to follow one another, but, when analyzed usingMadhyamika reasoning, they can be seen to possess not even a particle’sworth of existence. So when we realize that things outside are empty andthings inside are empty, all of our afflictive emotions will be naturally andcompletely destroyed.Regarding compounded phenomena there isThe concentration of the emptiness of both inner and outer,compounded phenomena, the container and contents,163or phenomena outside and the mind inside.And regarding uncompounded phenomena there isThe concentration of the emptiness of the uncompoundedabsolute.iv. wisdom /261Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 261"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Then there isThe concentration of the lion’s imposing demeanor,which overawes deluded perceptions.The lion is the king of animals, feared by all other animals, large andsmall.

This is why it is important to adopt the seven-point posture of Vairocana, to avoid pointless chitchat, and to keep themind from being excessively withdrawn or excessively dissipated in follow-ing external phenomena.Then visualize the channels and wheels165in the body, the container.As a support for concentration, use your own body, which is formedfrom the growth of the different channels. Within these channels the ener-gies flow, carrying the essence. The object of the practice is to bring aboutthe cessation of the impure channels, energies, and essence, which are per-meated with ignorance, and to let the wisdom channels, energy, andessence become manifest. The three main channels are the umain the cen-ter, the romaon the right, and the kyangmaon the left. There are also thefive wheels: the wheel of great bliss in the crown of the head, the wheel ofenjoyment in the throat center, the wheel of dharmas in the heart center,the wheel of manifestation in the navel center, and the bliss-preservingwheel in the secret center. Visualize these one by one. This is the medita-tion on the “outer fence of voidness” of the body.166Expel the poisonousenergies that are contained.The channels are like a path on which the energies travel. The impurekarmic energies associated with delusion are mixed with the three poi-sons—attachment, aversion, and bewilderment—and as they flowthrough the channels the afflictive emotions grow stronger and stronger.We therefore need to dispel these impure energies related to delusion, forif the energies can be purified, the qualities of wisdom will naturallyincrease. To do this, make a vajra fist with each hand and expel the poison-ous energies, first through the left nostril to expel the energy associatedwith attachment, then through the right nostril to expel the energy asso-ciated with aversion, and finally through both nostrils together to expel theenergy associated with bewilderment. Do this three times, or in greaterdetail nine times. This is like cleaning a vessel very thoroughly.Perform the physical yogic exercises, filling with the upper and lower energies and dispelling obstacles.There are two kinds of energy, or prana, referred to here. The upperiv. wisdom /263Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 263"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"prana, which passes through one’s nostrils and mouth, is the pranaassoci-ated with great bliss, the skillful means aspect. The lower prana, whichpasses through the lower doors, is that connected with emptiness, the wis-dom aspect. To train these two pranasthere are four steps. The first is toinhale. The second is to fill the “vase,” pressing the upper pranadown andbringing the lower pranaup so that they meet together in the region belowthe navel center. Hold the breath in this way as long as you can. When youcannot hold it any longer, take a small additional breath and turn the pranathree times on either side and three times in the middle, below the navel.This is the third step. Fourth, expel the prana, shooting it out like an arrow.While you are trying to train the pranalike this, various obstacles andproblems may occur, so in order to dispel these you should go through thedifferent yogic exercises or trulkhor. If you do this practice over a longperiod of time, the channels will be straightened, the energies will be puri-fied, and the door to the manifestation of wisdom opened.Rid yourself of other pointless thoughts, mental turbidity.To take an example, the mind is like a crippled person, the energy like ablind horse. Unless the horse is controlled by its crippled rider, it will takethe latter anywhere it likes—that is, the mind will be overpowered by wildthoughts. But once the cripple can control the horse, everything will comeunder control. So it is important to give up unnecessary wanderingthoughts, all those thoughts related to attachment and aversion that weconstantly follow and perpetuate, rendering the mind turbid like water ina muddy pool that has been stirred. Holding the breath in the “vase” exer-cise helps reduce these meaningless thoughts.Bring the mind into the one-pointed concentrationof bliss, clarity, voidness, and the like.Having dispelled the thoughts and purified one’s channels, energies, andessence, when one rests without wavering in the empty nature of the mind,three different experiences may occur: experiences of bliss, clarity, or void-ness, which correspond to the nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, and dharma-kaya, respectively. However, if these experiences are tinged with clinging,the bliss will lead to rebirth in the world of desire; the clarity, to rebirth inthe world of form; and the absence of thought, to rebirth in the world offormlessness. So while these three experiences will, and indeed must, occuras a normal result of progress on the path, when they occur, you must not264/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 264"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"have the slightest clinging to them but permeate them with the realizationthat they are completely empty.

But if we abandon them, that is the end of them.And however successful one may be at such activities, they are completelypointless for they are no exception when it comes to the four ends:The end of all gathering is dispersing,The end of all living is dying.The end of all meeting is parting,The end of all rising is falling.The more you become involved in such distracting activities, the longeriv. wisdom /265Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 265"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"you will continue to postpone the practice of Dharma.

Just as swallowing poi-son can have mortal results, if you harbor these afflictive emotions in yourmind, they will kill any chance of liberation and you will continue to wan-der in samsara. However, close examination of these poisons will revealthat they are nothing other than conditioned thoughts. As such, they areunborn, nondwelling, and unceasing. If you realize their empty nature,afflictive emotions will be unable to rear up in your mind.In short, if you give up all ordinary activities, by practicing the profound path with no conflict between your mind and the threetrainings you will temporarily and ultimately master infinite qualities, accomplishing your own and others’ welfare according to your wishes.All our different activities are projections of the mind, created by ourthoughts. If you follow these deluded thoughts, there will be no end to yourmind being upset by delusion, just as when the wind blows over the sur-face of a lake, the crystal clarity of the water is masked by ripples. It is there-fore important to control the mind by applying the view, meditation, andaction, both in meditation and in postmeditation, for major situations andminor ones.

Freedom from expectationand apprehension is the crucial point of the mind, exemplified by one’shavingmet a person one had been looking for.Uttering the specific language of Ati overawes those in the lesser vehicles.Freedom from fear is the crucial point of the mind, exemplified by a lionwalking among other savage beasts.The natural state is naturally radiant; no veils obscure it. Clarity withabsence of thoughts is the crucial point of the mind, exemplified by theflame of a lamp filled with sesame oil.✦✦40 ✦✦Showing that the view, meditation, action, and result are innate and notextraneous.Son, there are four things you need not seek.Since the wisdom of the absolute nature free of intellect dwells in you354/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 354"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"innately, there is no need to look for it anew using one-sided views that arethe product of the intellect. Having the view that has no dualistic fixation,do not seek one that has; take the example of the sun: it does not have tolook for its rays.Regarding the uncontrived natural flow, there is no need to meditate onit with dualistic fixation as if it were something new for you. Having themeditation that has no object on which to focus, do not seek one thathas; take the example of a wish-fulfilling gem: it does not have to lookfor the things one wants.Since things to be rejected and antidotes—afflictive emotions and primalwisdom, for instance—have the same taste, there is no duality of deed anddoer. Having the action free of adoption and rejection, do not seek one toadopt and reject; take the example of a person: he does not have to lookfor himself.The result, the primordial state of Buddhahood, dwells within you.Having the result free of hope and fear, do not look for one with hopeand fear; take the example of a monarch: he does not have to reassert hisroyalty—a king presiding on his throne depends on no one else.Thus, since all phenomena in samsara and nirvana are by natureinseparable, do not move from the evenness of the absolute nature that isbeyond hope and fear, concept and effort.These chapters on the superior training of the mind have been arrangedin a different order in the Commentaryas follows. After the thirtiethchapter come Chapters Thirty-six to Thirty-nine, at which point one jumpsto Chapter Seventy-seven in the section on the training in wisdom. Next,one returns to Chapters Thirty-one to Thirty-five, followed by ChapterForty. Here, however, I have followed the exact order of the root text.To sum up, I have used these chapters to give an explanation to suit read-ers’ individual capacities, so that relying on the superior training in concen-tration according to the Prajñaparamita, the Epitome, and the MagicalDisplay, they practice the view and meditation on the path in much thesame way as one brings up a small child—in stages—combining skillful meansand wisdom like a bird flying in the sky.

The way thishappens is that since all phenomena of the ground, path, and result—samsara and nirvana—arise as the play of one’s own unborn mind, they arefree from ontological extremes, from good and bad, like space. The mind isby nature unborn, its display is unobstructed, its essential characteristic isabsence of duality, and so on. In introducing this, the All-AccomplishingKingstates,Because all things are subsumed in the root, the mind,It is the root that has to be taught.Son, there are twelve points.The unborn ultimate nature of your own mind is not concealedanywhere and yetnobody can see it as a concrete object withcharacteristics.Though it hasnever stopped being yourssince the very beginning,hitherto you havenot recognized it as your nature.Since nothing exists as such inherently, when things are examinednothing is seen. However, when unexamined, they seem to exist: thus allthe phenomena of samsara and nirvana appear in every possible way,unobstructedly.Though in fact there is nothing, deluded appearances appear in all theirZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 356"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"variety, but since they do not intrinsically exist in any way, there is nothingreal.Though you have wandered for kalpas in existence,you have never lostor been parted from the buddha nature, sugatagarbha.Though the ultimate nature appears ina variety of ways as samsaraand nirvana, there has neverbeen any change in what it is.Without having as much asa part of the minutest atom of solidexistence, it pervades everything like space.Within emptiness, which is like space,the various phenomena that arisethrough the interdependent process of cause and effectappearunobstructedly.The mind is like an unbroken horse: if you are tense and agitated, youcannot control it; if you relax, you can control it. Therefore, when it is notheld or tied, it stays wherever it is.By uniting sustained calm and profound insight, one travels through thespace of the absolute natureunsupported, like a soaring garuda.From the absolute nature that is not anything, anything can arise, soeverything possible is accomplished without effort.Without the mind having color, shape,form, or characteristics,whichever way one views it and meditates on it, in that wayit appears.To sum up, this is an introduction to the nature of the mind. As it isunborn, there is no real basis to it. As its display is unobstructed, it arises invarious ways. As it is ultimately free of duality, there is nothing to cling to astrue. When the conceptual mind is liberated in its essence, nothing evermoves from the dharmata.✦✦42 ✦✦Twelve kinds of confidence confirming the view.From having seen the ultimate truth in its full nakedness, the mind is freeof doubt.Son, there are twelve kinds of confidence:The confidence that just asthe whole of existence is created anddestroyed in space, everything in samsara and nirvanais one and the samein thatnessand therefore has no intrinsic nature.The confidence that since the root of all thingsis subsumed in themind, Buddhahood is not to be soughtelsewhere.a necklace of jewels /357Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 357"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The confidence that since the mind by naturehas no birth and nocessation, it is uncompounded.The confidence that since everything that appears is delusory, in truthenemies and friends do not exist inherently as different entities.The confidence that since all actionsbased on delusionare suffering—that is, they are the cause of suffering—in truth, in terms of the ultimatenature, there is nothing to be done.The confidence that since the unborn absolute spaceis the nature of allphenomena, the natureis nondual.The confidence that there is no traveling the path, for realizing theunborn nature of your mindis Buddhahood.The confidence that the mind cannot be troubled by attachment andaversion, for everything that appears is untrue like a magical illusion.The confidence that although mind and appearances are many, theyhave one taste, and that therefore the thoughts related to the five poisonssuch asattachment and aversion are intrinsicallyunborn.The confidence that objects such as friends and enemies that arouseafflictive emotions, apart from simply being labels assigned by the ordinarymind, do not have any essential existence of their own;

Similarly,everything a realized beingdoes, since it ispermeated with the realization of theunborn nature, is bliss,for he doesnot have ordinary attachment and aversion.Take the example of a smile and a scowl: two expressions but no morethan oneface. Similarly,everything that appears, everything that exists—all the manifestation of samsara or nirvana—does so within the unbornabsolute nature.Take the example of a blind person: it makes no difference whetherone smiles at him or not. Similarly, since everything that arisesunobstructedly from the unborn absolute space is inseparable from it andhas the same taste, in the absolute nature there is nothing to be adoptedor rejected.Take the example of the trunk of a plantain tree: it has no core.Similarly, phenomenal existence has no essence, for when examined usingsuch logical arguments as “Neither one nor many,” there is nothing to befound.✦✦53 ✦✦When the four ontological extremes dissolve by themselves, it is shown thatphenomena are the mind’s projections and do not have to be abandoned.Son, there are four dissolutions of extremes.As regards all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana,in the absolutetruth they are unborn, so they are beyond the extreme of existence.In relative truth, the appearance aspect that is the interdependent364/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 364"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"gathering of causes and conditions,they are unceasing, so they are beyondthe extreme of nonexistence.Ultimately, the two truths, or appearance and emptiness, do not exist asdistinct phenomena: there is no basis for such distinctions, they areinseparable—in other words, they are not two, so they are beyond theextreme of both existence and nonexistence.Intellectually apprehended, “neither” arises as “both,” so phenomenaare beyond the extreme of neither existence nor nonexistence.Regarding this there are four faults that occur if one asserts that the twotruths are one and the same:(1) it would follow that ordinary beings who see compoundedphenomena could see the absolute truth;(2) it would follow that the absolute truth could be an objective conditionfor afflictive emotions arising;(3) it would follow that there was no distinction between relative andabsolute; and(4) it would follow that the absolute truth would not depend on listeningto the teachings and reflecting on them.And there are four faults that occur if one asserts that they are different,for it would then follow that:(1) the mind that had realized the absolute could not dispel the beliefthat relative phenomena truly exist;(2) absolute truth would not be the ultimate nature of relativephenomena;(3) the absence of intrinsic existence in relative phenomena would not bethe absolute truth; and(4) sublime beings would see them separately and would be bound andliberated at one and the same time.In our tradition there are none of these faults because we make no assertionsat all about the two truths being either single or different. We establish twotruths in relation to the conditions, deluded or nondeluded, of a single mind:in the deluded state the absolute truth does not appear to the relative, deludedmind, while in the nondeluded state the delusory relative does not appear tothe mind that has realized the absolute truth.

this is the all-penetrating primal wisdom.By dwelling naturally without seeking anything—which is themeditation of the all-penetrating wisdom—one remains in the statewithout conceptual constructs.Not adulterating or fabricating—which is the spontaneous action—is the great impartiality.a necklace of jewels /371Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 371"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The result of actualizing the absolute nature is that, as the ultimatenature of the mind arises spontaneously, primal wisdom unfolds in theexpanse.✦✦65 ✦✦Six ways in which the indivisible absolute nature arises.Son, there are six ways in which the nondual absolute nature arises.Sincethe nature of mind, which is spontaneously arisen primal wisdom,arises in the state free of contrivance from the very beginning, it is fresh.Since everything is complete within the mind, it is spontaneous.Since there is no blocking or encouraging, it is great primal wisdom.Since there is no dualisticdivision into samsara and nirvana, good andbad,it is the nondual vajra.Since mind is Buddha from the very beginning without depending oncauses and conditions, it is the self-born vajra.Since it is not caught by enemies or by good or bad circumstances, it isthe great evenness.✦✦66 ✦✦Four ways in which indivisible absolute nature arises.Son, there are four ways of arising without duality.With the mind’s concepts of past, present, and future severed, and themind left in the natural flow, it is clear and uncontrived, the naturalradiance devoid of thoughts, like an immaculate crystal.Without any concepts whatsoever, it is the mirror of awareness, like anuntarnished mirror.It is the realization of the radiant primal wisdom,self-cognizingawareness, likea wishing-gem that naturally produces everything onecould desire.In the spontaneously arisen primal wisdom, there is no “other-elimination,” soeverything arising by itself, it is the unpremeditatedwisdom.372/zurchungpa’s testamentZurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 372"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"✦✦ 67✦✦Some instructions on the indivisible absolute nature.Son, there are four instructions.The absolute nature has no bias, soin completely pervading all tendirections it is the great pervasion.Since it is without an outer gate and inner sanctum—or periphery andcenter—it is the bodhichitta free of partiality.As anything arises from that bodhichitta, it is the greatunpredictability.Since it is neither lit nor dimmed by circumstances, the absolute natureis the perfectlypure enlightened state.✦✦68 ✦✦An instruction on seeing the unborn absolute nature by means of eightkinds of natural dissolution.Son, there are eight kinds of natural dissolution.When one knows that the objects that appear have no true existence,one’s belief in true existence naturally dissolves: the moment one rests withthe mind undeluded in the direct perception of the absolute nature,everything that arises as the object of the six consciousnesses is ascertainedas being appearance and emptiness inseparable, like a magical illusion or a dream. Thus,Forms seen by the eye—whether beautiful or ugly—dissolve as they areseen. How does this happen?They dissolve in the sphere of the unborn,which is the intrinsic nature of both object and consciousness.In the same way,sounds heard by the ear—pleasant, unpleasant, and soforth—fade away as they are heard; they fade away in the expanse of theunborn.Odors smelled by the nose—fragrant, foul, and so on—dissolve as they are smelt; they fade away in the sphere of the unborn.Tastes savored by the tongue—sweet, sour, and so on—dissolve as they are tasted; they fade away in the expanse of the unborn.Sensations felt by the body—smooth, rough, and so on—dissolve as they are felt; they fade away in the expanse of the unborn.a necklace of jewels /373Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 373"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Perceptions too—the seventeen kinds of perceptions and others—dissolve by themselves; they fade away in the sphere of the unborn,appearance and emptiness inseparable.Words uttered—whether of the Dharma or not—dissolve bythemselves; they dissolve in the expanse of the unborn, sound andemptiness inseparable.Thoughts too—whether virtuous or not—are free in themselves; they dissolve into the sphere of the unborn, naturally pure awareness.✦✦69 ✦✦Seeing how having the four stainless things prevents one going astray.Son, there are four things that are stainless.To recognize the unborn absolute naturein everything that appears,the whole of phenomenal existence,illustrated by the eight similes ofillusion, is the stainless wisdom of the view.Taking the unborn natureas the path at all timesis the stainless pathof meditation.When one settles in the natural flow, in the unborn nature, an incapacity to express this nature is the stainless experience.Not to stray from the unborn nature into ordinary thoughtsrelated to past, present, and futureis the stainless result.✦✦70 ✦✦Showing that the practitioner’s insight will not find anything else other thanthe unborn nature.Son, there are five things you will not find.When one investigates using the “neither one nor many” reasoning,thereis no finding an object outside: things are like the bits of hair that appearto someone with an ophthalmic condition.Since there is neither a seeker nor anything to be sought,there is nofinding a mind inside.

Whatever appearsas an object outsideis an appearance of something that does not exist. So even if you look forit, you will never find it in the past, present, or future: there is nothing to be found.Awareness, your own mind inside, is awareness and emptinessinseparable, so you will not find it: there is nothing to be found.The body composed of the six elements has no essence, so you will notfind it: there is nothing to be found.Deluded beingsalso are, in truth,unborn, so you will not find them:there is nothing to be found.As forthe undeluded Buddha state, it is your own mind, so you willnot find it anywhere else: there is nothing to be found.✦✦72 ✦✦A detailed explanation of how the absolute nature arises nondually.Son, there are five things to take as the path, leaving the mind withoutcontrivance in its own state.There is nothing whatsoever to focus on regarding the absolute nature, sodo not conceive of its being anything.Do not indulge in any object outside—forms, sounds, and suchlike.Mind is the Buddha, right now, sodo not entertain any hopewhatsoever— such as a desire to obtain the qualities of the path and the result.Nothing that you perceive, suffering or bliss, afflictive emotions or primala necklace of jewels /375Zurchungpa_Interior_Final2 7/9/09 12:47 PM Page 375"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"wisdom, is extraneous to your own mind, sodo not regard anything as adefect.Give up thinking about past, present, and future, mulling over one’smemories, and so on:“force”—meaning leave—the mind into its naturalstate.✦✦73 ✦✦An instruction on how the way-it-is endowed with triple emptiness arises byitself.Son, emptiness is threefold, the fundamental nature of all phenomena,for which from the very beginning there is no birth, no cessation, and nodwelling.Being intrinsically unborn from the beginning,phenomena outside arenot born: they are empty.Mind being without foundation or root,the mind inside is empty: it isnot born.The aggregates “in between” are empty: they do not dwell.

He then proceeded to join the Council and to recitethe sutras in their entirety to the assembly.37 Mipham Jamyang Namgyal Gyatso (1846-1912) recognized Dilgo Khyentse Rin-poche as an incarnation and bestowed on him the empowerment of Mañjushri.38 Yamantaka is the wrathful form of Mañjushri.39 It should be remembered that when Khyentse Rinpoche gave this teaching he wasaddressing an audience of retreatants on whom he had just bestowed a numberof empowerments.40 Tib. yin pa, lit. “it is . . .”41 Alternative translation: “rely on the teacher as your wisdom eye for a long time,without separating from him.”42 Tib. rgya gad zer, scolding in the sense of telling you that practicing the Dharmais a waste of time and that you should be doing something more worthwhile.43 Implicit in the Tibetan here is the notion of offeringto superior beings above andgivingto lesser beings below.

Certain Vajrayana samayas can only be kept by practitioners who haveattained full realization.48 I.e., the five poisons as they are experienced by ordinary beings as opposed to theway in which they are experienced by Vajrayana practitioners who, rather than giv-ing up the five poisons, experience them as the five wisdoms.49 Tib. kun gzhi, Skt. alaya.50 Tib. zung ’jug rdo rje’i sku, the union of the dharmakaya and rupakaya.51 According to the Khenpo Ngawang Pelzang in his Guide to The Words of My Per-fect Teacher, carefulness (Tib. bag yod pa) is to exercise the utmost prudence indoing what is right and avoiding what is wrong.52 Tib. dgos med nga, lit. “five things one does not need,” in contrast to the five thingsin Chapter Nine that one does need, dgos yod lnga.53 “Fine words” here means saying things like, “Everything is empty, everything isawareness,” without having true realization.

The ten maxims in this chapter all use the same vocabulary in the Tibetanbut have necessitated slight variations in their translation.72 For a disciple who has true realization of the view, failure to make an outwardshow of devotion will have no adverse effects.73 For example, by buying animals that are due to be slaughtered or buying a fisher-man’s catch and returning the fish to the water.74 This statement can be understood in two ways.

When we say that forms “are liberated,” it is not theforms themselves that are freed, as it were, from a state of imprisonment, butrather the mind’s attachment and conceptual activity with regard to forms andother phenomena. For the meditator there are no concepts of subject, object, oraction, and so when something is seen, any concept of that thing naturally dis-solves as it is seen, like ripples dissolving back into the water. The meditator seesforms, but any concept of them dissolves with the sight of them. The same appliesto the way the meditator experiences all other sensory events, including thoughts.“Freedom” thus encompasses and transcends everything: the meditator, the phe-nomena he perceives, and the very perception of them.155 See above page 233.156 The same Tibetan word, snang, is used here for perception and appearance.157 The Tibetan word for samsara is ’khor ba, meaning to turn, circle, go round andround.158 The Tibetan word mthuusually denotes power, including magical power and theability to exorcise. As Shechen Gyaltsap notes, in this context (perhaps as dialect,or in an anachronistic usage) it means “leave.”159 Tib. ’d u b y e d, also called “volition.”160 This is the fourth “tie to be severed,” the “severing” in this case appearing inShechen Gyaltsap’s note, which employs the Tibetan verb bchad(meaning “tocut”) in three forms: phug bcad, to make a decision or become convinced; thetshom bcad, to clear one’s doubts; and sgro ’dogs bcad, to destroy misconceptions.These three are respectively qualified as outer, inner, and ultimate (don), mirror-ing the first three ties to be severed above.161 The commentary here applies to both place and seat. The seat should be suffi-ciently comfortable to enable one to stay in meditation for as long as possible.162 Tib. ’khrul ’khor, pronounced “trulkor.”163 I.e., the universe and the beings in it.164 Tib. sbyor ba drug. The Tibetan word sbyor ba(pronounced “jorwa”) has a num-ber of different meanings. In this case it means preparation (the preparation forthe “main practice” in the chapter that follows), but the well-known jorwa drukofthe Kalachakra tradition refers to six kinds of yoga.165Chakras(Skt.).166 In the practice of the channels and energies (rtsa lung), one usually visualizes one-self as the deity, that is to say, as appearance and emptiness inseparable. Neverthe-less, although one’s body is empty, for the purposes of the practice it is stillvisualized with a shape, and is therefore delimited from the empty space outsidethe body. This limit (the “skin” of the deity’s body) is referred to as the outer fenceof voidness (phyi’i stong ra).167 Lit. “protectors of the white side,” i.e., Dharma protectors.168 Zurchungpa was one of the four disciples of Lharje Zurpoche known as the foursummits.
