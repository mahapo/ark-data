As Manlal hill noted, the carlie$[ theories of inference probably arose out of a co~rn with the codificuion of philosophical debate. but prop-edy spcalcing. what is mant by inferencc here is not a Mryllogism M or some other argument. Ramer, an infettllCC produces or constirutes a knowlcd~­even! that IcnQWl iu object by mcanl of Icnowledge about another object that is invariably related to that object. A node aample is the inferential cognition that knows fire is present in a particular locus by I1lC2ru of pcr-ccptual knowledge of smoke in mat same Iocw. Inference dearly involves some steps. for in providing knowled~ of one thing by means of knowing something innriably related to it, the aa ofinferellCC requires a sequential structure, which ¥oIC will disaw below. Nc.omdcss. the central concern for these thinkers is nOl the fonna.lUm of lhat struct\\lrc: itself; instead, they ate most conamcd with the way in which that suucture supplies the n«csmy conditions for an inference.

The notion of a sliding scale of philosophical views is found in numer-ow 50Urccs before DharmaJdrti'. time. and it was particularly imporwu to Mahayana thinkers. Early Mwyinists such as Nigirjuna dearly wished to idcmify tbenudves as Buddhists, but they also sought to introduce new views or descriptions of realiry that they considered to be more accurate than those promulgated previously. The problem is that. if a Mahayinist supplants earlier views with allegcdly more accurate ones, other Buddhists might argue that the Mwyinist is effectively ~jecting the Buddhist tra-dition as a whole. The solution to this problem is to accept earlier views pro-visionally: although they may be inaccur:lte in some regards. these views or descriptions help beings to free themsdves from lheir confusion. That is. if deeply confused beings were presemed with only the most accurale descriptions of reality, mey would reject them OUt of hand. since: those descriptions are 50 countcnntuitive as to seem prepo,nerous [0 most ordi-nary persons.

To address this issue, WC' should recall that a singl~ style of analysis or reasoning is meant 10 carry 01 all the way up the scale of analysis. If ruch is the casc we should ask why we would ever StOP at a panicular level. Th.u is, if an int~lIigent ~n applies me analysis properly, should that person not simply continue the analysis to i15 final condwlon in Dharmaki\"ni's Epistemic ldealism~ It is true that one mwt shift &om one paradigmatic object of negation to the nat-fin, wholes. then repealable or o tendcd entities, then extra-menu! objects.

The mere nc:cd to chan~ the foci of our critique docs nO( seem to give u.s such a pawc that we mwt develop an entire ontology, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy ofbnguage at a particular level, bUI Dharmakirti assumes a panoply of such theories at each level; and he especially works through such theories at the levd of External Realism. Clearly, then, the f.&a that me analysis pawc:s al each level is not just a matter of f.&ciliatinl the switch of focus from one object of analysis 10 the other.

Dharmakini himsdf. however, specifically denies that universals art permanent, lina neither the unreal nor the abstr.act (i.e .• the distributed) can bear qualitic:s.-Let us now ~iterate the main points of Dhumakini's philosophical method and its impact on our study. First, in wing a sliding sca.le o f analy-sis, Dharmakini aims to move his readers up that scale, and we shall assume that even though the demands of systematicity might I'«luire the aploration of some issues, Dharmaidni', neglect of those issues is based on their irrelevance to th..is soteriological project. Ar the same time, Dhar-makini does argue at le ngth from the standpoint of EIlernai Realism , even though that sWidpoint is one that he will ultimuely reject. His pres-entation of E.s:remal Ralism is systanatie 10 the alent dial it comes to a final position that is the transition point to Epistemic Idealism. T o sustain that degree of systematicity within Exttrnal Ralism. Dharmwrri makes no o ntological commir.me.nt [0 commonsense objects or ~en [0 spatially ottnded co lors and such. In other words. positions that hold such things to be ultimately real particulars do 1Iot coum as External Realism, and Dharmalcirci never argues from such a st2ndpoim. To the atent they are discussed, they are represented mmly to be refuted by another oplana-tion that dispenses with any notion of atemion.

In the most rypical form of a conceprual illusion. me image in perception arisa in such a way that an unschooled person is confused by the similariry bctwcrn the per-ceived ob}«t and some olher object. He thus ·superimposes· (I<Imi-4 nth) some aspca of the similar object onto the perceived object. Hence. when a penon unfamiliar with mirages sees a mirage. the similarity between the mirage and water confuses the perceiver, and he superimposes the fact of being \"wan!r~ onto the mirage. lbc resulting judgmcnl. \"this is water,\" is a case of ronccprual iUusion. For our purposes. Ihe key issue bere is that the nonconceprual content (i.e., the imagt') of that perception is not itself Rawed. II is the fX:Icci\\'tt's inability to correctly interprtt the image. and noc the irmge itself, that is cawing the enor.

In other words, it is po$\" sible to distinguish a mirage and wata mcrdy by sight.

In brief, thr problrm is that thr objrcu of prrcrption srrm to exhibit at least some spatial extension. but mrrrologically rrductivr rn,-soning suggesu that only infinitesimal partides, which lack spacial exten-sio n, can be truly real.

Nevenheless, he chooses 10 avoid the alternative interpretation.

If an othcr-cxclwion is an aistcnt thing, and if the object of the word \"cow\" is an other-exdwion, then in order to avoid the absurdity of claiming mat the object of the 'N'Ord \"cow\" is a non-cow, Digniga mwt admit that the other-exclwion is a real thing innantiated in all cows.

Talk about extended entities such as Wllter.jugs and the effectS of those: entities is simply a matter of convtnience wd conventionY In the COntext of the term WIIbhil,,;z. this point is crucial, for sVIlbhiiva as n:ature :and lVilhh4lN1:H prnpc:ny c m both be applied t:ither to sp,uially l'Xtendc:d enti-ties, which :are only convcnriOn2l1y real, or to noncJ.tended p2rticul2l'S, which art ultimatdy ml Thc potential confusion hefC is that. as YIC shall 5«, both.senses of Wtlbhiiv4 rest upon notions of causal funaKmaiity, which is restricted to particulars in Dh.trmaldrti's ontology. Hcncc, if one YlCfC not to k«p in mind that talk about the causal functionality of extended cnti-(iel u simply:l. nuna or cnnvt:nil'ncr, one might believe th2( Dh.trm:l.Kirti's use of ~hb.i1Nl .as propeny :l.nd IIIahh,;,,\" :u n:alllte in the contl'XI of atended entities would imply that such emitics themselves have cau.uJ functionality, and that Ihey are therefore particulars.

Previously we have mn that one o f the fundamental moti~ vations for the formulation of the apoi»theory is to account for the fact that we have ~djsuibudve cognitions\" (ItnJlJl!fliprllf]ily4): we an look at sevetal entities and n:cogniu: them all as - the same\" (rlr,,) in that they ilIt' all water-jugs. for example. For o ther South Asian philosophers. this type of cognition is easily accoUnted for by appealing to the presence of a single universal. -waler-jug-nm~ (tM.uUlNJ). instantiated in all of thost: e:ntities. Thus. one an cogniu them as the ~me and call them all ·water-jugs\" because o ne's various cognitions quite literally cont21in th e ~me objKt. namely. that universal. For Dharmwni, however, this option is not available. for it is a form of rt:a.Iism that he rej('Ct$. Instead, he must find some other aplanation for our cognitio n o f all thost: individuals as the same. DharmalOni does so by for~ mulating a - nondiffert.n«· (\"bbrJ.) that pertains to all the entities in ques-tion. Specifically, he claims that although all the individuals in question arc actually unique, they are all nondiffercnt in that they arc all different from thost: entities that do not have the potentials to produce the expected dfccts and that have thus not bttn produced by the apect~ auses.\" In the previous chapter. we have secn that. when Dharmakini d iscusses aclusions, he plac%S panicular emphasis upon the samenm o f the effect (and not the sameness of the auses) that is asscned of all the entities to which the same exclusion is to apply. We have also seen that this appeal to a sameness of dfcct can lead to a number of problems. the most obvious of which is an infinite regress. To resolve these problems, Dharmakini appeals to the notion of a · judgment of sameness-(rlulpratyaw\"uni4jli4ft4).

Perhaps it is for this reason that Dh:umwni docs not include I way to determine which ptl'Vllding property is rclCVl1nt to our tCSt, but in not doing so , the tCSt obviously rt:rnains incondwiyo:. Thus, it appors that Dhannakini has once again f.a.iled in the second pan of hiJ ask. That is, although his formulation of the identity relation that underlies the usc of IViIbh.iv4-cvidencc may provide a theoretical guanmC'C for the accuracy of such inferences, he has not provided us with a rt:liable procedure for determining when thlt relation is in placc. This failure is nOt, howcvc:r, panicularly damning. for it rc::so on an intracu.ble problem: namdy, the distinction between the a.scntial and the accidental. m One possible response to this probkm is to fall bade upon an appca1 to worldly convt:ntion (IIJIIvahtlra, IoItaprasUJdha, etc.) as the basis for the iden-tity rdation.

In the (;ase of empirical entities, one can always resort to other per-ceptions and inferences to confirm (or reject) the alleged knowledge gained from some supposed perception or inference. One can always resort to other perceptions and inferences because Prama.r:a Theorists clearly expect that any empirically knowable object should be amenable to many different acts of perception or inference: for them, it would be anomalous indeed to claim that, for example, an object is generally perceptible (d.rfya) and yet known through only one act of perception, or only in the perceptions of one per-son. But an appeal to scripture as an instrument of knowledge amounts to the claim that there is but one instrument of knowledge-the scripture in question-that will give one access to the transempirical entities in question. And since we can neither confirm nor deny the scripture's claims about the transempirical, our only way to contest those claims is to contest the relia-bility of the scripture. To return to our example, if we are joined by fifty other observers in the valley, and if I claim to see with my own eyes some house in the distance, each of those fifty persons can test my claim through an act of perception unique to each person. But if I claim to see the house only through our one set of special binoculars, my claim can be tested only by passing the binoculars around, which may not be much of a test at all. And of course, PramaIJ-a Theorists were not contending with just one scrip-ture-each tradition had its own scripture (or body of scriptures) that pre-sented its own version of the transempirical. Adding these competing scriptures to the mix is akin to finding other binoculars that we might use. In lieu of just one pair of binoculars, we would now have five or six, but each set of binoculars presents a different (or even incommensurate) picture of the scene on the mountaintop. Although our example may be crude, it has the advantage of presenting in rather stark terms the issues that Pramal).a Theorists face in sorting out the competing claims about the transempirical that they encounter in the various scriptures or scriptural traditions of South Asia. Since each tradi-tion's ultimate purposes focus on transempirical goals, the Prama.r:a The-orists in each tradition cannot simply ignore scriptural disparity because scripture alone gives ordinary persons access to the trans empirical. To ignore the competing claims of scripture would be to ignore one's highest purpose or goal. And since the scriptures provide the sole access to the transempirical, when thinkers from different traditions debate the transem-pirical, they cannot overtly begin with the assumption that any given scrip-"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 233 \"e is true. Otherwise, debate would be reduced to tautological assertion. 14 ce, although Pramal}a Theorists argue directly about the claims made ripture, they focus most of the debate about scripture on the question .\" strumentality: what is it that makes any scripture an instrument of \",ledge? And the style of argument employed across traditions tends to ssuch debates on one critical criterion of instrumentality: the origin of ipture. In brief, one aims to show that the content of one's scripture is ble because its source is flawless. examining this issue, Pramal}a Theorists prior to DharmakIrti employ general strategies that are well known in this style of discourse. First, may argue that a scripture is the \"speech of a credible person\" viida), and as such, its instrumentality is derived from the extraordi-qualities that make that person credible (apta), Second, one may argue a scripture is eternal and not of human origin (apauru!eya); its instru-tality is somehow innate to it. Of these two options, most Pramal}a rists, including Buddhists, follow the former option, and this in turn s two questions: is it possible for a person to be or become \"credible\"? second, can we determine that a specific person is indeed credible? makIrti's own answers to these questions are important because they his apparent attempt to ground instrumentality in a seemingly cir-appeal to the Buddha's credibility. academic study of Buddhist Pramal}a Theory, some scholars have that DharmakIrti's notion of instrumentality rests ultimately on of circularity.

How might these statements lead us to ECTE circularity? First, follow-ing Franco, we interpret the term pramatzabhuta (\"one who has hecome an instrument of knowledge\") as a synonym of apta (\"credible person\"). We would certainly be within our rights to make this interpretation; indeed, it is difficult to imagine why DharmakIrti's contemporaries would not them-selves immediately see his use of pramatzabhuta as a reference to credibil-ity.19 Thus, the argument by way of the four epithets becomes an argument about the qualities tha~ make the Buddha credible. And once we are in the context of credibility, we are de facto concerned with the instrumentality of the Buddha's teaching. What role does the teaching play here? The verse maintains that through the teaching (upadefatap), we establish that percep-tion and inference are instrumental. And what is the relevance of percep-tion and inference? The verse is not explicit in this point, but it is clear that, on DharmakIrti's view, an acceptable and convincing argument must employ instruments of knowledge as its warrants. Hence, presumably we accept the long argument concerning the four epithets because it proceeds through a rigorous application of perception and inference. In short, the statements that we have just cited seems to invoke an ECTE circle:20 Using perception and inference, the long preceding argument has demonstrated that the Buddha has four extraordinary quali-ties, and since he has those qualities, he is an instrument of knowledge-that is, he is credible (apta). Moreover, we praise him as an instrument of knowledge precisely so as to demon-19 Franco (1997:29) offers a convincing comparison on Dharmakirri's approach to pramiirtabhuta and Vatsyayana's discussion of iiptatva. Certainly, it seems that the charac-teristics evoked by the four subsidiary epithets resemble in significant ways the extraordinary qualities that, for Vatsyayana, constitute credibility. See also Silk (2002). 20 We should note here that the question of whether the Buddha is an instrument of know 1-edge literally or only metaphorically actually makes litde difference to the issue of circular-ity. I have earlier suggested (1999) that the literal interpretation of the epithet pramiirtabhuta is highly problematic, at least on the interpretation of the earliest commentators, and Krasser's work (2001) strongly supports this conclusion. Nevertheless, the key issue here is whether the term pramiiflabhuta should be taken as essentially synonymous with iipta.

Surprisingly, however, Dharmakirti does not argue for the instrumental_ ity of scriptural knowledge by arguing for the credibility of the Buddha' moreover, we can readily justifY the stronger claim that he explicitly rejec~ any appeal to credibility as an acceptable means of grounding the instru_ mentality of scripture. To demonstrate how this is the case, we need nOt present a detailed analysis ofDharmakirti's approach to scripture, since both Tillemans and Franco have already provided such studies.26 Instead, let us offer a brief summary and then cite his explicit rejection of credibility. In sum, Dharmakirti's discussion of scripture falls into eight significant parts:27 1. An initial reference to Dignilga'swords that emphasizes the context in which an appeal to scripture is permissible [Preamble to PV1.214]. One can only make such an appeal if (a) the issue at hand is wholly transempirical (atyantaparok!a) in that it cannot be adjudicated on the basis of empirical instruments of knowledge; and (b) it must be settled in order for one to advance in one's spiritual exercises. 2. The general characteristics that a scripture must have ifit is to be a can-didate for use in a scriptural inference [PV1.214 and PVSV ad cit.]. The scripture must address the concern mentioned in (I) above in an intelligible and practicable fashion. 3. The \"threefold analysis\" that a candidate scripture must pass if one is to use it as the basis for a scriptural inference [PV1.215 and PVSV ad cit.]. To be used for a scriptural inference, the passage must pass three tests: (a) it cannot be contradicted by empirical knowledge acquired through perception; (b) it cannot be contradicted by empirical knowledge acquired through inference; and (c) it must not contra-dict itself concerning transempirical matters. 4-A restatement of Dignilga's words [PV1.2I6 and PVSV ad cit.]. This almost literal restatement's rhetorical location suggests that 1-3 can be considered a complete account. 26 Tillemans (1993) and Franco (1997 and 1999). 27 See the translation in the appendix (J61ff). See also Tillemans (1999)."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 241 5. An alternative test that obliquely refers to the extraordinary qualities of the scripture's author (i.e., the Buddha) [PVI.2I7 and PVSV ad cit.]. This test either supplements or perhaps replaces (3) the threefold analysis. According to this test, one may employ a scriptural infer-ence with regard to transempirical matters because the \"important topics\" (pradhanartha) of the Buddha's teachings, i.e., the Nobles' Four Truths, can be confirmed on the basis of an ordinary person's empirical instruments of knowledge alone. Hence, since his teach-ings are known to be trustworthy in this regard, one trusts them with regard to other, empirically inaccessible matters. To trust the teachings in this manner, one must also maintain that the scrip-ture's author (namely, the Buddha) had knowledge of matters that are transempirical to us, and that he had no reason to deceive us. 6. A denial that scriptural inference is actually an inference [end of PVSV on PVI.2I7]. Dharmakirti says that it is \"not without problems,\" and his commentator Sakyabuddhi describes such an inference as \"not actually instrumental.\"28 7. An explicit rejection of the appeal to credibility [PVI.218-219 and PVSV ad cit.], which we will cite below. 8. And finally, a reaffirmation of the possibility of attaining the kind of qualities that, ifit were possible for others to know them, would make one credible [PVI.220-223 and PVSV ad cit.]. Here Dharmakirti cites many of the issues that he will take up in greater detail in the aforementioned discussion of the Buddha as \"one who has become an instrument of knowledge\" (prama~abhiita). _ A significant feature of this argument is the tension that it evinces ~~tween an appeal to one's own empirical knowledge as opposed to trust-i-ig in another's (i.e., the Buddha's) trans empirical knowledge. Dharmakirti ~~~gins in an empiricist vein by avoiding any reference to credibility (1-4), i~d the rhetorical structure of this portion of the argument suggests that we ,iiay consider it a complete account of scriptural inference, if we were so '}n other words, the Acarya [Dignagal did not say that knowledge from scripture is a type of instrumental inference by claiming that it is actually or truly (bhiivika) instru-~mental. Rather, it is instrumental with regard to the way in which a person should proceed."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"242 FOUNDATIONS OF DHARMAKIRTI'S PHILOSOPHY inclined. Perhaps, however, Dharmakirti recognizes that in the context of Dignaga's notion of scriptural inference, one cannot fail to speak of the Buddha as credible-i.e., a person with the extraordinary qualities required for direct epistemic access to the transempirical. Dharmakirti therefore sup-plements the initial account (1-4) by referring somewhat obliquely to the Buddha's extraordinary qualities and transempirical knowledge (5). Even here, however, he manages to cast the issue in an empiricist light: he affirms unequivocally that one can determine the \"important topics\" of the Bud-dha's teaching just on the basis of one's own, ordinary perceptions and inferences. Nevertheless, despite this claim's empiricist tones, Dharmakirti is apparently troubled by his own appeal to the Buddha's transempirical knowledge and concomitant extraordinary qualities. How else can we explain the fact that he immediately backpedals by denying that scriptural inference is really an inference at all (6)? Moreover, he then proceeds to reject explicitly any appeal to credibility (7). Nevertheless, he apparently has qualms about implying that, by rejecting credibility, he means to reject the notion that it is possible to obtain the kind of extraordinary qualities attrib-uted to the Buddha. He therefore reaffirms (8) that if one follows the Bud-dhist path to its completion, one can attain the kind of extraordinary qualities that would make one credible, even if ordinary persons cannot definitely know whether any specific person has done so. Overall, the argument thus exhibits an ambivalence that oscillates almost wildly between an appeal to the trans empirical knowledge of an extraordi-nary person (i.e., the Buddha) and a staunch affirmation that even as ordi-nary persons, we can confirm and know the important part of the Buddha's teaching just on the basis of our own empirical perceptions and inferences. I would argue that this ambivalence is certainly part of what contributes to the appearance of EeTE circularity in the PramiiIJ-asiddhi chapter. Below we will also see that this ambivalence is an important thematic issue that must inform our examination of the Buddhist approach to instrumentality. Let us first settle, however, the question of whether Dharmaldrti is indeed caught in EeTE circularity. We have noted that we seek a clearly articulated position in which Dharmakirti rejects the appeal to credibiliry that would be required for him to be committed to an EeTE position. We find a clearly articulated rejection at PVI.218-219, which on our account is the seventh section of the argument on scriptural inference. To be clear that Dharmakirti is indeed rejecting any appeal to credibility, it is worth cit-ing this passage in full:"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 243 Others [such as the NaiyayikasJ think that a statement dependent for its origin on a superior person is in accord with reality (yathartha). [PVI.2I8ab) According to others,29 a credible speaker (apta) is a person with good qualities such as experience of things as they truly are (yatharthadarfana); that person's teachings are trust-worthy. This point is admitted if one is able to know that that per-son has that superior quality. 3D [PVI.218ed] Every judicious person who wishes to act analyzes statements to determine what is and what is not scripture (agama); he does so as one who wishes to act [effectively], and not because of some pernicious habit. Learning what should be put into practice from the scripture, he thinks, \"Having acted accordingly, I might realize my goal.\" On the basis of the trustworthiness of that scripture with regard to things that can be experienced [through perception or empir-ical inference], that person acts with regard to other things [i.e., the supersensible objects described in that scripture] because such is the case for most practical action in the world. But if one is to act on the basis of examining the person, one would not act at all because one cannot know whether or not that person has those kind of extraordinary qualities. It is not the case that persons such as us would not act because of not accepting that there are some persons with those qualities, since that kind of person does indeed make true statements.31 In other words, ;~ainafJ, while Manorathanandin provides naiyiiyikiiilayafJ. 1:.:.· ..... · ........

For Dharmaklrti, one cannot use this procedure for the simple reason that one cannot reliably determine whether the person in question has the requisite qualities or not. On my view, the above passage constitutes the kind of clearly articu-lated rejection of an appeal to credibility that allows us to discount any apparent ECTE circularity in Dharmaklrti's thought. On this interpreta-tion, the seeming ECTE circularity of the statements' that end Dhar-maklrti's discussion of the Buddha's extraordinary qualities (i.e., the qualities that make him pramii1}abhiita) must reflect a calculated excess of apologetic rhetoric along the lines suggested by Franco. Whatever else Dharmaklrti may be up to, his affirmation of the metaphorical instrumen-tality of the Buddha as \"become an instrument of knowledge\" (pramii1}a-bhiita) is not meant to suggest that the Buddha's words are what literally prove the instrumentality of perception and inference. We might think that the passage cited above, which has also been dis-cussed most notably by Tillemans, would put an end to all talk of circu-larity, but it has not. Instead, it has prompted Steinkellner to reassess the issue of circularity in terms of a far subtler issue, namely, the relation between Dharmaklrti's conception of ultimate goal and the need to define the instrumentality of perception and inference in a manner that suits that ultimate goal. This subtler approach creates an important interpretive con-text for our study of instrumentality, and it especially helps to clarifY the curious ambivalence-the oscillation between the empirical and the transempirical-in Dharmaklrti's discussion of scripture. Axiological Concerns: Mutual Restraint of Path and Goal At the humble and amusing outset of his recent article, \"Once More on Cir-cles,\" Ernst Steinkellner remarks, \"At a certain stage of life one's research work seems to oscillate between three options: correcting old mistakes, repeating old mistakes, and making new mistakes.\"35 This self-effacing quip introduces Steinkellner's abandonment of the notion that Dharmakirti espouses a form of ECTE circularity, and Steinkellner emphasizes that change by citing and agreeing with the interpretations offered by Franco and 35 Steinkellner (200J:323)."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"46 FOUNDATIONS OF QHAI.MAKIRTI·S PHILOSOPHY TilklNlU.

At the same time, Dharmakirti clearly means ~'that except for their objects and results, there is nothing distinctive about the ~Qrdinary perceptions and empirical inferences that lead us, however incre-fihentally, toward nirvtirta. In other words, in their nature they are the same ,lis every other perception and empirical inference. Hence, when he presents ffhe instrumentality of ordinary perception and inference, his discuSsion must !~pply to all such cognitions, not just those that lead directly or indirectly to l:nirviirta. Dharmakirti thus has two concerns: that some instrumental cogni-~ons of ordinary persons be capable of knowing the truth of nirviirta, and ~at his account of instrumentality construes these cognitions to be the same in their basic nature as every other ordinary instrumental cognition. When these two concerns are combined, we arrive at a clear constraint ~!bh the way that Dharmakirti must approach instrumentality. That is, since isome ordinary instrumental cognitions move one toward nirviirta (by giv-liing one access to the important part of the Buddha's teaching), those cog-lhitions cannot be inimical or contradictory to the obtainment of nirvtirta; l!\"ltherwise, they would be moving one away from it, not toward it. At the ~~ame time, his general account of instrumentality must apply not only to ~fhose cognitions, but to all ordinary perceptions and inferences; otherwise, ll)rdinary instrumental cognitions could not do the work that he claims they t; ~$ll do. In other words, if the ordinary instrumental cognitions that lead us ~toward nirvtirta are not identical in nature to all other ordinary instrumen-t~al cognitions, then Dharmakirti would in effect be asserting that those ~erceptions and inferences are not ordinary. Hence, since the account of !tnstrumentality must apply to all ordinary cognitions, and since that gen-!eraI account must also apply to the specific cognitions that lead to nirvtirta, !l)harmakirti's general account of the instrumentality of perception and :tnference must avoid any features that would be inimical to the obtain-iment of nirvtirta.

On Devendrabuddhi's view, this initial statement must be supplemented with a remark that DharmakIrti makes near the end of this section on instru-mentality (i.e., at PV2.5c). This latter statement concerns the \"novelty\" of the cognition, and according to Devendrabuddhi, it must be added to Defl..l in order to form a complete definition of an instrument of know 1-edge that covers all possible cases. The statement reads: [Def1..2:] Moreover, an instrument of knowledge is that which illuminates an unknown object (artha) [PV2.5c).48 Thus, on Devendrabuddhi's view, the full definition of an instrument of knowledge is an awareness that is both trustworthy (Defl.l) and also \"novel\" (Defl.2) in that it \"illuminates\" or makes known an unknown object.49 If we combine our bipartite definition, we can restate the definition of an instrument of knowledge more concisely. In doing so, let us also take advantage of the fact that, for DharmakIrti, an instrument of knowledge is always a cognition (jfiiina). Hence, by way of a terminological shorthand, 47 PV2.Ia-bl: pramii1Jam avisa7]'lviidi jfiiinam. Note here that jfiiina has been translated as \"awareness.\" The general question of translating the term jfiiina is of greater importance than it might first appear. Potter has remarked on this issue in a somewhat different context. Questioning whether \"knowledge\" as \"justified true belief\" is applicable to Pramar,a Theory, Porter has noted: A jfiiina is ... an act of awareness. It does not name a disposition (say, to respond in a certain way when meeting a certain sort of thing). A jfiiina is ... an occurrent. If it involves belief, it does so only in the sense of a believing as a fleeting act of awareness. A jfiiina is not a belief in a dispositional sense .... Any act of awareness which has intentionality constitutes ajfiiina. (1984:309-310) This aspect of Potter's argument supports the point I am making here: namely, that a jfiiina need not involve the determinacy implicit in the term \"knowledge.\" This is especially the case if we understand the \"beliefs\" that constitute dispositions to be necessarily determi-nate, or even propositional, in nature. 48 PV 2.5c: ajfiiitiirthaprakiifo vii. 49 Both Dreyfus (1997:291) and Franco (1997:47) maintain that Devendrabuddhi under-stands these two statements to be taken separately, but Devendrabuddhi explicidy construes them together at the end of this discussion when he remarks: \"[A cognition] which by nature"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 255 our discussion will often translate prama1Ja as \"instrumental cognition.\" With this in mind, we can restate the definition as follows: Def1.I & 1.2: An instrumental cognition (prama1Ja) is a trust-worthy awareness that illuminates an unknown object. This way of defining an instrumental cognition dearly gains favor among Dharmakirti's commentators beginning with Devendrabuddhi. The exact place of novelty in this definition is a matter of some contention, but let us [eave that discussion for a later point. Instead, let us continue with these basic definitions by citing Dharmakirti's explanation of trustworthiness. On Devendrabuddhi's interpretation, the explanation reads: [Defl:] Trustworthiness is a cognition of telic function (artha-kriya) [PV2.Ib-c].50 leOn the most straightforward reading, Defl means that, if perception and [ir:nference are instrumental, then they must be cognitions of that which ~accomp1ishes the desired goal. Devendrabuddhi notes that as such, percep-i'tion and inference are trustworthy, for they are what \"cause one to obtain lI(prapaka) the desired object (artha). \"51 As we shall see, on Devendrabuddhi's tview, the obtainment of the desired object consists in the activation of a %ognition in which there appears the accomplishment (kriya) of one's aim 1~r tdos (artha). Within the context of this interpretation, Devendrabuddhi irefers to a statement from Prama1Javinifcaya, where Dharmakirti remarks: i~ntains the aforementioned two kinds of characteristics is an instrument of knowledge; the mlessed One is an instrument of knowledge like that [cognition].\" [PVP (6b4): ji skad du l~shad pa'i mtshan nyid rnam pa gnyis brten pa 'i ngo bo can gang yin pa de ni tshad rna yin no / te bzhin bcom /dan tshad ma nyid.

This overlap between \"aim\" and \"object\" appears to be based upon the degree to which causal efficiency is linked to purpose: considered just in terms of the causal efficiency of pro-ducing perceptions and (indirectly) inferences, an artha is an object. And considered primarily in terms of purpose, an artha is an aim.55 Although artha as \"aim\" and \"object\" may thus be distinguished, even 'when the term artha is best rendered as \"object\" it retains some connection to the notion of a purpose or goal. Such is the opinion of Devendrabuddhi, :is is apparent when he comments upon Dharmakirti's statement at the Outset ofPV3 that the illusory \"hairs\" or \"flies\" perceived by a person with ¢ataracts cannot be considered \"objects\" (arthas).56 As noted earlier,57 the trux of the problem here is that Dharmakirti might be obliged to posit not ~nly particulars and universals as objects of knowledge (jneya), but also a third type, namely, illusory objects. Commenting on this problem, Deven-dtabuddhi raises an objection and offers his reply: \"Well, in the awareness of a person with defective vision there are false appearances such as hairs, flies, two moons and so on. Those ;~~g., G:2.6: siimarthyiid arthagatau pratipattigauravaparihiiriirtha1J1 ... ); and object (e.g., ~~2..19-20: svabhiivapratibandhe hi saty artho 'rtham na vyabhicaratt). In the context oflan-g~age, the verb pra4 vrt regularly appears with artha (in locative), where the latter has the ~~nse of referent. For one of many examples without pra4 vrt, see PVSV adPVI.62 (G:34.1-2: 'lsmiin na sarvatra dharmadharmiviicinor fabdayor viicye 'rthe nifcayapratyayavi!ayatvena kaf-i{fjvife!ab) . ~;This way of understanding artha is closely related to Nagatomi's analysis of the com-~{9:ynd arthakriyii. See below (259). While unambiguous examples of artha as object or aim ~~Stlot difficult to find, some of the more interesting cases are those where artha is used as ~and object within the same statement. See, for example, PVI.93 (cited by Nagatomi ~;2~7-68:56): api pravarteta pumiin vijfiiiyiirthakriyiik!amiin I tatsiidhaniiyety arthe!u ;!?iftiyojyante 'bhidhiiyakiibll. More interesting yet again are the numerous cases where the between \"aim\" and \"object\" is not at all clear.

To demonstrate that both the telic meaning (i.e., \"purposeful action\") and the causal meaning (\" causal efficiency\") can apply to the term arthakriya, Nagatomi cites various passages that illustrate each meaning. Although some of the passages chosen by Nagatomi may not fully suppOrt his readings, there seems little doubt that the term arthakriya does range over a scale of meanings bracketed by these two extremes (i.e., the telic and the causal). 62 It is important to note, however, that Dharmakirti's philosophy proba-bly would not support an interpretation of arthakriya solely in terms of either extreme. This is certainly the case with the interpretation of arthakriya in terms of purpose or aim, for to fulfill an aim, an object must be causally efficient. & for the interpretation in terms of causal efficiency, we have seen that for Devendrabuddhi and most subsequent Buddhist com-mentators, the content of awareness is an \"object\" (artha) only if it is inter-preted within the context of persons engaged in practical action (vyavahara). However, as a speculative interpretation, we should note that in at least one context-that of reflexive awareness {svasarrzvedana}-the notion of arthakriya may be applicable only in terms of sheer causal effi-ciency, since it is difficult to see how practical action (vyavahara) makes sense within this context. Whether this latter interpretation be plausible (or implausible), it is nevertheless the case that all passages where a telic meaning is stressed still contain some appeal to causality, and the vast majority (if not all) passages that stress the notion of causal efficiency still rest on some notion of a telos within the context of practical action (vyavahara). 63 Instrumentality (pramat}.ya) in Terms of Two Effects Nagatomi's identification of the two different emphases-i.e., the telic and the causal-that may be applied to the term arthakriya is highly signifi-62 See Nagatomi (1967-68:55-57). Among the passages cited by Nagatomi, it is not at all clear that in PVp-3 arthakriyii is used primatily in the sense of causal efficiency. 63 Among the passages cited by Nagatomi (1967-68:56), one is PVI.98-99ab {}fiiiniidyartha-kriyii1[l tii1[l tii1[l dntvii bhede 'pi kurvatap / arthii1[ls tadanyavifle!avi!ayair dhvanibhip saha II"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 161 ant, ror rhcsc two differmt emphases mrrcspond to two different ways of undc:rsWlding Dhannwn:i', norio n ofinmumentaliry, csp:cially as int~r· pm~ by lkvendrabuddhi.

Likewise, know-ing that some thing is to be avoided, a person does not imple-ment its means and thereby obtains the activity of not directly apprehending it.

That is, it is the primary fac-tor-awareness is the primary factor-in the activity whose object is a real thing which one should obtain or avoid and which is thus called a \"human aim.\" Therefore, since awareness is the pri-mary factor, awareness is instrumentaL71 Devendrabuddhi's interpretation suggests three phases in the process of employing an instrumental cognition to obtain a human aim. First, one has a cognition that apprehends some entity as what one needs to obtain or avoid, i.e., as that which fulfills one's aim. Second, one implements the means for obtaining or avoiding that entity. And third, one obtains the \"activity\" or \"activation\" (pravrtti) of another cognition, namely a percep-tion in which that entity is experienced as fulfilling one's goal. Thus, on Devendrabuddhi's view, at PV2.3b-d, Dharmaklrti uses the term \"activity\" to refer to the activation of a perception of that entity. To be specific, it is a perception that Devendrabuddhi elsewhere describes as one \"in which the accomplishing of one's goal appears\" (arthakriyanirbhasa)'72 From a lexical standpoint, the interpretation of \"activity\" (prav.rtti) in this fashion is certainly legitimate, since Dharmaklrti often uses this term to speak of the \"activation\" or occurrence of an instrumental cognition,l3 71 PVP (3b5ft): shes pa blang bar bya [bal 'i don shes nas de sgrub par byed pa nan tan du byed pas mngon sum du byed pa 'i mtshan nyid can gyi Jug pa skyes bus thob par gyur ro / de bzhin du dor bar bya ba shes nas de sgrub par byed pa nan tan du mi byed pas / de mngon sum du mi byed pa 'i mtshan nyid can gyi Jug pa thob par gyur te / blo ni tshad ma nyid / bfang dang dor bya'i dngos po yi / Jug fa de gtso nyid phyir dang / bfang bar bya ba dang dor bar bya ba'i dngos po 'i yul can dang / skyes bu'i don zhes bya ba can gyi Jug pa de fa / de gtso bo nyid kyi phyir te shes pa gtso bo nyid yin pa 'i rgyu 'i phyir / blo ni tshad ma nyid yin no. n Devendrabuddhi first uses the term arthakriyiinirbhiisa explicitly at PVP:2b7 (ji ltar 'dod pa'i don byed par snang ba can = yathiibhimatiirthakriyiinirbhiisa), but this notion is dearly what he has in mind when he refers repeatedly (starting at 2a3) to cognitions such as \"a per-ception whose object is the sensation of warmth of a fire\" (de'i dro ba'i regpa fa sogs pa'i yul can gyi mngon sum), \"a subsequent cognition whose object is burning, cooking, etc.\" (4<13: sreg pa dang 'tshed pa fa sogs pa'i yul can gyi phyis kyi shes pal, and so on. 73 Perhaps the best known example is the negative statement in the context of nonpercep-tion (PVI.3a apravrttib pramiiIJiiniim apravrttiphaliisatz)."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY, JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 16S And from a commonKnsc sandpoint, Dcvendnbuddhi's description makes good ~nsc.

More specifically, it ~eems likely that something akin to Nagatomi's two senses of arthakriyiiare ~resupposed by Devendrabuddhi in the formulation of his theory: the lhotion of a mediated instrumental effect presupposes the sense of arthakriyii ~\"telic function\" (Nagatomi's \"purposive action\"), while the notion of an ~l1mediated instrumental effect presupposes the sense of arthakriyii as liriausal efficiency.\" In this section we will explore how this might be the ~e, with the important proviso that, since Nagatomi's categories are not ?ecognized per se by Dharmaki:rti and Devendrabuddhi, we are necessarily ~p'gaged in a somewhat speculative enterprise. ;t;To understand the relevance ofNagatomi's two senses of arthakriyii, we Aeed first to recall that when a cognition's instrumentality is defined in ~~rms of a mediated effect, it is an instrument (kararza) because it is the ~ost important factor in the production of a subsequent effect, namely, the \\l:ftainment of a human aim (puruJiirtha). As we have noted, the instru-~ent's effect is \"mediated\" (vyavahita) because even though the cognition ~sjnstrumental, its function must be supplemented by later conditions and aevelopments, if the desired effect is to be obtained. :~ The fact of being mediated indicates that this way of defining instru-bentality emphasizes the first of Nagatomi's interpretations of the com-lound arthakriyii, i.e., arthakriyii as \"telic function\" or, to use Nagatomi's ~term, \"purposive action.\" As noted above, arthakriyiiis relevant to an instru-~ental cognition's trustworthiness. Specifically, an instrumental cognition t(pramiirza) is always trustworthy, and that trustworthiness is described as ),rthakriyiisthiti, which Devendrabuddhi interprets as a cognition of artha-o/etiyii. Now, if arthakriyii is understood as telic function, this means that an ;:i~strumental cognition is trustworthy in that it results in a cognition of ~dic function. Or, to put it another way, the instrumental cognition is ~rustworthy because it results in the activation of a cognition in which the ~ccomplishment of one's goal appears. This is, as we have seen, Deven-~rabuddhi's way of construing an instrument of knowledge in terms of a ;mediated instrumental effect. Thus, by interpreting arthakriyii as \"telic function,\" we arrive at Devendrabuddhi's notion of an instrumental cog-~ition in terms of a mediated instrumental effect: the cognition is instru-:!pental in that it is a cause for the resulting \"activity\" that is a cognition of !the accomplishment of one's aim. •. In contrast, when understood in terms of an unmediated instrumental ~ffect (avyavahitapramiirzaphala), the instrumentality of a cognition involves"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"274 FOUNDATIONS OF DHARMAKIRTI'S PHILOSOPHY no appeal to a causal relation between instrument and effect. On this approach, a cognition is instrumental not because it is the most important factor in the production of some goal, but rather because it is that which is the primary factor in establishing that an \"effect\"-i.e., the pramiti itself_ is already in place. Since the instrumental cognition is thus occurring at the same time as the instrumental effect (pramartaphala), there can be no question of mediation, whether causal or otherwise. But although neither Dharmakirti nor Devendrabuddhi is specific on this point, it appears that when an instrumental cognition is defined in this fashion, one likewise can-not construe its trustworthiness in terms of a cognition of arthakriya as \"accomplishment of a goal\" (i.e., \"telic function\"). The reason for aban-doning this model of trustworthiness is that it would lead to an infinite regress. That is, consider the trustworthiness of an instrumental cognition that \"results\" in an unmediated effect-i.e., that cognition itself is the man-ifestation of the desired effect that is one's goal. If the trustworthiness of such a cognition were to consist of it leading to some subsequent cognition in which appears the accomplishment of one's goal, then no such cognition would ever be trustworthy, for no cognition would be trustworthy in and of itself without appealing to a later result.90 It can be argued, however, that the trustworthiness of at least one type of awareness whose effect is unmediated can (or perhaps must) be interpreted in this fashion, i.e., in such a way that its trustworthiness consists of its resulting in a cognition in which appears the accomplishment of one's aim (arthakriyanirbhiisa). To be specific, such a cognition would be one that is the latter cognition itself, i.e., one in which the accomplishment of one's aim already appears. An example would be the sensation of heat when, after see-ing. a fire from a distance, one finally reaches it and feels its warmth. Here the perception-the sensation of warmth-is itself the fulfillment of one's aim; hence, no further mediation is required in order for one's aim to be accom-plished. The instrumental cognition, in short, would be its own effect, which is exactly what is meant by an unmediated instrumental effect. If this inter-pretation is correct, such an instrumental cognition may be counted as hav-ing an unmediated instrumental effect at the same time as involving the notion of resulting in the accomplishment (kriya) of one's aim or telos (artha}.91 90 Although Devendrabuddhi does not discuss it specifically, Sakyabuddhi notices that the problem of infinite regress must be addressed (PVT, nye74a5-6 and 74bz). 91 This certainly becomes the opinion oflate commentators. See, for example, Dharmottara's comments to that effect (Steinkellner and Krasser 1989:13.3ff)."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY, JUSTifYING TI-I£ SOURCES Of KNOWLEDGE 17S h would thU1 appear that 50me notion of aim or td05 is applicable to the interprcutio n of IInhttlrriyJ as the crilerion for trwtworthincu even in this particular type of cognition with unmcd.iated effect, namely, a cognition in which the accomplishment of o ne's aim already appcan.

Following Nagaromi, the a1ternalivc interprcation suggcsted-bUt nCVff ckarly statcd-by Dharmooni or dlC: earliest commentators is that of IInhUriy4 as mere causal functionalicy: an emiry has IIrthttlrriy4 in the simple sefUC that il has effect!.

But that cognition is instrumental in terms of an unmediated effect (i.e., the mere fact of having an awareness) because that moment of consciousness is real, i.e., it is causally efficient (arthakriya) in that it is a mental product and will itself lead to other mental effects. This way of defining the unmediated instrumental effect in terms of causal efficiency helps to explain a second, related notion: namely, reflex-ive awareness {svasa'flZvedana}, the \"self-cognizing\" or \"self-presencing\" of every cognition. Reflexive awareness itself is an exception to the rule that the object of a perception (pratyakfa) is the cause of the image in the per-ceptual cognition.93 Hence, if it is to be considered instrumental, it clearly cannot be considered in terms of a mediated instrumental effect, since this would require an appeal to causality that is not possible in the case of reflex-ive awareness. And it likewise difficult to imagine how reflexive awareness can fit into a scheme of human goals; hence, unlike a cognition in which appears the accomplishment of one's aim, one cannot appeal to some unmediated experience of telos, except the restricted telos of knowing that one knows. It seems likely, then, that the instrumentality of reflexive aware-ness cannot be established in terms of a mediated effect, and even as an unmediated effect the issue of arthakriya as telic function is nonsensical in this case. Thus, if we are to accept reflexive awareness as a trustworthy cog-nition, and if we are to maintain that trustworthiness means arthakriyiisthiti, we must again turn to an alternative interpretation of arthakriya, namely, that reflexive awareness is reliable in that it reveals the mere fact of experi-ence, which is the same as saying that it reveals the mere causal efficiency (arthakriya) of awareness. If we close this section by returning to the notion of a cognition in which appears the accomplishment of one's aim, we can now add an important 93 That reflexive awareness is noncausal follows from its simultaneity with its object, namely, the awareness that is reflexively perceived itself. Indeed, what can be most confusing about reflexive awareness is the notion that it is a cognition distinct from its object. This distinc-tion is clearly the case for all forms of perception, including mental perception (manasa-pratyak!a), for in all cases the object (grahya) of perception is its cause (see, for example, PV3.224). The same is true of inference, since it too arises indirectly from its object (see the succinct statement in PVSV adPVI.I; G:3.8: avyabhicaraf canyasya ko 'nyas tadutpattep, where tadutpatti is meant to apply to both effect-and svabhava-evidence). In contrast, what Dignaga first identifies as the three aspects of an awareness-namely, reflexive awareness, the objec-tive aspect (grahyakara), and the subjective aspect (grahakakara)-are all ultimately identi-cal and hence simultaneous. The notion that reflexive awareness is cognizing the subjective-"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 277 ;4ualification to the way we have characterized it so far. That is, even if such :\"icognition combines a telic meaning of arthakriya with the notion of an !~nmediated instrumental effect, it also places greater emphasis upon ;;rihakriya as ca~sal efficiency, in comparison to instrumental cognitions :that are considered trustworthy in terms of mediated effects. In the case of ~ese latter cognitions, trustworthiness means that they lead to some sub-~:ind objective-aspects is merely a way of conceptualizing the process of knowing (see the locus ;classicus in PSI.I.IO: yadabhiisa1J1 prameya1J1 tatpramti/}aphalate punap I griihakiikiirasa1J1vitti ;triiya1J1 niitap p.rthak k.rtam). Although Dignaga maintains that External Realism can propose :i:similar way of analyzing cognitions (PSI.I.9), this way of explaining cognitions assumes the Epistemic Idealist position. Dharmakirti accepts and elaborates upon Dignaga's opinion in Hie following verses [PV3-333-339]: \"If we maintain that an external object is experienced, what would be wrong with that claim?\" There is nothing wrong with it, but what is the point of saying this: \"An external object is experienced\"? [PV3.333] If awareness has the image of the object, then it must have something that distinguishes [each] image [for each awareness]. [PV3.334] It would be wise to look into whether that differentiation must come from something external, or whether it might just as easily come from something else. [I] There is no apprehension of an object devoid of qualification by the experience of it; and [2] when that experience itself is apprehended, the object is apprehended. Therefore for these two reasons, the cognitive appearance of blue is the experience (darfana) of blue. There is no independent (kevalap; cf. PVP:223a7) external object. Instead, something activates the internal imprint for some experience. It is due to that awakening of an imprint that there is the restriction [of a particular image] to a [par-ticular] cognition; that restriction is not dependent on an external object [PV3-335-336]. Therefore that one awareness which is experienced and remembered in that fashion has two aspects (dviriipa); the instrumental result is the reflexive awareness of both aspects [PV3-337]. When the object is considered to be other than the mind and established with a nature that is desired or not desired, then the object is the cause of the representation and the effect is the experience of that representation in that way, i.e., as desired or not desired [PV3-338]. If awareness includes the object (yadii savifaya1J1 jftiina1J1) due to the positing (vyavasthiti) of the object as an aspect (a1J1fa) of awareness [and not as actuallyexter-nal], then the determination (vinifcaya) of the object is just the awareness' experience ofitself.

For Devendrabuddhi, the resulting activity in question is secondarily one's ini-tial activity toward the object; primarily, activity means the \"activation\" (pravrtti) of a cognition to which appears the accomplishment of one's aim (arthakriyiinirbhasa). When an instrumental cognition is construed in terms of this latter activity, its trustworthiness consists of the fact that it results in such a cognition. We can refer to this as the \"confirmation-model\" of trustworthiness. Devendrabuddhi explains: A cognition is deemed trustworthy because it does not deceive people; this includes98 perception and inference, which have the characteristic of causing one to obtain (\"\" priipaka) the intended object.99 To comment on that, [Dharmaki:rti] says: \"trustworthi-ness is a cognition of telic function.

As we shall see in greater detail below, Devendrabuddhi is at points obliged to abandon this model.

Nevertheless, when beings act to obtain some human aim, they believe that the former and latter objects are the same, and beings thus behave accordingly. The crucial outcome of this answer is that, if the trustworthiness of an instrumental cognition is in at least some cases constituted by this model involving confirmation by a sub-sequent cognition, then the determination of an instrumental cognition's trustworthiness is in fact based upon an error, namely, the false belief that the object of the instrumental cognition and the object of its confirming 108 Sakyabuddhi (PVT, nyq5b6fl) comments on the last sentence: Thus, in saying therefore he means: \"since the latter instrumental cognition is impos-sible without the object of the former instrumental cognition.\" Therefore, since the real thing toward which one acted was etablished prior-i.e., prior to the latter cogni-tion whose object is the telic function-that initial cognition is instrumental. That is, since it is the cause of the latter cognition whose object is the telic function, the ini-tial cognition is instrumental, and it is such because it too has a real thing as its object.

This issue is broached when Devendra-buddhi notes, \"Since an instrumental cognition is this or that cognition ~hose trustworthiness has been ascertained, doubtful cognitions and such ~e not instrumental.\"109 In response, one may ask: \"But since a person may be obstructed in his activity, even an instrumental cognition may not be trustworthy, and it therefore would not be instrumental.\"l1o d'he objector here believes that, on Dharmakirti's view, what distinguishes in instrumental cognition from a doubtful cognition is that the former nec-~ssarily leads one to an object that can accomplish one's goal; in contrast, in instance of doubt might lead one to that object, but it will not necessarily ~~ so. Devendrabuddhi responds: That trustworthiness of an instrumental cognition does not con-sist of the fact that one definitely obtains the desired object {artha} through that instrumental cognition. Instead, it consists of the fact that one obtains only the desired object through that instrumental cognition.

What requires the mediation of other conditions is not determined. 133 Although Devendrabuddhi is here discussing the more particular case of determining the instrumentality of an awareness from reflexive aware-ness, Sakyabuddhi understands this observation to be more generally appli-cable: a perception is instrumental specifically with regard to that aspect of its object for which it can produce a specific kind of correct perceptual judgment, namely, an immediately subsequent definitive determination (pratyakJaPrfthalabdhanifcaya). We have already discussed the notion of definitive determination (nif-caya); in the context of perception, it is the conceptual cognition following upon a perception that interprets the content of that perception, which is necessarily nonconceptual and thus indeterminate. According to Dhar-maldrti, a perception may be capable of generating a subsequent definitive determination of some aspects of its object, but not of all aspects. One might, for example, be able to determinate that one is seeing a water-jug, but one may not be able to determine, on the basis of that perception alone, that the water-jug is momentary (kJa1Jika). As noted earlier and as Deven-drabuddhi remarks here, whether one determines one or another aspect of an object depends upon numerous factors, including the perceptual acuity of the perceiver.134 Drawing out the implications of Dharmakirti's theory of definitive deter-mination, Devendrabuddhi applies it to the instrumentality of perception in the aforementioned fashion. And expanding on Devendrabuddhi's analy-sis, Sakyabuddhi applies the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction: for a person who is seeking warmth, for example, a perception of fire that is intrinsically instrumental is one that can produce an immediately subsequent definitive determination of its object as \"fire\" or as a \"heat source,\" and so on. A per-ception that is extrinsically instrumental cannot do so, and if its instru-mentality is to be determined, one must depend upon confirmation by some later instrumental cognition. 133 PVP (5a5): ... bzung ba'i rnam pa gangyin pa dag fa yang nges pa skyed par byed pa de fa / Jugpar byed pa 'i phyir tshad ma nyid du 'dod kyi / gzhan du ni ma yin no / mthong ba las khyad par med na yang / rnam pa gang don du gnyer ba dang / goms pa dang skabs fa sogs pa nges pa 'i rgyu yod na de nges pa yin gyi / gzhan chod pa ni ma yin no. 134 See chapter 3 (n. 59)."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"296 FOUNDATIONS OF DHARMAKIRTI'S PHILOSOPHY And what of inference? Is it too sometimes instrumental intrinsically, and sometimes extrinsically? Continuing a passage that we cited earlier,135 Devendrabuddhi notes: Because various causes of error in the case only of perception are possible, it is [sometimes] known to be instrumental through the activation of a subsequent instrumental cognition that has as its object that thing's (artha) telic function; this is not the case with inference. That is, a property-svabhava used as an inferen-tial sign and an effect used as an inferential sign are restricted to being the property-svabhava of the real thing in question and the effect of the real thing in question, respectively, and only they [i.e., a property-svabhava and an effect] are the causes for the respective sign-awareness. Hence, if that kind of thing [i.e., a property-svabhava or effect] is absent, there is no inference. Therefore, inference does not rely on the engagement of a sub-sequent instrumental cognition.136 Unlike perception, inference is always intrinsically instrumental, and its instrumentality stems directly from the svabhavapratibandha, the invari-able relation between the evidence and the predicate to be proven (sadhya). The svabhavapratibandha guarantees the presence of a predicate with a specific kind of nature, precisely because, if the predicate (or the subject that possesses that predicate) did not have that nature, the evidence could not have the nature that it is determined to have. Smoke, for example, can have the nature of smoke only if it has been produced by fire; a maple can be a maple only if it is a tree.137 Thus, the dubiety that is possible in perception can never apply to inference, for if an inference is well-formed, it is indubitable.

There are, however, certain problems with the instrumentality of infer-ence, but before we consider them, let us examine one more topic under the rubric of perception: namely, the notion of perception as motivating action. PERCEPTION AS MOTIVATOR (PRAVARTAKA): THE QUESTION OF NOVELTY We have already mentioned the notion of the correct perceptual judgment that Dharmakirti calls a \"subsequent definitive determination immediately following upon a perception\" (pratyak!aPr!.thalabdhanifcaya). A key ques-tion, however, has yet to be raised: why is this theory introduced? The answer lies in a tension within Dharmakirti's philosophy: on the one hand, perception is necessarily nonconceptual, which is to say that it is indeter-minate: it cannot determine its object as being \"fire\" or \"water\" or any other entity. Dharmakirti shows no willingness to relinquish this point, and on my view, he is in part motivated by a concern that I have cast as \"axi-ological.\" Although Dharmakirti does not put the problem in this fashion, if perception were determinate, then universals would be ultimately real because universals would be the content of determinate perception, and perception apprehends what is ultimately existent. And if universals were real, then the arguments employed to refute them would be incorrect. These same arguments are employed against the self (atman), a distributed entity that can be considered a special case of a universal.138 Hence, if the arguments against universals are incorrect, the arguments against the self are incorrect. Thus, since Dharmakirti's soteriology rests finally upon the nega-tion of the self, his soteriology would be contradicted by the introduction of determinate perception.139 On the other hand, if perception is to initiate one's actions toward the accomplishment of a human aim, then it should be determinate: if one has not identified some object as \"fire,\" why would one seek its warmth? At 138 There is no doubt that on Dharmakirti's view, what he sometimes refers to as selfless (e.g., at PV2.135-13G) and sometimes as emptiness (e.g., at PV2.214d-215ab) is to serve as the \"antidote\" (vipak!a) to satkiiyadnti, and hence to all suffering. Dharmakirti does not, how-ever, provide any extended refutation of the self in either PV or PVSV. But as with the Abhidharmic analysis of sa1f1vrti-and paramiirtha-satya (see chapter I, 41), it appears that his refutations of distributed entities-especially universals-are meant to serve as the argu-ments to be employed for refuting the self. 139 For more on Dharmakirti's soteriology, see chapter 2 (Goff)."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY: JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE 299 issue here is the notion that part of what constitutes the instrumentality of a cognition in the context of human aims is that it is a \"motivator\" (pravar-taka) of action. As noted earlier, the notion of \"action\" (pravrtti) here is the secondary sense applied to that term by Devendrabuddhi when he addresses Dharmaklrti's claim that \"awareness is instrumental because it is the pri-mary factor in one's action toward an entity that one wishes to obtain or avoid\" (= PV2.3b-d). It is clear that Dharmaklrti himself is concerned with the argument that perception, as indeterminate, could not be instrumen-tal because it could not motivate action. In his Pramii1}avinifcaya, he raises the problem with an objector's voice: \"Well, now how can there be practical action (vyavahiira) from direct awareness, whose nature is not that of a definitive deter-mination? One could not engage in practical action because one acts in order to obtain things that cause happiness and avoid things that cause suffering only when one has made the definitive determination 'This is [a thing that causes happiness, etc.] .\"'140 To resolve this problem, Dharmaklrti must find a way to introduce a kind of determinacy into perception without actually claiming that per-ception is determinate. He does so with the following response: This poses no problem, since just when one sees the object, there occurs a mnemonic awareness that arises due to that perceptual awareness. Due to that mnemonic awareness, practical action occurs because of one's desire [to avoid or obtain some aim]. 141 [PVin:I.I8] Although direct awareness is the bare perception (Ita ba tsam = drHimiitra) of an object, just when one sees the object, there occurs a mnemonic awarenesJ'-i.e., one that is immediately following that experience-and due to that awareness, purposeful action occurs with regard to what one has seen as being what is desired or what is not desired. 142 140 PVin ad 1.18 (58.I2ff): '0 na da ni mngon sum ma nges pa'i bdag nyid las ji ltar tha snyad du gyur I 'di'o zhes bya bar nges na ni bde ba dang ,-dug bsngal gyi sgrub par byed pa dag thob pa dang spong ba'i don du Jug pa 'i phyir ro zhe na. 141 PVinr.I8: taddnfiiv eva dmefU sa1?Zvitsiimarthyabhiivina~ I smara?Jiid abhiliifepa vyavahiira~ pravartate / /. 142 PVin adLI8 (58.I5ft): I skyon 'di med de I ganggi phyirl don mthongba nyid mthongrnam"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"300 FOUNDATIONS OF DHARMAKIRTI'S PHILOSOPHY The introduction of the theory of definitive determination allows Dharmaldrti to attribute what might be called a clandestine determinacy to perception without actually claiming that perception is itself determinate. In doing so, he can salvage the claim that, in terms of obtaining a human aim, perception is instrumental because it is a motivator of actions oriented toward such aims. 143 Nevertheless, while introducing the notion of a subsequent definitive determination may solve some problems, it creates others. Consider specif-ically what we know from our previous discussion about an instrumental cognition (pramarza): in brief, it is a trustworthy awareness, where trust-worthiness in the context of a human aim means that it enables one to obtain an object that accomplishes one's aim. This way of characterizing an instrumental cognition can be reduced to one claim, namely, that it is \"what makes one obtain one's aim\" (prapaka). And to do so, it must also be \"what motivates action\" (pravartaka); otherwise, the question of obtaining an aim would be moot. . Since Dharmakirti maintains that only perception and inference are instrumental, he would have the description we have just given apply to those two types of cognitions, and only those two. We might grant that the description does indeed apply to perception and inference, but if no further specifications are made, a third type of cognition will also satisfy this description. Devendrabuddhi describes the problem in an objection: \"You say that an instrumental cognition is that which is trust-worthy with regard to the telic function when one acts having become aware of the instrumental object through that instru-ment. If that is so, then consider the case where one acts upon a water-jug through the conceptual awareness of a water-jug; when one does so that conceptual awareness is also trustworthy with regard to the telic function of acting in that fashion.

Therefore, the definition of instrumentality is faulty.\"I44 This objection is clearly tied to one raised by Dharmaklrti himself: [PV2.5d-6a:] \"The knowledge of a universal that follows the [perceptual] cognition of an object in itself (svarupa) would be instrumental.\" 145 The major problem here is definitive determination itself. That is, fol-lowing upon a habituated perception of a water-jug, in the proper context one will have the definitive determination, \"This is a water-jug.\" Since that perception leads to such a determination, it is considered instrumental. That is, in the case where one seeks the function(s) that a water-jug per-'forms, that perception can (indirectly) prompt one to act in such a fashion that one will definitely obtain what one seeks, provided that nothing hin-ders one's actions. But clearly, the same is true of that definitive determi-hation itself: it can effectively prompt a person who seeks a water-jug to act in such a fashion that, provided there are no obstructions, she will defi-nitely obtain the water-jug.146 In short, it is both \"what makes one obtain one's aim\" (prapaka) and \"what prompts (or guides) action\" (pravartaka). We have already seen that Dharmakirti is unwilling to admit such cog-nitions as instrumental, in part because that admission would lead him down a slippery slope to determinate perception and, hence, the ultimate Jeality of universals. Thus, he must add some further specification that will disallow the instrumentality of definitive determinations. In a reference to Dignaga's work,147 he does so by maintaining that such cognitions are \"con-'144 PVP (3a7ff): gal te gang gis shes nas Jug par 'gyur ba'i don byed par mi slu ba de ni de fa :tshad ma nyid yin pa de'i tshe I bum pa 'i mam par rtog pa 'i shes pa las I bum pa fa Jug pa de'i :.aon byed par mi slu bar 'gyur ba de ltar na I de yang tshad mar gyur na mi 'dod pa de bas na mtshan nyid khrugs [ex con). for PVP-D: zhugsl pa yin no I zhe na. ,145 PVZ.5d-6a: svariipiidhigate{l para1'(l II priipta1'(l siimiinyavijfiiinam. 146 It is worth noting that, in terms ofDharmaldrti's apoha-theory, a definitive determina-tion must therefore be a concept based on real things (bhiiviifraya), at least in relation to the :!Spects (iikiira) of the object relevant to the desired telic function.

This way of defining an instrumental cognition later comes under attack, ;for subsequent commentators, probably including Sakyabuddhi, maintain ~\\hat, since only novel cognitions are trustworthy, an explicit statement of inovelty is not necessary. Without going into the details of such arguments, ~\",e need only note that such interpretations do not abandon the criterion ~pf novelty; they simply subsume it under trustworthiness. The main moti-~vation here is probably in response to Devendrabuddhi's somewhat vague ~pproach to trustworthiness: he is apparently willing to apply the term ~.'trustworthy\" (avisa'f!lviida) to a definitive determination following on a ~erception, but he never explicitly states whether or not such ~ application ~ould be legitimate. By eliminating any such application, Sakyabuddhi ~(who himself is somewhat vague on this point) and certainly later com-~entators forego the need to adjust the overextension of the term \"trust-~orthy\" as a description of any pramii'(la; instead, they simply maintain ~~at what is trustworthy is necessarily novel in that it is a \"motivator of f~ction\" (pravartaka). 167 However, in contrast to Devendrabuddhi, these ~later interpretations obscure the likely motivations behind the various l~aims that Dharmaldrti makes. And since Devendrabuddhi's argument [firaws upon other portions ofDharmaldrti's work, his interpretation like-~Wise suggests how Dharmaldrti's presentation of instrumentality accords fiwith other elements of his philosophy, most notably his theory of defini-ftive determination (nifcaya) as a means of re-introducing conceptuality into ~erception. For these reasons, and in view of its subsequent impact upon fthe commentarial tradition, Devendrabuddhi's interpretation strikes me as ithe most useful starting point for an interpretation OfPV2.1-6. In any case, Devendrabuddhi's work certainly helps to clarifY the reasons for citing both trustworthiness and novelty as essential characteristics of any pramii'(la.168 li167 See, for example, PVT, nye:79a5ff, where Sakyabuddhi, by reducing the discussion of a l~econd characteristic to a matter of worldly convention, seems to suggest that an explicit [~tement of novelty is not essential to the definition of an insrtumental cognition. t1t68 Franco (1991 and 1997) has argued that Dharmakirti does not give a genetal definition Ipf an instrument of knowledge (pramii7Jll) anywhere in his works. This interpretation is ~argely based upon the argument that the particle vii in PV2.5 can only properly be con-~i~l:rued as a disjunction. Franco's work, which seeks a historical reading that at points must !:resist the commentaries, has elicited considerable comment (see for example, the exchange ~~etween Franco and Oetke in Katsura 1999).

These specifically focus on the fact that the objects of inference are unreal universals. As such, the objects of inference are incapable of any telic function, for since only ultimately real particulars can be causes or effects, only ultimately real particulars have telic function. 169 In their discussion ofPV2.I-6, neither Devendrabuddhi nor Sakyabud-dhi consider this issue at any length. Their comparative silence is probably due to the way they understand the overall argument of the Pramtitza-vtirttika-namely, that the entire preceding chapter (PVI) had already addressed these aspects of inference. Indeed, in the course of that chapter, Dharmaki:rti returns repeatedly to a crucial question: if conceptual cogni-tions-including inferences-take unreal universals as their objects, why would anyone bother with them? After all, reasonable or \"judicious\" (prek!tivant) persons seek to accomplish their goals, and to do so, they seek to obtain that which is capable of the desired telic functions. Why, therefore, would they concern themselves with cognitions whose actual content is inca-pable of any such functionality? Alluding to an answer, Dharmaki:rti employs a provocative metaphor to formulate the problem in the following verses: Through distinguishing the propositions that the thing in ques-tion is \"real\" and that it is \"unreal,\" those who do not deny the utility of an expression's meaning analyze the real thing itself, for the production of an effect depends upon that real thing. Why would those who seek the goal in question bother to ana-lyze something that is incapable of accomplishing that goal? Why salient outcome of this\" vii controversy\" may be the finding that, if we do not resort to com-mentarial interpretations, our conclusions on the matter are necessarily underdetermined by the available evidence, namely, DharmakIrti's laconic statements. This is not a problem in itself, but it is one that must be tolerated when we assay the difficult exploration of Dhar-maklrti's immediate historical context in isolation from the commentarial tradition. When, however, we seek to situate DharmakIrti within the commentarial tradition that follows him, our task is less difficult. Indeed, we find unanimity on the notion that DharmakIrti does pro-vide a general definition of pramii1Jd-and also that both trustworthiness and novelty are com-ponents of that definition (the only question being the issue of whether both must be explicitly stated).

In part, this involves what Tillemans has called an \"unconscious error,\" whereby the image is erroneously construed to be identical or \"mixed\" (sartZsr!ta) with the individual (vyakti, vastu) in which it is alleged to be instantiated. This identification (eki-Y kr) of image and individual is in part an epistemological error, in that it concerns the man-ner in which the universal is apprehended. But the error in question also involves an ontological imputation: namely, that the universal is construed as distributed in space and time. The universal \"cowness\" (gotva), for exam-ple, is understood to somehow qualifY all cows in all places at all times. 174 For Dharmakirti, the ontological and epistemological error in conceptual cognitions does not render inferences incapable of guiding one to entities that have the desired telic functionality. In the previous chapter, we have already examined at length how this is possible: the svabhiivapratibandha between evidence and predicate guarantees that the former is invariably indicative (gamaka) of the latter. But it is likewise essential to note that, from the standpoint of actually employing inferences in practical contexts, the aforementioned error is indispensable. 175 When one infers that that there uparw}addhi samiidadhiiti vii / yathiibhinivefam atattviit / yathiitattvarp ciisamihitatviit / tad ayarp pravartamiinalp sarvadii sadasaccintiiyiim avadhiritavikalpapratibhiiso vastv eviidhi!!hiini-karoti yatriiyarp puru!iirthalp pratibaddho yathiignau fitapratikiiriidilp / na hy atra fabdiirthal; samarthas tadanubhaviiptiiv api tadabhiiviit / tad ayam arthakriyiirthi tadasamartharp prati dattiinuyogo bhaviturp na yuktalp / na hi v!,!asyanti !al}tjhasya riipavairiipyaparik!iiyiim ava-dhatte. 174 See the account of the apoha-theory in chapter 2 (II3fI). 175 The most concise statement of this notion is: \"Even though they [i.e., the particulars] do not appear [in an awareness of a universal], the world engages in practical action through the error of imagining [that the conceptual image is the particular)\" [PVSVadPVI.Io6; G:5P-3: atatpratibhiisinyapy adhyavasiiyavibhramiid vyavahiirayati lokam]."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"INSTRUMENTALITY, JUSTIFYING THE SOURCES O F KNOWLEDGE ) I} is fire in me hearth by obsetving smoke pouring from me chimney, if one does nOt h.a~ the belief that thc concqn ~fire\" that is the object of this inferen« somehow participatC$ in the raJ (i.e., tdially efficient) fire in me hc:anh, one obviously will not go insilk to warm oncsdf.

But one admits their instrumentality until one attains \"foundational trans-formation,\" which refers to the elimination of the form of ignorance (avidya) that underlies the errors in conceptual cognitions.178 This implies that after foundational transformation, inferences are no longer instrumen-tal for that person. In short, Dharmaki:rti appears to maintain that, from at least some rarefied perspective, inferences are not ultimately instrumental, for once a person has obtained the human aims for which such cognitions are useful, why would one continue to admit the instrumentality of such cognitions? Why would one continue to carry one's raft on one's back?

Having such an imprint, the cognition is in this context an instrumental cog-nition in terms of being trustworthy for practical action, and the nature of these conventional (saYj1vyavaharika) instruments of knowledge has been stated. Others are confused-and cause con-fusion-even in regard to these conventional cognitions. Hence, it is only those who cultivate the wisdom born of contemplation that thereby orient themselves toward the ultimate instrumental cognition that is devoid of error and immaculate.182 Although all perceptions are distorted by the internal distortion, one can still distinguish between perceptions that are instrumental and those that are not. In effect, one can do so because the internal distortion is always present in an ordinary being's mind: for as long as a being is in saYj1sara, the defect that causes the distortion remains. Since all beings in saYj1sara have the imprint, they are all equally confused in this regard, and they thus can interact consistently within that mutual confusion. In a similar context, a later Buddhist thinker speaks of two persons who, because they have the same ocular defect, can hold an intelligent conversation about the two moons that they see.183 Other, additional, errors are not \"stable\" (drdha) and all pervasive, and they therefore can be contravened by other perceptions 182 PVin adI.59 (roO.12ft): de yang shes pa thams cad kyi yul bzlogpa na bsfadpa dangcigshos su ji ltar smra ste / khyad par med pa'i phyir ro zhe na / nye bar bsfad pa'i bag chags mtshams sbyor ba med pa'i skyon gyis mi mkhas pas kyang tha snyad fa yid brtan du med par mthong bas gcig ni tshad ma ma yin par brjod fa / gzhan ni bag chags brtan pa 'i phyir 'khor ba ji srid bar mi 'bral bar rjes su 'breI pa ni tha snyad fa mi slu ba fa ltos nas 'dir tshad ma yin no /'di ni kun tu tha snyad pa 'i tshad ma'i rang bzhin brjod pa yin te / 'di fa yang pha rol rmongs pas Jig rten slu bar byed pa'i phyir ro / bsam pa las byung ba nyid kyi shes rab goms par byas pas rnam par 'khrul pas dben zhing dri ma med fa log pa med pa don dam pa 'i tshad ma mngon sum du byed do.

Returning now to the intrinsic instrumentality of habituated percep-tions, we see that the notion of nature plays a critical role in Dharmakirti's theory. Such a perception is considered to be instrumental because it imme-diately produces a correct judgment concerning the relevant causal capac-ities of the object in question. And the correctness of that judgment is warranted by the very nature of the object itself. Read in this fashion, Dhar-makirti's thought appears to be a fairly straightforward brand of realism, in combination with a nominalist stance toward universals. In the context of instrumentality, his thought appears to rest on a kind of internalist foun-dationalism, where knowledge is ultimately rooted in the indubitability of habituated perceptions. We come to such a conclusion, however, only if we ignore other contexts in which the notion of nature appears. In our analysis of svabhavaprati-bandha, for example, we saw that, for Dharmakirti, an entity's \"nature\" must be a conceptual construction that represents the totality of that entity's causal characteristics. While that construction is restricted by the causal functionality of the particulars involved, it is nevertheless mind-dependent, in that factors such as interest, acuity and habituation always playa role in the formation of concepts according to Dharmakirti's apoha-theory.2 Another way to express this point is to note that, if two persons are observing the same perceptual object, the images produced in the minds of those persons are unique particulars. As particulars, those images differ, and whatever might be the causal variations in the non-mental factors, the differences in the minds involved will make those images different. Hence, the \"nature\" of the object in question is in significant ways reflective of the mind in which that object is being perceived.3 This dependence on the par-ticular state of a being's mind might lead us to think even more strongly 2 See the discussion in chapter 3 (I84£). 3 Note that, on DharmakIrti's view, the particular conditions in the production of an effect will slightly alter that effect such that it may have a distinctive quality; hence, even if it may be counted as the same as other effects in a general sense, its particularity will distinguish it even from those other effects. This basic point is made in PVI.2I: \"It is seen that substances have different kinds of capacities due to the differences in conditions, such as location. Because one has observed such a special capacity in a thing in one place, it is not correct that one is certain of the existence of that special quality in the same kind of thing in another place\" [defadibhedad drfyante bhinna dravye!u faktayap I tatraikadntya nanyatra yuktas tadbhavanifcayap }."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"}l.4 FOUNDAT IO NS O F DHAlMAKIATI'S PHILOSOPHY Ihal Dharmaldni is rc:soning 10 an inlernalisr found.arionalism rooted in irrerngable and prival~ se:nse: ciao, blU in fia, Dh:annakini clearly rejects the ultimai(' rdiabiliry of such data, The previow chapter ended with a reference ro Dharmaldni's norion of an \"inranal diston ion,\" which applies only at the level ofEpine:mie Ideal-ism, Through that diHonion, all the pe:rce:ptions of ordinary persons are conraminaled by ignorance.

That is, even though the lifeworld experienced by ordinary persons is contami-nated by the internal distortion and other such problems, they can usually agree on what they are seeing. In other words, their perceptions cohere in regard to most daily issues.? We might think, then, that we have returned to some admixture of internalist foundationalism, confirmed by an appeal to coherence. The ultimate arbiter of a habituated perception's intrinsic instrumentality amounts to the fact that our perceptual content appears a certain way to us, and in this sense the theory resembles an internalist foundationalism. But when we examine our perceptual process rationally, we uncover cer-tain contradictions that point to fundamental distortions (such as the inter-nal error) in that process. Concerned that our sense data may therefore be somehow compromised, we confirm our interpretations of our perceptions by appealing to what others report, and we find that everyone from whom we can receive a verifiable report is in agreement, at least to a degree that 6 Along the lines of Asa.ti.ga' s Mahiiyiinasal?lgraha (I5b-I6b), this case is raised by Vasubandhu in his Virrtfatikii, a text that Dharmakirti probably considered important. Sakyabuddhi and Devendrabuddhi refer quite clearly to the Vil?lsatikii (see the translation in Appendix 7, espe-cially notes 14 and 18). The point of the example is that the same locus is seen by different communities of beings in divergent ways. Vinltadeva (I77a) limits his interpretation to dif-ferent communities of hungry ghosts; this is less striking (and less well known) than the notion that beings in entirely different karmic states are having radically different experi-ences of the same spatiotemporallocus. In Dharmakirti's time, Candrakirti refers to such a case (Madhyamakiivatiira 6.71), but a particularly clear account is offered much later by Asva-bhava in his commentary (82b-83a) on a verse from Kampala's Alokamiilii: Due to the variety in their karma, when pretas look at one river, it is filled with pus, and it likewise has the scum of urine and excrement; that is, it has a scum that is a mix-ture of feces and urine. But when humans look at that same river, they see it as clean; and they drink it.

That is, due to the mutual influence of their cog-nitive representations, all beings' cognitive representations mutually restrict each other, as is appropriate\" [anyonyiidhipatitvena vijfiaptiniyamo mitha~ /r8ab/ sarve!iil?l hi sattviiniim any-onyavijfiaptyiidhipatyena mitho vijfiiipter niyamo bhavati yathayogam}"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION ~enables us to engage in practical actions about subjectively obvious sense t~bjects, such as a glass of water.

Metaphorically, we might say that we are all wearing defective .lasses of a certain type.

We can thus rely on Ihose habituated perceptions at face value, at least for the purpose of daily ~~> ~atters.

Speculatively, we might say that the goal is to alter the dispositions that, from the perceiver's side, contribute to the construction of a perceptual object's nature. In other words, the tran-sition from one lifeworld to a more refined one is facilitated by coming to see the world in a certain way, which in effect means learning to construct natures in a particular fashion. The construction of nature; however, is not a matter of manipulating sense data after they are in place; rather, it is cre-ating a mental context in which sense data will appear a certain way, within the constraints posed by the causal characteristics of the objects in question. For Dharmakirti's purposes, perhaps the most effective way of shaping the mind in this fashion is reasoning. Consider, for example, the reasoning that leads one to understand that a seemingly perdurant entity-such as a water-jug-is in a constant state of instantaneous flux. Through the careful application of that reasoning and subsequent contemplation of the conclusions that one reaches, one eventually begins to see such entities as momentary. In other words, one starts with an unhabituated perception: the water-jug just looks utterly per-durant, and this perception is therefore not instrumental in regard to the water-jug's momentariness; indeed, the notion that it is momentary may seem so counterintuitive that it is at the very edge of what we can plausi-bly entertain. Applying, however, the appropriate inferential reasoning to that perception, one realizes that the water-jug is indeed momentary. Even-tually, by using reasoning and contemplation to habituate the mind to the momentariness of such objects, one no longer needs to rely on an inference: the object now appears momentary when one gazes upon it; that is, one may immediately determine that it is momentary without appealing to any inter-vening inference. Gaining this insight, one has effectively left behind one faulty lifeworld-in which beings see and react to such objects as if they were perdurant-and moved on to a more refined one, in which at least that one error has been eliminated.8 8 I am alluding again to the verse cited earlier from Santideva (BCA 9:3-4ab): \"In this regard, it is observed that there are two kinds of persons, the spiritual adept (yogin) and the ordinary person. Among these, the ordinary person is refuted by the adept. And adepts are refuted by successively more advanced yogins through a distinctive quality of their understanding\" [tatra loko dvidha dmo yogi prak.rtakas tatha I tatra prakrtako loko yogilokena badhyate II badhyante dhivife!era yogino 'py uttarottarai{ll}.

[PVI.34cd] 2Smoke is established to be the effect of fire from being seen to be so just yonce because, were it not its effect, it would not occur even once from that which is not its cause. And if an effect were to exist without its cause, then it would be causeless. For that which exists without something else does not have that other thing as its cause. If smoke were to exist without fire, then fire would not be the cause of smoke. Someone objects, \"It would not be causeless because something else could be its cause.\" Such is not the case because the same problem applies, since smoke occurs when fire is present, even if that other, alleged cause is absent.

In the same way, in terms of having the same cause,one can express what is non-singular with a single expression in order to facilitate practical action. Examples are \"Hereford,\" \"Jersey cow,\" or \"a sound arises immediately after effort,\" or \"sound is causally produced.\" One can also express multiple things with a single expression as a negation of their abil-ity to have the effect in question. Examples include: \"sound is not visually perceptible\"; or \"impermanent\"; or \"essenceless {aniitma).\" One can also use expressions in this fashion as negations of the notion that certain things have the cause in question. Instances include the expressions \"unowned\" (asviimikajI3 and \"empty.\" One may also state other ways in which expres-sions are formed in accord with the theory presented above. In the case of expressions such as \"empty\" and \"impermanent,\" expressions perform their semantic function (vyapadefa) by [first] inducing in cognition an image that is intended in accord with the interlocutor's concepts and then excluding that image. Expressions work this way because all the objects (artha) gf expressions have a distinctive aspect that is projected by cognitive intent. 14 13 Sakyabuddhi (PVT:r64b2 ~ K:274.r3) remarks: Others assert that that which is controlled (adhiJthita) by an autonomous self is \"owned,\" and such things are also asserted to be non-empty because they are con-trolled by that kind of controller (adhiJthiitr). The controller is what appropriates (svikararza) that which is controlled (adhiJthiitavya); otherwise, it could not be the controller. Therefore, others use words such as \"owned\" (sviimika) with respect to some self being a cause for such a relation. But there is no controller with an established essential nature who would control things that disintegrate instantaneously and exist in dependence upon a mere collocation [of conditions or parts]. There is no such con-troller in connection with which the mental conditions (sa1pSkiira) would occur. There-fore, \"unowned\" and \"emptiness\" are posited by refuting the existence of the aforementioned self acting as a warrant [for the designations \"owner,\" etc.]. lor K(274.r4) iidhiJthiitii ciidhifphiitavyasvikiirarzam Sakyabuddhi (PVT:r64b3) reads bdag gi 'ryed pa nyid kyang bdag gir bya ba'i ryu yin gyi.

Hence, they are a source of inferential knowledge with regard to other objects. [PVI.2I7] That credible person taught what to avoid, what to do, and the methods for each; what he taught in regard to these issues is not erroneous, and ;hence, those teachings are trustworthy. An example is the Nobles' Four Truths, in the way that will be explained.13 Since those statements are trust-worthy, the assumption (upagama) that other statements-which are use-ful for accomplishing a human aim and suitable to be practiced-are also 11 Sakyabuddhi (PVT:246a '\" K:394) remarks: It does not indicate just the speaker's intention. [K The word just (eva) should be read in a different order [than what is recorded]]. Instead, since it is trustworthy in the man-ner just described with regard to an object (artha) that cannot be known by either per-ceptual awareness or [non-scriptural] inference, it is also an inftrence from the perspective of the intention of a person who wishes to engage in activity. [K: But it is not actually (vastutas) an inference because there is no relation between expressions and objects]. f'l2 We supply from context the phrase, \"the statements of the credible person in question.\" i,That we are dealing with the trustworthiness of a credible person's statements is evident '.from the way that Dharmakirti introduces the verse (PVSV adPVI.217; G:I09.II-I2): \"Alter-\"natively (atha vii), we state in another way the fact that, since the speech of a credible person }s trustworthy, [knowledge derived from that speech] is inferential.\" [athaviinyathiiptaviidasyii-j~iJisa7(lviidiid anumiinatvam uryate]. 1;Y' :13 Dharmakirti is referring to the discussion in PV2."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"366 FOUNDATIONS OF DHARMAKIRTI'S PHILOSOPHY trustworthy with regard to other issues will not lead to one's deception because [1] there is no instrumental knowledge that contradicts that assumption, and [2] it is pointless for that speaker to make false statements without a purpose. !4Thus, in the two ways [described in these two verses]; it is said that a cognition coming from scripture is an inference since there is no other way for one to proceed, as is illustrated by the thought, \"If one is to act in aCcor-dance with scripture, it is best to do it thus.\" However, this kind of infer-ence is not without problems (anapaya), since expressions are not invariably concomitant with objects, as has been already pointed out. Others think that a statement dependent for its origin on a supe-rior person is in accord with reality (yathartha). [PVI.218ab] According to others,!5 a credible speaker (apta) is a person with good qual-ities such as experience of things as they truly are (yatharthadarfana); that person's teachings (pra/:zayana) are trustworthy. 14 Introducing this next statement, Sakyabuddhi (PVT:247a2-4; absent in K) raises an objec-tion: \"A person who is trustworthy and who acts so as to benefit others will necessarily not deceive others about any object or issue if s/he perceives the supersensible (atindriya-darlin), but one cannot be certain that s/he can perceive the supersensible. Therefore, his statements may be trustworthy with regard to a human aim that is knowable (bgrod par bya ba ~ gamya) through reason, but due to a lack of knowledge, his state-ments may be deceptive about extremely remote human aims or objects.\" [gal te skyes bu gtso bo'i don fa bslu bar [Po mtl byed pa yin fa / gzhan fa phan pas Jug pa dbang po las 'elas pa 'i don mthong ba can yin na / gdon mi za bar 'ga' zhig fa gzhan mi slu bar gyur ba yin pa de'i dbang po las 'das pa'i don mthong ba nyid ni nges par nus pa ma yin no / de bas na rigs pas bgrod par bya ba'i skyes bu'i don fa mi bslu ba yin gyi mi shes pa nyid kyis na shin tu skog tu gyur pa la bslu bar yang gyur ro zhe na I] . The sense of this objection is clear: one cannot guarantee that the trustworthiness of such a person necessarily extends to extremely remote objects. Sakyabuddhi continues: It is true that this is an issue (don ~ artha) concerning which one cannot be certain. But the Buddha is posited (bzhag pa) as such [i.e., as credible,] in terms of an indi-vidual's [soteriologicallyoriented] activity. In order to demonstrate this, [Dharmaklrti] says ....

But it is not possible for one who has inculcated the coun-teragents of the flaws to see good qualities in the flaws because their opposites [i.e., the states that counteract the flaws] are free of negativity. They are free of negativity because [I] in them all flaws are eliminated; [2] they are devoid of the suffering that comes from negative orientations (paryavasthana) and birth; and [3] they never turn away from the taste of the bliss of peace.25 Dharmakirti, as well as Sakyabuddhi and Devendrabuddhi, understands the realization of selflessness to be a state that is natural to the mind. On this verse, Sakyabuddhi (PVT:250b) comments: It is free of negativity because it is devoid of all the negativities of sa1J2sara. A real object (bhiitartha) means that its object (artha)-which is to say its object (vifaya) that are particulars such as the impermanent and so on-are real in that they are not distorted (aviparita). And precisely because it apprehends a real object, it is the path-state (marga) that is the nature of the mind. That is, in mentioning the real object, he refers to the mind's object (artha). In this regard, when the mind functions through super-imposed images, it is confused; since that superimposed image is not the nature of the mind, the faults are adventitious since they are occurring through superimposed images. If even in the state where one has not yet cultivated the path it still makes sense for the path-mind (lam gyi serns) to be the nature of the mind because it is confirmed by an instrumental cognition, then why would it not be the nature of the mind when one has cultivated the path? As it says in the second chapter (PV2.2IOcd-2uab): The mind is by nature luminous cognizance (prabhiisvara). Defilements are adventitious. The defilements do not have the capacity to arise in the mind even [when one just intellectually understands selflessness] prior to [actually meditating on it]. So they obviously cannot arise in the mind that has the nature of that realization of selflessness after [one has perfected one's meditation on self-lessness]. 23 This verse is identical to PV2.212cd-213ab. 24 Sakyabuddhi (PVT:25Ia) reads 'dod pa for gh.r1Jii, but the sense of \"disgust\" seems more appropriate here. 25 These three are the opposites of the three \"negativities\" (upadrava).

This conflicts with many ofDhar-makirti's Brahmanical opponents, and to introduce Dharmakirti's verse, Devendrabuddhi raises a typical objection (3b4).} \"But why is an awareness with the aforementioned kind of image instru-mental and not the faculties and so on?\" [The answer is Dharmakirti's verse.} Awareness is instrumental because it is the primary factor in one's action toward an entity that one wishes to obtain or avoid. [PV2·3b-d] [To clarifY the point being made here, Devendrabuddhi (3b4./JJ makes an important innovation: he introduces the notion of \"mediated\" (vyavahita) and \"unmediated\"(avyavahita) instrumental effects (pramar:taphala). He begins by answering the question he posed just above-''Why cannot the sense faculties themselves be considered instrumental?,] Because it is not possible for the faculties to be instrumental. To be specific, there are two kinds of instrumental effects: one called a \"human aim\" which is a mediated effect and a distinctive one that is not mediated.20 Having known through awareness an aim that should be done, a person implements its means and thereby attains the activity defined as the direct apprehension of it. Likewise, knowing that some thing is to be avoided, a person does not implement its means and thereby obtains the activity of not directly apprehending it. Thus, awareness is instrumental because it is the primary factor in one's activity with regard to a real thing that one should obtain or avoid. That is, it is the primary factor-awareness is the primary 20 Sakyabuddhi (PVT, nye:77h2-3) glosses distinctive as meaning that it \"will definitely occur\" (gdon mi za bar 'gyur ba). He remarks: [Devendrabuddhil says that it is \"distinctive.\" The distinction is that it will definitely occur. Since that way of occurring is fulfilled (spyod pa = carita) by that kind of effect, it is called\" distinctive.\" In other words, if there is an instrumental cognition, an instru-mental object (j>ramrya) will necessarily be cognized (rtogs par 'gyur) because that object is not different from the instrumental cognition.

And since this effect exists when that is present-i.e., when irhe object-image is present-awareness is therefore instrumental. If when :\"y\"is present, \"x\"comes into existence, it makes sense that \"y\"is the most ~fficient cause (shin tu sgrubs par byed pa = sadhakatama) of \"X.\"23 But if at some point there were no such effect [i.e., \"x'1 when \"y\"was present, then one would realize that \"y\" depends upon some other mediating causal fac-ior. That being the case, since that former cause ''y''is mediated by some-thing else on which it depends, it would not be the most prominent causal factor. Therefore, it would not be the instrumental cause. Even when the sense faculties and so on are present, they do not [necessarily] have the causal function of producing an awareness because they are mediated by the object-simulacrum.

Devendrabuddhi briefly discusses and rejects the Mima1!lsaka solution-namely, that all instruments of knowledge are intrinsically instrumental (svataJ:t .pramal).yam).

Since a perception does not arise in a piecemeal fashion, that instrumentality should also be apprehended. Nevertheless, that awareness is asserted to be instrumental concerning that objective aspect (bzung ba'i rnam pa = griihyiikiira) with regard to which it produces a definitive determination (nifcaya) because it causes action toward that aspect. It is not instrumental with regard to any other aspect. Even though there is no difference in terms of being experienced, there is the definitive determination of that aspect for which there are the causes of definitive determination, such as interest, habit-uation, context and so on. What requires the mediation of other conditions is not determined. Therefore, although one has already apprehended the instrumentality when one perceives an extant awareness, it is as if one had not apprehended because there is no definitive determination of it. \"How then is one to determine instrumentality?\" [To answer this question, Devendrabuddhi cites the first portion of Dharma-kirti s next verse.} Instrumentality is known through practical action (vyavahiira).

Therefore, if it is singular, then it cannot have a plural image. tSakyabuddhi (PVT, nye:20Ia-b) comments: [Devendrabuddhi says,] then in ultimate terms that variegated or multicolored awareness would establish that the real thing was also variegated or multicolored. This means the fol-lowing. {20Ib} An ultimately singular cognition arises with a variegated/multicolored cognitive image due to that kind of object (artha). The external real thing that deter-mines the cognition which apprehends that image is thereby established. Likewise--as is the case with the singular cognition that has a variegated/multicolored cognitive image-it would be real. !He (20rb) also comments on Devendrabuddhi's phrase, !f (the cognition) is singular, it ulti-imately does not have a variegated nature: That is, it does not have a variegated essential nature because if its essence were varie-gated, then it would be contradictory for it to be singular. Instead, the cognition appears with a variegated cognitive image due to cognitive error. On Devendrabuddhi's comment, therefore, ifit is singular, it cannot have a plural image, he says (20Ib-202a): If cognition is singular, then it cannot have a plural cognitive image; rather, cognition {202a} just has the nature of mere reflexive awareness which is devoid of dualiry. Devendrabuddhi (PVP:r93b) also comments on the last part of the verse: !fone is content to have this be the objects' essence-that is, even though they do not have that nature [of being external], they become apparent (gsal ba '\" vyakta) in terms of that nature; if ultimately abiding in that manner is their suchness, why should we bother refuting it? The idea is that one should just let it be so. Sakyabuddhi (PVT, nye:202a) comments: \"If there is no variegated external real thing, and if there is no singular cognition with a variegated image, then how does cognition appear with the color of the external object in a manner that is restricted to -a particular time and place?\" In response to such a qualm, [Deveridrabuddhi] says, !fone claims .... One speaks of an \"object\" due to the imaginative apprehension of that which is by nature the cognizer's (sgrub pa po = prati-pattr) cognitive error as being an object. Those appearances are not [actually] objects because the constructed nature does not exist at all. What is being asserted? [Devendrabuddhi] says, even though they do not have that nature, they become apparent in terms of that nature. The phrase even though they do not have that nature means \"even though they do not have the nature of being exter-nal.\" They become apparent-they appear-in terms of that nature-in terms of being external. The phrase, if ultimately abiding in that manner is their suchness, means the following. Appearing as having a nature that they do not have is the way that they ultimately-really-abide because there is an instrumental cognition that establishes that appearance. Therefore, that appearance is not unmistaken suchness. The idea here is that since the cognition of them as external objects is contradicted by an instru-mental cognition, that appearance of them as external is not suchness."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF DUAilMAKlIlTl'S PHILO SOPHY Therd'orc:, neither the objttU nor me awareness has a spatially extended appeannct: bca~, sinct that kind of propcny-lVo1'bhiv.rr [-namdy, spatial extension-l has already been disproved in the case of a singular emiry. it is also not possible in the case of what is many.

Therefore, the emptiness of duality is the suchness (tattva) of the awareness. [PV3.213] The definition (sarrzsthiti) of things as different is based on the difference is apprehended as part!ess (eha med pa nyid kyi phyir= ana1[lfatvena) by reflexive aware-ness, as a result of its connection with the seeds of error, that reflexive awareness does not produce a subsequent definitive determination of the nature of cognition as non-dual in the way that it has been perceived (rtogs pa ; pratipatti). Therefore, even though reflexive awareness has already apprehended the non-dual nature of cognition, it is as if it has not been apprehended. But this in and of itself does not establish that the cognition is not a general [i.e., unqualified] subject of predication. That is, the qualities (khyad par; vise!a) that one might wish to predicate of the subject \"cognition\" would be duality or non-duality. Even though these might be in dispute, no reasonable person would be able to say that since the reality of the distinct qualities (bye brag; bheda) under dispute are not yet determined, the mere subject of predication itself is also not determined. That is, when \"sound\" and such is established as a general subject of predication, one might argue about whether or not it is momentary; in that case, one would then use an inference to determine whether it is momentary. \"If one cannot say that the mere subject of predication is not established just because the quality of being momentary and such is not established prior to the inference, then how could any evidence be unteliable by way of not having an established locus of predication? One would have to accept that a general subject is established in all cases of inference.\" If it were the case that one could say that, then when one had definitively deter-mined the subject, one would also definitively determine the predicate that is under dispute. That being the case, it would be pointless to seek out evidence that had the three requisite characteristics. Therefore, in this context one has established through perception that cognition (rtogs ; pratipatti) is a predicate that has the quality of being pleasant and such. Nevertheless, due to one's cognitive error, one has not defin-itively determined its non-dual nature. Thus, in order to establish that, one employs an inference. The proof statement is as follows. That entity that is contradictory to some prop-erty-svabhiiva is devoid of that property-svabhiiva. For example, heat, which con-tradicts the property-svabhiiva of being cold, is devoid by nature of being cold. The essential nature of cognition contradicts the properry-svabhiiva of being dualistic in the manner discussed above. {205a} The evidence used here is the perception of a contradictory antecedent. Therefore, it remains the case that mere reflexive aware-ness is what constitutes selfless things (dharma) that are devoid of the aforemen-tioned dualiry; it is not, however, devoid in all respects. When the Prajiiiipiiramitii and so on cites the refutation of things being essential singular or plural, and when it refutes production and so on, it does so in terms of the constructed nature; it does not do so in terms of the non-dual dependent nature. Hence, only awareness that appears dualistically presents distinct qualities such as production; mere reflexive awareness does not do so."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"APPENDIX OF TRANSLATIONS ~n mose (i.e., the object and me subject].\" If the aw:ucoCSI is crfO. ncous (lIjWpi4IN1), men meir dilfcno:nce is also erroneous.IPVp4] There is no definition of mings outside: of the definition of mem as cime:r objcca or subjccu, rThosc: definitions do not uJrimatdy make scnsc;) mere-fore, since mings are empty of any definition, it is aplained mat they aJ'e cssencdc:ss.
