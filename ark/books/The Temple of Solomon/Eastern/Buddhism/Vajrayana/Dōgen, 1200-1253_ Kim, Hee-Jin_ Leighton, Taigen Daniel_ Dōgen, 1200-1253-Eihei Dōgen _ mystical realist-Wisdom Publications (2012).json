This bookis an excellent comprehensive introduction to Dōgen’s massive corpus ofintricate writings as well as to his elegantly simple yet profound practice. Kimclarifies that Dōgen’s philosophy was at the service of his spiritual guidanceof his students, and reveals the way Dōgen incorporated study and philosophyinto his religious practice.Since this book was first published in 1975, and even more since the revisededition in 1987, a large volume of reliable English-language translations andcommentaries on Dōgen have been published. And a widening circle of variedmeditation communities dedicated to the practice espoused by Dōgen has developedin the West, with practitioners eager to study and absorb his teachings.I have been privileged to contribute to the new body of Dōgen translations andscholarship. Other translators such as Shohaku Okumura, Kazuaki Tanahashi,Thomas Cleary, and Francis Cook have all made Dōgen’s writings much moreavailable to English readers, and now we even have a serviceable translation ofthe entirety of Dōgen’s masterwork Shōbōgenzō, thanks to Gudo Nishijima andChodo Cross. These new translations supplement the excellent early translationsof Norman Waddell and Masao Abe that predate Kim’s book, but have only recentlybecome more accessible in book form. Furthermore, excellent commentaries onspecific areas of Dōgen’s life and teaching by such fine scholars as StevenHeine, Carl Bielefeldt, William Bodiford, Griffith Foulk, and James Kodera, toname a few, have created a thriving field of Dōgen studies in English.Nevertheless, after all this good work and a few years into the twenty-firstcentury, this book by Hee-Jin Kim from the early years of English Dōgen studieseasily still stands as the best overall general introduction to Dōgen’steaching, both for students of Buddhist teachings and for Zen practitioners.Even beyond the realm of Dōgen studies, this book remains a valuablecontribution to all of modern Zen commentary, with Kim’s accessible presentationof thorough scholarship that does not reduce itself to dry intellectual analysisof doctrines or historical argumentation. Kim provides a subtle and cleardiscussion of Dōgen’s work as a practical religious thinker and guide, showingthat Dōgen was not merely a promulgator of philosophy, and never considered hiswork in such terms.Kim unerringly zeroes in on key principles in Dōgen’s teaching. The organizationof this book is extraordinarily astute. After first providing background onDōgen’s biography and historical context, Kim discusses with subtlety Dōgen’szazen (seated meditation) as a mode of activity and expression. Kim then focuseson the centrality of the teaching of Buddha-nature to Dōgen’s teaching andpractice. Finally, Kim elaborates the importance of monastic life to Dōgen’steaching and training of his disciples.In explicating the purpose of zazen for Dōgen, Kim enumerates the meaning andfunction of key terms that provide the texture of Dōgen’s teaching and practice:the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity (jijuyū-zammai), the oneness ofpractice-enlightenment (shushō-ittō), casting off of body and mind(shinjin-datsuraku), non-thinking (hishiryō), total exertion (gūjin), andabiding in one’s Dharma-position (jū-hōi).With all the confusion about meditation in Zen, historically and today, we mustbe grateful at the acuity of the introduction to Dōgen’s zazen that Kim hasprovided. Unlike other forms of Buddhism and even other Zen lineages, Dōgenemphatically does not see his meditation as a method aimed at achieving somefuture awakening or enlightenment. Zazen is not waiting for enlightenment. Thereis no enlightenment if it is not actualized in the present practice. And thereis no true practice that is not an expression of underlying enlightenment andthe mind of the Way. Certainly many of the kōans on which Dōgen frequently andextensively comments in his writings culminate in opening experiences forstudents in encounter with teachers. And the actuality of the zazen practicestill carried on by followers of Dōgen may often include glimpses, sometimesdeeply profound, of the awareness of awakening. But such experiences are justthe crest of the waves of everyday practice, and attachment to or grasping forthese experiences are a harmful Zen sickness. The Buddha’s awakening was justthe beginning of Buddhism, not its end. Dōgen frequently emphasizes sustaining apractice of ongoing awakening, which he describes as Buddha going beyond Buddha.Although current meditators may appreciate the therapeutic and stress-reducingside-effects of zazen, for Dōgen, as Kim clarifies, zazen is primarily acreative mode of expression instead of a means to some personal benefit. In oneof the hōgo (Dharma words) in Dōgen’s Extensive Record (Eihei Kōroku), Dōgenspeaks of the oneness not only of practice-enlightenment, but the deep onenessof practice-enlightenment-expression. Just as zazen is not waiting forenlightenment, expounding the Dharma—the expression of awareness—does not waitonly until enlightenment’s aftermath. There is no practice-enlightenment that isnot expressed; there is no practice-expression of Buddha-dharma that is notinformed with enlightenment; and there is no enlightenment-expression unless itis practiced. We might say that Dōgen’s zazen is a performance art in which itsupright posture and every gesture expresses one’s presentenlightenment-practice. Kim explicates how such creative practice-expression isnot a matter of some refined understanding, but of deep trust in the activity ofBuddha-nature: “Zazen-only cannot be fully understood apart from considerationof faith.”Kim skillfully describes how this unity of practice-enlightenment-expression istrue not only for zazen, but also for Dōgen’s study of the sutras and kōans aswell: “Our philosophic and hermeneutical activities are no longer a means toenlightenment but identical with enlightenment, for to be is to understand, thatis, one is what one understands. Thus the activity of philosophizing, like anyother expressive activity, is restated in the context of our total participationin the self-creative process of Buddha-nature.”The expression of practice is a dynamic, creative activity. While Dōgen’steachings are complex, we can find his focus in untiring expression of theradical non-duality of Buddha-nature, as he emphasizes not fleeing or fearingthe realm of everyday experience, but full-hearted creative engagement in it. AsKim states, “Dōgen’s emphasis is not on how to transcend language but on how toradically use it.”Dōgen is extremely playful in freely overturning classic teachings to bringforth the inner dynamic of nondual liberation, in which forms are revealed asalready empty and open from the outset. The most famous example is when Dōgentransposes the sutra statement that “All beings without exception haveBuddha-nature” to “All beings completely are Buddha-nature.” But again and againin diverse contexts, we see, as Kim says, “Dōgen’s creative and dynamicinterpretation of the Buddhist doctrine of means in which the means in questionis not transcendence of duality but realization of it.”Kim’s work provides us with the background to enjoy and play along with Dōgen’steachings for ourselves, in the light of the universal liberation ofBuddha-nature.Kim discusses how Dōgen enacted his practice-expression and trained a fine groupof disciples in his monastic retreat, Eiheiji, in the deep mountains far northof the capital during his last decade. Dōgen cannot be understood aside from hisaesthetic sense of wonder as it informs communal practice in the world of natureamid the mountains and rivers. There in the mountains Dōgen trained an excellentgroup of monk disciples who, along with their successors in the next fewgenerations, would spread the tradition of Sōtō Zen introduced by Dōgenthroughout much of the Japanese countryside, so that it became one of the mostpopular sects of Japanese Buddhism. Paradoxically, Dōgen’s emphasis on care foreveryday activities in the monastery provides a forum for practice that mayreadily be translated to predominately lay practice in the world, the primarymode of current Zen practice in the West. Kim conveys how Dōgen’s teachingserves as a basis for popular expression, stating: “However lowly one’s symbolsand practices as we see in, say, a peasant’s religion, one is entitled toenlightenment if and when one uses them authentically. Here is the egalitarianbasis for a claim that Dōgen’s religion is a religion of the people.”I might quibble with Kim’s fine treatment of Dōgen only inasmuch as he does notbring into discussion the important later work Eihei Kōroku (Dōgen’s ExtensiveRecord), which contains most of what we know about Dōgen’s later teachings atEiheiji, and his actual training of his great disciples. I have had the pleasureand privilege of recently completing a translation of this massive work togetherwith Shohaku Okumura. Overshadowed by Dōgen’s more celebrated writingShōbōgenzō, Eihei Kōroku has only recently received the attention it deserves.But impressively, Kim notes even this work, and its comparative neglect, in hisexcellent appendices, which include a very thorough account of Dōgen’s manywritings, and a good chronology of his life.Kim has given us not only an excellent and reliable reference for Dōgen’swritings, but also an entry into how to play with Dōgen in going beyond Buddha.Students of Dōgen’s teaching and thought must now be grateful to have this fineguidebook to Dōgen’s world again available in print.TAIGEN DAN LEIGHTON is a Zen priest and Dharma heir in the lineage of SuzukiRoshi.

The book was reissued in 1987 as DōgenKigen: Mystical Realist, with Robert Aitken Roshi’s foreward, and went out ofprint in the summer of 1999. The present edition has undergone a considerableamount of minor changes and corrections, largely in the translations of Dōgen’sworks. However, the fundamental thrust of my methodology and interpretationregarding Dōgen’s Zen remains intact. Considering shortcomings in my reading ofand approach to Dōgen, as well as enormous developments that have taken place inDōgen studies for nearly thirty years since my book’s original publication, Ishould have undertaken an extensive revision. In fact, the editor of WisdomPublications kindly suggested some updating. But I chose not to for a variety ofreasons—above all was my wish to retain the integrity of the original work, forbetter or worse. This wish has nothing to do with my imperviousness to recentadvances in the field. Indeed, to fill this lacuna to a certain extent, I haveopted to present a very brief sketch of some of the developments and issues inDōgen scholarship, with a special emphasis on those in the United States.Translating Dōgen’s writings, especially his Shōbōgenzō, is a daunting task forany and all translators. Yet in the past three decades or so, there haveappeared a spate of translations in Western languages, the overwhelming numbersof which are in English and are published in the United States. In his writings,Dōgen treated language with the utmost care; scrupulously constructed andcrafted, his language was intimately entwined with the scope and precision ofhis thought. For this reason, every translator of Dōgen must address questionsnot only on how to be attuned to the intricacies and subtleties of Dōgen’slinguistic and religio-philosophical world, but furthermore how to render themcogently in his/her chosen language with full justice. From this perspective, ofmany translations, Norman Waddell’s and Masao Abe’s The Heart of Dōgen’sShōbōgenzō;1 [notes.html#pre_1] Francis Dōjun H. Cook’s How to Raise an Ox: ZenPractice As Taught in Zen Master Dōgen’s Shōbōgenzō, Including Ten NewlyTranslated Essays and Sounds of Valley Streams: Enlightenment in Dōgen’s Zen,Translation of Nine Essays from Shōbōgenzō;2 [notes.html#pre_2] CarlBielefeldt’s translations of the Shōbōgenzō “Sansuikyō,” “Zazenshin” fasciclesand others;3 [notes.html#pre_3] Kazuaki Tanahashi’s Moon in a Dewdrop: Writingsof Zen Master Dōgen and Enlightenment Unfolds: The Essential Teachings of ZenMaster Dōgen;4 [notes.html#pre_4] Yūhō Yokoi’s (with Daizen Victoria) Zen MasterDōgen: An Introduction with Selected Writings;5 [notes.html#pre_5] and a fewothers are notable.6 [notes.html#pre_6] Although they are to be commended fortheir worthy contributions, there is still a long and treacherous road fortranslation in this field, in terms of quantity and quality alike. Just as Dōgenstruggled eight centuries ago to find new expressions for his times with theSino-Buddhist and medieval Japanese languages, so the translator todayconstantly seeks a new language for the present-day audience through his/herencounter and dialogue with Dōgen. Inasmuch as his thought is elusive and hislanguage difficult, Dōgen will never be an easy read, even with the help ofthose reliable translations.Beyond the foundational work of translation, critical scholarship has also madesubstantial growth in diversified areas, subjects, issues, and methods. I wouldlike to briefly review Dōgen scholarship in North America, and for the sake ofconvenience, despite the risk of oversimplification, I will approach this reviewin terms of three areas: textual-historical, comparative-philosophical, andmethodological-hermeneutical. In the broadly textual-historical area, thefollowing works are noteworthy: Takashi James Kodera’s Dōgen’s Formative Yearsin China: An Historical Study and Annotated Translation of the Hōkyō-ki;7[notes.html#pre_7] William M. Bodiford’s Sōtō Zen in Medieval Japan;8[notes.html#pre_8] and Carl Bielefeldt’s essay “Recarving the Dragon: Historyand Dogma in the Study of Dōgen” and his Dōgen’s Manuals of Zen Meditation.9[notes.html#pre_9] Bielefeldt, particularly in his essay, sets the tone ofcurrent textual-historical criticism well. He not only challenges the Sōtō Zensect’s hagiographic image of Dōgen as the sole legitimate inheritor in thetransmission of Buddhism from the Buddha through Bodhidharma and Ju-ching,Dōgen’s Chinese mentor, but also highlights shifts and contradictions withinDōgen’s statements in his Shōbōgenzō, particularly between his writings in theearly and later periods. In Bielefeldt’s view, Dōgen’s “new sectarianism” ismanifested in his later-period writings, revealing “more about Zen in Japan thanin China,” e.g., Dōgen’s relation to the Nihon Daruma-shū of Dainichibō Nōninand his disciples, a large number of whom joined Dōgen’s group after theirmaster’s demise. Charitable or not, Bielefeldt forcefully repudiates asterilized image of Dōgen, as well as a single unified message in theShōbōgenzō. This is salutary indeed, to the extent that Bielefeldt’s revisionisthistoriography contributes to liberating Dōgen from orthodox captivity and leadsus to a better understanding of Dōgen without obscuring other aspects of hismultifaceted religion. It goes without saying that the nature and significanceof discrepancies between the early and later Dōgen are still issues of intensedebate among scholars.In the comparative-philosophical area of Dōgen scholarship, Nishitani Keiji’sReligion and Nothingness;10 [notes.html#pre_10] Masao Abe’s Zen and WesternThought and A Study of Dōgen: His Philosophy and Religion;11 [notes.html#pre_11]T. P. Kasulis’s Zen Action/Zen Person;12 [notes.html#pre_12] Joan Stambaugh’sImpermanence Is Buddha-Nature: Dōgen’s Understanding of Temporality;13[notes.html#pre_13] Steven Heine’s Existential and Ontological Dimensions ofTime in Heidegger and Dōgen;14 [notes.html#pre_14] and Carl Olson’s Zen and theArt of Postmodern Philosophy: Two Paths of Liberation from the RepresentationalMode of Thinking15 [notes.html#pre_15] are representative works. Dōgen iscompared particularly with Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida among Westernphilosophers; many comparativists’ articles have appeared in Philosophy East andWest and other philosophical journals. Affinity between Dōgen and postmodernthinkers has been highlighted in terms of their emphasis on thenonsubstantiality and radical relatedness of all things, theirnonrepresentational view of language and thinking, self-subversion, and so on.The discovery of Dōgen as a philosophical thinker, however, was strictly amodern phenomenon in Japan; although an unmistakable and captivatingphilosophical streak exists in his thought, to regard him as a dharmalogian inits full-fledged sense is problematic. This is precisely because his overridingconcern is religious and soteriological. And yet, the comparative-philosophicalapproach, by and large, tends to lift Dōgen’s thought from its religious andhistorical moorings. For this reason, Dōgen would have frowned upon any attemptto ahistoricize or atemporalize his religio-philosophical thought. Of thosecomparative-philosophical interpreters of Dōgen, Abe has been by far the mostactive and influential in the West by explicating a number of key notions, suchas Buddha-nature, the oneness of practice and attainment, time and space, anddeath. He is also regarded as the leading exponent of Zen in the West today,just as D. T. Suzuki was a generation ago, and has a philosophical inclinationakin to Nishida Kataro’s Kyoto school of Japanese philosophy. Thus, some criticspoint out a subtly veiled cultural/spiritual nationalism in his universalistic,suprahistorical interpretation of Zen, which he is said to harbor in his Zen andWestern Thought.16 [notes.html#pre_16] This same critique holds true ofNishitani, as well as Abe’s mentor Hisamatsu Shin’ichi. Even so, we should notforget that genuine critique is one in which critique of the other is alwaysself-critique.17 [notes.html#pre_17]In contrast to the textual-historical and comparative-philosophical approaches,my essay “ ‘The Reason of Words and Letters’: Dōgen and Kōan Language”18[notes.html#pre_18] further pursues what I extensively discuss in this bookregarding how Dōgen does his religion, especially his way of appropriatinglanguage and symbols soteriologically. In this essay, I delineate Dōgen’s methodunder the seven principles, demonstrating how he explores and experiments withsemantic possibilities of Buddhist concepts and images, such as “dreams,”“entwined vines,” “the flowers of emptiness,” and numerous others. Dōgen doesthis by shifting syntaxes, changing word order, appropriating polysemouspotentialities of words, creating neologisms, resuscitating some forgottensymbols, and so forth. These hermeneutical moves demonstrate Dōgen’s view ofrealization—that is, that language and thinking constitute the core of Zenpraxis. In a similar methodological-hermeneutical vein, Steven Heine, in hisDōgen and the Kōan Tradition: A Tale of Two Shōbōgenzō Texts,19[notes.html#pre_19] deftly interweaves recent textual-historical findings ofDōgen/Zen studies in Japan with the method that he calls “discourse analysis,”which is heavily couched in postmodern literary criticism, and thus elucidatesthe historical and literary continuity between Dōgen’s writings and the kōantradition of China. The two key texts in his analysis are the Mana Shōbōgenzō(or Shōbōgenzō sambyakusoku, Dōgen’s own collection of three hundred kōan casesin Chinese without commentary) and the Kana Shōbōgenzō (the one we usually referto by the name Shōbōgenzō, written in Japanese). Although long consideredapocryphal, the authenticity of the Chinese Shōbōgenzō has been established inrecent studies. Dōgen seems to have used this kōan collection as the basis forhis writings and presentation, especially in relation to the JapaneseShōbōgenzō. Heine locates these two texts in the context of the rich and complexkōan tradition of Chinese Zen and concludes that Dōgen’s Shōbōgenzō was “anoffshoot or subdivision of the kōan-collection genre” (which flourished in theeleventh through thirteenth centuries) that could be traced to “encounterdialogues,” the root of all Zen literary genres. Dōgen’s texts were thus firmlyembedded in the Chinese kōan tradition; in turn, Dōgen enriched this traditionwith his own innovative hermeneutical principles and religio-philosophicalreflections. Heine, with Dale S. Wright, also coedited The Kōan: Texts andContexts in Zen Buddhism, a significant addition to the study of the kōan.20[notes.html#pre_20] Speaking of the kōan in Dōgen’s Zen, we should remember thatDōgen, throughout his career, endeavored to revise and refine his meditationmanuals such as the Fukan zazengi, as Bielefeldt presents in his aforementionedbook. Dōgen’s view of zazen, along with that of the kōan, evolved throughout thedifferent periods of his life.As the foregoing outline of the textual-historical, comparative-philosophical,and methodological-hermeneutical approaches/areas shows, all the issues,problems, and methods revolve around the central question: What was Dōgen’s Zen(or religion)? To put it differently: What were the origins, evolution, andnature of Dōgen’s Zen? All other questions radiate from this central concern inan open-ended, fluid fashion. What was the significance of discrepancies betweenDōgen’s early and later writings? Was there continuity and/or discontinuitybetween the early and later Dōgen? What was the relation between zazen and thekōan? Between meditation and thinking? How Japanese was Dōgen’s Zen? What wasthe nature of his originality? A host of other questions arises—yet in the finalanalysis, every question has to do with the identity of Dōgen.Having said this, let me briefly touch upon the recent controversy of CriticalBuddhism (Hihan Bukkyō) that originated in Japan but has stirred heated debatesamong scholars in Dōgen and Buddhist studies alike on both sides of the Pacificin the past two decades or so. Hakamaya Noriaki and Matsumoto Shirō, two of themost vocal proponents at Komazawa University (Sōtō Zen), hold that Tendaihongaku (original enlightenment) thought—closely connected with the notions oftathāgata-garbha and Buddha-nature, and ubiquitous in Japanese history frommedieval times to the present day—is heretical because of its substantialistview of an inherently pure mind/original enlightenment and its uncriticalaffirmation of the phenomenal world as absolute (including delusions, desires,and passions). From this perspective, the proponents of Critical Buddhismcriticize the absolutization of a given world and the blind acceptance of thestatus quo as contrary to the original Buddhist philosophy that, according tothem, espoused the critical spirit, nonself/emptiness, dependentorigination/causation, impermanence/time, difference, and so forth. Moredirectly related to Dōgen studies is Hakamaya’s controversial study of the(“old”) seventy-five-fascicle text and the (“new”) twelve-fascicle text—the twomost important among many versions of the Shōbōgenzō—which contends that thelatter be given normative status over the former. Reversing the conventionalinterpretation of the two texts, Hakamaya insists on the primacy of thetwelve-fascicle text as reflecting Dōgen’s “decisive viewpoint” of hisanti-hongaku stance and his mature thinking regarding nonsubstantiality,causation, and impermanence. He contends that Dōgen’s entire writings should bereexamined from this perspective. Critical Buddhism seems to have served somewholesome functions that (a) heightened Buddhist awareness in Japan of somepressing contemporary social issues, (b) intensified debates regarding theextent to which Dōgen’s Zen is continuous and/or discontinuous with Tendaihongaku thought, (c) called scholarly attention to the relationship between the“old” and “new” texts of the Shōbōgenzō with renewed sensitivities, and (d)shook Sōtō Zen orthodoxy to its core.21 [notes.html#pre_21]I would like to make the following comments on Critical Buddhism: (1) Dōgen wascritical, if not directly and explicitly, of Tendai hongaku thought as bothdoctrine and ethos because of (a) the dangers of its latent substantialistinterpretation and (b) the disastrous ethical implications of antinomianism,fideism, and skepticism that resulted from its potential misuses and abuses.Dōgen, however, did not reject hongaku thought entirely on the grounds that itwas antithetical to Buddhism, as the Critical Buddhists do; hispraxis-orientation was inspired and informed by, as well as within, the hongakudoctrine/ethos. (2) From this standpoint, Dōgen deeply imbibed hongaku discourseas radical phenomenalism, which became the crux of his soteriological vision. Infact, his entire religion may be safely described as the exploration andexplication of this radical phenomenalism in terms of its linguistic, rational,and temporal dimensions, as well as the endeavor to overcome itsever-threatening religio-ethical perils. And (3) in his religio-philosophicalimagination and discourse, Dōgen boldly, yet judiciously, employedhongaku-related concepts and symbols in his search for “the reason of words andletters” (monji no dori). In doing so, he strove throughout his life to clarifyand refine his expressions as consistent with his praxis-orientation and thecritical spirit of emptiness.In the auxiliary areas of Dōgen studies, the following works are significant:John R. McRae’s The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch’an Buddhism;22[notes.html#pre_22] Bernard Faure’s The Rhetoric of Immediacy: A CulturalCritique of Chan/Zen Buddhism, Chan Insights and Oversights: An EpistemologicalCritique of the Chan Tradition, and The Will to Orthodoxy: A Critical Genealogyof Northern Chan Buddhism;23 [notes.html#pre_23] James W. Heisig and John C.Maraldo, eds., Rude Awakening: Zen, the Kyoto School, and the Question ofNationalism;24 [notes.html#pre_24] Donald S. Lopez, Jr., ed., Curators of theBuddha: The Study of Buddhism under Colonialism;25 [notes.html#pre_25] CharlesWei-hsun Fu and Steven Heine, eds., Japan in Traditional and PostmodernPerspectives;26 [notes.html#pre_26] and Jacqueline I. Stone’s OriginalEnlightenment and the Transformation of Medieval Japanese Buddhism.27[notes.html#pre_27] McRae’s book advances a view of the formation of earlyChinese Zen that is far more complex than conventionally thought—one in whichthe ancestral transmission of Dharma from Bodhidharma to Hui-nêng, respectivelythe first and sixth ancestors of the orthodox Zen lineage, is now construed aslargely the product of the Southern school’s sudden enlightenment ideology andpropaganda. Thus, McRae asserts that the old distinctions between gradualenlightenment and sudden enlightenment, between the Southern and Northernschools, and so forth, must be fundamentally reassessed. Stone in her workpresents Tendai hongaku thought as “a new paradigm of liberation” that affirmedthe phenomenal world as the expression of inherent enlightenment, and as the“transsectarian” discourse that was shared by all the Buddhist schools ofmedieval Japan. Her investigation of hongaku discourse conclusively demonstratesthe inadequacy of the traditional tension between the “old” (“decadent” Tendai)and the “new” (reformist Kamakura) Buddhism that privileges the latter over theformer, and thus calls for a reevaluation of the nature and significance ofKamakura Buddhism.28 [notes.html#pre_28] In view of Stone’s study, CriticalBuddhism’s anti-hongaku thesis, especially in relation to Dōgen studies, seemsreductionistic and elitist due to its failure to take the historical aspects ofhongaku thought into consideration. Robert H. Sharf’s article, “The Zen ofJapanese Nationalism” in Lopez’s book,29 [notes.html#pre_29] exposes culturalbiases in past Zen scholarship that were initially planted by Japanese Zenapologists in the West, such as D. T. Suzuki. These cultural biases subsequentlyinfluenced the Western view of Zen—namely, a view of Zen as “pure experience”that is unmediated and ahistorical, the quintessential expression of Japanesespirituality (through the way of the samurai, Japanese art, the tea ceremony,etc.), “the essence of Buddhism,” and even the basis for the polemics ofJapanese uniqueness (nihonjinron). This is contrary to the West’s “orientalism”(Edward Said), or what Faure dubs “Zen orientalism” or “reverse orientalism.”30[notes.html#pre_30]I would like to point out that Dōgen scholarship is constantly challenged by,and is in no way immune to, the competing realities of multiple orientalisms.Perhaps it is fair to say that scholars today are more acutely aware than everbefore of the historical situatedness and conditionedness of not only theimmediacy and purity of Zen experience but also of scholarly activity itself,with its hidden biases, limitations, needs, and vulnerabilities. For bothpractitioners who pride themselves on the sui generis character of their Zenspirituality and academics who are content with the alleged objectivity of theirprofessional practice, it is sobering to think that practitioners and scholarsalike are ultimately in the same boat with respect to “the loss of ourinnocence.” Despite his insistence on nonduality, or precisely because of it,Dōgen would have welcomed such sensibilities and reflections.That said, nothing is fixed; everything is temporary and temporal. For all thediversity and sophistication of methodologies and interpretations in recentDōgen scholarship, everything still remains uncertain, and yet, this should notlead us to conclude that everything is arbitrary or absurd. Admittedly, althoughwe have abandoned our search for the essential, rarefied Dōgen, only now can itpossibly dawn upon us that we can at last genuinely encounter “the nakedflesh-mass” (shakunikudan) of Dōgen which bares his whole being inside out, justas it is. That Dōgen, who continues to lure, intrigue, and challenge us to thisday, is in constant making.With respect to this new edition, I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness tothose authors and works cited in the text and notes of this new preface forchallenging and stimulating my understanding of Dōgen, including many more notcited here because of a lack of space. My special thanks goes to people atWisdom Publications for their efforts to make this publication possible;especially to my editor at Wisdom, Josh Bartok, who in 2002 initiated theproject and guided me throughout its progress with his enthusiasm and kindness.I also thank my daughter, Pearl Kim-Kregel, for her editing and word processingwork during her pregnancy, and her husband, Mark Kregel, for his computerexpertise. And lastly, but not least, I am ever grateful to my wife Jung-Sun,for her support, care, and patience.Hee-Jin KimEugene, OregonWinter 2004"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD TO THE PREVIOUS EDITIONBY ROBERT AITKENTHE WAY OF DŌGEN ZENJI [toc.html#for1]Hee-Jin Kim’s Dōgen Kigen—Mystical Realist [as the first edition was titled] wasthe first comprehensive study in English of Dōgen Zenji’s writings, and for thepast twelve years, it has served as the principal English language reference forthose Dōgen scholars who work from his thirteenth-century Japanese, and forWestern Zen students reading translations of his writings. This revised editionappears in a scholarly setting that now includes many new translations andstudies of Dōgen, and thus it is most welcome.Dōgen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touching with everysentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation andrealization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void. He moved freelyfrom the acceptance of a particular mode as complete in itself to anacknowledgment of its complementarity with others, to a presentation of itsunity with all things—and back again. He wrote of the attitude necessary forunderstanding, of the practice required, of the various insights that emerge,and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners—most of hispoints require very careful study, and a few of them elude almost everybody.These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language ofhis time. It has been said that he wrote in “Dōgenese,” for he made verbs ofnouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings topresent his particular understanding.Thus the writings of Dōgen are an immense challenge to anyone seeking toexplicate them in English, but Dr. Kim does a masterful job. In this Foreword, Ido not presume to explicate Dr. Kim’s words, but offer a personal perspective ofDōgen in the hope that it might serve as access to Dr. Kim’s incisivescholarship.I choose as my theme a key passage in the “Genjō Kōan,” the essay that Dōgenplaced at the head of his great collection of talks and essays, the Shōbōgenzō,using Dr. Kim’s translation:To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self.To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To beenlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind ofthe self as well as those of others. Even the traces of enlightenment are wipedout, and life with traceless enlightenment goes on forever and ever.To study the Way is to study the self. Asian languages offer the same options asEnglish for the meaning of the word “study.” “A Study of Whitehead” would be thepresentation of an understanding of Whitehead. Thus the first sentence of thepassage quoted also means, “To understand the Way is to understand the self.”The term “Way” is a translation of Dō in Japanese, Tao in Chinese. It is theideograph used to identify the central doctrine of Taoism and its basic text,the Tao te ching. Kumarajiva and his colleagues in the early fifth centuryselected Tao as a translation of Dharma, a key Sanskrit Buddhist term meaning“law,” or “way of the universe and its phenomena,” or simply “phenomena.” InDōgen’s view, all phenomena are the Buddha Dharma—the way of the universe asunderstood through Buddhist practice.Indeed, for Dōgen, to study and understand the Buddha Way is to practice theBuddha Way, and to practice the Buddha Way is to have the self practice. It isimportant to understand that practice, like study, is both action andattainment. Modes of practice: zazen (Zen meditation), realization, and thecareful works that transcend realization—all these are complete in themselves,and they are also means for further completion. They are aspects of a single actat any particular moment, and they are also stages that appear in the course oftime.As to the self, it has no abiding nature, and “kisses the joy as it flies.” Itis the Buddha coming forth now as a woman, now as a youth, now as a child, nowas an old man, now as an animal, a plant, or a cloud. However, animals andplants and clouds cannot “study” in Dōgen’s sense, so in this context, Dōgenintends the human being that can focus the self and make personal the vast andfathomless void, the infinitely varied beings, and their marvelous harmony.To study the self is to forget the self. Here Dōgen sets forth the nature ofpractice. My teacher, Yamada Kōun Rōshi, has said, “Zen practice is a matter offorgetting the self in the act of uniting with something.” To unite withsomething is to find it altogether vivid, like the thrush, say, singing in theguava grove. There is just that song, a point of no dimension—of cosmicdimension. The “sole self ” is forgotten. This is something like the athlete whois completely involved in catching the ball, freed of self-doubt and thoughts ofattainment, at the same time aware of the other players and their positions.Using this same human ability on one’s meditation cushion is the great Way ofrealization. It must be distinguished from thinking about something. When youare occupied in thinking, you are shrouded by your thoughts, and the universe isshut out.There are other analogies for gathering oneself in a single act of religiouspractice, freeing oneself of doubt and attainment. Simone Weil sets forth theacademic analogy:Contemplating an object fixedly with the mind, asking myself “What is it?”without thinking of any other object relating to it or to anything else, forhours on end.1 [notes.html#for1_1]Dōgen often uses the phrase, “mustering the body and mind” to understand oneselfand the world. Using Dr. Kim’s translation of a later passage in the “GenjōKōan”:Mustering our bodies and minds we see things, and mustering our bodies and mindswe hear sounds, thereby we understand them intimately. However, it is not like areflection dwelling in the mirror, nor is it like the moon and the water. As oneside is illumined, the other is darkened.This mustering is zazen—and also the activity of the Zen student who is groundedin zazen. Dr. Kim quotes Dōgen writing elsewhere in the Shōbōgenzō:The Buddhas and Tathāgatas have an ancient way—unequaled and natural—to transmitthe wondrous Dharma through personal encounter and to realize supremeenlightenment. As it is imparted impeccably from Buddha to Buddha, its criterionis the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity.For playing joyfully in such a samādhi, the upright sitting in meditation is theright gate.With the practice of zazen, mustering body and mind, we understand a thingintimately by seeing or hearing, and the self is forgotten. This kind ofunderstanding is not by simile, it is not a representation, like the moon in thewater, but is a brilliant presentation of the thing itself, and a completepersonal acceptance. One side is illumined. There is only that thrush. At thesame time, the universe is present in the shadow. The other players are stillthere.To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. The term“enlightened” is shō, the same shō found in inka shōmei, the document given to asenior student by a master confirming him or her as a teacher. The thrushconfirms you, enlightens you, but be careful not to give “enlightenment”anything more than provisional status. It is likely to be just a peep into thenature of things. Nonetheless, “One impulse from a vernal wood” or the MorningStar shining over the Bodhi tree is a communication. It works the other way,from the self to the object, but the result is different, as Dōgen makes clearearlier in the “Genjō Kōan”:That the self advances and confirms the myriad things is called delusion; thatthe myriad things advance and confirm the self is enlightenment.2[notes.html#for1_2]The way of research and analysis is “called” delusion. Don’t condemn it, Dōgenis saying. By advancing and confirming and throwing light upon all things of theuniverse, you reach intellectual understanding. However, when you forgetyourself in mustering body and mind in the act of practice, there is only thatparticular act, in that particular breath-moment. Then, as Dr. Kim says, thewhole universe is created in and through that act. With this you experience thethings of the universe. They are your confirmation, your enlightenment.To be enlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mindof the self as well as those of others. When you focus body and mind with allyour inquiring spirit upon a single matter, the self is forgotten. The myriadthings communicate their wisdom with their forms and sounds, and the emptiness,harmony, and uniqueness of the ephemeral self and the world are understoodclearly. This is reminiscent of Paul’s “putting off the old man”—not merelyforgetting but dying to the self.Casting off body and mind should not be confused with self-denial. Many peoplesuppose that they must get rid of the self. The Buddha too went through a phaseof asceticism, avoiding food and sleep in an effort to overcome his desires.Such a path has a dead end, as the Buddha and others have found. We need foodand sleep in order to cast off body and mind. The Way is gnostic rather thanascetic.Finally, as Dōgen says, when you cast off body and mind, all other beings havethe same experience. One version of the Buddha’s exclamation under the Bodhitree reads, “I and all beings have at this moment entered the Way!” This doesnot mean, “All beings can now come along.” Rather, at the Buddha’s experience,all beings simultaneously cast off body and mind.When Hsüeh-fêng and Yen-t’ou were on pilgrimage together, they became snowboundin the village of Wushantien. This gave them time for an extended dialogue,during which Hsüeh-fêng recounted his various spiritual experiences. Yen-t’ouexclaimed, “Haven’t you heard the old saying, ‘What enters from the gate [thatis, by intellection] cannot be the family treasure’?” Hsüeh-fêng suddenly haddeep realization and exclaimed, “At this moment, Wushantien has becomeenlightened!”3 [notes.html#for1_3]With his exclamation, Yen-t’ou cast off body and mind. Simultaneously,Hsüeh-fêng did the same. The whole village was likewise affected, proving Bell’stheorem a thousand years and more before Bell.Even traces of enlightenment are wiped out, and life with tracelessenlightenment goes on for ever and ever. Wiping away the intimations of pridethat come with a realization experience are the ultimate steps of Zen practice,steps that never end. They form the Way of the Bodhisattva, polishing the mindof compassion, engaging in the travail of the world, “entering the marketplacewith bliss-bestowing hands.” Over and over in kōan practice, the Zen studentworks through the lesson of casting off, casting off.A monk said to Chao-chou, “I have just entered this monastery. Please teach me.”Chao-chou said, “Have you eaten your rice gruel?”The monk said, “Yes, I have.”Chao-chou said, “Wash your bowl.”4 [notes.html#for1_4]“Have you eaten your essential food?” “Yes, I have.” “If so, wipe that idea ofattainment away!” For our limited purposes this would be an explication ofChao-chou’s meaning. What is left after body and mind are cast off? Endlesslycasting off—ongoing practice. The “Genjō Kōan” ends with the story:When the Zen teacher Pao-chê of Ma-ku was fanning himself, a monk asked him,“The nature of wind is constant, and there is no place it does not reach. Whythen do you fan yourself?”Pao-chê said, “You only know that the nature of wind is constant. You don’t yetknow the meaning of its reaching every place.”The monk asked, “What is the meaning of its reaching every place?”Pao-chê only fanned himself. The monk bowed deeply.The nature of the wind is Buddha nature, “pervading the whole universe.” Themonk’s question is an old one. If all beings by nature are Buddha, why shouldone strive for enlightenment? Dōgen himself asked such a question in his youth,and his doubts fueled his search for a true teacher. Pao-chê takes the monk’swords “reaching every place” as a figure of speech for Zen Buddhist practicethat brings forth what is already there. As Dōgen says in his comment to thisstory—the final words of the “Genjō Kōan”:Confirmation of the Buddha Dharma, the correct transmission of the vital Way, islike this. If you say that one should not use a fan because the wind isconstant, that there will be a wind even when one does not use a fan, then youfail to understand either constancy or the nature of the wind. It is because thenature of the wind is constant that the wind of the Buddha House brings forththe gold of the earth and ripens the kefir of the long river.The wind of the Buddha house, the practice of zazen, realization, and goingbeyond realization, is altogether in accord with the wind of the universe, theBuddha Mind. As Dōgen says elsewhere, “The Dharma wheel turns from thebeginning. There is neither surplus nor lack. The whole universe is moistenedwith nectar, and the truth is ready to harvest.”5 [notes.html#for1_5] Theharvesting of truth, the practice of forgetting the self, the practice ofrealizing forms and sounds intimately, the practice of polishing our mind ofcompassion—this is our joyous task.Robert AitkenKoko An Zendo, Honolulu1987"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION [toc.html#pre1]FOR NEARLY HALF A CENTURY since D. T. Suzuki published his first series ofEssays in Zen Buddhism in 1927, Zen has been taking firm root in Western cultureand has continued to grow steadily, both in its dissemination and its depth ofunderstanding. Indeed Suzuki’s introduction of Zen to the West was one of theepoch-making events in Western cultural history, and it rightfully became thebeginning of a great experiment that has been ongoing ever since—although notwithout some whimsical and misguided by-products in the course of itsevolutionary process.If Zen has a universal element that transcends historical and cultural bounds,it should be nurtured here in the West with its own distinctive marks andimprints. Just as Zen has evolved differently in the different countries of EastAsia and Vietnam, so has it transformed itself into “Western Zen,” (or “AmericanZen” for that matter) which is on the verge of emergence. Based on the sheernumber of publications in this field, the mushrooming growth of meditationcenters across Western countries, and its impact upon such fields as art,philosophy, psychology, religion, and folk culture, we can readily witness theintensity and fervor of this cultural experiment.Despite all this, systematic study of Dōgen in the West today is virtuallynonexistent. As a result, Western knowledge of Zen is painfully fragmentary, notonly in quantity, but more important, in quality. In recent years, some sporadicattempts have been made to acquaint the West with Dōgen, but these cover only atiny portion of the entire corpus of his religion and philosophy. It is my hopethat the study of Dōgen’s Zen will remedy the situation and will lead to a morecomplete understanding of Zen.On the other hand, I am of the opinion that it is high time for Western studentsto deal with Zen as a historical religion in its concrete historical,philosophical, moral, and cultural context—not to isolate it from that context.After all, Zen is a cultural and historical product. I feel strongly that suchan approach to Zen is imperative to the maturity of Western Zen (or any Zen forthat matter), and my work endeavors to apply it seriously to the study of Dōgen.It might surprise many readers that such a historical consciousness is actuallyin accord with Dōgen’s belief that maintaining a fidelity to history was the wayto transcend it.The present work draws heavily upon, and is greatly indebted to, Japanesescholarship in Dōgen studies, which has diversified so much in recent years thatmaterials and findings are indeed bewildering to the beginning Dōgen student.With this book, I endeavor to add to this scholarship by systematicallyelucidating Dōgen’s life and thought, while paying acute attention to thoseissues that are relevant and vital to current thinking in religion andphilosophy. In this respect, Dōgen’s thought sheds light on some vitallyimportant issues in a surprisingly modern way. I am not implying here that Dōgenfully or completely anticipated what we now know. Yet, despite his remotenessfrom us in terms of time and culture, his messages are infinitely richer andmore complex than we might at first think.It has been my persistent conviction that we can avoid making either a strictphilosopher or a pious religionist of Dōgen; rather, we can understand himtotally in a humanistic context. Be that as it may, it is my sincere hope thatthe present work will stimulate students to delve further into Dōgen.Throughout this study, I used Dōgen zenji zenshū (edited by Ōkubo Dōshū) as thebasis of my research and translation. In view of the current Westernacquaintance with Dōgen, I have attempted to render as many translations of hiswritings as possible. Most of these appear here for the first time in English.In an introductory work such as this, translations are by necessity highlyselective and fragmentary, and one cannot avoid but lay primary, if not sole,emphasis upon the Shōbōgenzō.The Japanese reading of Buddhist terms is extremely confusing, even amongBuddhist scholars. In order to avoid unnecessary chaos, I adopted the customarySōtō way of reading them, rather than the one suggested in Ōkubo’saforementioned Zenshū. Thus for example, I used uji instead of yūji, datsurakuinstead of totsuraku, konshin instead of unjin, gato instead of wazu, and soforth. I consulted frequently with Shōbōgenzō yōgo sakuin (edited by Katō Shūkō)and Zengaku jiten (edited by Jimbo Nyoten and Andō Bun’ei) for the reading ofimportant terms used in this work.I wish to extend my gratitude to John A. Hutchison for his unfailing assistanceand encouragement; to Floyd H. Ross, Herbert W. Schneider, Margaret Dornish, andKatō Kazumitsu for their invaluable comments and suggestions; to Yamada Reirin,the former abbot of the Los Angeles Zenshūji temple, who initially guided me toDōgen’s Shōbōgenzō; and to Nakamura Hajime, Masunaga Reihō, and Abe Masao inJapan for their kind assistance through correspondence.The Blaisdell Institute, Claremont Graduate School, and the School of Theologywere generous enough to invite me to Claremont to teach and do research on Dōgenfrom 1970 to 1972. I am deeply grateful to these three institutions forproviding necessary funds. I should also mention the moral support I receivedfrom the members of the Department of Religious Studies and the Asian StudiesCommittee at the University of Oregon, when this work was in its final stage ofpreparation. My gratitude extends to them.I wish to express my thanks to Dale Pryor for her editing work; to DorothyBanker Turner and Anne Holmes for their assistance in various ways at differentstages of this project; and to Mary Armes for typing the final copy for photoreproduction. I also thank the Association for Asian Studies at the Universityof Arizona and the University of Arizona Press for their cooperation and skillin the publication of this book.Hee-Jin Kim1975"},{"pageContent":"EIHEI DŌGENMYSTICAL REALIST"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/ch1.jpg]toc.html#ch1DURING THE PAST several decades, the significance of Dōgen’s thought—not onlyfor the history of Buddhist thought but also for the history of ideas atlarge—has been increasingly recognized, albet belatedly, by a growing number ofstudents both inside and outside the Sōtō sectarian circle in Japan. MasunagaReihō, a leading Dōgen scholar in the Sōtō sect, for example, characterizesDōgen as “the unique religious personality” with “incomparable depth ofthought.”1 [notes.html#ch1_1] Among those singing his praises outside the sectis Tanabe Hajime, one of the most prominent Japanese philosophers, who exaltsDōgen almost ecstatically, calling him “a great metaphysical thinker” andappraising his thought in the Shōbōgenzō (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye),Dōgen’s magnum opus, as “the culmination of dialectical thinking” and “theprecursor of Japanese philosophy.” “Indeed,” says Tanabe, “his thought seems tohave already had an insight into, and to have made a declaration of, thedirection to which the systematic thought of today’s philosophy should move.”2[notes.html#ch1_2] Even a foreign student of Zen Buddhism concurs with theseclaims in observing that Dōgen “belongs among the great creative figures ofhumankind.”3 [notes.html#ch1_3] It is not difficult for us to glean such praisesand eulogies from various sources—they are perhaps more frequent than criticismsof Dōgen. A sudden rise in Dōgen studies in scholarly circles and anunprecedented enthusiasm among intellectuals for the past several decades seemto indicate that, after the initial shock of the discovery of a virtuallyunknown thinker, the “popularity” of Dōgen has been steadily growing in thepost–World War II period.Credit for causing the “initial shock” in Dōgen studies should go to WatsujiTetsurō, a leading cultural historian, who brought Dōgen to light from hiscloistered confinement in the Sōtō sect. In his now famous essay, “Shamon Dōgen”(“Dōgen, a Monk”) written in 1926, Watsuji declared:I am not here insisting that my own interpretation is the only one on the truthof Dōgen itself, in the understanding of which I am least confident. I cansafely say, however, that a new path of interpretation has been opened up here,to say the least. Henceforth Dōgen is no longer “Dōgen, the founder of thesect,” but, our Dōgen. The reason I dare make such an arrogant statement is thatI know Dōgen has been killed thus far in the Sōtō sect.4 [notes.html#ch1_4]Deceptively meager as it may have been in its size, Watsuji’s essay was abombshell, openly revolting against sectarian injustice to Dōgen and challengingmany younger minds to engage in Dōgen studies without being fettered bysectarian concerns. This revolt, in the spirit of making Dōgen “our Dōgen,” wascheered and welcomed even by some insiders of the Sōtō sect, although there wasalso much sectarian resistance and indifference. This was the beginning of Dōgenstudies in the genuinely modern sense.For some seven hundred years prior to 1926, Dōgen studies were pursued bysectarian scholars who approached his work with apologetic concerns andconfessional hermeneutics. These scholars lacked any kind of modernmethodologies and philosophical reflections, and as a result, Dōgen wasvenerated pietistically, but never studied critically. For the sake ofconvenience, we can divide the history of Dōgen studies into the followingperiods: (1) the period of institutional expansion (1253–1660), (2) the periodof sectarian studies (1660–1868), (3) the period of continued stagnation(1868–1926), (4) the period of awakening (1926–1945), and (5) the period ofsteady maturity (1945–present). Let us briefly examine these stages.5[notes.html#ch1_5]The first period, which began immediately after Dōgen’s death and lasted untilapproximately 1660, is characterized by the institutional expansion of the Sōtōsect. It started modestly in the Hokuriku regions and gradually extendedthroughout the country due to the shrewd accommodation policies of Keizan Jōkin(1268–1325) and his two most able disciples, Gasan Jōseki (1275–1365) and MeihōSotetsu (1277–1350). These men adopted certain aspects of esoteric Buddhism andfolk tradition, such as a syncretistic mountain religion called shugendō,endeavoring in this way to come into close contact with the people. Theseaccommodative and popularizing policies were certainly not in accord withDōgen’s style of Zen, which focused on the training of monastics in a “puristic”and “puritanic” spirit as we shall see later. On the other hand, after the deathof Dōgen, Sōtō Zen shunned the aristocratic and bureaucratic Gozan Zen in Kyotoand Kamakura and thrived primarily among farmers, the common people, andpowerful clans in the regions and provinces remote from the centers of the GozanZen establishment. During this period, three different editions of Dōgen’sShōbōgenzō appeared: Ejō’s seventy-five-chapter edition, Giun’s sixty-chapteredition (1329), and Bonsei’s eighty-four-chapter edition (1419). Kenzei wrotehis famous Kenzeiki (The Record of Kenzei), a biography of Dōgen that influencedall other biographies in subsequent years. Kikigaki (The Record of Dōgen’sExpositions) by Senne, and Shō (Selected Commentaries; 1303–1308) by Kyōgō, bothof which were commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō, were of great importance sincethey were based on the two disciples’ direct acquaintance with Dōgen. Generallyspeaking, however, sectarian scholars in this period relegated the Shōbōgenzō tooblivion in favor of studying Chinese Zen Buddhism (such as the doctrine of FiveRanks). It was undoubtedly a dark age in sectarian studies.6 [notes.html#ch1_6]The second period, which began sometime in the middle of the seventeenthcentury, witnessed the emergence (or resurgence) of the so-called sectarianstudies (shūgaku) and the rise of the “sectarian restoration movement” (shūtōfukko undō). This development was led by such leaders as Gesshū Sōko(1618–1696), Manzan Dōhaku (1636–1715), Tenkei Denson (1648–1735), and MenzanZuihō (1683–1769), who attempted to rescue the sect from confusion andcorruption and restore the rigor and purity of Dōgen Zen. During this time,Dōgen’s works were printed, the monastic rules of Dōgen and Keizan published,and a fresh enthusiasm for scholarly studies encouraged. For the first time, theShōbōgenzō was rigorously studied by sectarian scholars, although Dōgen’s minorworks had previously been studied. Several commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō werewritten: Tenkei’s Benchū (A Commentary with Critical Notes) in 1730, Menzan’sMonge (Menzan’s Lectures) in the 1760s and Shōtenroku (A Study on the Sources ofTerms, Names and Events in the Shōbōgenzō) in 1759, Honkō’s Sanchū (ACommentary) in 1793, Zōkai’s Shiki (Personal Comments) in circa 1779, and so on.Kōzen edited the ninety-five-chapter edition (Kōzen-bon) of the Shōbōgenzō in1690. Nevertheless, sectarian studies in Sōtō Zen, like other sectarian studiesof Buddhist sects at that time, were severely limited by the governmentalcontrol and supervision of the Tokugawa regime, which was interested in nothingbut the utilization and exploitation of religion to maintain the status quo ofthe feudalistic order. No freedom of thought existed—rather, sectarianorthodoxies were articulated, stereotyped, and unchallenged.7 [notes.html#ch1_7]The third period was marked by the advent of the Meiji Restoration (1868),during which Japan broke away from feudalism and became infatuated—at leasttemporarily—with anything Western.8 [notes.html#ch1_8] As Kagamishima Hiroyukiobserves, Sōtō sectarian scholarship at that time was largely moved by “theinertia of the Tokugawa period.”9 [notes.html#ch1_9] Dōgen (unlike Shinran andNichiren) was relatively unknown to the general Japanese populace.10[notes.html#ch1_10] The only works of great importance produced during thisperiod were Keiteki (A Guide on the Right Path), an authoritative commentary onthe Shōbōgenzō by Nishiari Bokusan (1821–1910),11 [notes.html#ch1_11] and theSōtō kyōkai shushōgi (The Principles of Practice and Enlightenment of the SōtōOrder; 1890), an anthology of selected passages from the Shōbōgenzō for thebelievers of Sōtō Zen.12 [notes.html#ch1_12]The fourth period began in the 1920s with Watsuji’s aforementioned essay. As Ihave noted, this essay freed Dōgen from the monopoly of sectarian studies,awakened scholars from their dogmatic slumber, and incited enthusiasm andpassion for Dōgen as a spiritual mentor of humankind. In 1935, nine years afterthe publication of Watsuji’s essay, Akiyama Hanji published Dōgen no kenkyū (AStudy on Dōgen) in which he systematically addressed Dōgen’s thought withspecial emphasis on ontology as it related to Western philosophical traditions.(His essay remains the most comprehensive study of Dōgen’s thought to thisday.)13 [notes.html#ch1_13] A few years later in 1939, Tanabe Hajime, as citedbefore, wrote a short book entitled Shōbōgenzō no tetsugaku-shikan (ThePhilosophy of the Shōbōgenzō: A Personal View) in which he described hisawakening to the intellectual capacity of the Japanese through Dōgen’sphilosophical tenacity and exactitude.14 [notes.html#ch1_14] Watsuji, Akiyama,and Tanabe were primarily interested in Dōgen as a thinker, and therefore hisphilosophical contributions. However, Hashida Kunihiko, who was a physiologistat Tokyo University, approached Dōgen as the advocate of religious practice,rather than as philosopher, in his Shōbōgenzō shakui (A Commentary on theShōbōgenzō), the first volume of which appeared in 1939.15 [notes.html#ch1_15]His impact was to liberate Dōgen further from his sectarian restraints.As a result of this awakening, two distinctive camps of sectarian andnonsectarian studies formed. The impact of the latter upon the former wasevident, though there were many rebuttals and countercriticisms. Tension betweenthe two factions persists to this day, although by and large, the creativeinteraction between the two camps until the end of World War II has benefitedDōgen studies overall. The major controversies can be summarized as follows:16[notes.html#ch1_16] (1) Nonsectarian students saw Dōgen as an independentthinker in the history of thought and the Shōbōgenzō as his spiritual andintellectual testimony, rather than as sectarian writings. Sectarian students,on the other hand, vigorously defended a special form of religious tradition(nurtured in the sect as an invaluable heritage), saw Dōgen as the founder ofthe Sōtō sect (shūso), and construed the Shōbōgenzō as the sect’s authoritativereligious text rather than as philosophical treatise. (2) Nonsectarian studentsstudied Dōgen primarily from the standpoint of the Shōbōgenzō; their sectarianfriends rejected this position, feeling that the Shōbōgenzō was by no meansDōgen’s only important work. Related to this difference was the fact thatnonsectarians tended to emphasize philosophical ideas, whereas sectariansemphasized religious faith and monastic/lay life. And finally, (3) nonsectarianstudents were primarily concerned with the contemporary significance of Dōgen inrelation to the changing world situation, although they often read their ownphilosophical views into Dōgen, largely as a result of neglecting thehistorico-social context in which his thought had evolved. By contrast,sectarians insisted on the importance of their community, religion, and history.It was also during the fourth period that a number of critical editions ofDōgen’s writings were produced; among others, Ōkubo Dōshū’s Teihon Dōgen zenjizenshū (A Definitive Collection of Dōgen’s Complete Works; 1944) and Etō Sokuō’sShōbōgenzō in three volumes (1939–43) were important. The latter, published in apopular edition, especially appealed to a wide audience. In addition, one of themost authoritative works of the sectarians, in response to the nonsectarianinterpretation of Dōgen, was Etō Sokuō’s Shūso to shiteno Dōgen zenji (DōgenZenji As the Founder of the Sōtō Sect), published in 1944. As the titlesuggests, Dōgen was interpreted as the founder of the sect whose Zen emphasizedenlightenment and faith (quite a new emphasis in the Zen tradition).17[notes.html#ch1_17]The post-war fifth period (which continues to the present day) has marked a newmaturity in Dōgen studies. Previous distinctions between the two camps stillpersist but have become less significant as their differences are increasinglyseen as matters of emphasis, rather than principle, in their shared search forunderstanding. More important, both sectarian and nonsectarian students of Dōgenhave been confronted with an entirely new world situation in which traditionalvalues and methodologies have been radically challenged. Dōgen studies have nowreached a new phase in which both parties are compelled to cooperate andtransform one another, in order to contribute to the common task of furtheringself-understanding in an emerging world community. Thus, recent studiesdemonstrate intensified efforts to place Dōgen in the historical, social, andcultural contexts in which his thought was formed, rather than to study histhought in the abstract—although philosophical treatments of Dōgen stillcontinue. Ienaga Saburō’s “Dōgen no shūkyō no rekishiteki seikaku” (“AHistorical Character of Dōgen’s Religion”) in his Chūsei Bukkyō shisōshi kenkyū(Studies in the History of Medieval Japanese Buddhist Thought; 1955), TakeuchiMichio’s Dōgen (1962), Takahashi Masanobu’s Dōgen no jissentetsugaku kōzō (TheStructure of Dōgen’s Practical Philosophy; 1967), Etō Sokuō’s Shōbōgenzōjosetsu: Bendōwa gikai (Prolegomena to the Shōbōgenzō: An Exposition of Bendōwa;1959), Ōkubo Dōshū’s monumental collection of Dōgen’s entire works, Dōgen zenjizenshū (The Complete Works of Dōgen Zenji; 1969–70), which reflects the findingsand results of recent Dōgen studies, and a legion of other important works andarticles have been written in this period.18 [notes.html#ch1_18] In addition tothe study of the Shōbōgenzō that characterized the pre-war period, Dōgen’s otherwritings have been investigated and probed for linguistic, textual, and literarydata.19 [notes.html#ch1_19] Furthermore, there have appeared several differenttranslations of Dōgen’s works in colloquial Japanese that have disseminatedDōgen’s thought rapidly among the Japanese populace. In short, Dōgen studieshave diversified, broadened, and improved considerably in their scope,precision, and methodology in the post-war period. The quantity and quality ofscholarly output in this area is highly promising.Once we turn our eyes from Japan to the Western scene, we find that virtuallynothing has been introduced concerning Dōgen20 [notes.html#ch1_20]—this isunfortunate indeed, given that ignorance of Sōtō Zen is tantamount to ignoranceof Dōgen, its founder. Masunaga is justified in saying: “Western knowledge ofZen seldom extends to the Sōtō style—the style of the larger Zen sect inJapan.”21 [notes.html#ch1_21] The scholarship of Zen Buddhism in the West haschiefly relied upon D. T. Suzuki’s brilliant introduction and interpretation ofmany invaluable texts, based primarily on Rinzai Zen in which Suzuki wasnurtured. Overshadowed by Suzuki’s brilliance and reputation, the Sōtō traditionhas been treated like a stepchild of Zen in the West. Perhaps this situation hasbeen aggravated by the extreme difficulty of presenting Dōgen’s thought in aform intelligible to the Western mind. His language and thought are forbiddinglydifficult and subtle, yet irresistibly intriguing, and more often than not,exasperating for students of Dōgen who alternate between hope and despair intheir efforts to understand. Nevertheless East-West cooperative efforts totranslate and disseminate Dōgen’s works are continuing.22 [notes.html#ch1_22]Having established the historical background of Dōgen studies, albeit in thebarest of outlines, I would like to articulate my basic assumptions on thepresent investigation before continuing further.First, Zen Buddhism is not a monolithic religion with a mystical slant, as itmight appear superficially from the reading of Suzuki’s works. Although it hasan unmistakable “family resemblance” to other East Asian religions, it alsocontains elements and traits diverse and rich enough to surprise even thoseinitiated into Zen. Furthermore, Zen is still in the making. The belief that Zenembodies a mystical extremism characterized by irrationality, eccentricity, andobscurantism is a flagrant error.23 [notes.html#ch1_23] Many of these allegedZen qualities are exaggerations or misinterpretations that have helped create adistorted image of Zen. Dōgen, as we shall see later, conceived of Zen quitedifferently—his style of Zen was “rational,” “analytic,” and “exact,” thoughthese adjectives should not be understood in the sense of the Westernphilosophical tradition. A total understanding of Zen is urgently needed todayand Dōgen studies are an integral part of such a task—this means that Zen mustbe studied in the total context of Buddhism, as well as in the context of thegeneral history of religions.24 [notes.html#ch1_24]Second, Dōgen was a religious thinker, not merely or even primarily aphilosopher. As I mentioned previously, nonsectarian students of Dōgen are oftenmistaken in viewing him as a philosopher who attempted to build a philosophicalsystem. On the contrary, even Dōgen’s most philosophic moments were permeated byhis practical, religious concern, against the background of which hisphilosophic activities stand out most clearly in their truest significance. WhatDōgen presents to us is not a well-defined, well-knit philosophical system, butrather a loose nexus of exquisite mythopoeic imaginings and profound philosophicvisions, in the flowing style of medieval Japanese, studded sparsely withclassical Chinese prose and verse. A rare combination of vision and analysis inDōgen’s thought has dazzled many a student, so much so that many have lost sightof its deeper matrix—that is, his religious and especially cultic concern, whichwas a passionate search for liberation through concrete activities andexpressions. Thus, philosophy for Dōgen was an integral part of religion andritual.Third, religion as examined from the phenomenological standpoint, is ournonrational activity in search of the ultimate meaning of existence. I do notwish to enter an elaborate discussion of recent investigations of religiousphenomena at this point, but merely to draw on the general agreement with whichhistorians of religions, social scientists, and religious thinkers concurregarding the nature and function of religion.25 [notes.html#ch1_25] Religion,then, is not something reducible to purely intellectual worldviews, utilitarianfunctions, and the like, nor is it something explainable in terms of the needsof immediate existence and survival. At its most serious and creative level, itis our attempt to free ourselves in favor of a symbolic reality, throughmythopoeic visions and cultic activities. Human nature is most fruitfullyunderstood in terms of animal symbolicum and homo ludens.26 [notes.html#ch1_26]Religion is intimately related to mythmaking and playful activities—thus, it isnonintellectual, nonutilitarian, and nonethical at its core. The modernproclivity to view religion strictly from scientific, theological, and ethicalstandpoints misses the deeper psychometaphysical forces operating in religiousaspirations. The moral, intellectual, and utilitarian values of religion canonly be adequately appreciated in this broader context. Let us keep thisfundamental insight in mind as we begin our investigation of Dōgen.Fourth, religious thought, like any other intellectual endeavor, employsconcepts and symbols bequeathed from particular religious and culturaltraditions created by our inner aspirations and the cultural and socioeconomicconditions of a given age. Religious thought cannot ignore the interaction ofmetaphysical visions and historical forces that are mutually limiting,conditioning, and transforming. Thus historico-cultural andphilosophico-phenomenological conditions cannot be divorced from one another inany adequate intellectual history. In our present study of Dōgen’s thought, weshould not only be concerned with the historical forces within which Dōgen’sthought evolved, but also with the structure of his experience and thought withits own subtle logic. While thought is not reducible to history, it cannot beisolated from it either—it is radically conditioned and relative to history atits core. Even the phenomenology of emptiness, however ahistorical one mayallege it to be, has a history. Thus, the history of any religious thought mustdo full justice to the fact that irreducible character and radicalconditionality are paradoxically paired in the structure of the object ofinvestigation. We must come to terms with such peculiarities of religiousthought and history, and once doing so will we be able to probe thephilosophical and experiential aspects of Dōgen’s thought.27 [notes.html#ch1_27]Fifth, Dōgen was obviously a child of the age (i.e., medieval Japan) and of theBuddhist tradition, and his intellectual horizon was limited to the catholicBuddhism that he envisioned. Traditionally-minded as he may have been, Dōgen hasattracted many contemporary philosophers and religious thinkers who regard himas surprisingly “modern,” as I illustrated in the case of Tanabe Hajime.Philosophically-minded students of Dōgen, however, often make the mistake ofseeing significance divorced from history, which results in mere subjectivityrather than an objective understanding of Dōgen’s thought. Thus, our assumptionin this study, though it may sound platitudinous, is that significance andhistory must continually be in creative tension.Lastly, and related to the preceding assumption, is the fact that my approachdoes not attempt to be exhaustive, but rather presents a perspective with whichto systematically illuminate the character of Dōgen’s thought. I am not hopingto present a system by which to study Dōgen—there is none. As a result, ourstudy will be highly selective and subjective, but at the same time will besupported by textual and historical evidence. I shall attempt to expound the twofundamental structural elements of Dōgen’s thought, namely meditation andwisdom, and to explore the nature of them and their functions in their totalcontexts. The meanings of these two terms will gradually become clear in thecourse of our study. Moreover, these terms are associated in Dōgen’s thoughtwith the ideas of activity (gyōji) and expression (dōtoku), both of which arecentral throughout my work.With these assumptions in mind, let us begin our study of Dōgen as a humanbeing—not as the founder of the sect or as the philosopher—but rather, as onewho struggled to seek a mode of existence and freedom for himself and others,amidst his personal yearnings, frustrations, fears, and hopes in chaoticKamakura Japan. By so doing, I hope to show a Dōgen who, although confined tohis particular religious and cultural tradition, nevertheless envisioned ideasand values germane to the evolution of humanity."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/ch2.jpg]toc.html#ch2RELIGION IS A SYMBOLIC MODEL with symbols, values, beliefs, and practices thatenable us, individually and collectively, to attain spiritual liberation and tograsp the meaning of existence. These elements of religion, in turn, areintricately interwoven with the conditions of our biological and psychologicalmakeup, as well as with socio-cultural and historical conditions. Thus, the netresult is a unique fabric of an individual’s symbolic reality.Dōgen inherited the symbolic model of Buddhism through his upbringing, studies,and training in Japan and China, and accordingly his thought moved within theframework of this model. Some basic values of Buddhism, especially of Zen, wereevident in his life and thought, yet were modified by his personal life as wellas by the social and cultural conditions of the early Kamakura period of Japanin which he lived. In what follows, I shall attempt to review and understandsome significant features of Dōgen’s life so as to pave the way to understandinghis thought.1 [notes.html#ch2_1]Dōgen’s life can be studied according to the following periods: early childhood(1200–1212); apprenticeship in Buddhism (1212–27), which may be subdivided intohis spiritual struggle at Hiei and Kenninji (1212–23) and his study in China(1223–27); and the creative period in Japan, which began after his return fromChina in 1227 and lasted until his death in 1253, and that can be divided intothe Yamashiro and Echizen periods. Before we embark on the account of Dōgen’sspiritual pilgrimage, we shall briefly observe the social background of the agein which Dōgen’s life and thought occurred.THE HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND OF EARLY KAMAKURA JAPAN [toc.html#ch2_h2_1]The first half of the thirteenth century, namely the early Kamakura period inwhich Dōgen lived and died, and its immediately preceding phase of the Heianperiod, had several important features relevant to our investigation of Dōgen’slife and thought. They can be explained in terms of the nobilitywarrior powerstruggle, the corrupted state of Buddhism, and the traditional folk movements ofthe masses.There were two opposing social forces in Japan in those days: the court nobilityin Kyoto and the military class in Kamakura. The court aristocracy (theimperial-Fujiwara complex) had already been advancing toward its breakdown bythe end of the Heian period. Far removed from the erstwhile “glory and splendor”(eiga) of Fujiwara no Michinaga, they desperately clung to whatever vestigeswere left of their declining power, which was formally ended by their demise inthe Jōkyū War of 1221. Their life was very similar to that of the Heianaristocracy described in Genji monogatari (The Tale of Genji). Their activitiescentered exclusively around political pursuits, amorous adventures, and poeticand artistic indulgences—contingent on the wealth derived from enormous holdingsof tax-free estates (shōen). Perhaps no society in human history emphasizedaesthetic refinement and sensibility more than the Japanese court nobility inthose days. As Ivan Morris aptly observes, “Upper-class Heian life waspunctuated with poetry from beginning to end, and no important event wascomplete without it.”2 [notes.html#ch2_2] With this aestheticism were associatedtwo fundamentally related sentiments of the age—the sense of the affectivequality of life and the world (mono no aware), and the sense of impermanence(mujō). Despite its outward pomposity, the aristocratic way of life waspermeated by an awareness of beauty shadowed by a sense of sorrow due tobeauty’s inherently ephemeral character. The court nobles grasped somethingreligious in the beautiful and vice versa. Beauty inspired in them a religiousfeeling, a sense of the ultimate limits of life, of impermanence and death.Religion, likewise, appealed to them for aesthetic, rather than ethical,reasons.3 [notes.html#ch2_3] The aristocratic lot in life was interpreted asresulting from karma or fate (sukuse or suguse) to which they resignedthemselves. They were indifferent to the masses, as if their ethicalsensibilities were incompatible with their aesthetic sensibilities.4[notes.html#ch2_4] Dōgen’s life and thought can be adequately understood onlyagainst this decadent, overly refined aristocratic tradition into which he wasborn.After a decisive victory over the Tairas at the battle of Dannoura in 1185, theMinamoto family established hegemony over Japan with the creation of its feudalgovernment (bakufu) in 1192. This set the stage for the rise of the samuraiclass and its gradually emerging way of life known as “the way of warriors”(bushidō). (In its early stage, “the way of warriors” centered strictly ongreedy, predatory, and calculating business dealings with little or no sense ofloyalty or sacrifice—it was a far cry from the romanticized way of life thatlater developed in the Tokugawa period.)5 [notes.html#ch2_5] Although warriorswere culturally “provincial” and looked down upon by aristocrats, theireconomic, military, and political powers steadily grew and consolidated—theywere gradually emerging as a class separate from the aristocrats, farmers,merchants, and artisans. The martial arts were their profession, and they wereacutely aware of the ultimate meaning of their profession—the destruction ofhuman lives.6 [notes.html#ch2_6]The Minamotos operated basically within the old political framework; theyenforced powers delegated to them by the imperial house but were the de factorulers of Japan without attempting to displace the imperial house. In thisrespect, they followed precedents that had been set by the Fujiwaras, who hadcreated an incredibly complex political situation in which both aristocratic andmilitary classes were helplessly enmeshed. A historian aptly described it asfollows:One finds in thirteenth-century Japan an emperor who was a mere puppet in thehands of a retired emperor and a great court family, the Fujiwaras, who togethercontrolled a government, completely dominated by the private government of theShōgun—who in turn was a puppet in the hands of the Hōjō regent. The man behindthe throne had become a series of men, each in turn controlled by the man behindhimself.7 [notes.html#ch2_7]In addition to this chaotic political situation were the infinitely complicatedtransactions involving tax-free estates—perhaps the most significant economicinstitution to mold Japanese life from the latter part of the eighth century tothe end of the sixteenth century.8 [notes.html#ch2_8] By the end of the Heianera, some 80 percent of rice-producing lands in the country belonged to themanorial system,9 [notes.html#ch2_9] which was fought over by court nobles andsamurai warriors.Conspicuous in this power struggle were also the religious orders. During theHeian period, religious institutions accumulated huge tax-free estates that hadto be protected by an oxymoronic Japanese institution, the armed monastics(sōhei). Since the middle of the tenth century, major Buddhist monasteries suchas the Enryakuji temple on Mt. Hiei, the Onjōji temple in Miidera, and theTōdaiji and Kōfukuji temples in Nara had standing armies to solve theirconflicts with other religious institutions and with the government. Theydestroyed rival monasteries, demonstrated in the streets of the capital,presented petitions to the imperial court by force (gōso), and engaged in manyother flagrant militant actions.10 [notes.html#ch2_10] Although the wealth,prestige, and power of some established monasteries undoubtedly increased, theirmoral, intellectual, and religious life was dangerously disintegrating. Armedmonastics were very active during Dōgen’s lifetime, and their entanglements inthis grim situation had many sordid psychological and social ramifications.Another characteristic of Buddhism in this period was its inseparableassociation with the Heian aristocracy. One of the most conspicuous examples ofthis was the monopolization of important posts in the monastic centers bymembers of the imperial house and the Fujiwara family. This resulted in theformation of clerical cliques (monzeki) that excluded non-Fujiiwara aspirants.As political careers at court became exceedingly elusive due to the growingnumbers of the Fujiwara clan, some saw the monastic profession as the nextsurest way to wealth and power, regardless of their religious motivation. Inaddition, the activities at many monastic centers revolved aroundmagico-religious rites and prayers (kaji-kitō) of esoteric Buddhism that weredesigned for the protection of the nation and the welfare of the courtaristocracy. The complete secularization (i.e., aristocratization) of Buddhism,with no distinction between Buddha-law (buppō) and secular law (ōbō), was firmlyestablished when Dōgen entered Mt. Hiei for study in his youth.11[notes.html#ch2_11]In this period, the Buddhist doctrine of the Three Ages (shō-zō-matsu nosanjisetsu) was widely accepted. The Three Ages were the Age of Right Law(shōbō) in which the genuinely authentic Dharma (universal truth andrighteousness) prevailed, the Age of Imitative Law (zōbō) in which mere forms ofDharma dominated, and the Age of Degenerate Law (mappō) in which Dharma wasentirely decayed. In the first age, teaching, practice, and attainment ofenlightenment prevailed; in the second, teaching and practice alone; and in thethird, there was only teaching. The Age of Degenerate Law, as interpreted bysome circles of Buddhism in Japan, was believed to have begun in 1052.12[notes.html#ch2_12] This calculation was accepted by both the aristocrats andthe general populace; the Buddhist leaders of the time based their diagnosis ofthe current religious situation upon this doctrine.13 [notes.html#ch2_13] Thisbelief was reinforced by incessant earthquakes, fires, murders, epidemics, andfamines in the late Heian and early Kamakura periods. Thus, a historicalconsciousness developed that was based on a sense of “apocalyptic crisis” and aconviction in the utter wretchedness and helplessness of humankind, along with aconcomitant spiritual exigency that led to faith in the unfailing compassion andgrace of Amida Buddha.14 [notes.html#ch2_14]Dōgen, while utilizing the scheme of the Three Ages, rejected such romanticpessimism toward human nature and history, for to him human nature possessed theelements of both greatness and wretchedness, regardless of time and place. Thushe remarked:The ancient sages were not necessarily of sturdy build, nor were all theforebears richly endowed. It had not been long since the death of ŚākyamuniBuddha, and when we consider Buddha’s lifetime, not all people were superior:there were both sheep and goats. Among monastics some were unimaginable villainsand others were of the lowest character.15 [notes.html#ch2_15]Whether human beings were great or wretched was determined not by externalconditions, but by our manner of dealing with one another.16 [notes.html#ch2_16]This doctrine was relevant to Dōgen to the extent that it diagnosed the massspiritual crisis of his time and aided individuals in confronting this crisis.Otherwise, it was nothing but a symptom of human failure to deal with life andthe world.17 [notes.html#ch2_17]As we turn our attention from the affairs of nobles, warriors, and religioniststo those of the masses, we see that the farmers, merchants, and artisans at thattime were in a downtrodden state, though they had gained social and economicpower. The corruption and indifference of the ruling classes, chaotic social andpolitical conditions, and omnipresent sufferings and miseries led thesedisinherited people toward something radically new that promised to revitalizetheir spiritual life. Their primitive yearnings had been, more often than not,associated with various folk-traditional undercurrents that were deeper thanBuddhist and Confucian religious ideologies.18 [notes.html#ch2_18] Inparticular, the so-called holy men (hijiri)—with shamanistic, magico-religiouspractices and beliefs—were active among the masses from the latter part of thetenth century on, disseminating “the essential importance of individual faithand unworldliness”19 [notes.html#ch2_19] that was at odds with institutionalBuddhism. As Hori emphasizes, the hijiri movement was essentiallyfolk-traditional, anti-authoritarian, and anti-secular; it paved the way for anew Kamakura Buddhism, particularly Pure Realm Buddhism. Lay monastics (shami)also increased in number and quietly engaged in a spiritual revitalization ofthe common people.20 [notes.html#ch2_20] In a very real sense, these holy menand lay monastics were the predecessors of Kamakura Buddhism, which could beregarded as the cultic and intellectual purification and crystallization of thepassionate personal faith that they advocated.Dōgen’s Zen Buddhism was no exception in that it also was a part of this generalmovement taking place in medieval Japan.21 [notes.html#ch2_21] In addition, thefolk tradition of Japan had many other features relevant to our subjectmatter—especially the tradition of dōzoku (a kind of kinship system) in thesocial structure of Japan, and the tradition of mountain asceticism andpurification that was deeply rooted in the Japanese folk mentality.22[notes.html#ch2_22] Perhaps no Kamakura Buddhist would appear more remote fromfolk tradition than Dōgen—antimagical, elitist, eremitic—and yet, his was areligion of the people that came into being and sustained itself by drawing itscreativity and vitality from a source deeper and more indigenous than theenfeebled ideologies and adventures of the aristocratic tradition.EARLY CHILDHOOD:INITIATION INTO IMPERMANENCE [toc.html#ch2_h2_2]Dōgen was born in Kyoto in the first month of 1200, perhaps as an illegitimateson of Koga Michichika and the daughter of Fujiwara Motofusa. He was amongeleven sons and three daughters of Michichika. The Koga (or Minamoto) family wasdescended from Prince Tomohira, son of Emperor Murakami (r. 946–57). During thelifetime of Michichika, then the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, the family wasat the height of its power and prosperity and controlled both the dominatingpower of the Fujiwara family and the pro-shōgun force within the courtly circlein Kyoto. In addition, Michichika stood unparalleled in the literary circle (theMurakami Genji’s literary fame was well known) and was unfailingly devoted tothe imperial family (the Murakami Genji had the tradition of fighting for therestoration of the imperial rule). His mother was a beautiful, yet ill-fatedwoman who, according to one account, was married to and separated from KisoYoshinaka and subsequently married to Koga Michichika.23 [notes.html#ch2_23]Michichika died suddenly in 1202, when Dōgen was only two years of age. Afterthe death of his father, Dōgen was raised by his mother and halfbrother,Michitomo, in a culturally over-refined atmosphere. Many of his brothers andsisters occupied eminent positions in the imperial court and were well versed inpoetry and the classics. It is not difficult to imagine that Dōgen must havebeen systematically educated in the Chinese and Japanese classics, and welltrained in literary skills and techniques that were the sine qua non ofaristocratic life. Dōgen recalled later: “In my boyhood I studied history andliterature enthusiastically.”24 [notes.html#ch2_24] He also wrote:As a result of my predilection for study from childhood, I am prone even now toexamine the rhetorical expressions of non-Buddhist classics and to consult theWên-hsüan [an anthology of classical proses and verses]. But I believe that sucha thing is irrelevant and should be discarded once and for all.25[notes.html#ch2_25]Dōgen urged his disciples to pay attention not so much to the rhetoric, howevernotable it might be, as to the content of the writing under study. However, hissensitivity to language was cultivated in a refined literary environment, asevidenced by his poetic excellence, his fondness of the use of a flowingmedieval Japanese style rather than a Chinese style, his instruction on “lovingspeech” (aigo), and his deep insight into the nature of language and symbols inhuman thought. Dōgen eschewed vainglorious aestheticism, but never relinquishedhis poetic sensibility.At the age of seven, in 1207, Dōgen lost his mother, who at her death earnestlyrequested him to become a monastic to seek the truth of Buddhism and strive torelieve the tragic sufferings of humanity.26 [notes.html#ch2_26] Unlike hisfather’s death, which took place when he was only two, his mother’s death musthave been a serious blow to Dōgen’s fragile and sensitive mind. We are told thatin the midst of profound grief, Dōgen experienced the impermanence of all thingsas he watched the ascending incense at his mother’s funeral service.27[notes.html#ch2_27]This experience left an indelible impression upon Dōgen, which no doubtdetermined the direction of his subsequent spiritual journey. Later, Dōgen wouldemphasize, time and again, the intimate relationship between the desire forenlightenment (bodaishin) and the awareness of impermanence (mujō) and death.28[notes.html#ch2_28] To Dōgen, the lucid understanding of life and the thoroughpenetration of death (ryōshō-tasshi), that is a total understanding of themeaning (dōri) of impermanence and death, were the alpha and omega of religion.Dōgen understood the impermanent character of life in religious and metaphysicalterms rather than in psychological or aesthetic ones, and he lived out thisunderstanding in his monastic life. Dōgen’s way of life was not a sentimentalflight from, but a compassionate understanding of, the intolerable reality ofexistence.Five years after his mother’s death, Dōgen was confronted by another crisis.After he was orphaned, Dōgen was adopted by Fujiwara Moroie, his mother’syounger brother, who at over forty years of age did not yet have an heir andconsequently wanted to train Dōgen for this honor.29 [notes.html#ch2_29] Thismeant the promise of a brilliant career for Dōgen in the tradition of theFujiwara hegemony, even though the Fujiwara hegemony was in decline during thistime. In the spring of 1212, Moroie planned to have a gempuku ceremony for Dōgento mark his initiation into aristocratic manhood. At this juncture, Dōgen wasforced to choose either to become a monastic or follow his uncle’s desire. Dōgendecided to become a monastic, and visited Ryōkan,30 [notes.html#ch2_30] anotheruncle on his mother’s side, in the Onjōji temple at the foot of Mt. Hiei, for anintelligent discussion of the matter. Deeply moved by Dōgen’s determination andmotivation, Ryōkan recommended that he study at the Senkōbō at Yokawa-Hannyadanion Mt. Hiei, one of the most renowned centers of Buddhist studies at that time.Upon hearing the news of Dōgen’s decision to become a monastic, Moroie wasgreatly disappointed.To Dōgen there was no conflict between his decision and his filial piety toMoroie. As he saw it, to study Buddhism was to fulfill his duty to Moroie. Hewrote that filial piety should not be limited to one’s parents alone butextended to all sentient beings, and further said: “To follow the Way obedientlyin our living from day to day and in our study from moment to moment—that is thetruest filial piety.”31 [notes.html#ch2_31] In a more revealing statementindicative of his unique style of Zen, Dōgen wrote:Even the Buddhas and ancestors are not without tender feelings and affections(on’ai) but they have thrown them away. The Buddhas and ancestors, too, are notlacking various bonds, yet they have renounced them. Even though you hold themdear, the direct and indirect conditions of self and other are not to be clungto; therefore, if you do not forsake the bonds of affection, they in turn shalldesert you. If you must care for tender feelings, treat them with compassion; totreat them with compassion means to resolutely relinquish them.32[notes.html#ch2_32]Thus: “The students of Buddhism should not study Dharma for their own profit butonly for the sake of Dharma.”33 [notes.html#ch2_33] The Way, for the sake of theWay, heartless as it may have sounded, was the core of Dōgen’s spiritual searchfrom beginning to end.APPRENTICESHIP IN BUDDHISM [toc.html#ch2_h2_3]In the fourth month of 1213, Dōgen’s ordination ceremony was administered byKōen, abbot of the Enryakuji temple on Mt. Hiei.34 [notes.html#ch2_34]Thereafter Dōgen delved deeply into a systematic study of Buddhist sūtras at theSenkōbō. A more favorable educational environment could not have been found inthose days than at Hiei. Dōgen devoured these studies with his gifted mind. Hisearnest search for truth at that time and thereafter can be seen in the emphasishe placed on the need to live seriously. Some twenty years later, Dōgenrepeatedly maintained in his Shōbōgenzō zuimonki: “The arising and decaying ofall things occur swiftly; birth-and-death is gravely important” (mujō-jinsokushōji-jidai). The impermanence of existence did not lead him to fatalism or tothe pessimism that pervaded the age; on the contrary it led him to heightenedvitality in the search for the Way. Dōgen admonished: “Having a transient life,you should not engage in anything other than the Way.”35 [notes.html#ch2_35] Hefurther wrote:In a Chinese classic it is said: “I shall be content even to die in the eveningif only I hear the Way in the morning.” Even if you were to die by starvation orby cold, you ought to follow the Way even a day or even an hour. How many timesmight we be born again and die again in an infinitude of aeons and rebirths?Such a hope is nothing but a blind attachment to worldly conditions. Die ofstarvation in following the Way once and for all in this very life, and youshall attain eternal peace and tranquility.…If you do not seek enlightenmenthere and now on the pretext of the Age of Degenerate Law or wretchedness, inwhat birth are you to attain it?36 [notes.html#ch2_36]And: “At each moment do not rely upon tomorrow. Think of this day and this houronly, and of being faithful to the Way while given a life even just for today,for the next moment is uncertain and unknown.”37 [notes.html#ch2_37] ElsewhereDōgen stated:The student of Buddhism should think of the inevitability of dying. While thetruth is too obvious to be thought in those words, you should not waste yourprecious time by doing useless things, but instead do worthwhile things. Of manyworthwhile things, just one—indeed all else is futile—is vitally important: theway of life of the Buddhas and ancestors (busso no anri).38 [notes.html#ch2_38]“Today’s life does not guarantee tomorrow’s. The possibility and danger of dyingare always at hand.”39 [notes.html#ch2_39] These statements, though written muchlater in his life, unmistakably reflected the seriousness of the religiousenterprise Dōgen undertook at the Senkōbō after his initiation into Buddhism.While he was studying the sūtras at the Senkōbō, Dōgen was confronted with anapparently insoluble question that, according to the biographies of Dōgen,40[notes.html#ch2_40] was as follows:As I study both the exoteric and the esoteric schools of Buddhism, they maintainthat human beings are endowed with Dharma-nature by birth. If this is the case,why did the Buddhas of all ages—undoubtedly in possession of enlightenment—findit necessary to seek enlightenment and engage in spiritual practice?No one on Mt. Hiei could give a satisfactory answer to this spiritual problem.The question itself, however, was of such magnitude in Dōgen’s religiousstruggle that he was thereafter restless until he finally found an answer in1225 from Ju-ching at the T’ien-t’ung monastery.Dōgen’s question was concerned with the time-honored Mahāyāna doctrines oforiginal enlightenment (hongaku) and acquired enlightenment (shikaku). Thedoctrine of original enlightenment was propounded primarily by Tendai Buddhism,which was responsible for the synthesis of diverse currents of Buddhist thought,such as Tendai, Kegon, Shingon, and Zen. Although the doctrine itself was as oldas the early history of Mahāyāna Buddhism,41 [notes.html#ch2_41] its mostradical interpretation was formulated in Japan during the Heian and Kamakuraperiods, for the most part by Tendai thinkers, who pressed the doctrine to itslogical extremity.42 [notes.html#ch2_42] Several aspects of the doctrine were asfollows: Original enlightenment was eternal in that it was not a temporaloccurrence that had a beginning and an end in time. Opposites, such asenlightenment and delusion, life and death, being and nonbeing, one and many,were dialectically negated and in turn affirmed, without minimizing theirrespective absolute status. Related to this was the unity of enlightenment andpractice, in which emphasis was placed not so much on special forms of religiousdiscipline as it was on activities of daily life. The metaphysical status ofphenomenon (ji) was now construed as primary, in contrast to that of principle(ri); accordingly, the existential actualities of a given situation acquiredsupreme importance. Things, events, and values as they existed in actuality wereeternalized not as the manifestations of principle, but precisely by virtue ofthe intrinsic status of the phenomena themselves. Doctrinal studies were held indisrepute, and instead, an instantaneous liberation here and now through faithin original enlightenment was assured.43 [notes.html#ch2_43]In addition, the doctrine of original enlightenment was accompanied by a cognatedoctrine of “this body itself is Buddha” (sokushin-jōbutsu), which was likewiseradicalized by Japanese Buddhism. This tenet accepted the immediateenlightenment of the psycho-physical existence with all its particularities,which were not, as Zen Buddhists would say, “a finger pointing to the moon,” butthe moon itself, or to put it differently, not the accommodative manifestationsof the Body of Law (dharmakāya; hosshin), but the Body of Law itself. Thisdoctrine of esoteric Buddhism, both the Shingon and Tendai versions, influencedthe ethos of the time. Mundane existence was sanctified, as it was by thedoctrine of original enlightenment.44 [notes.html#ch2_44]The doctrines of original enlightenment and of “this-body-itself-is-Buddha” wenthand-in-hand in reinforcing the efficacy of faith, the absolutization ofphenomena, and the instantaneous attainment of liberation. When one denied anymetaphysical hiatus between principle and phenomenon, however, even theprofoundest Mahāyāna doctrines became dangerously indistinguishable from a crudeand irresponsible acceptance of whatever existed in the world, at the sacrificeof spiritual exertions. In fact, a number of dangerous misinterpretations ofthese doctrines were rampant toward the close of the Heian period, and wereespecially flagrant among worldly minded Buddhist monastics who attempted torationalize the pursuit of their selfish interests. Furthermore, an exclusiveclaim of faith, which required no strenuous religious or moral exertion, becamereadily associated with the antinomian cynicism inspired by the Age ofDegenerate Law.It is worth noting that this moral, intellectual, and religious crisis coincidedwith the popularity of the doctrines of original enlightenment and“this-body-itself-is-Buddha.” The latter unwittingly served to rationalize theapathetic state of affairs. The significance of Dōgen’s original question at Mt.Hiei and his endeavors thereafter can only be properly understood in light ofhis acute sense of this crisis of the age in which he lived.If we are primordially enlightened and consequently liberated here and nowwithin this body-mind existence, then why do we have to exert ourselves at all?What is the significance of intellectual, moral, cultic, and religiousactivities and endeavors? Dōgen did not question the truth of originalenlightenment, but believed it with his whole heart and mind. However, he didquestion the significance of the activities that constituted human existence,which amounted to asking, “What is the meaning of existence?”With his question unanswered, Dōgen finally left Hiei when Kōen resigned asabbot.45 [notes.html#ch2_45] He brought the question to Kōin (1145–1216) at theOnjōji temple in Miidera in the province of Ōmi. However, Kōin was unable toanswer his question; instead, the latter referred the young man to Eisai(1141–1215), who had returned from China to found Rinzai Zen and who resided atthe Kenninji temple in Kyoto.46 [notes.html#ch2_46] Dōgen later wrote:As a result of the desire for enlightenment which was first aroused in my mindthrough the awareness of the impermanence of existence, I traveled extensivelyto various places and, finally having descended Mt. Hiei to practice the Way,settled at the Kenninji temple. Until then I had met neither a right teacher nora good friend and consequently had gone astray and had erroneous thoughts.47[notes.html#ch2_47]Dōgen apparently visited Eisai at the Kenninji temple in 1214.48[notes.html#ch2_48] Founded by Eisai in 1202, the Kenninji temple was at thetime not only the center of Zen, but was also the center of studies for Tendai,Shingon, and other schools of Buddhism. Indeed, Kenninji was a rival of Hiei andvisiting Eisai under such circumstances was a bold venture for a young man ofonly fourteen. At any rate, “Dōgen entered Eisai’s school and heard Rinzai ZenBuddhism for the first time.”49 [notes.html#ch2_49] Despite the fact that therewas an extremely short length of time between Dōgen’s visit in 1214 and Eisai’sdeath in 1215, and that Dōgen probably could not have had frequent and intimatepersonal contact with Eisai, given the latter’s constant travel between Kyotoand Kamakura to propagate Zen, Eisai’s lasting influence on Dōgen cannot bedenied.50 [notes.html#ch2_50] However, the Kenninji visit was only one stopamong many in Dōgen’s extensive traveling.51 [notes.html#ch2_51] His willingnessto learn from a variety of sources was indicative of his moral courage andintellectual openness, and revealed his “intersectarian” approach to Buddhism,which would later revitalize the religion in his time.After three years’ wandering, Dōgen again settled at the Kenninji temple in 1217to receive the instructions of Myōzen (1184–1225) and stayed there until 1223,when he left to study in China. During this period, Dōgen studied Rinzai Zensystematically; at the same time a warm relationship between Myōzen and Dōgendeveloped as they studied together as teacher and disciple. It may be fair tosay that Dōgen’s knowledge about Zen Buddhism was acquired from Myōzen, who wasthe highest-ranking disciple of Eisai and his successor. Some ten years later,Dōgen wrote about Myōzen with respect and affection: “Myōzen Zenji, the chiefdisciple of the founder Eisai—he alone transmitted the supreme Dharma rightly.None of the others could equal him in this respect.”52 [notes.html#ch2_52]Undoubtedly, Dōgen’s six years of study under Myōzen, during which he wasconstantly encouraged and assisted by his teacher, must have been as momentousas the study he had had at Hiei.Yet still, Dōgen could not erase a feeling of dissatisfaction. He reminiscedlater:Although my teachers were just as distinguished as any others in the world ofBuddhist scholarship, they taught me to become famous in the nation and to bringhonor to the whole country. Thus in my study of Buddhism, I thought, above all,to become equal to ancient wise ones of this country and to those who held thetitle of Great Teacher (daishi). As I read in this connection [Hui-chao’s]Kao-sêng ch’uan (Biographies of Eminent Buddhist Monastics) and [Tao-hsüan’s]Hsü kao-sêng ch’uan (Further Biographies of Eminent Buddhist Monastics) andothers, and studied eminent Buddhist monastics and scholars of the great T’angdynasty, I came to realize that they differed from what my teachers taught. Whatis more, I realized that thoughts such as mine, according to their treatises andbiographies, were loathed by these people. Having contemplated the nature of thematter at last, I thought to myself I should have rather felt humbled by ancientsages and future good men and women instead of elated by the praise ofdespicable contemporaries. As for an aspiration for greatness, I wished toemulate the greatness of Indian and Chinese monastics and scholars rather thanmy countryfolk. Also I should have aspired to be equal to the gods of heavensand invisible worlds, Buddhas and bodhisattvas. In view of such a realization,the holders of the title of Great Teacher in this country seemed to meworthless, like earthen tiles, and my whole life was changed completely.53[notes.html#ch2_53]This passage summarized Dōgen’s ten-plus years of spiritual struggle at Hiei andKenninji. His original question remained unanswered; he could not find a rightteacher, and the general circumstances of Japanese Buddhism at the time wereunfavorable to him. Regarding his failure to find a right teacher (shōshi),Dōgen wrote:Right teachers have not appeared in our country since olden times. How can wetell this? Observe their utterances. They are like those who try to fathom thesource of a stream by scooping up a handful of water. Although the ancientteachers of this country wrote books, taught disciples, and expounded teachingsto humans and gods, their speeches were green and their expression yet immature.They did not attain the summit of an intellectual grasp of doctrines, much lessthe neighborhood of enlightenment. They merely transmitted words and letters,while their disciples recited names and sounds. Day and night they countedothers’ riches for nothing. Herein lies my charge against the ancient teachers.Some led people to seek enlightenment outside the conditions of mind, whilestill others led them to desire rebirth in other lands. Confusions arise fromand delusions originate in this.… Alas, Buddhism has not yet been disseminatedin this tiny remote country, and right teachers have not yet appeared. If youwant to study the best of Buddhism, you should consult the scholarship of Chinafar away and reflect thoroughly on the living path that transcends the deludedmind. When you don’t meet a right teacher, it is better not to study Buddhism atall.54 [notes.html#ch2_54]Uttered by a man with an essentially conservative frame of mind, these wordswere a startling attack on the immaturity of contemporary Japanese Buddhism.Perhaps as a result of this disillusionment, the possibility (or moreappropriately the necessity) of study in China, which had been originallysuggested by Kōin, might have emerged in Dōgen’s mind as the next step necessaryfor the fulfillment of his search for truth. Or as Takeuchi surmises, the Jōkyū(or Shōkyū) War in 1221 with all its miseries and sufferings—especially thebanishment of three ex-emperors (all of whom were related to Dōgen’s family),countless bloody executions, and the involvement of armed monastics—may haveprompted Dōgen’s decision to study in China.55 [notes.html#ch2_55] Dōgen broughtthe matter to Myōzen, and both began preparing to study abroad immediately afterthe Jōkyū War.56 [notes.html#ch2_56] In the second month of 1223, after dueformalities, a party of Myōzen, Dōgen, and others left the Kenninji temple andtoward the end of the third month set sail for China from Hakata in Chikuzen.The group’s voyage on the East China Sea was not always smooth. Particularly forDōgen—a man of frail physical frame who probably had not had any previousexperience on a ship, the voyage must have been a tough one.57[notes.html#ch2_57] Early in the fourth month, the ship arrived atCh’ing-yüan-fu in Mingchou (now the province of Chekiang). While Myōzenimmediately entered the Ching-tê-ssŭ temple on Mt. T’ien-t’ung, Dōgen lived onthe ship, visited various other temples, and observed the Chinese customs untilearly in the seventh month, when he was able to enroll at the Ching-tê-ssŭtemple.58 [notes.html#ch2_58]While Dōgen was living on the ship, an old Chinese monk who was sixtyone yearsof age came on board to get Japanese shiitake (a kind of mushroom for soup). Hewas the chief cook at the monastery on Mt. A-yü-wang (Yüwang), situated someeighty-five miles from where the ship was anchored. In the course of a livelyconversation, Dōgen, paying courtesy to the old man, asked him to stay overnightand talk some more. The old man, however, declined and insisted on returning tothe monastery immediately after he bought the shiitake. Dōgen apparently couldnot understand why this man had to return in such a hurry, despite the fact thatthe monastic food, in Dōgen’s view, could readily be prepared by other cookswithout him. In response to Dōgen’s puzzlement, the old man said: “The reasonfor my being the chief cook at such an old age is that I regard this duty as thepractice of the Way (bendō) for the rest of my life. How can I leave my practiceto other persons? Besides I did not obtain permission for staying out.” ThenDōgen asked: “Why are you, a person of advanced age, engaged in such atroublesome task as the chief cook rather than in practicing zazen or readingthe kōans of old masters? Is there any worthwhile thing in your work?” To thisquestion, the old monk laughed loudly and said: “You, a good man from a foreigncountry, perhaps do not understand what the practice of the Way is, nor whatwords and letters (monji) are.” Upon hearing this old man’s remark, Dōgen was“all of a sudden shocked and ashamed profoundly.” Promising Dōgen that he woulddiscuss the matter some day in the future, the old man disappeared hurriedlyinto the gathering dusk.59 [notes.html#ch2_59]In the seventh month of 1223, Dōgen at last left the ship and enrolled at theChing-tê-ssû temple on Mt. T’ien-t’ung where Wu-chi Liao-p’ai (d. 1224) wasabbot. This was the same temple where Eisai had studied and as one of the “FiveMountains,” was a leading center of Zen Buddhism in China. It was supported bythe Chinese royal court and had a population of monastics that was reportedlynever fewer than one thousand.60 [notes.html#ch2_60]One day in the seventh month, soon after Dōgen’s enrollment at the Chingtê-ssŭtemple, a second meeting took place between Dōgen and the old chief cook.61[notes.html#ch2_61] The old man was about to retire from his post at theA-yü-wang monastery and was going to leave for his native village. The twopicked up their discussion where they had left off previously. Dōgen asked:“What are words and letters?” The answer came: “One, two, three, four, five.”“What is the practice of the Way, then?” asked Dōgen. “Nothing throughout theentire universe is concealed” (henkai-fuzōzō) was the old man’s reply. Theirlively discussion continued without their knowing where to end it. Dōgen wrotelater:Just as the words and letters I have seen thus far are one, two, three, four,and five, so the words and letters I see now are also six, seven, eight, nine,and ten. The monastics of future generations will be able to understand anondiscriminative Zen (ichimizen) based on words and letters, if they devoteefforts to spiritual practice by seeing the universe through words and letters,and words and letters through the universe.62 [notes.html#ch2_62]Dōgen’s encounters with the old chief cook on these two occasions were decisiveevents in his subsequent life and thought. It was during these discussions thathe realized he had been pondering the relationship between practice andlanguage, between deeds and words, between activities andexpressions—specifically with respect to the place of words and letters (monji)in the scheme of things. Unlike other Zen Buddhists of the time, Dōgenrecognized the limits and dangers of language as well as, and more important,the possibility of using it for spiritual liberation by understanding the“reason of words and letters” (monji no dōri). To him, language and symbols heldthe potential of opening, rather than circumscribing, reality; consequently,they needed to be reinstated in their legitimate place within the total contextof human spiritual endeavors.At this juncture it is worthwhile to review the place of Buddhism in general,and Zen (Ch’an) in particular, during the Sung period. When Dōgen visited China,it was nearly a century after the establishment of Southern Sung (1127–1279)with its capital in Hangchow (Lin-an), which governed central and southernChina. (Northern China was controlled by the Chin.) China suffered constantthreats of foreign invasion, internal political factionalism, and militaryweakness, while at the same time it enjoyed unprecedented economic,technological, and cultural advances. Neo-Confucianism was the predominantideology of the day and was destined to become the official learning of China.Buddhism had been steadily declining in those days in contrast to its golden ageduring the Sui-T’ang period (581–907). This was due to several factors, asobserved by Ch’en:63 [notes.html#ch2_63] (1) the moral degeneration of monasticcommunities due to the sale of monasterial certificates and honorary clericaltitles by the Chinese government in order to cope with its severe financialdifficulties; (2) the rise of Neo-Confucianism to intellectual eminence; (3) thecivil service examination system that lured many able men to the study of theConfucian classics for prestige and power; (4) the popularity of the Zen andPure Realm schools of Buddhism, which tended to be anti-textual andanti-scholastic and did not produce great thinkers comparable to those of theT’ang period; and (5) the decline of Buddhism in India during the eleventh andtwelfth centuries, which resulted in the end of cultural exchange between Indianand Chinese Buddhists. Despite all this, the Zen and Pure Realm schools werestill active, and Zen in particular was held in the highest esteem.64[notes.html#ch2_64] Although Neo-Confucianists rejected Zen, their thoughtcontained Buddhist and Zen elements, and the culture of the period owed as muchto Zen Buddhism as to Neo-Confucianism.65 [notes.html#ch2_65] Yet although Zencommunities were expanding physically and their economic activities werevigorous, Zen lacked the rigor, authenticity, and brilliance it had had in theprevious period and showed its inner impoverishment and decay.66[notes.html#ch2_66] Moreover, Zen teachers began to meddle with politics, andZen monasteries soon became centers of social and political life.67[notes.html#ch2_67]On various occasions, Dōgen himself wrote about the state of affairs of ZenBuddhism, which he witnessed during his stay in China. For example:Those who allegedly study vinaya today in the great country of Sung drinkheavily and are intoxicated, in contradiction to the name of śrāvaka—yet theyneither are ashamed of, nor have regret for, nor are aware of, the fact thatthey are transmitting a family heritage entirely foreign to their owntradition.68 [notes.html#ch2_68]Although there are in China a great number of those who proclaim themselves tobe the descendants of the Buddhas and ancestors, there are few who study thetruth and accordingly there are few who teach the truth.… Thus those people whohave not the slightest idea of what the great Way of the Buddhas and ancestorsis now become the teachers of monastics.69 [notes.html#ch2_69]…In the country of Sung lately there are those who call themselves Zen teachers.However, they do not understand the wealth and depth of Dharma and areinexperienced. Reciting a few words of Lin-chi and Yün-mên, they take them forthe whole truth of Buddhism. If Buddhism had been exhausted by a few words ofLin-chi and Yün-mên, it would not have survived until today.… These people,stupid and foolish, cannot comprehend the spirit of the sūtras, slander themarbitrarily, and neglect to study them. They are truly a group ofnon-Buddhists.70 [notes.html#ch2_70]These forthright criticisms were made as a result of Dōgen’s keen observationsof Zen Buddhism in China. As these quotations amply show, the religioussituation in China was not too far from what Dōgen had experienced in his owncountry.Another aspect of contemporary Buddhism and Zen criticized by Dōgen was a theoryof “the unity of three religions” (sankyō-itchi) of Confucianism, Taoism, andBuddhism. This theory was advocated not only outside, but even within, theBuddhist circle, probably because the survival of Buddhism was guaranteed onlyby its coming to terms with Confucianism and Taoism under extremely unfavorableconditions. Dōgen witnessed a number of those who held this popular view:Lately, a number of the shallow-minded in the country of Sung do not understandthe purport and substance [of the doctrine of “All things themselves areultimate reality” (shohō-jissō)] and regard the statements of ultimate reality(jissō) as false. Furthermore, they study the doctrines of Lao-tzŭandChuang-tzŭ, maintaining that they are the same as the Way of the Buddhas andancestors. Also, there is a view of the unity of Confucianism, Taoism, andBuddhism. Some say that the three are just like the three legs of a tripodkettle which cannot stand upright if it lacks even one leg. There is nothingcomparable to the foolishness of such a view.71 [notes.html#ch2_71]Apart from the general state of Buddhism and Zen, Dōgen’s criticism was directedprimarily at the Lin-chi (Rinzai) sect popular at the time. As Dōgen wrote, “Inthe country of Sung today the Lin-chi sect alone prevails everywhere.”72[notes.html#ch2_72] Of the two separate lines of transmission in the sect, theline of Huang-lung Hui-nan (1002–1069) and the line of Yang-ch’i Fang-hui(992–1049), the latter brought forth the highest development in Chinese ZenBuddhism. Although Dōgen was already familiar with the Huang-lung linetransmitted by Eisai, which he had studied at the Kenninji temple, what heencountered in China was the Yang-ch’i tradition, whose best-knownrepresentative was Ta-hui Tsung-kao (1089–1163). Dōgen denounced him and hisfollowers relentlessly; he may have been prejudiced to some degree, yet hisprimary reason seems to have been their involvement with political and othersecular interests and concerns, and their transcendentalistic interpretation ofZen which we shall have an occasion to investigate later.73 [notes.html#ch2_73]It is easy to understand Dōgen’s great disappointment with the general conditionof Buddhism and especially that of Zen in China. Although he stayed at theChing-tê-ssŭ temple for nearly two years under Wu-chi Liaop’ai, Dōgen’sspiritual needs were not fully satisfied. Thus, while he was at the Ching-tê-ssŭtemple, Dōgen seems to have visited various nearby Zen monasteries.74[notes.html#ch2_74] Upon Wu-chi’s death toward the end of 1224, Dōgen left Mt.T’ien-t’ung and began traveling extensively, visiting the various temples andmonasteries of the “Five Mountains” and studying the characteristics of the“Five Houses” of Chinese Zen Buddhism. As a result of this wandering, Dōgengained firsthand acquaintance with Chinese Buddhism but still did not find aright teacher.75 [notes.html#ch2_75]With a thoroughly discontented heart, Dōgen decided to return home afterrealizing the futility of staying in China any longer, and set out to pay hislast visit to Mt. T’ien-t’ung where Myōzen had been ill for some time.76[notes.html#ch2_76] On the way to T’ien-t’ung, Dōgen learned of the death of hisformer teacher, Wu-chi Liao-p’ai, and his heart was greatly saddened. Whilerevisiting the Ching-shan Wan-shou-ssŭ temple, Dōgen met an old monk whoinformed him of Ju-ching (1163–1228), well known as a peerless master in ZenBuddhism, who had been appointed abbot of the Mt. T’ien-t’ung monastery by theChinese royal court and whom the old monk urged Dōgen to see as soon aspossible.It was early in the fifth month of 1225 when Dōgen met Ju-ching at long last atMiao-kao-t’ai, the latter’s private quarters.77 [notes.html#ch2_77] “I metMaster Ju-ching face to face. This was an encounter between a man and a man,”Dōgen later wrote.78 [notes.html#ch2_78] Ju-ching’s warm reception of Dōgen wasthat of a loving father welcoming his beloved son; he told Dōgen to visit himand freely ask questions at his own private quarters at any time without theslightest ceremony. This availability of the great teacher rekindled in theyoung inquiring mind a burning desire for truth.79 [notes.html#ch2_79] Howearnestly Dōgen had longed for such a meeting! As we have observed before, Dōgenonce went so far as to say: “When you don’t meet a right teacher, it is betternot to study Buddhism at all.”80 [notes.html#ch2_80] He also wrote: “Withoutmeeting a right teacher, you do not hear the right Dharma.”81[notes.html#ch2_81] Dōgen was convinced that the actualization or perfection ofDharma largely depended upon the ability and competence of a teacher to shapethe disciple as an artisan shapes raw material.82 [notes.html#ch2_82]More important, however, the personal encounter was absolutely necessary inDōgen’s view, for Dharma did not emerge in a vacuum, but invariably emerged in aconcrete social context, in which persons were significantly related to oneanother.83 [notes.html#ch2_83] “When a person meets a person, intimate words areheard and deciphered.”84 [notes.html#ch2_84] The season was ripe for the mysteryof Dharma to decisively unfold itself in the meeting between Ju-ching and Dōgenon Mt. T’ien-t’ung.Let me digress a little at this point. Ju-ching, a native of Yüeh-chou, leftthere at the age of nineteen, traveled all over China, visited Zen temples andmonasteries, and studied Buddhism under various teachers. Later he became adisciple of Tsu-an (or Chih-chien) on Mt. Hsüeh-t’ou and attained enlightenment.Then he went on a pilgrimage throughout the country for nearly forty years andpresided over various famous monasteries such as Ch’ingliang in Chien-k’ang,Shui-yen in T’ai-chou, Ching-tz’ŭ in Lin-an, Shuiyen in Ming-chou, Ching-tz’ŭagain, and lastly T’ien-t’ung. Although the T’ien-t’ung monastery wastraditionally presided over by abbots of the Linchi sect, Ju-ching belonged tothe tradition of the Ts’ao-tung (Sōtō) sect, and more specifically, to theChen-hsieh line of that sect in China.85 [notes.html#ch2_85]We are told that during this period, Ju-ching never failed, even for a singleday, to practice zazen, the traditional form of Buddhist meditation thatemphasized the upright lotus posture, steady breathing, and mental freedom fromall attachments, desires, concepts, and judgments. Ju-ching devoted so much timeto zazen that the flesh of his buttocks repeatedly broke out in sores; yet whenthis happened, he would practice it more earnestly.86 [notes.html#ch2_86]Ju-ching’s educational method reflected this disciplinary rigorism and monasticasceticism. As Dōgen wrote:When I stayed once at the T’ien-t’ung monastery, I saw that Ju-ching,accompanied by other elders in the monastics’ hall, used to practice zazen untileleven o’clock in the evening and begin at dawn as early as two-thirty or three;he never failed to practice this even a single night.87 [notes.html#ch2_87]This uncompromising rigor, whether toward himself or his disciples, was combinedwith utter sincerity and personal warmth. Dōgen recounted the following movingepisode:Ju-ching, my former teacher and abbot of the T’ien-t’ung monastery, admonishedthose who had fallen asleep during zazen practice in the monastics’ hall,striking them with his shoe and scolding them with harsh words. Neverthelessmonks rejoiced in being struck by the teacher and admired him.Once he spoke to the congregation in the hall: “At such an advanced age, Ishould now retire from the monastic community, seclude myself in a cottage, andcare for my remaining days. However, I am in the office of abbot as your leaderin order to help each of you break delusions and find the Way. For this reason Isometimes utter scolding words and strike with a bamboo rod, although I do thisvery carefully. It is a method to educate people in the place of Buddha. Sobrothers, forgive me with compassion.” Thereupon all the monks wept.88[notes.html#ch2_88]Thus, Dōgen had an unreservedly high regard for his teacher who advocated“zazen-only” (shikan-taza), which later became the heart of Dōgen’s religion andphilosophy:There are throughout the country of great Sung not merely a hundred or two, butthousands, of those who allegedly advocate the practice of meditation andthereby profess to be remote descendants of the ancestors. However, I hear ofnone who exhort zazen-only. Throughout China, only Master Ju-ching [is anexception].89 [notes.html#ch2_89]The central religious and philosophical idea of Ju-ching’s zazen-only was the“body-mind cast off” (shinjin-datsuraku)—the phrase repeated tirelessly by Dōgenthroughout his works.Ju-ching was also famous for his rare uninterest in worldly fame and gain, whichhad corrupted Buddhism of the time to the marrow. Dōgen observed:My former teacher neither approached an emperor nor met one. No intimateacquaintance with ministers and governmental officials was made. Not only did hedecline the purple robe and the title of Great Teacher but he also did not wearcolorful robes—instead, he always wore a black robe or a simple one-piece gown,whether during lectures or private sessions.90 [notes.html#ch2_90]Ju-ching was utterly indifferent to pecuniary gains; Dōgen professed to witnessthis quality in his teacher alone and in no one else.91 [notes.html#ch2_91]During the Sung period, the so-called Five Houses of Zen were feuding, althoughthe Lin-chi sect dominated over all others. Ju-ching, although nurtured in theTs’ao-tung tradition, detested sectarian biases and divisions and even dislikedusing the name of Zen, as opposed to other Buddhist sects and schools. He aimedat the catholicity of Buddhism at large. We can glimpse Ju-ching’s thought fromthe following descriptions of Dōgen:My former teacher, Ju-ching, once gave a sermon to monastics: “In recent timespeople assert seriously that there are distinct traditions of Yün-mên, Fa-yen,Wei-yang, Lin-chi, and Ts’ao-tung. This is neither Buddhism, nor the teaching ofthe Buddhas and ancestors.Such a realization of the Way can be found not even once in a millennium, butTeacher alone comprehends it. Nor is it heard in the ten directions of theuniverse, but Teacher alone hears it.”92 [notes.html#ch2_92]And then:It ought to be clear that nothing could be more seriously mistaken than to callit “a school of Zen.” Foolish persons lament as if they failed in Buddhistscholarship on account of not having the designation of a school or a sect afterthe fashion of the “school of realism,” the “school of nihilism,” etc. Such isnot the Way of Buddhism. No one ever called it “the school of Zen.”Nevertheless, mediocre persons in recent times are foolish enough to disregardthe old tradition and, having no instructions from Buddhas, maintain erroneouslythat there are five distinct traditions in [Zen] Buddhism. This shows itsnatural decline. And no one has yet come to save this situation except myteacher, Ju-ching, who was the first one to be greatly concerned with it. Thushumanity has been fortunate; Dharma has deepened.93 [notes.html#ch2_93]Ju-ching also opposed the popular view of the unity of three religions. Itssyncretistic tendencies must have been quite unpalatable to his purist religiousprinciples.94 [notes.html#ch2_94]What emerges from our examination of Dōgen’s Hōkyōki, Shōbōgenzō, and otherworks concerning Ju-ching’s character and thought is clear. He was a strong,dynamic, charismatic personality who had an uncompromising passion for themonastic asceticism of zazen-only as the sine qua non of Buddhism. For him,Buddhism was subservient to neither worldly power nor glory; it was content withthe virtue of poverty and lived quietly deep in the mountains. Dharma was soughtfor the sake of Dharma. He strongly opposed the prevalent sectarianism ofBuddhism in general and Zen in particular. Ju-ching sought a catholic Buddhismfree from sectarian divisions. In brief, he was the embodiment of the idealismand purity of Zen monasticism that was the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma(shōden no buppō). These tenets (though no doubt selected and emphasized byDōgen) were very likely Ju-ching’s, and Dōgen enthusiastically accepted andfaithfully transmitted them, transforming them through his own distinctivelyJapanese ethos.95 [notes.html#ch2_95]Dōgen deemed Ju-ching the right teacher he had been seeking. According to Dōgen,a right teacher was described as follows:A right teacher is one who, regardless of old age or stature, comprehends theright Dharma clearly and receives the certification of a true teacher. He/shegives no precedence to words and letters or to intellectual understanding. Withan unusual ability and an extraordinary will power, he/she neither clings toselfishness nor indulges in sentimentality. He/she is the individual in whomliving and understanding complement one another (gyōge-sōō).96[notes.html#ch2_96]Dōgen must have recollected his mentor’s character and thought as he wrote thesestatements some ten years later. True, Ju-ching fitted the foregoing criteriafor the right teacher, or perhaps vice versa. In any case, Dōgen exalted andadored his teacher—with tears of gratitude and joy—so much so that his rhetoricmay have superseded any factual descriptions of Ju-ching.97 [notes.html#ch2_97]Nevertheless, we cannot but acknowledge the picture of a towering personalitywho decisively shaped the destiny of Dōgen’s subsequent life.What is significant is Dōgen’s absolute devotion to the person whom heconsidered the right teacher, and consequently the authority and tradition theteacher represented. Such was the case in spite of Dōgen’s equally indomitabledefiance of political power and authority, and his respect for intellectualindependence.98 [notes.html#ch2_98]In turn, Ju-ching admired his Japanese disciple and once asked him to become hisassistant, saying: “In spite of being a foreigner, you, Dōgen, are a man ofsuperior character.” Dōgen, however, “positively declined the offer.”99[notes.html#ch2_99]As such, the teacher and disciple studied and practiced together for two years(1225–27) in almost ideal rapport. This, however, should not suggest that therewas a complete absence of conflicts between them. Dōgen later acknowledged thatconflicts between teacher and disciple were a necessary condition for the righttransmission of Dharma. He wrote: “The common endeavor of teacher and disciplein practice and understanding constitute the entwined vines of the Buddhas andancestors (busso no kattō), that is, the life force of theskin-flesh-bones-marrow of Dharma (hiniku-kotsuzui no meimyaku).”100[notes.html#ch2_100] “Entwined vines” in the traditional Zen parlance referredto doctrinal sophistries, intellectual entanglements, and conflicts. Dōgen saw,contrary to the Zen tradition, the positive values of such conflicts in thepersonal encounter of teacher and disciple. Both teacher and disciple grewtogether through such entwined vines.Under Ju-ching, Dōgen studied and practiced meditation without sparing himself.Dōgen later recalled:After hearing this truth [the sole importance of zazen] from the instruction ofmy former teacher of T’ien-t’ung, I practiced zazen day and night. When othermonastics gave up zazen temporarily for fear that they might fall ill at thetime of extreme heat or cold, I thought to myself: “I should still devote myselfto zazen even to the point of death from disease. If I do not practice zazeneven without illness, what is the use of taking care of my body? I shall bequite satisfied to die of a disease. What good fortune it is to practice zazenunder such a great teacher of the great country of Sung, to end my life, and tobe disposed by good monastics …” Thinking thus continually, I resolutely sat inzazen day and night, and no illness came at all.101 [notes.html#ch2_101]Dōgen’s apprenticeship matured daily in such an uncompromising asceticism.In 1225, a decisive moment of enlightenment in Dōgen’s life came at long lastduring an early morning zazen session at geango (i.e., the three-month intensivemeditational retreat).102 [notes.html#ch2_102] In the course of meditation, amonk next to Dōgen inadvertently had fallen asleep. Upon noticing the monk,Juching thundered at him: “In zazen it is imperative to cast off the body andmind. How could you indulge in sleeping?” This remark shook Dōgen’s whole beingto its very core, and then an inexpressible, ecstatic joy engulfed his heart. InJu-ching’s private quarters that same morning, Dōgen offered incense andworshiped Buddha. This unusual action of Dōgen prompted Ju-ching to ask: “Whatis the incense-burning for?” The disciple exuberantly answered: “My body andmind are cast off!” “The body and mind are cast off ” (shinjin-datsuraku),joined the teacher, “cast off are the body and mind” (datsuraku-shinjin). Thus,Ju-ching acknowledged the authenticity of Dōgen’s enlightenment.103[notes.html#ch2_103]This event, sudden and transformative, was not an isolated one but the necessaryfruition of Dōgen’s long spiritual struggle. What Dōgen’s mind had consciouslyand unconsciously groped for and reflected upon finally took shape dramaticallyin these unique circumstances. It was at this moment that Dōgen’s question, withwhich he had lived since his residence on Mt. Hiei, was finally resolved.104[notes.html#ch2_104] The significance of the key notion of “casting off thebody-mind” in the context of Dōgen’s life and thought was that zazen-only, asthe mythic-cultic archetype, symbolized the totality of the self and the worldand represented that in which Buddha-nature became embodied. To cast off thebody-mind did not nullify historical and social existence so much as to put itinto action so that it could be the self-creative and self-expressive embodimentof Buddha-nature. In being “cast off,” however, concrete human existence wasfashioned in the mode of radical freedom—purposeless, goalless, objectless, andmeaningless. Buddha-nature was not to be enfolded in, but was to unfold through,human activities and expressions. The meaning of existence was finally freedfrom and authenticated by its all-too-human conditions only if, and when, itlived co-eternally with ultimate meaninglessness.What was taking place then in Dōgen’s mind was a radical demythologizing and inturn, remythologizing of the whole Buddhist symbol-complex of originalenlightenment, Buddha-nature, emptiness, and other related ideas and practices.The crux of his vision lay in a realistic affirmation and transformation of whatwas relative, finite, and temporal in a nondualistic vision of the self and theworld. To understand duality lucidly and to penetrate it thoroughly within anondualistic mode of existence was Dōgen’s final solution. His remaining lifeconsisted of his intellectual, moral, and cultic efforts to enact and elucidatethis vision in the specific historical and social conditions of his time.In the ninth month of 1225, Ju-ching conferred upon Dōgen the officialcertificate of the ancestral succession to the Chen-hsieh line of the Ts’aotungsect. On this day, the sect saw the succession of a Japanese monk for the firsttime in the history of Chinese Buddhism.One day in 1227, Dōgen told Ju-ching his intention to return to Japan; thelatter gave him the sacerdotal robe transmitted from the time of FuyungTao-chiai (1043–1118), the genealogical document of ancestral succession,105[notes.html#ch2_105] his own portrait,106 [notes.html#ch2_106] and otherprecious objects. Except for these objects that he received from Ju-ching, Dōgenreturned to Japan “empty handed” (kūshu-genkyō). Unlike other Buddhists who hadpreviously studied in China, Dōgen brought home with him no sūtras, images, ordocuments. His sole “souvenir” presented to his countrymen was his body, mind,and total existence, now completely liberated and transformed. He himself wasthe surest evidence of Dharma and as such, Dōgen transmitted the Chen-hsieh lineof Sōtō Zen to Japan. The date of Dōgen’s return to Japan was probably sometimein the fall of 1227. Ju-ching died a year later in 1228.Meanwhile, Myōzen, who had been studying at the T’ien-t’ung monastery ever sincehis arrival in China, died in 1225, soon after Dōgen met Ju-ching. Dōgen broughtMyōzen’s remains to Japan with him and very soon thereafter wrote theSharisōdenki (Account of the Death of Myōzen Zenji).Dōgen concluded the period of his apprenticeship with the following:Further, I went to great Sung, visited good teachers throughout the province ofChekiang, and investigated the various traditions of the Five Houses. Finally, Ibecame the disciple of Ju-ching on T’ai-pai fêng [the Ching-tê-ssŭ temple on Mt.T’ien-t’ung], and the great matter of my entire life (isshō sangaku no daiji)was thus resolved.107 [notes.html#ch2_107]TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE WAY IN JAPAN [toc.html#ch2_h2_4]Upon his arrival In Japan, Dōgen immediately returned to the Kenninji templeafter a four-year absence. The chaotic situation he had witnessed before had notchanged much. In fact, it had worsened in every respect.108 [notes.html#ch2_108]Dōgen, however, expressed his sense of mission this way: “In the first year ofthe Shao-ting era [1228–1233] of the Sung dynasty I returned to my native place[Kyoto] and vowed to propagate Dharma and save all beings of the world. I feltthen that a heavy load was on my shoulders.”109 [notes.html#ch2_109] In the fallof the same year, Dōgen wrote the Fukan zazengi (General Advice on thePrinciples of Zazen), which might have been regarded as the manifesto of Dōgen’s“new” Buddhism vis-à-vis the established Buddhism of Japan. At the beginning ofthe book, Dōgen proclaimed:If the Way is originally perfect and ubiquitous, why do we distinguish betweenpractice and enlightenment? If the supreme Dharma is free, why do we need ourefforts to attain it? Inasmuch as the whole truth has nothing to do with theworld’s dust, why do we believe in the means of wiping it away? The Way is notseparate from here and now; so what is the use of getting a foothold inpractice? However, when there is even the slightest gap between two opposites,they are poles asunder like heaven and earth. When “for” and “against” aredifferentiated, even unconsciously, we are doomed to lose the Buddha-mind. Itshould be perfectly clear that infinite recurrences of rebirth is due to ourmental discrimination, while delusions of this world arise from an incessantpersistence of selfish deliberation. If you wish to surpass even the pinnacle ofspiritual advancement, you should understand clearly the here and-now as it is(jikige no jōtō). Even if you boast of your understanding of Dharma and arerichly gifted in enlightenment, even if you attain the Way and illuminate yourmind, even if you are about to enter the realm of enlightenment with a soaringspirit, you are still short of the total freedom in which enlightenment itselfis transcended (shusshin no ro). Although Buddha was endowed with naturalknowledge, he sat in zazen for six years. Bodhidharma bequeathed us the legacyof the Buddhamind, yet still sat facing a wall for nine years. Such were theancient sages. Why can we not practice like them? Therefore, desist frompursuing words and letters intellectually and reflect upon your self inwardly(ekō-henshō). Thus your body and mind shall be cast off naturally and youroriginal nature (honrai no memmoku) shall be realized. If you wish to attain it,be diligent in zazen at once.110 [notes.html#ch2_110]The above statement indicated the direction and character of Dōgen’s thought andactivity in the subsequent period of his life. In the simplest and purest formof zazen-only, Dōgen found the essence and prototype of Buddhist cultus as wellas mythos, and the crystallization of practice and enlightenment.Dōgen stayed at the Kenninji temple for three years. In the meantime, as thepeculiarities of his Zen manifested themselves in his teaching and education ofdisciples, and his name became evermore famous, enmity from both Hiei andKenninji seems to have been aggravated. It was perhaps this antagonism that ledDōgen eventually to move in 1230 to an abandoned temple called An’yōin inFukakusa.111 [notes.html#ch2_111] While at An’yōin, Dōgen wrote the Shōbōgenzō,“Bendōwa,” which expounded his basic tenets in the form of eighteen questionsand answers. Expanding the basic thought of the Fukan zazengi, Dōgen clarifiedthe purpose of writing this chapter, which also applied to all his subsequentwritings:In our country, principles of zazen practice have not yet been transmitted. Thisis a sad situation for those who try to understand zazen. For this reason I haveendeavored to organize what I learned in China, to transcribe some wiseteachers’ teachings, and thereby to impart them to those who wish to practiceand understand zazen.112 [notes.html#ch2_112]Thus with the Fukan zazengi and the “Bendōwa” chapter, Dōgen laid thecornerstone of his religious and philosophical citadel. Upon this foundationDōgen’s Zen Buddhism, though initially transplanted from China, graduallydeveloped into a distinctively Japanese form that was the product of thesymbolic model Dōgen had inherited from Buddhist traditions (which will begreatly elaborated later on), his own idiosyncracies, and the social andhistorical peculiarities of thirteenth-century Japan. The Way was transmittedand transformed.As the number of his followers had increased steadily, Dōgen moved again in1233, this time to the Kannon-dōriin temple in Fukakusa which had been built asthe Gokurakuji temple and maintained by the Fujiwara family for generations.Dōgen’s life at Kannon-dōriin for the following ten years (1233–43) was his mostcreative period, literarily and otherwise: he expanded the originalKannon-dōriin into the Kōshō-hōrinji temple, accepted Koun Ejō (1198–1280) ashis disciple and the head monk (shuso) of the temple,113 [notes.html#ch2_113]and wrote forty-four chapters of the Shōbōgenzō, including such cruciallyimportant chapters as “Genjō-kōan” and “Busshō,” and the Eihei shoso gakudōyōjinshū, and the Tenzo kyōkun. These events were intimately interconnected withone another.In the winter of 1234, Ejō became a disciple of Dōgen. From the age of seventeenEjō had studied such schools of Buddhism as Tendai, Shingon, Kusha(Abhidharmakośa), Jōjitsu (Satyasiddhi), and Hossō (Yogācāra), on Mt. Hiei, andlater the Pure Realm school from Shōkū (1147–1247),114 [notes.html#ch2_114] andZen Buddhism from Kakuan of Tōnomine. Thus Ejō was already well versed inBuddhism in general. He probably met Dōgen for the first time immediately afterthe latter returned from China. Although Ejō was two years older than Dōgen, hemust have been impressed by Dōgen’s fresh interpretation of Buddhism in generaland Zen in particular. Two years after this first meeting, Ejō became Dōgen’sdisciple. For nearly twenty years thereafter, until Dōgen’s death, teacher anddisciple worked together to found Sōtō Zen in Japan. The timing of Ejō’sdiscipleship was crucially important as Dōgen needed an able co-worker for theeducation of disciples, administration of the temple, and also for the impendingfounding of the Kōshōji temple.In the twelfth month of 1235, Dōgen started a fund-raising campaign for thebuilding of a new monastics’ hall (sōdō), the center of monastic activities. Inlight of the calamitous circumstances of the time, this drive must have been farfrom easy; yet the completion of the monastics’ hall was accomplished in thefall of the following year. In the Shōbōgenzō zuimonki, Ejō reported thefollowing remarks made by Dōgen:It should not be thought to be necessarily for the growth of Buddhism that wenow campaign for the building fund of the monastics’ hall and take pains withthat project. At present the number of students is still small, so, instead ofdoing nothing and wasting time, I want to offer an opportunity for those whohave gone astray to get acquainted with Buddhism and, at the same time, toprovide a place for monastics to practice zazen. Also there should be no regreteven if the original project is not completed. I will not be distressed even ifpeople in the future, seeing just one pillar built, think that despite myintentions, I failed to finish it.115 [notes.html#ch2_115]In the tenth month of 1236, the opening ceremony of the monastics’ hall wassuccessfully held and the temple was officially named Kōshō-hōrinji temple. Aswe shall see, this was an epoch-making event in the history of Japanese ZenBuddhism, because it was the realization of Po-chang’s envisionment in which themonastics’ hall was the center of Zen monastic life. In the twelfth month, Dōgenappointed Ejō as head monk whose function was to assist the abbot in alleducational and religious matters in the monastic community. At the same time,Ejō delivered his first sermon in place of Dōgen.116 [notes.html#ch2_116] Abouta year later, the Dharma hall (hattō) was added to the temple through theefforts of Shōgaku Zenni. This, combined with the Buddha hall (butsuden) thathad existed from the beginning, marked the realization of Dōgen’s dream in whichthe monastics’ hall, the Dharma hall, and the Buddha hall became the three mostimportant buildings of a monastic community.117 [notes.html#ch2_117] TheKōshō-hōrinji temple was gradually shaping up as one of the most powerfulcenters of Buddhism in Japan.Dōgen opened his monastic community for everyone, regardless of intelligence,social status, sex, or profession. His religion was through and through thereligion of the people, as were other “new” Kamakura Buddhist sects. His logicof universalism was thorough, if not always consistent. Dōgen wrote: “In theirexcess of mercy the Buddhas and ancestors have opened the boundless gate ofcompassion (kōdai no jimon) so that all sentient beings may be led intoenlightenment. Who in the heavens and on earth cannot enter it?”118[notes.html#ch2_118] Dōgen, like Shinran, proclaimed: “There is a very easy wayto become a Buddha,”119 [notes.html#ch2_119] and “Zazen-only is of the foremostimportance for the growth of a Zen monastic. Through the practice of zazen,irrespective of intelligence, one will mature naturally.”120[notes.html#ch2_120] He also said:The true learning of the Way is not dependent on one’s native intelligence oracquired learning, nor on cleverness or quickness. This should not be construedas an exhortation to become like the blind, the deaf, or the fool. Truth doesnot employ erudition and high intelligence; so do not despair of being endowedwith slowness and inferior intelligence. For the true learning of the Way shouldbe easy.121 [notes.html#ch2_121]Similar statements are replete in Dōgen’s works. Despite his aristocratic originand philosophical erudition, nothing was more alien to his thought than socialcondescension or intellectual arrogance.Dōgen’s religion abolished the separation between monastics and lay persons.“Those who regard mundane activity as an obstacle to the Buddha-dharma know onlythat there is no Buddha-dharma in the mundane life; they do not yet know thatthere is no mundane life in the Buddha-dharma.”122 [notes.html#ch2_122]Monastics and laity are in essence one and the same. “It [enlightenment]depends,” wrote Dōgen, “solely upon whether you have a sincere desire to seekit, not upon whether you live in a monastery or in the secular world.”123[notes.html#ch2_123]Nevertheless Dōgen also stated:Of all the Buddhas in the three periods and ten directions, not a single Buddhaattained Buddhahood through the secular life. Because of those Buddhas of thepast, monasticism and ordination have their merits. Sentient beings’ attainmentof the Way necessarily depends upon entering into the monastic’s life andreceiving the precepts. Indeed the monastic’s life and the vow to observe theprecepts, being the unchanging law of Buddhas, are possessed of boundlessmerits. Although in the holy teachings there is the view that advocates theattainment of Buddhahood through the secular life, it is not the rightlytransmitted teaching.… What the Buddhas and ancestors have rightly transmittedis to become a Buddha through the monastic’s life.124 [notes.html#ch2_124]Dōgen went so far as to say that “even if a monastic violates the precepts,he/she is superior to a lay person who does not break his/her precepts.”125[notes.html#ch2_125] Herein lies one of the thorniest problems in Dōgenstudies—his view on monasticism and laity. However, as we shall see in moredetail later, Dōgen held from beginning to end that “homelessness” was the idealpossibility or model of rightly transmitted Buddhism and transcended both themonastic’s and the layperson’s lives in their ordinary senses. Dōgen’suniversalism was envisioned in terms of this monastic elitism,126[notes.html#ch2_126] that is to say, Dōgen held up the monastic life as achallenge to his Buddhist contemporaries as well as to the secularists of thetime. The monastic life was not a withdrawal from the world, but a protest, aninvitation, a recommendation to the world. It is in this light that weunderstand Dōgen’s idealization of monasticism and his relentless demand thathis disciples pursue the Way for the sake of the Way, without accommodatingthemselves to worldly interests and concerns. Fundamentally speaking, the idealof monasticism was the ideal of every human being—to be born was one’sinitiation into monastic life. He wrote:Therefore, whether you are a heavenly being, human, ruler, or public official,whether you are a layperson, monastic, servant, or brute, you should uphold theBuddhist precepts and rightly transmit the monastics’ robes in order to become achild of Buddha. Indeed this is the shortest way to rightly enter the rank ofBuddha.127 [notes.html#ch2_127]This was quite different from approaches taken by his contemporaries such asShinran and Nichiren, who while equally anti-secular and anti-authoritarian,approached the matter of liberation by adapting the Way to the levels of thecommon people (taiki-seppō) who were living in the Age of Degenerate Law. Theeasy path (igyō), which called for the recitation of “Namu-Amida-Butsu” (myōgō)and “Namu-Myōhō-Rengekyō” (daimoku), was “superior” to other methods preciselybecause it was superlatively adapted to the religious situation of the age. Itwas the means by which these leaders involved themselves in human existence.On the other hand, accommodating himself to inferior and mediocre minds appealedlittle to Dōgen. In this respect, Dōgen retained his aristocratic elitism whileat the same time detesting any flattering association with power and authority.It must be remembered that at this time incessant earthquakes, epidemics, fires,famines, social unrest, and so forth, had brought incalculable suffering uponthe entire populace. Yet, unlike Shinran and Nichiren, Dōgen seems to have beenimpervious to this, not because he lacked compassion but because his compassionwas modulated in a different key, although some may undoubtedly interpret it asmisplaced and inhumane.Dōgen repudiated, at least in principle, religious discrimination between thesexes. Regarding the question of whether zazen can be practiced by men and womenin the secular life or only practiced by monks, Dōgen answered: “Theunderstanding of Dharma, as the ancestors taught, does not depend on differencesin sex and in rank.”128 [notes.html#ch2_128] His case for the equality of sexeswas most eloquently stated in the following:Some people, foolish to the extreme, think of a woman as nothing but the objectof sensual pleasures, and see her in this way without ever correcting theirview. A Buddhist should not do so. If a man detests a woman as a sexual object,she must detest him for the same reason. Both man and woman become objects, andthus become equally involved in defilement.129 [notes.html#ch2_129]Dōgen continues:What charge is there against woman? What virtue is there in man? There arewicked men in the world; there are virtuous women in the world. The desire tohear Dharma and the search for enlightenment do not necessarily rely on thedifference in sex.130 [notes.html#ch2_130]Thus, Dōgen ridicules the Buddhist practice of “no admittance to women”(nyonin-kinzei) as “a laughable matter in Japan.”131 [notes.html#ch2_131]The rapid expansion of Dōgen’s Buddhism can be seen in the fact that an annex(jūundō) soon had to be added to the monastics’ hall in 1239. In commemorationof this event, Dōgen wrote twenty-one instructions on life in the annex in hisKannon-dōri Kōshō-gokokuji jūundōshiki, which begins with the statement: “Thosewho have believing minds and give up desire for worldly fame and gain shallenter. Those who lack sincerity shall not join; entering mistakenly, they shalldepart after due deliberation.” And: “The congregation in the hall should be inharmony with one another just like milk and water, and endeavor to live by theWay.” The book ends with this remark: “The foregoing instructions are the bodyand mind of the Buddhas and ancestors: revere and follow them.”132[notes.html#ch2_132]In 1241, such able disciples as Ekan, Gikai (1219–1309), Giin, Gien, Gijun, andothers (who had been the disciples of Dainichibō Nōnin) joined Dōgen’scommunity. It is significant to note that Dainichibō Nōnin was the favoriteamong Japanese Buddhists to establish a “pure Zen” (junsui-zen) in the countryover the traditional “mixed Zen” (kenju-zen)—this task, however, came to befulfilled by Dōgen and his disciples.Thus the primitive order of the Sōtō sect in Japan was formed with a deepcommitment to pure Zen. As we shall see, Dōgen wished to establish anunadulterated, full-fledged Zen Buddhism that was clearly distinguished from allnon-Zen schools of Buddhism as well as from those Zen schools that had blendedwith esoteric Buddhism. Dōgen, like Dainichibō Nōnin, was passionately puristicin this respect and indomitably independent of all Buddhist schools.We should also note that Hatano Yoshishige, a well-known member of the supremecourt of the shogunate in Rokuhara, became a devout follower of Dōgen andhimself entered into monkhood eventually. Hatano would play an important role inthe future development of Dōgen’s religion.The founding of the Kōshō-hōrinji temple and Ejō’s assistance gave Dōgen afavorable opportunity for the unfolding of his creative literary activity, whichI referred to previously. The core of Dōgen’s thought matured during thisperiod.As time went on, Dōgen himself felt compelled to articulate his position moredefinitively, in order to distinguish it from other schools of Buddhism. As Ihave noted already, he criticized both established and new Buddhismunflinchingly. Early in his career, he criticized Pure Realm Buddhism in thefollowing:Do you know the merits attained by the reading of the sūtras and the practice ofnembutsu? It is most pitiful that some believe in the virtue of just moving thetongue or of raising the voice. Taking them for Dharma, they become more andmore remote from it.… To try to realize the Way by way of nembutsu—moving themouth foolishly ten million times—can be compared to the attempt to leave forYüeh [south] by orienting the wheel of your cart towards the north.… Lifting thevoice incessantly is just like a frog croaking day and night in a rice pad inthe springtime. It is, after all, futile.133 [notes.html#ch2_133]In the context of his criticism of such schools as Hokke, Kegon, and Shingon,Dōgen wrote: “A Buddhist should neither argue superiority or inferiority ofdoctrines, nor settle disputes over depth or shallowness of teachings, but onlyknow authenticity or inauthenticity of practice.”134 [notes.html#ch2_134] Dōgenrelentlessly criticized the Buddhists of these schools, calling them “thescholars who count words and letters” (monji o kazouru gakusha). Dōgen sharplyset himself apart from scholastically oriented Buddhism by characterizing hisown religion as intent on the authenticity of practice, for which he had aburning sense of mission and a stubborn purism.Coupled with his rising popularity, this stubbornness and sense of mission didnot fail to irritate the traditionally-minded Buddhists, especially those on Mt.Hiei. Dōgen’s position at the Kōshō-hōrinji temple became increasinglythreatened by these traditionalists. At the same time, however, Dōgen wasoffered an attractive invitation by Hōjō Yasutoki to visit Kamakura although heflatly refused it, perhaps because his anti-authoritarian spirit would not allowhim to accept.135 [notes.html#ch2_135]Despite this, Dōgen dedicated the Gokoku shōbōgi (Significance of the RightDharma for the Protection of the Nation) to the imperial authority, whichsparked Hiei’s furies against him. In doing so, Dōgen followed the footsteps ofother Japanese Buddhists and/or the loyal family tradition of the MurakamiGenji, which revealed his deep involvement with other religionists, nobles, andwarriors—the well-known tripartite camps of the upper echelon of Kamakura Japan.A proposal to move the monastic headquarters to the province of Echizen was madeby Hatano Yoshishige, who offered his own property in the province for the siteof a new monastery. Dōgen’s acceptance of this offer seems to have been hastenedby several factors: (1) As we have seen, the pressures of established Buddhismled Dōgen to the realization that the original vision of his monastic ideal wasinsurmountably difficult to carry out in his current surroundings.136[notes.html#ch2_136] (2) As Furuta contends, his sense of rivalry with theRinzai sect, particularly with Enni Ben’en (1202–1280) of the Tōfukujitemple—Dōgen’s most powerful contemporary—might have driven him to a moreself-conscious effort to establish Sōtō Zen, as opposed to Rinzai Zen, despitehis advocacy of a catholic Buddhism. Significantly enough, his anti-Rinzairemarks became especially frequent around 1243 and thereafter.137[notes.html#ch2_137] (3) Dōgen was increasingly mindful of Ju-ching’sinstruction: “Do not stay in the center of cities or towns. Do not be friendlywith rulers and state ministers. Dwell in the deep mountains and valleys torealize the true nature of humanity.”138 [notes.html#ch2_138] (4) Dōgen’sunquenchable yearnings for nature rather than urban commotion grew in thisperiod as expressed in his exaltation of mountains and waters (sansui): “Fromthe timeless beginning have mountains been the habitat of great sages. Wise onesand sages have all made mountains their secret chambers and their bodies andminds; by them mountains are realized.”139 [notes.html#ch2_139] And finally: (5)These circumstances and factors reinforced his original belief in monasticBuddhism (shukke-Bukkyō), rather than lay Buddhism (zaike-Bukkyō). MonasticBuddhism had consistently been the model of Buddhism for Dōgen from the verybeginning. Sadly, Dōgen must have realized the impracticability of his ideal ofuniversal monasticism in the mundane world. Perhaps a bit pessimistically, hewas increasingly attracted to the community of a select few in order to achievehis utopian vision.This shift in emphasis, although not in principle, contrasted significantly withhis earlier position, namely the widest possible dissemination andpopularization of zazen in Japan. Nevertheless, his new stress on elitism,rather than universalism, did not imply in the slightest the abandonment of hismission to change the world as much as the self. We must not minimize the socialsignificance of monastic asceticism in this respect.In the seventh month of 1243, Dōgen left the care of the Kōshōji temple to hisdisciple Gijun and arrived in the province of Echizen. He immediately entered asmall temple called Kippōji, which had long been in a state of disrepair. Dōgenstayed at Kippōji and occasionally went to Yamashibu to preach. Although theKippōji period lasted only about a year, Dōgen, secluded from the world by heavysnow, preached and worked as energetically as ever and produced twenty-ninechapters of the Shōbōgenzō. He was unquestionably still at the height of hisliterary productivity.In the meantime, Hatano Yoshishige and other lay disciples had been engaged inthe construction of the Daibutsuji temple, to which Dōgen moved in the seventhmonth of 1244. The Dharma hall and the monastics’ hall were built in rapidsuccession, and in 1245, Dōgen announced the observance of the geango period forthe first time in the history of the new headquarters.In 1246, Dōgen changed the name of the Daibutsuji to the Eiheiji temple. “Eihei”means “eternal peace” and was the name of the era in the Later Han dynastyduring which Buddhism was said to have been introduced to China. With thisnaming, Dōgen signaled the introduction of the eternal peace of Buddhism inJapan. He had finally realized his long-cherished dream—the establishment of anideal monastic community, as envisioned by Po-chang Huai-hai (720–814), in thebosom of the mountains and waters. Echizen was an ideal place for such acommunity, for it was physically remote from Kyoto and Kamakura and thereforefree from the established Buddhism, the imperial-Fujiwara power complex, and thewarrior class. The Eiheiji temple became the symbol of the “center of the world”(axis mundi) in the religion of Dōgen and his followers.140 [notes.html#ch2_140]In the Daibutsuji-Eiheiji period (1244–53), Dōgen wrote only eight chapters ofthe Shōbōgenzō. He directed his efforts primarily to the formulation andguidance of moral precepts and disciplinary rules for the monastic community,rather than the exposition of his thought. This period was characterized by hisconcentration on the ritualization of every aspect of monastic life. He wrote,for example, the Taidaiko goge jarihō (1244), which established the sixty-tworules of behavior for junior members of the monastic community (as opposed tosenior members who received training for five years or more); the NihonkokuEchizen Eiheiji chiji shingi (1246), in which the six administrative leaderswere instructed in their treatment of inferiors (in contrast to the Taidaikogoge jarihō, which was written for monastic leaders); the Bendōhō (circa1244–46), containing minute instructions on early morning, morning, earlyevening, and evening zazen, all aspects of daily life in the monastics’ hallsuch as washing the face, wearing the robe, and sleeping; the Eiheiji jikuimmon(1246), in which Dōgen exalted the spiritual significance of preparing andtaking a meal (his instructions were permeated by his belief that eating itselfwas a spiritual matter); the Fushuku hampō (circa 1246–53), which specified inminute detail mealtime manners and rules following Dōgen’s metaphysics ofeating, in which food and Dharma were nondually one; the Kichijōzan Eiheijishuryō shingi (1249), in which Dōgen formulated the code of conduct for themonastic library, which he regarded as the center of intellectual life;141[notes.html#ch2_141] and the Eiheiji jūryo seiki (1249) in which he admonisheddisciples to not involve themselves in or cater to political and religiouspowers. Such moral and cultic formulations were derived directly from hisconception of the sanctity of every aspect of life; they were regarded as freeexpressions of Buddha-nature and not just rules and codes that bound the livesof ordinary monastics.Thus the Eiheiji monastery was an exclusive religious and educational communityof the very best seekers who had an unflinching determination to grow in thewisdom and compassion of the bodhisattva way and therein become members of thefamily tradition of the Buddhas and ancestors (busso no kafū).142[notes.html#ch2_142] This community was also designated as the community oftruth (shinjitsu-sō), the community of peace and harmony (wagō-sō), and thecommunity of purity (shōjō-sō).For about seven months between the eighth month of 1247 and the third month of1248, Dōgen preached before Hōjō Tokiyori of the Kamakura government, butdeclined his offer of property in the Echizen province.143 [notes.html#ch2_143]In light of his rejection of Yasutoki’s invitation, Dōgen’s Kamakura visit couldhave been construed as self-contradictory; his compliance was most likely due toa request from Hatano Yoshishige.144 [notes.html#ch2_144] There are differentspeculations as to what Dōgen recommended to or discussed with Tokiyori duringhis stay in Kamakura; the question is still open to further investigation.145[notes.html#ch2_145]In 1250, the ex-emperor Gosaga sent an offer to Dōgen to bestow a purple robeupon him. Dōgen declined more than once, but finally accepted on imperialinsistence. However, Dōgen did not wear the robe until the end of his life.146[notes.html#ch2_146] From about 1250 on, he suffered from ill health, and hisparticipation in monastic activities was greatly hampered. His conditionworsened around the summer of 1252. Nevertheless in the first month of 1253,Dōgen wrote the Shōbōgenzō, “Hachi-dainingaku,” which was his last message tohis disciples in anticipation of his approaching death. According to remarks byGien and Ejō, inserted at the end of this chapter, Dōgen wanted to compose atotal of one hundred chapters for the Shōbōgenzō, but was unable to. Ejō wrote:“Unfortunately we cannot see a one-hundred-chapter version. This is a matter fordeep regret.”147 [notes.html#ch2_147]In the seventh month, Dōgen appointed Ejō his successor as the head of theEiheiji monastery. Following Hatano Yoshishige’s advice, Dōgen reluctantly leftEchizen for Kyoto in the following month to seek medical care, accompanied byEjō and several other disciples. He was treated at the home of his lay discipleKakunen in Kyoto; however, his illness, perhaps aggravated by the journey, wasalready too advanced to be cured by any medical treatment.In the eighth month of 1253, Dōgen bade farewell to his grieving disciples anddied in the posture of zazen."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/ch3.jpg]toc.html#ch3IT IS OFTEN SAID that meditation and wisdom are the foot and eye of Buddhism.Wisdom is never conceived apart from meditation and vice versa. Thisinseparability is clearly stated in such statements as: “There is no meditationfor one who is without wisdom, no wisdom for one without meditation; one in whomthere are meditation and wisdom, one indeed is close to nirvāṇa,”1[notes.html#ch3_1] and “When meditation and wisdom are equal, one sees allthings.”2 [notes.html#ch3_2] No matter what the precise meanings of the two are,and no matter what their relationship is, their mutual inseparability seems todifferentiate Buddhism from the general traditions of Western philosophy andreligious thought. In fact, we may even say at the risk of oversimplificationthat the history of Buddhist thought consists of various interpretations ofmeditation and wisdom and their relationship. Thus the two serve as the primarystructural elements of the Buddhist symbolic model.3 [notes.html#ch3_3]Dōgen was no exception to this tradition. Although his thought was enormouslycomplex, subtle, and elusive, meditation and wisdom still remained thefundamental structural elements of his thought. It is for this reason that ouranalysis of these two polar concepts in the total context of Dōgen’s thought isimperative for elucidation and understanding. In this chapter, therefore, itwill be our purpose to examine this problem.THE RIGHTLY TRANSMITTED BUDDHA-DHARMA [toc.html#ch3_h2_1]As we have seen before, Dōgen studied Sōtō Zen for two years under Ju-ching, whobelonged to the Chen-hsieh line of that tradition, and he was proud of histruthful transmission of Ju-ching’s teachings to Japan. Despite his frequentharsh, sectarian attacks on Rinzai Zen, particularly Ta-hui Tsungkao and hisfollowers, and moreover despite his criticisms of other Buddhist sects andschools, we can reasonably maintain that Dōgen’s intention was not to establishany particular sect or school of Buddhism or Zen but to disseminate what hecalled the “rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma” (shōden no buppō), whichtranscended all sectarian divisions and divisiveness. The Buddha-dharma that wasrightly transmitted was neither the body of creeds, the content of certainexperiences, any Absolute, nor a return to the letter of Buddha’s teachings; itwas the symbolic expression of the spirit of Śākyamuni the Buddha, which openedup the mysteries and horizons of Buddhanature and that was the rationale forsectarian differentiations.Thus, he rejected fashionable distinctions between Zen and other Buddhistschools, that is, between the school of the Buddha-mind (busshin-shū) and theschool of the Buddha-word (butsugo-shū),4 [notes.html#ch3_4] between TathāgataZen (nyorai-shōjō-zen or nyorai-zen) and Ancestral Zen (soshi-zen),5[notes.html#ch3_5] between “Kōan-introspection” Zen (kanna-zen) and“Silent-illumination” Zen (mokushō-zen),6 [notes.html#ch3_6] and so on.His views on these matters were amply discussed and expounded in a number ofchapters of the Shōbōgenzō and other writings. First of all, Dōgen severelycriticized designations such as “Zen sect” (zenshū), “Zen ancestors” (zenso),“Zen students” (zensu), “Bodhidharma sect” (daruma-shū), and the like. They weresaid to be the “violations of the Way” and the “enemies of the Buddhas andancestors.”7 [notes.html#ch3_7] Moreover, Dōgen denounced the so-called “FiveHouses” of Chinese Zen Buddhism and repudiated Lin-chi’s “Three Mysteries andThree Essentials” (sangen-san’yō), “Four Arrangements of Subject and Object”(shiryōken), and “Fourfold Precedence and Subsequence of Light and Activity”(shishōyū). Yün-mên’s “Three Phrases” (sanku), Tung-shan’s “Five Ranks” (goi),and similar doctrines of various Zen traditions were described as “madexpressions.” He leveled criticism at each of the Five Houses, not excepting hisown Sōtō sect.8 [notes.html#ch3_8] Analogously, he considered the designation ofthe school of the Buddha-mind, in contrast to the school of the Buddha-word,preposterous and false. All these sectarian distinctions were a “grave offence”that brought “impiety” and “disgrace” to the Buddhas and ancestors, and couldultimately be traced to a lack of “seeking the Way to its roots” and of thespirit of “holding the ancients in reverence,” as well as to the “confused stateof the worldly mind.”9 [notes.html#ch3_9]When Dōgen visited China during the Southern Sung period, it was the heyday ofAncestral Zen and the method of kōan introspection under the leadership of thefollowers of Ta-hui Tsung-kao. Dōgen witnessed a number of Zen Buddhists whocategorically denounced scriptural and doctrinal studies. Ancestral Zen reachedan extreme at the time of Lin-chi I-hsüan (d. 866), Tê-shan Hsüan-chien(780–865), and Yang-shan Hui-chi (814–890), and its extremity was still quiteflagrant during Dōgen’s stay in China.10 [notes.html#ch3_10]Under such circumstances, Dōgen endeavored to go beyond an arbitrary distinctionbetween Ancestral Zen and Tathāgata Zen in order to revitalize the spirit ofBuddha himself, and advocated the necessity of studying both traditionalscriptures and records of Zen ancestors. This stand was taken in opposition tothe traditional Zen principle of “a special tradition outside the scriptures”(kyōge-betsuden), which set apart Ancestral Zen from Tathāgata Zen. At one pointDōgen wrote: “Do not misunderstand Buddhism by believing the erroneous principle‘a special tradition outside the scriptures.’ ”11 [notes.html#ch3_11] He furthernoted:The view that the sūtras are not Dharma takes into account neither the time whenthe Buddhas and ancestors used the sūtras nor the time when they left thembehind as a result of their study. It fails to recognize the degree of intimacybetween the Buddhas, ancestors, and the sūtras.12 [notes.html#ch3_12]You should tell them [those who reject the sūtras]: “If the sūtras are to bediscarded as you advocate, you should abandon the Buddha-mind and theBuddha-body as well; if you are to throw Buddha’s body-mind away, you should doso with the offspring of Buddha [all sentient beings], and in turn with theBuddha-way. In repudiating the Buddhaway, can you avoid rejecting the ancestralway?”13 [notes.html#ch3_13]“A special tradition outside the scriptures,” in Dōgen’s view, did not excludethat tradition expounded in the scriptures. Both scriptural tradition and aspecial tradition were legitimate parts of his rightly transmitted Buddhism. Ina similar fashion, he placed strictures on other Zen tenets such as “nodependence upon words and letters” (furyū-monji), “direct pointing at the humanmind” (jikishi-ninshin), and “seeing into one’s own nature and the attainment ofBuddhahood” (kenshō-jōbutsu).14 [notes.html#ch3_14]It is necessary for us to distinguish between Kōan-introspection Zen andSilent-illumination Zen at this point. As we are going to see in more detaillater, Dōgen’s “zazen-only” (shikan-taza) was closer to the Silent-illuminationZen of Sōtō Zen than to the Kōan-introspection Zen of Rinzai Zen; his criticismsof the latter were more frequent and devastating than those of the former.However, the reasons for such criticisms were based on his conception of therightly transmitted Buddha-dharma. This fact was demonstrated by his alterationof Hung-chih Chêng-chüeh’s Tso-ch’an chên (Admonitions for Zazen)—despite hiswhole-hearted admiration for this great teacher of Silent-illumination Zen inSung China.15 [notes.html#ch3_15] As Etō’s comparative analysis shows, Dōgen’sposition was clearly differentiated from Hung-chih’s in that the formeremphasized actional realization in contrast to the latter’s intuitionisticillumination.16 [notes.html#ch3_16] In short, both Kōan-introspection Zen andSilentillumination Zen were criticized by Dōgen on the basis of his criterion,the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma, which will be discussed shortly.In the same vein, Dōgen viewed both Mahāyāna Buddhism and Theravāda Buddhismfrom this vantage point, though he was not altogether free of scornful remarksabout the latter. However, he was remarkably free of the complacency and wishfulthinking typical of Mahāyānist thinkers. For example, the Four Fruits (of theTheravāda path, i.e., stream-winner, oncereturner, never-returner, and arahat),according to Dōgen, were not stages of spiritual progress, but enlightenmentitself.17 [notes.html#ch3_17] Likewise the Thirty-seven Stages to Enlightenment(saptatriṃśad bodhipākṣikā dharmāḥ; sanjūshichihon-bodaibumpō) werereinterpreted by Dōgen in such a way that they became the thirty-seven qualitiesof enlightenment—in Dōgen’s own words, “the eyeballs, nostrils,skin-flesh-bones-marrow, hands, feet, and faces of the Buddhas and ancestors.”18[notes.html#ch3_18] The arahat ideal was said to be identical in itssoteriological intention with the ideal of Buddhas and bodhisattvas, that is,supreme enlightenment (anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi).19 [notes.html#ch3_19] All inall, “There is neither Mahāyāna nor Hīnayāna in the activities of a monastic.”20[notes.html#ch3_20]In the foregoing observations, we have seen Dōgen’s endeavor, through his notionof the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma, to vindicate what he deemed the spiritof Śākyamuni Buddha himself, whom Dōgen thought was not only the historicalBuddha but the cosmic Buddha who subsumed and transcended all Buddhas. WhatDōgen attempted was not a mere return to or recapitulation of Buddha’s teachingsbut a radical reexpression and reenactment of them. As such, his notion of therightly transmitted Buddhadharma involved a thorough demythologizing andremythologizing.The question that then arises is “What is the criterion of the rightlytransmitted Buddha-dharma?” Dōgen stated:The Buddhas and Tathāgatas have an excellent way—unequalled and natural—totransmit the wondrous Dharma through personal encounter and to realize supremeenlightenment. As it is imparted impeccably from Buddha to Buddha, its criterionis the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity (jijuyū-zammai).For playing joyfully in such a samādhi (kono zammai ni yuke suruni), the uprightsitting position in meditation is the right gate.21 [notes.html#ch3_21]The samādhi of self-fulfilling activity is often used in Buddhism in contrast tothe samādhi of other-fulfilling activity (tajuyū-zammai). The former refers tothat samādhi which is concerned with the self-enjoyment of the Body of Law(dharmakāya; hosshin) without relating itself to other sentient beings, whereasthe latter refers to that samādhi which is concerned with the enjoyment andfulfillment of others through the accommodation of the Body of Law to the needsand states of sentient beings in myriad forms, such as through the Body ofEnjoyment (saṃbhogakāya; hōjin) and the Body of Transformations (nirmāṇakāya;ōjin). (Briefly, the Body of Law refers to the transcendental Buddha, beyondtime and space; the Body of Enjoyment, the mythic bodhisattvas; and the Body ofTransformations, the physical existence lived by the Buddha. This will befurther discussed at a later time.)In the context of Dōgen’s thought, the samādhi of self-fulfilling activitysignified the samādhi that at once negates and subsumes self and other—the Bodyof Law (or essence) on the one hand, and the Body of Enjoyment and the Body ofTransformations (or accommodation) on the other. It referred to a total freedomof self-realization without any dualism of antitheses. The crucially importantpoint to note is that in Dōgen, opposites or dualities were not obliterated oreven blurred; they were not so much transcended as they were realized. The totalfreedom in question here was that freedom which realized itself in duality, notapart from it.The criterion of the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity was not an abstractprinciple but a mode of activity itself. Thus Dōgen wrote, as noted previously:“A Buddhist should neither argue superiority or inferiority of doctrines, norsettle disputes over depth or shallowness of teachings, but only knowauthenticity or inauthenticity of practice.”22 [notes.html#ch3_22] Thesignificance of this statement can be adequately appreciated if seen in thecontext of the evolutionary classification of Buddhist teachings (kyōsō-hanjaku)during Dōgen’s time, or in the then-prevalent devolutionary view of history,that is, the doctrine of the Age of Degenerate Law (mappō). Dōgen rejected both,contending that the former was based on an arbitrary and complacent scheme ofdevelopmental stages of doctrines, and the latter on a faulty interpretation ofhuman nature and historical process. Instead, Dōgen found the criterion of truthand authenticity in a special quality of experience, or more accurately, ofactivity, that was epitomized in the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity.The idea of the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity was inseparable from Dōgen’sother fundamental thoughts. His conception of the rightly transmittedBuddha-dharma linked this idea with the unity of practice and enlightenment(shushō-ittō or shushō-ichinyo), the casting-off of body and mind(shinjin-datsuraku), nonthinking (hishiryō), total exertion (gūjin), abiding ina Dharma-position (jū-hōi), and so forth.From this perspective, Dōgen interpreted the entire history of Buddhism asfollows:Śākyamuni Buddha and Mahākāśyapa lived by practice based on enlightenment (shōjōno shu); Bodhidharma and Hui-nêng were likewise guided by practice based onenlightenment. There is no exception in the way Dharma has been kept alive.23[notes.html#ch3_23]One might wonder whether Dōgen was historically accurate with respect to theIndian teachers in whose view meditation seems to have been primarily, if notexclusively, a means to attain enlightenment. However, concerning ChineseBuddhism, Dōgen rightly understood the general tenor of Hui-nêng (638–713), whois often said to have reformed Chinese Zen thought. Hui-nêng maintained theunity of meditation (ting) and wisdom (hui), comparing them to “substance” and“function” or to a “lamp” and “light,” respectively.24 [notes.html#ch3_24] Herejected the contemplative and instrumental view of meditation and theintellectualistic and substantialistic view of wisdom, wherein the unity ofmeditation and wisdom was understood in terms of activity.Dōgen seriously considered thoughts such as these that were implied byHui-nêng’s teachings. Yet he severely criticized the idea of “seeing into one’sown nature” (kenshō) and went so far as to regard the Platform Sūtra as aspurious work and not the words of the sixth ancestor.25 [notes.html#ch3_25] Wecan safely conjecture that Dōgen must have read an unknown Sung edition of thiswork that might have been highly idealistically oriented (as compared with theTunhuang text, which Dōgen was unfamiliar with) and opposed to elementsassociated with the view (of Kōan-introspection Zen of the time) thatdualistically interpreted “seeing” and “one’s own nature” in the phrase “seeinginto one’s own nature.” From Dōgen’s standpoint, the activity of seeing wasitself one’s own nature.26 [notes.html#ch3_26] Be that as it may, Dōgen, anardent admirer of Hui-nêng, selected certain elements consistent with hisconception of the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma and was clearly intent onrestoring those that according to him constituted the spirit of Hui-nêng and theessence of Buddhism.Furthermore, Dōgen believed that the rightly transmitted Buddhadharma was mostauthentically transmitted by and in Ju-ching’s life and thought. That is, Dōgengeneralized an interpretation of the history and essence of Buddhism in such away that the rightly transmitted Buddhadharma was bequeathed from ŚākyamuniBuddha through Bodhidharma, Hui-nêng and his followers, to Ju-ching, and finallyto Dōgen himself. This genealogy could be traced back even to the primordialtime of the Seven Past Buddhas. To Dōgen, the search for reason (dōri)consisted, to a considerable extent, in holding the ancients in reverence(bōko). He once said: “To practice and understand the way of ancient Buddhas isto realize it [in ourselves]. They [abide] from generation to generation.Although the ‘ancient Buddha’ in question is synonymous with the ‘old’ in [theduality of ] new and old, it also transcends, yet is faithful to, the ancientand the modern.”27 [notes.html#ch3_27] Fidelity to history was the way totranscend it. Here we see Dōgen’s sense of mission in the history oftransmission of the Way, and in the traditionalism, purism, and classicism thatwere dominant elements of his thought.Dōgen’s conception of the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma has posed manycomplicated problems for students of the history of Buddhist thought,particularly regarding the relationship of his idea to Japanese Tendai Buddhismof the late Heian and early Kamakura periods and to Chinese Zen Buddhism of theSung period. I am inclined to agree with Kagamishima Genryū that Dōgen wascritical of both the view of Japanese Tendai “fideism,” which maintained thebelief in original enlightenment but denied the necessity of practice, and theview of Sung Chinese Zen, which in principle accepted practice based on originalenlightenment yet retained (even with Ju-ching, according to Kagamishima)vestiges of the dualistic view of acquired enlightenment.28 [notes.html#ch3_28]Thus Dōgen endeavored to overcome the difficulties and inconsistencies of bothJapanese and Chinese Buddhist and Zen traditions by advancing the view ofpractice based on original enlightenment—not only in principle but in fact. Thiswas a radicalization of the nonduality of practice and enlightenment in his ownversion of mystical realism, which shall be elucidated throughout this work.ZAZEN-ONLY: THE PROTOTYPE OF ULTIMATE MEANINGLESSNESS [toc.html#ch3_h2_2]The crucial importance of meditation in Buddhist tradition has been increasinglyacknowledged by many Buddhist students in recent times. Quotations from varioussources demonstrate this point: “Meditational practices constitute the very coreof the Buddhist approach to life.”29 [notes.html#ch3_29] “Meditation is thealpha and the omega of Buddhism.”30 [notes.html#ch3_30] “This acceptance ofmeditation as central to Buddhist practices is a common bond through which itmay be possible for Theravāda and Mahāyāna to grow closer together in thefuture.”31 [notes.html#ch3_31] Although meditation is the common core ofBuddhism, there are nevertheless many different conceptions and interpretationsof it, and these differences have pervaded the history of Buddhism.32[notes.html#ch3_32]Meditation or zazen, as a structural element of Dōgen’s symbolic model, has anabsolute simplicity in its form, yet is in its content impregnated withpsycho-metaphysical and ethico-religious values and meanings—the crystallizationof the creative possibilities of emptiness. More important for our purpose,however, is the idea that to Dōgen, meditation was the prototype of religiousthought and action—prototypical in the sense that it was, in its form andcontent, the compendium and paradigm of all activities (gyōji) and expressions(dōtoku). Dōgen’s zazen-only (shikan-taza) epitomized the whole body of hisreligio-philosophical and cultic-moral visions and enactments. In this respect,Dōgen’s whole works—written or otherwise—might be seen simply as footnotes onzazen-only.33 [notes.html#ch3_33]When Dōgen returned from China in 1227, he immediately promulgated the Fukanzazengi in which he attempted to correct what he felt were errors made byCh’ang-lu Tsung-che in his Ch’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei (Zen Monastic Rules) andthereby restore the spirit of the monastic ideal envisioned by Pochang Huai-hai(720–814).34 [notes.html#ch3_34] The central theme of the Fukan zazengi waszazen-only. Physically, this is no more than sitting upright in the crossleggedposture and meditating with a relaxed disposition. Dōgen instructed as follows:For the practice of zazen a quiet room is recommended, while food and drink mustbe taken in moderation. Free yourself from all attachments, and bring to restthe ten thousand things. Think of neither good nor evil and judge not right orwrong. Stop the operation of mind, will, and consciousness (shin-i-shiki); bringto an end all desires, all concepts and judgments. To sit in zazen, put down athick pillow and on top of this a second one. Thereafter one may choose either afull or half cross-legged position. In the full position (kekka-fuza), oneplaces the right foot on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh. Inthe half position (hankafuza), only the left foot is placed upon the rightthigh. Robe and belt should be worn loosely, but in order. Next, the right handrests on the left foot, while the back of the left hand rests in the palm of theright.The two thumbs are placed in juxtaposition. The body must be maintained uprightin zazen, without inclining to the left or right, forward or backward. Ears andshoulders, and nose and navel must be aligned. The tongue should be kept againstthe palate and lips and teeth firmly closed, while the eyes should always beopen. After the bodily position is in order, regulate your breathing. If athought arises, take note of it and then dismiss it. When you forget allattachments steadfastly, you will naturally become zazen itself. This is the artof zazen. Zazen is the Dharma-gate of great repose and joy.35[notes.html#ch3_35]The physical aspects of Dōgen’s zazen were almost identical with Tsungche’s.36[notes.html#ch3_36] However, in Dōgen’s thought, such a physical form wasidentified with the “whole truth of Buddhism” (buppō no zendō) or with the“right gate of Buddhism” (buppō no shōmon). Zazen for Dōgen was not one amongmany spiritual practices, but the very best of all practices; accordingly,incense burning, worship, nembutsu, confession, and recitation of the sūtraswere unnecessary.37 [notes.html#ch3_37] Dōgen’s exaltation of zazen and itsvirtues was almost ecstatic, as we can see in the following:[A meditator] passes beyond the entire universe at full speed and is greatlyhonored in the abode of the Buddhas and ancestors—[this is due to] zazen in thefull cross-legged position (kekka-fuza). Treading upon the heads of thenon-Buddhists and demons, [one] becomes an initiate (kochūnin) in the secretchamber of the Buddhas and ancestors—[because of ] zazen in the full position.This one method alone [enables the individual] to transcend the furthest boundsof the Buddhas and ancestors. This is why they are engrossed in it and nothingelse.38 [notes.html#ch3_38]Thus, zazen-only is called “the samādhi of samādhis” (ōzammai).Dōgen justified zazen-only by observing the undeniable historical fact that allthe Buddhas and ancestors attained enlightenment through this common methodalone.39 [notes.html#ch3_39] Regarding the question of why sitting alone, amongthe “four postures” of standing, walking, sitting, and lying down, was thepreferred posture for spiritual practice, Dōgen argued:We cannot fully comprehend how all the Buddhas since olden times have practicedand attained enlightenment one after another. Looking for reasons [for adoptingthe sitting posture of zazen], you should know that it has been universallyapplied by Buddhists; beyond this, no further [reasons] should be required. Theancestors have spoken highly of zazen as the Dharma-gate of repose and joy.Perhaps sitting is the most restful and balanced of the four postures. Indeed,not only one or two Buddhas, but all the Buddhas and ancestors have followed thepractice.40 [notes.html#ch3_40]For Dōgen, the historical reason that all the Buddhas and ancestors havepracticed zazen, in addition to the psycho-physical reason that it is a form ofascesis best suited for “repose and joy” (anraku), constituted justificationenough to practice zazen. Repose and joy, in this connection, were not idlesitting, but rather heightened awareness and aliveness.41 [notes.html#ch3_41]In connection with this justification, Dōgen contended that zazen was neitherone of the Threefold Way of morality, meditation, and wisdom, nor one of the SixPerfections (pāramitās) of bodhisattvahood of almsgiving, morality, patience,vigor, meditation, and wisdom.42 [notes.html#ch3_42] Zazen in Dōgen’s rightlytransmitted Buddha-dharma was zazen-only—the primordial form of Buddhistspiritual life bound to no particular school, yet from which all schools andsects were derived. The corollary of this position was to reject any practice ofzazen mixed with other practices or disciplines such as Shingon mantra or Tendaiśamatha-vipaśyanā (sikan): “Indeed, unless one concentrates on one thing, onecannot attain the one wisdom [of Buddha],”43 [notes.html#ch3_43] admonishedDōgen.Despite such arguments, Dōgen’s justification is incomplete unless the contentof zazen-only is fully expounded. As I have noted earlier, the external form ofDōgen’s zazen was not much different from Tsung-che’s; their interpretations,however, differed markedly. Dōgen carefully scrutinized those portions ofTsung-che’s document that were inconsistent with his view—for Tsung-che, thosemagical and instrumental views of zazen promoted the idea that zazen was a meansto attain magical yogic powers.44 [notes.html#ch3_44] Furthermore, Dōgencontinually refined his principles of zazen over the years so as to make themmore internally consistent.45 [notes.html#ch3_45] Dōgen also benefited fromHung-chih’s Tso-ch’an chên, whereby, as we have discussed before, he shiftedfrom the latter’s quietistic and contemplative orientation to his own actionaland realizational orientation. Dōgen’s most mature thought on zazen waspresented in the popular edition of the Fukan zazengi, “Zazengi” and “Zazenshin”of the Shōbōgenzō, and the Bendōhō.46 [notes.html#ch3_46]Dōgen’s conception of zazen-only was a reinterpretation of Chinese Zen of theSung period (along with other forms of Buddhist meditation that he studied),which had rooted out “impure” and inconsistent elements and reinforced othersgermane to his view. The net result was a radically different conception ofzazen in its content and significance. In brief, the samādhi of self-fulfillingactivity, as the criterion of the rightly transmitted Buddhadharma, meant thatthe matter of supreme importance in religion was not abstract doctrines andtheories, but rather lived experience and activity, which was crystallized inzazen-only.The content of zazen-only can be considered from various standpoints. In thefirst place, zazen-only should be construed neither as obliterating experiencesat the conscious level nor as advocating absorption in an undifferentiatedrealm. Dōgen said:Free yourself from all attachments, and bring to rest the ten thousand things.Think of neither good nor evil and judge not right or wrong. Stop the operationof mind, will, and consciousness (shin-i-shiki); bring to an end all desires,concepts, and judgments.47 [notes.html#ch3_47]It is a pity that they [those who tried to formulate the rules and principles ofzazen] spent their whole lives visiting and staying in monasteries all over thecountry, yet failed to work out a single sitting, and that their sitting wasaltogether alienated from their true selves and their efforts no longer realizedtheir true selves. The reason is not that meditators necessarily feel averse totheir body-mind but that these individuals do not truly endeavor in zazen, hencethey are precipitously intoxicated by delusion. Their formulations are examplesof merely “returning to the origin, back to the source” (gengen-hempon) and areattempts at vainly “stopping thoughts in abysmal quietude” (sokuryo-gyōjaku).48[notes.html#ch3_48]Needless to say, zazen differs from mere dreams, fantasies, reveries, orcompensatory projections, though Dōgen had something to say about these aspectsof human experience, as we shall see on a later occasion. “Dispersion” at theconscious level and “dark sinking” at the subconscious level were to be avoided,since common to both were confusion and chaos. In short, the confusion and chaosof differentiation and undifferentiation were redeemed, by which we becameliberated from the tyranny of the two for a new mode of thinking.The problem was further expounded in Dōgen’s treatment of “thinking” (shiryō),“not-thinking” (fu-shiryō), and “nonthinking” (hi-shiryō) in the story ofYüeh-shan Wêi-yen (745–828).49 [notes.html#ch3_49] Dōgen wrote:Although he is not the only one who taught thinking in the resolute state ofsitting (gotsu-gotchi no shiryō), Yüeh-shan’s way is incomparably superior. Itrefers to “thinking of not-thinking.” Thinking is the skinflesh-bones-marrow [ofzazen]; not-thinking is the skin-flesh-bonesmarrow [of zazen].The monastic said: “How do you think of not-thinking?” Notthinking, thoughindeed time-honored, can be restated as “How’s Thinking” (ikan-shiryō). Canthere be no thinking in the resolute sitting? When you advance in the resolutesitting, how can you fail to understand it? Unless you are extremelyshort-sighted, you should be able to scrutinize and have some thought on theresolute state of sitting.Great Teacher [Yüeh-shan] said: “Nonthinking.”One uses nonthinking unmistakably, and yet, to think of notthinking isnecessarily realized in and through nonthinking. There is “someone” innonthinking; this someone maintains the one [who sits in zazen]. Even though itis one’s self that sits resolutely in zazen, it is not just thinking but noneother than the totality of the resolute state of sitting itself. If the resolutestate of sitting is what it is, how can it think of itself [as its object]?Therefore, the resolute state of sitting cannot be measured by Buddhas, dharmas,enlightenment, or any human comprehension.50 [notes.html#ch3_50]Here, Dōgen spoke of the thought of resolute sitting in meditation(gotsugotchi), through which “thinking of not-thinking” was said to be realized.The function of nonthinking was not just to transcend both thinking andnotthinking, but to realize both, in the absolutely simple and singular act ofresolute sitting itself. Ultimately, there was nothing but the act of resolutesitting in meditation, which itself was the thought of resolute sitting inmeditation. In other words, nonthinking was beyond thinking and not-thinking;nonetheless it was the form—a very special form of thinking beyond thinking andnot-thinking, that is, thinking of not-thinking. Thus in Dōgen’s conception ofzazen-only, nonthinking was used not transcendentally so much asrealizationally; it was objectless, subjectless, formless, goalless, andpurposeless. But it was not void of intellectual content as in a vacuum. Whatzazen-only did was to not eliminate reason and intellect, but to realize them.Furthermore, what reason and intellect did in zazen-only was to unfold, ratherthan circumscribe, the mysteries of existence. Dōgen called this “How’sThinking.”51 [notes.html#ch3_51]In this connection, the following points must be kept in mind. First, as we havesaid regarding Dōgen’s reservation about Hung-chih, nonthinking should not beidentified with mystical contemplation or illumination. For that matter, it isneither a philosophical contemplation of eidetic forms, nor the experience ofmystical union, nor a pantheistic apprehension of the self and the world. AsDōgen untiringly emphasized, the Way is realized in and through the body.52[notes.html#ch3_52] Nonthinking has its roots firmly fixed in the most concretephysical matrix. Secondly, nonthinking is the essence of the samādhi ofself-fulfilling activity—the bliss of enlightenment that Buddha himself enjoys(jiju-hōraku) and is often referred to as joyous play (yuke or yuge). It is theactivity of homo ludens par excellence in absolute inner freedom, beingprototypical of the truth that whatever exists itself is its own raison d’être.Thirdly, thinking and not-thinking are said to be realized through emptiness,53[notes.html#ch3_53] and nonthinking is said to be right thought (shōshiyui orshōshiryō).54 [notes.html#ch3_54] Thus emptiness, nonthinking, and right thoughtwere interchangeably used by Dōgen. However, right thought here is post-logical.When, and only when, nonthinking is realized, is the authenticity of thoughtestablished. Finally, a characteristic of Dōgen’s thought was that he used anumber of interrogatives in the Sung colloquial language in order to express hisprofound metaphysical ideas such as shimo or somo (what, how, why) and otherrelated expressions. “How’s Thinking” in the previous quotation is an example.As I shall examine more fully later, these interrogatives, along with the ideaof emptiness and nonthinking, are significant in indicating that zazen for Dōgenwas ultimately the expression of an eternal quest for the meaning of existence,which was, paradoxically enough, meaningless—it was living the meaning ofultimate meaninglessness. This is Zen.55 [notes.html#ch3_55]In the second place, the content of zazen-only can be considered in terms of theunity of practice and enlightenment (shushō-ichinyo, shushō-ittō, orhonshō-myōshu). This principle is succinctly stated as follows:To think that practice and enlightenment are not one is a non-Buddhist view. Inthe Buddha-dharma they are one. Inasmuch as practice now is based onenlightenment, the practice of a beginner is itself the whole of originalenlightenment. Therefore, in giving the instruction for practice, a Zen teacheradvises his/her disciples not to seek enlightenment apart from practice, forpractice points directly to original enlightenment. Because it is the veryenlightenment of practice, there is no end to enlightenment; because it is thevery practice of enlightenment, there is no beginning to practice.56[notes.html#ch3_56]Thus, zazen-only is called “practice based on enlightenment” (shōjō no shu) incontrast to “practice prior to enlightenment” (shōzen no shu). In other words,practice is said to be “pure” and “undefiled” (fuzenna no), when it is notdefiled by the dualism of practice and enlightenment in the means-endrelationship. This is equivalent to the casting-off of the body-mind(shinjindatsuraku). The act of sitting in meditation seeks no longer to attain aspecial state of consciousness, nor to become a Buddha, and consequently iscalled the “kōan realized in life” (genjō-kōan or kōan-genjō).57[notes.html#ch3_57] The attempt to attain enlightenment through zazen, orthrough the introspection of kōan, is the “meditation of awaiting enlightenment”(taigo-zen) or “step-by-step meditation” (shūzen).The unity of practice and enlightenment does not wipe out the distinctionbetween the two; tension between them always exists, yet remains pure. Dōgenoften approvingly quoted Nan-yüeh Huai-jang’s (677–744) answer to Hui-nêng(638–713), “Practice and enlightenment are not obliterated but undefiled.”58[notes.html#ch3_58] Here we need to exercise utmost care in understanding thisstatement, which epitomizes the crux of Dōgen’s way of thinking. In Dōgen’sview, the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity in its absolute purity was suchthat our daily activities are undefiled by and unattached to the dualisticcategories, events, and things that our perceptions and intellect create, allthe while living with and using those dualities. The dualistic world remainsreal, not dissolved. Therefore, the unity in question does not replace dualitiesbut is unobstructed by them; it is post-critical, not pre-critical. Confrontedwith thought and reality, the mind is ever vigilant, deconceptualizing anddeontologizing them as circumstances demand, and thereby attaining a state ofspiritual freedom and purity.In the third place, zazen-only cannot be fully understood apart from theconsideration of faith—the element fundamentally important in Dōgen’s thought.If enlightenment is realized at the moment one sits in meditation, does thisallow some latitude for intellectual depth and spiritual progress, giveninfinite individual variations and differences? Dōgen’s answer was affirmativeand provided faith for enlightment’s deep secret. Previously, I have notedDōgen’s view that even the practice of a beginner was entirely made up oforiginal enlightenment because practice was based on enlightenment, and thatwhat matters most in religion was the authenticity of practice. Supporting sucha view were statements like the following: “The Way is the Way, all the same,whether at the time of the initial desire for enlightenment or at the time ofthe final culmination of enlightenment. At the beginning, the middle, and theend of it is equally the Way.”59 [notes.html#ch3_59] “The practice of a beginneris itself the whole of original enlightenment.”60 [notes.html#ch3_60] In statingthis, Dōgen did not imply that faith precedes enlightenment or is eventuallyreplaced by enlightenment. Throughout the ongoing advance in enlightenment(bukkōjōji), faith and enlightenment are the twin companions of emptiness andBuddha-nature.From Dōgen’s standpoint, the psychological distinction between “onceborn” and“twice-born” religious experiences (per William James) was less important;instead, he was concerned with the logical structure of the samādhi ofself-fulfilling activity, which was the criterion for spiritual authenticity.For Dōgen faith lay in original enlightenment, and enlightenment came fromoriginal faith. He wrote:It is imperative for those who practice the Way to believe in it. Those who havefaith in the Way should know for certain that they are unfailingly in the Wayfrom the very beginning—and are thus free from confusions, delusions, anddisarray, as well as from additions, subtractions, and errors. Believing in thismanner and penetrating the Way thusly, practice it accordingly. Such isfundamental to learning the Way.61 [notes.html#ch3_61]The virtue of faith [in the exposition of the “Five Virtues” of faith, vigor,mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom] is engendered neither by the self nor byothers. Because it is [generated] neither by forcing oneself nor by one’scontrivance, neither by being coerced by others nor by fitting in a self-madenorm, faith has been imparted intimately through the ancestors in India andChina. Faith is so called when the entire body becomes faith itself(konshin-jishin). Faith is one with the fruit of enlightenment; the fruit ofenlightenment is one with faith. If it is not the fruit of enlightenment, faithis not realized. On account of this, it is said [in the Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra by Nāgārjuna] that faith is the entrance to the ocean of Dharma. Indeedwhere faith is attained, there is the realization of the Buddhas andancestors.62 [notes.html#ch3_62]Faith and enlightenment are often regarded as two antithetical ideas, so much sothat Zen Buddhism can be mistakenly thought to be exclusively the religion ofenlightenment, while faith is an inferior or foreign element, or at best apreliminary step to enlightenment.63 [notes.html#ch3_63] But in Dōgen’s thought,faith and enlightenment interpenetrated one another so that without one, theother could not be fully meaningful. The inferior status of faith was repudiatedonce and for all by Dōgen; it now became for him the very core ofenlightenment.64 [notes.html#ch3_64]In the fourth and last place, zazen-only as the samādhi of self-fulfillingactivity was intimately related to the principle of “the total exertion of asingle thing” (ippō-gūjin), expressed in such favorite statements of Dōgen as“as one side is illumined, the other is darkened” (ippō o shōsuru toki wa ippōwa kurashi) and “the total experience of a single thing is one with that of allthings” (ippōtsū kore mambōtsū nari). This principle was also inseparablyassociated with another cognate principle—“to abide in a Dharma-position”(jū-hōi)—which became crucially important, especially in connection with Dōgen’sview of time. Dōgen succinctly explained “the total experience of a singlething” (ippōtsū) as follows:“The total experience of a single thing” does not deprive a thing of its ownunique particularity. It places a thing neither against others nor against none.To place a thing against none is another form of dualistic obstruction. Whentotal experience is realized unobstructedly (tsū o shite tsū no genakarashimuruni), the total experience of a single thing is the same as thetotal experience of all things. A single total experience is a single thing inits totality. The total experience of a single thing is one with that of allthings.65 [notes.html#ch3_65]An action, event, thing, or being was not chosen dualistically as an actionamong actions, an event among events, and so forth, in a causal, hierarchical,evolutionary, or means-end model, but rather nondualistically as the ultimateaction or the ultimate event, abiding in the Dharma-position of the realized nowthat was discrete from before and after. There was nothing but that particularevent, which consumed the whole universe, and ultimately even the universe wasemptied. Throughout this investigation, I shall endeavor to demonstrate howimportant this idea was in Dōgen’s thought. Suffice it to say for now thatzazen-only was prototypical of a nondualistic choice for existence at a givenmoment. Choice and nondualism were not a contradiction in terms. Herein lies thecrux of Dōgen’s mystical realism, which was neither transcendental norimmanental in the conventional fashion but realizational. Furthermore, as themodel of zazen-only itself indicates, Dōgen’s solution was intellectual as wellas cultic and actional.The content of zazen-only, as we have observed thus far in its diverse aspects,is what distinguished Dōgen’s meditation from other forms of meditation. Dōgensimplified, purified, enriched, and radicalized the content ofzazen—methodologically, metaphysically, and religiously—though his view wasgreatly influenced by Chinese and Japanese Buddhist traditions, especially thoseof Zen and Tendai. Indeed, to Dōgen zazen-only was at once metaphor and reality.CREATIVE ACTIVITIES [toc.html#ch3_h2_3]The prototype of zazen-only has two aspects: activities (gyōji) and expressions(dōtoku). As will become clearer, both are interchangeably used in Dōgen’sthought, although we shall use, purely for convenience’s sake, “activities” inconnection with cultic and moral activities, and “expressions” in relation tointellectual and philosophic endeavors. Nevertheless, expressions are expressiveactivities, and activities are active expressions. Both are the self-activitiesand self-expressions (jidōshu) of Buddha-nature.The necessity of activities was shown by Dōgen’s analyses and interpretations ofsome traditional kōan stories. There was a famous story of Nan-yüeh’s polishinga tile to make a mirror. The story runs something like this: Ma-tsu Tao-i(709–788) was practicing meditation every day. The teacher Nan-yüeh Huai-jang(677–744) happened to see him and asked: “What is your aim in practicing zazen?”“My aim is to become a Buddha,” he answered. Then the teacher picked up a tileand began to polish it on a stone in front of the hermitage where Ma-tsu hadbeen meditating. Bewildered by this strange act, Ma-tsu asked: “What is Teacherdoing?” “I am polishing this tile to make a mirror.” “How can you make a mirrorby polishing a tile?” The teacher’s reply was: “Likewise, how can you become aBuddha by practicing zazen?”66 [notes.html#ch3_66]Commenting on this story, Dōgen gave an unconventional interpretation that wascharacteristic of his treatment of other kōan stories as well. He contended thatthe story advocated not only the Zen dictum “Do not attempt to become a Buddha”(fuzu-sabutsu) but more important, the necessity of zazen undefiled. He wrote:Indeed we do know that when a tile, as it is being polished, becomes a mirror,Ma-tsu becomes a Buddha. When Ma-tsu becomes a Buddha, Ma-tsu becomes Ma-tsuinstantly. When Ma-tsu becomes Ma-tsu, zazen becomes zazen immediately.Therefore, the tradition of making a mirror by polishing a tile has been keptalive at the core of ancient Buddhas.67 [notes.html#ch3_67]In the activity of zazen undefiled, a tile and a mirror or Ma-tsu and Buddha areone, though not dissolved. Although the tile is not transformed into the mirror,the tile is the mirror; the act of polishing the tile itself unfolds the purityof the mirror. Consequently, zazen, likened to the act of polishing the tile inthis case, is nothing less than the unfolding enactment of originalenlightenment, or in other words the mirror. At one level, Dōgen affirmed theconventional interpretation of the story, but on another level, he penetratedthe matter far more deeply so as to give the story an entirely new significance.The real issue was not whether to meditate but how to meditate; the how wasobviously not a matter of technique so much as a matter of authenticity. Hencethe following observation is meaningful:Although this Dharma inheres in each of us in abundance, it does not becomevisible without practice, nor is it realized without enlightenment. If you letit go, it fills your hand; yet it transcends one and many. If you talk about it,it fills your mouth; yet it is infinite in space and time.68 [notes.html#ch3_68]Unless we take risks and choose to act, Buddha-nature never becomes visible,audible, or tangible. Prior to human (and other sentient and insentient beings’)creative activities and expressions, Buddha-nature cannot be said to exist interms of potentiality, innate endowment, and so forth.69 [notes.html#ch3_69]This is why Dōgen said: “The truth of Buddha-nature is such that Buddha-natureis embodied not before but after becoming a Buddha (jōbutsu). Buddha-nature andbecoming a Buddha always occur simultaneously.”70 [notes.html#ch3_70] Only whenwe strive to become Buddhas is Buddha-nature embodied in and through ourefforts.Another example will elucidate the matter further:Ma-ku Pao-ch’e was fanning himself one day when a monastic came and asked: “Thenature of the wind is abiding and universally present.Why do you still use your fan?”The teacher’s answer was: “You know only the nature of the wind as abiding; youdo not yet know the truth of its being universally present.”The monastic said: “What is the truth of its being universally present?”The teacher only fanned himself without a word.And the monastic saluted him.71 [notes.html#ch3_71]The monastic’s intellectual grasp of the nature of the wind ignored a cruciallyimportant point—that is, the nature of the wind is such that it cannot beconceptualized or contemplated but is instead to be actualized; furthermore, itis not potentiality being actualized, but rather actuality creating itselfthrough the act of fanning. Being a Buddha must be tested ever again by being anactive Buddha (gyōbutsu). This is precisely what Dōgen meant by saying:“Buddha-nature and becoming a Buddha always occur simultaneously.”72[notes.html#ch3_72] He also stated: “If you have attained enlightenment, youshould not halt the practice of the Way by thinking of your present state asfinal, for the Way is infinite. Exert yourself in the Way ever more, even afterenlightenment.”73 [notes.html#ch3_73]The concept of activity regarding practice and discipline was primarily areligious, rather than a philosophical one, in Dōgen’s thought. It was closelyrelated to his treatment of the traditional theories of the Buddhabody(buddhakāya; busshin)— a most representative formulation of which is theso-called Threefold Body of Buddha—and to his conception of the active Buddha.The Threefold Body of Buddha consists of the Body of Law (dharmakāya; hosshin),the Body of Enjoyment (saṃbhogakāya; hōjin), and the Body of Transformations(nirmāṇakāya; ōjin). The Body of Law is the transcendental body of Buddha, whichis utterly beyond time and space—formless, impersonal, immutable, and confinedto itself. It is designated by such words as emptiness, thusness, Dharma-nature,and so on, and apprehended by prajñā; the Body of Law is primarily the subjectof metaphysical speculation. The Body of Enjoyment refers to the “mythopoeic”body of Buddha, which enables mythic figures such as bodhisattvas to enjoy therewards of their merits and vows to save sentient beings. It is at oncetranscendental and phenomenal, at once historical and supra-historical. It isconsistent with the Mahāyāna spirit of “neither abiding in nirvāṇa nor abidingin saṃsāra” and possesses the dual nature of Buddha as both emptiness andcompassion. Amida Buddha of Pure Realm Buddhism is a classic example of the Bodyof Enjoyment. The Body of Transformations is the physical and historical body ofBuddha who lived about the sixth century B.C.E. and preached Dharma to hisdisciples. In the evolution of various theories of the Buddha-body, the Body ofEnjoyment was introduced relatively later in order to reconcile the theory oftwo Buddha-bodies, that is, the Body of Law and the Body of Transformations.74[notes.html#ch3_74] In the structure of the Buddhist experience, however, thesethree bodies represent one living reality of the Buddha-dharma.Be that as it may, it is undeniable that the traditional doctrine of theThreefold Body of Buddha has a strong tendency to relegate historical andempirical realities to a metaphysically inferior status. Thus the historicity ofthe Body of Transformations is only superficially historical, because the lifeof Śākyamuni Buddha, for example, is construed as the “appearance” of the Bodyof Law, and his conduct on this earth as “make-believe acts” to guide thedeluded sentient beings. As Sangharakshita notes, “In the system as a whole,however, Gautama the Buddha occupies a distinctly subordinate, indeed almostinsignificant position, and one is often left with the impression that theMahāyāna could now get on quite well without Him.”75 [notes.html#ch3_75] To besure, Dharma in Buddhism means always “Buddhadharma,” indicating a certainrelation to the historical Buddha; yet the latter never means theonce-and-for-all event of Person, such as the historical Jesus in Christianity,that qualitatively sets itself apart from all other historical events. ŚākyamuniBuddha is not solely the historical person who was awakened to Dharma and wasrevered as the initiator of turning the wheel of Dharma—he is also one of theinnumerable transcendental Buddhas in the three periods of past, present, andfuture and in all the realms of the universe. By and large, the predominantpropensity in Mahāyāna Buddhism has been to deemphasize or even obscure thehistoricity of Śākyamuni Buddha; its historical mooring, if any, has beentenuous, although the situation changes significantly in Theravāda Buddhism.Such a characterization of the doctrine of the Buddha-body may be construed asunfair to Mahāyāna Buddhism, but such an understanding seems to have been whatmade Dōgen unhappy with the traditional conception when he proposed his ownview.When Dōgen spoke of the pantheon of Buddhas, Tathāgatas, and bodhisattvas, hewas not too different from other Buddhists. He enjoined his disciples toreverently recite the names of the ten Buddhas every day: Birushana-butsu(Vairocana Buddha) as the Body of Law, Rushana-butsu as the Body of Enjoyment,Śākyamuni Buddha, Miroku (Maitreya), all the Buddhas in the three periods andten directions, Monju (Mañjuśrī), Fugen (Samantabhadra), Kanzeon or Kannon(Avalokiteśvara), all the bodhisattvas and mahasattvas, andMahā-prajñā-pāramitā.76 [notes.html#ch3_76] Thus Dōgen was definitely in linewith the general Buddhist tradition of emphasizing these Buddhas in speaking ofthe Buddha-dharma.However, Dōgen’s overriding emphasis was on the historical Buddha—ŚākyamuniBuddha—in whom all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas are represented as his myriadforms. Śākyamuni Buddha is a historical person—an absolutely unadulterated,concrete human being, and the same historical person is the Buddha-dharma aswell. The historical Buddha became the prototype of the Buddha-dharma in Dōgen’sthought;77 [notes.html#ch3_77] he was no longer an apparitional or assumed bodyof the Body of Law as in some interpretations of the doctrine. Dōgen rejectedthe logic of hierarchical degrees of being, and instead viewed the historicityof Buddha seriously. About this Dōgen had the following to say:Truly you should know that although Śākyamuni the person (ningen no shaka)endeavors at this moment to liberate sentient beings [on this earth], Śākyamuniof the Tuṣita Heaven (jōten no shaka) is now transforming heavens. The studentof Buddhism should understand that, while Śākyamuni the person has an infinitevariety of expressions, activities, and sermons, they constitute glowing lightsand auspicious signs in the human realm which is just one corner [of theuniverse]. Do not be foolish enough to fail to see an infinite variety ofedifying activity on the part of Śākyamuni of the Tuṣita Heaven.78[notes.html#ch3_78]Although the transcendental Buddha was talked about along with the historicalBuddha, they were no longer conceived in the traditional logic of, say, theThreefold Body of Buddha but in the logic of Dōgen’s mystical realism. InDōgen’s use of “Śākyamuni Buddha” (Shakamuni-butsu), the historical Buddha andthe transcendental Buddha were inseparably intertwined with each other.79[notes.html#ch3_79] It is also in this context that Dōgen declared the pastBuddhas the disciples of Śākyamuni Buddha80 [notes.html#ch3_80] and that all theBuddhas were necessarily Śākyamuni Buddha.81 [notes.html#ch3_81]The prototypical character of Śākyamuni Buddha as the historical and cosmicexistence of the active Buddha (gyōbutsu) was further developed and articulatedin Dōgen’s view in which activity (gyō) and Buddhahood (butsu) werenondualistically one and the same. Dōgen maintained:All the Buddhas necessarily enact venerable activities (iigi). Such is theactive Buddha. The active Buddha is not the Buddha of the Body of Enjoyment(hōbutsu), or the Buddha of the Body of Transformations (kebutsu), or the Buddhaof the Body of Law (jishōshin-butsu), or the Buddha of the other-directed Bodyof Enjoyment (tashōshin-butsu). It is neither acquired enlightenment (shikaku)nor original enlightenment (hongaku); it is neither the apprehension of one’snature nor that of emptiness. [The active Buddha is not static and contemplativeas these terms might suggest.] No Buddha—none of these Buddhas—can ever equalthe active Buddha. Note that all Buddhas active in the Way do not awaitenlightenment. The active Buddha alone is thoroughly familiar with the affairsof the realm of ongoing enlightenment. The Buddhas of the Body of Law and thelike have never dreamed of such a thing.82 [notes.html#ch3_82]One characteristic of the active Buddha is the “actual” Buddha, which differsfrom mere appearance. Dōgen equated the active Buddha with the “true human body”(shinjitsu-nintai) and maintained: “The meaning of the ‘true’ [in ‘the entireearth is the true human body’] is the actual body. You should know that theentire earth (jindaichi) is not our temporary appearance but our genuine humanbody.”83 [notes.html#ch3_83] Thus the active Buddha was actual in the sense thatit was absolutely concrete with no metaphysically inferior status attributed toit. For this reason, the active Buddha guarded against “binding one’s selfwithout a rope” (mujō-jibaku)—the victimization of the self by its own createdmental constructs, especially those of Buddha and Dharma. Dōgen offered thefollowing warning on the “bonds of Buddha” (butsubaku) and the “bonds of Dharma”(hō-baku):Unless you are the active Buddha, you will never be liberated from the bonds ofBuddha and the bonds of Dharma and will be entangled with the demons of Buddha(butsuma) and the demons of Dharma (hōma).The “bonds of Buddha” means to understand enlightenment abstractly and hence tobe bound by intellectual views and theoretical understanding.… This is likenedto binding one’s self without a rope. The rope, so long without a break, is likethe vines that entwine a tree to its death, or like living vainly in the cave ofthe conceptual Buddha. Humans do not know that the Body of Law is diseased andthe Body of Enjoyment is troubled. Those scholars of doctrines, sūtras, andśāstras, who heard the Way from a distance, even say that an intellectual viewof Dharma-nature arises in Dharma-nature itself, and that this is due toignorance. When they speak of an abstract thinking of Dharma-nature occurring inDharma-nature, they do not attribute this to the bonds of Dharma-nature, butinstead, they pile the bonds of ignorance on top of them. They are not aware ofthe existence of the bonds of Dharma-nature. Although they are pitiful on thisaccount, they realize the bonds of ignorance having piled up, and thisrealization works as a seed for the aspiration for enlightenment. The activeBuddha has never been bound by such bonds.84 [notes.html#ch3_84]While Buddha and Dharma were conventionally thought to be liberating forces thatwere unchallenged and unchallengeable, Dōgen recognized the fact that they couldbecome bonds as dangerous and sinister as the bonds of ignorance. Although Dōgenfrequently used the traditional terms of the Threefold Body doctrine and relatedideas in his writings, they were used in the context of his advocacy of theactive Buddha, which was actual in an unadulterated historical concreteness andfree of monistic vestiges. When Dōgen referred to the historical Buddha and theeternal Buddha, he meant the active Buddha.The conception of the active Buddha expanded to cosmic dimensions in Dōgen’sview. “Buddha’s activities take place with the entire earth and with allsentient beings. If they are not with all existences, they are not yet theactivities of Buddha.”85 [notes.html#ch3_85] “An infinite number of Buddhasreside in a speck of dust.”86 [notes.html#ch3_86] The active Buddha was theBuddha of the three periods and the ten directions;87 [notes.html#ch3_87] inshort, Buddhas abounded spatially and temporally. Dōgen further wrote:Do not measure or judge the great Way [the active Buddha] in terms of thequantity of Buddhas [the Threefold Body of Buddha]. For the latter is a part ofthe former; it is like a flower blooming in the spring. Do not grope for ordeliberate on the venerable demeanor of the active Buddha with the capacity ofthe mind. The latter is a facet of the former. It is likened to the world: Ablade of grass is undoubtedly the mind of the Buddhas and ancestors; it is apiece imprinted by the traces of the active Buddha. Although the capacity of themind is regarded as embodying an infinite quantity of Buddhas, to appreciate theforms and movements of the active Buddha would be indeed far more than it iscapable of. Since the active Buddha cannot be fathomed by amount, it isimmeasurable, inexhaustible, and transcends any number.88 [notes.html#ch3_88]The “venerable demeanor” (iigi) of the active Buddha permeated the universe.Dōgen’s mythopoeic imagination described it as thus:Where the active Buddha is engaged in transformative activities, there aresentient beings other than those born of the four forms of life [from eggs, froma womb, from moisture, and from metamorphosis]. There are places other than theheavenly and human worlds and the common universe. Do not use the eyes and thestandards of the heavenly and human beings. You should not attempt to speculateby employing them. Even the bodhisattvas at the various stages of perfection donot fully comprehend [the active Buddha’s transformative activities], not tomention the comprehension that human and heavenly beings are capable ofattaining. Since human stature is low, what we understand is also slight; sincehuman life is brief, what we think is also shallow. How then can we comprehendthe venerable demeanor of the active Buddha?89 [notes.html#ch3_89]And:The venerable demeanor of the active Buddha now is perfectly free, and isnothing but being Buddha through and through. Because it has passed through thepath of freedom that is covered with mud and submerged in water [i.e., thebodhisattva-way], it is unobstructed. In the heavenly world it transforms theheavenly beings; in the human world, humans. While it has the power by virtue ofwhich a flower blooms, it has also the power by virtue of which the worldarises. There is no hiatus between them [the flower and the world].… In greatenlightenment it is nothing but great enlightenment; in great delusion it isnothing but great delusion. These activities merely constitute a movement of theactive Buddha’s toes in the sandals. Sometimes it is the sound of breaking wind;sometimes it is the smell of urination. Those who have the nostrils smell it;those who have the ears, the bodies, and the willingness to act, hear it.90[notes.html#ch3_90]The venerable movement of the active Buddha reached not only the heavenly worldsand beyond, but also affected such trivial things as breaking wind andurination.In the foregoing, I have endeavored to show that in Dōgen’s thought thehistorical and transcendental Buddhas were focalized in the active Buddha andthat the latter, in turn, was identified with the historical existence ofhumanity in which activity and Buddhahood were undefiled in spiritual freedom.We see here considerable similarities between Dōgen and Tantric Buddhism as faras their views of the Buddha-body are concerned.91 [notes.html#ch3_91] Dōgenrestored the fundamental significance of the historical Buddha and provided itsexistential and soteriological significance for those who practiced zazenonly inthe samādhi of self-fulfilling activity (jijuyū-zammai). Such was the religiouscontext in which his view of activity was developed.Thus the fundamental characteristic of Zen was reformulated so that the effortsto become a Buddha (jōbutsu) were now seen in light of the postenlightenmentactivity of Buddha (gyō-butsu).Like expression (dōtoku), activity (gyōji) was a primitive concept in Dōgen’sthought. It was so crucially important that Dōgen claimed that the authenticityor inauthenticity of practice, that is, of activity—rather than the superiorityor inferiority of doctrine, or the profundity or shallowness of teaching—was thesine qua non of Buddhist truth.92 [notes.html#ch3_92] The metaphysicalprimitiveness of activity was well maintained as follows:The sun, the moon, and the stars exist by virtue of such creative activities.The earth and the empty sky exist because of activities. Our bodymind and itsenvironment are dependent on activities; so are the four elements and the fiveskandhas. Although activity is not what worldly people are likely to care for,it is every human’s only true refuge.… It should be examined and understoodthoroughly that dependent origination (engi) is activity, because activity doesnot originate dependently. That activity which realizes those activities—it isour activity now (wareraga imano gyōji nari). The now of activity (gyōji no ima)is not the self’s primordial being, eternal and immutable, nor is it somethingthat enters and leaves the self. The Way, called now, does not precede activity;as activity is realized (gyōji genjō suru), it is called now.93[notes.html#ch3_93]As is quite explicit, Dōgen dared to go beyond traditional Buddhist thought, byconstruing activity as more primitive than dependent origination and by sayingthat dependent origination was activity, but that the reverse was not the case.Literally interpreted, this statement may be criticized as a substantializationof activity as an entity in itself; on the other hand, it is too straightforwardto be taken as mere rhetorical emphasis on activity. Despite our difficulty infathoming Dōgen’s intention, his statement deepens our understanding ofdependent origination whose conditions and causes are now translated in terms ofactivities.94 [notes.html#ch3_94] It highlights not the prior existence ofindependent entities that then become functionally interdependent on oneanother, but precisely the denial of such a view. Activity is the primalproperty of dependent origination itself. In brief, this was Dōgen’s way ofmaintaining the emptiness of dependent origination and the dependent originationof emptiness.The dynamic ongoing movement of activity was envisioned in Dōgen’s idea of“perpetuation of the Way through activity” (gyōji-dōkan):The great Way of the Buddhas and ancestors always consists in these supremeactivities (mujō no gyōji): the desire for enlightenment, practice,enlightenment, and nirvāṇa. These four activities are never interrupted in theircontinuation and never allow even a single interval between them. This is theperpetuation of the Way through activity (gyōji-dōkan). Consequently, supremeactivity is neither a contrivance of the self nor that of others; it is activityundefiled. The power of such an activity sustains my self and others. Its importis such that all the heavens and the entire earth in the ten directions enjoythe merit of my activity. Even if neither the self nor others are aware of it,such is the case.95 [notes.html#ch3_95]The perpetuation of the Way through activity consists of a succession of“circles” of time, each of which has a circumference ever moving without limits,a center ever movable in accordance with circumstances, and a path without anultimate goal or purpose—although it is not without inner reason (dōri).In these ongoing endeavors, activity and expression are such that when activityis totally exerted, there is nothing but activity, and similarly, whenexpression is totally exerted, there is nothing but expression. Thus, “whileactivity (gyō) fathoms the way to be in unison with expression (setsu),expression has the path to be attuned with activity.”96 [notes.html#ch3_96]After all, humanity “enacts that which is impossible to enact” (gyōfutokutei)and “expresses that which is impossible to express” (setsufutokutei).97[notes.html#ch3_97]CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS [toc.html#ch3_h2_4]The problem of expression emerges in Dōgen’s thought primarily in connectionwith two different yet mutually related problems: Zen treatment of Buddhistscriptures and the method of kōan meditation. Let us examine them briefly beforewe discuss the problem of expression.As has been previously observed, the principle of “no dependence upon words andletters (furyū-monji)” should not mean abandoning the use of language, butrather, using it to our advantage instead of being victimized by it. Dōgenseverely criticized those Zen Buddhists who cherished only the records of Zenancestors at the sacrifice of traditional Buddhist scriptures. According toDōgen, they fell into the dire fallacy of negating language entirely by havinghad an over-zealous reaction to the scholastic, doctrinaire tendencies of theschool of the Buddha-word (butsugo-shū). Dōgen opposed this violently. He wrote:“Hearing and seeing (shōshiki) should not be regarded as more meritorious thanreading the sūtras. It is hearing and seeing that delude you, yet you crave andindulge in them. The sūtras do not bewilder you; do not slander [them] inunbelief.”98 [notes.html#ch3_98]Here we see that it is we who deceive ourselves—the sūtras do not deceive us.The root of the trouble in dealing with the sūtras consists not so much in thesūtras themselves as in our subjectivity. Hence, Dōgen maintained with Hui-nêngthat the mind in delusion was moved by the Saddharmapuṇḍarīka sūtra, whereas themind in enlightenment moved it.99 [notes.html#ch3_99] The enlightened mind wasfree to elucidate and appropriate the sūtras.The sūtras in Dōgen’s conception were the entire universe itself. Dōgenexpounded this view in a number of places:What we mean by the sūtras is the entire universe itself. There is no space nortime which is not the sūtras. They use the words and letters of the ultimatetruth as well as the words and letters of the worldly truth. They adopt thesymbols of heavenly beings as well as those of human beings. They use the wordsand letters of beasts and asuras as well as those of hundreds of grasses andthousands of trees. For this reason, the long and short, the square and round,the blue and yellow, the red and white—marshalling solemnly in the tendirections of the universe—are undeniably the sūtras’ words and letters andfaces. They are the instruments of the great Way and the scriptures for aBuddhist.100 [notes.html#ch3_100]When you devote yourself to the study of the sūtras, they truly come forth. Thesūtras in question are the entire universe, mountains, rivers, and the greatearth, plants and trees; they are the self and others, taking meals and wearingclothes, confusion and dignity. By following and studying each of them, you willsee an infinite number of the hitherto unheard-of sūtras appear before you.101[notes.html#ch3_101]Furthermore, “boundless words and letters (kōdai no monji) permeate the universewith overflowing abundance.”102 [notes.html#ch3_102] The entire spatio-temporalreality constituted the sūtras, as these quotations amply show. Humanity wasborn into the sūtras and will return to the sūtras. As soon as one is born intothe world, one inescapably meets the sūtras and life thereafter consists inefforts to decipher their meanings: “From aeon to aeon, from day to night, thereis not even a single instant when the sūtras are not recited or meditated, eventhough they are not actually expounded.”103 [notes.html#ch3_103] On the otherhand, the sūtras are identical with Dharma in which the “eighty-four thousandteachings” are stored and also with the treasury of the true Dharma eye(shōbōgenzō).104 [notes.html#ch3_104]In his pietistic moments, Dōgen held that the sūtras are the same as thebody-mind of the Buddhas and ancestors:Therefore the sūtras are the whole body of Tathāgata. To revere the sūtras is torevere Tathāgata, and to meet the sūtras is to meet Tathāgata. The sūtras areTathāgata’s bones; hence the bones are these sūtras. If you know the sūtras arethe bones but do not understand the bones are the sūtras, it is not yet the Way.All-things-themselves-are-ultimate-reality (shohō-jossō) here and nowconstitutes the sūtras. The human world and the heavenly world, the oceans andthe empty sky, this world and other worlds—all are neither more nor less thanultimate reality, the sūtras, and the bones.105 [notes.html#ch3_105]“Now we are born to meet these sūtras,” said Dōgen, “how can we fail to rejoicein encountering Śākyamuni Buddha?”106 [notes.html#ch3_106] It is in this sensethat Dōgen admonished his disciples to study the sūtras assiduously:An enlightened teacher is always thoroughly versed in the sūtras. “To bethoroughly versed” means to make the sūtras countries and lands, bodies andminds. The sūtras are made the instruments for liberating others and are turnedinto sitting, resting, and walking in meditation. Being thoroughly versedchanges the sūtras into parents, children, and grandchildren. Because anenlightened teacher understands the sūtras through practice (gyōge), he/shepenetrates them deeply.107 [notes.html#ch3_107]Thus, the conventional sense of the sūtras, while acknowledged for itsimportance, was placed against the cosmic context in which it comprised only asmall portion of the whole sūtras. To Dōgen, life was an incessant round ofhermeneutical activities aimed at trying to understand such cosmic sūtras. Dōgenoften criticized what he called the “scholars who count words and letters” andcompared them to the “blind guiding the masses of the blind.”108[notes.html#ch3_108] Furthermore, Dōgen admonished his disciples that “In themonastics’ hall you should not look at words and letters even though they are inZen books.”109 [notes.html#ch3_109] These typically Zen Buddhist remarks—notinfrequently made by Dōgen—should nevertheless not obscure Dōgen’s realintention concerning language and symbols, which were dynamic and alive, at thevery core of life.A brief historical digression may be worthwhile to assess the significance ofDōgen’s position in the foregoing matter. When Dōgen spoke of the sūtras, he hada specifically Zen Buddhist situation in mind, in which some maintained the solelegitimacy of the ancestral records as “a special tradition outside the sūtras”(kyōge-betsuden)—another Zen principle cognate to “no dependence upon words andletters.” The dictum insisted upon this special corpus of ancestral records asopposed to the sūtra tradition of other schools, and in turn rationalized suchdistinctions as those between Ancestral Zen and Tathāgata Zen, between theschool of the Buddha-mind and the school of the Buddha-word, and so forth.Despite its historical significance in enunciating a distinctively Zen Buddhistidentity in its formative period, this principle seems to have been fanaticallyexaggerated among some Zen Buddhists toward the close of the T’ang period andlater through the Sung period. Historians today generally think that Lin-chiI-hsüan (d. 850), Tê-shan Hsüanchien (780–865), and Yang-shan Hui-chi (807–883)were mainly responsible for this extremist predilection within Zen Buddhism.110[notes.html#ch3_110] The literalistic, dogmatic interpreters of these twoprinciples went so far as to burn the sūtras and images as they considered themspiritually harmful.This extremist tradition was bequeathed to the so-called Kōan-introspection Zenand Silent-illumination Zen of the Sung period. Especially during the SouthernSung period, when Dōgen studied in China, the sectarian struggle between thesetwo camps was even more belligerent than it had been during previousgenerations. The rejection of the sūtras notwithstanding, kōan meditationgradually became the Zen equivalent of sūtra studies, as we shall see on a lateroccasion—hence, there was quite an intimate relationship between sūtras andkōans.The historical connection between Kōan-introspection Zen and kōan itself must beviewed in a proper historical context. Although the origins of kōan in itstechnical Zen sense are obscure, it appears to have been first used by Mu-chouTao-tsung (780?–877?), popularly known by his followers as Ch’ên Tsun-su, asevents of enlightenment in the sense of present living and lived realities oflife—as the realization of truth itself. This was the kōan realized in life(genjō-kōan), which may have been what many Zen teachers employed for theguidance of disciples during the T’ang period.111 [notes.html#ch3_111] Kōan, asparadigmatic problems for meditation that are neatly packaged in formulizedstatements, is called the kōan of ancient paradigms (kosoku-kōan). This formgradually developed, probably around the end of the tenth century, and theprocess of fixation was augmented thereafter by counterattacks from the camps ofthose who advocated the classical conception of kōan, such as ShihshuangCh’u-yüan (986–1039), Hsüeh-tou Ch’ung-hsien (980–1052), Wutsu Fa-yen(1024?–1104), Yüan-wu K’o-ch’in (1063–1135). Especially, Yüan-wu emphasized thekōan realized in life, by referring to it frequently, despite his advocacy ofthe kōan of ancient paradigms.This tradition of the kōan realized in life was also inherited by both TahuiTsung-kao (1089–1163), the foremost leader of Kōan-introspection Zen, andHung-chih Chêng-chüeh (1091–1157), the celebrated exponent of SilentilluminationZen, who, though often regarded as fierce enemies, were evidently good friends.They advocated the kōan realized in life and never absolutized either kōan orzazen at the expense of the other.112 [notes.html#ch3_112] Their concern was toremind us of the dangers of misuses and abuses of these methods that couldultimately lead to dark quietism and deadly intellectualism. The real issue,therefore, was not so much whether or not to use kōan or zazen but how to usethem.Against this historical background, Dōgen emphasized genjō-kōan of classical ZenBuddhism and seems to have recognized the limited values of kosoku-kōan withinthat context.113 [notes.html#ch3_113] Although Dōgen adopted the idea ofgenjō-kōan from the Chinese Zen tradition,114 [notes.html#ch3_114] he developedthe idea further and used it extensively throughout his works.115[notes.html#ch3_115] He also fully used the linguistic and symbolicpotentialities of the component words “kōan” and “realization” (genjō). FromDōgen’s standpoint, the traditional kōan of the ancient paradigm: (1) was basedupon the idea of kōan as a means to attain enlightenment and consequently, onthe idea of enlightenment as realizable in the future (taigo), (2) had a strongpredilection for an intellectual and intuitive “seeing into one’s own nature”(kenshō) as if “seeing” and “nature” were two different phenomena, and (3)perhaps most importantly for our purpose in the present context, observed aninherent irrationality in the traditional kōan.In this view, the mind, confronted with kōans, or formulized nonsense, wassystematically frustrated in its intellectual functions, and finallydeconditioned so as to permit the release of the primitive psychic forceshitherto pent up in it, which was necessary for the experience ofenlightenment.116 [notes.html#ch3_116] Such an instrumental view of kōan wasclosely related to the corollary view of reason in general and of language andsymbols in particular, which was by and large negativistic. Dōgen’s method, onthe other hand, was to carefully and compassionately pursue the reason ofnonsense, for kōans were not just ordinary nonsense or meaningless expressions,but symbols of life and death. As such, reason was not just abnegated, butreconstituted, in the wider context of enlightenment. To Dōgen, kōans functionednot only as nonsense that castigated reason, but as parables, allegories, andmysteries that unfolded the horizons of existence before us. In this sense theywere realized, though not solved.The upshot of what we have thus far examined is a strikingly new way of lookingat conventional ideas such as sūtras and kōans. Dōgen liberated them from thenarrow confines of traditional, especially Zen Buddhist, understanding, whichmore often than not tended to view them as nothing but instruments or means toattain enlightment. This meant that words and letters (i.e., language andsymbols)—the common components of sūtras and kōans—were given a positivesignificance in the total scheme of spiritual things. They were no longer ameans to an end but, rather, a means that embodied the end within. Referring tothe traditional story of when Buddha silently held up a flower one day before acongregation on Mt. Gṛdhrakūṭa, and Mahākāśyapa alone, laughing, understood it,Dōgen attacked those who regarded the absence of the Buddha’s utterance assupreme evidence of the profundity of truth. He then proposed his own view:If Buddha’s utterance is shallow, his holding up a flower and blinking without aword must also be superficial. When you say that Buddha’s utterance is merenames and forms (myōsō), you do not understand the Buddha-dharma. Although youknow that the utterance is words and letters, you do not yet discern that thereare no mere words and forms with Buddha. This is due to the deluded state of theordinary mind. To the Buddhas and ancestors, the whole being of body and mind iscast off and constitutes sermons, discourses through utterances, and the turningof the wheel of Dharma.117 [notes.html#ch3_117]Buddha’s holding up a flower in silence was his “speech” or expression. Thesūtras, words, and silence—even an infant’s mumblings, the alcoholic’s “snakes,”and whatnot—were all the possibilities of expression that were in turn theactivities of emptiness and Buddha-nature. To study them was to study the“reason of words and letters” (monji no dōri). Dōgen’s view was neither aderogation nor an idolization of language, but simply an acknowledgement of thelegitimate place of language in the spiritual scheme of things. For this reasonDōgen’s emphasis was not on how to transcend language, but on how to radicallyuse it.Language is not just that which describes and explains the state of affairs,detached from the operation of the human mind; it is not isolatable, at least inprinciple, from the mind and its environs. Rather, language performs its variousfunctions within the very texture of the mind and the situation in which themind is located. It is embedded in the matrix of our whole experience; asWittgenstein once said: “The speaking of language is part of an activity, or ofa form of life.”118 [notes.html#ch3_118] The range of the functions of language(in its broadest possible sense as Dōgen understood it) became coextensive withthat of human activities. For Dōgen the false separation of words and activitieswas closely related to the impoverishment of religion and philosophy; languageand activity were inseparably one in his thought, as we shall soon see.Dōgen’s view of expression (dōtoku) exemplified his dynamic view of language andsymbols and his originality. Dōtoku consists of two Chinese characters: dō, “theWay” and “to say,” and toku, “to attain” and “to be able.” Thus it signifiesboth actuality and possibility of expression—in other words, expression andexpressibility. What is expressed intimates what is yet to be expressed—it isthe Way. It also implies the understanding and grasping of the Way byexpression. Furthermore, it stresses not what humans express so much as what theWay expresses. These complex, pregnant meanings are implied in the word dōtoku.The word was by no means Dōgen’s invention—as a matter of fact, it wasfrequently used, yet perhaps neglected, by Zen Buddhists. Dōgen rediscovered itand made it a central concept in his thought.For Dōgen, expression did not necessarily mean expression in words: “Thewordless (fugen) is not the same as the expressionless (fudō), for expression(dōtoku) is not identical with an utterance in words (gentoku).”119[notes.html#ch3_119] This is the fundamental difference between expression andsaying (gentoku). Without words and letters, we can express ourselves in myriadways. Comparing the life of the monastic’s silent zazen to that of the deaf,Dōgen wrote:Even deaf-mutes have expressions. Do not judge that they cannot haveexpressions. Those who create expressions are not necessarily limited to thosewho are not deaf-mutes, for deaf-mutes do express themselves. Their voicesshould be heard and their utterances should be heeded. Unless you identifyyourself with them, how can you meet them? How can you talk with them?120[notes.html#ch3_120]From this the following admonition is given: “Do not loathe wordlessness, for itis expression par excellence.”121 [notes.html#ch3_121] Regarding the problem ofexpression, Dōgen guided us to not only take into consideration semanticpossibilities in metaphors, images, gestures, and moral and aesthetic activitiesin the human realm, but also those possibilities in the activities of nonhumanand nonliving realms. Thus he said:You should not think that the way insentient beings expound Dharma isnecessarily like the way sentient beings expound Dharma. If you assume that[insentient beings] should be like sentient beings in their voices and the waythey expound Dharma, and thereby, conjecture the voices of insentient beings interms of those of sentient beings, that is contrary to the Buddha-way.… Eventhough humans construe what they now consider to be grasses and plants as theinsentient, those grasses and plants, too, cannot be fully fathomed by theordinary mind.122 [notes.html#ch3_122]Following this view, all phenomena in the universe—visible and invisible,audible and inaudible, tangible and intangible, conscious and unconscious—werethe self-expressions (jidōshu) of Buddha-nature and emptiness. Nothing wasexcluded from this.123 [notes.html#ch3_123]In order to develop his metaphysic of expression, Dōgen employed a number ofconcepts and symbols taken from the repository of the Buddhist tradition—some ofwhich were quite ordinary, others of which had been relegated to oblivion, whilestill others had been denigrated. He resuscitated them with new life and gavethem astonishingly fresh and revelatory possibilities of meaning. Some examplesof this were: dreams (mu), entwined vines (kattō), pictures (gato), streamsounds, mountain sights (keisei-sanshoku), one luminous pearl (ikka-myōju), theprimordial mirror (kokyō), the sky-flowers (kūge), light (kōmyō), plum blossoms(baika), the udumbara flower (udonge), dragon song (ryūgin), a particular time(arutoki), supranormal powers (jinzū), pilgrimage (hensan), spells (darani), themountains and waters (sansui). These notions, metaphors, and images weretransfigured and given completely new significance, so as to be legitimized asthe philosophic and mythopoeic elements of Dōgen’s thought. We see this, forinstance, in the transformation of the “sky-flowers” (which traditionally meantillusory perceptions) into the “flowers of emptiness.” We will examine thisexample and others in more detail presently. The point to note at this junctureis that such exploration and use of symbols was an integral part of Dōgen’sphilosophic and religious method. (His versatility in and sensitivity to the useof language and expression were well attested to by many Dōgen students. Asnoted before, Dōgen’s sensibilities had undoubtedly derived from thedistinguished poetic and literary traditions of his aristocratic family,although he was more concerned with philosophic and religious problems than withaesthetic ones.)The problem of the symbol and the symbolized is very important in Buddhistthought as in any other philosophical and religious belief system. The former inBuddhism is often designated by metaphors (hiyu), provisional view (kesetsu),provisional name (kemyō), and so forth, whereas the latter (the symbolized) isdesignated by thusness (shinnyo), emptiness (kū), Buddha-nature (busshō), andthe like. Metaphors, parables, and names constitute what the Buddhists callskillful means (upāya; hōben) which enable sentient beings to cross the river ofbirth-and-death to the other shore (pāramitā; higan) of ultimate reality. Thisview strongly suggests the instrumentality of symbol that must be transcended inorder to attain truth.To be sure, Dōgen vehemently attacked those who were entrapped and victimized bythe words and doctrines they themselves created; he abhorred a deadlyliteralism. And yet for him, symbol was to be realized as an expression of thesymbolized. This was possible only when symbol was mediated, liberated, andreinstated by the symbolized. Here we see Dōgen’s creative and dynamicinterpretation of the Buddhist doctrine of skillful means in which the means inquestion was not for the transcendence of duality so much as it was for therealization of it. The means and the end were not obliterated but undefiled.Thus, the motif of realization, rather than that of transcendence, was the keymotivating force in Dōgen’s thought about language and symbols, as in otheraspects of his philosophy.124 [notes.html#ch3_124] This was clearly shown inDōgen’s analysis of the moon reflected on the water:Śākyamuni Buddha said: “The true Dharma-body of Buddha is like the empty sky,and it manifests itself according to sentient beings like the moon [reflected]on the water.” The “like” in “like the moon [reflected] on the water” shouldmean the water-moon (sui-getsu) [i.e., the nonduality of the moon and thewater]. It should be the water-thusness (sui-nyo), the moon-thusness(getsu-nyo), thusness-on (nyo-chū), and on- thusness (chū-nyo). We are notconstruing “like” as resemblance: “like” (nyo) is “thusness” (ze).125[notes.html#ch3_125]Quite an ordinary statement of Buddha’s (as translated above in itscommon-sensical rendering) is transformed suddenly into a profound discourse onthe symbol and the symbolized, by making full use of semantic possibilities ofthe Chinese characters involved in it. The central character nyo means“likeness” and “thusness” simultaneously. Similarly nyo-ze means “like this” aswell as “thusness.” Dōgen astutely utilized the significant implications ofthese words. But his deeper underlying motive was thoroughly religious andphilosophical—a profound insight into the metaphysic of symbol. Often the symboland the symbolized are related to each other in terms of a certain likeness; thesymbol is said to “point to,” “represent,” or “approximate” the symbolized.Rejecting such a dualism, Dōgen contended that “like this” (nyoze) meant thatboth “like” and “this” were emptiness and hence thusness (nyoze). Instead ofsaying, “Thusness is like this,” he said: “ ‘Like this’ is thusness.” “Likethis” did not represent or point to thusness but was thusness. Therefore thesymbol was the symbolized.By articulating the problem in this manner, Dōgen did not engage in theabsolutization of the symbol or in the relativization of the symbolized, whichwould have been dualistic. What he did in effect was to show how we can use thesymbol in such a way that it becomes the total realization (zenki) or presence(genzen) of the symbolized. Dōgen’s view can be best understood in thesoteriological context of his mystical realism. This is why Dōgen held: “TheBuddha-dharma, even in figures of speech (hiyu), is ultimate reality(jissō).”126 [notes.html#ch3_126]The foregoing observations point to the fact that there is no metaphysical orexperiential hiatus between the symbol and the symbolized. This becomes clearerwhen we examine Dōgen’s discussion of “intimate words” (mitsugo). Employing thecombination of the two meanings, “intimacy” and “hiddenness,” in the Chinesecharacter mitsu, Dōgen advanced an ingenious view of mystery. Mitsugo isordinarily understood as “secret words” or “hidden words,” the secrecy orhiddenness of which can be removed by extensive learning, supernormal faculties,and the like. In opposition to this interpretation Dōgen said:The mitsu in question means intimacy (shimmitsu) and the absence of distance.[When you speak of the Buddhas and ancestors], the Buddhas and ancestors embraceeverything; [likewise] you embrace everything and I embrace everything. Practiceincludes all, a generation includes all, and intimacy includes all.127[notes.html#ch3_127]Intimate words were those spoken and acted out by us in such a way that therewas no hiatus between words and referents, thought and reality, mind and body,and expressions and activities. When a symbol was used in such a nondualisticmanner, it was totally intimate with and transparent to the symbolized. In asimilar fashion, such words as “intimate activities” (mitsugyō), “intimateenlightenment” (misshō), “intimate thought” (mitsui), were used. Mystery, inDōgen’s view, did not consist of that which was hidden or unknown in darkness orthat which would be revealed or made known in the future. Rather, it consistedof the present intimacy, transparency, and vividness of thusness, for “nothingthroughout the entire universe is concealed” (henkai-fuzōzō). Nevertheless, themystery of emptiness and thusness had to go beyond this: intimacy had to be everpenetrated (tōkamitsu).128 [notes.html#ch3_128]In the same vein, Dōgen held that “going beyond Buddha” (bukkōjōji)—discussed inconnection with Tung-shan Liang-chieh’s discourse on ongoing enlightenment andspeech—was realized by penetrating the inaudible in speech through practice andunderstanding.129 [notes.html#ch3_129] Dōgen observed:You should correctly understand that going beyond Buddha does not depend on anycauses or their fruition. Even so, you experience and penetrate the inaudiblewhen words are uttered (gowaji no fumon). Unless you reach beyond Buddha, thereis no experience of being beyond Buddha. If going beyond Buddha is not utteredin speech (gowa), you do not experience it. [Speech and going beyond Buddha] areneither manifest in nor hidden from each other; they neither give nor take intheir relationship. Therefore, when speech is realized, that itself is noneother than going beyond Buddha.130 [notes.html#ch3_130]The inaudible in speech transcends the audible (mon) and the inaudible (fumon)in the conventional sense. The body-mind must adjust itself—by beingundefiled—to the inaudible through a new mode of activity. No sooner have wetotally adjusted our body-mind to a new situation and begun to act in andthrough the audible than we realize that the inaudible resides in the audibleitself. Thus, speech is undefiled by the dualism of the audible and theinaudible. Or to put it differently, speaker and speech are nondualistically onein that activity which goes beyond Buddha.131 [notes.html#ch3_131] Dōgencontinued:You must clearly study our founder Tung-shan’s saying, “I await the time when Ido not speak (fugowa) and then hear [speech uttered] immediately.” When speechis uttered ordinarily, there is no immediate hearing (sokumon) at all.“Hearing-immediately” is realized at the time of “no speech.” But it does notmean that you set aside a special occasion for awaiting no-speech needlessly, orthat, at the time of hearingimmediately, you construe speech (gowa) as anonlooker [as if speech and hearing-immediately were dualistically separated];for the true looking-on lies in the very hearing-immediately. At the time ofhearing immediately, speech is not removed from its own place to anotherlocation. At the time of speech, hearing-immediately does not resound afterbeing hidden in the bosom of speech. For these reasons, the monastic [whoappears in the story of Tung-shan’s discourse] does not hear at the time ofspeech, and Tung-shan hears immediately on the occasion of no-speech. This is[the meaning of Tung-shan’s] “You can speak of [going beyond Buddha] a little”and “You can experience going beyond Buddha.” Therefore, you realizehearing-immediately when speech is uttered. Thus, “I await the time when I donot speak and then hear immediately.” Although such is the case, going beyondBuddha is not the matter that happened before the Seven Buddhas, but rather theSeven Buddhas’ endeavors to go beyond Buddha.132 [notes.html#ch3_132]Only in the nondualistic context of “the inaudible in speech” and “thehearing-immediately in no-speech” is speech in the conventional sense liberated,authenticated, and reinstated for use in the realization of going beyond Buddha.The foregoing observations on intimate words, the inaudible, hearingimmediately,and so forth, indicate that metaphors, images, and symbols chosen from anordinary context are used and function quite extraordinarily in the realm ofenlightenment. Words are no longer things that the intellect manipulatesabstractly and impersonally, but rather, things that work intimately in theexistential metabolism of one who uses them philosophically and religiously in aspecial manner and with a special attitude. They are no longer mere means orsymbols that represent realities other than themselves, but are themselves therealities of original enlightenment and Buddha-nature. In this view, words andsymbols inevitably call for practices in which activity and expression areembedded in each other. In Dōgen, as I have noted previously, expression(dōtoku) and activity (gyōji) were synonymous.133 [notes.html#ch3_133]It is in this context that Dōgen’s fresh interpretation of the story of sendaba(saindhava) becomes extremely significant. (Sendaba means “a word having foursignifications”—hence, infinite semantic possibilities.) Dōgen explained theword and commented on it as follows:The ordinary language of monastics is [one with] the entire universe that isthoroughly embraced by their words. You should clearly understand that, becauseeveryday language (kajōgo) is the whole universe, the whole universe is everydaylanguage.… It may be compared to the story in which a ruler [using the wordsendaba] asks for a horse, salt, water, or a bowl, and his subject brings himwater, a bowl, salt, or a horse [according to the ruler’s wish]. Who would knowthat the enlightened ones turn their bodies and their brains within such words?They appropriate words freely in their utterances, transforming an ocean into amouth, a mountain into a tongue. This is the daily life of upright, genuinelanguage. Therefore, those who cover their mouths and close their ears [yetspeak freely and hear everything] are the ones [who are attuned to] the upright,genuine state of the universe.134 [notes.html#ch3_134]For Dōgen, the enlightened person was adept at appropriating the semanticpossibilities of ordinary words in order to express and act out theextraordinary, and even the ineffable, according to the situation. Dōgen’scharacteristic way of thinking here in connection with the use of language wasthat the meaning of an ordinary word was totally exerted (gūjin) so that therewas nothing but that particular meaning throughout the universe at that givenmoment. This was the idea of the total exertion of a single thing (ippō-gūjin),which was central to Dōgen’s entire thought. Elsewhere Dōgen presented his viewof life as sendaba—that is, the world sought sendaba from each of us, and webrought forth whatever we deemed to be sendaba in life.135 [notes.html#ch3_135]Our symbolic and expressive activities were inseparably connected with ourbringing forth sendaba in response to the world’s demand. The world’s search andthe self ’s response were merely two aspects of one and the same reality.Indeed life was nothing but searching for and acting out the myriadpossibilities of meaning with which the self and the world were pregnant,through expressions (dōtoku) and activities (gyōji). This involved not only thehuman world but the nonhuman and nonliving worlds as well (which will bediscussed later in connection with Dōgen’s view of nature), plus much more. Evendreams, illusions, and imagination were not eliminated from the purview ofsemantic possibilities, even though we are prone to reject those areas of humanexperience as illusory or unreal.Dreams are a favorite metaphor in the Buddhist tradition and are often used tosignify phantasmic and phantasmagoric unrealities. Dreams and realities aresharply differentiated and contrasted, and by and large, the former areconceived in depreciatory terms. In Dōgen’s view, however, dreams were as realand legitimate as the so-called realities in that they comprised our incessantefforts to decipher and dramatize the expressive and actional possibilities ofexistence. Both dreams and realities were ultimately empty, unattainable, andwithout self-nature. Going a step further, Dōgen thought that existence wasessentially a discourse on a dream within a dream (muchū-setsumu).136[notes.html#ch3_136] He wrote:Because this wheel of Dharma has myriad directions and myriad aspects, the greatoceans, Mt. Sumeru, the countries and lands, and the Buddhas are realized; thisis a discourse on a dream within a dream (muchū-setsumu) prior to all [ordinary]dreams. Every vivid particularity of the entire universe (henkai no miro) is adream; this dream is none other than all things that are clear and distinct.… Aswe study things—roots and stems, leaves and branches, flowers and fruits, lightsand colors—we see that all are a great dream. Never mistake this for a dreamystate of mind.Thus, while encountering this discourse on a dream within a dream, those who tryto eschew the Buddha-way think that people misconstrue the things of dreams asreal and consequently pile up delusions on top of delusions. This is not true.Even though they say that delusions are multiplied in the midst of delusions,you should certainly investigate the path of freedom (tsūshō no ro) in which youapprehend delusions overcoming delusions (madoi no ue no madoi).137[notes.html#ch3_137]Here, Dōgen’s notion of dreams was so original that dreams as a metaphor forboth illusion and reality, and dreams as a metaphor for neither illusion norreality, became exquisitely entwined with one another so as to present a uniquemetaphysic of dreams. If dreams were an unreality in the ordinary sense, Dōgenelevated this unreality to the level of cosmic or ultimate unreality, in itstotal exertion (gūjin) abiding in the Dharma-position (jūhōi):“As the kōan realized in life, I spare you thirty blows” [the statement of Ch’ênTsun-su (780?–877?)]. This is realization as a discourse on a dream within adream (genjō no muchū-setsumu).Therefore, a tree without roots, a land without a sunny or a shady side, aravine without echoes—all are the realization as a discourse on a dream within adream. It belongs neither to the human nor heavenly realm; nor is it whatordinary people can conjecture. Who can doubt that a dream is enlightenment? Forit is not something that can be doubted. Who can know it? For it is notdependent on human knowledge. Because this supreme enlightenment is nothing butsupreme enlightenment, a dream calls it a dream.138 [notes.html#ch3_138]The dream of supreme enlightenment and the supreme enlightenment of dream werenondually conjoined in one reality or unreality. Dōgen also called it“liberation as a discourse on a dream within a dream” (gedatsu nomuchū-setsumu), which “as though itself hanging in emptiness” (mizukara kūnikakareru gotoku) lets images, myths, parables, and fantasies “play in emptiness”(kū ni yuke seshimuru). Thus, Dōgen wrote:Inasmuch as the wondrous Dharma of Buddhas is communicated only between a Buddhaand a Buddha (yuibutsu-yobutsu), all the phenomena in the dream state as well asin the waking state are equally ultimate realities. In the waking state are thedesire for enlightenment, practice, enlightenment, and nirvāṇa; in the dreamstate are the desire for enlightenment, practice, enlightenment, and nirvāṇa.Dream and reality—each is ultimate nature. Neither largeness nor smallness,neither superiority nor inferiority remains.… Both the dream life and the wakinglife are originally one as ultimate reality. The Buddha-dharma, even in figuresof speech, is ultimate reality. No longer a mere figure of speech, dream-making(musa) constitutes the very reality of Dharma.… Although there is a truth thatBuddha’s liberating efforts [for sentient beings] continue unceasingly in thewaking life, the truth of the Buddhas’ and ancestors’ realization consistsinvariably of what a dream makes within a dream (musa-muchū).139[notes.html#ch3_139]Dreams were thus designated as legitimate expressions and activities in thetotal scheme of things, in which symbols and realities were purified andreinforced by emptiness so as to work for the liberation of sentient beings.So-called illusion was also very carefully considered by Dōgen. The word kūge,as I have mentioned briefly, originally meant the “flowers blooming in the sky,”that is, flowers that are illusory owing to our dim vision (eigen). This termwas changed by Dōgen into the “flowers of emptiness” (the Chinese character kūmeans both the sky and emptiness)—another example of his ingenious use of thesemantic possibilities of a particular term—which shed radically fresh light onthe matter of illusion. Dōgen contended:There are not yet scholars who grasp this truth [of the flowers of emptiness]clearly. They fail to understand the flowers of emptiness, because of theirignorance of emptiness. Owing to their incomprehension of the flowers ofemptiness, they do not know dim-sighted persons (eijin), do not recognize them,do not meet them; they do not become dim-sighted persons themselves. Uponencountering dim-sighted persons, they understand and recognize the flowers ofemptiness. They know only that, the sky-flowers exist because of the eyes’dimness, but fail to discern the truth that the eyes’ dimness exists by virtueof the flowers of emptiness.140 [notes.html#ch3_140]Dōgen was vehement in attacking the view that the flowers of emptiness mightturn out to be nonexistent if the eyes were cured of disease. To Dōgen,birth-and-death, nirvāṇa, Dharma, original enlightenment—all existences—were theflowers of emptiness. But this was precisely so because of the universality of“dim vision.” It did not mean that we see reality dimly independent of our dimvision. Paradoxically, clarity and dimness interpenetrated one another and wereone. Dōgen argued further:Foolishly construing dimness (ei) as untrustworthy, you should not think thereis truth outside this dimness. This is the view of a small mind. If the flowerof dimness were untrustworthy, both the subject and the object of that judgment,which misapprehends it as such, would all be untrustworthy. If all were untrue,there would be no way of establishing reasonableness (dōri). Withoutreasonableness, the idea that the flower of dim vision is untrue cannot besupported. If enlightenment is dimness, all dharmas of enlightenment aresimilarly the dharmas of solemn dimness (ei-shōgon). If delusion is dimness, alldharmas of delusion are similarly the dharmas of solemn dimness. You should sayas follows: Because dim vision is nondual (byōdō), the flowers of emptiness arenondual; because dim vision is of no birth (mushō), the flowers of emptiness areof no birth. Just as all things themselves are ultimate reality (shohō-jissō),so are the flowers of dim vision. It is not a matter of the past, present, andfuture; it does not concern itself with the beginning, middle, and end. Becauseit is not obstructed by birth and extinction, it duly allows birth andextinction to be born and extinguished. [Things] arise and perish in emptiness;they arise and perish in dimness; and they arise and perish in flowers. So dothe rest of all things in time and space.141 [notes.html#ch3_141]The nondualistic oneness of dim vision and the flowers of emptiness was furtherdescribed as follows:Vision (gen) is realized in and through dimness (ei). The flowers of emptinessunfold themselves in vision, vision fulfills itself in the flowers ofemptiness.… Thus, dimness is totally realized and present (zenkigen), vision istotally realized and present, emptiness is totally realized and present, andflowers are totally realized and present.… Indeed, when and where one supremevision is, there are the flowers of emptiness and the flowers of vision. Theflowers of vision are called the flowers of emptiness. What they express is ofnecessity a disclosure (kaimei).142 [notes.html#ch3_142]What concerned Dōgen most was not to eliminate illusion in favor of reality somuch as it was to see illusion as the total realization—not as one illusionamong others, but as the illusion, with nothing but the illusion throughout theuniverse until we could at last find no illusion. Only if and when we realizedthe nonduality of illusion and reality in emptiness could we deal with themwisely and compassionately. Dōgen wrote:You must surely know that emptiness is a single grass. This emptiness is boundto bloom, like hundreds of grasses blossoming.… Seeing a dazzling variety of theflowers of emptiness, we surmise an incalculability of the fruits of emptiness(kūka). We should observe the bloom and fall of the flowers of emptiness andlearn the spring and autumn of the flowers of emptiness.143 [notes.html#ch3_143]Imagination is another area for our consideration. In the Zen tradition, thestatement “A painting of a cake (gabyō) does not satisfy hunger” is often spokenof in relation to the anecdotes of Tê-shan Hsüan-chien (782–865) and Hsiang-yenChih-hsien, signifying something fantasized and unreal that cannot fill thestomach. Dōgen employed this metaphor and offered quite a positive view of apainting of a cake and of a picture or a painting (gato) in general.144[notes.html#ch3_144] Dōgen wrote for example:People think that the statement [“A painting of a cake does not satisfy hunger”]tries to say an unreal thing is really useless, but this is a grave mistake.…What we now express as “a painting of a cake” includes all kinds of cakes suchas paste, vegetable, cheese, toasted, nutritious, and so on—they are allrealized in and through such a painted picture/painting a picture (gato). Youshould realize that they are one with painting; they are one with cake; and theyare one with Dharma. For this reason, all the cakes that are now realized are,without exception, the paintings of various cakes.145 [notes.html#ch3_145]Proceeding from this, Dōgen further developed his thesis of painting andimagination:For painting a landscape, you use blue and green paints, rare boulders,extraordinary rocks, or the seven jewels and the four treasures [a brush, ink,paper, and an ink-stone]. The same is true of the task of making a painting of acake. To paint a picture of a person, you choose the four elements and the fiveskandhas. To paint a picture of a Buddha, you choose not only a clay shrine andan earthen image, but the thirty-two marks, a blade of grass [from which thegolden body of Buddha is said to be created], and countless kalpas of assiduouspractice. Inasmuch as one paints a picture of a Buddha in such a manner, all theBuddhas are the paintings of/by Buddhas (gabutsu); all the paintings of/byBuddhas are the [actual] Buddhas. Examine carefully the painting of/by a Buddhaand the painting of/by a cake. Which one is a stone-carved tortoise? Which oneis an iron staff? Which one is material, and which is mental? You shouldcarefully consider these questions and investigate them thoroughly. When youendeavor this way, [you will realize that] life and death, coming and going, areall a painted picture/painting a picture (gato); supreme enlightenment is noneother than a painted picture/painting a picture. All the dharma world and theempty sky—there is nothing whatsoever that is not a painted picture/painting apicture.146 [notes.html#ch3_146]Painting a picture, the painter, and a painted picture all constituted a singlereality; religion and art ultimately converged in this holistic view thatmirrored the self and the world. From this, Dōgen drew a strikingconclusion—entirely contrary to the traditional interpretation—that the paintedcake alone could satisfy hunger, or to put it differently, unless we ate thepainted cake, we could never satisfy our hunger. Thus, he wrote:Therefore, if there is no painted cake, you have no way to satisfy hunger; ifthere is no painted hunger (gaki), you do not encounter [genuinely seeking]human beings; and, if there is no painted satisfaction (gajū), you cannot gainenergy [for spiritual endeavors]. Indeed, you are satisfied in hunger andno-hunger; you do not satisfy hunger and no-hunger: this truth cannot beattained or spoken of except in terms of the painted hunger.147[notes.html#ch3_147]As has been abundantly shown by now, Dōgen did not reject creative imaginationand artistic creations as unreal or fictitious any more than he discarded theempirical realities of the senses. What is of utmost importance is to understandthat both imagination and reality are mediated, purified, and revitalized byemptiness and, hence, are undefiled.The forgotten notions of dream, illusion, and picture were rescued from theirrelegated status in Buddhist thought at large and brought to the foreground ofDōgen’s thought as areas of human experience that were richly pregnant withsoteriological possibilities. The question of “How and what shall I offer inresponse to life’s demand for sendaba?” represented everyone’s ultimate quest.Dreams, visions, and images were the rich fountainheads for such a quest.Dōgen’s own existential search for sendaba extended even to supranormal powers(jinzū), spells (darani), and so forth, though his interpretations of thesenotions were radically different from traditional ones.148 [notes.html#ch3_148]His search also extended to many other symbols, metaphors, and kōans in which hediscovered and rediscovered neglected and unrecognized semantic possibilitiesthrough his exceedingly meticulous examination and analysis. Indeed, Dōgen’soriginality lay primarily in such efforts, which we shall have occasion towitness many times in subsequent chapters.The foregoing observations should not lead us into thinking that Dōgen wasinsensitive to the ineffable in the mystical experience. As I have suggestedalready, quite the opposite was the case. He wrote, for example:When this expression is uttered, nonexpression (fudōtoku) is unuttered. If yourecognize that expression is uttered in its fullness, and yet do notexperientially penetrate nonexpression as nonexpression, you are still short ofattaining the original face and marrowbones of the Buddhas and ancestors.149[notes.html#ch3_149]Dōgen’s acknowledgment of nonexpression, however, was not a submission to thetyranny of silence but was instead a fidelity to the inexhaustible possibilitiesin the transparency of expressions and activities. Departing radically from themystic method of via negativa, Dōgen was confident in what was yet to beexpressed, in what had already been expressed, as well as in what had not yetbeen expressed or allegedly could not be expressed. Here he concurred with JohnWisdom, who wrote: “Philosophers should be constantly trying to say what cannotbe said.”150 [notes.html#ch3_150] Philosophic and religious enterprisesconsisted in fidelity to the inexpressible and in the search for expressibility;fundamentally speaking, it was an impossible task,151 [notes.html#ch3_151] yetit had to be carried out, because it was a mode of compassion that Dōgen soeloquently expounded as “loving speech” (aigo).152 [notes.html#ch3_152]Let us now examine the cosmological aspect of expression briefly. Dōgen’smetaphysic of expression envisioned the universe as a whole, as consisting ofdynamic, symbolic activities without interruption. Often we think that humansexpress something or that the Absolute expresses itself in its self-limitingmanifestations, but this still retains some residue of dualistic thinking.Inasmuch as there are only expressions throughout the universe, expressionsnaturally express themselves in the total exertion of their shared efforts(jinriki dōtoku surunari; chikara o awasete dōtoku seshimuru).153[notes.html#ch3_153] They are realized neither autonomously nor heteronomously,neither through self-power nor through other-power, yet the Buddhas’ andancestors’ practice of the Way and enlightenment are realized in and throughexpressions. Dōgen wrote:Because you regard seeing-then (kano toki no kentoku) as true, you do not doubtthat expression-now (ima no dōtoku) is true as well. Accordingly, expression-nowis provided with seeing-then, and seeing-then is prepared with expression-now.Thus, expression exists now, seeing exists now. Expression-now and seeing-thenare ever one in their perpetuation. Our efforts now are being sustained byexpression and seeing.154 [notes.html#ch3_154]An expression at any particular space and time was self-contained and absolutelydiscrete from the preceding and subsequent expressions; each expression wastranscendent as well as inherent in relation to the other. Dōgen used “seeing”synonymously with expression, rather than with contemplative theoria.Expression, however, had to be cast off (datsuraku):As you maintain such efforts throughout the months and years, you further castoff those months and years of efforts. In this casting off, you come tounderstand that different people with different modes of realization arelikewise cast off, and that countries, mountains, and rivers are likewise castoff. At this time, if you decide to attain the casting off as your ultimate normof perfection, your decision to attain it is already the very presence of thatultimate norm. Therefore, at the time of this casting off, there is expressionbeing realized immediately. Though neither by the strength of the mind nor bythe strength of the body, expression comes forth of its own accord. When it isuttered, it does not appear to be novel or strange.155 [notes.html#ch3_155]Expression generated itself ever anew in the context of incessantly changingconditions in the perpetuation of the Way through activity (gyōji-dōkan)—akin toWhitehead’s metaphysical vision of “the creative advance of the universe intonovelty” from moment to moment.156 [notes.html#ch3_156] As we shall see in moredetail later in conjunction with the examination of Buddha-nature, expressionwas, more exactly speaking, the self-expression (jidōshu) of Buddha-nature, andhence the Buddha-nature of expression (setsu-busshō).Expression was compared to “entwined vines” (kattō), which attained an entirelynew significance in Dōgen’s thought. The notion of “entwined vines” wasordinarily used in a derogatory sense, such as in reference to doctrinalsophistries and entanglements, attachment to words and letters, and theoreticalconflicts. Again we encounter here Dōgen’s originality in the positive use ofsuch an ordinary metaphor as this by elevating it to new metaphysical andreligious heights. In connection with his discussion of entwined vines, Dōgenreferred to Bodhidharma’s last conversation with his four disciples, Tao-fu,Tsung-chih, Tao-yü, and Hui-k’o, who were said to have attained, byBodhidharma’s acknowledgement, his “skin, flesh, bones, and marrow”(hiniku-kotsu-zui), respectively.157 [notes.html#ch3_157] The story wasapparently designed, according to conventional interpretation, to justifyHui-k’o’s succession to the ancestorship of Bodhidharma on account of his havingmost deeply understood his teacher’s truth—the wisdom of silence, which wasthereafter regarded as the hallmark of Zen Buddhism. On this story, Dōgenadmitted the existence of differences in the four disciples’ interpretations,yet refused to view them discriminately in terms of superiority and inferiorityof views and instead maintained:You should understand that the ancestor’s words “skin, flesh, bones, and marrow”are not concerned about shallowness and deepness [in the disciples’understanding]. Even though there are superior and inferior views, theancestor’s words signify solely the attainment of his whole being. Theircardinal meaning is that the attainment of marrow, the attainment of bones andso on are all to guide people; there is no sufficiency or insufficiency inholding grass or dropping grass [as the means to guide people according to theirabilities and needs]. For example, it is just like [Buddha’s] holding up aflower, or like [a teacher’s] imparting a robe [to a disciple]. What[Bodhidharma] said for the four disciples is that each was equal from thebeginning. Although the ancestor’s words are the same, the four views are notnecessarily identical. The four views differ in their respective incompleteness,and yet, the ancestor’s words are nothing but the ancestor’s words. Generallyspeaking, [the teacher’s] words and [the disciples’] understanding do notnecessarily agree with each other.158 [notes.html#ch3_158]Parting from the traditional interpretation, Dōgen maintained here that despitedifferences in the disciples’ interpretations and responses as “skin, flesh,bones, and marrow,” it was also true that each of them, in his or her own way,grasped the teacher’s whole being. Hence the following: “The skin, flesh, bones,and marrow partake equally in the first ancestor’s body-mind. Marrow is notdeepest, and skin is not shallowest.”159 [notes.html#ch3_159] Furthermore, therewas infinite progress beyond the marrow.160 [notes.html#ch3_160] Dōgen alsosaid:If there appear hundreds of thousands of disciples after the second ancestor,there will correspondingly be hundreds of thousands of interpretations. There isno limit to them. The number of disciples happened to be four, so there werejust the four views of skin, flesh, bones, and marrow for the time being.However, many an expression is left as yet unexpressed and remains to beexpressed.161 [notes.html#ch3_161]The disciples’ questions and answers were the skin, flesh, bones, and marrowthat cast off the body-mind. Each view was seen in the aspect of its totalexertion (gūjin) and of abiding in the Dharma-position (jū-hōi); consequently,it was not an approximation to, or a self-limiting manifestation of, theAbsolute, but a self-activity or a self-expression of Buddha-nature.In this respect, every person is the second ancestor—the successor toBodhidharma. However lowly one’s symbols and practices are as in, say, apeasant’s religion, one is nevertheless entitled to enlightenment if and whenone uses them authentically. Here is the egalitarian basis for the claim thatDōgen’s religion is a religion of the people.Furthermore, Dōgen provided us with profound insight into the nature ofphilosophizing activity. To him what mattered most was not the relativesignificance of theoretical formulations, but how and what we did with the ideasand values inherited from our past—in other words, the authenticity of ourphilosophic activity. The issue was not so much whether or not to philosophizeas it was how to philosophize—in total freedom with body-mind cast off. Thephilosophic enterprise was as much the practice of the bodhisattva way as waszazen. And significantly enough, this view implied that philosophic activityitself was a kōan realized in life.In view of this, different philosophical and religious expressions are entwinedvines, that is, conflicts, dilemmas, antinomies that are all too human and realto be brushed away from the texture of existence. The logic of mystical realismimpelled Dōgen, quite understandably to us by now, to see the heritage andvitality of the Way of the Buddhas and ancestors in the entwined vinesthemselves—not in an absence of or freedom from them.162 [notes.html#ch3_162]According to Dōgen, Dharma did not and should not avoid intellectual—let alonereligious and existential—involvement in conflicts concerning variousinterpretations and views. The noncommittal way of life—in this case withrespect to conflicts—for which Zen Buddhism has been blamed, rightly or wrongly,was absolutely alien to Dōgen’s thought. Thus he wrote:By and large, many sages are commonly concerned with the study of cutting offthe root of entwined vines, but do not realize that “cutting” (saidan) consistsin cutting entwined vines with entwined vines. Nor do they understand entwiningentwined vines with entwined vines, let alone inheriting Dharma in and throughentwined vines. They rarely know that the inheritance of Dharma residesprecisely in entwined vines. There is still no one who hears about it, no onewho understands it. Can there be anyone who realizes it?163 [notes.html#ch3_163]Each entwined vine grew of its own inner necessity without nullifying theothers:You should further investigate thoroughly that because of the power to transcenditself, a vine seed grows into branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits that areintertwined in harmony with one another, without losing their respectiveparticularities. For this reason, the Buddhas and ancestors are realized, andthe kōan is realized in life.164 [notes.html#ch3_164]Each interpretation, though fragmentary and limited, nevertheless exerted itselftotally in its Dharma-position, fulfilling its own possibilities and destiny inperfect freedom, without obstructing others and without being obstructed byothers. Hence, philosophical and religious unity of expressions and vines wasnot comprised of an entity, but of activity—that mode of activity in which“unity” was not contemplated in terms of any metaphysical principle but wasinstead acted out. These entwined and entwining vines constituted the livingtexture of Dōgen’s mythopoeic image of a unity that advanced infinitely “beyondthe marrow,” without a finis, though not without reason (dōri). This was whatDōgen called the “reason of the skin, flesh, bones and marrow entwining witheach other as vines” (hiniku-kotsuzui no kattō suru dōri).165[notes.html#ch3_165]Dōgen viewed the philosophical enterprise as an integral part of the practice ofthe Way. In contradistinction to cultic and moral activities, philosophyconsisted predominantly of intellectual activities that were no less creativethan those other activities of life, if and when intellect was purified andreinforced by the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity (jijuyū-zammai). Ourphilosophic and hermeneutical activities were no longer a means toenlightenment, but identical to enlightenment itself, for to be was tounderstand—one was what one understood. Thus the activity of philosophizing,like any other expressive activity, was restated in the context of our totalparticipation in the self-creative process of Buddha-nature.166[notes.html#ch3_166]Dōgen once said in the Tenzo kyōkun, as I have quoted before: “The monastics offuture generations will be able to understand a nondiscriminative Zen(ichimizen) based on words and letters, if they devote efforts to spiritualpractice by seeing the universe through words and letters and words and lettersthrough the universe.” It is small wonder then that Dōgen produced a uniquestyle of Zen that fully valued our expressive and symbolic activities—includingintellectual and philosophic ones—in the context of all beings’ soteriologicalaspirations.THE ACTIONAL UNDERSTANDING [toc.html#ch3_h2_5]The fundamental concept of understanding was activity in Dōgen’s thought.Understanding was indispensably associated with our whole being—we understood aswe acted and acted as we understood. The activity of the body-mind served notonly as the vehicle of understanding, but also as the embodiment of truth. Oftenin conventional thought, knowledge and truth are ascribed solely to thefunctions of sensation and reason, while the functions of feeling and intuitionare considered merely subjective. Such an artificial compartmentalization ofhuman activity has created some distorted views of the subject. For Dōgen,however, the problem of understanding invariably involved the whole being whichhe called the “body-mind” (shinjin). “Body-mind” was one of Dōgen’s favoritephrases, and he often used the phrase “mustering the body-mind” (shinjin okoshite) to show the human attempt to understand the self and the world.In Buddhism, as in Hinduism, the human body has traditionally been of crucialreligious significance, as Edward Conze rightly emphasizes: “A mindful anddisciplined attitude to the body is the very basis of Buddhist training.”167[notes.html#ch3_167] However, in some aspects of Theravāda Buddhism, an overlyanalytic and negativistic view of the body cannot be denied. That is, theimpurity of the body is assumed, and the realization of its religiousimplications constitutes one phase of Theravāda meditation.168[notes.html#ch3_168] Dōgen discussed this matter in his exposition of the “fourapplications of mindfulness” (catvāri smṛtyupasthānāni; shinenjū),169[notes.html#ch3_169] and argued with respect to the first application:Mindfulness of the impurity of the body means that a skin bag, on which youmeditate at the moment, is the entire universe. Because this is the true body,the mindfulness of the impurity of the body is spirited in the path of freedom[i.e., the nonduality of purity and impurity]. If it is not spirited,mindfulness cannot be possible. If you do not have the body, you cannotpractice, expound, or meditate.…Mindfulness of the body (kanshin) is the body’s mindfulness (shinkan) that isthe body’s, and not any other’s, mindfulness. Mindfulness such as this is trulyvenerable. When the body’s mindfulness is realized, the mind’s mindfulnesscannot be found—even though you look for it, it does not manifest itself.170[notes.html#ch3_170]Dōgen uses the Theravāda concept of the body here, in order to advance his viewwithout concern for the accuracy of his exposition. The human body, in Dōgen’sview, was not a hindrance to the realization of enlightenment, but the veryvehicle through which enlightenment was realized. “ ‘Birth-and-death andcoming-and-going are the true human body’ (shinjitsu-nintai) means that in themidst of birth-and-death, an ordinary person wanders about in delusion, whereasa great sage is liberated in enlightenment.”171 [notes.html#ch3_171] Dōgen’sposition on this issue, as I shall discuss later, was a thorough appreciation ofthe metaphysical and religious significance of the body without monistic andidealistic vestiges that characterized some Mahāyāna schools of Buddhism. ThusDōgen claimed that we search with the body, practice with the body, attainenlightenment with the body, and understand with the body. This was epitomizedin his statement: “The Way is surely attained with the body.”172[notes.html#ch3_172]The human body, with all its particularities and concreteness, attained areligio-philosophical status in Dōgen’s thought. This was due to the body’stwofold participation in the self and the world:(I) The human body is the most primitive matrix from which the human mindevolves and with which the human mind cooperates. In Dōgen’s view, both body andmind shared fortunes with one another: “Because the body necessarily fills themind and the mind necessarily fills the body, we call this the permeation ofbody and mind. That is to say, this is the entire world and all directions, thewhole body and the whole mind. This is none other than joy of a very specialkind.”173 [notes.html#ch3_173] Body and mind were so inextricably interwoventhat it was impossible to separate them. For Dōgen, the exaltation of the mindat the expense of the body led to an enfeebled spirituality. Spiritualitynecessarily had to involve the complex whole of body and mind.174[notes.html#ch3_174] The nondual unity of body and mind (shinjin-ichinyo) wasforcefully brought forth by Dōgen in his attack on the Senika non-Buddhists whoheld the view that the self-identical reality of the mind endured throughout theaccidental adventures of the body. Dōgen argued:You should consider carefully that the Buddha-dharma has always maintained thethesis of the nondual oneness of body and mind. And yet, how can it be possiblethat while this body is born and dissolves, mind alone departs from the body andescapes from arising and perishing? If there is a time when they are one andanother time when they are not, the Buddha’s teaching must be false indeed.175[notes.html#ch3_175]It was fundamentally un-Buddhist in Dōgen’s view to treat the body and mind asif they were separable and consequently to regard the former as perishable,changeable, accidental, and the latter as altogether otherwise. The permanenceof mind or soul independent of the perishability of body was an illusion. Weshall examine this problem in more detail in the next chapter.(2) For Dōgen, the body and mind were united with the world as a whole. Thebody-mind unity, at the level of psycho-physical constitution, was now extendedto a cosmic dimension that was characterized by Dōgen in such phrases as “thebody-mind of Dharma,” “the body-mind of the Buddhas and ancestors,” “thebody-mind of Tathāgata,” “the body-mind of the Way,” and “the body-mind of thethree realms and the realms of heavens and humans.” The body and mind were theentire universe: “The body-mind in the Buddha-way is grass, trees, tiles, andstones; it is wind, rain, water, and fire.”176 [notes.html#ch3_176] From thisstandpoint, Dōgen continued:You should understand the truth that when all the Buddhas of the past, presentand future aspire for enlightenment and carry out that aspiration, they neverexclude their bodies and minds. To doubt this is already to slander them. As wereflect quietly on this matter, it seems quite reasonable that our bodies andminds have endeavored with the Buddhas of the three periods and that our desirefor enlightenment has been awakened with the Buddhas of the three periods.177[notes.html#ch3_177]Although we often think our bodies are bound by our skin and therefore separatedfrom the world, it is not always definite where the body ends and where theexternal world begins, and vice versa. As Whitehead observes, the biological andphysiological functions of the human body, such as those of the molecules thatconstitute it, further blur the boundaries between the human body and itsexternal environment.178 [notes.html#ch3_178]Dōgen saw the human body as an important part of the external world. The humanbody participated in both our inner and outer worlds, and in turn, both theinner and outer worlds participated in each other through the human body. Themind, body, and world interpenetrated one another so inseparably that a hard andfast demarcation between them was altogether impossible. With such a view, tocleanse the body was to cleanse the mind; to cleanse the body-mind was tocleanse the entire universe.179 [notes.html#ch3_179] We shall address thisproblem of cleansing in more detail later.Because the mind, body, and world were inextricably interpenetrated so as toconstitute the totality of reality, the act of human understanding (gakudō)became possible only when we participated in this totality.180[notes.html#ch3_180] Dōgen contended: “There are two ways to study the Way: oneis to understand it with the mind, the other is with the body.”181[notes.html#ch3_181] The first of these methods, understanding with the mind,was explained by Dōgen as follows:Shingakudō is to study [the Way] with all the various aspects of the mind: theconscious mind (citta; sittashin or ryochishin), the cosmic mind (hṛdaya;karidashin), the transcendental mind (iridashin), and so on. It also means thatafter arousing the thought of enlightenment through cosmic resonance(kannō-dōkō), you devote yourself to the great Way of the Buddhas and ancestorsand learn your daily activities with an awakened desire for enlightenment.182[notes.html#ch3_182]It is particularly important for us to note that Dōgen stressed the importanceof perception and thought, which he called sittashin or ryochishin, at theconscious level for the attainment of enlightenment:Of these aspects of the mind, arousing the thought of enlightenment (bodaishin)invariably employs the conscious mind.… The aspiration for enlightenment cannotbe awakened without this conscious mind. I do not mean to identify thisconscious mind directly with the thought of enlightenment, but the latter isengendered by the former.183 [notes.html#ch3_183]Despite the emphasis on conscious thought, it constituted only a portion ofDōgen’s conception of mind, as we shall see further in the next chapter. Itdiffered from the narrowly conceived subjectivistic idealism (which Dōgen wouldhave considered a form of reductionism); understanding with the mind did notimply any subjectivistic or solipsistic predilections in the least. Nor was it adissolution of the conscious mind, as in the case of a certain type ofmysticism. The enlightened mind, as is clear from this, was post-critical andyet continuous with the pre-critical forces of the body-mind. The critical mindwas never forfeited in Dōgen’s thought.Understanding with the body was described by Dōgen as follows:Shingakudō is to study the Way with the body—to study in and through the nakedbodily whole (sekinikudan or shakunikudan). The body comes forth from the studyof the Way, and what comes forth from the study of the Way is all body. Theentire universe is precisely this very human body (shinjitsu-nintai);birth-and-death and coming-and-going are the true human body. By moving thisbody, we shun the Ten Evils, uphold the Eight Precepts, devote ourselves to theThree Treasures, and enter the monastic’s life through renunciation. This is thereal study of the Way; consequently it is called the true human body. A youngBuddhist student should never sympathize with any non-Buddhist view ofnaturalism [i.e., spontaneous generation].184 [notes.html#ch3_184]Again Dōgen was very eager to remind us of the dangers of naturalistic views.When he spoke of the naked bodily existence, he meant the true human body thatcame forth from the act of understanding, which was not to be mistaken withcrude biological instincts or physiological drives. A reductionistic view ofbody was radically rejected by Dōgen; only after this rejection did the“nakedness” of bodily existence, mediated and purified by emptiness, becometruly authentic as it was free of self-centered orientation. Thus, the body cameforth from understanding; the true human body functioned freely andauthentically in harmony with the entire universe.The body-mind totality was at last free from dualistic shackles and was free forduality—that is, the body-mind was now authentically able to deal with the selfand the world. This was the meaning of the body-mind cast off(shinjin-datsuraku), as described in the following famous statement:To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self.To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To beenlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind ofthe self, as well as those of others. Even the traces of enlightenment are wipedout, and life with traceless enlightenment goes on forever and ever.185[notes.html#ch3_185]The self and the world were “cast off ” and hence “undefiled,” but notdissolved. The inexorable duality of the self and the world—with all the ensuingimplications, paradoxes, and conflicts—was not dissolved, but seen in the lightof emptiness and thusness.The casting-off of the body-mind authenticated “mustering the bodymind” (shinjino koshite), as eloquently stated in the following:Mustering our bodies and minds (shinjin o koshite) we see things, and musteringour bodies and minds we hear sounds, thereby we understand them intimately(shitashiku). However, it is not like a reflection dwelling in the mirror, noris it like the moon and the water. As one side is illumined, the other isdarkened (ippō o shōsuru toki wa ippō wa kurashi).186 [notes.html#ch3_186]Herein lies the epitome of Dōgen’s mystical realism. The Way was “intimatelyunderstood” in and through what we expressed and enacted by the mustering of ourbody-minds. Humans and the Way were no longer in a dualistic relationship likethat of the moon and the water, or the mirror and the reflection, or the knowerand the known.Such an intimate understanding has been likened to “forgetting the footsteps ofenlightenment.”187 [notes.html#ch3_187] However, Dōgen’s nondualistic mysticalthinking had an especially realistic thrust, which permeated all aspects of hisreligion and philosophy. That is to say, nonduality did not primarily signifythe transcendence of duality so much as it signified the realization of duality.When one chose and committed oneself to a special course of action, one did soin such a manner that the action was not an action among others, but theaction—there was nothing but that particular action in the universe so that thewhole universe was created in and through that action. Yet even this action waseventually cast off, leaving no trace of the Way whatsoever. This was indeed farfrom being a kind of mysticism that attempted to attain an undifferentiatedstate of consciousness. On the contrary, Dōgen’s thought was entirely committedto the realm of duality—including its empirical and rational aspects.As we incorporate these observations on Dōgen’s view of the body-mindunderstanding into what I have said about activities and expressions, it isevident that activities, expressions, and understanding were one and the samefor Dōgen. It was not that we acted first and then attempted to understand, norwas it even that action was a special mode of understanding; all modes ofunderstanding were necessarily activities and expressions. This was why Dōgensaid: “Understanding through faith (shinge) is that which we cannot evade.”188[notes.html#ch3_188] Every activity-expression was a hermeneutical experiment inand through the body-mind. Ontology and epistemology together became anethically, emotionally, and intellectually purified and revitalized cognition oflife and reality. Thus:Tathāgata’s supranormal power of compassion and everlasting life permit us tounderstand through faith—by exerting our minds and bodies, by exerting theentire universe, by exerting the Buddhas and ancestors, by exerting all things,by exerting ultimate reality, by exerting the skin-flesh-bones-marrow, and byexerting birth-and-death and coming-and-going.189 [notes.html#ch3_189]As noted before, one was what one understood. Ontology (and soteriology for thatmatter) was inevitably hermeneutical.In this chapter, I have endeavored to examine how cultic and moral activities(gyōji), and mythopoeic and philosophic expressions (dōtoku), weredifferentiated from Dōgen’s conception of zazen-only in the samādhi ofself-fulfilling activity. The concepts of activity and expression were generallyin line with the traditional polar concepts of meditation and wisdom in theBuddhist symbolic model. In Dōgen’s thought, however, the philosophy of activityand the activity of philosophy were more radically legitimized without fallinginto the two extremes of monistic pantheism and reductionistic phenomenalism(both of which were, according to Dōgen, dualistic). Hence, ethical andphilosophic endeavors in the world of duality were not to be abandoned, but wereto be liberated by the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity in order for humansto act and think authentically. Only then did the use of categories and conceptsof duality become the coefficient of our total liberation—a liberation no lesscreative than other modes of creativity.Self-understanding of how has led us to the problem of what, that is, what tothink and act. So far we have been primarily concerned with the how, and shallnow turn in the remaining chapters to a detailed investigation of what Dōgenthought and did."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/ch4.jpg]toc.html#ch4EXPRESSION (dōtoku) AND ACTIVITY (gyōji) in Dōgen’s thought can be profitablydiscussed in terms of the religion and metaphysics of Buddha-nature and theritual and morality of monastic asceticism. We will embark on the exposition ofthese two aspects in the remaining two chapters. As we have observed, Dōgen’sthought was intimately connected with Japanese Tendai thought and the ChineseZen tradition. As we probe Dōgen’s life and thought, we also come to realizethat these ideological elements were further transformed by the Japanese ethosof the age in which Dōgen lived. Two of them stand out most prominently: one isthe sentiment of impermanence (anitya; mujō) and the other, reason (yukti;dōri). Both terms were borrowed from the Buddhist tradition, yet they had beenthoroughly acculturated by the late Heian and early Kamakura periods.As Karaki discusses, there were two major types of conceptions regardingimpermanence in the history of Japanese thought.1 [notes.html#ch4_1] One treatedthe actualities of life as evanescent and empty (hakanashi). This sentiment wasprevalent in the Age of Degenerate Law (mappō), in which a great number ofsensitive minds turned first from the secular world to established Buddhism, andthen turned, in despair and alienation, from religion to a retreat fromeverything to a quiet pursuit of their personal predilections (suki or susabi).This was essentially a flight from the impermanence of existence through a“sentimentalization” of it in melancholic and indifferent fatalism, rather thana realistic attempt to cope. It was a sentiment of impermanence rather than ametaphysic of impermanence.2 [notes.html#ch4_2] The other conception confrontedthe actualities of impermanence as facts that could not be escaped and, hence,asked that one attempt to live them and transform them resolutely andheroically. Sadly enough, the aesthetic and religious means of inwardfortification that were fashionable at the time were fatally inadequate sincethey were merely psychological contrivances, and more important, were acts ofattachment to the self that could not change the reality of impermanence. Hence,this second approach concerned itself mostly with a genuine philosophicunderstanding and religious transformation of the existential situation.The leaders of Kamakura Buddhism such as Hōnen, Shinran, Dōgen, and Nichirenshared this latter understanding of the existence of impermanence, but Dōgen wasthe first who seriously attempted to deal with the problem philosophically andreligiously, and as a result produced a metaphysic of impermanence.3[notes.html#ch4_3] As we will recall, impermanence was the alpha and omega ofreligion for Dōgen: reflection upon and understanding of the impermanence ofexistence was tirelessly exhorted throughout his works. His approach was neitheremotive nor psychological but rather religious and metaphysical through andthrough, as we shall see in more detail in what follows. His view was alien tothe fatalism and escapism that had often been associated with the sense ofimpermanence; moreover, he shunned aesthetic indulgence, though he could nothelp but be poetic and eloquent about impermanence.4 [notes.html#ch4_4] Thecrucially important point to note here is the centrality of impermanence, andaccordingly of death, in Dōgen’s whole religious and philosophic thought.Another important idea that bore deeply upon Dōgen’s thought was the concept ofreason, in the sense of the nature or intrinsic logic of things—not the reasonsfor them, but the principle, meaning, or truth behind them. In the Buddhisttradition, the concept of reason was a common subject. Dōgen in particularfavored this word and used it in practically all the subjects with which hedealt.5 [notes.html#ch4_5] The pervasiveness of this concept in medieval Japanhas been well attested by many students of Japanese thought.6 [notes.html#ch4_6]After the Jōkyū War (1221) or thereabout, an earlier fatalistic view of reasongradually lost popularity in favor of a more positive, realistic understandingof it; this development reflected the fall of the last remnants of the Heianaristocracy and the rise of the military class.7 [notes.html#ch4_7] The Buddhisttradition in general advocated the fourfold reason of the Saṃdhinirmocana sūtraand the Yogācārabhūmi—namely the reason of relation (kandai-dōri), the reason ofcausation (sayū-dōri), the reason of recognition (shōjō-dōri), and the reason ofnaturalness (hōni-dōri).8 [notes.html#ch4_8] However, Dōgen’s usage was muchwider and more comprehensive; in fact, the whole spectrum of his thought andpractice was permeated without exception by his search for reason in all aspectsof life.9 [notes.html#ch4_9]Thus to Dōgen it was imperative, both philosophically and religiously, tounderstand (akiramu) the reason of impermanence and to act upon it—thisorientation differed fundamentally from the view of being subjugated to or offighting against the intolerable realities of the age. Furthermore, in thispursuit of the reason of impermanence, Dōgen in turn deeply probed the mysteryand reason of Buddha-nature.TWO STRANDS OF MAHĀYĀNA IDEALISM [toc.html#ch4_h2_1]Buddhism, like other Indian religious and philosophical traditions, approachesthe problems of humanity and the world from what we would broadly designate the“psychological” standpoint.10 [notes.html#ch4_10] Its methodology assumes thatthe activities of the mind are the decisive factor in determining ourwell-being. The opening statements of the Dhammapada proclaim that all we are isthe result of what we have thought;11 [notes.html#ch4_11] the Ratnamegha sūtrabeautifully describes this in the following:All phenomena originate in the mind, and when the mind is fully known, allphenomena are fully known … Bodhisattvas, thoroughly examining the nature ofthings, dwell in ever-present mindfulness of the activity of the mind, and so donot fall into the mind’s power, but the mind comes under their control. And withthe mind under their control all phenomena are under their control.12[notes.html#ch4_12]Nyanaponika Thera summarizes this psychological orientation by saying: “In theBuddhist doctrine, mind is the starting point, the focal point, and also, as theliberated and purified mind of the Saint, the culminating point.”13[notes.html#ch4_13] Hence, what matters most in liberation both individually andcollectively (which is, after all, what religion is all about), as Buddhismconceives it, is the proper understanding and use of the mind. The way toliberation is founded upon the understanding of our psychic conditions and themoral and religious rectification of them, for all the sufferings of existencearise from what we feel, think, and do—ultimately from an ignorant mind. Carefulanalysis of the states of consciousness as well as of the unconscious (which wassystematized elaborately in the doctrine of consciousnessonly by the Vijñānavādaschool, as we shall see presently) derives from this methodological orientation.Thus Buddhism has been, from its very beginning, strongly psychological in itsoutlook and method.14 [notes.html#ch4_14]Buddhism has presented, from its earliest phase to Abhidharma and VijñānavādaBuddhism to present-day Buddhism, wide-ranging analyses, issues, and theories ofthe mind such as those of the five aggregates (goun); the dependent originationof the twelve nidanas (jūni-innen); the unity of the six sense-organs (rokkon),the six sense-objects (rokkyō), and the six consciousnesses (roku-shiki);various interpretations of the mind (citta-manasvijñāna; shin-i-shiki); variousattempts at the classification of mental functions; controversies over thedistinction between the mind (shin’ō or shinnō) and mental functions (shinjo)and their relationship; Abhidharmic analysis of dharmas; Vijñānavādin’s eightconsciousnesses (hasshiki) developed from the six consciousnesses; andcontroversies over the original purity of the nature of the mind. All these areabundantly indicative of Buddhism’s fascination with the human mind as a clue toreligious and moral matters.15 [notes.html#ch4_15]Buddhist psychology also extends beyond conventional concerns to embracephysical, metaphysical, and ethical issues. It deals with the totality of theself and the world. This will become increasingly clear as we go on in thischapter.Having observed this, I now wish to review, very briefly, two facets of MahāyānaBuddhist “idealism” (citta-mātra; yuishin)16 [notes.html#ch4_16] as it isbroadly interpreted—that is, the tradition of consciousness-only (vijñāna-mātraor vijñapti-mātra; yuishiki) and that of tathāgata-garbha (nyoraizō).17[notes.html#ch4_17] The former has to do with a “substratum” of the mind beyondthe six consciousnesses of early Buddhism and Abhidharma philosophy, and thelatter pertains to the original nature of the mind, which has been veryimportant throughout the history of Buddhism.One of the most fascinating aspects of the history of Buddhist thought is thepeculiar—almost agonizing—ideological readjustments attempted by variousindividuals and schools to meet the difficulties posed by the doctrine ofno-self (anātman; muga), which has existed from the very beginning of Buddhism.Abhidharma Buddhism assumed a position that S. Dasgupta calls “pluralisticphenomenalism:”18 [notes.html#ch4_18] the self is viewed as a succession ofeverchanging conglomerations of impersonal dharmas—momentary phenomenal formsdevoid of ultimate ground or cause. This doctrine of no-self had difficultiesexplaining to its critics the nature and continuity of a subject who is rebornthrough a succession of lives, the mechanism of memory and karmic inheritance,the nature of cognition, the locus of moral responsibility, and a legion ofother problems. Adherents of this theory searched for some sort of “agent” or“substratum” that could integrate mental functions, transmit karmic effects, andcontinue the personality through rebirths, but they tried to avoid admitting toany substantialistic self. For example, the idea of “lifeforce” (āyus; ju orjīvitendriya; myōkon) was often referred to in primitive Buddhism, AbhidharmaBuddhism, the Vijñānavāda school, and so forth. According to this view, thelife-force underlies the six consciousnesses, and its duration and measure areallotted to each person on account of karmic merits; it is said to preservewarmth (nan) and consciousness (shiki) and is in turn preserved by the latter(although the relation between the life-force, warmth, and consciousness are notalways clear). Thus, the life-force is the integrator of the body and mind.These three factors are said to depart from the body at death and to betransmitted to the next life. This idea is only one among many other theoreticalconcessions, such as the “original consciousness” (kompon-jiki) of theMahāsaṃghika school, the “subconscious lifestream” (bhavaṅga-citta; ubun-jiki)of the Sthavira school, and the “person” (pudgala; fudogara) of the Vatsīputrīyaschool.19 [notes.html#ch4_19]Let us consider the idealistic line of thought in its historical context. Somerudimentary ideas of consciousness-only appeared in such texts as theSaṃdhinirmocana sūtra, Mahāyāna-abhidharma sūtra, and were later developed byMaitreya (c. 270–350) in the Yogācāra-bhūmi (which is traditionally attributedto him), by Asaṅga (c. 310–390) in his Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, by Vasubandhu (c.320–400) in his Viṃśatikā-vijñapti-mātratā-siddhi,Triṃśikāvijñapti-mātratā-siddhi, and by Dharmapāla (sixth century) in hisVijñaptimātratā-siddhi-śāstra. The consciousness-only thought reached itshighest point in the fourth century and thereafter. Later it was combined, as wesee in the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra and the Ta-ch’êng ch’i-hsin lun (both of which werepresumably fifth-sixth century works), with the tradition of tathāgatagarbha,which had been developed independently of the Vijñānavāda tradition. Vijñānavādathought developed the ideas of manas-consciousness (manas; manashiki) andstore-consciousness (ālaya-vijñāna; arayashiki) as the seventh and the eighthconsciousnesses. Store-consciousness is said to be the psychic repository inwhich unconscious memories, karmic accumulations, impulses, drives, and so forthare stored in the form of “seeds” (bīja; shūji). When conditions are right,these seeds produce “manifestations” (gengyō) that are taken by the ordinaryworldly person to be phenomena of the external world independent of themind—thus forming a dualistic conception of the mind and the world (temben). Inthis connection, thought-consciousness (mano-vijñāna; ishiki) andmanas-consciousness are primarily responsible for the discrimination andindividuation that characterize the empirical world. The manifestations“perfume” (vāsanā; kunjū) their impressions or energies into thestore-consciousness and thus form new seeds. This process of“seeds-manifestations-perfuming-new seeds” takes place constantly—hence, causeand effect occur simultaneously in the present (sambō-chinden-inga-dōji); theprocess repeats itself ad infinitum in a succession of such presents. This isthe dependent origination of phenomena and consciousness (arayashiki-engi), inwhich both subjectivity and objectivity are the products of store-consciousness.As is clear from these cursory observations, store-consciousness is by far themost sophisticated concept innovated by the Buddhists in response to criticismsof the idea of no-self. Indeed, it almost envisions a self-surrogate, yet thisdiffers, or allegedly differs, from any immutable, self-identical substratum ofthe self.20 [notes.html#ch4_20] Here we can see the close historical connectionbetween the idea of the self and the idea of the store-consciousness. However,these ideas of store-consciousness, seeds, and so on are sometimes ambiguous andmisleading due to the intrinsic connotations of the terms. Thestore-consciousness often reminds us of a receptacle in which seeds are storedand hence, is strongly suggestive of permanence and substance instead ofimpermanence and nonsubstantiality—that is, the rise and dissolution ofstore-consciousness from moment to moment in accordance with dependentorigination. Seeds, active in the processes of manifestation and perfuming, arean embryological analogy that strongly suggests the continuity of development,which again is liable to association with the ideas of substratum andimmutability.21 [notes.html#ch4_21]Such a developmental perspective is also reflected in the notion of the “fivestages of spiritual discipline” (goi) that are necessary to realize the socalledtransformation of the eight consciousnesses and the attainment of the fourwisdoms (tenjiki-tokuchi). Moreover, the Vijñānavāda school is preeminentlypsychological and epistemological rather than ontological. It emphasizes theprocess of transformation that occurs in store-consciousness, but it does not goso far as to affirm mind-only as the ultimate reality in which the opposites ofpure and defiled, good and evil, enlightenment and delusion are resolved in adifferent way from the process of transformation.22 [notes.html#ch4_22]Let us now turn to the tathāgata-garbha tradition. This tradition developedindependently along with the Vijñānavāda tradition of Buddhism. Its earliestformulations appeared in the Ārya-tathāgata-garbha-namamahāyāna sūtra, theŚrīmālādevī-śiṃhanāda sūtra, and many other such sūtras around the fourthcentury, and were later developed in such works as the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra, theTa-ch’êng ch’i-hsin lun (popularly known as the Awakening of Faith),Vasubandhu’s Buddhatva-śāstra, Ratnagotravibhāga-mahāyānottaratantra-śāstra, andother treatises in the fifth and sixth centuries. In the history of theevolution of this tradition, the idea of tathāgata-garbha was acknowledgedindependently from that of store-consciousness in its earliest stage; in thenext stage, both were acknowledged simultaneously; and in the final stage, thefusion of the two strands took place as in the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra and theTa-ch’êng ch’i-hsin lun. Especially the latter is said to be the culmination ofthe tathāgata-garbha school of Buddhist thought, which influenced practicallyall the schools and sects of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the East Asian countries.23[notes.html#ch4_23]Although the foregoing observations may give an impression that the tradition ofthe tathāgata-garbha is strictly Mahāyānist, it is actually the result of longdevelopments of Buddhist collective reflections upon the essential nature of themind—that is, as to whether it is originally pure or defiled, or both, orneither. The issue was debated among the Buddhists in the earliest phase of itshistory. As Katsumata observes, the primitive Buddhists conceived that the mindis originally pure and that passions are foreign defilements (shinshō-shōjō;kakujin-bonnō). Even when some argued for the purity and defilement of the mind,the general tendency was to subscribe to the original purity of the mind and tosee the phenomenal nature of the mind as both pure and defiled.24[notes.html#ch4_24] In Abhidharma Buddhism the two schools of thought on thisissue controverted each other, one maintaining the original purity of the mind(e.g., the Mahāsaṃghika school) and the other rejecting it (e.g., theSarvāstivāda school).25 [notes.html#ch4_25]What characterizes Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the other hand, is its consistentadherence, throughout its history, to the idea of the original purity of themind. Indeed, this is said to be the core of Mahāyāna Buddhism, from which alllater doctrinal developments derived, and without which they cannot beadequately understood.26 [notes.html#ch4_26] In contradistinction to thepsychological and ethical approach of early Buddhism and the Abhidharma school,the Mahāyāna approach was predominantly metaphysical with respect to the natureof the enlightened mind and the possibility of Buddhahood, as we see in suchconcepts as no-mind (acitta; mushin), emptiness (śūnyatā; kū), tathāgata-garbha,Dharma-mind (dharma-citta; hosshō-shin), Buddha-nature (buddhatva; busshō),thusness (tathatā; shinnyo), one mind (eka-citta; isshin), originalenlightenment (hongaku).27 [notes.html#ch4_27] Thus, the crude psychologicalconception of the original purity of the mind—of early Buddhism—wasmetaphysically elaborated and refined in various schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism.Garbha, in tathāgata-garbha, refers either to “embryo,” which is thepotentiality to become Tathāgata, or to “womb,” which gives birth to Tathāgata.Garbha in the sense of “store” (which is customary in Chinese translations,comparable to the ālaya of ālaya-vijñāna) may also be interpreted either as theTathāgata “hidden” in sentient beings or as the Tathāgata which “embraces”sentient beings. In both cases (the analogies of which are strikingly similar tothose of the Vijñānavāda school at this point), the first meaning seems to havebeen conceived at the early stages of tathāgata-garbha thought.28[notes.html#ch4_28] In one case, the tathāgata-garbha is in us, whereas in theother we are in the tathāgata-garbha. In the former, tathāgata-garbha is thepotentiality to become Buddhas, psychologically and anthropologically; in thelatter it is a metaphysical or ontological vision of ultimate reality in whichhumans are the constituents of the tathāgata-garbha. In this latter case we cansee the metaphysical possibilities when such an idea is combined with otherpotent Buddhist ideas, such as Buddha-nature, emptiness, and mind-only.This is precisely what happened in Buddhist idealism around the fifth and sixthcenturies when the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra, the Ta-ch’êng ch’i-hsin lun, and othersūtras and treatises were produced. It was in these works that the two quitedifferent traditions of store-consciousness and tathāgata-garbha weresynthesized; yet the synthesis was weighted in favor of the tathāgatagarbhaorientation, that is, the belief in the original purity of the mind. This isespecially true of the Ta-ch’êng ch’i-hsin lun, which is often said to be theapex of the tathāgata-garbha tradition of Buddhist thought.29[notes.html#ch4_29]In this work, store-consciousness is defined as that in which “neither birth nordeath” (nirvāṇa) pervades “birth and death” (samsāra)—both are neither identicalnor different—and that which has the two aspects of enlightenment andnonenlightenment.30 [notes.html#ch4_30] The Vijñānavādin conception of thesignificance of store-consciousness is discarded, and manas-consciousness in thescheme of the eight consciousnesses is dropped, although some basic ideas of theVijñānavāda school are still utilized. The phenomenal world is construed asarising from the activation of store-consciousness, or thusness, by “basicignorance” (komponmumyō), and explained in terms of the three subtle aspects(sansai) and the six coarse aspects (rokuso),31 [notes.html#ch4_31] or in termsof the five minds (goi).32 [notes.html#ch4_32] In a symbolic expression,indicative of the mystery of ignorance, this work speaks of ignorance asoriginating “suddenly.”33 [notes.html#ch4_33] Enlightenment is classified as“original enlightenment” (hongaku) and “acquired enlightenment” (shikaku), twoclassifications that became the fundamental concepts in Buddhist thought in itssubsequent history.34 [notes.html#ch4_34] Both enlightenment andnonenlightenment have been said to be aspects of the same essence, namely,thusness.35 [notes.html#ch4_35] The mystery of “perfuming” (vāsanā;kunjū)—permeation or suffusion in the Vijñānavāda tradition—is of two kinds: theperfuming of ignorance and the perfuming of thusness. Thus, originalenlightenment, ignorance, and the mind in between, perfume one another in suchways that one has either a deluded mind or an enlightened mind.36[notes.html#ch4_36] Ignorance continues perpetually to permeate the mind, fromthe beginningless beginning until it perishes by the realization ofenlightenment, but thusness or original enlightenment has no interruption and noending.37 [notes.html#ch4_37] Thusness, moreover, has the inner urge to expressitself, seeming to suggest that it is not nothing as well as not neutral.38[notes.html#ch4_38]These strands of Buddhist idealism are presented here in order to provide thebackground for our subsequent investigation. It is particularly noteworthy atthis juncture to recognize that the oldest idealistic tenet, “The triple worldis mind-only” (sangai-yuishin) in the Daśabhūmika sūtra—which was originally anindependent sūtra but later incorporated into the Avataṃsaka sūtra—is moreclosely aligned historically and ideologically with the tathāgata-garbhatradition than with the Vijñānavāda tradition, although the latter two providedtwo different interpretations of the tenet.39 [notes.html#ch4_39] Indeed,tathāgata-garbha thought can be construed as the philosophical-religiousexplication of the tenet “The triple world is mind-only”; incidentally, ChineseHua-yen metaphysics can be regarded as the further development of thisinterpretation.40 [notes.html#ch4_40] Furthermore, Zen’s relation to thesetraditions can be conjectured from the legendary association of Bodhidharma withthe Laṅkāvatāra sūtra and from the association of Chih-yen (602–668), Ch’engkuan(738–840), and Kuei-fêng Tsung-mi (780–841) with Zen Buddhism. Thus, Hua-yenmetaphysics, the tathāgata-garbha tradition, and Zen Buddhism were intimatelyrelated to each other historically and ideologically. This strand of Buddhistidealism is very important to understand Dōgen’s view of mind in general andBuddha-nature in particular, the examination of which we shall now begin.MIND: BEYOND MONISTIC PANTHEISMAND REDUCTIONISTIC PHENOMENALISM [toc.html#ch4_h2_2]Dōgen once proclaimed: “Discourse on [the nonduality of] the mind and itsessence (sesshin-sesshō) is the great foundation of the Buddha-way”;41[notes.html#ch4_41] he wrote extensively on this subject matter in many chaptersof the Shōbōgenzō.42 [notes.html#ch4_42] As shall become increasingly clear inour subsequent investigation, Dōgen’s interpretation of mind inherited the bestelements of Hua-yen, tathāgata-garbha, and Zen traditions, yet overcame somevulnerabilities inherent in them, and went beyond them by being deeply practicaland existentialist.In general accord with the Mahāyāna Buddhist interpretation of mind, Dōgen usedthe notion in various ways.43 [notes.html#ch4_43] First of all, mind was thetotality of psycho-physical realities. As noted before, Dōgen emphasized theimportance of the conscious mental activities of intellect, feeling, and will(ryochinenkaku). However, he also said that the entire universe was mind: “Thetriple world is mind-only” (sangai-yuishin). Thus he equated mind with“mountains, rivers, and the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars.”44[notes.html#ch4_44] By so doing, Dōgen did not maintain, like some Buddhists,that all existence was reducible to mind as ordinarily interpreted byBerkeleyian subjective idealism. Dōgen discussed conversations betweenSaṃghanandi, the seventeenth ancestor of Indian Buddhism, and his discipleGayāśata regarding the phenomenon of the tinkle of a bell—whether what tinkleswas the bell, the air, or the mind. Gayāśata’s view, approved by his teachersubsequently, was that the mind—neither the bell nor the air—tinkles.45[notes.html#ch4_45] A subjective idealism in this sense was also generallyaccepted by Zen Buddhists. Dōgen’s view on the other hand was that, in the finalanalysis, inasmuch as these three factors were “quiet” (jakujō) or empty, the“tinkle of the bell” was neither the tinkle of the air nor the tinkle of thebell nor the tinkle of the mind (in its ordinary sense). It was “the tinkle ofthe air, the tinkle of the bell, the tinkle of stirring [the air], and thetinkle of tinkle (mei-mei)—each abiding in its own Dharma-position as anexpression and activity of emptiness and thusness.46 [notes.html#ch4_46] Asalready mentioned in this example, Dōgen maintained that mind was not only thetotality of the psycho-physical world but also “something” more; accordingly,mind was identified with some important terms such as thusness (tathatā;shinnyo), Dharma-nature (dharmatā; hosshō), Buddha-nature (buddhatā orbuddhatva; busshō), and emptiness.Dōgen wrote:You should know that in the Buddha-dharma, the teaching of the “essence of mind(shinshō) as the all-embracing aspect of the universe” [the Ta-ch’êng ch’i-hsinlun] includes the whole reality; it does not separate reality from appearance orconcern itself with arising and perishing. Even enlightenment and nirvāṇa arenothing other than this mind-essence. All things and all phenomena areinvariably this one mind—nothing is excluded, all is embraced. All these variousteachings are all one mind of nonduality (byōdō-isshin). To see no particulardifference is the way Buddhists have understood the nature of mind.Such being the case, how can you discriminate between body and mind, and dividebirth-and-death and nirvāṇa, within this single Dharma? Inasmuch as we areundoubtedly the children of Buddha, do not listen to those mad people who speakof non-Buddhist views.47 [notes.html#ch4_47]It is noteworthy to see here a specific reference to the Ta-ch’êng ch’i-hsinlun’s doctrine of tathāgata-garbha, which embraces the Dharma-world(dharma-dhātu; hokkai)—indicating the affinity Dōgen’s view of mind felt forthat particular tradition. To Dōgen, mind was at once knowledge and reality, atonce the knowing subject and the known object, yet it transcended them both atthe same time. In this nondual conception of mind, what one knew was what onewas—and ontology, epistemology, and soteriology were inseparably united. Thiswas also his interpretation of the Hua-yen tenet “The triple world ismind-only.” From this vantage point, Dōgen guarded himself against the inherentweaknesses of the two strands of Buddhist idealism: the advocacy of thefunctions of mind (shinsō) by the school of consciousness-only and the advocacyof the essence of mind (shinshō) by the school of tathāgata-garbha—both of whichwere vulnerable to a dualism between phenomena and essence. Thus,philosophically speaking, Dōgen maneuvered between monistic pantheism andreductionistic phenomenalism. In this respect, he sought the middle way in hisown manner.Now, mind can be posited as the knowing subject in opposition to the knownobject, as the mind in opposition to the body, and as the essence of mind inopposition to the functions of the mind or the mind-body totality. One of thetypical views of mind embraces the first of these three pairs of opposites;another holds to the second group. Mahāyāna Buddhism, being nondualisticallyoriented by virtue of its two pivotal notions, of dependent origination(pratītya-samutpāda; engi) and emptiness (śūnyatā; kū), was ever vigilantagainst falling into any dualistic traps. Nevertheless the dangers of subtledualisms existed even at the time of Dōgen. Let us examine this matter a littlefurther.One of the targets for Dōgen’s philosophical attack was the so-called Senikanon-Buddhist school (senni-gedō), which held the view of the self-identicalreality of mind as opposed to the body. Dōgen explained the Senika view asfollows:Speaking of association with non-Buddhist ways, there is a school called theSenika in India. Its view is as follows: “The great Way resides in our presentbodies, and its nature can be easily understood: it recognizes pleasure andsuffering, is aware of hot and cold, and discerns pain and itch. It is neitherobstructed by things nor affected by environs; although things come and go, andenvirons appear and disappear, spiritual intelligence (reichi) is eternal andunchangeable. This spiritual intelligence permeates all living beings, ordinaryand holy alike, without discrimination. Even though there may be the illusoryflowers of false dharmas temporarily in them, once wisdom suited to a particularthought-moment appears, things are dissolved and environs disappear; thereupon,the original nature of spiritual intelligence alone remains clear and calm. Evenif our bodily form disintegrates, spiritual intelligence emerges intact, just aswhen a house is burning from an accidental fire, its owner escapes safely fromit. The luminous and subtle—known as the nature of the awakened and the wiseone—is also called Buddha, or known as enlightenment. The self and the other areboth endowed with it; delusion and enlightenment are both permeated by it.Whatever things and environs may be, spiritual intelligence is neither togetherwith the environs nor the same as the things: it is eternally changeless. Allenvirons now existing may be regarded as real insofar as they depend on thepresence of spiritual intelligence; because they are conditioned to arise by theoriginal nature, they are real dharmas. Even so, they are not always abiding asspiritual intelligence is, because they are subject to arising and perishing.Regardless of light and darkness, [spiritual intelligence] knows themmysteriously; hence it is called spiritual intelligence. Furthermore, it isknown as the true self, the origin of enlightenment, the original nature, or theoriginal substance. When one awakens to this original nature, one is said toreturn to the always abiding, and is called ‘the great being returning to thetrue.’ Thereafter, no longer transmigrating in the cycles of birth and death,one enters the ocean of the [original] nature where there is no arising norperishing. Aside from this, nothing is true. The more such a nature is obscured,the more the triple world and the six worlds arise in rivalry.” This is the viewof the Senika school.48 [notes.html#ch4_48]Spiritual intelligence was serenely unaffected by the vicissitudes of bodilyexistence and, even after the latter’s dissolution, retained its self-identicalexistence. The idealistic orientation of Buddhist thought in general left manysusceptible to the Senika view, and Dōgen wrote frequently about it in his worksto warn fellow Buddhists against allowing variously disguised versions of thisview to creep into their thoughts. Dōgen wrote for example: “Hearing the wordBuddha-nature, many scholars erroneously take it for the ātman of the faultySenika view.”49 [notes.html#ch4_49] Dōgen’s critique of the mistaken view of theeternity of mind and the perishability of body (shinjō-sōmetsu no jaken) wasvehement and relentless, as evident in the following:You should understand this: In India and China, it is well known that theBuddha-dharma from the very beginning has maintained the unity of body and mindand the nonduality of essence and form. This is indisputable. Needless to say,from the standpoint of changelessness (jōjū), all things are changeless withoutexception, with no differentiation between body and mind. From the standpoint ofunconditionedness (jakumetsu), all existences are equally unconditioned, with nodifferentiation between essence and form. In view of all this, is it notunreasonable for some to assert that while the body perishes, the mind endures?What is more, it should be realized that this very birth-and-death itself isnirvāṇa; nobody can speak of nirvāṇa independently of birth-and-death. Indeed,even if you intellectually apprehend the eternity of mind that is separated fromthe body, and thereby deceive yourself into construing it as the Buddha-wisdomindependent of birth-and-death, your mind of abstract understanding anddiscriminative perception is still subject to birth and annihilation, and it isby no means changeless. Is this not pitiful?50 [notes.html#ch4_50]Dōgen’s concern was quite justifiable since it was an ever-recurringphilosophical temptation to corrupt the ideas of dependent origination andemptiness—the lasting Buddhist contribution to the philosophical and religiousheritage of the world. The real purpose behind Dōgen’s critique of the Senikaschool was to warn those Buddhists who had unwittingly accepted the Senikapresuppositions and consequently ruined the Buddhist metaphysical foundation.51[notes.html#ch4_51]Another frequent target of Dōgen’s vehement attack was Ta-hui Tsung-kao(1089–1163), the foremost leader of the Lin-chi (Rinzai) sect of Chinese ZenBuddhism, who advocated a view different from that of the Senika school. Dōgenwrote:Subsequently, Zen Teacher Ta-hui Tsung-kao of Ching-shan once said: “Buddhiststoday are fond of arguing the problem of mind and its essence, and like to talkabout its mystery and subtlety; consequently, they are slow in the attainment ofthe Way. When we resolutely abandon both mind and its essence, forgetting itsmystery as well as its subtlety, and thereby establish that these two aspectsare of no-birth, only then do we attain enlightenment.”Such a view understands neither the fundamental writings nor the eternalteachings of the Buddhas and ancestors.52 [notes.html#ch4_52]Dōgen then tells us that Tsung-kao asserted a kind of negativistic mysticismthat totally obliterated any mental activities. He further states hisinterpretation of Tsung-kao’s view as follows:Accordingly, he holds such a view because he conceives mind to be nothing butintellect and perception, but fails to learn that intellect and perception arealso [an integral part of ] mind. He unwarrantedly regards the essence of mindas only serene and calm, but does not understand the existence and nonexistence[that is, the dynamic workings] of Buddha-nature and Dharma-nature. He has nevereven dreamt of the nature of thusness (nyozeshō); this is why he misunderstandsthe Buddha-dharma in this manner.53 [notes.html#ch4_53]While I have some reservations about Dōgen’s interpretation of Tsung-kao at thispoint, in light of his frequent sectarian attitude toward his rival sect (towhich Tsung-kao belonged) despite his catholic view of Buddhism, we mustappreciate Dōgen’s attack on the negativistic predilection of Tsung-kao’sthought. Thus, in contrast to the Senika thinkers who believed in the eternityof spiritual intelligence as opposed to the body, Tsung-kao maintained thedissolution of any discriminative activities of consciousness that amounted to astate of unconsciousness. As Dōgen further argued, “abandoning both mind and itsessence” was itself the very act of mind; likewise, “forgetting its mystery aswell as its subtlety” was itself an expression of the profound mystery of mind.Hence, there was no escape from the mind.54 [notes.html#ch4_54] Enlightenmentwas not a static unconsciousness, but rather a dynamically heightened awareness.Going a step further, Dōgen detected in Tsung-kao a dualistic presuppositionconcerning the “serene and calm” essence of mind (shō) and the ordinaryfunctions of mind (shin); Tsung-kao believed enlightenment lay in the former.Perhaps this criticism was related to Dōgen’s unusually severe disparagement (aswe saw previously) of the phrase “seeing into one’s nature” (kenshō) inHui-nêng’s Platform Sūtra—a phrase Dōgen believed inauthentic and indicative ofsubstantialistic thinking.55 [notes.html#ch4_55] Dōgen’s view supported thenonduality of mind and its essence, which was said to be “the great foundationof the Buddha-way.”56 [notes.html#ch4_56] In any event, Tsung-kao and the Senikaview were not far apart from one another at their deeper level—there was onlythe difference of the substantialization of mind in opposition to body in onecase, and that of mental essence as opposed to mental functions in the other.57[notes.html#ch4_57]It is patent in the foregoing observations that however we may interpret themind—whether as the knowing subject, the mind, or the spiritual essence inrelation to the known object, the body, or the mental functions,respectively—its elevation to any metaphysical preeminence was radically anddefinitively repudiated by Dōgen. The mind in Dōgen’s thought was not anall-embracing and all-pervasive metaphysical principle (such as the Absolute,the ground of being, etc.),58 [notes.html#ch4_58] nor was it a cosmic extensionof the ordinary mind (such as Spirit, Cosmic Consciousness, etc.). The mind cameinto and out of being with the psycho-physical activities of the mind and thecreative activities of the physical universe. Yet it was not just coextensivewith them or in proportion to them; rather it transcended the sum total of them,as we shall see later in connection with Buddha-nature. Hence, the depths andmysteries of the mind were unfathomable by what Dōgen called “the non-Buddhistview of naturalism” (jinen-gedō), from which he vehemently disassociated himself(naturalism in Buddhism specifically referred to the view that all things weregenerated spontaneously without karmic causation; the devastating implication ofthis was that spiritual efforts were dispensable).Dōgen frequently mentioned naturalism throughout his works, implicitly andexplicitly. In his criticism of Tsung-kao, which I quoted a moment ago, Dōgencharged him with subscribing to what essentially amounted to a naturalistic viewof the mind, in which activities of sensation and intellect were the inertproducts of organismic and phenomenal conditions, rather than contributing partsof them in a larger reality. In his discourse on “this mind itself is Buddha”(sokushin-zebutsu), the Zen equivalent of the esoteric Buddhist principle “thisbody itself is Buddha” (sokushin-jobutsu), Dōgen pointed out the mistake ofnaively identifying the discriminating and individuating activities of mind withBuddha.59 [notes.html#ch4_59] For them to be purified and reinforced byenlightenment, the mind had to be redeemed by the mind that is Buddha in orderto say that it was “mountains, rivers, and the earth; the sun, the moon, and thestars.” This was the true meaning of the principle “this mind itself is Buddha.”Thus, Dōgen’s position adroitly avoided any monistic or reductionistic pitfalls,and abided, remarkably consistently, with the nonduality of mind and matter,mind and body, spirit and mind, and so on. He wrote:This mind [that is, the thought of enlightenment (bodaishin)] does not existintrinsically or rise suddenly in a vacuum. It is neither one nor many, neitherspontaneous nor congealed. [This mind] is not in one’s body, and one’s body isnot in the mind. This mind is not all-pervasive throughout the entire world. Itis neither before nor after, neither existent nor nonexistent. It is notself-nature or other-nature; nor is it common nature or causeless nature.Despite all this, arousing the thought of enlightenment occurs where cosmicresonance (kannō-dōkō) is present. It is neither conferred by the Buddhas andbodhisattvas, nor is it acquired by one’s own effort. Because the thought ofenlightenment is awakened through cosmic resonance, it is not spontaneouslygenerated.60 [notes.html#ch4_60]Things, events, and beings of the universe were the expressions (setsu) of mindwithout exception.61 [notes.html#ch4_61]Dōgen further discussed the classical Buddhist statement, “The triple world ismind-only; there is no dharma other than the mind. Mind, Buddha, and sentientbeings—these three are no different from one another.” He argued that we wouldnot say “the triple world is mind-only” as if there were the two separateentities of “the triple world” and “mind-only”—rather we would say “the tripleworld of mind-only” and “the mind-only of the triple world.”62[notes.html#ch4_62] This notion was said to be the “total realization of thetotal Tathāgata” (zen-nyorai no zen-genjō), beyond which there was no worldwhatsoever. There was nothing outside the triple world (sangai wa muge nari) anymore than there were beings other than “sentient beings” (shujō), which forDōgen meant all beings—sentient and insentient alike. The triple world was notto be seen in subjective or objective terms, but “in and through the tripleworld” (sangai no shoken). Dōgen explained:The triple world is not the intrinsic being nor the present being. The tripleworld is neither newly formed nor born by way of causation. It is notcircumscribed by the beginning, middle, and end [of the time scheme]. There isthe triple world we transcend, and there is the triple world we live in here andnow. All its workings meet one another; all its conflicts grow with one another[in perfect freedom]. The triple world of here-and-now is seen in and throughthe triple world itself. To be seen [in and through the triple world] means tosee the triple world. To see the triple world is the realization of the tripleworld and the triple world of realization—the kōan realized in life(genjō-kōan).63 [notes.html#ch4_63]Mind-only was described as follows:Mind-only is not one or two. It is not within the triple world, nor does itleave the triple world. You should not err in this matter. It is at once theconscious mind and the nonconscious mind. It is walls, tiles, mountains, rivers,and the great earth. Mind is the “skin-flesh-bones-marrow” and the“holding-up-a-flower-and-bursting-into-laughter.” There are the mind of beingand the mind of nonbeing; the mind of body and the mind of nonbody; the mindprior to the physical formation and the mind posterior to it. The body isvariously begotten from either a womb, eggs, moisture, or metamorphosis; themind is created differently through either a womb, eggs, moisture, ormetamorphosis. Blue, yellow, red, and white—these are mind; long, short, square,and round—these are mind. Birth and death, and coming and going constitute thismind; years, months, days, and hours form this mind. Dreams, visions, and theillusory flowers in the sky are mind; bubbles and flames are mind. The springflowers and the autumn moon are mind, and topsyturvy everyday life is mind.Despite being such trivialities, mind should not be abandoned. For thesereasons, it is the mind in which all things themselves are ultimate reality(shohō-jissō-shin)—the mind that communicates between a Buddha and a Buddha(yuibutsu-yobutsu-shin).64 [notes.html#ch4_64]What emerges from these observations is that the triple world and mind-only arenot the two polar concepts of an epistemologically oriented idealism or of acosmological explanation. As I have alluded to earlier in this chapter and shallmake clearer later, any embryological, cosmological, emanationistic, or causaloutlooks are alien to the basic religious and philosophical insight of Buddhism,and particularly to Dōgen’s thought. In his exposition on the idea of dependentorigination, Ui is emphatic in pointing out that the original intention ofdependent origination was not to probe into the process or causation oforigination so much as it was to envision the state in which all the conditionsand forces of the world were functionally interdependent. The idea of dependentorigination was not a theoretical explanation but a soteriological vision.65[notes.html#ch4_65] Thus, combined with the idea of dependent origination andits twin idea of emptiness, Dōgen’s “idealism” of mind-only provides a uniquevision of reality in which mind-only is the one and only reality that is bothsubject and object ( the triple world ) and their ground. That is why “thetriple world is mind-only” is also equated with “all things themselves areultimate reality” (shohō-jissō), “the kōan realized in life” (genjō-kōan), andso forth.At this juncture, we must further probe Dōgen’s view of mind as unattainable(anupalambha; fukatoku), which is often associated with the negative aspects ofemptiness such as its being ineffable, nothingness, and an innate endowment.However, Dōgen was openly critical of such a view.66 [notes.html#ch4_66] In hisdiscussion of extensive pilgrimages (hensan), which for him were not so muchabout physical travel or visits to Zen teachers in the spatio-temporal realm asthey were about “nondual participation” (dōsan) in the enlightenment of theBuddhas and ancestors, Dōgen had this to say:When extensive pilgrimages are indeed totally exerted, so are they cast off. [Itis just like] the sea which is dried up, yet does not show its bed, or the onewho dies and does not retain mind. “The sea is dried up” means the whole sea istotally parched. Nevertheless, when the sea is parched, the bed is not seen[because it is of no-bed, empty, and unattainable]. Analogously, thenonretaining and the total retaining [of mind]—both are the human mind. Whenhumans die, mind is not retained—because their dying is exerted, mind is notleft behind. Thus, you should know that the total human is mind and the totalmind is human. In such a manner, you can thoroughly understand both sides of adharma.67 [notes.html#ch4_67]Here, we have the application of Dōgen’s fundamental idea of “the total exertionof a single thing” (ippō-gūjin) to the theme of pilgrimages. Unattainability, inDōgen’s thought, was maintained less in the static and transcendent mode ofemptiness and more in the dynamic and creative mode in which any single act(dying, eating, or whatnot) was totally exerted contemporaneously,coextensively, and coessentially with the total mind—not with a fragment of thatmind. Thus in this moment, this single act alone was the mind-only of the tripleworld, excluding all other acts and things. This was Dōgen’s metaphysics of“mystical realism,” epitomized in the statements “when one side is illumined,the other is darkened” (ippō o shōsuru toki wa ippō wa kurashi) and “the totalexperience of a single thing is one with that of all things” (ippōtsū koremambōtsū nari). This was also what Dōgen meant by “abiding in a Dharma-position”(jū-hōi). When viewed in this way, Dōgen’s theory of mind was far from a dry,impersonal theoretical pursuit of the nature of mind, but was a profoundlypersonal and existential concern with the self, as expressed in the following:To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self.To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To beenlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind ofthe self as well as those of others. Even the traces of enlightenment are wipedout, and life with traceless enlightenment goes on forever and ever.68[notes.html#ch4_68]This was Dōgen’s answer to the dictum “Know thyself ” (the common heritage ofGreek and Buddhist philosophies).69 [notes.html#ch4_69] The net result of thisapproach to the self and the world was Dōgen’s preeminent emphasis on a choiceor commitment—in creative activities (gyōji) and creative expressions (dōtoku)—to live duality in the manner of “abiding in a Dharma-position” and “the totalexertion of a single thing,” rather than to flee or obfuscate it. In this view,what duality implied was not necessary evil, but the necessary (and only)habitat in which we lived and were enlightened. We are now prepared to proceedto the pivot of Dōgen’s thought—Buddha-nature.BUDDHA-NATURE [toc.html#ch4_h2_3]Dōgen’s analysis of Buddha-nature (buddhatā or buddhatva; busshō) starts withhis own unique interpretation of a passage taken from the Mahāpari-nirvāṇasūtra, which reads: “All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature withoutexception” (issai no shujō wa kotogotoku busshō o yūsu). However, the sameChinese sentence can also be read as Dōgen read it, “All existence (i.e., allsentient beings) is Buddha-nature” (issai-shujō shitsuu-busshō),70[notes.html#ch4_70] and thus have its meaning dramatically transformed. In hisreading of this classic passage, which revealed his ingenuity and versatility ininterpreting scriptural passages, Dōgen modified the conceptions ofBuddha-nature and sentient beings. He accomplished the first by his equation ofall existence with Buddha-nature; the second by his equation of all existenceand sentient beings. In each case, both Buddha-nature and sentient beings wereliberated from anthropocentric and biocentric perspectives; as a consequence,they acquired a new scope and depth. Let us examine them in some detail.As is clear from the history of Buddhist thought, Buddha-nature was intimatelyrelated to the tathāgata-garbha strand of the Buddhist idealist tradition thatpursued, as we have seen before, the problem of the original purity of the mind.It was also well known that this tradition employed misleading metaphors such asseed, embryo, womb, and gotra. Thus Buddha-nature was construed, more often thannot, as the innate potentiality of Buddhahood. Whether this potentiality was tobe attributed to all sentient beings without discrimination or only to certaintypes of beings was hotly debated by the Buddhists and produced two schools ofthought on the matter: one that advocated the universality of the Buddha-naturein all sentient beings (the tathāgata-garbha tradition); and the other that, asin the consciousness-only sect, held that there were the so-called five groups(goshō) of sentient beings classified according to their “inherently existingseeds” (honnu-shūji) and were thus rigidly predetermined in terms of theirspiritual destinies. For example, the icchantika group (issendai) of sentientbeings were said to lack undefiled seeds (muroshūji) in store-consciousness andwere hence doomed to eternal wandering through rebirths. The śrāvaka group(shōmon-jōshō) and the pratyekabuddha group (engaku-jōshō), though far betterthan the icchantika group in the sense that they were able to attain thearhatship and the pratyekabuddhahood respectively, were eternally precluded fromthe possibility of attaining Buddhahood due to their lack of undefiled seeds.Only the bodhisattva group (bosatsu-jōshō) and some from the indeterminate group(fujōshō) entertained hope of the enlightenment of Buddha.In this manner, sentient beings were hierarchically placed in accordance withthe nature of inherently existing seeds and their possession or nonpossession ofundefiled seeds. Consequently, certain groups of sentient beings were branded aspossessing no Buddha-nature.71 [notes.html#ch4_71] It goes without saying thatDōgen sided, as other Mahāyānists did, with the universalism of thetathāgata-garbha tradition by advocating the theory of one group ornature—Buddha-nature was possessed by all sentient beings. However, thistraditional theory still had disturbing implications: Buddha-nature was strictlyconfined to sentient beings and did not include insentient beings, andBuddha-nature was the native endowment or potentiality possessed by sentientbeings. That is to say, its “universalism” was still restrictive and conceivedin a highly anthropocentric or biocentric manner.Dōgen revolted against these implications of the traditional theory and declaredthe absolute inclusiveness of Buddha-nature under which sentient, as well asinsentient, beings were equally subsumed. This was what he meant by “allexistence.” He wrote:Therefore, mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all the sea ofBuddha-nature. “All is realized by virtue of [the sea of Buddha-nature]”(kaiekonryū) [in Aśvaghoṣa’s previously quoted saying] means that the very time[all is] realized by virtue of it is none other than mountains, rivers, and thegreat earth. Inasmuch as it is unambiguously said that all is realized by virtueof it, you should understand that such is characteristic of the sea ofBuddha-nature. It has absolutely nothing to do with the inside or the outside orthe center [of the universe]. Thus, to see mountains and rivers is tantamount toseeing Buddha-nature. To see Buddha-nature is to observe a donkey’s jaw and ahorse’s mouth [that are nothing special in our ordinary experience]. “All [isrealized] by virtue of it” means “All the universe [is realized] by virtue ofit” as well as “By virtue of it [is realized] all the universe.” You shouldunderstand it this way, and even go beyond that understanding.72[notes.html#ch4_72]The self-creation of Buddha-nature itself constituted all the phenomena of theuniverse. In a spirit similar to that of Meister Eckhart, Dōgen would say thatBuddha-nature “abhors an empty space.”Dōgen further elaborated on “all existence” as follows:Note the following: Existence now construed as all existence by virtue ofBuddha-nature is not that being which is in opposition to nonbeing. Allexistence is the words and tongues of Buddhas, the eyeballs of the Buddhas andancestors, and monastics’ nostrils. It goes without saying that the notion, “allexistence,” is not the existence with a beginning in time (shiu), or theintrinsic existence in things (honnu), or the mysterious and subtle existence(myōu)—much less the existence in causation (en’u) or the existence caused byignorance (mōu). It cannot be labeled by such words as subject and object, oressence and form.… In the entire universe there is not even a single objectalien to Buddha-nature, nor is there any second existence other than thisuniverse here and now.73 [notes.html#ch4_73]Dōgen was emphatic in rejecting all existence as conceived in terms of action asa means to spiritual advance (gō-zōjōriki), delusory dependent origination(mō-engi), spontaneous generation (hōni), or the practice and enlightenmentthrough supranormal powers (jinzū-shushō).74 [notes.html#ch4_74] Not only wasBuddha-nature not existence with a beginning, as we have seen, but it was alsonot existence with no beginning (mushiu).75 [notes.html#ch4_75]It is evident in these observations that by declaring “all existence isBuddha-nature,” Dōgen presented a new theory of Buddha-nature consistent withhis general theory of mind. To put it differently, Dōgen radically transformedthe predominantly psychological conception of Buddha-nature into a predominantlyontological and soteriological one whereby it was equated with, and hence usedsynonymously with, thusness (tathatā; shinnyo) and Dharmanature (dharmatā;hosshō), which in Buddhist thought referred to the impersonal ground of being orultimate reality. Buddha-nature, in Dōgen’s view, was at once beings and beingitself.76 [notes.html#ch4_76]Buddha-nature was all existence which included sentient and insentient beings,and was no longer the possession of these beings. As a result, the unlimitedinclusiveness of Buddha-nature did not mean that Buddha-nature was immanent inall existences but that all existence was vibrant with Buddha-nature. As wecompare this with the traditional psychologically minded view of Buddha-nature,we can easily see the original nature of his reconception of this notion.Obviously “all existence is Buddha-nature” should not be construed as a mereformal identity. The dynamic relationship between Buddha-nature and allexistence was expressed in a slightly different context as follows: “Though notidentical, they are not different; though not different, they are not one;though not one, they are not many.”77 [notes.html#ch4_77] This was Dōgen’s (andhence Buddhism’s) way of expressing the nonduality of beings and being itself,in terms of “neither identical nor different” or “neither one nor many”(fuitsu-fui or fusoku-furi) or the Hua-yen principle of “mutual identity andmutual penetration” (sōsoku-sōnyū). Thus, it is a gross mistake for us to equatehis thought with pantheism, for Buddha-nature is more than the de facto sum ofall beings and more than the naive identity of the Absolute and the relative, orof the necessary and the contingent.78 [notes.html#ch4_78]Since we have considered thus far the proposition “all existence isBuddha-nature,” we shall now examine Dōgen’s equation of all existence with allsentient beings. Along with his extension of the meaning of Buddha-nature, Dōgenalso extended the meaning of sentient beings (shujō). He argued:We use such names as shujō, ujō, gunjō, and gunrui. The expression “allexistence” refers to both sentient beings and all beings. That is, all existenceis Buddha-nature, and the totality of all existence is called sentient beings.Right at the time [of such realization], both the inside and outside of sentientbeings are, as such, all existence as Buddha-nature.79 [notes.html#ch4_79]Furthermore, Dōgen stated: “Just as no realm exists outside the triple world, sothere exists no being other than the sentient.”80 [notes.html#ch4_80] While thewords “sentient beings” (sattva; shujō) ordinarily referred to all living beingswho transmigrated in the six realms of life (the worlds of hell, hungry spirits,animals, asuras, humans, and gods), in the Buddhist scheme, it may haveoriginally meant whatever was generated by the dependent origination ofconditions and forces of the universe; accordingly, the words may have includednot only sentient beings but also insentient beings.81 [notes.html#ch4_81] Dōgenwas aware of this broad sense when he wrote: “Sentient beings are the true bodyof the entire universe. For the reason that each sentient being comes intoexistence through [the co-creation of] myriad things, it is called ‘sentientbeing.’ ”82 [notes.html#ch4_82] Thus Dōgen proposed that Buddhism adopt theoriginal (indeed the broadest possible) sense of the notion.However, deeper than this etymological awareness was the demand made by thelogic of his thought, especially regarding his view of mind. Dōgen’s reasoningon this point was clearly stated as follows:“All sentient beings,” discussed now in the Buddha-way, means all beingspossessing mind, for mind is itself sentient beings. Those beings not possessingmind (mushinsha) should equally be sentient beings, because sentient beings are,as such, mind. Therefore, mind is invariably sentient beings; sentient beingsare necessarily the Buddha-nature of existence (u-busshō). Grasses and trees,and countries and lands are mind. They are sentient beings by virtue of beingmind, and are the Buddha-nature of existence on account of being sentientbeings. The sun, the moon, and the stars—all are mind. They are sentient beingsby reason of being mind, and are the Buddha-nature of existence because of beingsentient beings.83 [notes.html#ch4_83]By defining sentient beings in this way, Dōgen presented two propositions: allexistence is sentient beings and sentient beings are Buddha-nature. The nondualoneness of all existence, sentient beings, and Buddha-nature is complete. Thisis neither a merely arbitrary redefinition of the words, nor a mere conformityto the original senses of them; it is rather the result of the logical demandmade by his thought, deeply rooted in his radical reconception of mind and ofBuddha-nature. It is important to note Dōgen’s vehementde-anthropocentricization and de-biocentricization of the originallyanthropocentric and biocentric notion of sentient beings.84 [notes.html#ch4_84]We might call this Dōgen’s way of demythologizing, in which we cannot fail torecognize his rigorous exercise of logic and reason (dōri) in a uniquelyBuddhist way.It is evident through the foregoing observations of Dōgen’s fundamentalproposition, “all existence (i.e., all sentient beings) is Buddha-nature,” thatnot only is Buddha-nature not an embryo nor a seed, but it is not a Platonic“receptacle” or Newtonian “absolute space” either (the tathāgata-garbha itselfwas highly vulnerable to such interpretations). Buddha-nature has no wall, nocircumference, and no compartment in which all existence, or sentient beings, is“contained.”85 [notes.html#ch4_85] As the proposition says, all existence isBuddha-nature itself, although there is some distinction between them. Thisnondual “oneness” is generally expressed within Buddhism, as I have alreadynoted, in terms of “neither identical nor different”; the structure of thisnondual relation in Dōgen’s own thought will become clearer in subsequent pages.Having set forth these preliminary remarks, we shall now proceed to a detailedanalysis of Dōgen’s theory of Buddha-nature.All existence and phenomena are the activities (gyōji) and expressions(dōtoku)—respectively, the self-activities and the self-expressions—ofBuddha-nature. These self-activities and self-expressions, however, must beunderstood in the context of Dōgen’s own conceptions of “all things themselvesare ultimate reality” (shohō-jissō) and “the kōan realized in life”(genjō-kōan), which I have touched upon in connection with his theory of mind;they are not emanationistic manifestations, cosmological processes, or the like,but are the soteriological realization of things as they are in thusness.Addressing himself to the embryological argument concerning Buddha-nature, Dōgenwrote:A certain group of people think that Buddha-nature is like a seed of a grass orplant. When the rain moistens it generously, buds and stems grow, branches,leaves, and fruits become dense, and eventually the fruits bear seeds. Such aview is what an ordinary person imagines. Supposing that you understand thematter this way, you should still realize that the seeds, the flowers, and thefruits are each the unadulterated mind itself (jōjō no sekishin). A fruit seed,though unseen, produces roots and stems and, though not brought together fromelsewhere, flourishes with a thick trunk and big branches. This has nothing todo with something inside or outside, and yet, it is true throughout the ages.For this reason, even if an ordinary person’s approach is taken [for the sake ofargument], the roots, stems, branches, and leaves all live the same life and alldie the same death; they are equally one and the same Buddha-nature of allexistence.86 [notes.html#ch4_86]Perhaps the full implications of this thesis will be understood adequately oncewe examine Dōgen’s view of existence and time (uji), as we will later in thischapter. Suffice it to say that the self-realization of Buddha-nature in itsmyriad forms of existence defies the model of processes, degrees, and levelsfrom potentiality to actuality, from the hidden to the manifest, from the lowerto the higher, from the imperfect to the perfect. In contrast, it is therealization that each form of existence is whole and self-sufficient in its“total exertion” (gūjin) in the Dharma-position (hōi), which amounts to thetotal actualization of Buddha-nature. Hence, processes, degrees, and levels arethose actualities which are arranged conveniently in a linear fashion. That iswhy Dōgen said, in reference to Bodhidharma’s “skin, flesh, bones, and marrow”(hiniku-kotsuzui), that “Marrow is not deepest, skin is not shallowest.”87[notes.html#ch4_87] To put it differently, Dōgen was concerned not with how andwhy all existence was as it was, but simply with the fact that all existenceexisted in thusness—he found Buddha-nature in this fact. It was in this sensethat Dōgen used “the Buddha-nature of existence” (u-busshō) by which he meantthat Buddha-nature was always, and necessarily, particularized in concreteexistence. Without understanding this aspect of Buddha-nature, the study of theWay was not complete.88 [notes.html#ch4_88]All existence as particularities was necessarily limited and circumscribed, andhence vulnerable to similar dangers inherent in all forms of phenomenalisticthought. Dōgen thus warned:We do not say “all sentient beings are Buddha-nature” (issai-shujō soku busshō)[for even “are” smacks of dualistic thinking], but instead“all-sentient-beings-the-Buddha-nature-of-existence” (issai-shujō-u-busshō).This should be considered carefully. The “existence” of “the Buddha-nature ofexistence” should indeed be cast off. Casting off is all-pervasive andall-pervasive means [leaving no traces like] a bird’s path in flight. Therefore,[it should be expressed as] “all-Buddha-nature-existence-sentient-beings”(issai-busshō-u-shujō). The truth of the matter is that you elucidate andpenetrate not only sentient beings but also Buddha-nature.89 [notes.html#ch4_89]Clearly, Dōgen recommended penetrating the ordinary dualistic mode of existence.Buddha-nature has an aspect called the Buddha-nature of nonexistence (mu-busshō)that negates and further penetrates concrete realities. Mu-busshō istraditionally understood in Buddhism to signify the absence of Buddha-nature,analogous to a nonbeing that is antithetical to being. But according to Dōgen,inasmuch as all existence was Buddha-nature, the nonexistence in question couldnot and should not mean the absence of Buddha-nature. The Buddha-nature ofnonexistence meant, rather, the liberating and penetrating powers ofBuddha-nature that liberated us from fixation on the particularities ofexistence. In thus transforming the traditional Buddhist terms in a mannerconsistent with his thought, Dōgen shifted the direction of the issue fromwhether or not any existence has Buddha-nature to how it can use (shitoku suru)Buddha-nature in the midst of its presence. Thus, Dōgen devoted a great deal ofeffort to clarifying the Buddha-nature of nonexistence, without the study ofwhich, he contended, the Way could not be fully understood.90[notes.html#ch4_90]The inner structure of Buddha-nature has the element of nonexistence, not as adualistic antithesis to existence, but as one of the poles in the nondualstructure. This view was unmistakably evidenced in the kōan in which Chao-chouTs’ung-shên (778–897) answered both yes and no on different occasions to awell-known question concerning whether the dog has Buddha-nature. The story goessomething like this: In response to Chao-chou’s “No,” a monastic once asked,“All sentient beings have Buddha-nature, but why doesn’t the dog haveBuddha-nature?” Chao-chou answered, “Because the dog has karmic consciousness.”In another case, in response to Chao-chou’s “Yes,” a monastic asked, “IfBuddha-nature already exists, why does Buddha-nature enter this skin-bag?”Chao-chou answered: “Because the dog transgresses knowingly.”91[notes.html#ch4_91] Dōgen’s comments on the kōan repudiated every possibleimplication derived from the literal and dualistic interpretation of Chao-chou’sanswers and held in effect that the dog’s karmic existence and its knowingtrangression were, paradoxically enough, themselves the thusness ofBuddha-nature. The because in Chao-chou’s answers did not signify, according toDōgen’s interpretation, the causal relationship as ordinarily interpreted. Theproblem, therefore, was not whether the dog had Buddha-nature or not, which wasthe conventional assumption. Rather, both answers of yes and no, or existenceand nonexistence, were construed as nondual structural elements ofBuddha-nature; each had its ultimate significance and value in Buddha-nature.92[notes.html#ch4_92]It was in this vein that Dōgen said:How could the existence (u) of “all existence is Buddha-nature” not result inthe nonexistence (mu) of ultimate nonexistence (mumu)?… Regarding the existenceor nonexistence [of Buddha-nature], set aside nonexistence for awhile and askyourself instead what Buddha-nature is like. Question what sort of thingBuddha-nature is. When some people nowadays hear the words “Buddha-nature,” theynever inquire about what it is but seem concerned only with the meaning of itsexistence or nonexistence. This is pointless indeed. Nonexistence in its variousforms should be studied in light of that nonexistence which is the Buddha-natureof nonexistence.93 [notes.html#ch4_93]What Dōgen tried to emphasize with the term “Buddha-nature of nonexistence” isthe emptiness of Buddha-nature, or the Buddha-nature of emptiness (kū-busshō),which at once subsumed and transcended existence and nonexistence. In hisdiscourse on Buddha-nature, nonexistence (mu) and emptiness (kū) wenthand-in-hand; the former was always spoken of in terms of the latter.On the subject of emptiness, Dōgen emphasized, as I have pointed out elsewhere,the dynamic and creative aspects rather than the static and transcendent aspectsof this cardinal idea. He also emphasized the Mahāyāna Buddhist idea ofdependent origination, which held that existence was mediated, purified, andauthenticated by emptiness and was therefore called wondrous existence(shinkū-myōu). Dōgen’s view of emptiness pursued this direction rigorously.94[notes.html#ch4_94] Just one example of this will suffice. There is a Zen storyinvolving two Zen teachers, Shih-kung Hui-tsang and Hsi-t’ang Chih-tsang, bothof whom were the disciples of Ma-tsu Tao-i (709–788). One day Shih-kung askedHsi-t’ang: “Can you grasp emptiness?” Hsi-t’ang replied: “Yes, I think I can.”Shih-kung continued: “How would you grasp emptiness?” Using his hand, Hsi-t’angthen grasped at empty space. Shih-kung retorted: “You don’t understand how tohold emptiness.” “Then how do you do it?” asked Hsi-t’ang. Shih-kung seizedHsi-t’ang’s nose and pulled it. Hsi-t’ang exclaimed: “Ouch! Ouch! You are goingto pull off my nose!” Shih-kung said: “You can grasp emptiness only in thisway.”95 [notes.html#ch4_95] Commenting on this kōan, Dōgen observed that thatwhich grasps and that which is grasped are, after all, one and the sameemptiness—emptiness grasps emptiness. Dōgen asserted that it might have beenmore appropriate had Shih-kung grasped his own nose. Despite this, Dōgen praisedShih-kung for his understanding of the mystery of emptiness and admonished hisdisciples as follows: “Even if you are adept at grasping emptiness, you shouldstudy its inside and outside, investigate its life and death, and appreciate itsweight.”96 [notes.html#ch4_96]Let us pursue Dōgen’s view of Buddha-nature as emptiness a little further alongthis line of thought. Dōgen, like other Zen Buddhists, was fond of using suchinterrogative pronouns as “what,” “how,” and “that,” (nani, ga, ka, nanimono, shimo, somo, immo, etc.) to denote the ultimate truth of thusness and emptiness.For example:Teacher Ta-chien [Hui-nêng] of Mt. Ts’ao-ch’i once asked Nan-yüeh Ta-hui: “Whatis this that comes thus?”This saying [containing] “thus” is not actually an interrogation since ittranscends human understanding. We should thoroughly investigate the fact thatbecause “this” [particularity] is the “What,” all things are always the “What”and each and every thing is the “What.” The “What” is not an interrogative; itis the “coming of thusness.”97 [notes.html#ch4_97]In asking the question “What is this that comes thus?” we already know that theanswer to “What” is “this that comes thus.” In this respect, to question is toknow, because “What” is “thusness” (monsho no dōtoku). To put it differently,the What is the eternal kōan realized in life (genjō-kōan); this theme wasexpanded and elaborated upon in Dōgen’s discourse on Buddha-nature when he tookup the conversation between Ta-i Tao-hsin (580–651), the fourth ancestor ofChinese Zen Buddhism, and Ta-man Hung-jên (601–674), the fifth ancestor, whichran as follows: On the way to Mt. Huang-mêi, Hung-jên met Tao-hsin, and thelatter asked: “What is your name?” Hung-jên replied: “Although I have a name, itis not an ordinary one.” “What is it?” the teacher asked. “It is Buddha-nature”was the answer. Then Tao-hsin said: “You do not have Buddha-nature.” Hung-jênresponded thus: “Because Buddha-nature is empty (kū), it is called nonexistence(mu).”98 [notes.html#ch4_98] Once again Dōgen probed deeply into Buddha-natureby giving an extraordinary interpretation of this story. He explained:When we examine the story of the two ancestors, there is profound meaning in thefourth ancestor’s question, “What is your name?” In ancient times there werepersons from the country of Ho, as well as persons with the surname of Ho. [Thereal purport of this interrogative statement is an affirmative statement, andthus] to say “Your name is Ho” is just like saying “I am thusness and you arethusness as well.” [You and I belong to the same family of Buddha.]99[notes.html#ch4_99]Since the Chinese character ho (the Japanese rendering is nani or ka) has themeaning of “what,” “your name is Ho” means “your name is What.” Thus, accordingto Dōgen’s interpretation, Tao-hsin’s statement revealed his understanding ofthe nature of one’s “name” (shō)—an eternal question mark of What—which was atthe same time one’s “nature” (shō), that is, Buddha-nature (busshō). In a veryspecial sense, name was nature. All existence had the same family name of Ho orWhat, which was the essence of Buddha-nature. (This was more significant inlight of the fact that Hung-jên’s real surname was Chou.)From this vantage point, Dōgen developed his remarkable interpretation ofemptiness in relation to name: “The fifth ancestor said: [‘Although I have aname, it is not an ordinary one,’ which means] ‘Name’ is ‘existence-itself,’‘not-this,’ and ‘ordinary-name-as-permanent-nature.’ Its import is that‘Existence as name-nature’ is not an ‘ordinary name’; an ‘ordinary name’ is notadequate to this ‘existence-itself.’ ”100 [notes.html#ch4_100] Dōgen’sinterpretation did not deny the significance of an ordinary name. On thecontrary, name as an ordinary name became an extraordinary one only when it wasmediated and authenticated by Buddha-nature. It was in this sense that the nameof Chou—the real surname of the fifth ancestor—“[was] not received from hisfather or from his ancestors, nor [did] it resemble the name of his mother, letalone any other person’s name.”101 [notes.html#ch4_101] Dōgen further developedhis view in a truly extraordinary manner:The fourth ancestor said: [“What (name) is it?” which means] “ ‘This’ (ze) isthe ‘name-nature’ (shō) of ‘What’ (ka).” “What” is “this” and it has beenexerting “this” as “What” (ze o kashi kitareri). Such is “name-nature.” Thatwhich makes “What” what it is does so by virtue of “this.” That which makes“this” what it is is the power of “What.” “Name-nature” is “this” and “What” atonce. We brew herbal tea with this [realization]; so do we with ordinary tea. Wealso make [this realization] our everyday meal. The fifth ancestor said: “it (orthis)is Buddha-nature,” in which “this” is in itself “Buddha-nature.” Because of“What,” it is “Buddha.” Yet, can we profoundly grasp “this” by “What” and“name-nature” alone? When “this” is unmistakably “not-this,” it is“Buddha-nature.” Such being the case, “this” is “What” and “Buddha”;nevertheless, once it has cast off and liberated itself, it is bound to be“name.” [In the case of the fifth ancestor], that name was Chou.102[notes.html#ch4_102]Dōgen lifted “what,” “this,” and “name” out of the ordinary context of the twoancestors’ dialogues and elevated them to the height of philosophical analysisof and insight into Buddha-nature. He did so not in a speculative spirit but ina deeply personal, existential, and practical mode of thought. Thus, the dynamiccreativity of the Buddha-nature of emptiness was ingeniously characterized inthe context of the following: “What,” as the eternal quest or kōan realized inlife, which showed us the abysmal depths and mysteries of existence withinfinite possibilities; “this,” the particular concretization of existence inthusness in which “What” unfolded ever anew; and “name,” the linguistic andsymbolic mediation by virtue of which “What” was “this” and “this” was “What.”“What,” “this,” and “name” were each the total exertion (gūjin) of theBuddha-nature of emptiness in the Dharma-position. Dōgen observed:The emptiness in question is not that emptiness which is spoken of in “form isemptiness” (shikisoku-zekū). Regarding “form is emptiness,” you do notartificially designate form as emptiness, nor do you construct form by dividingemptiness. [What I mean] is emptiness in “emptiness is emptiness” (kū-ze-kū).The emptiness of “emptiness is emptiness” means that in the realization ofemptiness, there is nothing but emptiness.103 [notes.html#ch4_103]When emptiness was totally exerted, there was only emptiness; when form wastotally exerted, there was only form.104 [notes.html#ch4_104] In this manner,the principle of the “total exertion of a single thing” (ippō-gūjin) applied toeverything—eating, sleeping, laughing, and whatnot. The wondrous existence ofthis emptiness (shinkū-myōu) meant, for Dōgen, precisely the total exertion of asingle thing that abided in the Dharma-position. “Nothing but,” in this context,did not imply by any means a reductionistic mode of thinking; on the contrary,herein lay the crux of Dōgen’s mystical realism—his solution, in generalphilosophical terms, to the perennial metaphysical problem of the relationbetween Buddha-nature and all existence, between one and many, between theAbsolute and the relative.Buddhism generally defies the view that Buddha-nature is identical with, or inproportion to, or nothing but, all existence, as well as the view thatBuddha-nature is something other than, or transcendent to, or inclusive of, allexistence. Instead it takes recourse in the notion of emptiness, makingreference to “neither identical nor different,” “neither one nor many,” and soforth. This is not a flight from linguistic commitment, but an awareness of thenature and limitations of it, which frees and authenticates the use of such acommitment. From Dōgen’s standpoint, however, these dicta still smacked of anabstract formalism. The mystery or paradox of “all existence is Buddha-nature”(or of one and many) was experientially and practically verified and enacted,though it still remained unresolved (perhaps never to be resolved),theoretically. (Once again, this did not mean that Dōgen went as far as he couldintellectually, letting experience take over the remainder, for intellect didnot leave room for experience, intuition, or faith.) At each moment ofexistence, reason (dōri) went hand-in-hand with expressions and activities so asto exert totally. Thus, in the realization of life there was nothing but life;in the realization of death there was nothing but death. When there was nothingbut life, life became meaningless, since it was meaningful only in view ofdeath. By the same token, when there was nothing but Buddha-nature, it was nil,empty, and meaningless. In this total meaninglessness, Dōgen found the reasonand logic of “all existence is Buddha-nature.”105 [notes.html#ch4_105]As I have noted, all existence is the expressions (dōtoku) and activities(gyōji) of Buddha-nature. The expressions and activities of Buddha-natureincessantly arise and perish moment by moment. Being impermanent, existence isnecessarily temporal. Thus far we have examined the Buddha-nature of existence,the Buddha-nature of nonexistence, and the Buddha-nature of emptiness, andthereby glimpsed into Dōgen’s view of Buddha-nature, which was the core of hisphilosophical and religious thought. Dōgen’s analysis of the matter, however,did not stop at this. For him, the creative dynamism of Buddha-nature had to befurther probed in connection with the Buddha-nature of expression(setsu-busshō), the Buddha-nature of activity (gyōbusshō), the Buddha-nature ofimpermanence (mujō-busshō), and the Buddha-nature of time (ji-busshō).106[notes.html#ch4_106]In a slightly different context concerning the problem of mind, Dōgen had thisto say: “There is no expression (setsu) that is not essence (shō); there is nomind (shin) that is not expression.”107 [notes.html#ch4_107] The usualdistinction between the mind and its essence or between essence (shō) and form(sō)—along with the presupposition that one is eternal and unchangeable whilethe other is phenomenal and changeable—was challenged here. However, moreimportant, with regard to the present subject matter, both mind and its essencewere invariably the expression, or more precisely the self-expression (jidōshu),of Buddha-nature. There was no expression that was not Buddha-nature and viceversa. As I have emphasized earlier in this work, expression was ultimately theimpossible task made possible. This paradoxical situation, with which everypossible expression was confronted, was well stated in the following quote, inwhich Dōgen referred to Po-chang Huai-hai’s statement, “If you say sentientbeings have Buddha-nature, you slander Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha; if you saysentient beings have no Buddha-nature, you slander Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha aswell”:Therefore, the Buddha-nature of existence and the Buddha-nature ofnonexistence—both are equally disparaging. However disparaging they may be, youcannot avoid uttering them.… Indeed, disparaging utterances may be made, and yetdid you or did you not express Buddha-nature therewith? If you did, yourexpression is itself Buddha-nature. Where there is one who speaks, there is alsoone who hears. [Both the speaker and the hearer are of Buddha-nature.]108[notes.html#ch4_108]In Dōgen’s thought, language and symbols were not always necessary evils (as“disparaging utterances” might suggest), but could be used in such ways as tomake them expressions of Buddha-nature. Giving positive significance toexpressions, Dōgen also contended, in reference to Nāgārjuna’s discourse onBuddha-nature and Kāṇadeva’s interpretation of it, that Buddha-nature beyondforms, qualities, and measures was realized in and through bodily activities andexpressions. This was called the bodily realization of Buddha-nature (shingen)which was boundless (kakunen) and transparent (komei), as characterized byKāṇadeva.109 [notes.html#ch4_109] Language and symbols were inseparablyintertwined with bodily expressions, and together constituted the realization ofBuddha-nature, in the sense that a particular concretization of expression wasnot one being among many but the being, as in the total presence ofBuddha-nature in the metaphor of the full moon, a symbol of enlightenment.110[notes.html#ch4_110]Expression was necessarily activity and activity was necessarily expression. Anexpression was not a theory or an abstraction, but an activity—to see,understand, and express Buddha-nature was tantamount to acting outBuddha-nature. Thus, we see the necessary connection between the Buddha-natureof expression and the Buddha-nature of activity. With the following statement,Dōgen began his exposition on time and existence:A Buddha said: “If you want to know the meaning of Buddha-nature, you shouldreflect upon temporal conditions (jisetsu no innen). If the time arrives,Buddha-nature will manifest itself.” “If you want to know the meaning ofBuddha-nature” is not solely a matter of knowing. You can also say: “If you wantto practice it …” “If you want to realize it …” “If you want to elucidate it …”“If you want to forget it …” and so on.111 [notes.html#ch4_111]Another of Dōgen’s remarks is pertinent to our discussion:To say “if the time arrives” is tantamount to declaring that the time hasalready arrived; how can you doubt this? You may entertain a doubt about thetime. Be that as it may, witness Buddha-nature’s arrival. You should know that“if the time arrives,” [as understood in this manner,] every moment of thetwenty-four hours of the day does not pass by in vain. The “if-arrives”(nyakushi) is construed as the “already-arrived” (kishi). [Otherwise,] “if thetime arrives” would mean “Buddha-nature never arrives.” For this reason, sincethe time has already arrived, Buddha-nature is unmistakably present here andnow.112 [notes.html#ch4_112]If we consider this statement, along with the seed analogy discussed before,Dōgen’s position is evident. Buddha-nature actualized itself not in such ways asfrom potentiality to actuality, from the not-yet to the already, from the lowerto the higher, from the hidden to the manifest—but rather, Buddha-nature wasalways coeval and coessential with what we acted out in our activities andexpressions. In light of this, Dōgen’s paradoxical statement quoted earliermakes sense: “The truth of Buddha-nature is such that Buddha-nature is embodiednot before but after becoming a Buddha (jōbutsu). Buddha-nature and becoming aBuddha always occur simultaneously.”113 [notes.html#ch4_113] Being Buddha andbecoming Buddha (i.e. original enlightenment and acquired enlightenment),although distinct, occurred simultaneously. To the extent that we took riskswhen we chose to act, Buddha-nature became visible, audible, and tangible. Untilthis happened, Buddha-nature could not be said to exist or subsist in such formsas potentialities, innate ideas, and eidetic forms.The Buddha-nature of expression and the Buddha-nature of activity wereinevitably impermanent and temporal, and ultimately led to death. There was noway out of this ultimate limitation. Thus, Dōgen expounded the Buddha-nature ofimpermanence (mujō-busshō): If the world was as fleeting and transient as themorning dew, and this was not a mere sentiment but a fact of life, then how wasone to commit oneself to specific expressions and activities so that they weresimultaneously one’s self-realization and self-expression of Buddha-nature? Thiswas the ultimate question that concerned Dōgen throughout his life, as has beenpointed out so often in this work. For Dōgen, it was not a matter of whether tocommit, but how to commit—that is, how to make a specific commitment in completefreedom. In his analysis of the Buddha-nature of impermanence, Dōgen challengedthe conventional idea that Buddha-nature was permanent (ujō), and thatreligiosity consisted in seeking and attaining such permanence by departing fromimpermanence; consequently, he asserted that impermanence was Buddha-nature, andvice versa. Referring to Hui-nêng’s saying, Dōgen observed:The sixth ancestor [Hui-nêng] once said to his disciple, Hsing-ch’ang:“Impermanence is Buddha-nature. Permanence is the mind that discriminates goodand evil and all things.”The “impermanence” the sixth ancestor speaks of is not like what thenon-Buddhists and those of the Lesser Vehicle conjecture. Although theirfounders and followers talk about impermanence, they fail to penetrate itthoroughly. Accordingly, impermanence expounds itself, enacts itself, andverifies itself—all these are impermanent. Those who now manifest themselves tosave others are manifesting themselves [in their myriad forms of impermanence]so as to expound Dharma for others. Such is Buddha-nature. Sometimes theydisplay a long Dharma-body, and sometimes a short Dharma-body. A sage who isperpetually sagely is impermanent; an ordinary person who is constantly deludedis also impermanent. The unchangeability of both sagacity and delusion shouldnot be Buddha-nature.114 [notes.html#ch4_114]Hui-nêng’s statement was not only in opposition to the conventional view ofBuddha-nature as permanent and the discriminating mind as impermanent, but couldhave been interpreted as saying that permanence and impermanence were mutuallyexclusive. Dōgen, however, interpreted it as saying that permanence andimpermanence were equally Buddha-nature, for “permanence” according to him wasthe state of “nonturning” (miten) or nonduality. As Dōgen said: “Nonturningmeans that whether we overcome delusions or are conditioned by them, we arenever attached to the traces of their coming and going. Hence, this is calledpermanence.”115 [notes.html#ch4_115] Dōgen accepted Hui-nêng’s notion thatBuddha-nature was impermanent, but also reconciled permanence and impermanence,and Buddha-nature and the discriminating mind. The following, then, can beunderstood in this context in which impermanence and nonduality have been fused:On this account, plants and trees, and thicket and forest are impermanent; assuch, they are Buddha-nature. Humans and things, and bodies and minds areimpermanent; thus, they are Buddha-nature. Countries and lands, and mountainsand rivers are impermanent because they are Buddha-nature. Supremeenlightenment, because it is Buddha-nature, is impermanent. The perfect quietudeof nirvāṇa, because it is impermanent, is Buddha-nature.116 [notes.html#ch4_116]“Everything perishes as soon as it arises” (setsuna-shōmetsu) is a well-knownassertion in Buddhism. The corollary is that nothing in the universe remainsunchanged and unchangeable. Despite this metaphysical insight into the scheme ofthings, Buddhists, more often than not, have betrayed it by excepting ultimatereality from this principle. It seems to be an almost universal philosophicaltemptation (in both the East and West) to revere “being” by degrading“becoming.” For Dōgen’s part, he refused to exempt Buddha-nature. Theuniversality of the momentariness of arising and perishing had to be applied toBuddha-nature as well. Hence, Buddha-nature was impermanent.This thought was vividly expressed in the metaphors “the blue mountain alwayswalks” (seizan jō-umpo) and “the Eastern Mountain moves on the water” (tōzansuijō-kō).117 [notes.html#ch4_117] The mountain—regarded as immovable—was saidhere to be walking and moving, thus alluding to the fact that nothing in theuniverse was static and immutable; the universe was becoming in time.118[notes.html#ch4_118] The impermanence of Buddha-nature was that aspect ofBuddha-nature which eternally came in and out of being with the universe and allexistence within it. At any given moment, it pulsated with the arising andperishing of the universe, in accordance with the infinitely intricate dependentorigination of its constituents. Buddha-nature gave birth to a new creationmoment by moment and shared its fate with the universe. Being and becoming werenot two separate metaphysical realities but one and the same in the process ofimpermanence. The religious and philosophical significance of impermanence wasthe infinite versatility and dynamism of Buddha-nature in its ever-changing andever-becoming character.119 [notes.html#ch4_119]Dōgen’s primary concern was with the religious implications of the Buddha-natureof impermanence. As he probed the ethos of impermanence, thoroughly indigenizedby the medieval Japanese mind, Dōgen did not indulge in aesthetic dilettantismand sentimentalism as a way to escape from the fleeting fate of life. He insteadexamined the nature of impermanence and its ultimate companion, death,unflinchingly, attempting to realize liberation in and through this inexorablescheme of things. In his view, things, events, and relationships were not thegiven (i.e., entities), but were possibilities, projects, and tasks that couldbe lived out, expressed, and understood as selfexpressions and self-activitiesof Buddha-nature. This did not imply a complacent acceptance of the givensituation, rather it required strenuous efforts to transform and transfigure it.Dōgen’s thought involved this element of transformation, which has been moreoften than not grossly neglected or dismissed by Dōgen students.120[notes.html#ch4_120] His search for the reason of impermanence impelled him toradically live the duality of impermanence and temporality by being liberatedfor the sake of duality.Dōgen’s entire philosophical and religious work was a testimonial to hispassionate search for those possibilities and tasks in his own time—through theuse of symbols, rites, and concepts available in his inherited Buddhisttradition. He composed his abstruse philosophical prose in the medieval Japanesestyle, only occasionally using the classic Chinese style. This fact aloneuniquely positions Dōgen in the history of Japanese thought, for he sought thereason of impermanence through the Japanese language and in the Japanesemanner.121 [notes.html#ch4_121]Our analysis of impermanence will now continue, by delving into the problem oftemporality, which was the culmination of Dōgen’s metaphysics and religion ofBuddha-nature.EXISTENCE AND TIME [toc.html#ch4_h2_4]Buddhism has maintained throughout its history that everything in the universearises, changes, and perishes, and that there is nothing that is not subject toimpermanence and death. An ardent Buddhist, Dōgen inherited this sense of theimpermanence of existence, but the quality of his awareness was medievalJapanese to its core in intensity and content. The age was deeply troubled,hopeless, and characterized as the Age of Degenerate Law; people despaired ofthe world and life and retreated into their own egotistical shells to pursuetheir various diversions. Life was nothing but fleeting, wearisome, and empty(hakanaki or hakanashi). These psychological states are said to have resultedfrom an inner failure to cope with the pace of a rapidly changing world. Thepeople’s sense of despair and emptiness was their internalization of thisfailure.122 [notes.html#ch4_122] Dōgen rejected this psychological orsubjectivized view of impermanence (which was dualistic after all), seeinginstead that impermanence was structurally inherent in the self and the world,and hence should be taken seriously—metaphysically and religiously. Only thenwas one assured of understanding and living the reality of impermanence.123[notes.html#ch4_123]At this point in our investigation, I shall briefly digress to review thedevelopment of some salient aspects of the problem of time in the history ofBuddhist thought. The problem of time was an essential part of Buddhist thoughtfrom its very inception, as evidenced in the doctrine of the impermanence ormomentariness of all things, which was one of the three characteristics ofexistence (the other two being suffering and nonsubstantiality), and in thedoctrine of moral causation and rebirth for the three periods of past, present,and future.124 [notes.html#ch4_124] The fundamental assumptions that ran throughthe history of mainstream Buddhist thought in relation to the problem of timewere twofold. One was characterized by the proposition: “Time has no independentexistence but is dependent on dharmas” (jimubettai-ehōjiryū); the other wasrelated to the mutual implication of space and time—the flow of events andvicissitude of things as they occurred in the world—clearly indicated by theword se (used in, e.g., sanze, “three periods”—the ze here is a corrupted formof the se), which meant both “period” and “world.”125 [notes.html#ch4_125] Itgoes without saying that these two assumptions were deeply rooted in thedoctrines of nonsubstantiality and dependent origination. Time was notconsidered a self-same entity but was construed invariably as the bearer ofevents of the self and the world; in brief, events did not move in time but weretime.126 [notes.html#ch4_126]Various formulations and issues regarding time evolved with the history ofBuddhism. One of the most prominent controversies in early Buddhism involved thecontrasting views of the Sarvāstivādin and the Sautrāntika. The former believedthat the three periods (the past, present, and future) were realities and thatdharmas did not change; the latter held that the past and the future were notrealities—only the present was real—and although the past was that which onceexisted and the future was yet to exist, the present contained the past and thefuture in some way. Both schools concurred on the reality of the present, butdiffered on the reality of the past and future in relation to the present.127[notes.html#ch4_127]The Vijñānavādin’s view consisted of the thesis that the manifestation(abhisaṃskāra; gengyō) arising from an original seed (bīja; shūji) instoreconsciousness (ālaya-vijñāna; arayashiki), and the “perfuming” (vāsanā;kunjū), or projection of a new seed into store-consciousness, took placesimultaneously. Thus, this view held that the “causal” relationship between theprocesses of the original seed producing its manifestation and of themanifestation perfuming the new seed was simultaneous in the present; that is tosay, cause-effect arose and perished in the same moment of the present. Theprocess repeated itself ad infinitum in a succession of such “presents.” In thisrespect, each present embraced the past and future in the form of seeds instore-consciousness.128 [notes.html#ch4_128]The Mādhyamika philosophy of Nāgārjuna viewed dharmas as empty and unattainable,hence the so-called three periods had no existence of their own. Time was but amental construction, yet this fact did not lead us into bondage with it.129[notes.html#ch4_129]The foregoing observations point to a gradual evolution of Buddhistconsciousness that probed the structure of the present in which the essence oftime lay and in which the past and future were somehow contained. Both theSarvāstivādin and the Sautrāntika analyzed the three periods but did not clarifythe nature of the present sufficiently. The Vijñānavāda view provided apsychological solution that offered profound insights into the mystery of ourunconscious strivings and aspirations, both personal and collective. Yet itremained idealistic, neglecting the significance of the world in the structureof the present. The Mādhyamika view radically rejected time as nothing butabsurd. (This negativism, however, should not obscure the other side of theBuddhist idea of emptiness—namely, the creative and dynamic aspects.)The implications of this evolution were developed in Hua-yen philosophy, alongwith other insights from various schools of Buddhism. In Hua-yen thought, we seephilosophical and religious efforts taking into account both the self and theworld in the consideration of time. Hua-yen thought uniquely interpreted theDharma-realm (dharma-dhātu; hokkai) in terms of the principle of thenonobstruction of all phenomena (shih-shih wu-ai; jijimuge).130[notes.html#ch4_130] The entire universe consisted of creative processes inwhich the multiplicity of things and events interacted with and interpenetratedone another without obstruction. Particularities were not obliterated ordeficient in any way, yet were unhindered in the perfect harmony of the totalDharmarealm. This nonobstruction (muge) was possible through the mediation ofemptiness. This grand cosmic process of interaction, interpenetration, andintegration in all realms, dimensions, perspectives of the self and the worldwent on endlessly (jūjū-mujin).131 [notes.html#ch4_131]This ontology obviously avoided the reductionism of phenomena as well as thereductionism of principles. Moreover, it regarded even the perfect harmony ofprinciples and phenomena as merely an expediency for the final envisionment ofthe Dharma-realm of the nonobstruction of all phenomena, in which the lucidityand freedom of particularities in the transparency of emptiness were realized.The fundamental logic underlying the principle of the nonobstruction of allphenomena was the principle of mutual identity and mutual penetration(sōsoku-sōnyū). Mutual identity referred to the nondifferentiated state in whichantitheses, such as one and many, absolute and relative, being and nonbeing,co-existed in oneness and interfusion.132 [notes.html#ch4_132] Mutualpenetration referred to the simultaneous origination of all things and eventsthat interpenetrated one another in their myriad realms and dimensions. As Changexplains, different “entities” of different realms (e.g., water as a liquid,H2O, an aggregate of molecules, etc.) penetrate into and contain one anotherwithout the slightest hindrance and thus arise simultaneously.133[notes.html#ch4_133]From this underlying logical basis, traditional Hua-yen philosophy extended itsontology in terms of the “principles of the ten mysteries” (jūgemmon).134[notes.html#ch4_134] The first and ninth principles are crucially important forour examination of the problem of time.135 [notes.html#ch4_135] The first wasthe “principle of simultaneous completion and co-existence”(dōji-gusoku-sōō-mon) and the ninth the “principle of the various formations ofthe discrete events of the ten periods” (jisse-kyakuhō-ijō-mon). The first isusually regarded as the general principle because it was basic to all the otherprinciples: All things and events of the universe originated, co-existed, andintegrated simultaneously; they were co-related not only in terms of space butalso time. Hence, the fundamental idea was simultaneity (dōji). As fundamentallycontradictory and incompatible as one and many, or nondifferentiation anddifferentiation were, the former did not come after the latter and vice versa.On the contrary, these pairs of antitheses existed simultaneously. Thus, all theprinciples of the ten mysteries presupposed this notion of simultaneity—thesimultaneous completion of all things and events in space and time. Furthermore,this simultaneity was experienced most concretely and vividly in the presentmoment of a single thought of one’s lived experience. These two characteristicsconstituted the distinctive conception of time that underlay all the principlesof the ten mysteries.136 [notes.html#ch4_136]The principle of mutual identity and mutual penetration was applied morespecifically to time in the ninth principle of various formations of thediscrete events of the ten periods. The “ten periods” here meant the past,present, and future; each contained the three periods by virtue of the principleof mutual identity and mutual penetration. The past, present, and future thuscomprised nine periods altogether, which in turn formed one period—this amountedto a total of ten periods. Each of these ten periods was fulfilled in thepresent moment of a single thought.137 [notes.html#ch4_137] The corollary ofthis was as follows: the great aeons were one moment and one moment was thegreat aeons. The thesis that all the aeons and kalpas were contained and fusedin the present moment of a single thought did not obliterate the distinctions ofthe three periods and the triple divisions within each of them. The present wasdistinct and separate from the past and future: they were discrete events(kyakuhō). Nevertheless, these mutually exclusive and discontinuous times orperiods were “variously formed” (ijō). The various formations of discreteevents, thus, took place in the matrix of the present moment. This accounted forthe fundamental structure of time in which the three periods or nine periodswere simultaneously, yet variously, realized at each moment—one-in-many ormany-in-one in the present.138 [notes.html#ch4_138] Another importantimplication of the concept of the various formations of discrete eventsconcerned that succession of self-contained present moments we call the flow oftime. The present moment, absolutely discrete from those before and after it,proceeded to another and another, thus forming a succession of “presents,” ineach of which the various formations of discrete events were executed in aunique way.139 [notes.html#ch4_139]When we consider the first and ninth principles together, one importantimplication becomes immediately clear: the present moment of a single thoughtwas not only temporal, but spatial in that it simultaneously contained the tenperiods and the ten directions. The mutual identity and penetration of space andtime was clearly seen in this juxtaposition of the two principles.140[notes.html#ch4_140] Fa-tsang (643–712) described this as follows:Since a single moment has no substance of its own, it becomes interchangeablewith the great aeons. Because the great aeons have no substance, they alsoembrace the single moment. Since both the single moment and the great aeons haveno substance, all the marks of the long and the short are merged into [a greatharmony], hence all the universes that are far away or nearby, all the Buddhasand sentient beings, and all things and events in the past, present, and futurecome into view simultaneously.… [Since time is inseparable from events,] if onemoment becomes nonobstructive, all dharmas will [automatically] becomeharmoniously merged. This is why all things and events in the three timesvividly appear within one moment.141 [notes.html#ch4_141]We have examined some salient features of the Hua-yen philosophy of time in theforegoing. The basic Buddhist assumptions were retained, yet greatly extendedand deepened as Hua-yen probed into the structure of the present moment from thestandpoint of its totalistic ontology. However, the Hua-yen school wasconspicuously speculative; consequently, its profound insight into the nature oftime remained largely submerged in the abstract discourse of a grand ontology.As we turn to Dōgen’s view of time, we must, at the outset, note the fact thatalthough the problem of time was an integral part of Buddhist thought, it wasnever treated as central but was instead subordinated to such issues asnonsubstantiality, causation, emptiness, Buddha-nature, and so forth. Perhapsthe unique significance of Dōgen, in this regard, consisted of his attributionof central importance to this problem.142 [notes.html#ch4_142] Dōgen picked theproblem of time out of obscurity and placed it in the total context of histhought. This was done not from any speculative interests, which he vehementlydisdained, but out of existential concerns with the impermanence of life and itslimits, namely death. Thus, his analysis of time, as we shall see presently, wasdeeply personal, existential, and soteriological.143 [notes.html#ch4_143]In his exposition of time, Dōgen recommended that one consider the commonsenseview that a day was divided and subdivided into measurable units or quanta—aview that presupposed that time flowed uniformly in an infinite series ofhomogeneous temporal units from the past to the present to the future. Accordingto this view, time was akin to what Bergson designates “spatial time,” which istime organized spatially or segmentally. Dōgen urged his disciples to examinesuch a presupposition carefully.Study [time] in light of the twenty-four hours of the day. A deity with threeheads and eight arms is time; because it is time, it is no different from thecustomary twenty-four hours. Although you never measure [what you experienceregarding] the twenty-four hours’ length or brevity, slowness or swiftness, youstill construe [time] as the twentyfour hours. The directions and traces of itscoming and going [as with the four seasons] are so obvious that you never botherto doubt it. Even though you have no doubt about it, that does not mean youunderstand it.144 [notes.html#ch4_144]The so-called coming and going (korai) of time was so deeply and naturallyingrained in the ordinary mind that its nature was never questioned or analyzed.The twelve horary divisions of time were a part of this conventionalview—undoubtedly useful for daily living, but not to be mistaken as constitutingthe structure of time. Yet such a view may be worth examining as an initial stepinto the mystery of time. For in one sense, time is said to “flow” and “come andgo”; accordingly, we must examine what we mean by that.When we use such expressions as “time flows,” “time flies,” and so forth, twodifferent situations are implied: (1) Time is a kind of entity, or a thing initself, that moves, apart from and independent of, the flow of events andvicissitudes of life in the world; and (2) the things and events of the worldmove against the background of time. If we use the familiar analogy of a fruitin a pot, with the pot representing time, the former case is analogous to thesituation in which the pot is moving but the fruit is still; the latter is thereverse. Regardless of these differences, the two scenarios actually speak ofone and the same thing—that is, the fundamental assumption, quite familiar to usby now, of the dualism of time and events. Thus, temporal units are representedonly quantitatively, abstracted from their experiential contact with feltqualities of life; events are but episodes or appearances on the stage of theimpersonal passage or duration of time. Time and events are divorced from oneanother. Such a dualistic assumption is deeply rooted in the conventional viewof time. This is why Dōgen said: “According to an ordinary person’s view ofexistence-time, even enlightenment and nirvāṇa are merely the appearance of itscoming and going.”145 [notes.html#ch4_145] Dōgen thus admonished us as follows:Do not think that time only flies away. You should not regard time’s flying asits sole activity. If time were exclusively dependent on flying, there would bean interval (kenkyaku) [between time and the experiencing self]. People do notlisten to the truth of existence-time, because they conceive it to be onlypassing away.146 [notes.html#ch4_146]As is clear from this statement (and from other passages of the Shōbōgenzō),Dōgen was not rejecting the commonsense view as totally irrelevant or false.There is a grain of truth in the statement “time flows.” Dōgen’s task lay inexplicating this truth as much as possible, while probing and clarifying itsmisleading and false aspects. This was the meaning of his admonition, “Study[time] in light of the twenty-four hours of the day.”Dōgen thus proclaimed: “The existence-time in question means that time isalready existence and existence is necessarily time.”147 [notes.html#ch4_147] Hequoted the statement of Yüeh-shan Wêi-yen (745–828), but modified it in such away that “a particular time” (arutoki), from Yüeh-shan’s original, wasinterpreted as “existence-time” (uji). Dōgen’s own modified version read asfollows:Standing on the peak of a high mountain is existence-time. Diving to the bottomof the deep ocean is existence-time. A deity with three heads and eight arms isexistence-time. The Buddha [with the magnificent body] of one jō and six shakuis existence-time. A staff and a whisk are existence-time. A pillar and alantern are existence-time. You and friends in the neighborhood areexistence-time. The great earth and the empty sky are existence-time.148[notes.html#ch4_148]He also stated:Mountains are also time; oceans are time as well. If they were not, there wouldbe neither mountains nor oceans. Do not say that the realized now (nikon) ofmountains and oceans does not bear upon time. If time perishes, mountains andoceans will perish as well; if time does not, then neither will they. In andthrough this truth did Buddha’s enlightenment unfold, Tathāgata originate, theeye-balls proclaim, and Buddha’s holding up a flower manifest. Such is time.Were that not the case, they would not be possible.149 [notes.html#ch4_149]Likewise, “a pine tree is time; a bamboo is time.” Time even had colors:“Various times have such colors as blue, yellow, red, white, and so on.”150[notes.html#ch4_150] If time was existence and vice versa, it is not surprisingto see that time had shapes, colors, smells, sounds, and so on. Moreover, “goodand evil are time; time is neither good nor evil.”151 [notes.html#ch4_151] Allin all, the things and events of the entire universe were invariably time, andhence existence-time.Dōgen’s position was quite consistent with the traditional Buddhist positionthat time had no independent existence but was dependent on dharmas. Theparticularities of the world and of time were not two different sets ofrealities but one and the same. The commonsense view, on the other hand, tended,as we have seen before, to regard time as something that proceeded endlessly,uniformly, and linearly from the unknown past to the unknown future,irrespective of the actualities of reality and life. The actualities of theworld, in this dualistic view of existence and time, were merely the arising anddissolving, or coming and going, of “appearances” in a temporal succession.Dōgen vehemently rejected such a view.Time as existence-time was at once temporal and spatial. Again, consistent withBuddhist tradition, particularly the Hua-yen metaphysics of time, Dōgenobserved:You should examine the fact that all things and events of this entire universeare temporal particularities (jiji).… existence-time invariably means all times.Every particular phenomenon and every particular form are likewise time. Allexistence and all worlds are included in a temporal particularity. Just meditateon this for a moment: Is any existence or any world excluded from this presentmoment?152 [notes.html#ch4_152]Dōgen’s whole thesis in this regard was crystallized in the following: “As werealize with the utmost effort that all times (jinji) are all existence (jin’u),absolutely no additional dharma remains.”153 [notes.html#ch4_153] In otherwords, existencetime subsumed space and time totally and exhaustively. At thispoint, the following observations should be made: (1) In Dōgen’s view, space andtime were so inseparably interpenetrated that to see one without the otherdestroyed the fundamental understanding of his thought, particularly of histhought about Buddha-nature. Thus, spatiality and temporality were equallycrucial to existence and hence, to Buddha-nature.154 [notes.html#ch4_154] Inthis connection, Dōgen’s view of “all times” and “all existence” was notcomparable to “absolute time” and “absolute space” or to such mythopoeicmetaphors as “cosmic womb,” and “cosmic receptacle,” as we shall see in moredetail later. (2) Related to this last remark is the fact that temporality, forDōgen, was not a manifestation of a timeless eternity to which a metaphysicallyinferior status was attributed. A dualistic—transcendental and static—view ofeternity in contradistinction to time was alien to Dōgen’s thought. A hastyassociation of “all times” with a dualistic conception of eternity (or any othernotions of “everlastingness” or “timelessness” for that matter) was also to beavoided.155 [notes.html#ch4_155]Although he followed the traditional Buddhist conception of time fairly closely,Dōgen differed from it in his highly personal and existential emphasis. This wasespecially notable in his search for the “reason of the time of my self ” (jikono toki naru dōri):You should examine the fact that my self unfolds itself and makes the entireuniverse of it (ware o hairetsu shi-okite jinkai to seri), and that all thingsand events of this entire universe are temporal particularities. Just asparticular times are unobstructed by one another, so are particular things andevents unobstructed. For this reason, the minds of enlightenment awaken at thesame time; the times of enlightenment awaken in the same mind. The same holdstrue of practice and enlightenment.My self unfolds itself and beholds it. Such is the reason of the time of myself.156 [notes.html#ch4_156]Quite obviously, my self was not merely the psycho-physical ego but that selfwhich was one with the world—both the self and the world were theself-expressions (jidōshu) of Buddha-nature. Yet this self was my self with anindividual’s own unique doubts, fears, hopes, agonies, and aspirations.157[notes.html#ch4_157] Hence, it was neither an abstract speculation about theself in relation to the world (as is often the case with the traditionalBuddhism of, say, Hua-yen metaphysics), nor a subjectivistic involvement withthe empirical “I” (as we see in some schools of existentialism). While employingthe traditional categories, such as the self, mind, time, the world, Dōgen’s useof them was imbued with his personal experience, as well as with the ethos ofmedieval Japan. This was clearly expressed in the following:Nevertheless, ordinary people, being untutored in the Buddha-dharma, have theirown view of time, and by hearing the word uji, think as follows: “At one time itbecame a deity with three heads and eight arms, at another the magnificentBuddha of one jō and six shaku. For example, it is like [the self-same I’s]crossing rivers and climbing mountains. Although they now remain behind, I havepassed through them and now dwell in a grand palace. Thus, the mountains andrivers are as far separate from me as heavens from the earth.” [In this view,the self-identical I is presupposed in contrast to the physical environments.]Such a view, however, does not tell the whole truth of time. When I waded therivers and ascended the mountains, I was there. To [that particular] me belongsa particular time. As I am already here and now, time should not depart from me.If time does not have the quality of coming and going, the occasion of mountainclimbing is the realized now of [my] existence-time. If time comes and goes, therealized now of existence-time is [still] mine. [Existence-time is invariably apersonal time, irrespective of whether time comes and goes.] This is the meaningof existence-time. Doesn’t [existence-time] swallow that time of climbing andfording and this time of dwelling in the grand palace? Doesn’t it disgorge them?The deity with three heads and eight arms is yesterday’s time; the Buddha of onejō and six shaku is today’s time. But the truth of yesterday and today is[comparable to] that moment in which one climbs a mountain and looks around attens of thousands of peaks at a glance. [Yesterday and today, and all times forthat matter, are seen simultaneously.] Time does not pass. The particular timeof the deity [of yesterday] is also experienced precisely as my existence-time;though it appears to be far off, it is the realized now. The particular time ofthe magnificent Buddha [of today], too, is realized as nothing but myexistence-time; seeming to be far away, it is the realized now.158[notes.html#ch4_158]Although the foregoing passage has many important elements on which we shouldcomment, suffice it to say, for the moment, that Dōgen sufficiently demonstratedhis existential tenor in his treatment of existence and time, which wasradically concretized by his concept of self. In other words, Dōgen’s concept oftime fully incorporated into itself the self and the world—traditional bipolarconcepts of Buddhism—yet it deepened the whole character of the problem with aconcept of self based on Dōgen’s personal experience and the cultural ethos ofJapan. In this respect, Dōgen’s view of time was strikingly similar toHeidegger’s in its vehement insistence on the “mineness” of temporalityregarding death.Thus, Dōgen wrote:Indeed, existence-time is realized, freely and without restraint. Heavenlyrulers and celestial beings, actualized here and manifested there, are theexistence-time that I now exert totally. In addition to these beings, myriadforms of existence-time, in water and on land, are realized now through myefforts. All kinds of beings constituting existence-time, in the invisible aswell as visible worlds, are the embodiments of my endeavors without exception.Exertions move in and through time (jinriki kyōryaku nari). You should learnthat if my self does not put forth the utmost exertion and live time now (wagaima jinriki kyōryaku ni arazareba), not a single thing will be realized, norwill it ever live time.159 [notes.html#ch4_159]This last sentence summarizes Dōgen’s view of “my self ” in connection with theproblem of time. In this passage and others to which I have already referred,the problems of the realized now (nikon) and of temporal passage (kyōryaku)stand out as particularly important in Dōgen’s thought. Thus, we will nowexamine them individually.Existence-time is realized in the present. Its concrete realization takes placein the present moment; hence, an analysis of this is fundamental to all otheraspects of the problem of time. As Dōgen asked: “Is any existence or any worldexcluded from this present moment?” (This was quoted earlier in this section.)He also commented:The present time (konji) under consideration is each individual’s realized now(ninnin no nikon). Even though it makes you think of the past, present, andfuture, and tens of thousands of other times, they are the present time, therealized now. A person’s duty (ninnin no bunjō) always lies in the present. Attimes, the eyeballs might be regarded as the present time; at other times, thenostrils are the present time.160 [notes.html#ch4_160]It was also in the context of the present time that Dōgen’s critique of thecommonsense view of time as uniformly and one-directionally flowing and “comingand going” (korai) became most severe. For him, the first step toward theanalysis of time was to understand the traditional Buddhist dictum: “Everythingperishes as soon as it arises” (setsuna-shōmetsu). However, the ordinary personwas not aware of this truth, according to Dōgen. Hence:You should take note that the human body in this life is formed temporarily as aresult of the combination of the four elements and the five skandhas. There arealways the eight kinds of suffering [birth, old age, sickness, death, separationfrom the beloved, union with the hated, frustrations, and those sufferingscaused by clinging to the five skandhas], not to mention the fact that lifearises and perishes instantaneously from moment to moment and does not abide atall, and the fact that there are sixty-five setsunas born and annihilated in onetanji, yet the ordinary person does not realize this because of his/her ownignorance. Although one day and one night are comprised by 6,400,099,980setsunas, and the five skandhas appear and disappear, he/she does not know thesefacts. Pity those who are altogether unaware of their own births and deaths!161[notes.html#ch4_161]For Dōgen, to investigate this aspect of impermanence was crucially important,philosophically and religiously. In short, the tenet “Everything perishes assoon as it arises” denied duration: The ultimate limit of momentariness was alack of duration as well as an absence of coming and going. The commonsense viewfailed to see this.Dōgen analyzed the problem as follows:When firewood becomes ash, it can no longer revert to firewood. Hence, youshould not regard ash as following and firewood as preceding [as if they formedthe continuous process of a self-identical entity]. Take note that firewoodabides in its own Dharma-position (hōi), having both before and after. Althoughthere are before and after, they are cut off (zengo saidan seri) [so that thereremains only middle or present, i.e., the Dharma-position of firewood].Likewise, ash resides in its own Dharma-position, possessing both before andafter. Just as firewood does not revert to firewood again after having beenburnt to ash, so death is not transformed into life after the individual isdead. Thus, do not hold that life becomes death; this is an authoritativeteaching of the Buddha-dharma. Accordingly, call it nonlife (fushō). Buddha’sauthentic sermon proclaims that death does not change to life; accordingly, callit nondeath (fumetsu). Life is a position of total time, death is a position oftotal time as well. They are like winter and spring. We do not think that winterturns to spring or that spring turns to summer.162 [notes.html#ch4_162]Firewood and ash, life and death, winter and spring—all have their ownDharma-positions that are absolutely discrete and discontinuous. Each has itsbefore and after but is cut off from those Dharma-positions preceding andfollowing. Because of its central importance to Dōgen’s mystical realism, weshall attempt to delve into the problem of abiding in the Dharma-position(jū-hōi) in some detail now.First, a Dharma-position is composed of a particular here and now (aspatio-temporal existence in the world); hence, it is inevitably comprised ofthe existential particularities—biological, psychological, moral, philosophical,religious, and so forth—that are observed, compared, judged, and chosen in thedualistic scheme of things. That is to say, the existential particularities of agiven moment constitute a particular position of time, which in turn is aDharma-position. What makes a particular position of time a Dharma-position isthe appropriation of these particularities in such a manner that they are seennondualistically in and through the mediation of emptiness. As such, thesignificance of the existential qualities and phenomenalities of things andevents is by no means minimized; on the contrary, they are reconstituted,without being naively phenomenalistic, in their true aspect of thusness. “Dharmaabides in a Dharma-position” (hō wa hōi ni jūsuru nari); therefore, it does notimply that the Dharma-position is in any way a self-limiting manifestation or atemporal instance of eternity. To abide in a Dharma-position should not beconstrued as instrumental or subsidiary to some idea of eternity, but rather asan end in itself—as eternity in itself. Thus, the act of eating, for example, isviewed as self-sufficient in itself; it is the kōan realized in life(genjō-kōan).Second, such a particular here-and-now is also the bearer of the total situationin which it is lived. Dōgen frequently used the expression he was so fondof—“the total exertion of a single thing” (ippō-gūjin)—or simply, “totalexertion” (gūjin). He wrote, for example:Those who know a speck of dust know the entire universe; those who penetrate asingle dharma penetrate all dharmas. If you do not penetrate all dharmas, you donot penetrate a dharma. When you understand the meaning of penetration (tsū) andthereby penetrate thoroughly, you discern all dharmas as well as a singledharma. For this reason, while you study a speck of dust, you study the entireuniverse without fail.163 [notes.html#ch4_163]Elsewhere, related to the idea of the total exertion of a single thing, Dōgenhad this to say: “When one side is illumined, the other is darkened” (ippō oshōsuru toki wa ippō wa kurashi).164 [notes.html#ch4_164] As I noted in theforegoing, when one eats, eating is the total activity at that particular momentand nothing else. All other things remain in darkness, so to speak. This doesnot mean, however, that this affirmation of eating is achieved through thenegation of the existence of the “hidden”—such would be dualistic. On thecontrary, eating is enacted in such a way that it embodies, nondually andundefiledly, both the disclosed and the concealed, the part and the whole,microcosm and macrocosm. The activity of eating is, according to Dōgen’sfavorite expression, “the whole being of emptiness leaping out of itself ”(konshin-chōshutsu). When part and whole are simultaneously and unobstructedlyrealized in the act of eating, it is the moment when the whole being ofemptiness leaps out of itself, “mustering the whole body-mind” (shinjin okoshite)—another favorite expression of Dōgen. This is precisely what Dōgenmeant by “total realization” or “total function” (zenki). As I intend to discussthis matter in a different context later, I shall quote just one passage inconnection to this:Life is, for example, like sailing in a boat. Although we set a sail, steer ourcourse, and pole the boat along, the boat carries us and we do not exist apartfrom the boat. By sailing in the boat, we make the boat what it is. Assiduouslystudy [such an example of] this very moment (shōtōimmoji). At such time, thereis nothing but the world of the boat. The heavens, the water, and the shore—allbecome the boat’s time (fune no jisetsu); they are not the same as the time thatis not the boat. Hence, I make life what it is; life makes me what I am. Inriding the boat, one’s body and mind, and the self and the world are togetherthe dynamic function of the boat (fune no kikan). The entire earth and the wholeempty sky are in company with the boat’s vigorous exertion. Such is the I thatis life, the life that is I.165 [notes.html#ch4_165]Third, a Dharma-position does not come and go, or pass, or flow as thecommonsense view of time would assume. This is a radical rejection of the flowof time, or the stream of consciousness, or any other conceptions of time basedon the idea of continuity and duration. That is, time is absolutely discrete anddiscontinuous. This characteristic was primary to Dōgen’s thought.166[notes.html#ch4_166] His thesis, however, was not based on any quantitative oratomistic consideration of time, that is a theoretical concern, but rather onqualitative and practical reflections on his existential and religiousexperiences of the present. As he probed the “reason of total exertion” (gūjinno ri), he could not help but come to the idea of the radical discontinuity ofthe present.Though the expressions themselves of “abiding in the Dharma-position” and “thetotal exertion of a single thing” were by no means Dōgen’s own invention, theideas themselves nevertheless bore the imprints of typical Dōgen-like mysticalrealism, as epitomized in Dōgen’s statement (the English translation of whichhardly does justice to the spirit, eloquence and force of the originalJapanese): “Obstruction hinders obstruction, thereby obstruction realizes itself(ge wa ge o sae, ge o miru); obstruction obstructs obstruction (ge wa ge ogesuru nari)—such is time.”167 [notes.html#ch4_167] As Dōgen explainedimmediately after this passage, “obstruction” (ge, a shortened expression ofkeige) was not used in the ordinary sense of the word, but in the sense of“self-obstruction” while abiding in a Dharma-position. A thing was obstructed byitself and nothing else; that is, it exerted itself in perfect freedom.168[notes.html#ch4_168] Dōgen’s purport was to express the realistic aspect ofthusness, which entailed neither a monistic nor a phenomenalistic reductionism.Accordingly, we might legitimately translate the above passage as: “Thusnessthuses thusness, thereby thusness realizes itself …” Analogously, “a mountainmountain-s a mountain, thereby a mountain realizes itself …” and so on, in themanner of total exertion.169 [notes.html#ch4_169]So far I have tried to establish the necessary relationship between the idea ofabiding in the Dharma-position and that of the realized now in Dōgen’s thought,for Dōgen declared: “Living vigorously in a Dharma-position—such isexistence-time.”170 [notes.html#ch4_170] We can now fully comprehend thestatement to which I referred earlier:The deity with three heads and eight arms is yesterday’s time; the Buddha of onejō and six shaku is today’s time. But the truth of yesterday and today is[comparable to] that moment in which one climbs a mountain and looks around attens of thousands of peaks at a glance. Time does not pass. The particular timeof the deity [of yesterday] is also experienced precisely as my existence-time;though it appears to be far off, it is the realized now. The particular time ofthe magnificent Buddha [of today], too, is realized as nothing but myexistence-time; seeming to be far away, it is the realized now.171[notes.html#ch4_171]The present moment of a single thought (regardless of its length from atheoretical standpoint) is the subjectively appropriated, complete, and realizedexistence-time. Dōgen’s statement clearly denies seeing the present as aninstance in a linear view of time. Instead, the motif of simultaneity we haveexamined in connection with the Hua-yen metaphysics of time was strong andpervasive in his thought.172 [notes.html#ch4_172] In this framework, suchstatements as the following can be properly appreciated:You should understand that even though there was a moon last night, the moon yousee tonight is not last night’s moon. Tonight’s moon, whether of the earlier,middle, or later phase, is likewise nothing but the moon of tonight. Althoughthey say there is the moon, it is neither new nor old, because the moon inheritsthe moon.173 [notes.html#ch4_173]Analogously, the present can be divided into earlier, middle, and later phases,or into new and old, or past, present, and future. The present, however, is notdivided into the actuality of human subjectivity. This view is strikinglysimilar to what Whitehead conceived of in his “epochal theory of time” in whichthe epochal quantum of becoming was said to be divisible, but not divided.174[notes.html#ch4_174] Thus, each realized now constitutes a unique whole ofactuality.Furthermore, the structure of the realized now is such that the past, present,and future, in an epochal whole (to use Whitehead’s term here for convenience’ssake), are not arranged in a linear fashion but realized simultaneously in themanner of mutual identity and mutual penetration (sōsoku-sōnyū). This refutesthe ordinary ways of defining these three periods:[A common belief] says that the past has already perished, the future is yet tocome, and the present does not stay. But, the past has not necessarily alreadyperished, the future is not necessarily yet to come, and the present will notnecessarily not stay. If you learn the not-staying, the not-yet, and theno-longer as present, future, and past, respectively, you should certainlyunderstand the reason why the not-yet is the past, present, and future. [Thesame holds true of the no-longer and the not-staying.]175 [notes.html#ch4_175]What this statement indicates, in the final analysis, is that the manner inwhich an epochal whole of the present incorporates the selective memory of thepast, as well as the projected anticipation of the future, is far more complexthan conventional definitions of the past, present, and future (in terms of theno-longer, not-staying, and not-yet) would assume it to be. The very complexityof this problem, in turn, points to various possibilities of freedom in thisreligio-philosophical appropriation of the three periods in the realized now, inwhich Buddha-nature is realized (ji-busshō). We now come to the problem oftemporal passage (kyōryaku) in Dōgen’s view of time.Before we embark on an examination of Dōgen’s view of temporal passage, severalprevalent views must be cleared from our path at the outset. First, as isapparent from the general characteristics of his metaphysics, Dōgen rejected anysupernaturalistic agent that governed a providential continuity or a sacredhistory, independent of the ever-changing flux of existence and time. Any otherall-embracing principle of eternity or timelessness, or any evolutionary schemeof history, was also alien to Dōgen’s thought. Secondly, Dōgen’s analogy offirewood and ash indicates that the continuity of becoming ash from firewood isan illusion that presupposes some changeless substratum that endures throughoutthe accidental changes of the burning firewood until it reduces to ash.Certainly, a uniformly flowing and measurable time, in an infinite continuum,would assume such a presupposition. Although the drawbacks of these two viewsare fairly easy to detect, the third view of continuity as a process frompotentiality to actuality is subtler than the other two—so much so that Dōgenundertook his analyses with great care to repudiate it once and for all.Let us examine this last view a little more closely. Dōgen presented a metaphorstrikingly similar to Aristotle’s metaphor of the acorn and the oak tree:A certain group of people think that Buddha-nature is like a seed of a grass orplant. When the rain moistens it generously, buds and stems grow, branches,leaves and fruits become dense, and eventually the fruits bear seeds. Such aview is what an ordinary person imagines. Supposing that you understand thematter this way, you should still realize that the seeds, the flowers, and thefruits are each the unadulterated mind itself (jōjō no sekishin). A seed in afruit, though unseen, produces roots and stems and, though not brought togetherfrom elsewhere, flourishes with a thick trunk and big branches. This has nothingto do with something inside or outside, and yet, it is true throughout the ages.For this reason, even if an ordinary person’s approach is taken [for the sake ofargument], the roots, stems, branches, and leaves all live the same life and alldie the same death; they are equally one and the same Buddha-nature of allexistence.176 [notes.html#ch4_176]Buddha-nature is not something that will be realized in the future, if and whena right season arrives, as is the case with a seed that grows into a plant andbears fruit. Buddha-nature is not a potentiality to be actualized some time inthe future, but is an actuality in and of the present. Dōgen contended:People, ancient and modern alike, have often thought and think that the Buddhistsaying “if the time arrives” means waiting for some time in the future whenBuddha-nature will manifest itself, and that, when they practice the Way in thismanner, they will naturally witness the time of Buddha-nature’s manifestation.But they say that if the time does not come, it will never manifest itself, eventhough they may visit teachers and inquire about Dharma and endeavor to studythe Way. Thinking this way, they are aimlessly enmeshed in the whirlwind ofworldly dusts and observe the Milky Way in vain. Such people belong perhaps tothe non-Buddhists’ naturalism [that maintains the spontaneous generation of allthings].177 [notes.html#ch4_177]Dōgen then expounded his view as follows:Wanting to know the meaning of Buddha-nature, as we see it, is to really knowit. To reflect upon temporal conditions is to actually know them. If you wish toknow Buddha-nature, you must know temporal conditions in this way. To say “ifthe time arrives” is tantamount to declaring that the time has already arrived;how can you doubt this? You may entertain a doubt about the time. Be that as itmay, witness Buddha-nature’s arrival. You should know that “if the time arrives”[as understood in this manner], every moment of the twenty-four hours of the daydoes not pass by in vain. The “if-arrives” (nyakushi) is construed as the“already-arrived” (kishi). [Otherwise,] “if the time arrives” would mean“Buddha-nature never arrives.” For this reason, since the time has alreadyarrived, Buddha-nature is unmistakably present here and now. The reason ofBuddha-nature discloses itself. There is absolutely no time that has not yetarrived [according to our interpretation of “if the time arrives”]; there is noBuddha-nature that is not yet realized.178 [notes.html#ch4_178]We see here Dōgen’s emphatic repudiation of continuity as the process frompotentiality to actuality. If we seek to find a kind of continuity in Dōgen’sthought, we should do so without doing injustice to what Dōgen had to say withrespect to the discontinuity of actualities. In any event this much is clear:The concept of continuity in Dōgen’s thought did not refer to a process ofevolutionary becoming, from the inferior to the superior, from the imperfect tothe perfect, from the incomplete to the complete, or from the hidden to therevealed, which was invariably associated with the image of the linear flow oftime. Realization (genjō) in Dōgen’s thought rejected such a process ofevolutionary becoming, or “coming and going” and “arising and perishing” forthat matter. Rather, it meant that reality in its realized state was always aself-sufficient, yet dynamic whole. (Obviously, this was not a naivephenomenalism that affirmed the empirical reality at face value. We shall haveoccasion to say more about this later.)179 [notes.html#ch4_179]Dōgen wrote:Existence-time has the characteristic of passage (kyōryaku): it passes fromtoday to tomorrow, from today to yesterday, from yesterday to today, from todayto today, and from tomorrow to tomorrow [in the experience of my realized now].Dynamism (kyōryaku) is the characteristic of time. While the times of ancientand modern do not pile up, nor do they line up [because they are mutuallyidentical and mutually penetrated], Ch’ing-yüan [Hsing-ssŭ] is time, Huang-po[Hsi-yün] is also time, [Ma-tsu Tao-i of] Chiang-hsi and Shih-t’ou [Hsi-ch’ien]are times as well. Because the self and others are already times [discrete fromeach other], practice and enlightenment are different times. Also, to enter themire and go into the water [to guide sentient beings] is likewise time.180[notes.html#ch4_180]Temporal passage, in this view, was not so much a succession or contiguity ofinter-epochal wholes, as it was the dynamic experience of an intra-epochal wholeof the realized now, in which the selective memory of the past and the projectedanticipation of the future were subjectively appropriated in a unique manner. Inbrief, continuity in Dōgen’s context meant dynamism. (In this sense alone, Dōgenallowed for the notion of “flow” in time.) This is in accord with what we sawpreviously with the Hua-yen “principle of the various formations of the discreteevents of the ten periods” (jisse-kyakuhōijō-mon). In the realized now, thediscrete events of past, present, and future were variously formed at a givenmoment. The dynamic structure of the realized now, and its manner ofappropriating these three periods, were extremely complex and defied anysimplistic characterization from the linear perspective alone.If we take the linear or directional metaphor advisedly like Dōgen (as in theidea of temporal passage), time may be said to be multi-directional andmulti-dimensional. As I have already quoted, it moves from today to yesterday,from tomorrow to tomorrow, from yesterday to today, and so forth—not only that,but it moves “vertically.” Dōgen wrote:The hour of the horse [11 A.M.–1 P.M.] and the hour of the sheep [1–3 P.M.], inrelation to things arrayed in the world now, are as they are by virtue ofabiding in their Dharma-positions, constantly moving up and down.181[notes.html#ch4_181]Thus, temporal passage in the intra-epochal whole of a realized now, as Dōgensaw it, was perhaps best described in terms of the Hua-yen philosophy ofsimultaneity. Dōgen said:You should not construe temporal passage (kyōryaku) as something like a stormpassing from east to west. The world is neither motionless and changeless norwithout advance and retreat: it is temporal passage. Passage is, then, likespring. Myriad events take place in the spring and they are called passage. Itshould be noted that [spring] passes without anything outside itself, [such aswinter or summer]. For example, the passage of spring always passes throughspring itself. [There is nothing but the dynamism of spring.] Although temporalpassage is not confined to spring alone, it is now realized at this particulartime of spring, because it is the dynamism of spring. This should be understoodcarefully. Speaking of temporal passage, ordinary people think that theobjective environment exists independently, while the subject of passage(nōkyōryaku no hō) traverses eastward through hundreds of thousands of worldsand aeons. However, the study of the Buddha-way is not confined to this onething alone.182 [notes.html#ch4_182]As we recall, Dōgen said: “Unless my self puts forth the utmost exertion andlives time now, not a single thing will be realized, nor will it ever livetime.” Herein lay Dōgen’s existential solution to the problem of one and many.The foregoing examples illustrate Dōgen’s existential and religious concernswith the “intra-subjective” reality of the realized now as well as with temporalpassage. The deepest motive behind Dōgen’s metaphysic of time was a practical,not theoretical, interest that consisted of the activity of philosophizing,which for Dōgen was none other than the practice of the Way (bendō). Thus, weare neither enslaved by time, nor do we have to “kill time”; instead, we now usetime freely and creatively.183 [notes.html#ch4_183]My observations thus far concerning the self, the realized now, temporalpassage, and so on—all of which constitute existence-time—might give theimpression that Dōgen’s view of time was nothing but an affirmation of realityas the given in the here and now—that is, a completed reality. We have seenreferences to this aspect of realization (genjō) previously, and this impressionseems to be partially justified. We are led to ask: Wasn’t Dōgen’s metaphysic oftime all but static? Can we find any dynamic elements of transformation andprogression in Dōgen? Such questions lead to another fundamentally importantaspect of Dōgen’s view of time—his notion of the “perpetuation of the Waythrough activity” (gyōji-dōkan), which we have had occasion to touch uponpreviously.184 [notes.html#ch4_184] Dōgen’s key passage runs as follows:The great Way of the Buddhas and ancestors consists always in these supremeactivities (mujō no gyōji), never interrupted in their continuation: the desirefor enlightenment, practice, enlightenment, and nirvāṇa. These four activitiesnever allow even a single interval between them. This is the perpetuation of theWay through activity (gyōji-dōkan). Consequently, supreme activity is neither acontrivance of the self nor that of others; it is activity undefiled. The powerof such an activity sustains my self and others. Its import is such that all theheavens and the entire earth of the ten directions enjoy the merit of myactivity. Even if neither the self nor others are aware of it, such is thecase.185 [notes.html#ch4_185]The merit, or power, of the progression of creative activity is clearly setforth here. As we have seen, creative activity is metaphysically primitive tosuch an extent that we could rightly claim, “In the beginning was activity.”This well conveys what Dōgen meant by the following:The sun, the moon, and the stars exist by virtue of such creative activities.The earth and the empty sky exist because of activities. Our body-mind and itsenvironment are dependent on activities; so are the four elements and the fiveskandhas. Although activity is not what worldly people are likely to care for,it is every human’s only true refuge.… It should be examined and understoodthoroughly that dependent origination (engi) is activity, because activity doesnot originate dependently.186 [notes.html#ch4_186]Dōgen went beyond the conventional way of thinking in Buddhist philosophy byasserting that activity was more primitive than dependent origination. This wasnot to deny the significance of the latter, but to probe the nature of itsconditions and causes—that is, to probe all things of the universe—in order todeepen our understanding of them as activities.187 [notes.html#ch4_187] The cruxof the matter was succinctly stated in the following manner:That activity which realizes those activities—it is our activity now (wareragaimano gyōji nari). The now of activity (gyōji no ima) is not the self’sprimordial being, eternal and immutable, nor is it something that enters andleaves the self. The Way, called now, does not precede activity; as activity isrealized (gyōji genjō suru), it is called now.188 [notes.html#ch4_188]It is evident that now is realized contemporaneously with activity. Or to put itanother way, time is activity and activity is time. The realized now consists,not in a static timelessness that enables us to accept the given reality as itis, but rather in a dynamic activity that involves us intimately in time andhence transforms our deeds, speech, and thought. The realization of activity(gyōji-genjō) signals this element of transformation. But this element is inturn inseparably connected with the perpetuation of the Way (dōkan), comparableto the forward revolution of the wheel of Dharma—it advances in history, but isan advance in enlightenment (bukkōjōji). Thus, if we construe these observationsas indicating the process of evolutionary becoming (as in a Hegelian dialecticaldevelopment as proposed by some philosophically oriented students of Dōgen), ourprevious efforts toward establishing the primacy of discontinuity end in failureat this very point. For nowhere does Dōgen advocate any evolutionary theory oftime, as I have emphasized. Therefore, even when we appreciate the significanceof transformation and progression in Dōgen’s thought, we should do so in thecontext of the ultimacy of discontinuity.RELIGIOUS LIFE AND BUDDHA-NATURE [toc.html#ch4_h2_5]As I have shown in the foregoing, Dōgen’s thought has a specificallyphilosophical import and relevance even today—a fact that has often been pointedout by many students of Dōgen. This does not mean, however, that he endeavoredto construct a philosophical system; such was alien to his orientation. Dōgenengaged in philosophical analyses, comments, and expositions due to theexistential and religious exigency that confronted him in the particularsituation of his time. He was primarily a religious thinker who regarded the actof philosophizing as an essential element of his religiousness. This can beshown, for example, in the fact that while Dōgen used such traditional Buddhistterms as mind-only, Dharma-nature, thusness, and Buddha-nature synonymouslythroughout his works, he regarded Buddha-nature as particularly fitting andcentral—perhaps because the term retained more personal, affective, andexistential connotations as compared to the impersonal, speculative, andtranscendental connotations of the other terms. This affective strand in hispersonality was as strong as his cerebral disposition and cultic rigorism—andmight have been engendered by his mother’s tender religious piety. In thisrespect, Buddha-nature became Dōgen’s own mythopoeic vision and was no longer acold metaphysical concept—this was loosely comparable in its religiousintention, and strikingly similar in its emotive tones, to the Amitābha or Amidafaith of Pure Realm Buddhism. As Dōgen made abundantly clear, Zen Buddhism was areligion, not a philosophy alone.189 [notes.html#ch4_189]As we have reminded ourselves so often, Dōgen’s philosophical and religiousthought revolved around his search for the meaning and reason (dōri) ofexistence, specifically of human existence in the context of impermanence andultimately of death. Dōgen wrote:To understand birth-and-death lucidly is a matter of the greatest importance fora Buddhist.An old sage [Śākyamuni Buddha] said: “When you are first born into the world,you are provided with the ability to expound Dharma.” The ability to expoundDharma is the power of Tathāgata’s great discourse, or the great discourseitself.190 [notes.html#ch4_190]His seriousness concerning the problem is well testified to by these remarks:“We are born in the world without knowing our beginning and our end. Although wedo not know the bounds of the world, we still look at and tread upon thisplace.”191 [notes.html#ch4_191] He further said:If someone seeks Buddha outside birth-and-death, it is like orienting a carttoward the north in order to head for the province of Yüeh, or like facingtoward the south in order to gaze up at Charles’ Wain. The more we collect theconditions of birth-and-death, the further we go astray in finding the way ofliberation. We understand that birth-and-death itself is nirvāṇa; thus weneither loathe birth-and-death nor long for nirvāṇa. Only then, for the firsttime, are we free in birth-and-death.192 [notes.html#ch4_192]The meaning of impermanence is not prior to, or independent of, the fact ofimpermanence. They are mutually identical and interdependent. In other words,myth is reality and reality is myth. Dōgen did not believe, as the modern worlddoes, in a dualism between reality and myth in which reality is construed asisolatable from myth so as to attain a progressively greater degree ofobjectivity; rather, his purport was to clarify, purify, and reinforce myth—thatis, Buddha-nature—in order to see and touch reality as it was. What themythopoeic vision of Buddha-nature produced was not clouded feelings andemotions that coated, hid, or soothed the inexorable reality of impermanence anddeath, but those feelings and emotions that cleansed in thusness and wereembedded in and transparent to that reality.Let us then examine Dōgen’s criticism of the Senika view of the immortality andeternity of the soul. Dōgen’s disciples asked:Some people say: “We must not grieve over birth-and-death, for there is a veryeasy way to liberate ourselves from it—namely, to know the immortality ofmind-essence (shinshō no jōjū). Its tenet is as follows: While this body, havingalready been born, shall be transferred by necessity to death, this mind neverperishes. Knowing that mind-essence is not affected by birth-and-death butresides in the body, one construes it as the original being; accordingly, thebody is a temporary carcass that suffers an endless series of births-and-deaths.Mind is permanent and changeless throughout the past, present, and future. Tounderstand this way constitutes liberation from birth-and-death. Those who knowthis truth endure the present life and, as our bodies dissolve, enter the realmof essence. As we merge into the realm of essence, we are endowed with wondrousvirtues like Buddhas and Tathāgatas. Even if we know this truth in the presentlife, we are not equal to these sages, because of our bodily existences withtheir attendant karmic effects from previous lives. Those who do not know thistenet as yet shall ever wander in the cycles of birth-and-death. Therefore, youmust understand, without losing a moment, the truth of the immortality ofmind-essence. What do you expect to happen if you pass your life wastefully inidle sitting?” Is or is not such a view truly in accord with the Way of theBuddhas and ancestors?193 [notes.html#ch4_193]The temporariness and temporality of bodily and phenomenal existence, in thisview, are forfeited for the sake of an after-life in the ocean realm ofmind-essence. Opposing this Senika view, Dōgen submitted his own case for theradical affirmation of human existence:Nevertheless, to equate such an opinion with the Buddha-dharma is more foolishthan grasping tiles and pebbles and believing they are golden treasures. Such adelusion is shameful. National Teacher Huichung (?–d. 775) of the great T’angdynasty strongly warned against such a view. Despicable and pitiful are thosewho currently contrive an erroneous doctrine of the immortality of mind andperishability of form, identifying it with Buddhas’ wondrous Dharma and thinkingthemselves to be liberated from birth-and-death, while creating the root causeof suffering in birth-and-death.… From the standpoint of changelessness, allthings are changeless without exception, with no differentiation between bodyand mind. From the standpoint of unconditionedness, all existences are equallyunconditioned, with no differentiation between essence and form. In view of allthis, is it not unreasonable for some to assert that while the body perishes,the mind endures? What is more, it should be realized that this verybirth-and-death itself is nirvāṇa; nobody can speak of nirvāṇa independently ofbirth-and-death.194 [notes.html#ch4_194]What matters most in religion, as Dōgen saw it, is not a deferred realization ofimmortality in an after-life, nor an eternal recurrence of rebirths, but therealization of enlightenment here and now. Hence, this present birth-and deathis the only absolute locus—discrete from before and after—in which we can speakof religion, that is, our liberation. In short, birth-and-death is the verylocus in which the two possibilities of enlightenment and delusion are offeredto every one of us. Thus, “in the midst of birth-and-death, an ordinary personwanders about in delusion, whereas a great sage is liberated inenlightenment.”195 [notes.html#ch4_195] Life can either be a blessing or acurse; hence, we must choose either enlightenment or delusion, but not both.Dōgen’s view of religious life bore strictly on this life—no more, no less.The meaning and reason of human existence cannot be adequately considered inisolation from nonhuman existence in view of their interdependence. Preciousthough it is, human existence can be adequately understood only in its cosmiccontext. In any ontology, human existence has the favorable status as a point ofdeparture, at least from the human standpoint. However, this should not imply orlead to an exaggeration of the value of human existence in the total context.This cosmic orientation is apparent in the following:The mind of a sentient being is destined to desire to know its own self.However, those whose eyes see their true selves are exceedingly rare indeed;Buddha alone sees it. Non-Buddhists vainly pine for that which is not the self.What Buddha means by the self is precisely the entire universe. Thus, whetherone is aware of it or not, there is no universe that is not this self …An ancient Buddha once said that mountains, rivers, the great earth, and allhumans are born together; likewise, the Buddhas of the three periods and allhumans have been endeavoring together. On this account, because I see mountains,rivers, and the great earth when a single person is born, it does not seem to bethat he or she comes into being as an unessential element piled upon thosemountains, rivers, and the great earth, which existed before that person’sbirth.… We are born in the world without knowing our beginning and our end.Although we do not know the bounds of the world, we still look at and tread uponthis place. Do not hold a grudge against mountains, rivers, and the great earth,because they are not like human life. You should clearly understand that [theprevious saying] shows the oneness of the universe and my existence.Furthermore, the Buddhas of the three periods already exerted themselves toperfect the Way and realize enlightenment. How should we understand this onenessof Buddha and the self? Observe the activities of Buddha for awhile. Buddha’sactivities take place with the entire great earth and with all sentient beings.If they are not with all existence, they are not yet the activities of Buddha.Hence from arousing the desire for enlightenment to the attainment ofenlightenment, Buddha is enlightened and conducts himself always with the wholeworld and with all sentient beings.196 [notes.html#ch4_196]“To study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self.To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe.”197[notes.html#ch4_197] Furthermore: “For the self to carry itself forward andpractice/verify the myriad things is delusion; for the myriad things to advanceand practice/verify the self is enlightenment.”198 [notes.html#ch4_198] WhileDōgen conceived of human existence in the context of the world as does Heideggerin terms of “a being-in-the-world,” he never asserted an excessive “mineness,”as Heidegger does, at the expense of cosmic concern.199 [notes.html#ch4_199] ForDōgen, the self and the world, anthropology and cosmology, were invariablyinterpenetrated in the total context of his ontology. Both the self and theworld arose and perished together in the simultaneous realization of Buddhahood(dōji-jōdō).It is against this general background that we must understand Dōgen’s mostpietistic statements, such as the following, which is almost indistinguishablefrom the sentiments of Pure Realm Buddhism:This birth-and-death itself is the life of Buddha. If you loathe and abandon it,you will lose the life of Buddha; if you abide by it, clinging tobirth-and-death, you will also lose the life of Buddha, being left with a mereshell of Buddha. When you neither loathe nor crave it, only then do you enterthe heart of Buddha for the first time. But do not calculate it with your mindor explain it with words. When you cast off and forget your body and mind andplunge into the abode of Buddha so that Buddha may act upon you and you maydevote yourself completely to him, you become Buddha, liberated frombirth-and-death, without effort and anxiety.200 [notes.html#ch4_200]It is worth noting at this point that despite these pious statements, Dōgen’sreligiousness was radically different from Shinran’s, primarily because ofdifferences in the two thinkers’ perceptions of human existence. Dōgen viewed itin the light of radical impermanence, whereas Shinran viewed it in the light ofradical sinfulness. As we shall see in the next chapter, Dōgen did not lack anawareness of sinfulness, in connection with confession, any more than Shinranlacked an awareness of impermanence, inasmuch as he lived in medieval Japan,which was thoroughly saturated with it. Nevertheless, no one can legitimatelychallenge the general validity of the above observation. Thus, in the case ofDōgen, death was viewed from the standpoint of impermanence, and in the case ofShinran, from the standpoint of sinfulness. Moreover, for Shinran, there was anunbridgeable gap between Amida and the common mortals, at least existentially,because of our moral wretchedness and utter incapacity to save ourselves exceptby the power of Amida’s original vow (hongan). This view may have appeared toDōgen as an exaggerated, rather than an accurate, description of the humancondition. For both Dōgen and Shinran, our most serious limitations were ouracts, rather than a lack of intuitive insight into our nature. For Dōgen, it wasthe failure to act, whereas for Shinran, it was the incapacity to act.It was fashionable to speak of the dichotomies of faith and enlightenment, aswell as of other-power (tariki) and self-power (jiriki), which in turn wereapplied too facilely to an understanding of the Pure Realm and Zen traditions inBuddhism. These distinctions were irrelevant and fruitless at a deeper levelwithin the two traditions, despite their having a certain amount of usefulness.This was most strongly substantiated by the two thinkers’ writings concerningnondual freedom and liberation—in the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity(jijuyū-zammai) for Dōgen, and in naturalness (jinen-hōni) for Shinran.Nevertheless, we should not obscure or minimize the fundamental differencesbetween Dōgen and Shinran, some of which I have pointed out already.201[notes.html#ch4_201] Dōgen’s occasional outpouring of pious sentiments should beunderstood in the context of his mythopoeic vision of Buddha-nature, which wassignificantly similar to, as well as significantly different from, that of Amidaof Pure Realm Buddhism.In his discourse on Buddha-nature, Dōgen wrote:In exerting life you are not obstructed by life; in exerting death you are notobstructed by death. You should not be attached to life aimlessly, or be afraidof death unreasonably. [The body of the five skandhas] is already the locus ofBuddha-nature, and both perturbation [by life] and abomination [of death] areun-Buddhist. When you understand that [the body of the five skandhas] is formedby various conditions at hand, you are able to exert it unobstructedly. This isthe supreme Buddha. The abode of this supreme Buddha itself is the wondrous PureLand.202 [notes.html#ch4_202]The logic of exerting (shitoku suru) birth-and-death is such that, as life isexerted totally, there is nothing but life in the entire universe. When thishappens, life becomes no-life and negates itself (i.e., mentioning life ismeaningless in the situation where there is nothing but life). This is the logicof total exertion, to which we have referred frequently, and also the logic of“total dynamism” (zenki) of the entire universe and of Buddha-nature.203[notes.html#ch4_203] Total dynamism is equivalent to the principle of the totalexertion of a single thing, the only difference being that it is now applied tothe entire universe and Buddha-nature. When a single thing, say, the sound offlowing water, is totally exerted, the total realization of Buddha-nature ispresent in that single phenomenon. Thus, the principles of total exertion andtotal dynamism are two aspects of one and the same reality of subjectivity inDōgen’s mystical realism. Loosely speaking, the former (total exertion)addresses itself primarily to the self, whereas the latter (total dynamism)speaks to the world. Both refer to the undefiled freedom and liberation of theself and the world as the self-expression of Buddha-nature.We are now in a position to examine Dōgen’s idea of total dynamism in a littlemore detail. Dōgen wrote:As it works consummately, the great Way of all Buddhas is liberation (tōdatsu)and realization (genjō). Liberation means that life becomes transparent to lifeitself and death becomes transparent to death itself. Thus, there is detachmentfrom birth-and-death, as well as involvement in birth-and-death: both are thegreat Way of total exertion (gūjin no daidō). There is discarding ofbirth-and-death, and there is crossing of birth-and-death: they are equally thegreat Way of total exertion. Realization is life, life is realization. In suchrealization, life is nothing but its total realization; death is nothing but itstotal realization. This dynamic function (kikan) makes life what it is and deathwhat it is. At the very time when this dynamic function is realized, it is notnecessarily large, nor is it necessarily small; it is neither infinite norfinite; neither far nor near. Life now is in this dynamic function, and thisdynamic function is in life now. Life is not coming, life is not going. Life isnot manifestation, life is not formation. Nevertheless, life is the presence oftotal realization, death is the presence of total realization. You shouldrealize that among an infinite number of dharmas that constitute the self, thereis birth and there is death.Reflect quietly upon the following: This present life and all things coexistenttherewith—do they or do they not share a common destiny? Not a single moment,not a single thing exists that is not with life; not a single event, not asingle mind exists that is not with life.204 [notes.html#ch4_204]In what the existentialist would deem to be a person’s existence, Dōgen wouldsee as the total activity of the universe engaged in the common endeavor ofcreation. The entire universe suffers the pangs of a new creation in and througha person’s existence.205 [notes.html#ch4_205] Dōgen’s existential concern, as Ihave noted before, never went astray in an excessive assertion of personalconcern. Instead, both the self and the world share their common destiny as theself-activities and self-expressions of Buddha-nature.The same thesis is explicated in Dōgen’s analogy of a boat, as quoted before:Life is, for example, like sailing in a boat. Although we set sail, steer ourcourse, and pole the boat along, the boat carries us, and we do not exist apartfrom the boat. By sailing in the boat, we make the boat what it is. Studyassiduously [such an example of] this very moment. At such time, there isnothing but the world of the boat. The heavens, the water, and the shore—allbecome the boat’s time; they are not the same as the time that is not the boat.Hence, I make life what it is; life makes me what I am. In riding the boat,one’s body and mind, the self and the world are together the dynamic function ofthe boat. The entire earth and the whole empty sky are in company with theboat’s vigorous exertion. Such is the I that is life, the life that is I.206[notes.html#ch4_206]Dōgen then asserted the following, immediately after the above passage:Teacher Yüan-wu K’o-ch’in [1063–1135] once said: “Life is the realization oftotal dynamism; death is the realization of total dynamism.”You should elucidate and penetrate this statement deeply. Penetrating it deeplymeans: Although the truth of “life is the realization of total dynamism,” withno bearing on a beginning or an end, embraces the entire great earth and theentire empty sky, not only does it not obstruct life as the realization of totaldynamism, but it does not obstruct death as the realization of total dynamism.Even though when “death is the realization of total dynamism,” it embraces theentire great earth and the entire empty sky; it does not hinder death as therealization of total dynamism, nor does it hinder life as the realization oftotal dynamism. Therefore, life does not obstruct death, death does not obstructlife. The entire great earth and the entire empty sky alike are involved in lifeas well as in death. This does not mean, however, that any single [fixed] earthor any single [self-same] sky is totally working in life or in death. Though notidentical, they are not different; though not different, they are not one;though not one, they are not many. Accordingly, in life are all dharmas thatrealize themselves in total dynamism; in death are all dharmas that realizethemselves in total dynamism. The realization of total dynamism exists even inwhat is neither life nor death. Within the realization of total dynamism, thereis life and there is death.207 [notes.html#ch4_207]The total realization of Buddha-nature does not obliterate the individualparticularities and identities of events, things, and persons as though they aredissolved in an undifferentiated realm. True to the Hua-yen metaphysics of the“nonobstruction of all phenomena” (jiji-muge), based on the principle of “mutualidentity and mutual penetration” (sōsoku-sōnyū), Dōgen maintained that theconcrete particularities of dharmas, radically discrete spatially andtemporally, are interpenetrated and unobstructed—each exerts total realizationin its own right. Furthermore, in effect: “Though not identical, they are notdifferent; though not different, they are not one; though not one, they are notmany.” The particularities in question are not dissolved or fused inBuddha-nature. The all-inclusiveness of Dōgen’s mythopoeic vision should beunderstood in this manner.On the other hand, Dōgen’s vision is exclusionary in that when life is totallyexerted and realized, there is nothing but life, excluding everything else, andultimately life itself becomes “meaningless.” At this point, the distinctionbetween symbol and reality becomes liberatingly irrelevant. This exclusionaryaspect of the mythopoeic vision of Buddha-nature demands that we choose, andcommit ourselves to, a definite course of action at each moment—whatever thatmay be. Such an orientation is far from noncommittal, as Zen Buddhism is all toooften misunderstood to be. A definite philosophic and moral choice, however,must be “undefiled” (fuzenna), totally exerted as the self-creation ofBuddha-nature in the total freedom of the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity.These two characteristics, inclusionary and exclusionary, are unobstructedly andnondually envisioned in Dōgen’s mythopoeic vision of Buddha-nature.We must now take into account the problem of time. The analogy of firewood andash, which we discussed previously, can be applied to the problem ofbirth-and-death. Dōgen repudiated the popular conception of death as thetermination of life, as if life became or changed into death: “It is a mistaketo think that there is a transition from life to death.”208 [notes.html#ch4_208]For Dōgen, the continuity of becoming between birth and death obscured the realcrux of the problem, for birth and death were two discrete “positions of time.”He wrote:Thus, do not hold that life becomes death; this is an authoritative teaching ofthe Buddha-dharma. Accordingly, call it nonlife. Buddha’s authentic sermonproclaims that death does not change to life; accordingly, call it nondeath.Life is a position of total time, death is a position of total time as well.209[notes.html#ch4_209]The same thesis was stated in another place:Life is a position of total time (hitotoki), having both before and after.Accordingly, in the Buddha-dharma, life itself is said to be nonlife. Likewise,extinction is a position of total time, having before and after. Hence,extinction itself is said to be nonextinction. When you speak of life, there isnothing but life; when you speak of extinction, there is nothing but extinction.For this reason, when life comes, you should surrender yourself solely to life;when extinction comes, you should surrender yourself solely to extinction. Donot hate them. Do not desire them.210 [notes.html#ch4_210]When death was chosen totally by abiding in its Dharma-position, it was not adeath among innumerable deaths, or death as opposed to life, but the death thatwas, paradoxically, nondeath; yet at the same time, it was supremely a deaththat no other death could replace.Like Heidegger, who has characterized human existence as the“being-toward-death,” Dōgen maintained that death was not some external powerthat visited at the close of human life, and consequently, could be dealt withindifferently. Rather, death was something co-present with our life: life anddeath interpenetrated one another in the structural whole of human existence.Dōgen wrote: “Although we have not yet abandoned life, we already see death.Although we have not yet abandoned death, we already see life. Life does notobstruct death, death does not obstruct life.”211 [notes.html#ch4_211] Elsewherehe had this to say: “There is life in death, and there is death in life. Thereis death that is always in death; there is life that is always in life. This isnot contrived by humans willfully, but Dharma comes to be like this.”212[notes.html#ch4_212]Dōgen developed the notions of the use of birth-and-death, and of the surrenderof birth-and-death to birth-and-death, as follows:You should know this: Birth-and-death is the daily activity of the Buddhaway;birth-and-death is the provision for a Buddhist. If you wish to use it, youshould use it; if you desire to understand it, it shall be understood. AllBuddhas clearly understand its various conditions and are skillful in using itfreely. If you are uninformed of the conditions of this birth-and-death, whowill call you a genuine Buddhist? Who will call you a person who understandslife lucidly and penetrates death thoroughly (ryōshōtasshi no kan)? [Thus, payattention to the following admonitions:] Do not listen to the idea that you havesunk low in birth-and-death; do not think you are in [the dualistic world of]birth-and-death; do not believe birth-and-death is merely birth-and-death; donot fail to understand [birth-and-death]; do not fail to discern[birth-and-death …The great Way of understanding life lucidly and penetrating death thoroughly, asis unequivocally clear, [further] has a time-honored adage: The great sagesurrenders (makasu) birth-and-death to the mind, surrenders birth-and-death tothe body, surrenders birth-and-death to the Way, and surrenders birth-and-deathto birth-and-death.213 [notes.html#ch4_213]To freely use and totally exert birth-and-death was the only way to penetrate itthoroughly and radically. Dōgen insisted that there was no way other than by“grasping it by practice” (gyōshu), in the spirit of surrender. In short, to useand to surrender (or self-power and other-power, if you will) were one and thesame. This was the “reason of total surrender” (ninnin no dōri), which enabledus to grasp by practice “our own home” (jiko no kakyō)—the nirvāṇa ofbirth-and-death.214 [notes.html#ch4_214]"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/ch5.jpg]toc.html#ch5CULTIC AND MORAL ENDEAVORS constituted one of two foci of Dōgen’s zazen-only(shikan-taza); the other consisted of the philosophic and mythopoeic endeavorsthat we discussed in the preceding chapter. Dōgen, in the latter part of hislife, gradually became more involved with the former orientation as hepassionately pursued a rigorous and “puritanic” monastic asceticism, through theestablishment of a monastic community and the education of monastics.When Dōgen returned from China in 1227, he immediately wrote the Fukan zazengi,in which he attempted to correct the errors and shortcomings of Tsung-che’sCh’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei, and thereby restore the spirit of the monastic ideal asenvisioned by Po-chang Huai-hai. Here again, we see Dōgen’s fascination with,and aspiration to, the classical period of Zen history. He finally retreatedfrom Kyoto to Echizen in 1243 and embarked upon the ambitious enterprise ofestablishing an ideal monastic community at the Eiheiji temple in this remoteregion.A deep love for the ascetic life characterized these two periods in Dōgen’slife. The second, the Echizen period, was marked by a more intensive andfull-fledged monastic asceticism; the passion and philosophy that motivatedDōgen at this time were fundamentally the same. For this reason, this period canbe seen as a total retreat from the world, although only in the most superficialsense. In actuality, it was Dōgen’s method of coping with his sense of pessimismtoward the practicability of universal monasticism in the intractable secularcontext. As a challenge to the world, he became entirely concerned with theeducation of a select few in order to exemplify his vision of an idealcommunity. In this regard, the ascetic endeavors of Dōgen and his followers wereintensely social as well as personal. Indeed they were intended to transform theworld as well as the self.BACKGROUND OF ZEN MONASTICISM [toc.html#ch5_h2_1]Our present knowledge of the origins of Zen monasticism in China is ratherobscure. According to a very reliable account,1 [notes.html#ch5_1] up until thethird ancestor Sêng-ts’an (d. 606), there was no formal communal life among theZen followers of Bodhidharma (d. 532), the last of twenty-eight Indian ancestorsand the first ancestor of Chinese Zen according to official Zen records. Zenteachers engaged in the ascetic practices of the mendicant’s life and had nofixed place where they could live communally with their disciples. However, thesituation changed significantly during the time of Tao-hsin (580–651) andHung-jên (601–674), the fourth and fifth ancestors respectively, both of whomsettled in fixed places and established monastic communities that wereeconomically self-sufficient. Each of them was said to have had some fivehundred disciples who cooperated in the maintenance of their communal life. Thiswas impressive indeed, given that in China, government aid was not available inthose days, the contributions of lay believers were scarce, and the mendicant’slife was virtually impracticable, if not impossible. These special circumstancesled Zen Buddhists to self-supporting activities such as the cultivation of landfor growing grain and vegetables, woodcutting, water-carrying, and so forth.Such a life was evidently a violation of the Buddhist vinaya, yet this was thebeginning of the sinicization of monastic life.2 [notes.html#ch5_2] Thus variousobservances, rules, and regulations were established for the maintenance of acommunal life. Such a practical change also led the monastics to regard manuallabor as spiritual discipline; Zen was now equated with every aspect of dailyliving. The scriptural teachings were interpreted according to the spirit ratherthan the letter. In addition, Zen was opened up to the laity in general.3[notes.html#ch5_3]Po-chang Huai-hai, though often said to be the originator of Zen monasticism(sōrin kaibyaku no so), was not in fact the originator as the foregoing cursoryobservations reveal, but rather the systematizer of the rules and practices ofZen monasteries that had been started by Tao-hsin. Not until Pochang was thesinicization and institutional independence of Zen completed, along withHui-nêng’s doctrinal reformation of Zen thought. Prior to that time, Zen hadremained tied to the vinaya monasteries, and hence, its identity had been ratherambiguous. Po-chang’s originality was therefore not so much doctrinal as it wasinstitutional. He not only synthesized the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna vinaya, butcreated a vision of a monastic community that distinguished Zen from all otherChinese schools and sects of Buddhism, and produced a uniquely Chinese Zenmonasticism.4 [notes.html#ch5_4]Po-chang’s greatest contribution was his articulation of the Zen spirit in andthrough moral disciplines and spiritual practices (ch’ing-kuei; shingi), asillustrated in the following.5 [notes.html#ch5_5] Unlike the customary way ofbuilding a Buddha hall, Po-chang built a Dharma hall where the monastic headdelivered lectures and sermons to the congregation. In addition to the Dharmahall that was of central focus in the community, there were the monastic head’sliving quarters, the monastics’ hall where trainees carried out theirmeditation, eating, and sleeping, and an administrative building. In themorning, the monastics had individual interviews with their teacher forspiritual counseling, and, in the evening, the monastic head gave lecturesbefore the assembly in the Dharma hall. Along with meditational sessions, theyengaged in manual labor (tso-wu; samu) to maintain their economic sufficiency. Afamous saying of Po-chang’s states, “a day without work—a day without eating”;he himself abided by this dictum rigorously. Po-chang appointed ten monasticofficers to oversee the monastic affairs through strict regulations thatpunished anyone who disturbed the harmony and peace of the monastery. Theseregulations were codified by Po-chang for the first time in the history ofChinese Zen.The streak of classicism in Dōgen’s thought was evident in his enthusiasm forand admiration of Po-chang’s monastic ideal. Dōgen admonished students ofBuddhism to observe the regulations and precepts of Po-chang with greatdiligence: “The Buddhist student should observe Po-chang’s monastic rules withthe utmost care.”6 [notes.html#ch5_6] As I have noted before and we shall seepresently, Dōgen aspired to the realization of this monastic ideal on Japanesesoil, and was the first in the history of Japanese Zen Buddhism to succeed inthis. The Kōshō-hōrinji temple, founded by Dōgen in 1233, was significant inthat it was the first attempt ever made by the Japanese to clearly distinguish“pure Zen” (junsui-zen) from other non-Zen schools of Buddhism as well as from“mixed Zen” (kenju-zen), the most common Japanese Zen in those days.7[notes.html#ch5_7] (One follower of mixed Zen was Eisai, the founder of theKenninji temple.) Despite his insistence on pure Zen, Dōgen conceived it in aparticularly Japanese context and, wherever and whenever necessary, did nothesitate to modify it. For example, when someone asked him whether a monasticshould beg for alms or not, Dōgen replied:Yes, you should. In this matter, however, you must take into consideration theclimate and customs [of a country in which you reside]. The reason is that youshould be concerned with the extension of other beings’ benefits and thedevelopment of your own practice. Regarding the method of alms begging, if youwear the monastic robe for walking on a dirty road, you will always soil it.Moreover, because of the poverty of the people, the prescribed way of begging[at seven houses] may not be practicable. Accordingly, your practice of the Waymay retrograde, and benefits to others may be impeded. If you observe thecustoms of the country and practice the Way in a proper manner, people from allwalks of life will offer alms unassumingly, and hence, the well-being of theself and others will be accomplished. In dealing with problems like this, whileyou are confronted with particular occasions and circumstances, you shouldponder upon their meanings, disregard what others may think of you, forget aboutyour own gains, and endeavor in whatever way to serve the Way as well as thegood of all sentient beings.8 [notes.html#ch5_8]As I have previously noted, Dōgen’s treatment of Tsung-che’s Ch’an-yüanch’ing-kuei reflected a similar critical attitude. Mention of other exampleswill be made later as our discussion continues.At this juncture, it would be worthwhile for us to recall some of the historicalcircumstances under which Dōgen’s thought, especially his monastic rigorism,developed. Dōgen’s original question on Mt. Hiei, as we saw before, wasconcerned with the doctrines of original enlightenment and ofthis-body-itself-is-Buddha, which became the ideological foundation of the moraland religious crisis of the time. Coupled with the general ethos of the Age ofDegenerate Law, these doctrines led too readily to the absolutization of thegiven, the pervasive sense of cynicism and fatalism, and the moral complacencyof the time. The late Heian and early Kamakura periods abounded with examples,such as, to name just a few, the accumulation of wealth and properties bypowerful monastics, the establishment of private temples by aristocrats fortheir personal and familial benefits, the degeneration of esoteric Buddhism intomagico-religious indulgence, the fashionable trend of aristocrats to becomemonastics (ironically enough) in order to secure worldly success, theinstitution of armed monastics contrary to the pacifist spirit of Buddhism, andthe indulgence in aesthetic hedonism.Under these circumstances, there emerged two different schools of thoughtconcerning Buddhist precepts (kairitsu) in the Kamakura period. One advocatedthe observance of the precepts as primary in Buddhism, whereas the otherrepudiated this, or at best regarded observance of the precepts as secondary tothe supremacy of faith. Roughly speaking, the former school of thought wasassociated with Zen Buddhism, the latter with Pure Realm Buddhism. These twotrends existed side by side in Kamakura Buddhism.9 [notes.html#ch5_9] Needlessto say, Dōgen belonged to the former tradition, as did Myōan Eisai, who wasequally eager to restore unremitting observance of the precepts—in his case boththe Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna precepts.10 [notes.html#ch5_10] As a matter of fact,the hallmark of Kamakura Zen was the advocacy of the “primacy of precepts”(kairitsu-isen) and of the “unity of meditation and precepts” (zenkai-itchi).Both Eisai and Dōgen concurred on this fundamental point of Zen Buddhism.Nevertheless, there were significant differences between them in severalrespects.11 [notes.html#ch5_11] Very briefly stated, they were: (1) Dōgenadvocated pure Zen, while Eisai advocated mixed Zen combined with the esotericBuddhism of the time;12 [notes.html#ch5_12] (2) Dōgen was more intent on thecodification of the monastic rules and regulations than Eisai; (3) Dōgeninterpreted the precepts in the context of his conception of zazen-only andsubsumed them in it; hence, he was critical of both Eisai’s view of the preceptsand the vinaya Buddhist view of the precepts, both of which regarded them asmore or less independent of zazen; (4) Dōgen adopted only the bodhisattva(Mahāyāna) precepts as necessary and sufficient, whereas Eisai advocated boththe bodhisattva precepts and the Hīnayāna precepts; and (5) regarding therelationship between the bodhisattva precepts and the monastic rules, Dōgentried to implement the precepts in the rules by codifying the details of themonastics’ daily behaviors whereas Eisai did not.This last statement is particularly significant for the purpose of ourinvestigation, because it refers to the heart of Dōgen’s thought—theritualization of morality. A prime characteristic of Dōgen’s thought lay in hispassionate search for the translation of moral visions—and hence spiritualvisions—into concrete and routine daily behaviors and activities of monasticlife. In this sense, he differed from his Chinese, as well as Japanese,predecessors and contemporaries. Scrupulous instructions, exhortations, andadmonitions with respect to rules, manners, virtues, and behavior were not codesthat bound the monastics’ outward movements, but were ritualized expressions andactivities of Buddha-nature and emptiness. Here we see the fundamental characterof Dōgen’s mystical realism, far from any kind of pedantic moralism.PURITY AND PURIFICATION [toc.html#ch5_h2_2]The themes of purity and purification occupied a vitally important place inDōgen’s thought. In two major chapters of the Shōbōgenzō, namely “Semmen” and“Senjō,” Dōgen expounded, admonished, and elaborated, meticulously andfastidiously, the rules, prescriptions, and instructions concerning washing theface; bathing the body; using the latrine; washing robes and bowls; cleansingthe mouth, teeth, and tongue; taking care of fingernails, toes and hair; andeven the acts of urination and excretion. All these cleansingactivities—undoubtedly some might be seen as exemplifying an obsession withcleanliness—constituted an integral part of the right Dharma of the Buddhas andancestors:In the Buddha-dharma the principles of cleansing with water are alwaysprescribed. To wash the body, to wash the mind, to wash the feet, to wash theface, to wash the eyes, to wash the mouth, to wash after the two acts ofurination and excretion, to wash the hands, to wash a bowl, to wash a robe, orto wash the head—all these acts comprise the right Dharma of the Buddhas andancestors of the three periods.13 [notes.html#ch5_13]Instead of going into all the details of these prescriptions, I will illustratewith just a few examples. Dōgen enjoined monastics to follow Buddha’s advice(though the source is not clear) for bathing and incense burning. Monasticsbathed their whole bodies in water, wore clothes as usual after bathing, kindledincense in a small incense burner, and fumigated their bosoms, robes, seats, andso forth. This cycle of bathing and fumigation was repeated three times, and wasfollowed by obeisance to Buddha, silent sūtra reading, zazen, and walking afterzazen. Before they resumed zazen, the monastics washed their feet.14[notes.html#ch5_14] Dōgen was very proud of adding the washroom (goka) to themonastics’ hall for the purpose of washing the face, and especially for cleaningthe teeth, which he greatly stressed. Dōgen wrote on this matter:Although in the Zen monasteries of great Sung nowadays the use of the toothcleaner has gone out of fashion and has not been transmitted for a long time,and hence, no place for it is provided, there is now a place for the use of thetooth cleaner here at the Eiheiji temple on Mt. Kichijō. This is my new idea.15[notes.html#ch5_15]Dōgen’s enthusiasm on this matter, perhaps in direct proportion to hisdisappointment in China, which was strongly expressed, was such that he tracedthe use of the tooth cleaner (yōji or shimoku) to the Brahmajāla sūtra where itwas one of the eighteen belongings (jūhachi-motsu) of a Mahāyāna monastic,declaring that “those who understand the meaning of the use or nonuse of thistooth cleaner are the bodhisattvas who understand the Buddha-dharma.”16[notes.html#ch5_16] When monastics used the tooth cleaner, they recited thefollowing gāthās:Holding the tooth cleaner in my hand,May I vow with sentient beings,To attain the right DharmaAnd purity spontaneously.And then:Using the tooth cleaner every morning,May I vow with sentient beings,To attain teeth strong enoughTo gnaw away all passions.17 [notes.html#ch5_17]Dōgen also underscored the importance of not growing long hair, fingernails, andtoenails. Here again, Dōgen recounted his experience with the widespreadpractice of monastics in China to grow long hair and fingernails, and rebukedthem for following the non-Buddhist way.18 [notes.html#ch5_18] Manners in thelatrine (tōsu) were also minutely specified. Monastics were instructed to keepthe latrine clean and tidy, to be silent and abstain from singing songs orconversing with others next to them, to be reverential and courteous to thosewaiting their turns, and so on. Dōgen’s instructions were lengthy andscrupulous, yet we cannot fail to appreciate his compassionate concern for theharmony and peace of the monastic community and the mutual benefits of itsmembers, and thereby for the sacredness of admittedly insignificant and ignobleactivities. Dōgen said that those with little learning in Buddhism thinkactivities in the latrine do not belong to the “venerable demeanor of theBuddhas and ancestors” (busso no iigi), but that this is wrong because theirobservation is based on the dualistic assumption that the defiled land (edo) ofthis world is not like the Pure Land (jōdo). Dōgen compared the Pure Land withthe defiled land of delusions and passions. And yet, the dualism did not applyto the venerable demeanor of the Buddhas and ancestors.19 [notes.html#ch5_19]Thus Dōgen boldly proclaimed: “Buddha finds an opportunity to turn the wheel ofDharma in the latrine.”20 [notes.html#ch5_20] I could enumerate Dōgen’sobsession with minutiae ad infinitum.The foregoing observations on cleansing can be adequately understood only in thecontext of Dōgen’s “metaphysic of purification,” which was consistent with hisgeneral thought pattern. He opened the subject of cleansing with reference tothe undefiled unity of enlightenment and practice. He wrote:Although the body and mind are undefiled, there is the teaching of cleansing thebody and mind. Not only do you cleanse the body-mind, but you also cleansecountries and [the place of meditation] under a tree. The lands might not becovered with dust and dirt, yet it is the desire of Buddhas to cleanse them.Even after attaining the fruition of enlightenment, they do not retreat from norabandon [their endeavors of cleansing]. Such a cardinal principle (shūshi) isdifficult to comprehend completely. Ritual conduct (sahō) is the cardinalprinciple; the realization of the Way is ritual conduct.21 [notes.html#ch5_21]He also said:In what we deem to be the genuine Dharma transmitted authentically through theBuddhas and ancestors, bathing the body, as it is put into action, cleansesinstantly—both the inside and outside of the bodymind, the viscera, the personaland environmental rewards of karma, the inside, outside, and middle of theentire reality and the entire space. When you purify yourself by incense andflowers, the past, present, and future, all the karmic conditions, and all theactivities of existence will be purified instantaneously.22 [notes.html#ch5_22]In the same vein, Dōgen argued elsewhere:As you bathe, even the four elements, even the five skandhas, and evenindestructible nature will be clean and pure without exception. This should notbe understood to mean that undefiledness is attained only after you cleanse thebody with water. How can water be originally pure or impure? Even if it isoriginally pure or impure, you do not say it can make clean or unclean the placeto which water eventually flows. Only when you maintain the practice andenlightenment of the Buddhas and ancestors, will the Buddha-dharma of washingand bathing be imparted. As you practice and confirm bathing, according to thisprinciple, you transcend purity, surpass impurity, and cast off neither puritynor impurity.Thus in spite of being not yet defiled, you bathe your body; although you arealready supremely pure, you cleanse yourself. This truth is preserved only inthe Way of the Buddhas and ancestors. None of the non-Buddhists know it.23[notes.html#ch5_23]This amounted, in the final analysis, to saying: “By way of using emptiness, youcleanse emptiness; by way of moving emptiness, you bathe your bodymind.”24[notes.html#ch5_24] Every act of cleansing and washing was not only ritualized,sacramentalized, and sanctified, but philosophized and rationalized in theunique logic of emptiness.Purification was not an attempt to be liberated from pollutions, sins, orguilts, whether physical, moral, or spiritual, but was the self-affirmation oforiginal purity or emptiness undefiled by dualism. It was neither the removal ofimpurity nor the seeking of purity—one was defiled only by a belief in thedichotomous existence of purity and impurity. Thus, the act of purification wasfundamentally based on original purity, the former being the self-enactment ofthe latter. Only when this was realized did the rites of purification embody theundefiled unity of enlightenment and practice.25 [notes.html#ch5_25] This waswhy Dōgen said: “What is significant in this [cleansing] is not cleaning one’sbody with water so much as it is preserving the Buddha-dharma by theBuddha-dharma itself. This is called washing.”26 [notes.html#ch5_26] Together,the body, the act of cleansing, and water comprised Dharma itself.It is no wonder that Dōgen regarded the rites of purification with utmostseriousness. He warned his disciples against the commonsense view that bathingwas nothing but the cleansing of the bodily surface; on the contrary, it was arite in and through which the three periods and the ten directions of theuniverse, the Buddhas and ancestors, the interior and exterior of the body-mind,the vital organs, and all existences—spiritual and temporal, and even beyondspace and time—were purified. For this reason, the Pure Land, the sublimeBuddha-land, was actualized here and now on this earth.27 [notes.html#ch5_27]Dōgen’s seriousness about this subject was well-reflected in the fact that hepresented and explicated the “Semmen” chapter of the Shōbōgenzō on threedifferent occasions—an emphasis unique to that particular chapter of his book.28[notes.html#ch5_28]The activities revolving around food, whether preparing meals or eating, were anintegral part of the monastic life. The sanctity of these activities, manners,and attitudes with respect to preparing and taking meals was well-testified toin Dōgen’s works. The monastic community had two main meals a day, the morningmeal of gruel and the midday meal of cooked rice, and abstained from eatingbetween midday and the following morning, though this was only in principle.29[notes.html#ch5_29] All the foods, prepared or taken, had to be pure. Dōgen’sconcern with absolute poverty was reflected in this case as well. He said:Three types of food—the fruits of trees and plants, food obtained from begging,and food donated by the devotees—all these are pure foods (shōjō-jiki). The fourtypes of food obtained through the means of farmers, merchants, warriors, andartisans are without exception impure foods (fujō-jamyō no jiki) and not themonastics’ foods.30 [notes.html#ch5_30]Dōgen also wrote:You should not arrange in advance for the supply of your clothing and food.Even as regards the places of alms begging, to plan beforehand where and fromwhom to beg alms in case you should run out of food is tantamount to storing upprovisions, and is the same as the defiled livelihood. Monastics are like theclouds and have no fixed abode; like flowing water, they have nothing to dependon—hence they are called monastics. Even if they each possess nothing other thana bowl and a robe, to rely upon even one supporter or to have in mind even onehousehold of relatives is bondage for the self and others alike; hence the foodis impure.If one, whose body and mind are nourished by such unclean livelihood, desires toattain and understand the great Dharma of Buddhas’ purity, it is altogetherimpossible.31 [notes.html#ch5_31]It is not known how consistently Dōgen maintained his alleged economicindependence or his interpretation of pure food, given the ever-growing numberof monastics at the Eiheiji temple. Nevertheless, Dōgen’s absolute poverty cancertainly be seen as an ideal with respect to the problem of food andlivelihood.32 [notes.html#ch5_32]In the Tenzo-kyōkun, Dōgen took up the matter of cooking and gave minuteinstructions to his disciples, especially the chief cook of the monastery. Thiswas in line with his ideal of restoring the monastic vision of Po-chang Huai-haiin Japan, as I have noted on several occasions. Dōgen frequently referred to andquoted from Ch’ang-lu Tsung-che’s Ch’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei for guidance andinspiration, and also made references to Kueishan Ling-yu (771–853), Tung-shanShou-ch’u (?–990), and Hsüeh-fêng Its’un (822–908), all of whom were said tohave been chief cooks for some time during their monastic careers. Following theChinese monastic practice of the Sung period, Dōgen regarded the chief cook asone of the six highest officers (chiji) in the monastery; this was unheard of inJapan at that time.33 [notes.html#ch5_33]Drawing upon the Ch’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei, Dōgen set forth the functions andresponsibilities of the chief cook. First and foremost, he was to nurturemonastics and ensure their well-being and peace (anraku). Elsewhere, Dōgen usedthe phrase the “act of nurturing the holy womb” (shōtai chōyō no gō). The chiefcook bore full responsibility for nourishing monastics not only physically, butalso morally and spiritually. He was not just a cook or dietician in the modernsense, but was truly a religious leader. Every act of his duty was performedwith the aspiration of enlightening and benefiting others (dōshin). This meant,in the final analysis, that the monastic meals were not merely a means tophysical sustenance, or even to spiritual sustenance for that matter, but ratherdaily communal feasts that celebrated the enactment of the body-mind cast-off.Eating itself was a spiritual matter.34 [notes.html#ch5_34]Some significant highlights of the cook’s responsibility may be illustrated: (1)The handling and cooking of grains and vegetables had to be done with the utmostcare and reverence. For example, the white water from washing rice was notwastefully thrown away. The chief cook inspected every minute process of foodpreparation with vigilance, sincerity, and diligence. Thus the chief cook wasadept in distinguishing the six kinds of taste (bitter, sour, sweet, hot, salty,and insipid) and possessed the three virtues of cookery (mildness, cleanliness,and courteousness). Moreover, the chief cook had to cultivate the joyous mind(kishin) that was joyous for the opportunity of human existence; the solicitousmind (rōshin) that had the disposition of parents taking care of their children;and the magnanimous mind (daishin) that was unbiased and fair to all beings. (2)Immediately after the midday meal, the chief cook consulted with all otherofficers on the menus and provisions for the next day, and announced the resulton the bulletin boards in the monastic head’s quarters and in the library. Theimplication was that eating was the business of the entire commune. (3) Thechief cook was to live in the spirit of absolute poverty—absolutenonpossession—regardless of quality and quantity of food materials. “Day andnight, allow provisions to enter and dwell in your mind; allow your mind toreturn to provisions and dwell in them. Together with the provisions innonduality, you practice the Way assiduously.”35 [notes.html#ch5_35] Richnesswas unlimited in such absolute poverty. (4) When food was prepared, the chiefcook placed it on the table in the kitchen, wore the surplice, spread a rug onthe ground, faced the monastics’ hall (sōdō), burned incense, and bowed ninetimes. Only after this observance was food carried to the monastics’ hall forconsumption. (5) In preparing a meal, the chief cook was not concerned withdelicacy, but with dispositions of the mind, no matter what materials were used.Dōgen wrote:It is not necessarily good to prepare a refined dish of exquisite taste(daigomi), nor is it necessarily bad to cook a plain vegetable soup (fusaikō).When you pick and select vegetables, do so with a mind of fidelity, sincerity,and purity, just as you do in cooking the finest dish. The reason for this isthat when monastics congregate in the great ocean of the pure Buddha-dharma,they are not concerned with exquisite taste, nor plain taste, but only with thetaste of a single great ocean. Still more, in nourishing the buds of the Way(dōge) and nurturing the holy womb (shōtai), the refined dish and the plain soupare one thusness, not two. There is an ancient saying: “The mouth of a monasticis just like a cooking stove.” You should keep this in mind. Reflect upon this:Plain vegetables feed the holy womb and sustain the buds of the Way. You shouldnot disdain or make light of them. Indeed, a spiritual leader of the heavenlyworld and the human world is the one who executes the transforming efficacy [forsentient beings] of plain vegetables.36 [notes.html#ch5_36]This transforming efficacy was likened to “build[ing] a great temple by makinguse of a grass, and turn[ing] the great wheel of Dharma by entering into aparticle of dust.” Dōgen further wrote: “You hold a vegetable and change it intoBuddha’s body of one jō and six shaku, and invite Buddha and alter him into avegetable. [The chief cook is] the one who brings forth miraculous powers andtransformations, promoting Buddha’s affairs and sentient beings’ welfare.”37[notes.html#ch5_37] This was precisely the religious-metaphysical significanceof cookery as Dōgen conceived it. Lastly, (6) the monastic kitchen was oftencalled “the department of fragrance” (kōshakukyoku or kōjakukyoku) in the Zentradition; this reference was derived from the “Buddha-land of fragrance” whereTathāgata Kōjaku was said to reside. Dōgen admonished his disciples to exercisethe utmost reverence and the most courteous language in relation to food.Decorum and speech worthy of the department of fragrance were stronglyrecommended. For example, Dōgen urged monastics to use honorific expressionssuch as on-kayu, on-toki, and on-shiru, when speaking of gruel (kayu), cookedrice (toki), and soup (shiru). Kitchen utensils were handled respectfully. Whenpreparing a meal, the monastic recited scriptural passages or sayings of theancestors, instead of engaging in worldly gossip.38 [notes.html#ch5_38]Receiving and taking a meal in the monastic’s bowl (gyōhatsu) was a solemn andjoyous occasion in monastic life. Monastics reflected upon the “gāthās of fivemeditations” (gokan no ge), which were: (1) indebtedness to the pains of thepeople who provided food, (2) consideration of whether the monastics deserved toreceive the food, (3) restraint from greed and excessive eating, (4) food asmedicine to heal hunger and thirst and nourish the body, and (5) food as takenfor the sake of the Way and enlightenment.39 [notes.html#ch5_39] What was mostnoteworthy in connection with the ritual of eating was Dōgen’s “metaphysic ofeating.” He said the following:A sūtra [the Vimalakırti-nirdeśa sūtra] says: “When you are nondual with youreating, all things are nondual as well; if all things are nondual, you are alsonondual in your eating.”Just let Dharma be one with your eating, and let your eating be one with Dharma.For this reason, if Dharma is Dharma-nature, food is also Dharma-nature. IfDharma is thusness, food is also thusness. If Dharma is One Mind, food is alsoOne Mind. If Dharma is enlightenment, food is also enlightenment.… Therefore,the act of eating constitutes the Dharma of all things. This can be fullycomprehended only by and among Buddhas. At the very moment when you eat, you areof ultimate reality, essence, substance, energy, activity, and causation. SoDharma is eating, and eating is Dharma. This Dharma is enjoyed by Buddhas of thepast and future. This eating is full of the joy of Dharma and the bliss ofmeditation.40 [notes.html#ch5_40]Eating (jiki) was the celebration of Dharma (hō) with no hiatus between them inthe samādhi of self-fulfilling activity (jijuyū-zammai) and in the samādhi ofplay (yuge-zammai).Dōgen’s treatment of the monastic’s bowl (hatsuu or hau), originally the almsbowl, was also characteristic of his metaphysic of eating. He declared:The Buddha bowl is the Buddha bowl—you should never regard it as [made of] stoneor baked clay or iron or wood.Indeed, the Buddha bowl is not an artifact; it neither arises nor perishes,neither comes nor goes, neither gains nor loses. It does not extend over new andold, nor does it concern itself with past and present.41 [notes.html#ch5_41]The bowl was called a “miraculous utensil (kidoku no chōdo)—miraculous, becauseit was used in a “miraculous event” (kidoku no koto), in a “miraculous occasion”(kidoku no jisetsu), and by a “miraculous person” (kidoku no hito). Thus, “Onthis account, where a miraculous event is realized, there is a miraculousbowl.”42 [notes.html#ch5_42]Absolute simplicity, poverty, and purity were also epitomized in Dōgen’streatment of the monastic’s robes. Traditionally, the Buddhist monastic wasallowed to possess only three robes, called “tattered robes” (funzōe or nōe)because they were made of dirty, useless rags thrown away by the common people.The lowliest material, symbolic of worldly defilement, was transformed into themonastic’s robes (kesa), the symbol of purity.43 [notes.html#ch5_43] “What theworld discards, the Way uses.”44 [notes.html#ch5_44] Dōgen wrote:Such materials, obtained from discarded clothes and/or through undefiledlivelihood, are neither silk nor cotton. They are not gold or silver, not gemsor brocades, or the like; they are nothing other than tattered clothes. Thistattered robe is neither for shabbiness nor for finery, but only for theBuddha-dharma.45 [notes.html#ch5_45]Again and again, Dōgen exalted the mysterious merits and efficacies of therobe.46 [notes.html#ch5_46] He observed that the monastic’s robe was called the“robe of liberation” (gedatsu-buku), the “robe of the blessed field”(fukuden’e), the “robe of no-thought” (musōe), the “robe of great compassion”(daiji-daihi-e), and so on. The robe of liberation was the body-mind of theBuddhas and ancestors. He exalted the so-called ten victories or merits of themonastic’s robe—for example, the covering and protection of the body.Furthermore, the robe was the symbol of Buddha’s purity (hyōshiki) indestroying, for the monastic as well as for others, passions, delusions, greed,and guilt.47 [notes.html#ch5_47]Dōgen gave detailed instructions on how to make, wear, and wash robes and whatmaterials to choose for them. Before monastics wore, took off, or washed theirrobes, they were advised to place them on their heads and recite, with the handsin gasshō, the following gāthā:Great is the robe of liberation,The robe of the blessed field and of no-thought.Wearing it, we shall uphold the teachings of Tathāgata,And liberate all sentient beings.48 [notes.html#ch5_48]In Dōgen’s thought, even the matter of monastics’ clothing had a metaphysicalsignificance. To him, what one wore was what one was. Unless this was the case,purity was not total. As I have mentioned already, a monastic’s robe, which was“tattered,” was a monastic’s robe that assumed a unique significance, preciselybecause it did not depend on purity and defilement, or “silk and cotton.” Thetattered robe was undefiled by the duality of purity and impurity, of finery andshabbiness. Dōgen wrote, for instance:For the materials [for making a monastic robe], you use silk or cotton accordingto circumstances. Cotton is not necessarily pure nor is silk necessarily impure.There is no reason why you should dislike cotton and select silk. It is alaughable thing to do. Buddha’s traditional teaching on this matter is alwaysthat the tattered clothes are best.… Rejecting a [dualistic] view of silk andcotton, you must penetrate into the meaning of “tattered.” …You should understand this: Among the tattered cloth you pick up, there may besome cotton-like silk and some silk-like cotton. People are all different andwhat they make and wear are hard to imagine. Your naked eyes cannot distinguish[different kinds of cloth from one another]. Upon obtaining such materials, youshould not argue over whether they are silk or cotton: they are simply calledtattered cloth.… When you accept faithfully the truth that tattered cloth isneither silk nor cotton, neither gold-silver nor gems, what tattered cloth trulyis will be realized. Unless you cast off the [dualistic] understanding of silkand cotton, you will never understand [the true meaning of] tattered cloth inthe slightest.49 [notes.html#ch5_49]Elsewhere, Dōgen held: “This [purity] not only surpasses the limits of purityand impurity, but transcends the realm of enlightenment and delusion. It doesnot contend with the dualism of form and mind; it has no bearing upon merits anddemerits.”50 [notes.html#ch5_50] This purity was not a matter of clothes but ofbeing; the monastic’s tattered robe was the embodiment of this being. Dōgen’simport was not a critique of materialism, though severe indictments of thematerialism of the worldly minded in Kyoto and Kamakura in those days were by nomeans lacking in his writings. It is abundantly clear to us by now that Dōgenalmost despaired at the insatiable and inveterate search for fame, wealth,power, knowledge, and so forth. Yet he himself did not fall into this pitfall ofworldliness. The nondualistic metaphysic of clothing made possible a radicalfreedom from greed and delusion, in the material as well as spiritual life.Zen monastics were called “clouds and water” (unsui) to symbolize theirhomelessness (shukke) and possession of only absolutely minimal necessities andbelongings, like floating clouds and flowing water. “Monastics are like theclouds and have no fixed abode; like flowing water, they have nothing to dependon—hence they are called monastics.”51 [notes.html#ch5_51] The monastic dwellingfor the community of monks and nuns, therefore, had to be consistent with thisideal of poverty, simplicity, and purity. As in other cases, Dōgen exalted theancient tradition of living under a tree and in the forest, asserting itscontinuity in Zen monasticism.52 [notes.html#ch5_52] For example, Ejō attributedthe following speech to Dōgen in the Shōbōgenzō zuimonki:Dōgen said: “When Zen teacher Fang-hui [992–1049] of Mt. Yangch’i became thehead of the monastery, its buildings were so dilapidated that the monastics werequite worried about them. Then the officer in charge of the matter recommendedto him: ‘The buildings should be repaired.’ Fang-hui said: ‘Even though thebuildings are crumbling, it is still better than living in the open air or underthe trees. If one place is damaged and the rain leaks in, you should sit inanother where the rain does not leak in and practice zazen. If monastics’enlightenment is dependent on building temples and edifices, they should bebuilt even with gold and gems. Enlightenment does not depend on the quality ofyour dwelling-place but solely on how much you endeavor to do zazen.’ The nextday he preached as follows: ‘When Yang-ch’i first became the monastery’s head,the roofs and walls were falling to pieces. Snowflakes were scattered on thefloors like rare gems, and the monastics ducked their heads and sighed inlamentation. We thought all the more of ancient sages who lived under thetrees.’“This is true not only of the Buddha-way but also of the way of government.Emperor T’ai-tsung [of the T’ang dynasty] did not build a new palace [but livedin the old one instead].“Lung-ya Chü-tun [835–923] once said: ‘To study the Way, it is imperative thatyou learn poverty before everything. Only after you study poverty and becomepoor can you become intimate with the Way.’ Ever since the time of Buddha tilltoday we have neither seen nor heard of any true student of the Way inpossession of wealth.”53 [notes.html#ch5_53]Elsewhere, Dōgen admonished his disciples in connection with his exaltation ofthe deeds of Kuei-shan Ling-yu (771–853):When you want to build a temple, do not exercise frail judgments, but strengthenthe sustained practice of the Buddha-dharma. The ancient Buddhas’ training hallwas comprised of spiritual discipline, not of an edifice. The tradition ofliving in the open air and under the trees reverberates from the far-off days.Such places have become the fixed places [of the training hall] for ages. Whenthere is even a single person’s sustained practice, it is imparted to thetraining hall of Buddhas. So, the fools of these latter days should not be bentuselessly on the architectural splendors of temples. The Buddhas and ancestorshave never desired temples and pavilions. Those fools aimlessly erect temples,edifices, and monasteries without the awareness of their primary purpose, whichis not to consecrate abodes to Buddhas at all, but to make them the caves oftheir own fame and wealth.54 [notes.html#ch5_54]For Dōgen, a shabby hut or a poor thatched cottage was most consistent with thetradition of living in the open air and under a tree; he considered such shelterto essentially be the training hall (dōjō—literally “the field of the Way”),with a boundary (kekkai) founded upon radical emptiness. The sanctity of thisboundary signified not so much a dualism of the sacred and profane as anexpression of the nonduality of emptiness. Paradoxically, this boundary was anexpression of boundary-less-ness. As Dōgen wrote, “When a quarter of land formsa boundary, the entire world is bounded by it.”55 [notes.html#ch5_55] Moreover,the dwelling he advocated was the prototype for both monastics and laity: “Theancients lived under the trees and dwelled in the forest. Such is the abode bothlay people and monastics love.”56 [notes.html#ch5_56]The Zen monastery (sōrin or zenrin) was patterned after the ideal of a primitiveBuddhist settlement (vihāra; shōja), culminating in Zen Buddhism in the form ofseven halls (shichidō-garan). We are told: “The layout and structure of what wenow call a Zen monastery are nothing other than the personal instruction of theancestors, hence the direct transmission of the right heirs [of the Way]. Thus,the Seven Past Buddhas’ old rule is entirely embodied in a Zen monastery.”57[notes.html#ch5_57] Furthermore: “If you plan to build a training hall orestablish a monastery, you shall follow the principles rightly transmitted bythe Buddhas and ancestors.”58 [notes.html#ch5_58] From these statements we canreasonably conjecture that Dōgen was faithful to the basic building pattern ofthe Zen monastery, particularly that of the Ching-tê-ssŭ monastery on Mt.T’ien-t’ung, where he had studied previously.59 [notes.html#ch5_59]The basic layout of a seven-hall monastery consisted of the entrance (sammon),the Buddha hall (butsuden), the Dharma hall (hattō)—in ascending order on thecentral axis—and the latrine (tōsu or shiijin), the bath (yokushitsu oryūshitsu), the monastics’ hall (sōdō), and the kitchen (kuri or kuin)—on bothsides of the axis. These halls were connected by corridors. The entrance to themonastery was called the “mountain gate” (sammon), symbolizing the entrance intothe realm of purity, liberation, and emptiness through the purging of passionsand delusions. It was also called the “three gates” (sammon) or the “gate ofthreefold liberation” (sangedatsu-mon). The Buddha hall was designed for theworship of the image of Śākyamuni Buddha and his two attendant bodhisattvas:Mañjuśrī (Monju) to his left and Samantabhadra (Fugen) to his right. The Dharmahall, behind the Buddha hall, was the place where lectures and sermons weregiven to the monks and nuns by the monastic head. Between the entrance and theBuddha hall were the bath to the right and latrine to the left, both of whichepitomized the purification of bodily defilement; the use of these two wasminutely specified as discussed before. Above these buildings were themonastics’ hall to the left and the kitchen to the right—both symbolizing thenourishment of mind and body. Incidentally, monastics were ordered to be silentin the monastics’ hall, the bath, and the latrine; thus they were called the“three halls of silence” (sammokudō). The physical layout of the monastery wasanalogous to the human body,60 [notes.html#ch5_60] or according to Dōgen,represented the casting-off of the body-mind.The actual buildings of the monastery were more than these seven halls, sincethere were additions to them. At the top of the central axis were the monastichead’s quarters (hōjō), for example. Also prominent in the Sōtō tradition werethe washroom (goka) at the back of the monastics’ hall, and the library(shuryō), where monastics studied the sūtras and classics. These edifices werethe functional equivalent of the shabby huts and poor thatched cottages thatwere the habitats of the ancient sages.What distinguished Dōgen’s Sōtō tradition from other Zen traditions, withrespect to the problem of monastic building, was twofold: the restoration of themonastics’ hall and the emphasis on the monastic library. Dōgen’s conception ofthe monastic ideal of Po-chang Huai-hai revolved around a monastics’ hall wheretrainees not only meditated but also ate and slept—that is, carried out theirdaily activities. When he founded the Kōshō-hōrinji temple, with the building ofthe monastics’ hall in 1236, his was the first example in Japan of the Zenmonastic tradition of Po-chang, which treated the monastics’ hall as the centerof the monastery.61 [notes.html#ch5_61] In contrast, the tradition of themeditation hall (zendō) arrangement dictated that sleeping and eating had to bedone in separate halls and that the meditation hall was used strictly forzazen.62 [notes.html#ch5_62] Thus, there were significant differences betweenthe monastics’ hall and the meditation hall.In Dōgen’s monastics’ hall, each trainee was assigned a seat (zashō) thatoccupied an absolutely minimal space for meditation, eating, and sleeping, andthat was provided with a small closet (kanki) where belongings were stored. Aportion of the edge of the seat (jōen) served as both a table for meals and aplace to lay the head for sleeping. The monastics’ hall enshrined Mañjuśrī asthe holy mentor (shōsō)—not as an attendant of Śākyamuni Buddha, as in theBuddha hall, but as a spiritual guide for monastics. The monastics’ halladjoined the washroom, which was restored by Dōgen as the place for washing theface and hands, and particularly for cleaning the teeth with a tooth cleaner. AsI have noted, Dōgen was especially proud of having restored the washroom.Another important place in monastic life was the library (shuryō), wheremonastics engaged in the silent reading of Buddhist sūtras and Zen classics. (Itwas also used for occasional tea drinking and other activities, but they weresecondary.) It represented the academic side of monastic life, but certainly didnot solely support the scholarly pursuit of Buddhist scriptural and doctrinalstudies, as we shall see later in a different context. In accordance with afamily precept (kakun) of Zen—“the teaching of the ancient sages as a guide tothe illumination of the mind” (kokyō-shōshin)—its function was to guidemonastics in reflecting on their minds and hearts through the study of thesūtras. This activity was carried out around the enshrined image ofAvalokiteśvara (Kannon) as the “holy monastic of the library” (shuryō no shōsō).As Miyasaka points out, the monastic library was separated from the monastics’hall probably during the Southern Sung period (1127–1279) when each majormonastery in China had a large-scale library, indicating the rigor of scripturalstudies in those days—an important factor that should not be forgotten. Dōgen’sintroduction of the monastic library in Japan, following the lead of ChineseZen, became the precursor of Zen educational institutions in modern Japan.63[notes.html#ch5_63]NATURE: THE MOUNTAINS AND WATERS [toc.html#ch5_h2_3]Dōgen once wrote:From the timeless beginning have mountains been the habitat of great sages. Wiseones and sages have all made mountains their secret chambers and their bodiesand minds; by them mountains are realized.… When sages and wise ones reside inmountains, mountains belong to them [i.e., there is no hiatus between them andmountains]; therefore, trees and rocks flourish in their luxuriance, birds andanimals are full of divine auspiciousness. This is so because they enjoy thevirtues of these sages and wise ones. You must know that mountains really takedelight in wise ones and sages.64 [notes.html#ch5_64]Dōgen chose a monastery near the mountains and waters (sansui) instead of near acity, with its worldly people and their activities. However, Dōgen’srelationship to “the mountains and waters” was not the romantic exaltation ofthem that we see, for example, in the religion of nature mysticism, any morethan it was the scientific and technological manipulation and exploitation ofnature. Temperamentally and culturally, Dōgen could not think of religion otherthan in the context of mountains and waters; yet this was not the same as anaive veneration or exaltation of nature, which was for him a defiled view ofnature that enslaved humans in a new captivity. Hence, he was not a sort ofnature mystic, as I shall show in what follows.In the Shōbōgenzō, “Mujō-seppō,” Dōgen presented a rather unusual view ofnature. Speaking of “discourse on Dharma” (seppō) and “insentient beings” (mujō)in an extraordinary way, similar to his approach to other words and symbols, hewrote:The way insentient beings expound Dharma should not be understood to benecessarily like the way sentient beings expound Dharma. On the basis of thevoices of sentient beings and the way they expound Dharma, if you usurp thevoices of the sentient and conjecture those of the insentient in terms of them,that is not the Buddha-way.… To see grasses and plants, tiles and pebbles, andconstrue them as the insentient is insufficient learning; to regard theinsentient as grasses and plants, and tiles and pebbles is unsatisfactory aswell.65 [notes.html#ch5_65]Insentient beings are often conceived of as comprising the physical universe, orwhat we call nature, which we think of as actually dead, and only figurativelyand anthropomorphically speak of in human terms. Human beings, unwittingly orselfishly, anthropomorphize nature but think that nature is, after all,lifeless. To put it another way, we draw a boundary between the sentient and theinsentient, to the degree that we perceive and judge in a particular way with aparticular nature. This might lead us to judge that the insentient is not ableto communicate. Dōgen repudiated such a notion. From the standpoint of the Way,insentient beings did elucidate Dharma, not in human languages but through theirown expressions (dōtoku). Indeed, they were “alive” in their own way; in Dōgen’sphraseology, insentient beings were “sentient.”66 [notes.html#ch5_66] In linewith his thesis that all existence was sentient beings, which we examinedearlier, Dōgen’s use of the term “sentient beings” (shujō or ujō) subsumed boththe sentient and insentient, constituting all existence and in turn, being onewith Buddha-nature (shitsuu-busshō). This was not the same as confounding thetwo as having a certain psychic commonality, in the fashion of panpsychism, butrather, seeing them within the context of Buddha-nature, which defied anymetaphysical commitment to such a substantialistic resolution.Dōgen told the story of Su Tung-p’o (1036–1101), a well-known Sung poet ofChina, who was enlightened one night by the sounds of brooks. The occasion wasexplained by Dōgen himself. One day Chao-chio Ch’ang-tsung (1025–1091), the Zenmentor of the poet, preached on the discourse of insentient beings and its greatimportance for poetic creativity, but Su Tung-p’o could not quite understand itsfull significance. One day when Su Tung-p’o visited the famous resort of Lu-shanand spent a night there, he was suddenly awakened by the sounds of mountainbrooks flowing in the silence of the night. This was the moment of hisenlightenment; he composed the following poem:The sounds of the streams are [Buddha’s] long, broad tongue[i.e., his discourse on Dharma],The sights of the mountains are his pure body;Eighty-four thousand gāthās throughout the night—How can I expound them to others some day?67 [notes.html#ch5_67]And Dōgen commented:The night when this lay poet was enlightened is [related to the fact] thatpreviously he heard from Teacher Ch’ang-tsung about insentient beings’ sermonson Dharma. Although he was not immediately enlightened by his teacher’sdiscourse, the stream sounds struck him as if raging waves were soaring into thesky. Thus the stream sounds now awaken Su Tung-p’o. Is this the working of thestream sounds, or is it Chao-chio’s discourse flowing into [the ears of SuTung-p’o]? I suspect that Chao-chio’s talk on the sermon of insentient beings,still reverberating, may secretly be intermingled with the nightly sounds ofstreams. Can anyone dare to understand [what entered Su Tung-p’o’s ears]—a pintof water, or an ocean into which all rivers enter? Ultimately speaking, is itthe poet that is enlightened or is it the mountains and waters that areenlightened? Those who have the discerning eyes should never fail to understandBuddha’s long, broad tongue and his pure body.68 [notes.html#ch5_68]Here, Chao-chio’s discourse and the stream sounds were inseparably interfused soas to make Su Tung-p’o’s enlightenment possible. As Dōgen observed, it was verydifficult to say whether this was Su Tung-p’o’s enlightenment or theenlightenment of the mountains and waters.69 [notes.html#ch5_69] Humanity andnature, however, mutually partook of each other and worked with one another asthe twin activities of Buddha-nature and emptiness; they were not two separateentities, but one. Nature was alive in its own right and spoke in its own way,in and through us. Thus:When you endeavor in right practice, the sounds and sights of the streams andthe sights and sounds of the mountains, together with you, bounteously delivereighty-four thousand gāthās. Just as you are unsparing in surrendering your fameand wealth and your body-mind, so are the streams and mountains.70[notes.html#ch5_70]In short, humans and nature co-created “eighty-four thousand gāthās” by beingenlightened together and by becoming Buddha contemporaneously.Dōgen dealt with many subjects of nature in his works, such as mountains,waters, flowers, the moon, and the four seasons. However, he used these commonwords or metaphors in a way in which their ordinary meanings were not extendedor expanded to describe extraordinary events other than themselves; instead,their ordinary meanings were radicalized through the logic of the total exertionof a single thing (ippō-gūjin) within his mystical realist framework. Amountain, for example, was affirmed not in the ordinary sense of the mountain asan object of knowing by a subject; a mountain, which could be perceptually orintellectually manipulated, was not the mountain Dōgen had in mind. He said:You should realize this: Mountains are neither of the human world nor of theheavenly world. Do not judge mountains by human standards. If you do not applythe human view of flowing to them, who can entertain a doubt about the flowingor not-flowing of mountains?71 [notes.html#ch5_71]In the radical living of total exertion, the ordinary metaphor of a mountain wasundefiled by subject-object dualism and realized the totality of the universe inthe single moment or event of thusness. In this total exertion, one lived onething at a time, in its total thusness and nothing else. This was why Dōgenquoted the following from Yün-mên Wên-yen (864–949): “A mountain is a mountain;water is water.” This statement represented the essence of Zen itself. It was aspecial way of life that rendered, to nonhuman and nonliving beings, theirfull-fledged metaphysical and religious status, and saw to it that theseinsentient beings were, ultimately speaking, regarded as neither sentient norinsentient, neither created nor uncreated, just like human beings. After all,all existence was empty and unattainable (fukatoku) according to Dōgen’sthought.72 [notes.html#ch5_72]The logical structure of Dōgen’s view of nature, explained above, can be amplysubstantiated by illustrations from his works. Dōgen wrote:Consequently, water is the palace of the true dragon [the truly enlightened]. Itdoes not flow downward (ruraku) [the word has the connotation of sinking infortune]. To regard water as only flowing is tantamount to slandering water. Inother words, [that view] will force you to [dualistically] say not-flowing.Water is water only in its true nature of thusness (nyoze-jissō): this is thevirtue of “water is water.” It is not flowing. As you penetrate the flowing andnot-flowing of a single drop of water, the ultimate character of all things isinstantly realized.73 [notes.html#ch5_73]Here, water was not ordinary water as spoken of in ordinary conversation; it was“ultimate water,” so to speak. For this reason, Dōgen held that water flowedupward and downward, freely in all directions.74 [notes.html#ch5_74] Water, aswe perceive and name it from the human perspective, was dependent on theconditions and causes of the total situation in which we presently live. Whathumans designate as water was seen by a fish as a palace, by a heavenly being asa jeweled necklace, and by a hungry spirit as raging flames or thick blood.75[notes.html#ch5_75] Hence, the water in question was not that water which wehumans named, but that water—empty and indeterminate—out of which all thesepossibilities were created according to given conditions and causes. Primordialwater in its emptiness was what Dōgen apprehended in and through ordinary water.Dōgen wrote: “Water is neither strong or weak, wet or dry, dynamic or static.Nor is it warm or cold, being or nonbeing, enlightenment or delusion.”76[notes.html#ch5_76] It goes without saying that such an ultimate water, orWater, was not the denial of ordinary water so much as it was the radicalizationof it in its total exertion, or rather the de-anthropocentricization of water ifyou will.Having such a perspective, Dōgen was not disquieted by such statements as “TheEastern Mountain moves on the water.”77 [notes.html#ch5_77] The miraculous andextraordinary were quite natural in his eyes. A “love” of nature, in Dōgen’sthought, was not a deification of nature, but the radicalization of nature inits selflessness. Only then was nature undefiled and natural. This was thereason that Dōgen was not inhibited from making such fantastic statements as“mountains ride on the clouds and walk in the heavens.”78 [notes.html#ch5_78]The mountains and waters became absolutely ordinary only in their thusness.Such was the case of Dōgen’s view of the moon. “A step of the moon isTathāgata’s perfect enlightenment; Tathāgata’s perfect enlightenment is themoon’s movement.”79 [notes.html#ch5_79] When Dōgen observed the moon, all thingsof the universe became the moon (sho-getsu).80 [notes.html#ch5_80] In speakingof moonlight, Dōgen asserted that when the universe is lit by moonlight, thedualism of the universe and moonlight is overcome and duality becomes undefiled.“Both light (kō) and environment (kyō) go away (kō-kyō tomoni bōzu).”81[notes.html#ch5_81] As I have touched on previously in a different context,metaphor in Dōgen’s sense was not that which pointed to something other thanitself, but that which pointed to itself so as to overcome and realize itself.This was quite evident in his analysis of the moon reflected on the water:Śākyamuni Buddha said: “The true Dharma-body of Buddha is like the empty sky,and it manifests itself according to sentient beings like the moon [reflected]on the water.” The “like” in “like the moon [reflected] on the water” shouldmean the water-moon (sui-getsu) [i.e., the nonduality of the moon and thewater]. It should be the water-thusness (sui-nyo), the moon-thusness(getsu-nyo), thusness-on (nyo-chū), and onthusness (chū-nyo). We are notconstruing “like” as resemblance—“like” (nyo) is “thusness” (ze).82[notes.html#ch5_82]Dōgen was well aware of the difference between likeness and thusness and warnedagainst the confounding of the two. Yet ultimately, likeness was thusness as theformer was radically naturalized in its total exertion. Thus, Dōgen said: “Themoon’s movement is certainly not a metaphor; therefore, it is the essence andform of solitary perfection.”83 [notes.html#ch5_83]Tung-shan Liang-chieh (807–869) was asked by a monastic one day: “When cold orheat comes, how can I escape it?” “Why don’t you go to a place where there is nocold or heat?” said the teacher. “What is it like in a place where there isneither cold nor heat?” asked the monastic. The teacher’s answer was: “When itis cold, it makes you exceedingly cold; when it is hot, exceedingly hot.”84[notes.html#ch5_84] Dōgen used this kōan as a text for the exposition of hisview on the four seasons, commenting as follows: “This cold or heat means totalcold or total heat, being cold or heat just as it is (kansho zukara).”85[notes.html#ch5_85] “Cold or heat just as it is” was precisely the place wherethere existed no cold or heat. While living in cold, the enlightened personlived in cold in total freedom; while living in heat, one lived in the sameway.86 [notes.html#ch5_86] It was not an escape but a choice—the choice ofduality, though not dualism, undefiled and free. Therefore, this statementfollowed: “Where there is the body-mind cast-off, there is an escape from coldand heat.… You know the signs of this cold and heat, live in the seasons of coldand heat, and make use of cold and heat.”87 [notes.html#ch5_87]One day in the eleventh month of 1243, three feet of snow fell on the compoundof the Kippōji temple where Dōgen was staying. Recollecting Ju-ching’s sermonson the old plum blossoms, Dōgen wrote: “When an old plum tree bloomsunexpectedly, just then the world unfolds itself with the flowering.”88[notes.html#ch5_88] Dōgen saw the whole world in terms of the old plum blossomsblooming in their total exertion. That is, the blossom shared its merits withits five petals within itself, and with countless other blossoms without itself,yet it did not boast of its own efficacy. Both within and without constitutedthe unfolding of one and the same plum blossom, which was in turn the locus ofthe realized now (nikon no tōsho); thus, it regenerated and restored all thingsof the universe. This renewal, however, was that which cast off even the “new”as opposed to the “old” in ordinary dualism.89 [notes.html#ch5_89]The thusness of the blossoms blooming (kakai) and of the world unfolding(sekaiki) was compared to Buddha’s holding up an udumbara (udonge) flower beforethe multitude of congregations on Mt. Gṛdhrakūṭa. The udumbara flower was saidto bloom once in three thousand years; hence, it was the symbol of extremerarity.90 [notes.html#ch5_90] Thus, all things were udumbaras at the moment ofthusness. Moreover, they were the “flowers of emptiness” (kūge), originallyinterpreted as the “flowers blooming in the sky”—the illusory flowers orperceptions attributed to the epistemological errors of humans owing to theirdiseased eyesight.91 [notes.html#ch5_91] Dōgen argued that what others viewed asillusory were, in reality, the flowers of emptiness, and that the ignorance ofthe perceivers was based on their ignorance of emptiness. For this reason, theflowers of nothingness might be a contradiction in terms, but “the flowers ofemptiness” was not. “The flowers of emptiness open and disclose both the earthand the sky.”92 [notes.html#ch5_92] Things, events, and beings, sentient andinsentient, were each an udumbara—an incomparably rare occasion to meet, grow,and create.You must surely know that emptiness is a single grass; yet, this emptiness neverfails to bloom, like other hundreds of grasses that bloom. To grasp this truth,the Tathāgata-way speaks of emptiness as “originally having no flower.” Althoughoriginally having no flower, it now has flowers—peaches and damsons are all likethis, and plums and willows are all like this. It is like saying that a plumtree that has no flowers as yet will bloom when spring comes. When the timecomes, it unfailingly blooms. It is the time of flowers and flowers havearrived. At the very moment of the flowers’ arrival, nothing contrary to thefact happens. The blossoms of plum trees or willow trees flower always on theplum trees or the willow trees. Seeing the blossoms, we tell the plum from thewillow; when we see the plum and the willow, we distinguish between them bytheir flowers. No blossoms of peaches or damsons ever bloom on plum trees orwillow trees. The flowers of plum trees or willow trees bloom on the plum treesor the willow trees; those of peach trees and damson trees bloom on the peachtrees and the damson trees. Indeed, the way the flowers of emptiness bloom isalso like this. They bloom on no other plants, flower on no other trees.93[notes.html#ch5_93]Such flowers of emptiness were beyond birth and death, beyond past, present, andfuture, beyond beginning, middle, and end.94 [notes.html#ch5_94] Nonetheless,the following was also true: “Seeing a dazzling variety of the flowers ofemptiness, we understand an infinity of the fruits of emptiness (kūka). Weshould observe the bloom and fall of the flowers of emptiness and learn thespring and autumn of the flowers of emptiness.”95 [notes.html#ch5_95] All inall, “nirvāṇa and birth-and-death are none other than the flowers ofemptiness.”96 [notes.html#ch5_96]It is clear from the foregoing observations that Dōgen did not approach naturefrom the standpoint of human beings, science, or nature mysticism. His approachwas neither the humanization of nature, the mechanistic, scientific manipulationof nature, nor the romantic, paradisiac absorption into nature. Whether he spokeof humans or nature, Dōgen inevitably (and quite consistently) returned to thenondualistic soteriology of Buddha-nature, radically conceived with the logic ofrealization rather than the logic of transcendence. Humans and nature, in myriadconfigurations and forms, while existing and perishing, shared their destiniesas the flowers of emptiness. They were characterized in Dōgen’s favoriteexpression as “the whole body of emptiness leaping out of itself ”(konshin-chōshutsu) and left no traces behind, like birds flying in the sky.Such was Dōgen’s “radical love” of nature.97 [notes.html#ch5_97]THE BODHISATTVA IDEAL [toc.html#ch5_h2_4]The essence of bodhisattvahood resides in the bodhisattvas’ aspirations forself-perfection in enlightenment (jōgu-bodai), as well as in their descent toand remaining among sentient beings to liberate them for their well-being(geke-shujō). The bodhisattva’s four great vows (shi-guzeigan) resound again andagain throughout the writings of Mahāyāna Buddhism, summarizing the bodhisattvaideal:However innumerable sentient beings are,I vow to save them;However inexhaustible the passions are,I vow to extinguish them;However limitless Dharma-teachings are,I vow to master them;However supreme the Buddha-way is,I vow to perfect it.98 [notes.html#ch5_98]These vows are recited, reflected upon, and meditated on, by monastics, day andnight, to such an extent that the lives of monastics are, in essence, theembodiment of vows. The noblest expression of the selfless bodhisattva’s wisdomand compassion is found in the phrase, “nirvāṇa with no fixed abode”(mujūsho-nehan). Accordingly, the bodhisattva abides neither in the realm ofbirth-and-death (out of wisdom) nor in the realm of nirvāṇa (out of compassion).The life of the bodhisattva personifies the nonduality of wisdom and compassion.The bodhisattva has been variously interpreted in the Buddhist tradition. ForDōgen’s part, there was evidence that he distinguished, for example, between theSeven Past Buddhas, the twenty-eight Indian ancestors, and the six Chineseancestors (from Bodhidharma to Hui-nêng), and regarded the latter categories asbodhisattvas rather than Buddhas.99 [notes.html#ch5_99] Doctrinally speaking,bodhisattva differed from Buddha, as we see in the scheme of the fifty-twostages of bodhisattvahood (gojūnii), in which the stage of approachingBuddhahood (tōgaku) and the stage of Buddhahood itself (myōgaku) were clearlydifferentiated.100 [notes.html#ch5_100] Dōgen seems to have followed,occasionally and advisedly, some such conception of the Buddhas andbodhisattvas, in a manner similar to his approach to the doctrine of the Age ofDegenerate Law. However, this was not his real view. This was made clear by thefact that, throughout his writings, Dōgen was most emphatic in denying thetraditional distinction between the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. He contended:All bodhisattvas are all Buddhas. Buddhas and bodhisattvas are not differenttypes of beings. Old and young, superior and inferior do not obtain. Even thoughthis bodhisattva and that bodhisattva are not two beings, nor are theydistinguished by the self and other, or by the past, present, and future, tobecome a Buddha (sabutsu) is the supreme model for the practice of thebodhisattva-way. At the time of the initial desire for enlightenment, onebecomes a Buddha (jōbutsu), and at the final stage of Buddhahood one [still]becomes a Buddha. There are some bodhisattvas who became Buddhas countlessbillions and billions of times. The assertion that after becoming a Buddha, oneshould discontinue spiritual discipline and engage in no further endeavor, isdue to an ordinary person’s view that does not yet understand the way of Buddhasand ancestors.101 [notes.html#ch5_101]Furthermore, Dōgen had this to say: “All bodhisattvas are the original forebearsof all Buddhas; all Buddhas are the original mentors of all bodhisattvas.”102[notes.html#ch5_102] The view of the bodhisattva as a provisional stage toBuddhahood was flatly rejected, as Dōgen contended, since expediency orprovisionality in this traditional scheme had to be seen in the light ofthusness; that is, the expedient, the provisional, and the like were not meansto the end of enlightenment, but rather the “supreme merit of enlightenment”(bukka no mujōkudoku), as the following statement indicates:The gate of skillful means (hōben-mon) is the supreme merit of enlightenment.Dharma abides in its Dharma-position; and the [momentary and shifting] aspect oflife is permanent and lasting. The gate of skillful means is not concerned witha temporary skill; it is a study that involves the whole world—that study whichmakes use of all things themselves as ultimate reality (shohō-jissō). Even ifsuch a gate of skillful means comes to be known and embraces the whole world bybeing one with it (jin-jippōkai no gaijippōkai-su), no one except bodhisattvascan use it freely.103 [notes.html#ch5_103]It seems perfectly legitimate for Dōgen to maintain this position once we recallhis fundamental view of Buddha-nature: that being Buddha and becoming Buddhawere contemporaneous and nondual.The bodhisattva can be considered in two different contexts: one is the personof the bodhisattva as the object of faith and devotion; the other, the way ofthe bodhisattva as the model for the Mahāyāna believer’s life.104[notes.html#ch5_104] Dōgen gave his most explicit view on this matter in hisexposition on the myth of Avalokiteśvara (Kannon), one of the most popularbodhisattvas in East Asia. He defined Kannon, the bodhisattva of greatcompassion (daihibosatsu), as the bodhisattva who responded to sentient beings’recitation of his name (kanzeon-bosatsu), as well as the bodhisattva whoobserved and liberated sentient beings (kanjizai-bosatsu).105[notes.html#ch5_105] In this regard, Dōgen took up a Zen kōan, attributed toYün-yen T’an-shêng (780–841) and Tao-wu Yüanchih (769–835). Yün-yen one dayasked Tao-wu: “What does Avalokiteśvara use his numerous arms and eyes for?”Tao-wu answered: “It is like a person who gropes at night for a pillow byreaching behind him/her.” “I understand! I understand!” exclaimed Yün-yen. “Howdo you understand it?” asked Tao-wu. “Arms and eyes are all over the body,” wasthe answer. Tao-wu said: “Well said. You hit the mark well.” Yün-yen then asked,“That is my answer, but how about you, Brother?” “The whole body is nothing butarms and eyes,” was Tao-wu’s answer.106 [notes.html#ch5_106] Dōgen analyzed thiskōan and reasoned as follows:As we attempt to examine Tao-wu’s remark “groping at night for a pillow byreaching behind him/her,” we should properly understand that the eyes inquestion see things freely at night. The arms grope for a pillow, but no boundsare yet touched. If the arms reaching behind are wondrously working, thereshould also be the wondrous working of the eyes reaching behind. You mustclearly understand the night eyes.… Having said this, we ask: What does thebodhisattva of arms and eyes (shugen-bosatsu) use myriad bodhisattvas of greatcompassion (daihibosatsu) for? You should realize that although the arms andeyes do not impede one another, “for what use?” (yō-somo) means “thusness thatuses” (immo-yō) and “to use thusness” (yō-immo).107 [notes.html#ch5_107]Avalokiteśvara’s arms and eyes (traditionally a thousand arms and a thousandeyes) were not something attached to his body, in which case, they would havebeen two separate entities. Nor were the “body” and “arms and eyes” just twodifferent designations for something underlying them, say, great compassion.Dōgen reasoned:When Yün-yen says, “The arms and eyes are all over the body,” he does not meanthat the arms and eyes cover the whole body. “All over” (hen) may be understoodas entirety, as in the “entire world” (henkai), yet, at the time when the bodyis comprised of nothing but the arms and eyes, “all over” is not an objectifiedomnipresence.… For this reason, Yünyen’s saying should be: “The entire bodyitself is the arms and eyes” (henshin-ze-shugen); it is not that the arms andeyes become the entire body. You must study this.108 [notes.html#ch5_108]By the same token, Tao-wu’s statement was understood nondualistically as “thewhole body is nothing but arms and eyes” (tsūshin-ze-shugen). Yün-yen’s “allover the body” and Tao-wu’s “the whole body” pointed to the same truth—themystery of Avalokiteśvara’s compassion (and that of all bodhisattvas and humansfor that matter) in its dynamic operation throughout the universe, in whichinfinite compassion, myriad arms and eyes, and body-mind were one indivisiblethusness. Avalokiteśvara in this view was not an object of faith that theordinary individual believed in, but the way of bodhisattvahood that everyonecould exemplify. In brief, Avalokiteśvara was not the object, but the subject,of faith. The object of faith and the model of living in question were not twodiscrete concerns, but one and the same in the nonduality of infinite compassionand in the thousand arms and thousand eyes of Avalokiteśvara.109[notes.html#ch5_109]In view of the foregoing observations and others made before, it is clear thatBuddhas, bodhisattvas, and ancestors were one and the same and, in turn, werecharacterized in the context of Dōgen’s “active Buddha” (gyōbutsu).The “longevity” of the way of the bodhisattva was limitless and beyond time.110[notes.html#ch5_110] Dōgen wrote:The religious asceticism of infinite kalpas is the efforts and movements of theBuddha-womb and the Buddha-abdomen, and of Buddha’s skin-flesh-bones-marrow. Wehave already been told: “It never, never ends.” Reaching Buddha, it is ever moreassiduous; even after it has been transformed into myriad worlds, it advancesfurther.111 [notes.html#ch5_111]Such a spiritual evolution was not construed in a futuristic framework, with theimage of the bodhisattva steadily progressing toward the other shore (pāramitā;higan). Dōgen ingeniously reinterpreted this metaphor of “reaching the othershore” (tō-higan), and turned it around by saying “the other shore has arrived”(higan-tō).112 [notes.html#ch5_112] He wrote:Haramitsu [pāramitā] means “the other shore has arrived.” Although “the othershore” [nirvāṇa] is not something that is conventionally associated with formsand traces, “arrival” is realized. Arrival is a kōan. Do not ever think thatyour practice will let you reach the other shore. Because there is practice inthe other shore [i.e., in enlightenment], the other shore “has arrived” if youpractice the Way. For this practice is unfailingly possessed of the ability torealize the entire universe.113 [notes.html#ch5_113]In short, “the other shore” was realized here and now, in and through thepractice of bodhisattvahood; it was not a matter of the future, but a matter ofthe present.The essence of the bodhisattva ideal was great compassion (mahākaruṇā; daihi).It was essentially the reconciliation of the dualistic opposites of self andnonself, sentient and insentient, Buddhas and sentient beings, man and woman,and so forth. As Dōgen stated, “The way of the bodhisattva is ‘I am thusness;you are thusness.’ ”114 [notes.html#ch5_114] The identity of “I” and “you” inthusness, rather than identity in substance, status, or the like, was thefundamental metaphysical and religious ground of great compassion.115[notes.html#ch5_115] This was why Dōgen said that when we study ourselvesthoroughly, we understand others thoroughly as well; as a result, we cast offthe self and the other.116 [notes.html#ch5_116]The self-other nonduality was most eloquently expressed in Dōgen’s exposition onthe four virtues of the bodhisattva (bodaisatta-shishōhō), which were (1) giving(fuse), (2) loving speech (aigo), (3) service for the welfare of all beings(rigyō), and (4) identity with others (dōji).117 [notes.html#ch5_117] Giving,material and spiritual, was expounded by Dōgen as follows:What we call giving means nongreed. Nongreed is not to crave. Not to cravespeaks of what people ordinarily regard as the opposite of flattery. Even if yougovern the four continents [the whole world], you should be in no way greedy sothat you may edify the people in accordance with the right Way. For example, itis likened to people who give strangers the treasures they abandon. [They areneither attached to the treasures nor expectant of receiving any return from thestrangers.] Let us offer the flowers of distant mountains to Tathāgata or sharethe treasures of past lives with sentient beings.In spiritual teachings as well as in material things, each and every giving isinnately provided with the merit that corresponds to it. It is true that if athing is not one’s own possession, it does not hinder one’s act of giving. Itdoes not matter whether a thing is cheap or small; its merit must be authentic.When the Way is surrendered to the Way, you attain the Way. Upon beingenlightened, you necessarily let the Way come through itself. When riches arewhat they truly are, they invariably become giving. The self gives the self forthe sake of giving the self; the other gives the other for the sake of givingthe other. [Giving is purposeless and noninstrumental.] The karmic force of suchgiving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world, and reachesout as far as the wise ones and sages who attained the fruits of enlightenment.The reason is that in the act of giving, one who gives and one who receives forma connection with each other.… you must give even a phrase or a gāthā ofBuddhist teachings; it will become the seeds of goodness in this life and incoming lives. Offer even a penny or even an unimportant bit of wealth, and itwill germinate the roots of goodness in the present life, as well as in thenext. Spiritual teachings are material wealth; likewise, material wealth isspiritual teachings. [Which you choose] should be considered according to one’sdesires and preferences.…To row a boat, or to construct a bridge over a river is equally thebodhisattva’s practice of giving. If you study giving carefully, [you realizethat] living as well as dying are both giving. To be sure, to make a living andregulate a business is none other than giving. Flowers trust to the wind, andbirds trust to the seasons—these too are the feats of giving.…Indeed, by reason of being originally gifted with the power of giving, one’spresent self came into being.118 [notes.html#ch5_118]Dōgen advocated the act of giving, free and undefiled of dualism, between thegiver and receiver, between Dharma and wealth, between mind and matter. In thisview, our birth-and-death itself was a supreme example of the nonduality ofgiving and receiving for the sake of the self ’s, as well as the other’s,liberation.Loving speech was explained as follows:Loving speech means that as you meet sentient beings, you first arouse the senseof compassion in your mind and treat them with considerate, affectionate words.It is altogether devoid of any violent and spiteful language.… When you talk,keep your mind on the thought that Buddha cares for sentient beings tenderly asif he was handling babies. This is loving speech. Praise the virtuous, and havecompassion for the wicked. As you take delight in affectionate words, they willgradually flourish; then even those loving words which were hitherto unknown andunperceived will show themselves. As long as your present life lasts, you shouldtake pleasure in speaking compassionately. Generation after generation, let usexert ourselves unremittingly. Compassionate speech is fundamental to thepacification of enemies and the reconciliation of rulers.…You should ponder that thoughtful words arise from the mind of loving kindness.The mind of loving kindness has compassion as its seed. Consider this: lovingspeech [of remonstrance] has the power to influence even the imperial mind. Itis not just to speak highly of others’ strengths and achievements.119[notes.html#ch5_119]In this connection, as I have alluded to before, philosophic endeavors in wordsand letters were no longer to be feared, but were rather to be cultivated aspart of loving speech. What we need, Dōgen would have said, is a compassionatephilosophy or a philosophic compassion in which wisdom and compassion arenondually practiced.Dōgen also spoke of service for the welfare of all beings:Working for the welfare of all beings means that you contrive ways to benefitall sentient beings, high and low. In other words, you carefully investigateothers’ distant and near futures, and think of the various means which will bethe most congenial to their well-being. Commiserate with a turtle in trouble,and take care of a sparrow suffering from injury. When you see the distressedturtle or watch the sick sparrow, you do not expect any repayment for yourfavor, but are moved entirely by your desire to help others.Fools may think that if another’s benefit is given priority, their own good mustbe lost. This is not the case. The practice of benefiting others is a totaltruth (ippō), hence, it serves both self and others far and wide.…Therefore, serve enemies and friends equally, and assist self and others withoutdiscrimination. If you grasp this truth, [you will see that] this is the reasonthat even grasses and trees, wind and water are all naturally engaged in theactivity of benefiting others, and your understanding will certainly serveothers’ benefit. You should endeavor single-mindedly to save foolish minds.120[notes.html#ch5_120]And lastly, regarding identity with others, Dōgen had this to say:Identity with others is nondifference. This applies equally to the self and toothers. For example, Tathāgata was born into the human world and lived a humanlife. In view of his identity with human beings, we know that this principle ofidentity holds true of the other nonhuman worlds. As we understand identity withothers, self and others are one indivisible thusness.[Po-Chü-i’s] lute, poetry, and wine make friends of human beings, heavenlybeings, and gods. We humans make friends of the lute, poetry, and wine. Thelute, poetry, and wine turn themselves into friends, humans turn themselves intofriends, heavenly beings turn themselves into friends, and gods turn themselvesinto friends. In such a truth lies the learning of identity with others.In other words, ji [in dōji, “identity with others”] refers to manner, dignity,and posture. There is a truth that after self assimilates others to itself, selflets itself be assimilated by others. The relationship of self and others isinfinitely [varied] according to circumstances.You should realize this [as stated in the Kuan-tzŭ]: The sea does not refusewater because of its identity with water. You should further understand thatwater is also fully prepared with the virtue of not refusing the sea. On thisaccount, water gathers itself, flowing into the sea, and earth piles up, forminga mountain.121 [notes.html#ch5_121]Underlying these cardinal virtues was the principle of the nonduality of selfand others in the context of which, alone, the selfless activities of thebodhisattva became undefiled, free, and natural.122 [notes.html#ch5_122] Thehallmark of great compassion lay in this. Yet, as we examine Dōgen’s thoughtmore closely, we note distinctive characteristics of his view of compassion. Heobserved: “To have the desire for enlightenment means that before one crosses tothe other shore of nirvāṇa, one makes a vow to carry all sentient beings there,and endeavors accordingly. Even if one’s personal appearance is lowly, uponbeing awakened to this mind, one is already a guide of all sentient beings.”123[notes.html#ch5_123] This meant, in the final analysis, that individualliberation was a contradiction in terms; liberation was fulfilled only in thecontext of social liberation. Dōgen’s monastic ideal can be adequatelyinterpreted only in light of such a social interpretation of liberation.In apparent contradiction, Dōgen’s view of compassion was unique because of hisemphasis on Dharma for the sake of Dharma, rather than on applying Dharma to theneeds of the common people; thus he underscored an exclusive elitism. Such anexclusionary attitude is usually construed as contradictory to the spirit ofuniversal compassion as advocated in the bodhisattva ideal. This conclusion,however, is premature. It is true that Dōgen chose monasticism instead of citylife and congregated with a select few instead of the common folk; this elitismwas undeniably clear in the latter half of his life. It is also true that Dōgenonce wrote to the effect that the Buddhas and ancestors were not without thebonds of worldly affections and obligations, yet abandoned them resolutely.124[notes.html#ch5_124] There was not the slightest concern with makingaccommodations to the mediocre or inferior capacities of the masses in thecities and villages. And yet, as I have pointed out previously, such an elitismrepresented not so much the absence of compassion as a mode of great compassion.Dōgen’s relentless rigorism and disciplinarianism, though not without a tinge ofauthoritarianism, were motivated by the search for Dharma for the sake ofDharma, which in turn was the core of his view of compassion because it held upas an example to the common people.THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL [toc.html#ch5_h2_5]Monastic asceticism was based on moral precepts (śīla; kai) and monastic rules(vinaya; ritsu) that were carefully formulated by Dōgen in many of his writings.They were designed not for legalistic conformity or authoritarian regimentation,but for the practice of the Way (bendō) with the realization of and faith inBuddha-nature. As Dōgen put it, they represented the reenactment of the “ancientBuddhas’ daily activity” (kobutsu no anri) or the “ancient teachers’ dailyactivity” (kosen no anri). Thus, the Buddhist monastic order (saṃgha; sōgya) wasthe religious and educational community of seekers, in which the teacher and thedisciples challenged one another in a shared search for the Way. Dōgen’s warningwas this: “Those who have believing minds and give up desire for worldly fameand gain shall enter. Those who lack sincerity shall not join; enteringmistakenly, they shall depart after due deliberation.”125 [notes.html#ch5_125]It was an exclusive community of religious elite with unflinching determinationto become members of a “family” in the tradition of the Buddhas and ancestors(busso no kafū). In his passionate pursuit of the utopian vision of monasticidealism, Dōgen placed increasing emphasis on the minute specifications ofmonastic life, rather than on the general principles that characterized hisearlier writings of the Kōshōji period (1233–1243).126 [notes.html#ch5_126]It is imperative for us to understand the nature of moral precepts and theirrelation to monastic rules prior to our examination of Dōgen’s view of morality.The word kairitsu, which is frequently used in Chinese and Japanese Buddhistwritings, is compounded by the two characters kai and ritsu. The originalSanskrit word for kai is usually rendered śīla, whereas that for ritsu, vinaya.Kai refers to moral precepts that should be followed by all Buddhists, and ritsuto the rules that maintain the order of the monastic community. While the latterare accompanied by some provisions of punishment for violators, the former (kai)are not. That is to say, moral precepts are guidelines that are dependent upon amonastic’s motive, disposition, and conscience as a Buddhist believer. On theother hand, monastic rules have to do primarily with external regulationsregarding a monastic’s behavior and conduct. Telling a lie, for example, can beconsidered from the two standpoints of legality and morality: according to thelegal standpoint, telling a lie may be an evil act regardless of the situationin which the act is committed and the motive of the person who committed it; onthe other hand, from the moral standpoint, the same precept can be interpretedflexibly in the spirit of understanding and compassion. In short, the monasticrules, though indispensable to the monastic way of life, tend to inducelegalism, conformism, and heteronomy, in contradistinction to the spirit ofmoral precepts, which take heed of individual moral autonomy and freedom.127[notes.html#ch5_127]These two separate concepts are combined in the compound word kairitsu which,though frequently used in Chinese and Japanese sources but not in Indiansources, is rather obscure in its origin and precise meaning. Hirakawa observesthat the compound word, while retaining the meanings of its components,emphasizes that monastic rules must be subordinate and contributory to moralprecepts and that a tension between the two—between freedom and order—must becreatively maintained.128 [notes.html#ch5_128]Dōgen’s approach to this matter bore some similarities to Hirakawa’sinterpretation. Although relentlessly rigorous about every minute aspect of amonastic’s deeds and words, which had to be consistent with the rightlytransmitted Buddha-dharma as he interpreted it, Dōgen’s intention was anythingbut the inducement of legalism, conformity, or heteronomy. What he intended todo, as I have remarked briefly before, was implement the spirit of the preceptsin the rules of actual monastic life—in other words, to ritualize morality.Furthermore, Dōgen endeavored to subsume both precepts and rules under theumbrella of zazen-only (shikan-taza), which in turn liberated the two—cult andmorality.As I have pointed out frequently, Dōgen firmly believed in the indispensabilityof monasticism, though this did not necessarily contradict his equal concernwith the spiritual welfare of the laity. He often approvingly quoted, fromCh’ang-lu Tsung-che’s Ch’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei, the statement that enlightenmentis attained only in the monastic’s life, and monastic precepts and rules shouldbe given priority in the practice of the Way.129 [notes.html#ch5_129] He wrote:Wherever the Dharma of Buddhas and ancestors is transmitted, whether in India orin China, there is always the rite of receiving the precepts at the beginning ofinitiation into Dharma. Without receiving the precepts, you are not yet thedisciples of Buddhas nor the children of ancestors. To avoid mistakes and wardoff evils constitute the study and practice of the Way. Indeed, [Tsung-che’s]saying that the precepts be given priority (kairitsu-isen) is already thetreasury of the true Dharma eye (shōbō-genzō).130 [notes.html#ch5_130]The transmission of Dharma was inseparably connected with the precepts. Thelatter, however, were not so much commandments or codes as they were vows thatwere accepted by the monk or nun who was initiated into the Way.Although the bodhisattva precepts (bosatsu-kai) were variously adopted bydifferent Māyāyanists in place of the Hīnayāna precepts (biku-kai orgusokukai),131 [notes.html#ch5_131] Dōgen conceived them to be the sixteenprecepts or vows: (I) the three precepts of faith (san-kie-kai): (1) faith inBuddha (kie-butsu), (2) faith in Dharma (kie-hō), and (3) faith in Saṃgha(kie-sō); (II) the three precepts of purity (sanju-shōjō-kai): (1) to eradicateall evils (shōritsugi-kai), (2) to exert oneself for all things that are good(shōzembō-kai), and (3) to liberate all sentient beings (shōshujō-kai); (III)the ten major precepts (jū-jūkin-kai): (1) not to destroy life (fusesshō-kai),(2) not to steal (fuchūtō-kai), (3) not to commit sexual acts (fuin’yoku-kai),(4) not to lie (fumōgo-kai), (5) not to deal in intoxicating liquors(fukoshu-kai), (6) not to report the wrongdoings of anyone among the four groups(monks, nuns, male lay-believers, and female lay-believers)(fusetsu-zaike-shukke-bosatsu-zaika-kai), (7) not to praise oneself or slanderothers (fu-jisan-kita-kai), (8) not to covet (fukendon-kai), (9) not to bestirred to anger (fushin’i-kai), and (10) not to revile the three treasures(Buddha, Dharma, and Saṃgha) (fubō-sambō-kai).132 [notes.html#ch5_132]These precepts were given and received between the administrator of ordination(and initiation) and the monastic who was ordained (and initiated) in compliancewith prescribed manners before the congregation of monastics in a reverentialsetting. The receiving of the bodhisattva precepts signaled a radical partingwith the secular world—a rite of passage from the secular life to the monastic’slife as a chosen path, which meant “leaving home” (shukke) in order to live thelife of the homeless. Dōgen exalted the day of receiving the precepts as the dayof supreme enlightenment for all sentient and insentient beings, for thewell-being of the self and others.133 [notes.html#ch5_133] The initiation intomonasticism, however, was not the ordinary path of withdrawal from the world—thepath on which so many contemporaries of Dōgen trod—but the path of the pathless,so extraordinary indeed that it transcended one and many, identity anddifference, self and other.134 [notes.html#ch5_134] As Dōgen wrote, “Theinheritance of Dharma transcends past, present, and future; the vow ofenlightenment continues in unbroken succession for all ages.”135[notes.html#ch5_135]The precepts reflected Buddhist moral and spiritual aspirations and visions ofembodying the way of the bodhisattva, with the intent of liberating all sentientbeings through acts of wisdom and compassion. But these precepts were not alwaysobserved consistently and faithfully, due to Zen monastics’ ambiguity andvulnerability, of which they were acutely aware. Inasmuch as the Zen monasterywas called the “community of purity” (shōjōsō), defilement by sins and guiltshad to be cleansed and purified as well. It is well known that the gāthā ofrepentance was recited by Zen monastics at confession:All the evil karmas ever committed by me since of old,On account of greed, anger, and folly, which have no beginning,Born of my body, mouth, and thought—I now make full open confession of it.136 [notes.html#ch5_136]The matter of repentance, confession, and forgiveness (sange or keka) becamevery important in Dōgen’s thought.137 [notes.html#ch5_137] Dōgen stated:When both your mind and flesh are in idleness or disbelief, you should confessin utter sincerity to the Buddhas who are before you. When you repent in thismanner, those Buddhas who are before you will liberate and purify you throughthe meritorious power of your confession. This merit will richly nurture purefaith and spiritual endeavor, which are unobstructed. As your pure faith isrealized, you yourself and all others will be transformed; sentient andinsentient beings shall enjoy its benefits far and wide.138 [notes.html#ch5_138]Immediately after this assertion, Dōgen continued, regarding the efficacy ofconfession:The leading thought [of confession] is a sincere desire that, although I mayhave many obstacles to the Way due to evil karmic effects accumulated from thepast, the Buddhas and ancestors who were enlightened through the Buddha-way willhave compassion for me, will deliver me from karmic shackles, and will eliminateany hindrances to my learning of the Way, and that they will make theDharma-gate of their merits completely pervade and fill the boundless universeand apportion this compassion to me.…If you repent in this way, you will certainly have the invisible assistance ofthe Buddhas and ancestors. Confess your thoughts and deeds, disclose yourself inwords, relate them before Buddhas, and your sins shall be altogether rootedout.139 [notes.html#ch5_139]Coming from a Zen Buddhist context, these words on the efficacy of repentance,confession, and forgiveness might surprise some of us.140 [notes.html#ch5_140]Yet these were integral, not extraneous, to the right practice and the rightfaith.Zen Buddhists are acutely aware of the finitude and ambiguity of humanexistence, and their sorrow for their sins is as profound as that of otherBuddhists or religious persons. Yet, the metaphysical and religious context ofconfession in Dōgen’s case was radically different from that of others. Theseacts of repentance and confession were performed in the context of thenonduality of the “I” who confessed and the Buddhas who received the confession.The phrase “before (to) Buddhas” became “before (to) one’s self,” and hence,ultimately one confessed, repented, and was forgiven in the nondual purity ofself and Buddha. The purity of a contrite heart in its confession was identicalto the confession of Buddha-nature in its purity. The act of confession was thedisclosure of original purity. For this reason, the guilt intrinsic toBuddha-nature became “guiltless” and “pure” (isshiki no).141[notes.html#ch5_141]Thus far, we have been gradually preparing ourselves for an examination of theproblem of religion and morality in Dōgen’s thought. Before we plunge into thismatter, let us make the following preliminary observation: The problem ofenlightenment cannot be properly understood without considering the problem ofmorality and ethics. Morality and enlightenment were inseparably related to oneanother, so much so that one without the other was not authentic so far as Dōgenwas concerned. For nirvāṇa was not beyond good and evil as it is usually—indeed,too often—interpreted in the popular parlance, but was rather a mode ofexistence with a definite moral commitment that was realized in and through therealm of good and evil (and of cause and effect as well), and yet was undefiledby them. The secret to this undefiled freedom lay in the method of the totalexertion of a single thing (ippō-gūjin), which appropriated the traditionalBuddhist ideas of emptiness and nonduality, existentially, practically, andreligiously, rather than theoretically. Unadulterated spiritual freedom, theauthenticity of which was tested by the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity,paradoxically demanded an equally unadulterated moral commitment of those whointerpreted Zen as beyond good and evil. In brief, spiritual freedom and moralcommitment were inseparably intertwined in Zen, as far as Dōgen was concerned.One of the clues to Dōgen’s view of this problem was his treatment of thetraditional Buddhist idea of causation, or more exactly, moral causation (ingaor goppō).142 [notes.html#ch5_142] Dōgen gave his comments on one of hisfavorite kōans, which runs something like this: In the monastery where Po-changHuai-hai presided, there was an old man, who had been attending Po-chang’slecture sessions with other monastics. One day after the lecture, the old manstayed in the Dharma hall instead of retiring from the hall with others as heusually did. Noticing the man, Po-chang asked: “Who is this man who is standingin front of me?” The old man said, recounting his past: “I am not a man, thoughI appear to be. I had been the head of this monastery on Mt. Pochang ever sincethe time of Kāśyapa Buddha, one of the Seven Past Buddhas. However, one day whensomeone asked me whether or not persons of great spiritual discipline fall intocausation, I answered by saying that they do not fall into causation(furaku-inga). As a result of the sin of saying this, I have been a foxthroughout five hundred rebirths. Please deliver me from this misery with yourmighty words.” Po-chang answered: “The persons of great spiritual discipline donot obscure causation (fumai-inga).” The old man was instantly enlightened andfreed from the state of a fox.143 [notes.html#ch5_143] Dōgen analyzed the terms“not falling into causation” and “not obscuring causation” as such: the formerwas a denial of moral causation, whereas the latter was an affirmation of it.Dōgen’s own view on this matter was traditional to a certain extent, but wentbeyond the conventional.One of the hallmarks of Buddhism from its inception has been its advocacy of thelaw of causation in the moral sphere. In its simplest formulation, the law holdsthat “evil deeds cause evil consequences” (akuin-akka), and “good deeds causegood consequences” (zen’in-zenka). The inexorable law of cause and effectgoverns the succession of rebirths through our deeds, speech, and thought. Boththe fate and hope of humanity lie in the domain of our own responsibility; inthis sense, the law is deeply personal despite its impersonal appearance as aniron rule. Accordingly, we cannot escape the consequence of our actions, words,and thoughts, be they good or evil. A most devoted Buddhist, Dōgen showed hisappreciation for the profundity and mystery of causation when he wrote:Foremost in the study of the Buddha-dharma is to comprehend the law ofcausation. An act, such as the denial of causation, is tantamount to trying toarouse a wild, erroneous view in order to eradicate the root of goodness.Indeed, the truth of causation is manifestly impartial: the evil person lapses,the good one evolves. There is absolutely no exception.144 [notes.html#ch5_144]Dōgen profoundly deplored the state of affairs in Buddhism that ignored thefundamentality of causation, which resulted in moral laxity, complacency, andantinomianism.145 [notes.html#ch5_145]From such a perspective, Dōgen subscribed to the traditional interpretation of“not falling into causation” as the view rejecting the law of causation, and“not obscuring causation” as the one advocating a deep faith in it. Thus, herepudiated the attempt to identify and confound “not falling into” and “notobscuring” with one another.146 [notes.html#ch5_146] There was no doubt aboutDōgen’s faith in the law of causation as inexorable, relentless, andimpartial—as well as his faith in our inescapable responsibility for what wefeel, think, and do. Dōgen used the phrase “causation of common world” (kugai noinga) to refer to the impartiality and justice that prevailed in theuniverse.147 [notes.html#ch5_147] Elsewhere he wrote: “The law of causation isneither an original being, nor something that emerges at a particular time; itis not the case that causation, as something unavailing, waits for us.”148[notes.html#ch5_148] If such is the case, how can we conceive of our moral andspiritual freedom in such a “deterministic” framework?In the Shōbōgenzō, “Daishugyō,” Dōgen offered a different interpretation of theaforementioned problem. In this chapter, he attempted to expound the “greatspiritual discipline” (daishugyō) as that discipline which transcended the lawof causation. He underscored:“Not falling into causation” is traditionally construed as entailing a rejectionof causation and consequently, as lapsing into [a fox]. This view is groundless,and is what the ignorant person says.… Also, some, speaking of “not obscuringthe law of causation” in its conventional sense, hold that great spiritualdiscipline transcends cause and effect, and hence, liberates [the old man of Mt.Po-chang] from the body of a fox. But this also misses the mark.149[notes.html#ch5_149]Thus, Dōgen contended:Great spiritual discipline, as we probe its meaning, is none other than thegreat law of cause and effect. Because this causation consists unfailingly ofthe realized cause and the realized effect, there can never be any argumentabout “falling into” or “not falling into,” or about the way of “obscuring” or“not obscuring.”150 [notes.html#ch5_150]This position might appear contradictory to the previous one, which was based onthe conventional and commonsensical interpretation. However, Dōgen at this pointinterpreted the law of causation from an entirely different perspective in whichthe realized cause and the realized effect were spoken of. That is, cause andeffect were arranged not temporally or linearly in terms of before and after,but as ultimate discrete events or moments, each of which abided in its ownDharma-position and total exertion. Causation was viewed not merely as a moralcategory, but as a soteriological one.151 [notes.html#ch5_151] This wasexplicitly expressed in the following:Cause is not before and effect is not after; the cause is perfect and the effectis perfect. Cause is nondual, Dharma is nondual; effect is nondual, Dharma isnondual. Though effect is occasioned by cause, they are not before or after,because the before and the after are nondual in the Way.152 [notes.html#ch5_152]Thus, Dōgen called them the “wondrous cause” (myōin) and the “wondrous effect”(myōka), or the “Buddha cause” (butsuin) and the “Buddha effect” (bukka).153[notes.html#ch5_153]This view can be further elucidated by considering Dōgen’s analysis andinterpretation of the three stages of time for karmic retribution (sanjigō).Traditionally interpreted, the karmic effects of our actions, speech, andthought will be received (1) in the present life (jungenhōjugō), (2) in the nextlife (junjishōjugō), and (3) during rebirths after the next life(jungojijugō).154 [notes.html#ch5_154] This doctrine is an extension of moralcausation in a larger scheme, that is, in the framework of the Buddhist doctrineof rebirth (saṃsāra; rinne). Deeds are bound to have their results, according tothe law of causation, though differing in the time of their maturity in thespiritual journey through the three worlds and the six realms of existence. Thescheme of things in which we are destined to reap what we have sown was, toDōgen, part of his conception of reason and reasonableness (dōri). He said thatthose who committed the five cardinal sins (killing a father, killing a mother,killing an arahat, injuring the body of Śākyamuni Buddha, and destroying theBuddhist order) would be sent to the avīci hell (muken-jigoku or abi-jigoku)immediately after their death, where they would endure incessant suffering andtorture.155 [notes.html#ch5_155] On the other hand, bodhisattvas who practicedthe six perfections for three asaṃkhyeya-kalpas and one hundred kalpas(sangi-hyakkō), in order to attain the thirty-two distinguishing marks and theeighty minor characteristics of Buddha, would receive their fruits during theinnumerable rebirths after the next life.156 [notes.html#ch5_156] As is evidentfrom these observations, Dōgen seems to have believed in the fact, or myth, ofrebirth as traditionally understood in Buddhism.Dōgen, however, was not interested in any theoretical involvement with theproblem of rebirth, but simply accepted the doctrine and used it practically asa mythopoeic framework for our moral freedom and responsibility in determiningour own destiny. He stated: “It is a pity that even if you remember a thousandor ten thousand lives [of your own past], it is not necessarily theBuddha-dharma. The non-Buddhists already know [the rebirths of] eighty thousandkalpas; still it is not yet thought to be the Buddha-dharma.”157[notes.html#ch5_157] Good deeds for the sake of acquiring good results or forthe sake of avoiding bad results, in the conventional understanding of cause andeffect as a means and an end (and certainly heavens and hells loomed largely inordinary minds in this connection), became utterly irrelevant in Dōgen’sthought. Cause and effect were radically discontinuous moments that were at oncecause and effect, in the sense that in each were realized all the causes and allthe effects of the three periods of the past, present, and future. Cause was thecause of thusness, effect the effect of thusness. In a very special sense, nosooner did one choose and act according to a particular course of action thanthe results thereof (heavens, hells, or otherwise) were realized in it. Onlywhen we realized this could we be thoroughly transparent to the “falling into”and the “not falling into” regarding the law of causation.158[notes.html#ch5_158]The moment of action, as a cause and/or effect, was the moment lived inthusness. This was the meaning of what has been quoted already: “Cause is notbefore and effect is not after.” Dōgen wrote further, “That effect which existsfor its own sake (kaka no ka) is not the effect of causation (inga no ka);accordingly, the effect of causal law is the same as the effect for effect’ssake.”159 [notes.html#ch5_159] We live in the midst of causation from which wecannot escape even for a moment; nevertheless, we can live from moment to momentin such a way that these moments are the fulfilled moments of moral andspiritual freedom and purity in thusness. This was exactly what Dōgen meant byusing (shitoku suru) birth-and-death, and the law of causation for that matter,yet not being hindered or defiled by them.160 [notes.html#ch5_160] Thus,returning to Pochang’s kōan, the “not falling into” and the “not obscuring” werepenetrated, and nonduality was realized. Here, causal necessity and spiritualfreedom were reconciled in a uniquely paradoxical way, in Dōgen’s mysticalrealism.At long last we are prepared to proceed to the investigation of Dōgen’s view ofgood and evil, which was inseparably related to the problem of moral causation.As we might well expect of him, in light of various observations I have made inthe foregoing, Dōgen was vehemently opposed to a popular interpretation ofBuddhist ethics as “beyond good and evil.” Ejō quoted Dōgen as saying:What is good and what is bad are difficult to determine. They say that it isgood to wear silk garments and embroidered brocades, and bad to wear thoseclothes made of discarded and tattered rags. However, the Buddha-dharma regardsthe tattered ones as good and pure, and gold, silver, silk and brocade as badand soiled. In the same manner, this holds true of all other things withoutexception.Someone like me writes a few rhymed verses and composes prose one way oranother; some secular people speak of this as quite proper, while otherscriticize me for knowing such things as these despite being a monastic whostudies the Way. How can we determine what is to be accepted as good and what isto be rejected as bad?It is said in a sūtra: “Things that are praised by people and reckoned amongthings pure are called good; things that are disparaged by people and includedamong things impure are called evil.”Also it is written: “To undergo suffering as karmic consequence is evil, whereasto invite joy is good.” In this way you should judge carefully, and therebypractice what you deem to be truly good and discard what you find to be reallybad.Because monastics come from the midst of purity, they consider as good and purethose things which do not arouse thirst and craving on the part of humans.161[notes.html#ch5_161]Matters of good and evil are indeed difficult to determine, as Dōgenacknowledged here. Moral norms and values are relative to the biological makeupof the species, personal preferences, social customs, cultural patterns, and soon. Dōgen was aware of this situation when he observed:More about various evils: The evils of this world and those of other worlds havesimilarities and dissimilarities; evils are alike as well as different accordingto the times preceding and following; the evils of heavenly beings and those ofhuman beings are at once similar and dissimilar—not to speak of the tremendousdifferences between the good, evil, and neutral of the Buddha-way and [those of]the worldly way.162 [notes.html#ch5_162]One undeniable facet of values is their relativity to the conditions of a givensituation; quite often “good is understood differently in different worlds.”163[notes.html#ch5_163]A perennial question in Dōgen’s thought was “What particular course of action amI to choose here and now in this particular situation?” Dōgen himself wasacutely aware of the enormous difficulties involved in answering the question.Ejō, referring to Myōzen’s journey to China with Dōgen and others, despite histeacher Myōyū’s earnest request to nurse him on account of his criticalcondition,164 [notes.html#ch5_164] asked Dōgen the following question:In order to truly seek Dharma, it is a matter of course to renounce the bondsand encumbrances of parents and mentors in this world. However, even if wecompletely cast aside obligations and affections towards our parents, when wereflect further upon the bodhisattva way of life, should we not set aside ourown benefits and give priority to others’ welfare? When [Myōyū] was old andsick, and there was no one to nurse him, and [Myōzen] was the only person whowas in a position to help him—under such circumstances, was it not contrary tothe compassionate act of a bodhisattva to think only of his own spiritual matterand not take care of Myōyū? Moreover, a bodhisattva must not discriminate in hisgood deeds. Should we not understand the Buddha-dharma according to particularconditions and particular circumstances? Following this reasoning, should Myōzennot have stayed and helped his teacher? What do you think about this matter?165[notes.html#ch5_165]Dōgen replied as follows:In both the act of benefiting others and the way of one’s own discipline, todiscard the inferior and adopt the superior comprises the good deeds of abodhisattva. To offer a diet of beans and water in an effort to save the old andinfirm merely caters to the misguided love and deluded passions of this brieflife. If you turn your back on them and study the Way of liberation, even thoughyou may have cause for some regret, you will have a good opportunity for anenlightened life. Consider this well, consider this well!166[notes.html#ch5_166]Here we get a glimpse of a typically Dōgen-like view of compassion that was asstern and unrelenting as it could have been almost to the point of cruelty. Yetwe should not miss his rather “impersonal” search for moral excellence in Dharmafor the sake of Dharma. To be sure, moral precepts, norms, and values were theconcrete expressions of the way of bodhisattvahood, governed by wisdom andcompassion. Fundamental as they may have been, these norms were not fixed valuesto which we legalistically conform, but living expressions of the bodhisattva’sfree and pure activities in accordance with circumstances and occasions. Thiswas why Dōgen said, consistent with the Buddhist doctrine of dependentorigination:The human mind is originally neither good nor evil. Good and evil arise inaccordance with circumstances. For instance, when you have the thought ofenlightenment and enter the forest, you think that the forest life is good andthe secular life is bad. On the other hand, when you depart from the forest as aresult of your discouragement, you see it as bad. That is to say, the mind hasno fixed form and becomes either good or evil depending on the givencircumstances. Hence, the mind becomes good when it meets good conditions, badwhen it approaches bad conditions. So do not think your mind is inherently bad.Only follow good circumstances.167 [notes.html#ch5_167]Be that as it may, Dōgen never forgot to admonish his disciples to discard theinferior and adopt the superior—he relentlessly pushed them toward moral andspiritual excellence. Any conformity to worldly values such as power, wealth,fame, and knowledge was a sign of betrayal and disloyalty; any compromise withthe bonds of worldly affections and obligations was a sign of sentimentality andmoral weakness. Filial piety, for example, was not confined to one’s parents butextended to all sentient beings.168 [notes.html#ch5_168] Herein lay an importantcharacteristic of Dōgen’s sense of moral reason (dōri), which radically rejected“human feelings” (ninjō) compounded by the bonds of affections andobligations.169 [notes.html#ch5_169]Morality did not end there however. For moral excellence was not enough.Buddhism’s unique philosophical contribution was that it went beyond moralexcellence. The problem was how to save morality from legalism, conformism, andmoralism so as to attain authenticity, freedom, and purity without retreatingfrom moral involvement. For Dōgen’s part, he considered the famous “Hymn for theSeven Past Buddhas’ Precepts” (shichibutsutsūkaige), which read:Not to commit any evil,To do everything good,And to purify one’s mind,This is the teaching of all the Buddhas.170 [notes.html#ch5_170]As explained earlier in this section, good and evil are the temporary, notillusory, results of circumstances, conditions, causes, motives, and so forth,of given situations, having no self-identical nature of their own. Like anyphenomena, good and evil come and go as circumstances and conditions change inthe impermanent scheme of things. Relationality seems to be an inevitablecharacteristic of these values; accordingly, the ultimate nature of moral valuesis emptiness. However, this recognition did not lend itself to moral relativismor anarchism so far as Dōgen was concerned, because his concern was with how tolive out relativity without falling into the trap of relativism, or how torealize spiritual freedom and purity amid radical relationality. Dōgen said:Each of the evils now under investigation belongs to one of the three moralnatures—good, evil, and neutral. Their nature is unborn (mushō). Although thegood nature, the neutral nature, and so on are also unborn, undefiled, andultimately real, there are many particular forms [of moral values] in thesethree natures.171 [notes.html#ch5_171]The moral values of good, evil, and neutral did not exist in themselves or forthemselves with any independent metaphysical status, because they were nothingmore than the temporary configurations resulting from infinitely complexinteractions of conditions. In brief, good and evil did not have the self-samemetaphysical ground or source; they were without self-nature (mujishō) and werethe unattainable (fukatoku), to use customary Buddhist phraseology.172[notes.html#ch5_172]Dōgen continued:Thus, when you study supreme enlightenment by hearing the teachings, practicingthe Way, and attaining the fruits of enlightenment, it is profound, lofty, andwondrous. You hear about this supreme enlightenment through good teachers orthrough the sūtras. Then, from the beginning, “not to commit any evil” is heard.If it is not heard, that is not the right Buddha-dharma, but rather a demon’steaching.You should understand that what is heard as “not to commit any evil” isprecisely the right Dharma of Buddhism. This “not to commit any evil” is notsomething which the ordinary person contrives [through his/her moraldeliberation]. Rather, when you hear and teach enlightenment, in its concreteexpression, it is naturally heard as this [“not to commit any evil”]. This is sobecause it is the direct expression of supreme enlightenment itself. It isunmistakably the talk of enlightenment; accordingly, it speaks of enlightenment.Supreme enlightenment expresses itself and is heard, whereby one is moved by thedesire “not to commit any evil” and to live “not to commit any evil.” Where evilis no longer committed, the power of spiritual discipline is realized at once.This realization is attained by the entire earth, the entire world, for all timeand all dharmas. The limits of this attainment are none other than those of“not-committing.”173 [notes.html#ch5_173]“Not to commit any evil” was intrinsic to enlightenment and enlightenment wasbiased toward “not to commit any evil.” In other words, to commit evil wasincompatible with enlightenment, contrary to what was thought by those studentsof Zen who might have been vulnerable to the charge of “evil nondualism”(akumuge).174 [notes.html#ch5_174] From the standpoint of the contemporaneity ofbeing-Buddha (Buddha-nature) and becoming-Buddha (moral efforts), it wascontradictory to commit evil while one was enlightened; yet this did not implydenial of the human propensity for failure and guilt. The ideal of “not tocommit any evil” and the reality of human guilt were paradoxically conjoined inthe structure of enlightenment. “Not to commit any evil” was the moral, as wellas the transmoral, sensibility that was intrinsic to enlightenment.We must still live with our native existential and moral ambiguity andvulnerability—that is, our karma-boundness—but we are no longer bound by them,because of the total freedom and purity in the samādhi of self-fulfillingactivity. We must live with the law of causation as well as with human nature,owing to our particular stage in evolution. Morality cannot escape this fact.175[notes.html#ch5_175] This is why, as I have noted before in this chapter, wemust constantly repent and be forgiven. Though it may sound paradoxical,confession is an essential part of enlightenment, not a condition prior toenlightenment. Perhaps the problem may be clarified better from a slightlydifferent angle. In the course of his comments on the famous kōan of the killingof a cat by Nan-ch’üan P’u-yüan (748–835),176 [notes.html#ch5_176] Dōgenmaintained that Nanch’üan’s killing of the cat was at once a sinful act (zaisō)and a Buddha act (butsu-gyō). Dōgen went on to qualify this by saying that theBuddha act and the sinful act coexist in one and the same act—in this case, thekilling of the cat. This is why an act that is a flagrant violation of aBuddhist precept can be used transmorally as a kōan, or as a decisive word forenlightenment (ittengo)—rendering liberation to those who know how to use it.177[notes.html#ch5_177] Good and evil, ideality and actuality, means and end—andall the accompanying conflicts and contradictions—are very real and neverillusory; yet it is the transmoral quality of life that liberates andauthenticates them. When we incorporate this observation into the presentcontext, it follows that while “not to commit any evil” is an intrinsic part ofenlightenment, which disavows any possibilities of committing evil from thepurview of Buddhanature, enlightenment is such that the good and evil of theexistential states of the human being become absolutely transparent toBuddha-nature and emptiness. As such, the enlightened person is able to freelyuse evil for the ultimate good. Dōgen said:Even though such people of thusness, when authentically enlightened, appear tolive, come, and go in the environment that is conducive to evil, or encountercircumstances that engender evil, or are associated with those who commit evil,they no longer commit evil. Because the efficacious power of “not to commit [anyevil]” unfolds itself, evil loses its character as evil, being deprived of itsgrounds.178 [notes.html#ch5_178]In this respect, “Good and evil are Dharma, but Dharma is not good or evil.Dharma is nondual, evil is nondual; Dharma is nondual, good is nondual.”179[notes.html#ch5_179] Therein lies the mystery of evil.Thus, Dōgen declared:[The principle of] cause and effect in [the context of] good and evil isrealized by virtue of our practice of the Way. This does not mean, however, thatwe can alter causes and effects or create new ones. Rather, by virtue ofcausation, we are able to practice the Way. The original countenance of suchcausation is unambiguously clear, precisely because of [the original] “not tocommit,” which is birthless and impermanent, as well as of “not obscuring”[causation] and of “not falling into” [causation]: [causation] is completelycast off.As we investigate the matter in this way, it becomes clear to us that “all evil”has always been this [original] “not to commit.” Aided by such a realization, weclearly see [the true meaning of] “not to commit any evil,” thereby cutting off[all delusions] through zazen.At such a time, the beginning, middle, and end [of our practice andenlightenment] are actualized as “not to commit any evil.” Consequently, evildoes not arise from direct and indirect causes, but is solely of “not tocommit”; evil does not perish by direct and indirect causes, but is solely of“not to commit.” If all evil is nondual, all dharmas are nondual as well.Pitiful are those who know that evil is produced by various causes, but who failto see that these causes are intrinsically [within the vow power of] “not tocommit.” Since the seed of Buddhahood arises from conditions, the conditionsarise from the seed of Buddhahood.Evil is not nonexistent, but simply of “not to commit”; evil is not existent,but only of “not to commit.” Neither is evil formless, but is of “not tocommit,” nor is it form, but is of “not to commit.” Ultimately speaking, evil isnot so much “thou shalt not commit” as it is simply [the original vow of] “notto commit.” …Such an understanding of the problem [of evil] constitutes the kōan realized—thekōan realizes itself. The problem is examined from the standpoint of subject aswell as from the standpoint of object. That being the case, even if you feelremorse for having committed what you ought not to have committed, you are neveralienated [from the original vow of “not to commit”], for this very feeling isunmistakably the striving power of “not to commit” itself.180[notes.html#ch5_180]The essence of the foregoing statements is that “not to commit any evil” isneither the heteronomous “Thou shalt not” nor the autonomous “I ought not,” butis non-contrivance. Morality, if it is to be authentic, should and can arisespontaneously from enlightenment. Morality and enlightenment should not beconceived in terms of cause and effect, nor in terms of a means and an end. Atthis level of discourse, morality is not a contrivance of the ordinary mind(ushin no shukō). Both morality and enlightenment are intrinsic to the structureof Dharma. When morality becomes effortless, purposeless, and playful, itbecomes a nonmoral morality that is the culmination of Zen practice of the Wayin which morality, art, and play merge together.181 [notes.html#ch5_181] Whenought becomes is in the transparency of thusness, only then do we achieve thehighest morality. When ought becomes an expression of thusness, only then doesit reach the highest morality. Moral excellence, as such, does not constitutespiritual freedom and purity, from the religious and metaphysical standpoint. ToDōgen, as to Shinran, the ultimate height humanity could hope for in moralitywas fidelity to thusness.182 [notes.html#ch5_182]The logic of morality outlined in the foregoing was also applied to the problemof goodness. “To do everything good” (shuzen-bugyō) was similarly expounded:The “everything good” here under investigation refers to good nature as one ofthe three [moral] natures. Although all good exists in good nature, there is nota single instance of good actualized prior to, and in anticipation of, one whodoes [good]. At the very moment when a good deed is accomplished, all goodinvariably comes forth. Formless as the myriad kinds of good may be, a good act,wherever it is done, assembles them all, faster than a magnet attracts iron. Itsforce is stronger than a stormy wind that destroys everything in the universe.Even the great earth, mountains and rivers, even the world, countries and lands,as well as karma-accelerating forces, cannot hinder this confluence of allgood.183 [notes.html#ch5_183]Furthermore, Dōgen argued:Even though “everything good” consists in “what one does,” [doing good] is notfor one’s self nor is it known to this self; it is neither for others, nor is itknown to them. The intellectual understanding of self and other concerns ourjudgments as well as our perceptions; and yet, precisely for this reason, eachand every person’s living eyeball [essence] involves them, uninterruptedly: suchis the meaning of [the original] “doing” [in “to do everything good”]. At thevery moment of [the original] “doing,” the kōan is realized. This does not mean,however, that the kōan is now actualized for the first time or has endured as afixed entity. If such were the case, [“doing”] would not deserve to be calledthe original activity.…“ Good” is neither being nor nonbeing, neither form norformlessness, but is solely of “doing.” Wherever and whenever realized, it isinvariably of “doing.” In this “doing” is “all good” unmistakably realized.Although the realization of “doing” is itself the kōan, it is neither birth norextinction, neither direct conditions nor indirect conditions. The same holdstrue for the entering, dwelling, and departing of “doing.” As you endeavor to doeven a single good act among many forms of good, all dharmas, all bodies, thetrue state [of enlightenment], and all the rest will be realized in and throughthis “doing” (bugyō seraruru nari). The causes and effects of such goodness areeach the kōan realized in life.184 [notes.html#ch5_184]Good was not an entity that the moral agent treated as an object. The moralagent and the value of good partook in the event of valuational creation, whichwas said to be neither coming into being nor coming out of being, nor evenreducible to the outcome of dependent origination.185 [notes.html#ch5_185] Hereagain, “to do everything good” was play, in the samādhi of self-fulfillingactivity, that transcended ought and is. This was a radical ritualization ofmorality, amounting to the liberation of morality. In this spirit, we canunderstand the “four right efforts” (shishōgon or shishōdan): (1) to prevent theevil that has not yet arisen, (2) to abandon the evil that has already arisen,(3) to produce the good that has not yet arisen, and (4) to promote the goodthat has already arisen.186 [notes.html#ch5_186] Cult and morality wereindistinguishably fused in Dōgen’s conception of the practice of the Way.MONASTIC EDUCATION [toc.html#ch5_h2_6]The monastic order is the community of bodhisattvas who seek and realize the Waythrough a communal life of discipline, reflection, and efforts—not to mentionfears and hopes, joys and sorrows—and who share a common fate and destiny.Although there are divisions of labor and differentiations of function, for thesake of an economy of life, these are reconciled in the egalitarian, sharedstatus of the seekers and fulfillers of the Way. Even the status of teacher anddisciple become ultimately insignificant, for “Everyone must be enlightenedwithout a teacher” (mushi-dokugo), despite there being so much emphasis placedon meeting a right teacher (shōshi) and on mutual assistance between teacher anddisciple (shishi-sōjō) in Zen Buddhism. Each member is ultimately alone andsolitary in this communal setting.Since the monastic community is the community that seeks and realizes truth(shinjitsusō)—the meaning of truth, or Dharma, being wisdom and compassion inemptiness—the monastic life constitutes the educational community in whichindividuals are trained in wisdom and compassion, or in the compassion of wisdomand the wisdom of compassion. This educational process, which we will nowexamine, is deeply personal and social.Dōgen wrote:As one studies the Way by following the sūtras or becoming a teacher’s disciple,one is enlightened without a teacher (mushi-dokugo). To be enlightened without ateacher is due to the work of Dharma-nature (hosshō). Even though you arepossessed of natural knowledge (shōchi), you must always seek a teacher’sspiritual guidance for the Way. Even if you are not in possession of naturalknowledge (mushōchi), still you must study and practice the Way. Who is notendowed with natural capacity (shōchi) [for Dharma-nature]? Yet you must followthe sūtras and teachers as far as you realize the Buddha-fruition ofenlightenment.187 [notes.html#ch5_187]Dōgen modified the meaning of the Confucian idea of natural knowledge (shōchi)in the sense that all beings were naturally capable of realizing Dharma-nature.He argued that even if we encounter Dharma-nature and are instructed by thesūtras and teachers, we cannot understand Dharmanature unless we are alreadyfully prepared for it; this natural capacity was to encourage Zen students topractice with preparedness and not be complacent about it, as will becomeclearer in the course of our investigation.188 [notes.html#ch5_188] To follow aright master and study the sūtras—a personal encounter and an intellectualenterprise—were the two most important conditions that made Dharma-nature flowerin a person’s life.The study of the sūtras must be understood in the context of what we havepreviously observed in connection with Dōgen’s view on Buddhist teachings andsūtras, that is, his conception of the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma. Wenoted that Dōgen rejected the distinctions between Tathāgata Zen and AncestralZen, between the Zen sect and other Buddhist sects, between Silent-illuminationZen and Kōan-introspection Zen, and so forth, and that he attempted to restorethe classical Zen tradition that thrived during the T’ang period. Although thevicissitudes of sūtra study in the history of Zen Buddhism are indeedintriguing,189 [notes.html#ch5_189] at this point, we can only make note of thisrather unique problem in view of the peculiarities of Zen history.In the history of Zen, a wholesome skepticism concerning intellectual learning(gaku) and an emphasis on spiritual practice (gyō) tended, more often than not,to be so dichotomized that intellectual learning was rejected entirely; thisrejection was even regarded as the hallmark of Zen. Toward the end of the T’angperiod, Lin-chi I-hsüan (d. 850?), Tê-shan Hsüan-chien (780–865), and Yang-shanHui-chi (807–883) seem to have been largely responsible for this extremeposition.190 [notes.html#ch5_190] The literalistic, dogmatic interpretation ofthe two Zen principles, “a special tradition outside the sūtras”(kyōge-betsuden) and “no dependence upon words and letters” (furyū-monji), wentso far as to cause the burning of sūtras and images for their utter uselessness.As time went on, the so-called Kōan-introspection Zen discussed in Chapter 3[chapter3.html] of this book—the predominant form of Zen in the Sungperiod—replaced scriptural study with the kōan method, with its accompanyingstrengths and weaknesses. What is worthy to note, however, is that although ZenBuddhists used kōans as a meditational method, in the course of time theyengaged in the study of kōans (consisting of selected stories, parables, andsayings from the sūtras and primarily ancestral records), which became the Zensubstitute for the scriptural study of other Buddhist schools and sects. Thekōan method was a form of sūtra study.191 [notes.html#ch5_191] It seems asthough even Zen could not avoid words and letters, no matter how vigorously itmay have opposed them. Thus, by virtue of the peculiar turns in its history, ZenBuddhism constantly confronted the problem of how to deal with the sūtras andkōans, with language and symbols, and with intellectual endeavors in general, ina more acute way than any other school of Buddhism. The role of language andintellect in Zen was at question here—and was an educational issue at that.In light of this background, the building of the monastic library, and thecodification of monastics’ attitudes and conduct in connection with it, revealedDōgen’s response to this issue. It is true that in following the Zen tradition,Dōgen emphasized the spirit rather than the letter of the sūtras. No one couldhave been more vehement in denouncing the futility of “counting words andletters” (monji o kazouru) and the foolishness of those “teachers of deadletters” (monji no hosshi) than Dōgen.192 [notes.html#ch5_192] On the otherhand, Dōgen was also aware of the fact that the spirit in question did notfunction in a vacuum, but rather only by its interaction with words and letters.Thus, Dōgen detected in the Zen extremists’ view the fundamental weakness thatalienated spirit and letter, or Zen Buddhistically speaking, Buddha-mind(busshin) and Buddha-word (butsugo).193 [notes.html#ch5_193] Spirit could beactivated only by symbols; symbols could be redeemed only by spirit. Therefore,Dōgen saw the necessity of sūtra studies, provided they were understood in andthrough the practice of the Way.194 [notes.html#ch5_194] This was what he calledactional understanding (gyōge) in contrast to intellectual understanding(gakuge), as we observed earlier in this study. In this respect, the study ofsūtras acquired a legitimate status equal to meditation in the practice of theWay, as symbolized by the monastic library and the monastics’ hall in thearchitectural setting of the monastery. Together, meditation and sūtra studiesconstituted the substance of wisdom. This inclusion of sūtra studies in wisdomhad far-reaching significance in the history of Zen Buddhist education.195[notes.html#ch5_195]For Dōgen, the sūtras were not confined, as had often been seen, to the corpusof sacred texts and ancestral records of Buddhism, but included the languagesand expressions of sentient and insentient beings, things, phenomena, and eventsof the universe. The language and kōan of the universe awaited deciphering byhumans. From this viewpoint, Dōgen’s selection of Echizen, the remotemountainous region, as the site of his monastery had educational significance.Although education in the mountains and waters (sansui) was not his originalidea,196 [notes.html#ch5_196] Dōgen was deeply committed to the mountains andwaters, which provided an ideal educational environment for monks and nuns. In asense it meant that a complete change in value orientation was required for sucha radical education as the one envisioned by Dōgen; it meant a radicaldetachment from the secular world that was helplessly obsessed with and enmeshedin power, fame, wealth, and knowledge. More than this, however, it meant thatthe mountains and waters represented not only the habitat of the sages and wiseones, but also the kōan realized in daily activities (genjō-kōan). The mountainsand waters were not only the living sūtras waiting to be deciphered, but alsothe embodiment of the sages’ and wise ones’ way of life. Dōgen said:The mountains and waters, here and now, are the realization of the ancientBuddhas’ way. They equally abide in their own Dharma positions, and fulfill themerit of exerting themselves totally. Because this is the primordial fact priorto the kalpa of nothingness [of the four kalpas of the world], it is the livingaffair of their realized now. Because this is the self prior to the timelessincipience, it is the realization of their liberation. As the virtues of themountains are lofty and pervasive, the way and power of riding on the clouds[spiritual freedom] always reach out from the mountains; the wondrous workingsof following the breeze [spiritual guidance] surely become liberative throughthe mountains.197 [notes.html#ch5_197]Thus, the monastic library for scriptural studies and the mountains and watersas the cosmic sūtra or kōan realized in life, were essential to Dōgen’s visionof monastic education.Let me briefly touch upon the subject of a teacher’s role in monastic education.Dōgen’s admonition for receiving the spiritual guidance of a right teacher isfamiliar to us by now. Again and again, he tirelessly repeated the crucialimportance of meeting the right teacher. For example, he stated:Students of the Way should not hold obstinately to their personal views. Eventhough they may have a grasp of the matter, they should reason that thisunderstanding may not necessarily be a good one, or that there might be viewssuperior to it, and accordingly, should visit good teachers widely, and alsoexamine the sayings of old teachers. However, they must not cling even to thesayings of old teachers. The old teachers too may be wrong, and while trustingthem, they should be cautious. Thinking this way, they are to follow betterviews according to their quality.198 [notes.html#ch5_198]Right teachers were compared to artisans who molded artifacts out of thematerial of their disciples. The two were indispensable to one another.199[notes.html#ch5_199] Once you found the right teacher, you had to be absolutelyobedient. The disciple’s total dedication to the teacher, however, was not ablind obedience, but was based on the view that Dharma was invariably embodiedin and transmitted through a concrete person. Dharma and person were one.200[notes.html#ch5_200] For Dōgen, the teacher, as the person embodying Dharma, wasentitled to demand from the disciple absolute obedience that was devoid ofsentimentality, the bonds of worldly affections, and obligations. Both werededicated to Dharma, for the sake of Dharma.When this responsive communion (kannō-dōkō) took place between the two, Dharmablossomed in its myriad forms. Teacher and disciple engaged in a deeply personaldialogue (mondō or shōryō) in the search for truth, which could be closelycompared to the Socratic dialogue (dialektike-) in the West.201[notes.html#ch5_201] The Zen dialogue employed all possible means, such as words(including paradoxes and nonsense), bodily gestures (even apparently rough andcruel means such as slaps, kicks, shouts, etc.), and significantly enough,silence. These educational devices (upāya; hōben) were skillfully used by theteacher, with compassion and understanding, whenever and wherever necessary anddesirable for the disciple’s self-awakening. Although some of these means havefallen into disrepute in Zen training today, the point remains that all thesemeans were compassionately and judiciously used in order to guide the discipleto self-enlightenment. By necessity, the relationship between the teacher anddisciple became intensely personal, in order to facilitate the decisive event atthe right moment and occasion. Zen Buddhism compared this situation to a chickand a hen simultaneously tapping a shell from both inside and outside, to enablethe chick to emerge from its shell at the opportune moment (sottaku-dōji).202[notes.html#ch5_202] Disciples’ sharing of observations and opinions had to bematched by their teacher’s effective employment of opportune chances(tenji-tōki).203 [notes.html#ch5_203] However, the teacher was the one who wasalways aware of the fact that although the disciple’s search resembled a quest,it was the Way in actuality.204 [notes.html#ch5_204] As we see in the question“What is this that comes thus?” (which was addressed to Nan-yüeh Huai-jang byTa-chien Hui-nêng), “What” was always asked with the formless presupposition of“thusness”; accordingly, the purpose of education was to explicate andauthenticate the What, in the transparency of thusness, through the jointefforts of teacher and disciple.205 [notes.html#ch5_205]Dōgen’s view on the educational environment went beyond the sūtras and teachers.He said: “A person’s attainment of the Way depends always on many conditions(shuen). Although individuals may be sharp in their own way, their practice ofthe Way relies on the strength of many persons (shuriki); accordingly, monasticsnow should practice and seek the Way with one accord.”206 [notes.html#ch5_206]Myriads of conditions and persons were involved in the education of a personfrom delusion to enlightenment. Hence, Dōgen was severely critical of those whoretreated to their huts and pursued their studies or their own predilectionsalone, free from worldly preoccupations and worries. This was nothing but aself-conceit indicating complacency and arrogance (zō-jōman).207[notes.html#ch5_207] By contrast, the monastic life was deeply communal andsocial in that its practitioners (hindei), as bodhisattvas, worked together forthe common cause of growth in wisdom and compassion. This was a social effort toredirect physical and human resources toward a utopian vision of society; thiseffort did not simply cater to individual indulgences in avocations andpleasures. Education was essentially a social enterprise.This accounts for Dōgen’s admonitions about manners and attitudes—not only onthe part of monastics but also on the part of monastic leaders—which werespecified in detail.208 [notes.html#ch5_208] Monastic leaders were urged toexercise fairness, harmony, compassion, joyfulness, and truthfulness, whereasinferiors exercised respect, obedience, propriety, and so forth.209[notes.html#ch5_209] Those who led and those who were led, though functionallydifferent, were equals as members of the community and were responsible to eachother for maintaining the ideal environment of harmony and peace (wagō) throughselfless participation in communal activities. Such a communal life was likenedto the blending of milk and water or to crossing the ocean aboard a singleboat.210 [notes.html#ch5_210] Initially, members might have joined the communityseparately, but gradually realized that they were born of the common root ofemptiness; hence they were not an assemblage of isolated individuals but thechildren and flowers of emptiness. Monastic education was intended to help eachof them realize this common root in emptiness.As we turn to the personal aspects of monastic education, the problem becomesmuch more complicated and difficult to understand. Foremost among the personalaspects is the earnest desire and aspiration for, and thought of, enlightenment(dōshin, bodaishin, mujōshin, hosshin, etc.). It is the mind’s resolution tocast aside all worldly and selfish concerns, and to devote itself to benefitingothers, following the exemplary model of the bodhisattva ideal. Such a desire ispredominantly, if not solely, a practical concern, rather than an intellectualor theoretical one. One’s intellectual ability is not a factor in this matter,any more than are one’s wealth, status, and the like. The criterion ofeducability for the monastic education is a desire for and thought ofenlightenment, as well as the willingness to serve others withselflessness—rather than an intellectual aptitude for abstraction andtheorization. Without this decisive factor, one is ignorant and deluded inselfishness and egocentricity, however deep one may be in abstruse learning.Despite their various idiosyncrasies and diversity in personality, background,education, and so on, the monks and nuns of the monastery all share this qualityof educability for bodhisattvahood. In this sense, the monastics are a matchlesselite in selflessness.How does this thought of enlightenment arise? Is the thought innately endowed toall humans, or is it socially acquired? Dōgen said: “Who has the thought ofenlightenment from the beginning? Only when, in this way, you arouse what isdifficult to arouse, and practice what is difficult to practice, will it developnaturally. Everyone has Buddha-nature without exception; do not vainly abaseyourself.”211 [notes.html#ch5_211] Dōgen also discussed the Confucian idea ofinnate knowledge, to which I referred earlier, commenting on this by saying thatif there was such a native endowment of intellectual superiority at all, itwould mean the repudiation of the law of moral causation; needless to say,Buddhism firmly rejected such an interpretation.212 [notes.html#ch5_212] (Dōgenseems to be saying here that any “native endowments,” whether individual orcollective, are entirely the result of what we have earned individually and/orcollectively through the law of moral causation.)In any event, the thought of enlightenment, according to Dōgen, needed to belearned, cultivated, and actualized in and through a multitude ofconditions—among others, personal and social efforts and exertions. Religioussentiment in this respect was personally and socially acquired, rather thanuniversally given or endowed with certain definable forms, principles, orpotentialities. In short, the thought of enlightenment was something one had tochoose under favorable conditions; without such conditions it might never bearoused, and accordingly it might never be expressed. In this respect, we canappreciate Dōgen’s persistent reminder of the importance of a teacher’s guidanceand of sūtra study, despite Zen’s basic tenet of self-enlightenment without ateacher.However, inasmuch as the thought of enlightenment is related to Buddhanature andDharma-nature, its mystery deepens profoundly. As we have seen before,Buddha-nature does not come into or out of existence “in proportion to” or“co-extensive with” human consciousness, or even with all existence, despite thedoctrine of “All existence is Buddha-nature.”213 [notes.html#ch5_213] Further,we are told that the thought of enlightenment transcends time and space, thoughit is not hindered by them, and hence is awakened freely in any particular placeand time; for this reason, its arising is due neither to environment nor to ournative power.214 [notes.html#ch5_214] An important clue can be found where Dōgenrelated the whole matter to the mysterious phenomenon of “cosmic resonance”(kannō-dōkō):This mind [the thought of enlightenment (bodaishin)] does not existintrinsically or rise suddenly now in a vacuum. It is neither one nor many,neither spontaneous nor congealed. [This mind] is not in one’s body, and one’sbody is not in the mind. This mind is not all-pervasive throughout the entireworld. It is neither before nor after, neither existent nor nonexistent. It isnot self-nature or other-nature; nor is it common nature or causeless nature.Despite all this, arousing the thought of enlightenment occurs where cosmicresonance is present. It is neither conferred by the Buddhas and bodhisattvas,nor acquired by one’s own effort. Because the thought of enlightenment isawakened through cosmic resonance, it is not spontaneously generated.215[notes.html#ch5_215]Dōgen’s view on the mystery of the thought of enlightenment (comparable to themystery of evil and ignorance in human existence) was crystallized in theseremarks. We can see that the whole problem of the arising of the thought ofenlightenment (and the arising of religious sentiment or religiousness, for thatmatter) is far more complicated than initially anticipated. At this level ofdiscourse, the thought of enlightenment is neither endowed nor acquired, in thesimple sense of these words. What is significant here is Dōgen’s attributing themystery to the cosmic resonance of Buddhas and sentient beings and allexistence, whose primordial urge and desire for enlightenment resonate in unisonthroughout the universe, which in turn exerts itself totally in this sharedenterprise. Education must take into account this mystery of the thought ofenlightenment, or in other words, the mystery of the human being as homoreligiosus. Without doing so, education is not complete.Thus, in the monastic education, personal and social conditions work together toprovide wholesome conditions (ryōen or zen’en) that lead a monk or nun toawakening. Yet this is simply the affirmation of their own innermost being, thatis, Buddha-nature or Dharma-nature. As Dōgen wrote:Properly speaking, the direct and indirect conditions of the arising of thethought of enlightenment do not come from without, but rather by stirring thedesire for enlightenment itself, one is awakened.…In this way, the conditions of eighty thousand things and phenomena are alwaysinvolved in one’s awakening. Some were awakened in a dream and then enlightened.Others began to aspire for enlightenment in the state of drunkenness andattained the Way. Still some others have the thought of enlightenment andrealize the Way in the midst of flying flowers and falling leaves, or throughpeach blossoms and emerald bamboos. Or again, some in the heavens, others in thesea. All these amount to awakening the thought of enlightenment within thethought of enlightenment.216 [notes.html#ch5_216]This is also the meaning of self-enlightenment without a teacher. The conditionsand factors we discussed do not constitute any elements of new knowledge, butare simply regarded as germane to the embodiment of what already and always hasbeen. Fundamentally speaking, nothing has been added or subtracted by themonastic education. In this sense, Dōgen admitted the use of the “samādhi ofself-enlightenment” (jishō-zammai).217 [notes.html#ch5_217]The ultimate goal of monastic education lies in this self-awakening; its successis found in effectively helping and promoting, paradoxically enough, therealization that nothing has been taught or learned. Only then is education lifeitself, not a means to life. Education is enlightenment itself and emptinessitself.The ideal image of humanity in Dōgen’s thought was called the “person ofthusness” (immonin), Dōgen’s favorite phrase, which was comparable to the“original countenance” (honrai no memmoku) or the “person of no rank”(mui-shinjin).218 [notes.html#ch5_218] The alpha and omega of education was torealize this person of thusness throughout its processes. However, as we mightexpect, Dōgen’s emphasis was placed on a particularity in total freedom. In hiscritique of Lin-chi’s “person of no rank,” he referred to the “person of aparticular rank” (ui-shinjin) as a certain concrete individual who foundfulfillment in the process of individuation.219 [notes.html#ch5_219] Personaland social conditions and cosmic resonance all constituted concerted efforts todefine this indefinable mystery of thusness, in a concrete socio-cultural andhistorical situation."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ACHRONOLOGY OF DŌGEN’S LIFE [toc.html#appa]Events in parentheses are those of importance in understanding the historicalcontext of Dōgen’s life and thought.1185 (Final defeat of the Taira family by the Minamoto.) 1191 (Eisai transmitsRinzai Zen to Japan.) 1192 (Minamoto Yoritomo founds the Kamakura shogunate.)1198 (Senchaku hongan nembutsu-shū by Hōnen and Kōzen gokoku-ron by Eisai.) 1200Dōgen is born in the first month in Kyoto. 1202 Father, Koga Michichika, dies.(Eisai founds the Kenninji temple in Kyoto.) 1207 Dōgen’s mother dies.

Hōkyōki (Memoirs of the Hōkyō Era). One volume. This is the oldest ofDōgen’s works, memoirs that consist of questions and answers on various mattersexchanged between Ju-ching and Dōgen. The book bears its name because it waswritten in the Hōkyō (Chinese: Pao-ch’ing) era (1225–1227) of the Sung dynastywhen Dōgen was studying under Ju-ching on Mt. T’ien-t’ung. Hōkyōki wasdiscovered in 1253 by Ejō, while he was arranging Dōgen’s works; later it wasedited and published by Menzan Zuihō (1683–1769).2. Fukan zazengi (General Advice on the Principles of Zazen). One volume.This work was written perhaps immediately after Dōgen returned home in 1227 fromhis four-year period of study in China. It attempts to propagate the method andvirtue of zazen-only as the rightly transmitted Buddha-dharma. It may beregarded, with Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa,” as the manifesto of Dōgen’s view ofBuddhism. According to his Fukan zazengi senjutsu yurai (Reasons for WritingFukan zazengi), Dōgen evidently intended to modify and improve the principles ofzazen expounded by Tsung-che in the eighth volume of his Ch’an-yüan ch’ing-kuei(1103) and thereby to restore the spirit of the monastic ideal envisioned byPo-chang Huai-hai. There exists a copy of Fukan zazengi in Dōgen’s ownhandwriting called the “fair copy edition” (jōsho-bon), dated 1233. Thismanuscript is considerably different in its content and style from the popularedition (rufu-bon) which we see in Eihei Gen-zenji goroku (1358) and Dōgen oshōkōroku (or Eihei kōroku; 1672). It is the general consensus among scholars thatDōgen wrote the original copy immediately after his return from China andrevised it during his subsequent career, and that the present popular edition isthe more refined and mature version of Fukan zazengi.13. Shōbōgenzō (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye). Ninety-two chapters. This isDōgen’s magnum opus, written between 1231 and 1253. The currently popularninety-five-chapter edition was edited in 1690 by Kōzen (1648–1693), whoarranged each chapter according to the chronological order of its oralpresentation and/or writing. Traditionally well known and prior to theappearance of the Kōzen-bon were Ejō’s seventyfive-chapter edition, Giun’ssixty-chapter edition (1329), and Bonsei’s eighty-four-chapter edition (1419).According to Mizuno Yaoko’s recent textual studies based on the oldest extantmanuscripts,2 the total picture of the formation of Shōbōgenzō seemssignificantly different. Mizuno maintains that the following four were theoldest: (1) the seventy-five-chapter edition, (2) the sixty-chapter edition, (3)the twelvechapter edition, and (4) the twenty-eight-chapter edition. Dōgenundertook, sometime toward the end of his life, the composition of a hundredchapters altogether for Shōbōgenzō, by adding some new chapters to the oldmanuscripts and revising the old ones at the same time. In all probability (soconjectures Mizuno) this was the seventy-five-chapter edition, which had beenprojected and arranged by Dōgen himself with Ejō’s assistance. When he died in1253, Dōgen had completed only twelve new/revised chapters, which comprised thetwelve-chapter edition, and had still been working on the aforementionedseventy-five-chapter corpus. In short, Dōgen died prematurely without seeing thecompletion of his projected one-hundred-chapter version of Shōbōgenzō. In viewof the fact that Dōgen attempted to arrange the chapters of the two editionssystematically, not chronologically, in terms of the contents of his thought,they deserve serious attention from anyone attempting to understand his thought.On the other hand, the sixty-chapter and the twenty-eight-chapter editions,according to Mizuno, belonged together, complementing each other in theircontents, and both might have been derived from a common hypothetical source,very possibly copied by Ejō. According to this interpretation, theeighty-four-chapter edition, the ninety-five-chapter edition, and others areconstrued as derivatives from these four oldest editions. Of the four, theseventy-five-chapter edition and the twelve-chapter edition seem to reflectDōgen’s original intention most truly.34. Eihei shoso gakudō yōjinshū (Advice on Studying the Way). One volume. Thework consists of ten sections that treat, systematically, various problems offaith, zazen, and many other subjects. It was probably written in 1234 whenDōgen stayed at the Kannon-dōriin temple in Yamashiro. It is surmised by somescholars that its present form was collected and edited by Ejō. However, this isstill open to further investigation. The book was published in 1357—the earliestof Dōgen’s works to be published—indicating that it was very highly regarded bysectarians in the Sōtō tradition.45. Shōbōgenzō zuimonki (Gleanings from Master Dōgen’s Sayings). Six volumes.This is a collection of Dōgen’s talks given to Ejō after the latter became adisciple in 1234. They were recorded and edited by Ejō himself (c.1235–38). Thework has been regarded as the best introduction to the understanding of Dōgen’slife and thought as a whole. It was not until 1651 that the book was publishedfor the first time in the Keian edition (Keianbon). Later, in 1770, theso-called popular edition (Meiwa-bon or rufu-bon), with the preface by MenzanZuihō, was published and was the most widely used edition there after. However,Ōkubo Dōshū, a leading authority on Dōgen’s life, discovered the manuscript nowcalled the Chōenji edition (Chōenji-bon), at the famous Chōenji temple in Aichiprefecture in 1941. This edition (1644) was allegedly based on a manuscriptdated 1380. A number of issues and problems surrounding Shōbōgenzō zuimonki havebeen clarified since the discovery of the Chōenji edition.56. Tenzo kyōkun (Instructions to the Chief Cook). One volume. This waswritten in 1237, admonishing monastics in general and the chief cook inparticular to regard every detail of cookery as sacred. Dōgen exhorted thesanctity of the apparently ignoble duty of cooking in monastic life.7. Taidaiko goge jarihō or Taidaiko no hō (Instructions on Revering theMonastic Superiors). One volume. It was written in 1244 at the Kippōji temple inEchizen, and consisted of sixty-two rules and instructions for inferiors’conduct toward their superiors (taiko).8. Bendōhō (Rules for the Practice of the Way). One volume. Detailedinstructions on zazen, washing the face, wearing the robe, and so on. Writtenbetween 1244 and 1246 at the Daibutsuji temple in Echizen.9. Nihonkoku Echizen Eiheiji chiji shingi (Instructions for EiheijiAdministrators). One volume. Written in 1246 at the Eiheiji temple. Sixadministrators (chiji) of the monastery were instructed with respect to thetreatment of monastics and inferiors. In contrast to Taidaiko goge jarihō, thiswork was written for monastic leaders.610. Fushukuhampō (Rules for Table Manners). One volume. Written between 1246and 1253. It gave minute instructions for table manners and other relatedconduct.11. Kichijōzan Eiheiji shuryō shingi (Rules for the Eiheiji Library). Onevolume. Shuryō, separate from the monastics’ hall, was a special building forthe reading of the sūtras and Buddhist classics; accordingly, it was the centerof Buddhist studies in the monastery. The book was comprised of rules of conductin the library. Written in 1249 at the Eiheiji temple.12. Dōgen oshō kōroku (The Extensive Record of Teacher Dōgen’s Sayings). Tenvolumes. This work is a collection of Dōgen’s sermons, lectures, sayings, and soforth, which were edited by Ejō, Senne, and Gien perhaps immediately afterDōgen’s death. It also includes Fukan zazengi and “Zazen-shin.” There are threedifferent editions of the text of Dōgen oshō kōroku: (1) the Rinnōji editioncopied in 1598, (2) the popular edition printed in 1672 by Manzan Dōhaku(1636–1714), and (3) the Sozan edition (Sozan-bon), a manuscript discovered atthe Eiheiji temple in 1937, which has been proven to be older than the Rinnōjiedition. An increasing number of students of Dōgen in the post-war period feelthat the work is comparable in its importance to Shōbōgenzō, and hence, must beinvestigated thoroughly. Research in this regard has been progressing veryvigorously in recent years.713. Eihei Gen-zenji goroku (The Record of Dōgen Zenji’s Sayings). One volume.This work contains Dōgen’s sayings from the Kōshōji and Eiheiji periods, andalso Fukan zazengi and “Zazenshin.” Its contents were selected from the originalversion of Dōgen oshō kōroku (or Eihei kōroku) by Wu-wai I-yüan of China, asrequested by Dōgen’s disciple, Giin, in 1264. About one-tenth the size ofKōroku, it was first published in 1358, and was reprinted on several occasions.Of these editions, the Shōhō edition, extant at the Tōzenji temple in Aichiprefecture, was probably the oldest and was printed no later than 1649.8Notes to Appendix B1.

In the Zen monastic community, there were two groups of leaders whosupported and cooperated with its head (jūji): (1) the six administrativeleaders (chiji)—head supervisor (tsūsu), supervisor (kansu), accountant (fūsu),clerk (ino), chief cook (tenzo), and maintenance manager (shissui); (2) the sixdisciplinary leaders (chōshu)—head monastic (shuso), secretary (shoki), headlibrarian (chizō), head of reception (shika), manager of the bath (chiyoku), andmanager of the worship hall (chiden). The administrative leaders constituted the“Eastern Order,” whereas the disciplinary leaders constituted the “WesternOrder.” See Jimbo Nyoten and Andō Bun’ei, eds., Zengaku jiten.7.

[chapter1.html#ch1_10] Loc. cit., where Kagamishima observes that only twoworks, namely Murakami Sensei’s Bukkyō tōitsu-ron (1901) and Ōkawa Shūmei’sNihon bummei-shi (1921), discussed Dōgen but then only very briefly.11. [chapter1.html#ch1_11] Keiteki is a collection of Nishiari’s lectures ontwenty-nine chapters of Shōbōgenzō, which were recorded by his disciple, ToyamaSoei, and which were later edited by Kurebayashi Kōdō in 1930. It is one of thebest commentaries on Shōbōgenzō.12. [chapter1.html#ch1_12] This book was originally designed to be a manual forSōtō believers’ daily devotional life. However, the task of making the workrequired some unexpectedly painstaking efforts relative to linguistic, textual,and literary studies of Shōbōgenzō. These efforts gave an impetus in thesubsequent years to genuinely scholarly and systematic endeavors for basicresearch. Kagamishima Hiroyuki, “Dōgen zenji kenkyū no dōkō kaiko,” pp. 364–67.13. [chapter1.html#ch1_13] Akiyama later wrote another work of importance, Dōgenzenji to gyō, in 1940.14. [chapter1.html#ch1_14] Tanabe also writes: “Viewed from the philosophicalstandpoint, Dōgen’s Shōbōgenzō is matchless in its command of Japanese languageand logic, with the power to realize the ineffable in and through speech anddiscourse.”15. [chapter1.html#ch1_15] The subsequent volumes 2, 3, and 4 appeared in 1940,1944, and 1950, respectively. Hashida viewed Dōgen’s thought as providingscience with a metaphysical foundation.16. [chapter1.html#ch1_16] Kagamishima Genryū, “Dōgen zenji kenkyū no kaiko totembō,” Bungaku, vol. 29, no. 6 (June 1961), pp. 111–13.17. [chapter1.html#ch1_17] The element of faith in Dōgen’s thought is alsoemphasized by Kurebayashi Kōdō in his Dōgen-zen no kenkyū (1963), and it hasbeen a general tendency on the part of the sectarian circle to emphasize (oroveremphasize, as some critics would say) this aspect of Dōgen’s thought. Theproblem will be treated later in this study.A notable activity of the sect during this period was the establishment of Dōgenzenji sangyōkai in 1936, and the publication of Dōgen zenji kenkyū, vol. 1, no.1 (1941), a culmination of the members’ scholarly efforts in the field.18. [chapter1.html#ch1_18] Some additional works of importance in the post-warperiod: Nakamura Hajime, Tōyōjin no shii-hōhō, part 2 (1949); Masunaga Reihō,op. cit. (1956); Kurebayashi Kōdō, op. cit. (1963); Miyasaka Tetsubun, Zen niokeru ningen keisei (revised edition; 1970); and numerous articles and essays inthe Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, Journal of Sōtō Studies, Komazawadaigaku kenkyū kiyō, etc.19.

This is a significant departure from sectarianisolationism.25. [chapter1.html#ch1_25] There are so many works relevant to methodologicalproblems of the history of religions in general. To cite only a few: MirceaEliade and Joseph M. Kitagawa, eds., The History of Religions: Essays inMethodology; J. M. Kitagawa, ed., The History of Religions: Essays on theProblem of Understanding; Mircea Eliade, The Quest: History and Meaning inReligion; Robert N. Bellah, Beyond Belief: Essays on Religion in aPost-Traditional World; Wilfred C. Smith, The Meaning and End of Religion; J. M.Yinger, The Scientific Study of Religion.26. [chapter1.html#ch1_26] See Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens for religion andplay; the human being as animal symbolicum is expounded in Ernst Cassirer,Philosophy of Symbolic Forms and An Essay on Man, and Susanne Langer, Philosophyin a New Key, etc.27. [chapter1.html#ch1_27] I can cite just one example in this connection.Wilfred C. Smith, in his essay, “Comparative Religion: Whither—and Why?”(Kitagawa and Eliade, op. cit., pp. 31–58), rightly calls for the personalistapproach to religious phenomena, and in a similar vein, distinguishes, in hisThe Meaning and End of Religion, between “cumulative tradition” and “personalfaith,” maintaining that, while both are dynamic and diverse, the former ishistorically intelligible, and the latter not amenable or reducible to suchintelligibility. Smith writes: “The traditions evolve. Men’s faith varies. Godendures” (ibid., p. 173). This is no doubt salutary to our deeper understandingof religious faith. On the other hand, Smith seems to suggest that cumulativetradition is extraneous to, while personal faith is involved with, transcendence(i.e., God to Smith); hence, personal faith should be the key concern of anyunderstanding of religion. Here, Smith is unduly distrustful of any religiousexpressions that constitute cumulative tradition—and by implication, of anyhistorical and cultural investigations of religion. His analysis does notprovide us with an examination of the interrelation and interpenetration ofhistory and faith. Faith, in my view, not only “varies” but also “evolves” justas cumulative tradition does.CHAPTER TWO:DŌGEN’S LIFE1. [chapter2.html#ch2_1] There are several biographies of Dōgen traditionallyknown in the Sōtō sect. However, their materials are uncritical, full of piousfrauds and apologetic embellishments, and hence, must be critically scrutinizedand assessed. As to these traditional biographies, see Ōkubo Dōshū, Dōgenzenji-den no kenkyū, pp. 20–35. For my subsequent investigation of Dōgen’s lifeI am greatly indebted to Ōkubo’s work and Takeuchi Michio’s Dōgen.2. [chapter2.html#ch2_2] Ivan Morris, The World of the Shining Prince, p. 180.The following observations of Morris’s are particularly significant in thisconnection: “The composition, exchange, and quotation of poems was central tothe daily life of the Heian aristocracy, and it is doubtful whether any othersociety in the world has ever attached such importance to the poetic versatilityof its members” (p. 177). And: “Not only did the rule of taste extend to everysphere of life and apply to the smallest details, but (with the single exceptionof good birth) it took primacy over all else. Artistic sensibility was morehighly valued than ethical goodness. Despite the influence of Buddhism, Heiansociety was on the whole governed by style rather than by any moral principles,and good looks tended to take the place of virtue. The word yoki (‘good’)referred primarily to birth, but it also applied to a person’s beauty or to hisaesthetic sensibility; the one implication it lacked was that of ethicalrectitude. For all their talk about ‘heart’ and ‘feeling,’ this stress on thecult of the beautiful, to the virtual exclusion of any concern with charity,sometimes lends a rather chilling impression to the people of Genji’s world” (p.195).3. [chapter2.html#ch2_3] Cf. ibid., pp. 108ff. and pp. 195ff. The declining fateof aristocracy was lyrically depicted in a clear relief against the vigor of therising samurai class in Heike monogatari. In Hōjōki by Kamo no Chōmei(1153–1216), it was written: “The flow of the river is ceaseless and its wateris never the same. The bubbles that float in the pools, now vanishing, nowforming, are not of long duration: so in the world are man and his dwellings.”Donald Keene, comp. and ed., Anthology of Japanese Literature, p. 197. Suchexamples of the ethos and pathos of the age were replete in the Heian andKamakura literature.4. [chapter2.html#ch2_4] Ienaga Saburō, Nihon dōtoku shisō-shi, pp. 36–55.5. [chapter2.html#ch2_5] Ibid., pp. 72–85.6. [chapter2.html#ch2_6] ibid., pp. 97–101. Ienaga associates such an awarenessof the samurai class with Shinran’s famous statement “Even the virtuous canattain rebirth in the Pure Land and how much more so the wicked” (Tannishō,III).7.

[chapter2.html#ch2_12] There were different theories of the lengths of theThree Ages of Right Law, Imitative Law, and Degenerate Law—e.g., 500, 1,000, and10,000 years, respectively, or 1,000, 1,000, and 10,000 years. In Japan thelatter scheme was adopted and calculated from 949 B.C.E., the presumed date ofBuddha’s death. Mappō thought was popular in China from the sixth century on andin Japan from the tenth century on.13. [chapter2.html#ch2_13] For example, see Shinran’s “Hymn on the Three Ages”in The Shinshū Seiten, pp. 236–37.14. [chapter2.html#ch2_14] Reischauer’s following observation is noteworthy: “Itis, indeed, a curious fact that the popular Buddhism of feudal Japan had in manyways come to resemble Christianity more than historic Buddhism. Reversing thebasic pessimism of the early faith, it had come to stress a real afterlife andsalvation through faith. And the early feudal religious reformers, in theirtranslations of the scriptures, their creation of lay congregations, theirmarriage of the clergy, their militant sectarianism, and their nascentnationalism, resembled to a surprising degree the Protestant reformers ofEurope. These religious trends, coupled with the development of a feudal systemwhich found much closer parallels in medieval Europe than in East Asia, make theearly feudal period in Japan a time for startling comparisons with Europe andstrong contrasts with other countries in the Far East.” Op. cit., p. 60.15. [chapter2.html#ch2_15] Shōbōgenzō zuimonki, I:2. Hereafter I shall refer tothis work as Zuimonki in the present study. Cf. ibid., V:6. Dōgen often employedthe doctrine in his writings. For example, he wrote: “In the ancient Ages ofRight Law and Imitative Law, Buddha’s disciples all knew this truth, and theypracticed and studied it. Nowadays, amongst a thousand monastics, not a singleperson knows these eight awarenesses of great persons (hachidainingaku). It is apity—nothing is comparable to the degeneration of these latter days”(Shōbōgenzō, “Hachi-dainingaku”). See also ibid., “Kesa-kudoku,” “Den’e,”“Shisho,” etc.16. [chapter2.html#ch2_16] Zuimonki, III:20 and I:8.17. [chapter2.html#ch2_17] Dōgen said: “Worldly people would probably say:‘Although we earnestly desire to study the Way, it is the Age of DegenerateLaw—we are degraded, and our capacity to understand the teachings of Buddhism islow. We cannot undergo spiritual discipline according to Dharma. We shouldsimply be contented with our lot, follow an easy path, think of having aconnection with Buddha, and hope to attain enlightenment in a subsequentexistence.’ What has just been said is altogether mistaken. In theBuddha-dharma, to advocate the divisions of the Three Ages of Right Law,Imitative Law, and Degenerate Law is a provisional means of instruction, but notthe true teaching of the Way. If you practice according to the teachings, youwill be enlightened without fail. Monastics during Buddha’s lifetime were notnecessarily superior; in fact some of them were unimaginably wretched and of lowcharacter. When Buddha set forth various rules and precepts, they were all forwicked and despicable people. Each of us is capable of realizing theBuddha-dharma; do not ever think you are unfit. If you follow the teachings inyour practice, you will surely attain the Way. Once you have the rightintention, you are capable of discriminating between good and evil. You haveyour hands and feet, and lack for nothing, in order to join your palms or walk.In the practice of the Buddha-dharma, make no distinction between classes orranks. Indeed the life of all humans is endowed with all the capacity that isabsent in the life of other beings, such as animals.” Ibid., V:12.Elsewhere, Dōgen stated in a similar vein: “While the doctrinal schools ofBuddhism are preoccupied with names and appearances, in the true teachings ofthe Mahāyāna there is no distinction between Right Law, Imitative Law, andDegenerate Law. It teaches that whenever one practices the Way, one surelyattains it. Indeed, in this authentically transmitted Dharma, whether you enterDharma or emerge from it, you use your native treasure all the same. Whether youare enlightened or not is known by you who practice the Way; it may be likenedto a person who uses water, and thereby knows by himself/herself whether thewater is cold or warm.” Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa.”18.

In Gakudō yōjinshū, 4, Dōgen said:“The Buddha-dharma should never be practiced for one’s own sake, not to mentionfor the sake of fame or gain. You should practice it solely for the sake of theBuddha-dharma.”34. [chapter2.html#ch2_34] Ōkubo doubts this because the regulation at Hieiconcerning the bodhisattva ordination (bosatsukai) was that it was given whenone reached the age of twenty.

[chapter2.html#ch2_45] Ōkubo, op. cit., p. 80.46. [chapter2.html#ch2_46] As for Kōin himself, he increasingly becamedissatisfied with the Tendai school and finally turned to Hōnen’s Pure RealmBuddhism in his later life. In view of this, it is puzzling that Kōinrecommended Zen rather than the Pure Realm tradition to Dōgen. We can onlysurmise that Kōin, a wise teacher, perceived, perhaps correctly, theadvisability for Dōgen of studying Zen in view of his temperament and interests.It is also said that Kōin at this time may have recommended Dōgen to go to Chinafor study immediately. Ibid., pp. 81–82. Dōgen referred to Kōin in Zuimonki,III:8.47. [chapter2.html#ch2_47] Ibid., V:8.48. [chapter2.html#ch2_48] Ōkubo, op. cit., pp. 83–109.49. [chapter2.html#ch2_49] Hōkyōki, 1.

Also in Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa,”Dōgen said: “Ever since my initiation into Buddhism to seek Dharma, I hadvisited teachers extensively all over Japan.”52. [chapter2.html#ch2_52] Ibid., “Bendōwa.”53.

See also his article,“Dōgen no rekishi-teki seikaku,” Bungaku, vol. 29, no. 6 (June 1961), pp. 42–50.56. [chapter2.html#ch2_56] According to Zuimonki, VI:15, Myōyū, Myōzen’s teacheron Mt. Hiei, realizing that his time had come, sent a message to Myōzen, askingfor the postponement of the latter’s departure so that he could administer histeacher’s death-watch. Myōzen was greatly agonized by this request—he was in adilemma as to whether he should accede to the old mentor’s request, as humancompassion prompts, or leave for China to seek the truth of Buddhism. Myōzenconsulted with his disciples about this matter. The majority of them earnestlyrecommended that he defer the journey for the following year, while Dōgen wasthe only person who urged him to leave for China immediately as they hadplanned. Myōzen finally followed Dōgen’s advice and went to China.57. [chapter2.html#ch2_57] Ibid., VI:19. Dōgen recalled: “Years ago when I wascrossing the sea to enter China, I suffered while aboard from severe diarrhea.When the whole ship was in a great turmoil owing to a terrible storm, I forgotthe illness and found myself healed.”58. [chapter2.html#ch2_58] The question as to why Dōgen stayed on board for afull three months cannot be answered.59. [chapter2.html#ch2_59] Tenzo kyōkun.

[chapter2.html#ch2_73] Concerning Tsung-kao, see also ibid., “Jishō-zammai”and “Ōsaku-sendaba.” Dōgen’s attitude toward Rinzai Zen was somewhat puzzling,not always free from his sectarian consciousness and sense of rivalry with thatdominant sect. In this connection, see Rikukawa Taiun, “Dōgen zenji no Daiezenji hihan ni tsuite,” Zengaku kenkyū, no. 55 (February 1966), pp. 56–70;Tamamura Takeji, “Eihei Dōgen no Rinzai-shū ni taisuru kanjō,” Nihon rekishi,no. 47 (April 1952), pp. 26–31; Furuta Shōkin, Nihon Bukkyō shisō-shi noshomondai, pp. 145–61. Although Ju-ching’s relationship with Rinzai Zen wasdifficult to determine, Tamamura conjectures that Dōgen’s hostility to RinzaiZen might have been influenced by Ju-ching, whereas Furuta thinks that Ju-chinghad no anti-Rinzai sentiments and hence Dōgen’s hostility had to do with hissense of rivalry with the opposing sect, particularly around 1243 andthereafter. Concerning Dōgen’s mistaken observations of Tsung-kao, see RikukawaTaiun’s aforementioned article.74. [chapter2.html#ch2_74] Shōbōgenzō, “Busshō.” Dōgen described his visit inthe fall of 1223 to the Kuang-li-ssŭ temple on Mt. A-yü-wang where theaforementioned chief cook had once stayed, and where Dōgen was thoroughlydisappointed. It was during this period that Dōgen had the quite unusualprivilege of seeing the genealogical documents (shisho) of various sects, alongwith that of his mentor, Wu-chi Liao-p’ai. The genealogical documentsrepresented the Zen Buddhist version of “apostolic succession” and were notshown except to very special persons on exceptional occasions. See ibid.,“Shisho.”75. [chapter2.html#ch2_75] Takeuchi, op. cit., pp. 128–48. Between the winter of1224 and the fifth month of 1225, Dōgen visited, among others, Che-wêng Ju-yenat the Ching-shan Wan-shou-ssŭ temple and Yüan-tzŭ at the Wan-nien-ssŭ temple inP’ing-t’ien.76.

[chapter2.html#ch2_79] Ibid., “Baika.” Dōgen later wrote: “How fortunate wasI! A nameless monastic from a remote foreign country, I was not only permittedto become his disciple, but was also allowed to access his private quarters, towitness his reverend face, and to listen to his discourse on the Way!Slow-minded as I was, this was a precious opportunity that I could not possiblywaste.”80. [chapter2.html#ch2_80] Gakudō yōjinshū, 5.81. [chapter2.html#ch2_81] Shōbōgenzō, “Hotsu-bodaishin.”82. [chapter2.html#ch2_82] Gakudō yōjinshū.83. [chapter2.html#ch2_83] The verb “to meet” (au, ou, aiou, etc.) was used byDōgen not only with respect to person but also with respect to Dharma, the Way,the sūtras, the seasons, and so on. Thus he often used such phrases as “to meetDharma,” “to meet the sūtras,” and “to meet the seasons.”84. [chapter2.html#ch2_84] Shōbōgenzō, “Mitsugo.”85. [chapter2.html#ch2_85] The other line was the one of Hung-chih Chêng-chüeh(1091–1157), which was transmitted to Japan by Tōmyō E’nichi (1272–1340) in1309.86. [chapter2.html#ch2_86] Ibid., “Gyōji.”87. [chapter2.html#ch2_87] Zuimonki, III:30.88. [chapter2.html#ch2_88] Ibid., II:9. Dōgen also reminisced: “One dayJu-ching’s attendants told him: ‘Monastics in the monastics’ hall are sufferingfrom fatigue and insufficient sleep, which might damage their health as well asmorale. This seems due to the long practice of zazen. We would like to ask youto shorten the zazen practice.’ However, Ju-ching sternly admonished them: ‘Youare mistaken. Those who do not have earnestness in zazen and just nominallyappear in the monastics’ hall will, after all, doze after even a short while.Those who have the willingness to practice zazen with a believing mind, on theother hand, will be glad to discipline themselves no matter how long it maylast. When I was young, I presided over various monasteries and advised in thismanner, and struck drowsing monastics so hard I almost broke my fist. Now I amadvanced in age and weakened in physical strength, so I cannot strike others ashard as before; consequently, good monastics have not been produced. Becauseleaders of various monastic communities, likewise, are too easy on theirstudents in the practice of zazen, the Buddhadharma is on the decline. I oughtto strike more than ever.’ That was all.” Ibid., III:30.89. [chapter2.html#ch2_89] Shōbōgenzō, “Gyōji.”90. [chapter2.html#ch2_90] Ibid., “Gyōji.”91. [chapter2.html#ch2_91] Ibid., “Gyōji.” Dōgen observed: “An ancient sage oncesaid that we should not care a bit about gold, silver, or jewels. Even ifmonastics appreciate gold and silver, it is best for their way of life to notreceive them. I witnessed this in my deceased teacher and no others.”92. [chapter2.html#ch2_92] Ibid., “Butsudō.”93. [chapter2.html#ch2_93] Ibid., “Butsudō.”94. [chapter2.html#ch2_94] Ibid., “Shohō-jissō.” Concerning Dōgen’s own view onthis matter, see particularly ibid., “Shizenbiku.”95. [chapter2.html#ch2_95] The relationship between Ju-ching’s and Dōgen’sthought is still very much a moot question in Dōgen studies, primarily owing tothe scarcity of historical materials on Juching. Many of Dōgen’s observationsand claims revealed more of Dōgen himself than of Ju-ching. This is NakamuraHajime’s contention. For example, he writes in the context of his discussion ofDōgen’s Hōkyōki: “It is commonly considered that Dōgen’s religion is a faithfulcontinuation of its Chinese counterpart. But the fact that the thought of theShōbōgenzō coincides with the teachings of Ju-ching, as recorded in the Hōkyōki… does not justify this opinion.… It is feared that in the sayings of Ju-chingquoted there, Dōgen’s wishful interpretations have probably been added.” Op.cit., p. 672, note 229; see also p. 667, note 163. Furuta Shōkin is of theopinion that, judging from the records of Ju-ching’s acts and sayings, heappears to have been inclined rather to kōan Zen. This is contrary to Dōgen’sinsistence that Ju-ching advocated zazen-only. See “The Development of ZenThought in Japan,” Philosophical Studies of Japan, vol. 3 (1961), pp. 41–42.As to Ju-ching’s thought, see the following: Itō Keidō, Dōgen zenji kenkyū, vol.1; Ōkubo Dōshū, op. cit., pp. 502–38; Ui Hakuju, Zenshū-shi kenkyū, vol. 3, pp.463–67; Nukariya Kaiten, Zengaku shisō-shi, vol. 2, pp. 403–20.96. [chapter2.html#ch2_96] Gakudō yōjinshū, 5.97. [chapter2.html#ch2_97] For example: “In the past two or three hundred yearsof the great Sung dynasty, there appeared no old Buddha like my deceasedteacher.” Shōbōgenzō, “Hensan.” Elsewhere: “In the past four or five hundredyears, my deceased teacher alone gouged out the eyeball [which elucidated andverified the wisdom] of the Buddhas and ancestors and sat in meditation withtheir eyeball. Few can compare with him in China. It is rare indeed to findthose who comprehend clearly that sitting in zazen is the Buddha-dharma, and theBuddha-dharma is sitting in zazen. Even if one may understand sitting in zazenas the Buddha-dharma, no one has yet penetrated sitting as sitting [for the sakeof sitting], much less maintained the Buddha-dharma as the Buddha-dharma.”Ibid., “Zammai-ōzammai.”98. [chapter2.html#ch2_98] In this connection, see Nakamura, op. cit., pp.452–54. Nakamura contends that absolute devotion to a specific person cannot befound even in the feudalistic societies of India and China but is unique toJapan. In this respect Dōgen differed from Ju-ching.99. [chapter2.html#ch2_99] Zuimonki, I:1.100. [chapter2.html#ch2_100] Shōbōgenzō, “Kattō.” Cf. ibid., “Menju.” SeeTakeuchi, op. cit., pp. 161–63.101.

[chapter2.html#ch2_107] Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa.”108. [chapter2.html#ch2_108] With respect to the Kenninji temple specifically,Dōgen observed: “As I compare what I saw when I entered the Kenninii temple forthe first time with what I saw some seven or eight years later, some subtlechanges were noticeable. Monastics made elaborate closets in each of their huts,had personal belongings, cared for beautiful clothes, amassed fortunes, enjoyedlicentious talks, and defaulted on greetings and worship. From this, I couldsurmise the situation of other temples.” Zuimonki, IV:4. See also II:21.109. [chapter2.html#ch2_109] Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa.”110. [chapter2.html#ch2_110] Fukan zazengi.111.

[chapter2.html#ch2_113] Shuso functioned as assistant abbot of themonastery.114. [chapter2.html#ch2_114] Shōkū was Dōgen’s elder brother and one of theablest disciples of Hōnen. He later founded the Kōmyōji temple.115. [chapter2.html#ch2_115] Zuimonki, III:12. “People nowadays are apt to thinkthat the propagation of the Buddha-dharma consists of making Buddha images,building pagodas, and the like. This is a mistake. Even though a soaring templeinlaid with gems and plated with gold boasts of a grand view, one cannot attainthe Way by it.… Even if in a hut or under a tree you contemplate upon a phraseof Dharma or practice zazen even for a short while, that is the way to trueprosperity of the Buddha-dharma.” Loc. cit.116.

Dōgen replied: ‘No. If people have the will tostudy Dharma, they should come and study even though they must cross mountainsand rivers and oceans. If I go out to counsel those who have no such intent, Iam not so sure whether they will accept it at all. Then is it merely for thepurpose of deceiving them to obtain material help for myself and to acquireriches? Since it brings me nothing but pains, I feel I need not go.’ ” Who“someone” in this quotation was is not certain. This may have been HatanoYoshige as Tsuji conjectures.

Dōgen was completely apolitical. Moreover, hecautioned the monastics against keeping or owning bows, arrows, swords, or anyother weapons. He emphatically prohibited the possession of all weapons forimmoral purposes in the monastic compound.142.

[chapter3.html#ch3_3] The tension between meditation and wisdom has beenperennial since the inception of Buddhism on Indian soil. As E. Conze observes,this tension can be seen already in the canonical texts such as theSaṃyutta-Nikaya in which the “people of trance” and the “people of wisdom” arerepresented by Musila and Narada, respectively. Both the people of trance andthe people of wisdom have been equally vital forces in the development ofBuddhist thought. See Conze, Buddhism: Its Essence and Development, pp. 161–62.4. [chapter3.html#ch3_4] Zen Buddhism was called the school of the Buddha-mindbecause Dharma was transmitted from mind to mind or through personal encounter,without depending on the doctrines and scriptures. Other Buddhist sects belongedto the school of the Buddha-word because the transmission of Dharma, accordingto Zen interpretation, relied heavily upon the study of the scriptures anddoctrines. As for Dōgen’s attack on this distinction, see Shōbōgenzō, “Butsudō.”5. [chapter3.html#ch3_5] According to the classification of meditation byKuei-fêng Tsung-mi (780–841), there were five types: (1) Non-Buddhist Zen(gedō-zen), (2) Ordinary Person’s Zen (bombuzen), (3) Lesser Vehicle Zen(shōjō-zen), (4) Great Vehicle Zen (daijō-zen), and (5) Highest Vehicle Zen orTathāgata Zen (saijōjō-zen or nyorai-shōjō-zen). In this scheme, Tathāgata Zenwas superior to the other types of meditation. Yang-shan Hui-chi (807–883)probably first made the distinction between Tathāgata Zen and Ancestral Zen, butthe distinction became widely accepted by Zen Buddhists in the Sung period. Theresult was an exaltation of Ancestral Zen, which was allegedly taught byBodhidharma and transmitted by the ancestors who followed him, in opposition toTsungmi’s Tathāgata Zen, which was regarded as quietistic, doctrinal, andscriptural.6.

[chapter3.html#ch3_12] Ibid., “Bukkyō” (47).13. [chapter3.html#ch3_13] Ibid., “Bukkyō” (47). In the same chapter, Dōgen alsowrote: “In the country of great Sung today, some people hold the title ofTeacher and function in the position of Zen teacher, and yet, because they areutterly shameless, they absurdly distort the Buddhaway, so much so that theBuddha-dharma hardly exists. These elders say in unison: ‘The original intentionof the Buddha-way resides not in the sūtras but in the ancestral traditionthrough which its uniqueness and profundity have been imparted.’ Such astatement is wretched stupidity to the extreme and a lunatic’s allegation. Inthe authentically transmitted ancestral tradition, there is not a single word orphrase that is genuine and still in discord with the sūtras. Both the sūtras andthe ancestral way have been rightly imparted and disseminated from ŚākyamuniBuddha. The ancestral heritage is simply an uninterrupted succession from him.For this reason, how can [the ancestors] fail to understand the sūtras? How canthey fail to elucidate them, and read and recite them?”14. [chapter3.html#ch3_14] See ibid., “Bukkyō” (34), “Immo,” etc.15. [chapter3.html#ch3_15] Ibid., “Zazenshin.”16.

[chapter3.html#ch3_21] Ibid., “Bendōwa.” In this sense, the distinctionbetween the two forms of samādhi was similar to the distinction between esotericand exoteric Buddhism that was made by Kūkai (774–835). However, in the contextof Dōgen’s thought, the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity was realized in theconcrete historical body of Buddha, which defied any interpretation in terms oftraditional “trinitarian” categories of the Buddha-body. As an unconditionedfreedom, the samādhi of self-fulfilling activity was also extremely akin toShinran’s “naturalness” (jinen-hōni), the spontaneous working of Tathāgata’svow-power without human contrivance.22. [chapter3.html#ch3_22] Ibid., “Bendōwa.” This statement was made as acriticism of the Tendai, Kegon, and Shingon schools of Buddhism; Dōgen clearlyemphasized practice rather than doctrine. Cf. Etō, Shōbōgenzō josetsu, pp.175–85.23. [chapter3.html#ch3_23] Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa.”24. [chapter3.html#ch3_24] Yampolsky, op. cit., sections 13 and 15.25.

However, this has been generally refuted. The edition or text of thesūtra Dōgen read cannot be determined at the present time, but Ōkubo maintainsthat Dōgen’s text was different from all other editions—the Tun-huang, Daijōji,Kōshōji, and popular editions.27.

[chapter3.html#ch3_32] The historical and cultural background of Buddhistmeditation is an enormously complex and difficult subject, which I do not wishto treat in this work in detail. Nevertheless we should always keep in mind thisvast background against which Dōgen’s thought was operative. Buddhism was deeplyindebted to the yogic tradition of preBuddhist India. Śākyamuni Buddha himselfwas acquainted with the yogic traditions, and the practice of yogic exercises byhis followers was recorded in the earliest canonical texts of Buddhism.

It continued as follows: “Itsmanner and principle are such that they cut off your working consciousness andprevent you from heading down the path of intellectual understanding. This isprecisely a method of inducement for the beginner. Thereafter, they enable youto cast off your body and mind and let go of delusion and enlightenment. This isthe second stage. Generally speaking, it is the hardest thing for us to meetthose who believe they are in the Buddha-way. If you undoubtedly believe you arein the Way, you will naturally understand the passage and blockage of the greatWay and comprehend the reasons for delusion and enlightenment. So experimentwith cutting off your working consciousness, and eight or nine times out of ten,you will be able to find the Way instantly.”A few illustrations in relation to Dōgen’s view of faith are quoted in thefollowing: “Indeed the realm of Buddhas is incomprehensible and beyond the reachof the mind and consciousness, let alone those minds with unbelief and inferiorapprehension. Only a person of great capacity and right faith can legitimatelyenter it. A person of no faith, even if he/she is instructed, has difficulty inaccepting it. Even on the Vulture Peak [where Buddha is said to have expoundedthe Saddharma-puṇḍarīka sūtra] there were those who were allowed to leave thecongregation. Thus when right faith arises in your mind, you should practice andstudy; otherwise, you should quit for a while, and regret for yourself the wantof Dharma’s benefits from the past” (Shōbōgenzō, “Bendōwa”). “When both yourmind and your flesh may be at times in idleness or in unbelief, you shouldconfess in utter sincerity to the Buddhas who are before you. When you repent inthis manner, those Buddhas will liberate and purify you, through the meritoriouspower of your confession. This merit will richly nurture pure faith andspiritual endeavor, which are unobstructed. As your pure faith is realized, youyourself and all others will be tranformed; the sentient and insentient beingsshall enjoy its benefits far and wide” (ibid., “Keisei-sanshoku”). “What we callkie means this: ki is surrender, and e dependence. Thus we call them kie. Thecharacteristic of surrender is, for instance, like a son returning to hisfather. Dependence is likened to the subject’s reliance on the ruler. Kie meanssalvation. We take refuge in Buddha because he is a great teacher; we takerefuge in Dharma because it is a good medicine; and we take refuge in Saṃghabecause it is a superior fellowship” (ibid., “Kie-buppōsōbō”). “We honor theBuddhas of the past, renounce the mundane life, and follow their way oflife—such acts surely enable us to become Buddhas. One becomes a Buddha byvirtue of the merit of one’s honoring all Buddhas. How can any sentient beingthat has never honored a single Buddha attain Buddhahood? Without cause noBuddhahood shall be attained” (ibid., “Kuyō-shobutsu”). “Even during Buddha’slifetime there were an old monk who attained the Four Fruits by [being hit byjesting young monks’] handballs, and a nun who attained the great Way as aresult of wearing a surplice [in her previous life as a prostitute]. Both werewretchedly idiotic persons, being as good as insane brutes. Only through theassistance of right faith is there a way to be severed from delusion.Furthermore, a devout woman, who served a meal to a senile monk [in order tohear a sermon from him], saw his silent sitting in meditation [which hepretended, because he did not know anything to preach], yet she was enlightened.These cases did not depend on knowledge or letters; nor did they wait for wordsor speeches. They were aided solely by right faith” (ibid., “Bendōwa”). Cf.Zuimonki, II:15. In these illustrations Dōgen’s view of faith in terms of trust,obedience, dependence, surrender, and commitment is clear.62. [chapter3.html#ch3_62] Shōbōgenzō, “Sanjūshichihon-bodaibumpō.”63. [chapter3.html#ch3_63] As a result, Pure Realm Buddhism is often construedby some as a deviation from the fundamental Buddhist religion.64.

See ibid.,“Tembōrin.” In addition to the Śuraḍgama sūtra, Dōgen regarded the Engaku-kyō asapocryphal as well.100. [chapter3.html#ch3_100] Shōbōgenzō, “Bukkyō” (47).101.

To express the words of the Buddhas andancestors, even just two or three of them, is tantamount to expressing theBuddhas and ancestors themselves. The reason is that because their bodies andminds are one, a phrase or two constitutes their warm body-mind. That body-mindcomes forth and expresses my body-mind. In such a moment, that expression comesforth and embodies our body-mind. [As an ancient teacher once suggested], inthis present life you ought to express all of your accumulated lives throughyour liberation.

[chapter3.html#ch3_111] For my observations on the following problem, I amindebted to Furuta, “Genjō-kōan no igi” and “Kōan no rekishi-teki hatten-keitaini okeru shinrisei no mondai,” both of which were cited previously.112. [chapter3.html#ch3_112] Furuta observes in the above-cited essays that bothTa-hui Tsung-kao and Hung-chih Chêng-chüeh used kosoku-kōan in the light ofgenjō-kōan and also adopted zazen as essential; in short, both masters used kōanand zazen, freely. Furuta further observes that to distinguish betweenKōan-introspection Zen and Silent-illumination Zen on the basis of the use ornon-use of kōan was rather erroneous and historically unfounded; the distinctionarose from the practice of abuses of both kōan and zazen which became ratherconspicuous later in the Sung period. It is interesting to note in thisconnection that Ta-hui burned the Pi-yen lu when he realized the detrimentaleffects of the kōan method, and that Hung-chih edited the Ts’ung-yung lu,another important collection of kōans, despite or because of his supposedassociation with Silent-illumination Zen. All in all, sectarian conflictsbetween the two traditions have been unduly exaggerated by Zen Buddhiststhemselves as well as by the historians of Zen.Regarding Dōgen’s view on this matter, see further Zuimonki, III:15 and VI:27.113. [chapter3.html#ch3_113] This was quite evident in Dōgen’s extensive use ofkōans in Shōbōgenzō and other works. Dōgen also compiled and edited threehundred important kōans in his Shōbōgenzō sambyakusoku, the authenticity ofwhich was definitively established as a result of the discovery in 1935 of thesecond of the three-volume work at the Kanazawa bunko.114. [chapter3.html#ch3_114] Dōgen’s high praise of Yüan-wu and denunciation ofTa-hui Tsung-kao (e.g., in Shōbōgenzō, “Jishō-zammai”), who both belonged toKōan-introspection Zen, and his adoption of the idea of “total dynamism”(zenki), which was Yüan-wu’s and to which Dōgen devoted a chapter in Shōbōgenzō,indicated that Yüan-wu had great influence upon Dōgen’s thought. See Furuta,“Genjō-Kōan no igi.”115. [chapter3.html#ch3_115] Furuta, “Genjō-koan no igi.”116. [chapter3.html#ch3_116] Cf. D. T. Suzuki, Essays in Zen Buddhism, SecondSeries, pp. 17–211 for his exposition of the kōan method from historical,psychological, and systematic standpoints. The following statement, for example,is suggestive of Suzuki’s interpretation: “Zen has its definite object, which is‘to open our minds to satori’ as we say, and in order to bring about this stateof consciousness a kōan is held out before the mental eye, not to meditate on,nor to keep the mind in a state of receptivity, but to use the kōan as a kind ofpole with which to leap over the stream of relativity to the other side of theAbsolute.” Ibid., p. 99, note 1.117.

Austin, “Performative Utterances,” in Philosophical Papers,pp. 220–39; idem, How to Do Things with Words, ed. by J. O. Urmson. From thestandpoint of the analysis of ordinary language, Austin explores numerouspossibilities for “doing things with words,” in contrast to the conventionalfunction of language, as describing and reporting some state of affairs and,hence, as being either true or false. Although vastly different from Austin inhis philosophical and religious orientation and method, Dōgen was also aware ofthe limitations of a traditional Buddhist view of language (that was comparableto Austin’s descriptive or constative fallacy) and pointed to the performativepossibilities of words in the realm of religion.119.

However, hedoes not distinguish logos clearly enough from Dōgen’s conception of expressionthat was firmly rooted in the Buddhist idea of emptiness. In the history ofWestern philosophy the notion of logos has been associated with the immutableintelligible order of everchanging nature. Such an absolute immutability of theintelligible order has often tended to divorce itself from its original roots innature and to claim its own metaphysical status independent of nature.If Heidegger’s analysis of the fate of the logos in the history of Westernphilosophy is correct, what he calls the “secession of the logos” (which tookplace in Plato and Aristotle and was completed in Hegel) has resulted in acomplete separation between thought and reality and is responsible for thehegemony of reason and thought. M. Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics,pp. 98–164.Expression in Dōgen was impermanent—arising and perishing in accordance with thedependent origination of the universe; hence it was empty—having no self-natureand absolute validity. However, as will become clearer later, Dōgen radicalizedthe Buddhist idea of emptiness by eliminating every possible vestige ofidealism, monism, and pantheism.157. [chapter3.html#ch3_157] I am indebted to Watsuji’s aforementioned essay forsome aspects of the observations made here with respect to dōtoku and kattō.158. [chapter3.html#ch3_158] Shōbōgenzō, “Kattō.” Cf. ibid., “Genjō-kōan”: “Whenour bodies and minds are not fully filled with Dharma, we believe that it isalready sufficient. If Dharma fills our bodies and minds, we think something isstill missing. For example, if you take a boat out to the vast expanse of a sea,where no mountains are visible, and look around in all directions, only theroundness of the expanse will strike you and no other characteristics whateverwill be seen. However, this great ocean is neither round nor square; its othercharacteristics are inexhaustible. It is like a palace for some beings and likejewels for others. Only as far as our vision can reach does it appear to beround for the time being. Analogously, this holds true of all things. Althoughthe world is pregnant with myriad characteristics, mundane or otherwise, we seeand understand only to the extent of our power of penetration and vision. Inorder to understand the ways of all dharmas, we must realize that in addition towhat appears to be round or square, other features of oceans and mountains areindeed infinite, and that there are many worlds on all sides. You should realizethat the environment around us, the spot right beneath our feet, and even a dropof water are exactly like this.”159. [chapter3.html#ch3_159] Ibid., “Kattō.”160. [chapter3.html#ch3_160] Ibid., “Kattō”161. [chapter3.html#ch3_161] Ibid., “Kattō.”162. [chapter3.html#ch3_162] Compare this with the following statements selectedat random: D. T. Suzuki: “The truth can be reached when it is neither assertednor negated. This is indeed the dilemma of life, but the Zen masters are everinsistent on escaping the dilemma.” Zen Buddhism (ed. by W. Barrett), p. 118. E.Conze: “Nothing is more alien to the mentality of the sage than to fight orcontend for or against anything. This peacefulness of the true sage is the germof the Mādhyamika dialectics.” Buddhism: Its Essence and Development, p. 136.Sangharakshita: “So long as the mind oscillates between contradictorystatements, trying to determine which of them is true and which false, theaspirant remains immured within the mundane; but no sooner does he embark upon abold identification of opposites than, bypassing the intellect, he disappearsfrom the phenomenal plane and reappears in the Transcendental, in the domain anddimension of Emptiness.” Op. cit., p. 218. Despite their legitimate intention,Suzuki, Conze, and Sangharakshita do not adequately cope with the question ofhow dilemmas and conflicts (unmistakably real, not illusory in life) can belegitimately accepted in the enlightened life. From this standpoint, Dōgen’s Zenwas governed not by the logic of transcendence so much as by the logic ofrealization.163. [chapter3.html#ch3_163] Shōbōgenzō, “Kattō.”164. [chapter3.html#ch3_164] Ibid., “Kattō.”165. [chapter3.html#ch3_165] Ibid., “Kattō.”166. [chapter3.html#ch3_166] Such a view of philosophic activity was comparableto Asaṅga’s “acquired wisdom” (tatpṛṣtha-labdha-jñāna), which referred to thatwisdom which was no longer just beyond the expressions of human thought, but wasembedded within them and regarded as superior to mere silence or ineffability.See Ueda Yoshifumi, “Thinking in Buddhist Philosophy,” Philosophical Studies ofJapan, vol. 5 (1964), pp. 69–94. It was also comparable to the dynamicrelationship between the sixth Perfection (prajñā) and the tenth Perfection(jñāna) of bodhisattvahood, in which wisdom was not replaced by knowledge, orvice versa, but the two were functionally interdependent in the structure of thebodhisattva’s awareness or in the activities of both the going aspect (ōsō) andthe returning aspect (gensō). In this connection, see D. T. Suzuki, “Reason andIntuition in Buddhist Philosophy,” in his Studies in Zen, pp. 85–128. In thistreatment, Suzuki emphasizes the dynamic nature of prajñā and the static andpassive nature of vijñāna, but fails to show a dialectical interplay of the twoin the structure of Buddhist awareness.167.

Whitehead is perhaps most vocal inrecognizing the metaphysical importance of the body. As he rightly observes,bodily participation is always implied in any human experience. For instance,although we do not usually say we see things with our eyes unless unusualcircumstances arise, it is a truism that we see things with our eyes. Modes ofThought, p. 156.

This was so, despite Dōgen’s discouragement ofrhetoric in his Zuimonki, as noted before.5. [chapter4.html#ch4_5] According to Katō Shūkō, Shōbōgenzō yōgo-sakuin, dōriappears 272 times and kotowari (which also means reason) 12 times—hence thetotal of 284 times in Shōbōgenzō.

Suzuki observes that the doctrine expounded inthe Laṅkāvatāra sūtra and the Avataṃsaka sūtra was mind-only (citta-mātra;yuishin) in contrast to the consciousnessonly (vijñāna-mātra; yuishiki) orrepresentation-only (vijñapti-mātra; yuishiki) of the Yogācāra school ofMahāyāna Buddhism. See Studies in the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra, p. 181 and pp. 279–82.On the other hand, mind-only (the Buddhist equivalent of idealism) could beinterpreted in such a way as to subsume under it the doctrine of “the tripleworld is mind-only” of the Avataṃsaka sūtra, the doctrine of “manifestation ofone’s own mind” (svacitta-dṛśya-mātra) of the Laṅkāvatāra sūtra, the doctrine ofthe original purity of mind (jishō-shōjōshin) of tathāgata-garbha thought, thedoctrine of the store-consciousness of the Yogācāra school, etc.18.

[chapter4.html#ch4_39] It is well known that Fa-tsang (643–712), the thirdancestor of the Chinese Hua-yen sect and a most important systematizer ofHua-yen philosophy, was the first to note the importance of the tathāgata-garbhatradition, along with the Mādhyamika and the Vijñānavāda school in IndianMahāyāna Buddhism. He regarded this tradition as central in his interpretationof Hua-yen idealism. See K. Kawada and H. Nakamura, eds., Kegon shisō, pp.279–81. In this connection, see Takahashi Jikidō’s article, “Kegon kyōgaku tonyorai-shisō—Indo ni okeru shōki-shisō no tenkai—,” ibid., pp. 277–332, whichdelineates the historical relationship between theTathāgatôtpattisaṃbhava-nirdeśa sūtra, one of the oldest independent sūtras,which was later incorporated into the Avataṃsaka sūtra, and various sūtras andtreatises of the tathāgata-garbha tradition, in the light of the idea of“manifestation of essence” (gotra-saṃbhava; shōki).40. [chapter4.html#ch4_40] Ibid., p. 280. Concerning the interpretations of thistenet by the Hua-yen thinkers, see Tamaki Kōshiro, “Yuishin no tsuikyū—shisō totaiken no kōshō—,” ibid., pp. 335–416.41.

[chapter4.html#ch4_43] Concerning Dōgen’s view of mind, see Akiyama Hanji,op. cit., pp. 85–105.44. [chapter4.html#ch4_44] Shōbōgenzō, “Sokushin-zebutsu,” “Shinjin-gakudō,”“Busshō,” “Sangai-yuishin,” etc. In addition he refers to mind in various ways:“walls, tiles, and stones” (“Sangai-yuishin,” “Kobutsushin”); “birth and death,coming and going” (“Sokushin-zebutsu,” “Sangaiyuishin”); “the skin, flesh,bones, and marrow” (“Sangai-yuishin”); “the three periods” (the variant chapterof “Shin-fukatoku”).45. [chapter4.html#ch4_45] Ibid., “Immo.”46. [chapter4.html#ch4_46] Ibid., “Immo.” Immediately after this, Dōgen alsocommented on the kōan in which, when two monastics were arguing about whether abanner moves or the wind moves, Hui-nêng observed that the mind moves. He madeessentially the same point as we have seen in the case of the bell. Warningagainst a subjectivistic interpretation, Dōgen interpreted Hui-nêng’s “the mindmoves” as meaning the movement of thusness that transcends the banner, the wind,and the mind—subject and object.47. [chapter4.html#ch4_47] Ibid., “Bendōwa.” Dōgen applied this view toDharma-nature and observed that Dharma-nature had to do with the flow of water,the growth and decay of trees, and the blooming of flowers and falling ofleaves.48. [chapter4.html#ch4_48] Ibid., “Sokushin-zebutsu.” See also “Bendōwa.”49. [chapter4.html#ch4_49] Ibid., “Busshō.”50. [chapter4.html#ch4_50] Ibid., “Bendōwa.”51. [chapter4.html#ch4_51] In this connection, Akiyama observes, in his op.cit., pp. 80–81, that Dōgen’s view of the nondualism of body and mind wasconnected with his repudiation of rebirth and the immortality of the soul. Thisobservation is correct, though there was, as Akiyama himself concedes, someminor evidence contrary to it. (We shall examine Dōgen’s view of moral causationand rebirth on a later occasion.) Dōgen’s assertion of the nondualism of bodyand mind, which was firmly grounded in the ideas of dependent origination andemptiness, did not necessarily exclude the possibility of some “ethereal” or“spiritual” mode of existence quite different from the present makeup of thehuman mind-body. However, such a mode of existence had to be interpreteddifferently from those interpretations given in the conventional doctrines ofrebirth/reincarnation and the immortality of the soul. But this problem was notDōgen’s focal concern.52. [chapter4.html#ch4_52] Shōbōgenzō, “Sesshin-sesshō.”53. [chapter4.html#ch4_53] Ibid., “Sesshin-sesshō.”54.

In Ui’sview, to construe the idea of dependent origination as a kind of causation washighly misleading. He thinks that the misplaced and exclusive emphasis of earlyBuddhism on moral causation (karma and rebirth), which influenced the subsequenthistory of Buddhist thought, was erroneous, and that the doctrine of karma andrebirth (rinne) was not a fact but a religious postulate and, therefore, shouldnot have been overly emphasized in Buddhism. What was pivotally important,according to Ui, was a religious discernment of dependent origination ratherthan a strictly moral causation. Ibid. pp. 87–103.66. [chapter4.html#ch4_66] Shōbōgenzō, “Shin-fukatoku” and its variant version.Dōgen criticized the assumption of an old woman who addressed a question toTê-shan Hsüan-chien (780/2–865) about a passage in the Diamond Sūtra: “The pastmind is unattainable, the present mind is unattainable, and the future mind isunattainable.” The old woman then asked Têshan: “Which mind would you nourishwith refreshments?”67.

[chapter4.html#ch4_69] In Buddhism, expressions such as ekō-henshō andkyakka-shōko, meaning “self-illumination” or “illuminate thy self,” arefrequently used. They are the Buddhist equivalents of the dictum “Know thyself.”70. [chapter4.html#ch4_70] Ibid., “Busshō.”71. [chapter4.html#ch4_71] The Buddhists adopted the idea of gotra (family,lineage, class, race, etc.) from Hinduism, but it was free from any implicationsof the caste system. However, as time went on, they were not always consistentwith the original spirit, as we see in the theory of the five groups. Har Dayalsays: “The Buddhist philosophers developed the theory of gotra in order toexplain why all persons do not try or desire to become bodhisattvas. ” TheBodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature, p. 53.72.

[chapter4.html#ch4_78] If we were forced to classify Dōgen’s religious andphilosophical position, panentheism might be the term we would have to choose.But even this term should be discreetly and judiciously used when we apply it toDōgen’s thought. Concerning panentheism, see C. Hartshorne and W. L. Reese,eds., Philosophers Speak of God, particularly pp. 1–25, pp. 499–514.79. [chapter4.html#ch4_79] Shōbōgenzō, “Busshō.”80. [chapter4.html#ch4_80] Ibid., “Sangai-yuishin.”81. [chapter4.html#ch4_81] See Okada Gihō, op. cit., vol. 2, pp. 156–58.82. [chapter4.html#ch4_82] Shōbōgenzō, “Sangai-yuishin.”83. [chapter4.html#ch4_83] Ibid., “Busshō.”84. [chapter4.html#ch4_84] In addition to his rejection of the theory of thefive groups (goshō), Dōgen did not subscribe literally to the theory of the sixrealms, which arranged sentient and insentient beings biocentrically oranthropocentrically in a hierarchical model, although he often used thistraditional theory as he did with respect to other traditional concepts. Dōgen’sreligious and philosophical thought as a whole was highly antagonistic to modelsof hierarchies, layers, levels, degrees, strata, etc., although this did notmean the denial of their limited usefulness and validity. Dōgen’s view ofsentient beings also differed from the so-called panpsychism; this is quiteclear from our expositions of mind and Buddha-nature.85. [chapter4.html#ch4_85] The living dynamism of the one-many relationship inconnection with Buddha-nature was discussed in his exposition of theocean-reflections samādhi (kaiin-zammai), in which Dōgen referred to Ts’ao-shanPên-chi’s kōan of the great sea that was said to neither “keep a corpse” nor“retain the expired.” More specifically, Dōgen referred to Ts’ao-shan’sstatement “[The sea] includes all existence” (hōgan-ban’u), and commented asfollows: “Teacher’s [Ts’ao-shan’s] ‘hōgan-ban’u’ signifies the sea. Its importdoes not imply that a person or a thing embraces all existence, but thatinclusion (hōgan) itself is all existence (ban’u). It does not mean the greatsea contains all existence; the great sea only embodiesinclusion-itself-is-all-existence … inclusion-itself-is-all-existence means thatinclusion includes inclusion-itself-is-all-existence (hōgan-u-hōgan-ban’u).”Ibid., “Kaiin-zammai.” The net result was: Inclusion included inclusion—atheoretical question was transformed into a soteriological realization withoutlosing its theoretical import.86.

[chapter4.html#ch4_90] Ibid., Sesshin-sesshō. Cf. ibid., “Busshō”: “Youshould always devote yourself to the way of the Buddha-nature of nonexistence.Do not recoil from it.” “At the initial stage of meeting Buddhas and hearingDharma, the most difficult thing to grasp and heed is the notion that sentientbeings are the Buddha-nature of nonexistence. While following a teacher orstudying the sūtras, this truth is a joyful thing to hear. Unless in yourlearning and apprehension you are thoroughly filled with the truth of all thesentient beings as the Buddha-nature of nonexistence, you have not yet learnedor apprehended Buddha-nature.… You must be aware that to understand and hear theBuddha-nature of nonexistence is the right path to becoming a Buddha.Consequently, at the very moment when the Buddha-nature of nonexistence isrealized, you attain Buddhahood. If you do not see, hear, or utter theBuddha-nature of nonexistence, you have not become a Buddha yet.”91. [chapter4.html#ch4_91] Ibid., “Busshō.”92. [chapter4.html#ch4_92] Ibid., “Busshō.”93. [chapter4.html#ch4_93] Ibid., “Busshō.” In the same chapter, Dōgen alsowrote: “Furthermore, to think that Buddha-nature exists only in life but not indeath is an opinion of little learning and superficial understanding. TheBuddha-nature of existence and the Buddha-nature of nonexistence are both inlife and in death. When you talk about the formation or nonformation of wind andfire [of the four elements], you are dealing with the formation or nonformationof Buddha-nature itself. Even the time of nonformation is Buddhanature asexistence and Buddha-nature as nonexistence. The time of formation isBuddha-nature as existence and Buddha-nature as nonexistence, as well. It isun-Buddhist to construe Buddha-nature as either existing or not existingaccording to whether it moves or not, or as spiritually working or not workingaccording to human consciousness or unconsciousness, or as mutable or immutableaccording to human knowing or not knowing.”94. [chapter4.html#ch4_94] Throughout the present work, I have belabored thispoint and will do so in subsequent pages. In reference specifically toemptiness, Dōgen wrote: “Inasmuch as the Buddhas and ancestors fulfill the Way,whereby it is authentically transmitted, the total being of theskin-flesh-bones-marrow is suspended in emptiness. Emptiness is not the kindthat is characterized by twenty-modes and the like. After all, should emptinesshave only twenty modes? It can have eighty-four thousand modes, and many more.”Ibid., “Kokū.”95. [chapter4.html#ch4_95] Ibid., “Kokū.”96. [chapter4.html#ch4_96] Ibid., “Kokū”97. [chapter4.html#ch4_97] Ibid., “Immo.”98.

[chapter4.html#ch4_104] Ibid., “Maka-hannya-haramitsu.” Also in the samechapter Dōgen said: “As this truth [of prajñā] unfolds and realizes itself, ittells us that form is emptiness, emptiness is form; form is form, emptiness isemptiness.”105. [chapter4.html#ch4_105] Abe Masao compares Dōgen’s view of the relationshipbetween all existence and Buddha-nature to Heidegger’s “ontological difference”(ontologische Differenz) between Being (Sein) and beings (Seiendes) and “onticdifference” (ontische Differenz) among beings, and denies ontological differencein Dōgen’s case. See “Dōgen on Buddha Nature,” The Eastern Buddhist, vol. 4, no.1 (May 1971), pp. 50–51. An opposite interpretation is presented by SugimoriMamoru, “Dōgen to Heidegger: Hosshō to sonzai—josetsu,” Risō, no. 369 (February1964), pp. 35–43.106. [chapter4.html#ch4_106] In Shōbōgenzō, “Busshō,” Dōgen discussed theseseven categories of Buddha-nature. For a general discussion of them, seeAkiyama, op. cit., pp. 101–43; Masunaga Reihō, “Dōgen’s Idea of Buddha-nature,”pp. 1–14; Abe, “Dōgen on Buddha Nature.”107.

[chapter4.html#ch4_119] Dōgen’s vision was extremely akin to Alfred N.Whitehead’s metaphysical vision of what he phrases as the “creative advance ofthe universe into novelty” from moment to moment which emerges from theinteraction of actualities. Unity in multiplicity in Whitehead’s vision is not astatic completed state of being but a dynamic process of becoming. Dōgen wouldhave concurred with Whitehead in this general metaphysical vision of theuniverse. See Whitehead, Process and Reality, passim.120. [chapter4.html#ch4_120] For example, Nakamura Hajime’s analysis of “thephenomenal world as absolute” in his Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples doesnot refer to this aspect, that is, the logic of negation, which is cruciallyimportant, especially in Dōgen’s thought. Cf. Yūki Sazuku, “Nihon Bukkyō norinri-sei,” in Miyamoto Shōson, ed., Bukkyō no kompon shinri, pp. 933–50; IenagaSaburō, Nihon shisō-shi ni okeru hitei no ronri no hattatsu.121. [chapter4.html#ch4_121] See Karaki Junzō, Chūsei no bungaku; Nishio Minoru,Nihon bungeishi ni okeru chūseiteki na mono. Karaki and Nishio are most vocal instressing Dōgen’s place in the history of Japanese literature. From thisstandpoint they appraise Dōgen’s use of Japanese in his writings.122. [chapter4.html#ch4_122] Karaki Junzō, Mujō, pp. 5–130. Karaki observes thathakanashi or hakanaki, etymologically speaking, had the meaning of the failureto “measure” the pace of environmental changes by certain standards or norms.The sense of transience, despair, and emptiness was intimately related to suchan “anomic” state of mind as well as the state of affairs.123.

[chapter4.html#ch4_124] A rather crude attempt at speculating on timeappeared in The Questions of King Milinda, II.2.9 and 3.1–2 in which thedistinction between the three periods and that between the “time which exists”and the “time which does not” were made. In this view, the root of timeconsisted in ignorance, and liberation evolved from “the time which exists” to“the time which does not.”125.

[chapter4.html#ch4_126] The distinction between kāla and samaya (both ofwhich meant time) and the Buddhist’s preference for the latter indicated thistypically Buddhistic sensibility very well.

[chapter4.html#ch4_154] Here we note a striking similarity between Dōgenand Heidegger, who maintains “the temporality of spatiality” in his Being andTime. Heidegger writes: “Because Dasein is ‘spiritual,’ and only because ofthis, it can be spatial in a way which remains essentially impossible for anyextended corporeal Thing.” Thus, “Dasein takes space in.” Ibid., p. 419.155. [chapter4.html#ch4_155] Takahashi, op. cit., pp. 287–92.156. [chapter4.html#ch4_156] Shōbōgenzō, “Uji.” In this translation I followTakahashi’s interpretation of ware as self rather than time. See op. cit., pp.278–81.157. [chapter4.html#ch4_157] The personal and existential emphasis of Dōgen’streatment is hinted at in Takahashi’s commentary on the “Uji” chapter (op. cit.,pp. 271–92) but not stressed as much as it should be. In this respect,Nakayama’s treatment (op. cit., pp. 167–79) does more justice to the intentionof Dōgen’s view of time.158. [chapter4.html#ch4_158] Shōbōgenzō, “Uji.”159. [chapter4.html#ch4_159] Ibid., “Uji.” Waga in this passage was interpretedas referring to existence-time by some and to the self by others. See Akiyama,op. cit., pp. 129–30; Takahashi, op. cit., pp. 335–38; Masunaga, Bukkyō ni okerujikanron, pp. 214–21.160. [chapter4.html#ch4_160] Shōbōgenzō, “Daigo.”161. [chapter4.html#ch4_161] Ibid., “Shukke-kudoku.” Dōgen used the conventionalfigures of setsuna and tanji but had no interest in speculating on the exactlength of these notions, as some earlier Buddhists did. In this connection, asingle thought (ichinen) was said to be equivalent to 1/60 or 1/400 tanji. As tothe Buddhist tenet of “everything perishes as soon as it arises,” see alsoibid., “Hotsu-bodaishin” and “Kaiin-zammai.”162. [chapter4.html#ch4_162] Ibid., “Gerjō-kōan.” Cf. ibid., “Den’e,” “Kūge,”“Sanjūshichihon-bodaibumpō,” “Juki,” etc. In his discussion of the notion ofarising and perishing (kimetsu), Dōgen wrote: “For this reason, arising andperishing mean that while the self arises in and of itself (ga-ga-ki) and theself perishes in and of itself (ga-ga-metsu), it never halts. This never-haltingshould be understood in such a way that arising or perishing is allowed to betotally arising or perishing (kareni ichinin shite).… Speaking of not-opposing(fusōtai) and not-anticipating (fusōtai), you should realize that arising isnothing but arising in its beginning, middle, and end. [As Yün-chü Tao-yingsaid,] officially not a single needle is admitted, but privately horses andvehicles pass through. In its beginning, middle, and end, it neither awaits norconfronts perishing. Even if Dharma arises abruptly after a preceding perishing,it is not the arising of [that preceding] perishing but an arising of Dharma.Because it is Dharma’s arising, it neither opposes nor anticipates anything(futaidaisō nari). Moreover, a perishing and another perishing do not expect oneanother nor stand in oppsition to one another. Perishing is nothing butperishing in its beginning, middle, and end as well.” Ibid., “Kaiin-zammai.”163. [chapter4.html#ch4_163] Ibid., “Shoaku-makusa.” Cf. “Gabyō,” “Genjō-kōan,”“Zazenshin.”164. [chapter4.html#ch4_164] Ibid., “Genjō-kōan.” This could be compared withHua-yen’s “mystery of the coexistence of concealment and disclosure”(ommitsu-kenryō-kujō-mon). On this particular “mystery,” see Chang, op. cit.,pp. 162–64.165. [chapter4.html#ch4_165] Shōbōgenzō, “Zenki.”166. [chapter4.html#ch4_166] The primacy of discontinuity is well emphasized byTakahashi, op. cit., following the tradition of Nishiari Bokusan’s Keiteki, awell-known and important commentary on Dōgen’s Shōbōgenzō. This position ishighly critical of those taken by Tanabe Hajime, Hashida Kunihiko, and otherphilosophers, who would see Dōgen’s view of time primarily in terms of time andeternity—in which case continuity becomes primary.167. [chapter4.html#ch4_167] Shōbōgenzō “Uji.”168. [chapter4.html#ch4_168] Ibid., “Uji.” See Takahashi, op. cit., p. 357 andpp. 353–54 on Dōgen’s special use of the word “obstruction” in this instance.169. [chapter4.html#ch4_169] This is one way to convey Dōgen’s intention inEnglish. But this is only an approximation, which I think is very useful. Thusany noun can be converted into a verb form, and we can say, for example: “Eatingeats eating, and thereby eating realizes itself ” (in which the single activityof eating exerts itself totally to such an extent that the eating subject andimmediate environment—certainly the whole universe—are “darkened,” yet embodiedin and through it by virtue of their mutual identity and mutual penetration).Similarly, “Dōgen dōgen-s Dōgen, and thereby Dōgen realizes himself,” and soforth. In this way, the subject and the predicate interpenetrate one another inactivity, and thus: “Activity acts activity, and thereby activity realizesitself.” Paradoxically, obstruction in Dōgen’s thought meant total freedom inthe nonobstruction of self-obstruction.170. [chapter4.html#ch4_170] Shōbōgenzō, “Uji.”171. [chapter4.html#ch4_171] Ibid., “Uji.”172. [chapter4.html#ch4_172] Inasmuch as the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka sūtra and itscentral doctrine of “all things themselves are ultimate reality” (shohō-jissō)occupied a crucially important place in Dōgen’s thought in general, we can claima direct affinity of his theory of time with that, as Takahashi does. But asTakahashi himself concedes, we cannot deny an intimate relationship betweenDōgen’s view of time and Hua-yen philosophy. See Takahashi, op. cit., pp. 5–69,especially p. 69, note 2.173.

[chapter4.html#ch4_184] Regarding the relationship between time andactivity, I am indebted to Nakayama, op. cit., pp. 172–79 for his insights intothe matter. However, the following exposition of mine is based on a differentperspective than that of Nakayama.185. [chapter4.html#ch4_185] Shōbōgenzō, “Gyōji.”186. [chapter4.html#ch4_186] Ibid., “Gyōji.”187.

[chapter4.html#ch4_189] Thus for example, the “Shōji” chapter, which had astriking affinity to Pure Realm thought, was construed by some as spurious, oras Dōgen’s instruction intended for Pure Realm Buddhists. See The EasternBuddhist, vol. 5, no. 1 (May 1972), pp. 79–80, note 7.190. [chapter4.html#ch4_190] Shōbōgenzō, “Shoaku-makusa.”191. [chapter4.html#ch4_191] Ibid., “Yuibutsu-yobutsu.”192.

[chapter4.html#ch4_199] This point may be clarified by considering MartinBuber’s criticism of Heidegger’s anthropology. See Buber, Between Man and Man,pp. 163–81. Buber says that Heidegger’s view of human existence, despite itsemphasis on existence in the world, is based on one’s relation to oneself; one’srelation to other selves is regarded solely as derivative from thisindividualistic conception of human existence. Heidegger’s human existence isessentially “monological.” In Buber’s view, the essential nature of the self isderived from its embeddedness in the matrix of communal selves. We are born notonly into the world but with the world. Being is essentially social and onlyexistentially individual, not vice versa.200. [chapter4.html#ch4_200] Shōbōgenzō, “Shōji.”201. [chapter4.html#ch4_201] Ienaga Saburō considers one of the lastingcontributions of Pure Realm Buddhism, especially of Shinran, to have been aprofound sense of sinfulness, and thinks that hope for Buddhism in the futurelies in the cultivation of this sensibility. Chūsei Bukkyō shisō-shi kenkyū, pp.230–32.202. [chapter4.html#ch4_202] Shōbōgenzō, “Busshō.”203. [chapter4.html#ch4_203] To translate zenki into English is a difficulttask. Waddell and Abe translate it as “total dynamic working,” and alsooccasionally, as “total dynamism.” See The Eastern Buddhist, vol. 5, no. 1 (May1972), pp. 70–80. I would like to translate zenki variously as “total dynamism,”“total function,” “total working,” and so forth.204. [chapter4.html#ch4_204] Shōbōgenzō, “Zenki.”205. [chapter4.html#ch4_205] In this connection, it is significant to observewhat A. N. Whitehead says in a surprisingly similar vein: “Each task of creationis a social effort, employing the whole universe.” Process and Reality, p. 340.He also writes: “The whole world conspires to produce a new creation.” Religionin the Making, p. 99.206.

Ch’en, Buddhism in China, pp. 241–57as regards the socioeconomic background of the Buddhist monastic order ingeneral in those days.3. [chapter5.html#ch5_3] Ui, op. cit., pp. 81–90.4. [chapter5.html#ch5_4] Ui, Zenshū shisō-shi, vol. 2, pp. 327–423; idem, Bukkyōshisō kenkyū, pp. 628–45.5. [chapter5.html#ch5_5] Hīnayāna Buddhism had the two divisions of the vinaya:one was the division of the inhibition of evil (shiaku-mon), and the other thedivision of the promotion of good (sazenmon). The former consisted of theso-called precepts of seven types of Buddhists (shichishu-kai), that is, theprecepts of monks, nuns, women who observed the six precepts, male novices,female novices, laymen, and laywomen. The latter ( the division of the promotionof good) consisted of such ritual observances as receiving the precepts,uposatha (fusatsu), and monastic retreats. By contrast, the Mahāyāna counterpartof the vinaya was comprised of the ten major precepts (jū jūkinkai) and theforty-eight minor precepts (shijūhachi kyōkai) and included virtually nothing inthe area of the promotion of good. Po-chang’s contribution to the Mahāyānadivision of the promotion of good in the total structure of monastic disciplinemust be appreciated. See Ui, Zenshū shisō-shi, vol. 2, pp. 390–93.6. [chapter5.html#ch5_6] Zuimonki, II:1.7. [chapter5.html#ch5_7] Concerning the differences between pure Zen and mixedZen, see Imaeda Aishin, Zenshū no rekishi, chapters 2 [chapter2.html], 3[chapter3.html], and 4 [chapter4.html].8. [chapter5.html#ch5_8] Zuimonki, II:26.9. [chapter5.html#ch5_9] Furuta Shōkin, in his Nihon Bukkyō shisō-shi noshomondai, analyzes these two trends in Kamakura Buddhism. Furuta observes thatHōnen’s thought on this matter was only apparently opposed to the traditionalobservance of the precepts as the path of sages (shōdōmon). Hōnen’s famousstatement “In the Age of Degenerate Law there is neither the observance ofprecepts nor the violation of precepts,” according to Furuta, implied that hisnondualistic conception of the precepts—which transcended observance andviolation—was subsumed in the sole act of the recitation of the holy name ofAmida (shōmyō-nembutsu). See ibid., pp. 3–17.10. [chapter5.html#ch5_10] Ibid., pp. 18–35 concerning Eisai’s view on theprecepts. Eisai once wrote: “Zen Buddhism has the precepts as its beginning andmeditation as its goal” (Kōzen gokokuron). Compare this with Dōgen’srecollection of the Kenninji temple when he studied there prior to his study inChina, in Zuimonki, V:10.11. [chapter5.html#ch5_11] See Furuta, op. cit., pp. 36–56.12. [chapter5.html#ch5_12] In those days Zen was largely dependent on Tendai andShingon Buddhism and was content with reinforcing the established order of theold Buddhism. See Imaeda, op. cit., p. 14.13.

Shinran’s view of the “rightlyestablished state” (shōjōju) in which all the followers of the eighteenth vow ofAmida were supposed to reside, and by virtue of which they were assured of thebirth in the Pure Land and of the realization of enlightenment in theafter-life. See Kyōgyō-shinshō, IV. This notion, together with his denial of theesoteric Buddhist doctrine of “This body itself is Buddha” (sokushinjōbutsu) inTannishō, XV, showed that there was a significant difference between Shinran andDōgen in their treatments of the defiled land and the Pure Land.20.

[chapter5.html#ch5_25] As for the theme of purification, see Proceedings ofthe XIth International Congress of the International Association for the Historyof Religions. Particularly, Abe Masao’s statement: “There is no ‘being pure’apart from ‘becoming pure’ ” (ibid., p. 150), which reflects Dōgen’s view well.26. [chapter5.html#ch5_26] Shōbōgenzō, “Senjō.”27. [chapter5.html#ch5_27] Ibid., “Senjō.”28. [chapter5.html#ch5_28] Dōgen expounded the chapter in 1239, 1243, and 1250.In addition to this chapter, Dōgen presented “Daigo” on two occasions in 1242and 1244. See Okada, Shōbōgenzō shisō taikei, vol. 6, p. 340.29. [chapter5.html#ch5_29] Besides these two meals, monastics were allowed totake the “evening meal,” usually gruel, only in the snowy winter season.Strictly speaking, this practice was a deviation from the Buddhist vow not toeat after midday. See Eiheiji koku-shijimon.30. [chapter5.html#ch5_30] Zuimonki, I:3.31. [chapter5.html#ch5_31] Ibid., VI:25. In Chiji shingi Dōgen referred to thetraditional Buddhist notions of “four impure foods” and “five improper means oflivelihood.” The former were: (1) food obtained by going only among the rich andthe powerful families, (2) food obtained by means of divination andfortune-telling, (3) food obtained by means of astrological practices, and (4)food obtained by means of land cultivation and selling medicines (instead ofgoing for alms). The latter (five improper means of livelihood) were: (1) toassume different appearance, (2) to boast of one’s own merits, (3) to engage infortune-telling and divination, (4) to harass and bully others, and (5) tospread the news of alms and offerings. Dōgen gave strict regulations for theadministration of public grain (kugaimai) in Eiheiji kuin seiki.32. [chapter5.html#ch5_32] Takeuchi conjectures that the monastic economy of theEiheiji temple must have been in very straitened circumstances. See his Dōgen,pp. 295–97; Ōkubo Dōshū, Dōgenzenji-den no kenkyū, chapter 9.33. [chapter5.html#ch5_33] In his Tenzo kyōkun, note Dōgen’s severe criticism ofthe Japanese monastics as well as his high praise for the Chinese counterparts,with respect to the status and functions of the chief cook in their monasticlife.34.

[chapter5.html#ch5_52] The twelvefold practice of asceticism (dvādaśadhūtaguṇāh; jūni-zudagyō) was meant to purify one’s body and mind by shaking offall forms of attachment to clothes, food, and dwelling. They were: (1) dwellingin the forest, (2) taking any seat that might be offered, (3) living on alms,(4) observing the rule of using only one seat for meditation and eating, (5)wearing coarse garments, (6) not eating after the time when one should ceaseeating, (7) wearing clothes made of rags taken from a dust heap, (8) having onlythree robes, (9) living in or near a cemetery, (10) living under a tree, (11)living in the open air, and (12) using the sitting posture for sleeping.

[chapter5.html#ch5_97] Hori Ichirō discusses the significance of mountainsin the history of Japanese religion in his Folk Religion in Japan, chapter 4[chapter4.html]. Dōgen’s fascination with the mountains and waters was not justwhat he inherited from Ju-ching but was deeply rooted in Japanese culture,although his view was, as we have seen in this study, mediated by the logic ofBuddha-nature and emptiness.98. [chapter5.html#ch5_98] The vows, or “original vows” (pūrva-praṇidhāna;hongan), were classified traditionally in two categories: (I) The universal vows(sōgan) were applicable to all bodhisattvas universally and formulated in theform of the “four universal vows” (shi-guzeigan). The original form of the fouruniversal vows appeared in the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka sūtra. And (2) the specialvows (betsugan) were various formulations particular to different Buddhas andbodhisattvas—e.g., Amitābha’s forty-eight vows, Bhaiśajyaguru’s twelve vows,Samantabhadra’s ten vows.99. [chapter5.html#ch5_99] Shōbōgenzō, “Busso” and “Hotsu-bodaishin.” Thetwenty-eight Indian ancestors were called “great superiors” (dai-oshō), whereasthe six Chinese ancestors were called “ancestral teachers” (soshi).100. [chapter5.html#ch5_100] The fifty-two stages of bodhisattvahood consistedof (I) the ten stages of faith (jusshin), (2) the ten stages of security (jūjū),(3) the ten stages of practice (jūgyō), (4) the ten stages of devotion (jūekō),(5) the ten stages of development (jūji), (6) the stage of approachingbodhisattvahood (tōgaku), and (7) the stage of Buddhahood (myōgaku).101.

The four virtues underinvestigation belonged to (1) of this classification. See Dayal, op. cit., pp.251–69.118.

[chapter5.html#ch5_131] The term Hīnayāna here and elsewhere in this workis employed advisedly. As it is widely known today, the term has been used bysome Mahāyāna Buddhists with pejorative connotations to designate SouthernBuddhism or Theravāda Buddhism in the Southeast Asian countries. On the otherhand, Mahāyāna Buddhists also used the term to designate all early Buddhistschools and sects other than the Mahāyāna. It was accordingly much broader thanthe term Theravāda Buddhism.132.

Suzuki, Manual of Zen Buddhism, p. 13.137. [chapter5.html#ch5_137] The problem of confession has occupied a veryimportant place in Buddhism from its inception. Ordinary confession (sange orkeka) could be made at any time, as it was required, whereas uposatha (fusatsu)was held every fifteen days and a confessional (pavāraṇa; jishi) was held at theend of the monastic retreat (ango). As regards the practice of these rites invarious Japanese Buddhist sects, see M. W. de Visser, Ancient Buddhism in Japan,2 volumes. Heinrich Dumoulin discusses this problem in connection with ZenBuddhism in his essay “Technique and Personal Devotion in the Zen Exercise,” inJoseph Roggendorf, ed., Studies in Japanese Culture, pp. 17–40.138. [chapter5.html#ch5_138] Shōbōgenzō, “Keisei-sanshoku.”139. [chapter5.html#ch5_139] Ibid., “Keisei-sanshoku.”140. [chapter5.html#ch5_140] Dumoulin makes the following observation ofcontemporary Zen: “In the commonly accepted classification of Buddhism, Zen isplaced in the category of those sects that insist on salvation through ‘one’sown endeavor’ (jiriki) while other schools, especially the Amidists, rely on‘another’s strength’ (tariki). Zen is thus defined because of its consistentlymonistic illuminationism. That is, at any rate, the impression received frommuch of the literature about Zen. Suzuki Daisetsu, for example, likes to recountthe anecdotes of ancient Zen masters who would burn Buddha images or sūtrascrolls in order to demonstrate dramatically that the Buddha was not to besought outside but within the heart. In reality, such episodes are not much more[than] exceptional cases; they do not permit the conclusion that Zen is ineffect iconoclastic or opposed to sacred cult. No Zen master has, in the finalanalysis, reneged on the radical monism of Zen metaphysics. Nevertheless, theactual atmosphere of many Zen monasteries is characterized by a devotionalreverence comparable to that of Amida temples.” Roggendorf, op. cit., p. 30.Dumoulin’s interpretation of Zen as “monistic illuminationism” or “radicalmonism” can be challenged. Without subscribing to this we can appreciate thisnoteworthy antidote to the currently much misunderstood picture of Zen.141. [chapter5.html#ch5_141] Shōbōgenzō, “Keisei-sanshoku.” There were two typesof confession: repentance with regard to the facts of existence (jisan or ji nosange) such as sins, ambiguities, and frailties, and repentance with regard tothe nature of the facts of existence (risan or ri no sange), namely, that sins,ambiguities, and frailties were originally and ultimately empty.142. [chapter5.html#ch5_142] Cf. Ui Hakuju, Bukkyō tetsugaku no kompon mondai,pp. 1–35. Ui points out that when the Buddhist spoke of the law of causation, itwas primarily the law of moral causation; although the law of physicalcausation—a predominant concern on the part of Western philosophers andscientists—was implied, but generally receded into the background. Dōgen’s viewreflected this traditional view. In this study “causation” refers to the law ofmoral causation.143. [chapter5.html#ch5_143] Shōbōgenzō, “Daishugyō” and “Jinshin-inga”; Dōgenoshō kōroku, I and III.144. [chapter5.html#ch5_144] Shōbōgenzō, “Jinshin-inga.”145.

[chapter5.html#ch5_174] This is similar to “presuming upon Amida’s originalvow” (hongan-bokori) to which Shinran referred in his Tannishō, XIII.175. [chapter5.html#ch5_175] Shōbōgenzō, “Shoaku-makusa.”176. [chapter5.html#ch5_176] Ibid., “Shoaku-makusa.”177. [chapter5.html#ch5_177] Zuimonki, II:4. The kōan ran as follows: Once, whenthe monastics of the western and eastern halls were quarrelling about a cat,Nan-ch’üan, holding up the cat, said, “You monastics! If any of you can speak aword of Zen I will spare the cat, otherwise I will kill it!” No one couldanswer, so Nan-ch’üan killed it. In the evening, Chao-chou came back fromsomewhere, and Nan-ch’üan told him what had happened. Chao-chou thereupon tookoff his shoe, put it on his head, and walked off. Nan-ch’üan said, “If only youhad been there, I could have saved the cat!” Adapted from R. H. Blyth’stranslation in his Mumonkan (Zen and Zen Classics, vol. 4), pp. 120–21. Dōgen inhis comments held that it was better not to kill the cat as a way of leadingmonastics to enlightenment.178. [chapter5.html#ch5_178] Zuimonki, II:4.179. [chapter5.html#ch5_179] Shōbōgenzō, “Shoaku-makusa.”180. [chapter5.html#ch5_180] Ibid., “Shoaku-makusa.”181. [chapter5.html#ch5_181] D. T. Suzuki once said: “Zen finds its inevitableassociation with art but not with morality. Zen may remain unmoral but notwithout art.” Zen and Japanese Culture, p. 27. Suzuki here may not be assertinga downright antinomianism, yet comes very close to it. From Dōgen’s standpointwhat Suzuki has to say characterizes the transmoral aspect of enlightenment buthardly, if at all, the moral expression of it. Morality is to be liberated, notbelittled, much less abandoned.182. [chapter5.html#ch5_182] At this point Dōgen’s thought was almostindistinguishable from Shinran’s, that envisioned “naturalness” (jinen-hōni) asits culmination in his Mattōshō, Jinen-hōni-shō, and so forth. Naturalness heremeant the spontaneous unfolding of Amida’s vowpower without human calculation orcontrivance. This was also called the “reason of no reason” (mugi o motte gi tosu or gi naki o gi to su)—which referred to the transcendent rationality ofeffortlessness, meaninglessness, purposelessness—the reason of nonduality. Cf.Tannishō, VIII.183. [chapter5.html#ch5_183] Shōbōgenzō, “Shoaku-makusa.”184. [chapter5.html#ch5_184] Ibid., “Shoaku-makusa.”185. [chapter5.html#ch5_185] Ibid., “Shoaku-makusa.”186. [chapter5.html#ch5_186] Ibid., “Sanjūshichihon-bodaibumpō.” The four rightefforts were a part of the thirtyseven qualities of enlightment (saptatriṃśadbodhipākṣikā dharmāḥ; sanjūshichihonbodaibumpō), which were very important,along with the ten perfections, in the total scheme of the bodhisattva’s career.See Dayal, op. cit., pp. 80–164 concerning the thirtyseven qualities.187. [chapter5.html#ch5_187] Shōbōgenzō, “Hosshō.” The idea of “naturalknowledge” was mentioned by Confucius in his Analects, XVI:9, which read:“Confucius said, ‘Those who are born with knowledge are the highest type ofpeople. Those who learn through study are the next. Those who learn through hardwork are still next. Those who work hard and still do not learn are really thelowest type.’ ”188. [chapter5.html#ch5_188] Shōbōgenzō, “Hosshō” and “Daigo.” In “Daigo” Dōgenwrote: “Therefore, you should realize that there is not a single sentient orinsentient being that is incapable of natural knowing. Where there is naturalknowing, there is natural enlightenment, natural verification, and naturalpractice.”189.

Hiei and Mt. Kōya,respectively, in contrast to Nara Buddhism, the activities of which centeredaround the city of Nara. This meant, according to Karasawa, an emphasis onmonastic discipline rather than doctrinal theorization, avoidance of politicsand other-worldly involvement, and the formation of an ideal Buddhist community.197.

[chapter5.html#ch5_201] The Socratic dialogue attempted to attainuniversalistic definitions of ideas such as “justice,” “courage,” and “love”through its dialectical progression, as we see in Platonic dialogues. Bycontrast, the Zen dialogue (mondō; literally, “question and answer”) always tookplace in the existential situation of personal encounter between teacher anddisciple (kien), who together endeavored to attain enlightenment. This was asoteriological concern. And yet, it is highly significant that both traditionsemployed dialogue as a pedagogic method for the discovery and realization oftruth.202. [chapter5.html#ch5_202] Shōbōgenzō, “Menju,” where this analogy was appliedto the direct transmission of Dharma through the personal encounter of teacherand disciple.
