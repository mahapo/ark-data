He was a master of the ten fields of classical knowledge. Withgreat confidence, respect, and pure vision in the Dharma, he studied,contemplated, cultivated, mastered, and applied the teachings of allschools of Buddhism. In particular, he had a special aptitude for com-mentary and writing.In his day, many of the instructions for spiritual maturation andliberation were rarely practiced, widely scattered, and close to ex-tinction. With his special abilities, he collected these rare and fragiletransmissions into what are now known as The Five Great Treasuries, acollection of more than a hundred volumes.Of these, the treasury called The Encompassment of All Knowledgediscusses the path to freedom, describing the three disciplines of eth-ics, contemplation, and wisdom. It covers the Buddha’s teachings fromthe sutras and tantras, the main commentarial traditions and essen-tial instructions along with such traditional subjects of learning asmedicine, art, and linguistics.

The text explains the process whereby teachers and disciplesestablish and cultivate a proper spiritual relationship, which, once ithas been established, provides a foundation from which teachers canexpound the Buddha’s doctrine and disciples can receive the teach-ings. The author then provides a detailed description of the three majorsystems of ethics, or vows, within the Buddhist tradition.In Buddhism, vows are viewed in many ways, depending onthe context of the discussion, but generally the ethical systems aredesignated as three sets of vows, as two sets of vows, or as one all-inclusive vow. The three sets of vows spoken of throughout alldivisions of the Buddhist scriptures are those of personal liberation(pr›timok ̋a), of meditative absorption (dhy›na), and of the uncontami-nated (an›srava) vows. These are essentially identical to the three formsof training on the Buddhist path: the development of morality, medi-tation, and wisdom. In fact, in order to gain the different types ofenlightenment of their systems, proclaimers (Ÿr›vaka), solitary sages(pratyekabuddha), and bodhisattvas must forsake disturbing emotionsand other obstacles on their paths by cultivating an uncontaminateddiscriminative awareness which is developed by training in wisdom."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 Buddhist EthicsThis discriminative awareness is grounded in mental quiescenceachieved by training in meditation, and mental quiescence is devel-oped on the basis of training in pure morality.The proclaimers’ system speaks of two sets of ethics, each withthree vows: the vows of a lay practitioner, novice, and monk (or nun);and the vows of body, speech, and mind. The three vows in the scrip-tures of the Universal Way (mah›y›na) refer to the processes of re-fraining from the unwholesome, of aiming at acquiring good quali-ties, and of working for the benefit of all living beings. These are alsoknown as the three trainings, or ethics, of the bodhisattva.The tantras speak of four sets of ethics, each with three vows. Thefirst set includes the commitments of awakening mind, the vows re-lated to the creation phase, and those related to the completion phase.The second set includes the pledges of the Buddha’s body, speech,and mind. The third set, as taught by the great adept Vitapada, con-sists in not conforming to the practice of accepting what is good andrejecting what is bad with respect to any physical, verbal, or mentalaction. The fourth set includes the vows of personal liberation, thebodhisattva commitments, and the pledges of the awareness holder(vidy›dhara).The tantras also speak of two types of ethics: the common pledgesreceived during the vase initiation of the five awarenesses (of the vase)and the stages of the initiation prior to these; and the uncommon onesreceived at the time of the irreversible vajra-master initiation. Accord-ing to a different explanation, the two types of ethics in the tantrasrefer to the vows related to the creation phase and those related to thecompletion phase, also known as the outer and inner vows. More-over, when the tantric adept assumes all the vows of personal libera-tion, the bodhisattva commitments, and the tantric pledges, he or shemaintains these ethics in both their outer and inner aspects.All of these systems of ethics in the Buddhist tradition, whetherpresented in a threefold or twofold form, were proclaimed by theBuddha to be contained in a single system of ethics: that of the Per-fection of Wisdom. This is clearly stated in the Condensed Perfection ofWisdom Discourse:Just as the rays of the sun radiating through spaceDispel all obscurity throughout the firmament,The Perfection of Wisdom outshines the other perfectionsAll of which are its precepts and are included within it."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction 11Can we call the Perfection of Wisdom a vow or ethic? The answer isfound in the same scripture:Our Guide taught that it is the lack of clinging to [the concept of]vow or no vowThat is the true vow or ethic.Among these various classifications of vows, the three vows thatare the subject of this particular work of Kongtrul are the vows ofpersonal liberation (pr›timok ̋a), of awakening mind (bodhicitta), and ofthe awareness holder (vidy›dhara). These three vows, or systems ofethics, embrace all forms of spiritual practice set forth in the Bud-dhist doctrine. Their integrated presentation is nonetheless found onlyin the Way of Secret Mantra. The higher ethics of the bodhisattva andthe awareness holder are prescribed in the ways of neither theproclaimers nor the solitary sages, since followers of these ways be-lieve them to be unnecessary for the attainment of their goal of en-lightenment. Indispensable to the proclaimers and solitary sages arethe personal liberation vows, on the basis of which, once trainees havedeveloped the intention to attain enlightenment, they cultivate men-tal quiescence and insight and thereby reach their goal.The awareness holders’ ethics are not prescribed in the Way of thePerfections, the path followed by bodhisattvas. Trainees on that pathdo not disregard the personal liberation vows, however, even thoughunsurpassable enlightenment can be achieved on the basis of thebodhisattvas’ commitment alone. Personal liberation vows mustdefinitely be assumed by bodhisattvas in training, but these vowsare enhanced by the altruistic awakening mind characteristic of theUniversal Way.According to the Way of Secret Mantra, the tantric vows are crucialto the attainment of unsurpassable enlightenment, but a yogin mustalso assume the bodhisattva and personal liberation vows. Therefore,the tantras instruct practitioners to safeguard all three forms of eth-ics. In fact, the preliminary rite for a tantric initiation includes proce-dures for the conferral of the personal liberation and bodhisattva vows,while the main part of the initiation includes the conferral of the tantricvows. Moreover, prior to engaging in the phases of creation andcompletion (the main aspects of tantric observance), the practitionermust affirm the personal liberation and bodhisattva vows. While con-tinuously striving to avoid root infractions of the tantric vows, the yoginmust also safeguard the personal liberation and bodhisattva ethics."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 Buddhist EthicsTo understand the importance of the three forms of ethics on thetantric path, it should be noted that most of the mandala rituals in-clude specific procedures for assuming the three vows. When dis-ciples make a petition in order to receive the vows, with the words“Bestow on me the pledges...,” they are requesting the tantric vows.With the words “Bestow on me also awakening mind...,” they arerequesting the bodhisattva commitments. With the words “Bestowon me also refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha...,” they arerequesting the vows of personal liberation. The three vows are actu-ally assumed as the initiating master proclaims first the tantric vows,as is stated in Indestructible Peak, with the words “The pledges of thefive families...”; then the bodhisattva vows with the words “In addi-tion, the other fourteen...”; and the personal liberation vows with thewords “You should not kill living creatures....”The Ritual of Confession provides clear evidence that the two lowerforms of ethics must precede the main part of the tantric path, whichconsists of the phases of creation and completion. One of the majortantric vows is not to “transgress the Buddha’s word”; this pledgeaddresses the necessity of safeguarding the vows of the two lowersystems of ethics as well as the tantric ones. That a yogin must followall three ethics is also stated by Sakya Pandita, the master of thedoctrine:[First one] searches for a spiritual masterAnd then receives the four initiations.One thereby becomes a possessor of the three vows.andEndowed with the three vowsAnd the knowledge of the profound points of the two phases....All of the different forms of spiritual practice taught by the Buddhaare encompassed by the three vows: the discipline (vinaya) and thecommon doctrine constitute the training undergone by the proclaimers;the perfections (p›ramit›) and the common doctrine, the training ofbodhisattvas; and the uncommon doctrine, the training undergoneby followers of the tantra, or Indestructible Way. The proclaimers’training is summarized in the following citation from the PersonalLiberation Discourse:Do not do any evil,Engage in excellent virtue,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction 13And tame your mind:This is the doctrine of the Buddha.Here, the trainee first assumes the ethics of renouncing harm to oth-ers and the basis of harm, thereby conforming to virtue and rejectingevil. The proclaimers’ training pertains to the ethics of personal lib-eration inasmuch as these ethics are defined as the forsaking of in-jury to others, along with the basis of injury.The bodhisattvas’ training is summarized in this citation from theIndestructible Tent:Contemplation of the mindAs the indivisibility of emptiness and compassionIs the supreme doctrine of the Buddha,Of the Dharma, and of the Sangha.The bodhisattva first develops compassion and then, using skillfulmeans to realize perfect enlightenment, merges the relative awaken-ing mind with the understanding of emptiness. This method pertainsto the bodhisattvas’ ethics inasmuch as the bodhisattvas’ ethics aredefined as the special factor that makes it possible to achieve perfectenlightenment.The tantric training is encapsulated in the Indestructible Peak:The ripening [initiation] and the liberative path are the supremedoctrine of enlightenment of the Buddha.Tantric training falls into two classes: the ripening initiation, whichplants a seed in the disciple in order to consecrate ordinary body,speech, and mind as inseparable from and unified with Vajradhara’sbody, speech, and mind; and the liberative path, which graduallybrings that inseparability to an apex. These two pertain to tantric eth-ics inasmuch as tantric ethics are defined as the ripening and liberativeaspects.I will now mention a few points about each of these three systems.First, the personal liberation vows are defined as the intention, at-tended by correlated mental factors and grounded in an attitude ofrenunciation, to forsake both harming others and the basis of harm. Ifvows lack an underlying motivation of renunciation, they are not truepersonal liberation vows. Vows assumed with the desire to gain adivine or human condition in the next life are known as a “wish toexcel,” and ethics maintained out of fear of punishment, sicknesses,demonic forces, and other problems of this life are known as “ethics"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 Buddhist Ethicsto protect one from fear.” These are not the ethics of personal libera-tion, because they lack the spirit that renounces the cycle of existence.Does this mean that followers of other religions lack correct moral-ity? The answer is found in Vasubandhu’s own Commentary on theTreasury of Phenomenology:Others do have a valid morality. However, their morality is notequal to the ethics of personal liberation, because it is bound toconditioned existence and does not lift one eternally from whatis unwholesome.In the preceding definition of the personal liberation vow, “harmingothers” refers to the seven unwholesome acts of body and speech(killing, stealing, etc.). “Basis of harm” denotes unwholesome mentalstates (covetousness, malice, and bad views) that underlie physicalunwholesome acts. Thus, although there are seven classes of personalliberation vows, all of them consist in forsaking the ten unvirtuousacts. Many Tibetan scholars, such as the patriarchs of the Sakyas aswell as Chim Namka Drak, the Great Translator Pang, Butön, andKongtrul, agree in defining the personal liberation vows in this way.The meaning of “intention attended by correlated mental factors” isexplained in the Compendium of Phenomenology:When a particular virtue is present, other factors such as inten-tion, attentiveness, or discriminative awareness will accompanyit. The predominant factor among these will become the natureof that virtue. As a consequence, the other concomitant mentalfactors will also turn into the same nature. In this context [of per-sonal liberation], the main factor is intention, but attendant mentalfactors also become the vow.Does this imply that while a monk is sound asleep or experiencingviolent hatred or absorbed in the state in which [his discrimination]is interrupted, he does not have vows? The Analysts (vaibh› ̋ika) as-sert that the vows are form in order to avoid such a conclusion. TheCompendium of Phenomenology says, however:The assertion that the vows exist as a potential is indeed the cor-rect one. Just as a man still owns money that he has lent to an-other with interest even though he does not actually have it inhand, [a monk] who has assumed vows through the necessaryconditions still holds these vows as long as he does not give themup, even though the vows may not be manifest at a particular time.Personal liberation is of two types: that of the proclaimers and that ofthe universalists. These types are differentiated with respect to their"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 15focus or goal, that of the first being the attainment of a lesser form ofenlightenment for the sake of oneself alone; that of the second, perfectenlightenment for the sake of all living creatures. Personal liberationvows may be received in the proclaimers’ ceremony, the universal-ists’ ceremony, or a tantric initiation; therefore, the glorious Sakyapatriarchs have declared that the personal liberation vows permeateall three sets of vows.Second, the ethics of awakening mind of the Universal Way aredefined as the special factor for the accomplishment of perfect en-lightenment. In terms of focus, there are two awakening minds: oneis the simple aspiration to be awakened; the other, the mind that ven-tures to awaken. As for its nature, awakening mind has both an ulti-mate aspect and a relative one. Awakening mind correlated with thestages of demarcation of the path yields an awakening mind basedon appreciation, an awakening mind of noblest intention, an awak-ening mind fully matured, and an awakening mind that has forsakenall impediments. Furthermore, twenty-two types of awakening mindare described by examples or metaphors, from “earth-like” up to“cloud-like.”Some scholars assert that the awakening mind of a bodhisattva stillon the worldly path is the simple aspiration to awaken and that thisaspiration turns into the “venturing mind” once the bodhisattva hasgained the first stage of awakening. That is not the case, however, sinceShantideva’s Compendium of Trainings states that the commitment ofthe venturing mind may be formed by ordinary persons who have notattained a stage of awakening. Other scholars believe that the aspiringmind does not involve a commitment. To sustain their view, they citethe following passage from Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life:Although the mind that aspires to awakenYields great fruits in cyclic existence,An uninterrupted flow of merit does not ensueAs it does with the venturing mind.This passage, however, does not imply that the aspiring mind has nocommitment; it refers to the simple aspiration unheld or unattendedby the vow.The Sakya patriarchs speak of three aspects of the mind that as-pires to awakening: the simple aspiring mind, the actual formation ofan aspiring mind, and the safeguarding of the aspiring mind fromdeterioration. The venturing awakening mind also has three corre-sponding aspects: the simple venturing mind, the actual formation"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 Buddhist Ethicsof a venturing mind, and the safeguarding of the venturing mindfrom deterioration.What is the difference between the aspiring and venturing minds?The first is the desire to awaken for the sake of others. The second isthe desire to travel the path to awakening for the sake of others. Whenthese two minds arise but are not held by commitment, they are thesimple aspiring and venturing minds subsumed under the mentalfactor of aspiration. Held by the commitment, they become the for-mation of the aspiring and venturing minds, consisting mainly in theintention to forsake factors incompatible with the awakening minditself. From this point forward, the essence of all bodhisattva prac-tices is that of safeguarding the aspiring and venturing minds fromdegeneration. Thus, for the generation of an actual aspiring and ven-turing awakening mind, the mind must be held by commitment.Some scholars believe that the aspiring and venturing minds per-tain only to the relative awakening mind, not to the ultimate awakeningmind. The Ornament of Realizations, however, states that all aspects ofa bodhisattva’s awakening mind are included in the aspiring andventuring minds. When it says, “The formation of the awakening mindfor the sake of others...,” it provides a general description of awak-ening mind that embraces both the relative and ultimate ones.In summary, the bodhisattva commitment is defined as the specialfactor for realizing perfect enlightenment and as the intention attendedby concomitant factors to forsake elements incompatible with awak-ening mind. The commitment may be assumed in a ceremony in com-mon with the proclaimers’ personal liberation vows, in the specialceremony of the universalists, or during a tantric ritual.Third, the vows of an awareness holder are defined by the vener-able Drakpa Gyaltsen in the following way:The awareness holder ’s vows are the blessing of the form of thedeity or of pristine awareness.The awareness holder’s vows apply to all four sets of tantra. Withrespect to the three lower tantras, in the yoga with signs, they are theblessing of the form of the deity; and in the signless yoga, the bless-ing of pristine awareness. In the Highest Yoga Tantra, with respect tothe phase of creation, they are the blessing of the form of the deity;and with respect to the phase of completion, the blessing of pristineawareness."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 17The mandala rites, in accordance with the etymology of the “ini-tiations of the five awarenesses,” explain the meaning of “awareness-holder vows”: “Awareness” (Tib. rig pa) refers to the five pristineawarenesses which are the transformation of the five emotions, suchas unawareness. “Holder” (Tib. ’dzin pa) refers to both the process ofactualization and the actualization of the five pristine awarenesses.The “vow” of such an awareness holder is defined as the special skill-ful means that protects one from objectifying concepts and as an inten-tion (attended by concomitant factors) to forsake incompatible factors.What does the vow protect? From what does it protect? How doesit protect? The Sanskrit term mantra (Tib. sngags) is composed of manfor mano, “mind,” and tra, “to protect”; the vow protects the mind.Mind is defined here as the six consciousnesses (or eight, when thelast one is subdivided) which arise from the contact of the senses withtheir objects.The vow protects the mind from concepts that cause it to cling tothe attributes of ordinary appearance or to those of the deity. “At-tributes” here are the individual aspects of the objects, and “concep-tion” is the clinging to the reality of these particular aspects.Protection is effected through the ripening and liberating aspectsof the Indestructible Way, which are superior to those of the Univer-sal Way, which in turn are superior to the forms of practice of thelesser spiritual ways.Tantric vows are assumed in the course of an initiation in two ways:through promise and through ritual. At the time of the preparatorypart and entrance to the mandala, one assumes the pledges through apromise. If one does not participate in the main part of the proce-dure, however, one is not authorized to safeguard those pledges. Atthe completion of the vajra-master initiation of each of the four classesof tantra, one assumes the main tantric pledges through ritual.As for the tantric pledges of the Highest Yoga Tantra, those as-sumed through a promise are similar to those of the lower tantra.Those assumed through ritual are related to the phases of creationand completion. The first are assumed at the conclusion of the vaseinitiation, since the vase initiation is a precondition for the cultiva-tion of the phase of creation. The pledges of the phase of completionare assumed at the conclusion of the higher initiation, since the threehigher initiations are ripening factors for the phase of completion."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 Buddhist EthicsTantric pledges may be assumed in the presence of a master whohas attained a stage of awakening or a master who is the physicalmanifestation of awakening. Generally, however, the disciple is anordinary person and is initiated by a master who is also an ordinaryperson; in such a case, the disciple must find a master who possessesthe qualifications set forth in the tantras.

The author of thismajor treatise is Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé (Kong sprul Blo gros mtha’ yas,1813–1899), a saint and scholar of the nineteenth century who playeda vital role in the revitalization and preservation of Buddhism in East-ern Tibet.Kongtrul is perhaps best known for his writings: he composed morethan ninety volumes on theory and practice according to the Nyingma,Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, and Bon traditions. His major works are re-ferred to as the Five Great Treasuries (mDzod chen lnga); the first to bewritten was The Encompassment of All Knowledge, which was followedby The Kagyu Treasury of Mantra, The Treasury of Key Instructions, TheTreasury of Precious Treasure Teachings, and The Special Secret Treasuryof Advice. Because of the unequaled scholarship shown in these works,Kongtrul came to be called Jamgön (’Jam-mgon), “Gentle Protector,”which is an epithet of Manjushri, the bodhisattva who symbolizeshigher wisdom.Kongtrul’s huge literary output gives the impression that his primaryfocus was writing. This was not the case; most of his life was spent medi-tating and teaching. He composed the verses of The Encompassment of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 Buddhist EthicsAll Knowledge, for instance, between periods of meditation while hewas living in seclusion at his hermitage, Kunzang Dechen Ösal Ling,in Eastern Tibet. Kongtrul composed this work in response to a re-quest by Ngedön Tenpa Rabgyé, the first Dazang incarnation, whoasked that he produce a treatise on the three Buddhist ethics: the vowsof personal liberation in the Hinayana system, the commitments ofthe bodhisattva in the Mahayana, and the pledges (samaya) of theawareness holder in the Vajrayana. Kongtrul decided to write a bookthat not only set out the three ethics, but also contained a full presen-tation of all aspects of the Buddhist path from the perspectives ofthese three systems. Indeed, The Encompassment of All Knowledgeembraces all fields of spiritual knowledge as well as the related secu-lar sciences known at the time of its composition.Kongtrul presented the finished manuscript of Encompassment toJamyang Kyentsé Wangpo (1820–1892), another outstanding figurein the nineteenth-century renaissance in Eastern Tibet, who, highlyimpressed, declared the work to be “a treasury of knowledge...thefirst of your five treasuries.” Kyentsé urged him to write a commen-tary to it. In 1863, Kongtrul composed a three-volume commentaryon these root verses, entitled The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, complet-ing it in less than four months. The work was revised a year laterwith the help of Trashi Özer, the abbot of Pelpung Monastery.The Encompassment of All Knowledge, together with its commentaryThe Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, has come to be known as The Treasuryof Knowledge. In Tibetan religious literature, the work stands out as aunique masterpiece embodying the entirety of the theories and meth-ods of implementation of the Buddhist doctrine as it was preservedin Tibet. Its encyclopedic presentation, summarizing history, views,traditions, and spiritual practices, reveals an author with an excep-tionally broad intellect and deep experiential understanding, with-out which qualities the work of presenting in an orderly and insight-ful fashion the major themes of such a vast literature could not possi-bly have been carried out.Although he was officially affiliated with the Kagyu school of Ti-betan Buddhism, Kongtrul rarely shows any partiality in his presen-tation. For the most part, he restricts himself to expounding differentviews and their implementation, putting them into context and clarify-ing the underlying rationale. While many authors are only “masters”"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 21of the views and practices of their own schools, Kongtrul, with hisbreadth of knowledge and lack of sectarian bias, demonstrates greatgenerosity toward his readers.Kongtrul’s The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge comprises ten books, eachof which is four chapters long. The first book, Myriad Worlds: BuddhistCosmology in Abhidharma, Kalacakra, and Dzog-chen (Snow Lion, 1995),with its detailed description of the universe and explanation of thecauses of cyclic existence, sets the framework for the entire book. It is,however, the fifth book, translated here as Buddhist Ethics, whichstands as the backbone or “life pillar” of Kongtrul’s work. All of thethemes presented before and after rely on its treatment of the threesets of vows: the preceding sections lead up to the formulation ofethics, and the ethical systems provide the bases for the practicalimplementations that are elucidated in subsequent chapters of TheInfinite Ocean.THIS BOOKThe Teacher-Student RelationshipBuddhist Ethics begins with an elucidation of the context for trainingin ethics: a genuine teacher-student relationship. The first chapterdescribes the qualifications of both the spiritual teachers who repre-sent the three systems of ethics and their disciples. Kongtrul empha-sizes that, in order for the teachings to contribute to one’s knowledgeand development and ultimately reveal one’s primordial conditionof enlightenment, a living example, the spiritual master, is essential.Each of the three ethical systems is demonstrated by its own teach-ers—the monastic preceptor for the Individual Way, the bodhisattvainstructor for the Universal Way, and the vajra master for the TantricWay—who must meet strict qualifications. One master can assumeall the various roles of teachers as long as he or she meets all of therequirements for each type of teacher as specified in each system.To help the aspirant choose a suitable teacher and avoid a bad one,thereby eliminating major perils and obstacles on the path, Kongtruloutlines the knowledge and virtues to look for in a teacher and warnsof possible faults. He notes, however, that at the present time it ishard to find an ideal master; therefore, one must work with one whoshows more qualities than faults."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 Buddhist EthicsOften students seek the perfect master without first determiningwhether they themselves are qualified disciples. To enlighten naivestudents, Kongtrul provides a brief description of the qualities dis-ciples must have. He adds that, since in these times good disciplesare hard to find, a teacher must accept those who, even though theyhave faults, are willing to learn and to put into practice the teachingsof the Buddha.To work with a spiritual teacher involves following certain guide-lines, such as developing the right motivation; carrying out acts ofoffering, respect, and service; and, above all, proving for oneself thevalidity of the teacher’s message. Indications that the student is notworking with a spiritual guide in a proper way include mixing withbad friends, passing time in an idle way, and showing excessive con-cern with one’s own welfare. Of utmost importance in the teacher-student relationship is the tool of faith, which is said to be the sourceof all of the student’s wholesome qualities.Kongtrul also discusses the methodology whereby exposition ofthe doctrine is made meaningful, the qualities and kinds of expertisethe teacher needs to demonstrate while instructing disciples, differ-ent ways of instructing, and the proper way for disciples to listen tothe teaching.The Three EthicsKongtrul then presents in detail the three ethics, or vows: those ofpersonal liberation (pr›timok ̋a), of the awakening mind (bodhicitta),and of the awareness holder (vidy›dhara). These ethical systems are notsimply sets of rules; they are primarily the practical applications andoutcomes of different Buddhist theories. The three ethics are linkedto three different existential choices, or models, proposed in the Bud-dhist way: the monk or renunciate; the layperson who remains in-volved in the world while working toward an altruistic awakening;and the tantric adept, a sharp-witted layperson who works towardawakening while enjoying sense pleasures. These choices do not pre-clude one another; a monk, for example, may embody all three bybeing simultaneously a renunciate, a bodhisattva, and a tantric adept.The ethics of personal liberation, which embody the way of renun-ciation (Tib. spong lam) that permeates the Individual Way (hınay›na),serve as the means for securing personal freedom from the cycle ofexistence by renouncing the causes of suffering. Its precepts are mainly"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 23concerned with the physical aspect of existence. Although preceptsfor lay Buddhists are included, the model of the monk best exempli-fies this approach.The ethics of awakening mind, the path of the bodhisattva, arechiefly concerned with mental disposition. Despite the fact that itspoints of training are generally explained (in Asanga’s works andelsewhere) through examples that relate to the monastic life, this ap-proach remains definitely a Universal Way (mah›y›na) that best fitsthe layperson who is involved in the world.The ethics of the awareness holder in the Secret Mantra Way(guhyamantra) provide the basis for the process of “reawakening” thepristine awareness of great bliss, which is the ultimate nature of themind. Its approach is grounded in the non-violence and altruism ofthe previous two “vows,” but its special feature is that it is a way oftransformation (Tib. ’gyur lam) rather than one of renunciation. It ismainly concerned with the mind as clear light, which is the underly-ing nature of being.Kongtrul’s presentation of ethics is connected to the so-called af-finity for awakening (gotra) and the concordant path that nurturessuch affinity. Whereas the goal of the various Buddhist paths is achiev-ing awakening either for one’s own or others’ welfare, the connect-ing thread between one’s ordinary condition and the state of awak-ening is the affinity, or potential, for awakening. Hinayana, Mahayana,and Vajrayana define spiritual affinity in different ways.In the Individual Way, the “exalted affinity” spoken of by the Ana-lysts means a detachment from conditioned existence and worldly pos-sessions characterized by contentedness and few desires. That affinityis nurtured by the personal liberation vows, which are consistent withthe attitude of detachment and cause it to blossom into freedom fromdisturbing emotions, the state of perfect peace of a saint (arhat).In the Universal Way, the affinity is known as the buddha-nature(tath›gatagarbha) in its twofold aspect, intrinsic and evolved. The ThirdKarmapa, Rangjung Dorjé, explains that the intrinsic affinity is theunborn character that is the very nature of the mind, attended byimpurities. The evolved affinity is the unceasing radiance of the veryempty nature of mind, attended by impurities. The union of the na-ture of the mind and its radiance is called the “union of the two im-pure dimensions of enlightenment” (the impure dharmak›ya andrÒpak›ya, respectively). Nurtured by the bodhisattva commitment"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 Buddhist Ethicsin its two aspects, related to the relative and ultimate awakeningminds, such twofold affinity blossoms into the two pure dimensionsof enlightenment.In the Secret Mantra, the affinity is said to be the nature of the in-nate pristine awareness of great bliss. As it is unceasingly presentfrom the level of an ordinary being until buddhahood, it is knownalso as causal continuity (tantra). When such affinity is nurtured bythe concordant vows of the two phases of creation and completion ofthe Highest Yoga Tantra, the method continuity, it blossoms into thestate of Buddha Vajradhara, the resultant continuity.The Ethics of Personal LiberationThe focus of the ethics of personal liberation is to control impulsesthat lead body and speech to undertake negative actions. Becausesuch actions are always linked to limiting emotional patterns, Indi-vidualists, in addition to observing ethics, must train in the discrimi-native awareness that realizes selflessness in order to attain perfectpeace, the state of cessation of such patterns. Furthermore, for thatmeditation to be stable, mental concentration also must be cultivated.Thus, personal liberation ethics are essentially identical with trainingin morality, meditation, and wisdom. Although the aim of the monk’svows and other personal liberation vows appears to be restraint fromunwholesome physical behavior, it would be misleading to view thosevows reductively, because their implicit aim is to overcome limitingmental patterns.The foundation of these ethics lies in the precepts relating to tak-ing refuge and the four “root,” or crucial, precepts that prohibit mur-der, theft, lying, and adultery. Refuge relates to the Buddha, theDharma, and the Sangha: the first is understood as the Teacher, thesecond as the teachings, and the third as the community (here themonastic one in particular). Originally, taking refuge was primarilyan expression of faith that distinguished a follower of the Buddhafrom practitioners of other religions. Refuge marked the beginning ofan earnest undertaking of the Buddhist path. In higher forms of Bud-dhist view and methods of implementation, refuge takes on deeperlayers of meaning, and in the ultimate sense means taking refuge in“the buddha within,” the realization of the natural and unmodifiedintrinsic awareness lying within oneself."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 25The four root precepts prohibit the four actions that would un-doubtedly cause suffering for others and also compromise the tran-quility of one’s mind, thereby destroying one’s chance to developmeditation and gain the discriminative awareness needed to uprootcyclic existence.When the Buddhist community was first being formed, taking ref-uge in front of the Buddha was all that was needed for one to beaccepted as a monk. Gradually, because of the misbehavior of monksand for other reasons, rules were instituted, for the most part limitedto a particular temporal and social context. Many were intended notonly for the welfare of the monks themselves, but also for thecommunity’s internal harmony and external social respectability.Rules gained more importance; to be a monk became a matter ofmaintaining specific rules and regulations rather than a matter of freelyheading into a spiritual life. Eventually, to enter the Buddhist com-munity, the aspirant needed to assume vows, and vows came to rep-resent a commitment to abide by the entire body of rules. Such vowswere not simple promises. Instead, they were “generated” in the can-didate through a series of conditions and requisites, such as the ab-bot, and their primary requirement was an attitude of disengagementfrom cyclic life.As the vow developed into an “entity,” the identification of its na-ture became an important matter, which explains the various asser-tions Kongtrul presents, based on detailed analyses, on the nature ofthe vow. The conclusions would have little relevance to the keepingof the rules themselves but would definitely be relevant to determin-ing at what point a vow is lost.Personal liberation vows are basically of two kinds: those that pro-hibit actions such as killing and lying, which are considered unwhole-some for anyone who commits them; and those that prohibit actionssuch as eating in the evening, which are improper only for monksand nuns. The first kind involves a concept of “natural evil,” or “ab-solute morality,” which is probably influenced by the realist philo-sophical view held by the Analysts, to whom the tradition of per-sonal liberation is undoubtedly connected. That also explains, to someextent, why the personal liberation vow is compared to a clay pot;once broken, it cannot be repaired.Kongtrul discusses in detail the various classes of personal libera-tion: the precepts of the purificatory fast and the vows of the layperson,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 Buddhist Ethicsthe male and female novices, the female postulant, and the monk. Healso briefly examines the series of monastic rites, including confession.The vows of a nun, regrettably, are not included, because, as Kongtrulexplains, the ordination of nuns was never introduced into Tibet.The Ethics of the Mind of AwakeningThe focus of the commitments of the mind of awakening is the train-ing to be followed on the bodhisattva path. As these commitmentsare centered on the awakening mind itself, its causes, nature, variet-ies (the aspiring and venturing, the relative and ultimate), and so forthare explained in detail before the training itself is described.The actual cultivation of the awakening mind, attended by specificpoints of training, is presented from the perspective of the lineage ofthe profound view, which was inspired by Manjushri and transmit-ted to Nagarjuna, Shantideva, and others, and the magnificent deedslineage, which was inspired by Maitreya and transmitted to Asanga,Chandragomin, Atisha, and others.These two systems are basically the same, and certain aspects oftraining are common to both. The common training includes the threeforms of ethics for the bodhisattva, which are to shun non-virtue, ac-quire wholesome qualities, and work for the benefit of others, andthe implementation of the six perfections: generosity, ethics, patience,effort, meditation, and wisdom.Nagarjuna’s system allows anyone who is willing and sufficientlyintelligent to take the commitments of the aspiring and venturingawakening minds simultaneously, either in front of a master or alonein the imagined presence of buddhas and bodhisattvas. As long asone preserves the mind that aspires to awaken, the commitments arenot lost. A damaged commitment can be restored in a dream throughsupplication to the bodhisattva Akashagarbha; the bright trainee re-stores damaged commitments through the understanding of the un-born nature of things. The points of training are followed accordingto one’s ability, and the commitments are taken for a period as longas one estimates one can safeguard them.In Asanga’s system, only a person who holds one of the seven setsof personal liberation vows is entitled to assume the awakening-mindcommitments, and such a person does so gradually (in differentceremonies), first accepting those of aspiration and then, once he orshe has gained proficiency, those of venturing. It is recommended"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 27that one assume the commitments in the presence of a qualifiedmaster. If a major infraction has been committed with great emotionalinvolvement, the commitment is deemed to be lost and must be takenanew. (Here Kongtrul adds an enigmatic note from the great Dzog-chen master Longchenpa, which says that the commitment, once ithas deteriorated, cannot be retaken more than three times.) The in-fraction should be confessed in the presence of vow holders. Accord-ing to this lineage, the trainee must safeguard all of the points of train-ing from the very beginning and must promise to keep the commit-ments until he or she attains enlightenment, not just for a selectedperiod of time.Nagarjuna’s system seems more lenient and less influenced bymonasticism than that of Asanga, whose points of training are morecomplex. Presumably, differences in the two traditions stem from theirdifferent emphases: the profound view lineage stresses the knowl-edge aspect of the path; the lineage of magnificent deeds, the con-duct, or method, aspect.Historically and psychologically, the bodhisattva’s path is halfwaybetween the paths of renunciation and transformation. The peacockwhose feathers grow more colorful as a result of eating poison sym-bolizes the bodhisattva, who remains unpolluted and grows moreradiant as his involvement in the world deepens. Accordingly, theCluster of Jewels Scripture says:Just as the paddy and cane-sugar fields are nurtured by the or-dure of the village, likewise, the sprout of the awakening mindis nurtured by the ordure of the emotions of a bodhisattva.Such images clearly show that the Universal Way transcends the In-dividual Way’s form of renunciation, which regards “objects of de-sire...as poisonous leaves.” This transcendence of strict renunciationholds the seed of the principle of transformation, which is developedto its fullest extent in tantra.The Universal Way prescribes a set of personal liberation vows thatare not radically different from those of the Individualists. BecauseUniversalists are distinguished for their noble intention of seeking en-lightenment in order to serve all living beings, however, there is a fun-damental difference in principle between their form of observance andthat of the Individualists. Moreover, since the philosophical trendsunderlying the Universal Way stress the selflessness of phenomena and,in particular, the Centrists speak of the non-reality of all appearances,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Buddhist Ethicshow could morality, or ethics, in the bodhisattva path be asserted asabsolute rather than as a variable factor dependent on conditions?The Universal Way therefore exhibits a flexible approach to the per-sonal liberation vows and goes so far as to say that a bodhisattva mayengage in the seven unwholesome actions of body and speech if mo-tivated by love and compassion. As Shantideva says:The Compassionate One, in his broad vision,Gave permission even for what is prohibited.Owing to its focus on mental disposition, the ethics of the awaken-ing mind, if damaged, can be renewed or repaired by the bodhisattva,just as a golden vessel can be repaired by a skilled goldsmith.The Ethics of the Awareness HolderThe awareness-holder pledges of the Secret Mantra Way aim to dis-solve the patterns of movement of dualistic conceptions by reawaken-ing, through special means, the blissful pristine awareness that hasalways existed as the core of being. As this pristine awareness findsits support in the seminal essence, to dissolve the patterns of move-ment has the sense of blocking the movement or emission of seminalessence, which is the starting point of cyclic existence in a doublesense (emission meaning both the beginning of dualistic representa-tions and the conception of a new being in the womb).The natural “vow,” or “reality,” in the tantra is that everything ispermeated by innate pristine awareness. The “vow” of implementa-tion consists in the phases of creation and completion, which binddualistic appearances within blissful pristine awareness. The final,resultant “vow” is the spontaneous arising of all subjective appear-ance as enlightened dimensions and pristine awareness.Only with a very elastic conception of the term can tantric vows bedesignated as moral obligations. For that matter, the very purpose ofthe vows is to overcome the dualistic judgment of good and bad, fromthe beginning of the path up to realization of the pristine awarenessthat is at the origin of all phenomena, conditioned or otherwise.In assuming the vow of tantra, no distinction is made among can-didates, who may even be prostitutes or butchers; however, one shouldbe interested in and capable of maintaining the pledges. As a precon-dition for all subsequent tantric conduct, aspirants must conform tothe four great pledges: to believe in the law of cause and effect, totake refuge, to develop the awakening mind, and to be initiated."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 29Kongtrul discusses the tantric vows according to the traditions ofboth the ancient and the new tantras. The ancient ones are followedprimarily in the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism; the new, inthe Kagyu, Geluk, and Sakya schools.Tantric Pledges in the New SchoolsThe new schools categorize the tantras into four main classes. Eachhas its own sets of pledges, which share the single aim of dissolvingdualistic conceptions but are distinguished by the use of differentand gradually more intensely blissful experiences, ranging from thedelight born from looking at a consort to that experienced in sexualunion with a consort. All these “vows,” or “conducts,” are includedin pledges concerned with skillful means and those concerned withwisdom, or in the vow of EVAM, the single union of bliss and empti-ness, the reality that pervades all seasons of being, from the groundup to the fruition of enlightenment. Included within the tantric pledgesare some of the vows of personal liberation and other commitmentsincorporating the spiritual practices of the Way of the Perfections.In the Highest Yoga Tantra, pledges are interpreted in terms of theirprovisional and definitive meanings, the creation and completionphases, and their relation to the five or six buddha families. An adeptof the phase of creation may perform, for others’ welfare, actions pre-scribed in the provisional meaning which would be strictly prohibitedby the personal liberation vows. The hidden, or definitive, meaning ofinterpretable pledges is largely related to the phase of completion andthe various techniques dealing with winds, channels, and semen.The Highest Yoga Tantra is distinguished from the three lowertantras in that it teaches a deity yoga based on the awareness of theinseparability of oneself as the deity (“symbolic deity,” samayasattva,dam tshig sems dpa’) and the pristine-awareness deity (jñ›nasattva, yeshes sems dpa’) invited from space. This tantra dispenses with many ofthe lower tantras’ observances related to cleanliness, white foods, andouter purification which involve the concept of a deity different fromand superior to oneself.Because the “binding agent” of dualistic conceptions is the pris-tine awareness of great bliss, many of the pledges in the Highest YogaTantra concern pristine awareness and the outer and inner means forits actualization, such as the action seal, the imaginary seal, and thegreat seal, or the semen which is the support of the pristine awareness"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Buddhist Ethicsof bliss. The tantric path is deemed the “resultant way,” because thepractitioner transforms his or her own ordinary body, speech, andmind into the deity’s and thereby realizes enlightened body, speech,and mind. The result is buddhahood. For this reason, the pledges arealso presented as those of a buddha’s body, speech, and mind. More-over, the spiritual master is the medium through which the enlight-ened activities of all the buddhas shine; therefore, the most impor-tant of the fourteen vital pledges is never to lose respect for one’smaster. Several other pledges prescribe the proper relationship to thevajra master and vajra siblings.The prescribed conduct for adepts of the Highest Yoga Tantra whodwell in a state of uninterrupted contemplation prohibits the per-formance of symbolic hand gestures, building stupas, drawingmandalas, paying homage to masters other than one’s own, andother external good deeds, all of which are required by lower tantras.Once practitioners have gained mastery of pristine awareness, theyare beyond vows and transgressions, acceptance and rejection, goodand bad conduct, and other creations of dualistic thought. For theseyogins, the pledge is an “all-embracing observance” that takes placespontaneously.Numerous methods of restoration of tantric pledges are mentioned,such as the fire ritual, recitation and meditation on Vajrasattva, andso forth. Higher tantric pledges associated with higher initiations areto be restored by understanding the intrinsically pure nature of one’sown mind. Tantric pledges, though strict, are likened to a dented ves-sel that can be restored to its original form through one’s own efforts.Tantric Pledges in the Ancient SchoolsIn the ancient tantras, the pledges are described in relation to theMahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga systems of tantra. The general onesare not radically different from those of the new tantras, while thespecific, exceptional, and ultimate ones are flavored by the languageand the views of these three inner tantras.The pledges are classified as those with and those without limits tobe observed. Those with limits are associated with compassion andare said to be assumed gradually, in dependence on initiation. Thosewithout limits, which are the very realization of reality, are said to be"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 31gained instantaneously, without ritual. The latter are said to be mostwonderful and to exceed all others, but practitioners of “weak aspi-ration,” who have not had the realization of reality, are advised toobserve the pledges with limits to be observed.Pledges in the system of Atiyoga, or self-perfection, reflect the “thirdway”—that of intrinsic freedom (Tib. rang ’grol). Included among itsgeneral pledges are vows typical of personal liberation and others ofa tantric nature, most likely because this system is placed by theNyingmapas at the peak of (that is, as the result of) nine spiritualpursuits.Although included within the three inner tantras—Mahayoga,Anuyoga, and Atiyoga—Atiyoga does not belong to the path of trans-formation. It speaks of the primordial state of being that cannot bepolluted by unawareness or actions stemming from unawareness, andis therefore beyond the sphere of purification and the means of puri-fication. It does not involve pure and impure visions, and it is be-yond the sphere of transformation and the means of transformation.The pledges of self-perfection comprise four exceptional pledges.Two are related to the practice of “cutting through,” and two are re-lated to the practice of the “direct leap.” These do not involve prohi-bitions; these pledges represent the view and method of implemen-tation of this system. The two pledges of “cutting through” are torealize that all phenomena are primordially non-existent and to dropall clinging to appearances and allow all appearances to flow intothe state of reality through the cultivation of natural intrinsic aware-ness unbounded by the sense of an observer. The two pledges of the“direct leap” are, first, to abandon an external spiritual quest by find-ing the buddha within oneself through the cultivation of the fourvisionary appearances out of one’s inner radiance, and, second, todissolve all things into the state of reality through the experientialknowledge that the entire universe is simply one’s own naturalintrinsic awareness.In concluding his discussion of the three ethics, Kongtrul providesan extremely terse résumé of the process of spiritual development forindividuals following the Individual, Universal, and Secret Mantraways. These serve as introductions to themes that are developed fullyin the later sections of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 Buddhist EthicsAbout the TranslationKongtrul’s systematic and precise style hardly affords any room fora “creative” translation. Nonetheless, for the sake of study andcomprehension, a linear translation that closely follows Kongtrul’sstyle may prove more useful to the reader than any attempt to facili-tate the reader ’s understanding by sacrificing accuracy.Very often, Kongtrul is succinct to the point that a clear under-standing of a theme becomes difficult. For that reason, numerous ex-plicatory notes have been added. When it was possible and appro-priate to do so, we drew from Kongtrul’s own explanations in thelatter parts of The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge. For certain points, how-ever, explanations found elsewhere were more helpful, and thereforewe relied on several authoritative sources. Some of these are recom-mended by Kongtrul in the text, such as Pema Karpo’s Three Vowsand Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows; others were our ownchoices, such as Tsonapa’s Sunlight Illuminating [Gunaprabha’s] Fun-damental Summary of Discipline, and several others contained in theKangyur and Tengyur.To clarify difficult points, we have consulted scholars and accom-plished masters who patiently answered our questions. Nowadays,however, it is difficult to find masters who embody the knowledgethat Kongtrul exhibits in his works and who can confidently unravelvery subtle and profound themes. This clearly indicates that much ofthe ancient knowledge contained in works such as The Infinite Oceanof Knowledge is rapidly vanishing and that preservation is urgentlyneeded. It is probably one of the reasons that Kalu Rinpoché askedthat this book be translated.To complete the translation of this part of The Infinite Ocean of Knowl-edge took considerable time and effort, accompanied by the grayingof the translators’ hair. Although we cannot claim to have undertakenthis task solely for the benefit of others, we have not done it for per-sonal profit or fame. While aware that this work could have beencarried out more brilliantly by gifted scholars, we feel confident that,because the project was inspired and blessed by the exceptionallynoble intention of the venerable Kalu Rinpoché, Buddhist Ethics willbe of true help to those who wish to make the Buddhist teachings aliving experience. Activities that have been initiated with such altru-istic resolve may yield results far beyond the estimation of the ratio-nal mind. The following story illustrates this point."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Translators' Introduction 33The great Indian scholar Chandragomin had composed a treatiseon Sanskrit grammar entitled Chandravyakarana. Later, while stayingat Nalanda, he came across an excellent book on grammar, written inverse, called the Samantabhadra, the author of which was Chandrakirti.Chandragomin felt that, in comparison with Chandrakirti’s work, hisown book was not of much use, so he dropped it into a well. Hismystic inspirer, Tara, appeared to him and declared: “You have com-posed your text with the good intention that it should help others. Infuture, it will be very useful to intelligent people. Chandrakirti is proudof his scholarship, and thus his work will be of limited use to others.So take your book out of the well!”He did so. According to legend, those who drank water from thatwell immediately developed great intelligence, to say nothing ofthose who studied his work. In accordance with the prophecy,Chandragomin’s grammar remains well known even today, whereasthat of Chandrakirti soon vanished.Kongtrul’s work provides a clear and masterly exposition of Bud-dhist ethics, and it is particularly useful in that the three differentethics of the three spiritual pursuits—Hinayana, Mahayana, andVajrayana—are presented together, allowing the reader to make acomparative analysis. At first, the volume of material may seemoverwhelming. Eventually, however, as the material is assimilated, asynthesis of its contents will arise in one’s mind in the form of asimple understanding. That understanding will be relevant to all situ-ations in one’s life and will guide one on the compassionate path toknowledge.It would not have been possible to complete such a complex workwithout the wisdom and support of several great masters. BokarRinpoché, senior meditation master of the Kagyu lineage, and KenpoLodrö Dönyö have tirelessly shared their knowledge with us, clarify-ing numerous points throughout the work; the late Tara TrulkuRinpoché elucidated the subject of personal liberation vows; and JadralRinpoché, Khetsun Zangpo Rinpoché, Denma Lochö Rinpoché, andThrangu Rinpoché provided scholarly interpretations on many diffi-cult points concerning the Vajrayana pledges.Over the course of several years, many persons have participatedin the project to translate the entire Infinite Ocean of Knowledge.

Just to hear its name is rare,how much more so to encounter it. Now that the Buddha’s teachingis known in this world and you are a human being whose life is re-plete with leisure and endowments,1 do not waste this opportunity,for such a life is a wish-fulfilling jewel. In order to make your lifefruitful, as you wisely approach [the teaching,] first search for a quali-fied spiritual guide and then follow his or her guidance impeccably."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 Buddhist EthicsThe search for a master comprises three preliminary steps: the first[is reflecting upon the uniqueness of the Buddha’s teaching] asdescribed in Interwoven Praises2:[Your doctrine is] the sole path, easy to enter;It grants supremacy and has no flaw.Propitious in the beginning, middle, and end:No one has taught a doctrine like yours!The teaching of the Buddha provides the sole path to liberation. Eas-ily entered, it grants none other than supreme attainment. [TheBuddha’s doctrine] is flawless [in being the antidote] to attachmentand other [emotions]. It is propitious because all stages [of its prac-tice]—first listening, then reflection, and finally making it a livingexperience—become the seed for the attainment of higher levels ofexistence and liberation. For these reasons, the Buddha’s doctrine rep-resents, in every respect, the source of all happiness and well-being.These features are not found in the doctrines of other teachers, suchas that of the seer Kapila,3 but are exclusive to the teachings of theBuddha. Accordingly, the bodhisattva Shantideva composed thisprayer4:May the doctrine, the only cure for sufferingAnd the source of all happiness,Be supported and honoredAnd endure for long!The second [step is valuing the precious human life.] The Reunionof Father and Son Scripture states5:Having shunned all of the eight fetters6 of lifeAnd found the marvelous endowments so rare to obtainWise ones who have come to have faith in the doctrine of theJoyful OneEngage in the right spiritual practice.Only by having faith in and following the Buddha’s teaching can wetake full advantage of our human lives that are replete with leisureand endowments.The third step [is considering the need for a spiritual guide]. TheTranscendent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines states7:A bodhisattva, great being, who wishes to attain ultimate, au-thentic, and perfect awakening, should first approach, work with,and honor spiritual guides."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 41What kind of spiritual guide should one look for? The Collection ofSpontaneous Utterances states8:Since by relying on an inferior, one regresses,On an equal, one stagnates,And on a superior, one excels,Keep in touch with a spiritual guide superior to yourself.We will not develop any wholesome qualities by working with a spiri-tual guide who is inferior to ourselves in the areas of ethical, schol-arly, and meditative abilities, etc. [On the contrary, the relationship]will prove detrimental in many ways, and we will regress. When thespiritual guide is an equal, of similar abilities to ours, we will stag-nate, neither progressing nor regressing. When the spiritual guidehas qualities superior to ours, we can excel and attain the desiredsupreme goal. Therefore, we should always remain close to an indi-vidual superior to ourselves, a spiritually advanced master. The samescripture states9:If you study with a masterFar superior to yourself in ethics,Contemplative tranquility, and wisdom,You can even excel him.THE NECESSITY OF WORKING WITH A SPIRITUAL GUIDE [II]The need for a guide can be determined from scripture, logic,and similes.The necessity of working with a spiritual guide can be determinedfrom (1) scriptures, (2) logic, and (3) similes.Scriptures [A]There are countless scriptural references to the need for working witha spiritual guide. The Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture states10:Worthy students who respect spiritual teachersShould always remain close to learned mastersBecause from them the virtues of the wise spring.The Flower Array Scripture states11:O child of the universal family, all your virtuous qualities issuefrom your spiritual guide. You can encounter and receive instruc-tions from one only if you have cultivated merit and wisdom for"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 Buddhist Ethicsoceans of eons. Otherwise, to meet a spiritual guide may provemore difficult than coming upon the most rare of gems. There-fore, never tire of honoring your spiritual guide.Logic [B]Given that a student wishes to attain the state of an omniscient bud-dha, the basic premise is that it is necessary for him or her to workwith a spiritual guide. The reason is that the individual does not knowhow to cultivate merit and wisdom or to clear away obscurations.Examples consistent with this proof are the enlightened ones of thethree times. The converse can be illustrated by solitary sages12 andother examples.Similes [C]Many similes illustrate [the need for a spiritual guide]. For example,the Biography of Shri Sambhava states13:Spiritual teachers are like guides because they set us on the pathof the perfections.The Biography of the Lay Practitioner Achala states14:Spiritual guides are like escorts because they escort us to the stateof omniscience.The Flower Array states15:Spiritual guides are like ferrymen because they carry us acrossthe river of cyclic life.SPIRITUAL GUIDES AND THEIR QUALIFICATIONS [III]This section has two parts: (1) an overview, and (2) an explanation.The first of these has two parts: (1) types of spiritual guides, and (2)their qualifications.Overview [A]Types [1]A spiritual guide may be an ordinary human being, abodhisattva, a buddha in manifest or enjoyment dimensionSuited to the four phases of the disciple’s growth.There are four types of spiritual guide: ordinary human beings,bodhisattvas, the manifest dimension of a buddha, and the enjoyment"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 43dimension of a buddha. These four are suited to the four phases [ofour spiritual growth]. At the beginning of our quest, it is impossiblefor us to come in touch with buddhas or bodhisattvas who havereached the higher stages of awakening. Therefore, we have to workwith ordinary human beings as our spiritual guides.When the obscurations caused by our previous deeds have cleared,we can meet bodhisattvas on higher stages of awakening.16 As wereach the highest level of the path of accumulation,17 we can encoun-ter the manifest dimension of a buddha. Then, as we attain the higherstages of awakening, we can come in contact with the enjoyment di-mension of a buddha as our spiritual guide.At the beginning of our quest, when we are still trapped in thedungeon of our emotions and previous deeds, we cannot considerworking with higher spiritual guides because we will not see asmuch as their faces! We first must seek a spiritual guide who is anordinary human being. When our path has been illuminated by thelight of his or her speech, we will come to meet higher spiritual guides.Therefore, the kindest of all is the spiritual guide who is an ordinaryperson.18Qualifications [2]Eight, four, or two qualities characterize the teacher who is anordinary person.Since the [latter] three types of spiritual guide do not directly benefitthe beginner, it is not necessary to describe their characteristics here.The spiritual guide who is an ordinary person must possess eight,four, or two specific qualities. The eight are listed in the followingverse, which summarizes the treatment of this subject in the Stages ofthe Bodhisattva:He or she is ethical and learned,Spiritually accomplished, full of compassion and love,Fearless, patient, dauntless,And eloquent.19The four [qualities] are referred to in the Scripture Ornament20: be-ing a great teacher by virtue of prodigious learning; having the ca-pacity to clear away doubts by virtue of higher wisdom; speakingwords worthy of taking to heart because this teacher’s deeds are thoseof a virtuous person; having the ability to point out the exact natureof both thoroughly polluted and fully pure phenomena.21"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 Buddhist EthicsThe two [qualities of a spiritual guide] are erudition and the com-mitment [to awaken for the benefit of others].

The qualifications of each are explained below.Individual Qualifications [2]This three-part section describes the qualifications of (1) the monasticpreceptor, (2) the bodhisattva’s instructor, and (3) the tantric master.The Monastic Preceptor [a]The ordaining preceptor, ceremonial master, interviewer, tutoror instructor, and instructor of novices act as the five monas-tic teachers.There are four types of monastic preceptors: the preceptor who pre-sides over the novice and monk’s ordination, the ceremonial master,the interviewer who inquires [whether the candidate has] the requi-sites [for taking monastic vows], and the [monk’s] tutor and instruc-tor. Five types [can be counted] if the instructor of male and femalenovices is added."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 45The general requirements of the monastic preceptor are mentionedin [Shakhyaprabha’s] Three Hundred Stanzas on the Novitiate24:A monk who is ethical, well-versed in monastic ceremonies,Compassionate toward the sick, associated with upright monks,Diligent in helping others spiritually and materially, and ableto give timely counselIs qualified to be a monastic preceptor.A monastic preceptor is known by the following qualities: [stead-fastness, learning, and helpfulness]. Steadfastness refers to living byethical discipline; [specifically,] having kept the monastic vows for[at least] ten years. Learning refers to flawless recollection of the mo-nastic ceremonies set forth in the collection of scriptures on discipline.Helpfulness comprises several aspects: caring with benevolence andcompassion for students who are sick; keeping company with monkswho are upright in that they maintain ethics; being diligent in help-ing others by giving both instructions and material things; and offer-ing [disciples] timely and pertinent counsel.25In particular, the preceptor [who presides over ordination ceremo-nies] must possess the four virtues of steadfastness, learning, respect-ability,26 and helpfulness. Steadfastness and learning may be consid-ered as a single quality or may be further divided into twenty-onegroups of five characteristics each.27 These characteristics are explainedin [Mikyö Dorjé’s] Great Commentary on the Summary of Discipline andin the works of the eminent Pema Karpo. Helpfulness is said to be oftwelve kinds:Compassionate and patient, maintaining close ties withupright persons,Persevering in the two forms of helpful activity, being of thesame gender and view [as the candidate],Able to speak, comprehend, and being of sound mind,Having a natural human body, and [holding] his usual rank[within the monastic community].The primary qualifications of the ceremonial master are six: (1)observing monastic vows, (2) being of the same gender as the candi-date [for ordination], (3) sharing with the candidate the same view onthe discipline,28 (4) fulfillment of the three basic requisites [knowing"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 Buddhist Ethicshow to speak, comprehending what is said, and being of sound mind],(5) having a natural human body [i.e., not being an emanation], and(6) holding his usual rank [i.e., not having been demoted]. In addi-tion to those six qualities, he must be skilled in conducting the ordi-nation procedure.The interviewer must meet the above six requirements and be pro-ficient in conducting an inquiry to determine potential impedimentsfor a candidate [wishing to receive ordination].The tutor, in addition to the six requirements, must be able to in-still the sense of pure ethics in his students by explaining the prohibi-tions and duties [of a monk].The instructor, in addition to the six requirements, must be quali-fied to teach by virtue of his clear understanding of the three collec-tions of scriptures.29The Bodhisattva’s Instructor [b]The Scripture Ornament states30:An aspirant bodhisattva should work with a spiritual guidewho is self-controlled, tranquil, and has pacifieddeception,Is eminent, diligent, and displays a wealth of transmissions,Has realized the nature of all phenomena, is articulate,Embodies loving-kindness, and shows no weariness ordiscouragement.The instructor of the bodhisattva should meet the following tenrequirements: (1) self-control, i.e., having tamed the “wild horse” ofthe mind by the “fine bridle” of training in ethics; (2) mental tranquil-ity, achieved through training in contemplation, using [the tools of]mindfulness and inspection; (3) pacification of deception, achievedthrough the wisdom of discerning reality and grounded in the tran-quility of a pliant mind; (4) eminence, i.e., possessed of greatly supe-rior qualities, being neither inferior nor equal to students; (5) dili-gence, i.e., a constant delight in helping others; (6) a wealth of trans-missions gained from extensive study of the three collections of scrip-tures; (7) supreme realization of the nature of all phenomena gainedthrough the strength of listening, pondering, and meditating; (8) skill-ful articulation, i.e., the ability to present the stages of the path in away that suits the mental aptitude of the disciple; (9) genuine loving-kindness, in having the pure motivation to teach out of compassion,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 47without regard for personal gain or honor; (10) freedom from weari-ness and discouragement, in never tiring of repeating lessons andshowing patience [in the face] of anger.[Four of these qualifications]—self-control, tranquility, pacificationof deception, and realization of the nature of phenomena—are aspectsof spiritual accomplishment. Possessing a wealth of transmissions isan aspect of [mastery of] the transmission. Those five, together witheminence, are the six qualities of personal growth. The remaining fourare qualities related to caring for others. A teacher who meets these tenrequirements is known as an exemplary human being.The bodhisattva’s instructor who exhibits twelve qualities suchas erudition is an exceptional teacher.Exceptional is the instructor of the bodhisattva who exhibits twelvequalities, erudition and so forth, as referred to by the exaltedNagarjuna:Remain near an instructor who has these twelve [qualities]:Erudition, profound wisdom,Disinterest in material gain or possessions,An awakening mind, great compassion,Patience in enduring hardship, [strength to overcome] weari-ness or discouragement,[A wealth of] oral instructions, freedom through [the practiceof] the path,And knowledge of the student’s affinity and spiritual maturity.The Tantric Master [c]The tantric master must be steadfast, self-controlled, intelligent,Patient, honest, and well-versed in the activities related tomantra and tantra.He or she is compassionate, learned, expert in ten fields,Proficient in the drawing of mandalas, and skilled in the waysof explaining the Secret Mantra.The types of tantric or vajra master will be explained below.The qualifications of the vajra master are discussed at length [invarious works]. As a summary of these, the Fifty [Verses on Devotion to]the Master31 lists fifteen qualifications, six general and nine specific. Thesix are as follows: (1) steadfastness, by virtue of having an unperturbedbody, speech, and mind; (2) self-control, by virtue of meditative train-ing; (3) intelligence or capacity for accurate analysis; (4) patience or"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 Buddhist Ethicsrestraint from anger (when seeing students’ poor conduct); and (5and 6) honesty and sincerity, i.e., freedom from deceptive ways (hid-ing one’s faults or shortcomings) and artifice (giving a false impres-sion in order to mislead others).The nine specific qualifications [of the vajra master] are as follows:(1) knowledge of the use of mantras32 in performing the four charis-matic activities,33 etc.; (2) knowledge of the practices related to tantra,34for example, [being able to explain the tantras by means of the] sixparameters35; (3) loving compassion for others; (4) proficiency inthe common treatises36; (5, 6, and 7) mastery of the [three sets of] tenfields; (8) proficiency in the drawing of mandalas37 based on properperformance of familiarization,38 etc., and mastery of initiation39 pro-cedures; and (9) knowledge of how to explain the Secret Mantra inthe manner appropriate for [disciples] of superior, moderate, andlesser capabilities.The first set of ten fields of expertise comprises those areas indis-pensable to the vajra master. The Tantra of Consecration states40:Mandala, contemplation, seal,Stance, mantra, seated position,Recitation, fire offering,Food offering (torma), and dissolution.41The second set of ten fields of expertise which concern ritual istaught in the Indestructible Tent Tantra and enumerated accordingly inDombipa’s Ten Essential Points42:The victorious ones have specified ten fields of expertise:Protection [wheel], conferral of initiation, food offerings,recitation, rite of tearing apart the union,[Two] reversals, actualization of the mandala,The threatening rite, and departure request.43The third set of ten fields of expertise which are of ultimate signifi-cance are elucidated in the Tantra [of Hevajra] in Five Hundred Thou-sand [Lines]44 and summarized in the [Means of Accomplishment of theGlorious] Blazing Jewel45:Know these ten fields of expertise:Vajra, bell, pristine awareness,Deity, mandala, fire offering,Mantra, colored sands, food offerings, and initiation."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 49The ten outer fields given in the Indestructible Nucleus’ Ornament[Tantra]46 resemble the [first set] of fields of expertise given in the Tantraof Consecration. There is a similar enumeration in the Summation ofEssential Points. These are presented from the viewpoint of the yogatantra system.The father-son transmission from Mikyö Dorjé asserts that the tensecret [or inner] fields of expertise taught in the Indestructible Nucleus’Ornament47—The rites of the two reversals,The secret initiation and the initiation of pristine awarenessthrough wisdom,The ritual of tearing apart the union [of hostile forces],Food offerings, vajra muttering,The ritual of accomplishing the fierce act,Consecration and actualization of the mandalaAre the ten secret fields of expertise.48—as well as those found in the Beholding the Qualities of the SpiritualMaster Tantra,49 the Commentary on the Buddhasamayoga,50 and the Clus-ter of Secret Instructions51 are from the standpoint of the Highest YogaTantra.From a different perspective, the vajra master owns threetreasures, has received the entire course of initiations,Is committed, learned in the tantras, skilled in performingrituals, and has produced signs of experience. According to the Ancient Translation School of the Secret Mantra,[a qualified vajra master] owns three genuine treasures: (1) the viewthat realizes the indivisibility of the [relative and ultimate] truths; (2)the contemplation that has reached the culmination of the phases ofcreation and completion52; and (3) the preservation of general andspecific pledges. (The three treasures are also explained as expertisein the systems of Mahayoga, the treasure of the creation phase; Anu,the treasure of the completion phase; and Ati53, the treasure of theview.) [Further, the vajra master] (4) has received the entire course ofprofound initiations that empower and transform; (5) does not for-sake the secret mantra and intentionally nurtures worthy disciples;(6) is learned in the tantras and able to elucidate the meaning of thetransmissions; (7) is skilled in composing rituals for the performance"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 Buddhist Ethicsof charismatic activity; and (8) has produced the signs of experiencederived from the practice of the secret instructions of oral transmis-sions. In Buddhaguhya’s Sequence of the Path [of the Magical Net], sucha teacher is called a vajra master who possesses the eight qualities ofnatural expression.In summary, the vajra master belongs to an authentic lineage,preserves the pledges, has heard secret instructions,And has realized the meaning of tantra. A monk is the best ofthe three types of vajra master.The vajra master ’s qualifications mentioned above are all includedin the following: The vajra master belongs to a lineage of masterswho from Buddha Vajradhara to the present time have transmittedmaturing [initiations] and liberating [instructions] and have not vio-lated any of the pledges; preserves vows, pledges, and tantric con-duct; has received the secret instructions that have been transmittedfrom one lineage holder to the next; has realized the teachings of theBuddha and their commentaries, and, in particular, the import of thetantras; and has a compassionate and altruistic mind. Lay vajra masters are said to be lower [in rank] to novice or monkand nun vajra masters unless they have reached stages of awaken-ing. Accordingly, Vajragarbha’s Commentary54 states:Unless he has attained the stages of awakening,A layman is not to be venerated as a [tantric] master, [not even]by a king.Someone following the monastic life, who is learned andpossesses true knowledge,Is to be honored in his place.When a layperson who has not reached the stages ofawakeningIs revered [as a vajra master],The respect accorded to the Buddha, to his doctrine,And to the monastic community will wane.The novice is superior to the layperson [as vajra master] becausehe or she is a renunciate, but of junior status when compared to themonk or nun, who is the best [choice for vajra master]. The Wheel ofTime Fundamental Tantra states55:Among experts in the ten fields,The monk is foremost;The novice is average,And the layperson is the least qualified."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 51Magnificent is the master with the power to evoke in thestudentThe adamantine pristine awareness of the state of union.A magnificent master is one who is able to evoke adamantine pris-tine awareness of the state of union, i.e., mahamudra,56 in the disciple’smind, and is therefore a crucial factor [in the attainment] of supremeaccomplishment. The primary characteristics of such a master [arereferred to] in the [Wheel of Time] Condensed Tantra 57:A magnificent master is one in whose mind and speech the faceof the Buddha is present.58As elucidated in the Commentary by the Bodhisattva59 as the model inthe tantric system, a “magnificent master” is a teacher whose speechcan instill in the disciple the experiential cultivation of the state ofunion [pointed out in] the fourth initiation (referred to as the “face”or “entrance” of the Buddha). Such a master, with the state of con-templation60 present in his or her mind, has the ability to transferrealization in the form of a blessing to the mind of the disciple. Hav-ing ascertained [the nature of] mantra, the master has attained thefirst stage of awakening. Being far superior to any ordinary spiritualteacher, he or she is known as a “magnificent master.”THE TEACHER TO IGNORE AND THE ONE TO FAVOR [IV]Avoid a master whose traits are discordant with those of a trueteacher;But since a fully qualified master is rare, follow the one who isreplete with good qualities.A teacher whose traits are discordant with the characteristics of the[true] master stands outside of the Buddhist doctrine and cannot betaken as a spiritual teacher. Consequently, even though the teachermay be very famous, active, etc., the discriminating student shouldbe aware [of these shortcomings] and detach himself or herself [fromthe teacher]. This should be done even if a teacher-student relation-ship has already been formed. If one has not yet formed such a rela-tionship, one should avoid doing so, right from the beginning. SakyaPandita states61:Detach yourself from the spiritual teacherWho does not conform to the Buddha’s teaching."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 Buddhist EthicsWe should learn how to recognize [bad teachers] from the many de-scriptions given in the scriptures and then shun them. For example,the Condensed Tantra [of the Wheel of Time] states:Proud, subject to uncontrollable anger, defiant of pledges,guilty of misappropriation, ignorant [of the doctrine],Willfully deceptive of students, having failed to enter the stateof supreme bliss, uninitiated,A slave to wealth and enjoyments, careless, rude in speech, andobsessed with sexual desire:Wise students who wish full awakening should shun such ateacher as they would hell.62Because we are living in a [degenerate] age, we very rarely meet ateacher endowed with all of the necessary qualifications. Since wemay never meet such a teacher, we should accept a master who hasmany good qualities and very few weaknesses. [Pundarika’s] Ulti-mate Familiarization63 states:In this age of conflict, spiritual masters will exhibit both faultsand virtues;Not one is absolutely irreproachable.Therefore, examine well even those who excel in virtueBefore beginning to study with them.THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DISCIPLE [V]This section has two parts: (1) the disciple to favor, and (2) the dis-ciple to ignore; and related points.The Disciple to Favor [A]This section has three parts: suitable candidates for (1) monastic life,(2) the bodhisattva’s training, and (3) Secret Mantra.The Suitable Candidate for Monastic Life [1]The suitable candidate for the life of a renunciate must be freefrom obstacles to assuming the vows.A suitable candidate for monastic life, as a general requirement, mustbe free from the four types of obstacles and unfavorable conditions(explained below) that are incompatible with the monastic ordination.The specific requisites are listed in Shakhyaprabha’s Three HundredStanzas [on the Novitiate]64:"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 53In particular, he must respect the instructor, follow an ethicalcode strictly,Persevere in meditation and study,Be conscientious, restrained, and patient,Since a good monk who lives by the monastic discipline isknown by these very qualities.A virtuous monk who is capable of living by the monastic code isknown by the following qualities: unfailing respect for the preceptorand, above all, for the tutor and instructor; the determination to fol-low strictly the ethical code by forsaking the four conditions that leadto transgression of the rules65; constant effort in meditation and instudying and recitation [of scriptures]; conscientiousness and a natu-ral restraint in character and behavior; and patience in accepting thedirectives of teachers and [in withstanding] others’ harm.The Suitable Candidate for the Bodhisattva’s Training [2]A suitable candidate for the bodhisattva’s training is giftedwith faith, kindness, intelligence,And the stamina to engage in the bodhisattva’s conduct, doesnot seek personal peace,Is energetic, and delights in hearing about emptiness.A suitable candidate for the bodhisattva’s training should have thefollowing qualities: faith in the collections of teachings on the Uni-versal Way and in the spiritual guides of that tradition, loving-kind-ness and compassion toward others, intelligence [capable of] realiz-ing profound and magnificent [doctrines], and the stamina to en-gage with courage in a vast range of [bodhisattva] practices (suchas the four means of attracting disciples66 and the six perfections67).This individual is not seeking personal peace and happiness but isworking with joy in order to liberate all sentient beings. He or she isalways energetic and delights in hearing about the profound sub-ject of emptiness. These qualities indicate that the spiritual poten-tial for the Universal Way has awakened. The Ten Qualities Scrip-ture68 states:The spiritual potential of the wise bodhisattvaIs known by its signsAs fire is indicated by smoke,And water, by herons."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 Buddhist EthicsAlso, [Aryadeva’s] Experientialist Four Hundred states69:The individual who is impartial, intelligent, and persevering,Is referred to as a suitable disciple.[To explain,] impartiality refers to freedom from bias toward one’sown spiritual tradition and a dislike of others’ traditions.70 Intelli-gence refers to [the capacity to] discriminate between the value oftrue doctrines and the futility of fallacious ones. Perseverance refersto dedication to the practice of the Universal Way. The disciple whopossesses these three qualities will appreciate the excellent virtues ofthe spiritual guide. The disciple who lacks these qualities will seeshortcomings in even the most gifted spiritual guide.The Suitable Candidate for Secret Mantra [3]A suitable candidate for the Secret Mantra is devoted to themaster and is discrete,Shows great aptitude, lives by the pledges, and perseveres inthe practice.A suitable candidate for the Secret Mantra system of ripening [initia-tions] and liberative [instructions] must fulfill all the qualities [men-tioned in the last section]. Furthermore, he or she is deeply devotedto the spiritual master and knows how to maintain secrecy on theprofound view and conduct, is free of reservations concerning theSecret Mantra, has great aptitude for understanding reality, and livesby the pledges while persevering in the tantric practice. The CondensedTantra of the Wheel of Time, the Indestructible Garland (an explanatorytantra of the Guhyasamaja), and other works discuss these qualifica-tions in some detail.A tantra of the Ancient Translation School, the Magical Net,71 de-scribes the qualities of the suitable candidate for the way of SecretMantra in the following way:[The disciple] must revere the teacher, be strenuous, be bright[in intelligence],Honor the pledges, know mantra and seals,And possess the necessary resources.Reverence to the master permits the disciple to be gradually initiated[into the tantra]. Devotion and constancy ensure that the disciple doesnot forsake listening to and reflection on [the tantras].

[In addition,] the disciple must honor the root and branchpledges [of the Secret Mantra], know the significance of mantras andseals, and not be lacking in the necessary resources [for tantric practice].The Disciple to Ignore [B]The teacher should ignore a disciple ridden with shortcomings,but accept one who, despite imperfections, is gifted withqualities such as faith.An individual whose characteristics are opposite to those of a quali-fied candidate must be ignored. The Samvara [Tantra] states72:Spiritual masters should rejectThose who have no compassion, are ill-tempered,Arrogant, unrestrained, distracted,Unreasonable, stupid, or lazy,Have no concern for the lives of others,Or covet others’ possessions.Nagarjuna’s Five Stages states73:Do not teach the graded instructionsTo those who have contempt for, try to deceive, or lack faith intheir spiritual masters;Are proud of being Mantra practitioners; are arrogant [in thatthey boast knowledge of the tantras after] having read a fewscriptures74;Fall short of having confidence [in the tantras], or havereceived [only] lower initiations.75A person replete with virtues such as faith and perseverance, de-spite having imperfections, should be accepted as a disciple eventhough he or she does not meet all of the necessary qualifications.Accordingly, the Secret Tantra of the General Ritual of All Mandalas states76:Rare to find is a disciple who lives by the commitments,Is outstanding in qualities, and has no illness,Who comes from a good family,Is inspired with faith, and follows the tantric conduct.Accept as a disciple someone with the noble traitsOf faith in the Three Jewels,Attraction to the Universal Way,And great merit."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 Buddhist EthicsAlthough ugly or uncultivated,A disciple who shows earnest interest and perseveranceIn the Secret Mantra of the joyful onesShould be encouraged by the wise master to follow that way.EXAMINING AND WORKING WITH A SPIRITUAL TEACHER [VI]This section has two parts: (1) mutual examination, and (2) the waysto work with a spiritual teacher.Mutual Examination [A]To determine whether they can brave a spiritual relationship,the jewel-like teacher and disciple must first examine eachother.A teacher and disciple who satisfy the necessary requirements arelike [rare] jewels. When they first meet, it is crucial for master anddisciple to examine each other [to determine whether they can brave]a spiritual relationship. [Ashvaghosha’s] Fifty [Verses on Devotion to]the Master states77:For neither the master nor the discipleTo damage the commitments,They must first examine whether they can braveThe teacher and disciple relationship.Further, the Essence of the Great Seal states78:A qualified spiritual masterShould carefully test the student.Just as a skillful smith will melt the oreTo determine the worth of gold,Or a [yogin] will check [the signs of] a blissful maiden,79The teacher must assess [the worth of] the student.To avoid unfortunate consequencesBoth the teacher and the studentMust examine well each other ’s character.The consequences are particularly unfortunate when a tantric mas-ter initiates disciples indiscriminately without first testing them. Anunworthy disciple will be unable to honor pledges. This will lead tothe ruin of both master and disciple in this life and the next, and theircommitments will deteriorate. The master’s own spiritual accomplish-ment will be remote, and he or she will be beset by obstacles."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 57Similarly, many detrimental results befall a disciple who fails todetermine whether a master is fully qualified and receives initiationfrom anyone at all. He or she is likely to be deceived by a false guide.Thereafter, the disciple will be unable to keep the words of honor[pledged in the presence of the master], and the very source of ac-complishment will be destroyed. Led astray on a false path [by a de-ceptive master], the disciple cannot take advantage of life’s leisureand endowments.The Ways to Work with a Spiritual Teacher [B]Those intent on liberation should devote themselves to aspiritual guide with offerings and respect, service, andspiritual practice.This section has two parts: (1) motive, and (2) application.Motive [1]The Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture states80:Wise [bodhisattvas] highly motivated to seek true awakeningFirst vanquish their pride;Then, like the sick who rely on doctors for their cure,They devote themselves to spiritual guides without wavering.Accordingly, with an unshakeable intent to seek the true state of awak-ening, the highest freedom, we should unfailingly revere [our spiri-tual guides].Application [2]Devotion [for the teacher is shown in] three ways. The Scripture Or-nament states81:Devote yourself to a spiritual guideBy making offerings and showing respect, serving, andestablishing the validity [of the teaching].Making Offerings and Showing Reverence [a]Making offerings refers to giving with pleasure presents of food, cloth-ing, and other articles that the master will like. Moreover, it is saidthat we should even [be willing to] offer our children and spouse, orour own body."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"58 Buddhist EthicsShowing reverence refers to behaving respectfully toward the spiri-tual master, by prostrating or rising on sight, expressing praise, etc.We should not step on the master ’s shadow, let alone step over or usewithout permission his or her clothing, seat, personal articles, boots,or horse; or [show any disrespect toward] the spouse. We should notlie down, slouch, spit or blow the nose in the master’s presence, orcriticize the master in private, etc. Any form of disrespect must beavoided in all circumstances.Serving [b]The disciple should precede an act of service by making prostrations.Then, while performing any daily task (washing, massaging with oil,or drying the teacher’s body, etc.), one should be calm and skillful.Establishing the Validity of the Instructions [c]The disciple should willingly carry out all the directives of the spiri-tual master and practice earnestly [in order to ascertain the validityof] the master’s instructions in whatever way is appropriate—study,reflection, or meditation. This is the best form of reverence because atrue spiritual guide is delighted by the offering of one’s spiritual prac-tice and is not [particularly] pleased by gifts, etc. The Flower ArrayScripture states82:Don’t ever become weary of seeking a spiritual guide.Having found one, follow his instructions without neglecting toserve him.Consider yourself like the earth, not wearied by any burden.Consider yourself a servant, heeding any order.THE BENEFITS OF WORKING WITH A SPIRITUAL TEACHER [VII]This section has two parts: (1) reasonings for the need to work with ateacher, and (2) the benefits of working with a teacher as taught in thescriptures.Reasonings [A]The Victorious One said: “By devoting yourself to a spiritualfriend,You will attain the full, accomplished, unique, and perfectlyimmaculate path to liberation.By trusting me now as your spiritual guide, you will gainfreedom from suffering. Consider these reasons!”"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 59The Victorious One, the compassionate teacher, proclaimed [theneed to study with a master] with this advice: “By working with aspiritual guide, you will attain the full, accomplished, unique, andimmaculate path to liberation.83 Now, by trusting me as your spiri-tual guide, you will easily gain freedom from the suffering of exist-ence. Consider these reasons and examples!”The scriptures state:Ananda, it is like this: Spiritual guides and virtuous companionsare the fulfillment of the path to liberation.Letter to a Friend states84:Reliance on a spiritual guideFulfills one’s path to liberation, said the Sage.Therefore, devote yourself to a spiritual friendAs did the many who attained peace by relying on [theBuddha as] their teacher.The Benefits as Taught in the Scriptures [B]Many other benefits that accrue from studying with a spiritualguide are taught in the scriptures.In addition to the above, many benefits of working with a spiritualguide are mentioned in the discourses and tantras. The Flower ArrayScripture,85 for example, states:Bodhisattvas who are under the guidance of spiritual guides willnot fall into miserable forms of life. Able to discriminate goodfrom evil, they do not engage in what is unwholesome. Theyshun all sources of distraction and escape from the “city” of cy-clic existence. They will not contravene the bodhisattva’s train-ing and they stand above all worlds. They will not be easily over-come by emotions and previous actions. Therefore, children ofthe Universal family, always keep these benefits in mind and fol-low your spiritual guides!The salient points of the many scriptural references on this subjectare summarized in the words of the all-knowing Drimé Özer(Longchenpa)86:The benefits of devoting yourself to a spiritual master arelimitless:You embark upon the perfect path, discern what is authentic,Cultivate merit and enhance pristine awareness, clear awayobscurations, dispel hindrances,Attain the stature of a holy person,And swiftly reach the city of freedom."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 Buddhist EthicsFurthermore, [the scriptures] mention the following benefits: we comecloser to enlightenment; the victorious ones are pleased with us; wenever lack spiritual guides; we never fall into miserable forms of life;the negative consequences of our past deeds and emotions will notdefeat us; our deeds never contradict the bodhisattvas’ conduct; andwe always bear this conduct in mind. Our positive qualities therebysteadily increase, and we achieve all temporal and ultimate objec-tives. Furthermore, by revering a spiritual guide, the results of pastdeeds [that would lead to] miserable forms of life are met and ex-hausted in this life as the experiences of only slight mental or physi-cal affliction, or even just in dreams. So vast is its merit that to vener-ate a spiritual guide far surpasses other forms of virtue such as mak-ing offerings to an infinite number of buddhas.On the other hand, if we relate to the spiritual guide in a wrongway, we may be afflicted by many sicknesses and beset by malevo-lent influences during this life. In future lives, we may experiencecountless sufferings in miserable existences. We will not acquire anynew qualities, and we will lose the qualities we now have. Because ofthese destructive consequences, the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra states87:O Lord of Secrets! How should the disciple regard the teacher?You should think of him as you would the Blessed One, theBuddha.Similar statements are found in the collection of Universalist scrip-tures and the scriptures on discipline. Thus, we should never form anoverly critical attitude toward the spiritual guide but should devoteourselves to him or her with even greater respect than for the Buddha.The merits of honoring one’s spiritual master are inconceivable.As the Guhyasamaja [Tantra] says88:There is far greater merit in venerating a single pore of themaster ’s body than in worshiping all the buddhas throughoutall time and space.The Biography of Shri Sambhava Scripture states89:By pleasing the spiritual guide, one attains the enlightenment ofa buddha.In summary, limitless virtues, manifest [in this life] and in the next,are acquired by venerating spiritual teachers. Merit and pristineawareness are enhanced to their fullest extent; all hindrances causedby adverse circumstances subside; fame and prosperity increase; andenlightenment is swiftly attained."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 61Generally, anything we do, wholesome or unwholesome, in rela-tion to significant persons such as a spiritual master, preceptor, teacher,sick person, practitioner of the Buddhist teachings, bodhisattva in hisor her final existence, exalted proclaimer, exalted solitary sage, or one’sown parents yields extremely powerful results. Vasubandhu’s Trea-sury [of Phenomenology] states90:Helping parents or the sickEven though they may not be exaltedAnd honoring spiritual teachers or bodhisattvas in their finalexistenceAre said to yield inconceivable merits.CLEARING AWAY IMPEDIMENTS TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH [VIII]This section has two parts: (1) shunning bad friends, and (2) over-coming demonic forces.Shunning Bad Friends [A]Shun unvirtuous friends who have bad characters, cynicaloutlooks, and prejudice,Believe their own view to be the best, are boastful, and dispar-age others.It is imperative that we eschew spiritual teachers, instructors, pre-ceptors, students, and companions who engage in unwholesome ac-tivities out of worldly concerns since they are not true spiritual friends.We should particularly avoid persons who give the impression of in-tegrity but [in fact] create obstacles to our own attainment of libera-tion. Similarly, we should forsake those who have bad characters andcynical outlooks; those who are strongly prejudiced, or who consideras best only their own views and doctrines; those who praise them-selves and disparage others; those who covertly belittle and therebyreject other spiritual systems; and those who discredit the spiritualguides and friends who are shouldering the burden of other beings’welfare. If we associate with these kinds of people, devoting ourselvesto or befriending them, we will become polluted by their faults andour characters will gradually worsen. The scriptures on discipline91 state:Just as kusha grass wrapped around rotting fishWill soon begin to smell the same,A person who associates with bad friends, in time,Will certainly come to resemble them."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 Buddhist EthicsTherefore, we should always be careful not to associate with badfriends in any circumstances, as stated in the Great MindfulnessScripture92:The main obstacle to [the cultivation of] any wholesome qualityis an unvirtuous friend. Hence, don’t associate or converse withsuch a person or even allow his or her shadow to fall on yourself.Overcoming Demonic Forces [B]When working with a spiritual teacher, recognize demonicforces and defeat them with their antidotes.As soon as a disciple has met a true master who embodies the genu-ine doctrine and begins to listen to, reflect on, and make a living ex-perience of the instructions, he or she may be beset by demonic forcesthat block the way. The Condensed [Transcendent Wisdom Scripture]93states:The Buddha’s doctrine is a rare gem, but perils lurk close by:Disciples of limited capacity who are beginners in the wayAnd have not yet discovered this gem’s [worth]Are provoked by demonic forces who enjoy making obstacles.The scriptures speak of four general demonic forces (the emotions,etc.94). The secret instructions [of masters] refer to eighteen specificdemonic forces belonging to three classes (outer, inner, and secret,each comprised of six). These sources also describe at length the causesthat can provoke the demonic forces; their forms, their influence, thevarious signs indicating their presence; and the common and extraor-dinary means to drive them out. In the context of our relationship with a teacher, we should recog-nize the following [mental states as evidence of] demonic forces thatwill obstruct our path to freedom: an overly critical attitude towardour spiritual guide; lacking the desire to apply ourselves to studyand reflection; nurturing the causes of anger, such as creating discordand passing time in idle talk; excessive concern with food and drink,residence, furniture, business, etc.; apathy due to drowsiness, dull-ness, and laziness; and being overpowered by infatuation and otheremotions. As soon as we recognize these negative forces, we mustskillfully overcome them by wearing the armor of these antidotes:"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 63faith in and respect for our spiritual master and companions; enthu-siasm for study, reflection, and meditation; unwavering confidencein the teaching; and freedom from distractions and unrealistic ideas.AWAKENING THE FAITH CONDUCIVE TO SPIRITUALGROWTH [IX]Moreover, cultivate lucid, trusting, and longing faith.The awakening of the three kinds of faith is the prerequisite for ac-quiring any wholesome quality and the single most crucial factor whenfirst embarking on the spiritual path under the guidance of a spiri-tual teacher. The Precious Palm Scripture states95:First, awaken faith which is like a mother:Faith will dispel your doubts, carry you across the river [ofcyclic life],And direct you to the city of sublime happiness.The essence of faith is a clear mind focused upon the conduct offorsaking the unwholesome and undertaking virtue. The [scriptureson] phenomenology elucidate the [three] types of faith:What is faith? Faith is conviction in the law of causality, the [four]truths, and the Three Jewels. It is longing; it is a clear state ofmind.Thus, [the three kinds of faith are] lucid faith, trusting faith, and long-ing faith. Lucid faith depends upon the Jewels as its object. It is aclear mind that appreciates the spiritual master and the Three Jewels.Trusting faith refers to belief in action as cause, and its results. Long-ing faith is the aspiration to attain unsurpassable awakening, whichdirects us to train on the path with perseverance. [Nagarjuna’s JewelGarland] states96:He who does not forsake the Buddha’s teachings out ofwillfulness,Hatred, fear, or confusion,Is called a man of faith.He is the best candidate for liberation.To not reject the teachings for reasons of attachment, aversion, or con-fusion indicates that faith has awakened."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 Buddhist EthicsThe benefits of faith are infinite: the attitude of a supreme beingarises, the eight fetters of life97 are transcended, etc. When we havefaith, the transcendent ones will appear before us and give spiritualteachings. The Precious Palm Scripture states98:The attitude of a great person is formedWhen one has faith in the Victorious One and in his doctrine,In the way of life of the bodhisattvas,And in unsurpassable awakening.The Bodhisattva Section Scripture says99:When the buddhas, the blessed ones, have acknowledged abodhisattva who has constant faith as a worthy recipient for theirteachings, they will appear before him and teach him the au-thentic path of the bodhisattvas.In summary, faith forms the basis for all positive qualities. There-fore, we should nurture the causes and conditions for its awakeningand growth and forsake those that weaken it. Once we have awak-ened faith, we should make every effort to strengthen it.100THE METHODS OF TEACHING AND LISTENING TO THEDOCTRINE [X]This section has four parts: (1) the preliminary steps, (2) the mainactivities, (3) the concluding duties, and (4) the usefulness of teach-ing and listening to the doctrine.101Preliminary Steps [A]This section has two parts: (1) the responsibilities of the teacher, and(2) those of the disciple.The Responsibilities of the Spiritual Teacher [1]The teacher prepares for a spiritual discourse by creating acongenial setting,Dispelling malevolent influences, and maintaining dignifiedcomposure.[The spiritual teacher has] three tasks: [(1) creating a congenialsetting, (2) driving away malevolent influences, and (3) maintainingdignity]."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 65Creating a Congenial Setting [a]The scriptures describe at length the procedure for creating the set-ting. The White Lotus of the True Doctrine [Scripture]102 states:In a clean and pleasant environment,Wearing fine, tidy, and good-looking robes,The teacher should take his placeOn an attractive and slightly raised seatDraped with various kinds of elegant cloth.andIn the midst of a gathering of attentive disciples,Without concern for material gain or prestige,He teaches enthusiastically, motivated by loving-kindness.Driving Away Malevolent Influences [b]According to the procedure described in the Questions of SagaramatiScripture, the teacher should keep five thoughts in mind103:Regarding himself as a physician,The teaching as medicine,The listeners as patients,The Transcendent One as the supreme being,And wishing that the doctrine last long.The teacher then recites the charm104 that prevents the class of ma-levolent gods from approaching within a radius of one hundredleagues.Maintaining Dignity [c]When teaching, the spiritual master does not lie down, slouch or stretchthe legs, etc., but behaves as did the Shakya King when turning thedoctrinal wheel. He or she avoids verbosity, repetitiveness, speakingin a poor timbre of voice or in a pitch that is high or low, but speaksclearly and distinctly, with an abundance of the melodious qualities[of speech]. While teaching, the master relinquishes any feelings ofattachment or aversion and remains absorbed [in the contemplationof emptiness] or in deity meditation, etc., depending on the occasion.Then, with the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings and to guidethem to the state of happiness and well-being, the master invokes arain of teachings to descend on the disciples."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 Buddhist EthicsThe Responsibilities of the Disciple [2]The disciple makes offerings, behaves respectfully, and valuesthe opportunity.The disciple has three tasks: (1) to make suitable offerings, (2) tobehave respectfully, and (3) to value the opportunity.Making Suitable Offerings [a]The disciple first prostrates by touching the five points [of thebody]105 to the ground and then offers pleasing gifts and a vast imag-ined offering of the entire universe.Behaving Respectfully [b]The Garland of Former Lives of the Buddha states106:Sit on the lowest seat,Maintaining humble dignity;Look [at your teacher] with joy in your eyes;Drink in his words like an elixir.With reverence, a pure and deeply inspired mind,Wholeheartedly bow to [the teacher].Then as a patient heeds the physician’s advice,Respectfully listen to the doctrine.The disciple does not lie down, slouch, or turn the back to the master,etc., but kneels or sits straight. Behaving respectfully and remainingsilent, he or she listens with full attention.Valuing the Opportunity [c]The [Scripture Revealing] the Inconceivable Secrets [of the TranscendentOne] states107:Rare and brief is the appearance of a buddha here,And to be born as a human is extremely difficult.But even more exceptional is it to find in this worldSomeone inspired to listen to the teachings.Now that these [unique] circumstances are present, we should ap-proach the doctrine with sincere interest and joy.The Main Activities [B]This section has three parts: (1) the master ’s discourse, (2) respectfullistening on the part of the disciple, and (3) the speaker’s and listener’sfulfillment of the six perfections."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 67The Master’s Discourse [1]This section has three parts: (1) the experienced speaker, (2) the teach-ing methods, and (3) the styles of teaching.The Experienced Speaker [a]The speaker must possess three qualifications: (1) expertise, (2) be-nevolence, and (3) patience.Expertise [i]When teaching, the master demonstrates three kinds of expertiseWhen teaching, the master demonstrates eight qualities. To begin with,he or she is well versed (1) in the subjects, (2) in the presentation, and(3) in skillful conduct.Expertise in the Subjects [A']Ideally, the teacher would be learned in all subjects within the entirecollection of scriptures. The teacher must at least be proficient in thelanguage, meaning, scriptural references, reasoning, and essentialinstructions related to the subject being presented. By virtue of theseskills, the teacher will thereby be able to resolve students’ doubts.Expertise in Presentation [B'][A learned presentation comprises three features:] (1) grammaticallycorrect language, (2) coherent delivery (which implies that the teach-ing is relevant to the subject, moderate in length, and logical through-out), and (3) a melodious voice that pleases the audience. On thissubject, the Scripture Ornament states108:The teaching of the Buddha is pure in three ways109:Eloquent in voice and language;Informative, analytic,Dispelling doubts, and reiterated;[Concise] for those who understand brief instructions,And elaborate for those who need lengthy ones.The manner [in which it is proclaimed]Is free of eight faults:Taught with laziness or unclear speech,Inappropriate, uncertain,Unable to resolve doubtsOr to confirm the absence [of doubt],Taught with weariness, or incomplete.110"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 Buddhist EthicsThese are regarded as faults in delivery.A buddha’s teaching is unsurpassableBecause it is devoid of such faults.Teachings free of these eight faults of delivery are pure in the threeways. Alternatively, the Principles of Elucidation states111:[A teacher should] incorporate twenty qualities11 2 into any dis-course in order to eliminate the eleven faults of expression.Skillful Conduct [C']Skillful conduct means that the teacher maintains a demeanor thatinspires admiration, by manifesting goodness in body, speech, andmind. Skillful in knowing students’ conduct means that the teachercomprehends the capabilities, temperaments, and predispositions ofstudents, and teaches accordingly so that the instructions will be use-ful to them.Benevolence [ii]...two types of kindnessIdeally, the teacher would have the compassionate wish to guide allsentient beings to great awakening. For the instruction to be effec-tive, the teacher must, at the very least, show compassion by teach-ing out of a desire to help others without concern for materialgain and be knowledgeable in the subject to be taught. If the teacheris lacking in altruistic concern and instead is seeking material reward,etc., he or she incurs the moral offense of selling the Buddha’s teaching.Patience [iii]And three kinds of patienceThree kinds of patience enable a teacher to spiritually nurture dis-ciples: acceptance of hardship or fatigue when teaching, responsive-ness to disciples’ questions, and tolerance toward and the capacity tomeet the challenges of others. A discourse given by a teacher who embodies the above qualitieswill prove interesting and appealing to the listeners, and it will beuseful. The Scripture Ornament says113:The bodhisattva who is eloquent in speechBy virtue of a good intellect, an indefatigable mind, concernfor others,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 69Pleasant delivery, and knowledge of proper teaching methods,With the brilliance of his teachings, shines as the sun ofhumanity.11 4Teaching Methods [b]This section has two parts: (1) an overview, and (2) a detailed presentation.Overview [i]...and includes six elements in the discourse.The Synthesis of Phenomenology states that a spiritual discourse shouldinclude six elements: the subject matter to be known, its import, theapproach to the knowledge [of the subject], finalized knowledge, itsresult, and its experience.11 5 From another point of view, [the sametext gives] fourteen elements, such as the “grouping of themes.”116Some treatises state that a teaching should indicate its purpose andinclude a summary [of the subject matter] and the literal meaning [ofthe words of the text]. Other treatises state that a discourse shouldincorporate two aspects, the general meaning and the details.A certain master of the Chim clan11 7 asserts that a discourse shouldpresent the following [three elements]: an introduction that revealsthe meaning, an explanation of the [main body of the text], and ascer-tainment with regard to both.The introduction consists of a synopsis of the [subject treated inthe] text and contains background information concerning the sources,purpose of the composition, and its subject matter. This prelude willallow the student to appreciate the meaning of the text.After the student has gained familiarity with the basic character ofthe text through the overall view provided by the synopsis, the ex-planation [of the main body of the text] is given with clarifications todispel uncertainty. Then, through analysis118 of the explicit and im-plicit meanings, the student is provided with a good comprehensionof the verbal part [of the text].The ascertainment [is necessary] because although the student mayhave understood the explanations, he or she may still not be able torespond to others’ challenges. Therefore, [the teacher] presents objec-tions based on [possible] misinterpretations of what he or she hastaught by stating, for example, that a particular point is contradic-tory, redundant, or lacks a due connection. He or she then respondsto these possible objections, thereby dispelling misunderstandings."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 Buddhist EthicsUsing logic and scriptural references, the teacher eliminates everypossibility that [the opponent’s] objection is founded. In these ways,the student will ascertain the message of the text.Detailed Presentation [ii]Alternatively, the teacher first states the general and specificpurposes,Provides two summaries which have six qualities,And then analyzes the words in terms of object, agent, andaction, and their literal meaning.To facilitate understanding, the speaker clarifies the sequenceof words and meaning by illustrating the two types ofrelationships,And in response to objections, ascertains the meaning throughscriptures and logic.The prevalent method of teaching [among learned Tibetan masters]is the one described in the Principles of Elucidation. First, the purpose[of the teaching] is stated so that the student has the incentive to lis-ten to and remember what has been taught. Therefore, at the begin-ning of the discourse, the teacher should outline the benefits of lis-tening to the doctrine (as the general purpose) and the relationshipbetween the special purpose and the specific subject matter to betaught.Second, two kinds of summary of the contents are given: (1) Thegeneral overview (beginning with the statement, “This is the over-view of the text”) presents the contents in sections. If necessary, [as asupport to the summary,] scriptural references and reasoning may bedrawn from other sources. Thus, the text is summarized in a way thatis accessible and easily remembered. (2) The overview of each topicpresents the text as a whole from beginning to end. Major sectionsare distinguished, their subdivisions classified in a consistent man-ner, and the divisions and summaries of the supplementary sectionsexplained distinctly.This style of presentation ensures that the general overview is use-ful and the specific topics of the text easily understood. These two[qualities] (utility and accessibility counted as one) along with properwords, fluency, conciseness, uniformity, and memorability constitutethe six qualities of an effective discourse. In short, a skilled teacherknows how [to deliver] a lecture that is easily understood by andpleasing to both parties."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 71Third is the analysis of the words. In Sanskrit, the meaning of wordsis explained in terms of agent, action, and object; in the Tibetan lan-guage, in terms of three criteria: what it denotes, the denoting agent,and how it denotes. [To begin the analysis of a text,] its meaning mustbe discerned through an examination of its words or terms. To dothat, the teacher must use his or her expertise in the general descrip-tions of names, terms, and letters given in phenomenology treatisesand in the specialized treatises on grammar and definitions. Once theteacher has provided a detailed and unambiguous explanation ofterms, he or she should explain each part of the contents of the textand their meaning without addition, omission, or error.Fourth is an elucidation of the two kinds of relationship within anytext (or discourse)—that between words and that between ideas. Theteacher must give clarifications (as in “the former and latter words re-late in this way”) when words seem unrelated, when their relationshipis ambiguous, or when their relationship is clear but contextually ob-scure. For the relationship between ideas, [the teacher] begins the ex-planation of the sequence [of words and ideas] by saying, [for example,]“That brief presentation can be elaborated upon in this way...” or [oth-erwise,] by clarifying [specific details] such as related or incompatible[subjects], what is to be forsaken, the remedy, cause and result, etc.Fifth is the response to objections. Concerning the difficult pointsof the text (or discourse), the student may raise questions or objections,such as, “Are not such and such contradictory?” or, “How can thisbe?” The teacher should then resolve such qualms and ascertain themeaning of the text with arguments consistent with logic and scrip-tural references.Styles of Teaching [c]For the brightest student, the teacher may explain deep and far-reaching subjects; for the less intelligent, first give easilyretained and accessible teachings,Then delve into subtle details, connections, and contradictions.Another task of the teacher is to encourage dispirited personsand counteract their distraction and apathy.For the brightest and most capable students, the teacher may explaindeep and far-reaching subjects, using precise language and a coher-ent presentation. For students of limited intelligence and lesser capa-bility, the teacher must present comprehensible subjects in a way pleas-ant to listen to and in easily retained and accessible language. Once"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 Buddhist Ethicsthe students have developed their analytical powers to some degreeand are able to grasp the relationship between words and their mean-ings, the teacher may delve into the subtle details of the subject anddelineate connections and contradictions.The teacher should encourage dispirited persons who feel unableto listen to and make a living experience of the teaching, such as ob-tuse students, the elderly, those who have only a short time to live, orthose who are able to study and meditate but feel they have no sparetime to do so. The teacher may urge them to reflect upon the life storiesof the exalted Shudapanthaka119 and others or upon sayings such as120:Develop your mind, even though you may die tomorrow.You may not become a sage in this life,But, like wealth left in someone’s care,You can retrieve your learning in the next.In order to spiritually inspire those who are attached to worldlyaffairs, or distracted and excited by sense pleasures, the teacher pro-vides illustrations of impermanence and explains the shortcomingsof sensual indulgence and the dreadfulness of miserable forms of life.To those subject to drowsiness and apathy, etc., the teacher relatesremarkable events [to motivate them] and explains the negative con-sequences of such states of mind.Listening with Respect [2]The disciple should eliminate the three defects of a jug, the siximproper ways of listening, etc.,And regard himself or herself as an ill person, [the doctrine] asmedicine, and the master as a physician.The [Medium Length Transcendent Wisdom] Discourse states:Listen with attention, listen closely, and bear in mind [what youhear]! I will teach you.These words [of the Buddha] indicate the way we should listen [tospiritual instructions] by first eliminating the three defects com-parable to those of a jug. To “listen with attention” means to elimi-nate the defect of being like a jug turned upside down. If we donot perk up our ears when the words of the doctrine are beingspoken and instead become self-absorbed due to lack of interest,or because we are distracted by something else, or affected by dull-ness or drowsiness, it is as if juice were being poured onto an over-turned jug."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 73To “listen closely” means to eliminate the defect of being like adirty jug. If we listen to the teaching with a mind tainted by emo-tions, what we have heard will not be useful to us or others, like juicepoured into a dirty jug. Therefore, we must eliminate ideas influencedby emotions such as pride or skepticism.To “bear in mind what you hear” means to eliminate the defect ofbeing like a leaky jug. If we are dispirited when receiving teachings,we will make no effort [to retain] the words [and their] meaning andour listening will be wasted, like juice poured into a leaky jug. There-fore, we must strive to eliminate feelings of inadequacy and listen[carefully].Accordingly, the Principles of Elucidation121 lists six improper waysof listening, all of which are included within the [previously men-tioned] three defects like those of a jug.The [six] improper ways of receiving teachingAre to listen with pride, skepticism,122Lacking interest, distracted outwardly,With apathy,123Or with lassitude.“Etc.” in the root verses above refers to additional guidelines givenin the same text on how to listen to the teaching: we should listen tothe doctrine while using sixteen antidotes to counteract thirteen par-ticular faults124 and relinquishing six defects: the defect concerningone’s [physical and mental] actions, of lack of interest, of irreverence,of [inappropriate] intention, of incompatibility, and of apprehension.(The last two have five aspects each.125)When listening to a teaching, we should do so keeping in mind themetaphors found in the Flower Array Scripture, such as the following:regarding ourselves as ill, the teaching as the cure for the disease,and the spiritual master as the physician; or ourselves as passengers,the teaching as a ferry, and the master as the ferryman; or ourselvesas inexperienced [travelers], the teaching as the conveyance, and themaster as the driver.126The Speaker’s and Listener’s Fulfillment of the Six Perfections [3]The speaker and the student should practice the six perfectionswhen teaching and listening.The teacher and the student should integrate the practice of the sixperfections with the teaching and listening activities. Generosity isfulfilled by the gift of words of instruction and by the offerings made"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 Buddhist Ethicsby the student for the purpose [of requesting instruction]. Ethics is toabstain from what is incompatible with didactic activities. Patience isto overcome discouragement caused by physical or verbal hardships.Diligence is to delight in teaching and listening to the doctrine. Medi-tation is to focus single-mindedly on the instructions. Appreciativediscernment is to analyze the words and the meaning.Concluding Duties [C]This section has two parts: (1) the responsibilities of the speaker, and(2) the responsibilities of the listener.The Responsibilities of the Speaker [1]The teacher concludes the discourse with an apology, dedica-tion, and sealing by contemplation.At the conclusion of the discourse, the teacher should perform threenoble activities. First is the request that the buddhas excuse any er-rors he or she has made [in the teaching]. This is accomplished byreciting appropriate words such as the following127:In the presence of the buddhasI openly acknowledgeAny mistakes I may have madeUnder the influence of unwholesome states of mind.The second is the dedication, directing the virtue [of teaching] tothe goal of awakening by reciting prayers of dedication, such as thefollowing one [from the Buddha’s discourses]128:By this merit, may I attain omniscience,[And upon defeating the enemy of unwholesomeness,May I rescue from the ocean of existence all beingsSwept by the turbulent waves of aging, sickness, and death].or these words of Asanga:Through the limitless merit I have createdBy expounding the precious doctrine of the Universal Way,May all beings become perfectly receptiveTo this true and precious teaching.The third is to seal the teaching with the state of nonconceptualization.The Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life states129:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Spiritual Teacher and Student 75Generosity that is empty of gift, recipient, and benefactorIs called the transcendent perfection.Accordingly, [the teaching activity] should be sealed with [contem-plation on] the nonconceptual wisdom that is free of the limited con-cepts [of agent, act, and object].The Responsibilities of the Listener [2]The student makes offerings, recites dedication prayers, andmaintains mindfulness.As students, we have three tasks: First, we show our appreciation bygiving remuneration; remembering [the master’s] kindness, we makeprostrations and offerings, such as a mandala130 of thanksgiving.Second, we dedicate the merits [of listening to the teaching] to thegoal of awakening by reciting Asanga’s prayer (above), substitutingthe words “listening to” for “expounding.”Third, we maintain mindful awareness of the words and meaningof the teaching, as advised in Sönam Tsemo’s Gateway to the Doctrine131:Mindful of the teaching, go to a solitary place. Without distrac-tion or apathy, reflect continuously on whatever instruction youhave received! Read it! Write it! Question your spiritual masteron all points about which you have doubts! Make the teaching aliving experience and then please your master by showing yourappreciation.The Usefulness of Teaching and Listening [D]Study, reflection, expounding, listening, and upholding thedoctrineIntegrated with living experience is said to yield limitless merit s.The manifold virtues of study of and reflection on the teachings aretaught in the Garland of the Former Lives of the Buddha and other sourcessuch as the Analysis of Discipline Scripture, which states:Persons who have listened and reflected extensively earn fivebenefits: they become learned in the subject of the aggregates,learned in the subject of the experiential elements, learned in thesubject of the experiential media, learned in the subject of inter-dependent origination, and acquire the skill to present these sub-jects as teachers in their own rights."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 Buddhist EthicsThe sutras and tantras all proclaim the merits of listening to the doc-trine to be inconceivable. Accordingly, the Principles of Elucidation132states:The Blessed One declared that five merits are acquired by listen-ing to the doctrine: by listening, you become learned, and youacquire mastery [of the doctrine]; thereby, your doubts are quelledand your philosophical views are rectified; and by virtue of dis-criminative awareness, you will gain understanding of the wordsand the profound meaning [of the teaching].Among the myriad virtues attributed to teaching the doctrine, theInspiring Universal Responsibility Scripture gives a list of twenty.133 Allof those stem from the following three: teaching is the best way tohonor the buddhas; it is the highest gift one can make to others; andby teaching, the teacher’s merit increases and he or she gains super-natural knowledge.The benefits accrued from upholding the doctrine that are men-tioned in several [sources] are summarized in the [Scripture] Reveal-ing the [Inconceivable] Secrets of the Transcendent One134:Even if for millions of eonsThe buddhas were to describeThe merits of preserving the sacred teachings[They] could not possibly encompass them all.The particular merits of expounding the Universal Way or listeningto it are described in many scriptures in the following way. In the con-text of the basis for spiritual life, the merits outshine those of teachingand listening to the doctrine of the Individual Way. In the context ofthe experiential cultivation of the path, by virtue of these merits, eachand every obscuration is overcome. In the context of the fruition, themerits [culminate in] the attainment of complete buddhahood.[The merits] accrued from spiritual practice done in order to gainrealization far surpass even those [mentioned above]. Simply takingseven steps in the direction of a place of spiritual practice while awareof the selfless nature of persons and phenomena is said to yield in-conceivable merits. To be concerned only with hearing the teachingwithout making a living experience of it is utterly meaningless. There-fore, [the Buddha in his] discourses spoke of twenty shortcomings oftaking delight only in listening to the doctrine.

[It concludes with anappended synopsis of the phases of the path in the Individual Way.]AN OVERVIEW OF THE THREE SYSTEMS OF ETHICS [I]To follow in the footsteps of saints, bodhisattvas, and buddhasIs to preserve a threefold morality, the foundation for all goodqualities,Known as the ethics of personal liberation, of the bodhisattva,and of the awareness holder.Followers of the ancient tradition of our teacher, the unsurpassableKing of the Shakyas, should first train in the foundation for all goodqualities, the three forms of precious morality established by the Bud-dha himself. These disciplines contain the essence of the practice ofthe Buddha’s teaching. The Indestructible Peak Tantra states1:When tantric adepts are renunciates,They thereby hold all three sets of vowsWhose nature is the ethics of personal liberation,Of the bodhisattva, and of the awareness holder."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 Buddhist EthicsFurther2:To live by the three [sets of] vowsIs said to be the first cleansing.3These three ethical systems are known as the disciplines of theproclaimers (Ÿr›vaka), the bodhisattvas, and the transcendent ones; oras the vows of personal liberation, of the bodhisattva, and of the aware-ness holder (vidy›dhara). Accordingly, Atisha, the sole lord, has said:The first discipline is to train in the footsteps of the saints (arhat);the middle discipline, to train in the footsteps of the bodhisattvasof the past; and the Secret Mantra discipline, to train in the foot-steps of the buddhas.EXPLANATION OF THE VOWS OF PERSONAL LIBERATION [II]This section has four parts: (1) a general discussion of the vows ofpersonal liberation of the proclaimers, (2) the distinctive features ofthe vows of personal liberation in the Universal Way, (3) the core ofethical conduct, and (4) the consequences [of neglecting] and the meritsof maintaining ethical conduct.The Vows of Personal Liberation of the Proclaimers [A]This section has six parts: (1) the essential meaning of the vows, (2)the etymology of personal liberation and its other names, (3) distinc-tions of the disciplines, (4) conferral of vows, (5) the way to safeguardthem, and (6) a supplementary discussion.Essential Meaning of the Vows [1]This section has three parts: (1) the basis for defining the vows, (2) thedefinition, and (3) different assertions concerning their nature.The Basis for Defining the Vows [a]Concern for personal peace motivated by renunciationForms the basis for defining the personal liberation vows of theproclaimers.The basis for the definition of the vows of personal liberation of theproclaimers consists in ethics motivated by concern for one’s ownpeace alone. This concern is not based simply on a desire to be pro-tected from anxiety or a wish to excel, but is an intention to emergefrom all aspects of cyclic existence.4"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 85The Definition [b]The vows themselves are defined as the intention (as well asconcomitant mental factors)To forsake both injury to others and its basis.The vows of personal liberation are defined as the intention (as wellas concomitant mental states) to forsake both injury to others and thebasis [of injury].[Karma Trinlepa's] Chariot of Karma5 clarifies the above in stating that“injury” refers to the seven unwholesome deeds of body and speech.6“Basis,” which generally carries five different meanings,7 here meansmotive, and refers to the three unwholesome states of mind8 that formthe impulse [to injure others]. “Both” (in the root verses) indicates thatthe vows include both the forsaking of injury and its basis.In brief, all of the seven vows9 of personal liberation are fulfilled inthe forsaking of the ten unvirtuous actions.10 “As well as concomi-tant mental factors” signifies that while the intention is the primaryfactor, its correlated mental factors are also part of the vows.A different explanation states that “injury to others” refers to theseven unwholesome deeds of body and speech, and “basis,” to re-lated or similar deeds.11 Thus, the vows of personal liberation can beconcisely defined as the ethics of forsaking unwholesome deeds ofbody and speech only. Accordingly, [Purnavardhana’s] Commentaryon the Treasury of Phenomenology states12:As they discipline body and speech, they are known as vows ofpersonal liberation.This last interpretation is shared by all experts on the treatises [deal-ing with this subject]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to regard theformer view as reflecting, primarily, the [vows of] personal liberationof the Universal Way and the latter as defining the nature of the [vowsof] personal liberation of the proclaimers.Different Assertions Concerning the Nature of the Vows [c]In the Analysts’ view, these vows have form.A sketch of the principal assertions concerning the essence of the vowsof personal liberation will be provided first, and then these asser-tions will be expanded upon.According to the Analysts (vaibh› ̋ika),13 the vows have form, ei-ther perceptible or imperceptible,14 and are connected to the individual"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 Buddhist Ethicsby the “rope” of acquisition.15 The Traditionalists (sautr›ntika) hold adifferent view, stating that [the vows amount to] a complete transfor-mation of the continuum of mind. The Idealists (cittam›trin) consider[the vows] to be both the seed and the continuity of the intention toforsake what is unwholesome. For the Centrist (m›dhyamika) propo-nents of intrinsic emptiness (Tib. rang stong pa), [the vows] consist inthe intention (and concomitant mental factors) to renounce [unwhole-some deeds]. Stated concisely, the Traditionalists and the higher schoolsagree that the vows have the nature of consciousness and that theyform with an attitude of disengagement [from cyclic existence] servingas their substantial condition, and with the essential elements16 [forassuming the vows], etc., serving as their cooperative conditions.[Since the above summary of the main views] is difficult to under-stand, it will now be explained to some extent. [According to theAnalysts,] in the very first moment that the vows of personal libera-tion are assumed, they have the essence both of perceptible and im-perceptible form. [The vows have the essence of perceptible form inthat the aspirant, in order to assume them,] relies on the perceptibleform of others (the ordaining preceptor, the ceremonial master, etc.17).From the second moment onward, as long as the vows have not beenviolated, they remain with the person [only] as the essence of an im-perceptible form. The same criterion applies to the vows regardingthe seven virtuous actions that have form (not to murder, etc.): intheir first moment, they possess both perceptible and imperceptibleforms. Then, from the second moment onward, they exist only as animperceptible form. Therefore, in consideration of the first momentin which they are assumed, [Analysts] say that [the vows have] both[perceptible and imperceptible] forms.[Traditionalists] assert that the essence of the vows is simply a trans-formation from one frame of mind into a new one, for example, thechange in the attitude of someone who comes to regard himself as a[Buddhist] lay practitioner, a novice, [or a monk] as a result of under-going the ceremony in which the respective vows are assumed.[The Idealists, or] “Proponents of the Aspect of Consciousness”(vijñ›nav›din), as a consequence of their belief in the existence of afundamental consciousness, assert that physical actions such as thoserelated to the vows [of personal liberation] are of the nature of the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 87mind stream. The Idealists thus maintain [that the essence of the vowsis] the continuum of the intention to forsake [unwholesome deeds]and the seed of the propensity [for that intention], which coexists withthe fundamental consciousness. This is because (they say), if you wereto consider the essence of the vows as just an intention, when theperson who has assumed them falls under the sway of distraction,unconsciousness, or similar states, their continuity would be broken.On the other hand, if you were to consider the essence of the vows asa propensity alone, they would not be lost even when violated.Centrist proponents of intrinsic emptiness, who do not accept theexistence of a fundamental consciousness, assert [that the essence ofthe vows is] the intention (together with its concomitant mental fac-tors) to forsake [unwholesome deeds]. However, Chandrakirti18 inhis Analysis of the Five Aggregates,19 a treatise on the Central Way, con-siders [the vows] to be imperceptible form, and Lord Drigungpa20and Taktsang the Translator21 stressed the same view with cleverarguments.In brief, most scholars are of the opinion that the vows at the desirerealm level (defined as the ethics of abandoning unwholesome con-duct, imbued with an attitude of renunciation) have form.Etymology of Personal Liberation and Its Other Names [2]Personal liberation is known as morality, virtue, endeavor, andvow.[The discipline of] personal liberation is known as pr›timok ̋a [inSanskrit] since it effects the individual’s (pr›ti) liberation (mok ̋a) fromcyclic existence.22 It is also referred to as “morality” (Ÿıla) as it givescool relief from the distressing heat of the emotions and uplifts thenature of body, speech, and mind; “virtue” because it is praised bythe wise; “endeavor” since its nature is that of engagement; “vow”by virtue of serving as a dam that blocks moral corruption, and be-cause it restrains body and speech.Distinctions of Disciplines [3]This section has two parts: (1) distinctions of disciplines accordingto the level of existence, and (2) distinctions of personal liberationvows according to the person."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 Buddhist EthicsDistinctions of Disciplines according to the Level of Existence [a]The vows of personal liberation, meditative absorption, and theuncontaminated are found within different levels of existence.Three categories of discipline are distinguished according to the level[of existence] where each is found: the vows of personal liberationwithin the level of the desire realm; those of meditative absorptionwithin the level of the form realm; and the uncontaminated vowswithin the levels of the exalted ones,23 the last transcending the threerealms of existence.The first consists in the ethical conduct of forsaking unwholesomeconduct, which is followed by Buddhists living in the desire realm.The second is the ethics of gods of the form realm, acquired throughcontemplation. The third is the ethics of supramundane beings, whichis derived from uncontaminated wisdom.24According to the Analysts, since the three [ethics] are substantiallyincompatible, they cannot coexist in a single mental continuum. Fol-lowers of the Universal Way, however, assert that the three ethics cancoexist without contradiction. For example, the vows of personal lib-eration in the mind of an exalted bodhisattva encompass all threeethics: the forsaking of unwholesome conduct, the ethics pertainingto the actual meditative absorption,25 and the [uncontaminated] eth-ics that are of the nature of the exalted path.Distinctions of Personal Liberation Vows according to the Person [b]The eight vows, those of the monk and nun, male and femalenovices and lay practitioners,Postulant nun, and the purificatory fast,Diversified in nature, are condensed into four types. Onlyseven meet the necessary requirements. The vows of personal liberation are of seven categories when dis-tinguished according to the person: (1) the [vows of the] monk(bhik ̋u),26 (2) the nun (bhik ̋Ònı), (3) the male novice (Ÿr›ma ̊era),27 (4)the female novice (Ÿr›ma ̊erik›), (5) the layman practitioner (upasaka),28(6) the laywoman practitioner (upasıka), and (7) the postulant nun(Ÿik ̋›man›).Another system separates the vows of the purificatory fast(upav›sa)29 from those of the lay practitioner and thereby lists eightcategories of vows. These eight categories may be condensed into"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 89four types that differ in nature or substance: from among therenunciate vows, those of the monk and the nun form one type, andthe vows of [the postulant nun and] the male and female novice forma second type; from among the lay vows, those of the male and fe-male lay practitioner form a third type, and the purificatory fast[vows]30 form a fourth type. Only seven [of the eight categories] meetthe necessary requirements for the discipline of personal liberation.There are two different views [concerning which vows constitute theseven]: one excludes the precepts of the purificatory fast [since theyare assumed just for one day]; the other, those of the vows of thepostulant nun since this discipline does not last for a lifetime, nordoes it last for just one day.31Conferral of Vows [4]This section has four parts: (1) the various procedures for monasticordination, (2) the candidate, (3) unfavorable conditions and obstacles,and (4) favorable conditions for the conferral of vows.Various Procedures for Monastic Ordination [a]The present-day ceremony of ordination was introduced afterthe demise of the original one.In the original procedure for conferring monastic ordination, the as-pirant became a monk without any complex ritual. The present-dayprocedure confers ordination with a considerable amount of ritual.Analysts have recorded ten ways persons became instantaneouslyordained as monks and nuns in the original way32:(1) Spontaneously; for example, at the moment the Buddha andsolitary sages gained knowledge of the final extinction of theemotions, thereby achieving awakening, they became monks.(2) By realizing pristine awareness; for example, when the ex-cellent group of five33 achieved the path of seeing, they be-came monks.(3) By being called [by the Buddha], “Come hither, monks!” Forexample, at the moment [the Buddha called upon] Shariputra34and others to come before him, they became monks.(4) By accepting the teacher; for example, at the moment Maha-kashyapa35 accepted the Buddha as his teacher, he become amonk."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 Buddhist Ethics(5) By taking refuge; for example, at the moment the sixty fol-lowers of Bhadrasena accepted the triple refuge, they becamemonks.(6) By accepting the eight severe precepts36; for example, at themoment when Mahaprajapati37 and others (five hundredwomen of the Shakya clan) promised to maintain the eightprecepts difficult to observe, they became nuns.(7) By pleasing the Buddha with a [correct] answer; for example,at the moment the Buddha rejoiced after Sudatta answered aparticular question, Sudatta became a monk.(8) By messenger; for example, at the moment Dharmadinna,38whose parents prevented her [from becoming a nun], receivedthe ordained community’s message of approval brought bythe messenger, the nun Utpala, she became a nun.(9) By an assembly of [at least] ten masters of the discipline inthe central region; or(10) By an assembly of [at least] five masters of the discipline in aremote region, through a four-part formal procedure includ-ing proposal39 that conferred instantaneously the status ofmonk.[This ordination] was conferred by an exalted preceptor upon as-pirants of pure mind, that is, disciples whose three impediments (ofintentional actions, emotions, and fruition40) were minimal and whoseintelligence, continuum, and faculties were ripened.41 Once thepresent-day procedure [of ordination] was introduced, the formermethod was discontinued.42 The present method, a four-part proce-dure, has been [the only one] in use from the time of the passing ofthe Buddha and his circle [of close disciples] until now. It must beperformed by an assembly of ten [monks] in a central region or fivein a remote region.The distinction between a central region and a remote region maybe made in terms of geography, in which case, roughly speaking, cen-tral India is considered to be the central region,43 and the regions ex-terior to be remote regions. In spiritual terms, a central region is anarea where the Buddha’s teachings as transmission and as spiritualaccomplishment44 are found, and the remote regions are those in whichthese are not found."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 91The Candidate [b]Men or women of the three continents are suitable candidates.Only men and women of three continents45 are suitable candidatesfor any of the eight vows of personal liberation. Accordingly, Guna-prabha’s [Fundamental] Summary of Discipline46 says:Non-humans and inhabitants of the northern [continent] of Un-pleasant Sound are not eligible candidates for the vows.Eunuchs and hermaphrodites are also not eligible to assume the vows.The scriptures on discipline, however, mention that the nagaKumaraka observed the purificatory fast on the eighth day of the [lu-nar] month. Furthermore, the Stories of Buddha’s Former Lives recountsdetails of four [animals], such as an “elder” partridge, who observedthe purificatory fast.47 Traditionalists take these accounts literally andthus believe that animals and other beings can assume [the preceptsof] the purificatory fast.Unfavorable Conditions and Obstacles for the Conferral of Vows [c]In assuming the vows, the candidate must not be bound by fivestipulations, and must be free of the four obstacles.While assuming the vows of personal liberation, the candidate mustnot make any of the following five stipulations with regard to region,time, situation, persons, and minor rules:(1) To intend to safeguard the vows provided one is living in aregion that has supportive conditions, but not in others;(2) To intend to safeguard the vows for at least a month or a year,but not longer, thinking that one would not be able to do so;(3) To intend to maintain the vows in all situations, except incase of war;(4) To intend to abstain from murder, unless the other is one’senemy;(5) To intend to keep the major rules, but not the minor ones.An aspirant who attends the ceremony for monastic ordination withthe wish to become a monk (or likewise, a novice) but makes any ofthese five stipulations will not actually assume the vows, but will atleast have participated in something good."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 Buddhist EthicsFurthermore, the candidate must be free of the obstacles that wouldprevent assuming the vows, the obstacles to abiding by them, andobstacles to their meaningfulness, plus obstacles concerning physicalappearance, explained, respectively, as follows:(1) Being a neuter person or one who has committed [any of]the crimes of immediate retribution or other [serious of-fenses], etc.48;(2) Not having the approval of one’s [country’s] ruler, or of one’sparents or guardians, etc.49;(3) Not being able to drive away crows [meaning to be less thaneight years old], or being incapacitated by [serious] sicknessor affliction, etc.50;(4) Having blond hair or deformed ears, etc.51These stipulations and obstacles, however, are not considered detri-mental factors in assuming the precepts of the lay practitioner or thoseof the purificatory fast.Favorable Conditions for the Conferral of Vows [d]This section has two parts: (1) temporary vows, and (2) vows for life.Temporary Vows [i]An aspirant who has not gone for refuge cannot assume thepersonal liberation vows.The precepts of the purificatory fast are observed for a day andmay be conferred by any person holding the precepts.The Treasury of Phenomenology52 states:Except for the person who has not gone for refuge,Anyone may assume [the purificatory fast] vows.Thus expressed, an aspirant who has not gone for refuge in theThree Jewels53 cannot receive the precepts of the purificatory fast or,for that matter, any of the vows of personal liberation.Analysts assert that any of the eight classes of personal liberationvows must be conferred by a monk. However, Traditionalists say thatthe precepts of the purificatory fast may be taken from anyone who isobserving the purificatory fast, either a lay practitioner or a renunciate.Accordingly, the Brahmana Vyasa Scripture54 states:...in the presence of one who has knowledge of the ceremony,whether it be a monk, a brahman, a householder, or a novice."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 93Also, the Analysis of Discipline Scripture55 mentions that the laymanAnathapindika56 transmitted the precepts of the purificatory fast to alarge crowd of people.In any case, the various perspectives agree that the aspirant mustassume the eight precepts of the purificatory fast before dawn in thepresence of a practitioner holding the same precepts and preservethem until sunrise of the next day, a period of one full day.When assuming these precepts for the first time, the aspirant maypromise the teacher that he or she will also maintain the precepts onthe [days of the] full moon, the new moon, and the eighth day ofevery [lunar] month. Despite that [promise], each time that aspirantintends to practice the purificatory fast, he or she must assume theprecepts anew. According to the Analysts, making a single promise [to maintainthese eight precepts on the various days of the month] allows one toretake the precepts [on the next occasion] even after having eaten.57According to the Traditionalists, [this promise] authorizes one to re-take the precepts by oneself in front of a representation [of the ThreeJewels].The main part of the ceremony [for the transmission of the pre-cepts of the purificatory fast] involves repeating the words of the pre-ceptor three times while sitting lower than him or her.Vows for Life [ii]The layperson’s precepts, the novice’s, and the monk’s ordina-tion are conferred in their respective ceremonies.The ceremony for the monk’s ordination requires ten essentialelements.The three levels of vows—those of the lay practitioner, the novice,and the monk—are conferred in ceremonies that fulfill the requisitesfor their respective level. [As to the order,] higher grades of disciplinecannot be given unless the candidate has received the lower ones.The following description of the procedure for the conferral of vowsis made in terms of an aspirant who is assuming all three types ofdiscipline. (An independent ceremony must be performed in the caseof someone who wishes to follow only the precepts of the lay practi-tioner or only the novice precepts.)The vows of a lay practitioner may constitute a “partial discipline”(consisting of one, two, three, or four precepts) or a “perfect discipline”"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 Buddhist Ethics(comprising five precepts as the basis of training). Only the perfectdiscipline of holding five precepts may be considered as the actuallay practitioner discipline that constitutes two [i.e., male and female]of the eight categories of personal liberation vows.For the first level, a monk qualified to be the ordaining preceptorfor a renunciate asks [the aspirant] questions concerning obstacles todetermine whether or not he is suitable to be admitted into the or-der.58 Then, as the main part [of the ceremony of the first level],59 theaspirant accepts the commitments of refuge and the lay practitioner’sprecepts. As the conclusion, the aspirant promises to follow the train-ing. [The ceremony] for those individuals who are assuming only apartial [lay] discipline (and are not going to become renunciates) ismodified to omit the questions concerning obstacles. To become a novice (the second level), the aspirant participates inthe preparatory phase of the ceremony for the interim renunciate.60The ceremonial master asks the aspirant questions61 to determinewhether he has any obstacles that could prevent him from being or-dained. If the aspirant is free of obstacles, the ceremonial master ad-dresses the members of the monastic community with the request toadmit him into the order. Once permission is granted, the aspiranthimself entreats the ordaining preceptor to ordain him as a novice.62During the course of this preparatory phase of the ceremony, threetransformations take place: the aspirant changes his outward appear-ance, name, and attitude.For the main part [of the ceremony], the ordaining preceptor en-trusts the aspirant to the ceremonial master. With the certainty thatthe aspirant is free from the four kinds of obstacles that would makehim ineligible for ordination and possesses all five favorable condi-tions, the ceremonial master guides the aspirant, beginning with therefuge [vows], in assuming the novice vows.At the conclusion of the ceremony, a monk [who is neither the or-daining preceptor nor the ceremonial master] measures the [lengthof the] shadow63 and announces the time [of day, month, season, andyear] that the novice ordination was received. The teacher states theten rules of the novice and makes [sure the aspirant] confirms hiscommitment to maintain them."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 95The five favorable conditions [for the novice ordination] concernenvironment, mind continuum, outward appearance, attitude, andceremony, and are explained, respectively, as follows: (1) [The cer-emony takes place] in a land where the Three Jewels are honored andwhere there are monks qualified to ordain a novice. (2) The aspiranthas not already received the ordination, has no residue of old vowsobstructing him,64 and has assumed the lower levels [of discipline].(3) The aspirant forsakes the attire of a layperson and takes on thethreefold aspect of the renunciate: to be shaven, to wear the robes,and to use the begging bowl and the other monastic accessories. (4)The aspirant’s attitude is one of renunciation, which permeates hisaspiration to become a novice (the underlying causal motive), hisawareness of having become [a novice] (the motive of the moment65),the freedom from the five unfavorable conditions,66 and the presenceof all three excellent conditions.67 (5) The refuge ceremony is performedfirst, following which the aspirant repeats three times the phrases for-malizing the novice ordination. The ordination of a monk68 (the third level) requires ten essentialelements: the Buddha, the doctrine, the monastic community, the pre-ceptor, the teachers, the aspiration to become a monk, the monasticnecessities, purity, the proposal, and the ceremony.The essential element of the Buddha refers to a consecrated imageof the Buddha placed [on the shrine]. The essential element of the doctrine refers to the doctrine as spiri-tual accomplishment, [represented by] the officiating monks’ zeal infollowing the discipline; and the doctrine as transmission, [representedby] the ordination ceremony itself. The essential element of the monastic community refers to threerequirements: The first is a quorum of four [monks] who form theofficiating group (excluding the ordaining preceptor). The secondrequirement is that the monks have the necessary virtues [whichmeans that they must be free of the following defects]: standing ratherthan sitting; deserving punishment or other disciplinary measures;not attending personally the ceremony but giving their assent to it;not being true monks; responsible for violating the vows; guilty of acrime of immediate retribution; adhering to bad opinions such as that"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 Buddhist Ethicsdrinking alcohol and other such offenses are not unvirtuous; havingbeen demoted or delegated to menial tasks; being of unsound mind(subject to insanity); not living within the same monastic boundary,but in another; being the opposite sex (a nun); and following another[religion]. The third requirement is that the monks do not behave intwo contrary ways: (1) not attending the ordination but [instead sim-ply] giving their assent to it, reporting their purity from downfalls,etc.; or (2) leaving [without permission].The essential element of the ordaining preceptor is fulfilled by amonk well-qualified in terms of steadfastness and learning, who,moreover, has no lapse of discipline69 that has been seen, heard of, orsuspected by the aspirant.The essential element of the teachers refers to the ceremonial mas-ter who is skilled at performing ceremonies in the midst of the mo-nastic community and the interviewer who is capable of covertly in-vestigating whether the aspirant has obstacles [to ordination] and theninforming the inner [circle of the ordaining monks] of the result of hisinquiry.70 To fulfill properly his role, the interviewer must be free ofthe four biases of intimacy, fear, dislike, and inability to recognize theaspirant’s impediments. Intimacy with the aspirant might tempt theinterviewer to conceal the aspirant’s possible obstacles; fear of himcould make him reticent to report them; antagonism could lead himto falsely claim that the aspirant is unfit; and incapacity to determinewhether an aspirant is qualified or not might allow the aspirant’sunfitness to go unreported.The essential element of sincere aspiration to become a monk re-fers to the wish to assume the monk’s vows with a spirit of renuncia-tion. [For this aspiration to be fulfilled, the candidate must] be at leasttwenty years of age, know how to express himself, understand themeaning of words, and be in a sound state of mind.71 [In addition, hemust] not harbor thoughts incompatible with the ordination72 or makeany of the five stipulations, or have already taken these vows.The essential element of the monastic necessities consists in a com-plete set of five articles: the three robes of proper measure (either the[robes] already sewn or material suitable [for making them], no [piecebeing] longer or wider than a cubit); a permissible begging bowl ofthe prescribed dimensions; a cloth mat and a water strainer."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 97The essential element of purity refers to the absence of the fourkinds of obstacles, and so forth.The essential element of proposal refers to the request made threetimes by the aspirant to the ordaining community.The essential element of the ceremony is a four-part formal proce-dure including proposal that is conducted in its entirety, without er-ror or confusion [regarding the structure].The ceremony is arranged in three parts: the preparation, the mainceremony, and the conclusion.The preparation serves the purpose of assembling the first nineessential elements. The main ceremony begins with the proposal, fol-lowed by the monastic community’s formal procedure of full ordina-tion. The conclusion consists in the announcement of the time theordination was conferred in order to determine who is to be shownreverence [based on seniority].73 Following this, [the ceremonial mas-ter] gives [the new monk] eleven instructions on points of discipline asaids to safeguarding the vows and developing the training related tothem. Nine of these relate to the focus of training, [the vows] received;the [last] two points relate to the person engaged in the training.74The ceremonies that confer the lay practitioner vows or the novicevows on a woman are essentially the same as those for a man, exceptfor the aspirant being referred to as “the woman known as...,” insteadof “the man known as...,” and the additional questions posed to thewoman. The precepts of the postulant nun may be assumed at theage of eighteen in the case of one who has not been married and atthe age of ten in the case of a woman who has been married. This ordi-nation is conferred by a group of twelve nuns in a central region, or sixin a remote region, through a two-part ceremony including proposal.75After [two years], at the age of twenty (in the former case) andtwelve (in latter case), the postulant becomes eligible to receive fullordination. This ordination is conferred in the following manner: Thepreceptress and the members of the nun’s community, in the numberpreviously specified, present the aspirant nun with the three robes,plus an undershirt and an upper robe [to absorb] perspiration, etc.—the attire [of a renunciate]. With the completion of the questions con-cerning obstacles, the vow for strict observance of celibacy is given.76Then the full ordination is bestowed in the presence of [the original"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 Buddhist Ethicsgroup of nuns] augmented by a group of ordaining monks [ten in acentral region and five in a remote region]. At the conclusion of theceremony, the preceptor instructs [the new nun on the twelve] pointsof discipline, which include the eight defeating offenses, the eightsevere precepts, and other rules.77 However, it should be mentionedthat the traditions for the ordinations of the postulant and fully or-dained nun were never introduced in Tibet.The Way to Safeguard Vows [5]There are two parts to the explanation of how to safeguard ethicalconduct: (1) an overview, and (2) an explanation of the differentethics.Overview [a]Ethical conduct is maintained by reliance on others, purity ofmind, recognition of incompatible factors,Engagement in the training, and relying on the conditions forliving comfortably.Ethical conduct is maintained by five methods: by relying on otherindividuals [as the external condition], through purity of mind [asthe internal condition], by recognizing incompatible factors, throughengagement in training, and by relying on the conditions for livingcomfortably.First, ethical conduct is maintained by relying on the instructionsof learned scholars and following the example of venerable [elder]monks. In particular, as soon a monk or nun has received full monas-tic ordination, he or she must begin studying under a tutor. (This isbriefly explained below.)Second, purity of mind or intention refers to zeal and conscien-tiousness in observing precepts and prohibitions, vigilance and mind-fulness in examining the state of one’s own mind, embarrassment inresponse to others’ [judgment], and shame arising from one’s own[conscience].Third, recognition of incompatible factors means [knowing] thecauses for losing the vows,78 the conditions for damaging the vows,79factors [that help] to maintain the vows,80 and the causes that hinderthe mind’s clarity.81 In short, in order to know what the incompatiblefactors are, one should study, reflect upon, and follow the guidelinesgiven in the scriptures on discipline."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 99Fourth, engagement in training refers to the observance of the threebases [of confession, rainy season retreat, and lifting of the restrictions].Fifth, relying on the conditions for living comfortably entails shun-ning the thirty-six downfalls concerning robes, the twenty-two con-cerning food, the three concerning monastic articles, and the ten con-cerning monastic sites and monks’ quarters.82The main causes for violating the vows are ignorance [of the rules],irreverence [for the discipline], negligence, and strong emotions.Therefore, as remedies to these, one applies these five methods ofmaintaining [ethical conduct] and strives to protect one’s disciplineas one would one’s eyes.Explanation of the Different Ethics [b]This section has two parts: (1) the ethical conduct of the layperson,and (2) the ethical conduct of the renunciate.The Ethical Conduct of the Layperson [i]This has two parts: (1) the purificatory fast precepts, and (2) the pre-cepts of the lay practitioner.Purificatory Fast Precepts [A']The eight branches of the purificatory fast consist of the fourbasic precepts, abstinence from alcohol, dance, necklaces, etc.,Luxurious or high beds, and eating after noon;Ethical conduct, conscientiousness, and disciplined conductencompass these eight.An individual who observes these precepts for life is known asa venerable lay practitioner.The eight branches of the one-day purificatory fast consist of thefour basic [precepts] to renounce murder, theft, sexual intercourse,and untruth, and [the four precepts] to abstain from drinking alco-hol; dancing, etc., and the wearing of necklaces, etc.; using luxuriousor high beds [and seats]; and eating after noon. “Dancing, etc.” refers to singing, dancing, and [playing] musicalinstruments. “Necklaces, etc.” refers to the wearing of necklaces, per-fumes, jewelry, and cosmetics. “Perfumes” means to perfume one’sclothes, etc., in order that they have an agreeable fragrance. “Luxuri-ous” refers to a bed made from precious materials such as jewels, and“high” to a bed being one cubit high or more; [this last rule,] however,does not apply [to the seat being used] when explaining the doctrine."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 Buddhist EthicsThe four basic precepts are branches of ethical conduct; abstinencefrom drinking alcohol is a branch of conscientiousness, and the lastthree are branches of disciplined conduct. In this context, “disciplinedconduct” means to renounce one’s previous immoral ways as a layperson to engage in the conduct of the purificatory fast. The disci-plined conduct of the lay practitioner and of the renunciate shouldalso be understood in the same manner.To these eight branches, the practice taught by Lord Atisha addstwo [precepts]: eating vegetarian food83 and drinking water [after thenoon meal] as a reminder [that one is not supposed to eat afterwards].Moreover, the purificatory fast allows the lay practitioner to pu-rify and renew his or her vows, while for one who has not assumedlayperson’s vows, it simply serves as a purificatory fast. Renunciatesneed not be expressly concerned with the one-day purificatory fast.The person who observes a life-long purificatory fast is known asa “venerable (gomi) lay practitioner.”84 Concerning this, Vasubandhustates:The “venerable lay practitioner” discipline is derived from theoral instructions transmitted by the Sthavira,85 but it does notseem to have been taught by the Joyful One.References to this [discipline], however, are found in the scriptures ofthe Universal Way. For example, Cluster of Jewels states that PrinceMind of Great Compassion took the eight precepts of the purificatoryfast for life. Therefore, in the above words, Vasubandhu must havemeant that the scriptures on discipline do not explicitly mention alife-long purificatory fast.Precepts of the Lay Practitioner [B']Lay practitioners are of five types. The first is committed tothe Three JewelsAnd abides by the three special and five general precepts.The second abstains from one; the third, from some; the fourth,from most;And the fifth, from all four root downfalls and alcohol.Traditionalists maintain that there is also a celibate laypractitioner.There are five types of lay practitioner. The first is known as the laypractitioner committed to the Three Jewels. Once he or she has takenrefuge, this lay practitioner must follow the six special and five generalprecepts related to refuge alone, as they are explained by Lord Atisha.86"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 101The first three special precepts concern prohibitions: having gonefor refuge in the Buddha, a Buddhist must not venerate worldly deit-ies; having gone for refuge in the doctrine of the Buddha, a Buddhistmust refrain from injuring others; having gone for refuge in the Bud-dhist community, a Buddhist must not form close ties with religiousextremists.The other three special precepts concern obligations: the practitionershould regard as if it were the actual Three Jewels [and treat respect-fully] any representation [of the Buddha], even just so much as a frag-ment of a votive image87; any symbol of his words, even a single let-ter; or any symbol of the Buddhist community, even someone wear-ing as much as a patch of yellow cloth.The five general precepts are not to renounce the Three Jewels, evenfor the sake of one’s life or country; to put one’s trust exclusively inthe [Three] Jewels, without seeking worldly means, however greatthe necessity or importance; to make offerings regularly to the ThreeJewels on the prescribed occasions, with a constant appreciation oftheir qualities; to go for refuge with an awareness of the benefits [ofdoing so], and to encourage others to do the same; and to prostratebefore the buddhas and depictions of them wherever one happens to be.These precepts are the preconditions not only for the vows of a laypractitioner but also for the purificatory fast and the novice and monkdisciplines.In addition to these, the actual ethical conduct of the lay practitio-ner includes the four basic precepts [to abstain from murder, theft,adultery, and untruth], plus abstinence from intoxicating drinks, thislast vow facilitating the preservation of the former ones.Depending on the number [of precepts] one promises to follow,there are four types [of lay practitioners]: a lay practitioner who ob-serves one precept alone (to abstain from murder); one who observessome precepts (to abstain also from stealing); one who observes mostof the precepts (to abstain also from untruth); and the perfect lay prac-titioner who follows all five precepts, including forsaking adulteryand drinking alcohol. According to Analysts, when the aspirant receives any of these fourprecepts, he or she simply vows to be a lay practitioner and subsequentlyobserves one, two, or however many he or she intended to follow.For Traditionalists, however, this is not the case; they assert thatduring the ceremony to become a lay practitioner, the aspirant mustassume the specific precept or precepts he or she wishes, and observe"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 Buddhist Ethicsthem thereafter. If, after having assumed all five precepts, the practi-tioner does not observe them all, his or her ethical conduct will bedisrupted.Traditionalists assert that there is yet another lay practitioner, thecelibate lay practitioner, who renounces all forms of sexual intercourse.As implied in these words from the scriptures on discipline88:Practicing the teachings even while wearing jewelry....Further, the disciplines of the celibate layperson and the venerablepractitioner of the purificatory fast [mentioned above]89 have beenexplicitly taught in the Display of Miracles Scripture. In both cases, sincesexual intercourse has been renounced, the practitioner is no longer ahouseholder, but as the [monastic] lifestyle has not been adopted, heor she is not considered a renunciate.Concerning the lay practitioner who has entered the Secret Man-tra, the Questions of Subahu Tantra states that he or she must follow allthe rules set out in the scriptures on discipline [for the renunciates],with the exception of a few rules prescribed by the Buddha [formonks], such as taking on the attire of a monk, participation in for-mal monastic ceremonies, and not eating after noon.The Ethical Conduct of the Renunciate [ii]This section has three parts: (1) rules for the male and female novice,(2) rules for a postulant nun, and (3) rules for the monk and nun.Rules for the Novice [A']Novices may incur ten transgressions of the rules: violations ofthe eight branches,Plus the rule not to accept gold and silver. With the exception ofthirteen permissible ones,The related minor infractions are the same as those of themonk.The ethical conduct of the male or female novice has three parts: (1)transgressions of the rules for the novice, (2) related minor infrac-tions, and (3) related violations of vows assumed during the [inter-mediate] ordination."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 103Transgressions of the Rules [1']The novice vows summarized under ten overt violations of thenovice’s ethical conduct are taught mainly for the sake of those aspir-ants who would become disheartened on hearing of many rules [andthus be reluctant to become novices]. Nine of these are the violationsprohibited by the eight precepts of the purificatory fast. The extra oneis derived from the transgression of the precept prohibiting dancingand wearing necklaces, that for a novice is split into two. The tenth isa rule not to accept gold and silver.Transgressions of the four basic precepts, although the same as thoseof the monk, would be only “violations similar to a defeat” for a nov-ice. The other six, failure to abstain from alcohol, etc., are minor in-fractions to be confessed. These novice rules may be subdivided intothirty-three:(1-4) The four basic vows (not to murder, etc.);(5-7) Three related to the rule not to murder: not to kill animals,not to use grass that has insects, and not to use water thatcontains insects;(8-19) Twelve related to lying: to abstain from making ground-less accusation or accusation for a trivial reason, causing aschism in the monastic community, taking sides, causing alayperson to lose faith, consciously lying, falsely accusinganother monk of favoritism, censuring the caretaker of themonastic community, accusing another monk of teachingto get a little food, defaming [a monk] by accusing him ofhaving committed a partially defeating offense, rejectingthe discipline out of disdain for it, and covering the [veg-etables with] rice when wanting more [vegetables];(20) One to abstain from drinking alcohol;(21-23) Three to abstain from dancing, [singing, and music];(24-26) Three to abstain from wearing necklaces, [cosmetics, andperfumes];(27-28) Two to abstain from the use of a luxurious bed or a high bed;(29) One to abstain from eating after noon;(30) One not to accept gold and silver;"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 Buddhist Ethics(31-33) Three to safeguard oneself from the three types of deterio-rations: [adopting the attire of a layperson, giving up themonastic attire, and despising the preceptor]. There areother ways of enumerating the novice rules.90Related Minor Infractions [2']Except for the permissible transgressions to the rules, any offense thatwould be a downfall for the monk is also an infraction for the novice,91though a minor one. Such an infraction can be remedied by privatelyreaffirming one’s intention to refrain from the act in the future. Nopublic confession is required.Accordingly, in his Luminous Commentary on the Three Hundred Stan-zas on the Novitiate,92 Shakyaprabha explains in detail how [the novice]should maintain all of the monks’ rules as part of a concordant ethicalconduct. However, the transgressions of thirteen rules for monks arenot even infractions for the novice by virtue of dispensation. In addi-tion (to explain “etc.” in the root verses), six other transgressions arepermissible according to Tibetan masters of the discipline. These nine-teen permissible transgressions of the monks’ rules are as follows93:(1) Keeping extra cloth, (2) being separate from one’s robes,(3) keeping an extra begging bowl, (4) tilling the soil,(5) Handling precious objects, (6) lighting a fire, (7) resumingeating, (8) climbing or (9) cutting trees,(10) Eating what has not been ritually offered and accepted,(11) urinating or defecating on the grass,(12) Partaking of food that has been stored, and (13) destroyingseeds.The six are: (1) retaining [cloth] for more than a month, (2)storing [any of the three kinds of food], (3) being without[one’s robes] while in seclusion,(4) [Going to the village] without informing [a senior monk],(5) withdrawing assent, and (6) sleeping in the same room asthe unordained.Related Violations of Vows Assumed during the [Intermediate] Ordination [3']During the intermediate ordination, the novice makes the vows torelinquish the attire of a layperson, to adopt the monastic attire, andto respect his preceptor. Renouncing these three by adopting whole-heartedly the attire of a layperson even for just a day is said to lead tothe loss of ordination."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 105Rules for the Postulant Nun [B']The postulant nun observes six basic and six additional rules.Once the aspirant has been ordained as a postulant nun, in additionto the ten precepts of the female novice, she must observe the [sixbasic and six additional] rules of that [ordination] for two years.Vishakhadeva states94:These six basic rulesHave been prescribed for the postulant nun:She should not travel alone,Swim across a river,Touch a man,Sit together with him,Conceal downfalls [of other postulants],Or arrange a union [between a male and a female].Further:Do not commit these offenses:Handling gold,Shaving the pubic hair,Tilling the soil,Cutting grass and other plants,Eating what has not been ritually given and accepted,And eating food that has been stored.These are the six additional rules.Moreover, it is explained that, with the exception of seven transgres-sions95 that are admissible, the postulant nun should preserve theentire ethical code of a nun.Rules for the Monk and Nun [c']The first point related to the ethical conduct of the monk deals withthe procedure for accepting a tutor.Accepting a Tutor [1']As soon as an aspirant has taken the vows of a novice or monk, heshould study under a well-qualified tutor and follow correctly therules until he has acquired the two qualities relating to steadfastnessand learning. Steadfastness refers to having preserved full ordina-tion for ten years without interruption, and learning, to eruditionpossessing the five characteristics.96"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 Buddhist EthicsIf the monk or novice is living [in a monastery] with the preceptorwho has ordained him, that preceptor will automatically be his tutor,and he does not need to perform the ceremony of accepting him astutor. If he is not living with his ordaining preceptor, he should searchfor a monk who is qualified to be a tutor and perform the ceremonyof accepting him as such.97 Then, as the sun rises on the second day,he becomes his tutor.98A tutor is allowed to be the instructor for many monks; however,he cannot accept more than one novice [into his care]. Since it is notpermissible [for a monk] to stay with a novice for more than three nights,[a novice] should not stay with the tutor but should reside nearby.Concerning the way of studying under the tutor, it is said99:Once he has accepted a tutor, the monk should request permis-sion from his teacher for whatever he wishes to do.Accordingly, with the exceptions of permitted times or activities (suchas prostrating before a nearby stupa, defecating and urinating, or beingabsent for one day), the monk should not simply act on his own, butshould ask his teacher for permission.100The teacher must offer good counsel and give teaching [to the stu-dent] in the proper way. Disregard of the reciprocal obligations101 onthe part of the teacher and the monk under his care nullify their tutorand tutored status.The Actual Training [2']The actual training is discussed under two headings: (1) learning whatis prohibited, and (2) training in the prescribed discipline.Learning What Is Prohibited [a']This section has two parts: (1) the rules of a monk, and (2) the rules ofa nun.The Rules of the Monk [i'](1) An overview, and (2) an extensive explanation.Overview [aa']The rules of the monk concern five classes of downfalls.The prescribed rules for a monk concern [the avoidance of] five classesof downfalls: the class of defeating offenses, the class of partially"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 107defeating offenses, the class of downfalls [whose restoration involvesforfeiture or confession], the class of offenses that must be individu-ally confessed, and the class of minor infractions.102Extensive Explanation [bb']This consists of five parts, corresponding to these five classes.The Defeating Offenses [1\"]Sexual intercourse, theft, murder, and lying about one’s level ofspiritual attainmentConstitute the class of defeating offenses.If the basis, attitude, act, and consummation are all present, theordination is lost.If one or more aspects are missing, a serious infraction oranother offense is incurred.The class of defeating offenses consists of four acts: (1) Sexual inter-course refers to the experience of orgasm arising from the contact madewhen the penis penetrates any of the three [orifices]—the mouth, anus,or vagina—of a living being, be it male, female, neuter, or animal, orof a corpse with at least half the body.(2) Theft refers to personally stealing, or inducing someone else tosteal, another person’s possessions of significant value. The measureof significant value in India equals the value of four hundred cowrieshells, or one quarter karshapana.103 To steal an object equal in worthto that [would be the defeating offense]. In Tibet, an object is consid-ered of significant value when it is worth one bushel of barley whenthere is no famine, or one-half bushel of barley in times of famine.Thus, what has significant value must be determined in the contextof each individual country.(3) Murder is to kill, or to induce another to kill, a human being ora foetus in the earliest [or later] stages of development in the womb104with a weapon, poison, mantra, or in other ways. [As for inducinganother to kill,] the Treasury of Phenomenology states105:In war and similar circumstances, those who share the samepurposeBear [the same responsibility] as the one who carries out theaction.(4) Telling lies about one’s level of spiritual attainment106 (saying onehas qualities superior to human attributes) is to falsely claim that one"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 Buddhist Ethicshas attained high or superior qualities not easily accomplished by ahuman being. Falsely claiming to be enlightened, to have clairvoy-ance, to have experienced signs of spiritual accomplishment, to haveseen a deity, and other such examples would fall into this category.Vishakhadeva107 clarifies the meaning of the words “superior to hu-man attributes” (Tib. mi’i chos bla ma):According to this doctrine, the five types of impediments [to thethree trainings]Are known as human attributes [mi’i chos]And their cessation is asserted as the superior quality [bla ma].108The five impediments [to the three trainings]—longing for objects ofdesire, ill-will, sleep and drowsiness, excitement and remorse, andreservations [concerning the doctrine]—are the natural tendencies orattributes of ordinary persons.109 The cessation of those tendencies is“superior” since as a result of their ending, the mental level of higherrealms is attained.A monk who has incurred any of these four offenses and has con-cealed the fact for even a single moment110 entirely destroys his ordi-nation. They are therefore known as root downfalls. No remedy canrepair these violations and thus they are known as the four “defeats”or the class of defeating offenses.Various details pertain to the downfalls discussed above and be-low: the circumstances [that determined the prescription of the rules],the negative effects [of incurring a downfall], the result, the attitude,the deed [transgression], its fulfillment, exceptions,111 cases in whichthere is no downfall [even though one has transgressed the rule], theadvice regarding them, etc. These details will not be elaborated uponin this work. Bright persons can study these details by referring tothe works on this subject by the second buddha in this age of conflict,Butön [Rinchen Drup],112 and the Great Commentary on Discipline bythe Eighth [Karmapa, Mikyö Dorjé].113 Beginners should refer to theCommentary on the Three Vows by the great translator Dharmashri,114or the Three Vows by the venerable Pema Karpo,115 or that of the masterWönkarma.116What should be noted here is that the presence or absence of fourcomplementary aspects—basis, attitude, act, and consummation—determines whether or not a downfall is an actual defeat. In the case"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 109of sexual intercourse, for example, the basis [for the act] refers to anyone of the three unimpaired orifices117 and a healthy and functionalmale organ.118 The attitude is lust devoid of any fear or shame. The actrefers to [even] the slightest penetration. The consummation refers tothe experience of orgasm. The defeating offense itself is incurred whenall four aspects are present. The offense is a serious infraction119 withinthe [category of] defeats if any one of the aspects is missing. In otherwords, defeating offenses may be major or minor depending on thenumber of complementary aspects accompanying the act.The number of aspects must also be considered in cases of partialdefeats and other offenses. If one aspect is missing in a partial defeat,the act is referred to as a serious violation within the [category of]partial defeats. For all other downfalls, if one aspect is not present,the act is a minor infraction.Simply to have intended to pursue the desire [to commit an of-fense that would be a defeat] is a minor infraction to be restrainedfrom in the future; in addition to the intention, to pursue the act shortof consummation is a downfall of plotting. In the case of insanity, nodownfall is incurred. The same applies to other kinds of downfalls. Whilemany details are described [in other texts], those are the main points.The Partially Defeating Offenses [2\"]Ejaculation, touching, and speaking of sexual intercourse to awoman, extolling reverence,Matchmaking, constructing a hut, or a large dwelling, ground-less, or trivial accusation,Causing a schism, taking sides, causing a layperson to losefaith, and defianceConstitute the class of partially defeating offenses.Any of these offenses is said to leave only a residue of the vows.Thirteen offenses constitute the class of partial defeats of the monas-tic community:(1)Ejaculation means to emit semen through [contact with] a partof one’s body such as the fingers, or a part of another person’sbody, with the exception of the three [orifices] of mouth, anus,or vagina."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 Buddhist Ethics(2)Touching or holding is to touch the bare skin of a woman120motivated by sexual desire.(3)Speaking of sexual intercourse is to use lascivious language witha woman, with words that suggest sexual intercourse, etc.,motivated by lust.121(4)Extolling reverence means, motivated by sexual desire, to sug-gest to a woman in glorified terms that sexual intercoursewould be a good way to revere oneself.(5)Matchmaking means to cause a previously uninvolved manand woman to engage in sexual intercourse by carrying orhaving another carry a message between them three times.122[Vishakadeva’s Stanzas on the Discipline] states123:The sword of the partial defeatWill cut off the headOf that monk who has united a man and a womanOr induced another to do so.(6)Constructing a hut means to build on an improper site,124and for oneself, a house that exceeds the prescribed size.The [prescribed] hut must be large enough to stretch thearms when standing; to extend or draw in the arms andlegs when sleeping; to take three strides in each directionwhen moving around, and to easily assume the cross-leggedposture. It must not, however, exceed the [prescribed] sizeof eighteen cubits125 in length and ten and a half cubits inwidth.(7)Constructing a large dwelling means to construct on an im-proper site, and with improper materials,126 a large house forfour monks or more.(8)Groundless accusation means to defame a fellow monk with-out any of the three [grounds for accusation] of having seen,heard about, or having suspected that he has incurred a de-feating offense.127(9)Accusation for a trivial reason means to falsely accuse a fellowmonk of having committed a defeating offense, justifying thison the basis of a trivial event.128"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 111(10)Causing a schism means to persist in causing a division in theorder, not desisting even though other monks have admon-ished one three times.129(11)Taking sides refers to supporting a fellow monk who is tryingto create a schism in the order, not desisting although ad-monished three times.(12)Causing a layperson to lose faith means to defame the fellowmonks who have expelled one [from the boundaries of themonastery] because one’s depraved conduct130 has subverteda lay devotee’s faith in the order, and not desisting eventhough admonished three times.(13)Defiance means not to accept the allegation made by fellowmonks when one has incurred a downfall, and persistentlyrefusing to acknowledge [and amend] it in spite of the [triple]admonishments of the monastic community.These thirteen are called “the class of partial defeats of the monasticcommunity,” “of the monastic community” since amendment dependson the community and “partial” [or with remainder] because sometrace of the vows’ purity remains.131The Summary [of Discipline]132 mentions two undetermined offensesthat may occur when a monk lures a woman...into a secluded, sheltered place.A secluded place refers to a situation where there are no other consci-entious friends133 and that is a sheltered place providing concealment.(1) If this is a convenient place for sexual intercourse, a monk mightcommit one of three [types of offenses]—a defeat, a partial defeat, or adownfall [requiring confession alone]. (2) If it is not suitable for sexualintercourse, he might commit one of two [types of offenses]—a partialdefeat or a downfall [requiring confession alone].134 These offenses are“undetermined” in the sense that it is uncertain which offense will oc-cur or what will be the outcome.The Downfalls that Require Forfeiture or Confession Alone [3\"]This section has two parts: (1) downfalls that require forfeiture, and(2) downfalls that require confession alone."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 Buddhist EthicsDownfalls that Require Forfeiture [a\"]Downfalls that require forfeiture consist of three sets of ten.The First Set of Ten [i\"]Keeping, being without, retaining cloth, or inducing a nun towash robes, accepting, and requesting cloth,Asking for cloth of a greater measure or value from two donors,and excessive insistence(1)Keeping extra cloth means to keep for more than ten days anunconsecrated piece of cloth that is owned by oneself, mea-sures one cubit or more, and is not intended for one’s robes.(2)Being without is to be separated from the three robes for morethan a day.135(3)Retaining [cloth] for a month is to keep a piece of cloth in orderto make one of the three robes that one is lacking, which isbetween one cubit long and the size sufficient to cover thethree areas,136 and which remains unconsecrated for more thanone month.

Then,having built a meditation hut and appointed a helper,177 he engagesin the practice to develop mental quiescence,178 applying the ninemethods of setting the mind.179 [Once that stage is attained,] the monkcultivates the discriminating awareness of insight180 by exercising thefour mindfulnesses181 and other meditations, [gradually] traversingthe five paths182 by means of the thirty-seven factors of awakening,183to attain the four kinds of result.184Confession to Foster Harmony [b\"]The One Hundred Formal Procedures185 states:Confession to foster harmony186 consists of five types:(1) confession on the fourteenth [day of the lunar month],(2) confession on the fifteenth,(3) confession to increase prosperity,(4) confession to eliminate misfortune,(5) confession to unify the community.The great translator Dharmashri187 states that the first of the five con-fessions is performed on the following dates:On the fourteenth day of the waning moon,Of the eleventh, first, third, fifth, seventh,And ninth months of the Mongolian calendar.188"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 Buddhist EthicsConcerning the second, confession on the fifteenth day of the month:Know [that confession should be performed]On the fifteenth day of both the waxing and waning moon;Whatever else is stated is erroneous.To explain, Tsonapa, Jadul,189 and others consider the beginning ofthe calendar year to be the first day of the waning moon of the firstmonth of winter (equivalent to the tenth month of the Mongoliancalendar) [October-November]. Therefore, they assert that the firstconfession of the year is held one and a half months later (in the wan-ing moon of the eleventh month of the Mongolian calendar), on thefourteenth of the month of the constellation Pushya.Butön and others consider the sixteenth of the ninth month of theMongolian calendar [September-October, as the beginning of the cal-endar year] and the earlier Tibetan masters such as Chim,190 the six-teenth of the eighth month [August-September]; the sixth Shamar191agrees with Butön. However calculated, “the confessions to beperformed on specific days” are to be done on the six fourteenth days,and the eighteen fifteenth days [of the lunar calendar—the days ofthe full and new moon].The setting for the confession should be within a boundary de-fined [with signs in the four directions], the large or small,192 in a natu-ral place such as a cave, a man-made construction such as a house, ora natural phenomenon such as the shade of a tree. The participants ofthe confession may be any of the five types of renunciate.The preparation for the ceremony of confession193 begins with themonks [examining whether or not they have incurred any downfallssince the last confession; if so,] they confess, promise to restrain fromsuch acts in the future, and “consecrate” the downfalls [in front of aworthy monk].194The monastic community is summoned by [the sound of striking]a gandi wood of the right dimensions.195 [Once the monks are gath-ered,] the three-part customary rite [of making prostrations, recita-tion of the Buddha’s discourses, and dedication of merits] is per-formed, and the scripture that praises ethical conduct196 is recited if itis not possible to propound the doctrine.[Next are three indispensable preparations:] (1) To purify theirminds, the monks [recollect their downfalls in the midst of the as-sembly and thus are consecrated through a proposal by the ceremo-nial master]; (2) agreement [on the place for confession or on theboundary is reached through a twofold procedure including proposal];"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 133and (3) for the sake of the community’s harmony and so that for thosemonks unable to attend the ceremony due to sickness and so forthconfession may still take place, the elder praises the Personal Libera-tion Scripture,197 [announces the date for the confession ceremony, andgives advice, while the disciplinarian reports the assent to the cer-emony given by those unable to attend.]During the main part [of the ceremony of confession], an elder re-cites the Personal Liberation Scripture. The ceremony is concluded bythe dedication [of merit] and [prayers of] aspiration.If there are no more than three fully ordained monks in that place,each performs the consecration [of the downfalls] in turn, one in frontof the others. If one is alone, one confesses verbally and mentally. Atthe very least, one should recite the three and a half lines of verse198that was the original confession formula [spoken by] the Buddha.The elder who recites [the Personal Liberation Scripture] must be dulyqualified. A monk who has been a full member of the order in goodstanding for more than twenty years is called a regent-like elder. Onewho has been a full member of the order in good standing for twentyyears is a lion-like elder. [Both of these] should be well-versed in thescriptures on discipline and self-reliant [in matters of discipline]. Thechild-like elder is one who has not learned the scriptures on disci-pline even though sixteen years have elapsed since he entered theorder. The elder who resembles the karandava corn199 is one who hastransgressed ethical conduct. Of these four, the former two fulfill [therequirements].The third, [confession to increase prosperity,] is performed on aus-picious occasions such as consecration [of a temple, etc.], or at theoccurrence of inauspicious circumstances such as floods, droughts,infestations of rats, parrots, or locusts, or the advent of a tyrannicalruler.The fourth, [confession to eliminate misfortune,] is performed inorder to dispel adversity such as hail, robbers, thieves, sickness, or anepidemic, or to ensure that these do not recur.The fifth, [confession to unify the community,] is performed in or-der to reconcile dissensions in the order.The latter three types of confession (to increase prosperity, etc.) arenot performed on fixed dates and therefore the reason for their per-formance must be stated at the beginning of the ceremony (as theproposal). Except for this point, the procedure is the same as the onefor confession held on fixed dates."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 Buddhist EthicsRainy Season Retreat [2\"]Each of the two rainy season retreats, the earlier and later, laststhree months.The rainy season retreat200 lasts for three months and is performedduring an earlier or later period. The earlier retreat begins on the firstday of the waning moon of the last of [the three] summer months (themonth of the constellation Alpha Aquiloe201 [June-July]) with themonks making the promise [to remain in] retreat for three months.The later begins on the first day of the waning moon of the first monthof autumn (the month of the constellation Alpha Pegasi,202 [July-August]). However, Butön and his followers have said that it is bestto make the pledge of the earlier rainy season retreat on the sixteenthday of the month of the constellation Antares,203 [May-June]. The sixthShamar makes the same assertion.In order to create the conditions for a harmonious retreat, [themonastic community] should do extended204 preparations to ensurethat quarrelsome monks are excluded from the rainy season retreatand that monks who are well-versed in the [three] collections of thescriptures will participate. The temple should be cleaned and [dam-age repaired] as part of these preparations. The immediate prepara-tions are [done one day before the beginning, on the fifteenth]. A cer-emony of confession is first performed, following which [one monkor several] are appointed to distribute [in order of seniority anointed]wooden sticks [to reckon the number of participants]205 and to assignrooms and beds. On the morning of the sixteenth, under [the prescribed] roofeddwelling, the monks begin the actual retreat with the promise to fol-low its rules, made by repeating three times the appropriate formulain the presence of [an experienced] monk. From that point forward,the participants are not allowed to remain outside of the boundary ofthe retreat from one day to the dawn of the following one withouthaving received permission. [For the duration of the retreat,] themonks are required to exert themselves in listening [to the doctrine],reflecting [on it], and meditating206 until the retreat concludes withthe lifting of restrictions.Lifting of Restrictions [3\"]Timely, untimely, or unexpected lifting of the restrictionsconclude the retreat."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 135This section has three parts: (1) timely lifting of restrictions, (2) un-timely lifting of restrictions, and (3) unexpected or sudden lifting ofrestrictions in the case of special necessity.The timely [lifting of restrictions] is performed on the full moonwhen the three months of the rainy season retreat have passed. Theextended preparations [to be started seven days before this cer-emony] are to decorate the temple, to inform the [householders liv-ing in the] nearby villages, and to give the concluding discourseson the doctrine throughout the night of the fourteenth, [the eveningof the lifting of restrictions]. The immediate preparations take placeon the day of the fifteenth: [these include] mutual requests by themonks for pardon [for any faults that occurred during the retreat],followed by reconciliation through a proposal made by the monkappointed [to lift the restrictions]. The main part [of the ceremony]is performed [by each monk kneeling in turn in front of the appointedmonk] while holding quitch grass207 and reciting the appropriatewords three times. With this threefold recitation, the restrictions con-cerning downfalls are lifted. Once done, the appointed monk thenlifts the restrictions concerning articles, in order that the donationsmade by the laity during the rainy season retreat may be distrib-uted [among the members of the order]. As the conclusion, on theday of the sixteenth, the monks travel around the district in order toeliminate excessive attachment that may have developed towardthe place [of retreat].The untimely lifting of restrictions is performed [either on the fif-teenth or thirtieth of the lunar calendar] when, through the force ofcircumstances, [it is necessary to end the retreat] before the threemonths of the rainy season have passed.The unexpected lifting of restrictions is performed collectively [witheach monk standing before another] [on any day] when the entiremonastic community must suddenly disperse, as in the outbreak ofwar. The same procedure must also be followed when a monk mustleave the retreat permanently due to particular circumstances.If there are no more than four monks, the proposal and the liftingof restrictions may be performed without appointing a monk to pre-side over the ceremony. If there are no more than three or even justtwo monks, a permission rite for lifting restrictions [is sufficient]. Ifthere is none other than oneself, one repeats just the main part [of theappropriate formula] three times."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"136 Buddhist EthicsThis ceremony to mark the end of the retreat is called “lifting therestrictions” because during the retreat, four [activities] that are po-tential causes of agitation in the community—allegations of down-falls, punitive measures, distribution of the offerings, and spendingone night outside of the boundaries—had been prohibited. With thisceremony, the restrictions [on these activities] are lifted.Conditions for Living Comfortably [ii']This section has two parts: (1) robes, and (2) food and medicine.Robes [aa']Robes and related articles are discussed under three headings: (1) theirmaking and distribution, (2) regulations, and (3)the use of leatherarticles.The Making and Distribution of Monastic Robes [1\"]The making and distribution of robes constitutes a basis oftraining concerned with conditions for living comfortably.Robes and medicine are the two conditions for a monk to live com-fortably. On the occasion of the making and distribution of new robes,the kathina practice208 is performed. This practice extends over a pe-riod of relaxation of rules.209On the day following the lifting of restrictions at the conclusion ofthe earlier or later rainy season retreat, the new robes made from cloththat has been donated [by the laity] during the retreat to the monasticcommunity as a whole are entrusted to [a monk] who has been ap-pointed through a formal procedure of the monastic community [toprotect them].210From that day, the sixteenth day of the month, for up to five months[the period of relaxation of the rules for monks who have partici-pated in the retreat], the robes remain in the care of the [appointed]monk who has received them according to the ceremony of “layingout the robes.” The appointed monk must not carry the robes outsidethe boundaries, or leave them in an unclean building or unshelteredplace. From time to time, he must air them, dust them off, and so on.The kathina practice is said to have ten advantages211: the monkswho participate in it212 do not incur the three downfalls of “keeping,”“being without [the monastic robes],” and “retaining [cloth],” etc. This[aspect of the monastic discipline] was not practiced in Tibet sincethe relaxation of the rules was prohibited by royal decree.213"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 137Regulations for Robes [2\"]Robes include prescribed, accessory, and extra garments.The thirteen prescribed robes should be colored by the appro-priate dyes.Clothing for the monastic way of life is of three types: (1) prescribed,(2) accessory, and (3) extra garments.The prescribed garments are not to be made from cloth that has beenwrongfully procured. The cloth should be neither too poor nor toofine: robes may be made from any of seven appropriate materials214such as wool, but not made from unsuitable materials such as camelor goat hair, and must not be shaggy or have fringe. The cloth is notto be colored by any of the eight valuable dyes that are inappropriatefor monks’ use, but colored instead in one of the three appropriatedyes. [Vishakadeva’s Stanzas on the Discipline] states215:Red cochineal, poppy, Bengal madder,Red sanders, indigo, vermilion,Red lead [minium] and saffronAre the eight valuable dyes.While,216The appropriate [colors for] dyesAre blue, red-ocher, and orange.217Moreover, as a general rule, the cloth [for making robes] must havebeen cut into pieces. As is said:One must not keep cloth that has not been cut.After having been cut, [the cloth for] any of the thirteen garments issewn according to the prescribed size. [The thirteen garments are thefollowing:] the patched robe, the upper robe, the skirt, the underskirt,the night underskirt, the sweat cloth, the night sweat cloth, the towel,the gauze for wounds, the flannel for skin rash, the sheet to collecthair when shaving, the mat, and the rain cloak.The patched robe may be one of three dimensions, large, small, andmedium. The prescribed size for the large patched robe is three cubitsin width and five in length. It may be made with twenty-one, twenty-three, or twenty-five patches [in the length], and four and a half [sec-tions in the width].The size for the small patched robe is a half cubit less [than thelarge one] in each dimension. It may be made with nine, eleven, orthirteen patches [in the length] arranged with two and a half sections[in the width]."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 Buddhist EthicsThe medium patched robe’s size is in between the sizes of the largeand the small patched robe. It may be made with fifteen, seventeen,or nineteen patches [in the length], arranged with three and a half[sections in the width].The upper robe must have seven lengthwise patches and two and ahalf widthwise sections, but may be any one of the three dimensionsprescribed for the patched robe.The skirt218 has five lengthwise patches and one and a half widthwisesections. Its dimensions are two cubits in width and five in length, orat the very least, large enough to cover the three areas.219 If this doesnot suffice due to the body being stout, one square cubit of cloth maybe added on. Generally, the term cubit refers to any of three mea-sures—a cubit [measured in relation to] a particle, a cubit [measuredin relation to] the hand, or a cubit [measured on] the body; what ismeant in this context is the cubit [measured on one’s own] body. Thisis stated in the Summary of Discipline220:The measure of a cubit is two-sevenths of the body’s height.The underskirt and night underskirt are the same size as the skirtand are worn under it, during the day and at night, respectively.The sweat cloth and the night sweat cloth used to absorb perspirationare the same size as the upper robe and are worn under it, during theday and at night, respectively.The towel measures one cubit in length and width; the gauze forwounds equals the size of the upper robe; and the sheet to collect hairwhen shaving measures three cubits in length and one and a half inwidth. The flannel to relieve skin rash measures six cubits long and threecubits wide; the mat measures three cubits long and two cubits plussix finger-widths wide, and has one and a half widthwise sections.The rain cloak for the rainy season is nine cubits in length and threecubits and eight finger-widths in width.Accessory garments refers to any pieces of cloth the monk considersvaluable that have not been stitched on the model of any of the abovethirteen robes, and that are of various types measuring a [square]cubit or more, for example, a piece of silk, brocade, or felt. Includedin this category are also [the unstitched material for] hat or belt, etc.,that the monk considers part of his robes.Extra articles refers to clothes sewn on the model of any of the thir-teen requisites (the patched robe, for instance) or additional garments,such as a second belt."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 139Minor articles belonging to the category of prescribed garmentsare items like a [first] hat, shoes, and a belt; minor articles belongingto the categories of accessory and extra are items [like pieces of cloth],the use of which should be predetermined and the size less than asquare cubit. All these articles must be consecrated by their respec-tive rituals.221These are the garments worn by renunciates on a regular basis. Thepatched robe, however, is worn exclusively by full-fledged monks ornuns on specific occasions such as when prostrating before sacred im-ages, going for alms, listening to or expounding the doctrine, or as-sembling for a monastic ceremony. The upper robe and the skirt, how-ever, are worn as general daytime apparel. These garments are not in-tended to increase the monk’s pride or other negative emotions, but toremind him of his discipline. When they have become old and can nolonger be repaired, they should be [cut into tiny pieces,] mixed withearth, and used to seal the crevices of reliquaries, or for similar purposes.The Use of Leather Articles [3\"]Leather seat and shoes are permitted in special cases.Leather may be used in special circumstances. In central India, monksand nuns were given permission by the Buddha to wear leather shoesonly when necessary in order not to spoil the monks’ quarters; and tosit on, but not sleep on, a leather seat in a place other than the monas-tery, such as the house of a layman, provided there is no other seat.In the remote regions, the use of leather shoes and beds is allowedfor monks and nuns so that they may protect themselves against cold.However, some stipulations do apply: it is not appropriate to wearstudded boots that make noise or fancy ones such as those with manycolors or adorned with gold and silver ornaments. The Buddha alsopermitted the wearing of high boots and hats in regions [like Tibet]where the lakes freeze.222Food and Medicine [bb']The four types of food and medicineAre those permissible before noon, within a day, seven days, orkept until one is cured of an illness.The foods and medicines that allow a monk to live comfortably are offour types. The first, foods that must be consumed before noon, refers to"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 Buddhist Ethicsthe five foods and five beverages, etc., that alleviate hunger and thirstand are permissible between dawn and noon, but not after. The fivefoods are dough-balls, cooked rice, meat, light mash [of flour andground herbs], and pastry. The five beverages are those made fromroots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits.223The second, beverages permissible within a day, refers to drinks toalleviate thirst, which once consecrated224 must then be consumedwithin the same twenty-four hour period. If some is kept after thattime, the fault of storing is incurred. This category includes drinksmade from apples, grapes, and dates,225 etc., as well as the whey fromcheese or yogurt, sour gruel226 (the liquid from cooking rice, millet,wheat, and so on, to which no yeast is added and which is allowed tosteep), milk, and tea. These drinks possess the five attributes of con-taining suitable water,227 being strained, very thin, very clear, and mud-colored.The third, foods taken as medicines that can be kept for seven days, re-fers to food items used to alleviate both thirst and illnesses of phlegm,bile, and wind, which once consecrated [as medicines] may be usedwithin seven days. These include raw sugar cane, sesame oil, honey,ghee, sugar [from raw sugar cane or honey], powdered sugar fromraw sugar cane, and the fat of fish, pig, bear, and rabbit.228The fourth, medicines that may be kept for life, refers to real medi-cines229 that cure illnesses [caused by the imbalance] of the three hu-mors, which once consecrated may be kept as long as one lives.230In order not to incur the infractions of “cooking [in a natural] bound-ary” or that of “a day elapsing,”231 monks should designate and con-secrate a kitchen on the four occasions.232Moreover, monks and nuns are required to regard and partake offoods or medicines in a way that accords with the rules set forth inthe scriptures [on discipline].Formal Procedures [iii']One hundred and one formal procedures are subsumed underthree categories.The one hundred and one formal procedures of the monastic com-munity fall into three categories:(1) Twenty-four simple formal procedures composed of a proposalalone, such as the appointment of an interviewer [to checkthe qualifications of the aspirants wishing to enter the or-der], for which nothing is said but the proposal itself."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 141(2) Forty-seven two-part formal procedures composed of a pro-posal and the procedure itself, such as [requesting] the as-sent of the community [to the performance of a ceremony] ina [particular] place, followed by the actual procedure.(3) Thirty four-part formal procedures composed of a proposaland the actual formal procedure recited three times, such asthe monk’s ordination that involves a request and the ordi-nation formula repeated three times [making a total of fourcomponent parts].233Amendment of Infractions [iv']This section has three parts: (1) the causes of losing one’s vows, (2)amendment of downfalls, and (3) settling disputes.Causes of Losing the Vows [aa']The ordination is lost by returning it, death, wayward views, etc.There are four causes of loss of the ordination of personal libera-tion: (1) giving up the ordination following sincere reflection [by ex-plaining that one is doing so] to someone capable of understandingone’s words, (2) death, (3) holding wayward views that deny the lawof causality, etc., and (4) becoming a hermaphrodite or changing sexthree times. The expression, “etc.” [in the root verse] refers to thisfourth condition.Moreover, the ordination is invalid if the person [is aware or] be-comes aware later on that he has assumed the monk vows before theage of twenty, even counting the months in the womb.234Scholars disagree on what constitutes loss of vows: somemaintain that vows and downfalls exist together like a richperson with debts.Others maintain that committing a root downfall destroys thewhole ordination.There are two different viewpoints concerning the criteria for los-ing the ordination. Kashmiri Analysts235 maintain that even if a monkhas incurred a root downfall with concealment, he has not lost hisordination because they consider it illogical that a violation in onearea constitutes an exhaustive loss of [all] vows. In this case, the indi-vidual is still ordained although he has broken his discipline, just as aman can be rich and yet have debts. Drigung Kyopa,236 the sixth Sha-marpa, and others agree with this view."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 Buddhist EthicsTraditionalists and the early Tibetan masters maintained that if anindividual commits a single root downfall, [the whole ordination] isviolated since the defeating offenses are downfalls that destroy the[very] root [of the ordination237]. Therefore, that person is no longer amonk or nun, and is like the palm tree [which dies by] cutting off justthe top branches.The assertion that the violation of a single vow cannot destroy theordination stems from the [Analysts’] view that the essence of thevows has form, which implies that each of the basic precepts (as wellas the other precepts) must have a separate form.On the other hand, if the vows are held to be consciousness, sincea separate substance does not exist [for each vow], if one vow is bro-ken, it is logical that all are lost.In particular circumstances, a defeat may not be an infractiondue to incapacity to maintain the rules or other reasons.Although the downfall of a defeating offense may have occurred,there are circumstances when this does not constitute an infraction ofthe rule per se. As examples, a monk may be unable to maintain [arule] when he does not have control over the functions of his body andmind, such as dreaming of having sexual intercourse; a newly ordainedmonk [may break a rule] because he is not fully aware of what therules are; or a monk might commit murder in a state of insanity.Any type of ordination is destroyed by the violation of the fourroots.All of the eight classes of personal liberation [vows] are the samein that the violation of the four basic precepts destroys the ordina-tion. If there has been concealment of the downfall as well, the viola-tion is very serious.Amendment of Downfalls [bb']This section has two parts: (1) amendment of transgressions by con-fession in the case of a monk willing [to atone for his downfall], and(2) amendment through subjugation in the case of an monk [unwill-ing to atone for a downfall].Amendment by Confession [1\"]In this case, a layperson must reassume the precepts; novicesand monksCan amend unconcealed downfalls but not concealed ones."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 143Partial defeats are amended by demotion and services; down-falls are amendedBy forfeiture, confession, and restraintA layperson who has committed a root downfall must take the pre-cepts again in order to amend the transgression. If a branch downfall(the drinking of beer and so on) has occurred, confession of the offensemust be made to someone who has maintained the precepts purely.If a novice or a monk [or nun] has incurred a root downfall and hasconcealed the fact, no possibility for amendment exists. The downfallcannot be repaired in this life, and the novice or monk must be ex-pelled from the order. If a root downfall has occurred but has notbeen concealed even for a moment, the novice or monk undergoespenances to amend the offense. For the rest of his or her life, he or sheis relegated to five menial tasks and is not granted the five privilegeswithin the monastic community.238 If a monk incurs a defeating of-fense but does not conceal it, it is said he may return the vows andtake the ordination again.A partially defeating offense that has not been concealed must beconfessed before one’s fellow monks. The main part of the purifica-tion is effected by appeasing services, followed by a ceremony to al-low the monk to assume his original status.239A monk who has concealed a partial defeat for more than a day isdemoted to a lower status for the number of days he has concealedthe offense. This is in order to purify the fault of concealment. Topurify the partial defeat itself, the monk must perform appeasing ser-vice for the monastic community for six days; if the offender is a nun,a half month. Finally, the monk or nun is reinstated to his or her origi-nal status with a ceremony including proposal [and censoring]. [Atthe conclusion of the ceremony], the monk or nun is instilled with theconfidence to resume the original position.In this context, “to demote” means to degrade in rank; “appeasingservice” means to serve the monastic community by performingmenial tasks, such as cleaning, sweeping, and so on, and to sit at theend of the row of monks.The legal procedures in case of disagreement over formal proce-dures240 (KoŸ›mbı) and the amendment of downfalls through subju-gation (P› ̊ ̃ulohitaka) are both extensions of the points just discussed,since the first allegations originated with the two cases [concerningthe dispute in the city of Koshambi and the bad behavior of thePandulohitaka monks].241"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144 Buddhist EthicsIn the case of a downfall that requires forfeiture, the monk mustfirst forfeit the article that has caused the offense to occur and thenmust undergo one day of punitive measures. Finally, the downfall isconfessed in the presence of a monk who is not stained by a similaroffense. A downfall that does not require forfeiture, a downfall to beindividually confessed, or a “minor infraction that requires confes-sion” can all be purified by confession alone [in front of a single monk].A “minor infraction to be refrained from” [one that has not been ex-pressed physically or verbally] is amended by reaffirming one’s in-tention to refrain from it.For the novice, a “minor infraction that requires confession” is con-fessed to another monk by specifying [the rule one has transgressed];a “minor infraction to be refrained from” is amended by reaffirmingone’s intention to refrain from it.Amendment through Subjugation [2\"]...if a monk is unwilling to amend, he must be subjugated.The means of subjugation are imposed when a monk is unwillingto amend his transgressions to the rules because he has a bad charac-ter or for other reasons. “Subjugation” (Tib. nan tur) means to repressor humble that monk. There are thirteen [ways to subjugate an un-disciplined monk], classified in the following way: censoring, sur-veillance, banishment, ostracism, seven [grounds for] expulsion fromthe monastery, suspension from confession, and suspension from thelifting of restrictions. When the seven [grounds for] expulsion arecounted as one, the ways of subjugation number seven.“Censoring” means that a monk who [has committed a down-fall but negates the allegation made by the monastic community,and instead of confessing] argues back, is given a warning such as,“Stop acting this way; if you persist, you will be expelled from themonastery.”242“Surveillance” means that a monk, even one who is self-reliant [inmatters of discipline], who has not restored a partial defeat and con-tinually commits it is compelled to take up residence with a teacher[and study the discipline with him].243“Banishment” means that a monk who has caused a layperson tolose faith is required to leave the monastery. 244“Ostracism” means social boycott of [i.e. avoiding friendly rela-tions with] a monk who has shown contempt toward a layperson.245"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 145“Expulsion” is the penalty applied in these seven cases: when amonk declines to acknowledge the offenses he has committed, whenhe refuses to confess the offenses he has committed, when he doesnot give up wrong views [concerning the discipline], when he createsthe circumstances for quarrels, when he becomes intimate with orlives with a nun, and when he continues to argue although a point [ofdoctrine] has been settled.246“Suspension” from communal confession and from the lifting ofthe restrictions is imposed when a monk cannot be disciplined bymeans of suspension from [correcting] advice.247“Turning down the begging bowl” is also a way to subjugate un-disciplined behavior. However, because this is a penalty against alayperson,248 it is not counted here.After an offender has been subjugated in these ways and has madehis apology, qualified monks perform the ceremony to accept his apol-ogy and to reinstate him.In the case of uncertainty [as to what offense has been committed],as, for example, when the monk has sat [beside a woman] in a se-cluded and sheltered place, [that monk] is made to investigate thenature [of the offense].249The following bases for monastic discipline are extensions of thepoints just discussed: (1) The basis related to the individual, which involves determin-ing whether or not a downfall can be amended, by analyz-ing the person who has incurred the fault of concealmentand the extent of the concealment (complemented by basis,intent, act, and consummation250), etc.;(2) The basis of degrading a monk in twenty-six ways,251 such asimposing the penances [for transgression without conceal-ment], demotion, appeasing services, and so on;(3) The basis of the suspension from confession or basis relatedto the training concerned with the ways of stating allega-tions of downfalls seen, heard, or suspected.252Settling Disputes [cc']Four types of dispute are settled in seven ways.There are four reasons for which a monk who harbors resentmentagainst someone may provoke [the four types of] disputes:"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146 Buddhist Ethics(1) [Mistaken ascertainment of the nature of things]. This leadsto a dispute in order to argue; for example, arguing aboutthe permanence or impermanence of the composite.(2) [Rejecting advice]. This leads to a dispute in order to avoid dis-ciplinary measures; for example, arguing with the monks im-posing suspension from advice, confession, or the lifting of re-strictions, and contesting the disciplinary measures themselves.(3) [Having incurred a downfall]. This leads to a dispute [to ex-culpate oneself] from a downfall, such as a dispute with themonk who brings forth the allegation of a downfall by refut-ing the substance of the allegation.(4) Not giving one’s assent to a ceremony of the community (suchas confession) due to involvement in any of the above three[forms of] dispute. This leads to a dispute related to monas-tic duties.253These disputes may come naturally to an end when, for instance, themonk who has caused the disputes dies or his attitude changes.254Otherwise, the monastic community may pursue the following sevenways of settling disputes:(1) For the first [of the above four disputes], the eight types ofevidence255 are used [to reach consensus].The second dispute is quelled in three ways:(2) The [same] eight types of evidence are used when there isground for bringing forth an allegation of a downfall;(3) The order gives a verdict of purity in consideration of [themonk’s clear] recollection through a four-part formal proce-dure, including proposal,256 when there is no [ground forbringing forth an allegation];(4) Or the order gives a verdict [of purity] based on non-derangement to an insane monk257 through a four-part for-mal procedure when there is no ground [for bringing forthan allegation].The third dispute is quelled in three ways:(5) The monk who does not recognize the [nature of his] downfallis made to analyze the nature of the offense he has incurred258;"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 147(6) The monk voluntarily acknowledges the allegation259 oncehe has recognized the nature of his downfall;(7) The way comparable to spreading straw260 is used to bringharmony to the monastic community.All of these seven ways contribute to the settlement of the fourthtype of dispute [since involvement in the first three disputes wouldprevent a monk from giving his assent to the formal procedure]. Thedispute comes to a final conclusion when [the quarreling monk] givesassent for the formal procedures to take place.Monastery Sites and Monks’ Quarters [v']The monastic sites and monks’ quarters at least should accordwith the teachings on discipline.Nowadays, it is rare to find any of the teachings on discipline prac-ticed as they were taught [by the Buddha]. However, it would be goodand fitting if at the very least the monastic sites and monks’ quarterswere to accord with the style described in the scriptures on disci-pline, since this style was taught by the Buddha himself. Accordingly,monasteries should be built on [legally] undisputed land in a placewhere there are no dangerous animals or other living beings. Theland should not be desolate, not have large salt and soda deposits, beovergrown with thorny plants, and so on.The prescribed monastery has a main temple of five stories. Withinthe innermost shrine room stands [an image of] Shakyamuni, the mas-ter of the doctrine, with [depictions of] events of his previous lives onthe side walls.261 In the assembly hall, where the one hundred andone formal procedures will take place, are paintings of the great el-ders.262 Vajra-bearing yaksha263 are drawn on the wall at the sides ofthe door and the design of the five-part wheel of cyclic existence264with the [two] verses that encapsulate the truth of the path265 inscribedon the wall of the portico. A lion-throne for doctrinal discourses standsinside the courtyard, which is encircled by an iron fence.266 Further-more, within the monastery, the ten facilities (treasury, dining room,and so on267) should be included. The monks’ rooms are spaciousenough to permit the four basic activities [of standing, sleeping, walk-ing, and sitting]. Two types of reliquary and two kinds of standard"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148 Buddhist Ethicsadorn the grounds.268 The caretakers for the maintenance of the build-ings are appointed in accordance with [procedures described in] thetexts [on monastic discipline].Supplementary Discussion [6]The supplementary discussion of related subjects consists of threepoints: (1) advice to relinquish two extreme lifestyles, (2) a conciseformulation of the ethical code, and (3) how the three levels of disci-pline coexist.Advice to Renounce Two Extreme Lifestyles [a]A monk must relinquish the two extreme lifestyles: indulgenceand austerity.Those who have entered the monastic discipline should live com-fortably. This implies living in such a way as to renounce the twoextreme lifestyles of indulgence and austerity. Indulgence in intensedesire for sense pleasures would deplete one’s store of merit. On theother hand, austerity would lead to a state of fatigue and dispirited-ness, making one unfit for study and meditation.At the same time, if [wealth] such as clothing worth ten millionkarshapana, or foods of a hundred flavors, or houses of five-hundredstories should come one’s way without any effort, one may enjoy thesewithout attachment. However, striving excessively for such wealthwill hinder study and meditation. Therefore, one should be contentwhile wearing clothes that are discarded rags, subsisting on alms,and dwelling at the base of a tree, etc. Thus, a monk should maintainthe perfect conduct of the twelve ascetic practices. As it is said [in thescriptures on discipline]:Subsisting on alms, eating in a single sitting, not taking foodafter rising from one’s seat;Wearing the three monastic robes, clothes of rough [sheep’s]wool, discarded rags;Dwelling in isolated places, at the foot of a tree, roofless abodes,In charnel grounds, remaining [day and night] in the sittingposture, and [sleeping] wherever one happens to be.269All food and clothing of a monk, whether fine or poor, must not havebeen obtained by any of the five wrong means of livelihood.270"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 149A Concise Formulation of the Ethical Code [b]If an action accords with those permitted by the Buddha, it isperformed; if it does not, it is renounced.As recorded in the Scripture on the Subtle Matters of Discipline, the Bud-dha gave the following essential formulation of the monastic disci-pline [in Kushinagari] as he was about to enter into perfect peace:Any action not specified [by the Buddha] as permissible or prohib-ited needs to be evaluated with reasoning and then performed or re-nounced accordingly. [Evaluation is done in this way:] if an actionaccords with those permitted by the Buddha and is verified to beappropriate, it should be performed without any reservations. Forinstance, Buddha prescribed the lifting of restrictions ceremony fornovices; from this, [one can infer] that novices may also participate inthe confession ceremony.An action that resembles those prohibited [by the Buddha] and isverified to be inappropriate must always be renounced. For example,because a silk mat was prohibited, it is therefore inappropriate to makea mat from a material equal or finer in quality than silk.How the Three Disciplines Coexist in an Individual [c]Analysts believe that the three disciplines have form and aresubstantially different;Centrists assert them to be consciousness, the former trans-formed into the latter ones.Once a person has assumed and is maintaining the three levels ofdiscipline [layperson, novice, and monk or nun] discussed above, inwhat way do these three coexist? Do these exist each with a differ-ent or with an identical essence, or does the former level change intothe next?According to the Analysts who believe [the levels of discipline] tobe form, each level exists simultaneously and is substantially differ-ent in the mind of a monk who has received them sequentially. Theysubstantiate this view by stating that within the continuum of thatmonk, each level of discipline exists with a substantially different formbecause he has received the three disciplines through their respectiveprocedures and he has not lost them through any cause."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 Buddhist EthicsAccording to the Centrists and others who believe the levels ofdiscipline to be consciousness, the levels neither exist simulta-neously nor with different natures in the mind of the monk whohas received them sequentially. They substantiate this view by say-ing that if this were the case, three substantially different attitudesof renunciation would exist simultaneously in the sphere of a singleprimary mind, which is illogical. Moreover, they assert that thelevels of discipline are not substantially identical since in a singlecontinuum these three are mutually exclusive. This being the case,[it follows that] in the continuum of a monk, the former levels ofdiscipline transform into the latter ones, becoming increasinglyadvanced in terms of the essence [of the ethical training], etc. Whena layperson receives the vows of novice and then those of a monk,at those times, the former disciplines become the essence of thelatter ones. This is comparable to the path of accumulation trans-forming into the path of preparation, and that path into the pathof seeing. Therefore, although a full-fledged monk has receivedand not damaged the novice ordination, it is illogical to assert thathe still has the novice vows. This is because in the continuum of amonk, the three disciplines are neither substantially different formsnor substantially different in the nature of consciousness; neitherdo the two disciplines [that of a novice and that of a monk] existsimultaneously and with an identical nature [in the mind of amonk].The Distinctive Features of the Vows of Personal Liberation inthe Universal Way [B]The distinctive features of the personal liberation vows of the Uni-versal Way are explained in seven parts: (1) awakening mind, (2) cer-emony, (3) preceptor, (4) candidate, (5) permissible transgressions tothe rules, (6) amendment of downfalls, and (7) the criterion for loss ofthe vows.Awakening Mind [1]Individualists’ vows of personal liberation become Universalists’If assumed with an altruistic motive to attain enlightenment,Or even when the mind of awakening arises afterwards.The exclusive and extensive procedure for the conferral of Universal-ists’ vows of personal liberation was never introduced into Tibet."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 151However, [one can still receive such ordination without that proce-dure] as is indicated in the Three Hundred Stanzas [on the Novitiate]271:Engendering the glorious intention to reach full awakening isthe bestowal of power.[and in its commentary,] Luminous272:[The intention to reach] full awakening is glorious because it isthe seed [that develops into] the enlightened deeds of a Dharmasovereign. Power is bestowed273 in order to attain that [state].Accordingly, the proclaimers’ personal liberation vows themselves,received with an altruistic intention, form the basis of the characteris-tics of the Universalists’ vows of personal liberation. If at the time ofreceiving the Individualists’ vows, one’s objective is to attain fullawakening for the benefit of others, the vows become Universalists’vows. This is the case even if this was not one’s objective at that time,but one develops the resolve to awaken afterwards.The Ceremony [2]Universalists’ vows are received in the course of proclaimers’ceremonies,In special ceremonies such as the one for taking the vows ofpurification-renewal,And in higher rites, the one for the formation of the awakeningmind, the preparatory part of a tantric initiation, etc. The Universalists’ precepts of personal liberation are conferred inthree types of ceremonies:(1) The Universalists’ ceremonies that are undifferentiated fromthose of the proclaimers’ system, which are the ceremoniesof the eight classes [of vows], performed according to theproclaimers’ system, but received with the attitude of theUniversal Way, the resolve to awaken.(2) Special ceremonies, which include the ceremonies of the pastby which Maitreya, Manjushri, and others conferred full ordi-nation on many persons, and the ceremonies of the present day,such as the procedure for taking the precepts of purification-renewal274 as discussed in the Amoghapasha [Scripture].275(3) Higher rites, which include the rite for assuming the commit-ment of the aspiration [for complete awakening], the prepara-tory part of a tantric empowerment, and other rites, which[among their precepts] confer the vows of personal liberation."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 Buddhist EthicsThe Preceptor [3]The preceptor may be a renunciate or a lay practitioner.The vows common [to both the Individual and Universal Ways] mustbe received from a duly qualified member of the monastic commu-nity. The special precepts such as the purification-renewal (as is dis-cussed in the Display of Miracles Scripture) may, however, be takenfrom a lay practitioner who has the same precepts, not exclusivelyfrom an ordained person.The Candidate [4]The candidate must fulfill the same qualifications specified forthe proclaimers’ system;But anyone ready to make the resolve to awaken is eligible toreceive these precepts during special ceremonies.The candidate who receives any of the Universalists’ vows of per-sonal liberation in the course of the ceremony of the proclaimers’ tra-dition must fulfill [the qualifications] described in the proclaimers’system. However, anyone who is ready to form the awakening mindcharacteristic of the Universal Way is a suitable candidate to receivethese types of precepts during the special [Universalists’] ceremonies.Permissible Transgressions of the Rules [5]In a case of special necessity, even the seven unvirtuous acts arepermissible.The ethical conduct related to any kind of personal liberation vowsreceived in the course of a common ceremony must be maintainedjust as it is by the proclaimers unless there is a special necessity fornot doing so. This is very important because an unnecessary trans-gression of the rules of this dual ordination is reckoned as a downfallin the context of the commitments of the Indestructible Way (vajray›na).However, when there is a special purpose—to benefit others, for in-stance—it is permissible to commit the seven verbal and physicalunvirtuous actions that are normally prohibited. Accordingly, theGuide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life states276:The Compassionate One, in his broad vision,Gave permission even for what is prohibited.For someone performing the purification-renewal of the UniversalWay, having taken by himself or herself the precepts in accordance"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 153with the special ceremony, the [vows] to be maintained are identicalto those of the common purificatory fast.Amendment of Downfalls [6]Concealed downfalls may be confessed and ordination retaken.Secondary downfalls are amended by confession, sustained bythe four forces.Downfalls are purified by attitude, not by penances.Most of the masters of discipline maintain that a monk cannot re-take his vows if he has assumed Universalists’ vows in the course ofa ceremony undifferentiated from that of the proclaimers and he hascommitted a defeating offense with concealment. This view is goodbecause it is conducive to strict maintenance [of discipline].However, Lord Trinlepa277 and others have stated that a root down-fall may be repaired by confession accompanied by regret and by re-taking the vows, regardless of whether the downfall was concealedor not. This is possible because these vows have been taken with thealtruistic mind of awakening. Moreover, these masters taught that asecondary downfall may be purified by amending it with sincere con-fession sustained by the four forces.278With regard to the amendment of downfalls, it must be said that ifone has strong regret, embarrassment, and shame, all transgressionscan be purified. When these [dispositions] are missing, however,downfalls cannot be purified simply by undergoing penances. In con-sideration of this, it is said [in the Commentary on the Summary of Dis-cipline] that a person who has great shame or someone who is a mas-ter of the three collections of scriptures may purify all offenses sim-ply by confessing them [in front of a fellow monk, without undergo-ing disciplinary measures].The Criterion for Loss of the Vows [7]The vows are lost through wayward views, defeating offenses,or by returning them;No other condition can destroy them.The vows are lost when the root of one’s virtue is cut by harboringwayward views, committing a defeating offense, or giving back theordination. The vows are not lost through any other circumstances(such as death and sex-change) because both offenses and vows [inthis system] are asserted to be of the nature of consciousness."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 Buddhist EthicsThe Core of Ethical Conduct [C]In brief, the purport of all the scriptures on discipline iscontained in these words:Abandon negative actions, cultivate virtue, and discipline themind.All the above-mentioned ethical codes may be formulated in the fol-lowing instructions: Renounce all negative actions that are naturallyunwholesome or unwholesome due to [Buddha’s] prescription. Cul-tivate all virtuous and wholesome physical, verbal, and mental quali-ties. With the remedies of mindfulness and awareness, strive to tameyour mind, which is the root of all virtue and evil and is liable to beoverpowered by thoughts. The point of all the scriptures on disci-pline is thus summarized in the verses of the original confession279:Commit no evil,Engage in excellent virtue,Fully tame your mind:This is Buddha’s teaching.Consequences of Neglecting and Merits of Maintaining EthicalConduct [D]Violation of ethical conduct bears serious consequences,While pure ethics serve as the foundation and condition for allvirtue.Violation of the ethical conduct to which one has committed oneselfbears very serious [consequences] and hinders the development ofone’s spiritual qualities. Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture states280:Whoever damages or destroys his ethics will have no affinity fora spiritual life for up to ten million lifetimes. He forsakes all hap-piness and experiences great misery.The scriptures on discipline list the negative consequences of violat-ing ethical conduct, including the following:You will never hear the true teachingAnd quickly forget what you have learned.Thus, you will not realize the stages and paths [of awakening].Even a minor offense can lead to a major consequence. Thus, it isnecessary to follow also the minor rules. Accordingly, the scriptureson discipline state:"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 155Whoever lightly regards the doctrine of the compassionateteacherAnd transgresses as much as a minor dictateWill be oppressed by misery,Just as in cutting down the bamboo thicketOne also destroys the mango grove.Although a subject may have disobeyed his king’s laws atvarious times,He may still escape punishment,But if one disregards the advice of the Sage,One will be born as an animal such as the naga Elapatra.281In brief, it is stated in the scriptures that a monk or nun who hastransgressed the rules by committing a defeat, partial defeat, seriousviolation, downfall [involving forfeiture or confession alone], offensethat must be confessed individually, or minor infraction, will be re-born in one of the hells from the Hot Hell up to the Reviving Hell,respectively.On the other hand, a pure ethical conduct serves as the basisand as a condition for the development of all knowledge and spiri-tual accomplishment [that is the fruition] of all Buddhist paths.Nagarjuna’s Letter to a Friend states282:Ethical conduct was proclaimed to be the foundation of allvirtue,Just as the earth is the foundation of the animate and inanimate.The Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture lists the many benefits ofethics, for example283:One who maintains ethical conduct is praised by all.Vishakhadeva stated284:Ethical conduct yields magnificent fruit:Highest praise, abundance of wealth,Birth in the celestial residences of the gods,The state of contemplation, and emergence from cyclic existence.The Valuable for Monks Scripture states:He who believes in ethicsCreates boundless meritEven during a single dayAnd eventually attains the goal of full awakening.Now that the doctrine is in decline, to preserve a single aspect ofethics for even a day has far greater merit than was accrued through"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 Buddhist Ethicsmaintaining ethical conduct, pure in all aspects, for incalculable yearsduring the initial propagation of the doctrine.

Generally, all subjects concerned with monastic disciplineare contained within Asanga’s presentation286 of four points: (1) for-mation of the monastic community, (2) establishing the communityin the disciplinary code, (3) providing conditions for each member tolive comfortably, and (4) creating the incentive for others to enter intoa life of peace and happiness in the future.Formation of the Monastic Community [1]Formation of the community refers to the [Buddha’s gathering of]four classes of followers287 who with faith have become renunciates,leaving home to embrace the homeless life, by receiving the full ordi-nation according to the original or present-day procedure.288Establishing the Community in the Disciplinary Code [2]Establishing the disciplinary code refers to the expounding of thedoctrine by means of the basis of training (the reason for the pre-scribed ethical conduct, etc.), and by means of renunciation, teach-ing, subduing, and display of miraculous abilities.289"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 157Providing the Conditions for Living Comfortably [3][Asanga explains] this subject in five points: The first point concernsthe monastic necessities that serve as conditions for a monk to livecomfortably. [The Buddha] specified that all monastic necessities mustbe acquired licitly, without resorting to devious means, and unpol-luted by transgressions of the rules [regarding their use]. The monkshould use these in a manner that does not succumb to either of thetwo extremes of indulgence and austerity. The necessities include fourtypes of foods (called “medicines”) to be consumed, respectively, be-fore noon, within a day, within seven days, and until one is cured ofan illness; the four types of garments (prescribed, accessory, extra,and minor); other prescribed and indispensable monastic articles (beg-ging bowl, water strainer, etc.); living quarters, including the monas-tery buildings, individual cells, dwellings at the foot of a tree, seats,bed, bedding, etc.The second point concerns the measures used to discipline a monkwhose behavior goes against the Buddha’s teaching. This includesdismissal from the order of a monk who has committed a defeatingoffense that cannot be purified; other disciplinary measures to pre-vent a monk from perpetuating his misconduct; and amendment ofdownfalls by testimony, reminders, and the ways to settle disputes.The third point involves dispelling despair through these fifteenmeans: [recognizing] the five types of despair, [adopting] the five-limbed conscientiousness, and thinking in five ways that help dispeldespair.290The fourth point consists in subduing strong emotional entangle-ment by observing the five-limbed method to maintain ethical conduct:(1) Maintaining [the rules concerning] the conditions for liv-ing comfortably (the prescribed food, robes, articles, livingquarters);(2) Studying with a teacher, that is, obeying the instructions ofthe tutor, or of the elders, who are masters of the three collec-tions of the scriptures;(3) Recognition of factors incompatible with ethical conduct,which is to know the means to eliminate the conditions lead-ing to five classes of transgressions of the rules, regardless ofwhether they are serious or light;(4) Meticulous observance of ethical conduct, which means toattend regularly the confession, the rainy season retreat, andthe lifting of restrictions; and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158 Buddhist Ethics(5) Excellent attitude and application. Excellence of attitude re-fers to virtues such as faith, compassion, intelligence, mind-fulness, alertness, shame, embarrassment, and conscientious-ness.291 These eight attitudes serve as preconditions for anexcellent application of ethical conduct, in which one devel-ops the following six foundations of the training:(1)the discipline that is indispensable in the beginning,which means having an excellent attitude;(2)diligent practice of the four means to prevent the oc-currence of transgressions of the rules292;(3)elimination of the five factors incompatible with thetraining293;(4)reliance on the five conducive ones294;(5)familiarity with the five topics to be known295; and(6)familiarity with the five factors that foster peace.296In addition, to maintain ethical conduct, a renunciate must possessthe five qualities of a monk who is faithful to his discipline297 and thefive strengths.298Concerning the way to cultivate ethical conduct excellent in bothattitude and application, the scriptures state:Whether you are an elder, a monk or nun of some years stand-ing, or newly ordained, you should always consider yourself arenunciate and should always consider the Buddha, the BlessedOne who is your guide, as your protector. [With such consider-ations,] set as your goal perfect peace, observe the bases of train-ing in discipline just as they were prescribed, and work towardthe realization of ultimate truth.The fifth point299 concerns the abandonment of latent emotions.300To accomplish this, the monk engages in the purification-renewal todevelop mental quiescence, which consists in the practice of [the vari-ous stages of] meditation. He first asks a master experienced in medi-tation [for instructions]. The master makes sure that the beginner isfree of four obstacles and examines well his four conditions.301 [Onceaccepted,] the monk then applies himself to the five points: maintain-ing and creating the conditions for contemplation,302 perfect seclu-sion,303 intense concentration,304 removing impediments,305 and thecultivation of mental contemplation.306"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Vows of Personal Liberation 159With discriminative meditations, such as the discernment of theaspects of grossness and peacefulness,307 the practitioner becomes freefrom the desires related to the worldly paths,308 and strives in themental quiescence in which the compositional factors of the body andthe three times are analyzed. These discriminative meditations andmeditation on the thirty-seven aspects of awakening (including thefour forms of mindfulness309) lead the practitioner through the eightstages (beginning with the one called “full positive sight”310), and thepaths of accumulation, preparation, seeing, and meditation.311To expand, there are [four] mental contemplations associated withquiescence,312 [differentiated with regard to] the nine methods of sta-bilizing the mind; and four mental contemplations associated withinsight, [distinguished according to] four analyses313—full analysisof phenomena, etc. Through reliance on these two [types] of single-pointed concentration, one attains the four [types] of mental contem-plation, beginning with ever-present distress.314 At that point, onebegins [meditation on] the noble truths: one engages in the mentalcontemplation of knowledge of their characteristics (individual analy-sis of the sixteen attributes [of the truths], such as impermanence).315[This contemplation,] integrated with study and reflection, effects thetraversing of the path of accumulation. Beyond that path, the aspectof meditation that unifies the four truths leads to the stage of appre-ciation.316 The mental contemplation based on appreciation317 effectsthe traversing of the path of preparation [in its stages,] warmth, peak,receptivity, up to highest quality.318Subsequent to the stage of highest quality, as soon as one focuseson the truth which one previously examined, non-conceptual defini-tive pristine awareness or direct pristine awareness arises. The im-pediments that are removed through seeing [this awareness] arethereby eliminated, and one attains the path of seeing, the mentalcontemplation of thorough isolation.319With the mental contemplation of analysis320 and mental contem-plation of withdrawal or joy,321 one removes the impediments to beforsaken on the path of meditation and one traverses all the stages ofthat path of meditation.322 When the mental contemplation of the fi-nal training (adamantine contemplation323) arises, one attains arhat-ship, the complete liberation of mind.

By preserving pure ethical conduct,those who have become monks and nuns live comfortably, endowedwith ten personal benefits.

The Stages of the Bodhisattva states1:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166 Buddhist EthicsWhat are the four causes [of the mind of awakening]? The mostperfect affinity2 is the first cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva.The support of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and spiritual guidesis the second cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva. Compassion forothers is the third cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva. Fearless-ness in facing the lengthy, diverse, intense, and constant miseryof existence and the hardships [endured for the sake of others] isthe fourth cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva.Specific Factors that Contribute to its Formation [B]Awakening mind is formed through the strengths of a friend,cause, effect, path, and familiarizationThe specific factors that contribute to the formation of the relativeawakening mind in its two aspects3 are stated in [Maitreya’s] ScriptureOrnament4:Awakening mind is generated through the [five] strengthsOf the friend, cause, root [of virtue], learning, and familiariza-tion with the wholesome.It is said to be unstable when revealed by others (the strength ofthe friend)And stable when born from the latter [four] strengths.In other words, an awakening mind is formed in dependence upon[one or more of] these five factors: the strength of [i.e., indication by]a spiritual guide (the friend)5; the strength of awakened affinity (thecause)6; the strength of a nurtured root of virtue (the result)7; thestrength of study of the scriptures of the Universal Way (the path)8;and [the strength of] increased familiarization with what one haslearned.9 An awakening mind formed as a result of the first factor isunstable because it relies upon a friend. One formed as a resultof [one of] the latter four factors is stable since it will not be easilydamaged in adverse circumstances. The relative awakening mindis formed principally due to [the first factor], the strength of others’[indications].10The Particular Cause according to a Quintessential Instruction [C]It arises from compassion, which springs from love.Awakening mind, the intention to attain enlightenment, arises fromcompassion, the wish that all beings be free of suffering and its root.Compassion arises from the cultivation of love, the essence of which"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 167is the wish to give help and happiness to others.

This teaching is found in the Advice to theKing Scripture.THE ESSENCE OF THE COMMITMENTS [II]The essence of the commitments consists in the ethical conductthat forsakes unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind,Motivated by the intention to attain complete awakening forthe sake of others.The essence of the commitments of awakening mind is defined as theethics of renunciation endowed with an exceptional scope: the moti-vation to attain awakening for the sake of others, and the resolve (andits concomitant mental factors) to engage in concordant conduct andto forsake unwholesome thoughts, words, and deeds that are incom-patible with one’s goal. [Maitreya’s] Ornament of Realizations states11:Awakening mind is the intention to achieveComplete and authentic awakening for others’ sake.DISTINCTIONS OF AWAKENING MIND [III]Different aspects of awakening mind are distinguished according to(1) its characteristics, (2) the ways it is formed, (3) differentiation ofits stages, (4) similes for awakening mind, (5) its focuses, and (6) itsceremonies.Characteristics [A]The aspiring mind is characterized by wish; the venturingmind, by endeavor.Two aspects of awakening mind are distinguished on the basis ofits principal characteristics: (1) the commitments of the aspirationto awaken, and (2) the commitments of venturing [on the path toawakening].The first is defined as the ethics of a bodhisattva on the training [stage]of the Universal Way, accompanied by the wish to attain completeawakening for the sake of others. The second is defined as the ethicsof a bodhisattva on the training [stage] of the Universal Way, accom-panied by the intention to engage in a vast range of virtuous activitythat leads to the goal of awakening. Aspiring mind is exemplified by"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168 Buddhist Ethicsthe awakening mind in the continuum of a bodhisattva on [the pathof] accumulation or preparation. Venturing mind is exemplified bythe awakening mind that exists as the nature of the post-equipoisestate of an exalted bodhisattva.12In drawing distinctions between the aspiring and venturing as-pects of awakening mind, Damstrasena13 and other masters explainthat the former pertains to the worldly paths,14 and the latter to thesupramundane paths. Abhayakara,15 Smritijnana,16 and other schol-ars maintain that aspiration [corresponds to the awakening mindsillustrated by] the first three similes listed below17 and venturing [cor-responds to those indicated by] the other nineteen [similes].Moreover, Sagaramegha18 and other masters believe that a mind ofawakening formed without relying on a ceremony is an aspiring mind,and one formed during a ceremony is a venturing mind. Lord Atisha19and other masters of the magnificent deeds lineage explain that aspi-ration is the promise to attain the goal of awakening, and venturingis the promise to [create] the causes [leading to this goal]. In addition,some scholars believe that until it has become irreversible, an awak-ening mind is one of aspiration; once it is irreversible,20 it is venturingmind.Shantideva and the masters of the profound view lineage assertthat an aspiring awakening mind is simply the formation of the wishto awaken born out of compassion for sentient beings and other posi-tive factors. This may or may not be formalized in a ceremony. Thewish to awaken is likened to the desire to set out on a journey. Aventuring awakening mind begins with the full acceptance of the mindof aspiration and its commitments and is likened to the actual jour-ney. Simply put, aspiration is the resolve to awaken, and venturing isthe acceptance of the commitments of such a resolve. The noble Sakyapatriarchs21 assert that the aspiring and venturing minds are charac-terized by three aspects each:Aspiration, forming the aspiration, and safeguarding the aspira-tion from degeneration; venturing, forming the venturing [mind],and safeguarding the venturing mind from degeneration.22These masters maintain that aspiration and venturing minds in them-selves do not constitute commitments. Commitments are assumed"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 169only when these minds are permeated with an indispensable element:the intention to give up what is directly or indirectly incompatible[with their training].The Ways It Is Formed [B]Awakening mind is approximate or subtle, depending on theway it is formed.Two kinds of awakening mind are distinguished according to the waysit is formed: approximate and subtle. An approximate awakeningmind arises from an indication [by a spiritual guide], and a subtleone is attained through [the realization of] the fundamental nature ofthings. Accordingly, Shantipa’s Four Hundred and Fifty Lines Commen-tary states23:A mind of awakening is conceived through indications as longas one has [only] an intellectual understanding of emptiness, buthas not yet realized it directly. However, once [emptiness] hasbeen realized, the mind of awakening should be understood tobe ultimate [awakening mind].24Differentiation of Stages [C]Its stages are differentiated by appreciation, intention, fullmaturation, and freedom from all impediments.There are four aspects to the formation of awakening mind accordingto differentiations of the stages of the path. These are set forth in[Maitreya’s] Scripture Ornament25:The awakening mind formed on each respective stageIs said to be a mind of appreciation,Extraordinary intention, maturation,And likewise, freedom from all impediments.During the paths of accumulation and preparation, the awakeningmind is formed by appreciation26; on the seven impure stages, by anextraordinarily [pure] intention27; and on the three pure stages, bymaturation.28 At the stage of a buddha, the awakening mind is oneof freedom from all impediments [emotional and those preventingomniscience].29"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"170 Buddhist EthicsSimiles [D]Twenty-two similes, earth, gold, moon, etc., are used to distin-guish awakening mind with respect to individuals.Twenty-two aspects of awakening mind are distinguished with re-spect to [the levels of realization of] the individual or the stages of thepath. These are illustrated by the similes of earth, gold, moon, etc.Each simile represents an awakening mind accompanied by a par-ticular quality. [Maitreya’s] Ornament of Realizations states30:Earth, gold, moon, fire,Treasure, jewel mine, ocean,Diamond, mountain, medicine, spiritual friend,Wish-fulfilling gem, sun, song,31King, storehouse, highway,Conveyance, spring,Echo, river, and cloud:These are the twenty-two similes [for awakening mind].The qualities that accompany the twenty-two aspects of awakeningmind32 are the following: earnest desire, intention, determination,application, generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom,skillful means, strength, aspiration, pristine awareness,33 clairvoyance,merit and pristine awareness, factors conducive to awakening,34 men-tal quiescence and insight, memory and eloquence, feast of the teach-ings, sole path, and the awakened dimension of reality.35[As for their correlation with] the stages of the path, the first threeaspects of awakening mind, earnest desire, etc., are found on the threelevels of the path of accumulation.36 The awakening mind accompa-nied by application is present on the path of preparation. The tenaspects accompanied by the ten perfections, from generosity to pris-tine awareness,37 are found on the ten bodhisattva stages38 included inthe paths of meditation and seeing. The next five, from the awakeningmind accompanied by clairvoyance to the one accompanied by memoryand eloquence, are found on the superior path that encompasses thethree pure stages.39 The last three, beginning with the one accompa-nied by the feast of the teachings, are present, respectively, duringthe initial, actual, and final parts of the tenth stage, known as com-plete enlightenment, the stage of a saint of the Universal Way.40"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 171 Earnest desire, which constitutes the foundation for all positivequalities, is likened to earth.

The first [which has the relative focus ofsentient beings] consists of the aspiration [to awaken] and the actualventuring [toward that goal]. The second [which has the ultimate fo-cus of emptiness] is the actual ultimate mind of awakening, i.e., thenon-conceptual pristine awareness of an exalted being. A facsimile ofthe ultimate awakening mind may also be found at the beginner ’slevel.42Ceremonies [F]Awakening mind may be formed in three ceremonies.The commitments of awakening mind are distinguished accordingto the ceremonies followed to assume them: (1) awakening mindcommitments assumed during the same ceremony for receiving per-sonal liberation vows. This refers to the ceremony for taking per-sonal liberation vows in the system of the Universal Way, as de-scribed in the previous chapter which discusses the proclaimers’vows; (2) awakening mind commitments assumed during a cer-emony exclusive [to the Universal Way], such as the commitmentsof aspiring and venturing minds accepted during their respectiveceremonies in either the Centrists’ or the Idealists’ system; and (3)awakening mind commitments assumed in the same ceremony usedto receive a tantric empowerment, such as the commitments of awak-ening mind made during the preparatory part of a tantric initiationand the Secret Mantra pledges made during the main part of aninitiation.43"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172 Buddhist EthicsTHE TWO TRADITIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OFAWAKENING MIND [IV]This section has two parts: (1) an overview, and (2) a detailed discussion.Overview [A]The exclusive ceremonies are known as the two traditions ofthe pioneers;These have been preserved by their followers.The two ceremonies [to form an awakening mind] exclusive [to theUniversal Way] are known as the two traditions of the “pioneers”[Nagarjuna and Asanga44]. The later Indian and Tibetan followers ofthese masters have preserved these as two distinct traditions.The first ceremony was mystically transmitted by Manjughosha45to Nagarjuna, who taught it to his spiritual heir, [Aryadeva46]. Subse-quently, it was received by the bodhisattva Shantideva,47 who took itas his regular practice. Lord Punyashri48 introduced this ceremony[to Tibet], where it became adopted by the Sakya patriarchs.49 Theprocedure of this rite accords with Nagarjuna’s Ceremony for the For-mation of the Awakening Mind, Jetari’s Ceremony for the Acceptance of theSacred Commitments, and rites based on Shantideva’s Guide to theBodhisattva’s Way of Life and Compendium of Trainings.The second ceremony was mystically transmitted by the bodhisattvaMaitreya50 to Asanga, who taught it to his brother, Vasubandhu.51Subsequently, it come down to the master Chandragomin,52 who tookit as his regular practice. Lord Atisha53 introduced this ceremony [toTibet], where it was adopted by the Kadampa54 and the Dakpo Kagyu55schools. Its procedure accords with the rites based on Asanga’s Stagesof the Bodhisattva and Chandragomin’s Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva’sCommitments.Many Tibetan scholars believe Nagarjuna to be the founder ofCentrism (m›dhyamika) and Asanga to be the founder of Idealism(cittam›tra). They therefore refer to those two ceremonies as the Cen-trist and Idealist traditions for the formation of awakening mind. Theyregard them as fundamentally different, claiming the one or the otherto be the best. However, Lord Daö Shönnu (Gampopa)56 does not re-fer [to these traditions] as Centrist and Idealist, and, for that matter,the master Abhayakara57 does not consider there to be any difference"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 173between them. The omniscient Pema Karpo and others hold the sameopinion and refute the [former] view using scriptures and reasoning.The illustrious Tsuklak Trengwa58 and other scholars also agree withGampopa.Another ceremony for the formation of awakening mind, whichresembles the Centrists’ one, originated with the instructions of thegreatly accomplished masters Virupa and Naropa.59 This was handeddown to the Sakya masters and now constitutes the procedure for theformation of awakening mind found in the preliminaries of theempowerments of their lineage. Although it stands in its own right, itis not considered to be different from the two ancient traditions of thepioneers.Detailed Discussion [B]This section has two parts: (1) awakening mind in the lineage of pro-found view, and (2) awakening mind in the lineage of magnificent deeds.Awakening Mind in the Lineage of the Profound View [1]This section has five parts: (1) assuming the commitments [of awak-ening mind], (2) honoring them, (3) causes of loss of the commitments,(4) restoration of the commitments, and (5) additional points on thetraining.Assuming the Commitments of Awakening Mind [a]In the profound view’s tradition, anyone able to articulate ideasMay assume the commitments of the aspiring and venturingminds at the same timeIn the presence of a master or a sacred representation, followingpreparatory cultivation of merit and purification of mind.According to the tradition of the profound view lineage, a suitablecandidate for accepting the commitments of awakening mind is anybeing who has the capacity to articulate and to understand what issaid, as well as the willingness to assume the commitments. One canrefer to scriptures [for examples]. The Flower Ornament Scripture statesthat three thousand ocean-dwelling nagas were inspired by Manjushrito form [awakening] minds. The Fortunate Eon Scripture relates thefollowing event60:"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174 Buddhist EthicsThe victor Upakantha, as a mayor [in a past life],Resolved to achieve supreme awakeningWhen he made a promise not to kill for one dayIn the presence of the Transcendent Punyaprabha.Furthermore, the Questions of Ratnachuda Scripture describes howtwenty thousand gods and men made the resolve to attain awaken-ing. The incomparable Gampopa, however, states that in order to formthe awakening mind of aspiration, one must possess an affinity forthe Universal Way, have awakened that affinity, and have sought ref-uge in the Three Jewels. Moreover, he asserts that in order to receivethe commitments of a venturing mind, in addition to these [two req-uisites], an aspirant must have assumed one of the seven classes61 ofpersonal liberation vows (other than the purificatory fast precepts)and possess an aspiring awakening mind.The qualifications of the master [in the presence of whom] one ac-cepts the commitments of awakening mind have been described inthe first chapter of this book in accordance with Shantideva’s Com-pendium of Trainings and Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life. A personwho cannot find [a qualified master] may accept the commitmentsbefore [an image or other] sacred representation [of the Buddha]. Ifeven that is not available, one may visualize the buddhas and bodhi-sattvas in the sky before one and make the commitments by oneselfin their presence.The ceremony for assuming the commitments [is outlined in thisway]: If the commitments are being made in the presence of a master,the disciple [offers] an imagined universe62 and requests [the bestowalof the commitments]. The preliminary part consists in the purifica-tion of one’s mind through performance of the seven-branch service63and, in particular, taking refuge in the Three Jewels.The main body of the ceremony consists in accepting the commit-ments of the aspiring and venturing minds at the same time [by re-peating three times Shantideva’s formula:All the enlightened ones of the pastHave formed awakening mindsAnd engaged themselves progressivelyIn the bodhisattvas’ training.In the same way, for the sake of all that lives,I now form an awakening mind"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 175And will apply myself in stagesTo the training of the bodhisattvas.]64As the conclusion, the disciple cultivates joy [over having generatedan awakening mind by reciting these prayers of Shantideva:Today my life is fruitful:Having attained a good human life,I have been born into the family of the enlightenedAnd now I have become a buddha’s child.Henceforth, whatever happens,I shall act in accordance with this lineIn order not to sully this noble and faultless family.]and exhorts others to rejoice [by reciting this verse:Today, in the presence of all the protectors,I invite all beings to be my guestAt this feast of temporary and ultimate happiness.May gods, demigods, and all rejoice.]In this way, one encourages oneself and others, and then recites[prayers not to forget] the precepts of awakening mind. [The ceremonyis completed by] an offering to the master as a token of appreciation.When an aspirant assumes the commitments alone, all parts of theceremony are performed, except for the beginning and concludingofferings.It is certainly possible to form at least the essence of an awakeningmind by performing the ceremony to assume the commitments byoneself. However, scholars believe that for that mind to be bound bythe commitments, the strength of the [spiritual] friend, the strengthof the cause, and the other contributory factors [mentioned above]must be present.Honoring the Commitments [b]This section has two parts: (1) the root downfalls, and (2) the second-ary infractions.Root Downfalls [i]The root downfalls are explained in three sections: (1) the fourteendownfalls that apply to acute practitioners, (2) the four downfalls thatapply to average practitioners, and (3) the one downfall that appliesto obtuse practitioners."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176 Buddhist EthicsFourteen Downfalls that Apply to Acute Practitioners [A']Acute practitioners must avoid fourteen root downfalls.Five of these apply mainly to kings: to steal the Three Jewels’property, to reject the teachings,To blame the immoral, to commit deeds of direct retribution,and to profess wayward views.Fourteen root downfalls of the commitments of training are explainedin [Shantideva’s] Compendium of Trainings in accordance withthe Akashagarbha Scripture. Five of them apply mainly to kings, oneapplies exclusively to ministers, and eight apply to beginners. Thefive [downfalls] that apply mainly to kings who are bodhisattvas-in-training are the following65:(1) To steal [or have someone steal] property that has been of-fered to representations of [the Buddha’s] body, speech, andmind,66 or to the monastic community;(2) To reject [or cause someone to reject] the teachings of the Uni-versal or Individual ways [by saying that they are not thewords of the Buddha or that they are not the means to attainliberation];(3) To harm someone who wears the attributes of a monk, re-gardless of whether he maintains the vows purely or is animmoral monk67;(4) To commit any of the five evil deeds of direct retribution, i.e.,matricide, patricide, murder of a saint, causing a schism inthe monastic community, or out of malice, causing a buddhato bleed; and(5) To profess nihilistic views claiming that actions do not bringresults and that there are no future lives, and engaging inunvirtuous types of behavior [or encouraging others to do so].Five downfalls apply mainly to ministers: the first four are thesame as those prohibited for kings,And the fifth is to plunder a town.The five root downfalls that apply mainly to ministers who arebodhisattvas-in-training include the first four root downfalls for aking, plus plundering of a town and the like.68To plunder [a town] comprises five kinds of ravage: of a village(inhabited by four castes69); a town (inhabited by eighteen kinds of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 177artisans70); a county (an area that includes several towns); a province(an area consisting of several counties); or a country (an area consist-ing of several provinces).The eight root downfalls that apply to beginners are to teachemptiness to the untrained,To cause another to give up the intention to awaken, to makesomeone abandon the Individual Way,To assert that the Individual Way does not conquer emotions, topraise oneself and belittle others,To falsely claim realization of emptiness, to cause a king toinflict a fine and then accept stolen property as a bribe,To disrupt meditation or to give the possessions of a contempla-tive monk to one who merely recites scriptures.The eight root downfalls [that apply mainly to] beginner bodhisattvasare as follows71:(1) To teach the profound subject of emptiness to those who areof limited intellect or to those who are untrained [in the Uni-versal Way], causing them to be intimidated [by the Univer-salists’ doctrine] and thereby to lose faith in it.72(2) To cause someone to give up the intention to become fullyenlightened and to enter the way of the proclaimers or soli-tary sages when that individual is already following the Uni-versal Way, by declaring that he or she is not able to practicethe six perfections and other aspects [of the Universal Way].(3) To advise someone with an affinity for the Individual Way toabandon that path and then cause him or her to enter theUniversal Way73 without special necessity to do so.(4) To believe and to cause another to believe, without any spe-cial necessity, that by following the Individual Way, one can-not conquer the emotions.74(5) To praise oneself when one is not worthy and to belittle otherswhen they do not deserve it, for the sake of wealth and honor.75(6) To [falsely] claim, for the sake of wealth and honor, to haveattained [direct] realization of profound [emptiness] by say-ing that one has understood profound truth and to incite oth-ers to meditate to achieve the same goal.76(7) To cause a king or other person in a position of power toinflict a fine on a Buddhist monk by slandering him.

If one gives the property to the king, both [in-stigator and king] incur this downfall.(8) To cause a good monk to abandon mental quiescence or otherforms of spiritual practice by imposing unfair punishmenton him, or to deprive a contemplative monk77 of his life ne-cessities and to give these directly or indirectly to a monkwho merely recites scriptures. If the recipient is an accom-plice to one’s act, he or she also incurs this downfall.These are the fourteen downfalls that apply to acute practitioners,five for kings, one exclusive to ministers, and eight for beginners.Four Downfalls that Apply to Average Practitioners [B']Downfalls for average practitioners are to give up awakeningmind,Be ungenerous, angry, or hypocritical.Four [downfalls] apply mainly to average practitioners. These arestated in the Compendium of Trainings, based on their presentation inthe Skill in Means Scripture78:To abandon one’s awakening mind;Not to give alms to mendicantsOut of strong attachment and avarice;Not to forgiveBut to strike others in angerEven though they try to please one;And to present false teachings as the Buddha’s teachingsMotivated by an emotion or in order to please others.One Downfall that Applies to Obtuse Practitioners [C']An obtuse practitioner must at least maintain the aspiration toawaken.Having entered the Universal Way, an obtuse practitioner must, atthe very least, maintain the aspiration [to awaken]. Accordingly, theAdvice to the King Scripture states that all precepts are fulfilled in thisalone. To abandon one’s [aspiration] is a very serious root downfallfor any bodhisattva, whether acute, average, or obtuse. The CondensedTranscendent Wisdom Scripture states79:"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 179Though [a bodhisattva] may have tread the path of the tenvirtues80 for ten million eons,If his goal shifts to becoming a solitary sage or a saint,His ethics deteriorate and his commitments are lost.Such a setback is far more serious than the defeating offense [ofa monk].Secondary Infractions [ii]The secondary infractions number eighty: twenty-four stemfrom disinterest in others’ happiness or suffering;Sixteen stem from neglecting to accomplish greater goals.Each may be incidental or continuous.The Compendium of Trainings lists eighty secondary infractions. Ofthese, twenty-four stem from disinterest in others’ happiness and in-difference to their suffering. The two basic infractions in this categoryare (1) failing to relieve the physical suffering or sorrow of otherswhen able to do so, and (2) failing to provide physical comfort orhappiness.These two basic infractions are divided into four to distinguish thephysical and mental aspects of suffering or happiness:(1) failure to relieve the physical suffering of others when ableto do so,(2) failure to relieve their sorrow,(3) failure to provide them with physical comfort, and(4) failure to instill them with happiness.These are further divided to draw a distinction between the presentand future:(1) failure to relieve in the present others’ physical suffering or(2) sorrow,(3) failure to provide them in the present with physical comfortor (4) happiness,(5) failure to work so that others will be free in the future ofphysical suffering and (6) sorrow, and(7) failure to work so that in the future they will have comfortand (8) happiness.These eight are further divided to distinguish [failures to act]in three ways to relieve others’ sufferings and provide them withhappiness:"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 Buddhist Ethics(1) failure to make an effort in order to relieve in the presentothers’ physical suffering or (2) sorrow, or (3) in order to pro-vide them in the present with physical comfort, and (4) hap-piness, etc., up to (8) to provide for their future happiness;(9) failure to seek out the causes and conditions that would re-lieve in the present others’ physical suffering, etc., up to (16)so that in the future they will have happiness; and(17) failure to apply the remedial means to relieve in the presentothers’ physical suffering, etc., up to (24) so that in the futurethey will have happiness. Sixteen infractions stem from neglecting to accomplish [greatergoals]. The two basic infractions (for these sixteen) are (1) failing towork even in the slightest to relieve great physical suffering, and (2)failing to work even in the slightest to relieve intense sorrow.These two are divided to distinguish between present and future lives:(1) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve in this life greatphysical suffering or (2) intense sorrow, and(3) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what wouldbe the cause] in future lives of great physical suffering or (4)intense sorrow.These are further divided to draw a distinction between oneselfand others:(1) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve one’s own greatphysical suffering in this life or (2) others’ great physical suf-fering,(3) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve one’s own in-tense sorrow in this life or (4) others’ intense sorrow,(5) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what wouldbe the cause] in future lives of great physical suffering foroneself or (6) for others, and(7) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what wouldbe the cause] in future lives of intense sorrow for oneself or(8) for others.The remaining eight infractions are derived from the two infrac-tions of (1) failing to sacrifice [lesser goals] in order to accomplish thegreater [goals] of providing solace or (2) affording physical comfort."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 181These two are divided as above into eight infractions by making thedistinctions between [present and future] lives and oneself and others.For each of these forty infractions, the failing may be incidental orcontinuous; that further distinction yields a total of eighty infractions.Causes of Loss of the Commitments [c]The commitments may be lost in six ways, such as giving uprefuge.While a root downfall may damage some aspects of the ventur-ing mind,As long as aspiration is present, the commitments cannot be lost.The illustrious master Tsuklak Trengwa explains the six specific causesof loss of the commitments [of the mind of awakening]:The causes for the irreparable loss of awakening mind’scommitmentsAre to give up seeking refuge [in the Three Jewels], to renouncethe aspiration [for enlightenment],To return one’s commitments, to adopt wayward views,To turn toward [the path of] the proclaimers and solitary sages,And to abandon [love for] any being.Root downfalls damage and destroy [the commitments];The various minor transgressions weaken them.Lord Trinlepa explains that if any of the root downfalls (described inthe Akashagarbha Scripture) is committed, some aspects of one’s train-ing in the venturing mind will be damaged. However, provided thatone has not given up the resolve to awaken for the sake of all beings,the awakening mind of aspiration is not lost. As long as one main-tains that aspiration, one’s commitments are never damaged beyondrestoration.81Restoration of the Commitments [d]To restore the commitments, one invokes Akashagarbha andacknowledges the downfall in his presence.If the time limit for confession has passed, one restores thecommitments using the four forces.If the commitments of awakening mind have deteriorated becausethe aspiring mind has been relinquished, they can be restored by"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182 Buddhist Ethicsassuming them again in a ceremony. The Akashagarbha Scripture statesthat any root downfall may be amended by invoking the bodhisattvaAkashagarbha and acknowledging the infraction in his presence whenhe appears in one’s dream.82 Likewise, [Shantideva’s] Compendium ofTrainings states83:Openly confess to the bodhisattva Akashagarbha[When he appears] in your dreams.Minor offenses that contradict the precepts of awakening mind shouldbe acknowledged during each of the six periods (three daytime peri-ods and three nighttime). As taught in A Guide to the Bodhisattva’sWay of Life, acknowledgment may be made by reciting the Three-PartScripture84 and by strengthening the awakening mind.The master Krishna85 taught [a different method for the restorationof commitments] for each of three kinds of practitioners. Superiorpractitioners [restore their commitments] through understandingthe unborn nature of all that exists. Average practitioners do so byinvoking the deities of the awareness mantra, [a favored deity, orAkashagarbha, and by confessing in front of them]. Inferior practi-tioners, because they conceive the downfall as something real, [mustrestore their commitments] by regretting [the downfall] and openlyacknowledging it to another person.86Generally, if one does not amend the downfall by the end of a three-hour period following its occurrence, confession is “overdue,” and itbecomes an actual downfall. If the time limit for acknowledgmenthas not passed, the commitments are restored simply by the consci-entious [performance] of the means for renewal described above. Ifthe time limit for acknowledgment has passed (for example, if thedownfall is left without confession for a number of days), the down-fall can be purified by confessing it with the help of the four forcesand accepting the commitments again.The four forces are the following: the force of reliance, which is totake refuge [by repeating the refuge formula called] Prayer to the ChiefVictorious One87 or any other one; the force of repudiation, which is tospecify the downfall, regretting it intensely; the force of remedial ac-tion, which is to employ the six kinds of remedies,88 such as recitationof recollection mantras (dh›ra ̊ı) and other mantras, principally theone-hundred-syllable mantra of the transcendent ones; and the forceof renewal, which is to promise not to repeat [the misdeed]."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 183Additional Points on the Training [e]One should promise to train in the prescribed practice only tothe extent and for as long as one estimates one can.Most of the points of training discussed so far prescribe what actionsshould be avoided.

If one fails in one’s search, the com-mitments may be made before a representation of the Three Jewels,as stated in Stages of the Bodhisattva90:If it does not entail peril to one’s life or chastity, an aspirant shouldsearch for a spiritual friend within one league and an earshot.91 Ifnone is found, the aspirant may accept the commitments aloneor before a representation of the Three Jewels.92However, the elder Bodhibhadra93 and others have stated that thepresence of a master is indispensable when renewing commitmentsthat have deteriorated.The works of Asanga and those of the masters who immediatelyfollow him in the lineage do not clearly set out a ritual for assumingthe commitments of the mind of aspiration. The actual ceremony, con-sidered to be a pith instruction transmitted by Maitreya, was laterintroduced by Lord Atisha.94In this tradition, the commitments of the aspiring mind and ven-turing mind are assumed in two separate ceremonies. Both proce-dures comprise [three stages]: (1) [prior to the ceremony itself]the aspirant becoming a “definite candidate” [for the commit-ments]; (2) the preliminary, central, and conclusive parts of the cer-emony; and (3) a description of the nature of awakening mind [itscauses, etc.].The aspirant becomes a definite candidate [by contemplating per-tinent advice which transforms his or her attitude so that] he or shegives up adherence to the two extremes [of attachment to cyclic exist-ence and complacency in the peace of liberation], and then developsan earnest interest in generating an awakening mind.The preliminary part of the ceremony for the commitments ofaspiring mind is composed of [the offering of a mandala and] therequest [for the bestowal of the commitments] made to the specialreferent, the master; taking refuge in the special support [the ThreeJewels]; and the application of special means, which is the cultivationof merit [by performing the sevenfold service]."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 185The central part of the ceremony consists in assuming the commit-ments. This is accomplished through one’s own strength (an awakenedspiritual affinity), the strength of others (discerning the marvelousqualities of complete awakening by [listening to] the master’s words),and the strength of application (that gives rise to the [three] attitudesof disengagement from cyclic existence, disenchantment with perfectpeace, and earnest interest in awakening mind.)The ceremony is concluded by rejoicing, receiving instruction intraining, and offering the teacher a token of appreciation.95A practitioner who has formed the aspiration to awaken throughsuch ritual should study the scriptures concerning the bodhisattva’straining. Later, when the practitioner has developed faith [in the teach-ings] and the capacity for putting them into practice, he or she mayassume the commitments of the venturing mind.The ceremony for assuming the commitments of venturing mindhas three parts: the preliminary, the central part, and the conclusion.The preliminary part of the ceremony consists of a request, the teacher’sexamination of the candidate’s motivation, an entreaty for immediatebestowal [of the commitments], inquiry concerning [possible] obstaclesfor the candidate, acquainting the candidate with the nature of the train-ing, and inquiry about his or her interest [in the training].96The central part of the ceremony consists in assuming the commit-ments with a threefold repetition of the promise [to follow the train-ing]. The ceremony is concluded with a supplication [that theaspirant’s promise] be acknowledged [by the buddhas and bodhi-sattvas], an explanation of the merits [of the venturing mind], adviceto maintain secrecy, instructions on points of training, and offeringsof appreciation.97For the third stage, the description of the nature of awakening mind,the master explains in detail to the beginner bodhisattva the causes,essence, aspects, and benefits of the aspiring mind; and those samedetails of the venturing mind at the end of their respective ceremonies.In both traditions, [that of the profound view and this one,] theend of the third recitation of the formula for assuming the commit-ments marks the point at which the commitments were accepted.Honoring the Commitments [b]This section has two parts: (1) a concise statement, and (2) an exten-sive explanation."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 Buddhist EthicsConcise Statement [i]A practitioner must guard against four root downfalls andforty-six secondary infractions.A practitioner who has assumed the commitments of the aspiringand venturing minds must avoid four root downfalls and forty-sixsecondary ones.Extensive Explanation [ii]This section has two parts: (1) root downfalls, and (2) secondaryinfractions.Root Downfalls [A']The root downfalls are to praise oneself and belittle others outof attachment to wealth and honor;Not to give material aid or not to give teachings to the needyout of miserliness;Not to forgive someone though he has apologized and to strikehim in anger;To abandon the Universal Way and to present false teachings astrue Buddhism.Depending on the strength of involvement, the downfall maybe serious, moderate, or light.The four root downfalls, comparable [in gravity] to the defeating of-fenses of a monk, are enumerated in [Chandragomin’s] Twenty Verseson the Bodhisattva’s Commitments98 as a summary of the discussion ofthe subject in the Stages of the Bodhisattva99:To praise oneself and belittle others [who are endowed withwholesome qualities] out of desire for wealth and honor;To be miserly with one’s personal wealth, i.e., not to givespiritual instructions to those who yearn for them or materialaid to the needy, the pitiful, the poor, or the destitute;Not to forgive someone though he has apologized and, in anger,to strike the person with one’s hands, sticks, or in other ways;To disparage and reject the Universal Way as it is presented inthe scriptures that expound the bodhisattva’s [training], andto delight in and give false teachings while pretending thatthey are true Buddhism."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 187The three conditions necessary for these four deeds to be root down-falls are to have assumed the commitments, to be in a normal state ofmind, and to be emotionally involved in the act.

When there is a considerable degree of emotionalinvolvement and all three of these conditions are met, the downfall iscomparable to a defeating offense within the proclaimers’ system (i.e.,for a monk) [since the commitments are destroyed]. If the involve-ment is moderate, the downfall is comparable to a partially defeatingoffense; if slight, to a monk’s minor downfall.

and non-emotionalminor infractions, with one’s mind as witness.The Stages of the Bodhisattva states that the two causes148 of loss [ofthe commitments] are to incur a root downfall with great emotionalinvolvement or to allow one’s aspiration for enlightenment to dete-riorate. In these cases, a complete breach of the commitments is in-curred. [To restore it], one must first acknowledge one’s failing andpromise not to repeat it and then reassume the commitments in aceremony. However, the venerable Longchenpa said that this maynot be done more than three times.Downfalls incurred with either moderate or slight emotional involve-ment [do not constitute loss of the commitments and] are not [actually]defeats but are similar to them.149 In the case of moderate involvement,one must acknowledge the downfall with a promise to refrain [from itin the future] made in the presence of three or more vow holders150; inthe case of slight involvement, in the presence of a single vow holder.Any of the forty-two minor infractions incurred with emotionalinvolvement should be acknowledged in the presence of a vow holderif circumstances allow. Non-emotional minor infractions are purifiedby acknowledgment [of the failing] in the imagined presence of thebuddhas and bodhisattvas, with one’s own mind as witness.151The general causes of loss of the commitments have been eluci-dated above and should be well understood. Although the returningof vows is permitted in the personal liberation system, to return thecommitments of the awakening mind would have extremely seriousconsequences and is therefore absolutely prohibited.Dying, being reborn, forgetting [one’s previous existence], and soon, do not damage one’s commitments.

Fur-thermore, unlike the previous tradition in which one [promises to]train in the prescribed practice only for as long as one wants, hereone must observe the training from the time the commitments areassumed until the attainment of awakening. The two systems shouldnot be confused on these two points.THE TRAINING COMMON TO BOTH TRADITIONS [V]The explanation of the training common to both traditions has threeparts: (1) the training in aspiring mind, (2) the training in venturingmind, and (3) advice on safeguarding the trainings in the aspiringand venturing minds.Training in the Aspiring Mind [A]This section has three parts: (1) the five precepts, (2) the three nobleaspirations, and (3) eliminating the causes of deterioration of the as-piring mind.Five Precepts [1]Common to both traditions are five precepts for the aspiringawakening mind:Not to reject any being; to ponder benefits; to acquire merits;to refine the awakening mind;And to shun the four black deeds of deceiving one’s masteror a venerable person, feeling regret for what is not to beregretted,Being angry at a bodhisattva, and being cunning and deceitful,And to undertake the four white deeds in their place.For the training common to both traditions, first is the training in theawakening mind of aspiration which consists in the observance offive precepts:(1) Not to reject or consider insignificant any being, be it an en-emy or a mere insect (the basic precept);"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194 Buddhist Ethics(2) To ponder the benefits of awakening mind by recalling andreciting passages from the scriptures and their commentar-ies, as did the great Lord Atisha, who was renowned for hissudden exclamations such as “[Awakening mind] saves usfrom miserable existences!” (the precept of the favorable con-dition for preserving aspiring mind);(3) To strive at the cultivation of merit in conjunction with pris-tine awareness by engaging in the ten virtuous activities,153the six perfections, etc. (the precept of the cause that strength-ens the awakening mind);(4) To refine awakening mind by reaffirming one’s commitmentsdaily in each of the six [three-hour] periods, cultivating loveand compassion, and practicing an oral instruction to developawakening mind using a technique that is the basis of mindtraining—exchanging one’s own happiness for others’ suf-fering (the precept of the skillful means to develop awaken-ing mind); and(5) To shun the four black deeds and undertake the four whiteones (as the means to give up what weakens the awakeningmind or causes one to forget it, and to engage in the opposite).These four black deeds are explained in the Questions of KashyapaScripture154;(1) To deceive one’s master or other persons worthy of venera-tion by lying or in other ways;(2) To feel regret for what is not regrettable (regrettable actionsare those that constitute downfalls or unwholesome deeds);(3) To speak offensive words in anger to someone who hasformed an awakening mind; and(4) To be cunning and deceitful toward someone, whether in sub-stantial or minor ways.Regardless of whether the offended person is aware or not, oris displeased or not, these four deeds constitute downfalls and aretherefore called black.

The incomparable Gampopa states163:The ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities includes, in addi-tion to all the precepts of the bodhisattva’s ethics of restraint,everything that serves to cultivate wholesomeness of body andspeech in order to attain great enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"200 Buddhist EthicsAll aspects of training [in the venturing mind] are set forth in great detailin the scriptures and their commentaries. Everything that is prescribed,however, is encompassed by the practice of the six perfections alone.The Practice in Detail [ii]This section has three parts: (1) an overall description of the six per-fections, (2) the six perfections in detail, and (3) the ethics of workingfor the benefit of all beings.Overall Description of the Six Perfections [A']The perfections are described in terms of their number, order,characteristics,Semantic meaning, divisions, and groups.The six perfections are described generally in terms of their number,order, characteristics, semantic meaning, divisions, and groups. First,the perfections number exactly six in view of the goals of higher statesand liberation to which they lead: the first three, generosity, ethics,and patience, lead to rebirth in higher states of existence, while thelatter three lead to liberation. A different explanation states that bypracticing the first three one accomplishes the benefit of others, andthe last three, one’s own purpose.The six perfections are presented in a set order, from generosity towisdom, to reflect their gradual development, as ethics develops fromgenerosity, patience from ethics, and so on. According to another ex-planation, the order represents degrees of excellence, the lesser pre-sented first and the greater later (ethics being superior to generosity,etc.) or in the sequence of coarse to subtle. In any case, those easier tocultivate are presented first.The perfections possess four characteristics: they weaken miserli-ness and other emotions incompatible [with generosity, and so forth];they are accompanied by pristine awareness which is free of the con-cepts of act, agent, and object; their function is to fulfill the needs ofothers; and their result is the maturation of students’ minds in accor-dance with the three spiritual ways.164They are called perfections [“transcendent virtues”] because theytranscend all the virtues of worldly beings, proclaimers, and solitarysages, and lead to the perfect state.Each perfection may be divided into six branches, the generosityof generosity, the generosity of ethics, etc., to make thirty-six branches,which may be further subdivided into one hundred or one thousand.165"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 201The perfections may be grouped according to the two cultivationsof merit and pristine awareness: generosity and ethics are the meansto cultivate merit; discriminative wisdom, the means to cultivate pris-tine awareness; and the other three, the means to cultivate both meritand pristine awareness. They may also be grouped according to thethree types of training: the first three (generosity, ethics, and patience)belong to the training in higher ethics; the fifth (meditation), to thetraining in meditation; and the sixth (discriminative wisdom), to thetraining in wisdom; effort accompanies all three trainings.166The Six Perfections in Detail [B']Each perfection is threefold: Generosity of material aid, theteachings, protection,Ethics of restraint, aimed at acquiring good qualities, andworking for the benefit of others,Patience to withstand harm, accept hardships, and fathomemptiness,Effort that is armor-like, applied to the task, and insatiable,Meditation of resting at ease, aimed at acquiring good qualities,and focused on the welfare of others,Wisdom that is worldly and supramundane, higher and lower,Or wisdom that arises through listening, pondering, andmeditating.An explanation of four aspects of each perfection—definition,etymology, classifications, and purpose—will not be provided at thispoint. However, the essential points will be covered.Generosity is threefold, that of material aid, the Buddhist teach-ings, and protection. The generosity of material goods includes the“gift” of one’s various possessions, “great gift” [of spouse or chil-dren], or “highest gift” [of the parts of one’s body]. For generosity tobe authentic, it must be unpolluted by the four stains of improperintention, gift, recipient, or manner of giving.167The generosity of the teachings is to teach the Universal or Indi-vidual ways according to the intellectual ability of aspirants.The generosity of protection means to save from temporary fearthose threatened by rulers, tigers, lions, fire, flood, disease, weapons,etc., and from lasting fear those [who have fallen into lower forms oflife or are bound to cyclic existence]. (An alternative system distin-guishes the following three forms of generosity: continuous generos-ity, impartial generosity, and generosity that fulfills the wishes ofothers.168)"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"202 Buddhist EthicsEthics is threefold: ethics of restraint from what is unwholesome,ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, and ethics of working forthe benefit of all beings. These three have been explained above.Patience is threefold: patience in withstanding harmful persons,accepting hardships, and determining reality.Patience in withstanding harm done by others means not to retali-ate for the harm done to one’s person or interests. This patience isdeveloped through meditation according to the nine methods169 taughtin Shantideva’s Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life or by cultivatingthe five thoughts described in Asanga’s Stages of the Bodhisattva.170Patience in accepting hardships consists in enduring difficulties,such as fatigue, hunger, and thirst, that one may encounter in thequest for the teachings.171Patience in determining reality means not to be discouraged or in-timidated by profound subjects such as emptiness.Effort is threefold: armor-like effort, effort applied to the task, andinsatiable effort.172 Armor-like effort means to [wear the armor of]endeavor in what is wholesome throughout every single session ofpractice, with the intention of never relinquishing it until awakeningis attained.Effort applied to the task means never to be indifferent to the threeareas [of training]: to overcome one’s emotions, to accomplish whatis wholesome, and to work for the benefit of all sentient beings.The second of these, effort in accomplishing what is wholesome, isfivefold: ever-active effort, devoted effort, effort unshaken by emo-tions, effort not deflected by circumstances, and effort without pride.173Insatiable effort means never considering one’s virtuous endeavorto be sufficient.Meditation is of three kinds: meditation through which one restsin a state of ease in the present life, meditation aimed at acquiringgood qualities, and meditation of working for the welfare of others.174Meditation through which one rests in a state of ease in the presentlife refers to the meditative concentration that produces both the ap-proximate and subtle aspects of perfect physical and mental ease.175Meditation aimed at acquiring good qualities has common andexclusive aspects. The common aspect refers to the powers of totali-ties, masteries, liberations, and so forth176; and the exclusive, to thepowers that are special qualities of the bodhisattvas only.177"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 203The meditation of working for the welfare of others refers to themeditative concentration through which one uplifts others spiritu-ally by demonstrating miracles, using supernatural knowledge, etc.Wisdom [or discriminative wisdom] is of three types: worldly, lowersupramundane, and higher supramundane wisdom, each being pro-gressively superior.Worldly wisdom refers to learning [derived from study of] the com-mon sciences.178Lower supramundane wisdom refers to the understanding of thefour truths [derived from learning, pondering, and meditating on]the tenets of the proclaimers and solitary sages.Higher supramundane wisdom refers to the understanding of thetwo types of selflessness [derived from listening, pondering, andmeditating upon] the tenets of the Universal Way.An alternative system distinguishes the following three types ofwisdom: the wisdom that arises from listening, from pondering, andfrom meditating.The wisdom that arises from listening refers to knowledge of manyscriptures and reasonings and comprehension of their meanings.The wisdom that arises from pondering refers to the elimination ofmisconceptions about the objects of knowledge gained from a dis-criminative understanding of the four philosophical systems,179 therelative and ultimate truths, the definitive message [of the scriptures]and the interpretable one, and other subjects.The wisdom that arises from meditation refers to the realization ofthe abiding nature [of reality] which results from meditating on thosesubjects.When wisdom is present, all five become supramundaneperfections.One’s practice of the six perfections must incorporate six noblecomponents:(1) A noble foundation, which is to have formed the resolve toawaken;(2) A noble deed, which is generosity and the other perfectionspracticed impartially in all their different aspects;(3) A noble referent, which is to engage in the six perfections forthe benefit of all other beings;"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"204 Buddhist Ethics(4) A noble means, in which the six perfections are permeatedwith wisdom free of the concepts of act, agent, and object;(5) A noble dedication, which is to dedicate the merit thus ac-quired to the attainment of unsurpassable awakening;(6) A noble purity, which is to engage in the six perfections asdirect remedies to the two types of impediments (emotionalimpediments and impediments to omniscience).Of particular importance is the perfection of wisdom. Practice of thefirst five perfections without non-conceptual wisdom constitutes onlyworldly good deeds. On this point, the Condensed Transcendent Wis-dom Scripture states180:How will a hundred billion blind peopleFind the road, let alone enter a city?Lacking wisdom, the other five perfections are blind,And without the guide of wisdom, enlightenment cannot beattained.These perfections become “supramundane perfections” when suchwisdom accompanies them.181The Ethics of Working for the Benefit of All Beings [C']Four means of attraction and other ways are used to benefitothers.Once a practitioner has come to spiritual maturity by following theethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, he or she should engage inthe ethics of working for the benefit of all beings. These ethics in-clude the four means of attracting disciples: generous acts, pleasantspeech, suitable teachings, and appropriate behavior:(1) In order to attract new disciples, the master acts generouslyby offering gifts that will please them.(2) Once disciples are attracted, the master uses pleasant speechto draw them closer while giving them teachings on the Bud-dhist doctrine. In this way, the master instills in them enthu-siasm for and appreciation of the teachings, as well as ear-nest interest in putting them into practice.(3) The master guides disciples in practicing the teachings suit-able to their capabilities. Children must be nourished firstwith liquid and then [as they grow] with solid foods. Simi-larly, disciples of different intellectual capacities cannot bespiritually nourished by one instruction alone."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 205(4) The master behaves in accordance with the teachings in or-der to be a leading [example] for disciples in their virtuousendeavors and in [their pursuit of] the Buddha’s teachings.The words “other ways” [in the above root verse] indicate that oneshould also earnestly put into practice the twelve ways [of helpingothers that are included in the four means of attraction], which areopposite to the twelve contradictions to working for the welfare ofothers previously mentioned.Advice on Safeguarding the Trainings in the Aspiring andVenturing Minds [C]Awakening mind and its training are safeguarded with mind-fulness and discriminating alertness.Awakening mind should be safeguarded by relying on mindfulness,discriminating alertness, and conscientiousness. Mindfulness meansnever to forget awakening mind and always to maintain its precepts.Discriminating alertness is to recognize whether or not an infraction[of the precepts] has occurred. Conscientiousness means to be strictin one’s observance of proper behavior and avoidance of wrongful acts.In particular, once one has formed a precious mind of awakeningand is engaged in its training, one should strive to preserve, refine,and enhance both this mind and its training. To preserve awakeningmind so that it does not deteriorate means to abide in the essence ofthe aspiring and venturing minds and abide by the precepts condu-cive to its preservation. To refine awakening mind means to abide bythe precepts whereby one shuns all wrong actions and avoids non-conducive conditions. To enhance the virtue [of awakening mind]means to exchange one’s own happiness for others’ suffering and toabide by the precepts conducive to virtue’s enhancement.To preserve the training means to scrupulously avoid what is pro-hibited and practice what is advised. To refine the training is to for-sake inappropriate actions of body, speech, and mind—purposelessjumping, running, and moving about; excessive, harsh, or divisivewords; harboring desire for material gain or fame, and attachment tosleep and mental inertia—and to cultivate peaceful, relaxed, pleas-ant, and considerate behavior; gentle and moderate speech; and amind of faith and detachment. To enhance the training is to developthree aspects of the training: pristine awareness, discriminative aware-ness, and the dedication [of merit]."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"206 Buddhist EthicsFurthermore, both awakening mind and its training should be dili-gently preserved through techniques of mental development, suchas making the forty-one [prayers] to cultivate awakening mind astaught in the Pure Domain chapter of the Flower Ornament Scripture.182As well, the following four practices should be undertaken since allaspects of the commitments of the awakening mind are encompassedby them: To give others [one’s body, wealth, and virtues, which are]the three bases for generosity, to safeguard awakening mind, to re-fine it, and to enhance it. Accordingly, the Compendium of Trainingsstates183:To give away to others one’s body and belongingsAnd all virtues throughout time,And to guard one’s awakening mind,To refine it, and enhance it.It is important to understand that a beginner will be primarily con-cerned with safeguarding [the awakening mind]; a bodhisattva whosepractice is based on appreciation,184 with refining it; those who are onthe seven impure levels,185 with giving [all they have to others]; andthose on the three pure levels, with expanding [the awakening mind].THE FORMATION OF ULTIMATE AWAKENING MIND [VI]The ultimate awakening mind is discussed under five headings: (1)cause, (2) essence, (3) classification, (4) ceremony, and (5) nature.Cause [A]A great wave of altruistic deeds is the cause of an ultimateawakening mind.The formation of a relative awakening mind serves as the generalcondition for the arising of an ultimate awakening mind. The specificfactors that determine the formation of the ultimate mind are statedby the incomparable Gampopa in the following words186:It arises from the distinguished factors of scriptures, practice, andrealization.Ultimate awakening mind may arise as a result of learning and pon-dering the scriptural teachings or realizing it as spiritual accomplish-ment, or both of these together. It may also arise from a realizationawakened in the depths of one’s heart through the blessing of a"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 207marvelous connection between oneself and a qualified teacher. In allcases, however, the actual cause of ultimate awakening mind is thegeneration of an immense wave of altruistic deeds.Essence [B]Its essence is the pristine awareness of an exalted bodhisattva’sequipoise.The essence of ultimate awakening mind is pristine awareness, thedirect realization of the non-conceptual nature of reality. Accordingly,the incomparable physician of Dakpo states187:What is ultimate awakening mind? It is emptiness endowed withthe essence of compassion, clear, unwavering, and free from fab-rications of any objectifiable attributes.Such pristine awareness is an awakening mind existing as the natureof the meditative equipoise of exalted bodhisattvas dwelling on thevarious stages of awakening. It also exists as the nature of indivisibleequipoise and post-equipoise at the buddha’s stage.Classification [C]It may be divided into the awakening mind of the first stage,and so forth.Ultimate awakening mind, being in essence emptiness, is not divis-ible. However, there are many distinctions according to the differentways it arises: awakening mind [that has the nature of] the realiza-tion [of reality] gained on the first stage of awakening, and so forth,up to awakening mind at the stage of a buddha.Ceremony [D]Some scholars assert that ultimate awakening mind can beformed in a ritual; others deny this.Lord of the Teachings Jikten Sumgön and his followers believe thatultimate awakening mind can be formed in a ritual and substantiatetheir assertion with quotations from discourses and tantras.188 Theultimate awakening mind taught in the tantras can arise in a ceremony;therefore (they say) the one taught in the discourses can be formed ina ritual, just as the vows of personal liberation [can be assumed in a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"208 Buddhist Ethicstantric as well as a non-tantric ceremony]. To prove that the SecretMantra system speaks of the formation of the ultimate awakening mind,they say that in the context of the tantras, the “creative imagination ofa vajra standing on a moon,”189 though it is not called so, is well knownto be referring to the formation of the ultimate awakening mind.The following objection may be raised to their position: One can-not speak of the formation of the ultimate awakening mind in rela-tion to the “creative imagination of a vajra standing on a moon” be-cause this creative imagination, being a technique to train on the pathusing the aspect [of the resultant buddhahood], does not produce theactual ultimate mind of awakening, but only a facsimile of it.To this objection, they reply that [if one cannot speak of formationof ultimate awakening mind just because it is not the actual awaken-ing mind that is formed but only a facsimile,] similarly one could notspeak of the formation of the commitments of the venturing awaken-ing mind or the generation of other vows as well. However, this isnot the case. For example, though the vows of personal liberation areordinary when initially assumed, they later become genuine whenthey become imbued with renunciation. Likewise, the commitmentsof awakening mind initially exist simply as aspects of a virtuous mind.Later, when the bodhisattva actually enters the path of accumulation,the totality of mind and mental states becomes of one nature with thecommitments, and, as a result, the genuine aspiring and venturingminds are formed. In the same way, [the ultimate awakening mindof] the non-conceptual pristine awareness [of reality] is initiallycognized through a powerful ritual. Later, when the roots of virtueripen, the continuity of such cognition evolves into a direct realiza-tion [of reality, which is ultimate awakening mind].On the basis of such reasonings, Jikten Sumgön and his followersadopted the system [of performing a ritual for formation of ultimateawakening mind]. Sakya Pandita, however, presents a different per-spective on this argument190:Ultimate awakening mind arises through the power of medita-tion, not by a ritual. If it were possible [by ritual], ultimate awak-ening mind would be formed simply by indications, and to callthat [ultimate] is not logical.191 Although it is possible that the Bud-dha [as cited in the Hundred Rites of Renunciation and Fulfillment192]"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 209declared “You should form the ultimate awakening mind!” thisrefers simply to a promise, not to a rite [for the formation of theultimate awakening mind].The followers of the outstanding Ngari Panchen also assert that theultimate awakening mind cannot arise in a ritual.193These two perspectives do not contradict each other. The formerview [that of Jikten Sumgön] asserts that the ritual produces a fac-simile [of ultimate awakening mind], while the latter [that of SakyaPandita], that a ritual cannot produce a genuine [ultimate awakeningmind]. However, it would be unreasonable to say that the adherents[of Sakya Pandita’s view] categorically deny the possibility of ulti-mate awakening mind arising in a ritual. In fact, the reasons and proofsthat validate the statement, “the pristine awareness of the fourth em-powerment arises depending just on words,” [which these followersare bound to accept] are similar to those that would validate the state-ment, “ultimate awakening mind arises in a ritual.”Nature [E]Ultimate awakening mind possessed of three ultimate aspectsIs the pristine awareness that directly realizes the sphere ofreality.What is the actual nature of ultimate awakening mind? In the SecretMantra system, it is considered to be non-dual pristine awareness.The assertions of different masters seem to indicate many levels ofsubtlety. However, from the perspective of the Way of the Perfections,ultimate awakening mind is awakening mind possessed of three ulti-mate aspects: absolute dedication, subsequent achievement, and re-alization,194 as stated in [Maitreya’s] Scripture Ornament195:Because the perfect buddhas have been well honored,And merit and awareness have been thoroughly cultivated,Because non-conceptual pristine awareness has arisen,It is said to be ultimate.Scholars [of the Universal Way] consider ultimate awakening mindto be the pristine awareness of the direct realization of the selfless-ness of phenomena, which is naturally present on the first stage ofawakening. This pristine awareness arises as a result of honoring the"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210 Buddhist Ethicsperfect buddhas (the principal condition) while on the path of accu-mulation; and of cultivating merit and pristine awareness over anincalculable eon (the cause) while on the path of preparation.196THE CONSEQUENCES OF DAMAGING THE COMMITMENTSAND BENEFITS OF SAFEGUARDING THEM [VII]To damage awakening mind brings four adverse consequences.To safeguard aspiration reaps eight merits; and venturingmind, two special ones.The awakening mind is indeed the source of all temporary andlasting benefits and happiness.The scriptures state that deterioration of the training in awakening mindleads to unlimited negative consequences. These are summarized inthe following four consequences (the first three are general consequencesof downfalls; the fourth, specific consequences of a root downfall):(1) One becomes an object of everyone’s scorn because one hasbroken a promise and thereby deceived the teacher, the Bud-dha, sentient beings for whose benefit one was working, andoneself, the perpetrator.(2) Like a king losing his kingdom, one loses one’s purpose inlife, and consequently all sorts of misfortunes, both immedi-ate and in the long run, befall one.(3) In the future one will fall into miserable forms of life, fromwhich escape is difficult.(4) All the virtues one had amassed by forming an awakeningmind are nullified; the Three Jewels and the deities [who fa-vor the Buddhist teachings] are deceived, and as a result,one is reborn in one of the great hells. Even though one mayhave felt some shame or embarrassment, acknowledged one’smistake, and reaffirmed one’s commitments, if one has en-gaged in a downfall, the attainment of the stage of a bodhi-sattva is greatly delayed.Similarly, Shantideva says197:Those who have the power of awakening mindBut have committed a downfallStay revolving in cyclic existence,And are greatly delayed in reaching the [bodhisattva’s] stages.Therefore, from the very beginning, a bodhisattva should make ev-ery effort to prevent transgressions to the training."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Commitments of Awakening Mind 211To safeguard the training in awakening mind brings unlimitedbenefits, which are summarized in the following ten (eight merits areaccrued from safeguarding the mind of aspiration; two, from the ven-turing mind). The eight are illustrated in the following words of theincomparable Gampopa198:Preserving the aspiration to awaken brings eight benefits: oneenters the Universal Way; one becomes a candidate for the train-ing of a bodhisattva; all evil deeds are uprooted; the seed ofunsurpassable awakening is planted; infinite merits are amassed;all buddhas are pleased; all beings are served; and full enlight-enment is swiftly reached.In addition to those, two special merits are accrued from safeguard-ing the venturing mind:(1) From the time an awakening mind has first been formed, theflow of merit never ceases, [even when] asleep or careless,thus fulfilling one’s own purpose.(2) The interest of others is accomplished in various ways, byalleviating their misery, working for their well being, etc.Moreover, each of the six perfections is said to yield its own bound-less merits. In short, from now until the attainment of enlightenment,all of one’s noble qualities will spring from the precious mind of awak-ening. Thus, awakening mind is the source of all happiness and wellbeing, now and in the future.A SYNOPSIS OF THE PHASES OF THE PATH IN THEUNIVERSAL WAY [VIII]The phases of this path are summarized in Maitreya’s ScriptureOrnament199:To awaken spiritual affinity, show interest in the teachings,Engender awakening mind,Practice generosity and the other perfections,Bring others to spiritual maturity,200Enter a faultless state,201Create buddha fields,202Attain non-abiding perfect peace,203And demonstrate the path to supreme awakening.204An awakened affinity for the Universal Way, which forms the basisfor all good fortune, is indicated by the qualities of compassion, re-spect, patience, and delight in the practice of virtue.

To engender a supreme awaken-ing mind marks one’s entrance to the Universal Way. Once one has entered the Universal Way, the practice of the sixperfections (generosity, etc.) brings one to spiritual maturity. Strivingto the best of one’s ability, both in the state of equipoise and post-equipoise, at the four means to attract disciples brings others to spiri-tual maturity.As a natural consequence of these efforts, one’s focus never shiftsfrom spiritual development. Faith, renunciation, meditation, and otherforms of virtue are never tired of; enthusiasm increases as naturallyas a swan alights on a lotus pond. These signs indicate the start of thejourney on the lesser path of accumulation.205Effort is then directed toward the attainment of exalted qualities,such as the abilities [to enter] faultless meditative absorption and tocreate a buddha field.206 Gaining some measure of a clear impressionof the [sixteen] attributes of the four truths207 is to achieve the path ofaccumulation. The strength of meditation [on the four truths] conjoined with thestrength of the cultivation of all aspects of merit produces the realiza-tion of the phantom-like nature of the five aggregates.208 Gradually aclear understanding of phenomenal selflessness is achieved; this isthe path of preparation.The first sight of the essential meaning of the two kinds of selfless-ness marks one’s entrance onto the path of seeing. Further cultiva-tion of special meditative concentrations focused on the [two selfless-nesses] previously understood characterizes the path of meditation.Finally, the apex of knowledge and freedom is reached on the path ofno more learning.The correlation between these paths and the bodhisattva’s stagesof awakening is as follows. On the path of seeing, the bodhisattvaattains the pristine awareness of that path and the first stage of awak-ening simultaneously. On the path of meditation, he or she traversesall stages up to and including the ninth. On the path of no more learn-ing,209 the bodhisattva enters the oceanic tenth stage (called Cloud ofthe Teachings).In summary, the basis for all five paths and ten stages is awaken-ing mind.

Initially [the aspirant] isintroduced gradually to [different levels of] conduct. Accordingly, theTwo-Part Hevajra Tantra states3:First, bestow the purificatory fast [precepts].Then, [teach] the ten areas of training.4Then [the aspirant] is introduced gradually to [different levels of]philosophical views. The same tantra states5:To disciples [grounded in that training], teach [the philosophy]Of the Analysts, and then [in progressive stages],That of the Traditionalists, the Experientialists,And that of the Central Way.6After learning the views, the disciple enters the levels of the differentclasses of tantra.

Therefore, despitedifferences in complexity, the aim of all initiations is said to be [theexperience of] blissful pristine awareness.In short, the ethical system of the Secret Mantra has as its object thebinding of body, speech, and mind, and their subtle propensities. Itsbinding agent is [blissful pristine awareness]. Its vows consist in theresolve (and its seed) to experience [pristine awareness] using specialskill in means and wisdom. These vows are assumed anew throughan initiation.In the phrase “the vows of an awareness holder,” the term “aware-ness” refers to the pristine awareness of great, unchanging, and su-preme bliss, free from dualistic patterns of thought.

In thecontext of the Secret Mantra vows, awakening mind thereby assumesa meaning additional to that held in common with the Way of thePerfections, as stated in [the Hevajra Tantra]13:The formation of the relative awakening mindEmbodies the ultimate awakening mind.And in the same tantra14:The relative jasmine-flower-like [seminal essence15]Is the embodiment of bliss, the ultimate.16For this reason, it should also be understood that the vow of the Se-cret Mantra is superior [to the others].Distinctions [ii]Mantric vows are distinguished according to (1) the actual tantra, thesubject matter of tantra; (2) the four classes of tantra, the words of thetantras themselves; and (3) initiatory rituals, the procedures for as-suming vows.Distinctions in the Actual Tantra [A']Three types of vows are distinguished according to subjectmatter:The causal tantra’s vow to bind all phenomena, form, sound,etc., within innate pristine awareness;The vow of the tantra of skillful means to bind subtle and grossobjectifying thoughts within the creation and completionphases;And the resultant tantra’s vow to bind subjective experiencewithin the nature of the dimensions of awakening andpristine awareness.Although there are many ways to enumerate the distinctions ofmantric vows, here we will briefly note the three types of mantricvows of the “actual tantra,”17 the subject matter of tantra. These threetypes are the vow of causal tantra, the vow of the tantra of skillfulmeans, and the vow of the resultant tantra, and are defined as follows:"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 223The vow of causal tantra is to bind the nature of all phenomena,form, sound, etc., within the state of innate pristine awareness.The vow of the tantra of skillful means is to bind all subtle andgross forms of thinking that objectify dualistic appearances withinthe meditations of the phases of creation and completion.The vow of the resultant tantra is to bind all phenomena arising inone’s subjective experience within the essence of the dimensions ofawakening and pristine awareness.The first of these three is a nominal vow; the second two, actual vows.Distinctions in the Four Classes of Tantra [B']Four classes of tantra teach the actual tantra: Action, Conduct,Yoga, and Highest Yoga tantras.Mantric vows are distinguished according to the four classes of tantrathat teach [the actual tantra]—the vows of the Action, Conduct, Yoga,and Highest Yoga Tantra.18Action Tantra vows [are defined as] the commitment to experience(hold) blissful pristine awareness which binds conceptual graspingto subject and object and the propensity for movement [through thetechnique] of using the pleasure [of smiling at a consort] as the spiri-tual path.Conduct Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitmentexcept that the technique uses the pleasure of gazing [at a consort] asthe spiritual path.Yoga Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitment ex-cept that the technique uses the pleasure of embracing [a consort] asthe spiritual path.Highest Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitment ex-cept that the technique uses the pleasure of union [with a consort] asthe spiritual path.19These four different techniques serve as antidotes for four subtleand gross forms of conceptual grasping to subject and object to beforsaken in the common spiritual way20 and four subtle and grosspropensities for movement21 to be forsaken in the exceptional SecretMantra. Thus, the awareness-holder vows of the four classes of tantra,which are commitments to experience non-dual intrinsic awarenessor blissful pristine awareness, are differentiated according to the tech-niques [used to fulfill their commitments]."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 Buddhist EthicsDistinctions in Initiatory Rituals [C']Three kinds of mantric vows are distinguished according toinitiatory rituals in which they are assumed:The mantra’s own personal liberation and awakening mindvows assumed during regular confession;Vows of divine fortune taken upon entry into the mandala;And the creation and completion vows assumed in the mainpart of an initiation.Three kinds of mantric vows are distinguished according to the ini-tiatory rituals in which they are assumed: the vows assumed duringthe preparatory phase; upon entry [into the mandala]; and duringthe main part [of an initiation]. These are explained as follows:(1) The Secret Mantra’s own version of personal liberation vowsand commitments of awakening mind are assumed during the regu-lar confession22 [performed during the preparatory part of an initia-tion23]. The actual mantra vows are assumed when the three places24[of the disciple] are consecrated [as the three vajras]. At this point,these vows [and even the personal liberation and awakening mindvows] arise as the essence of mantric vows.(2) Vows are assumed at the time of the outer entry [into the man-dala],25 when the [master] has inquired about [the disciples’] inter-est26 and they have responded, and [the symbols of] moon and vajrahave been introduced.27 Vows are also assumed when pledges aremade at the inner entry,28 pristine awareness descends,29 and the dei-ties [of the mandala] are revealed.30 These together are called the vowsof divine fortune.(3) Vows assumed in the main part of an initiation include vows ofthe three lower tantras received during their respective initiations;vows related to the creation phase received during the vase initia-tion31 of any Highest [Yoga tantra]; and the vows related to the comple-tion phase received in the course of the higher initiations.32 For thesecond, vows related to the creation phase, there are common andexclusive ones. The vows of the vase initiation common to both High-est Yoga Tantra and Yoga Tantra are assumed with the verbal prom-ise to keep the pledges of the five buddha families made during thepreliminary ritual. The vows of the vase initiation exclusive to theHighest [Yoga] Tantra are made with the promise not to disrespectthe [vajra] master, etc., at the appended [initiation] given through sym-bols of auspiciousness.33"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 225The vows of the creation phase differ from those of the completionphase in that the former pertains to an experience of blissful pristineawareness that is not actualized, while the latter [pertains to an expe-rience of blissful pristine] awareness that is actualized. Also, the tech-niques [in the initiatory procedure] employed for assuming the twokinds of vows are different: for the former, pristine awareness is in-duced indirectly; for the latter, directly.34Ways to Assume the Vows [iii]The vows are assumed with a promise upon entry into themandala,Or in their entirety at the end of the initiation.Mantric vows are assumed in two ways: (1) by making a verbal prom-ise, and (2) through the initiatory procedure [which involves medita-tion on the content of the initiation]:(1) At the completion of the triple recitation for assuming vowsdone during the preparatory part of an initiation or at the entry [intothe mandala], vows have definitely been received. However, thepledges one has promised to honor are not empowered to be pre-served until the actual initiation takes place. This is similar to theway that [renunciate vows] become vows to be safeguarded whenthe monk or novice ordination is performed, despite the fact thatduring the interim renunciate [phase of the ordination]35 the promise[to abide by the] renunciate vows is made.How then are mantric vows assumed with a verbal promise? Bypromising “I will keep these vows and pledges” when assuming theactual mantra vows in the main part of the initiation.(2) The initiatory procedure [i.e., through meditation on the con-tent of the initiation] is the way the principal mantric vows are as-sumed. The main mantric vows of each class of tantra are fully as-sumed once the vajra-master initiation for that class of tantra has beenreceived. In Action Tantra, the vajra-master initiation will come at thecompletion of the water and diadem initiations; in Conduct Tantra,at the end of the five (water, etc.36) initiations; in Yoga Tantra, at theconclusion of the irreversible initiation37; and in the Highest YogaTantra, at the completion of the four initiations.38 In short, the vowsof mantra are assumed in their entirety at the conclusion of the initia-tory rituals of the particular tantra."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226 Buddhist EthicsAn objection may be raised here: “Do the Action and Conduct[tantras] have vajra-master initiations?” Each class of tantra specifiesthe tasks to be performed by a vajra master, such as conferring initia-tions, expounding [the tantras], performing consecrations, etc. Toperform these tasks, an aspirant must receive the vajra-master initia-tion; therefore, it is logical that all four classes of tantras must havetheir own vajra-master initiation. This can also be proven by scrip-tural references. [For example], the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra [a Con-duct tantra] states39:Placing the vajra in the right handAnd the wheel in the left,Say to the disciple,“You have now become a vajra master.”The General Tantra [an Action tantra] also states40:To acquire the rank of vajra master,The first [initiation] must be well celebrated.This citation means that the initiations of water and diadem must beconferred on the disciple prior to placing him or her in the rank of avajra master [through the relative initiation].Another objection may be raised: “Is it not true that the Essence ofPristine Awareness considers the vajra-master initiation a Yoga Tantraspecialty?” The Pristine Awareness does state this in reference to the[exclusive] irreversible wheel initiation41 [of the Yoga Tantra]; there-fore, its statement does not negate [that Action and Conduct tantrashave vajra-master initiations].Phases in the Process of Assuming Vows [iv]The vows’ seeds are planted when the body, speech, and mindare consecrated;They are formed with the promise to maintain them andblessed by the descent of pristine awareness;The main conferral of initiation brings them to the apex.The process of assuming the vows of Secret Mantra begins when thebody, speech, and mind of the disciple have been consecrated as thethree vajras42 [in the preparatory ritual] and is completed only at theend of the conclusive initiation given through symbols of the particu-lar class of tantra."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 227The seeds of the mantic vows are planted with the consecration ofthe disciple’s body, speech, and mind as the three vajras. The vowsare formed with the triple repetition to take the vows of the five buddhafamilies. They are blessed by the descent of pristine awareness [uponthe outer and inner entry into the mandala, respectively]. They areaugmented during the central part of the initiation when the confer-ral of the initiations of the five buddha families and the conduct43initiations consecrates the disciples’ five aggregates as the five bud-dhas (Akshobhya, etc.),44 and their reality [veiled] by impurities [isconsecrated] as Vajrasattva, the sixth buddha. The vows are greatlyaugmented in the vase initiation when the impurity of adherence toordinary appearances is cleansed in [the experience of] the world andits inhabitants manifesting as the display of the deities and their sup-porting mandala. The vows reach their apex in the course of the threehigher initiations,45 which are the supreme ones, when the impurityof considering the deity as real is also cleansed and all aspects of cy-clic existence and perfect peace are released into great pristine aware-ness, the union of bliss and emptiness. This is the point at which themantric vows of the Highest Yoga Tantra have formed completelyand have been fully assumed.With the conferral of the main initiation of one of the four classesof tantra, disciples also receive the vajra-master initiation that investsthem with the authority to give initiations, teach [the tantras], per-form consecrations, etc. In the conclusive [initiation] given throughthe symbols [of auspiciousness], disciples make a succinctly formu-lated promise three times to maintain the pledges to which a vajramaster is bound after these pledges have been extensively illustrated[by the initiating master]. At the end of this triple promise, the man-tra vows are fully assumed, and from this point forward, disciplesbecome susceptible to the root downfalls of the specific class of tantra.For this reason, it is said that the vows are fully assumed at the con-clusion of the initiation and not before.Differentiations between the Vows of the Higher and Lower Tantras [v]Mantric vows of the lower tantras are called incomplete orpartially complete;And those of the higher tantras, fully complete.Bliss and emptiness, as two or as one, embrace all vows."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"228 Buddhist EthicsEarlier scholars designated the mantric vows of the lower classes oftantra as incomplete (those of Action and Conduct tantras) or par-tially complete (those of Yoga Tantra); and mantric vows of the HighestYoga Tantra, as complete, according to the extent to which the mantricvows are assumed. In short, all vows and pledges are encompassedby two pledges: the ultimate pledge of skill in means, profound bliss,and the relative pledge of wisdom, emptiness comprehensive of all[aspects].46 All too are embraced by the single vow of EVAM, the unionof skill in means and wisdom. Accordingly, the Two-Part Hevajra Tantrastates47:The vow of all the buddhasExisting in the aspect of EVAMIs the great bliss of EVAMTo be realized through initiation.48Since the vow of EVAM pertains to both ground and fruition stages,the Buddha himself called it the great pledge. The Continuation of theGuhyasamaja Tantra49 states:It is the vow or pledgeTaught by One Beyond Worldly Conduct.And Manjushri’s Magical Net50:Our Teacher, guide of beings,Realized this one great pledge.The same is explained in detail in Samvarodaya and other tantras.Suitable Aspirants for Assuming the Vows [vi]Although no discrimination is made with regard to aspirants,A person unable to safeguard as much as the common vowsIs not to be initiated but may enter the mandala.Suitable aspirants for assuming mantric vows are principally humanbeings, who embody six elements.51 No discrimination is made onthe basis of social status, past actions, etc. Accordingly, the Sacred Pri-mordial Buddha’s Tantra states52:A bamboo weaver or other untouchableOr even one guilty of one of five deeds of immediateretributionWill become awakened in this very lifeBy following the conduct of mantra."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 229[The same tantra] also recounts the story of nagas being initiated inthe land of Oddiyana.53 A number of tantras state that since gods,demigods, and other beings are included among the suitable aspir-ants for tantra, all beings who have faith and interest should be acceptedas disciples. However, it is inappropriate to initiate into the SecretMantra weak-willed individuals who are incapable of safeguardingthe common vows, such as the purificatory fast and other personalliberation vows, or the awakening mind of aspiration and otherbodhisattva commitments. Nevertheless, in order that the seed of theirliberation be planted, aspirants who demonstrate earnest interest,though unfit in other respects, should be led [into the mandala of thedeity]. Accordingly, the Indestructible Peak54 states:Those who do not assume vows,Are untameable, and lack faith,Are eligible only for entry into [the mandala].[Initiation] is not to be conferred on them.In addition, the same tantra states55:As soon as [the mandala] is seen,The vows become pure.The Pledges to be Honored [vii]This section has two parts: (1) pledges common to the four classes oftantra and (2) the pledges of the individual classes of tantra.Pledges Common to the Four Classes of Tantra [A']Vows and pledges assumed during the initiation must besafeguarded like one’s life.Four pledges constitute the foundation common to all tantras:To maintain correct view, refuge, and awakening mind, and toreceive the mandala’s initiation.A person who has received in its entirety an initiation into a greatmandala [of the Highest Yoga Tantra] has thereby received all of thevows and pledges of the Way of Indestructible Reality.

The sixty-verse Guide to Mantra57states:Know that for tantraThe basic pledges are four:To have a correct view of the conventional,Not to forsake the Three Jewels,To safeguard the awakening mind,And not to reject the true initiation.58The Manjushri Fundamental Tantra states:Following a detailed explanation of the four pledges, [the mas-ter proclaims:] O heir of the victorious ones!

The thirty pledges consist of the twelve prescriptions forwhat to practice and eighteen prescriptions for restraint given in theSusiddhi Tantra [to be explained below].

The means of restoration of thepledges explained for the Action Tantra also apply to these pledgesof the Conduct Tantra, as they do for pledges of Yoga Tantra, whichwill be explained below.Venerable Pema Karpo presents a distinct classification of the Con-duct Tantra pledges. Three pledges pertain to the training: (1) the vowof the “mind of entering” [assumed] in order to enter the great pledge;(2) the vow of the “abiding mind” once one has entered the greatpledge; and (3) the vow of the “mind of involvement,” bringing oth-ers to the great pledge once one has mastered it.102 The fourteenpledges mentioned above are considered to be the fourteen root down-falls for practitioners who are renunciates. The four root downfallsplus sexual misconduct, murder, theft, untruth, and wayward viewsare considered pledges applying to lay practitioners.What is the difference between the shunning of the ten unvirtuousdeeds in this context and the shunning of them by the proclaimers,solitary sages, worldly people, and non-Buddhists? The difference issignificant, because proclaimers and solitary sages do not possess [thespecial] skillful means and wisdom [taught in the Conduct Tantra].103Worldly people and non-Buddhists observe [a wholesome conduct]induced by their grasping to the [self as] real.

The root pledges are to avoid the fourteen defeating offensesfor a bodhisattva found in the Akashagarbha Scripture.116 The branchpledges consist in observing the three forms of ethics: of restraint fromunwholesome deeds; the ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities;and the ethics of working for others’ welfare.To explain these three forms of ethics, the first is to observe, at thevery least, what is indispensable: the four root precepts of a lay per-son plus the vow not to drink alcohol, which are given in the procla-mation of vows beginning with the words: “Do not take the life ofother creatures...,”117 etc.; and the vow to renounce all unwholesomedeeds unless done to benefit others. The second form of ethics isto devote oneself to true masters, honor true practitioners of yoga(indicated by the “etc.” [in the root verses]), and engage in the tenvirtuous deeds of the Universal Way (identical in nature to the sixperfections). The third form is to give up the four attitudes that areincompatible with the Universal Way: aspiring to the lesser ways,neglecting to work for the benefit of others, renouncing cyclic exist-ence, or being attached to the state of perfect peace.The pledges assumed in the proclamation of the concise form ofvows are the following:(1) Not to disrespect gods, demigods, yakshas,118 etc.;(2) Not to step over the symbols of the vajra, etc.;(3) Not to step over the master ’s seat, or over the weapons, ritualimplements, or the insignias of deities.Further, since the vows of the lower [systems] are included in thehigher, the vows in common with the Way of the Perfections and withthe Action and Conduct tantras are also to be preserved [as part ofthis last category of vows].Venerable Pema Karpo classifies Yoga Tantra vows into the threegroups119 of root pledges, branch pledges, and pledges concerning ap-plication:(1) The root pledges are the fourteen injunctions related to thefive buddha families and the fourteen pledges that prohibitdownfalls that are counteractive to the injunctions."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242 Buddhist Ethics(2) The branch pledges are [the four root precepts, etc.,] men-tioned [in the Indestructible Peak Tantra] beginning with thewords: “Do not take the lives of other creatures.”(3) The pledges of the five deities [found in the fundamentaltantras] are the pledges that apply to the practice.Enumerations of the downfalls and pledges of the Yoga Tantra areextremely numerous, and therefore it is not possible to encompass themhere.

Conduct (Tib. brtul zhugs) is defined as thetransforming (brtul) of ordinary activity and thoughts and the enter-ing (zhugs) into the mode of Vajrasattva’s body, speech, and mind.Each of the tantras presents its own special system [to effect this trans-formation].The Glorious Guhyasamaja states that the conduct of the creationphase is to rely on the five nectars [in order to fulfill] the pledges ofthe three vajras: human flesh, the [pledge of] vajra body; excrementand urine, the [pledge of] vajra speech; and semen and blood, the[pledge of] vajra mind; or, alternatively, to rely on the five nectars asthe pledges related to the five families.

Most of the earlier masters state that the phrase “twenty-two modesof pure conduct” found in the Chakrasamvara tantras is a referenceto the conduct [common to all Highest Yoga tantras] of avoiding thefourteen root downfalls and the eight serious branch downfalls (whichare explained below). The exceptional conduct taught in these tantrascomprises the following:(1) Worship on the tenth day of the lunar month;(2) Hand offering123;(3) Worship through the definitive meaning of the four vajras124;(4) Practice of the four seals125;(5) Ritual feast of heroes and yoginis;(6) Symbolic behavior126;(7) The eight exceptional pledges [concerning conduct with anawareness-woman].The first, worship or offering made on the tenth day of the lunarmonth, includes making offerings of young virgins or women whobear the signs [of being yoginis127], the outer offerings, the major orminor food offering (torma) rituals, etc. The last, [eight pledges con-cerning conduct with an awareness-woman], are pledges to abandonthe following downfalls:To fail to remember the conduct of the left; to unite [with thetantric consort] out of desire alone;To discriminate [between oneself and others]; to lose interest [intantra];To fail to rely on a tantric consort; to leave the tantric consort;To let one’s tantric activity deteriorate; to feel revulsion towardpledge substances.These are explained as follows.

These haveboth provisional and definitive meanings.In some tantric systems, the term “vow” is used to denote the moralprescription for what to practice, and “pledge,” the moral prescrip-tion for restraint. Others reverse the definitions, and yet others con-sider them to be synonymous. Although these different ways of de-fining “vow” and “pledge” are not contradictory, for convenience inthis discussion, the terms are used according to the first definitions.The etymology of the [Tibetan] word sdom pa (vow), sambara [inSanskrit], is “to bind.” [In this context,] “vow” means to bind ordi-nary body, speech, and mind, as well as their propensities, to the es-sence of the four vajras141 by special means and wisdom.The general and specific vows of the five families common to [theYoga and Highest Yoga] classes of tantras have been explained above.Now we shall discuss the pledges of the six buddha families taughtin the Glorious Wheel of Time Tantra. These have both provisional anddefinitive meanings.First, the provisional meanings will be given. For the five-prongedvajra family of Akshobhya, the pledges are explained as follows. Thevajra (enlightened mind), emptiness; the bell (enlightened speech),great compassion; and the seal (enlightened body), the deity’s form,are the “secrets”142 of [ordinary] body, speech, and mind. From thebeginning of time, these three have been the very essence ofAkshobhya (Immovable), never other than the enlightened body,speech, and mind of all the transcendent ones: this is the pledge ofthe ground. The three pledges to “hold” [vajra, bell, and seal] meansto recognize, in accordance with one’s level of experiential under-standing, that body, speech, and mind are the three vajras and tomaintain this recognition in one’s meditation. These [three pledges]"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"250 Buddhist Ethicsare linked to the substantial cause [for the actualization of enlight-ened body, speech, and mind]. The vajra master serves as the maincontributory condition [in actualizing these]; therefore, the pledgenever to be transgressed is to devote oneself to him or her in all theways appropriate to the relationship. The pledge to “hold” the mas-ter means to see him or her as one’s chief, that is, to rely on the masterwhile shattering one’s pride. As symbols [of these pledges], a tantricadept carries a vajra and bell (endowed with the proper characteris-tics), performs symbolic hand gestures, wears the five symbolic boneornaments,143 etc.For the jewel family of Ratnasambhava (Source of Jewels), thepledge is to train in the ten kinds of generosity144:To give jewels, iron, copper, oxen, horses,Elephants, young maidens, land,One’s spouse, and one’s own fleshAre the ten kinds of gifts.Beginners should give what they are able, and aspire to be able togive [in the future] what they are reluctant to give now.For the wheel family of Vairochana (Illuminator), the pledges areto eat the five meats and five nectars,145 etc., and other foods appro-priate for yogins:Since they enhance camphor,146Always consume meatAnd especially alcohol.For the sword family of Amoghasiddhi (Unfailing Accomplishment),the pledge is to acquire merit by making all kinds of offerings to thesupreme ones, such as flowers, etc., to the buddhas and bodhisattvas.147For the lotus family of Amitabha (Measureless Light), the pledge isto abide in pure conduct. In relation to the first seven [Wheel of Time]initiations,148 this means to refrain from adultery. In the higher initia-tions, pure conduct refers to the “vow of no emission,” which con-sists in the non-emission of seminal essence even when engaging insexual intercourse with [an ordinary] woman.For the single-pronged vajra family of Vajrasattva (AdamantineBeing),149 the pledge is to preserve the awakening mind, the union ofnon-objectifying compassion and emptiness150 which is the pristineawareness that cognizes the ultimate.Next are presented the definitive meanings. The Akshobhya fam-ily pledge of the vajra of enlightened mind is to train in order thatone’s mind be made the immutable bliss. The pledge of the bell of"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 251enlightened speech is to train in order that one’s speech be madethe invincible sound of speech.151 The pledge of the seal of enlight-ened body is to train in order to make one’s body an empty im-age.152 The pledge of the master is the same [as described above],although practitioners [at the level of the completion phase,] due totheir superior experience and realization, feel a stronger devotionfor the vajra master.For the family of Ratnasambhava, the pledge is to bind the tenwinds153 within the central channel.For the family of Vairochana, the pledge is to prevent emission of[seminal essence] which is the pure essence of the five aggregatesand of the five sense organs.For the family of Amoghasiddhi, the pledge is to ignite, by warmthor passion, the fire of inner heat154 so that the [body’s] seminal es-sence melts [and descends], and to reverse its flow and thereby satu-rate the aggregates, elements, sense organs, and their objects with bliss.For the family of Amitabha, the pledge is to transform the blissarising from the melting of the seminal essence into the immutablebliss, relying on the great seal of the empty image.155For the Vajrasattva family, the pledge is to cultivate the indivisibil-ity of immutable bliss156 and emptiness endowed with the supremeaspects.157A practitioner on the creation phase trains in [the methods relatingto] the provisional meanings of these pledges; and the completionphase practitioner, the definitive meanings.In general, all aspects of the Secret Mantra paths are intended to beincluded in the three cultivations [of merit, ethics, and pristine aware-ness]. The jewel family pledge of generosity and the action (sword)family pledge to make offerings serves to cultivate merit. The pledgeof the wheel family serves as the cause for the cultivation of ethicsand the lotus family pledge serves as the actual cultivation of ethics.The five-pronged vajra and single-pronged vajra [family pledges]serve to cultivate pristine awareness. All mantric vows and pledgesare thereby encompassed by these three cultivations.The sequence [in which the pledges of the six families have beenset out] corresponds to the course of experiential understanding, andtherefore one should engage in the practice of them in exactly thatorder. The procedure is as follows:"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 Buddhist EthicsHaving entered this tantra [of the Wheel of Time], for the seal pledge[of the Akshobhya family], one dissolves conceptual grasping to theordinary appearance of the body [into emptiness] and assumes thedeity’s form. For the bell pledge, one dissolves grasping to the ordi-nary manifestation of speech [into emptiness] and assumes the[deity’s] mantra. For the vajra pledge, one dissolves ordinary thoughts[into emptiness], and whatever thoughts arise, dwells in that verynature [of emptiness]. These [three] are known as pledges that per-tain to consciousness because they [involve the imaginative] concep-tual process.Then, having been introduced in the course of the initiation to [theordinary] body, speech, and mind as the three vajras [body, speech,and mind] of a buddha, and having carried this [identification] intothe meditation, one [trains in order to fulfill the definitive meaningsof Akshobhya’s] three pledges pertaining to pristine awareness. [Forthe pledge of the seal,] one actualizes the body as the real empty-form158; [for the bell’s pledge,] the speech as the real self-reverberatingsound (n› ̃a) of indestructible speech; and [for the vajra’s pledge,]the mind as the real profound bliss.The most important contributory condition for preserving both [thepledges pertaining to consciousness and those pertaining to pristineawareness] is the vajra master, who is the principal medium throughwhich the marvelous activity of all the buddhas shines. Therefore,one must devote oneself to a vajra master because through such arelationship ignorance is directly overcome. Devotion to the masteris the aorta of all the paths of Secret Mantra, and therefore one shouldnever waver from or feel above it: this is known as the Akshobhya(Immovable) pledge.The pledge of Akshobhya applied to one’s meditation is the rem-edy for ignorance, the root of cyclic existence. However, to overcomecraving, which is the force that propels one into new lives, one trainsin non-attachment by giving away the ten external objects of desire159[thus fulfilling the pledge of Ratnasambhava]. To use the mind ofnon-attachment in one’s meditation, the body must be made fit forthe practice of generosity: one observes the ten pledges that prescribenourishing oneself with the ten foods.160 Since these pledges serve asthe condition for the achievement of an unpolluted physical aggre-gate of form, and for the “illumination” of objects by means of thefive specially endowed supernatural knowledges,161 they are knownas pledges of Vairochana (Illuminator)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 253Then, on the basis of non-attachment and physical pliancy, one workstoward the realization of the master as the embodiment of all the tran-scendent ones using the yoga of the inseparability of one's body, speech,and mind [with those of the vajra master]. This realization requires thethree cultivations [of merit, ethics, and pristine awareness].[To fulfill the pledge of the sword family,] one acquires merit bymaking offerings.

As this is the condi-tion for the attainment of a buddha’s boundless luminosity, it is knownas the pledge of Amitabha (Measureless Light).[To fulfill the pledge of the vajra family,] a practitioner enhancespristine awareness by cultivating awakening mind.

Evil beings include persons who throughout their livescommit serious acts such as the five deeds of immediate retributionand persons who qualify as one of ten recipients.162In the hidden or definitive meaning, to take life means to direct thevital energies that normally flow in the right (rasan›) and left (lalan›)channels into the central one (avadhÒti). The immobility of these vitalenergies in the central channel ultimately stabilizes the winds andmind in the crown of the head, which causes the seminal essence toascend. This occurs in reality on the twelfth stage of awakening.163 Asa similitude, the beginner trains in holding the seminal essence in theupper [focal point of energy].In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Amogha-siddhi] sword family is to speak untruth in order to turn away fromfalse doctrines those who have fallen onto erroneous paths and who,even if told the truth, would not believe it.In the definitive meaning, to speak untruth is to proclaim the enlight-ened speech which encompasses all [languages] and exists in the natureof an invincible and innate sound at the heart.164 The enlightenedspeech teaches the unreality and non-abiding nature of all phenom-ena and in this sense does not speak of the truth of dualistic and lim-ited phenomena, but speaks of their untruth. The innate sound is heardin reality on the fifth and sixth stages of awakening. As a similitude,the beginner, as the means to hear the invincible and innate sound,cultivates [the yoga of] “withdrawal.”165In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Ratnasam-bhava] jewel family is to steal the possessions of others who cravewealth and are fettered by greed in order to save them from takingrebirth as starving spirits. Once stolen, for the sake of acquiring merit,the goods should be donated to others.In the definitive meaning, to steal others’ possessions means to stealthe jewel-like immutable bliss from Vajrasattva. The place from wherethe immutable bliss is taken is the throat, where bliss and empty formare made inseparable. The immutable bliss is actually achieved onthe eighth level. As a similitude, the beginner trains in the means forits achievement.In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Amitabha]lotus family is to abduct the women of others who crave and are at-tached to women in order to save them from rebirth as animals."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 255In the definitive meaning, to abduct the women of others means toactualize the great seal of empty form. The great seal of empty formis attained in reality on the ninth and tenth levels. As a similitude, thebeginner trains in the means for its achievement.In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Vairochana]wheel family is to eat meat and drink alcohol in order to shatter arro-gance about one’s social status and personal pride.166 To eat meat re-fers to eating the five meats (known as lamps), and [includes] the fivenectars.In the definitive meaning, to eat meat and drink alcohol means toreverse and stabilize at the navel the pure essence of feces, urine, andsemen. In this stabilization, alcohol symbolizes innate pristine aware-ness; the five meats symbolize the five sense organs; the five nectars,the five buddhas167; and their “excellent objects,” the five transmutedsense objects. The stabilization of the pure essence of feces, etc., oc-curs in reality on the fourth stage of awakening. As a similitude, thebeginner trains in the branches of withdrawal and contemplation.168In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Vajrasattva]curved knife family is to give away one’s own body, the greatest actof generosity, and to never disrespect women, so that one’s practicewith an action seal will yield attainments.In the definitive meaning, to give is to stabilize the seminal essenceat the genitals’ focal point of energy. The stabilization is effected bykeeping the vow of celibacy, i.e., non-emission of the seminal essencewhich is the cause of immutable bliss,169 while churning in the lotusof space (vagina of the consort). The seminal essence is stabilized inreality at the genitals on the first stage of awakening. As a similitude,the beginner trains in stabilizing the adamantine bodhichitta170 at thesame place by exercising control over [winds],171 and in giving awayone’s body along with one’s children, spouse, etc.The pledges of the six families taught here with an interpretabledouble sense, hidden and evident, are applicable to individual prac-titioners depending on their levels of capacity, that is, depending onwhether one is an accomplished yogin [yogini] or one who has notyet gained powers. (An “accomplished yogin” has attained the fivesupernatural knowledges and other feats by practicing the branch ofcontemplation.172) Accordingly, [the tantras] say that unaccomplishedyogins who lack supernatural knowledge should not attempt thewrathful rite of liberating, etc., but may perform pacifying, enrich-ing, domineering, or summoning [rites].

The fourteen root downfalls are explained as follows:(1) To disrespect one’s vajra master means to upset a spiritual master, orto abuse or be contemptuous of him or her in any way, physically,verbally, or mentally, such as striking, criticizing, slandering, orharboring wrong views about him or her. The object of the offense isa spiritual master, of which there six kinds:Those who bestow pledges, teach the tantric meditation,Expound [the tantras], reveal secret instructions,Confer initiation, or perform [charismatic] activitiesAre said to be the six kinds of masters.Of these [six], the principal ones [in the context of this downfall]are the masters who have initiated one [into the tantra], expoundedthe tantras, or revealed secret instructions. Of particular significanceis the “glorious spiritual master” who points out the pristine aware-ness of transcendent reality.For the downfall to be complete, six factors must be present:(1) The master being an authentic one;(2) Knowing that the offense will displease [him or her];(3) Offending the master directly with actions or words;(4) Done not for others’ sake or similar purposes;(5) Done for selfish motives;(6) Having no interest in purifying the offense.If the offended master has conferred initiation, taught the tantra,and revealed secret instructions, the downfall is serious; if the masterhas performed two of these, or only one, the downfall is correspond-ingly less serious. These and other distinctions are drawn."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"258 Buddhist Ethics(2) To transgress the Buddha’s teachings, in its general sense, means totransgress what was taught by the Victorious One. To disrespect andreject the teachings, even when due to lack of understanding of them,qualifies as this downfall. To reject the teachings of the Universal Wayconstitutes a defeat; to be averse to other teachings of the Buddhathat do not appeal to one is a serious violation; to reify or depreciateminor [aspects of the teachings] constitutes a minor failing.The particular sense of this downfall is to defy one’s vajra master ’sadvice to give up unwholesome ways, such as the ten unvirtuousdeeds, and to do such deeds in secret.

Of particular significance arevajra brothers and sisters who have entered the Secret Mantra andassumed its vows; and above all, those vajra siblings with whomone has received in their entirety the four initiations from the samemaster.For the downfall to be complete, six factors must be present:(1) The object of the offense being an actual spiritual sibling173;(2) Knowing that one’s anger will displease the sibling;(3) Expressing the anger with actions or words;(4-6) And the last three factors of the first downfall.Spiritual siblings are categorized in other ways. Jnanapada [for ex-ample] enumerates five types174; the Wheel of Time, seven,175 in whichare included all sentient beings as “distant siblings.” However cat-egorized, downfalls that are incurred in relation to the latter types(the closest) are progressively more serious."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 259(4) To abandon love means to make the resolve never to help a particu-lar being, whatever the circumstances, and thereby give up the inten-tion to lead him or her to awakening. One’s love for someone may beabandoned in the following four ways [listed] in order of the speedof restoration:(1) Love abandoned [briefly], like the time it takes for a draw-ing on water [to disappear];(2) For longer, like the time for a drawing on sand [to disappear];(3) For even longer, like the time for a crack in the ground to besealed by rain;(4) [Forever,] like a shattered stone or fruit that has fallen to theground and can never be repaired.176Some mention only the latter two ways of abandoning love as thebasis of this downfall. The essential point [in qualifying as a down-fall] is that the love is not subsequently restored.For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:(1) The object being any sentient being;(2) The intention never to help him or her;(3) Having no interest in purifying the offense.(5) To lose the jasmine-flower-like awakening mind means to emit the semi-nal essence, the support [for bliss]. Pundarika’s Great Commentary [on theWheel of Time Tantra] explains the nature of the downfall in these terms:The fifth root downfall is incurred when, lacking an understand-ing of immanent reality, one engages in union [with a consort]for the sake of using the ensuing bliss as a means to work towardawakening, but in doing so [overcome by desire or out of disre-gard for tantric vows] loses the seminal essence.All spiritual accomplishments are rooted in the relative and ultimateawakening minds.177 From these, the two dimensions of a buddha arerealized. The seed of the attainment of the form dimension of awak-ening is the relative awakening mind, which is the jasmine-flower-like awakening mind (bodhicitta) itself. Therefore, to lose this awak-ening mind constitutes a downfall.For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:(1) To be one who has not yet realized immutable bliss-realityby means of great wisdom;(2) To lose the seminal essence and experience a transitory bliss,[while engaging in union] as a means to attain awakening;"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260 Buddhist Ethics(3) To lose the seminal essence other than for the special pur-poses of using it as the substance for the secret initiation, oras means to [experience] bliss during the conferral of thewisdom initiation to others, or to make nectar pills.178(6) To disrespect spiritual teachings, in its general sense, means to dis-parage [one’s own or] other religions out of desire for personal gain.To disparage the scriptures of the Universal Way is a serious viola-tion; the Individual Way, a minor offense; and non-Buddhist religions,a minimal offense. However, [the tantras] state that if one shows dis-respect toward non-Buddhist traditions with the intention of spiritu-ally inspiring their adherents [to follow the Buddhist path], one notonly does not incur this downfall, but actually acquires merit.The particular sense of this downfall is in the context of Buddhisttenets. The Way of the Perfections and the Secret Mantra are causallyrelated to one another in that the first is the cause and the second theresult. In the first of the three cycles of teachings, [the Buddha] taught[on the subject of] the realization of personal selflessness and the un-reality of generic images of apprehended objects. In the second, hetaught [on the subject of] the realization of the ineffable, inconceiv-able, and indescribable empty nature of all phenomena. In the third,he taught [on the subject of] the realization of the clear-light nature ofmind as a way of teaching [ultimate reality] and on the realization ofthe self-experienced intrinsic awareness as the essence of meditationpractice. The four tantras [teach these realizations] in a similar way,up to the last [the Highest Yoga Tantra] that teaches [the ultimatetruth] as the identical flavor of EVAM, the union of bliss and empti-ness. Ultimately, all teach but one reality. A downfall is incurred whenone disparages the profound transcendent wisdom [as taught in theWay of the Perfections] which forms the very heart of the definitivemeaning in Mantra, holding it to be inferior to the transcendent wis-dom [taught in the Mantra Way].For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:(1) To disparage the transcendent wisdom that is the definitivemeaning of Mantra by believing it to be inferior to the tran-scendent wisdom [taught] in the Secret Mantra and to actu-ally say so;(2) To believe that such disparaging words are well-founded;(3) To act not for the sake of uplifting those who adhere only tothe Way of the Perfections."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 261(7) To disclose secrets to immature persons means to reveal the secrets ofprofound bliss to someone attracted exclusively to the proclaimers’way or similar ways who has not been ripened by initiation and whowould become apprehensive or disdainful of such secrets.For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:(1) The person having an affinity for the proclaimers’ or the soli-tary sages’ ways being spiritually immature and becomingfrightened or disdainful upon hearing the secrets;(2) To disclose the secrets of profound bliss to that person;(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.Regarding this downfall, Darika179 states that to disclose the secretsof profound bliss creates obstacles to gaining supreme attainment;and to disclose the general secrets of Mantra, obstacles to gainingcommon attainments.180There are four types of spiritually immature persons (impeded inone of four ways) to whom secrets should not be revealed. [Begin-ning with the most] immature, these are as follows:(1) Persons concerned with the affairs of this world only, who holdvirulent wayward views toward the teachings and are imma-ture in that they lack the cause [for Secret Mantra practice];(2) Spiritual extremists who believe in the [reality of a] self;(3) Proclaimers who are weary of cyclic existence;(4) Solitary sages who do not have the incentive to help others (theselast three lack the conditions for Secret Mantra practice).Higher [teachings] should be kept increasingly more secret the moreimmature the person.(8) To abuse one’s own aggregates, in its general sense, means to despiseone’s own body. The aggregates, elements, and experiential media ofoneself or of others should not be despised because they are the formdimension of awakening although veiled by impurities.In its particular sense, this downfall means to believe the body tobe the principal source [of suffering] and engage in forms of self-mortification, such as injuring it with weapons, burning it with fire, orotherwise abusing it through fasting and other austerities. Abuse of thebody constitutes a downfall because in receiving the vase initiation,181one has been introduced to the aggregates, etc., as the nature of variousbuddhas. Once introduced in this way, one can increase the [experienceof] bliss by offering the aggregates the delight of sensory pleasures,and with bliss as the support, actualize the pristine awareness of reality."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 Buddhist EthicsFor the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:(1) To know the body and the other aggregates to be of the na-ture of various [buddhas];(2) To consciously abuse them;(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.Many classes of tantras prescribe the purificatory fasting practice;would this practice not be a downfall? In [the context of] tantra, thepurpose of fasting is not to abuse the body but to purify it in order toplease a deity, or to supplement inner cleansing. Therefore, this prac-tice of fasting not only is not a downfall, but greatly aids [thepractitioner’s spiritual growth].(9) To disbelieve what is pure in nature,182 in its general sense, means tomisconceive relative truth (while to misconceive ultimate truth wouldconstitute the eleventh root downfall), which is the interdependentarising of all phenomena, being mere appearance without intrinsicreality, like [the reflection of] the moon on water. For example, to con-tend that statements such as “sentient beings [can] become buddhas”or “buddhas, although without concepts, are replete with knowledge”are self-contradictory [is to incur this downfall].In its particular sense, this downfall means to fail to appreciate orto harbor doubts about emptiness [as described in statements suchas] “the overall meaning of reality is emptiness,” etc., or to pursuesimilar mental fabrications.For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:(1) The pure nature of emptiness being the object [of one’s doubts];(2) Having the underlying attitude of non-appreciation with theensuing mental fabrications;(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.(10) To have love for the wicked, in its general sense, means to showaffection for evil beings, such as demons, religious extremists, or ar-rogant challengers [of the teachings], who are untameable by loving-kindness.In its particular sense, this downfall means to hypocritically feignlove for another person and thereby deceive him or her.

Here, however, thedownfall has been specified [as feigning love for a tantric consort] because it must pertain to what is incompatible with the third initia-tion [the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation, i.e., aconsort].(11) To apply discursive concepts to transcendent reality, in its generalsense, means to reify or depreciate that which is beyond designationsand to draw sophistic conclusions about existence, non-existence, both,or neither, not understanding that the entirety of all phenomena issimply reality as it is and reality itself is the nature of all phenomena.In its particular sense, this downfall means to conceptualize or havedoubts about immutable bliss, the nature of the body, speech, andmind of the buddhas, which transcends all mundane examples, isnameless, etc.; and about emptiness inclusive of all the appearingforms of “she” who bestows the bliss.183For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:(1) The object being everlasting and immutable bliss;(2) Conceiving reality to be different from immutable bliss;(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.(12) To cause believers to lose faith, in its general sense, means to destroysomeone’s faith [in the Buddhist teachings].

In particular, the instructions on the Path andits Fruition217 present different pledges for each of the four initiations.For the vase initiation,(1) the pledge of equipoise is [to cultivate] the creation phase;(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is to practice the threerealities218;(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to eat] the pills made with thefive meats and five nectars;(4) the pledges to be safeguarded are the twenty-two root andsecondary mantric vows219;(5) the pledge not to be separated from is to hold vajra and bell.For the secret initiation,(1) the pledge of equipoise is to engage in the control of the breathand channels220;(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in] self-existing pristine awareness221;(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] empti-ness and clarity;"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 269(4) the pledge to be safeguarded is [to shun] all that hampersself-existing [wisdom] and [its] wind;(5) the pledge not to be separated from is [to work with] eithergentle or forceful breath [control].For the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation,(1) the pledge of equipoise is to meditate on the mandala222;(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in] the in-nate [pristine awareness of bliss]223;(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] bliss;(4) the pledge to be safeguarded is not to allow the six losses ofseminal essence224;(5) the pledge not to be separated from is [to rely on] an actualor imaginary consort.For the fourth initiation,(1) the pledge of equipoise concerns the “three [vajra] waves”225;(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in the] ut-terly pure reality;(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] the bliss-emptiness of great bliss;(4) the vow to be safeguarded is [to overcome] the two impedi-ments,226 in particular those that hamper the attainment ofomniscience;(5) the pledge never to be separated from is [to rely on] an ac-tual padmini [lotus-like consort] or an imaginary consort.227These pledges are honored in four ways: first by assuming them cor-rectly; by recollecting them again and again; by having [at least] asingle [meditative] experience; and by having a special respect forthe vajra master. It is said that failure to fulfill the first means losingthe pledges that would draw one out of the suffering of cyclic exist-ence. Failure to fulfill the latter three ways means loss of pledges re-sulting in a delay in one’s spiritual progress.“Etc.” [in the root verse] refers to pledges taught in other tantras,for example, the Samputa Tantra’s pledges of the enlightened body,speech, and mind:The pledge of vajra bodyIs not to despise, even if unaware [of reality],The body of a male or female"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270 Buddhist EthicsWhich is born from many actions.The pledge of vajra mindIs not to torment others in any wayOr to demean one’s mindWith a net of discursive thoughts.The pledge of vajra speechIs to speak gentlyAnd not utter harsh wordsOut of sheer jealousy.228To elaborate, the pledge of the vajra body is never to disrespect thebody of any being, male or female, of the six classes because eachpossesses the nature of the body of enlightenment. The pledge of thevajra mind is not to cause distress to oneself or another by instigatingfeelings of guilt, etc., because all sentient beings possess the nature ofenlightened mind. The pledge of the vajra speech is never to speakharsh words but always gentle ones that please and do not upset oth-ers, because all beings have the nature of enlightened speech. Thesepledges are taught with consistency in many tantras such as the Inde-structible Nucleus’ Ornament Tantra.229The Chakrasamvara Fundamental Tantra presents eight specialpledges:(1) Not to allow the movement of bodhichitta (loss of the semi-nal essence). Bodhichitta is the seed of desire-realm [bliss]gained from relying on an action seal; the seed of form-realm[bliss], from relying on an imaginary seal; and the seed ofthe fruit which is the enlightenment of the great seal.230 Thus,not to lose the seminal essence serves as the cause for all pow-erful attainments.(2) To cultivate [or safeguard] the pledge,231 which means to causethe sixteen [aspects of] bliss to gradually arise at the throat,heart, navel, and genital focal points of energy by using thepassion of the wisdom-woman.(3) Not to unite with the emissary of another buddha family af-ter having discarded the consort of one’s own buddha fam-ily if one’s purpose is that of gaining only outer attainments.232(4) To attain the undivided state at the end of the full moon,233which means to fulfill the pledges related to the four seminalessences of the four focal points of energy by resting in thestate of the indivisibility of emptiness and innate bliss."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 271(5) To shun the waning phase of the moon,234 which means notto lose [the seminal essence] that has the nature of the six-teen joys through the bliss of emission.(6) To churn [or follow] the female conduct235 (the conduct of thetranscendent Samantabhadri236), which means always to ac-complish with joy the many ways to benefit others.(7) To maintain chastity at the face of the vajra,237 which is to al-ways maintain the ethics of not emitting [the seminal essence].(8) To draw [the seminal essences] up the central channel238 whichmeans to draw up and to stabilize at the crown focal point ofenergy the seminal essences that have flowed down to thetip of the secret place by reversing them and experiencingthe joys in the ascending order.[Vajrapani’s] Eulogy-Commentary on the Chakrasamvara Tantra239 ex-plains these eight pledges in detail and states the benefit of safeguard-ing them in these words:A practitioner who at all times cultivates the eight [special]pledges will swiftly gain the attainment of the great seal.In addition to these, there are many classifications of the differentminor pledges presented in the tantras. However, the principal onesare included in those explained above.Other Ways of Enumerating the Pledges [b']Mikyö Gawa asserts that all pledges are included in the fourpledges related to the four initiations:The pledges to be safeguarded, of sustenance, of conduct, andnot to be apart from.The omniscient Mikyö Gawa asserts that all the vows and pledges ofthe Highest Yoga Tantra are included in four pledges related to thefour initiations. These are enumerated briefly as follows:(1) The vows of the vase initiation are comprised by the “pledgeto be honored”: to observe the general and specific pledgesof the five families, and not to commit the fourteen root down-falls and eight secondary ones.(2) The vows of the secret initiation are comprised by the “pledgeof sustenance”: to partake of the five meats and the fivenectars."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272 Buddhist Ethics(3) The vows of the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initia-tion are comprised by the “pledge of conduct”: the specialpledges, to liberate [evil] beings, etc.(4) The vows of the fourth initiation are comprised by the “pledgenot to be apart from”: to wear the attire of Heruka and torely on a wisdom-woman.Pema Karpo presents the pledges of restraint from root down-falls, the pledges of practice of the six families,And the pledges related to practice, which form the threegroups of pledges prescribing ritual articles,Pledges prescribing enjoyments, and pledges of equipoise andpost-equipoise.The omniscient Pema Karpo presents the pledges concerning the four-teen root and secondary downfalls to be avoided, the pledges of thesix families to be practiced, and the common and special pledges re-lating to application240 which are grouped into three categories:(1) the pledges prescribing use of ritual articles, for example, tokeep ritual articles such as images, volumes [of the tantras],and symbolic ornaments241;(2) the pledges prescribing enjoyments, such as to enjoy the fivemeats, five nectars, five drinks, and five types [of consorts]242;(3) the pledges of equipoise, such as the four pledges to be in-terpreted243; and the pledges of post-equipoise, such as thetwenty-five modes of conduct [taught in the Wheel of TimeTantra], the fourteen [modes of conduct taught] in the Inde-structible Tent Tantra, and other post-equipoise pledges.244The victorious Rangjung Dorjé states that all pledges areincluded in four pledges.In his Ocean of Pledges, the omniscient and victorious Rangjung Dorjéstates:The Three Jewels and inner and outer awakening mind;Perceived and perceiver; outer and inner conditions;Activity of annihilation and liberation;All pledges are included in these."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 273All pledges are condensed into these four pledges: not to renouncethe Three Jewels or the outer relative and inner ultimate awakeningminds; not to harbor doubts about the purity of the object perceivedand the perceiver; to rely on the outer and inner conducive condi-tions; and not to neglect the activity of annihilation and liberation atthe proper time.All of these pledges are encompassed by two categories:prohibitions and injunctions.All the pledges that have been presented fall into two categories: pro-hibitions, which are prescriptions for restraint; and injunctions, pre-scriptions for what to practice. The first includes root downfalls, sec-ondary downfalls, and the modes of conduct. The second includesthe vows of the five families and the pledges of the higher initiations.Six modes of conduct are taught in Tent Tantra for practitionerswho have reached the stage of warmth.The Indestructible Tent Tantra prescribes six modes of conduct to beperformed by a practitioner who has achieved a stable state of con-templation and has attained the pristine awareness of experientialwarmth245:Do not perform symbolic hand gestures.Do not build reliquaries [or cast votive images].Do not bow to the [representations of the] exalted three vajras[i.e., body, speech, and mind of the buddhas].Do not draw mandalas, or do other outer rituals.Do not do these even in your dreams.Honor your tantric master, [his lineage,] and [spiritual] siblings,But do not pay homage to other teachers.Practitioners who have perfected pristine awareness are beyondcodes of behavior.A practitioner who has attained a deep level of realization and hasperfected pristine awareness has transcended all the creations of du-alistic thought, concepts of vows and transgressions, codes of behav-ior prescribing what to do and what not to do, proper and improperconduct, and so on.

To have engagedin the very cause of the downfall but without having allowed the dead-line for acknowledgment to pass and with one of the other factors miss-ing is equivalent to a serious transgression in the monastic code. Tohave engaged in the very cause of the downfall but without the dead-line having passed and with more than one of the other factors missingis equivalent to a downfall [that requires forfeiture or confession alone]in the monastic code. To have pursued the wrongdoing with physicalaction or words in the absence of all the other factors is equivalent to aminor infraction in the monastic code. One also incurs minor infrac-tions when one transgresses the pledges due to not recollecting them.246"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 275The eight secondary downfalls are classified as serious transgres-sions, downfalls, or minor infractions depending on [the presence ofmany or few of] the seven completing factors.The Essence Ornament of the General Procedure for All Secrets247 statesthat in certain cases transgressions of the pledges may seem to bedownfalls but in fact are not: when done for a greater purpose, suchas seeing that others would benefit; when observing a pledge wouldcause an obstacle [for one’s life]; when one has received permissionto do so [from a master or favored deity]; or when unable [to keep thepledges] because of illness, etc.A different explanation, which is essentially the same as the expla-nation given above, specifies the following five factors (person, ob-ject, attitude, enactment, and conclusion) that complete a downfall:(1) the person, a holder of [previously] unviolated pledges;(2) the object, one’s vajra master, for example, and recognitionof the object;(3) the attitude, feeling no shame in transgressing the pledge,not trying to avoid the downfall, and afterwards beingpleased and having no regret about it;(4) the enactment, to engage in the actual transgression;(5) the conclusion, the consummation of that act.The factors that lead to transgressions are stated in the DakinisamvaraTantra248 :Six factors lead to the violation of pledges:Ignorance [of the pledges], heedlessness,Overwhelming emotions, irreverence,Forgetfulness, and weak mindfulness.Practitioners who strive to overcome these factors will naturally honortheir pledges.In general, all the pledges of Secret Mantra are very strict and re-quire extreme caution. In particular, it is imperative not to disrespectone’s vajra master. To do so, even while honoring all other pledges, islike cutting the root of a tree.Means to Restore Pledges [ii']The Essence Ornament teaches twenty-five means of restoration.It is imperative that pledges be restored if a downfall has been in-curred. The general means of restoration are as follows: [In the Wheelof Time tantra,] one who has received only [the first] seven initiations249"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"276 Buddhist Ethicsmust recite thirty-six thousand mantras for each deity of the mandalaand then retake the seven initiations with the intention never to trans-gress the pledges again. One who has received the uncommon vaseand secret initiations must retake the initiation after having appliedthe means of restoration indicated by the vajra master. The EssenceOrnament of the General Procedure for All Secrets250 lists twenty-fivemeans of restoring the pledges:(1) Confession to [the deities who form] the field of merit; (2)purification with the mantra and gesture of separating thehands [taught in Yoga Tantra];(3) Ablutions with the outer [water of the vase of the initiation]and the inner [receiving of the initiations of the five buddhafamilies from the deities in the sky]; (4) burning the seedsyllables [at the navel] with the fire of inner heat;(5) Contemplation in the state of non-origination [of the threeroles]; (6) taking the four outer [initiations from the master]and inner [self-]initiations;(7) Acknowledgment before a [tantric feast gathering or another]gathering [of practitioners after the offerings have been done];(8) making confession while expressing great remorse before aconsecrated representation [of the enlightened body, speech,and mind];(9) Offering the mandala [plus wealth and merits, and thenconfessing to the three representations]; (10) buildingreliquaries of the joyful ones [or votive images];(11) Purification by means of [the elaborated] appeasing fire[rituals or the ritual of Vajradaka]; (12) performing vastofferings of torma;(13) Reciting the mantra of one’s favored deity; (14) cultivatingprofound contemplation [quiescence and insight];(15) Saving the lives of beings; (16) reading the discourses andthe tantras;(17) Devoting oneself to the master; (18) performing profoundself-initiation [after completing recitation of Samayasattva’smantra];(19) Reciting the one-hundred-syllable mantra of the joyful ones[in front of or while circumambulating a stupa of greatblessing]; (20) repeating recollection mantras [that are praisedfor their purificatory effectiveness] on the auspicious occa-sions [of the eighth and fifteenth of the lunar month];(21) Reciting the confession of infractions [the Three-PartDiscourse] in the six periods [of the day and night]; (22)performing the meditation and recitation of the mantra ofVajrasattva;"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 277(23) Cultivating mystic union with the three vajras [the seedsyllables OM, AH, and HUM at the forehead, throat, andheart] of the vajra master [while visualizing oneself in adeity’s form];(24) Performing the yoga of the glorious seminal essence; and(25) [performing] the subtle yoga.251Fire ritual, recitation of mantra, meditation, ritual feast, etc.Are the means to purify downfalls, transgressions, violations,and ruptures.Any downfall, regardless of its seriousness, can be purified ifacknowledged before three hours have elapsed.Of the special means of restoring pledges, all of the higher and lowertantras emphasize the fire ritual for purifying wrong deeds, in par-ticular, the fire ritual of Vajradaka252; the meditation and the recita-tion of the mantra of one’s favored deity; and actual ritual feasts orsimilar celebrations of heroes, [heroines,]253 etc. Since these are alloutstanding means of restoration, they should be engaged in withincreasing energy and for a greater number of times depending onwhether the transgression is a deterioration, a violation, or a rupture.To elaborate, transgressions become increasingly serious the longerthe delay before taking remedial measures. [The different types of]transgressions are designated as follows: (1) infractions not amendedwithin a period; (2) contraventions; (3) deteriorations; (4) violations;and (5) ruptures. An infraction not amended within a period is a trans-gression that has not been remedied within three hours (one of thesix periods of day and night). A contravention is a transgression thathas not been remedied within the same day. A deterioration is a trans-gression that has not been remedied within a month. A violation is atransgression that has not been remedied within a year. A rupture is atransgression that has not been remedied within two, or three, years.If, within three years of the occurrence of a transgression, one ac-knowledges it sincerely and perseveres in applying [the means ofpurification], one can rise above it. However, after more than threeyears have elapsed, the transgression becomes irreparable and theperpetrator will certainly be reborn in hell. Hence, one must strive toprevent downfalls occurring in the first place, arresting them withthe remedies of mindfulness and discriminative alertness. If a down-fall does occur, regardless of its seriousness, it can be purified if oneacknowledges it before three hours have elapsed."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"278 Buddhist EthicsMeditation and recitation of the mantra of Vajrasattva andSamayavajra,Initiation, and self-initiation are the best means for purification.The principal means to remedy transgressions acknowledged withina period of three hours are the meditation and the recitation of themantras of Vajrasattva and Samayavajra,254 practices which are botheasy and very effective. To receive an initiation or to perform by one-self the ritual of entering into the outer and inner mandalas are themost effective means of restoration since they are related to that verypurpose [purification]. Therefore, tantras repeatedly state that nothingis more worthwhile than to exert oneself at these practices at all times.The first step is to first verbally acknowledge the downfall before agathering [of practitioners] or a [sacred] representation; the second,to perform self-initiation or retake the initiation; and finally, to applythe methods to purify wrong deeds. This is the procedure followedby all great vajra holders.Higher pledges are restored through self-blessing and the view.[According to the Wheel of Time Tantra,] those who have received allof the special higher initiations255 cannot purify transgressions of thepledges by simply using the common means employed to purify nega-tive deeds in general. Pledges must be renewed in the following ways:meditation on the creation phase whereby merit is cultivated; thestages of self-blessing (such as the subtle [yoga and the yoga] of theseminal essence)256 whereby ethics is cultivated; enhancement of theblissful pristine awareness [ensuing] from the melting [of the semi-nal essence]; and constant equipoise in the view free of the conceptsof the three spheres—agent, act, and recipient [whereby pristineawareness is cultivated]. In other words, the pledges assumed in thecourse of the vase initiation [and those assumed in the secret initia-tion or those in the initiations of lower tantras] can be restored by themeans indicated by the spiritual master, but [the pledges of the higherinitiations of the Highest Yoga Tantra] must be restored by [realiza-tion of] the perfect purity of one’s own mind.Mantric Vows in the Ancient Tantras [2]The presentation of the vows according to the Ancient Translationsof the Secret Mantra has three [parts]: (1) a general presentation ofthe vows common to Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga; (2) a classi-fication of the vows of each system; and (3) deterioration of the pledgesand their restoration."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 279General Presentation of Vows Common to Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga [a]This section has two parts: (1) a concise statement, and (2) an exten-sive explanation.Concise Statement [i]In the tradition of the Ancient Translations, the pledgescommon to the spiritual ways of skill in meansAre the general pledges, the particular, and the exceptionalones.The long tradition of the Ancient Translations enumerates nine spiri-tual ways.257 The vows most widely known and common to the threehigher ways [Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga] are of three types,the general, particular, and exceptional pledges. These are taught inthe Yoga of General Cleansing, the Union of Joyful Ones, Peaceful Tantra,and other tantras.The etymological definition of pledge (Tib. dam tshig) is “an oaththat is firm and hard to transgress.” Thus, as has been explained above[in the new tantras], pledge refers to an oath that must be preservedjust as it has been made and not transgressed or allowed to deterio-rate. Pledge also means “strict” in consideration of [the strict conse-quences of] observance or its transgression. The Condensed HerukaTantra258 states:It is said that by not transgressing it, one becomes a supreme(dam) being;By transgressing it, one will burn (tshig) [in hell].Extensive Explanation [ii]The general pledges are the limits to be observed in thepersonal liberation precepts, awakening mind commitments,and the pledges of the three outer tantras.The particular pledges are the root pledges of body, speech,mind, and awakening mind, andThe secondary pledges of the five to practice, five not torenounce,Five to accept, five to recognize, and five to integrate.Practitioners should safeguard and engage in the provisionaland definitive meanings of these pledgesIn accordance with circumstances. The exceptional pledgesconcern familiarization and attainment practice.General pledges common [to the three systems] refers to the limits tobe observed as prescribed by the personal liberation precepts, the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"280 Buddhist Ethicsawakening mind commitments, and the pledges of the three outerclasses of tantra [Action, Conduct, and Yoga tantras]. The particularpledges are the root pledges related to the body, speech, mind, andawakening mind of a buddha, and the five sets of five secondarypledges—the five to practice, the five not to renounce, the five to ac-cept, the five to recognize, and the five to integrate. The exceptionalpledges are twenty pledges that must be honored especially duringfamiliarization and attainment practices.259[The general pledges have been explained above.] Of the particu-lar pledges, the root pledge of the body of a buddha is to guard one’srelationships with the vajra master and spiritual siblings. There aresix masters to be honored, as stated in Lilavajra’s Shimmering Light onthe Pledges260:Masters who are teachers of all, who lead [one to theteachings], initiate, and [bestow] pledges,Restore infractions, open one’s mind,Or transmit secret instructions.261In what way each should be honored is illustrated by correspondingexamples262:Regard them more highly than these:The king of your country, your uncle, father, or mother,Your own eyes, or your heart.In particular, as stated in the Union of Joyful Ones, Peaceful Tantra, oneshould regard the three masters who initiate, explain the tantra, andtransmit secret instructions more highly than, or at least equal to, theBuddha, or as a fourth Jewel. Without hypocrisy, one should honormasters by doing, through actions, words, and thoughts, whateverpleases them and by following their every directive.Moreover, [as stated in Lilavajra’s Shimmering Light,263] one mustmaintain spiritual bonds with the four [types of] siblings:(1) [All sentient beings,] one’s general siblings;(2) [All Buddhists,] distant siblings;(3) [All Buddhists who follow the same conduct and view,] closesiblings;(4) [Mantra practitioners with whom one shares the same tantricmaster, initiation, etc.,] intimate siblings."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 281One should honor spiritual siblings while showing loving concernfor them, and must never forsake them, particularly the latter threewho have entered the authentic path, and even more so, intimate sib-lings, knowing that these relationships are increasingly significant inthat order.The root pledge of the speech of a buddha is to recite the threekinds of incantation, to practice the four seals, and to make offerings,as stated in the Shimmering Light264:To recite the root, generation, and action mantras,And apply the four [seals]: the seal of the pledge, action seal,seal of the teachings,And the two awakened dimensions [as the] great seal.In applying oneself to the three kinds of incantation265 and the fourseals, the best effort would be a practice that never ceases, like thecurrent of a river [done without distraction in the day and night medi-tation sessions]; a moderate effort, a practice carried out [uninterrupt-edly in the four or six periods] of the day of the new moon [and otherspecial days]; and a minimal effort, a practice of not neglecting themonthly or annual performance of [ritual feast and] food offerings(torma) on [special] days.The root pledge of the mind of a buddha is not to proclaim the tensecrets to those without pledges or those who have violated them, or toordinary people. The ten secrets are enumerated in the Shimmering Light266:Profound view, outrageous conduct,The deity’s name and mantra, and signs of accomplishment:These are the four general secrets.And:Engage in tantric practice while keeping [four] transitional secrets:The place [of gathering], the time, one’s companions, and theritual articles.These are the four general and four transitional secrets. The remain-ing two are innermost secrets: The secrets worthy to be kept are theexceptional mantric conduct and the substances of the pledges,267and what is unfit to be seen or heard, such as the bad behavior ofone’s spiritual siblings. Entrusted secrets concern instructions, etc.,that the vajra master or spiritual siblings have sealed as secret bycommand."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"282 Buddhist EthicsThe root pledge of awakening mind consists in the pledge of theview, the realization of the abiding nature of [reality], the indivisibil-ity of the [two] superior truths268 which transcends the [mind’s] expe-riential domain. To fulfill this pledge, one must train in the aspiringand venturing aspects of awakening mind. To train in the mind ofaspiration is to focus on the result, which is actualized without aban-doning or attaining anything. To train in the venturing mind is toactualize the result by bringing all one's experiences onto the path aspure vision. [This is possible] since all experiences of one's body,speech, and mind, and their domains, which are expressions of thepristine awareness present within oneself, never transcend the sealsof the deity's body, speech, and mind.Of the secondary particular pledges, the five pledges prescribingwhat to practice have both provisional and hidden meanings. To ful-fill the provisional meanings, one engages in sexual union, release,theft, speaking untruth, and speaking outrageously, provided theseare done without selfish motives, but as skillful means, and to benefitothers. The hidden meanings of these pledges are as follows:(1) Release means to sever the life of dualistic thoughts with self-experienced pristine awareness;(2) Theft is to steal the seminal essence (bliss) from the queen(consort)269;(3) Union is to achieve immutable bliss through the bliss experi-enced in melting [the seminal essence] while uniting [with aconsort];(4) Speaking untruth is to say that living beings are [already]liberated from the apparent yet non-existent cycle of existence;(5) Speaking outrageously is to speak without inhibitions froman inexpressible state of spiritual accomplishment.To fulfill the provisional meanings of the five pledges that prescribewhat not to renounce, one does not renounce the five poisons of nega-tivity [emotions] just as they are270 as proclaimers [who regard themas enemies] do, but engages in them with skill in means. This is be-cause these five poisons serve as a direct path to liberation and be-cause their nature is primordially that of the five pristine awarenesses.To fulfill the hidden meanings, one does not renounce the five per-fect poisons:(1) The stupidity that does not differentiate between what topractice and what to refrain from and that is impartial in itsview since all things are perfect in the state of sameness;"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 283(2) The attachment that is the affection developed from non-objectifying great compassion for living beings who lackrealization of the view;(3) The hatred that subdues misconceptions with self-experi-enced pristine awareness;(4) The pride that does not descend from the heights of the viewthat realizes the sameness [of phenomena];(5) The jealousy that does not accommodate dualistic views orconduct in the vast expanse of sameness.One must not renounce these five, [but should accept them] with theskillful means to experientially cultivate the state of inner realization.To fulfill the provisional meanings of the five pledges that prescribewhat to accept, one accepts the five nectars [of the pledge’s substances]:(1) the great fragrant solids [feces],(2) fragrant water [urine],(3) blood,(4) flesh,(5) vajra dew [semen].These five must not be rejected but instead should be accepted [with-out concepts of clean or dirty] because they are the nature of realityitself, and by virtue of their very essence and potency and throughconsecration, these are special substances used to gain attainments.To fulfill the hidden meanings, one binds and does not lose thepure essences of the five aggregates.To fulfill the five pledges that prescribe what to recognize, one mustrecognize the following (since all phenomena exist primordially asenlightenment):(1) the five aggregates as the five male transcendent ones;(2) the five elemental properties as the five female transcendentones;(3) the five sense organs and their five consciousnesses as themale bodhisattvas;(4) the five sense objects as the female bodhisattvas;(5) the colors [associated with] the five families as the five pris-tine awarenesses.All conceptual representations of these five sets of five phenomenashould be recognized as the mandala of pristine awareness and itsdimensions271 with the wisdom that cuts through misapprehension[of the nature of these phenomena]."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284 Buddhist EthicsTo fulfill the five pledges that prescribe what to integrate, one must,having gained an experiential understanding of the five pledges thatprescribe what to recognize, persevere in the means to correctly ef-fect the integration of this understanding within one’s mind.[The pledges prescribing] what to recognize are pledges of the view.Once those are realized, one observes [the pledges prescribing] whatto integrate, which are pledges of meditation.

First, the five root[pledges] are each divided into two by differentiating them in termsof skill in means and wisdom. Added to these are the one hundredand fifty pledges which result from a subdivision into thirty of eachof the five root pledges. To these are added two hundred furtherpledges derived from subdividing each of the ten secondary pledgesinto twenty. Thus, it is impossible to enumerate all pledges becauseeach can be elaborated upon indefinitely to provide a pledge to coun-teract every discursive thought.

Inturn, the higher pledges [of Mahayoga] are superior to the commit-ments of the Universal Way and the pledges of the lower tantras dueto sevenfold greatness.

Theseare four pledges to purify completely one’s body, speech, mind, andperceptual range.(2) Twenty-eight pledges in common with the other tantras. The rootpledges are the three pledges of vajra body, speech, and mind. Thesecondary pledges are the five pledges prescribing what to practice,the five to renounce, the five to accept, the five to recognize, and thefive to integrate, as explained above.(3) Four superior pledges. These pledges concern the perfect realiza-tion of the abiding nature of reality:(1)The pledge to perfectly realize that all pledges, in their ulti-mate nature, are free of transgression or deterioration, andare therefore without limits to be observed;(2)The pledge to perfectly realize that the expressions of all vowsand pledges transcend the forms of dualistic clinging andare therefore all-pervasive simplicity;(3)The pledge to perfectly realize that all vows and pledges areencompassed by the single expanse of the mind’s nature;(4)The pledge to perfectly realize that all vows and pledges arenaturally pure and spontaneously fulfilled in the state thatdoes not stray from the inconceivable realm of reality.(4) Twenty-three pledges prescribing conduct. The sixty-fourth chap-ter [of the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions] illustrates thisset of pledges through analogies, such as the fox, the centaur, and thethoroughbred. These pledges and the meanings of their analogies areexplained by the Great Nub Sangyé Yeshé288 and others as follows:"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"288 Buddhist Ethics(1)[The pledge to be] like the fox who, when caught in a trap,will escape with its paw torn off, without regard for its life.This pledge prescribes the conduct (Tib. brtul zhug), whichis the means to overcome (brtul) all unfavorable conditionsand enter (zhug) into the power of the pledges, wherebythe yogin [or yogini] guards the pledges, even at the cost oflife itself.(2)The pledge to be like the centaur who is aware of everythingas he, with unfettered speed, circles the globe in an instant.This pledge prescribes the unfettered conduct whereby theyogin applies discriminative wisdom to the general and in-dividual characteristics of all that is knowable.(3)The pledge to be like the thoroughbred who takes each stepwith great impressiveness.

Ifit happens that a pledge is transgressed, it is essential to perform im-mediately the confession rituals methodically, as they appear in thetantras, transmissions, and secret instructions. Not to acknowledge atransgression brings all sorts of misfortune in this life, and in the nextlife one is reborn in the great Vajra Hell of Unceasing Torture, not toescape from it so long as the sky exists. The Secret Moon Essence states:Buddhas and bodhisattvasDo not bestow blessingsOn one who has violated vows and pledges;Even if he were to offerIncense, flowers, or other things,They would not accept them.Killed by enemies, poison, or disease,He will be reborn in hell."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"296 Buddhist EthicsAnd Indrabhuti’s Jnanasiddhi301 says:He who does not keep the pledgesExperiences the miseryOf body, mind, and virtues degenerating,Dies in no time,And thereafter comes upon the sufferingsOf hell for one billion years.Taking another rebirth,He will became an untouchable, a wretch,A deaf person, or a mute.The many tantras of both the Ancient and New traditions unanimouslyagree that these, and others, are the consequences of violating thepledges.Means of Restoration [ii]The proclaimers’ vows, like a clay pot, once broken cannot berepaired;The awakening mind commitments, like gold or silver, can berestored;The tantric pledges, like a dented vessel, are restored by thepractitioner’s strength.When is it possible to restore a vow that has been transgressed? Allthe tantras and transmissions state that if a monk has incurred a de-feat with concealment, the [transgressed] vow, like a broken clay pot,cannot be repaired. An awakening mind commitment that has beentransgressed is like a cracked gold or silver vase which can still besoldered by a blacksmith. A violated vow or pledge in this SecretMantra system is likened to a dented golden vessel, which can bestraightened out by the practitioner’s own strength.Pledges are restored through action, precious substances,earnest desire, contemplation, and reality.The Great Cleansing can purify all transgressions.The General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions lists five methods forrestoring pledges:(1) To renew the pledges through action in the case of a serioustransgression is to perform one hundred and thirty thousandtimes, or more, according to the seriousness, the fire offer-ings or recitation of the mantra [of one’s deity].(2) To renew the pledge through precious substances is to offer,without any sense of loss, one of the [five] gems302 appropriate"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 297to the family whose pledge one has transgressed to a masterwho is of the caste (untouchable, menial, or another caste)that corresponds to the buddha family whose pledge one hastransgressed, while regarding the master as the embodimentof the five buddha families.(3) To renew the pledge with earnest desire means to confessone’s failing with intense regret and shame in a state of clearand longing faith.(4) To renew the pledge in a state of contemplation means toconfess one’s failing with the four forces,303 and while doingso, to imagine that one’s negativity and impediments arepurified by light rays radiating from the three places of thereceptacle [object of refuge].304 In this technique, one imag-ines all negativity is consumed by the fire of contemplation,all darkness is dispelled by light emanating from awakeningmind, [impediments] are washed away by great waves ofaltruistic deeds, and so forth.(5) To renew the pledge by [understanding] transcendent real-ity means that “through great discriminative wisdom, all[karmic] imprints are understood to be without intrinsic re-ality,” as is stated in All-Gathering [Awareness].305 Thus, theperfect means to purify negativity is to cultivate discrimina-tive wisdom that does not objectify the three spheres.A special means consists in applying the threefold renewal taughtin the quintessential instruction of the Great Cleansing Yoga called Emp-tying the Depths of Hell.306 Externally, this involves confession and res-toration through ritual feast; internally, the basis of one’s body [i.e.,the aggregates]; and on the secret level, the state of pure presence(Skt. bodhicitta). It is said that to perform this [practice] on the fif-teenth, thirtieth, and eighth [days of the lunar month] will purify allpledges that one has transgressed. Therefore, it is a method mostworthy of committing oneself to.A SYNOPSIS OF THE PHASES OF THE PATH IN THEINDESTRUCTIBLE WAYThe master Subhagavajra307 enumerates five procedures to be followed:An individual possessed of great fortuneForms an awakening mind, assumes its commitments,And receives initiation in the presence of a holy master;"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"298 Buddhist EthicsHe then observes [the pledges]; learns the nature [of tantra];Purifies his mind; and engages in purificatory conduct:These, in essence, are the five procedures.The first of the five is the initiatory procedure, which effects thematuration [of one’s mind]. The initiation, gateway to the Secret Man-tra, is received when two causes and four conditions are fulfilled.These are the two causes:(1) The concomitant cause, to be an individual possessing thesix elements308 of the adamantine body that is flawless andhas channels, seminal essences, and energy winds, and tohave awakened the affinity for the mind of awakening, thecausal continuity (tantra) that is without beginning or end;(2) The contributory cause, fulfilled by the master’s correct per-formance of the construction of the mandala and the actual-ization and worship [ritual], after having engaged in purifi-cation through the familiarization practice, etc.These are the four conditions:(1) The causal condition of being a worthy candidate for initia-tion (who belongs to one of the five classes of disciples suchas lotus-like309);(2) The principal condition of there being a qualified master toconfer the initiation, who has expertise in the ten outer andinner essential fields [of the tantras310], and who has mas-tered contemplation;(3) The objective condition of the impeccable coordination of sub-stances, mantra, seals, and contemplation [in the initiatoryritual];(4) The immediate condition of the maturation [of the disciple’smind stream], effected by the initial stages of vase initiation,etc., and by the progressive conferral of the later initiations.The second [of the five procedures to be followed] is the procedureof observing the pledges received in the course of an initiation in orderto protect the maturation of one’s mind. The “life force” of the initia-tion refers to the individual pledges taught in the Action, Conduct,and Yoga tantras, and especially the modes of conduct, vows, rootpledges, and secondary pledges, [the pledges concerning] sustenance,and [the pledges] to be safeguarded as taught in Highest [Tantra] withprovisional, definitive, and covert intentions.

To learn the nature of tantra means togain knowledge of the actual tantra (the subject matter of tantra) bystudying the teachings of the tantras (as they are expressed in words)with a spiritual master who applies the four styles311 [of tantric expla-nation]; and to develop discriminating wisdom free of confusion thatexperientially cultivates that knowledge.The fourth is the procedure of purifying one’s mind, which leadsto the attainment of awakening. The purification of the mind and itshabitual tendencies is effected in the following way: for a practitio-ner of the Secret Mantra, the principal aim of all the tantric activitiesis to nurture the seed or potential for awakening. This seed serves asthe primary cause for attaining perfect awakening, the realization ofone’s objective, and the foundation for the accomplishment of oth-ers’ objectives. The two liberating phases [of the tantric path] thatuproot the three impediments312 connected with the propensities ofthe four states313 serve as contributory conditions. In order to trans-form everything into the path of awakening, the view to be realizedis taken as the foundation.In the three lower tantras, one endeavors in deity yogas called “withsigns” and “without signs” or the signless yoga of reality.314 In theHighest [Yoga Tantra], one meditates on the stages of creating thesupporting [mandala] through the three contemplations,315 the fourbranches of familiarization and attainment practice,316 or the sixbranches of the visualization,317 etc. At the end of these practices, oneaccomplishes the charismatic work of a tantric master, such as recita-tion and meditation, making food offerings (torma), consecration andfire rituals, etc. Subsequent [to the creation phase], one cultivates thecompletion stage, reaching perfection in the supported [mandala, i.e.,the deities,] through the practice on the side of the appearance [of thedeity’s form318], on the side of emptiness,319 and the union of thesetwo320; or the practice of self-consecration,321 the mandala circle,322 andprofound indestructible yoga.323The fifth is the procedure of virtuous conduct, which is to engagein the means to perfect the purification of mind. The conduct relatedto skill in means consists of the “all-shaking avadhuti” conduct in-tended for a beginner; the “ever-perfect” conduct intended for an ad-vanced practitioner; and the conduct “victorious in all quarters”324intended for an accomplished practitioner. Alternatively, the conductis presented as “using desire”325 and “training and enjoying desires”"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"300 Buddhist Ethicsassociated with the complex, unelaborated, or utterly simple con-ducts.326 [To engage in these forms of conduct] enhances [the realiza-tion of] the two phases, and one consequently progresses throughthe four [stages of spiritual development] of the individual.327On the three [stages, small, middling, and great,] of the path ofaccumulation, one gains the common attainments328 and an enhancedvividness [of the visualization of the coarse and subtle aspects of themandala]. Following that, on the “stage of warmth” of the path ofpreparation, one consolidates the pristine awareness of bliss andemptiness [resulting] from the wind and mind dissolving into thecentral channel. On the “peak” [stage of the path of preparation], oneexperiences an uninterrupted vision of the circle of deities of the man-dala and attains the [deity’s] dimension [that manifests vividly] inthe absence of conceptualizations.329 On the stage of “receptivity,” ofthe same path, one’s manifest eighty natural conceptualizations330[temporarily] cease. Enhancing pristine awareness, which has thepower to link up to the path of seeing, one reaches the “highest qual-ity” [stage of the path of preparation]. Following this, one practiceswandering in the great outer power places,331 and with respect to theinner [power places], one dissolves channels, winds, and seminal es-sences into the central channel, reaching the provisional result of thetwelve stages. As a result of the proximate cause [of the elaborate,non-elaborate, and simple conduct], one attains the ultimate result ofthe stage of buddha, the union that requires no more learning,332 thestate of Vajradhara endowed with the sevenfold features of [male andfemale deity] facing each other,333 the great lordliness over the incon-ceivable mystery, the highest and eternal state.These phases of the path that begin with the three systems of eth-ics are presented in the form of a synopsis in order to be easily under-stood. They are discussed in detail in latter parts of this treatise [TheInfinite Ocean of Knowledge].GENERAL POINTS ON THE THREE ETHICAL SYSTEMS [II]This section has three [parts]: (1) the number of sets of vows that maybe held by one person, (2) the way the three systems coexist in oneperson, and (3) the benefits of observing ethics."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 301The Number of Sets of Vows Held by One Person [A]A person may hold one, two, or all three sets of vows, etc.;These vows are distinguishable.An individual who has assumed the personal liberation vows of theIndividual Way is a “holder of one set of vows,” since he or she holdsonly those vows but not the vows of the higher two systems of ethics.Someone who has assumed the commitments of awakening mind isa “holder of two sets of vows” because the personal liberation vowsof the Universal Way and the awakening mind commitments are iden-tical with respect to their essence. A practitioner who has assumedthe mantric pledges is a “holder of all three sets of vows” since priorto that he or she must have assumed the personal liberation vowsand awakening mind commitments as well.To elaborate, the three systems of ethics upheld by a monk who isa tantric practitioner exist with identical nature. However, they canbe conceptually distinguished in the following way: the discipline ofrenunciation [of a monk who is a tantric practitioner], in so far as itimplies forsaking harmfulness and its [underlying] basis, comprisesthe [personal] liberation vows. In so far as [such discipline] is accom-panied by an altruistic intention, it comprises the awakening mindcommitments. In so far as it is accompanied by the skillful means ofmaking the result [buddhahood] the path, it comprises the SecretMantra pledges.“Etc.” [in the root verses] refers to individuals who have assumedthe three sets of vows in stages, or those who have first assumed oneof the two higher vows and subsequently assumed personal libera-tion vows.The Way the Three Ethical Systems Coexist in One Person [B]This section has two parts: (1) a concise statement, and (2) an exten-sive explanation.Concise Statement [1]Indian scholars differ from Tibetan scholars in their assertionsOn how all three sets of vows coexist in one person."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"302 Buddhist EthicsAn individual may successively assume the three sets of vows—personal liberation, awakening mind, and mantra—and thereby pos-sess all three sets. In this case, how do these three ethical systemscoexist in one person? Indian and Tibetan scholars differ in their manyassertions on the way the three coexist.Extensive Explanation [2]This section has two parts: (1) the assertions of Indian scholars, and(2) the assertions of Tibetan scholars.The Assertions of Indian Scholars [a]Abhayakara says that the vows are similar in that they share anattitude of restraintBut are distinguished by their forms. The great scholarVibhutichandra assertsThat the higher vows outshine the lower, while remainingdistinct.Six assertions generally [prevalent] in India are presented in the Keyto the Initiation334:(1) The assertion that the personal liberation vows serve as thefoundation for awakening mind commitments, and these asthe foundation for mantric vows;(2) The assertion that the lower vows are refined and enhancedby receiving the higher ones;(3) The assertion that the vows are identical in nature but diver-sified in that the personal liberation vows are outer vows;the awakening mind commitments, inner; and the mantravows, secret.(4) The assertion that the vows are cumulative in that higherones contain the lower ones;(5) The assertion that the vows are graded since by receivingthe higher ones the lower ones are transformed [into thehigher];(6) The assertion that the vows coexist but are unmixed, eachbeing a complete system in its own right.Of these, the assertion of Abhayakara and that of Vibhutichandra aremost widely known in Tibet at present. Abhayakara asserts that just asvarious pieces of gold jewelry share the same nature by virtue of beingmade of gold, but differ in form—a crown, an anklet, a bracelet, etc.—"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 303the three ethical systems share the same nature of being [rooted in]an attitude of restraint, but differ in form. Vibhutichandra’s Stream ofLight on the Three Vows335 states that the three ethical systems are likethe stars, the moon, and the sun, respectively. The higher ones out-shine the lower ones, which become hidden. However, each of thethree ethical systems has a different essence.The Assertions of Tibetan Scholars [b]The incomparable Gampopa and his followers state that thethree ethical systemsAre each of a different essence and should be preserved asprescribed.Faced with dilemma, the higher system takes precedence;Transgressions of the lower vows are thereby overcome; theirqualities are contained in the higher.The systems differ in the way vows are assumed and lost.Gampopa states:[The three ethical systems are] each of a different essence. Thesemust be observed just as prescribed. If faced with a dilemma, thehigher takes precedence. The demerit of transgressing a lowervow is outshined by the merit of [observing] the higher. The quali-ties [of the lower systems] are contained in the higher.To elaborate, the three kinds of ethical systems differ in their scrip-tural origins, preceptors, phases, motivations, ceremonies, precepts,causes of loss of vows, benefits of observing vows, possibilities ofrestoring damaged vows, etc. Therefore, each is of a distinct essence.The form of each is [to prescribe] restraint from what is unwhole-some and to cultivate the remedial correct view. Thus, the three areall of the same nature in being [based on] an attitude of restraint, andall three therefore exist for the same purpose: to serve as remedies[for negative emotions and other impediments]. The vows that per-tain to the circumstances one encounters, whether these involve for-saking an action or applying a remedy, should be observed just asthey are set out in their respective systems.If faced with the dilemma, for example, of partaking of the pledgesubstances at a tantric feast and thus transgressing the discipline ofpersonal liberation or not partaking of them and thus transgressingthe tantric conduct, [the observance of] the higher discipline shouldtake precedence. This is so because if one violates the personal libera-tion vows with a special attitude, [i.e., the mind of awakening,] or"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"304 Buddhist Ethicswith the skill in means [taught in the Secret Mantra], no fault is in-curred. The demerit of transgressing lower vows is outshined [by themerit of observing the higher]. Not only is there no failing or down-fall incurred from the transgression [of a lower vow], but also thegreat benefits from observing higher ethics are accrued. Thus, thequalities [of the lower systems] are contained in the higher. Thesepoints were asserted by Gampopa and his followers,336 who includethe learned and accomplished masters of the four major and eightminor Kagyu schools,337 and especially the omniscient and victoriousSeventh [Karmapa,] Chödrak Gyatso.The venerable Drakpa, the omniscient Longchenpa, and othersAssert that the individual identities of the ethical systems areunmixed; each is complete in prescribing both restraint andrequirements.The essence of one vow changes into the next; thus, the quali-ties of the higher contain the lower.Special conduct makes them compatible with each other.One should observe the most important in any givencircumstance.The venerable uncle Drakpa Gyaltsen and his nephew338 of the Sak-ya school, the omniscient Longchen Rabjampa, and others such asthe great translators Rinchen Zangpo, Rongzom Chözang, and theirfollowers make these assertions: (1) the individual identities of theethical systems are unmixed; (2) each is complete in prescribing re-straint and requirements; (3) the essence of one vow changes into thenext; (4) the qualities of the higher contain those of the lower; (5) spe-cial conduct makes them compatible with each other; (6) in any givencircumstance, the most important is observed.To elaborate, the three ethical systems differ in their preceptors,ceremonies, benefits, etc. Therefore, their individual identities areunmixed. However, the three sets of ethical systems have identicalaims with respect to what is to be refrained from and what is required:to relinquish ordinary emotions and to release the fetters of the emo-tions. Thus, each system is complete in its prescriptions of what torestrain from and what is required.In the manner of [extracting] copper from copper ore and then pre-paring with it the elixir that transforms poor metals into gold, if the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"The Vows and Pledges of Secret Mantra 305personal liberation vows are imbued with the awakening mind whichis the distinguishing feature of the Universal Way, [they become Uni-versal Way] vows, and if accompanied by the special skill in meansand wisdom, they become mantric vows. Thus, one essence changesinto the next.In following the higher ethical systems, the restraints and require-ments [in the lower systems] are included in the restraints and re-quirements of the higher system. The qualities [of the higher system]are thereby contained in the lower.Therefore, although certain [higher] vows may seem to be incom-patible [with lower ones], such is not the case by virtue of their viewand special conduct of skill in means.Moreover, one should observe [the vow] that is most significant inany given situation. The great scholar Pema Wangyal states339:The wise give this advice: when amid a group of people, orwhen a deed would be naturally unvirtuous,The lower vows [of the proclaimers] should have precedence.When no selfish desire is involved, [physical and verbalunvirtuous acts are permitted].When engaged in tantric activities, or living in solitude, mantricvows [are most important].If there is no dilemma about which one to follow, guard allwithout mixing them.Faced with a dilemma, weigh the act in terms of restraint andrequirement.The Gedenpas assert that the three sets of ethical systems aredistinct and that each one is the foundation of the next.Each of these assertions is substantiated by scriptural refer-ences and reasonings.According to the followers of the Riwo Gedenpa,340 the three ethicalsystems are distinct in their styles since each has its own way to as-sume vows and its own causes of deterioration. [When higher vowsare assumed,] the lower [vows] become branches of them, as when asapphire is placed in a clean jug filled with limpid water, the waterreflects the color of the jewel. Thus, the higher system has as its foun-dation the lower one.All of the [above] assertions seem to be substantiated by scripturesand reasonings drawn from the different ethical systems."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"306 Buddhist EthicsThe Benefits of Observing Ethics [C]A supreme vajra holder endowed with the three sets of vowswho perseveres in practiceWill attain the rank of Vajradhara in one lifetime and in thesame body.A vajra holder possessed of three sets of vows, supreme among allmantric adepts, or anyone who has entered the door of the SecretMantra and who safeguards the pledges and perseveres in the expe-riential cultivation of the path, will attain the state of Vajradhara in asingle lifetime, in the same body.

The eight root downfalls thatapply to beginners are to teach emptiness to the untrained,To cause another to give up the intention to awaken, to makesomeone abandon the Individual Way,To assert that the Individual Way does not conquer emotions, topraise oneself and belittle others,To falsely claim realization of emptiness, to cause a king to inflict afine and then accept stolen property as a bribe,To disrupt meditation or to give the possessions of a contemplativemonk to one who merely recites scriptures.Downfalls for average practitioners are to give up awakening mind,Be ungenerous, angry, or hypocritical.An obtuse practitioner must at least maintain the aspiration toawaken.The secondary infractions number eighty: twenty-four stem fromdisinterest in others’ happiness or suffering;Sixteen stem from neglecting to accomplish greater goals.Each may be incidental or continuous.The commitments may be lost in six ways, such as giving up refuge.While a root downfall may damage some aspects of the venturingmind,As long as aspiration is present, the commitments cannot be lost.To restore the commitments, one invokes Akashagarbha andacknowledges the downfall in his presence."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"318 Buddhist EthicsIf the time limit for confession has passed, one restores the commit-ments using the four forces.One should promise to train in the prescribed practice only to theextent and for as long as one estimates one can.In the magnificent deeds tradition, commitments of aspiring mindare assumed by a holder of one of the seven personal liberationvowsBefore an erudite and competent master who abides by the samecommitments.The commitments of venturing mind are bestowed only after thescriptures are studied.The extensive rite for the venturing mind includes an inquiryconcerning obstacles, etc.A practitioner must guard against four root downfalls and forty-sixsecondary infractions.The root downfalls are to praise oneself and belittle others out ofattachment to wealth and honor;Not to give material aid or not to give teachings to the needy out ofmiserliness;Not to forgive someone though he has apologized and to strike himin anger;To abandon the Universal Way and to present false teachings astrue Buddhism.Depending on the strength of involvement, the downfall may beserious, moderate, or light.The seven contradictions to generosity are not to make offerings, toindulge in desires, not to have respect,Not to answer questions, not accept invitations, to refuse gifts, andnot to explain the teachings.The nine contradictions to ethics are to reject the immoral, not toobserve the rules, to make little effort for others’ sake,Not to commit an unvirtuous deed although permitted, to engagein wrong livelihood, to play out of excitement and agitation,To wish for a solitary escape from cyclic existence, not to avoid abad reputation, and not to resort to disquieting methods.Four contradictions to patience are to neglect the four obligations,to reject an angry person,To refuse apologies, and to give in to anger."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Root Verses from The Encompassment of All Knowledge 319The three contradictions to effort are to gather followers, not toovercome laziness, and to delight in meaningless conversation.The three contradictions to meditation are not to seek instructions,not to overcome impediments, and to be attached to the pleasur-able experience of meditation.The eight contradictions to wisdom are to reject the proclaimers’way, to embrace that way or a non-Buddhist one,To prefer its literature, to take no interest in the distinctive featuresof the Universal Way, not to seek the true teachings,To praise oneself and belittle others, and to rely on the words ratherthan the meaning:These thirty-four contradictions prevent the development ofwholesome qualities.Not to help persons in need, not to care for the sick, not to relieveothers’ suffering,Not to correct the heedless; not to repay kindness, not to relievepain, not to be generous,Not to care, not to comply, not to praise, not to correct,Not to uplift others: these twelve contradict working for others’benefit. Infractions are of three types: emotional, non-emotional,and without consequence.If a root downfall is committed with great emotional involvementor if the aspiration for awakening has deteriorated,The commitments are lost and must be reassumed.Downfalls committed with medium or slight involvement areconfessed before three vow holders or one;Emotional minor infractions, before one; and non-emotional minorinfractions, with one’s mind as witness.In this tradition, one must observe all points of training to their fullextent and until awakening.Common to both traditions are five precepts for the aspiringawakening mind:Not to reject any being; to ponder benefits; to acquire merits; torefine the awakening mind;And to shun the four black deeds of deceiving one’s master or avenerable person, feeling regret for what is not to be regretted,Being angry at a bodhisattva, and being cunning and deceitful,And to undertake the four white deeds in their place."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"320 Buddhist EthicsOne should have the three noble aspirations of goal, skillful means,and marvelous activity;And eliminate despair, apprehension, and other emotions thatcause aspiration to deteriorate.The points of training in venturing mind prescribe both what toavoid and what to practice.All these points are included in the threefold ethics of restraint,acquiring good qualities, and working for the benefit of others.The prescription for what to avoid corresponds to the commitmentsset out in the two traditions mentioned above.One should renounce what is naturally unwholesome orunwholesome by prescription except in cases of special necessity,Impediments to the spiritual maturity of oneself and others,Pleasures of this life that create suffering in the next, or what causesmisery in both,Deeds that qualify as downfalls, and downfalls-in-disguise;And undertake what brings happiness in the next life though ispainful in the present, what brings happiness in both,Deeds that do not constitute downfalls, and those that might seemto be downfalls but are not.All actions done with compassionate concern are without fault.The prescribed practice corresponds to the ethics aimed at acquiringgood qualities, which is the practice of the six perfections.The perfections are described in terms of their number, order,characteristics,Semantic meaning, divisions, and groups.Each perfection is threefold: Generosity of material aid, the teachings,protection,Ethics of restraint, aimed at acquiring good qualities, and workingfor the benefit of others,Patience to withstand harm, accept hardships, and fathomemptiness,Effort that is armor-like, applied to the task, and insatiable,Meditation of resting at ease, aimed at acquiring good qualities,and focused on the welfare of others,Wisdom that is worldly and supramundane, higher and lower,Or wisdom that arises through listening, pondering, and meditating.When wisdom is present, all five become supramundane perfections."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Root Verses from The Encompassment of All Knowledge 321Four means of attraction and other ways are used to benefit others.Awakening mind and its training are safeguarded with mindfulnessand discriminating alertness.A great wave of altruistic deeds is the cause of an ultimateawakening mind.Its essence is the pristine awareness of an exalted bodhisattva’sequipoise.It may be divided into the awakening mind of the first stage, andso forth.Some scholars assert that ultimate awakening mind can be formedin a ritual; others deny this.Ultimate awakening mind possessed of three ultimate aspectsIs the pristine awareness that directly realizes the sphere of reality.To damage awakening mind brings four adverse consequences. Tosafeguard aspiration reaps eight merits; and venturing mind,two special ones.The awakening mind is indeed the source of all temporary andlasting benefits and happiness.The two systems of awareness-holder vows are the new and theancient.In the system of the later translations, some enter the Secret Mantragradually; others, straightaway.Mantric vows are essentially the resolve, accompanied by itsconcomitant factors,To train in methods to experience blissful pristine awareness inorder to bind grasping to subject and object and the propensityfor movement.In short, the ethics consist in the discipline of binding body, speech,and mind with skill in means and wisdom.Three types of vows are distinguished according to subject matter:The causal tantra’s vow to bind all phenomena, form, sound, etc.,within innate pristine awareness;The vow of the tantra of skillful means to bind subtle and grossobjectifying thoughts within the creation and completion phases;And the resultant tantra’s vow to bind subjective experience withinthe nature of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awareness."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"322 Buddhist EthicsFour classes of tantra teach the actual tantra: Action, Conduct,Yoga, and Highest Yoga tantras.Three kinds of mantric vows are distinguished according to initiatoryrituals in which they are assumed:The mantra’s own personal liberation and awakening mind vowsassumed during regular confession;Vows of divine fortune taken upon entry into the mandala;And the creation and completion vows assumed in the main part ofan initiation.The vows are assumed with a promise upon entry into themandala,Or in their entirety at the end of the initiation.The vows’ seeds are planted when the body, speech, and mind areconsecrated;They are formed with the promise to maintain them and blessed bythe descent of pristine awareness;The main conferral of initiation brings them to the apex.Mantric vows of the lower tantras are called incomplete or partiallycomplete;And those of the higher tantras, fully complete.Bliss and emptiness, as two or as one, embrace all vows.Although no discrimination is made with regard to aspirants,A person unable to safeguard as much as the common vowsIs not to be initiated but may enter the mandala.Vows and pledges assumed during the initiation must besafeguarded like one’s life.Four pledges constitute the foundation common to all tantras:To maintain correct view, refuge, and awakening mind, and toreceive the mandala’s initiation.The fourteen general pledges of Action TantraAre to have faith in the Three Jewels and in mantra, to have earnestinterest in the Universal Way,To be devoted to the supreme field of merits, not to be angry withdeities, to make offerings on special occasions,Not to venerate other traditions, to honor guests, to be alwaysbenevolent,To acquire merit, to exert oneself in reciting the mantra and insafeguarding other commitments,Not to teach mantras or mudras to those without pledges, and toaccomplish the aim of the tantras."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Root Verses from The Encompassment of All Knowledge 323Practitioners must

sacred doctrine,Not give up one’s awakening mind, not be miserly, and not harmothers.The means of restoration of the Action Tantra’s pledges also applyto the Conduct and Yoga Tantra.Yoga Tantra pledges consist of fourteen injunctions and fourteenprohibitions.Injunctions related to the five families are to take refuge in theThree Jewels, commit oneself to the vajra, bell, and master,Practice the four generosities, uphold the three ways, and makeofferings.The prohibitions are not to forsake the Jewels and the awakeningmind,Not disrespect the deity, mantra and seals, and master, not stepover sacred objects,Not eat wrong foods, not divulge the secrets, not forsake mantraand seals, not harm others, not delight in the Individual Way,Not despair, not forsake the training, and not

be learned from other sources.Explanatory tantras teach the pledges of the five families, generalpledges, and pledges given in the concise proclamation.The general root pledges are to shun the fourteen defeats for abodhisattva.The branches are the ethics of restraint from the four root offensesand from drinking alcohol;The ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities by devoting oneself

common vows are assumedas part of those given in the concise proclamation.The vows to be safeguarded by all are taken with a promise,While the vows not to commit the ten infractions, etc., are assumedthrough initiation.Highest Yoga Tantra prescribes three disciplines: conduct, vows,and pledges.Each tantra presents its special forms of conduct.The Guhyasamaja Tantra teaches the conduct of the five families andfour pledges to be interpreted.The Chakrasamvara tantras speak of twenty-two modes of pureconduct and eight concerning the awareness woman.Fourteen conducts are enumerated in the Tent Tantra; nine, in theUnsurpassable Tantra.The Wheel of Time Tantra prescribes twenty-five modes of conduct.Five consist in refraining from the four root offenses and fromdrinking alcohol.Twenty consist in abstaining from the five related ill-deeds ofgambling, eating impure food, reading perverse subjects,Making sacrifices for ancestors, and extremist religious practices;Five murders of killing an animal, child, man, woman, ordestroying reliquaries;Five kinds of enmity toward friends, leaders, the Buddha, theBuddhist community, or a trustworthy person;Five desires related to form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation.These modes of conduct form the foundation of all vows andpledges.The common vows are those of the five families, or the six:For the Akshobhya family, to keep the seals and master;For the jewel, to practice the ten kinds of generosity; for the wheel,to rely on ten foods;For the sword, to make offerings; for the lotus, to maintain vows ofretention;For Vajrasattva, to cultivate a mind of awakening.

There are many other ways toenumerate secondary downfalls.The subtle infractions include fifteen concerning charismaticactivity and seven branches.The tantras give numerous classifications of the pledges, thepledges of the four initiations, etc.Mikyö Gawa asserts that all pledges are included in the fourpledges related to the four initiations:The pledges to be safeguarded, of sustenance, of conduct, and notto be apart from.Pema Karpo presents the pledges of restraint from root downfalls,the pledges of practice of the six families,And the pledges related to practice, which form the three groups ofpledges prescribing ritual articles,Pledges prescribing enjoyments, and pledges of equipoise and post-equipoise.The victorious Rangjung Dorjé states that all pledges are includedin four pledges.All of these pledges are encompassed by two categories: prohibitionsand injunctions."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326 Buddhist EthicsSix modes of conduct are taught in Tent Tantra for practitioners whohave reached the stage of warmth.Practitioners who have perfected pristine awareness are beyondcodes of behavior.A defeat occurs when there is motivation, recognition, pursuing,separation,Lack of regret, non-deranged state of mind, and overdueacknowledgment.If some completing factors are missing, the infraction may be aserious transgression, downfall, or a minor infraction.The Essence Ornament teaches twenty-five means of restoration.Fire ritual, recitation of mantra, meditation, ritual feast, etc.Are the means to purify downfalls, transgressions, violations andruptures.Any downfall, regardless of its seriousness, can be purified ifacknowledged before three hours have elapsed.Meditation and recitation of the mantra of Vajrasattva andSamayavajra,Initiation, and self-initiation are the best means for purification.Higher pledges are restored through self-blessing and the view.In the tradition of the ancient translations, the pledges common tothe spiritual ways of skill in meansAre the general pledges, the particular, and the exceptional ones.The general pledges are the limits to be observed in the personalliberation precepts, awakening mind commitments, and thepledges of the three outer tantras.The particular pledges are the root pledges of body, speech, mind,and awakening mind, andThe secondary pledges of the five to practice, five not to renounce,Five to accept, five to recognize, and five to integrate.Practitioners should safeguard and engage in the provisional ordefinitive meanings of these pledgesIn accordance with circumstances.

A brief summary of their treatment ofthe four qualities follows:(1) For a qualified teacher to be very learned (mang du thos pa) means thathaving heard the doctrine from the buddhas, bodhisattvas, or spiritual guides,he or she becomes the receptacle who holds the vast range (rgya che ba) of theentire Buddhist teachings and is therefore a great teacher able to illuminate ev-ery aspect of the doctrine.(2) Having gained not an inferior or mediocre but a higher wisdom, the quali-fied teacher has cut through uncertainty as to the general and specific characteris-tics of phenomena and is therefore able to dispel others’ doubts (the tshom spong ba).(3) The qualified teacher performs the deeds of a saintly person, follows anethical code, avoids unvirtuous actions, and is therefore worthy of respect andhis or her words worthy to be heard (gzung bar ’os pa). A teacher is an authenticspiritual guide if he or she is able to uplift to the path of virtue persons whoengage in evil deeds such as killing, by explaining to them the doctrine.(4) The qualified teacher points out the two natures (de nyid gnyis), that of thethoroughly polluted (kun nas nyon mongs pa) and of the fully pure (rnam par byangba).

In his own commentary on the stanza cited in the root text above, Shakhya-prabha states that a preceptor who has disrupted his ethical conduct (i.e., hasincurred an infraction of one of the four root vows of a monk, etc.) is spirituallylifeless and will be detrimental to his students. A preceptor who adheres to therules but does not know the procedures related to the monastic discipline is notqualified to instruct his fellow monks when they become afflicted by emotions.A preceptor who does not care for the sick, who lacks true benevolence towardthe students, or a preceptor who does not live with monks who are observingthe rules will not live peacefully; like a sandalwood tree entwined by a snake, hewill be prey to great anxieties. A preceptor who has pure ethics, knows the mo-nastic practices, is compassionate, and lives among pure monks is like a lotus ina vast lake. By living next to him, his students will increase their virtuous quali-ties.

The essence referred to in “seizing the essence” or “holding the es-sence” is the great bliss which is the inseparability of emptiness and compassion.Mandala are of three kinds: the mandala of the awakening mind (in its two-fold aspect of relative awakening mind or the seminal essence which is the basisfor the secret initiation, and ultimate awakening mind, the basis for the fourthinitiation), of the bhaga (or “lotus” of the consort, the basis for the pristine aware-ness through wisdom initiation), and of the body (this last is not an actualmandala).The progenitor of all mandala is the inseparability of emptiness and pristineawareness, free of all mental fabrications. This mandala embodies all forms ofdeities who are of the nature of bodhichitta, indivisible emptiness and compas-sion. Externally, this is represented by a mandala of powdered colors or apainted textile, also called a mandala. (Cluster of Secret Instructions [Sa ̇pu ̨a-tantrar›ja ̨ık›mn›yamañjarı; Man ngag snye ma/ dPal yang dag par sbyor ba’i rgyudkyi rgyal po’i rgya cher ’grel pa man ngag gi snye ma] [Toh. 1198], ff. 82b4-83b6.)The physical body is called a mandala as it is the place where bodhichitta(indivisibility of emptiness and compassion) is seized. In the body, bodhichittais in the form of the letter HAM at the crown of the head, the basis of great bliss,the essence. That essence, which is indivisibility of emptiness and compassion,is the unsurpassable mandala (f. 212a5-7).See Kongtrul’s detailed discussion and classifications of mandala in IOK, vol.II, pp. 660-666; and Pema Karpo’s Three Vows (TV), vol. Ca, ff. 102b6-7a3.38. According to the CFVD, f. 20b2-5, the drawing of the mandala (dkyil ’khor’bri ba) involves several activities: purifying the outer and inner ground andtaking possession of it; striking interferences with the three-blade dagger inorder to eliminate them; sealing the cardinal and intermediate directions; pre-paring the deities; applying lines of measure and colored sands; completingthe ritual of the vase and actualizing the mandala. Proper performance of fa-miliarization (bsnyen pa) means to have practiced the deity yoga and relatedrites.39. Initiation (abhi ̋eka, dbang bskur ba). According to Kongtrul, abhi ̋eka isderived from seka meaning to scatter or sprinkle (gtor ba). Just as an environmentis cleansed by sprinkling water, the pure nature of the mind will emerge when themind’s impediments or impurities (sgrib pa) are “cleansed by sprinkling,” i.e., elimi-nated. Another term for initiation, abhi ̋ikta, is derived from ̋ikta meaning to pour.The initiation is like pouring the potential for pristine awareness into the cleanvessel of a pure mind. Fusing these two etymologies, initiation comes to have themeaning of “purification through pouring and sprinkling,” i.e., by pouring andsprinkling pristine awareness onto a candidate purified through the common(bodhisattva’s) commitment, a pure seed is planted in the fundamental conscious-ness (kun gzhi), etc., and the candidate is thereby made fit. According to another etymology, abhi ̋eka means to authorize. Just as a kingis authorized to assume his throne through a ceremony of investiture, the candi-date through the four initiations—vase, secret, pristine awareness through wis-dom, and word initiation—is authorized to practice, respectively, the phase ofgeneration (bskyed pa’i rim pa); the ca ̊ ̃›lı (gtum mo) or inner heat; the circle of"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter I 341the ma ̊ ̃ala (dkyil ’khor gi ’khor lo), i.e., the action seal (karmamudr›, las rgya) and,as an auxiliary, the imaginary seal or pristine awareness seal (jñ›namudr›, yergya); and the great seal (mah›mudr›, phyag rgya chen po). He or she is furtherauthorized to hear and teach the tantras and engage in activities to accomplishthe common and uncommon attainments.Initiations from a temporal perspective are three: the initiation of the causalpreparation (smin byed rgyu’i dbang) of the candidate; the initiation of the experi-ential path (nyams su len pa lam gyi dbang), including the self-initiation and prin-cipally the experiential cultivation of the subject matter of the initiation until thefinal result is reached; and the initiation of the result (’bras bu’i dbang), i.e., thesupreme initiation called the great light (’od zer chen po’i dbang) which must pre-cede the attainment of enlightenment (IOK, vol.

The two phases that comprise the path of the Highest Yoga Tantra(uttaratantra, bla med rgyud).The phase of creation (utpattikrama, bskyed rim): krama means phase; utpattidenotes artifice (bcos ma). In this phase, meditation is based on artifice or cre-ation by thoughts (rtog pa). For this reason, it is referred to as a phase of imagina-tion (brtags pa’i rim pa) or yoga of artifice (bcos ma’i rnal ’byor). Its special featureis the imagined creation of the mandala, in which the adept assumes the form ofthe main deity, modelled on the outer creation of the universe and inner experi-ences of death, the intermediate state, and rebirth. The purpose of this phase isto purify ordinary appearances and clinging to ordinary appearances. The es-sence of this phase is emptiness, appearance, and bliss represented by the formof oneself as the deity.The completion phase (ni ̋pannakrama, rdzogs rim): ni ̋panna denotes ultimate(yongs su grub pa) and natural (rnal ma). In this phase, the adept cultivates whatis already fully present and for which nothing is created anew. He or she shiftsthe focus of practice to the subtle level of body and mind to effect the actualexperience of innate wisdom. Thus, this phase is defined as extraordinary pris-tine awareness that has arisen from the entering, abiding, and dissolving of mindand energy-winds into the central channel, as well as the causes and result ofthis awareness (Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, pp. 159-160). For a modern explanationof the creation phase, see H. Guenther ’s The Creative Vision (Novato, CA: LotsawaPublications, 1987).53.

The state of union (yuganaddha, zung ’jug): From a general tantric perspec-tive, the state of union refers to the indivisible merging of innate great bliss (themeans) and clear light (emptiness). In particular, it is the indivisible mergingof the relative and ultimate truths: the relative truth of the stage called “self-blessing” in which the adept’s body appears as the illusory body of the deityand the ultimate truth which is the mind entering the state of reality through theexperience of clear light.In the context of the Kalachakra Tantra, at the level of experiential cultivation,the state of union results from the branch of contemplation (ting nge ’dzin gyi yanlag, one of the six yogas of the Kalachakra tantra phase of completion). The unionconsists in the blending of the known and the knower. The known is the per-ceived mind, the supreme emptiness endowed with all aspects. The knower isthe perceiving mind, the pristine awareness of immutable great bliss. This unionis also referred to as the inseparable union of emptiness and compassion; theunion of clear light and illusory body in this system refers exclusively to this.This union is also the nature of the ground of being and the nature of thepristine awareness resultant at enlightenment.In this discussion, great compassion, clear light, and changeless bliss havethe same meaning. They constitute the means aspect and are generally regardedas relative truth. Emptiness, illusory body, and the dimension of emptiness pos-sessing all aspects have the same meaning. They constitute the wisdom aspectand are generally regarded as ultimate truth (Kongtrul’s IOK vol. III, Book VIII,chapter IV, pp. 219-220).Mah›mudr› (phyag rgya chen po) or great seal: In the tantras, “great seal” gen-erally denotes the final result of the tantrika’s endeavor. In consideration of itsever-present nature throughout the ground, path, and result, mahamudra is alsoexplained in terms of the path that leads to such a result, as well as the ground ofbeing or natural condition of the individual and everything that exists. In thiscontext, it is equivalent in meaning to the state of union just explained.For a discussion of mahamudra as a system of meditation that combines thesutra and tantra perspectives, see Pema Karpo’s explanation of four phases ofmahamudra meditation as presented in Meditation Differently, trans.

Commenting on these lines, Pundarika states: “The mas-ter may be proud for various reasons such as his erudition, wealth, or power; hisproficiency in the ten fields of expertise; his attainments on the spiritual path orhis appearance. He may feel proud when meeting lowly people, or be overlyself-effacing when in contact with superior people. A student who has gained agood knowledge of the path should shun a proud teacher who lacks compassion.“‘Defiant of pledges’ means that the teacher makes a public display of certainsecret pledges that worldly persons would view as distasteful. ‘Guilty of misap-propriation’ refers to a teacher who uses for himself the properties of monasticcommunities or spiritual masters or the articles intended for worship. ‘Ignorantof the doctrine’ refers to a teacher who has not received instructions on the truedoctrine. Likewise, a master who ‘willfully deceives authentic disciples,’ i.e.,lies to them, should be shunned. An ‘uninitiated’ master who has ‘failed to enterthe state of supreme bliss’ is one who teaches a tantra without having receivedthe initiation. ‘Slave to wealth and enjoyment’ means one who is always cravingmundane possessions. ‘Careless’ is one who does not set himself in meditationbut is distracted by drinking alcohol, etc. ‘Obsessed with sexual desire’ is onewho is desirous of the pleasure of sexual union. To forsake such teachers is therule of the Transcendent One” (Stainless Light, Toh. 1347, vol. Da, f. 90a7-b5).63.

Reading fourteen (bcu bzhi) in place of twelve (bcu gnyis). Fourteen elements(mukha, sgo) used in teaching:(1) Grouping the themes (vy›khy›sa ̇grahamukha, rnam par bshad pa bsdusba’i sgo): stating the reason a particular discourse was delivered bythe Buddha (mdo sde ’byung ba’i dgos pa), the meaning of its words(tshig gi don), the connections or context (mtshams sbyar), intentionof the scripture (dgongs pa), the incongruencies (brgal), and the re-sponse to the incongruencies (lan brjod pa).(2) Focusing on the themes (vastusa ̇grahamukha, dngos po bsdus pa’i sgo)encapsulated in the sayings (g›th›) of the Buddha. For example,one cites, “Do not commit evil, practice virtue, and discipline themind: this is the Buddha’s doctrine,” and then comments on theselines in terms of the three trainings.(3) Presenting both major headings and minor details (aºgop›ºgamukha,yan lag dang nye ba’i yan lag gi sgo): mentioning first the generalterms and then explaining the details. For example, when discuss-ing the leisures and endowments of the precious human life, onebegins by stating, “Five conditions depend on oneself, and fiveconditions depend on others,” and then successively explains eachof the two sets of conditions with five sentences each (see note 1).(4) Following a sequence from the lower to the higher (uttarottara-nirh›ramukha, gong nas gong du mngon par bsgrub pa’i sgo): provid-ing orderly explanations from the simpler to the complex or lowerto higher; as in the case of the aggregates, explaining first the body,then feeling, etc., or as another example, stating, “Through enthu-siastic effort, close application of mindfulness develops; throughmindfulness, the mind enters the state of equipoise; and therebythe ultimate is realized just as it is.”(5) Using the method of exclusion (pratik ̋epamukha, spong ba’i sgo): exclu-sion of the opposite of the topic in question. The doctrine itself, asmethod, is to be discarded once the shore of perfect peace has beenreached; even more so, what does not conform to the doctrineshould be rejected.(6) Transforming the meaning of words (ak ̋arapari ̊›mamukha, yi ge yongssu bsgyur ba’i sgo): changing the usual connotation of words by us-ing them as technical terms of the doctrine."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"354 Buddhist Ethics(7) Describing the corrupted and the uncorrupted and the conditions thatlead to each (n›Ÿ›n›Ÿamukha, chud za ba dang chud mi za ba’i sgo): forexample, the scriptures say that “corrupted” refers to attachmentto outer things (house, spouse, etc.) and inner things (the five ag-gregates). Uncorrupted means freedom from excessive attachmentto these. To remain unrenunciate serves as a cause for the corrup-tion of attachment. To become a renunciate and to work to end one’simpediments, etc., leads to the uncorrupted state of detachment.(8) Defining types of persons (pudgalavyavasth›namukha, gang zag rnampar gzhag pa’i sgo) for whom a certain discourse is intentionallytaught. Individuals are of two types, ordinary and exalted (the lat-ter have perceived the truth; the former have not). To the first typebelong individuals who are negative, slightly positive, and exceed-ingly positive. Among exalted individuals belong persons whoabide in one of the four results (of stream-enterer, once-returner,non-returner, and saint), the first three of whom are trainees, andthe last one having reached the path of no more learning.(9) Defining the divisions (prabhedavyavasth›namukha, rab tu dbye ba rnampar gzhag pa’i sgo): through analyses based on quadruple formulas,such as existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence,and neither existence nor non-existence.(10) Using methods (nayamukha, tshul gyi sgo): this consists of six methods:pointing out the very nature of phenomena, experience, discourses’explanations, excluding the two extremes of existence and non-existence, the inconceivable perfection of a Buddha, and consider-ation of the six elements (i.e., the subject matter to be known, itsimport, the approach to knowledge, etc.).(11) Teaching finalized knowledge (parijñ›dimukha, yongs su shes pa la sogspa’i sgo): pointing out the manner of engaging in each of the fourexalted truths. The truth of suffering is to be understood; the truthof the source of suffering is to be abandoned; the truth of cessationis to be attained; and the truth of the path is to be practiced.(12) Pointing out the force and weakness of terms (bal›balamukha, stobs dangstobs ma yin pa’i sgo): for example, in teaching the twelve links ofinterdependent arising, evaluating each link, noting that if one isomitted, the sense is no longer comprehensible.(13) Reiterating (praty›h›ramukha, bzlas te brjod pa’i sgo): using repetition ofand elaboration on one particular word or sentence.(14) Verifying (abhinirh›ramukha, mngon par bsgrub pa’i sgo): through analy-ses, using the quadruple (mu bzhi) formula with respect to eachterm used in the discourse.(Asanga’s Synthesis of Phenomenology [Toh. 4049], ff. 117b6-118a1; and Jinaputra’sExplanation of the Synthesis of Phenomenology [Toh. 4053], ff. 105a6-109a3.)"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter I 355See Walpola Rahula’s translation of Synthesis of Phenomenology (pp. 179-180) andObermiller’s translation of The Jewelry of Scripture of Bu-ston (p. 70).117.

Shudapanthaka (⁄Ò ̃apanthaka, Lam phran bstan):one of the sixteen saints (arhats), the direct disciples of the Buddha. Born intothe brahmin caste, he was a man of very dull intellect. Although he had beentaught the vedas, he could not understand them. Later in his life, Mahapanthaka(Lam chen bstan) (another of the sixteen saints), ordained him as a Buddhistmonk and tried, to no avail, to teach him four verses of the doctrine. Finally, indespair, he led him out of the monks’ quarters and left him on a small road (lamphran). One day Shudapanthaka met the Buddha, who instructed him to cleanthe monks’ temple, and while doing so, to repeat the words “sweeping away thedust; sweeping away stains” (rdul spang dri ma spang). Through the Buddha’smiraculous powers, as he swept, the dirt immediately returned just as before.After some time had passed in unsuccessful efforts to clean the temple,Shudapanthaka suddenly understood the meaning of the words that the Bud-dha taught him. Holding the broom, he declared to his fellow monks that sweep-ing away dust meant cleaning not the dust of the earth, but the impurities causedby one’s emotions—desire, hatred, and ignorance. He came to understand thenature of things as they are, eliminated his obscurations, and became a saint.Later, the Buddha sent Shudapanthaka to give a lecture in a nunnery. Thenuns were offended, thinking that the Buddha had sent them a stupid monk.Enraged, they erected a high teaching throne for him that lacked a staircase bywhich to mount it. Shudapanthaka mounted the throne miraculously and deliv-ered a talk of unprecedented significance. He was then declared by the Buddhato be the best of his saintly disciples. Legend says that he dwells invisibly atVulture’s Peak (Bihar) surrounded by sixteen hundred saints.120.

The other three are purificationby confession, expressed in the form of a supplication, etc.; purification by bind-ing, which seals one’s body, speech, and mind to those of the deity; and purifica-tion by water.According to Buddhaguhya, purification or cleansing is of four types: bythe three vows, by confession and supplication, by “the releasing of the sym-bolic gesture” (phyag rgya dgrol ba), and by water. To perform the releasing ofthe symbolic gesture (mudr›, phyag rgya), one first imagines the five fingers ofthe right hand as the five buddhas and the five fingers of the left as the fiveconsorts, unites the hands with the middle fingers extended and touching eachother at their tips, and then releases the gesture by separating the hands. Thisgesture of release symbolizes the purification of unwholesome actions. (Guideto the Purport of the Tantra [Tantr›rth›vat›ra; rGyud kyi don la ’jug pa] [Toh. 2501],ff. 36b3-37a2.)4. Tsonapa distinguishes three forms of ethics according to their motives: ethicsbased on anxiety (’jigs skyob gyi tshul khrims) for which the preservation of mo-rality is motivated by fear of lacking means of livelihood, having a bad reputa-tion, not being praised, etc., or fear of punishment or being born into lower formsof life; ethics based on the wish to excel (legs su smon pa’i tshul khrims) for whichthe safeguarding of morality is based on attachment to wealth and honor; andethics based on an intention to emerge from cyclic existence (nges ’byung gi tshulkhrims) for which the safeguarding of morality is to attain liberation from cyclicexistence based on a correct view of the law of causality.

They could also be called “Atomists,” since one of their major beliefsis in the existence of partless and indivisible atoms, as well as partless and indi-visible moments of consciousness. For the Analysts, these phenomena, beingpartless and indivisible (therefore subject to neither material destruction nordivision through analysis), are held to be ultimate truths, as opposed to any-thing that is an aggregation of particles or moments, which they consider to beconventional truths. Both truths, conventional and ultimate, are real for the Ana-lysts, who therefore, in terms of Buddhist philosophy, stand as “Realists”"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"360 Buddhist Ethics(bh›vav›din, dngos por smra ba). Theirs is a philosophy expounded mainly byadherents of the Individual Way and no doubt characterized the tenets of theoriginal schools of Buddhism in India.Traditionalists are so called because their assertions are based mainly on thescriptures that record the word of the Buddha. Though Traditionalists are Real-ists, the Traditionalist followers of reason differentiate themselves from Ana-lysts by negating the substantial status of conceptually imputed phenomenaand by propounding a finer concept of conventional and ultimate truth. Forthem, a phenomenon able to produce an effect (arthakriya, don byed nus pa) isultimate truth, and one not able to do so is a conventional truth. Traditionalistswere followers of the Individual Way, but their tenets may have been the sparkthat originated the finer thought of the Universal Way.Idealists, whose system was pioneered by Asanga, are so called because theyassert that all phenomena are of the nature of the mind that perceives them. Forthis reason, they are also called “Proponents of the Aspect of Consciousness”(vijñ›nav›din, rnam rig smra ba). The lack of substantial duality between observerand observed is for them the subtle selflessness of phenomena, the ultimate truth.This view provided the support for the experientialist approach to meditation;for this reason, they are also called “Experientialists” (yog›c›rin, rnal ’byor spyodpa). This approach, however, led them to overemphasize perception or mindand to attribute to the mind a true or ultimate status. A branch of the Idealists,which follows the scriptures, also subscribes to the belief in a fundamental con-sciousness (›layavijñ›na, kun gzhi rnam shes) as the storehouse of cumulative im-prints of actions and as the person itself. Idealists are followers of the UniversalWay, and their tenets, along with those of the Centrists, are said to have formedthe conceptual frame of reference for the tantric systems.Centrists, whose system was pioneered by Nagarjuna, are so called becausethey follow the “center” (madhya, dbu) or “middle way” which does not fall intothe two extremes of negating conventional reality and asserting the true exist-ence of phenomena. They advocate the complementarity of the two truths, theconventional as the dependent arising of phenomena and the ultimate as theemptiness of true status of everything that exists. Centrists are subdivided into“Dogmaticists” (sv›tantrika, rang rgyud pa) and “Consequentialists” (prasaºgika,thal ’gyur pa), the former advocated by Bhavaviveka and the latter by Chandra-kirti, Shantideva, etc. Their main difference lies in their analyses of whether ornot a phenomenon has an “essence.” The former asserts that it does, but doesnot say what it is exactly. The latter asserts that when a phenomenon is ana-lyzed, nothing is found that can be said to constitute the phenomena itself.Consequentialists assert that everything is just a name, a mere imputation of themind, and nothing ever has any true existence, even conventionally. The tenetsof Centrists represent the prominent part of the Universal Way philosophy, aswell as the view based on which tantric practice is performed. (From the verbalteachings of Geshé Rabten.

This distinction, found only within the Tibetan traditions, is one thatKongtrul expressly adheres to in his writings. The former view asserts that allthings are empty of their own essence (rang stong); such emptiness, a mere nega-tion (med dgag), is the ultimate truth. The latter asserts that the ultimate nature isnaturally perfect, devoid of any stain, and therefore not empty of its own na-ture. Phenomena are considered deceptions that manifest adventitiously as thefabrication of duality. They do not exist in reality; therefore, the relative is emptyof its nature. Phenomena are extraneous to ultimate reality, and therefore theultimate is empty of extraneous natures (gzhan stong). The masters of the Jonangpaschool were the main apologists of the second view. See Dharmashri’s Commen-tary on the Three Vows (sDom ’grel/ sDom pa gsum rnam par nges pa’i ’grel pa legsbshad ngo mtshar dpag bsam gyi snye ma) (Chorten Monastery edition, Deorali,Gangtok, Sikkim, published by Dodrup Chen Rinpoché) f. 185a5.14. Perceptible form (rnam par rig byed kyi gzugs) refers to form that arises as theobject of sense perception. Imperceptible form (rnam par rig byed ma yin pa’i gzugs)refers to form for the mental consciousness only, not perceived by others.15. Acquisition (pr›pti, thob pa): The Sarvastivadin view on the element ensur-ing the link between an action and its results. On this point, Analysts assert thatthe person who assumes vows is like an elephant, and the vows, the elephant’sload. The load is tied to the elephant by the rope of the anomalous factor(viprayuktasa ̇sk›ra, ldan min ’du byed) of “acquisition.” When a cause for losingthe vows is present, the rope of acquisition is cut, and the load of the vows falls tothe ground; in other words, the person becomes vowless (Tsonapa’s SIRD, f. 138b2).16. See section below entitled “Vows for Life,” which explains the ten essentialelements for the monk’s ordination (such as the ordaining preceptor and so forth).17.

Drigungpa (’Bri gung pa), a reference to Drigung Kyopa (’Bri gung skyobpa) (1143-1219), the foremost disciple of Pakmodrupa and founder of the DrigungKagyu school.21. Taktsang (sTag tshang lo tsa ba Shes rab rin chen), a scholar and translator ofthe Sakya school, born the year Tsongkapa composed his Tantric Stages (sNgagsrim chen mo) (1405). He became a vehement critic of Tsongkapa.22. Pema Karpo says that mok ̋a refers to liberation, which is the transcendenceof suffering, and pr›ti (individual) to the causes that lead to the transcendence ofsuffering, such as the vows of a monk, etc. (TV, vol. Nga, f. 4b2).Tsonapa discusses three etymological intepretations for pr›timok ̋a: (1) as “vowsof individual liberation,” where pr›ti is individual and mok ̋a, liberation. Theyare called vows of individual liberation because they lead to liberation only theindividual person who safeguards such ethics, not anyone else who is not fol-lowing that system of ethics; (2) as “vows of initial liberation,” where pr›ti isinitial and mok ̋a, liberation. They are called vows of initial liberation because inthe first moment these vows are assumed, one is liberated from being a vowlessperson; (3) as “vows as means to attain liberation,” where pr›ti is means in thesense of being a “condition” for liberation (mok ̋a). Pr›timok ̋a [translated here as“personal liberation” according to the usual Tibetan rendering of the term] hasundergone two distinct but not unrelated phases of evolution of meaning. Origi-nally, the term simply indicated a confession of faith almost equivalent to dharmaor doctrine. The principles indicated in the advice “Do not do any evil deeds,practice all kinds of virtue, and control your mind: this is the Buddha’s doc-trine” formed the original pr›timok ̋a or “bond” for the emergent monastic com-munity, which initially was just another sect of religious wanderers. Later, withthe need for and the gradual emergence of a monastic code of discipline, theterm referred to a basic list of rules (described in the Personal Liberation Dis-course). The list was recited at the bimonthly assembly that began as an occasionto preach the doctrine and only later became more of a confession ceremony.This likely occurred after the Buddha’s demise around the time of the first Bud-dhist council. These two concepts of pr›timok ̋a at different phases of its evolu-tion are closely linked since both represent principally a bond for the commu-nity. In the beginning, the bond reflected the essence of the doctrine; in thesecond phase, the bond was expressed more in rules, and the scope of theconcept expanded to include a ritualized confession. We can therefore con-clude that this term originally meant “bond that leads to freedom” (SIRD, vol.sTod cha, f. 12a3-6).23. Exalted ones (›rya, ’phags pa): those who have perceived the truth and arethus exalted compared to other worldly beings. This includes individuals onlevels of realization from the path of seeing to final enlightenment.24.

For a discussion of this subject, see Lati Rinpochay’s Meditative States inTibetan Buddhism (London: Wisdom Publications, 1983).26. Pema Karpo provides an etymological definition for the Tibetan term gelong(dge slong) (monk), which translates the Sanskrit bhik ̋u, as a virtuous personwho “begs” (slong) for alms and seeks the “virtue” (dge) of perfect peace (TV,vol. Nga, f. 28a3-5).27. Tsonapa defines the Sanskrit term Ÿr›ma ̊era as “the person whose eyes shedtears.” Just as the person who sheds tears can see things close by but not in thedistance, the novice is allowed to hear the discipline intended for him (close by)but not the discipline and ceremonies of the monks (distant). In the commonlanguage, the novice is known as cilu (servant) because he cannot handle theresponsibilities of being a teacher (SIRD, f. 39b1-3).28. The Tibetan term dge bsnyen which translates the Sanskrit up›saka is etymo-logically explained as “being close to” (up›, bsnyen) “virtue” (saka, dge ba).29. Gendun Drubpa, the First Dalai Lama, states that the purificatory fast vowsare not differentiated in terms of male and female holders of these vows becausethey last just one day (Commentary on Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Phenomenology, p.215).

A female novice must receive the postulant nun’s vows and observe themfor two years before she can receive full ordination as a nun.Atisha states that eight types of personal liberation vows are spoken of in thescriptures on discipline taught by the Buddha himself, as well as in those com-posed by saints, such as Entering Pristine Awareness (Ye shes la ’jug pa) and theGreat Detailed Exposition (Bye brag tu bshad mdzod chen mo). However, the nobleAsanga, in the chapter on ethics in his Stages of Yogic Practice (YogacaryabhÒmi,rNal ’byor spyod pa’i sa), states that there are only seven types, and this cannot bedoubted. The practitioner of the purificatory fast is excluded from the eight sincea one-day observance of vows is not a true ascetic practice and does not involverestraint from desires for any great length of time. (Commentary on the Lamp forthe Path [Bodhim›rgapradıpapañjik›; Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma’i dka’ ’grel] [Toh.3948], ff. 259b3-260a3.)32.

Shariputra excelled in wisdom, and Maudgalyayana, in miraculouspowers. Both were teachers in their own right who used to tutor students sent tothem by the Buddha.According to Tsonapa, the Buddha conferred the status of monk by calling“Come hither, monks!” to those aspirants who were capable of attaining thepath of seeing in the same life, had already attained it, or were in their last exist-ence before becoming saints (SIRD, f. 29b6-7).35.

Pema Karpo explains that Buddha entrusted his monks with the responsi-bility of performing ordination according to the original procedure (sngon gyicho ga) after a certain person who wished to enter the Buddhist order died whilebeing led by a monk to the place where the Buddha was residing. The originalceremony did not require a preceptor or a tutor who would later instruct thenew monk. This meant, however, that new monks might remain untrained andact contrary to the principles of the doctrine. As a result, this form of ordinationbecame an object of derision by non-Buddhists. Furthermore, a certain monkwho was sick and was without attendants to help him as he approached deathrequested help from the Buddha. Thus, at that time (six years after his attain-ment of enlightenment) in order that his disciples could gather followers and inorder that sick monks could have [novices] as attendants to help them, the Bud-dha gave permission to the monastic community to perform the present-dayordination (da lta’i cho ga) with an abbot and a teacher among the officiatingassembly (TV, vol. Nga, f. 6a3-b3).The original ceremony was simple in that all it required was a group of monks,in front of whom the candidate would offer prostrations while respecting theorder of seniority, then kneel and make a threefold request to be admitted intothe order. Upon acceptance by the assembly (thus completing the four-part for-mal procedure including proposal), the aspirant would instantaneously becomea monk (f. 6b2-3). The present-day ceremony is performed methodically by agroup of monks, some of whom act as preceptor and teachers, unlike the origi-nal in which there was no such differentiation of position.Tsonapa notes that sporadic use of the former ordination occurred even afterthe present method was introduced. For instance, on the point of passing intoperfect peace, the Buddha ordained Subhadra (Rab bzang) as a monk by calling,“Come hither, monk!” (SIRD, f. 30a2-3).43. Gunaprabha states that the central region or country, i.e., the Gangetic basin,is the territory bordered by the following: “To the east, the thicket of sugar caneof Sharkara (Li kha ra) outside the city of Pundravardhana (in the ancient dis-tricts of Malda and Dinajpur); to the south, the Ganges (Chu glung) at the southof Sharavati (’Dam bu can); to the west, the region known as Stuna (Ka ba) nearthe town of the same name; and to the north, the Ushira hill range.” (Fundamen-tal Summary of Discipline [VinayasÒtra; ’Dul ba’i mdo] [henceforth cited as SD][Toh. 4117], f. 74a6.)44. Buddha’s teachings as transmission (lung gi chos) refers to the twelve classesof the Buddhist scriptures. Buddha’s teachings as spiritual accomplishment (rtogspa’i chos) refers to all that is encompassed by the truth of the path and of cessation.45. The first three of the four continents in ancient Indian cosmology: MajesticBody (PÒrvavideha, Lus ’phags po), Land of Jambu (Jambudvıpa, ’Dzam bu gling),Bountiful Cow (Aparagod›nıya, Ba glang spyod), and Unpleasant Sound(Uttarakuru, sGra mi snyan).

The four animals are the partridge, rabbit, monkey, and elephant. It is saidthat in a previous life the Buddha incarnated as a partridge, and together with arabbit, monkey, and elephant, took the vows of the purificatory fast that resultedin prosperity and harmony in the area where they lived. Thus, the four animalscame to be known as the four harmonious brothers (mthun pa spun bzhi) andtogether form a symbol of harmony. They are often depicted standing one ontop of the other to signify respect for elders.48. Tsonapa divides this first obstacle to assuming the vows (sdom pa skye ba labar du gcod pa) into four categories: (1) eighteen aspirants are unfit to assume thevows because of their bodies (lus kyi rten ma yin pa): emanations (from otherworlds), ten types of neuter persons, persons who have changed gender threetimes, who have poisonous sex organs (in that whoever has intercourse withthem dies instantly), who have no sex organ, eununchs, animals, non-humans,and inhabitants of the continent of Unpleasant Sound; (2) ten aspirants cannotassume the vows due to impediments caused by deeds (las sgrib kyi dbang gis)performed in this life: thieves, religious extremists, persons guilty of any of thefive crimes of immediate retribution, persons who have violated a nun, whohave concealed a root downfall, or who have been monks before; (3) four aspir-ants are unfit because of the time and situation (gnas skabs kyi dbang gis): aspir-ants below the permitted age, who still wear lay attire, who do not wearrenunciate attire, or who are unwilling to forsake the causes leading to disci-plinary measures; (4) five aspirants are unfit because of their disposition (bsampa’i dbang gis): individuals who hold extremist religious views, who lack thenatural wish to become a renunciate, or who have no freedom because they areoverpowered by strong attachment, anger, or ignorance (SIRD, f. 83a2-b1).49. Gunaprabha mentions that permission should be asked of parents if theylive within seven days of travel from the place where the monastic ordinationwill be conferred. If the parents live further away, permission should be askedof the monastic community (SD, f. 4a4).50. Being affected by a contagious disease such as leprosy or a serious bronchialdisorder, or being subject to amnesia, etc., would burden the monastic commu-nity and impede the aspirant in making full use of the teaching for his spiritualdevelopment. These conditions do not, however, exclude him from theunordained practice of the Buddhist teaching. For a list of diseases that make aperson ineligible for ordination, see Gunaprabha’s HFP, f. 107b.51. Refusal of admission into the order to persons with mutilation or deforma-tion was means for the community to ensure the laity’s respect for the Buddha’sdoctrine and to defend itself from the intrusion of persons who were seekingonly food and shelter.Certain physical traits mentioned in the scriptures that made one ineligiblefor monastic life were linked to social and temporal circumstances; blond hair,"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 367for example, was extremely rare at the time of the Buddha. Today, blondnesswould not disqualify an aspirant. For a long list of the physical traits that makea person ineligible for ordination, see Gunaprabha’s SD, ff. 4b7-5a5.On this point, Karma Ngedön Nyingpo states that the last two conditions (tobe free of obstacles to meaningfulness and of appearance) are imposed princi-pally to cultivate the laity’s respect for the doctrine, but are not major obstaclesin becoming a renunciate.

These precepts are normally taken before sunrise and before any food hasbeen taken.58. The aspirant is asked whether he is a non-Buddhist, younger than fifteen,unable to scare away a crow although he is fifteen (or able to scare away acrow although not yet seven years old), a slave, in debt, has his parents’ per-mission, (if not,) has parents living far away, is sick, has violated a nun, is aeunuch or hermaphrodite, a ghost, an animal, adheres to non-Buddhist views,has committed crimes with immediate retribution, is mutilated, belongs to anunworthy family, has changed sex three times, is a female who resembles aman, or is from some other continent (world), and so forth (Gunaprabha’s HFP,ff. 101a6-b5).59. Gunaprabha states that after the inquiry, the aspirant first prostrates beforea representation of the Buddha and then to the preceptor. He then kneels infront of the preceptor with folded hands and recites three times the verses oftaking refuge, as well as promising to maintain the five lay precepts for life.With the acknowledgment of the preceptor and of the aspirant, he receives theprecepts (HFP, ff. 101b4-102b1).60. Interim renunciate (bar ma rab byung): the preparatory part of the novice or-dination consisting of an address with request, an entreaty, and three transfor-mations, performed when the aspirant is in the interim stage of having assumedthe lay practitioner’s vows, but is not yet a novice.61. These questions (the same as those mentioned in note 58) are asked onlyonce to a person who is assuming both the lay precepts and the novice vows inthe course of one ceremony. However, in the course of the ceremony for becoming"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"368 Buddhist Ethicsa full-fledged monk, a new set of questions [appropriate for that ordination] isasked, once by a monk appointed to be the interviewer (gsang ston), once by theceremonial master (las kyi slob dpon), and once by the ordaining preceptor (mkhanpo). The interviewer does not participate in the novice ordination since this roleis fulfilled by the preceptor (Gunaprabha, HFP, f. 106b3).62. The aspirant kneels in front of the preceptor, and with folded hands, askshim three times to become his preceptor and tutor and to grant him admissioninto the order. At the end of this formal request, the preceptor verbally expresseshis assent. Following this, a tuft of the aspirant’s hair (that had been left un-shaven) is cut, the aspirant is made to wash, and the preceptor gives him thealms bowl and the yellow robes. Then, by taking refuge in front of the preceptorand expressing his will to become a novice, the aspirant promises to abandonthe lay attributes and adopt those of a renunciate. After a further request, he isgranted the vows of novice and expresses his determination to safeguard them(Gunaprabha, HFP, ff. 102b7-104a7).63. This refers to determining the time of the ordination (the year, season, month,first or second part of the month, date, part of the day or night, and hour) bymeasuring the shadow cast by the sun upon a small, square, pyramid-like woodendevice. For details, see Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows (ChortenMonastery: Gangtok, Sikkim), ff. 37b1-38a6.64. This refers to having broken one’s vows and kept secret the violation.65. In discussing this point, Tsonapa defines the attitude of renunciation (nges’byung gi bsams pa) as the intent focused upon the state of perfect peace in whichall cyclic states are transcended; the underlying motive (rgyu’i kun slong) as theattitude prior to assuming the vows; and the motive of the moment (dus kyi kunslong) as the attitude simultaneous with assuming the vows (SIRD, f. 15a1-b).66. The five stipulations mentioned above.67. Tsonapa states that the excellent conditions are the intentions to relinquishthe attire of a layman (khyim pa’i rtags spang ba nyams pa), to adopt the attire of arenunciate (rab tu byung ba’i rtags blang ba nyams pa), and to put forward therequest to became a renunciate to the teacher (bla mar gsol ba gdab pa nyams pa)(SIRD, f. 45b7).68. Tsonapa’s SIRD explains the etymology of the term “ordination of a monk”(upasa ̇panna, bsnyen par rdzogs pa) as follows: rdzogs pa denotes a state utterlyfree of potential for harm, that has the nature of perfect peace; bsnyen means “tobe close to,” that is, to come close, with one’s whole mind, to the state of perfectpeace.69. In this context, lapse of discipline refers mainly to defeating and partiallydefeating offenses.70. The questions are asked by the interviewer in private (away from the assem-bly of ordaining monks). The questioning of a novice who wishes to become afull-fledged monk includes all the questions asked of the aspirant for novice"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 369ordination, as well as others. He is asked, for example, Are you a man? Haveyou the male sex organ? Are you twenty years old? Do you have the three robesand the begging bowl? Are your parents alive?

Pema Karpo states that the person becoming a monk must not be under theeffect of an intoxicant, in a confused state of mind, naked, etc. (TV, vol. Nga,f. 27b4).72. According to Pema Karpo, to know that the preceptor is not a monk, or tointend to reject him afterwards, are thoughts incompatible with the ordination(TV, vol. Nga, f. 27b2).73. Pema Karpo states that those to be shown reverence are renunciates of thesame gender and senior to oneself in ordination; those to whom there is no needto show reverence are the laity, monks junior to oneself in ordination, nuns, andthose monks who even though senior to oneself have been demoted or are un-dergoing disciplinary measures (TV, vol. Nga, f. 33a3-4).74. Eleven instructions on points of discipline (gdams ngag bcu gcig):(1) The instruction on right lifestyle free of the two extremes of indul-gence and harsh ascetism: (a) to wear discarded rags as one’s clothes(or whatever one is given, provided it is made of coarse material);(b) to live on alms (or whatever has been offered to oneself or to themonastic community as a whole); (c) to live under trees (or wher-ever a dwelling has been provided); and (d) to partake of the resi-dues of broths as food (or when given by others, sugar cane, sesameoil, honey, powdered sugar, or other medicines prepared from roots,stalks, leaves, flowers, or fruits).(2) The instruction on right morality: to eschew the four defeating of-fenses—sexual intercourse, theft, murder, and untruth—that are themost serious transgressions of morality for a monk.(3) The instruction on the four duties of a monk: not to respond to beingchided by chiding, to anger with anger, to being hit by strikingback, or to abusive words with abusive words.(4) The instruction on the favorable conditions for the training: to remem-ber that the vows of a monk, the highest aspiration, have been as-sumed with the fulfillment of the excellent conditions of the pre-ceptor, teachers, monks, and ceremony.(5) The instruction on example: to observe the same discipline as the monkwho is in his first day of monastic life, even if one is a monk whohas maintained ordination for one hundred years.(6) The first instruction on the right outlook: to respect one’s preceptorwho is of utmost importance to oneself, considering him as a fa-ther.

Concerning the vow of strict observance of celibacy (tshangs spyod la nye bargnas pa’i sdom pa), Gunaprabha states that the bestowal of this vow constitutesthe intermediate part of the nun’s ordination. In the first part, her request tobecome a nun is forwarded to the abbess with a report on whether she is freefrom obstacles to her ordination (not having received permission from family orhusband, being pregnant, etc.). The second part of the ceremony consists of herrequest for the vows of strict observance of celibacy, which is forwarded to theabbess along with a report confirming that she will abide by such a vow (deter-mined from further questioning), and the final agreement by the abbess whichsignals the conferral of the vow. In the third part, she is fully ordained by agroup of both monks and nuns. An extensive explanation of the rules for nunsconcludes the ceremony (HFP, ff. 122b6-141a2). Pema Karpo mentions that a woman cannot receive this vow if she has anyof the following five obstacles: having both the male and female organ or havingneither; menstruating continuously or having no menstruation (including womenbelow twelve and above fifty); having no feeling in the vagina, etc.; and havingbeen a nun before (TV, vol. Nga, f. 35a5).77. Eleven of the twelve points of discipline are the same eleven instructions forthe monks (see note 74), except that there are eight (not four) defeating offensesfor a nun, and the instruction to live under a tree is omitted in order to safeguardher vow of celibacy. The twelfth point consists in the instruction concerning theeight severe precepts (see note 36). For a detailed discussion of the nun’s vows,see Gunaprabha’s SD, ff. 50a3-56b7.78. The causes for losing the vows (sdom pa gtong ba’i rgyu). See the section withthis name (below)."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 37179. Asanga discusses ten conditions for damaging the vows (sdom pa nyams pa’irgyu bcu):(1) To have assumed the monastic vows for improper reasons and not inorder to seek one’s liberation;(2) Weak observance of the ethical code (lack of shame, remorse, etc.);(3) To have regret for what is not a fault;(4) Carelessness (not remembering what the transgressions to the rulesare, not acting in accordance with the doctrine, perpetuating one’smistakes, etc.) and laziness;(5) To have the wrong aspiration, such as wishing to be born as a god bymaintaining the vow of celibacy, to gain profit or honor for oneself,or to cause others to gain them, etc.;(6) Corruption of the monastic style of life by allowing one’s conduct,daily activities, and cultivation of virtue to degenerate;(7) Degeneration of one’s means of livelihood by becoming over-desirous, lacking contentment, craving clothes, food, medicines,dwelling, and bedding, etc.;(8) To fall into either of the two extremes, the extreme of luxury—by be-ing attached to good food, etc.—or the extreme of asceticism—bypracticing extreme forms of asceticism, such as sleeping on a bedof thorns or in ashes, burning oneself, staying in water, standingon one leg, etc.;(9) To think that by simply observing morality and discipline one willattain liberation;(10) To allow the ethics one has promised to observe to degenerate by be-ing careless, to have no regard for monastic life, and to be immoralor evil, like a rotten tree.(Proclaimers’ Stages [⁄r›vakabhÒmi; Nyan thos kyi sa] [henceforth cited as PS][Toh. 4036], ff. 16a3-21b2.)80. Asanga discusses this point as follows: as soon as an impulse to act withbody, speech, and mind arises, a monk must examine the nature of the act, byreflecting on whether the action would be harmful or useful to himself and oth-ers. If harmful, the monk ponders the unpleasant consequences that would en-sue; if useful, the favorable results. Having understood that an action would beharmful, he should avoid it; seeing that it would be useful, he should perform it.In the same way, he should investigate his past actions, and if he realizes that hehas done something improper, should confess it in front of a wise and saintlyfellow monk. Day and night, the monk should follow a positive course (PS,ff. 22b7-23b7).81.

Thus,they are called “related.” Infractions related to murder would be to fail to elimi-nate potential causes of aggression, to be violent, to engage in a battle, to strikesomeone, to cause regret in someone, etc. Infractions related to theft would beto appropriate offerings donated to the community, to sit on a seat that is notintended for oneself, to hide another ’s possessions for a joke, etc. (Commentaryon the Three Hundred Stanzas on the Novitiate [MÒlasarv›stiv›diŸr›ma ̊era-k›rik›v ̧ttiprabh›vati; ’Od ldan/ ’Phags pa gzhi thams cad yod par smra ba’i dge tshulgyi tshig le’ur byas pa’i ’grel ba ’od ldan] [Toh. 4125] [henceforth cited as CTHSN],ff. 75b7-76a5).92.

Pema Karpo includes among the various obligations of the student the fol-lowing: having respect for and serving the teacher, procuring begging bowlsand robes for him, helping the sick, dispelling regret caused by having commit-ted a transgression, renouncing opinions contrary to the doctrine, willingly un-dergoing disciplinary measures when one is at fault, etc. The obligations of thetutor include instructing the disciple, turning him away from bad friends whohave let their ethics degenerate, inspiring him to practice the wholesome (whichmeans to engage in study and meditation and to rise above moral transgres-sions), helping him to engage in right livelihood, imposing on him disciplinarymeasures only when necessary, and being patient with worthy disciples, etc.(TV, vol. Nga, ff. 40b1-43a6).102. According to Tsonapa, the defeating offenses (pham pa) deserve seriouspunishment; the partial defeats (lhag ma) (lit. “with remainder”) can be purifiedby ritual while openly confessing to one’s fellow monks; the downfalls [thatrequire forfeiture or confession alone] (ltung byed) and the offenses that must beindividually confessed (so sor bshags par bya ba) can also be purified in the sameway as the partial defeats; the minor infractions (nyes byas) are downfalls that donot belong to the above four classes (SIRD, f. 146a6-b4).103.K›r ̋›pa ̊a: a coin or weight of fluctuating value used in ancient India. Ac-cording to the Summary of Discipline, one karshapana was worth twenty masaka (atiny red and black bean weighing about an eighth of a gram) of gold. A quarterkarshapana was therefore equal to five masaka, which during a period of no fam-ine was worth five bushels of [dry] barley (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the ThreeVo w s, ff. 57b2-58a2).104. On this point, Tsonapa states: A fetus in its nineteenth week of develop-ment onward is called a human being (mi) as it has already formed all the sen-sory organs. A fetus in its eighteenth week or less is called a forming humanbeing (mir chags pa). Both are considered human beings (mir gyur ba).To murder a human being is a defeat (pham pa), since a human is the basisfor (i.e., could become the embodiment of) the Three Jewels and the three typesof ethics (vows of personal liberation, vows of meditative absorption, and un-contaminated vows). To murder a non-human (a god) amounts to a serious vio-lation (sbom po), since non-humans can be the basis for only two of the threeJewels and only two types of ethics. In fact, among the gods, there are manysaints who embody the Jewels of the community and of the doctrine and live bythe ethics derived from contemplation and uncontaminated wisdom. To kill ananimal is a downfall [that requires confession alone] (ltung byed), since animalsare neither the basis for the Three Jewels nor for the three types of vows (SIRD,ff. 195a3-196b3).105.

Tsonapa states that ill-will and longing for the objects of desire are prima-rily impediments when training in ethics; sleep and drowsiness are primarilyimpediments to the training in meditation; and having reservations about thedoctrine is an impediment to the training in discriminative awareness (SIRD,f. 205a5-7).110. Shakhyaprabha states that an offense with concealment is incurred whenthe monk who has committed the defeat harbors, even for a single moment, theintention to conceal it. Thus, intention is the primary factor in an offense withconcealment; otherwise, a non-concealed offense would be an impossibility sinceit is unlikely that after a single moment the offender could find someone to con-fess to (CTHSN, f. 125b3).111. According to Tsonapa, an exception (sel ba) is a case in which the defeat oranother downfall does not occur because the object (for example, stolen goods)does not fulfill the condition of worth, etc., because one is not in a normal stateof mind (i.e., is in a deranged state of mind), or because the action itself [is notcompleted] (SIRD, f. 166b4).112.

According to Tsonapa, unimpaired (ma nyams pa) organ refers to the organof a living person or of a human corpse not affected by a disease such as leprosy(SIRD, f. 154b1-2). See also Shakyaprabha’s CTHSN, ff. 121b7-123a2 and PemaKarpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 56b5.118. Tsonapa states that this means not having a disease such as one causingimpotency that prevents the experience of orgasm (SIRD, f. 154b7).119. Serious infractions (sbom po): infractions that occur only in relation to de-feating and partially defeating offenses. (Tsonapa’s SIRD, f. 141a3).The word “serious” (sbom po, lit. “gross”) indicates that the offense is not amajor one since the complementary branches are not all present, and yet it is aserious transgression.120. According to Tsonapa, this implies that to touch the nails, the teeth, and thehair of a woman are not partial defeats but related serious violations (sbom po)(SIRD, f. 215b2).121. With regard to this rule, Tsonapa states that the monk’s words should clearlyrefer to sexual intercourse and not just allude to it in unclear terms (in whichcase, the offense would be a related serious violation and not a partial defeat).For example, the suggestion might be stated as a direct request (gsol ba) (“Lady,come! Let’s make love.”) or an indirect one (nye bar gsol ba) (“When a womanand man make love, it is pleasurable. If we were to make love, it would also bepleasurable.”) (SIRD, ff. 217b3-218b1).122. Tsonapa explains that to act as an intermediary has three phases: first, themonk suggests to a person that he or she engage in sexual relationship withanother; next, the monk conveys the same suggestion to the prospective part-ner; finally, the monk receives the answer from this last person and conveys it tothe first person. This partial defeat is incurred even if the monk does not actu-ally carry the last message, but the first person comes to know of it by othermeans (SIRD, ff. 221b7-222a1).123. f. 13a5.124.

Before building, the monk must first ask permission"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 377of the community. The suitability of the site for a hut or other dwelling is subjectto the judgment of the monastic community, who will inspect the place or ap-point a monk to do so. (SIRD, ff. 133b7-136b1; and Gunaprabha’s HFP, ff. 141a2-144a1).125. Cubit (khru): the length measured from the elbow to the tip of the out-stretched middle finger.126. Materials acquired in an illegal way.127. Tsonapa clarifies that “having heard” (thos) means that the monk who bringsforth the accusation of a defeating act should actually have heard the soundmade by one of his fellow monks engaged in sexual intercourse (for example).To make a false accusation by reporting the words of a third person who hassaid that a certain monk has committed a defeating offense would constitute arelated serious violation but not a partial defeat. The same applies for havingseen (mthong) or having suspected (dogs). If a monk, believing another ’s words,lies by saying “I personally have seen,” or having simply a suspicion, says, “Ihave seen,” he incurs the partial defeat (SIRD, f. 240a1-b6).128. Tsonapa explains the difference between “groundless accusation” and “ac-cusation for a trivial reason.” In the first case, the monk bringing forth the accu-sation clearly states the agent-action relationship: “I have seen the monk (so andso) incur (such and such) a defeating offense.” In the second case, the agent-action relationship is not stated clearly, as in “I have seen the monk (so and so)and the nun (so and so). I have seen the act of sexual intercourse.”The event that led to the prescription of this rule occurred in Rajagriha.Two monks, Suhrit (mDza’ bo) and Salé kye (Sa las skyes), had made an accusa-tion without relating agent and action against the monk Vasumallaputra (Gyadbu nor) and the nun Utpali after having seen two deer copulating. Seeing thetwo deer copulating was the trivial (bag tsam) reason (SIRD, ff. 240b7-241a5).129. The circumstance that led to the institution of this rule was a schism thatdeveloped at the time of the Buddha in the monastic community at Rajagriha inBihar caused by Devadatta, Buddha’s cousin.The partial defeat of causing a schism involves taking up an incorrect doctri-nal view, converting other monks to this view, and thereby creating a division inthe community. A schism can take place only in our continent (world),Jambudvipa, within the boundaries of a monastery, and in a place where theBuddha is not residing. Furthermore, the monks involved in the schism mustnot number less than nine (counting the monk causing the schism); must beordinary monks (who have not seen the truth), four on the correct side and fouron the non-doctrinal side; must be monks who have pure morality; and must bewise in the three classes of scriptures (otherwise, they could not be taken seri-ously). Moreover, a schism could not occur when the Buddha had just attainedenlightenment, before he attained it, or after he had passed away (unless one ofhis two outstanding disciples was still alive).Differentiation must be made among the different forms of schism, “causing"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"378 Buddhist Ethicsdissension in the community” (dge ’dun dbyen), “causing a schism that is a deedof immediate retribution” (dbyen gyi mtshams med), and “the partial defeat ofcausing a schism” (dbyen gyi lhag ma). The first is a neutral phenomenon (neithervirtuous nor unvirtuous) of disharmony among the monks. The second involvesan actual schism in the community [and is caused by a monk] through lying.This schism results in a birth in the hell of Unceasing Torture for the monk whohas caused it. The third is a partial defeat that is incurred when the offenderdoes not desist after having been reprimanded three times by fellow monks. Thisform of schism may be incurred by a monk or a nun (but not by a newly ordainedmonk who has recently begun his training). The schism need not actually takeplace (if it does take place, the schism would be considered the second type).Some scriptures state that after the demise of the Buddha, the conditions nec-essary for these three forms of schism no longer applied. Nevertheless, a monkwho causes a division within the community incurs a serious violation (SID, ff.95a4-97b6). As for the unwanted consequence of a schism, it is said that as longas a schism in the community is not resolved, the followers of the Buddhistdoctrine living in one great third-order thousand world-system, the buddha-field of a single buddha, will not attain any of the five experiential paths (SID16,f. 82a2-5). See also Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, ff. 61b3-5; 118a6-5; and Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 114a3-116a1.130. Tsonapa explains this as follows: causing a lay devotee to lose faith as aresult of one’s bad behavior or by proclaiming the faults of other monks andthen defaming the monks who have expelled oneself on this account, saying,“They have expelled me because of their desire, anger, or stupidity” (SIRD, ff.251b3-252a2).131. As an alternative interpretation, Tsonapa states that “defeats of the monas-tic community” (dge ’dun lhag ma, lit. “with remainder in the monastic commu-nity”) are so called because the monk who incurs one is not expelled from themonastic community (as is the monk who has incurred a defeating offense), butstill remains part of it (SIRD, f. 149b7).132. Gunaprabha’s SD, f. 40a3.133. Tsonapa’s defines conscientious friend (khrims grogs) as a friend who pre-vents a monk from incurring a downfall and who is not non-human, mute orstupid, insane, a hermaphrodite, or blind (SIRD, f. 213b3-5).134. According to Tsonapa, a “convenient place for sexual intercourse” impliesthat the monk stays with a woman closer than the length of a bow (a fathom) on aseat that is fit for copulation. If the monk is not closer than a fathom to the womanor on a seat unfit for sexual intercourse, he may incur only a partial defeat (touch-ing a woman) or a downfall (sitting with a woman) (SIRD, f. 141a5-6).135. Tsonapa states that although classed among the downfalls that require for-feiture, in this case no forfeiture is required (SIRD, f. 263b1).136. A piece of cloth sufficient to cover the three areas when one is seated in thecross-legged position."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 379137. Tsonapa notes that if the monk has left the robe within the same boundary,the downfall is not incurred; if the monk is living in solitude, is old or sick, etc.,he may be excused from the rule of “to be separate from the three robes” for aday; and if the robes are not consecrated, to be separated from them is not adownfall (SIRD, f. 313b6).138. All three (the patron, the person who carries the money, and the caretakerin this case) must be male laypersons. If any one of them is a monk, the insis-tence becomes a minor infraction (SIRD, f. 295a3-5).139. “To make” also implies to commission someone to make (SIRD, f. 299a2).This applies also to the infractions of similar types listed below.Silk and black wool were prohibited because at that time they were expensiveand difficult to obtain. Silk, in addition, had to be made by sacrificing the livesof many larvae.140. One and a half cubits as measured on a medium-sized man.141. One earshot (rgyang grags) is a measure of five hundred bow-lengths, onebow being four cubits (SIRD, f. 302b2).142. The consecration of a precious substance that a monk has acquired or do-nated, and which is to be used for a virtuous purpose, is to be done through athree-part ceremony: (1) Before the monk makes use of a precious item to buyrobes or other things, he should think that it does not belong to him, but that itbelongs to the householder who has donated it. (2) He entrusts it to the care-taker of the community who is a lay practitioner or a novice, making him acceptthat he (the caretaker) now owns it. (3) When the monk needs to use the pre-cious substance to buy something, the consecration is done by first placing it infront of another monk. If that monk is an elder, the monk requesting the conse-cration prostrates to him. After that, both stand up and raise their hands overthe substance, and the monk repeats three times after the elder the appropriateformula of consecration (SIRD, ff. 304b6-305b1).143. See below section “Conditions for Living Comfortably: Food and Medi-cine” for the types of permissible food and medicine.Kongtrul here mentions only three types, excluding the fourth, because suchmedicines are consecrated for life. Thus, once consecrated, they may be kepteven after the monk has recovered from his illness without incurring the down-fall of storing. If unconsecrated, the permitted time for any of the four types offood and medicine expires within the next of the four periods of the day andnight in which they have been acquired. See Dharmashri’s Commentary on theThree Vows, f. 69a1-6.144. Sönam Drakpa mentions that the article is relinquished (spang) by separa-tion (’bral), i.e., putting it in another place (the house of another monk, for ex-ample). Relinquishment is of two types, temporary (re shig spang ba) and perma-nent (gtan du spang ba). When a monk possesses more than one extra beggingbowl, he should put them permanently into the custody of any of the five types"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"380 Buddhist Ethicsof ordained persons; when he has taken back gifts he had given to a fellow monk,he should return them permanently to that monk. With the exception of thesetwo, all other articles relinquished prior to confessing one of these thirty down-falls are relinquished temporarily (for one day) (SID, ff. 106b6-107a).145. Lying that constitutes a defeat means making a false claim to high spiritualattainment. Lying that constitutes a partial defeat would be, for example, agroundless accusation [to a fellow monk of having incurred a defeat when hehas not]. Lying that is a serious violation would be teaching a false doctrine to agathering of monks. Lying that falls into the category of minor infractions wouldbe, for example, knowing that one has incurred a downfall, but remaining silentduring the confession ceremony when the elder who recites the Personal LiberationScripture asks three times, “Are you pure [free of downfalls]?” (SID, f. 118b1-6).146. Tsonapa states that a monk is allowed to cut vegetation and use seeds if therite of consecration of these has been done and it is for a permitted purpose. Apermitted purpose would be the building of an image or statue of the Buddhaor a stupa, or for the sake of the doctrine or monastic community. The sameexception applies to tilling the soil and lighting a fire. The consecration (rung babyed pa) of vegetation or seed must be done by a novice or a layperson as monksare not permitted to do this rite (SIRD, ff. 334b1-338a6).147. To be appointed as a teacher of nuns, a monk must fulfill sixteen qualifica-tions: respectability (not having incurred a defeat or partial defeat and beingconscientious in that he has forsaken unwholesome deeds such as killing ani-mals); steadfastness (twenty years of standing as a monk); learning (knowledgeof the three collections of the scriptures); and thirteen qualities of helpfulness(the twelve explained in the first chapter of this work in the discussion of thequalifications of the monastic preceptor, plus not having previously been ap-pointed as a nuns’ teacher and then removed from that position). A monk withthese qualifications is appointed to be the nuns’ teacher within the boundary ofhis monastic community; qualified fellow monks perform the appropriate cer-emony during the confession ceremony of the fifteenth of the lunar month (SIRD,ff. 349a1-351a1).148. Tsonapa states that the woman in question here is a nun. If a monk standsalone with a woman who is not a nun, he incurs a minor infraction, not thisdownfall (SIRD, ff. 355b1-356a1).149. To eat more than two middle-sized begging bowls of food constitutes thisinfraction (CNPTV, f. 38b6). Dharmashri specifies that to eat more than a fulllarge-sized begging bowl, two medium-sized, or three small-sized begging bowlsis to incur this infraction (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 74b3-4).150. Leftover food is made permissible (lhag por byed pa) through a three-partritual: (1) The monk washes his hands, and after having ritually accepted thefood, makes a request to a fellow monk (who has not left the meal and is withinthe boundary of the monastic residence) to make it permissible. That fellow monkeats two or three morsels of it. (2) The fellow monk then says, “It is yours. Go!”(3) The fellow monk hands over the food to the one who has requested it to bemade permissible, who then gets up and leaves (SIRD, ff. 362b5-363a)."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 381151. “Standing up after having started the meal” is also part of the downfallsince it may be the cause for resuming eating (SIRD, f. 360b4).152. See below, section “Conditions for Living Comfortably: Food and Medi-cine” for the four types of permissible food and medicine.The ritual is as follows: With the intention of allowing the offering and accep-tance (byin len) of the food, the monk stands up, raises his hands with the palmsfacing upward, and accepts the food with the awareness that this is being do-nated by the novice or layman who is offering the food in front of him. No otherrituals are involved (SIRD, f. 373b6-374).153. Gunaprabha states that “good foods” (zas bsod pa) refers to milk, curds,ghee, butter, oil, honey, sugar, fish, and dry meat, which are not permissibleunless one is ill or one has been offered them (SD, f. 38a2).154. The difference between the rule prohibiting use of water that contains liv-ing beings and the rule prohibiting casting and using water that contains livingbeings (the ninth of the second set of downfalls to be individually confessed) isthat, in the former case, the rule prohibits the use of such water for one’s ownsake, and the latter prohibits the use or casting of such water for the sake of bothoneself and the monastic community (SIRD, ff. 336b6-337b6).155. Tsonapa specifies the conditions that would constitute “special necessity”:if the ascetic is one’s relative; if he could be converted to Buddhism; or if he issick. If the ascetic is begging, the monk should ask him or her to put the beggingcup on the ground; if he refuses to do so, he should not be given food. The mainpurpose of this rule is to prevent adherents of other religions from receivingmore veneration than the Buddhist monks themselves. Since the laity has of-fered the food to the monks, if the monks then offer it to adherents of otherreligions, the laity may consider non-Buddhist faiths to be superior (SIRD,f. 379a4-b6).156. Consecration (byin rlabs): within the scriptures on discipline, this term doesnot have the connotation of “blessing” or “making sacred” but instead indicatesa “ritualized act” or “thought,” the aim of which is to make the monk aware ofthe disadvantages of transgressing a particular rule, or of permission given incertain cases.157. Consecration of downfalls (ltung ba’i byin rlabs): a part of the rite for purifi-cation of downfalls (ltung ba’i phyir bcos). This consists in a ceremonial requestalone made in order that (1) the ripening effect of the downfall does not in-crease; (2) the power decreases by being counteracted by the antidote; and (3)the monk is eligible to participate in the monastic ceremonies, confession, etc.158. The initial assent is given to the ceremonial master who is officiating at aceremony, whether it be related to the monastic community in general, the ordi-nation of a new monk, or a ceremony related to the doctrine. For this to be adownfall, the assent must be withdrawn once the formal procedure has beencompleted (SIRD, ff. 380b6-381a1).159. Not fully ordained (bsnyen par ma rdzogs pa) includes monks who have in-curred a defeating offense with concealment, or have been demoted because of"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"382 Buddhist Ethicsincurring a defeat without concealment. For the offense to occur, the place mustbe roofed and walled (SIRD, ff. 389b6-390a1). If a monk has to sleep with an unordained person, he should do so at a dis-tance of eight and half cubits in order to avoid this downfall (CNPTV, f. 40a5).160. Erroneous views (sdig pa’i lta ba) refers to not believing that what the Bud-dha declared to be obstacles to the discipline are in fact obstacles [for example,believing that drinking alcohol or eating after noon is not an infraction of therules] (Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 189b6-190b1). Tsonapa points out that “erroneous view” does not mean “wayward view”(log lta), which would constitute a condition for losing the vows in their entirety(SIRD, f. 391a2).161. According to Gunaprabha, this means to give spiritual instructions to amonk who has been expelled from the monastery because of his erroneous views,or to use his belongings, accept his service, or sleep in the same area. This doesnot apply if he is sick or has given up his erroneous view or the other causes thatled to the expulsion (SD, f. 42a2).162. The three prescribed colors are blue, red, and orange. Dharmashri addsthat this downfall is incurred when one wears white clothing. If one wears blackor variegated clothing, or clothing dyed with one of the precious dyes, only aminor infraction is incurred.163. This refers to bathing the entire body in a pool. Washing parts of the bodyis permissible.164. Tsonapa specifies that for this downfall to occur the monk does not need toreach the point of intoxication; not even as much as the tip of a blade of grass ofalcohol is permitted for monks (SIRD, f. 409b1).165. Gunaprabha states that the monk who commits this offense has arrangedfor the community to receive alms from a patron and has not given authoriza-tion that the food be distributed if he himself is late, and that as a result, the foodis not distributed to the other monks until his arrival (SD, f. 47a4).166. Pema Karpo states that some monks would place cotton under the com-munal seats in order to make them more comfortable, an improper practice be-cause the robes of other monks sitting on these seats would become coveredwith cotton lint (TV, vol. Nga, ff. 215b3-216a3).167. To eat food outside the monastery (in a place that is an earshot or morefrom a village) or in a solitary place without checking whether accepting foodwould entail danger of thieves, etc., for the donor or one’s fellow monks. Thedownfall is incurred when one has been appointed to investigate the safety ofthe place and has eaten without performing this duty (TV, vol. Nga, f. 220a1-b1).168. The eight defeats of a nun (dge slong ma’i pham pa brgyad):Sexual intercourse, theft, murder, untruth,Touching, lying with, concealing, and preventing readmission.The first four are the same as the four defeats of a monk. Touching comprisesobject, intention, and act. The object is a sexually able male. The intention is the"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 383desire to engage in sexual intercourse. The act is to touch, fondle, or caress himwith any part of her body from the knees upward.Lying with a man also involves object, intention, and act. The object, as be-fore, is a sexually able male. The intention is the desire to engage in sexual inter-course. The act is to lie with the male in a place that is fit for intercourse andwhere they cannot be interrupted.Concealing comprises object, intention, and act. The object is another nunwho has incurred any of the eight defeats. Intention refers to the decision toconceal the fact. The act is to conceal the other nun’s defeat while being awarethat she has incurred it. The consummation of the act occurs if the defeat isconcealed for a day and night.Preventing readmission also comprises object, intention, and act. The objectis a nun who has been expelled from the monastery who wishes to request for-giveness and readmission. The intention is to impede that nun’s re-entry. Theact is to prevent the nun from asking forgiveness of the community. The con-summation of the act is not to allow her to undertake the necessary steps forasking forgiveness (Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, f. 244a).169. For an explanation of the nuns’ rules, see Gunaprabha’s SD, ff. 50a3-56b6.170. Sönam Drakpa states that the basis of legal decisions to deal with disagree-ments over formal procedures of the order (adhikarana, las dbye ba’i gzhi) is calledKoŸ›mbı, from a disagreement over formal procedures that occurred at the timeof the Buddha among the monks of the city of Koshambi. A similar incidentoccurred among the monks of Shravasti (SID16, f. 2a-b1).171. According to Sönam Drakpa, the basis for amendment of downfalls throughsubjugation (nan tur gyi phyir bcos kyi gzhi) is called P› ̊ ̃ulohitaka (dmar ser can,lit. “clad in orange”) from the designation given to a group of quarrelsome monkswho persisted in evil behavior (at the time of the Buddha) and were subjected tothis method in order to amend their offenses (SID16, f. 2b1-2).172. Sönam Drakpa states that the basis dealing with the duration of conceal-ment of a partial defeat (dus dang dus ma yin pa bsdud pa’i ’byung ba’i gzhi) iscalled the basis of the individual (pudgal›, gang zag) because it is in relation to aparticular individual that the length of time a partial defeat has been concealedis reckoned (SID16, f. 2b1-2).173. The basis of degrading (sa gzhan na gnas pa) a monk is called the basis ofdemotion (spo ba’i gzhi) because a different (lower) status (sa gzhan) is imposedas a disciplinary measure on the offending monk, who must then perform thetasks of one who has been demoted (spo ba spyod pa), as well as appeasing ser-vices (mgu pa spyod pa) (SID16, f. 2b3-4).174. In Sönam Drakpa’s explanation, the basis related to the training (yongs suspyod pa’i gzhi) is called suspension from confession (gso sbyong gzhag pa) be-cause at the time of an allegation of a downfall, if the alleged monk does notcomply with the advice to amend his downfall, he is not allowed to participatein the confession ceremony of the monastic community. If that suspension doesnot succeed in subduing him, the monk is suspended from the lifting of the"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"384 Buddhist Ethicsrestrictions ceremony that marks the end of the rainy season retreat (as well asbeing suspended from [further] advice). The last two suspensions (from the lift-ing of restrictions ceremony and receiving further advice) are included withinthe basis of suspension from confession (SID16, f. 2b5-6).175. The basis for resolving schisms in the community (dge ’dun dbyen rnamsbsdus pa) is also known as the basis concerned with the ways to resolve schismsconcerning the “wheel” (’khor lo dbye ba’i gzhi), “wheel” referring here to theBuddha’s doctrine (SID16, f. 8b5). Dharmashri states that schism differs fromdisagreement over formal procedures (see notes 170 and 240) in that the schismis caused by monks who split the monastic community as a result of which apart of the monastic community comes to follow a teacher other than the Bud-dha and a path other than the path taught by the Buddha. The previous case ofthe disagreement occurs when monks who profess ideas contrary to the doc-trine perform a different ceremony within the same boundary (Commentary onthe Three Vows, f. 118a4-6).176. Ordination is the basis concerned with the ceremony of assuming the monk’svows. Nine bases—numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 15 of the above list—areconcerned with safeguarding the rules. Seven—numbers 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and17 of the above list—concern amending downfalls.177. According to Pema Karpo, the duties of the helper of a meditating monk(who must be duly appointed by the monastic community) are to sprinkle thehut with water, sweep, spread fresh cow urine, prepare the seat, and so forth(TV, vol. Nga, f. 258a1-4).178. Mental quiescence (Ÿamatha, zhi gnas): a state of concentration reached uponthe attainment of a special bliss characterized by physical and mental pliancy,on which basis the meditator can unwaveringly analyze reality. See Hopkins’ ME.179. Nine methods of setting the mind (sems gnas pa’i thabs dgu). See note 312.See also ME, pp. 80-90.180. Insight (vipaŸyan›, lhag mthong): a form of analytical introspection appliedto gain realization of the ultimate nature of things and thereby overcome one’semotions.181. Four mindfulnesses (dran pa nye bar gzhag pa bzhi): modes of discriminativeawareness applied in understanding the emptiness of body (lus), feelings (tshorba), mental processes (sems), and mental contents (chos).182. The five paths (lam lnga) of accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation,and no more learning. The paths of accumulation (tshogs lam) and preparation(sbyor lam) are the stages at which the understanding of reality is conceptuallycultivated through study and reflection. The path of seeing (mthong lam) de-notes the point at which a direct and contemplative sight of emptiness is gained.This leads to the path of meditation (sgoms lam) at which stage one repeatedlyenters the contemplation on emptiness in order to remove intellectual and emo-tional impediments that prevent the dawn of universal knowledge on the pathof no more learning (mi slob lam)."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 385183.

The confession to foster harmony is performed in order to engage in thethree trainings in ethics, contemplation, and discriminative awareness, whichare necessary for all types of renunciates. In particular, it is performed to refinethe monks’ ethics; to keep their practice of the doctrine pure in that during theconfession they awaken virtuous minds; and to prevent their being stained bythe fault of not confessing lapses in discipline. The purification-renewal relatedto the development of mental quiescence is performed to practice the trainingsof contemplation and discriminative awareness (SID16, f. 3b2-3). According toDharmashri, the first is performed to prevent the arising of what would causeimpediments in this life, and the second, to cleanse oneself of impediments cre-ated in previous lives (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 90b2-3)."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"386 Buddhist Ethics187. This citation paraphrases those of Dharmashri in his Commentary on theThree Vows (f. 91a6-b3).188. The Mongolian (Hor) calendar, equivalent to the Tibetan one, originated in1207 when the Tibetan region of Minyak (known in Chinese as Hsi-hsia) wasconquered by Genghis Khan. To commemorate this event, the day of victorywas declared to be the first day of the calendar year. Henceforth, this calendarbecame widely accepted throughout Tibet.189. Tsonapa (mTsho sna pa) and Jadul (dGe bshes Bya ’dul ba ’dzin pa) (1091-1167): Both were important masters in propagating the monastic tradition inTibet. See Blue Annals, pp. 80, 304, and 321.190. See chapter I, note 117.191. Chökyi Wangchuk, the Sixth Shamar (Zhwa dmar drug pa Chos kyi dbangphyug), was renowned for his scholarship. The Shamar incarnation lineage be-gins with Drakpa Sengé (Grags pa seng ge), a disciple of Rangjung Dorjé (Rangbyung rdo rje), the Third Karmapa (1284-1338). He became known as Shamar(lit. “red hat”) when he was given a red crown by the king of Hor.192. Sönam Drakpa specifies that the large boundary surrounds an area with aradius of two and a half leagues. The small boundary surrounds an area largeenough for the monks to gather with a bow-length’s space to spare (SID16, f. 7a4).193. According to Sönam Drakpa, the preparatory part of a confession rite hassix parts: (1) An image of the Buddha is set up with offerings, a four-part ritualoffering is made to those gods who favor the doctrine, and the gandi wood isstruck to summon the monks. (2) Downfalls are purified through confession,restraint, and consecration. (3) Temple duties, sweeping and so forth, are per-formed. (4) The night before the confession, teachings on the doctrine are given;if that is not possible, the Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture is recited. (5) Thedisciplinary monk distributes sticks to determine the number of participantsand receives the requests to be excused by those who are unable to attend theconfession. (6) The monks offer flowers and request the elder to recite the Per-sonal Liberation Scripture (SID16, ff. 18b4-19a1).194. See note 157.195. Sönam Drakpa describes the gandi wood as a plank made of red or whitesandalwood, Ashoka wood, etc., measuring 84 finger-widths in length, six fin-gers in width, and two in thickness. The ends are shaped like the mouth of afrog. It is struck with a pestle of wood shaped like the head of a mongoose andtwelve fingers long (SID16, f. 16a4-6).196. This refers to the Pure Ethics Scripture (⁄ılasa ̇yuktasÒtra; Tshul khrims yangdag par ldan pa’i mdo) (also called Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture; Chos bsgragskyi mdo) (Toh. 303), f. 127a2-b7.197.Personal Liberation Scripture (Pr›timok ̋asÒtra; So sor thar ba’i mdo) (Toh. 2)."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 387This scripture lists the context for the prescription of the rules, the defeats, thepartial defeats, the undetermined offenses, and the summary of rules.198.Commit no evil,Engage in excellent virtue,Fully tame your mind:This is the Buddha’s teaching.For a longer form of this original formula, see The Buddha’s Philosophy: Selectionsfrom the Pali Canon by G.

Tsonapa explains this simile as follows: When sprouts of corn (k›ra ̊ ̃ava;sred da), which resemble barley sprouts, are planted together with barley, theywill harm the barley’s growth. Likewise, the corn-like elder, meaning an elderwith corrupted morality, resembles in attire the pure elders, but his faults willcontaminate those who associate with him (SIRD, f. 116a6).200. Pema Karpo states that the Buddha instituted the three-month rainy sea-son retreat when his monks became the objects of criticism by non-Buddhistswho claimed that Buddhist monks wandering around during the rainy seasonwere crushing insects (which were far more numerous during that season thanothers) and therefore were not maintaining their vows not to kill (TV vol. Nga, f.271a6-b3).201. Alpha Aquiloe (gro shun/ gro bshin): the month that corresponds to the sixthmonth of the Mongolian calendar, beginning on the sixteenth of that month(CNPTV, f. 45b1).202. Alpha Pegasi (khrums stod): the constellation by which is named the monththat corresponds to the seventh month of the Mongolian calendar, beginning onthe sixteenth of that month.203. Antares (snron): the constellation by which is named the month that corre-sponds to the fourth month of the Mongolian calendar.204. These preparations are made ten or fifteen days before the start of the re-treat (Gunaprabha’s SD, f. 61a6).205. Gunaprabha states that an anointed stick (bskus pa’i tshul shing) is first of-fered to the Buddha or an image of him. The rest of the sticks are distributed tothe monks in order of seniority who accept the sticks as a sign of joyful accep-tance of the rules of the retreat. The sticks are then collected, made into a bundle,and attached to a pillar of the temple where they are kept until the end of theretreat, when they are again counted to verify the number of monks who haveattended the retreat (SD, f. 61a7-b5).206. Sönam Drakpa states that there are six commitments of the rainy seasonretreat: to remain in the place one has promised to; not to cause disputes duringthe retreat; to endeavor to listen, ponder, and meditate on the doctrine; not to do"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"388 Buddhist Ethicsrepair work on monastery buildings; to remain in retreat for the specified time;and not to cross the boundary.Disruption of the retreat occurs if a monk wanders beyond the boundary with-out permission and does not return until dawn of the following day. If a monkneeds to go beyond the boundary for a virtuous purpose, he should be conse-crated to do so. Consecration lasts for seven days. If special permission has beengiven, the monk is allowed to stay out for up to forty days (SID16, f. 26a6-b4).207. Quitch grass (dÒrv›, ram pa) (Agropyron repens): a grass used as a medicinein the ayurvedic tradition, and as substance of offering in fire ritual. The manyknots of the grass are considered an auspicious symbol of longevity.According to Sönam Drakpa, both monks (the one for whom the restrictionshave to be lifted and the one appointed to lift them) hold the ends of the blade ofquitch grass or kusha grass. Kusha grass is a symbol of humility: just as thekusha bends without resistance, the monk bends in humility for being allowedto perform according to the doctrine what otherwise would be a downfall (SID16,f. 29a6-b1).208. According to some scholars, ka ̨hina (lit. “hard”) refers to the particular stockof cotton given by the faithful laity to the monks for their robes. Dharmashri,however, states that kathina means stable (gtan pa) and stretched (sra rkyang) andis the term used for the wooden slab to which the newly made robes are secured(Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 97b1-2).The kathina practice comprises the making of the new robes (cutting the pieces,stitching, washing, dyeing, and drying the robes all in the same day), their dis-tribution to the monks within the boundaries of the monastery, the actual cer-emony of laying them out, and their subsequent storage for the five-month pe-riod of the relaxation of rules that follows the monsoon season retreat. Tibetancommentaries refer to this practice as the “laying out of the robes on the woodenslab” (chos gos sra brkyang ’ding ba).As a preparation for the “laying out” ceremony, the monks bless the newrobes, gather within the boundary, and with a two-part procedure includingproposal, give assent to the ceremony for laying out the robes. With a proposal,they appoint a monk to lay out the robes, and once this is done, they entrust therobes to him. If the material has not been cut, stitched, etc., the appointed monkmakes sure that this is done.As for the actual ceremony which takes place on the sixteenth, the appointedmonk, in the midst of the monastic community, recites three times the formulafor the laying out of the robes. Then, holding the wooden slab, he stands in frontof each monk in turn (in order of seniority) and informs him that he is going tolay out the robes, while the monk shows his approval.The robes are spread out neatly and tightly, firmly secured on the woodenslab, and stored in the same general area as the rainy season retreat has takenplace. The monk especially appointed for this task watches over these robes forthe duration of the holiday period.One of the purposes of kathina was to provide incentive to the monks to un-dertake the rainy season retreat (those monks who did not stay in retreat were"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 389not allowed to participate and share the offerings distributed during the cer-emony). Another purpose served was that the downfalls of “keeping,” “beingseparated from,” and “retaining cloth” did not apply to monks participating inthe ceremony. Moreover, the ceremony allowed the sponsors of the communityto create merit through their generous gifts to the monks (SID16, f. 31a3-5).For details of this practice, see Constitution of the Buddhist Sangha (henceforthcited as CBS), Kanai Lal Hazra (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1988). For an inter-pretation of the purposes of this ceremony, see Discipline, The Canonical Bud-dhism of the Vinayapitaka, John C. Holt (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1981), pp.134-137. See also Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, f. 282.209. To make it easy to acquire one’s robes and for the donor to create merit,some of the monks’ rules (with the exception of those concerning defeats, par-tially defeating offenses, and naturally unwholesome actions) were relaxed.During the ka ̨hina practice, ten infractions to the monks’ rules did not apply tomonks who had participated in the rainy season retreat for the full period: (1)keeping extra cloth (gos lhag ’chang ba); (2) being separate from the three monas-tic robes (’bral ba); (3) keeping cloth for a month (zla ’jog) (these first three beingthe first, second, and third, respectively, of the thirty downfalls that require for-feiture); (4) eating consecutively (yang yang za ba), which is the first of the fourthset of downfalls requiring confession alone; (5) eating separately (’dus shing zaba), the sixth of the fourth set of ten downfalls requiring confession alone; (6)going to the village without informing (ma smras ba grong du ’gro ba), the first ofthe ninth set of downfalls requiring only confession; (7) requesting cloth (gos lenpa), the sixth of the first set of downfalls that involve forfeiture; (8) using rainyseason retreat offerings (rnyed pa thun mong du ’gyur ba), the sixth of the third setof ten that involves forfeiture; (9) keeping unconsecrated pieces of cloth (byingyis ma brlabs pa’i gos dum ’chang ba) that have not been cut for one of the threerobes; (10) wandering about the countryside without the upper robe (snam sbyarmed par ljongs rgyu) or being separated from the robes while in seclusion (dgonpa’i ’bral ba), seventh of the third set of downfalls involving forfeiture.(Gunaprabha’s SD, f. 65b1-2; and Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, f. 286a3-5).210. Pema Karpo specifies which monks are not entitled to receive the offeringsof robes, etc., during this ceremony: a monk who holds wayward or evil views,has committed a defeating offense, has been expelled from the monastery due tobeing quarrelsome, has taken a side against the doctrine, or has participated in arainy season retreat elsewhere (TV, vol. Nga, f. 286b4).211. “Ten advantages” refers to exemption from the ten rules concerning robes,etc., advantages in the sense that a monk does not incur any downfalls related tothese rules.212. This refers to any monk who has been part of the rainy season retreat andhas participated in the ceremony of entrusting the monastic robes made at theend of the retreat for safeguarding during the holiday period.213. The tradition of relaxing the rules in the kathina practice was abolished inTibet at the “time of the three,” the preceptor, master, and king (mkhan slob chos"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"390 Buddhist Ethicsgsum), the preceptor being Shantarakshita, the master, Padmasambhava, and theking, Trisong De’utsen (730-800). The relaxation was later revived by the KadampaGeshé Kokyimpa (Ko khyim pa), soon to disappear again (CNPTV, f. 45b).214. Vishakhadeva mentions seven appropriate materials for the monks’ robes(rgyur rung ba bdun): wool (bal gos), hempen cloth (Ÿa na’i ras), Bactrian fabric (nyi’og gi gos), cotton (ras gos), linen (zar ma’i ras), quality kotamba wool (go tam ba’iras), and wool made from [the inner bark of] the dakula plant (du gu la’i ras).(Stanzas on the Discipline, f. 17a3).215. Ibid., f. 18a2.216. Ibid., f. 18a1.217. Dyes considered valuable (tshon chen brgyad) (and therefore not permis-sible): red cochineal (rgya skyegs), poppy (safflower) (le brgan rtsi), Bengal mad-der (Rubia manjith) (btsod), red sanders (Caesalpinia sappam) (rma shing rtsi), in-digo (mthing shing), vermilion (cinnabar) (mtshal), red lead (minium) (li khri),and saffron (gur gum). Permissible dyes include: blue (Delphinium cashmirianum)(sngon po), red-ochre (red chalk) (btsag), orange (ngur smrig). Shakhyaprabha statesthat “orange” refers to any orange dye extracted from leaves, flowers, or fruits.Blue can be of any type (CTHSN, f. 150a2).218. Skirt (mthang gos) refers to the lower robe or shamtap (sham thabs).219. Skirt must cover waist and knees in cross-legged position.220.SD, f. 23b6.221. Sönam Drakpa states that the consecration of cloth intended for robes orthe robes themselves (chos gos byin gyis brlab) is done in order not to incur thedownfalls of “keeping” and “retaining” and to avoid the minor fault of not con-secrating the robes. The robes are consecrated in front of a qualified fellow monkor by oneself if there is no other monk. Prescribed accessory garments that arelarger than one cubit and extra articles are to be consecrated through a three-part ritual: First, the monk offers prostrations to the fellow monk. For the mainpart, the monk recites three times the appropriate words addressed to the othermonk, thereby consecrating the cloth. To conclude, the fellow monk says, “Thatis the method!” to which the monk replies, “Excellent!”Minor garments, such as hat and belt, that are not the size of a square cubitmay be possessed after mentally examining them. Prescribed garments shouldbe considered as one’s own; extras, as belonging to others; and accessory gar-ments, as belonging in common to oneself and others.Extra garments are allowed only in certain cases, such as illness or infestationby lice (SID16, ff. 41b1-42b3).222. Under no circumstances may a monk use the leather of elephant, tiger, lion,horse, or donkey (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 102a4-5).223. According to Gunaprabha, in the first category, the five foods (bza’ ba lnga) aredough-balls (zan), cooked rice (’bras chen), light mash (lde gu), meat (sha), and pastry(khur ba); the five beverages (bca’ ba lnga) are drinks made from roots (rsta ba),"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 391stalks or trees (sdong bu), leaves (lo ma), flowers (me tog), and fruits (’bras bu).Cooked rice includes all kinds of cooked cereals. Meat and fish may be eatenfollowing the specifications given by the Buddha, which include the way themeat is acquired, the place, etc. Each of these foods denotes a whole class offoods that are included within permissible foods. However, the Buddha speci-fied certain foods not to be eaten, such as the flesh of elephant, horse, snake, fox,monkey, as well as birds who eat human flesh and worms; elephant and humanmilk should also not be drunk by monks (SD, f. 77a7-b1). Shakhyaprabha liststhe five foods as cooked barley, pastry cooked in oil, cooked rice, fish, and meat(CTHSN, f. 144a2).224. According to Sönam Drakpa, only the latter three types of foods and medi-cines are to be consecrated, provided that they belong to oneself and are permis-sible foods. Foods to be used within a day and foods and medicine to be keptuntil one is cured of an illness may be consecrated only for monks who are ill.Foods to be kept for seven days may be consecrated for the disciplinary monk,the monk managing the affairs of the monastery, or a monk who is embarkingon a journey and needs provisions. These are consecrated in the presence of aqualified monk, or if no monks are available, by the monk himself. First, he addssome permissible water to the food or medicine item. Then, if the food is thetype that is permissible for a day, the requesting monk exclaims three times, “OVenerable One, pay attention to me! Consecrate this food of mine, the monk (soand so), to be permissible within a day.” At the end, the qualified monk states,“This is the method,” to which one replies, “Excellent.” The other two types offoods are consecrated in the same way (SID16, ff. 46b1-50a1).Dharmashri states that no consecration is specified for foods permissible be-fore noon since the consecration of these foods will not prevent the downfall ofstoring them (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 104a3-4).225. Apple (ku shu), grape (rgun ’brum), and dates (’bra go).226. Buttermilk (dar ba), curd whey (zho kha chu), sour gruel of rice, etc., in astate of natural fermentation (tsab mo).227. Tsonapa says that suitable water (rung chu) is added to avoid the minorinfraction of “not adding suitable water” and to observe the rules concerningwhat is permitted to be consumed and what is not (SIRD, f. 338b6).Shakhyaprabha states that water was declared suitable to be used in foods ordrinks if ascertained to be pure in three ways: drawn from a well or spring;strained by oneself, or given by a monk who knows for certain the water hasbeen strained or by the monastic community who knows for certain; and left tosit for a day (CTHSN, f. 85b2).228. See Shakhyaprabha’s CTHSN, ff. 144b4-145a1, for details on these medicines.229. According to Sönam Drakpa, these refer to five principal herbal medicinesand five secondary ones. The five principal medicines are medicinal roots, stalks,branches, flowers, and fruits. Examples of roots include sweet flag (shu dag) andwhite aconite (bon dkar po); of stalks, sandalwood and heart-leaved moonseed"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"392 Buddhist Ethics(sle bres); of branches, malabar nut tree (ba sha ka) and Picra fel-terrae (nim pa); offlowers, Malabar nut tree, Picra fel-terrae, Schisandra sphareandra (dha ta ki, or da triga), and naga tree (klu shing); and of fruits, chebulic myrobalan (a ru ra), belericmyrobalan (ba ru ra), emblic myrobalan (skyu ru ra), black pepper (na le sham),and long pepper (pi pi ling).Examples of each of the five secondary medicines are asafoetida (shing kun),etc., potential-transforming medicines (’gyur byed), rock salt (rgyam tshwa), etc.,dung from calves fed on breast milk, etc., and toxic medicines (dug gi sman)(SID16, f. 45a2-b3).230. The three humors of Tibetan medicine: wind (anila, rlung), bile (pitta, mkhrispa), and phlegm (kapha, bad kan). The imbalance of one, two, or all three humorsis said to cause illness.231. Sönam Drakpa specifies that the infraction of cooking within the boundary(mtshams btsod kyi nyes byas) means to touch raw food with fire (to make it per-missible to cook) with the intention to cook it within the boundary of the monas-tic community or in the vicinity but in a spot other than the appropriate kitchen.The infraction of one day elapsing (zhag lon gyi nye byas) is to leave for oneday (until night) food within the boundary of the community or in the vicinitybut in a spot other than the kitchen (SID, 129a5-b3).232. The monastic kitchen is called “house that makes permissible” (rung khang)because it allows the monks to cook raw food and keep food for a day, activitiesthat would otherwise be infractions (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows,f. 105a2). The kitchen, located within the monastery or in its vicinity, must beconsecrated on four different occasions: (1) When initially laying bricks for thewalls, the monks, or the steward alone, must consecrate the kitchen by thinkingand saying: “This ground is becoming the kitchen of the monastic community.”(2) At any appropriate time during construction of the walls, a large number ofmonks consecrate the kitchen by saying: “O Venerable Ones, be in agreementthat this ground is becoming the kitchen of the monastic community.” (3) Oncethe kitchen building is completed and when one resident monk is present, thekitchen is consecrated by the monks with a two-part procedure including pro-posal. (4) The kitchen is consecrated by newly arrived monks when none of theprevious resident monks is there, by saying simultaneously: “This place is thekitchen of the monastic community” (Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, f. 300a2-b5).According to Sönam Drakpa, the space designated as the monks’ kitchen mustbe within the boundary of the monastery, the monks who together designate thespace should all have the right to use the kitchen, it should not be the temple ora house needed by the other monks, it must have a roof, and it must not havebeen designated as the kitchen before. The rite to designate the kitchen may beperformed by the monastic community as a whole or by the monk who managesthe affairs of the monastery, who does so by saying three times: “May this placebe fit for the monastic kitchen.” This constitutes the rite (SID16, ff. 50a6-52a1).233.

This implies that if the candidate is unaware that he is less than twentyduring the ordination ceremony, the ordination is valid. This ordination lasts aslong as he is not aware of what his real age was at the time of ordination.235. Atisha attributes this view to Sarvastivadin discipline masters. See Com-mentary on the Lamp for the Path (Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma’i dka’ ’grel) (Toh.3948), f. 262b6-7.236. See note 20.237. According to Pema Karpo, the Traditionalists assert that any defeating of-fense is necessarily a concealed one. Analysts state that the intention to concealis not a complementary factor to the defeat, since in the case of sexual inter-course, for example, it is impossible to experience orgasm and the intention toconceal the act simultaneously, and that after the defeat has occurred, the inten-tion to conceal it is not a complementary branch (TV, vol. Nga, ff. 48b4-49a1).238. Gunaprabha lists the five menial tasks (dman pa’i spyod pa’i lnga) as follows:in the morning, the demoted monk should rise before all other monks and openthe doors of the temple, etc.; when spiritual instructions are given, fan the othermonks; sound the gandi stick to summon the community to the assembly hall atthe appropriate times, prepare their seats, and burn incense, etc.; in the evening,wash the feet of the monks, etc.; engage continuously in wholesome activitiesand sit at the end of the row of monks.The five privileges (khyad par gyi spyod pa’i lnga) are to be honored along withone’s fellow monks; to befriend other monks, which means live in the samehouse, place one’s bedding in the same area, etc.; to bring forth an allegationabout another monk with pure status; to inflict disciplinary measures on a fel-low monk; and to travel with another monk (SD, f. 87a3-b1). Dharmashri’s Com-mentary on the Three Vows notes that only if the monk becomes a saint (arhat) mayhis original status be fully restored (f. 114b2).239.Sönam Drakpa mentions one exception: an outstanding monk who is shame-ful and who upholds and understands the discourses, the discipline, and thephenomenology classes of teachings can purify a partial defeat by just confess-ing it in front of a single monk, without having to be demoted, do appeasingservices, or be expelled from the monastery (SID16, f. 71b4-6).240. Sönam Drakpa specifies that legal procedures in cases of disagreement overformal procedures (las dbye ba’i gzhi) are applied when a group of [at least four]monks professes ideas contrary to the doctrine with the intention of performingdifferent formal procedures.Such disagreements involve the basis, intent, action, and consummation. Thebasis is a division occurring in one of the three continents (worlds) (UnpleasantSound is not included since the Buddha’s doctrine is not found there) and withinthe same monastic boundary. The number of monks within that boundary num-ber eight or more. The monks are ordinary (not exalted) and worthy to performceremonies. The monks causing the division profess ideas contrary to the disci-pline while knowing these do not conform to the monastic code."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"394 Buddhist EthicsThe intention comprises an unmistaken apprehension of the matter in ques-tion and an unabated wish to create different formal procedures based on grasp-ing to ideas contrary to the doctrine while knowing these not to conform to themonastic code.The act consists in the performance of different ceremonies.The consummation refers to the completion of the major parts of the formalprocedure (SID16, f. 79b6-80b5).Dharmashri states that the procedure for quelling such disagreement consistsin first having the monks who profess ideas contrary to the doctrine admit thatthey have incurred a downfall that has to do with creating a schism in the mo-nastic community and then applying subjugating measures, etc., that will re-move the causes of the disagreement. As an internal support for the remedialmeasures, the monks should always conform to the four duties of a monk (notto respond to being chided by chiding, etc.). As an external support, the monkswho have created the division should apologize. A ceremony to accept the apol-ogy is then performed and the monks are asked to perform a confession for thesake of harmony. Once this is done, both sides of the community perform theconfession to promote harmony (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 118a2-4).241. See note 171.242. See the comprehensive discussion on this subject in CBS, p. 125.243. See CBS, p. 126, section “Nissayakamma.”244. See CBS, p. 126. Sönam Drakpa makes the further point that if after thedisciplinary measures of censuring, surveillance, banishment, and ostracism,the monk still persists in his behavior, he must be expelled from the monastery(SID16, f. 64a1-2).245. See CBS, p. 126. This is imposed on the monk until his attitude has changed.246. See CBS, p. 127.247. The suspension from further advice (gdams ngag gzhag pa) means that thecommunity ceases trying to make the monk aware of an offense he has commit-ted. This happens after the community has brought forth the allegation, hastried to make him acknowledge his offense, etc., but the monk has refused toadmit his guilt and becomes insubordinate.248. When a layperson, without basis, accuses a monk of having committed adefeat or shows contempt toward him, the monastic community may decree thepenalty called “turning down the begging bowl” through a formal procedure. Amonk is appointed to inform the layperson of its decision. If the layperson apolo-gizes to the offended monk, the community may remove the penalty upon thelayperson’s request. If not, the penalty entails that monks do not visit or stay inthat household, do not accept offerings or beg from him or her, and do not teachthe doctrine to members of that household. Thus, the order penalizes the lay-person by not giving him the privilege of acquiring merit by giving alms to themonks. (Gunaprabha’s SD, f. 86a3 and Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 311b4-312a)."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 395249. Pema Karpo states that in this case, the monastic community asks a trust-worthy laywoman about the behavior of the monk, that is, whether he was walk-ing, standing, sitting, or lying at the secluded place. If the monk acknowledgesthis type of infraction, he is made to confess accordingly. If the monk refuses tocomply, he is subject to disciplinary measures: through a fourfold formal proce-dure, he is made to analyze the nature of his offense, which is a form of punish-ment used to humble the monk (TV, vol. Nga, f. 313a5-b1).250. Sönam Drakpa states that here basis (gzhi) refers to the actual offense (apartial defeat since a concealed defeat cannot be remedied) of which the monkrecognizes the nature without any doubt. The intent (bsam pa) means that themonk is not in a deranged state when he conceals the downfall and has an un-wavering intention not to reveal it. The act (sbyor ba) consists in not revealing theoffense and does not need to be enacted physically or verbally. The consumma-tion (mthar thug) consists in concealing it until the first moment of dawn of thenext day (SID16, f. 76a1-6).251.

For details, see Sönam Drakpa’s SID16,ff. 76b-77b6 and Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 307a3-309a4.252. Sönam Drakpa explains that the purpose of this basis is to make a monkrecollect a downfall that he previously did not recall, and once recollected, toconfess it and thus purify his morality.The allegation is brought forth by a qualified monk in private (or in the pres-ence of the whole community if the infraction was committed in its midst) whena monk exhibits degeneration in terms of his morality, view, rituals, and liveli-hood, degeneration that can be seen, heard, or suspected with an ordinary con-sciousness. The monk who brings forth the allegation should first considerwhether he himself is qualified to do so; should analyze whether the substanceof the allegation, the person toward whom it is made, and the time are appropri-ate or not; should have developed mindfulness and discriminative vigilanceand have a compassionate disposition.If the monk in question does not listen when admonished with gentle speechand in other ways, he incurs the partial defeat of defiance. If he continues in hisdefiant attitude, he is subjugated by censoring. If that does not work, he is ex-pelled from the monastery. Alternatively, the means of subjugation are used onhim from the start. If these do not work, the monk is suspended from furtheradvice, from the possibility of attending the confession, and from the lifting ofthe restrictions. If these means do not work, he is expelled from the monastery(SID16, ff. 78a6-79b5).253. Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, f. 316a1-5.254. Change in attitude occurs when the monk engaged in the dispute becomeshumble or the distinguished qualities of discriminating awareness and compas-sion arise in him (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 119b5).255. The eight types of evidence (mngon sum brgyad):(1) evidence from discussion between challenger and challenged monks(rgol phyir rgol gnyis kyis mngon sum): the members of the order reachagreement through discussion based on logic and scriptures;(2) evidence of neutral testimonies (gzu bo’i mngon sum): for example, ifthe dispute does not subside based on previous evidence, impar-tial monks (who are self-reliant in spiritual and material matters)are appointed;(3) the evidence of four monks (dge ’dun gyis bzhi po’i mngon sum): if thesecond type of evidence fails, the settling is effected by four monkswho are well-acquainted with the matter of the dispute;(4) authoritative evidence (gsal ba’i mngon sum): the last evidence failing,the task of settling the dispute is entrusted through a ceremony tofour or more learned monks whose qualities are more outstanding(gsal ba) than the previous ones;(5) a more authoritative evidence (gsal ba’i gsal ba’i mngon sum): the previ-ous evidence failing, these monks, by means of a ceremony, ap-point four other learned monks (more outstanding than the previ-ous four) to settle the dispute;"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 397(6) evidence of another monastic community (dge ’dun gzhan gyi mngonsum): the previous one failing, these last monks entrust the monkcausing the dispute to the previous four; these in turn entrust himto the four previous ones; and these, to the impartial monk origi-nally appointed to settle the dispute. This monk then entrusts thequarreling monk for three months to another section of the monas-tic community to settle the case;(7) the evidence of a master repository of the three collections of the scrip-tures (sde snod ’dzin pa’i mngon sum): the previous failing, a masterof the three collections of the scriptures who is acknowledged byall as ideal is entrusted with the monk for six months to solve thedispute;(8) evidence of a powerful elder (gnas brtan mthu dang ldan pa’i mngonsum): the last failing, the quarreling monk is returned to the impar-tial monk who entrusts him for an indefinite length of time to apowerful elder, whose word cannot be trangressed by any othermonk, for settlement of the dispute.If the eight types of evidence fail to settle the dispute, it is then settled by the“way of the majority” (gang mang gis zhi ba): sticks are distributed to determineon which side is the majority of monks; a verdict based on the opinion of themajority is then pronounced (Sönam Drakpa’s SID16, ff. 83b4-85b2). See also thediscussion in Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 316b-318b4.256. This method is applied to these three cases: (1) a dispute arising from agroundless accusation (gzhi med pa’i rtsod pa), an allegation of a downfall that themonk has not incurred; (2) a dispute based on an unrelated allegation (gzhi gzhanrjes su sgrub pa’i rtsod pa), an allegation of a downfall other than the one themonk has committed; and (3) a dispute stemming from an allegation of a down-fall that does not require confession (phyir bcos la mi ltos pa’i rtsod pa) since thedownfall has already been amended.A verdict of purity (dag pa sbyin pa) is a pronouncement by the communitythat the monk has not incurred a downfall. This verdict takes into considerationwhether or not the monk (who has been asked to recall whether he has incurreda downfall) is generally of a clear mind and good memory. If he is and he doesnot recollect having incurred the downfall, he is to be considered pure. The ver-dict consists in stating: “This monk, who has a good memory, is without faultsince he does not recall having incurred such and such a downfall.” This verdictbased on recollection (dran pas ’dul ba sbyin pa) is pronounced by the monasticcommunity in the appropriate ceremony preceded by the request made by themonk himself. In this way, disputes arising in these cases are quelled. (SönamDrakpa’s SID16, f. 85b4-6; Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 118b4-119a4).257. In the case of an allegation of a downfall committed in a state of derange-ment, the monastic community gives a “verdict based on non-derangement”(ma smyos pas ’dul ba sbyin pa). This means to pronounce in the appropriate cer-emony a verdict of purity through a four-part formal proposal, such as stating,“This monk is without fault since he did not incur the downfall in a state of"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"398 Buddhist Ethicsnon-derangement.” Thus, the allegation becomes meaningless and the disputearising from it subsides (Sönam Drakpa’s SID16, ff. 85b6-86a1).258. When a monk does not recognize the nature of his downfall (ltung ba’i ngobo ’tshol ba), the monastic community will impose on him, through a four-partformal procedure, the disciplinary measure of analyzing the nature of the down-fall in order to make him aware (SID16, f. 86a5-6).259. A dispute between two monks only, the one who brings forth the allega-tion and the accused, is pacified when the monk is made to accept the allegation(khas blangs pas zhi ba), is willing to refrain from repeating the offense in thefuture, and confesses it (Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Nga, ff. 119b1-120b5).260. A dispute that involves the entire monastic community is settled in the“manner of spreading straw” (rtsa bkram pa lta bu’i zhi ba). Pema Karpo explainsthat the monks dwelling in different places assemble in order to pacify the causeof the dispute. When they first come together, they bow in respect to each other(likened to the spreading of straw so that the tips touch reciprocally) and in thisway restore harmony in the community (TV, vol. Nga, f. 320b1). As an alterna-tive reason for the designation “manner of spreading straw,” N. Dutt notes thatas this method is used to suppress all discussion concerning the dispute, it iscomparable to covering mud with straw. “This method is adopted when there isthe likelihood that the matter of dispute, if discussed in an open assembly, willgive rise to questions that might impair the well-being of the order.” The monksprostrate to each other and then proceed to amend the downfall by ceremony;thus, the dispute is settled without discussion.

Eachof his seven heads had an ela (pomegranate) tree growing on it with thousands ofinsects swarming around. Countless flies lived on each tree and foul-smelling pusand blood oozed from his body. He prostrated to the Buddha and sat at his side.The Buddha then told his disciples that this horrible-looking creature was thereal form of the universal monarch they had envied the day before. He explainedto them that at the time of Buddha Kashyapa, this being had been a monk. Whilethis monk was living under an ela tree, one day he struck his forehead on a branch;enraged, he cut down the tree, an act that Buddha Kashyapa had prohibited; as aresult of his action, the monk was reborn as a naga.

The followers of the Buddha distinguished as four classes (’khor rnam pabzhi): monk, nun, male lay practitioner, and female lay practitioner.288. See Asanga’s CD, f. 5a2-3.289. See Asanga’s CD, f. 5a3-4.290. Five types of despair (’gyod pa) refers to five thoughts that arise when onecommits a transgression: (1) “With this kind of start, my observance will alwaysbe faulty”; (2) “The other monks and the gods will belittle me for this”; (3) “TheTeacher (Buddha) and the wise men following the pure life will surely condemnme”; (4) “From here to the border regions, I will be known as an evil-doer, and[everyone] will talk about me indecently”; (5) “With this unvirtuous beginning, Iwill be reborn in the bad destinies after leaving this body” (Asanga’s CD, f. 9a7-b).Five-limbed conscientiousness (bag yod pa’i skabs lnga/ yan lag lngas bsdus pa’ibag yod/ yan lag lnga dang ldan pa’i bag yod): conscientiousness that (1) puts anend to past transgressions; (2) puts an end to future transgressions; (3) puts anend to present transgressions; (4) learns what should be done from previousmistakes; and (5) puts all these points together and henceforth acts accordingly.Five thoughts that dispel despair (’gyod ba sel ba): (1) “The Blessed One hastaught a doctrine that has both a foundation and a way of deliverance; therefore,there surely is a means of rising up from downfalls”; (2) “Because I have not yetlearned that transgressions are committed due to ignorance, irreverence, negli-gence, and strong passions, I should understand the nature of these causes, aban-don them, and develop their opposites, knowledge...up to respect”; (3) “I nowgenerate the resolve to awaken with a sincere and noble intention so that I willnot go on failing”; (4) “I have now properly confessed my failings in the pres-ence of learned and pure persons”; (5) “I have entered the religious life and amfollowing the well-spoken teaching on discipline, and to give in to despair whenI go against its training is not proper. The Blessed One condemned the stream ofdespair by enumerating the obstructions it creates. Now, knowing that despairis the factor causing obstacles for me, it is neither right nor proper for me toindulge in it and not to rid myself of it” (Asanga’s CD, f. 9b)."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"402 Buddhist EthicsSee also Bodhibhadra’s Revelation of the Difficult Points of the Twenty Verses onthe Commitments of Awakening Mind (Bodhisattva-sa ̇varavi ̇Ÿakapañjik›; Byang chubsems dpa’i sdom pa nyi shu pa’i dka’ ’grel) (Toh. 4083), ff. 187b5-188a1.291.

Four means to prevent the occurrence of transgressions to the rules: (1) tomaintain restraint by [watching] the doors of the senses; (2) to observe modera-tion in food; (3) to persevere in meditation in the first and latter parts of thenight instead of sleeping; (4) to be mindful in one’s behavior (Asanga’s CD, f. 9a3).293. Asanga’s Compendium of Discipline lists the five factors incompatible withthe training (bslab pa dang mi mthun pa’i chos lnga): (1) to be subject to obstacles(bar du gcod pa); (2) to construct a similitude of the true teaching (dam pa’i chos ltarbcos pa); (3) to befriend evil persons (sdig pa’i grogs po); (4) to be a fool with strongpassions (glen zhing nyon mongs pa mang ba); and (5) to have a meagre accumula-tion of merits from previous lives (sngon gyi tshogs stobs chung ba).To explain: (1) to be subject to the five types of obstacles—obstacles to thepractice of higher ethics, to the practice of higher concentration, to the practiceof higher wisdom, to good destinies, to receiving offerings, to life, and to every-day activities; (2) to teach a false and mistaken doctrine and have others practiceit; (3) to have an evil friend who is heedless, whose conduct is unwholesome,and who induces one to view inferior characteristics as good qualities and vir-tues; (4) to be an inferior person and stupid fool with strong passions; (5) to beone who in past lives has not cultivated faith and other wholesome qualities,who therefore has inferior faith and so forth in the present life, and who is unableto meditate although striving to attain perfect peace in this life (CD, ff. 12a3-13a1).294. The five factors conducive to the training (bslab pa dang mthun pa’i chos lnga):(1) proper ordination (legs par mngon par ’byung ba), which means to receivemonk’s ordination with the right motivation to attain perfect peace and with thedesire to train in the proper discipline, and not to escape a debt, etc.; (2) com-plete familiarity (yongs su ’dris ba) which refers to familiarity with the scripturesthat present discourses, discipline, and phenomenology, beginning with theknowledge of what does and what does not constitute an offense and the meansto rise from transgressions to the rules; (3) examination (so sor rtog pa) during thethree periods of the day as to whether one’s observance of the rules is proper;for example, seeing that one’s observance was good in the morning, to be joyfuland to train likewise throughout the day and night; (4) meditation on the rem-edy (gnyen po sgom pa) which means not simply boasting of being moral but toactually engage in the remedy for attachment and the other passions; and (5)conviction (dad pa) that offenses will bear their results in future lives and thewish to avoid these results.Ordination is the basis for the other four. Familiarity prevents transgressions tothe rules due to ignorance. Examination prevents transgressions due to heedless-ness. Meditation on the remedy prevents transgressions due to strong passions.Conviction prevents transgressions due to irreverence (Asanga’s CD, f. 15a1-2)."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 403295. Five topics to be known (yongs su shes pa’i chos lnga): entities (dngos po),transgressions to the rules (ltung ba), types of person (gang zag), accepting ofmaterial offerings (rdzas blang ba), and causes of harm (gnod pa). These are ex-plained in the following way:(1) entities refers to the aggregates, experiential elements, experientialmedia, twelve links of interdependent arising, and proper and im-proper behavior;(2) transgressions to the rules include the cause (of a transgression, de-sire or hatred), instigation (by body, speech, or mind), the entity(an animate or inanimate object of the transgression), the deed (do-ing what is not proper or not doing what is appropriate), and con-summation (having reached the point at which the action is com-plete and irreversible);(3) types of person refers to differences among individuals in terms ofethics, social status, attainments, who is qualified to bring forth anaccusation against another monk, etc.;(4) accepting material offerings refers to rules about accepting offeringsthat are related to transgressions involving forfeiture, distributingthe articles of a monk who because of his immoral conduct hasbeen expelled in order to bring peace to the community, etc.;(5) causes of harm in this life means to worry that after death others willinflict injury of various forms on oneself; to strive greatly for life’snecessities out of avarice and not true need; to engage in means oflivelihood that involve mortification of the body, such as cutting offone’s limbs (in order to beg); to engage in actions that injure the body,such as starving one’s body, putting oneself into fire, or jumpingoff cliffs, believing that one will attain higher rebirths as a result;self-mortification with the intention of realizing the ultimate, not know-ing the right path to such realization (Asanga’s CD, ff. 18b4-21a6).296. Five factors that foster peace (nye bar zhi ba’i chos lnga): (1) peace by associat-ing [with others] in a gentle way (des shing ’grogs na bde ba nyid); (2) abandon-ment (meditation) (spong ba); (3) branches of abandonment (spong ba’i yan lag);(4) veneration (bsnyen bkur); and (5) settling quarrels (rtsod pa).

Five qualities of a monk who is faithful to his discipline (dge slong ’dul ba’ibslab pa la brtson pa’i chos lnga): (1) perfect morality (tshul khrims phun sum tshogspa), (2) perfect view (lta ba phun sum tshogs pa), (3) perfect activities (cho ga phunsum tshogs pa), (4) perfect livelihood (’tsho ba phun sum tshogs pa), and (5) free-dom from quarrels and disputes (phan tshun ’thab pa dang rtsod pa med pa).These are explained in the following way: (1) having neither a weak disci-pline nor an overly strict one, etc.; (2) elimination of the view that holds perish-able aggregates to be the self, the views that hold to the extremes (of eternalismor nihilism), and wayward views (denying causality, etc.); and not holding theseerroneous views as supreme, or perverse ethics and modes of conduct as supe-rior; (3) expertise in everyday activities, in wholesome activities, and in modesof conduct that do not contradict worldly customs or the monastic discipline,etc.; (4) freedom from illicit forms of livelihood; and (5) avoidance of quarrelsand disputes motivated by anger, grudges, etc. (Asanga’s CD, f. 21a6-b).298.

In the following pages, Kongtrul makes an extremely brief summary of thelast sixty-eight folios (from f. 127b5 to f. 195) of Asanga’s Proclaimer’s Stages whichmasterfully discusses mental quiescence and insight and their application inattaining awakening. A comprehensive commentary on this summary is beyondthe scope of this translation; however, a few notes of explanation will be pro-vided to clarify the general meaning.300. Latent emotions (nyon mongs pa’i bag la nyal): subtle forms of emotions thatare not yet manifest and their seeds.301. The practitioner, motivated to accomplish his goal, respectfully approachesa master to request instruction. A preceptor, tutor, spiritual master, or any expe-rienced meditator may act as his spiritual advisor. The practitioner requests in-struction, whereupon the master inquires about his true motivation and encour-ages him in his quest by explaining the benefits of dedicating oneself to a life ofmeditation.Following this, the master asks the beginner the following questions concernedwith the four requirements: (1) Have you the desire to follow a non-Buddhistteacher or another object of worship other than the Buddha, his teaching, andhis community? (2) Have you maintained pure ethics and have you the correct"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 405view needed to engage in the meditation for the sake of attaining liberation? (3)Have you heard and retained much or little of the discourses that expound thefour truths and their distinctions, etc.? (4) Have you become a renunciate withan earnest interest in attaining perfect peace and transcending suffering?If the beginner answers these in a way that shows his aptitude, the masterproceeds in examining the four causes or conditions: aspiration, family, capa-bilities, and tendencies. To examine his aspiration, the following questions areasked: “To which way do you aspire? To the way of the proclaimers, the way ofthe solitary sages, or the Universal Way?”Following this, questions are asked concerning his family or affinity, capa-bilities, and tendencies. If the beginner is intelligent, he will understand thequestions and will answer in the correct way. If he is dull, he will not under-stand well what is being asked and his answers will reflect this. Then, the teacherwill ascertain his affinity in this manner: using clear, connected, various, pleas-ant, and earnest words, the teacher will give a discourse on the proclaimers’way. If the beginner possesses affinity for the proclaimers’ way, he will be over-joyed to hear about it and will show great interest. Similarly, he might showaffinity for the way of the solitary sages. If he has an affinity for the UniversalWay, upon hearing discourses on that way, he will be overjoyed and have sin-cere interest in it, and will not show any affinity for the ways of the proclaimersor the solitary sages.Likewise, the teacher tests the capabilities of the beginner by teaching first aneasy topic, a medium, and then a profound one. He determines whether themonk is dull, middling, or sharp based on his comprehension, retention, andanalytic ability.The master then tests his tendencies: If the beginner ’s strongest emotion isattachment, when he hears teaching on faith, he will feel great inclination andhis mind will become smooth. If he tends toward anger, he will not like theteaching. If he tends toward ignorance, when he hears a discourse on the tran-scendence of suffering and the elimination of material things, he will becomeafraid. If he tends toward jealousy, he will not listen to the teacher’s discoursewith respect (Asanga’s PS, ff. 127b6-129b6).302. Asanga explains that maintaining and creating the conditions for contem-plation (ting nge ’dzin gyi tshogs bsrung zhing bsags pa) means to be endowed withthe ethical vows not to give up the effort to maintain conscientiousness, to prac-tice the points of training in order to bring them to fulfillment, and not to allowthe ethics taught by the Buddha to degenerate. This implies not to regress fromthe path of training in the perfect morality that one has acquired, to attain thepath of training that one has not yet attained, to restrain the doors of the sensesin accordance with the ethical vows, to be moderate in one’s eating, to exertoneself in one’s training by renouncing sleep during the latter part of the firstand last parts of the night, to be mindful in behaviors, etc. (PS, ff. 130a5-139b3).303. Perfect seclusion (rab tu dben pa) has three aspects: most appropriate place"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"406 Buddhist Ethics(gnas phun sum tshogs pa), most appropriate behavior (spyod lam phun sum tshogspa), and most appropriate seclusion (dben pa phun sum tshogs pa). The first refersto an appropriate place for meditation in an isolated environment, be it at thefoot of a tree, a charnel ground, a cave, a grass hut, etc. The place should possessthe five characteristics of being pleasant, with mild climatic conditions, free fromcauses for fear, convenient with regard to life’s necessities, and in close proxim-ity to spiritual advisors.The second refers to practicing meditation during the day and during thefirst part of the night, sleeping during the middle part of the night, and risingearly during the latter part of the night; to sit crossed-legged on the type of bedor seat permitted by the Buddha, in other words, to follow the example of theBuddha and his disciples in not undergoing the austerities of non-Buddhists,but to sit straight in a natural way, without contrived attitude, avoiding foggi-ness and sleepiness, mindful and free of distractions.The third, most appropriate seclusion, refers to physical and mental seclu-sion. Physical seclusion (for renunciates) means not staying with laypeople.Mental seclusion means that one eliminates sources for negative emotions, for-sakes neutral activities, and engages in meditative absorption on a worthy ob-ject, which is attentive meditation derived from the conditions conducive to con-templation (PS, ff. 130b3-131b).304. Intense concentration (sems rtse gcig pa): concentration or a one-pointed vir-tuous mind refers to a stream of consciousness that possesses continuous mind-fulness, a concordant focus of meditation, and a steady focusing on it. This con-centration lacks unwholesome factors and is joyful.Such concentration is twofold, pertaining to mental quiescence and insight.The first consists of the nine methods of mental quiescence (setting the mind) (seenote 312); the second, to the four aspects of insight (see note 313) (PS, f. 132a3-b6).305. Removing impediments (sgrib pa rnam par sbyong ba) means to apply remediesto the four impediments, with the recognition of their nature, causes, and faults.The four impediments are distress, obstacles, conceptions, and pride. Distressdenotes states of mind such as exhilaration, mental distress, disturbance, a pol-luted desire to pursue meditation or a dislike for it. Obstacles consist of the fivekinds of desires, the longing for objects of desire, etc. Conceptions denotes alltainted thoughts such as desire. Pride is feeling satisfied with just a little wisdomor vision, thinking that one has attained a definite level above that of others.The causes of distress are linked to the actions of previous lives, a weak physicalconstitution due to illness, excessive exertion, mistaken exertion, unexperiencedexertion, emotionality, and not being accustomed to meditation. The cause thatcreates obstacles, conceptions, and pride is a continuous misapprehension ofthe factors that lead to these. Misapprehension results from not contemplating“ugliness” and thus becoming drawn to beauty, not developing loving-kindnessand thus being subject to anger, not nurturing clarity and thus being subject toobscurity, and not engaging in mental quiescence and thus having restlessthoughts.As a consequence of these states of mind, one’s yogic practice weakens, oneremains ignorant of what one ought to know, loses the knowledge one has,"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 407remains entangled in emotions and suffering, demeans oneself and is degradedby others, and experiences a life in hell after dying.The remedy to distress is mindfulness which uplifts the mind and removesdiscouragement. Distress caused by a weak constitution is removed by adjust-ing one’s effort so that it is not too strenuous, and mistaken effort is remedied byhaving respect. Distress caused by emotionality is remedied by training in medi-tation on ugliness and other focuses. Not being accustomed to meditation isresolved by understanding the need to practice meditation and encouragingoneself to become familiar with meditation.The remedy for the remaining impediments is to correct one’s wrong think-ing and engagement (Asanga’s PS, ff. 146b3-147b4).306. The characteristics of mentally oriented contemplation (yid la byed pa bsgompa) are subsumed under single-pointed concentration, forsaking the mistakenapproach in removing impediments, and training in the perfect practice. For abeginner, the contemplation entails striving to attain joy in concentration of mindand in the work of abandonment through four types of mental contemplation,beginning with ever-present distress (see note 314) (PS, f. 149a2-3).307. Grossness (rags pa) and peacefulness (zhi ba). After achieving quiescence(which is the preparation for the first concentration and also considered a kindof beginner’s contemplation) (yid la byed pa las dang po ba), in order to becomefree of the desires characteristic of the desire realm, the meditator initially viewsthe desire realm as gross and the first concentration of the form realm as peace-ful. To view the desire realm as gross means that one contemplates the faults ofthe environment and the beings of that realm. To view the first concentration aspeaceful means that one views it as lacking the faults of the desire realm (fo-cusing, for example, on the fact that beings in the first concentration are peace-ful, lack belligerence, have shame, have less suffering, and live in inestimablemansions, etc.).To effect freedom from the desires of the desire realm, the meditator first en-gages in “mental contemplation based on appreciation,” derived mainly fromlearning and reflection. Subsequently, the “mental contemplation of thoroughisolation” (so called because the yogi is for the first time separated from themajor emotions related to the desire realm) is applied. Then one engages in the“mental contemplation of analysis” (to determine whether or not one still has toforsake emotions related to this realm); lastly, one applies the “contemplation ofthe final training” (when one attains the uninterrupted path of stopping theobscuring emotions with regard to the desire realm) and subsequently attainsthe result of the final training, the first concentration, in which the emotionsrelated to the desire realm are temporarily suppressed.To become free from the attachment to the remaining concentrations withinconditioned existence, the same contemplation process is repeated with respectto the second, third, and the other higher states of concentration up to the peakof existence.Generally speaking, having attained mental quiescence and insight, a practi-tioner has two choices: to use these attainments in order to advance to a higherstate of existence or to use them to escape conditioned existence. If one chooses"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"408 Buddhist Ethicsto attain liberation, one will do so by uprooting the emotions. One will not ana-lyze the faults of the desire realm, and so forth, by discriminating the aspects ofgrossness and peacefulness. Instead, one will practice the five contemplationsjust mentioned, switching their focus to the aspects of the four noble truths,impermanence, and so forth.For an elaborate discussion of these points, see Lati Rinbochay et al., Medita-tive States in Tibetan Buddhism (London: Wisdom Publications, 1983).308. Worldly paths (’jig rten pa’i lam): paths that lead to the attainment of higherstatus within conditioned existence. To be free from desires with respect to theworldly paths means to have temporarily suppressed the manifest emotionsrelated to these states of existence.309. See note 181.310. The eight stages of the proclaimers (nyan thos kyi sa brgyad) are as follows:(1) the stage of full positive sight (dkar po rnam par mthong ba’i sa), whichcorresponds to the path of preparation of the proclaimers, so calledbecause it is a virtue conducive to liberation. “Positive” refers toliberation, and since the focus of this level is the seeking of libera-tion, it is virtue;(2) the stage of the affinity (rigs kyi sa) that corresponds to the acceptanceand highest quality stage of the proclaimers’ path of preparation,so called because at that level the practitioner cannot change hisaffinity to become a solitary sage or a bodhisattva;(3) the stage of the eighth (brgyad pa’i sa), when the practitioner becomesa stream-enterer (see note 184) (eighth when counting the level ofabider in the result of the arhat state as the first level);(4) the stage of seeing (mthong ba’i sa) in which the practitioner abides inthe result of the stream-enterer, so called because the practitioneracquires a direct understanding of all aspects of the four truths (seenote 315);(5) the stage of the subtle (srab pa’i sa), when the practitioner has elimi-nated most, but not all, of the emotions related to the desire realmso that he will be born again once (in the desire realm); thus, he orshe is called a once-returner;(6) the stage free of attachment (’dod chags dang bral ba’i sa), when thepractitioner has eliminated all kinds of attachment pertaining tothe desire realm and will not be born again in it; thus, he is called anon-returner;(7) the stage of actualization of the deed (byas pa rtogs pa’i sa) that corre-sponds to the attainment of the goal of the arhat, the path of directrealization of the four truths, and liberation;(8) the level of the proclaimer (nyan thos kyi sa), not a level separate fromthe above seven, but the basis for their differentiation.See Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, Book IX, pp. 493-494.311. See note 182."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter II 409312. Four mental contemplations (yid la byed pa bzhi) of quiescence: (1) forcibleengagement (bsgrims te ’jug pa’i yid byed); (2) interrupted engagement (chad cing’jug pa’i yid byed); (3) uninterrupted engagement (chad par med pa ’jug pa’i yidbyed); and (4) effortless engagement (rtsol ba med par ’jug pa’i yid byed).The first contemplation is applied to the initial two stages of achieving mentalquiescence: setting and continuous setting of the mind. The second contempla-tion is applied to the next five stages of achieving mental quiescence: resetting themind, close setting, disciplining, pacifying, and thoroughly pacifying. The thirdcontemplation is applied to the stage called single-pointed setting. The fourth con-templation is applied to the stage called setting in equipoise (PS, f. 131b1).Concerning the nine methods in achieving mental quiescence (setting themind) (sems gnas pa’i thabs dgu), Asanga states: (1) Setting the mind (’jog pa) de-notes the initial meditative stabilization that frees the mind from distractions bywithdrawing it from all external objects and focusing it on an internal object. (2)Continuous setting of the mind (yang dag par ’jog pa) is a meditative stabilizationthat cuts through the oscillation, coarseness, and movements of the mind byresetting it on the same focus and by making it clearer, thus making the mindmore subtle and undistracted. (3) Resetting the mind (bsdus te ’jog pa) is a medi-tative stabilization that draws back the mind which due to forgetfulness has leftits settled state and become distracted by an outer object. (4) Close setting (nyebar ’jog pa) is a meditative stabilization that causes the mind to remain on itsobject once set on it so that the mind does not project outwardly in spite of sub-sequent influences. (5) Disciplining (’dul bar byed pa) denotes a meditative sta-bilization so that when the mind becomes distracted by the perception of a form,sound, etc., or by thoughts of desire, hatred, or stupidity, it is held right from theoutset with the awareness of the faults of such objects, not projecting to theseobjects. (6) Pacifying (zhi bar byed pa) is a mental stabilization so that when themind is disturbed by thoughts or emotions, such as longing for the objects ofone’s desires, the mind is held from the outset by the awareness of their faultsand does not follow these emotions. (7) Thoroughly pacifying (nye bar zhi barbyed pa) is a meditative stability so that when due to forgetfulness, thoughtsrelated to outer objects and disturbing emotions arise, the mind is aware of theirbeing sources of suffering and eliminates them. (8) Single-pointed setting (rgyudgcig tu byed pa) is a meditative stabilization that is free from interruptions and setcontinuously in a state of concentration. (9) Setting in equipoise (ting nge ’dzindu byed pa) denotes a meditative stabilization in which the mind enters sponta-neously an undistracted state of concentration free from mental activity as aresult of the habituation of repeated concentration. (PS, f. 132b3) See also Hopkins’ME, pp. 80-86 and Lati Rinpochay’s Meditative States, pp. 58-72.313. Four mental contemplations of insight: analysis of phenomena (chos rnamsrnam par ’byed pa), clear analysis (rab tu rnam par ’byed pa), thorough examination(yongs su rtog pa), and thorough investigation (yongs su dpyod pa). These fouranalyses comprise rough and subtle discrimination of the phenomenal andnoumenal aspects of the five aggregates and other subjects.Insight is explained as having three approaches and focusing on six differentaspects. The three approaches are insight that simply engages in its object"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"410 Buddhist Ethicswithout reflection, examination, or ascertainment; insight that engages in seek-ing, i.e., reflection, examination, and ascertainment; and insight that engages indiscriminative examination of the object sought in such ways [the object herebeing selflessness].The six aspects that are investigated in insight meditation are meaning (don),entity (dngos po), characteristics (mtshan nyid), class (phyogs), time (dus), and rea-sonings (rigs pa). The first involves recognition of the given meaning of an in-struction; the second, discrimination as to whether an external or internal entityis meant; the third, determining particular and general characteristics; the fourth,determining its virtuous or unvirtuous nature by examining faults and quali-ties; the fifth, determining the occurrence of something in the past, present, orfuture; and the sixth, investigation of the object using four types of reasoning:reasoning of dependence (ltos pa’i rigs pa) (the cause); reasoning of functionality(bya ba byed pa’i rigs pa); validity (’thad sgrub kyi rigs pa); and nature (chos nyid kyirigs pa). (Asanga’s PS, ff. 134a1-142a6) See also Lati Rinpochay’s Meditative States,pp. 155-156.314. Four mental contemplations: ever-present distress (sems kun du gdung bar ’gyurba’i yid la byed pa), moistened mind (sems mngon par brlon par ’gyur ba’i yid la byed pa),giving ease (shin tu sbyangs ba skyed pa’i yid la byed pa), and purifying pristine aware-ness and vision (ye shes dang mthong ba rnam par sbyong ba’i yid la byed pa).(1) Ever-present distress is a mental contemplation that turns the meditatoraway from things that are distressful or conducive to distress (what is taintedand its related factors, wealth, friends, etc.). (2) Moistened mind is a mental con-templation that causes joy in things that are joyful or conducive to joy (the ThreeJewels, the basis of the training, one’s own fortunate condition, etc.). (3) Givingease is a mental contemplation that at the right time turns one away from thingsthat are distressful or conducive to distress and causes one to take joy in thingsthat are joyful or conducive to joy. It thereby pacifies the mind inwardly andplaces it in a meditative stability of single-pointed awareness in which there areno attributes (to apprehend) and no conceptions. These causes and conditionsproduce satisfaction of body and mind, and ease of body and of mind, which areremedies for physical and mental unworkability.With ever-present distress, the mind turns away from what is tainted andrelated factors. With the mind moistened with joy, one is attracted to renuncia-tion, seclusion, and the meditation practice. With the mental engagement thatgives ease, the mind settles into a state of quiescence. With the mental engage-ment that purifies wisdom and vision, one applies the four kinds of analysis ofphenomena. (Asanga’s PS, ff. 149a3-151a6).315.

See Hopkins’ ME, pp. 94-95.319. Asanga states that the mental contemplation of thorough isolation refers tothe mental engagement that possesses the perfect path able to remove the emo-tions, from the initial direct perception of truth up to the abandonment of thefactors to be forsaken on the path of seeing (PS, f. 191b3-4).320.

(Asanga’s PS, ff. 192b1-193a2) See also Hopkins’ ME, pp. 104-108.323. Asanga explains that the attainment of adamantine contemplation (rdo rjelta bu’i ting nge ’dzin) indicates that all impediments to awakening will be over-come. Just as the diamond is the finest of all precious stones, being harder thanpearl, lapis lazuli, coral, etc., and able to cut through others while being itselfindestructible, the adamantine contemplation is the best of all meditative ab-sorptions in that it outshines all emotions and is not conquered by them (PS,f. 193a6-b1).324. See note 184. See also Hopkins’ ME, pp. 106-108.Chapter III: The Commitments of Awakening Mind1. Asanga’s Stages of the Bodhisattva (henceforth cited as SB) (BodhisattvabhÒmi;Byang chub sems dpa’i sa) (Toh. 4037), f. 9a3-5.2. Asanga states that the perfect affinity (rigs phun sum tshogs pa) refers to anaffinity for the Universal Way. This affinity is called tath›gatagarbha or buddha-nature and in higher Buddhist philosophical and meditational systems is said toexist in every sentient being regardless of his or her status or form of life. Suchbuddha-nature has two aspects, intrinsic (prak ̧tistha, rang bzhin gyis gnas pa’irigs) and evolved (samud›nıta, yang dag par bsgrubs pa’i rigs). The first has existedsince time without beginning by virtue of the very nature of things (dharmat›-pratilabdha, chos nyid kyis thob pa); the second is gained as a result of having cul-tivated what is wholesome in previous lives. The affinity referred to here is theone gained by virtue of the very nature of things (SB, f. 2b4).3. The two aspects of relative awakening mind: the aspiration to awaken andventuring on the path to awakening.4.Mah›y›nasÒtr›la ̇k›rak›rik›; Theg pa chen po’i mdo sde’i rgyan zhes bya ba’i tshigle’ur byas pa (Toh. 4020), f. 4b5-6.5. Sthiramati specifies that awakening mind is formed by this factor when thestudent repeats after the preceptor the appropriate formula for its generationafter having understood the significance, benefits, etc., of awakening mind itselfas have been explained by the preceptor or master. Such an awakening mind isreferred to as a “sacred mind conceived from words.” (Commentary on the Scripture"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 413Ornament [SÒtr›la ̇k›rav ̧ttibh› ̋ya; mDo sde rgyan gyi ’grel bshad] [henceforth citedas CSO] [Toh. 4034], vol. Mi, ff. 54b2-55a2.)6. Vasubandhu states that awakened affinity refers to an affinity for the UniversalWay that has awakened from a latent state and become manifest as a person’sperceivable qualities. These qualities include spontaneous compassion; interest inthe Universal Way; ability to withstand hardships [for others’ sake]; and virtuousengagement in the six perfections. (Explanation of the Scripture Ornament [SÒtr›-la ̇k›ravy›khy›; mDo sde’i rgyan gyi bshad pa] [henceforth cited as ESO] [Toh. 4026],f. 137b4.) Sthiramati states that a mind of awakening may be formed simply throughthe force of one’s affinity for the bodhisattva path (CSO, vol. Mi, f. 54b3).7. Vasubandhu explains that a root of virtue is nurtured as a result of the evolu-tion of one’s affinity for the Universal Way (ESO, f. 140a1).8. To hear expositions on various subjects of the Buddhist teachings over andover again (Vasubandhu’s ESO, f. 140a1). Sthiramati points out that an awaken-ing mind may be formed in this life by having cultivated wisdom in previouslives through hearing, pondering, and making a living experience of the teach-ings of the Universal Way. For example, a multitude of humans and gods (deva)generated awakening mind upon hearing the discourse of the Buddha that laterbecome known as the Scripture Ornament, because of having listened to the teach-ings in their previous lives (CSO, vol. Mi, f. 54b4-5).9. Vasubandhu explains that familiarization means to hear repeatedly the Bud-dhist teachings, retain their meaning, and preserve them as an experiential un-derstanding throughout one’s life (ESO, f. 140a2). Similarly, Sthiramati statesthat an awakening mind can be formed through the strength of familiarity withthe Buddhist teachings by listening to expositions given by many spiritual guidesand gaining true understanding of them (CSO, vol. Mi, f. 54b6).10. Here, Kongtrul has chosen to present the factors that contribute to the for-mation of an awakening mind as they are stated in the Scripture Ornament ratherthan in Asanga’s Stages of the Bodhisattva. The following is a summary of the fourfactors according to Asanga: (1) Witnessing or hearing about the miracles andpowers of the Buddha or of bodhisattvas will generate an earnest interest in thestate of enlightenment; based on that, one will make the resolve to awaken. (2)Even if one has not witnessed or heard of these miracles and powers, by study-ing the collections of the scriptures on the bodhisattva’s path that explain thenature of full enlightenment, one will be inspired to attain the pristine aware-ness of a buddha, and on that basis, one will make the resolve to awaken. (3)Even if one has not studied these scriptures in depth, seeing the approachingdecline of the teachings on the bodhisattva’s path, one realizes that their preser-vation would relieve numberless beings from their misery and thereby decidesto work so that these teachings may last for a long time. This results in apprecia-tion of the pristine awareness of enlightenment, and on that basis, one will makethe resolve to awaken. (4) Even if one does not understand that the bodhisattvateachings are on the verge of declining, one certainly sees that these are degen-erate times in which beings are tormented by their emotions. Thus, one realizes"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"414 Buddhist Ethicsthat the resolve to attain the goal of the proclaimers and solitary sages is a diffi-cult one to make; how much more so is the resolve to attain the goal of thebodhisattvas.

Abhayakara (Abhay›kara, ’Jigs pa’i ’byung gnas): foremost master amongthe Universal Way succession of teachers at Vikramashila Monastery. He livedduring the period of King Ramapala and is said to be the last undisputed IndianBuddhist scholar of both sutra and tantra.16. Smritijnana (Sm ̧tijñ›na, Dran pa’i ye shes): an Indian scholar who traveled toeastern Tibet where he taught extensively, helped in the translation of the newtantras, and wrote commentaries such as his commentary on Chanting the Namesof Manjushri (MañjuŸrın›masa ̇gıti).

For the life of Atisha, seeAlaka Chattopadhyaya’s study, AtıŸa and Tibet (Calcutta, 1967).20. Irreversible (phyir mi ldog pa) refers to the awakening mind of a bodhisattvaat the stage of acceptance of the path of preparation, at which stage there is noturning back to the path of the Individual Way.21. The five early masters of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism: Sachen KungaNyingpo (Kun dga’ snying po) (1102-1158), Sönam Tsemo (bSod nams rtsed mo)(1142-1182), Drakpa Gyaltsen (Grags pa rgyal mtshan) (1147-1216), Sakya PanditaKunga Gyaltsen (Kun dga’ rgyal mtshan) (1182-1251), and Chögyal Pakpa (Chosrgyal ’phags pa) (1235-1280). These words, which Sakya Pandita attributes to theoral teachings of his master (most probably Drakpa Gyaltsen), are found in theRite for the Formation of the Awakening Mind according to the Centrist System (dBu malugs kyi sems bskyed kyi cho ga) in the Collected Works of Sakya Pandita (Beijing: Bodljongs bdo yig dpe rnying dpe bskrun khang, 1992), vol. II, p. 547.22. The first aspect refers to a beginner ’s aspiring mind; the second, to the aspir-ing mind formed in a ritual; and the third, to preserving the purity of the aspir-ing mind. The same applies to the three aspects of the venturing mind (H.H.Sakya Trizin, oral communication).23. The actual title of Shantipa’s work is Commentary on the Mandala Rite ofGuhyasamaja (Guhyasam›jama ̊ ̃alavidhi ̨ık›; gSang ba ’dus pa’i dkyil ’khor gyi cho ga’i’grel pa/ Zhi brgya lnga bcu pa’i ’grel pa) (Toh. 1871). The citation is found on f. 69b1.24. An approximate awakening mind is imputed or formed through indicationsor words (brdar btags pa/ rda las ’byung ba), while the subtle one corresponds tothe ultimate (don dam pa) awakening mind. “Formed through indications orwords” refers to the aspiration to awaken in order to put an end to the sufferingof all beings. Because it is first hinted at or suggested by the words of a spiritualmaster, such an aspiration is said to “arise from indications.” Ultimate awaken-ing mind is formed through the force of this aspiration for enlightenment; it isnon-conceptual pristine awareness free from all mental fabrications, its focusbeing the selflessness of all phenomena (Shantipa’s Commentary on the MandalaRite of Guhyasamaja, ff. 68b1-69a6).The awakening mind hinted at by others is formed by repeating after a mas-ter the formula for its generation (Ashvabhava’s Commentary on the ScriptureOrnament [Mah›y›nasÒtrala ̇k›ra ̨ık›; Theg pa chen po’i mdo sde’i rgyan gyi rgyacher ’grel pa] [Toh. 4029], f. 54a1). The ultimate awakening mind arises throughthe cultivation of merit and pristine awareness (Dharmashri’s Commentary onthe Three Vows [sDom ’grel/ sDom pa gsum rnam par nges pa’i ’grel pa legs bshad ngomtshar dpag bsam gyi snye ma] [Chorten Monastery edition, published at Deorali,Gangtok, Sikkim, by Dodrup Chen Rinpoché], f. 34a5).25. f. 4b2-3.26. Appreciation (mos pa) is based on the confidence one has in the profound andmagnificent subjects of the Universal Way (in particular, the subject of emptiness),but not on the direct realization of these subjects (Sthiramati’s CSO, vol. Mi, f. 52a7)."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"416 Buddhist Ethics27. The seven impure stages (sapt›ŸuddhabhÒmi, ma dag pa’i sa bdun) are the firstseven stages of awakening. They are called impure because on these stagesbodhisattvas have not yet purified a subtle form of pride. This pride is eventu-ally purified in the last three stages of awakening, which are therefore called thethree pure stages (tri viŸuddhibhÒmi, dag pa’i sa gsum).According to Sthiramati, extraordinary intention (lhag pa’i bsam pa) denotesthe mind that perceives the equality of oneself and others, which enables thebodhisattva to work for his or her own and others’ welfare. Such intention ispure (dag pa) in that it is unpolluted by grasping to the reality of apprehended(objects) and the apprehending (mind) (CSO, vol. Mi, f. 52b1-2).28. The awakening mind on the eighth, ninth, and tenth stages of the bodhisattvapath is said to be mature because on these stages, non-conceptual pristine aware-ness is spontaneously present, and as a result, the bodhisattva engages effort-lessly in generosity and the other perfections (CSO, vol. Mi, f. 52b3-4).29. The first kind of awakening mind arises from its causes; the second, frompristine awareness; the third, from the elimination of what is to be forsaken onthe path; and the fourth, from the realization of the goal, enlightenment (CSO,vol. Mi, f. 52b6-7).30. f. 2b5-6.31. Reading glu for klu.32.

See sectionbelow entitled “The Six Perfections in Detail.”38. Ten stages (daŸabhÒmi, sa bcu) of the enhanced realization of a bodhisattva,starting from the attainment of the path of seeing up to the final awakening: Joyful(pramudit›, rab tu dga’ ba), Stainless (vimal›, dri ma med pa), Illuminating (prabh›karı,’od byed pa), Radiant (arci ̋matı, ’od phro ba), Difficult to Conquer (sudurjay›, shin tusbyang dka’ ba), Approaching (abhimukhı, mngon du gyur ba), Gone Far (dÒra ̊gama,ring du song ba), Unshakable (acal›, mi g.yo ba), Good Discrimination (s›dhumatı,legs pa’i blo gros), and Cloud of the Teachings (dharma-megh›, chos kyi sprin).

Saint (arhat, dgra bcom pa): one who has fully overcome the emotions, moreoften used to denote the goal of the Individualists, here equivalent to the state ofa buddha. The most common Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit term is dgrabcom pa (one who has defeated the enemy [of the disturbing emotions]). An-other translation of arhat is mchod par ’os pa (one worthy of veneration), usedsparingly by Tibetan translators.41. The correspondence between each simile and awakening mind is explainedin different ways by the commentators on the Ornament of Realizations.Vimuktasena, citing extensively the Buddha’s discourses, states:(1) The awakening mind of a beginner bodhisattva accompanied by ear-nest interest is like the earth in that it serves as the foundation forthe attainment of the Buddha’s qualities.(2) Awakening mind accompanied by intention, like beautiful gold, isthe wish to help and make others happy through the practice of thesix perfections, a wish that remains unchanged until the bodhi-sattva’s goal is reached.(3) Awakening mind accompanied by superior determination, like thewaxing moon, is a strong intention to enhance wholesome quali-ties to their fullest.(4) Awakening mind accompanied by application, like fire, enhances theapplication of the three knowledges—of the foundation (gzhi shes)[the Individual Way’s understanding of the selflessness of phenom-ena], of the path (lam shes) [the knowledge directed to the actual-ization of the “perfect end” of emptiness], and the knowledge ofall aspects (rnam mkhyen) [the final knowledge that directly com-prehends in an instant reality as it is and as it manifests]."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"418 Buddhist Ethics(5) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of generosity, like agreat treasure, satisfies countless beings through the gift of the teach-ings and material things.(6) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of ethics, like a jewelmine, is a source of limitless good qualities.(7) Awakening mind accompanied by patience, like an ocean, is neverdisturbed by the experience of many difficulties.(8) Awakening mind accompanied by effort, like a diamond, is a firm,undivided mind.(9) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of meditation, likethe king of mountains, is unperturbed by distractions.(10) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of wisdom, like amedicine, eliminates all illnesses of emotions and impediments tothe attainment of omniscience.(11) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of skillful means,like a spiritual friend, at no time neglects others’ welfare.(12) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of aspiration, like awish-fulfilling gem, accomplishes whatever it aspires to.(13) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of strength, like thesun, brings practitioners to spiritual maturity.(14) Awakening mind accompanied by the perfection of pristine aware-ness, like a beautiful song, reveals itself to inspire practitioners.(15) Awakening mind accompanied by clairvoyance, like a king, accom-plishes the welfare of others with unobstructed power.(16) Awakening mind accompanied by merit and pristine awareness, likea storehouse, accommodates all merit and pristine awareness.(17) Awakening mind accompanied by the factors conducive to awaken-ing, like a highway, is traversed by the exalted ones, one after theother.(18) Awakening mind accompanied by the union of mental quiescence andinsight, like a conveyance, carries one easily, never leaving one incyclic existence or in static peace.(19) Awakening mind accompanied by memory and eloquence, like wa-ter from a spring, contains and gives forth unceasingly the teach-ings retained in the minds of bodhisattvas.(20) Awakening mind accompanied by the feast of the teachings, like amelodious sound, proclaims the four seals—impermanence, suf-fering, selflessness, and peace—to practitioners who aspire to lib-eration.

Nagarjuna (N›g›rjuna, Klu sgrub): born in southern India in a Brahmin fam-ily, became the pioneer of the Centrist system of philosophy and one of the fore-most proponents of the Universal Way. He is said to have been called Nagarjuna(“One who has achieved his goal with the aid of nagas”) because nagas pre-sented him with the large Transcendent Wisdom Scripture and other scripturesthat were hidden in their world.Asanga (Asaºga, Thogs med), tutored as a young child in fine arts, grammar,medicine, and debate by his own mother in Peshawar, became a great Buddhistmonk and scholar. However, still unable to fathom the message of the Transcen-dent Wisdom scriptures, he devoted himself to Maitreya as his tutelary deity. Af-ter a meditation trial that lasted twelve years, legend says that he was taken byMaitreya to the pure land of Tushita, where he listened extensively to the teach-ings. Upon his return to the earth, he gathered the fruits of his studies into theFive Works of Maitreya. He become the second father (after Nagarjuna) of theUniversal Way by pioneering the Idealist system of philosophy.45.

A person of highest capability should shun all eighteen root downfalls. Prac-titioners of average or inferior capabilities should safeguard those precepts ofthe awakening mind that accord with their capacities.

If one has incurred a root downfall, one should first wash oneself, clean one’sdwelling, and light incense, and then call the bodhisattva Akashagarbha by name,offer prostrations, and supplicate him to purify one.

Great Fortunate One, as youappear each day in the world, protect me with your kindness.

Krishna states that an inferior practitioner, because of grasping to reality,must confess the downfall in front of another person while expressing regret.The individual can then rise from the downfall after a considerable time bymaking the promise not to repeat it in the future. The middling practitioner risesfrom a downfall by receiving pardon from Akashagarbha or another deity of theawareness mantra after having pleased him. The superior practitioner (dam pa)needs only the understanding that the transgression itself is [of the same natureas ultimate] awakening mind, as stated in the Scripture that Demonstrates the Non-Origination of All Phenomena: “Manjushri! By [understanding] that without ac-tion there is no fruitional result, the bodhisattva remains pure from theobscurations of actions” (Ascertainment of the Difficult Points of the Guide to theBodhisattva’s Way of Life, f. 95a7-b3).Dharmashri explains that an exceptional practitioner of highest capability mayrestore commitments in the following way: first, keeping in mind the illusory ordream-like nature of all things, one verbally confesses the downfall before allbuddhas and bodhisattvas pervading space. Then, one examines the nature ofthe downfall itself and understands it to be without basis, like space. Remaining"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 425in contemplation on this nature, one becomes free of any fault (Commentary onthe Three Vows, f. 189a2-4).In Nagarjuna’s system, if one has incurred a downfall with heavy emotionalinvolvement motivated by a potent hatred toward a special person such as anoutstanding bodhisattva, one must confess the downfall in front of ten holdersof the awakening mind commitments. When the downfall has stemmed from aparticularly harmful ignorance concerning the teachings, one must confess it infront of five holders. Other downfalls motivated by a simple dislike or attach-ment may be confessed in front of one or two vow holders. If no vow holder isfound, one may confess the downfall in front of a representation of the ThreeJewels (ibid., f. 195b3-5).87.Prayer to the Chief of the Victorious Ones (gTso rgyal ma): an inspiring and elo-quent prayer expressed by Shantideva in his Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life,(Bodhisattvacary›vat›ra; Byang chub sems dpa’i spyod pa la ’jug pa) (Toh. 3871), verses47 to 53 in the chapter on Confession, GBL, ff. 5b6-6a3.88. The six kinds of remedies are the following: (1) to recite the names of thebuddhas and bodhisattvas; (2) to erect representations of the buddha, etc., andstupas; (3) to prostrate before and make offerings to such symbols; (4) to read orrecite the profound discourses of the Buddha and the tantras; (5) to mutter themantras that are praised as being especially effective in purifying unwholesomedeeds, such as the hundred-syllable-mantra of Vajrasattva; and (6) to take ear-nest interest in emptiness, i.e., to try to discover the nature of the downfall, andwhen one gains certainty that no nature exists, to allow the mind to settle in thatstate (Dharmashri, f. 195a6-b2). The mantra of the transcendent ones is identicalto the one hundred-syllable-mantra of Vajrasattva, except that “tathagata” re-places “vajrasattva” (according to Thrangu Rinpoché).89.CT, f. 9b1-2.90.SB, f. 51a.91.

To take the commitments of the aspiring mind by oneself (provided one pos-sesses the personal strength of an awakened affinity for the Universal Way), onefirst performs the preliminary parts of the ceremony (as outlined in note 95).Then, in front of a representation of the Buddha, one imagines oneself to be inthe presence of all the buddhas of the ten directions and follows the procedurebelow (note 95), omitting the words of request that address the master. To takethe commitments of venturing mind (under the same condition of the awak-ened affinity), kneeling with the right knee touching the ground in front of therepresentation of the Buddha while imagining all the buddhas of the ten direc-tions to be present, one repeats three times the following words: “O buddhasand bodhisattvas who have attained the great stages and are dwelling through-out the ten directions, pay heed to me (so and so).

May I placethem in ultimate perfect peace and in the pristine awareness of the transcendentones” (Pema Karpo’s TV, vol. Ca, f. 8a4-6).95. During the preliminary part of this ceremony, while considering the masterto be the Buddha, the aspirant repeats three times the following request: “Just asthe buddhas, the saintly transcendent ones, and the bodhisattvas dwelling onthe higher stages first formed the mind of the unsurpassable awakening, O mas-ter, grant me (so and so) the mind of unsurpassable awakening.” Following this,one takes refuge with these words: “O master, take heed of me! I (so and so),from this time forward, until I reach the heart of enlightenment, go for refuge tothe Buddha, the Blessed One, supreme among humans. O master, take heed ofme! I (so and so), from this time forward, until I reach the heart of enlighten-ment, go for refuge to the teachings that embody peace and freedom from at-tachment, supreme of all teachings.

For the preliminary part of the ceremony to assume the commitments ofventuring mind, the aspirant touches the feet of the master and makes the fol-lowing request three times: “O master, respond to my request: Bestow on me thecommitments of a bodhisattva. If there is no harm in doing so, I beseech you toheed me with compassion and grant me the commitments.”The master then examines the motivation of the aspirant by posing these ques-tions: “O child of a good family! Will you liberate those not yet liberated? Willyou release those not yet released? Will you relieve those who are unrelieved?Will you set in the state of perfect peace those beings who have not yet tran-scended suffering? Do you desire to uphold the buddhas’ lineage? Will you befirm in the mind of awakening or not? Are you taking the commitments in orderto compete with someone else? Are you taking the commitments on the insis-tent request of someone else?”The aspirant, having been led before an image or painting of Buddha Shaky-amuni, imagines being in the presence of Buddha Shakyamuni and all thebuddhas and bodhisattvas of the universe. He or she makes the five outer offer-ings (form, sound, etc.) and prostrates to the buddhas. At this point, the mastersits on a high throne.

With the right knee touching the ground and handsfolded, he or she requests the master to bestow the commitments by repeatingthe following words three times: “O master! I beseech you to grant me as soonas possible the commitments of the bodhisattvas’ ethics.” Then the master, sit-ting or standing, inquires whether there are obstacles to the aspirant’s accep-tance of the commitments: “You (so and so), are you a bodhisattva? Have youresolved to awaken?” If the aspirant answers in the positive, the master acceptshim or her as a suitable candidate.The aspirant sits without speaking, mind filled with joyful anticipation ofreceiving the commitments of a bodhisattva, the source of the precious qualitiesof all the buddhas, an inexhaustible, incommensurable, and unsurpassable greattreasure of merits. The master introduces the aspirant to the three kinds of eth-ics: the ethics of restraint, of acquiring wholesome qualities, and of working forthe benefit of beings, which comprise all areas of the ethical training of allbodhisattvas and buddhas.

At the conclusion, the master rises and makes three full prostrations to thebuddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions, and with folded hands, asks thebuddhas three times to acknowledge the aspirant’s acceptance of the commit-ments: “I request you (the buddhas), who know clearly all phenomena extend-ing up to the limits of the ten directions, to acknowledge that the bodhisattva (soand so) has now perfectly received from me, the bodhisattva (so and so), thecommitments of a bodhisattva’s ethics.” Master and disciple then stand up. Thedisciple prostrates, whereupon the master informs the disciple that all thebuddhas and bodhisattvas have acknowledged the commitments and that there-after they will care for the beginner bodhisattva with kindness so that his or hermerit and pristine awareness will increase.The master then says: “You, the bodhisattva (so and so), listen! Do not speak ofthese bodhisattva commitments to those who lack faith. If you reveal your com-mitments to them, they will demean them, and thereby create for themselves nega-tive consequences equal in force to all the merits of all the bodhisattvas who abideby those commitments. Since the duty of a bodhisattva is to save others fromsuffering and turn them away from evil deeds, highly virtuous bodhisattvas shouldkeep their commitments secret.” Following this, the master explains to the begin-ner bodhisattva the root downfalls that damage the commitments, as well as theemotional and non-emotional minor infractions, and gives a brief résumé ofChandragomin’s Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva’s Commitments and of the chapteron the bodhisattva’s ethics in Asanga’s SB.

Emotional involvement is slight when afterwards one feels agreat measure of shame, and without being urged by anyone else, quickly stopsengaging in the infraction. Infractions committed with moderate or slight emo-tional involvement do not destroy the commitment (Dharmashri’s Commentaryon the Three Vows, f. 197a2-4)."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 429101. Chandragomin’s Twenty Verses, ff. 166b6-167a5.102. A practitioner who abides by the commitments of a bodhisattva shouldmake a daily offering, large or small, to the Transcendent One or to reliquaries;to the scriptures in general and to those concerned with the bodhisattva [train-ing] in particular; and to the community of bodhisattvas of the ten directions.The practitioner should at least offer a prostration to the Three Jewels whilereciting a verse of praise; or, at the very least, he or she should recollect theirqualities with faith. If a day and a night goes by without making such efforts,one incurs a contradiction to generosity. If the neglect is due to irreverence, com-placence, or laziness, an emotional contradiction is incurred; if it is a result offorgetfulness, the downfall is non-emotional. A person in a deranged state ofmind is not subject to any consequences if he or she neglects to make offerings(CTVBC, f. 173a2-5).103. If a practitioner has great desires, is never content, craves wealth and honor,and seeks to satisfy these desires with great longing, he or she incurs an emo-tional contradiction. However, if he or she has resolved to renounce these nega-tive traits and strives to apply remedies to them, but while doing so is overpow-ered by emotions and incurs the contradiction, the contradiction has no signifi-cant consequence (CTVBC, f. 173a6-b2).104. If one meets a bodhisattva who is senior to oneself and endowed with goodqualities, but out of pride, ill will, or anger, does not stand up respectfully andoffer him or her a seat, one incurs an emotional contradiction. The contradictionis non-emotional if incurred out of complacence, laziness, indifference, or for-getfulness (CTVBC, f. 173b2-3).105. If a bodhisattva, feeling pride, ill will, or anger, refuses to answer when askeda question or to converse with someone who wishes to talk, he or she incurs anemotional contradiction. The contradiction is non-emotional if done out of com-placence, laziness, indifference, or forgetfulness. The refusal is not a contradictionif one is seriously ill or in a deranged state of mind (CTVBC, f. 173b3-6).106. A bodhisattva incurs an emotional contradiction if he or she, because ofpride, ill will, or anger, does not accept an offering of food, drink, or clothing orrefuses an invitation to the home of another bodhisattva or layperson or to an-other monastery. The contradiction is non-emotional when done out of compla-cence or laziness. No downfall is incurred if it is impossible to accept the invita-tion because one is ill or in a deranged state of mind, or because the place is toofar away or the journey would be full of perils. No downfall is incurred if therefusal is a means to spiritually uplift the host or to change his or her frame ofmind to a better one (CTVBC, f. 174a2-4).107. To refuse gifts of gold, silver, pearls, blue beryl, or other valuables due topride, ill will, or anger constitutes an emotional contradiction since this involvesdisregard for others. It is non-emotional when due to complacence or laziness.No downfall is incurred if the refusal is based on the understanding that byaccepting the goods, one will become attached to them; if one suspects that the"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"430 Buddhist Ethicsgift was a mistake; if one believes that the giver will regret the gift; or if con-cerned that the person, by giving away his wealth, will become destitute. Also,no downfall is incurred by not accepting goods if one suspects that they belongto the monastic community, have been stolen, or have been acquired as a resultof killing, binding, punishing, or harming another being (CTVBC, f. 174a7-b4).108. Not to give teachings to those who are interested in them due to ill will, anger,or jealousy is an emotional contradiction. The contradiction is non-emotional ifincurred due to indolence or laziness. No contradiction is incurred if one refusesto give teachings to non-Buddhists who wish to listen to them in order to findfault with them; or if one is seriously ill or in a deranged mental state. The sameis true if the refusal is intended as a way to spiritually uplift someone and tobetter his frame of mind; if one does not have adequate knowledge of the teach-ings; or if the listener shows disrespectful manners. Furthermore, it is not a con-tradiction to refuse to expound the magnificent aspects of the teachings to ob-tuse students if these students might be intimidated by the profundity of theteachings, generate wayward views or misunderstandings, be harmed, or re-gress spiritually. There is also no downfall if the refusal is based on the suspicionthat the person will then reveal what he has heard to unworthy disciples (CTVBC,ff. 174b4-175a1).109. A bodhisattva incurs an emotional contradiction by rejecting or ignoring aperson who is evil or has broken vows if the rejection is due to ill will or angerfelt toward the person because his ethics are corrupted. The contradiction isnon-emotional if due to complacence, laziness, or forgetfulness. No contradic-tion is incurred if the rejection is a means to spiritually uplift the other person, toprevent a bad influence from spreading to others, or in order to maintain disci-pline in the monastic community (CTVBC, f. 175a2-6).110. Shantirakshita’s CTVBC explains this contradiction based on the originalwords of Chandragomin’s Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva’s Commitments, whichreads pha rol dad phyir slob mi byed (not to observe the training in order to inspireothers): A bodhisattva should observe, just as the proclaimers do, all aspects ofthe disciplinary code as prescribed by the Buddha in order to spiritually inspirethose who have no faith, as well as those who do have faith, and to guide themto liberation (f. 175a6-b1).111. Shantirakshita states that although the Buddha instructed the proclaimersto pursue only a few goals, undertake few activities, and have few worldly aspi-rations, this advice does not apply to bodhisattvas. If a bodhisattva, motivatedby ill will or anger, limits his or her scope of concern and activity, an emotionalcontradiction is incurred. It is quite appropriate for the proclaimers, who prac-tice for their own welfare alone, to restrict their activities, to strive to achieveonly a few goals, and to have few aspirations for the sake of others. However,for a bodhisattva whose aim is to accomplish others’ welfare, the same would beinappropriate.Furthermore, [contrary to the usual monastic code,] it is permissible for abodhisattva who is a monk to accept thousands of garments from a householder"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 431who can afford to make such an offering, provided the bodhisattva is doing sofor altruistic purposes. It is also appropriate for a bodhisattva who is a monk toacquire hundreds of silk mats or quantities of gold, silver, etc., if this wouldbenefit others. The same applies to the other aspects of the monastic discipline.In brief, bodhisattvas who follow the monastic discipline should not be boundto the rules as the proclaimers are. Since they maintain two kinds of ethics, thatof the proclaimers and that of the bodhisattvas, it is appropriate for bodhisattvasto accomplish their own welfare provided they are thinking ultimately of oth-ers’ benefit (CTVBC, ff. 175b1-176a2).112. Shantirakshita states that if a bodhisattva commits a deed that is unwhole-some in nature, but does so with compassionate skill in means, he or she notonly does not incur a fault, but actually cultivates merit. Suppose, for example,that a bodhisattva were to become aware that an evil person, motivated by hisdesire to acquire material things, was plotting to kill millions of exaltedproclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas. The bodhisattva, understandingthat the man was on the verge of committing many deeds of immediate retribu-tion, might decide to kill him before he had the chance to kill many others. Thebasis for this act would be the compassionate intention to prevent him fromkilling and subsequently being reborn in hell. This act of killing, performed insuch a virtuous frame of mind, would not constitute a contradiction and wouldincrease his merit. Similarly, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and all otherunvirtuous deeds are permissible for a bodhisattva if the action is motivated bycompassion. However, it must be noted that sexual activity of any form is pro-hibited for a bodhisattva who has monastic vows, as this would be a bad ex-ample for other monks and could result in a degeneration of the monastic disci-pline (CTVBC, ff. 176a3-177b2).113. If a bodhisattva uses material things he or she has acquired through one ofthe five wrong means of livelihood—flattery, hinting, seeking reward for a fa-vor, pretentious behavior, and hypocrisy—without trying to avoid and renouncethese means, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contradiction isincurred if the bodhisattva is making a sincere effort to renounce using suchmaterial things, but is overpowered by desire for them (CTVBC, f. 177b2-4).114. A bodhisattva incurs an emotional contradiction by taking pleasure in ex-cited and restless states of mind, engaging in playful activity, becoming involvedin and distracted by meaningless jokes, or wishing to excite others. There is nodownfall if the bodhisattva plays or jokes in order to dispel the ill will of othersor to relieve their sorrow (CTVBC, f. 177b4-7).115. A bodhisattva should not harbor a strong desire to attain the state of per-fect peace, but rather should resolve not to enter this state. In addition, he or sheshould not fear or try to reject emotions. If a bodhisattva resolves to stay threecountless eons in the cycle of existence and then enter into perfect peace, he orshe incurs an emotional contradiction (CTVBC, f. 178a1-6).116. A bodhisattva should try to dispel negative talk about himself or herselfand make known the truth. Not to do so is an emotional contradiction. If what is"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"432 Buddhist Ethicsbeing said is actually the truth, not to correct the behavior causing the talk wouldconstitute a non-emotional contradiction. There is no contradiction if a bodhi-sattva does not dispel the negative talk of non-Buddhists or those who clingstrongly to their own opinions, or criticism expressed by others because he ad-heres to a monastic discipline, lives on alms, or follows a virtuous practice; orwords arising from strong anger or misunderstanding (CTVBC, f. 178a6-b2).117. If a bodhisattva, while being aware that a disquieting or violent method (ora peaceful one) would be of benefit to other beings, does not apply it due to fearof displeasing others, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contradic-tion is incurred by not applying such methods when they would be of littlebenefit for a person in his present life or would make him greatly upset (CTVBC,ff. 178b2-179a2).118. If one has committed a wrong deed, or is suspected of having done so, andfeeling ill will or pride, does not apologize or make amends in a suitable waybut ignores the person who is upset with one, one incurs a contradiction. Nocontradiction is incurred if the refusal to apologize is intended as a means tospiritually uplift the other person; if the other person is a non-Buddhist or im-properly insists on having an apology; if to apologize to someone quarrelsomeby nature would cause a dispute to augment; or if one is aware that the otherperson, being meek and forbearing in character, would become embarrassed(CTVBC, ff. 178b4-1791).Bodhibhadra explains this contradiction in the following way: To reject andnot to apologize to or ask forgiveness of someone who is angry or upset withone (Revelation of the Difficult Points of the Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva’sCommitments, f. 211a2).119. A bodhisattva who, motivated by ill will or scorn, does not accept the apol-ogy of someone who has argued with him or her incurs an emotional contradic-tion. If the refusal to accept is due to the other person being obnoxious or intoler-able, this still constitutes a contradiction, but not an emotional one. No contradic-tion is incurred if the refusal is a means to spiritually influence the other person;or when the apology would be inappropriate or untimely (CTVBC, f. 179a2-4).120. If a bodhisattva, feeling anger towards someone, clings firmly to the anger,he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contradiction is incurred if thebodhisattva makes a sincere effort to get rid of the anger but still comes underits sway (CTVBC, f. 179a4-5).121. If a bodhisattva gathers a circle of followers out of a desire to be honored ormaterially enriched by them, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction (CTVBC,f. 179a5-7). No contradiction is incurred if the bodhisattva accepts honor and ser-vices without any self-interest, or gathers students motivated by loving-kindnessand receives service or honor incidentally (Bodhibhadra’s Revelation of the Diffi-cult Points, f. 211b5).122. The bodhisattva who does nothing to overcome inertia, laziness, or attach-ment to sleep, lying down, or relaxing at improper times and beyond moderation"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 433incurs an emotional contradiction. There is no contradiction if resting is due totiredness from a journey or if the periods of relaxation are moderate and occa-sional (CTVBC, f. 179a7-b1).123. A bodhisattva who passes time conversing with others in social gatheringsout of a liking for such diversions incurs an emotional contradiction. No contra-diction is incurred if the bodhisattva happens to be in the midst of a conversa-tion and participates briefly while maintaining awareness; nor is there anythingwrong in asking or answering questions if the conversation is uplifting or infor-mative (CTVBC, f. 179b2-3).124. If a bodhisattva, although wishing to develop meditative concentration,refuses to seek instructions due to ill will or pride, he or she incurs an emotionalcontradiction. No contradiction is incurred if the refusal is due to illness or asuspicion that the instructions are not genuine; or if he or she has already beeninstructed, is learned, or able to settle the mind in equipoise (CTVBC, f. 179b3-6).125. A bodhisattva who is fettered by the impediments caused by craving forobjects of desire and does nothing to eliminate them incurs an emotional contra-diction. No contradiction is incurred if while striving to dispel such impedi-ments one is overcome by longing. The same is applies to malice, sleepiness,excitement, remorse, and doubt (CTVBC, ff. 179b6-180a1).126. A bodhisattva who believes that another bodhisattva should not hear theproclaimers’ doctrine, retain it, or train in it, that it is meaningless for a bodhisattvato listen to it, retain it, or train in it, and verbalizes these beliefs incurs an emo-tional contradiction. A bodhisattva should be familiar with non-Buddhist trea-tises; thus, it goes without saying that he or she must also study various kinds ofBuddhist scriptures. However, there is no contradiction if a bodhisattva doesnot study particular scriptures in order to counteract his or her own strong in-terest in the proclaimers’ way (CTVBC, f. 180a2-5).127. If a bodhisattva, while having access to the scriptures that present thebodhisattva’s training, does not engage in studying these scriptures, ponderingtheir meanings, and making a living experience of them, but instead disregardsthem and engages in the study of the scriptures of the proclaimers, he or sheincurs an emotional contradiction (CTVBC, f. 180a5-6).128. If a bodhisattva who has access to the Buddhist scriptures does not makean effort to study, retain, and practice these teachings, but instead engages in thestudy of non-Buddhist treatises, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. Ifthe bodhisattva is exceptionally brilliant, evolved, and capable of retaining theteachings for long, reflecting on their meaning, and understanding them, andalready has a comprehension of the Buddhist scriptures derived from analyticalreasoning so that faith in them is unchanging, there is no contradiction if oneday out of two he or she studies Buddhist scriptures and on the other day stud-ies non-Buddhist ones (CTVBC, f. 180a6-b1).129. If a bodhisattva who is qualified (see previous note) to become learned innon-Buddhist scriptures does so with great joy and takes great delight in them,"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"434 Buddhist Ethicshe or she incurs an emotional contradiction (CTVBC, f. 180b1-3).130. A bodhisattva incurs an emotional contradiction if he or she, upon hearingthe exclusive message of the bodhisattva scriptures or profound and sublimetopics such as the powers of buddhas and bodhisattvas, does not take interest inthem due to misconception, and deprecates them (i.e., views the Universalistscriptures as meaningless, untrue, not reflecting the actual words of the Tran-scendent One, and of no benefit to sentient beings), or causes others to do so.If a bodhisattva when hearing such profound and sublime topics does notnaturally feel interested in them, he or she should make an effort to developunwavering confidence in them by thinking, “Although I am blind, lacking theeyes to see these profound truths that are seen only by the Transcendent One’seyes, it is not right for me to reject what the Transcendent One knows and hastaught,” and engage in earnest study of them (CTVBC, f. 180b3-7).131. If a bodhisattva does not attend a discourse on the sacred teachings or arelated discussion due to pride, ill will, or anger, he or she incurs an emotionalcontradiction. There is no contradiction if the bodhisattva does not attend be-cause he or she is ill, suspects that the teaching is not genuine, does not wish toupset the speaker by his or her presence, or is extremely stupid and has weakpower of understanding (CTVBC, f. 181a3-6).132. If a bodhisattva, desiring material gain or motivated by anger, praises him-self and deprecates another, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. Nocontradiction is incurred if the object of deprecation is a non-Buddhist providedone’s intention is to make the Buddhist teachings last longer; or if praising one-self and deprecating another would serve as a means to uplift others spiritually,to make non-believers believe, or to lead on the path to liberation those who dohave faith (CTVBC, f. 181a1-3).133. If a bodhisattva, out of irreverence or conscious disregard for the meaningof a discourse, scorns or mocks a person who is expounding the teachings, he orshe incurs an emotional contradiction (CTVBC, f. 181a7). Bodhibhadra statesthat to fixate on the words of the teaching rather than their meaning with theintention of criticizing the teacher is a contradiction (Revelation of the DifficultPoints, f. 214a3-4).134. A bodhisattva who is abiding by the commitments should perform the fol-lowing activities: caring for the needs of others, helping those who are on a jour-ney, helping others to accomplish their tasks, looking after the belongings ofothers, reconciling factions, and helping others earn their living or hold festivi-ties. Not to do so out of ill will or anger constitutes an emotional contradiction.There is no contradiction in not performing these duties in the following cases:when the bodhisattva is unable to help due to illness, has entrusted the respon-sibility to another capable person, or the other person is able to help himself orhas an attendant or guardian to help him; when to help would be dangerous ornot in accord with the teachings; when the bodhisattva is busy in other whole-some activities such as meditation; when not helping would be a means to pro-tect many persons, or to uphold the discipline of the monastic community; or"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 435when the bodhisattva is unable to expound the teachings due to insufficientstudy or inferior intellect (CTVBC, f. 181b1-4).135. If a bodhisattva meets a sick person and, out of ill will or anger, does notattend to his needs, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. There is no con-tradiction in the following cases: if the bodhisattva himself is sick; if he or sheentrusts the duty to someone else; if the sick person has an attendant or can takecare of himself; or if the bodhisattva is engaged in other important virtuous deedsand helping would constitute an interference to these (CTVBC, ff. 181b5-182a1).136. If a bodhisattva meets a person who is suffering, and because of pride,anger, or ill will, does not alleviate his suffering but turns his back on him, he orshe incurs an emotional contradiction. The contradiction is non-emotional if basedon complacence or laziness. No fault is incurred if the bodhisattva himself issuffering (Bodhibhadra’s Revelation of the Difficult Points, f. 214b5-6). The specifi-cations of the previous notes also apply here.137. If a bodhisattva meets a person who has entered a path that is mistaken inthe sense of being detrimental to his welfare in the present life and in futureones and, out of ill will or anger, does not point out to him the correct path, he orshe incurs an emotional contradiction. No fault is incurred in the following cases:when one is unable to help, or has entrusted the responsibility to someone elsewho is competent; when the person can correct himself or is already under thecare of a spiritual guide; when the person to be corrected feels ill will towardoneself, or would take one’s advice in the wrong way because of being insubor-dinate; when the person is wicked and would have no respect or appreciationfor the advice; or when aware that to give the advice would be in vain (CTVBC,f. 182a2-5).138. If a bodhisattva, out of ill will or anger, does not repay or even feel inclinedto repay help received, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contra-diction is incurred if one tries to reciprocate but is unable to do so; or if the otherperson does not wish to be repaid (CTVBC, f. 182a5-b1).139. If a bodhisattva, out of anger or hatred, does not alleviate the suffering ofpeople close to him or of those who are destitute, he or she incurs an emotionalcontradiction (CTVBC, f. 182b1-2).140. If a bodhisattva refuses to give others material aid such as food, beverages, orother objects of desire when asked for them because of ill will or anger, he or sheincurs an emotional contradiction. No contradiction is incurred if one does nothave the objects requested or if one is asked for inappropriate or unsuitable things;or if refusal is necessary to maintain monastic discipline (CTVBC, f. 182b3-5).141. If a bodhisattva, because of ill will or anger, does not provide spiritual carefor his or her circle of followers, or does not seek from faithful patrons clothes,food, bedding, mats, medicines, and other necessities for them, he or she incursan emotional contradiction. No contradiction is incurred if one’s students arewell-off or capable of taking care of themselves; or if they have already com-pleted their training; or if among one’s students, a non-Buddhist has come to"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"436 Buddhist Ethicslisten to the teachings for an inappropriate reason and there is no chance for himto be converted (CTVBC, ff. 182b5-183a3).142. If a bodhisattva, because of ill will, does not act in accordance with others’wishes, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contradiction is incurredif the other’s needs have already been satisfied; if one is unable to; if to act inaccordance would jeopardize the discipline within the monastic community; ifsatisfying the needs of one person would be contrary to the wishes or needs ofmany others; or if not acting in accordance would convert a non-Buddhist, etc.(CTVBC, f. 183a3-6).143. If a bodhisattva because of ill will does not speak of and praise the goodqualities of another or give recognition to someone else for a well-deliveredspeech, he or she incurs an emotional contradiction. No contradiction is incurredif one knows that that person is naturally modest; if one is unable to; or if onesuspects that praising the person would inflate his pride, arrogance, or conceit,or harm him somehow; or if the other person has feigned good qualities or speech(CTVBC, f. 183a6-b).144. If a monk, according to the rules of the monastic discipline, deserves to beput under surveillance, punished, or banished, and the responsible bodhisattva,for some afflicted motive, does not carry out this duty, he incurs an emotionalcontradiction. No contradiction is incurred in not subjecting the monk to disci-plinary measures if the monk is insubordinate, ill willed, or of bad character; ifdoing so would cause a quarrel or a division in the monastic community; or ifthe monk, although careless, still has shame and embarrassment and thereforewill quickly improve by himself (CTVBC, f. 183b3-7).145. If a bodhisattva is capable of showing powers, performing miracles, andcreating emanations, and does not do so before someone who should be intimi-dated or one who might be spiritually inspired, he or she incurs an emotionalcontradiction. No contradiction is incurred if the person is extremely opinion-ated, is a non-Buddhist, deprecates exalted beings, or has wayward views; orwhen the person is in a highly deranged state of mind or oppressed by suffer-ing, or is not a member of the monastic community (CTVBC, ff. 183b7-184a3).146. Complacence (snyoms las) implies that one is well aware that a particulardeed is an infraction to the bodhisattva’s training but one still engages in it.Shantirakshita and Bodhibhadra, commentators on the Twenty Verses on theBodhisattva Commitments, as well as Asanga, in presenting most of the forty-sixsecondary infractions, state that an infraction incurred through complacence con-stitutes a non-emotional infraction.147. In addition to these conditions for infractions to be of no consequence,Asanga states that if an infraction is committed while tormented by suffering, orby one who has not assumed the bodhisattva commitments, it is of no conse-quence (SB, f. 97a6-7).148.SB, f. 86a3-6.149. Shantirakshita states that unlike the offenses of a monk, which are categorized"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 437as five types (defeating offenses, partially defeating offenses, downfalls that in-volve forfeiture or confession alone, offenses to be individually confessed, andminor infractions), transgressions to the bodhisattva’s commitments are only oftwo kinds: factors for a defeat (pham pa’i gnas lta bu’i chos su gtogs pa) and factorsfor a minor infraction (nyes byas kyi chos su gtogs pa) (CTVBC, f. 173a7).150. Vow holder (sdom ldan). Shantirakshita states that one can confess a trans-gression committed with moderate or slight emotional involvement to follow-ers of either the proclaimers’ or the bodhisattvas’ training (CTVBC, f. 172a6). Ofthe same opinion is Atisha; see Commentary on the Lamp for the Path (Bodhim›rga-pradıpapañjik›; Byang chub lam gyi sgron ma’i dka’ ’grel) (vol. Khi, f. 266b3) (Toh.3948).151. “One’s own mind” refers to having shame and embarrassment, disciplineand pacification, and the intention not to repeat the transgression. When no ap-propriate person is found, all infractions may be confessed in the imagined pres-ence of the buddhas and bodhisattvas (CTVBC, f. 172b5-6).152.SB, f. 86a6.153. Ten virtuous activities (chos spyod bcu): copying the scriptures, making of-ferings, being generous, listening to the teachings, memorizing and studyingthe scriptures, expounding the teachings, reciting the scriptures, pondering theimport of the teachings, and integrating them into one’s life. Dharmashri statesthat the way to cultivate merit in conjunction with pristine awareness is by per-forming virtuous activities without conceptualization of the reality of the agent,act, and object (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 154b3).154. These four black and four white deeds are also presented in the tenth chap-ter of Gampopa’s JOL, ff. 88b5-94a6.155. The ethics of restraint (sdom pa’i tshul khrims), of acquiring good qualities(dge ba chos sdud pa’i tshul khrims), and of working for the benefit of others (semscan gyi don byed pa’i tshul khrims).156.JOL, f. 106a5-6.157. The ethics of restraint calms one’s mind and instills a feeling of well-beingin this life. The ethics of acquiring good qualities brings one’s enlightened quali-ties to maturity without physical hardship. The ethics of working for the benefitof others leads others to spiritual maturity (SB, f. 101b2).158. The eight worldly concerns (’jig rten chos brgyad) in four pairs: the hope forgain and fear of loss; and likewise, fame and obscurity; praise and blame; plea-sure and misery.159. The opposites of the eightfold noble path (a ̋ ̨›ºgam›rga, ’phags lam yan lagbrgyad): wrong view, thought, speech, effort, livelihood, mindfulness, concen-tration, and action.160.

Chandragomin’s Twenty Verses, f. 167a5.162. As means to help others, even the seven unvirtuous actions of body andspeech are permitted in special circumstances. For instance, to save the lives ofmany people, one may kill their potential murderer; to save a person from dy-ing of hunger, one may steal food from a wealthy person; to save a woman whowould die from unsatisfied sexual desire, one may engage in sexual intercourse;to save someone sure to be killed, one may hide him and lie about his where-abouts; to save someone being led to lower forms of life by an evil companion,one may slander one of them in order to divide the two; to relieve someone’ssorrow or to lead one who likes to chatter to the true teachings, one may tellstories and engage in other kinds of senseless speech; and to divert someonefrom doing an evil act, one may use harsh speech. However, since one’s state ofmind is the crucial factor in determining whether an act is virtuous or not, thethree unvirtuous states of mind, covetousness, malice, and wayward views, arenever acceptable in any circumstances (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the ThreeVo w s , ff. 181b5-182b2).163.JOL, ff. 107b6-108a1.164. Three spiritual paths: those of the proclaimers, solitary sages, andbodhisattvas.165. The six branches of generosity—the generosity of generosity, the generos-ity of ethics, the generosity of patience, and so on—stem from the practice ofgetting others to practice each of the six perfections; the six branches of ethics,from the practice of each of the six perfections unstained by their respectiveincompatible factors; the six branches of patience, from the practice of each per-fection while enduring their respective hardships; the six branches of effort, fromthe practice of each perfection accompanied by joy; the six branches of medita-tion, from the undistracted practice of each perfection; and the six branches ofwisdom, from the practice of each perfection free of the concepts of act, agent,and object (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, ff. 61a1-3).166. This overall description is drawn from the eleventh chapter of Gampopa’sJOL, ff. 94a6-96b6.167. Gampopa states that improper intention (bsams pa ma dag pa) means to givewith the perverse intention of harming someone, with the wish to acquire agood reputation in the present life, or in order to compete with others; or to offerwith the inferior motivation of wishing to be free of poverty in the next life, orwith the desire to be reborn as a human or a god and to enjoy that life. Impropergifts (dngos po ma dag pa) refers to such articles as poison, fire, and weapons,when these can be harmful, or one’s father, mother, child, or spouse. Improperrecipient (zhing ma dag pa) refers to those who wish to practice necromancy, de-monic beings, or insane people, to whom a bodhisattva should not give awayhis or her body or limbs. Improper manner of giving (thabs ma dag pa) means togive while angry or upset with the recipient; with scorn or disdain toward a badperson; or to a beggar while rebuking, threatening, or disheartening him (JOL,f. 98b2-99b4)."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 439Dharmashri states that the giving of material things is a practice to be donemainly by lay bodhisattvas; the gift of the teachings, by monastic bodhisattvas;the giving of one’s country, children, spouse, and limbs, by those who have gaineda direct understanding of emptiness (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 163b4-5).168. This classification of generosity is derived from Asanga’s Synthesis of Phe-nomenology (Abhidharmasamuccaya; Chos mngon pa kun las btus pa) (Toh. 4049),modified by Gampopa in JOL, f. 101a3-4.169. Nine methods to develop patience: (1) recognize that those who harm usare not masters of themselves; (2) examine the unfitness of our actions; (3) theunfitness of our body; (4) and the unfitness of our attachment to it; (5) under-stand that faults lie in both oneself and the other; (6) reflect upon the usefulnessof harmful persons; (7) think of them as benefactors; (8) repay the kindness thebuddhas have shown to us; and (9) realize the chance harmful people give us toattain enlightenment.The first method is expressed in verse 31 of chapter VI of Shantideva’s Guideto the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life (f. 15b6):Everything is governed by something elseAnd thus a human being is powerless.Having understood this, I should not become angryAt things which are like a magical spell.the second method, in verse 42 (f. 16a5):Similar harm I didPreviously to others.It is fitting that this harm now be returnedTo me who has been injurious to other beings.the third method, in verse 43 (f. 16a5-6):His weapon and my bodyAre both the cause of my suffering.Since he brought forth the weapon and I the body,Who shall I angrily blame?the fourth method, in verse 44 (f. 16a6-7):This sore that resembles a human bodyCannot bear to be touched and is painful.If blinded by attachment I cling to itWith whom shall I become angry when it is injured?the fifth method, in verse 67 (f. 17a5):When some do wrong out of ignoranceAnd others ignorantly become angry at that,Who can be said to be without fault?Who can be said to be at fault?the sixth method, in verse 48 (f. 16b1-2):Depending on them for my patience,I purify many evils."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"440 Buddhist EthicsBut they depending upon meWill stay long in a hell of misery.the seventh method, in verses 107-8 (f. 18b7):Since he assists me in my awakeningI must be pleased to have an enemy.Because I train with him,The fruit of patienceShould be first bestowed on him,For he is the cause of patience.the eighth method, in verse 119 (f. 19a7):Moreover, what way can there be to repay [the buddhas]Who grant incommensurable benefitAnd are reliable friends,Other than by appeasing sentient beings?the ninth method, in verse 112 (f. 19a2-3):The Mighty One has saidThat the field of sentient beings is a buddha field,For many who have appeased themHave thereby reached perfection.The identification of the verses that correspond to the nine methods is based onGampopa’s JOL, ff. 113a2-114b1.170. Five thoughts (’du shes lnga) to develop patience: the thought of how dearthe harmful person may have been in one’s previous lives (sngon gyi tshe rabs susnying du sdug par gyur pa’i ’du shes); the thought of the harmful person as simplya phenomenon (chos tsam gyi rjes su ’brang ba’i ’du shes); the thought of imperma-nence (mi rtag pa’i ’du shes); the thought of misery (sdug bsngal ba’i ’du shes); andthe thought of fully accepting others (yongs su bzung ba’i ’du shes).Asanga’s Stages of the Bodhisattva presents the steps to cultivate these five: (1)How does a bodhisattva train in considering how dear a harmful person was inprevious lives? By thinking that over the course of many lives, that person mayhave been one’s father, mother, brother, sister, attendant, preceptor, master, orspiritual guide. [The benefit one has received from him] is difficult to fathom.With this correct perspective, the bodhisattva gives up the idea of the personbeing an enemy, but considers him precious; and does not wish to retaliate, butpatiently accepts whatever harm is done.(2) How does a bodhisattva train in considering the harmful person as just aphenomenon? By thinking that the person harming oneself exists only in de-pendence upon many conditions, and of many composite factors, simply a phe-nomenon. Therefore, one can isolate no self, mental substance, life principle, orpersonality that is abusing, angry, beating, reviling, or finding fault withoneself. With this correct perspective, the bodhisattva dissolves the idea of the"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 441harmful person as a [real] person and sees him as just a phenomenon. Consider-ing the nature of that person to be simply a phenomenon, the bodhisattva doesnot wish to retaliate, but instead patiently accepts whatever harm is done.(3) How does a bodhisattva train in considering the impermanence of theharmful person? By thinking that all sentient beings are impermanent and sub-ject to death. The worst harm would be to deprive them of their lives. A wisebodhisattva should never be unaware of the transient nature of beings, not tospeak of being so confused as to strike them with one’s hand, throw earth, hitthem with a stick, or kill them. With this correct perspective, the bodhisattvadissolves the idea of eternalism and substantiality with respect to the harmfulperson and sees him as transient and essenceless. Considering the transient na-ture of that person, the bodhisattva does not wish to retaliate, but patiently ac-cepts whatever harm is done.(4) How does a bodhisattva train in considering the misery of the harmfulperson? By thinking that even beings in the most excellent of circumstances aresubject to the triad of misery: the misery intrinsic to conditioned existence, themisery of change, and the misery of misery. Seeing the constant state of suffer-ing of beings, the bodhisattva resolves to dispel their misery, thinking: “I shouldnot [retaliate] as this would cause the very misery that I must dispel.” With thiscorrect perspective, the bodhisattva dissolves the idea of the harmful person asa happy being. Thinking of the suffering of that person, one does not wish toretaliate, but patiently accepts whatever harm is done.(5) How does a bodhisattva train in the full acceptance of the harmful per-son? By thinking “Having formed the mind of awakening, I will accomplish thewelfare of others.” The bodhisattva should treat all beings as a spouse, thinking,“Accepting all beings in this way, I will work for their benefit. To wish to harmthem is not proper.” With this correct perspective, the bodhisattva dissolves theidea that the harmful person is someone unrelated and fully accepts that per-son. By doing so, he or she does not wish to retaliate, but patiently accepts what-ever harm is done (SB, ff. 102b1-103b3).171. The quest for the teachings entails being strongly inclined to examine theeight topics of spiritual interest: (1) the qualities of the Three Jewels, (2) the mean-ing of reality (emptiness), (3) the power of the buddhas, (4) the power of thebodhisattvas, (5) the law of causality, (6) the goal one seeks, (7) the means toachieve that goal, and (8) the range of topics to be known to gain that end (SB, f.105a5-6).172. Armor-like effort (go cha’i brtson ’grus), effort applied to the task (sbyor ba’ibrtson ’grus), and insatiable effort (chog mi shes pa’i brtson ’grus). Gampopa desig-nates the first as the perfect motivation, the second as the perfect application,and the third as the perfection of their integration (JOL, f. 118b1-2).173. Fivefold effort in accomplishing what is wholesome: ever-active effort thatknows no interruption; devoted effort in acting swiftly in a joyful and interested"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"442 Buddhist Ethicsstate of mind; effort unshaken by the negative effects of one’s emotions, precon-ceptions, and misery; effort not deflected by circumstances although knowingthat one can be hurt, treated harshly, or upset by others when seeing the mani-festations of their deteriorated views; effort without pride or a feeling of superi-ority (JOL, ff. 119b1-120a2).174. Meditative concentration by which one rests in a state of ease in the presentlife (mthong ba’i chos la bde bar gnas pa’i bsam gtan), acquires good qualities (yontan sgrub pa’i bsam gtan), and works for the welfare of others (sems can gyi donbyed pa’i bsam gtan). The meditative concentration (of a bodhisattva) is definedas mental quiescence (which is a virtuous mind resting single-pointedly onworldly or transworldly paths), insight, and the path that unifies both, whichhave been preceded by listening to and reflecting on the teachings on thebodhisattva path (SB, f. 111a2-3).175. A bodhisattva’s meditative concentration has six qualities: (1) free fromconcepts in that the mind rests in single-pointedness, devoid of the movement[of conceiving] being or not being, etc.; (2) producing physical and mental pli-ancy in that all kinds of unfitness of mind and body have been eliminated; (3)completely tranquil, a state that is entered spontaneously; (4) without pride,that is, without the impediment of an [afflicted] view; (5) free from attachmentto pleasure, that is, without the impediment of worldliness; and (6) free fromobjectifiable attributes, being devoid of the pleasant experiences of the form realm,etc. (JOL, ff. 129b6-130a1).176. Totalities (zad par), masteries (zil gnon), and emancipations (rnam thar) areforms of concentration (ting nge ’dzin). For an explanation of these, see Kongtrul’sInfinite Ocean of Knowledge (IOK) (Shes bya mtha’ yas pa’i rgya mtsho) (Beijing: Bodmi rigs dpe bskrun khang, 1982), vol. II, pp. 614-618. See also Guenther’s Phi-losophy and Psychology in the Abhidharma (Berkeley and London: Shambhala, 1976),pp. 134-141.177.

A ritual involving creative imagination performed during a tantric empow-erment during which one thinks of oneself as being in the simple form of the deityfor which one is empowered. One stands with eyes blindfolded at the entrance ofthe eastern gate of the deity’s mandala. There one takes the refuge, bodhisattva,and mantra vows. At that point, the relative and ultimate minds, together knownas the mind of all-encompassing yoga, are generated. One imagines that relativeawakening mind takes the form of a moon disc at the heart, and ultimate awaken-ing mind, a five-pronged vajra standing on a moon disc. See Tenzin Gyatso, theDalai Lama, The Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, edited and translated by JeffreyHopkins (London: Wisdom Publications, 1985), pp. 234-235.190. Kongtrul here paraphrases the words of Sakya Pandita’s verses found inhis Analysis of the Three Vows in Collected Works, vol. II, p. 29, lines 3-6, and p. 17.191. As explained above, the awakening mind that arises through indicationsgiven by a spiritual teacher is a relative one.192. The Hundred Rites of Renunciation and Fulfillment (sPang skong phyag brgyapa) (Toh. 267), ff. 1b-5b: according to legend, a scripture that fell from the skyonto the top of Yumbu Lakang Palace (pho brang yum bu gla sgang) at the time ofthe Tibetan King Lha Totori. By saying “it is possible,” Sakya Pandita indicateshis doubt about the authenticity of this text. Further, in his Rite of Formation of theAwakening Mind (Collected Works, vol. II, p. 583), he states: “The Hundred Rites fellfrom the sky in Tibet and is not a translation from Sanskrit; therefore, it is diffi-cult for scholars to consider it as an authentic source.”193. The assertion made by followers of Ngari Panchen may be summarized asfollows: the tantras Magical Net (MañjuŸrıjñ›nasattvasya-param›rthan›ma-sa ̇gıti;’Jam dpal ye shes sems pa’i don dam pa’i mtshan yang dag par brjod pa/ ’Jam dpal sgyu’phrul drva ba) (Toh. 360), Vairochana-abhisambodhi (Mah›vairocan›bhisa ̇bodhi-vikurvit›dhi ̋ ̨h›navaipulyasÒtreindrar›jan›madharmapary›ya; rNam par snang mdzad"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter III 445chen po mngon par rdzogs par byang chub pa rnam par sprul pa byin gyis rlob pa shintu rgyas pa mdo sde’i dbang po’i rgyal po zhes bya ba’i chos kyi rnam grangs) (Toh.494), Nagarjuna’s Commentary on the Awakening Mind (Bodhicitta vivara ̊a, Byangchub sems kyi ’grel pa) (Toh. 1800), the Five Stages (Pañcakrama; Rim pa lnga pa)(Toh. 1802) and others, do present ceremonies for the formation of an ultimateawakening mind. These are Secret Mantra procedures that take as their path thepristine awareness of the result. Through such ceremonies, a facsimile of ulti-mate awakening mind is formed as a means to create the conducive circum-stances for the actual attainment of ultimate awakening mind. This facsimilehas the nature of the aspiring mind, but is not the actual ultimate awakeningmind which can only be formed through the strength of meditation. The state-ment from the Hundred Rites of Renunciation and Fulfillment (sPang skong phyagbrgya pa) (Toh. 267) refers simply to a promise to form ultimate awakening mind,not to the ultimate mind itself. Otherwise, if one accepts the notion that an awak-ening mind could be formed through a rite, one would have to endorse the conse-quence that ultimate awakening mind is born from indications (words). How-ever, this is not the case because, as stated by Kamalashila in his Stages of Medita-tion, such a mind is actualized through the constant cultivation of mental quies-cence and insight (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, ff. 242b1-244a5).194. Absolute dedication (yongs ’dzin), subsequent achievement (rjes sgrub), andrealization (rtogs pa). In the following verse cited from the Scripture Ornament,the first aspect is conveyed by the words “well-honored” (rab mnyes); the sec-ond, by the words “merit and awareness have been thoroughly cultivated” (tshogsrab bsags); and the third, by the words “non-conceptual pristine awareness hasarisen” (chos la mi rtog pa’i ye shes).195. f. 4b6.196. In his Explanation of the Scripture Ornament, Vasubandhu states that ulti-mate awakening mind attained on the first stage of a bodhisattva (called Joyful)is a mind of equanimity toward all phenomena that has realized the selflessnessof all. It is a mind of equanimity toward all beings that has realized the equalityof oneself and others. It is a mind of equanimity toward the activities of beingsthat wishes the end of all suffering of others just as one wishes the end of one’sown. It is a mind of equanimity toward the Buddha that realizes the inseparabil-ity of oneself and the sphere of reality (f. 140a7-b2).197.GBL, f. 8a1-2.

These are known as the three dimensions of awakening (k›ya, sku). Forfurther explanation, see chapter 20 of JOL.Chapter IV: The Vows and Pledges of the Secret Mantra1. The new schools (gsar ma), which originated from the later translations (phyi’gyur) of tantras from Sanskrit, refers to the lineages of the Kagyu (bKa’ brgyud),Sakya (Sa skya), and Geluk (dGe lugs) traditions.

TheGeluk tradition was rooted in the Kadam (Words of the Buddha as Personal"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 447Instructions) tradition, which began with Atisha (982-1054) and his renowneddisciple Dromtönpa (’Brom ston pa) (1004-1064). The main practices of theselineages are based on the tantras translated after the beginning of the eleventhcentury and during the later spread of Buddhism in Tibet. The pioneer of thesetranslations was Rinchen Zangpo (Rin chen bzang po) (958-1051).2. The ancient school (rnying ma), which originated with the early translationsof tantras, was inspired by the mystic activity of the Indian master Padma-sambhava in the ninth century.

Those systems lead to the awakening of theproclaimers, the nature of which is the elimination of emotional impediments,and to the awakening of the solitary sages, the nature of which is the eliminationof emotional impediments plus half of the impediments preventing the attain-ment of omniscience. The Traditionalist view is based on a literal reading of theBuddha’s discourses. The Experientialist view maintains that only conscious-ness is real. The Centrist view is that all that exists is mere convention (Commen-tary on the Hevajra Tantra, f. 271a3-4).Saroruha states: To elucidate the Analyst philosophy, teach the nature of thefive aggregates and so forth.

The seminal essence is thebasis for the experience of great bliss; its emission or loss compromises the expe-rience of the pristine awareness of great bliss and perpetuates cyclic life, in theouter sense of initiating the life of another being and in the inner sense of start-ing the process of dualism. Thus, the Wheel of Time (Kalachakra) and othertantras speak of the propensity for emission of seminal essence as the cause ofcyclic life. (Kongtrul’s Commentary on [Rangjung Dorjé’s] Profound Inner Reality[rNal ’byor bla na med pa’i rgyud sde rgya mtsho’i snying po bsdus pa zab mo nang gidon nyung nu’i tshig gis rnam par ’grol ba zab don snang byed], ff. 101a1-102a4.)12. Pema Karpo states that “awareness” (vidy›, rig pa) in awareness-holder vows(rig ’dzin gyi sdom pa) refers to the pristine awareness of the union of skillfulmeans and emptiness. To remain in pristine awareness is “to hold” (’dzin pa)awareness. The binding of the three doors—body, speech, and mind—effectedby remaining in pristine awareness constitutes the “vow” (sdom pa).

In tantra, while retaining this same meaning, awakening"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 449mind is equated with the seminal essence, which is the seed or support of greatbliss. The relative aspect of awakening mind is the seminal essence itself, whilethe ultimate awakening mind is the bliss which is born from it. When bliss arisesfrom union with the lotus of the consort but subsequently ebbs due to loss of theseminal essence, the cycle of life is initiated. When the seminal essence is retained,the experience is one of great bliss. By binding that great bliss with the “chain” ofthe understanding of reality, one attains the vajra-like dimension of awakening.Such awakening mind or great bliss is formed through the stages of self-blessinginvolving the descent of the seminal essence located at the crown of the head. Asthe outflow of the seminal essence is blocked, non-recognition of bliss ceases; theessence is drawn back to the navel, heart, throat, and crown of the head, and isstabilized and absorbed at various places. In this manner, cyclic life (the aggre-gates and other components) becomes perfect peace. For this reason, the seminalessence (bodhicitta) is perfect peace (nirv› ̊a) and embodies both the relative andthe ultimate (Commentary That Epitomizes the Hevajra Tantra, f. 98a1-b4).17. Subhagavajra states that tantra (lit. “continuity”) (rgyud) comprises two as-pects: actual tantra (don gyi rgyud) and tantra of words (tshig gi rgyud). Actualtantra is threefold: tantra of the ground [or causal tantra] (gzhi’i rgyud); tantra ofskillful means (thabs kyi rgyud); and tantra of the result (’bras bu’i rgyud). Thetantra of the ground comprises the two truths; the tantra of skillful means, thetwo phases of tantric practice, creation and completion; and the tantra of theresult, the reality and form dimensions of awakening. Tantra (continuity) is socalled because the three aspects of the actual tantra are interconnected: based onthe ground tantra, the practitioner cultivates the tantra of skill in means, and asa consequence of that, he or she attains the resultant tantra. (Stages of the Path ofthe Universal Way [Mah›y›napathakrama; Theg pa chen po’i lam gyi rim pa] [Toh.3717], f. 193a1-4.)Kongtrul defines rgyud (tantra) as the continuity of natural clear-light aware-ness (’od gsal), the ever-perfect (samantabhadra, kun tu bzang po) mind of awaken-ing (bodhicitta, byang chub kyi sems) that knows no beginning or end. The clearlight’s continuity is ever-present from time without beginning and knows nointerruption. This continuity has three aspects: the causal continuity (rgyu’i rgyud),the continuity of skillful means, and the resultant continuity. The causal conti-nuity refers to the sky-like nature of the mind that does not change in any givenstate, whether one is a sentient being bound by attachment or a buddha. Theskillful means continuity, in general terms, embraces all the stages of the experi-ential path from practice of the six perfections and the three spiritual ways up tothe Yoga Tantra path. More specifically, it refers to the two phases of the HighestYoga Tantra that have been prepared for through the initiation, along with allthe branches of these two phases. The causal continuity freed from all adventi-tious stains is the result continuity: awakening itself, the dimension of purity(acquired purity and natural purity) and the foundation for actualizing the wel-fare of others. (The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge [Shes bya mtha’ yas pa’i rgya mtsho][Beijing: Bod mi rigs dpe bskrun khang, 1982] [henceforth cited as IOK], vol.

The skillful means continuity refers to the assemblage ofthe causal conditions of mantra, seals, mandala, etc.; it is also called the continu-ity of yoga (rnal ’byor rgyud) where yoga denotes the union of wisdom and means.As well, the term tantra or continuity is used to denote the scriptures that recordthe words of instruction for the yoga. (Explanation of Root Tantric Downfalls[Vajray›namÒl›patti ̨ık›; rDo rje theg pa’i rtsa ba’i ltung ba’i rgya cher bshad pa] [Toh.2488] [henceforth cited as ERD], f. 202b1-3.)18. For a discussion of the various systems of classifying the tantras and theunderlying bases for these classifications, see Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. II, pp. 572-580.19. A practitioner imagines himself or herself as the appropriate deity and usesas the spiritual path the joyous bliss that arises from desire caused by looking atthe consort, etc.In the lower sets of tantras, this is not done while observing an external seal [anactual consort], and even in the higher set of tantras [Highest Yoga], it is not taughtthat such is done [in the lower tantras]; therefore, these should be understood asmeditated goddesses, such as Lochana. (Tsongkapa, “The Great Exposition of Se-cret Mantra,” in H. H. the Dalai Lama et al., Tantra in Tibet, pp. 160-161.)20. Common spiritual way (theg pa thun mong) here refers to the Way of the Per-fections or common Universal Way.21. The four gross and four subtle forms of grasping to subject and object (gzung’dzin gyi rnam rtog phra rags bzhi): the two very rough (shin tu ches ba) and the tworough (ches ba) forms of grasping to subject and object as real, and the two subtle(phra ba) and the two very subtle (shin tu phra ba) forms. The four gross and foursubtle propensities for movement (pho ba’i bag chags phra rags bzhi) are classified inthe same way (Oral communication of Khenpo Chödrak, Tso Pema, H.P. India).22. Regular confession or sevenfold service (rgyun bshags / rgyun bshags kyi yanlag bdun pa) consists of confession of wrong deeds, rejoicing in virtue, formationof the ultimate awakening mind, taking refuge, formation of the awakening mindof aspiration, the venturing awakening mind, and the dedication of merit. SeeTenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, The Kalachakra Tantra: Rite of Initiation (London:Wisdom Publications, 1985) (henceforth cited as KT), pp. 184-185.23.

This stage consists of a recitation, after which disciples imagine they havebecome the deity, take their places at the eastern gate of the mandala, and theretake refuge vows, the awakening mind commitments, and the mantric vows.See KT, pp. 101-105, 217-235.26. The phase of the initiation at which the master asks the disciples who theyare and what they desire.

See also KT, pp. 232-235.28. Inner entry (nang ’jug): the phase of the initiation at which disciples are ledbeyond the curtains of the mandala (the curtains of the constructed mandala)for the initiation that gives them divine fortune. Disciples (blindfolded) imaginethat they are entering the mandala from the eastern door and circumambulatingthe deities; they promise to honor the pledges; the pristine awareness deitiesdescend and become inseparable from the commitment deity in whose form thedisciples visualize themselves; they each cast a flower onto the mandala to de-termine their affiliation to one of the buddha families while the master invokesthe power of truth; they are each empowered with a garland so that they may bespiritually nurtured by the lord of the buddha family to which they belong; andfinally, they take off their blindfolds and imagine beholding the deities of themandala. See KT, pp. 101-105, 236-254.29. See previous note.30. At this point, the master introduces the disciples to the deities by describingthem, and the disciples imagine that they are actually seeing them. See KT, pp.248-254.31. Vase initiation (bum dbang): the first of the four Highest Yoga Tantra initia-tions. In the system of the Wheel of Time Tantra, this is preceded by seven infe-rior initiations, and is therefore the eighth. For a discussion of the vase initia-tion, see Ferdinand D. Lessing and Alex Wayman, mKhas grub rje’s Introductionto the Buddhist Tantric Systems (The Hague: 1968; 2nd ed. Delhi: MotilalBanarsidass, 1978) (henceforth cited as IBTS), pp. 309-317. See also IK, pp. 187-190.32. The higher initiations (dbang gong ma) of the Highest Yoga Tantra are thesecret initiation (guhy›bhi ̋eka, gsang dbang), the initiation of pristine awarenessthrough wisdom (prajñ›jñ›na abhi ̋eka, shes rab ye shes kyi dbang), and the word(fourth) initiation (ak ̋ar›bhi ̋eka, tshig dbang). The first empowers speech andpurifies the stains and habitual tendencies of speech. It authorizes disciples topractice meditations on energies and channels and enables them to attain theenjoyment dimension of awakening. The second empowers mind and purifiesits stains and habitual tendencies. It authorizes disciples to practice meditationon the stage of completion and enables them to attain the reality dimension ofawakening. The third empowers body, speech, and mind, and purifies all stainsand tendencies of these three aspects of experience. It introduces disciples to theunion of the illusory pure body and radiant awareness of a buddha, authorizes"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"452 Buddhist Ethicsthem to cultivate such union, and enables them to attain the natural dimensionof awakening. In the Wheel of Time Tantra, which includes two sets of higherinitiations, the vase initiation is also considered a higher initiation related to thephase of completion.For a detailed discussion of these, see IBTS, pp. 309-328. See also IK, pp. 187-201.33. The appended (initiation) using symbols of auspiciousness (mtha’ rten gyidbang): a part of the vase initiation during which the master encourages andbestows power on disciples by presenting them with the seven royal articles(rgyal srid sna bdun) (the precious wheel, jewel, queen, minister, elephant, horse,and general), eight auspicious signs (bkra shis rtags brgyad) (parasol, pair of goldenfish, treasure vase, lotus, conch shell swirled clockwise, endless knot, banner ofvictory, and wheel), and eight substances that bring good fortune (bkra shis rdzasbrgyad) (mirror, ghiwang medicine, yogurt, durva grass, bilva fruit, conch shellswirled clockwise, cinnabar, and white mustard seeds).34. In the three higher initiations, pristine awareness is induced directly: in thesecret initiation as result of self-blessing; in the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation as a result of the bliss arising from the melting of the seminalessence while in union with a consort; and in the word initiation, through thegreat bliss of non-emission (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows [sDom’grel/ sDom pa gsum rnam par nges pa’i ’grel pa legs bshad ngo mtshar dpag bsam gyisnye ma], f. 200b2-5). Moreover, there is a particular manner in which each of thefour initiations (vase, secret, pristine awareness-through-wisdom, and word)induces the pristine awareness of great bliss (which “protects” the mind fromconceptualization and the propensity for emission of seminal fluid or dispersedbliss): slow, proximate, very close, and swift (f. 201a1-3).35. Dharmashri states that pledges that are empowered for safeguarding throughthe central phase of the initiation are assumed with a verbal promise and arenominal (btags pa ba) mantric vows. Those pledges assumed with an understand-ing of pristine awareness while one is being initiated are actual or authentic(mtshan nyid pa) mantric vows. One could therefore say that the initiation nur-tures and makes powerful the pristine awareness that is naturally present inoneself. With such pristine awareness acting as antidote, one overcomes the fac-tors to be purified that coexist with pristine awareness. Even though pristineawareness may not actually arise during the initiation, the initiation leaves apotency for its manifestation. The placing of such potency is the beginning ofthe purification of impurities and development of qualities, and as such, is tan-tamount to the transformation in the mind known as “ripening of the mind,”“being initiated,” or “assuming the vows and pledges.” This aspect of the seedof the mind’s virtuous qualities being nurtured through the initiation proce-dure, being the factor that holds the three secret vajras of all buddhas, is knownas “pledge.” Being a binding factor for one’s own mind, it is known as “vow.”(Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 202a2-b1).36. Kongtrul, citing the Essence of Pristine Awareness, states that in the ConductTantra there are five initiations: water, diadem, vajra, bell, and name. However,the Vairochana-abhisambhodi Tantra mentions only the water initiation and the"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 453permissions through the [golden] chirurgical spoon (gser gyi thur ma’i dbang),the mirror (me long gyi dbang), and the authorization to teach the doctrine (chosbshad pa’i dbang) (IOK, vol. II, p. 594).Pema Karpo describes the water initiation and the permissions: Holding a pre-cious vase filled with jewels and medicines, the master initiates disciples with thewater of the vase; the disciples imagine they receive the blessings of thebodhisattvas, Samantabhadra, Maitreya, Sarvaranivishkambi, and others. Themaster, while uttering encouraging words, then holds a golden chirurgical spoon(used to remove cataracts) in front of each disciple’s eyes to symbolize that all thebuddhas are removing the ignorance of the disciple’s mind. Holding up a mirror,the master explains the characteristics of phenomena: “All things are like a reflec-tion, limpid and unpolluted, and cannot be grasped by or expressed in words.Arising from causes and actions, they lack an intrinsic nature and are withoutstability. Understand all phenomena to be like that, and accomplish unfailinglythe welfare of others!” Placing the wheel which symbolizes the Buddhist teach-ings below the disciple’s foot and a fine conch shell in the left hand, the masterauthorizes the disciple to teach the Conduct Tantra (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 50b5-51b4).37. In the Yoga Tantra, the irreversible initiation (avaivartik›bhi ̋eka, phyir mi ldogpa’i dbang) is known as the vajra-master initiation (vajr›c›ry›bhi ̋eka, rdo rje slobdpon gyi dbang). It is added to the five initiations of the Conduct Tantra (IOK vol.II, Book VI, chapter IV, p. 603).38.

Three vajras (rdo rje gsum): the adamantine body, speech, and mind of thedeity.43.

See note 32.46. Pema Karpo defines skill in means in this context as the personal experienceof immutable bliss (mi ’gyur ba’i bde ba), which has the unmodified nature of theGreat Seal (mah›mudr›, phyag rgya chen po) and transcends conceptual medita-tions. This immutable bliss cannot be expressed in words; it is free of the con-ceptual processes of exclusion and restriction to categories of subject and object,shape, etc.Wisdom, the emptiness comprehensive of all aspects (shes rab rnam bcas), re-fers to the Great Seal which generates immutable bliss. It is the supreme empti-ness which, being free of cognizable aspects, is comprehensive of all aspects; itpossesses the forms of the universe as mirror divination images, images that arenot made of subtle or gross particles but are simply the mind’s projections (TV,vol. Ca, ff. 178b5-179a1).Kongtrul notes that although in some tantric systems immutable bliss is pos-ited as relative (kun rdzob) since it has to be realized through the relative meansof melting the seminal essence, in the uncommon categories of the KalachakraTantra (to which Kongtrul is referring here), immutable bliss is termed “ulti-mate truth” (don dam bden pa) because it lacks the fabrication of a perceiver andan object perceived, etc. For this reason, the pledge concerning the immutablebliss is here called the ultimate pledge (don dam pa’i dam tshig).The great seal of empty forms comprehensive of all supreme aspects (rnam pakun gyi mchog dang ldan pa’i stong gzugs phyag rgya chen po) is termed relativetruth (kun rdzob bden pa) because it is the very nature of every relative phenom-enon while its appearances are similar to those of relative phenomena them-selves. For this reason, the pledge concerning emptiness is called relative (kunrdzob pa’i dam tshig) (IOK, vol. III, pp. 218-219).47.Two-Part Hevajra Tantra, f. 16b4-5.48. Kongtrul explains that this vow is said to be the vow of all buddhas becauseit has the nature of the inseparability of great compassion and emptiness whichis the pristine awareness of all buddhas, the realization of the reality of all things.It is called vow (sa ̇vara, lit. “bound”) because supreme bliss, the nature of allthings, is perfectly gathered or bound by all buddhas. It is found in the aspect ormeaning of E, which stands for wisdom, and VA±, which stands for skill inmeans, and it is the great innate bliss which is the aspect or meaning of EVA±.

Pema Karpo states that to abandon the correct view on the conventional (be-lief in the law of causality) is to adopt a nihilistic view. To renounce the ThreeJewels amounts to abandoning the Buddhist teachings, while to forsake the con-ventional (relative) mind of awakening would amount to rejecting the UniversalWay. To reject the initiation is to forsake the Indestructible Way (TV, vol.

This pledge is called basic because it isthe vow common to both Buddhists and non-Buddhists who wish to attain higherstatus within cyclic existence. The second pledge is not to venerate deities otherthan the Three Jewels, a pledge exclusive to those who have entered the Bud-dhist doctrine. The third pledge forms the special basis for the Secret Mantra.The fourth means not to have received the initiation, or to reject it, in which caseone cannot be called a mantric adept (Commentary on the Guide to Mantra[Mantr›vat›rav ̧tti; sNgags la ’jug pa’i ’grel ba] [Toh. 3719], f. 206a1-7).59.Summary of Pledges (Dam tshig thams cad bsdus pa) (Toh. 3725) (by Ashva-ghosha), f. 45a4.

Pema Karpo enumerates the five deeds of immediate retribution: to kill asaint, one’s father, or one’s mother, to create a schism in a harmonious monasticcommunity, and out of malice to cause a buddha to bleed. Five deeds almost asserious as those of immediate retribution are to destroy a reliquary of the Bud-dha, to kill a bodhisattva, to engage a nun who has extinguished her emotionsin sexual intercourse, to kill a person who is on the path of training, and to stealthe belongings of the monastic community. If the practitioner were to commitany of these, he would be reborn in the hell of Unceasing Torture for an eon. Inthis life, even if he were to apply himself earnestly to tantric practice to achievethe powers of the Secret Mantra, he would not attain them (TV, vol. Ca, f. 31a1-b2).65. The offense of harming the Three Jewels: to squander or burn scriptures con-taining the teachings of the Joyful One (Buddha), or to throw them into a riverout of malice; to reject the reality dimension of awakening; to kill a monk or anun endowed with all the levels of monastic ordination; to kill a male or femalelay practitioner; or to set a temple on fire out of malice (TV, vol.

The Buddha, he states, refers to awakening andthe omniscient ones; the teachings, scriptural transmission and spiritual accom-plishment; and the community, the eight great [kinds of] persons (those whoabide in the result of stream-enterer, etc.) and bodhisattvas on the irreversiblepath (TV, vol. Ca, f. 15b).70. Pema Karpo explains these three kinds of “mantra” as follows: Tantras maybe classified as six or three. The three classes are secret mantras (guhyamantra,gsang sngags), awareness mantras (vidy›mantra, rig sngags), and recollection man-tras (dh›ra ̊ı mantra, gzungs sngags). Secret mantras are primarily the tantras thatexpound the method aspect or the male deity. Awareness mantras are primarilythe tantras that expound the wisdom aspect or female deity. Recollection man-tras are part of both secret and awareness mantras as they serve as means torecollect or not to forget the import of these two after one has understood them.Recollection mantras can also be understood as tantra including both male andfemale aspects of one tantra.In the ultimate sense, these “mantras” represent the indivisibility of skillfulmeans and wisdom. They are called secret mantras since they represent knowl-edge of the principle of indestructibility, i.e., indivisible pristine awareness, andsince they serve as protection for living beings and one’s own mind. They arecalled awareness mantras because they remove ignorance and thus impart aware-ness. They are called recollection mantras since they symbolize the tantras ofindivisible method and wisdom (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 16b5-17a4).See also IBTS, p. 116, n. 18. On the different ways of positing the three man-tras, see Jnanashri’s Dispelling the Two Extremes in the Indestructible Way (rDo rjetheg pa’i mtha’ gnyis sel ba) (Toh. 3714), f. 117a6-7.71. The master in this case is the one from whom the disciple has received thetantra, who should be regarded as the Buddha himself (TV, vol. Ca, f. 18a4-5).72. Deities whose worship is shared by other practitioners (thun mong sgrub pa’ilha) refers to worldly or transworldly deities that are not the specific focus ofone’s practice, the worldly ones worshiped also by non-Buddhists. (KarmaNgedön Nyingpo’s Commentary on Ngari Panchen’s Three Vows [henceforth citedas CNPTV], f. 69b4.)73. On this pledge, Pema Karpo cites the following from the Subahu Tantra (TV,vol. Ca, f. 22b1-4):Even in fear, one should not worship Indra, Vishnu,Or the wrathful Deity of Wind,Or rely on their doctrines.Do not engage in their ascetic practices, never offer to them.Without feeling defiant of their doctrines,Never take delight in their activities;Do not recite their hymns or incantations.74. On this pledge, Pema Karpo states: If you are tired of recitation (tantric prac-tice), to purify your past evil deeds, read the scriptures, or in a clean and isolated"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"458 Buddhist Ethicsplace, build reliquaries of the Joyful One. To the relics or the reliquaries housingthem, offer with great faith praises, garlands, perfumes, lights, parasols, stan-dards, banners, and music. In these and other ways, a mantric adept shouldcultivate merit (TV, vol. Ca, f. 19a1-5).75. Sitting with the body straight and unmovingly watching the senses, the adeptengages in recitation of mantra. This should not be too fast (in order not to omitsyllables), not too slow (not to become distracted), not too loud (a sign of excite-ment), not too low (a sign of torpor), not while speaking (since the words of themantras are blessed by the joyful ones; therefore, it is improper to mix themwith ordinary speech), not while distracted by some object (other than the formof the deity, the letters of the mantra, or its sound), and not without reverence(for the visualization or sound of the recitation). The Subahu Tantra states:A man who does not hold the sword properly,Grasping it by its edge, will likely cut his hand.Likewise, a mantrin who does not recite mantras correctlyEither attains no result or is defeated.Setting the mind single-pointedly in a continuous state of awareness, the mantrinshould make the mind pliable; with such pliability, he or she will accomplishwithout obstacles the powers coming from recitation of mantra (TV, vol. Ca, ff.19a4-20b2).76. Pema Karpo states that to maintain the pledges of the other families meansto observe the pledges of the deities of the three [main Action Tantra families],the pledges of their rites, the pledges in relation to attainments reached throughthese rites, and exclusive pledges particular to an individual, according to thetantras of each [deity] (TV, vol. Ca, f. 20b3-5).77. The seals (phyag rgya) in the Action Tantra refer mainly to hand gestures.78. Pema Karpo explains that to remain peaceful means to transform attach-ment by viewing the body as impure, to transform anger by using the moistureof love and compassion, and to transform stupidity by applying knowledge ofthe interdependence of phenomena. To transform attachment when the object isanother person, one reflects upon the changing nature of relationships (some-times, even an enemy may become one’s friend; one’s friend may become anenemy; similarly, someone who was neutral may become friend or enemy). Set-ting aside exaggerated liking for friends, a mantric adept should rest the mindrelaxedly in a virtuous state and transform emotions by pondering upon theselflessness of phenomena:Things do not exist before they arise.Neither are they created by Ishvara,Nor do they arise without causes.Beings arise from actions and emotions.Form is composed of the five elements;These are not the self, and the self does not possess them.There neither is self in form, nor does self have form.Form is empty, as are the other aggregates.Form is like froth,"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 459And feeling, like bubbles on water.To see things in this way is the correct view.Seeing them differently is a perverse view (TV, vol. Ca, f. 21a1-b5).79. The practitioner should eat at the appropriate time, wash three times a day,and offer to the deity garlands of flowers, lights, incense, and perfumes, but notmeat or alcohol. Then, sitting on a mat of kuŸa grass, he engages in meditation.With the knowledge of the purity of the body and assuming the purificatory fastprecepts for one, two, or three days, he should fast and dedicate himself to themeditation (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 21b5-22a5).80. Not to invent mantras or rites even for the sake of defeating an evil person(TV, vol. Ca, f. 22b4-6).81. Pema Karpo specifies that a mantric adept should not perform fierce riteswith the perverse wish to hinder someone’s efforts in performing rites to gainsupernatural powers. As part of this pledge, a practitioner should not performrites that include striking the dagger while reciting fierce mantras in a place thatis inhabited by n›gas or a similar class of beings (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 23a2-24a4).82. A mantrin must not perform tantric activities to compete with or to injure orkill another (TV, vol. Ca, f. 24a4-b2).83. A master should reveal the mandala, initiate, and transmit the secret instruc-tions, which are the seals of mantra, only to disciples who have made the pledgesand can preserve them. Disciples who have not made the pledges are not autho-rized to see the mandala of the deity or to receive the initiation. If a master wereto give them the secret instructions and they to follow them, unfortunate conse-quences would befall both. Even though they may already know tantric proce-dures, disciples who do not honor the master are not to be taught the tantras(TV, vol. Ca, ff. 44b2-45a).84. Concerning this pledge, Pema Karpo cites the following words of the SusiddhiTantra:Do not eat or destroyWhat resembles [ritual] weaponsOr, likewise, sentient beings,Or resembles tantric symbols.Neither should a good mantrinDegrade medicinesBy making them dirtyOr stepping on them,Or ride chariots,Crush lotus flowers,Or touch with the feetLeftover food (TV, vol. Ca, f. 25a4-b2).85. Not to be unrestrained in body, speech, and mind with regard to food andbehavior. Pema Karpo cites the Susiddhi Tantra as follows:Even a learned lay practitioner of MantraShould not wear clothes dyed his preferred color."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"460 Buddhist EthicsNever should he wear continuouslyOld and smelly clothes...and:Or eat food from the back of a leaf.A learned practitioner should neither eat foods that cause attachmentNor eat while sitting on a bed or seat.A wise practitioner should not lie downWith unclean people,Or lie supine or on the back.He should not eat repeatedly,Too little or too much,Nor should he eat too fast,Or eat food he has some suspicion about (TV, vol.

According to Pema Karpo, these include foods made into unsuitable shapes(a tantric symbol, etc.), meat, alcohol, mountain garlic, garlic, onions, oil fromseeds (like mustard oil), sesame, radish, and foods (torma) offered to the deity.On this pledge, the Susiddhi states:A mantrin who wishes to attain powersShould abstain from rubbing the bodyWith oils from seeds,Or eating sesame,Radish, onions, salts,Any kind of sour drink,Gourd or round peas,And also cooked beans,Sesame dough, and gingerbread.A mantrin should also renounceAll devious foodsAnd those [offered] as torma,Milk rice soup with black sesame and beans,Or plain milk rice soup.The Subahu Tantra states:I declare that the foods for the mantrinAre the three sweet foods [honey, molasses, sugar],Roots, stalks, fruits, greens,Curd, barley, milk, ghee,Oil from unrefined grains, whey, boiled milk, and broths(TV, vol. Ca, f. 26a2-b3).87. Not to feel loving-kindness in particular for those who are suffering and ingeneral toward all creatures (TV, vol. Ca, f. 26b5-6).88.

Not to feel contempt or dislike for oneself. Pema Karpo cites the Subahu Tantra,which states:Just as to cure and heal a woundSick persons are given medication,In order that mantrins not suffer from hunger,The Buddha said that they should not reject food.and:[However,] the body is [essenceless] as a small banana.Thus, do not become attached to foods or to similar things (TV, vol.

Pema Karpo cites the Subahu Tantra, which states:Do not revile others.and:The wise do not argueWith the followers of the Universal Way.Upon hearing of powerful bodhisattvas,They do not disgrace them,Or challenge a practitioner of Mantra.and:A mantrin should not quarrelWith non-Buddhists, etc. (TV, vol. Ca, f. 28b1-3).92.

Concerning this vow, Pema Karpo cites the Subahu Tantra:A practitioner should never goWhere young cows and calves are living,Where people drink alcoholOr engage in wrongful sex,Where people eat dog meat during festivities,Where many people gather,Or where music is played (TV, vol. Ca, f. 29a4-b4).94. The three Supramundane (or Principal) and the three Worldly (or Auxiliary)families of the Action Tantra: the Supramundane families are the Tathagata Fam-ily, the Lotus Family, and the Vajra Family, the highest, middling, and lowest,respectively. The three Worldly families are the Wealth Family, the Ox (ba glang),also called Prosperity Family (or Yaksha of Wealth Family), and the Family ofWorldlings (TV, vol. Ca, f. 39b4-5). The secret mantras or awareness mantras of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and thedifferent worldly gods are subsumed under three families: the Tathagata, theLotus, and the Vajra Family, and also under the Wealth Family, the ProsperityFamily, and the Family of the Worldlings.The Tathagata Family represents the knowledge of the ultimate nature of allthings and “going the way the buddhas have gone.” The Lotus Family repre-sents the compassion of Avalokiteshvara who sees all sentient beings during thesix times of the day and night with his eye of compassion undefiled by passions.The Vajra Family represents the protection of the Buddhist teachings and de-struction of elements hostile to them."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 463The Wealth Family represents the elimination of the plague of poverty byShri Manibhadra and other deities.

The Wealth Family is included in theLotus Family; the Prosperity, in the Vajra Family; and the Family of the World-lings, principally, in the Lotus and Vajra. Only families included in these princi-pal and auxiliary families have arisen from the blessing of the Tathagata (Com-mentary on the Questions of Subahu Tantra [Sub›huparip ̧cch›-nam›-tantra-pi ̊ ̃›rthav ̧tti; dPung bzangs kyis zhus pa’i rgyud kyi bsdus pa’i don dgrol ba’i brjedbyang] [Toh. 2673], ff. 101a3-102b1).95.

To forsake the scriptural teachings and the teachings as spiritual accom-plishment and to be irreverent toward the teachers who expound them (TV, vol.Ca, f. 56b6).102. Pema Karpo specifies that these are pledges of the causal stages [leading toawakening]. First, the vow of the “mind of entering” is to restrain from polluteddeeds that are the creative cause of the polluted aggregates of body, speech, andmind, and so forth. Thus, such a vow consists in a promise not to engage indeeds that are the cause of birth in the cycle of existence. The bodhisattva prac-tices the tantra on the basis of such ethics in order to approach the great pledge."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"464 Buddhist EthicsThe vow of “abiding [awakening] mind” refers to the formation of the awak-ening mind in accordance with the very state of awakening, i.e., by remaining inthe very nature of one’s mind as the experiential path. The bodhisattva engagesin the tantra by way of the realization of the equality of all phenomena, as he orshe understands that mind is unborn from the beginning, has the nature of emp-tiness, lacks substance, has no characteristics, location, or impediments, and isbeyond all conceptual fabrications.The vow of the “mind of involvement” refers to the awakening mind thatdoes not remain absorbed in the utterly non-conceptual reality although under-standing such reality just as it is, but wishes to guide all beings to the sameenlightened state devoid of inherent characteristics, free from all fabrications,and lacking any objective reference, that oneself has attained. This state is itselfthe great pledge (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 52b5-54b1).103. Pema Karpo states that proclaimers and solitary sages do not train in greatcompassion or in the wisdom of understanding phenomenal selflessness (choskyi bdag med), and for this reason, are said to lack skill in means and wisdom.Although they are possessed of the skill in means and wisdom spoken of in theway of the perfections, [they lack] the wisdom distinguished by understandingphenomena to be primordially unborn (chos thams cad gdod ma nas ma skyes pa).Their skill in means is confined to engagement in the six perfections such asgenerosity, free from conceptualizing the giver, gift, and giving by viewing themas if they were a magical creation. They lack, however, the skill in means taughtin the Conduct Tantra of manifesting oneself in three aspects: the deity as form(gzugs kyi lha), deity as letters (yi ge’i lha), and deity as symbols (phyag rgya’i lha)(TV, vol. Ca, ff. 57b4-58a3).104. The complete recitation is as follows:Just as the protectors throughout the three timesMade their vows to awaken,I now form the sacred and unsurpassedResolve to become enlightened.To honor the [transcendent family’s] pledgesOf the yoga of the buddhas,I will firmly observe the three forms of ethics:The ethics of restraint, acquiring good qualities,And working for the welfare of all beings;Henceforth, I will commit myselfTo the unsurpassable Triple Jewel,The Buddha, his teachings, and the community.To honor the pledgesOf the supremely great vajra family,I will commit myself to the vajra, bell, seal,And also to the master.To honor the gracious pledgesOf the supremely great jewel family,"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 465I will always practice the four kinds of generosityDuring the six times of the day and night.To honor the pledges of the supremely pure lotus familyBorn from the great awakening,I will persevere in the sacred teachingsOf the outer, inner, and secret [tantras] and the three spiritual ways.To honor the pledges of the supreme great action family,I will maintain impeccablyAll types of pledgesAnd exert myself in making offerings.For the sake of all beingsI resolve to attain the sacredAnd unsurpassable awakeningAnd will maintain all vows.I shall liberate those not liberated [from the impediment to omniscience],I shall release those not released [from cyclic existence],I shall relieve those unrelieved [in unfortunate existences]And set sentient beings in the state of perfect peace.(Anandagarbha’s Illumination of Reality [Sarvatath›gatatattvasa ̇grahamah›-y›n›bhisamayan›matantra-tattv›lokakarın›mavy›ky›; De bzhin gshegs pa thams cadkyi de kho na nyid bsdus pa theg pa chen po mngon par rtogs pa zhes bya ba’i rgyud kyibshad pa de kho na nyid snang bar byed pa] [Toh. 2510], vol Shi, f. 115b2-6.)105.Discussing the five families (pañcakula, rigs lnga) in the context of Yoga Tantra,Pema Karpo explains: Ku in kula is related to kutsi, meaning “bad” (ngan pa); andla, to laya, meaning “to enter” (thim pa). The families are of two kinds, inferior(dman pa) and supreme (mchog).To the inferior families belong beings who have entered (thim pa) bad exist-ences (ngan ’gro) as a result of their negative emotions. Beings who have goodcharacters and whose emotions are in equal strength belong equally to all the fivefamilies. Beings who have a preponderance of attachment (’dod chags) belong tothe Transcendent or Tathagata family (tath›gatakula, de bzhin gshegs pa’i rigs); be-ings who have a preponderance of hatred (zhe sdang), to the vajra family (vajrakula,rdo rje’i rigs); beings who have a preponderance of avarice (ser sna), to the jewelfamily (ratnakula, nor bu’i rigs); beings who have a preponderance of stupidity(gti mug), to the lotus family (padmakula, pad ma’i rigs); and beings who have apreponderance of laziness (le lo), to the action family (karmakula, las kyi rigs).To the supreme or adamantine (vajra, rdo rje) families belong enlightened be-ings, buddhas, and the bodhisattvas who have transcended lower destinies, arefree of the impediments of inferior families, and serve as antidotes to the emo-tions of the inferior families. These families fit the above etymology becausethey are the families of those [buddhas and bodhisattvas] who, by the force oftheir compassion for others, have entered (thim pa) bad existences (ngan ’gro).The supreme families are those of the five transcendent ones: Vairochana,Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi. They are transcen-dent families because they are of the nature of all the transcendent ones."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"466 Buddhist EthicsThe deities who have emanated from these five buddhas to counteract therespective emotions also belong to one of the transcendent (de gzhin gshegs pa),vajra (rdo rje), jewel (nor bu), lotus (pad ma), or action (las) families (TV, vol. Ca, ff.64a1-65b1).106. Pema Karpo here enumerates four pledges: of the vajra, of the bell, of theseal, and of the master. The vajra (vajra, rdo rje) represents the skillful means(thabs) or mind of awakening, and the bell (gha ̊ ̨›, dril bu) represents wisdomknowing reality. Not to forsake skillful means and wisdom and to apply them isthe nature of the two pledges. The seal is the great seal (mah›mudr›, phyag rgyachen po), which consists in the contemplation of the deity’s form as the insepara-bility of emptiness and vivid appearance.The word seal (mudr›, phya rgya) is related to mod›n›ta, “to please,” and tomudr›na, “to seal” (TV, vol. Ca, f. 80a6-b5). Mudra is thus a seal because it“pleases” the deity’s mind or because it “seals” by swift accomplishment of thedesired goal and benefits by protecting others. Its synonyms are attribute (mtshanma), sign (rtags), and proximate characteristics (nye ba’i mtshan nyid) (ibid., ff.85a3-4 and 91a5).The master (›c›rya, slob dpon) is the very cause of the pristine awareness ofreality (ibid., f. 85a5).107. The mantra here refers to the tantras and their observances. See note 112for a discussion of seals.108. According to Pema Karpo, this refers to eating or stepping over food that isin the shape of the deity’s insignia, such as a wheel, vajra, lotus, weapon, etc.(TV, vol. Ca, f. 90a5).109. Not to reveal the contents of the initiation one has received (TV, vol. Ca, f.59b5).110.

Considered to be theoriginal tantra of the Conduct Tantra class.112. A reference to the four seals in Yoga Tantra. Padmavajra explains that “seal”(mudr›) signifies the power to gladden or to make an impression. It is “gladden-ing” because of its ability to please the exalted ones; it is a seal because it cannotbe erased and swiftly grants the desired goal. It is also called “attribute” (nimitta,mtshan ma) since it issues from pristine awareness and is [linked to] the concep-tion of an attribute. It is a “sign” (liºga, rtags) by virtue of having the nature ofthe great pristine awareness or issuing from its blessing. It is a “proximate char-acteristic” (upalak ̋a ̊a, nye ba’i mtshan nyid) because it points to pristine aware-ness or because through it one enters into the state of pristine awareness.

Since it serves as the pre-eminent ground for vividly contemplating the modeof being of the deity by way of his or her form, it is called the great seal (f. 94b5-6). The seal of the pledge is the blessing of the seal of pristine awareness pos-sessed with perfect qualifications which reveals the mode of the deity’s mind asthe seal of the fully liberated mind. Since the deities do not transcend [pristineawareness], it is called the seal of the pledge (f. 95a1-2).The seal of the teachings comprises the terms used in the teachings such as“indestructible pristine awareness” (vajrajñ›na), “symbolic being” (samayasattva),etc., which are the attributes or signs of pure buddha speech, and reveal themode of the speech of the deity. This seal imparts the ultimate teachings of thedeity’s words (f. 95a4-5). The action seal comprises the deity’s actions and reveals the mode of theseactions which are of two kinds: bound and imagined. The first has the character-istics of the seal of supreme enlightenment or gesture of the hands separatedand forming two “vajra fists” (with the thumbs at the roots of the ring fingers)and other gestures. The second is the four-pronged vajra imagined at one’s heartwhose nature reveals that at the time of accomplishing a particular deity theenlightened activity of that deity pervades everything (f. 95a6-7).For an exhaustive discussion of the four seals in the Yoga Tantra system, seeIBTS, pp. 223-249.113.

In the stage of comple-tion of all Highest Yoga tantras, these are the means to accomplish the pristineawareness of the union of bliss and emptiness.Abhayakaragupta’s Cluster of Secret Instructions (Sa ̇pu ̨atantrar›ja ̨ık›mn›ya-mañjarı; Man ngag snye ma/ dPal yang dag par sbyor ba’i rgyud kyi rgyal po’i rgyacher ’grel pa man ngag gi snye ma) (Toh. 1198) differentiates the four seals interms of the phases of creation and completion and their result. Kongtrul pro-vides the following summary of Abhayakara’s discussion: In the phase of cre-ation, the action seal is the meditation on the form of a female deity (devı). Theseal of the teachings is the arrangement of the letter [HU±, etc., in one’s heart].The seal of the pledge is the marvelous activity of emanation and withdrawalof light [and the circle of the deities of the mandala from the seed syllable atone’s heart], etc. The great seal is the inseparability of appearance and empti-ness of the form of the deity.In the phase of completion, the action seal is a real consort (vidy›, rig ma).Since she bestows joy through the act of embracing, etc., she is called “actionseal.” The great seal is the central channel (avadhÒtı) since it bestows the special"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 469innate joy. The pristine awareness of the inseparability of great bliss and empti-ness is the seal of the teachings since it is the mind of unsurpassable awakening.The imaginary consort appearing as a female deity is the seal of the pledge.At the level of the result, the manifest dimension of awakening is the seal ofthe pledge. The dimension of great bliss is the great seal. The reality dimensionof awakening (dharmak›ya) is the seal of the teachings, and the enjoyment di-mension of awakening is the action seal (IOK, vol. II, pp. 687-689).Pema Karpo defines these four seals based on Naropa’s explanations: Theaction seal is the cause, the undegenerated unborn bliss which arises from theunion with a consort. The seal of the teachings refers to meditation with an imagi-nary consort. After having transformed the ordinary body into the deity’s form,the yogin imagines uniting with her. This makes the fire of wisdom blaze, theHAM at the crown of the head melt, and the seminal essence flow through thechakras to the tip of the jewel. The yogin’s faculties, their objects, etc., becomethe nature of bodhichitta, unmixed, but of one flavor with great bliss. One shouldabide in this meditation until the glorious great seal is realized. The great seal isthe goal to be attained by embracing the great seal that has the nature of a dream,an optical illusion, etc., until the seal of the pledge is actualized. The seal of thepledge is the spontaneously present, supreme, and unchangeable nature (TV,vol. Ca, f. 190b2).126. The symbolic (choma, brda) behavior, consisting in physical and verbal signs,is performed at the time a yogin (or yogini) undertakes the special conduct ofawareness so that yogins and yoginis can recognize each other or in order torecognize the consort who will assist one in tantric conduct. Another purposeserved is that the adept does not incur the root downfall of “disclosing secrets”during a tantric feast or other activity that may be attended by people who lackthe tantric pledges (Kongtrul’s Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, ff. 103b3-104a4).For a full discussion, see Kongtrul’s Commentary, ff. 103b3-108b4; and TheSaªvarodaya-Tantra, Selected Chapters, trans. S. Tsuda (Tokyo: Hokuseido Press,1974) chapter IX.127. See Saªvarodaya-Tantra, Selected Chapters, chapter XXI.128. Conduct of the left (g.yon pa’i kun spyod) refers to the special observance ofMother tantras of initiating any physical movement or activity with the left sideof the body in order to recollect emptiness which, of the two aspects of skill inmeans (right) and wisdom (left), pertains to wisdom.129. In discussing the meaning of seminal essence (bindu, thig le), Kongtrul writes:Seminal essence (thig le), tilaka in Sanskrit, means “nucleus or seed of great bliss.”Seminal essence comprises two aspects: the conventional (relative) (kun rdzob) semi-nal essence, and the ultimate “seminal essence” of pristine awareness (don dam yeshes kyi thig le). In this context, seminal essence denotes the first, which is a sub-stantial seminal essence (rdzas kyi thig le), having a white and red part. The mainseminal essences number thirty-six, existing throughout the body’s channels (rtsa),twelve pure (dvangs ma) and twenty-four impure (snyigs ma); the secondary onesare very numerous. These seminal essences are like wealth owned by the winds.The pure part of the white (dkar cha) substantial seminal essence abides in the"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"470 Buddhist Ethicsupper extremity of the central channel (dbu ma’i yar sna) in the nature of theletter HAM. The pure part of the red (dmar cha) seminal essence abides belowthe navel at the juncture of the three channels (left, right, and central) in theaspect of a small letter A that has the nature of heat. The white part is calledglory (dpyid) since it yields bliss; and the red part, vital essence (thig le) sincebliss depends on it. As the seminal essence is the “place” where awakening isactualized, it is called the indestructible seat (vajr›sana, rdo rje gdan).Supported by these pure seminal essences are the impure ones which alsohave pure and impure components. The pure component produces physicalstrength and radiance, while the impure part flows out from the orifices (IOK,vol. II, pp. 641-644).130. The mother tantras, in particular the Chakrasamvara, emphasize the prac-tice of wandering throughout special localities known as power places (pı ̨ha,gnas) so that the yogin can summon, meet, and practice with three types of em-issaries (dÒtı, pho nya) who are at different levels of realization. These emissariesare mantra-born (sngags skyes), field-born (zhing skyes), and innate (lhan skyes).The innate are exalted beings who reside in the pure land of Superior (Akani ̋ ̨ha),the enjoyment dimension of enlightenment manifesting in the form of goddesses.The field-born abide in unsurpassable contemplation and manifest as yoginis inthe thirty-two power places. The mantra-born are trained in the mantric pathand are born in the central region [India] or in other places.To begin with, the yogin relies on the mantra-born in order to assemble thefield-born, and then relies on both. Finally, the yogin can meet the innate emis-saries and achieve the highest realization.A woman can be trained “to be the receptacle for” (to become) the three kindsof emissaries. Such a woman, on whom the yogin relies during the phases of cre-ation and completion of the tantra, should have confidence in the Secret Mantra,be mindful, have been initiated and have assumed the pledges in front of a masterbelonging to an authentic lineage, and be without attachment to sense pleasures.In addition, she must be able to generate great bliss and act as a condition for theyogin to realize blissful pristine awareness (Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, Book IX, chapterIII, “The Tantric Activities Enhancing Realization”; and Kongtrul’s Commentary onthe Hevajra Tantra, ff. 232b-233a2). See The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-TibetanEsotericism by Alex Wayman (New York, 1973; rpt. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1990),pp. 184-196, for its discussion of the three kinds of emissaries.131. The tantric conduct of daily service is prescribed in the Indestructible TentTantra (Æ›kinıvajrapañjaratantra; mKha’ ’gro ma rdo rje gur zhes bya ba’i rgyud) (Toh.419), ff. 64b5-65a1.132.

The Abhidana Tantra states:Whoever shows anger to the yogin who is the causeOf the accomplishment of all one’s desired goalsWill be reborn as a dog for a hundred lifetimesAnd then as a butcher (f. 334b1-2).137. The Abhidana Tantra states:Always wear the five symbolic ornamentsAnd skulls as ornaments on your head.Carry the skull-cup and the mystic staff,And smear your body with ash.Always eat the great flesh,And drink every kind [of spirit] to intoxication.Sit on corpsesWearing a pelt as garment.Consume the appropriate foods,And satisfy yourself with flesh and blood.Dwell in towns or isolated places.Whenever you wander around,Remain always without attachments.Continuously enjoy charnel groundsOr market gatherings.Do not stray into the place of proclaimers, worldly people,Or those without good fortune, who are full of ignorance and confusion,Or into monasteries where proclaimers live.Live like a destitute,While leading a bodhisattva’s life,Enjoying the indestructible dance.Always dwelling in cemeteries,Consuming feces and the great flesh,Drinking intoxicating liquors,Chief of the heroes, single-pointedlyRest in meditation (f. 251b4).138. For the remaining lines, see KT, p. 231.139. According to Naropa, they are known as evil (ill deeds) because they chainone to cyclic existence and destroy one’s goodness.

Dharmashri explains why the first four types of killing are listed separately:to clearly refute the view professed by religious extremists that in some casessuch killing may be meritorious (to sacrifice cattle to win a higher existence, forexample). “To destroy a reliquary” is placed separately not only to refute the"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"472 Buddhist Ethicsbarbaric view that to do this is an authentic spiritual practice but also to empha-size that this is an extremely negative act (Commentary on the Three Vows, ff. 267b5-268a4).141. The vajra or adamantine nature of body, speech, mind, and pristine aware-ness refers to the primordial nature of these four planes of individual existence.Through the union of special means (great bliss) and pristine awareness (empti-ness), the ordinary body, speech, and mind, and their propensities are purifiedas the enlightened body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness of a buddha.142. Secrets (gsang ba) of body, speech, and mind: their ultimate or primordialnature, or emptiness.143. Five symbolic bone ornaments (rus pa’i phyag rgya): the crown ornament,symbolizing Akshobhya and mirror-like pristine awareness; earrings, symbol-izing Amitabha and the pristine awareness of discernment; the necklace,symbolizing Ratnasambhava and the pristine awareness of equality; braceletsand anklets, symbolizing Vairochana and the pristine awareness of the sphereof reality; belt or ashes, symbolizing Amoghasiddhi and the aim-accomplishingpristine awareness.A variant introduces an additional ornament—the sacred thread worn bybrahmins—and points out the correspondence to the six perfections: the neck-lace represents generosity; bracelets and anklets, ethics; the earrings, patience;the crown ornament, diligence; the sacred thread, meditation; and the belt (orsacred ashes), discriminative wisdom.Kongtrul explains that these ornaments also symbolize the yogin’s or yogini’spledges: the yogin wears the crown ornament on the head in order not to forget topay homage to the vajra master who is “heavy” with qualities, the master whobestows the instructions, and the favored deity. The yogin wears the earrings as areminder to not despise the master, etc.; the necklace as a reminder to never strayfrom the inner and outer mantra recitations which protect the mind from objecti-fying conceptions; the bracelets and anklets as a symbol of the vow not to killcreatures; the belt to symbolize the binding of the seminal essence by relying onthe consort. According to the definitive meaning, the crown ornament symbolizesthe fixing of the seminal essence at the crown of the head and at the other focalpoints of energy (Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, ff. 289b1-290a2).See Wayman’s The Buddhist Tantras, pp. 118-122, for a brief discussion of thissubject.144. Quoted from Pundarika’s Stainless Light Commentary on the Kalachakra, To h .1347, vol. Da, f. 145a2.145. In the Kalachakra Tantra, the five meats (sha lnga), known as five lamps(sgron me lnga) or “stimulators” of the senses, refer to five outer and five innermeats. The outer meats are cow (ba glang), dog (khyi), horse (rta), elephant (glangpo che), and human (mi). The five inner meats are the five sense organs. The fivenectars (bdud rtsi lnga) refer to inner and outer nectars. The outer are excrement(dri chen), urine (dri chu), blood (khrag), semen (rdo rje’i zil pa), and human flesh(mi’i sha). The five inner are the five aggregates. The adept first dissolves the"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 473meats and nectars, purifies them by meditation on non-reality, then has themreappear, and finally transforms them into ambrosia. However, unless the adepthas the ability to actually perform this transformation, these substances do notcontribute to the attainment of the qualities of awakening (TV, vol. Ca, f. 163b5-6).146. Camphor (ga pur): a metaphor for the seminal fluid.147. Offerings are of two kinds: outer and inner. The outer are the offerings ofthe five sense objects, visual forms, etc., and the five nectars and the five meats,which satisfy the aggregates and elements of the body. The inner offerings arethe offerings of the aggregates, the senses, and their objects purified through theimmutable great bliss produced by retention of the seminal essence (TV, vol. Ca,f. 164a3-b6).148. The first seven Kalachakra initiations: water (toya ̋eka, chu’i dbang), diadem(mauli ̋eka; cod pan gyi dbang ), ribbon (pa ̨ ̨a ̋eka, dar dpyangs kyi dbang), vajra andbell (vajragha ̊ ̨› ̋eka, rdo rje dril bu’i dbang), conduct (vrata ̋eka, brtul zhugs kyidbang), name (n›ma ̋eka, ming gi dbang), and permission (›jñ›, rjes gnang) initia-tions. See Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the [Kalachakra] Initiation, ff.237a7-238b2.To these are added the higher and supremely high initiations: two vase(kalaŸa ̋eka, bum pa’i dbang), two secret (guhya ̋eka, gsang ba’i dbang), two pristine-awareness-through-wisdom (prajñ›jñ›na ̋eka, shes rab ye shes kyi dbang), and theprovisional word and the definitive word initiations (a total of fifteen, or elevenif the two last groups of four are counted as only one set of four). See KT, pp. 68-69 and 213-214.149. Single-pronged vajra (ekasÒkavajra, rdo rje rtse gcig), since its pledge is theone unique cause that produces the victorious ones (TV, vol. Ca, f. 163a5).150. Non-objectifying compassion and emptiness (mi dmigs pa’i snying rje dangstong pa nyid): the first refers to unchanging bliss, which is non-objectifying (midmigs pa) because it is devoid of the dualism of perceiver and perceived; the sec-ond, to supreme emptiness comprehensive of all aspects. See notes 156 and 157.151. See note 164.152. Empty image (stong gzugs) refers to the unique Kalachakra system of tantricpractice in which the material components of one’s body (seminal fluids, energywinds, and particles) are exhausted (dematerialized) and the empty images ofthe deities in union are achieved. Thus, the resultant union of bliss and emptinessin the Kalachakra refers to the union of immutable bliss and empty images (themale and female deities). See below, notes 156 and 157. See also Taranatha’s Mean-ingful to Behold, Practical Instructions on the Indestructible Yoga’s Profound Path (Zablam rdo rje’i rnal ’byor gyi ’khrid yig mthong ba don ldan), in Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé’sTreasury of Key Instructions (gDams ngag mdzod) (Delhi: N.

The five principal ones are vital (pr› ̊a, srog ’dzin),downward-clearing (ap›na, thur sel), balancing heat (sam›na, me mnyam), upward-moving (ud›na, gyen rgyu), and pervasive (vy›na, khyab byed); the five secondary"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"474 Buddhist Ethicsones, snake (n›ga, klu), turtle (kÒrma, rus sbal), chameleon (k ̧kara, rtsangs pa), giftof the gods (devadatta, lhas byin), and victorious through wealth (dhanañjaya, norlas rgyal). See Geshé Ngawang Dhargyey, A Commentary on the K›lacakra Tantra(Dharamsala: Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, 1985), pp. 117-120.154. Inner heat (ca ̊ ̃›lı). The Tibetan gtum mo is derived from the Sanskrit ca ̊ ̃›,meaning fierce. Ca ̊ ̃›lı is a female untouchable, which is one of the preferredconsorts of the adept. Being “untouchable” symbolizes the “ineffable” nature ofpristine awareness. At an inner level, untouchability represents the heat or pas-sion lying below the navel that, once aroused through relying on a consort orimaginatively, melts the seminal essence dormant at the crown of the head.As an auxiliary technique, “inner heat” (gtum mo) refers to a meditationwhereby the adept visualizes within his or her body the central, left, and rightchannels and the focal points of energy (cakra). Below the navel is visualized asyllable or a fine shape that is of the nature of fire. Then, in conjunction with thevase breathing that causes the winds of the left and right channels to convergeinto the central one, the fire of the inner heat rises within the central channel tomelt the white seminal essence, which is visualized either in the aspect of thesyllable HA± or as a seminal point at the crown of the head, causing the seminalessence to flow downward within the central channel to the tip of the sexualorgan, where it is then held and its course is reversed.For a discussion of the elaborate and simple forms of the inner heat tech-niques, see Taranatha’s Meaningful to Behold, ff. 135b3-137b2.155. The great seal of empty image (stong gzugs phyag rgya chen po): see notes 156and 157. On the “nominal causal” relationship between the great seal of emptyimage and the immutable bliss, see Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, pp. 213-221.156. Kongtrul states that immutable bliss (ak ̋arasukha, mi ’gyur bde ba) refers tointrinsic awareness, the expanse of blissful pristine awareness free from mentalfabrications which is the unity (gcig tu ’dres pa) of the changeless nature of realityand the bliss of the non-emitted seminal essence. Since this great bliss ends thesuffering of oneself and others, it is called great compassion.In the Kalachakra system, immutable bliss is termed “ultimate” due to theabsence of the conceptual fabrication of perceiver and perceived. The emptyimage comprehensive of all aspects, the great seal (stong gzugs phyag rgya chenpo), is termed “relative” because its appearances are similar to relative phenom-ena. Nevertheless, unchanging bliss and the emptiness comprehensive of allaspects are in fact one unity (IOK, vol. III, pp. 217-221).157. Kongtrul explains that the Kalachakra Tantra teaches the “emptiness en-dowed with the supreme aspects” (rnam kun mchog ldan gyi stong pa nyid) whichconstitutes the chief view of all the tantras. This emptiness alone is capable ofproducing supreme unchanging bliss. Of the three aspects of emptiness—thatof the ground, the path, and the result—this is an emptiness meditated upon onthe path. In the Kalachakra system, the supreme emptiness is called indefiniteemptiness (rnam par ma nges pa’i stong pa nyid) because the forms in which itmanifests are indefinite, being unlimited radiant awareness (’od gsal) and multi-colored images (viŸvabimba, sna tshogs gzugs brnyan). This emptiness is revealed"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 475after the manifestation of ten signs which are images of empty images (ŸÒnyata-bimba, stong nyid kyi gzugs) produced by the yogas of the day (nyin gyi rnal ’byor)and of the night (mtshan mo’i rnal ’byor).This quintessential emptiness has a nature like that of the visions in mirrordivination. It has all the appearances (rnam pa thams cad) of the three realms ofexistence, while its own nature is without real characteristics, not being com-posed of atoms and free of constructive thought. It is direct knowledge. It is theillusory appearance of supremely (mchog) radiant pristine awareness. Its qualityis expressed in its being the source of great bliss because if one meditates onsuch emptiness, it has the power to produce the pristine awareness of great bliss.The image of the supreme emptiness refers to the indivisibility of emptinessand compassion (IOK, vol. III, pp. 213-218).158. On this point, see the discussion in Naropa’s IK, pp. 76-80.159. The objects of the ten generosities.160. The five nectars and the five meats.161. Five supernatural knowledges (abhijñ›, mngon par shes pa): miraculous pow-ers ( ̧ddhi, rdzu ’phrul), divine eye (divyacak ̋us, lha’i mig), divine ear (divyaŸtrota,lha’i rna ba), knowing others’ thoughts (paracittajñ›na, gzhan sems shes pa), andrecollection of previous lives (pÒrvaniv›s›nusm ̧ti, sngon gnas rjes su dran pa). Asixth, the knowledge that causes the extinction of all pollutants (›sravak ̋ayaka-rajñ›na, zag zad mkhyen pa) in one’s mind stream, is commonly included.162. Bokar Rinpoché explains that according to the tantras, an evil person whothroughout his life harbors intense hatred for and constantly injures others, whenhe cannot be tamed by any other means, should be released (grol ba) from thefetters of his evil existence and his consciousness transferred to a pure buddharealm. This release serves the double purpose of saving the evil person fromrebirth in hell and relieving others and the world of his harmful presence. Theritual to perform this release can only be performed by a yogin of the highestattainment who meets the following requirements with regard to motivation,action, and result: Regarding the motivation, the yogin must have no self-interestwhatsoever and desire only the other person’s ultimate good. For the action, theyogin must effect the release through meditative absorption, mudra (hand ges-tures) and mantra, and never resort to the use of poison or weapons of any kind.In addition, the yogin must be able to resurrect the individual. For the result, theadept, using the power of meditation, must direct the consciousness of the per-son into a pure realm.Naropa states that until the yogin has gained the five clairvoyances, he mustabstain from all wrathful rites. Why? Because although the person who is theobject of the rite may have committed one of the five inexpiable deeds, later onhe may engage in virtuous acts. For example, King Ashoka was extremely cruelin the earlier period of his life, but then became a great protector of the Buddhistteachings. If one were to end such a person’s present existence, the consequenceswould be unfortunate. Therefore, to perform wrathful rites without foreknowl-edge of the karma of that person is prohibited (Commentary on the Summary of theKalachakra Initiation, f. 236a5-7)."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"476 Buddhist EthicsDharmashri, citing the Shimmering Light on the Pledges, enumerates ten recipi-ents of the effect of this rite (zhing bcu): an enemy of the Three Jewels who causesgreat harm to the teachings, in particular an enemy of a qualified spiritual mas-ter; practitioners who let their pledges deteriorate and do not restore them; thosewho reject the Secret Mantra after having entered its way; those who despise themaster or vajra siblings; those who, though unauthorized, participate in tantricactivities with the intention to steal; those who have harmed sentient beings;those who are fierce enemies of practitioners who honor their pledges; thosewho engage exclusively and continuously in evil actions; and those beings whoseevil actions would lead to rebirth in the three lower forms of life or who arecurrently experiencing the result of these actions in lower forms of life (Commen-tary on the Three Vows, ff. 261b5-262a5).For a discussion of the provisional and definitive meanings of the pledges ofthe different families, see KT, pp. 349-351.163. Kongtrul enumerates the twelve stages of awakening (bhumi, sa) in theKalachakra Tantra: Illuminating (samantaprabh›, kun tu ’od), the stage at whichthe darkness of impediments to omniscience are dispelled; Light of Nectar(am ̧taprabh›, bdud rtsi’i ’od), the stage associated with the passion of non-emittedbliss; Light of the Sky (›k›Ÿaprabh›, nam mkha’i ’od), the stage of seeing all phe-nomena as space; Adamantine Light (vajraprabh›, rdo rje’i ’od), the stage of afirm, altruistic mind, undivided by egoistic thoughts; Gem Light (ratnaprabh›,rin chen ’od), the stage of the pristine awareness of the initiation conferred by thedeity; Lotus Light (padmaprabh›, pad ma’i ’od), the stage of seeing the naturalpurity of the mind; Worker of the Buddhas (buddhakarmakarı, sangs rgyas kyi lasbyed pa), the stage of enacting the marvelous activity of emanating as buddhasand bodhisattvas; Incomparable (anupam›, dpe med pa), the stage of seeing thatpristine awareness cannot be described through examples; Example for All Ex-amples (upam›, dpe thams cad kyi dpe), the stage of knowing reasons and examplesfor every phenomenon; Wisdom Light (prajñ›prabh›, shes rab kyi ’od), the stage ofan immense expansion of intelligence with respect to any object of knowledge;Omniscience (sarvajñat›, thams cad mkhyen pa), the stage of the elimination of thepredispositions of the impediment to universal knowledge; Self-Experienced(praty›tmavedy›, so so’i bdag nyid rig pa), the stage of manifestation of the self-experienced pristine awareness.These twelve stages are simply twelve distinctions in the modes of pristineawareness. They are called stages (bhÒmi, sa) because they serve as the bases forthe gaining of higher realizations. These twelve are essentially the qualities ofthe buddhas; however, they are attained simultaneously with the initial mo-ment of the path of seeing. That moment corresponds to the end of the so-calledtwelve lesser stages found in relation to the last branch of the sixfold yoga, con-templation, when the adamantine rainbow body (’ja’ lus rdo rje sku) is attained.All of these twelve are present on each of the usual ten stages of awakening suchas Joyful (rab tu dga’ ba) and at the stage of a buddha. These twelve stages arequalities undifferentiated from buddha-nature (tath›gatagarbha, bde gshegs snyingpo) and exist spontaneously from the beginning of time. On the path of an ex-alted adept, these stages pertain to the path that removes impediments and are"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 477present in both equipoise and post-equipoise. At the level of a buddha, theseprimordial stages become actualized (Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, pp. 552-553). Seealso Naropa’s IK, p. 335.164. Naropa’s Commentary on the Summary of the Kalachakra Initiation defines en-lightened speech as the invincible sound that unceasingly manifests as the dif-ferent languages of infinite creatures, gods, humans, etc., to bestow the nectar ofthe teachings (f. 237b3); and the sound that imparts the teachings to all creaturesby manifesting itself as the sounds of all languages. Thus, the “lie” is the so-called invincible sound existing at the heart (f. 236b6-7).Naropa adds that the invincible sound is heard after the azure sphere, the lastof ten signs of the yoga of the day and night (belonging to the yoga of with-drawal), has appeared. Within that sphere, the image of the manifold enjoymentdimension of awakening, free of objectivity, appears. While the adept sees theseimages, he or she also hears the invincible sound. Thus, by virtue of the appear-ances of the image, there exists the manifest dimension (nirm› ̊ak›ya); and byvirtue of the appearance of sound, the enjoyment dimension of enlightenment(sa ̇bhogak›ya) (ff. 250b5-251a7).165. The first branch of the sixfold yoga (sbyor ba yan lag drug) practiced in thecompletion phase of the Kalachakra Tantra. The sixfold yoga consists of the fol-lowing branches: withdrawal (so sor sdud pa), meditative absorption (bsam gtan),control of the breath (srog rtsol), retention (’dzin pa), subsequent application (rjessu dran pa), and contemplation (ting nge ’dzin).Withdrawal (from the Sanskrit praty›h›ra, of which praty means individually,and ›h›ra, to withdraw) means to stop the interaction between the ordinary senseorgans and their objects by withdrawing the mental consciousness from its ref-erent; and to experience the five objects which are of the nature of radiant aware-ness and the five senses which are of the nature of pristine awareness. In brief,withdrawal means to withdraw the mind from ordinary appearances and en-gage in the appearances of pristine awareness.During withdrawal, the adept applies the yoga of the night (mtshan mo’i rnal’byor) and the yoga of the day (nyin mo’i rnal ’byor). The yoga of the night is prac-ticed in complete darkness, seated in cross-legged posture. The adept gazes, eye-balls turned upward, on the black space at a height of sixteen fingers above theeyebrows and remains free of any mental activity while mixing mind and winds.The yoga of the day is practiced in an isolated place, unseen by others, gazingdirectly into expansive, cloud-free space (in the morning, toward the west, andin the evening, toward the east), with the sun behind the shoulders. The mannerof meditation is the same as the one done in darkness. (With some exceptions,the same gaze is adopted in both the withdrawal and concentration parts of theyoga.) As a result of these yogas, the adept sees many indefinite signs of multi-colored images (sna tshogs gzugs brnyan); and the ten signs (rtags bcu) that mani-fest with defined aspects: the four during the night yoga of smoke, mirage, theluminosity of a very radiant and clear sky, and lamp; and the six during the dayyoga of a flame, the moon, the sun, a vajra (here, a black sphere), lightning, andan (azure) sphere. These are called signs because they indicate the ultimate pris-tine awareness’ presence within oneself, and because they constitute the basis"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"478 Buddhist Ethicsfor the confidence that by experientially cultivating the path, one will be able toactualize pristine awareness. The signs are not distorted illusions, but images ofemptiness (stong pa nyid kyi gzugs) perceived directly and unmistakenly.The second branch, meditative absorption (dhy›na, bsam gtan), also employsthe yoga of night and day and has the function of consolidating the empty im-ages or images of emptiness experienced in the withdrawal. In this yoga, in-stead of concentrating on space, the adept focuses on the empty images, with-out any discursive thought. Meditative absorption has five moments: concen-tration (rtse gcig sems), examination (rtog pa), analysis (dpyod pa), joy (dga’ ba),and bliss (bde ba). Concentration consists in the wisdom that is one-pointedlyconcentrated within the radiant awareness of the image of emptiness compre-hensive of all aspects. Examination consists in the knowledge of the characteris-tics of the images of emptiness having the aspects of phenomena and experienc-ing such characteristics as being simply one’s mind. Analysis is the ascertain-ment or experience of the mind’s nature manifesting as the image of emptinesswhile unmoved by any stain of subject and object, perceiver and perceived. Joyis focused outwardly, a joy likened to an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.Bliss is focused inwardly and derives from the concentration itself manifestingas bliss. As a result of bliss, the body is pervaded by a special bliss of ease.The special sign of the yoga of meditative absorption is then seen: the visionof multicolored images of manifold form, sound, smell, taste, and tactile sensa-tion marked by spheres endowed with five qualities—emitting light, subtle,bright, quivering, and difficult to destroy. Within these spheres, many buddhasmanifest. These are manifestations of the purity of the mind’s nature; havingsuch realization, all karmic appearances also manifest as illusions.The third branch is control of the breath: In the Sanskrit term pr› ̊ay›ma, pr› ̊ameans vital (srog) and refers to winds; ay›ma means to block or exhort (rtsol), inthe sense of causing the winds to enter the central channel. Control of the breath(srog rtsol) is thus performed in order to block the karmic winds from flowinginto the right and left channels and to cause them to enter into the central chan-nel and dissolve into the indestructible seminal essence. To do this, the adeptfirst visualizes the three channels in the body and practices the adamantine reci-tation (rdo rje bzlas pa) of exhaling with the sound of the letter AH, inhaling withthe sound of the letter O±, and concentrating on the letter HU± at the navelduring the pause with the sound of the letter HU±. This is to clear the innerchannels, after which one adopts the soft breathing (’jam rlung) to channel thevital wind into the central channel. Once the wind has entered the channel,through the forceful breathing (rtsub rlung) of the vase breathing (rlung bum pacan), the vital energy is held in it, and the adept experiences the ten signs withinthe body and concentrates on the empty images in the body. Through this yoga,the adept also accomplishes the cause for the immutable bliss (which in thissystem is posited as the great seal of the empty images) and gains control overwinds and seminal essences (in particular, the ability to hold and turn back theseminal essence). The scope of breath control is enhanced by other techniquessuch as that of the inner heat, sexual union with a real consort, and forcefulphysical exercises."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 479Retention (from the Sanskrit dh›ra ̊›), the fourth, has a variety of meaningsbut in this context refers to preventing (holding) the winds from moving. Reten-tion is the yoga using the special vase breathing techniques associated with heart,navel, throat, forehead, and top of the head. The aim of this yoga is to make theseminal essence unmoving and to ignite the inner heat, the seed of the occur-rence of special images of emptiness, which can directly bring about immutablebliss. The nature of retention is a concentration related to the dissolution of thewinds into the seminal essence within the central channel at the place of the fiveor six energy focal points (cakra); in particular, it causes the dissolution of thewinds at the forehead seminal point, where the non-emitted seminal essence isfirmly held. Its signs are the appearance of a black line emitting rays, the blazingof the inner heat, and hearing extremely distinctly the indestructible sound.The fifth, subsequent application (from the Sanskrit anusm ̧ti, where anu meanssubsequent, and sm ̧ti, recollection), is a repeated meditation on the great seal ofthe empty images. The auxiliary aspects of this meditation are related to thechannels, winds, and seminal essences; the empty images of the blazing of theinner heat; the five or six seminal essences at the energy focal points, and themelted bliss related to these; training in melting the bliss, etc. The nature ofrecollection is the contemplation which repeatedly produces the melted blissthrough the equipoise on the empty images of the three existences (among whichthe main is the image of the male and female deity in union) which are appear-ances of the blazing of the inner heat accompanied or not by the practice of theaction or imaginary seals. In this system, it is said, however, that the adept ofless capability is unable to experience fully the four joys of the melted seminalessence without relying on an actual consort. When his capability develops, herelies only on the last two seals, the imaginary and the great, and finally, only onthe great seal. The signs accompanying this phase of the yoga include the mani-festation of one’s body as the empty image of a light mandala; and emanationand withdrawal of pure and impure images of the three worlds. As the result ofsubsequent application, a mandala of light, the effect of one’s channels beingfilled with seminal essence, pervades everywhere, inside and outside; even ifone’s body is not transformed, one’s mind becomes the actual form of the deity;the experience of bliss and emptiness remains constant.The sixth, contemplation (from the Sanskrit sam›dhi), is to remain in a state ofindivisibility of subject and object, free from perceiver and perceived. In thisphase of the yoga, the adept trains exclusively with an imaginary consort, prac-ticing for an extended length of time using the vase breathing for each focalpoint of energy in relation to the descent and ascent of the seminal essence, andremains absorbed in the state of bliss and empty images.The focus of the concentration is the bliss and the empty images meditatedupon to increase the immutable bliss. While doing this, the adept’s body is puri-fied and becomes the dimension of pristine awareness. This concentration isextended from the first moment of immutable bliss up to the completion of 21,600moments, when the body of the adept dematerializes. Its nature is that of aconcentration on the images of pristine awareness through the force of theimmutable bliss. During the actual contemplation, the adept engages in melting"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"480 Buddhist Ethicscontinuously the seminal essence, and externally he or she engages without in-terruption in the elaborate mode of tantric conduct.

For the position of each branch of the sixfold yoga in relation to the fivepaths and twelve stages, see Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, pp. 518-524.166. Here, “meat” refers to the flesh of animals who have died naturally. Thispledge applies only in countries where the eating of meat is taboo. Alcohol isconsumed as a pledge substance while remaining in control (unintoxicated)(Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 255a4-5).167. On the correspondence between the nectars and the dhyani buddhas, theEssence of the Great Seal Tantra states that Ratnasambhava is blood; Amitabha,semen; Amoghasiddhi, human flesh; Akshobhya, urine; Vairochana, excrement(Pundarika’s Stainless Light Commentary, Toh. 1347 vol. Da, f. 230a6-7).168. Dharmasri states that in the definitive sense, to eat the five meats is to bindthe pure essences of the five senses; to drink alcohol is to bind in non-emissionthe descending innate bliss of the melted seminal essence; to eat the five nectarsis to bind the essences of the five elements. By binding these, the subtle andgross particles of the melted seminal essence are purified; by enjoying all kindsof objects, the pure essences of feces, urine, and semen are stabilized at the navelby reversing them upward (Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 255a6-b2).169. Immutable (ak ̋ara, mi ’gyur ba) bliss is bliss characterized by the arrest of theseminal fluid at the tip of the vajra. The mutable (k ̋ara, ’gyur ba) bliss is character-ized by the descent and movement of seminal fluid toward the tip of the vajra.170. Adamantine bodhichitta (rdo rje byang sems). Bodhicitta in the Universal Wayis the resolution (citta, sems) to attain awakening (bodhi, byang chub) for the wel-fare of others. As such, it is the seed of awakening. In tantra, without losing itsoriginal connotation, the term denotes the seminal essence (bindu, thig le) resid-ing at the top of the head, which is the basis for the blissful pristine awareness.As such, it is understood as having two aspects: the relative aspect, which issubstantial and of a white, moon-like seminal essence; and the ultimate aspectof the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness.171. On the control of the winds (byed bcings kyi sbyor ba), Taranatha’s Meaning-ful to Behold explains that byed refers to control over the five winds associatedwith the sense organs; and bcings, to the control of the vital (pr› ̊a, srog) anddownward-clearing winds (thur sel).The control of the winds of the sense organs is effected by assuming the faceof a wrathful deity: narrowing the gaze to a subtle point, rolling inward thetongue, contracting the lips, nose, and ears; contracting the muscles of the fourlimbs, contracting inwardly the toes, tightening the vajra fists, assuming thecross-legged posture, and pushing up one’s shoulders forcefully.The control of the vital and descending winds is effected by different forms ofbreath control (p. 161 lines 1-6).172.

See note 165."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 481173.According to Pema Karpo, who supports his opinion by quoting theKalachakra and other tantras, the root downfall of expressing anger toward one’sspiritual siblings applies to a beginner only in relation to the vajra siblings withwhom he or she has assumed pledges from the same master, mandala, and con-sort. For an experienced meditator, however, this downfall can be incurred evenin relation to common spiritual siblings, i.e., all sentient beings (TV, vol. Ca, f.129a5-6).174. Buddhajnanapada’s enumeration of five kinds of vajra siblings or spiritualcompanions is found in his Presentation of the Stages (Rim pa rnam pa gzhag pa): (1)All those who have entered the Buddhist teachings or the Indestructible Way;(2) all sentient beings (since pristine awareness is present in all of them); (3, 4,and 5) those who have been initiated by the same master, in the same mandala,and with the same consort, distinguished as close, special, and most special sib-lings with respect to the four initiations (TV, vol. Ca, f. 128b 3-5).Lilavajra, in his Shimmering Light on the Pledges, distinguishes four kinds ofsiblings: General (common) siblings are all sentient beings who are none otherthan a manifestation of one’s own intrinsic awareness and thus not to be re-garded as “others,” and who are future buddhas in that they possess the poten-tial to become buddhas. Distant siblings are all followers of the Buddha’s teach-ings. Close siblings are those who have the same view and conduct in that theylead lives of chastity (brahamacarya). Inner (nang ’dres) siblings are those withwhom one shares the same vajra master, initiatory mandala, and consort in theinitiation (TV, vol. Ca, ff. 127b5-128a5).Manjushriyashas distinguishes six kinds: Vajra siblings include all who haveentered the same mandala of Guhyasamaja or another. Close siblings include allwho have entered the Way of Indestructible Reality. Beautiful siblings includeall who have entered the Buddhist teachings. Furthermore, vajra siblings in-clude all sentient beings since all have the nature of Vajrasattva. Special vajrasiblings include all those who have received the vase, secret, pristine-awareness-through-wisdom, and the symbolic fourth initiation from the same master andconsort. Particular siblings include all those who have received one of these ini-tiations together (TV, vol. Ca, f. 128a6-b3).175. Seven kinds of vajra siblings are mentioned in Dharmashri’s Commentaryon the Three Vows: all sentient beings (general siblings); all Buddhists (extendedsiblings); all mantrikas (close siblings); and the four kinds of intimate siblings—all those initiated into the same mandala (siblings of the same “mother”); allthose initiated by the same master (siblings of the same “father”); all those initi-ated into the same mandala and by the same master, either at different times(siblings of the same “parents”, “younger” or “older”) or at the same time (twins);and all those who have received all four initiations together (this last being thedeepest of all connections) (f. 259a1-4) The seven vajra siblings referred to in theKalachakra tantra may possibly correspond to these.176. Pema Karpo explains that these four refer to abandoning love in a lightmanner, in a medium manner, in a heavy manner, and in a very heavy manner.The first means abandoning love for just a second and immediately restoring it, likedrawing a picture with a stick on the surface of water. The second is compared"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"482 Buddhist Ethicsto making a drawing on sand which is then erased by the wind. The third refersto a mind that remains long without love, likened to a crack in the earth whichneeds to be joined by water. The fourth refers to giving up completely one’s lovefor another, likened to a diamond shattered into two which can never be re-united, or a ripened fruit which has fallen to the ground and smashed (TV, vol.Ca, f. 130b3).177. The citation is found in Pundarika’s Great Commentary, vol. Da, f. 154a7.Here, the relative awakening mind refers to the seminal essence the loss of whichprevents the arising of unmoving bliss. The ultimate awakening mind denotesbliss, which relies on the seminal essence, the relative awakening mind (TV, vol.Ca, f. 134a3-5).Bokar Rinpoché explains that an adept who engages in sexual union as ameans to deepen realization does so only when complete mastery over the move-ment of the seminal essence has been achieved so that no emission occurs. Themotivation must be the resolve to attain awakening, uncorrupted with lust.During union, which serves as the basis for the generation of the pristine aware-ness of supreme bliss, yogin and yogini imagine themselves to be in the form ofthe male and female deities in union; the result consists in the realization of theultimate awakening mind.178. Nectar pills (bdud rtsi ril bu): pills containing the five nectars to be used dur-ing tantric rituals, such as for the inner offerings. Other purposes for which theemission of seminal fluid is permitted include to maintain one’s family lineage,and as a means to remove obstacles [to one’s own life] (TV, vol. Ca, f. 134b2).179. Here, Kongtrul is referring to Darika’s Explanation of the Kalachakra Initia-tion (K›lacakratantrar›jasekaprakriy›v ̧tti; rGyud kyi rgyal po dpal dus kyi ’khor lo’idbang gi rab tu byed pa’i ’grel pa) (Toh. 1355), f. 50b5.Darika is numbered among the eighty-four great tantric adepts of ancientIndia. A king of Pataliputra, he became a disciple of Luipa, who sold him to aprostitute in order to shatter his concept of caste. While serving the prostitute,Darika secretly practiced the instructions of his master and became an accom-plished yogin. For details of his life, see Keith Dowman’s Masters of Mahamudra(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985).180. Attainment (siddhi, dngos grub), particularly supernatural attainment, is di-vided into two kinds: supreme attainment (mchog gi dngos grub), often equiva-lent to full spiritual accomplishment; and common attainments (thun mong gidngos grub). The common attainments are generally enumerated as eight: thepower of the magic sword of invincibility, the eye elixir that enables one to seeother realms, swift walking, invisibility, the elixir of youth, walking in sky, shap-ing pills of the five meats and five nectars, and moving underground. See IOKvol. III, Book X, chapter II.181. The vase initiation authorizes the practitioner to engage in tantra’s phaseof creation in which the five aggregates are imaginatively associated with therespective buddhas; the elements, with the consorts of the buddhas; and thesense fields, with the bodhisattvas.

She who bestows the bliss (bde ba sbyin pa mo), the third of these three typesof seals: the action seal who gives a moving bliss (k ̋ara, ’gyur ba); the imaginaryseal who gives the vibrating (spanda, g.yo ba) bliss; and the great seal who givesthe immutable bliss, i.e., the great seal that is the supreme emptiness comprehen-sive of all aspects (rnam kun mchog ldan gyi stong pa nyid). See Naropa’s Commen-tary on the Summary of the Kalacakra Initiation, ff. 273b3-274a1 and IK, pp. 313-315.184. “Etc.” refers to refusing to enter into union with a qualified consort at thetimes this is required (TV, vol. Ca, f. 151b2). Dharmashri states that a yogin’spledges include to keep ritual objects such as vajra, bell, ritual dress, and orna-ments; to enjoy foods and drinks such as the inner and outer five meats andnectars; and to dance, chant songs, and enter into union with a qualified consort(Commentary on the Three Vows, f. 263a3-6).185. Kongtrul explains that an actual ritual feast (ga ̊acakra, tshogs kyi ’khor lo, lit.“wheel of the group”) comprises a gathering of yogins and yoginis equal innumber to the male and female figures found in the mandala of the tantric deityof which these yogins and yoginis are adepts.The ritual feast is performed on different occasions, such as the fourteenth,the eighth, and the tenth of the waxing moon, dates on which offerings acquirea special magnitude. Yogins and yoginis gather at night in a suitable isolatedplace, such as where sky-farers gather, the outskirts of a town, a temple, a cem-etery, an empty cave, at the foot of a tree, or at the edge of a forest. Depending onits type and purpose, the ritual feast may last a night, a month, or three yearsand three fortnights. The purpose may be to offer to worldly and transworldlysky-farers, to perform an initiation rite, or to allow a friendly gathering of tantricpractitioners. In terms of its effect on the personal practice of the yogin or yogini,the ritual feast is a way to enhance realization.Once the place has being chosen (some tantras specify that the hidden ritualfeast house be of three stories, below the ground, or one half above, etc.), themandala is drawn, and the yogins and yoginis take their places on seats of corpses,tiger skins, or other, surrounding the central figure, the yogin or yogini leader ofthe feast. The offerings, of the five nectars and the five meats, alcohol, etc., areconsecrated according to the appropriate ritual and then enjoyed by the congre-gation as an “inner fire offering” to the deities of the body mandala of eachparticipant. The yogins and yoginis enjoy food and drinks imagining them topervade all their psychophysical constituents and thereby generating pleasure.During union while in the state of meditative absorption, the yogin and yoginiexperience the four joys while holding the seminal essence, and remain absorbedin the state of coemergent bliss and emptiness. Arising from the absorption, theysee all appearances as illusions, and whatever appears manifests as the form ofthe deity.

As stated in the tantras, every woman possesses the nature of wisdom andis the embodiment of all adamantine sky-farers ( ̃›kinıs). Nature of wisdom re-fers to the knowledge of reality. A woman is said to possess wisdom-nature be-cause she is the basis that points to such knowledge or the basis upon whichsuch knowledge can be realized, as the active consort in the third initiation. Forthese reasons, she should not be disrespected but always revered, as stated bythe master Kanha:Upon seeing any womanCircumambulate her counterclockwise three times,Bowing your headSupplicate her thrice:“O mother, I am your son!Thus, from now until awakening,Nurture me with the milkOf the factors leading to awakeningThat springs from your breast” (TV, vol.

Personal instructions (slob bshad): instructions related to the [two or three]higher initiations, which empower the disciple to cultivate the phase of comple-tion of the Highest Yoga Tantra. Collective explanations (tshogs bshad): instruc-tions related to the vase initiation, which authorizes one to cultivate the phase ofcreation of the Highest Yoga Tantra.On this subject, Kongtrul states that among the six parameters and four stylesfor expounding the tantras, the following may be taught to an assembly ofdisciples: the literal meaning or standard terminology (sgra ji bzhin pa); non-interpretable meaning (dgongs pa can min pa); provisional meaning (drang don);explanation of the words (yi ge’i don); and general explanation (spyi’i don). Thefollowing are taught only to jewel-like disciples: non-literal meaning or coinedterminology (sgra ji bzhin min pa); teachings on the phase of completion thatrepresent the definitive meaning (nges don); interpretable teachings (dgongs bshad);the hidden meaning (sbas don); and ultimate meaning (mthar thug pa’i don). Pub-lic explanations are therefore restricted to those concerning the phase of creationand related topics, excluding [practices involving] passion which are to be keptsecret. Personal instructions are those concerning the phase of completion (IOK,vol. II, pp. 722-723).

The Guyhasamaja Tantra speaks of five types of disciples: the blue-lotus-like person (ut pa la lta bu’i gang zag), the white-lotus-like person (pad dkar lta bu’igang zag), the lotus-like person (pad ma lta bu’i gang zag), the sandalwood-likeperson (can da na lta bu’i gang zag), and the jewel-like person (rin po che lta bu’igang zag).The blue-lotus-like person, although capable of apprehending the meaningsand words of what is taught, immediately forgets them. Such a disciple is like ablue lotus, fragrant while growing in the water, but losing its fragrance and with-ering as soon as it is plucked.The white-lotus-like person, although learned and capable of understandingcorrectly the meaning of what is taught through intelligent reflection, is like aseed in a vase filled with cotton which cannot sprout. Like a white lotus whosefragrance remains in its bud and does not diffuse, such a one is unable to trans-mit knowledge to others.The lotus-like person has compassion and discriminative awareness, and af-ter learning the teachings, is capable of opening another’s mind. However, sincea thorough experience has not been gained, these qualities do not last. He or sheis like a lotus which has a good fragrance but the drop of dew at the center of itsbud cannot be held and vanishes as soon as the sun rises.The sandalwood-like type of disciple has little knowledge but claims to knoweverything.

Taranatha (1575-1634), whose real name was Kunga Nyingpo (Kun dga’snying po), composed numerous works on tantra and history. Being a directdisciple of Indian mahasiddhas, he became a vital link in the transmission ofvarious meditation instructions and practices. A scholar of exceptional brilliance,possessed of analytical and critical talents, and an outstanding meditation mas-ter, Taranatha was, however, the object of criticism by his contemporaries, whoapparently could not tolerate his unorthodox view on extrinsic emptiness. Hisbeneficial influence on the development of Tibetan Buddhism is widely recog-nized and felt even now. He is often referred to as the Lord of Jonang to indicatehis affiliation with the Jonang school.200.

Following these two, the DergéTengyur contains two short works comprised of few lines each (lTung ba bco lngapa [Toh. 2480] and Yan lag gi nyes pa bdun pa [Toh. 2481]), the authors of which arenot specified, which present respectively the fifteen infractions related to charis-matic activity and the seven branch infractions. It could be that Kongtrul con-siders their author to be Shura or Ashvaghosha. (Tibetan historians considerAshvaghosha and Shura to be the same person; modern historians believe themto be two different persons.)The twenty-eight infractions are also discussed in Manjusriyashas’s ERD.204. To be irreverent toward one’s meditational deity and to make discrimina-tions between one deity and another, without realizing the sameness of all dei-ties, in that all the transcendent ones have gathered into the deities’ forms andembody their blessing. This is not an infraction when switching to another deityis done to obey the wish of one’s master, to acquire special means of practice, orto perform different kinds of activities in particular situations. It is also not aninfraction if one understands the sameness of all deities (ERD, f. 221a1-2).205. This does not constitute an infraction if one does not perform these prac-tices due to being engaged in works for one’s master or when sick (ERD, f. 221a5).206. This does not constitute an infraction when done to uplift someone spiritu-ally; when in the presence of one’s master [or vajra siblings, etc.]; if one’s lifewould be at risk; or if one has to do so as a form of punishment (ERD, f. 221a6).207. To transgress the directives of the teachings out of attachment to worldlythings. This does not qualify as an infraction when done as a means to upliftsomebody or for the sake of experiencing great bliss (ERD, f. 221b6).208. The correct time would be when one has reached the spiritual level neces-sary for that activity. Activities are distinguished as those performed by a begin-ner, by one who has attained a slight degree of stability, by one who has attainedstability, and by one who has attained greater stability (ERD, f. 222a1).209. If one’s relationship to the master dissolves, no attainments will result fromone’s spiritual efforts. There is no infraction if he or she is not an authentic tantricmaster. A false master is one who has no knowledge of mantric principles, isignorant of the Universal Way’s teachings, lacks compassion, has no faith in orenthusiasm for the teachings, is always engrossed in unwholesome behavior,and despises the tantric treatises (ERD, f. 227a7-b2).210. Desire here stands for the entire range of one’s emotions (ERD, f. 227b4-5).211. The Three Jewels include the master and special companions such as vajrasiblings (ERD, f. 227b6).212.

To transfer consciousness to higher states when the time of death has come,but not before the signs indicating death are manifest (TV, vol. Ca, f. 160a2-3).On this point, Manjushriyashas says: The transference of consciousness asthe yogin (or yogini) dies pertains to the perfection of wisdom. At the time ofdeath, the yogin, viewing all things as an illusion in the mode of the two truths(conventional and ultimate), remains free from attachment and anger, and clearlyimagines the mandala of the deity. As the stages of death occur, the yogin ab-sorbs the mandala into intrinsic pristine awareness in the following way. Thethree worlds are imagined to dissolve into light, which is viewed as the mandala.This then dissolves into the seed syllable in the midst of wisdom and means,and that syllable then dissolves at the heart region along with the light (ERD, f.228a7-b1).214.

The three realities (ngo bo nyid gsum): the aspect or “side” of appearance (snangphyogs) of the deity; the aspect or “side” of emptiness (stong phyogs); and the unionof appearance and emptiness (zung ’jug gi ngo bo nyid). Not one of the three reali-ties is a manifestation of unawareness; each is free of mental projections. Thus, thethree are of identical natures and are differentiated only categorically. They areposited as a yogin’s non-conceptual experience of contemplation. (The Slob bshadTradition of the Sa skya Lam ’bras [gSung ngag lam ’bras slob bshad chen mo], [25 vols.Dehra Dun: Sakya College, 1983] vol. Ma (XVI), ff. 88b3-90a1).Regarding the three realities, H. H. Sakya Trizin explains that in the context ofthe pledges of the four initiations, equipoise (mnyam gzhag) refers to the mun-dane path linked to the phase of creation when there is no actual pristine aware-ness; and post-equipoise conduct (rjes spyod), to the transmundane path or re-sult of equipoise. The side of appearance refers to the deity appearing by itself,without any effort or conceptual process whatsoever; the side of emptiness re-fers to the subsiding of the deity in favor of emptiness; and union refers to theindivisibility of appearance and emptiness in the rainbow-like or illusory bodyof the deity.219. This refers to the fourteen root tantric downfalls and the eight secondaryones mentioned above.220. Control of breath and channels (rtsa rlung) refers to the retention of the breath(srog rtsol) or vajra recitation (rdo rje’i bzlas pa), the three branches of exhalation"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 489(gtong ba’i yan lag gsum), the two branches of inhalation (dgang ba’i yan lag gnyis),and dwelling of the breath inside (gnas pa).

H.Sakya Trizin).225. The three waves (rba rlabs gsum). Here, “vajra” means adorned by non-conceptual bliss; “waves” refers to dualistic conceptions (gnyis ’dzin gyi rtog pa).Waves are of the nature of the ocean and are absorbed back into it; likewise,dualistic conceptions are not beyond the nature of emptiness and bliss and areabsorbed into it. They number three as they relate to body, speech, and mind.The practice related to the three waves is intended to subdue dualistic con-ceptions: with respect to the body, one practices the vase-breath retention(kumbhaka), with respect to the speech, one controls the winds in gentle and force-ful techniques; and with respect to the mind, one engages in the wave of con-templation relying on an actual or imaginary consort. (The Slob bshad Tradition ofthe Sa skya Lam ’bras, vol. Ma, ff. 88b3-90b1).226. Emotional impediments and impediments to knowledge.227.Padmini usually denotes the best of the five types of consorts whose namesderive from the Kamashastra literature, namely, m ̧gı (ri dwags can), hastinı (glangpo can), Ÿaºkhinı (dung can) and citri ̊ı (sna tshogs can).

Naropa defines the different seals: The action seal (karmamudr›, las rgya) isa real woman, with breasts and hair; she is the cause for the bliss related to thedesire realm (’dod spyod las rgya). She is an “action” seal as she performs suchactions as kissing, embracing, making contact with the secret parts, etc. She is“seal” as she bestows bliss, in this case a mutable (k ̋ara, ’gyur ba) bliss.The pristine awareness (jñ›namudr›, ye shes kyi phyag rgya) or imaginary sealis constructed by one’s mind, and consists of various deities, such as Vishvamata.She is the cause for the bliss related to the form realm, which is an unsteady(spanda, g.yo ba) bliss.The great seal (mah›mudr›, phyag rgya chen po) is the pristine awareness of animmutable (ak ̋ara, mi ’gyur ba) and supreme bliss.(Commentary on the Summary of the Kalachakra Initiation, ff. 273b3-274a1).

According to Pema Karpo, to cultivate the pledge in this context refers toenhancing or preserving the four aspects of bodhichitta (seminal essence) whichhave the nature of the sixteen joys (f. 176b1). See note 243.232. The Hevajra Tantra speaks of four types of consorts: the consort of the vajrafamily of Akshobhya is a washer woman (gyung mo); that of the lotus family ofAmitabha, a dancer (gar ma); that of the action family of Amoghasiddhi, a dyer(tshos mkhan ma); that of the transcendent family of Vairochana, a brahmin girl(bram ze mo); and that of the jewel family of Ratnasambhava, an outcaste girl(gdol pa ma) (Kongtrul’s Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, f. 78a7-b4). A yogin must rely on a consort who belongs to his own family. For example, ifhe is of the lotus family, he should rely on a consort of the lotus family. Complex-ion is a factor clearly indicating the family a consort belongs to. The color of theVairochana family is white; therefore, a consort of that family would be a qualifiedbrahmin girl or another of white complexion. When a consort of his own family isnot found, he may resort to one of another family. A non-human consort, such asa deva or celestial musician (gandharva), is also suitable (ff. 93b2-94a3).233. See following note.234. Naropa explains that the end of the full moon (nya’i mthar) refers to the innatebliss which is correlated to the sixteenth of the month. The waning (dark) phase ofthe moon (nag po’i phyogs) refers to the joy or bliss which has gone beyond theinnate one (the sixteenth), i.e., waning due to the outpouring of seminal fluid."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 491To explain, through the heat or fire of attachment aroused by the imaginaryor real presence of a consort, a yogi awakens the seminal essence which rests atthe crown of the head. The seminal essence then descends as far as the tip of theorgan, where instead of outflowing, it is held and reversed upward to the crownof the head. The descent of the seminal essence is characterized by four stages ofincreasingly higher delight: initial delight (pratham›nanda), supreme delight(param›nanda), special delight (viram›nanda), and innate delight (sahaj›nanda).These occur as the seminal essence reaches the four focal points of energy: throat,heart, navel, and secret parts. At the throat, seminal essence is associated withpristine awareness; at the heart, with the mind; at the navel, with the speech; atthe secret region, with the body. These are often spoken of as the four seminalessences (bindu). Each of the stages of delight has four degrees called delight ofbody (k›y›nanda), of speech (v›g›nanda), of mind (citt›nanda), and pristine aware-ness (jñ›nanda).When the seminal essence is lost and the experience of the four delights whichare pervaded by passion (r›ga) come to an end, there is a period of satisfactionor disgust (vir›ga). This period has four moments characterized by the abovefour delights but in the reverse order. First is the multiform delight, followed bythe supreme delight, then initial delight, and finally a moment of total lack ofpassion called absence of moon (na ̋ ̨acandra).Such process is paralleled to the waxing and waning phases of the moon, themoon internally being the seminal essence in its fifteen clear and the fifteen darkmoments. The seminal essence at the focal point of energy at the crown of thehead is the new moon which aroused by passion grows through fifteen mo-ments (kal›) to reach its fullness, the full moon, just before emission. The six-teenth day or moment concluding the clear fifteen moments is the innate blissand that concluding the dark fifteen moments is the absence of moon or darkmoon. The task of the yogin in this process is to prevent the outflow of the semi-nal essence: once it has reached the tip of the organ to reverse its course upwardin order to attain immutable bliss (Iniziazione K›lacakra, pp. 68-80; 305-308).235.

Ca, f. 168a2-6).243. Pema Karpo explains the hidden meanings of each of these four: to takelife, tell lies, steal, and have intercourse with the spouse of another. To take lifemeans to stop the vital energy within one’s body, i.e., to dissolve one’s body andall phenomena into the state of clear light. To block the body’s vital energy isalso explained as to block (stabilize) the seminal essence at the crown of one’shead. Moreover, it means to block the flow of the five major winds, the ten sub-sidiary [winds], and the 21,000 [daily breaths], called “vital [energy]” (pr› ̊a,srog) within the right (rasan›) and left (lalan›) channels.With respect to the causal aspect of the practice, to block the vital winds meansto exhaust the flow of winds in the central channel as a result of which seminalessence rises to the crown of the head. Also, the Hevajra Tantra says:By blocking the bodyThe vital wind is blocked.Firmly blocking the vital windControls bodhichitta.By blocking bodhichittaTransmigration is blocked.When transmigration is blocked, in that instantAll yogins become buddhas themselves.The Guhyasamaja Tantra states:Vitality indicates the great wind that always moves.To block or bind that is to take life.It does not mean to kill someone.To take the life of the vital energy also means to rest in the equipoise in whichthere is no artificiality as to unfabricated reality. When through such an inde-structible practice one attains contemplation in the state of emptiness by under-standing the nature of all phenomena included in the aggregates, elements, sensefields and so on, the artificiality with regard to them is destroyed. Also, the Com-mentary on the Essence states:Vital energy is mindAnd mind is wind and semen."},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 493To tell lies refers to the indestructible sound or inexpressible word that im-parts in the different languages of sentient beings simultaneously the teachingthat all inner and outer phenomena, beings and their environment, are not per-manent, not made by a creator, but are arising interdependently, like magicalillusions.To steal comprises four pledges. The first is the pledge of the vajra body whichrefers to the seminal essence that has the nature of the Buddha’s body and pro-duces the waking state. Melted by the passion of the wisdom woman, the semi-nal essence is preserved in lotus (at the secret place). That essence has four as-pects: the joy of body, the joy of speech, the joy of mind, and the joy of pristineawareness. To maintain that essence, one consumes the great flesh, where fleshrepresents the aggregate of mental formations and to consume means to clear itof impediments.The pledge of the vajra speech refers to the seminal essence that has the na-ture of the Buddha’s speech and produces the dream state. Melted by the pas-sion of the wisdom woman (consort), it is preserved in the lotus of the navel.That also has four aspects, the supreme joy of body, the supreme joy of speech,the supreme joy of mind, and the supreme joy of pristine awareness. Enlight-ened body, speech, and mind, and pristine awareness are one in the form of theseminal essence at the navel and thus should be protected. That protection oc-curs with the “unchanging vajra speech,” i.e., the bliss of the non-emitted es-sence of bodhichitta, which is called great since it does not change for an instant.To maintain that essence of vajra speech, one consumes feces and urine, whichmeans to free the aggregate of consciousness from impediments.The pledge of vajra mind refers to the seminal essence that has the nature ofthe Buddha’s mind and produces deep sleep. Melted by the passion of the wis-dom woman (consort), it is preserved in the lotus of the heart. That essence hasfour aspects: the special joy of body, special joy of speech, special joy of mind,and special joy of pristine awareness. To maintain that essence, one consumesblood and semen, which means to free respectively the aggregate of feeling andthat of perception from impediments. In relation to this pledge, it is also statedthat with stable conduct, the yogin should always rely on an action seal (con-sort) without emission of seminal fluid: this means to be endowed with the pledgeof the vajra mind.The pledge of vajra pristine awareness refers to the seminal essence that has thenature of the Buddha’s pristine awareness and produces the fourth pivotal state.Melted by the passion of the wisdom woman (consort), it is preserved in the lotusof the throat. It has four aspects: the innate joy of body, the innate joy of speech,the innate joy of mind, and the innate joy of pristine awareness. It is to be main-tained by consuming form and other sense objects, the six sense consciousnesses,etc. These are the pledges pertaining to stealing; the pristine awareness of greatbliss or the Buddha’s pristine awareness is understood by one’s own intrinsicawareness and is not dependent on others. In this sense, it is “stolen.”To have intercourse with the woman of another is to be interpreted in relationto the state of union. “Another” stands for Vajrasattva or for “best.” The Vajrasattvaor best woman is the blessed transcendent wisdom mother, the consort (mother)"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"494 Buddhist Ethicsof all buddhas. That mother, possessing observable attributes, is called wisdomwoman, and being supremely endowed with aspects is called emptiness or thegreat seal. Having intercourse with the woman of another refers to the blissfulunion with such a “mother” without losing the seminal essence (TV, vol. Ca, f.169a6 onward).244. In this class of pledges, Pema Karpo also includes the nine pledges con-cerning conduct taught in the Abhidhana Tantra or Unsurpassable ChakrasamvaraTantra (f. 183b5) (see above section on “Conduct,” page 246), and the six modesof conduct for practitioners who dwell in a constant state of contemplation (f.184b5), taught in the Indestructible Tent Tantra (page 273).245.Indestructible Tent Tantra, f. 64b6. Kongtrul explains that the pristine aware-ness of experiential warmth (drod kyi ye shes) is that of a yogin (or yogini) on thetantric path of preparation of the Highest Tantra. Such a yogin has experiencedthe phase of completion and thus continually engages in the metaphorical pris-tine awareness. He has acquired proficiency in the states of bliss, clarity, andnon-conceptuality, as indicated by the signs of warmth. The pristine awarenessat this stage is known as experiential warmth because it serves as a direct causethat leads to the path of seeing. The signs indicating warmth are lesser, mid-dling, and great. The lesser signs are that a yogin is no longer subject to fear,madness, sorrow, pain, or frustration, and cannot be injured; and the middling,that he is not affected by strong desire, hatred, ignorance, or other emotions thatarise through the force of major circumstances. The great signs include clairvoy-ance and other miraculous powers. These signs concord with the stages ofwarmth, peak, and acceptance explained in the Way of the Perfections. Once theyogin has experienced these signs, if he enhances his realization through thecomplex, non-elaborated, and simple tantric practices, he will swiftly reach thepath of seeing (Commentary on [Rangjung Dorjé’s] Profound Reality Rumtek, Sikkim:Dharma Charkra Centre, 1981, ff. 155a3-b3).The signs that indicate experiential warmth (drod rtags) are usually under-stood as those that indicate the yogin’s maturity for special tantric practices thataccelerate spiritual accomplishment. As taught in the second book of the HevajraTantra,Fear, madness, and likewise sorrow and pain,Frustration and injury,Great desire, hatred, and ignoranceDo not obscure the adept.In addition, Tibetan masters speak of three degrees of warmth, the best beingthe understanding of reality; the middling, the leveling of the eight worldly con-cerns; and the least, the ability to demonstrate magical feats (Kongtrul’s Com-mentary on the Hevajra Tantra, f. 93a1-5).246.

The yoga of the seminal essence (binduyoga, thig le’i rnal ’byor) here refers tothe meditation in which one first transforms oneself into the deity while clearlyvisualizing the vital points of energy. Then, holding the energies at the navel,one causes the seminal essence or glorious essence (dpyid thig) to melt and de-scend.

Self-blessing or self-consecration (sv›di ̋ ̨h›na, rang byin rlabs): meditationalpractices belonging to the causal phase of completion (rgyu’i rdzogs rim) wherethe adept focuses on the mystic heat (me), seminal essence points (thig le), orletters (yi ge) within the central channel. Kongtrul explains: It is natural thatwherever the mind is directed, right there the winds gather. Thus, through medi-tation focusing on those [above mentioned] objects, the winds first gather, thenremain, and finally dissolve into the middle of the focal point of energy (’khor lo)upon which one’s meditation is directed. When the winds dissolve, many spe-cial modes of dissolution of the levels of subtle and gross seminal essences andbliss [resulting from] the melting [of seminal essence] are produced (IOK, vol. II,Book VI, chapter IV, pp. 685-686).The stages of self-consecration generally refer to the relative aspect of thecompletion phase of the Highest Yoga Tantra that has two aspects, themeditational practices related to the ca ̊ ̃›lı or mystic heat and those intendedfor the attainment of the illusory body (sgyu lus).

The Ancient Translation School enumerates nine ways of spiritual devel-opment (theg pa’i rim pa dgu): those of the proclaimers (Ÿr›vaka, nyan thos), thesolitary sages (pratyekabuddha, rang rgyal ba), and the bodhisattvas (bodhisattva,byang chub sems dpa’) (which belong to the indicative [mtshan nyid] or causal [rgyu]way); Kriyatantra (bya ba’i rgyud), Upayatantra or Charyatantra (upa’i rgyud, spyodpa’i rgyud), and Yogatantra (rnal ’byor gyi rgyud) (the three outer tantras);Mahayoga (rnal ’byor chen po), Anuyoga (rjes su rnal ’byor) Atiyoga (shin tu rnal’byor) or Great Perfection (the three inner tantras).Kriyatantra, Upayatantra, and Yogatantra are known as outer tantras, as theirfocuses of practice and abandonments, antidotes, and so forth resemble those ofthe outer Indicative Way. Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga are known as innersince through these ways the very nature of mind spontaneously manifests asthe mandala of pristine awareness and its dimensions; thus, perfection is notsought somewhere else but is seen as one’s own natural pristine awareness.According to the great perfection system, all paths to freedom fall into thesenine ways, and all these nine are encompassed by the Way of Great Perfection.Because of the swiftness and depth of the techniques of the various systemsof tantra, in particular mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga, they are known collec-tively as the Way of Skillful Means (thabs kyi theg pa).For a detailed discussion of these nine spiritual ways, see Dudjom Rinpoche’sThe Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History (Boston:Wisdom Publications, 1991) (henceforth cited as NSH).258.Concise Heruka Tantra, in NG, vol.

Lilavajra (sGeg pa’irdo rje) was a disciple of the great master Lalitavajra (Rol pa’i rdo rje) fromOddiyana. He committed to writing the many instructions that his master hadbrought from that land. Lilavajra was in turn the master of Manjushrishrijnana.261. On the six masters, or the six roles of a master in the case of a master whoperforms all roles, Longchenpa explains these five: the master who leads (’drenpa’i bla ma) is the preceptor who confers the novice ordination (more generally,the first teacher to encourage and introduce one to the teachings, explain thebenefits, give the vows of refuge, etc.).The master who opens one’s mind (shes rgyud ’grol ba’i bla ma) is the one whoexplains the teachings and by doing so breaks the “shell” constraining one’sintelligence.The master who imparts the secret instructions (man ngag ston cing lung ’pogpa’i bla ma) is the spiritual friend in the presence of whom one takes the commit-ments of awakening mind. More generally, it is one who teaches the essence ofview, meditation, and action; here, transmission (lung) of secret instructions re-fers to the empowered words spoken by a master of the three lineages (the in-tentional lineage of the buddhas, the symbolic lineage of the awareness-holders,and the aural lineage of ordinary individuals).The master who restores infractions (nyams chags skong ba’i slob dpon) is theone to whom confession is made.The master who confers initiation and pledges is the one who initiates one.See Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions (Phyogs bcu’i mun sel) (Published byDilgo Kyentsé based on Adzon Drukpa [a ’dzom ’brug pa] redaction), a com-mentary on the Guhyagarbha Tantra, f. 278a1-b1.On the master who is a leader of all (spyi’i bla ma), Dodrup Chen III JikméTenpai Nyima’s General Meaning of the Guhyagarbha Tantra (gSang ba snying pospyi don) (NKG, vol. 35/ci) explains that he is a master revered by all as a holyperson, from whom one has received a measure of his kindness. This is a masterwho is not directly spoken of in the tantras (f. 82b1).Similarly, Khetsun Sangpo Rinpoché comments: A “leader of all” is a masterupon whom all followers of a particular system must rely. The teacher may beremote or close. Buddha Shakyamuni is the “remote master” to be relied uponby all Buddhists, while Garab Dorjé is an example of a remote master to be re-lied upon by all practitioners of great perfection. An example of the “close teacherof all” would be a universally respected master, such as the present Dalai Lama.262. Lilavajra’s Shimmering Light, f. 36b2.263. Ibid., f. 36b2-4.264. Ibid., f. 36b7.265. Jadral Rinpoché explains mantra in this context in the following way: rtsameans root mantra; skyed means generation mantra; and las sngags, action man-tra. Root mantra refers to one of the root mantras of the five Dhyani Buddhas,O± HÚ± TRAM H¿Ê AØ, for example.

Lilavajra’s Shimmering Light on the Tantras, f. 37a2-3.267. Lilavajra includes among the pledge substances the special offerings to theThree Jewels, food offerings (torma) and collective offerings, the skull-cup (thewrathful container), the ritual dagger, the lotus (the peaceful container made ofprecious substances), secret substances, tantric instruments, and the mandala.Moreover, the sound of the yogin’s bell and small drum should not be heard byothers (Shimmering Light, f. 37a3-4).268. The indivisibility of the two superior truths (lhag pa’i bden pa gnyis dbyermed) refers to the indivisibility of the superior ultimate and superior relativetruths as explained in particular in the Mahayoga. To realize such indivisibilitymeans to realize that all appearances are but the very nature of one’s mind, i.e.,the indivisibility of emptiness and appearances. Here, the two truths are calledsuperior (lhag pa) because the way to realize the two truths in Mahayoga is supe-rior to the way taught in the sutras (IOK, vol. II, Book VI, chapter IV).269. This point is elucidated in Kongtrul’s Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra:The ultimate queen (btsun mo) is supreme transcendent wisdom. Her seminalessence or fluid (Ÿukra, khu ba) is non-dual pristine awareness. This pristine aware-ness is not given but “stolen” by the cultivation of the exalted path as the skillfulmeans. The relative queen is the yogin’s consort. Her seminal fluid is not given,but is drawn up and “stolen” by the strength of breath control (f. 219a4-5). Ofthe two types of queens, the ultimate one is emptiness; her “seminal fluid” is thecorrect realization of the meaning of emptiness (f. 299b5-6). The relative queen isof two types: the consort’s body and one’s own body. The first refers to the man-tra-born and the other kinds of consorts. Her seminal essence or fluid is thewhite and red seminal essences (bindu, thig le) drawn up and stolen by the powerof wind control. One’s own body, which embodies skillful means, consists in thethirty-two channels of the four focal points of energy (cakra, ’khor lo) in the cen-tral channel (avadhÒtı, rtsa dbu ma). The seminal fluid is the bliss experienced asthe seminal essence descends through the focal points of energy or the centralchannel (f. 300a1-3).270. Five poisons (emotions) (pañcavi ̋a, dug lnga): desire (r›ga, ’dod chags), ha-tred (dve ̋a, zhe sdang), ignorance (moha, gti mug), pride (m›na, nga rgyal), andjealousy (ı ̧sy›, phrag dog). The Shimmering Light on the Pledges distinguishes be-tween the five ordinary and five perfect poisons. The five ordinary poisons arethe five negative emotions, just as they are. In this system, these are not to beviewed as enemies, as proclaimers view them. Why is this so? Being empty ofany nature, phenomena do not truly exist as objects to be forsaken. Thus, it ispointless to forsake the emotions in the same way that it is pointless to block thewater in a mirage."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 499Further, since the five emotions are primordially the nature of the five pris-tine awarenesses, they should not to be forsaken [but used skillfully], just as onemust first get the seeds if one wishes to produce sesame oil. Each emotion is thepledge of a buddha. For instance, ignorance is the pledge of Vairochana. Why apledge? Because ignorance is not something to be abandoned. Similarly, intrin-sic awareness is not something to be attained. In the sphere of reality these twoare of one flavor. (Dharmashri’s Commentary on the Three Vows, ff. 274b4-275a6).The five perfect poisons are explained in the course of the text itself.271. The aggregates and the five male transcendent ones are associated in thefollowing way: the aggregate of form (rÒpaskandha, gzugs kyi phung po) isVairochana; the aggregate of consciousness (vijñ›naskandha, rnam shes kyi phungpo), Akshobhya; the aggregate of feelings (vedan›skandha, tshor ba’i phung po),Ratnasambhava; the aggregate of perceptions (sa ̇jñ›skandha, ’du shes kyi phungpo), Amitabha; and the aggregate of volitions (sa ̇sk›raskandha, ’du byed kyiphung po), Amoghasiddhi.

The three contemplations (ting nge ’dzin gsum)—initial application, trium-phant mandala, and triumphant action—are common to both Yoga and HighestYoga Tantra. In the Highest Yoga Tantra terminology, these three describe thedegrees of accomplishment in the phase of creation. In the contemplation calledinitial union (prathamaprayoga, dang po’i sbyor ba) of the deity yoga, the yogin (oryogini) works to create a general appearance of the deities and the mandala; inthe second, called the triumphant mandala (vijayama ̊ ̃ala, dkyil ’khor rgyal mchog),the yogin works at making such appearance detailed and vivid; and in the third,called the triumphant act (karmavijaya, las kyi rgyal mchog), the yogin in the roleof the deity enacts enlightened activity, such as purifying sentient beings.316.Kongtrul presents the four branches of familiarization and attainment(caturaºgasev›s›dhana, bsnyen sgrub yan lag bzhi) according to Nagarjuna and thesystem of the Guhyasamaja tantra. Familiarization (sev›, bsnyen pa) consists infamiliarizing pristine awareness with its object, emptiness; close familiarization(upasev›, nye bar bsnyen pa) comprises the phases of creation of the deity up tothe completion of the mandala of the body; attainment (s›dhana, sgrub pa) con-sists in realizing one’s body, speech, and mind as the body, speech, and mind ofthe buddhas; great attainment (mah›s›dhana, sgrub chen) is the state of havingbecome the deity, adorned at the crown of the head with the lord of the family,and performing the activities of a buddha of liberating others, etc. (IOK, vol. III,pp. 176-177).317.

III, pp. 181-182.318. Kongtrul explains that the phase of completion on the side of appearance(snang phyogs kyi rdzogs rim) refers to the form of oneself as the deity and therelated signs during the phase of completion. It is subdivided into three: (1) thecomplete yoga, which is the form of oneself as the deity that vividly appears,with no mental projection (rnam rtog), by the force of the meditation on the deityand through the secondary condition of the mind being blessed by the ordinarybliss resulting from the melting of the seminal essence; (2) the self-consecrationof the illusory body, the form of oneself as the deity which actually manifestsfrom just energy and mind; and (3) the yoga of signs, the manifestation of signssuch as smoke and so forth (IOK, vol. II, pp. 704-705).319. The phase of completion on the side of emptiness (stong phyogs kyi rdzogsrim): the direct realization of the mind’s natural unpolluted state, i.e., pristineawareness coemergent with the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness [resultingfrom] the gradual dissolution of the eighty natural conceptions and the threeappearances (IOK, vol. II, pp. 689-707).320. The phase of completion with respect to the state of union (zung ’jug gi rdzogsrim) refers to the blending of the two sides: the side of emptiness (the pristineawareness of bliss and emptiness [resulting from] the dissolution of winds andmind in the central channel) and the side of appearance (the appearance of theform of the deity and the blessing of that pristine awareness) (IOK, vol. II, p. 707).321. See note 256.322. The mandala circle (dkyil ’khor ’khor lo): meditational practices belonging tothe causal phase of completion involving union with a real consort (karmamudr›,las rgya) during which the adept causes the winds to simultaneously enter, abide,and dissolve [within the central channel]. This quickly brings about a great blissfrom the melting [of the seminal essence] descending within the central chan-nel. As a subsidiary method for stabilizing the blissful pristine awareness, theadept practices with an imaginary consort (jñ›namudr›, ye shes kyi phyag rgya),also known as the great consort attended by an aspect (rnam bcas phyag rgya chenmo) (IOK, vol. II, pp. 686-687).323. Indestructible yoga (rdo rje’i rnal ’byor): the meditational practice of the greatseal (phyag rgya chen mo), the twofold meditation that brings about bliss and themeditation that “channels” seminal essence and conceptual mind. The two stagesof meditation are as follows: (1) After having acquired familiarity with the pris-tine awareness coemergent with the bliss of the melted [seminal essence], theadept remains absorbed in the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness; suchabsorption again causes the winds and mind to gather, and the adept therebyexperiences repeatedly a special melted bliss. (2) The adept channels the semi-nal essence into the central channel, and conceptions into clear-light awareness;"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 505doing this, he or she meditates exclusively on emptiness. As a result, the practi-tioner more effectively blocks the dualistic appearances of subject and object.Self-consecration, the mandala circle, and the indestructible yogas are consid-ered to be the causal phase of completion because they serve as the causes forthe pristine awareness of great bliss (IOK, vol. II, p. 687).Alternatively, the indestructible yoga may refer to the sixfold yoga of theKalachakra system also called indestructible yoga.324. The “all-shaking avadhuti” (avadhÒti, kun ’dar) conduct means “shakingoff” or casting off dualistic thoughts. It consists of engaging in all kinds of activi-ties that give rise to ordinary excitement: partaking of the five nectars and fivemeats, union with consorts, etc. It is performed in secret or in disguise (i.e., pre-tending to be crazy), either to deepen the yoga of the deity or to enhance theexperience of clear light. The beginner’s level (at which this conduct is prac-ticed) requires having entered the path and having acquired a stable experienceof pristine awareness.The “ever-perfect conduct” (kun tu bzang po) means that whatever actions oneperforms, whether conventionally good or bad, all are inherently perfect. Thisconduct is performed openly since the yogin has attained stability, and it con-sists in leading others on the right path by displaying miraculous feats or gath-ering dakinis through power gazes, etc. The ever-perfect conduct is performedby an experienced practitioner who has experienced the dissolution of manifestconceptual constructions. Thus, it is said that these two conducts, although per-formed all the way to awakening, are mainly focused on in the lower path ofpreparation.The conduct “victorious in all quarters” (phyogs las rnam rgyal) means to over-come emotions and to acquire the strength to help others. This conduct entailsgathering goddesses, such as the goddess of water, and relying on them as one’stantric consorts to enable one to immediately attain the vision of reality on thepath of seeing. This is the main conduct to be performed by an accomplishedpractitioner, i.e., one who has attained a great degree of warmth [on the path ofpreparation] indicating that attainment of the actual pristine awareness is close,up until the attainment of full awakening (IOK, vol. III, pp. 543, 549-552).325. Using desire (’dod ’jug) refers to the “conduct” performed by the yogin (oryogini) between meditation sessions of enjoying food, drinks, and other plea-sures. When this conduct is not directly pervaded by non-conceptual pristineawareness, it is said to be common; when pervaded, it is uncommon (IOK, vol.III, p. 536).326. The common practice of training and enjoying pleasures (brten slob) in con-junction with complex (spros bcas), unelaborated (spros med), and utterly simpleconducts (shin tu spros med) is principally taught in the father tantras. To trainand enjoy pleasures in conjunction with complex conduct means to cultivate aconceptually based meditation in which one imagines whatever appears to one’ssenses to be the male and female deities and in this way to enjoy all the senseobjects one encounters. To train and enjoy pleasure in conjunction with theunelaborated conduct means to cultivate a meditation, only partially conceptually"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"506 Buddhist Ethicsbased, which sees one’s faculties and sense objects as those of the deity and toenjoy all sense objects, while understanding that the deity is the appearance ofone’s own mind. To train and enjoy pleasure in conjunction with an utterly simpleactivity means to cultivate the meditation on the form of the deity as being themanifestation of bliss and emptiness and to enjoy sense objects with the under-standing that deity and pleasures have no reality (IOK, vol. III, pp. 536-537). The three types of conduct (complex, etc.) pertaining to the uncommon con-duct of awareness (rig pa brtul zhugs kyi spyod pa) are emphasized primarily inthe mother tantras. In this system, for complex conduct, the yogin wears theornaments and attributes of the deity, relies on consorts who number the femaledeities of the mandala (of his practice), enjoys playful pleasures, such as songs,music, and dances, and makes use of symbolic language. In the unelaboratedconduct, the yogin keeps only one or two consorts and uses a lesser degree ofelaboration in his enjoyments. A practitioner who engages in the utterly simpleconduct dispenses with external elaborations and relies exclusively on a solitarypractice of contemplation (ibid., p. 538).327. Yogins (or yoginis) traversing the two phases of the Highest Yoga Tantraare classified as four types: the beginner yogin (las dang po ba); the yogin onwhom a little pristine awareness has descended (ye shes cung zad babs pa); theyogin who has gained slight mastery over pristine awareness (ye shes la cung zaddbang thob pa); and the yogin who has gained thorough mastery over pristineawareness (ye shes la yang dag par dbang thob pa). The first is unable to sustain aclear appearance of the coarse mandala and the deities for a considerable lengthof time; the second is more advanced but meditation is still unclear on the subtleaspects of the mandala and deities; the third has gained the ability to generate aclear appearance of the mandala and the deities in a tiny drop and is therefore onthe subtle phase of creation; the fourth has attained the actual clear-light aware-ness, onward. See Akya Yongdzin (A kya yongs ’dzin), Presentation of the Groundsand the Paths of Mantra (dPal gsang ba ’dus pa ’phags lugs dang mthun pa’i sngags kyi salam rnam gshad skal bzang ’jug ngogs) (Dharamsala: Namgyal Dratsang, 1969).328. See note 180.329. The dimension of the deity, i.e., the body that manifests in the absence ofconceptualizations (rnam rtog dang bral ba’i sku) refers to a body of only mindand energy (rlung sems tsam gyi sku). The yogin (or yogini) attains such a body assoon as he arises from absorption into the final metaphoric clear-light aware-ness of the black vision called “near attainment,” entered by relying on the prac-tice with an action seal. This marks the entering of the “peak” stage of the pathof preparation (Kongtrul’s IOK, vol. III, p. 514).The absence of conceptualization in this context does not imply the suppres-sion of the eighty natural conceptions (as this occurs on the receptivity stage ofthe path of preparation) or their elimination (that occurs on the path of seeing).Possibly it indicates that at this stage the body of the deity is not conceptuallyconstructed, but actually arises as an illusory body of wind and mind, whichis still impure since the path of seeing, on which emotional impediments are"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Notes to Chapter IV 507eliminated, has not yet been attained.330.

Great power places (yul chen) refers to outer locations found in India, Tibet,and other Himalayan areas, as well as the inner parts of the body. Kongtrulexplains: the yogin who has attained the body of mere energy and mind en-gages in tantric practice in the twenty-four outer places and assembles an en-tourage of consorts, such as Vajravarahi, who dwell in these places. Uniting withthem, he is able to purify the potentialities of the channels, energies, and semi-nal essences of the twenty-four inner power places by absorbing them into thecentral channel.When the potentialities of the channels, energies, and seminal essences of theinner power places of Pulliramalaya in the head, Jalandhara in the crown of thehead, Oddiyana in the right ear, and Arbuda in the upper part of the head boneare purified, the first stage of awakening is attained.

These ten stages are said to be part of the path ofpreparation.The next two stages are called “abstinence from drinking” (’thung gcod) and“subsidiary abstinence from drinking” (nye ba’i ’thung gcod). “Drinking” refersto the emotions and to their predispositions, and “abstinence” to the actual pro-cess by which these are eliminated. “Subsidiary abstinence” refers to the extentto which the emotions have been eliminated. With these, the yogin attains thedimension of the non-dual pristine awareness of the path of seeing, thus mak-ing twelve stages of awakening (sa bcu gnyis).
