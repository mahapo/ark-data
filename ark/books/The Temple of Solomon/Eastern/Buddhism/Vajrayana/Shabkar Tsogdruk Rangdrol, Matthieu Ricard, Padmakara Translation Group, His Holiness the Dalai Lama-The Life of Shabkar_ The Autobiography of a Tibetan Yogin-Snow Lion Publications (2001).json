The latter category consists of works which present the Dharma in a way that is accessible to people without special training. It includes, on the one hand, books which deal with the Stages of the Path, Mind Training, and so forth, and, on the other, books of an inspirational nature contain-ing the lives of great practitioners, spiritual songs, and so forth. The special quality of these books lies in their universal appeal. The life of Milarepa and his Hwulred Tlwusand Songs, for example, are treasured in almost every Tibetan household and also would often be the only additional book that meditators took into retreat with them. I am, therefore, delighted to know that the life-story of another more recent great practitioner, Vll Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol, is also to be pub-lished in English. Regarded by many as the greatest yogi after Milarepa to gain enlighten-ment in one lifetime, he also lived the life of a wandering mendicant teaching by means of spiri-tual songs. Shabkar is particularly celebrated for the absolute purity of his approach to his lama and his personal practice, which freed him from the snare of sectarianism. He is also affection-ately remembered for the kindness of his gently teasing humor. This work will undoubtedly make a great contribution to the growing store of Tibetan literature translated into English, providing a source of inspiration to Buddhist practitioners and general readers alike. I am glad of this opportunity to express my gratitude and admira-tion to Matthieu Ricard and other friends who have labored long under expert guidance to pro-duce it."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Preface The autobiography of Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol is one of the classics of Tibetan Bud-dhist literature and may be counted among the spiritual classics ofhumankind. Like St. Francis, Jalal-ud-din Rumi, Sri Ramakrishna, or the Hasidim, Shabkar exemplifies through his life and legacy the excellence of a particular religious tradition, while transcending particularity and touching the divine in all. In Shabkar's life and songs, we receive a privileged and intimate view of the world of the Buddhist adept, a world of intense self-discipline, but also of humor, vision and joy. It is owing to these qualities, and the simple yet elegant form in which they are here expressed, that Shabkar's work has come to be especially beloved among the people of his native province of Amdo, in northeastern Tibet, who fmd in these pages a companion offering continual wisdom, solace, and the courage needed to face the trials of life. The mixed prose and verse in which Shabkar's autobiography is written is in some respects reminiscent of the campu style of classical Sanskrit poetry, which influenced Tibetan litera-ture primarily through the]atokamala of Aryasura, a work with which Shabkar was certainly famil-iar. Shabkar, however, is no mere imitator of Sanskrit ~a; it is his eschewal, in fact, ofliterary artifice, in favor of the clear and rich idiom of colloquial speech, folk song and traditional folk oratory, that lends his writing much of its distinc-tive flavor. Shabkar's wit and playfulness, his magnificent flights of imagination, his persistence IX in exposing all hypocrisy-these are the qualities that suffuse his work, overriding the niceties of literary style alone. The gentle and kind personality illuminat-ing these pages should not, however, be regarded as an airy proponent of love and light, a New Age prophet before his time. Shabkar's lightness disguises, to some extent, the intense moral rigor of the ascetical ethos he propounded: Shabkar was an effective apostle of vegetarianism among carnivores, of teetotalism among the lush, of renunciation among the worldly. He wins our respect and sympathy not because we always concur with, much less adhere to, the standard upon which he insists, but because his insistence takes the form not of the moralist's harangue but of the songster's jest, and of teaching through his own good example. For above all, Shabkar prac-ticed what he preached. In addition to its religious and literary value, the autobiography ofShabkar presents an excep-tional record of many dimensions of Tibetan life during the early part of the nineteenth century. The author's remarks on pilgrimages, on the donation and redistribution of wealth in connec-tion with religious affairs, on brigands and thieves, and occasionally on politics, all contribute to our understanding of and receptiveness to a now vanished world.

It is a simple and moving account of the life of a wandering hermit from childhood until his ultimate spiritual realization. Shabkar describes all the steps ofhis spiritual path, culminating in the teachings of the Great Perfection, Dzogchen. Like Milarepa, of whom he was said to be an incarnation, his teachings, advice, and accounts of spiritual experiences are expressed in the form of songs. In Amdo, his native province, excerpts of Shabkar's life were often read to the dying instead of the Bardo Thiidrol, the so-called 1ibeta:n Book of the Dead. The story of Shabkar's life illustrates the complete path of Buddhist practice. To begin with, he demonstrates the exemplary path of a perfect practitioner: having become disillusioned with worldly activities, he seeks a spiritual mas-ter, develops confidence in him and follows his instructions. By practicing with complete dedica-tion, in the end he himself becomes an enlight-ened master capable of contributing immensely to the welfare of other beings. Shabkar's account of his progress along the spiritual path is so straightforward, heartfelt, and unaffected that one is encouraged to believe that similar deep faith and diligence would allow anyone else to achieve the same result. Shabkar was born in 1781 among the Nying-mapa yogins of the Rekong region in Amdo, the remote northeast province of Greater Tibet. These yogins were renowned for their mastery of Xlll the Secret Mantrayana practices and gathered in their thousands to engage in meditations and rituals. They were much admired, and some-times feared, for their magical powers. The yogins of Rekong were also famous for their hair, often six feet long, which they wore coiled on the top of their heads. From a very early age, Shabkar showed a strong inclination toward the contemplative life. Even his childhood games were related to the teachings of Lord Buddha. By the age of six or seven, he had already developed a strong desire to practice. Visions, similar to those experienced in advanced Dzogchen practice, came to him naturally. At fifteen years of age, Shabkar felt a strong desire to \"pray to the precious master Guru Padmasambhava, the source of blessings.\" He recited one million Vajra Guru mantras2 and had auspicious dreams, such as of flying through the air, seeing the sun and moon rising simulta-neously, finding jewel treasures, and so forth. \"From then on,\" he wrote, \"by the grace of Guru Rinpoche, I became filled with intense devotion to the guru, affection toward my Dharma friends, compassion for sentient beings, and pure perception toward the teachings. I had the good fortune to accomplish without obstacles whatever Dharma practice I undertook\" (chap. 1 , fol. 19a). At the age of sixteen, he completed a one-year retreat during which he recited the mantra ofManjushri ten million times and experienced auspicious dreams and signs. \"Through the blessing"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xtv The Life of Shabkar of this practice,\" he said, \"I gained a general understanding of the depth and breadth of the teachings.\" Shabkar then metJamyang Gyatso, a master whom he venerated greatly and of whom he later had visions and dreams. Despite his deep affection for his mother and respect for his family, Shabkar managed to resist their repeated requests that he marry. He eventually left home in order to pursue whole-heartedly his spiritual aims. Determined to re-nounce worldly concerns, Shabkar received full monastic ordination at the age of twenty and entered a meditation retreat. He let his hair grow long again, as was customary for retreatants, who did not waste time in nonessential activities; as a sign of having accomplished certain yogic practices, he wore a white shawl rather than the traditional red shawl, although he continued to wear the patched lower robe characteristic of a fully ordained monk. This rather unconventional attire occasionally attracted sarcastic comments from strangers, to whom Shabkar would reply with humorous songs. Shabkar left his native land behind and trav-eled south of Rekong to meet his main teacher, the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo. Ngakyi Wangpo was a learned and accomplished Mon-golian king, said to be an incarnation of Marpa the Translator,3 who had renounced the rem-nants of the vast kingdom of Gushri Khan and become a prominent Nyingmapa master. (Details about Ngakyi Wangpo's ancestry are given in Appendix 3.) As Shabkar says of him, \"He had crossed the ocean of the knowledge of the scriptures and sciences and realized the natural state, the pro-: found and luminous vajra essence. Because I saw all his actions as pure and did whatever he asked, he came to think of me as a heart-son. There-fore, he gave me all the pith instructions of the Old and New Translation schools, as if filling a vessel to the brim.\" Mter receiving complete instructions from the Dharma King, Shabkar practiced for five years in the wilderness of Tseshung, where his meditation experiences and realization flourished. He then meditated for three years on a small island, Tsonying, the \"Heart of the Lake,\" in the Kokonor, the Blue Lake of Amdo. There he experienced numerous dreams and visions of gurus and deities. His search for sacred places took him to many other solitary retreats: the glaciers of Machen, the sacred caves of the White Rock Monkey Fortress, the arduous pilgrimage of the Ravines ofT sari, Mount Kailash, and the Lapchi Snow Range. He spent many years in the very caves where Milarepa and other saints had lived and meditated. Shabkar's given names werejampa Chodar, \"The Loving One Who Spreads the Dharma,\" and Tsogdruk Rangdrol, \"Self-liberation of the Six Senses.\" He became renowned as Shabkar Lama, the ''White Footprint Lama,\" because he spent years in meditation at Mount Kailash above Milarepa's4 Cave of Miracles, near the famous White Footprint, one of the four footprints said to have been left by Buddha Shakyamuni when he traveled miraculously to Kailash. It is also said that Shabkar was called ''White Foot\" because wherever he would set his feet, the land would become \"white,\" meaning that through his teachings the minds of the people would be turned toward the holy Dharma. Wandering as a homeless yogin, teaching all beings from bandits to wild animals, Shabkar's pilgrimages brought him as far as Nepal, where, in the Kathmandu Valley, he covered the entire spire of the Bodhnath stupa with the gold his devotees had offered him. In 1828, at the age of forty-seven, Shabkar returned to Amdo, where he tirelessly helped others through his extraordinary compassion. He spent the last twenty years of his life teaching disciples, promoting peace in the area, and prac-ticing meditation in retreat at various sacred places, primarily at his hermitage in T ashikhyil. Oral traditions recount even more stories of this great yogin's life than the present autobiog-raphy. For instance, they say that Shabkar fed hundreds ofbeggars, asking them to gather stones to make stupas5 in return. When invited to teach, Shabkar would agree to come, provided that the benefactors also fed all the beggars who accom-panied him. The horde ofbeggars would usually arrive first, followed by Shabkar himself on foot,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"leaning on the famous walking stick he used to call his \"horse,\" which itself was the subject of some ofhis songs. The reputation ofShabkar, the perfect her-mit, spread far and wide, inspiring another great renunciate, Patrul Rinpoche, 6 to travel from Kham to Amdo to meet him. Unfortunately, after Patrul had gone only halfway he heard that Shabkar had passed away, whereupon he pros-trated himself a hundred times in the direction of Amdo and sang a supplication for Shabkar's swift rebirth. He then added, \"Compassion and love are the root of Dharma. I think that there was no one more compassionate than Shabkar in this world. I had nothing special to ask, no teachings to request from him, no teaching to offer him; I simply wanted to gather some merit by seeing his face.\" Two successive incarnations ofShabkarwere recognized in Amdo, but neither had the spiri-tual charisma of its predecessor. 7 Once, when H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche8 went to Shohong, Shabkar's birthplace, to bestow the empowerments of the Treasury of &discovered Teach-ings,9 he sat on a stone seat under a particular tree where Shabkar had often sat to sing spiritual songs. While Khyentse Rinpoche himself sat and sang there, a rain of flowers fell on him from the tree. He felt this signified a special karmic con-nection between himself and Shabkar. Many people thought that he was perhaps Shabkar's incarnation. Shabkar lived at a time in Tibetan history when many spiritual lineages were on the verge of extinction. Bitter religious sectarianism and tribal feuds divided monasteries and peoples. 10 Transcending these differences, Shabkar exem-plified religious tolerance, altruism and \"pure perception,\"11 the foremost characteristics of a genuine Buddhist practitioner. A vision of Guru Padmasambhava he expe-rienced toward the end of his life is typical of Shabkar's Rimey (nonsectarian) approach to the four main schools ofTibetan Buddhism. During the vision, Shabkar tells Guru Padmasambhava, \"I have prayed to you all my life and have been blessed by visions of many other deities and spiritual masters, but only no\\Y do you appear to Translator's Introduction xv me.\" Guru Padmasambhava replied, \"Do you remember when, on the island of The Heart of the l.a.ke, you had a vision ofTsongkhapa, who gave you the teaching on the Graded Path? That was I.\" In 1he Emanated Scriptures of Orgyen, in which Shabkar recounts this vision, he expresses his faith in the inseparability of Guru Padma-sambhava, Atisha, and Tsongkhapa, a triad of teachers who dominated Shabkar's life, practice, and teaching. 12 The core ofShabkar's practice was the Great Perfection, Atiyoga, the summit of the nine ve-hicles, the extraordinary treasure of the Nyingma tradition. Yet his realization of the Great Perfec-tion was fmnly grounded in the impeccable pre-cepts of the Kadampa masters, which inspire practitioners to have few needs and desires; au-thentic feelings of renunciation, humility and inner calm, loving-kindness, compassion and, above all, the precious Bodhicitta-the intense resolve to bring all sentient beings tb the perfect freedom of enlightenment. Shabkar did not merely receive teachings from all traditions ofTibetan Buddhism, but he actively taught \"pure perception\" and open-mindedness. Moreover, he eloquently elucidated how all the many different Dharma teachings of the various yanas form one coherent, noncontra-dictory whole. He contributed greatly to the nonsectarian movement that flourished in the nineteenth century and that culminated in lumi-naries such asjamgon Kongtrul,Jamyang Khy-entse W angpo, Patrul Rinpoche and Lama Mipham. 13 Gathering teachings from all areas of Tibet and from masters of all spiritual tradi-tions, these teachers-themselves all authentic masters, scholars, poets, commentators, and ac-complished yogins-saved the heritage of Ti-betan Buddhism from decline and restored its vitality, a heritage still benefiting us today. The essential teachings were compiled into major collections, such asjamgon Kongtrul's Fi:oe Great Treasuries, so that they could be practiced and transmitted to future generations. As was often the case with spiritual leaders in Tibet, Shabkar became an active force in mediating peace. In Amdo, which had known centuries of conflict among the disparate elements"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xv1 The life of Shabkar of the Tibetan population, Mongolian nomads, and Chinese invaders, time after time he served as a mediator in order to bring bloody feuds to an end and establish peace. He inspired high-waymen to give up banditry and crime, and even persuaded Chinese Muslims to rebuild the Buddhist temples they had burned down. Shabkar's many didactic songs teach us the value and significance ofhuman life, the mean-ing of death and impermanence, the law of karma, and the suffering inherent in samsara. He often extols the benefits of renunciation, the need to rely upon a qualified teacher and to cultivate devotion, the view of emptiness imbued with the heart of great compassion, and fmally, the realization of the Great Perfection-the pri-mordial, unchanging purity of all phenomena, the innate Buddha-nature. Not only does Shabkar explain all this, but he urges and inspires us to make these teachings a living experience, a part of ourselves. These songs and teachings do not necessar-ily appear in the biography in the same order as they would in a systematic exposition of the stages of the path. Therefore, an overview of this path, according to the nine vehicles of the Nyingma tradition, can be found in Appendix 1.14 In addition to his biography, Shabkar left numerous clear and inspiring teachings, among which is the famous Flight of the Garuda. His vast realization and knowledge, remarkable memory, matchless faculty of improvisation, pure percep-tion of all spiritual traditions, and above all his heartfelt compassion and constant wish to ben-efit others, yielded many volumes of writings that have now (for the most part) been reprinted in India and in Tibet (see Appendix 5 and the excellent review of Shabkar's writings by Pal Gyalkar, 1993) The distinctive characteristics of Shabkar's works include directness, simplicity, profundity, and the power to encourage the reader to engage in spiritual practice. He does not write to flaunt his lmowledge or to gain fame as a philosopher, but rather to tum readers' minds toward the Dharma, sustain their enthusiasm, and prevent them from becoming sidetracked or falling into the pitfalls that lie along the path to liberation. Shabkar's sources of inspiration are many and various, reflecting the breadth ofhis training and his almost unique openness to all traditions. In his songs are themes and verses that have their roots in the writings ofLongchen Rabjam14 and other masters of the Nyingma tradition such as Karma Lingpa (1326-?; see chap. 1, note 62). Constant inspiration is provided by the songs of Jetsun Milarepa, as well as Lord Atisha and his spiritual heirs, the masters of the Kadam tradi-tion. Shabkar died in 1851. His life-story can move one to tears or to laughter; but above all, as H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche said, \"As one reads it, one's mind carmot resist being turned toward the Dharma.\" Buddhism in Tzhet The Buddhist teachings originated in India in the sixth century B.C.E. with Buddha Shakyamuni. and spread to Tibet in the fifth century C. E. when King I.hathori Nyentsen (b. 433) brought the first Buddhist scriptures to the Land of Snows. However, it was during the reigns of King Songtsen Gampo (617?-50) and King Trisong Detsen (b. 730 or 742) that the teachings of the Buddha actually took root and flourished in Tibet.16 Wishing to establish a large monastery, King Trisong Detsen invited the Abbot Shantarakshita from India Mter vainly attempting to subdue the negative forces and mountain gods averse to the propagation of Buddhism, Shantarakshita declared that only Padmasambhava, the \"Lotus-born Guru,\" could succeed in this task. This powerful tantric master-also lmown as Guru Rinpoche, the \"Precious Teacher,\" and revered by the Tibetans as the second Buddha-was invited to Tibet, and Samye Monastery was then constructed and consecrated. Shantarakshita introduced to Tibet the un-broken lineage of monastic ordination, while Guru Padmasambhava bestowed Vajrayana ini-tiations and imparted essential instructions. At"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the behest of the King, the Abbot Shantarakshita and the Master Padmasambhava, Tibetan trans-lators, led by V airocana, along with Indian panditas led by Vimalamitra, translated into Tibetan the entire Tripitaka-the \"Three Baskets\" of the Buddha's words-as well as countless tantras, commentaries, and ritual texts used in medita-tion practice. For the sake of future generations, Padmasambhava, the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal, and his other chief disciples concealed countless teach-ings in the form of spiritual treasures, or termas.17 Despite a period (841-46) of intense perse-cution by King Langdarma, the Buddha's Dharma flourished. New waves of translations brought even more scriptures to Tibet from India, and numerous schools bloomed, follow-ing the appearance of many remarkable saints and scholars. Principal among these schools are the re-nowned \"eight great chariots of the practice lin-eages\" (see Appendix 1 ). From these, four main traditions emerged-Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Geluk -which continue to this day to foster the rich contemplative and philosophical heri-tage ofTibet. The ancient indigenous Tibetan religion, known as Bon, has also survived, heavily influ-enced by the advent in Tibet of Buddhist doc-trine. Tibetan Buddhism itself transmuted and incorporated some local Bon customs, as tradi-tional Buddhism in spreading has done within the culture of each new country it has encoun-tered.18 Tibetan sacred literature, one of the richest in the world, abounds with treatises on religious history and practice, philosophy, hagiographies, and instructions for contemplative life. As His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama often stresses, the Tibetan tradition appears to be the only culture in which all the various aspects of Bud-dhism-Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana -have not only been preserved, but can be practiced in an integrated, harmonious and ef-fective way. These three yanas, or \"vehicles,\" correspond to the three fundamental aspects of the Buddhist teachings: renunciation, compas-sion and \"pure vision.\" Renunciation, the foundation of the Hina-Translator's Introduction xvu yana and therefore the root of all subsequent vehicles, implies the strong wish to free oneself not only from the current sorrows oflife but from the seemingly unending sufferings of samsara, the vicious cycle of conditioned existence. Re-nunciation accompanies a profound weariness, a dissatisfaction with the conditions of samsara, and a heartfelt disillusionment with worldly con-cerns. Compassion, the driving force of the Mahayana, is born from the realization that both the individual \"self' and the appearances of the phenomenal world are devoid of any intrin-sic reality. To misconstrue the infinite display of illusory appearances as permanent entities is ignorance, which results in suffering. An enlightened being-that is, one who has understood the ultimate nature of all things-naturally feels boundless compassion for those who, under the spell of ignorance, are wander-ing and suffering in samsara. From similar com-passion, the Mahayana student on the spiritual path does not aim for his own liberation alone, but vows to attain Buddhahood in order to gain the capacity to free all sentient beings from the suffering inherent in samsara. \"Pure vision,\" the extraordinary outlook of the Vajrayana or Adamantine Vehicle, is to rec-ognize Buddha-nature in all sentient beings and to see primordial purity and perfection in all phenomena. Every sentient being is endowed with the essence of Buddhahood, just as oil per-vades every sesame seed. Ignorance is nothing more than lack of awareness of this very Bud-dha-nature, as when a pauper does not see the golden pot buried beneath his own hut. The spiritual path is thus a rediscovery of this forgot-ten nature, just as one sees again the immutable brilliance of the sun once the clouds that were masking it have been blown away. The remarkable feature of the Tibetan tra-dition of the three yanas is how each step of the gradual path is enhanced with the practice of the next. Just as an alchemist might transform a piece of iron, fust into copper and fmally into gold, so the renunciation of the Lesser Vehicle is ennobled and widened by the universal compas-sion of the Great Vehicle, which itself becomes"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvm The Life of Shabkar infinitely vast and profound when suffused by the view of the Adamantine Vehicle. Shabkar appeared at a time when the integ-rity of the doctrine had eroded and many invalu-able teachings were on the verge of disappearing. Sectarian bitterness often prevailed over pure perception and mutual respect. Am do was mainly a Gelukpa stronghold, strewn with smaller mon-asteries and retreat centers founded by highly realized Nyingmapa yogins such as Do Drupchen Trinley Oser, Dolajigme Kalzang, and Choying Topden Dmje. In this situation, which often led to narrow-mindedness, Shabkar, transcending all sectari-anism, perceived the deep unity of all traditions. He made fruitful use of the extraordinary poten-tial inherent in combining the altruistic Mind Training taught by Atisha (and developed by Tsongkhapa as the foundation of the gradual path) with the most profound practices of the Nyingma tradition. Tibetan masters often say that understanding the teachings of all Buddhist traditions to be noncontradictory is the sign of true knowledge. Shabkar says, In the snow ranges of Tibet, Owing to the kindness of sublime beings of the past, Many profound teachings were taught. These days most practitioners Hold the various teachings to be contradic-tory, Like heat and cold. They praise some teachings and disparage others. Some holy beings have said that Madhyarnika, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen Are like sugar, molasses, and honey: One is as good as the other. For this reason, I have listened to And practiced all of them without partiality. Shabkar can thus be compared to the other masters of the nonsectarian (Rimey) movement who, in the nineteenth century, restored the spiri-tual integrity and vigor of Tibetan Buddhism and saved it from sinking into a quagmire of doctrinal contention, far removed from spiritual realization and pure perception. Shabko.r's Biographies Tibetan hagiographies are called namJlzar, which means \"perfect, or complete, liberation.\" A nam-thar is not only the detailed account of a saintly person's life, but the description of his or her journey to liberation: a narrative and a teaching as well (see Willis 1985). More than any other teaching in fact, a namthar leaves a deep impres-sion on the reader's mind. Far from abstract considerations, it puts in our hands a chart to guide us on the journey, a testimony that the journey can be accomplished, and a powerful incentive to set out swiftly on the path. Namtlzars of recent masters remind one that these accounts are not ancient fairy tales; they demonstrate that, even in our time, there are accomplished beings who are living examples of enlightenment.19 This volume, entitled The Kzng ofWzsh-grant-ing Jewels Thoi Fulfills the Hopes qf all Fortunate Disciples who Seek liheration, the detailed narration qf the ljfe and liheration qf the great vajra-holder Shabkar, rrfoge and protectm for all sentient beings qf this dark age is a translation of Shabkar's autobiography describ-ing the events of his life up to the age of fifty-six. It constitutes the 970-page first part of volume Ka ofShabkar's Collected Writings. Fine wooden blocks of this work had been carved at Tashikhyil Hermitage, Shabkar's seat in Amdo, but were destroyed after the Chinese invasion of 1959. A few prints made from these were brought from Tibet and a two-volume re-print was made in India in 1983 under the aus-pices ofH.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. In 1985, the Qinghai Nationalities Press also published a 1097-page edition in book form. A second, 684-page autobiographical vol-ume (Ka, part 2), not translated here, covers Shabkar's life from the age of fifty-six until his death at the age of seventy. It contains spiritual songs and teachings, interspersed with brief descriptions of Shabkar's travels in Amdo and his meetings with his disciples and with other"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"teachers. This later work ends with a section in which Changlung Tulku Khyapdal Longyang, 20 one of Shabkar's closest disciples, recounts important events and miracles performed by Shabkar that are not included in the autobiogra-phies, and describes the last moments of the master's life. Reprints of volume Ka, part 2, were also made in India (as vol. 3 of the Collected Writzngs) and in Tibet by the Qinghai Nationalities Press (fS 2). Valuable biographical information can also be gathered from Shabkar's Collection of Songs and from his other writings. According to reliable Tibetan sources, a manuscript ofShabkar's SecretAutobiograph:J (gsang ba'i mom thor), for which wooden blocks were never carved, has been preserved in Amdo. Genesis of the AutobWgraph:J Between 1806 and 1809, while he was staying at Tsonying Island, Shabkar wrote down some of his early life-story at the request ofPema Rangdrol and other disciples. A manuscript of this first autobiography has been found in northern Nepal (see Appendix 6, mom tho:r dngos). It is clear that Shabkar must have referred to this fust version when compiling the initial chapters of the com-plete autobiography, since much of the material is identical. Curiously enough, a few anecdotes and details mentioned in the fust version do not appear in the more exhaustive final version. Perna Rangdrol also composed a biography covering the events of his master's life up to Shabkar's pilgrimage to central Tibet (1810).21 This work has not survived. At Lapchi (1819-22), Shabkar recounted his life-story to a group of disciples, who then wrote down what they had heard. Finally, in 183 7, acceding to the persistent requests of his disciples, Shabkar himself began composing the fust section ofhis complete autobiography. Insight into the composition of the fmal ver-sion may arise through examination of a set of three manuscripts (DOL 1, 2, 3) discovered in the Tarap Valley of Dolpo, in Nepal.22 These texts reveal that the majority of the material in chapter 11 and all of the songs and teachings in chapter 12 already existed in fmal form as early Translator's Introduction XIX as 1814-24. TheDolpomanuscriptsendabruptly with an appeal to generous patrons to contribute to the restoration of the T ashi Gomang stupa of Chung Riwoche which occurred in 1824.23 M-ter the restoration, Shabkar left western Tibet. For these and other reasons, 24 it is logical to assume that the Dolpo manuscripts, or perhaps the texts from which they were copied, were compiled during the time Shabkar lived in west-em Tibet ( 1814-24). The remaining songs from the Dolpo manuscripts which were not used in the 1837 autobiography form part of the second volume ofShabkar's Collected Songs(fS 4), which was compiled after he returned to Amdo. Chapters 11 and 12 of the autobiography are thus a vivid account, written down in 1837, of the events of Shabkar's life at Kailash and in Nepal. They are interspersed with songs he had sung and teachings he had given, and which had been written down at the very time those events took place (1814-24). These songs and teachings are therefore much more likely to be an accurate rendering of Shabkar's words than if they had merely been reconstructed from memory twenty years after the events had occurred. In other cases as well, it is clear that Shabkar kept written records of his songs and teachings. From Tsonying Island, for instance, Shabkar sent a collection of a thousand songs to his friends and disciples at Rekong. 25 There are also collections of songs related to each of the main sacred places where Shabkar lived and meditated (see Appendix 5). One may thus infer that Shabkar chose to incorporate into his fmal 1837 autobiography a selection of the many songs he had composed throughout his life, the rest being compiled into his Collected Songs. Shabkar's Former Incarnations In chapter 14, at the request of a disciple, Shabkar writes a prayer that recounts his previous incar-nations within all the main schools of Buddhism in Tibet: Many, many aeons ago, Having swiftly attained perfect Buddhahood,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"xx The Life qf Shabkar To benefit sentient beings and the Dharma of the Buddha, He manifested in whatever manner was appropriate to transform beings. At the time of the Buddha he was Avalokiteshvara, In the land of India he was Manjush-rimitra, In the center ofTibet he became Trenpa Namkha, In the Kagyu tradition he was Milarepa, In the Kadampa lineage he was the Glorious Gyalse Thogme, In the Ganden lineage he was the Lord Lodro Gyaltsen, In the nonsectarian lineage he manifested to beings as Thangtong Gyalpo. Now he is the protector of beings, Shabkarpa. In future, in the presence of the Lords of the Five Families, In Manifest Joy and every other Buddhafield, He will be a supreme son Who will lead all those who have made a connection with him To whichever Pure Land they desire. Fundamentally, Shabkar was considered to be an emanation of Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of compassion, 26 which would account for the strong emphasis which he places on compassion and Bodhicitta in his practice and teachings. Shabkarwas also an emanation ofManjush-rimitra (in Tibetan Jampel Shenyen), 27 one of the main patriarchs of the Nyingma tradition. Manjushrimitra was a disciple of Garab Dmje (the first master of the Dzogchen lineage) and the teacher of Shri Singha and Guru Padrnasam-bhava According to Buddhist sources, Trenpa Namkha was a Bonpo master who embraced Buddhism and became one of the twenty-five main disciples of Padmasambhava. Having attained realization, he was able to manifest vari-ous miraculous powers. In particular, he was able to tame the fierce wild yaks of the northern plateaus ofTibet. As related in a short biography by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo written accord-ing to traditional Bonpo sources, Trenpa Namkha was an extraordinary being. 28 He was said to be the father of Perna Thongdrol, a name given to Padrnasambhava by the Bonpo, who considered him to have been born of a human mother rather than from a lotus. However, it is as an emanation of Jetsun Milarepa, the cotton-clad yogin ( 1 04G-1123), that Shabkar is chiefly celebrated. His life of renunciation and solitary practice, the large fol-lowing of renunciate disciples he had in the later part of his life, and his inexhaustible faculty for teaching througli improvised songs are strikingly reminiscent ofMilarepa's life. Shabkar's princi-pal teacher, the Mongolian king Chogyal N gakyi Wangpo, was himself considered to be an incar-nation ofMarpa the Translator, Milarepa's spiri-tual master. When Shabkar went to the Cave of the Subjugation of Mara in Lapchi where Milarepa had spent a long period in solitary retreat, he indicated the existence of a second entrance to the cave. The entrance was unearthed and the remnants ofMilarepa's stone hearth were redis-covered. All those assembled there were con-vinced by these events that Shabkar was in fact the incarnation ofMilarepa (see chap. 13). Shabkar is frequendy depicted as a yogin who is posed like Milarepa, his right hand cupped behind his ear-a gesture which signifies listen-ing to the celestial voices of the dakinis. A few details, however, distinguish the two masters. Shabkar's long hair is not loose on his shoulders like that of Milarepa, but is ~oiled and knotted above his head in the fashion of the yogins of Rekong. Also, Shabkar holds a skull-cup in his left hand and has a walking stick at his left side; his upper garb is indeed the white cotton shawl of a repa, 29 but his lower robe is the patched red skirt of a fully ordained monk. In the Kadampa and Sakya lineages, Shabkar was considered to have been the incar-nation ofNgulchu Gyalse Thogme (1295-1369), a great Bodhisattva and teacher who exempli-fied compassion in all his actions and embodied"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the Kadampa ideal of exchanging one's own happiness for the suffering of others (as can be seen in his biography by Palden Y eshe). 30 Gyalse Thogrne was the author of the well-known 1hi:r!J-Sevenfold Practice qf a Bodhisattva, which presents the essence of the Bodhisattva path, and of com-mentaries on Engaging in the Bodhisattva's ActiuitJ (Bodhicaryavatara) and several other major Mahayana texts. In the Ganden, or Geluk, lineage (the New Kadampa tradition), Shabkar was considered to have been the Lord Chen-ngawa Lodro Gyaltsen (1402-72), a disciple ofje Tsongkhapa belong-ing to the Phagrno Drupa family; he was the author of many teachings on Lojong practice, including the famous compendium Opening the Door to Mind Training. 31 In the nonsectarian lineages, Shabkar was Thangtong Gyalpo (1361-1485), the \"King of the Empty Plain,\"32 an incarnation of Avalo-kiteshvara and of the mind-aspect of Guru Padmasambhava. 33 This famous Tibetan siddha practiced and taught Buddhist teachings from all the traditional lineages, although his own special realization came from the practice of the North-em Treasures34 of the Nyingma tradition and of the Shangpa Kagyu teachings, which he received in three visions from the wisdom dakini Niguma 35 In a vision, Thangtong Gyalpo also traveled to the Glorious Copper-colored Mountain where he received teaching from Guru Padmasambhavahim-self He is famous for his meditation practice for achieving longevity, probably the most popular of its kind in Tibet36 Following a vision ofVajravarahi, he wrote a set of vajra verses which were later elaborated by his spiritual heirs into a complete cycle of spiritual practices known as the Oral Transmission of 7hongtnng. 37 He is also remembered for building fifty-eight iron suspension bridges, many of which still span the rivers of Tibet and Bhutan. Among the native people he is beloved for having created the well-known Ache lilamo dance rituals, colloquially known as Tibetan Opera. He passed away at Chung Riwoche, in western Tibet, at the age of 125 years. His Teachers and lineage Although Shabkar sought the blessing and in-structions of numerous teachers throughout his Translator's Introduction XXI life, three were, by his own account (see TN 4, p. 823), central to his spiritual development: Jampel Dmje, Jamyang Gyatso and, above all, Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo. At eleven Shabkar entered the community of ngakpas of Shohong, \"a community known for their pure samay~8 and unshakable faith in the Secret Mantra tradition of the Early Translation · school.\" At twelve he was introduced to basic Nyingma practice by the master Orgyen Trinley Namgyal (see chap. 1, fol. 18a). Shabkar's first Dzogchen master wasjampel Dorje Rinpoche (d. 1817??9 who gave him the initiation of the Dzogchen Ati {_abdon40 of the Mindroling tradition and the instructions that introduce one direcdy to the ultimate nature of mind. These and other transmissions given by this master suggest that he was a holder of the traditions of the two main Nyingrna monasteries of central Tibet: Mindroling and Dmje Trak (see chap. 1, fol. 19a). Around 1797 Shabkar metJamyang Gyatso Rinpoche (d. 1800), a highly accomplished mas-ter thoroughly versed in the teachings of both Nyingma and Sarma, the Old and the New traditions (see Appendix 1 ). Shabkar revered him gready and had several visions and dreams of him after this master passed away. From him, Shabkar received many empowerments on the cycles of rediscovered treasures of Raton Terton,41 TennyiLingpa(1480-1535),42 Karma Lingpa (b. 1326),Jigme Lingpa (1729-98), 43 and Lodrak Drupchen ukyi Dmje (132~1401),44 as well as teachings on Mind Training and medi-tation. The list of the Nyingrna teachings Shabkar received from Jam yang Gyatso, and later from Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo and other masters, shows close connections between the lineages of these two spiritual masters, as it appears in tables 1, 2, and 4. At the age of twenty, Shabkar received the full monastic ordination at Dobi Monastery45 from Arik Geshe Rinpochejampel Gelek Gyal-tsen (1726-1803), also known as Gyaltsen Oser, a famous Gelukpa scholar-saint considered to be an emanation ofNagarjuna.46 He gave Shabkar the monastic name Jampa Chodar, 1he I.nving"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"xxii The Life of Shabkar One JiYlzo Spreads the Dho.rma, and advised him to meet the great Nyingma master Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo. The dominant inspiration ofShabkar's spiri-tual life, his root teacher, was Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo (1736-1807), said to be an emanation of both Guru Padmasambhava and Marpa the Translator. His full name was Pontsang Dalai Tai Ching-wang Ngawang Dargye Pal Zangpo, the \"Great Oceanic King, Glorious and Excellent All-Bloom-ing Lord ofSpeech.\" There is no known biogra-phy of this master; however, a few details about his life can be gathered from Shabkar's autobi-ography, from the Ocean Annals (a mdo clws 'hyung deb tlzer rgya mtslw, the Amdo Chifjung abbreviated below as AC), and from oral tradition. Ngakyi Wangpo's predecessors were influ-ential rulers, and one ofthem had donated the land toJamyang Shepa47 for the construction of Labrang Tashikhyil Monastery, founded in 1708/10. (Ngakyi Wangpo's complex ancestry is summarized in table 3 and in Appendix 3.) Although his family had been connected with the Gelukpa lineage, Ngakyi Wangpo became a Nyingma practitioner. He was a dis-ciple ofOrgyen Tendzin, the spiritual heir of the great terton Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo (see Appendix 4). Ngakyi Wangpo became one of the main holders of Dechen Gyalpo's rediscov-ered treasures, aithough it is uncertain whether he met the terton himsel£ Ngakyi Wangpo was also a disciple of the first Do Drupchen, Jigme Trinley Oser, the principal Dharma heir of Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa's limgchen Nyingthig lin-eage.48 Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo, better known as a ruler under the name ofNgawang Dargye, was one of the two kings who governed the Kokonor region. 49 He was a descendant of Gushri Khan (1592-1654), a Qosot Mongol king called Ten-dzin Chogyal by the Tibetans. His tribal group had migrated from their Urumchi grazing land, in what is today Xinjiang, to new territories south of Lake Kokonor, near the Machu River (the upper reaches of the Huang Ho, the Yellow River of China). In Shabkar's autobiography, ''Mongolia\" (sog po) refers to the area that might be called \"little Mongolia,\" a district south of Rekong in Amdo where many tent-dwelling Mongolian tribes had settled two centuries before. Thoroughly assimi-lated, they spoke only the local Amdo Tibetan dialect. Urgeh, Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo's seat in this nomadic area, was a large encampment of tents. There was, however, at least one major monastery in the area, called Urgeh Tratsang Sang-ngak Mingyeling. It was founded under the patronage of one ofNgakyi Wangpo's ances-tors, Dar Gyalpo Shoktu. Ngakyi Wangpo fur-ther enhanced the monastery's prosperity; he had 108 monks reside there, and arranged that large ceremonies be performed every year. The monastery initially belonged to the Gelukpa school but, probably under the inspiration of Ngakyi Wangpo, it later turned to the Nyingma tradition. 50 Beginning with teaching Lol?J'ong teaching on Mind Training, Ngakyi Wangpo gradually taught Shabkar the complete path of the three vehicles. His teachings focused on the Vajrayana empow-erment of the Wtsh-.folfifling Gem, Hayagriva and V arahi., a spiritual treasure (gter ma) revealed by Terton Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo that was to become Shabkar's main practice. It was during this empowerment that Shabkar received the name Tsogdruk Rangdrol, \"Self-liberation of the Six Senses,\" which refers to the natural libera-tion of ordinary dualistic perception (which occurs by means of the perceptions associated with each of the five sense organs and with the sixth sense, intellectual cognition) into the ultimate nature of emptiness and awareness. Since the practice of the Wish-fo!filling Gem, Hayagriva and Varahi occupies a central place in Shabkar's spiritual practice and in his lineage, its origin is described in Appendix 4. The Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo then gave Shabkar teachings on the development stage, related to the Vase Empowerment. Next, he taught about the channels and energy practice of tummo, related to the Secret Empowerment Then he gave teachings on the bliss-void practice of the m'LIIira, related to the Wisdom Empower-ment; and finally, he gave teachings on Trekcho"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"and Thogal, related to the Word, or Symbolic Empowerment. On subsequent occasions, he imparted to Shabkar the transmission of teachings from Lodrak Drupchen Lekyi Dorje; teachings on Mahamudra; the Dzogchen Yeske Lamtf11 ofjigme Lingpa; Nyima Trakpa's(l647-1710)Dzogchen teaching; and the Khandro Nyi:ngthig, 52 the chief Dzogchen teachings of Guru Padmasambhava as revealed by Perna Ledrelstel. Ngakyi Wangpo inspired Shabkar to study the Seven Treasuries, the 1hree Great Chariots, and other writings ofLongchen Rabjam, a corpus of works that form the quintessence of the Nyingma tradition. He also requested one ofhis own teach-ers, Lamajimba, to teach Shabkar the Vinaya, the rules of monastic discipline. Until his death in 1807, Ngakyi Wangpo guided Shabkar with great love and tenderness, and considered him his spiritual heir. After his guru passed away, Shabkar had several visions of him. It is said that before leaving this world Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo showed his disciples a rosary on which he had recited the Vajra Guru mantra of Guru Padmasambhava one hundred million times (see AC, val. 2, p. 123). He told them, \"Once I am dead, don't remove this rosary from my neck; cremate it with my body.\" Mter the cremation, the rosary was lying still intact in the ashes, and images of the Buddha Shakyamuni and of other deities were found on the Dharma King's skull as well as on the bones of his hand. Shabkar had many other teachers, the most important of whom are listed in Appendix 2. Shabkar's lineage still flourishes today. Not only are his writings extremely popular among Tibetans, but Dechen Gyalpo's esoteric Wtsh-.folJilling Gem, Hayagriw and Varahi, which was trans-mitted through Shabkar, is still practiced today (see Appendix 4). There has rarely been a lama who traveled around Tibet as much as Shabkar did, and inspired so many disciples over the entire country. At the end of the autobiography Shabkar says: I had a hundred and eight great spiritual children, wise and accomplished, Translator's Introduction xxm Who, having perfected themselves, were able to benefit others; Over three hundred practitioners who, having attained Consummate loving-kindness, compassion and Bodhicitta, ceased eating meat; One thousand eight hundred great medita-tors, men and women, Who gave up all concern for this life and practiced in solitary places; Tens of thousands of monks and nuns dwelling in monasteries Who worked hard at prostrations, offer-ings, circumambulations and other vir-tuous actions; And countless ngakpas, village practitioners and householders Who fasted, completed extensive recita-tions and sadhanas, and chanted the mant. I ransomed the lives of several hundred thousand animals53-Goats, sheep, birds, fish, and other wild animals. I protected and saved the lives of five hundred people Afflicted by hunger, cold, sickness, evil influences and enemies.

In brief, by the compassion of my gurus and the Three jewels Great benefit was brought to the Dharma and all beings . To conclude every action I did in accordance with Dharma, I offered vast dedications and prayers. A brief survey of Shabkar's most important dis-ciples is given in Appendix 6.

Spe-cialized scholars will have no difficulty identify-ing the Sanskrit terms and phrases that do occur. The page numbers of the Tibetan text are given within square brackets and correspond to the Tibetan numbering of the T ashikhyil wood-block prints.

The general in-dex is a thematic index of topics and concepts. A list of the abbreviations used in the work is given at the end of the main text. For readers inter-ested in more details about Shabkar's teachers, writings, and disciples, several appendices are provided. Shabkar usually follows the traditional for-mat, which appends a lengthy verse summary to the end of each chapter. Since these summaries appear redundant in an English translation, we have omitted them. About the Translation The first impulse to undertake this translation occurred in the early eighties to a few Dharma friends over a cup of tea at Shechen Monastery, near the Great Stupa ofBodhnath in Kathmandu Valley. We were speaking of the unique enchant-ment ofShabkar's autobiography and found that all of us cherished the wish to translate it into Western languages, but hesitated to embark on such a vast project. One person said, \"Let's just do it!\" and everyone present agreed. The text was divided up among the transla-tors, some taking large sections, and others single chapters. After a few months, first drafts appeared. Then, the author of this introduction began to review the drafts that he and the others had prepared. Over a longer period of time, he pre-pared the subsequent drafts, notes, and appendices, in constant collaboration with learned lamas and with the main editor who reworked extensively the songs and poems. This work was carried out mainly in the East, which enabled the translators to consult learned and accomplished masters of all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Not only the guidance of these la-mas, but the help of shepherds, painters, doctors, house-builders, and cooks was solicited to eluci-date the meaning of some obscure words and phrases. Wiser translators would doubtless have done better, but we did our best within our capacities. The main aim in translating this auto-biography was a wish to share with others its depth and beauty, as a remarkable source of inspiration for finding meaning in one's life. To conclude with Shabkar's own prayer: For all who read my life-story and songs May the doors to the three lower realms be shut. May all who hear iny life-story and songs Obtain in their next life a human or celestial birth. May all who remember or simply touch my life-story and songs Be reborn in the same realm where I will have been reborn. May all those who, when asked, recite my life-story and songs Be filled with blessings and achieve liberation. May the aspirations of those who act according to my life-story and songs Be accomplished in harmony with the Dharma. Wherever my life-story and songs are found, in monasteries and villages, May they fulfill all needs and aspirations like a Wish-fulfillingjewel. Wherever my life-story and songs are carried, May the Dharma, general auspiciousness, and excellent virtue blossom.

He was blessed shortly after his birth by the great Mipham Rinpoche (1846-1912), was recognized by Jarnyang Loter Wangpo (184 7-1914), and enthroned by Shechen Gyaltsap Perna Namgyal ( 1871-1926) as the mind-emanation ofJamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-92). Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche spent twenty-two years in contemplative retreat, and studied with more than fifty of the most eminent teachers of his time. His two principal spiritual masters were Shechen Gyaltsap Perna Narngyal and Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro (1893-1959, the activity-emanation of Khyentse Wangpo), both of whom considered him as their chief disciple. A treasure discoverer (gter ston), a great poet, a scholar with unfathomable knowl-edge, and a tireless and compassionate teacher with whom luminaries, including the fourteenth Dalai Lama, studied, he was widely renowned for his abil-ity to transmit the teachings of each Buddhist lineage according to its own tradition. 9.

On the biographical tradition concerning Atisha, see H. Eimer (1982). Tsongkhapa Lobzang Trakpa (tsong kha pa blo bzang grogs pa, 135 7-1419) was born in the Tsongkha region of Amdo province. Gifted with exceptional intellectual and spiritual abilities, he studied with more than a hundred teachers of various lineages. Having been blessed by visions ofManjushri, the Buddha of wisdom, he wrote numerous treatises, collected in eighteen volumes. The emphasis Tsongkhapa put on the graded approach to the spiritual path, on monas-tic discipline, and on extensive philosophical studies and epistemological debate as a prerequisite to con-templative practice, has defined the Gelukpa school. This lineage is also known as the New Kadampa tradition or as the tradition of Ganden, from the name of the monastery that Tsongkhapa founded near Lhasa, and where he passed away. He had many disciples, among whom were Gyaltsap Je (rgyal tshah rye, 1364-1432), Khedrupje Gelek Palzang (mklzas grub rje dge kgs dpal bz;ang, 1385-I 438), who succeeded him on the throne ofGanden, and Gedun Drub (dge 'dun grub, 1391-1474), who is counted as the ftrst Dalai Lama. Regarding the senselessness of sectarian-ism, see H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche in NS, pp. 887-940. 13. See G.

These mas-ters and others inspired a remarkable movement known as Rimey (ris med), \"nonsectarian,\" which encouraged followers of the different traditions not to remain confmed in the particular philosophical view-points espoused by their own schools, but to study and practice all the traditions ofTibetan Buddhism with respect and pure perception in order to gain a profound conviction of the unity of the teachings. 14.

As recorded in the Sutra of Great Nirvana and in other prophecies, Buddha Shakyamuni said, shortly before passing into nir-vana, that since he had been born as a human being in this life, he had not taught extensively the esoteric teachings of the tantras. He predicted that he would return to this world after twelve years by means of a miraculous· birth in order to expound the tantric teachings. This rebirth was Guru Padmasambhava, who emanated from the heart of Buddha Amitabha and miraculously appeared in the form of an eight-year-old child upon a lotus at Dana.kosha Lake in Oddiyana.

Moreover, the colophon of DOL 1 states that this volume of songs was produced by Orgyen Tendzin, Jimba Norbu's student. Jimba Norbu met Shabkar at Kailash and was also with him at Lapchi and Lhasa, but did not follow him to Amdo (see chap. 15, fol. 424b). Songs and teachings from chapter 11 are found in DOL 1 and 2.

One of the verses says, On the great spreading plain The yogin who understands emptiness Sits like a fearless king. Thus we name him King of the Empty Plain. 33. Enlightened beings may continue compassion-ate activities for sentient beings through various ema-nations, such as those of their body, speech, mind, enlightened qualities, and activity.

An incarnation of Langchen Palgyi Senge (rla:ngs chen dpal gyi seng ge), he was born in Gyantse in the Tsang province of central Tibet (gtsang rgyang rtse). He was a descendant ofRa Lotsawa Dorje Drak (rwa lo tsa ba rdo rje ~ags), eleventh century. Topden Dorje's main teacher was Choling Dewai Dorje (chos gling bde ba'i rdo rje); eventually he became the spiritual heir of this master's termas. When the Dzungar Mongols invaded Tibet, Topden Dorje followed his teacher to the sacred hidden land of the White Lotus (sbas yul pad:ma dkar po). After Dewai Dorje passed away, Topden Dorje came back to Tsang; later he went to India and Sikkim as a wandering yogin. At Onphu Taktsang ('on phu stag tshang), near Samye in central Tibet, he revealed a large terma cycle ofVajra Kilaya. In the later part of his life he was honored by the regent Pholha Sonam Topgyal (pho lha bsod nams slobs rgyas, 1689-1747). 42. A look at the lineage and the successive rein-carnations of Tennyi Lingpa is helpful for under-standing the connections between the various masters from which Shabkar's lineage originated. (See tables 1 and 4). One will notice the connections between the lineages ofDechen Gyalpo's termas and ofjigme Lingpa's .Wngchen Nyingthig. According to ND, p. 239 and BD, pp. 447-55, Tennyi Lingpa Perna Tsewang Gyalpo (bstan gnyis gling pa padma tshe dbang rgyal po, 1480-1535), born at Rongden (rong ldan) in Tsang, was the reincarnation of Lacham Nuchin Sale (lha learn nus 'byin sa le). He revealed many termas, including the Kunzang Nyingthig (lam. bzang mying thitJ, which is often quoted in Shabkar's writings. According toNG, Tennyi Lingpa is counted as one of the eight main lingpas. Among all ofTennyi Lingpa's revelations, the Shitro r eshe 77wngdrol (zhi klzro ye shes mthong gro4 is still widely practiced today in northern Nepal along with the Northern Termas (byang gter) of Rigdzin Godem. Shabkar received the empowerment for the Kunzang Nyingthigfromjamyang Gyatso. Ngakyi Wangpo often quotes this cycle in his Torch of Wisdom (see Appendix 4). A later rebirth of Tennyi Lingpa was Namchak Tsasum Lingpa (gnam lcagsrtsagsumglingpa), Raton Terton's teacher and the father of Rigdzin Thukchog Dorje. According to a prayer to his own former incarnations ( o rgyan gter bdag gling pa'i 'klzrung rab bsdus pa bcu gsum rna mang gsal me long, in Rediscovered Treasures ofNamchag Tsa Sum Lingpa, vol. 10, p. 28) by Tsasum Lingpa, Tennyi Lingpa would be the reincarnation of Drime Kunga. How-ever, according to GC, vol. 2, p. 741. Drime Kunga was the teacher ofKarpo Kunga Trakpa (dknr po kun dga'i grags pa), who himself was a teacher of Chogden Gonpo (b. 1497) and a contemporary ofPema Lingpa (1450-1521 ). This indicates that Drime Kunga ante-dated Tennyi Lingpa and was probably born in 1404 (see table 4). Rigdzin Thukchog Dorje (rig 'dzin thugs mchogrdo rje; see GC, vol 3, p. 212), also known as the great treasure rediscoverer Hum Nag Drodul (gter chen hum nag ~ 'duO.

He had four main disciples: Jigme Lingpa (Jigs med gling pa, 1729-98, see below), Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo (kun bzang bde chen rgyal po, b. 1 717), Thekling Karma Drodon Tarchin (theg gling karrruz ~o don mthar phyin), and the powerful yogin Trati Ngakchang (mthu chen kra ti sngags 'chang), also known as the Mad Yogin ofKongpo (kong smyon). 43.

He was, as well, the immediate reembodiment of ChOje Lingpa (chos rje gling pa), also known as Orgyen Rogje Lingpa (o rgyan rog rje gling pa, 1682-1725). In his childhood he had many visions of past saints. At the age of six, he entered the monastery of Palgi Riwo (dpal gi ri bo), the \"Glorious Mountain,\" where he received the name ofPema Khyentse Oser, \"Lotus Glowing with Wisdom and Love.\" At the age of thirteen, he met his root teacher, Rigdzin Thukchog Dmje (rig 'dzin thugs mchog rdo rje), who gave him the main Nyingma teachings. Through his inner realization, Jigme Lingpa effortlessly mastered the whole corpus of the Buddha's doctrine. At twenty-eight he did a three-year retreat, during which, in a vision, he was blessed by Guru Padmasambhava, who named him Perna Wangchen (padma dbang chen), \"Lotus of Great Power.\" Other profound visions revealed to him the mind treasure (dgongs gtdj of the Longchen Nyingthig (klong chen snying thig), one of the most widely practiced cycles of the Nyingma tradition. During another three-year retreat at Samye Chimphu (bsam yas mchims phu), he had three visions of Gyalwa Longchen Rabjam. Follow-ing a prediction from Tsele Natsok Rangdrol (rtse le sna tshogs rang grol, 1608-?), Jigme Lingpa went to Tsering Jong (tshe ring ijoniJ, where he founded the hermitage of Perna Osel Thekchog Choling (padma 'od gsal theg mchog chos gling).

They are, however, well aware of the evil in-volved in harming and butchering animals. It is therefore common practice among Tibetans to ran-som the lives (srog bslu) of animals. Buddhists from all over the world traditionally buy fish, birds, and other animals from the marketplace and set them free. In Tibet, it is often the owners themselves who merci-fully spare a certain fraction of their livestock. In the case of sheep and yaks, they will cut the tip of one of the animal's ears and tie to the remaining part of the ear a red ribbon as a sign that the animal should never be slaughtered; the animal is then set free among the rest of the herd. The owner usually strings together all the ear-tips thus obtained and offers them to a lama, requesting him to dedicate the merit accrued through this compassionate act. Lamas and devotees also often give large sums of money to herders, asking them to spare in the same way the lives of a given number of their animals."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A Celebration ofShabkar \"The Melody of Pure Devotion\" A song spontaneously arisen when remembering the lord of yogins, Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol Authentic emanation of Lord Mila, eagle on the great pillar, you are the one who was1 Best of the accomplished renunciates from the Land of Snows.

Grant your blessings that my life-story and songs May benefit the minds of whoever hears them. For the benefit of those who will come in the future, I shall now tell my whole tale, From my birth until this very day. Listen with joy! In the highlands is the sacred mountain, Machen Pomra, 14 Lord of the Tenth Bhumi, 15 graced with auspiciousness and prosperity. In the mid-lands is Trakar Drel Dzong, White Rock Mon-key Fortress, the place sacred to the Lord of Great Compassion, 16 the source ofblessings and siddhis. In the lowlands is the sacred place called Tsonying Mahadeva, The Heart of the Lake, which induces well-being, happiness, and fame. I once spent time engaged in profound medita-tion in the secluded, pleasant groves ofTsonying Island, in the middle ofLake Kokonor, the lake of abundance where the essence of the whole Mongolian land is gathered-a lake where waves ripple gently and the calls of water birds con-stantly resound. While I was staying there, Lama Perna Rangdrol (\"Self-liberated Lotus,\" my fortunate and supreme heart-son, who is diligent, intelli-gent, and compassionate) [5b], Kunzang Rangdrol (\"All Perfect Natural Liberation\") Alak Dechen 17 (\"Great Bliss''), and Shanye Genpo lama came to stay for a year. One day they came to me, prostrated themselves many times, and, offering a silk scarf of irnrnacu1ate whiteness, made this request \"Great vajra-holder, lasting refuge and pro-tector of all beings in this and future lives, kindly heed our request: to nourish our devotion and that of future disciples, as well as to benefit all beings, please tell us in detail the story of your life-from the time you lived at home until now.\" They accompanied their request with this seven-branch supplication: Jetsun, lord guru, emanation of the Victorious Ones, We bow down with great devotion at your lotus feet, Singing songs of praise and supplication. We offer you this excellent wealth: Our body, our speech, and the fulfillment of your every command. We confess whatever breaches and errors we have committed, And henceforth will refrain from commit-tingthem. Protector, we rejoice with great delight In the life-example you gave with your three mysteries. 18 For our benefit and that of future dis-ciples, . Set in motion the Dharma-wheel that is the story of your life. Protector, for the sake of the Dharma and all beings, Please remain in your bodily form for a hundred aeons. We dedicate the merit gathered by ourselves and others So that we may be able to follow perfectly your life's example [6a]. Refuge and protector of beings in this dark age, Out of great kindness, Tell us the story of your life From the time you were living at home Until the present day."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"I replied: Fortunate heart-son endowed with faith, Zeal, intelligence, and compassion, Lama Perna Rangdrol, and you fortunate ones, Listen! You must open and behold the treasury Of the life-stories of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. What is the point of rummaging through the rat's nest Of the life of a practitioner like me? If I were to tell you how that ass, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Painfully trailed behind the hoof prints Left by those sublime steeds, The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the past, On the vast plain of their perfect lives, It would only cause laughter. There is little need for my life-story, So you had better keep to the examples of our forefathers, And allow this yogin to rest peacefully In his quiet mountain retreat. Yet, they insisted: E rna! Protector of beings living in this dark age, Tell us how first you abandoned the concerns of this life, How next you followed a qualified master, How fmally you practiced in secluded places, And how meditation experiences and real-ization have now dawned in your mind. Protector, your life-story is wonderful indeed! When the light rays of the sun shine, The whole world benefits. Likewise, if you tell your life-story, It will benefit the whole Dharma and all beings. Introduction 5 Thus, don't think it unimportant, And, from great kindness, tell us the story of your life [6b]. In response to their insistence, I wrote down notes on my life, from the time I lived at home until my stay at Tsonying Island. When I told them my story, they were pleased, did many prostrations, and went away with the notes. Later, Lama Perna Rangdrol composed a biography covering the events of my life up to my pilgrim-age to the Pure Realm ofU and Tsang. 19 Since it was well-written and was of a suitable length, I thought it would suffice to inspire devotion in present and future disciples. Later I came to live in Lapchi Snow Range, one of the most sacred places of the body, speech, and mind of Chakrasamvara. 20 The place sa-cred to Chakrasamvara's body is the abode of the White Lion-faced Dakini at Mount Kailash in Upper Tibet, the famed king of glaciers. The place sacred to his speech is the abode of the Striped Tiger-faced Dakini at Lapchi in Middle Tibet. The place sacred to his mind is the abode of the Black Sow-faced Dakini, matchless Tsari, in Lower Tibet. Among these, the highlands of Lapchi, perpetually wreathed in cloud banks and mist, are the perfect dancing ground of celestial mamos and dakinis, 21 the place where Jetsun Milarepa once stayed. One day, as I was turning the Wheel of Dharma there for many faithful disciples, Kalden Rangdrol (\"Self-liberated Fortunate One\"), my close spiritual son who had great faith, gener-osity and intelligence, accompanied by Lama Jimba Norbu ('jewel of Generosity\"), Tendzin Nyima (\"Sun of the Doctrine\"), Yeshe Wangchuk (\"Endowed with Wisdom\"), Tsultrim Namgyal (\"All-Victorious Disci-pline\"), Lobzang Dargye (\"Vast and Excellent Intelligence\"), Nyene Khepa (\"The Learned Attendant\"), and many other close disciples offered me a mandala of gold and silver on a silken scarf, and said [7a]: \"Lord who embodies the Three Jewels, our precious and lasting refuge in this life and in all our lives, heed our supplication. If you tell the story of your life as did the learned and accom-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"6 The Life of Shabkar plished sages of the past, it will set a supreme example for the Dharma and all beings. \"Therefore, tell us first, lord, where you were born; your father and mother's names; whether they were rich or poor; how many broth-ers and sisters you had-in short, beginning with your birth, tell us your wondrous life year after year. \"Tell us how, having come to feel revulsion for samsaric affairs, you gave up this life's con-cerns, followed many learned and accomplished masters, studied and contemplated the sutra and tantra teachings, and, in accordance with the meaning expressed in them, stayed in secluded mountain retreats, persevering in profound medi-tation. \"Tell us how meditation experiences and realization took birth in your being; how you manifested miracles and the higher perceptions and brought immense benefit for the Dharma and all beings in Upper, Lower and Middle Tibet. Without holding anything back, tell us the outer, inner, and secret stories of your life.\" Kalden Rangdrol repeated this request in verse: Wish-fulfilling gem, refuge and protector, I have but one request: In the way of our spiritual forefathers, Please tell us the story of your life. This will gready benefit the Dharma, Your present disciples, and all beings in the future. Precious refuge and protector, First, tell us where you were born, the names of your parents, and then What you have done, year after year, since your birth. Tell us the wondrous deeds you have accomplished [7b]; How, having given up the affairs of this life for the sake of Dharma, You followed learned and accomplished masters; How you practiced in secluded places And gave rise to meditation experiences and realization; How you vasdy benefited sentient beings and the Dharma, Displaying prescience and miraculous deeds. Please tell us all, not withholding anything~ And grant your blessing that we, your fortunate disciples, May be able to follow thoroughly The example of the outer, inner, and secret aspects of your life. I answered: \"Since you ask with such insistence, I have no reason to keep my life-story secret. So, I shall tell you all I did from my birth until now--where I have been, where I stayed, and all I have done in accordance with the Dharma. Listen joyfully!\" I then told them all that I could remember. Delighted, they did many prostrations and cir-cumambulations, and then returned to their her-mitages. Although no notes were taken at the time, later, a few of the close disciples, who feared they might forget the details, wrote some down. Following this, I went on to Dorney, where I could be ofhelp to beings. Nine years later, I happened to stay in retreat at Tashikhyil,22 a perfect secluded place covered with forests and flowers, and filled with the melo-dious calls of birds of all kinds. At that time, the faithful disciples and ngakpas 23 said among them-selves, ''If our precious refuge and protector would tell his life-story in detail [8a], it would strengthen our faith and be of invaluable benefit for future disciples.\" Soon after, Khen Rinpoche dreamed that I was seated outside on a throne at the east side of the Dewachen Temple on the top ofTashikhyil Mountain, telling a great crowd ofhuman beings and celestial beings the life-stories of many Bud-dhas, Bodhisattvas, and learned and realized beings of India and Tibet. In his dream he thought, ''Who knows when I'll die? I must ask"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Lama Shabkar to tell his life-story.\" At that moment, he woke up. The next day, he came, presented me with a white scarf, and made this request: Precious protector, our refuge in this life and lives thereafter, You have now grown old. Almost all the great disciples who earlier asked That you tell your life-story Have now passed away. I, too, am an old man close to death; Who knows when I shall die? I may never have another opportunity To ask you to tell the story of your life. Ifl don't ask this while I live, Once I'm dead, even if you tell it, I won't be there to hear it. So, now while I am still of this world, Please tell the whole story of your life. It will enhance faith, respect, and pure perception In all of us, your disciples; And set a perfect example For the Dharma and beings in the future [8b]. From today, and throughout all of my lives, May I follow your life-example And practice the divine Dharma. May my aspiration be fulfilled! Thereafter, some of my disciples, who always did as their master asked, such as Nyangkyi Tsampa (\"The Hermit ofNyang\"),24 Thakhang Umdze (\"The Chant Master\"), Yeshe Tendzin (\"Holder of the Wisdom Teachings\"), Scmam Rinchen (':Jewel of Merit\"), my attendant Drupchen (\"Great Siddha\"), Perna Kardri (\"Fragrance of the White Lotus\"), Neten (\"the Elder'\\ Sangye (\"The Buddha\"), Kunga (\"All Joy\"), Rabjung (\"The Renunciate\"), Phuntshok (\"All-Perfect\"), and many devoted patrons, pleaded that, just as there were many biogra-phies of the past and present masters, I should certainly tell my life-story, too. Introduction 7 Although they kept insisting, I thought that there was little need for it. I did not pay much attention to this, and stayed in strict retreat. One day during my retreat, it occurred to me, '~e keeping in mind the practice of Dharma, I have now reached old age, and death is approaching. I do not know how much time I have left for joys and sorrows. At present, my illusory body is fit and free of illness. If, as the Khenpo said, I were to write the story of my life and leave it behind, in the future it might some-how benefit faithful and fortunate disciples who strive for liberation.\" Thus I began to feel inclined to write down the events of my life from my birth until the present. Like a wish-fulfilling gem, the spiritual master is the source of all well-being, bliss, and excellence [9a]. For those who are now asking that their master's life-story be told and for the fortunate disciples of the future, it is first of all essential to develop faith and respect toward the spiritual master, perceiving the master as the Buddha in human form. Why is this so? In the perception of extraordinary disciples, Buddha Shakyamuni, the matchless son ofSuddhodana, the sublime guide of all beings, men, and gods, realized the unsur-passable state of enlightenment at the very beginning of samsara and nirvana. He then mani-fested in various forms to tame sentient beings, limitless as space, in accordance with their needs, and ceaselessly turned the Wheel of Dharma. As is said in The Sutra of Compassion's JtVhite lntus:25 1broughout inconceivable billions of aeons, Infinite, innumerable--! have attained sublime enlightenment, And have continuously expounded the Dharma. In the perception of ordinary disciples, Buddha Shakyamuni first awakened his aspira-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"8 Tk Lift of Shabkar tion, then gathered the two accumulations, and fmally attained perfect and true enlightenment. Having displayed these wondrous deeds, he set in motion the Wheel of Dharma. These are the deeds that he will display again and again in the future, as it is stated in the sutra called TkMeeting of Father and Son: 26 Great hero of great skill, You manifested in billions of universes As the Victorious One, the Buddha, To bring sentient beings to full maturity, You, the guide [9b], Will manifest again as numerous Buddhas. In this degenerate age, the Buddha mani-fests as various spiritual masters and spiritual friends who train beings-whoever is in need of taming, by whatever means are needed. In 1he Great Drum Sutra 27 the Buddha says: Do not despair, Ananda! In the future I will Emanate as spiritual friends To benefit you and others. In the SaJq River Sutra 28 he also says: During the last five-hundred year period I will emanate as spiritual friends. Regard them as you would myself And respect them. In the Vqjra Tent T antra 29 it is said, too: Assuming an ordinary appearance, The one known as Vajrasattva Emanates as spiritual masters To benefit all sentient beings. Considering the Buddha's words as the canon of truth, perceive the master as the Buddha in person; regard all he does as perfect, and feel devotion just by remembering the way he sits, acts, and talks, and even more by remembering the vast and wondrous deeds ofhis life. Whoever has complete faith and devotion will soon give rise to all the good qualities of the sacred Dharma, accomplish all activities and attain all the siddhi.s of the Buddhas. As it is said in 1he Sutra of the Ten Dharmas: 30 Those possessed of faith Will perform the deeds of the Buddhas. Likewise, in 1he Magical Net 31 it says: The one possessing faith [I Oa] Will naturally achieve all accomplishments. And Gyalwa Karmapa said: The faithful disciple gifted with devotion Will soon give rise to the qualities of Dharma. Machik,32 the \"Sole Mother,\" said too: All those who have faith Will see their aspirations fulfilled. You may wonder whether there had been predictions about me. There had. In the Descrip-tion of the Great Stupa]amng Khaslwr, or Bodhnath, 33 one fmds among the great master Padmasam-bhava's predictions: \"Several emanations of the Lords of the Three Families, of the Frowning One, and of Arya Tara will restore the stupa.34 At that time, someone with fortunate karma-the result of his past deeds-will come; if, having forsaken all concern for this life, he conceives the supreme intention to restore the stupa and undertakes the work, he will succeed. If he does so, this world, the southern continent ofjambudvipa, will enjoy good years and happiness for twenty-five human years; the three lands of India, Nepal, and Man will enjoy the same for thirty-five years; the Land of Snows, Tibet, will ward off the invaders from Upper Mongolia35 for sixty years, and there will be good years and happiness for forty years. \"36 It is also said in the General Predictions for the Dharma made by Terton Dudul Dorje,37 \"Ada-mantine Subduer of Evil\":"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Glorious Vajra will fly to the east. One with the name Rangdrol, wise in the true meaning, Will give splendor toJarung Khashor. All fortunate and noble beings will have faith in him [1 Ob]. In the Secret Predict:Wns of Karmapa Rolpai Dmje,38 \"Adamantine Display,\" one finds: Jetsun Shepai Dmje, \"la.ughing Vajra,\"39 Will reappear in Dokham, in the east. He will make excellent restorations At the Snow Range of la.pchi. Taksham Nuden Dmje,40 \"Powerful Dia-mond,\" made predictions concerning the hold-ers of his teachings: When the Central Temple,41 built in three styles, is damaged by fire, A \"wheel gathering the profound mean-ing'' will appear from the east. If he meets with this deep teaching of rome, Obstacles will be dispelled and immense benefit will ensue for beings. You, great compassionate one with a mole above your eye, Do not harbor doubts; practice and propa-gate these teachings. Likewise in the predictions of Dzogchenpa Kunzang Shenphen, \"Ever-excellent Benevolent One,\" 42 a lord among siddlzas, one can read: The Lord, the \"Wheel of the Doctrine,\" will appear in Upper Tibet, As the magical display of the divine Lotus-holder.43 He will manifest there and in other places. According to the prophecies received by the great awareness-holder Pal denT ashi, 44 it is said: On the mountain that resembles a standing elephant Introduction 9 Is a forest shrouded in dark clouds. This place, known as T ashikhyil, Will become a place of practice. There, like the sun and moon Encircled by a host of stars, Will appear several realized beings And secret practitioners of great bliss. Others say that if someone endowed with faith and respect were to look through the scrip-tures of the sutras and tantras, the volumes of the Kadampas, and the ancient and recent revealed treasures of Orgyen Rinpoche, there are many instances where one would wonder, \"Isn't this a prediction, too?\" [Ila]. For these reasons, if in the future someone tells or listens to the story of my life with a pure mind filled with faith and respect, and thinks, \"This is a holy person predicted by our holy forefathers,\" great benefit could result. As it is said in the Golden Garland of the Kagyu Lineage: 45 Merely hearing of the life-stories, the won-drous deeds and virtues of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and of their emanations, the mas-ters of the precious Whispered Lineage and all the other holy and supreme emanated beings, purifies limitless negative karma, evil deeds, and obscurations, while perfecting an equally limit-less accumulation of merit. Once the seeds of virtue have been sown in your being, you will always be reborn in the presence of spiritual masters and take delight in the teachings of the Mahayana; you will be able to bear austerities and hardships, while mental strength and understanding will naturally develop. These life-stories teach the Dharma. So if you hear them many times and keep them in mind, they will help you to understand what to do and what not to do. You will know which path to follow, without any mistake. Faith will be born in those with no faith and be enhanced in those who have faith; diligence, intelligence, revulsion toward samsara, and other excellent qualities will grow effortlessly."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"10 The life of Shabkar Your fervent devotion will enable you to receive the blessings of the true lineage; medita-tion experiences and realization not yet born will arise, and those already born will increase (lib]. When you think, 'May I perform the same wondrous deeds as these Bodhisattvas!' Bodhi-citta will arise. When you rejoice in their great virtuous acts, you will gain the same merit as if you had performed them yoursel£ When you hear the profound accounts of the Bodhisattvas' wondrous deeds, your attachment and aggression and other negative thoughts, together with suffering of all kinds, will stop, while your joy and pure deeds will blossom. Even if you are criticized and slandered by people with wrong views, you will be welcomed by great beings, and, having been accepted as their disciple, you will put an end to samsara. In short, these life-stories are a source of benefit for both yourself and others. To read, hear, or reflect on them is very meaningful; you should read, copy, listen to, memorize and reflect upon them with diligence. Keep them in mind and put them into practice with ardent devotion and respect. Unlike the life-stories of the past Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and great learned and realized sages of India and Tibet, my own life-story does not have much to offer to my disciples for their practice. Nevertheless, keeping my eyes fixed on the examplary lives of the past masters, I shall relate all that I have done in accordance with the Dharma [12a]. How will this story be told? To make it pleasant to those -of superior, middling, and lesser capacities, I shall (as a few learned and accomplished persons have done in the past) alternate prose and verse. Tills account will be related in fifteen chapters: The first chapter tells how and where I took birth, as a result of good karma and of pure prayers made in my past lives. The second tells how, having reflected on the vanity of worldly affairs, I left home for the homeless life. The third tells how, leaving my homeland behind, I came into the presence of the Dharma King, Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo. The fourth tells how, in keeping with the prophecy of my master, I persevered in pro-found meditation practices in the pleasant soli-tude ofTseshung Grove. The fifth tells how I went to practice in other nearby places such as Takmo Dzong, Gopo Dzong, and Getho. The sixth tells how I went to practice at Tsonying Mahadeva, The Heart of the Lake, the renowned sacred place that induces well-being and happiness. The seventh tells how I went to practice at Machen Pomra, the mountain of the Lord of the Tenth Bhumi, auspicious and magnificent. The eighth tells how I went to practice at Trakar Drel Dzong, the White Rock Monkey Fortress, the source of all blessings and accom-plishments. The ninth tells how, following the death of my mother, I went to the Pure Realm of central Tibet, U and Tsang. The tenth tells how I made the pilgrimage through the Ravines ofTsari, and how I prac-ticed at the place sacred to the Mind of Black V arahi, unequaled in Lower Tibet. The eleventh tells how I went to western Tibet and practiced at Mount Kailash, the famed king of mountains, the place sacred to the Body of the White Lion-faced Dakini. [12b] . The twelfth tells how I went to the celestial realm of Nepal, and paid homage at the two great stupas. The thirteenth tells how I went to the authentic place ofLapchi, the place sacred to the speech aspect of the Striped Tiger-faced Dakini, and meditated there. The fourteenth tells how, coming back to the Pure Realm ofU and Tsang, I wandered on, benefiting beings. The fifteenth tells how, returning to lower Do-kham, I worked to benefit the Dharma and all beings."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Notes 1.

In the primordial uni-versal ground, there are neither sentient beings, nor Buddhas; neither ignorance, nor enlightenment. It is a state of natural, unchanging perfection beyond conditions and concepts. When the frrst manifesta-tion of phenomena arises from the primordial ground, to recognize that this arising is the display of one's own awareness leads instantaneously to the primor-dial Buddhahood ofSamantabhadra.

The relative mind of enlightenment is itself divided into two steps: the wish to attain ultimate perfection to become able to free all beings from suffering, and the entry into spiritual practice to actualize this wish. The absolute mind of enlightenment is the realization of emptiness, the recognition that the Buddha-nature abides in every sentient being. 7. These two accumulations of merit and wis-dom (bsod nams and ye shes lgi tshogs) lead respectively to the realization of the two kayas, the dharmakaya (chos sku, absolute body) and the rupakaya (gzugs sku, manifested body) of a Buddha. 8.

To the west lie the Pure Realms of U and Tsang where the Buddhas Amitabha and Padmapani emana-ted as the saffron-clad Victorious Ones-Father and Son.3 To the north, in Dorney, stands the mountain Tsongkha Kyeri, the birthplace of the Second Buddha, the great Tsongkhapa, who reigns supreme over the three worlds. There are many villages of the Golden Valley of Rekong, and the inhabitants are intelligent, courageous, and skilled in the sciences of reli-gious art, medicine, and astrology. All take delight in practicing the Dharma [13a]. Nearby are Rekong's Eight Places of the Accomplished Ones4 and many hallowed spots where Lord Kalden Gyatso once practiced. The most eminent of these sacred places is Shohong l.a.kha, the actual palace ofChakrasamvara, locat-ed near the temple of Chuchik Shel. 5 Both farm-ers and nomads live in this land of cliffs, forests, and flower-filled meadows. Here, by following the practice ofChakrasamvara and Vajrayogini, the great tantric practitioner known as Kawa Doxje Chang Wang, who had come from East-em Kathok, attained the vajra rainbow body in a single lifetime. 6 In this region, ten villages of various sizes lie scattered in all directions. Among these is Nyen-15 gya, a village at the foot of the local godjadron's mountain abode. This is my homeland, the place of my birth. My ancestral line is Cho. Its history and genealogy follow. Close to the banks of the Machu River is the mountain range abode of Machen Pomra, 7 the Lord of the Tenth Bhumi, who first conceived the thought of enlightenment in the presence of the omniscient guide, Buddha Shakyamuni. Machen Pomra is the patron deity of the whole region; among the spirits of his retinue is the powerful Trika, a spirit as real as any person. In this area which carries the name ofTrika, there were many large tribes, which abided by the laws of the kingdom and were favorably inclined toward the Dharma. One clan called Megya began a feud with the rich and powerful Namkhai Gyalpo and his household, and forced them to leave the province. They settled at Nyengya and, because they worshiped the local deities, their property and wealth flourished still further [13b]. Namkhai Gyalpo, \"King of the Sky,\" had three sons whom he named \"Lion\": Nyima Senge (\"Sun Lion\"), Dawa Senge (''Moon Lion\"), and Changchup Senge (\"Lion of En-lightenment\"). Each of these sons had many male descendants, multiplying the family tree so that eventually there were established three pa-ternal bloodlines called Ngakor, Damtsang, and Gongpa I am from the family branch called Damtsang, descended from Changchup Senge. My ancestor, Changchup Senge, had a son, a grandson, and a great-grandson. In the fourth"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"16 1he Life of Shabkar generation, a handsome boy was born. Gifted with a pleasant voice and a good heart, he was named Apo Yag, \"Good Fellow.\" As a young boy, while herding cattle at a place known as Gyang Y aktser, he found a large vase filled with gold and other precious things. Even after three generations had passed, his descendants were still showing the vase to their sons, saying, \"Should our descendants ever be faced with hard times, all they need do is help themselves to some of this gold.\" This ancestor of mine fathered a son named Tashi Gyal, \"Victorious Goodness,\" who was expert in both religious and secular affairs. T ashi Gyal had a son called Tsewang, \"Lord ofLife,\" a man of great merit who lived to a ripe old age. Tsewang's son, Ngawang, \"Lord of Speech,\" was an honest and guileless man skilled in song and storytelling. This Ngawangwas my mother's father. He had five daughters followed by one son whom he named Kyabgo, who was inclined toward the Dharma. My mother was third of the five daughters [14a]. Before my mother was born, my grand-parents had sponsored a reading of the T ashi Tsekpa,8 a sutra of the Victorious One, in hopes that a boy might be born. Not a boy, but a girl was born, my mother. They named her Tashi Tsek, \"Heap of Goodness,\" and later she was affectionately nicknamed Tsekgo. Taking birth neither in a rich family Nor in a poor one But in a family of moderate wealth, May I thus be able to renounce my home.9 In accordance with this prayer made by Shariputra, 10 my mother's family was neither rich nor poor, but of average means. My grand-parents had only one son, their youngest child. Among their many daughters, my mother proved to be the most capable, and so enjoyed greater consideration than did the others. She was intel-ligent, and became adept at managing the house-hold and taking care of the family and servants. Her parents decided to keep my mother at home to care for their only son while her sisters were given away in marriage [14b]. As my mother grew older, she met many lamas and spiritual masters of the area and lis-tened to teachings on the karmic law of cause and effect and other subjects. Inspired by their instructions, she took delight in the Dharma and refrained from misdeeds. On each full moon, new moon, and on the eighth day of each month, she observed the eightfold precepts of lay ordi-nation. 11 Reciting praises to Tara daily, she did prostrations. Eventually she completed a hun-dred thousand such praises as well as a million prostrations. In short, my mother was both skilled in the activities of daily life and eager to practice virtue. My father's identity was never openly revealed, but almost everyone agreed that it was Tsodu Khen Rinpoche, 12 also known as Ngakchang Dorje Namgyal, the \"All-Victorious Adamantine Yogin,\" an emanation of the Bodhisattva Khyeu Chubeb, \"The Youth who Brings Water.\"13 Born in a noble family, he had attained perfection in the five sciences. 14 A great lord among siddhas, he could make rain fall when needed. Before my conception, my mother dreamed that the village chief, Uncle Ngaktruk, 15 brought her a statue. Handing it to her, he said, \"Keep this image in your home for a while. But you won't keep it forever, for someday it is destined to be placed upon everyone's head.\" She also dreamed of finding a white lotus flower with which she adorned her hair, and a white conch that she blew. Later, she dreamed that a resplen-dent image of Avalokiteshvara, about an inch in size, entered the crown ofher head and dissolved into her. It was then that I entered my mother's womb, filling her mind and body with boundless bliss. Causing my mother little pain, I was born in the year called Pharwa, the Female Iron Ox.16 Just after birth, I opened my eyes and thereafter grew faster than most other infants. Without crying, I would lie on my bed with a joyful expression that endeared me to everyone [15a]. At this time, a relative named Kyablo calcu-lated my astrological chart. He said, \"The place-ment of the stars at his birth is good. Because this boy was born on the day known as the 'One"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Man Who Makes a Hundred Take Flight,' ifhe leads a worldly life, he will become a hero who can defeat a hundred men. However, should he practice the Dharma, he will become a si.ddha who can defeat the eighty-four thousand obscur-ing emotions.\"17 On hearing this, our village chief, N gaktruk, made offerings to the divinities associated with my birth and freed animals that were about to be slaughtered. I was given the name Ngawang Tashi, \"Auspicious Lord of · Speech.\" The year I was born, the entire country enjoyed good fortune and an abundant harvest. When a feast was held to celebrate my birth, the wise elders who had gathered for the occasion said, \"Calling the boy 'Auspicious Lord of Speech' was an excellent choice. He truly deserves his name.\" The local people rejoiced and gave me other names, \"Auspicious Long Life\" and \"Auspicious Prosperity.\" From early childhood, I never told lies or spoke harshly, and I avoided any kind of cruel games or mischief I preferred to recite prayers, sing the mantra Om mani padme luon, and beat· a drum or play other temple instruments. In this way, I found entertainment through activities inspired by the Dharma. Naturally honest and good-hearted, I was kind to my playmates. When I ate even a handful of tsampa, 18 I divided it up and shared it with others. At night, lying on my mother's lap and looking into the darkness, I sometimes saw many rainbow lights, circles, and the images of deities like the paintings in temples. I told my mother about this, saying, ''Mother, when I look into the air, I see many different-colored things\" [15b]. She answered, \"Don't tell fibs-how can anyone see such things in complete darkness? Just quiet down.\" A few days later, I saw the same things again and told her about them. She asked, \"You're not making it up, are you?\" I replied, \"Really, I'm not lying.\" Mother told Ngaktruk, the village chief, about this. \"It could be true,\" said he. \"You must keep this child clean and guard him from defilements. If he is the incarna-tion of a good practitioner and practices the Dharma, he will benefit both himself and others.\" Years later, when I was practicing Thoga119 in Early Years 1 7 mountain retreats and many similar things mani-fested, I wondered if what I had seen as a child was a reawakening of previous tendencies. Once, when I was six or seven years old, after the spring fields had been sown and the days were growing longer, our village chief sat down in a warm, sunny spot with a copy of the Sutra of the Wue and the Foolish. 20 A crowd gathered around him while he gave teachings on the karmic law of cause and effect. I had come to listen, too. He said: \"Listen! In future times, beyond this life-time, it will be difficult to find a precious human birth, free and well-favored. We must therefore try hard to practice Dharma, now that we have this precious body. The time of our death is uncertain. Who knows? We might even die tonight. \"Mter death, we will enter the presence of Yamaraj, Lord of Death, who will weigh our good and evil deeds. Those who have done wrong will be sent to suffer the pains of hell, while those who have acted with virtue will enjoy the happi-ness of the higher realms. Is it not therefore foolish to do wrong? [16a]. \"Of all misdeeds, taking the life of a sentient being is the most heinous, and cannot fail to lead you to the hell realm. Avoid this at all costs! \"Do what is good. Serve the Sangha respect-fully, make offerings, be generous. Prostrations, circumambulations, reciting mantras, and keep-ing a good heart lead to rebirth in the Blissful Realm. 21 Work hard at them! The reasons are explained in the Sutra of the Wzse and the Foolish, which I shall now read.\" While reading it, Ngaktruk would pause from time to time to explain the meaning. In this way, he benefited the minds of those who had gath-ered there. I, too, gained some understanding, and resolved that, from then on, I would refrain from any wrongdoing and practice only virtue. As I grew older, I never forgot this vow and even avoided crushing the tiniest of earthworms. I didn't allow others to kill the horseflies that had settled on meat and gave them my own blood to drink. Whenever my mother did prostrations, I prostrated myself, too. I offered incense and flow-ers at our altar, and recited whatever mantras"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"18 The Life of Shabkar and prayers I knew, like the mani and the Milc-tsema PrUJer. 22 One autumn, the harvest was excellent. Both rich and poor families said this was something to celebrate, and thus many scores of sheep were slaughtered. This grim spectacle horrified me and filled me with compassion. I couldn't bear to remain at the slaughtering-place and had to go and wait elsewhere. When the killing was over, I returned, and I saw the sprawled carcasses of the sheep being carved into pieces. I thought, \"These people are doing evil, even though they know they will experience the results in their next life. When I grow up, I will tum away from evil actions and only practice Dharma.\" I reaffinned this promise again and again [16b]. At this time, my old grandfather, Ngawang, was teaching the alphabet to my cousin Nam Lhajam. I used to sit behind them and, just by looking on, I learned the letters with little diffi-culty. When, after a long time, Nam Lhajam hadn't learned, Grandfather scolded him, say-ing, ''Though I am teaching you, you still haven't learned. Your little cousin has learned without being taught. What is to be done with you?\" To me he said, \"You are quite bright,\" and treated me very kindly. In the same way, I learned to read by looking on while other children were being taught. Thus, without formal training, I mastered both printed and cursive scripts. Then my old grandfather and a nun living with us died. Following this, my mother's young brother, Kyabgo, died suddenly at the age of twenty-one. The strain of these and other diffi-culties caused my mother to age prematurely. By the age of nine or ten, I had learned the liturgy used by the community of ngakpas living in Shohong Lhaka, 23 as well as printed and cursive script calligraphy. Thus, for a child my age, I had mastered reading and writing quite well. When I turned eleven, I joined that com-munity of ngakpas, a community known for their pure SamUJa 24 and unshakable faith in the Secret Mantra tradition of the Early Translation school. 25 I became good at chanting the rituals, thus pleasing most of the older ngakpas who com-mented, \"This young ngakpa really sings well!\" They called me Tashi Tsering, \"Auspicious Long Life\" [17a]. One day, a relative of ours, an old spinster by the name of A yi Lumo Pal, was sitting alone in a warm, sunny spot near her door. I went over to her and said, \"Don't feel sad. When I grow up, I will help you in any way I can.\" I went home, took some butter from our kitchen-with-out my mother knowing it-and gave it to the old woman. As I grew older, from ti.'Tie to time I helped Ayi Lumo Pal. This made her very happy; she would call me whenever she saw me and often share with me whatever nice food she had. Even now, I remember how she treated me with the affection she would have shown to her own child. One day, the root guru and crown jewel of the Sangha and of everyone in our district, Gedun Tashi Gyatso Chumar Rinpoche26 arrived. To many monks and lay people he gave the refuge vows and the oral transmission for the Confession of Misdeeds, the Hundred Deities of T ushita, 27 the Milctsema PrUJer, and the mani. He gave general teachings on the difficulty of obtaining a pre-cious, free, and well-favored human birth, on death and impennanence, on the karmic law of cause and effect, and on the defects of samsara in as much detail as necessary, benefiting everyone. At this time he advised: \"Parents, if you have several children, don't let them all become householders. How excel-lent if some of them became ordained and prac-ticed the Dharma! [17b]. Our teacher, the Buddha Shakyamuni, was saddened at the sight of the suffering of old age, sickness, and death, but was pleased at the sight of a monk. Forsaking his kingdom, he renounced the world in front of the Stupa of Great Purity.28 ''Then, after practicing austerities on the banks of the Nairanjara River, he attained com-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"plete enlightenment, seated under the Bodhi-tree at Vajrasana, the Diamond Throne of In-dia. In the light of his example, consider the good fortune of practicing Dharma in this way.\" Mter hearing this, I returned home. We had seven tlzangkos that illustrated the twelve great deeds of the Buddha's life. 29 Considering them deeply, I thought, \"This is what was meant.\" My heart was filled with the aspiration to become like the Buddha. 1bis precious master instituted chanting of the mani in our area. 30 T uming everyone's mind toward the Dharma, this venerable lama showed great kindness to the people there. From this time on, without fail, I observed the eightfold precepts on each eighth lunar day as well as on the days of the full and new moons. When I grew older, I painted frescoes de-picting stories from A Drop qf Nourishment for the People 31 on either side of the lama's door; they pleased him greatly. Even now, I can remember the spiritual conversations we had in those days. When he was about to die, he left his fmal testa-ment: Unfailing refuge for whoever relies on you, Source of all excellence in this and future lives, Treasury of all accomplishment, gracious lords, Teachers whom I have met and those of the lineage, Sustain me until enlightenment. You beings, who have continuously wandered in samsara Like a river flowing on and on, Consider the sufferings of old age, sickness, and death [18a]. Give up the ten evil actions and try to practice the ten virtuous deeds. 32 Always keep in mind that you are walking into the maw of the Lord ofDeath. Don't let your mind be too involved with outer phenomena; Turn it inward-better to ascertain The true nature of mind within. Early Years 19 Though you may be unable to experience the vajra-feast That is naked, brilliant emptiness, If you don't have some certainty about the real meaning, Guiding others is like the blind leading the blind. When the time comes to enter the mouth of the Lord of Death, If you lack the small but crucial shield of this oral instruction, Other instructions, like dull instruments, Won't be much help at that crucial juncture. Don't miss the main point! Visualize the Great Compassionate One above your head. With your voice, recite the six-syllable mantra.33 With your mind, generate compassion for all suffering beings, So that this and future lives may be filled with virtue and excellence. Devoted people of future generations, Keep this in mind. Had you met me in person, I would have nothing to say beyond this. May all faithful men and women Who have some connection with me Take rebirth in the paradise Arrayed in Turquoise Petals.34 May this region be endowed With auspiciousness and abundant harvests, And its people enjoy fulfillment and prosperity. There was great meaning in his words. Some time later, when I was about twelve or thirteen years old, I went to Orgy en T rinley Namgyal, \"All-Victorious Activity ofOrgyen,\" a lama living at lower T ashikhyil who was skilled in the practices of pacifying, enriching, magne-tizing, and subjugatin~5 according to the Nying-mapa school of the Secret Mantra. I received"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"20 Th Life of Shabkar teachings from him on the ritual liturgies of the Eight Commands, Union of the Sugatas, 36 the Most Secret and UnsurpassableDagger, 37 the Lord of the Dead Ji1..1w Destroys Arrogant Spirits,38 Hayagrina, and oth-ers [18b]. He also taught me how to make torma.f39 and draw chakras40 for protection and for avert-ing evil according to these traditions. Since I learned these without difficulty, he was pleased with me. When I asked him for some oral trans-missions for my daily practice, he said, \"If you want the Dharma, I will give it to you, but first you must be able to withstand some hardships.\" I replied, \"I can,\" and, from then on, I fetched water up to thirteen times each day to make mud for the walls of his retreat hut. I beat the mud, and he applied it to the hut. After many days of carrying water, my back ached. \"My back is sore now,\" I told him. But he replied: \"Haven't you heard how, in the past, the greatjetsun Milarepa carried enormous quantities of earth and stones-much more than you've done-and three ter-rible sores broke out on his back?\" \"That's true,\" I thought, and after I had brought water for fifteen more days, he was pleased and gave me all the transmissions I wanted. These included the daily practices of the JIWzite Path of liberation, the Guru Yoga of Orgyen Rmpoche, 41 the meditation and recitation practice of PeacdUJ Manjushri, the smoke-offering Spiral of Auspiciousness,42 and the general torma offering to the samaya-holding pro-tectors.43 ''Now, avoid a worldly life, lead a life of pure Dharma practice and you will succeed,\" he said. I asked, ''What is the best way to practice the Dharma?\" He replied, \"If you genuinely wish to practice, look at the life ofjetsun Milarepa. The best way of all would be to follow his example.\" When I was fourteen I met Jampel Dmje Rinpoche, \"Adamantine Gentle Glory,\" the great lord of siddhaswho had attained full realization in the development and completion stages, and in the Great Perfection of the Diamond Vehicle of the Secret Mantra [37]. When the ngakpas of Shohong received the empowerment of Vajrasattva and seven days of teachings on the oral instructions of the Dzogchen Ati .?:,abdon, the Profound Unsurpassable Meaning of the Great Peifec-tion,44 I, too, sat in the gathering and listened. When he explained the more general teach-ings, renunciation and weariness with samsara grew in everyone's minds. When he reached the main part of the teachings, he had us look for the nature of mind. He called each ngakpa up before him, and questioned him. At one point, I, too, was called on. He asked, \"What is mind like?\" I said, \"I could find nothing at all.H He replied, ''You're still very young. If you weren't able to find it, that's fine.\" Then, when all the ngakpas had gathered and he gave the \"pointing-out\" instruction, I recognized that the nature of mind is like the sky: empty, luminous, and beyond duality. The mas-ter and most of the elderly ngakpas said to each other, \"This is surely someone with good karmic potential from his former lives.\" After that, every year when the corn.\"llunity of ngakpas and the practioners who perform the offerings of the tenth day45 received teachings, I also went to listen. Thus I received the empower-ment of Vqjra Kilaya46 and the permission-bless-ing for the practice of Khecari, the S/g Dweller, 4 7 as well as the transmission for the Supplication to Guru Rinpoche in Seven Chapters, the Prayer for the Spontaneous Fulfillment of Aspirations, the Sadhana of the lineage of Awareness-Holders,48 the Praises to Tara the Sauioress, the Sutra of the Heart ofWzsdom,49 the dharanis of the JIWzite UmbreUa and of the lion-faced Dakini, 50 the Long-lift Dharani, and others. From then on, my character became more gentle. I had meditation experiences ofbliss, clarity, and nonthought, and was able to get on well with whomever! met [19b]. At the age of fifteen, I thought, \"I should pray to the precious Master [Padmasambhava], the source of blessings. I recited one million Vajra Guru mantras,51 based on the ritual of the line-age of Awareness-Holders. I dreamed of flying in the sky, seeing the sun and moon, walking uphill, finding jewel-treasures, and so forth. From then on, by the grace of Orgyen Rinpoche, I became filled with intense devotion toward the guru, affection toward my Dharma friends, compas-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"sion for sentient beings, and pure perception toward the teachings. I had the good fortune to accomplish without obstacles whatever Dharma practice I undertook. Mter that, at the age of sixteen, I thought I should do some practice on a meditation-deity of knowledge. So, I stayed in retreat for a year, reciting the mantra of the peaceful Manjushri according to the spiritual treasure of Minling Terchen. My mother helped me during there-treat. Having recited the Arapatsa mantra52 ten million times, I dreamed of finding books written in gold and silver; I dreamed of wheels, swords, the vajra and bell, and so forth. From then on, by the grace of the noble Manjushri, my intelli-gence increased, and I acquired a general under-standing of most of the vast and profound teachings. At seventeen, I learned religious painting from Tenpa Dargye, \"One who Spreads the Dharma,\" a religious artist from Ling Gya, and became able to make good drawings. I drew many of the chakras and ling~3 that are in gen-eral use among the holders of the mantra teach-ings for protection and for averting evils. I also made many icons and amulets that liberate the wearer, and gave them away to Dharma friends and faithful people. I copied many books for myself and others (20a], and I became so skilled at writing that, on a single spring day, I wrote a hundred folios. People were amazed. Around this time, I met Jamyang Gyatso Rinpoche, \"Ocean of Gentle Melody,\" a lord among accomplished beings, who was thoroughly versed in the teachings ofboth the Old and the New Traditions, Nyingma and Sarma. He had been invited to Tashikhyil by the venerable Gyal Khenchen, the \"Great Victorious Abbot.\" With the congregation of ngakpas I received the empow-erment ofT alctsang Phurba;54 I received the oral instructions on the Great Perfection teachings of the Heart Essence of Samantabhadra55 three times. Moreover, when many monks and ngakpas requested further teachings from him, I received . them as well. These included the empowerment of the Hundred Supreme PeacefUl and Wrathfol Fami-!ieJ56 and of the All-Embotfying One, 57 as well as the oral transmissions and instructions on the Offering to the Gurus, 58 the Candensed Meaning of the Graded Early Years 21 Path, 59 the Seven Pointr of Mind Training, 60 the Supreme Medicinal Nectar of the Garland of Qyestions and Answers, 61 the liberation Through Hearing, the pointing-out instruction Awareness Seen in itr Naked-ness,62 Cutting off Errors and Deuio.tions;63 the Oral Teaching of the Omniscient One called the Drop of Amrita64 and also the instructions on tummo,65 inner incan-descence, based on the Sole Ornament of the Five Families of V l!frasattva. 66 I completed the required number of recita-tions in the preliminary practices of the Great Perfection, and through their blessing acquired some understanding of the meaning of the teach-ings of the Victorious Ones. One day, at eighteen, I thought, \"Food and wealth have no real essence; I must practice the Dharma.\" Just then, a goldsmith came by with a golden image depicting Orgyen Rinpoche seated upon a lotus flower on a lake and accompanied by the divine lady Mandarava and the princess Yeshe Tsogyal. Although I owned only two rk:.omos,67 I offered him these along with some silver coins68 as payment; it pleased him [20b]. For the consecration, I invited my kind root master, Jetsunjamyang Gyatso Rinpoche. To-gether with many ngakpas, he threw the flowers of consecration. I held a great feast, and the local people rejoiced. Mterward, Kashul Nyengyal and others called upon the goldsmith, who as a result received commissions for many more gilded statues. While my kind root master,Jamyang Gya-tso, was staying at Tashikhyil, I went to visit him many times and offered him whatever I pos-sessed. Because I did exactly as he asked, he treated me with great affection. Notes 1. The Diamond Throne of India (Skt.

To be born into a rich family is the source of great attachment, while to be born into a poor family is the source of great difficulties. The former circum-stance hinders one's aspiration to renounce the world, and the latter hinders one's ability to practice the Dharma. To be born into a family that is neither very rich nor very poor thus offers the best conditions to further one's Dharma practice. 10.

Various Nepalese coins (called tamka, Tib. tangka, from a Muslim name) equivalent to one-and-a-half sho circulated in Tibet at the same value, although some were made of pure silver and some of 50 percent alloy. The issue of debased coins caused repeated conflicts with Nepal (see chap. 13, note 46). Chinese coins of fme silver equivalent to one sho were also common. The kanna (skar ma) is the smallest monetary unit and is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of a sho. A che-gye (plryed brgyad) is half of a cut tanka. A dotse (rdo tshad = stone-size) is the weight, or collection of fifty sangs. A Chinese tamik (rta rmig = horse hooD is a silver ingot cast in the shape of a horse's hoof.

One day, when I carne into the presence of my root guru,Jamyang Rinpoche, he asked, \"What do you intend to do? Aren't you going to take a wife?\" I answered, ''I have no desire to be reborn in samsara. Having seen the troubles that come with having a home, I have no desire to have a wife; my sole desire is to give up all the concerns of this life, as the spiritual masters advise, and to stay in the pleasant groves of a mountain retreat, drinking the nectar of the holy Dharma.\" Pleased with my answer, he went on, \"Well, my son, if that's so, you're not wrong. Meat, liquor, sense pleasures, worldly enjoyments-the best things of samsara are temporarily beguiling. Young brides in the full bloom of youth and beauty are expert at leading one astray. There-fore, even if you have as your companion a young daughter of the gods, have no attachment, have no desire. Why? Speaking generally, be-cause all the things of this world are without essence, impermanent, unreliable, and by their very nature lead to suffering [22b].ln particular, because domestic life is like a pit of fire, a canni-bal island, a nest of poisonous snakes. Enjoying the entire array of samsaric perfections, wealth, and pleasures is like eating food mixed with poi-son, like licking honey on a razor blade, like the jewel on a snake's head: a single touch destroys. \"Consider this and keep in mind that all spiritual beings, from the fully enlightened Buddha down to the masters of the present, cast away the preoccupations of this life. They received the nectar of the sacred teachings on sutra and man-tra at the feet of a holy master, and drank it in the 27 cool shade of solitary mountain forests until they were satisfied. When their spiritual experience and realization had grown to full maturity, they were able to bring benefit to themselves and to others.

Look with compassion on myself and all beings. Son, son! You're right! What good is a wife? A wife is like a black noose tying you to samsara, Like an adversary who attracts all kinds of undesirable things. Once you've taken a wife, There's no time or chance for bliss.

Then, he broke into laughter. When I think of it now, these were pro-phetic words, for just as he had said, I later had the good fortune to practice meditation in soli-tary mountain retreats. Meanwhile, the boys from my father's side kept telling me, \"It's time for you to marry.\" My mother and relatives echoed them, saying that I should take as my wife either the young widow of my maternal uncle, who had died at the age of twenty-one, or a certain other girl. \"Choose be-tween these two,\" they said. I replied, \"Listen, kind mother and you, my relatives. I am deter-mined to practice the Dharma. I do not want a wifc \" e. \"By all means you must take one,\" my n:J.other insisted, \"for who will take care of our land and house?

All your uncles practice the Dharma that way.\" They went on with many examples, and gave all sorts of reasons. I replied, ''I want nothing to do with that kind of Dharma. I would rather not practice the Dharma at all! If I were to take a wife, she would have to be a peerless woman, beautiful to look at, pleasant to listen to, easy to be with, harmonious, agreeable--one who would gladden everyone's mind. What's the point of marrying a slovenly, bellicose woman who likes to gorge herself and fall asleep?\" [23b]. A few people nearby smiled and laughed. One of my relatives pressed me further: \"Then you should take a perfect wife, one just like you described. We will add whatever you may need in the way of wealth and food.\" But I ended the discussion by saying, \"Well, I was just teasing you. In this world, there might be such a rare woman, a beautiful daughter from a wealthy family, with a sweet voice and noble character, like a daughter of gods come into the human realm, like a fresh lotus flower in bloom that one never tires of looking at-in short, an object of desire for both men and gods. ''When such a peerless woman is wed to a man who is like a celestial prince, who comes from a rich and powerful family, both of them are dressed up in elegant robes and bedecked with jewels, corals dangling from their ears. As all eyes are focused on them, they think, 'How fine if it could be like this forever, without sick-ness, without growing old.' \"But some years later, after a few prized boys and less-prized girls 1 have been born to them, and after they have undergone illness and misfortunes, their many troubles quickly age them. If someone then says, 'They were once that young couple,' who would believe it? ''When I see beautiful people who, as the years pass, tum into an elderly pair who no longer look appealing to anyone, I realize that, if I took a young wife now, a time would eventually come when we would be just another grimy, wiz-ened old couple, and I cannot but feel dismay. \"Even if all of you got together to give me a heavenly wife [24a], I wouldn't want her. While still young, my only prayer is to practice the Dharma just as the masters of the past have done, so that, in future lives, I may be reborn not in samsara but in the Blissful Pure land. There, in the company of those freed from birth and death, I will enjoy the feast of the sublime Dharma.\" Again, in verse, I said: Lord, root guru, Vajradhara, Bless this beggar"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"That he may accomplish the divine Dhanna Now I will give myself some advice; All of you, listen a bit, as well. In general, when you examine carefully Outer things, whatever they may be, You see them to be impermanent and without essence.

As for the Renouncing the World 29 particular young woman I had been asked to marry, she ended up happily married to the son of one of my relatives. For my Dharma practice, she had indirecdy been a great help. Once, Bendhe, my relative and Dharma friend, had some disagreement with my mother. I inter-vened, and thus their samaya was not damaged. Later, when Bendhe's irritation had subsided, he invited me to come to his home, and, as we were discussing various religious and worldly matters over a cup of tea and a glass of chang, 2 he con-fided, \"Anger just brings harm to oneself, doesn't it? You were good to me.\" In that way, he complimented me. During the time I spent at home, I cannot remember ever having said a malicious word to anyone. At break times during religious gather-ings and when we were listening to the Dharma, in order to relieve people's tiredness and wake them up a bit, I used to tell amusing stories, and they would all break into laughter. Some, remem-bering these stories, could not stop laughing. I only needed to open my mouth and most of them would start to laugh. Even some of the older yogins asked me to their tea breaks, saying, \"NgawangTashi, tell us a joke,\" and they would be amused. I would say witty things that hurt no one's feelings, at which people could not help laughing. During feasts and popular gatherings I would joke and clown, increasing everyone's good humor and cheerfulness. They even say that a long time after I had renounced this life, old people recalled my pleasantries and laughed. Sometimes I would sing the spiritual songs of the revered Lord Kalden Gyatso to old people and inspire them to recite the mani [25a]. Ex-plaining to them the meaning of these songs as best I could, I turned the minds of these old people toward the Dharma. In one of these songs it says, If you aspire to mountain solitudes Under peaks wrapped in mist,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"30 The Life of Shabkar There are natural caves in steep, rocky cliffs. To stay in such places will bring immediate and ultimate joy. Whenever I sang praises of mountain retreats, I would make a wish that the day might come when I would have the good fortune to stay in mountain solitudes. One day my root guru, Jamyang Gyatso Rinpoche, showed the signs of illness, and, leav-ing Tashikhyil, he went to a place known as Meditation Cave. Although he was given all kinds of attention during his sickness, and although many prayers were offered for his long life, nothing helped, and he left for other realms. I was overcome by great sadness. Returning home, I told my mother what had happened, and, overwhelmed by grief, I sang a song of despair: The sole object of hope of all celestial beings, The wish-fulfilling tree, Has suddenly been felled. , When the wish-fulfilling tree Lies on the ground What will become of the desolate gods? The sole hope of the poor, The wish-fulfilling jewel, Has been stolen away. Without the wish-fulfilling jewel What will become of the desolate poor? The gracious guru, the sole hope ofhis disciples, Has departed for other Buddhafields. Once the genuine guru has gone What will become of his desolate students? Even if, riding a miraculous horse, I could roam over the whole earth, Where could I find such a teacher? Where can I now meet the guru? [25b]. I wept a long time. In tears, too, my mother consoled me with the words: My only son, for whom I've cared since birth, Listen to your mother's words: do not despair. I need not say How great his kindness was to you. For me, as well, he was the lama With whom I had the deepest connection. Although the guru's sudden departure Has broken our hearts, What good does it do to stay prostrate with despair? To offer whatever we can for his funeral rites Is the best way to fulfill his enlightened wishes. As my mother spoke, my grief subsided. Among our possessions was one fme rkomo. 3 I thought we should offer her for the funeral ceremonies and mentioned it to my mother, who agreed, saying that she had just been think-ing the same thing. The next morning, a relative came by and said, sympathetically, \"People say that you are going to offer your rkomo for the funeral. Is that true?\" ''Yes,\" I said, \"it is.\" \"Well,\" he replied, \"you should see what the whole com-pany of yogins is going to offer. Offer a fraction of that; it would be quite enough. Mter all, this isn't the funeral of your father or mother. Keep your rkomo.\" I answered him in this way: Brother, your advice came from your heart, But my thoughts are just the reverse.

The Victorious Ones of the three times Have all said in a single voice That to make offerings To a single hair of one's own master Surpasses making offerings to a thousand Buddhas. My relative then said, \"I spoke with pure intention, thinking that you, mother and son, might not be able to sustain yourselves; but if you don't take my advice, there is no point in trying to hinder your virtuous act.\" With that, he left. I went, with the tkomo, and offered it as a contribution for the funeral. I did it with the wish to fulfill my guru's wisdom intentions, praying over and over again for his swift return. A senior yogin, Tsebum Gyal, offered seven hide bags of wheat, and my other yogin friends offered to-gether one hide bag containing whatever flour and roasted barley they had gathered. With all this, alms, tea, bread, flour, and barley were presented to a hundred monks ofShohong, and the funeral offerings were made in a complete, ample way. Gyal Khen Rinpoche also made offerings, and so did the people of Mongolia when they came to know the news. Nearly everyone who heard of it went about saying, ''It is wonderful that Ngawang Tashi offered his only tkomo.\" Renouncing the World 31 Not long afterward, having copied a holy book, I received a tkomo. Then, having given a sister in marriage, we received another tkomo and, having recited some holy scriptures, I received one more. I thought that this was due to the guru's blessings. On the day of the cremation, the sky was perfectly clear, yet on the eastern side of the funeral stupa there appeared a vivid five-colored rainbow, predominantly white. All the heart-sons gathered there saw it. The conviction that the guru was a real Buddha grew naturally in our minds [26b]. These signs, we thought, indicated that he had gone to the eastern Buddhafield of ManifestJoy.4 Grieved by my guru's departure to another realm, I could not stay home peacefully; so, accompanying a Dharma companion, the her-mit of Tongsa, as well as Topzang Lama and a few other friends, I went on a pilgrimage. We visited the great sacred places ofDentig, Yantig,5 andjampa Bumling-the abode of the Hundred Thousand Maitreyas6-and places where images of several deities had appeared by themselves in the rock(the Chakrasamvara ofLogya, the Great Compassionate One of Gegosu, and the Hayagriva of Agang)7 as well as the White Stupa, 8 the Valley of Buddhas, and some holy places in China, too. Coming upon these miraculously formed images that had great blessings, and all these holy places, I prayed again and again to be able to perfect every aspect of spiritual life. The following year, I went to Tashikhyil Monastery in the frrst month, on the occasion of the Great Prayer Festival, and in the seventh month for the scholastic gathering. There I did many prostrations and circumambulations, and offered butter-lamps before the image of the Crowned Buddha of the Golden Pagoda. I made an ardent prayer that I might be able to practice the Dharma perfectly.

Abandoning concern for my native land, for my family and friends, and for this life's affairs, I must go to some place far away, and practice the Dharma truly [27b]. I must do this, and it is already late.\" An unbearable sadness arose in my mind, and I told my mother: \"Mother, death comes suddenly, and one cannot predict its arrival. I must practice Dharma now, genuinely. The sutras say, 'Samsara is like the sharp point of a needle, on which no happi-ness can ever be found.' \"No matter where we are reborn on the wheel of existence, there is nothing but suffering; whoever we befriend is but our companion in suffering; whatever we enjoy is but an enjoyment of suffering; whatever things we do are but the means to attract suffering. \"Especially, as Lord Buddha said, domestic life is nothing but a source for suffering-like a pit of fire, a cannibal island, a nest of venomous snakes. I must now become completely home-less. Whatever happens, I must practice the Dharma.

Don't be sad. I am confident that the wishes and aims of us both, mother and son, will be accomplished, in this and future lives.\" My mother's spirits brightened. Then I went to Tashikhyil, an isolated place of retreat. I met Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche and told my whole story to him. Very pleased, he said, ''We are inviting Y ongdzin Arik Geshe Rinpoche26 to Doby Monastery to give full ordination to Kusho Lakha Tulku. It would be very auspicious if you were ordained at the same time. After that, it would be excellent for you to go to meet the Dharma King, Pontsang Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo. I shall take you there. But don't change your mind! Most of these yogins have very changeable minds. Don't change yours.\" At that instant, hearing the name of the supreme Dhanna King, my hair stood on end and tears of devotion filled my eyes. My longing to meet him became like that of a man thirsting for water. From that moment, the urge to go to him, whatever might happen, never left my mind [28b].

To mark my grati-tude to my mother and my relative, Topzang Bendhe, who had always been kind to me, I drew for each of them a \"chokra that liberates on contact,\" of the kind known as liberat:ing the Cities, 27 and put one around each of their necks. After this, I went to Doby Monastery and had robes made. In those days my hair was about three feet long. One of the monks at the hermitage seized a sharp wool-shearing knife and teased me, saying, \"Eh, what a nice sheep from Shohong! Looks like he's ready to be sheared!\" Everyone around burst into laughter. That night, I dreamed that as I was going up a lofty mountain I came to a boulder obstructing the path. A man cleared it away, and as I reached the summit the sun was rising. On the summit, in a hermitage, I beheld an image of Lord Atisha. On the morning of the auspicious eighth day of the waxing moon in the fifth month of the female Iron Bird Year,28 I was ordained. Arik Geshe Rinpoche, the emanation of Arya Nagar-juna, the supreme leader of the Chariot of the Teachings, the great holder of the Vinaya, en-dowed with the three virtues of being learned, pure, and noble-minded, whose name--Jampel Gelek Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo-1 hardly dare to pronounce, acted as main abbot. He was sec-onded by the supreme luminary of the teachings, Gyal Khenchen Gedun Tenpai Nyima Rinpoche [29a], who, acting as auxiliary abbot, asked the secret questions. 29 Following the traditional procedure, with Lakha T ulku Rinpoche and many others, in the midst of the requisite number of monks, I received, in order, the novice vows and those of a fully ordained monk. I received the name ofjampa Chodar, \"Kind One who Spreads the Dharma.\" Seeming very pleased, the abbot said, \"There will be great benefit for sentient beings and for the Dharma.\" At the request of the whole congregation, the abbot also bestowed the empowerment of Kunrilc, the All-Knowing One, and the transmission of the Blissfol Path. 30 It is said: 'just as the earth supports both the animate and the inanimate, discipline is the sup-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"34 Th£ Lift ofShabkar port of all good qualities.\" Having understood that the precious monastic training was the foun-dation of all virtue and excellence, I thereafter behaved according to the Vinaya, eating only before noon, taking off shoes in the temple, drink-ing blessed water, and so forth. On my way home, I encountered Grand-mother Lumoya, a relative of mine. She was a woman well-versed in worldly chatter, with marked likes and dislikes concerning others. She had been very fond of me. Not recognizing me, she called out, \"Who are you?\" \"I am Ngawang Tashi,\" I answered. \"Ay! What a wicked thing you've done!\" she exclaimed. ''It looks like your father Ngawang Tsewang's lineage is fmished now! You don't deserve to be called a man! Later, when people see your poor old mother deprived of every-thing, you will have set an infamous example!\" In reply I sang these verses: Dear loving grandmother, listen to me. Aren't the words you've said today mis-taken? Having given up wickedness of all kinds [29b], I have now gone forth toward excellence. Remaining in samsara, where there is no contentment-To desire and be attached to samsara: Now that's wicked! Falling into the prison that is one's homeland-Clinging to the father and mother and wife That bind one to samsara: Now that's wicked! Taking part in all sorts of nonvirtuous deeds Just to feed and clothe one's family: Now that's wicked! Human life is over in an instant. To leave for the next life without Dharma: Now that's wicked! Approad·.ing one's next rebirth, The impulsive force of negative acts Hurls one down into the three lower realms: Now that's wicked! Having thrown down a layman's rags, My body wears excellence, the beauty of saffron robes. Having given up all useless talk, My speech remains in excellence, Making prayers and reciting mantras. Having cast away all nonvirtuous thoughts, My mind rests in excellence, conceiving pure thoughts. I got away from a worldly home As though from a pit of live coals And inherited the cool pavilion of homelessness: This is the excellence of my action. Happy in this life, when going on to the next I shall ascend, higher and higher: This is the excellence of my career. She replied, \"Right now you look all right, walking along, all decked out in your robes. I am an old grandmother, not long for this world, but should I live a few more years, I'd like to see what becomes of you. I've seen a good many of those who used to practice the Dharma. To reach the ultimate point of it is not so easy. Well, well, all the best! Om mo.ni padme hum ... \" So saying, she went away, mumbling her mo.ni.

Sur, burnt offering (gsury: an offering of smoke produced by burning tsampa (barley flour) mixed with the \"three whites\" (milk, butter, and cheese), the \"three sweets\" (sugar, molasses and honey), and blessed substances. This smoke, accompanied by a meditation upon Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of Compassion, in the form of Khasarpana, and the recitation of his mantra, OM MANI PADME HUM, re-lieves the pangs of hunger and thirst of the pretas ()'i dwags), or hungry ghosts. 22. The water-torma offering (chu gtor) is an offering of pure water made to the \"four classes of guests,\" (see Author's Introduction, note 32). 23. Zache Khandro (za byed mklza' gro) is a wrathful dakini related to a purification practice. One makes a fire and visualizes Zache Khandro in it with her mouth wide open. One then throws into the frre black sesame seeds and one thinks that as the seeds enter the mouth ofZache Khandro and are burned, all one's defilements, which had been absorbed in the seeds, are purified. Zache (za byed), \"the devourer,\" is a synonym of fire. 24. The teachings on prana of the Indian maha-siddhajahabira are instructions on the vital energies (rlung) and on taking the essence of the elements (rasl£Yana or bcud len); through them one can ultimately transform one's ordinary physical aggregates into a rainbow body (Ja' lus). These instructions, gathered by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, can be found in volume 30 (A) ofRT, pp. 311-564, and in the Com-pendium if Sadho.nas (sgrub thabs kun btus, vol. 11 ). In-structions on these teachings are also found in the tennas ofGarwang Dmje (gar dbang rdo rje, 1640-85). A disciple of the mahasiddha Mahanatha (who was con-sidered to be an emanation of Guru Padmasam-bhava), J ahabira himself had hundreds of disciples, among whom, in Tibet, were Manikanatha and Nesar Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk (gnas gsar Jam dbyangs mklzyen brtse dbangphyug, 1524-1568).Jahabira eventu-ally attained the rainbow body. 25. The Ancient (mying ma) and the New (gsar ma) Traditions correspond to the \"early\" and the \"later\" stages of translating Buddhist scriptures into Tibetan. See Appendix 1. 26. Concerning Arik Geshe (A rig dge bshes), see Translator's Introduction, note 46. 27. The \"Wheel that Liberates the Cities\" (grong khyer grot ba'i 'Ichor lo). See sgrub thabs kun btus, vol. 13, p. 689. Once, Atisha pondered the terrible state of suffering of beings in general and of the Tibetan people in particular. He shed tears and wondered if there could be a way to ease these sufferings. One night a dakini appeared in his dream and told him to go to Vajrasana in India (Bodhgaya). Atisha trans-ported himself there miraculously and prayed ardently in front of the place where the Buddha had attained enlightenment. At that moment a beautiful dakini appeared in the sky before him in a mass oflight and showed him the \"Wheel that Liberates the Cities.\" She told him that if he had that \"wheel,\" or chakra, drawn in Tibet it would relieve immense suffering. So Atisha had this done. The chakra depicts Atisha at the center, with mantras written around him. It is said that it liberates from rebirth in the lower realms of samsara the whole population of the place where it is kept. Shabkar was famous for drawing such chakras, writing tiny letters, and drawing in miniature. Some of these were kept at his birthplace, Shohong, until recently. 28. The year was 180 I. Shabkar was then twenty. 29. The secret questions, which are asked of the candidates before they receive full monastic ordina-tion, concern conceivable obstacles to the keeping of the vows, such as not having permission from one's parents, and so forth. 30.

There, I paid homage at a clay stupa containing the relics of my kind root guru, Jamyang Gyatso Rinpoche. Offering many flow-ers that I had brought from home, I prayed, \"Precious teacher! Grant your blessing that, for-saking my homeland, I may fmd a qualified master and have the good fortune to practice the profound Dharma\" [3lb]. On the way back to my village, at a place called Dobum Nyagkha, I recognized a friend named Poma walking some distance away. From afar, I called out mischievously, \"Brother Po! Where is Upper Nyengya? Where is the Tsekgo family house? Is their son, the ngakpa, around?\" He answered, \"The place you're looking for is up there. The Tsekgo house is the lower one. Whether the fellow you mention is there or not, I couldn't say. Where are you from?\" As he came closer, Poma recognized me, and we started to laugh. We sat and talked for a long time. Before we parted, I said: Emal Listen, fortunate, dearest friend! I, Ngawang Tashi, To practice the essence ofDharma Have given up actions without essence. Having taken up robes, I am now calledjampa Chodar, \"Kind One Who Spreads the Dharma.\" 39 With my mind intent on pure Dharma, I'll practice at T ashikhyil And other secluded spots.

In short, keep your three doors2 in harmony with the Dharma, To make sure you have no regrets at the moment of death. May we both have long, healthy lives, And may we meet again and again. He replied, ''You are a fortunate fellow. Don't go too far away!\" With that, we parted [32a]. As I approached my house, Dorje Tseten, \"Adamantine Life,\" a close friend, invited me into his home nearby. We drank tea and dis-cussed my ordination and other things.

Now, I would like to do something truly worthwhile. I must go and attend a qualified master who lives far away and, having received his profound instructions, seek a solitary place where I can practice meditation. \"Though one of my sisters has married and left, the other is still at home. Mother, I am thinking of going to another land for some years. Please, give me your consent.\" She replied, \"I have already given you my consent to your practicing the Dharma. But I would be happy if you would stay nearby until I die.\" Then she said: Son, so dear to my heart, I have cared for you since you were small. Leaving your mother, where will you go? Even young animals never stray from their mothers. Son, how can you leave me? Son, you are the very eyes in my head. If you go far away, Your mother will be like a blind woman. Son, you are my very own limbs. If you go far away, Your mother will be like a cripple. Son, you are my very own heart [32b]. If you go far away, Your mother will be like a corpse.

My sister, Lumo Kyi, said, \"Ifl have to stay at home, I won't be able to provide for myself, let alone take care of Mother. And others will call me an old spinster! I won't stay!\" Then she said: Brother, if you have the heart to leave Mother, Why shouldn't I have the heart to leave, also? It is hard for a daughter to run a house alone. I won't stay! I'll fmd some other household! In this dark age, Most girls can hardly fend for themselves; How can they also take care of their mothers? People will snicker, and call me an old maid! IfMother is happy, or if she suffers-It's your doing! It's your choice! Saying this, she began to weep. I answered: Listen, sister Lumo K yi! Don't cry! No garment is warmer than sheepskin; No jewelry more beautiful than gold and turquoise; No scent is sweeter than sandalwood; And no place is more pleasant Than being at one's mother's side. Listen, sister Lumo K yi! Even ifi were to go far away, What would prevent my protecting Both you and our mother? See how the sun, so far away, Continuously nourishes the lotus gardens.

As you and mother ask, I won't go too far off. I thought, \"lfl tell my mother and sister the truth, they aren't going to let me go. But, ifl stay nearby, how can I do much practice? I'm going to have to lie. Surely, lying for the sake of the Dharma can only be a minor offense.\" I told my mother and sister that this year I would accompany Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche to Mongolia and promised that, having gathered provisions, I would return and settle at T ashikhyil. My mother said she had no objection to this plan. But my sister argued, \"If he goes, he will never come back! Please, mother, don't let him go!\" My mother finally said, ''It's up to him.\" I decided that I would leave. I stayed at home for another week. During that time, I gave my mother and sister some beneficial teachings and some advice about worldly affairs.

Though such is the nature of samsara, May we swiftly meet again. Mter this last farewell, we parted with un-bearable sadness. I spent the remainder of the evening with my mother. The next morning, before my departure, my mother made some delicious tea. While we sat enjoying it, she turned to me and said, \"Son, be very careful when you're traveling!\" I smiled, and she went on, giving more motherly advice. Then, grow-ing somber, she said, \"Look at this wrinkled, withered face. I'm old now, and death is close at hand. Keep in mind the old mother you've left behind. Have pity on me and come back quickly.\" She began to weep. My sister, too, burst into tears. My mother and sister accompanied me out-side. As I turned to leave, a great tear fell from each of my mother's eyes and I thought, \"The birth and death of beings is so uncertain. Now I am about to leave my mother, having lied to her. Who knows if we will ever meet again?\" I, too, became very sad; unable to control myself, I began weeping. \"Mother, you need not come further; stay here, don't cry, I will come back .\" Overwhehned by sorrow, I walked away, looking back again and again, tears streaming down my cheeks. Heartbroken that her only son was leaving, my mother stood there weeping, and watched, transfixed, until I disappeared from sight [34b]. My friend Dmje Tseten lit a smoke-offering on his roof and then stood in his doorway watching me. Reaching Lablung Khaso, I looked back and saw my mother and Dorje Tseten still stand-ing in their doorways. When I continued into Lablung and could no longer see my mother, I stopped, grief-stricken, and considered going back to see her for just a moment. I had the feeling we would never meet again. When I had vanished from view, my mother, still grieving, went back into her house. I continued on my way, accompanied by Rinchen Gyal, ''Victorious jewel,\" a childhood friend to whom I had taught writing and lonna-making. When we reached Tashikhyil, I asked him, \"Could you please look after my mother and sister? I am on my way to Mongolia to study the Dharma and will probably stay there for several years. Meanwhile, would you help look after them?\" He promised to do the sowing, the harvesting, and whatever else he could do to help them.

Having said this, I asked him not to tell my mother and sisters of my plans. I left with a group of Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche's attendants. We crossed into Little Mongolia3 at a place where a narrow gorge leads into a wide open plain. We felt light-hearted, as though a new day was breaking. After some time we arrived at Kusho Rinpoche's [Gyal Khenchen's] tent camp, not far from Urgeh, the seat of the precious Dharma King.4 A gentle rain fell, after which the sun shone warm and bright and a rainbow appeared. In-terpreting this as an auspicious omen meaning that the sun ofhappiness would rise, I felt joyful. When I appeared before Kusho Rinpoche, he smiled and said, \"Marvelous! This rainbow must be a sign that Pontsang Rinpoche will accept you.\" The great Orgyen [Padmasambhava] made the following prophecy about Pontsang Rin-poche: In the direction of the great lake Will appear an emanation of Karma Guru5 ' The Subduer of Demons. Should he meet with this teaching, His prosperity will increase like a lake in summer. As this prophecy says, Pontsang Rinpoche6 was an emanation of the great master, Perna Jungne, the Lotus-born Guru, the heart-emana-tion of the Buddhas of the Three Times [35b]. He had crossed the ocean of knowledge of scrip-tures and sciences, and had realized the natural state, the profound and luminous vajra essence. . He was a powerful monarch with the beau-Meeting My Teacher 43 tiful name of Pontsang Dalai Tai Chingwang Ngawang Dargye Pal Zangpo, the King \"Great Oceanic King, All-Blooming Lord of Speech.\" With Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche, I came into his presence. We arrived during a feast, just as someone was singing. I prostrated myself three times be-fore the Chogyal, the Dharma King, and offered him a copy of the Dzogchen teaching Buddha in the Palm ofT our Hand, 7 and a white scar£ I also offered white scarves to his consort and sons and asked after their health. The very moment I met the Dharma King and his consort, I perceived them as enlightened beings and felt immeasurable devotion and joy. Both the precious Dharma King and his queen spoke kindly to me. He opened Buddha in the Palm of r our Ha:nd and read a few passages from it. That evening, he arranged for me to stay in a small tent and told his bursar, \"This fellow has come a long way to see me. Take good care of him.\" The next morning, just as the sun was begin-ning to warm up the place, the Dharma King entered my tent with his personal attendant, Zangpo, who carried a copy of the Graded Path to Enlightenment, 8 a brilliant teaching by the great master Tsongkhapa which, with its threefold annotation, illuminates the three worlds. The Dharma King said, \"I am glad that you have come here with the intention of practicing the Dharma. Having developed a bit of renun-ciation, one may tum to practice, but there is the danger that later one's mind might change [36a]. So, to train your mind by studying and contem-plating this text is very important. It contains two sections: one meant for individuals oflesser abil-ity and one meant for those of average ability. Train your mind accordingly, be sure to gener-ate a genuine wish for liberation, and be free from the slightest desire for worldly achieve-ments.\" Before leaving my tent, he spoke at length about how to rely upon and serve one's spiritual master. For a month, the precious Dharma King visited me once or twice daily to give lengthy instruction on sections of the text ranging from"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"44 The Life of Shabkar the difficulty of obtaining a free, well-favored human birth, to how to make progress in medi-tation on inner calm and insight. He then told me, \"You are intelligent. Now, train your mind according to the methods suited to the higher, middle, and inferior individuals.\" As he advised, I spent the next two months training my mind. Then, Gyal Khenchen, Alm Gelong of Tongsa, and many earnest students, including myself, requested a maturing empowerment of the Secret Mantrayana. At the beginning of the preparation for the empowerment, I offered this seven-branch prayer: Ema! Precious Dharma King! The faithful students gathered here make obeisance. With genuine devotion, we offer riches, Both real and imagined, 9 And confess our wrongdoings, failures, and obscurations. Rejoicing in all noble activity, We ask that you turn the wheel of the highest teaching, And pray that you never pass into nirvana. May our accumulated merit ripen all beings So that they swifdy attain Buddhahood. That night, after Chogyal Rinpoche had given the preparation for the empowerment [36b], I dreamed that my mother gave me a skull-cup filled with chong and that I drank all of it. When I related my dream to him, he said, \"This is a good dream. It indicates that you have a connection that will enable you to accomplish all the guru's pith instructions.\" At dawn the following morning, he bestowed on us the maturing empowerment of the Victori-ous One, the Wish-fol.filling Gem, Hayagriva and Varahi. This is a profound and extraordinary teaching from the cycle of the new treasures. 10 In heaven, the lineage of vidyadharas remains unbro-ken; on earth, the lines and colors of the mandala have not yet vanished; in between, the heaps of sacred substances have not yet diminished. Unsullied by demons and samaya-breakers, it still carries the fresh breath ofboth the wisdom dakinis and worldly dakinis. During the empowerment, when I threw my flower11 it fell toward the north and I received the name Tsogdruk Rangdrol, \"Self-liberation of the Six Senses,\" which refers to ·the natural liberation of sense-attachments. 12 After Chogyal Rinpoche gave a few oral transmissions, the em-powerment ended. Every day thereafter, he gave a complete explanation of the practices related to each of the four empowerments. First, he gave teachings on the development stage of the deity, related to the Vase Empowerment; next, he gave teachings on the channels and energy practice of tummo, related to the Secret Empowerment. After that, he gave teachings on the bliss-void practice of the mudra, related to the Wisdom Empowerment; and finally, he gave teachings on T rekcho and Thogal, related to the Word, or Symbolic, Empower-ment. He also gave the permission-blessing for the protectors of the teachings. On subsequent occasions, he conferred on us the maturing empowertnents, the liberating instructions, and the support of the transmissions for several practices: the Nectar-drop qf Vajrapani, which Vajrapani himself gave to the siddha of I..odrak, Lekyi Dorje; Mahamudra teachings such as the root text and commentary of the Precious Vajra-garla.nd qfthe Holder qf Secrets;13 the Dzogchen Yeshe.Lama;14Nyima Trakpa's15 Dzogchen teach-ing; and the Heart-drop qf the Dakin.is [3 7 a J. !6 Once he said to us: \"The Dharma of the Secret Mantrayana relies on interdependent links. When Jetsun Milarepa offered his guru, Lord Marpa, an empty cauldron, he created a link that caused him to have litde food when he practiced later on. \"Marpa of Lodrak created yet another link,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"however, by filling the cauldron with clarified butter so that, later in his life, Milarepa met with abundance and so did the holders ofhis lineage. Though you may own nothing, never request a teaching empty-handed.\" He gave me a silver mandala plate with gold, silver, coral, pearls, turquoise, jeweled neck-laces, grain, brocades, and other things, and told me to use these when making the mandala offering. I did so, and believe that because of this, whenever I had something to accomplish for myself or for others it was never clifficult to obtain the resources needed. Finally, gathering various offerings, we held an elaborate gana.clzoba feast. When offering the first part to the guru and consort, I sang this song: My own lord, Dhaima King, diadem above my head, My own pure mind I offer you as a feast. My own wish, with all the fortunate dis-ciples, is that you shower teachings on us, according to My own and others' capacities. Abhe Rinpoche, 17 I offer this feast to you, too. Ati Dakini, you who have realized the meaning of the letter A-the sign of the uncreated, in the tradi-tion of the Great Perfection, Ama-mother--care for us with a mother's love. As I sang this song, the Dharma King, his consort, sons, ministers and the whole assembly were amused and laughed [37b]. I thought, \"Offerings of gold and silver don't make them laugh. Perhaps making the guru, his consort and sons laugh may also cause them to accept me with love.\" Just as in the past the mother Dagmema18 cared for Jetsun Milarepa, so the precious mother Abhe, vastly knowledgeable about worldly and religious matters, took care of me with the great-est loving-kindness, providing food, clothing, and whatever else I needed. Meeting My Teacher 45 One night I dreamed that I held in my hand a two-sided mirror, the size of a gong. In the sky overhead both sun and moon had risen. When I held the mirror toward the sky a second moon rose to the left of the sun. Many monks and laypeople assembled on the plain and cried out, \"Look! Another moon has risen to the left of the sun and moon.\" I thought, \"These people don't realize that it is just a projection of my mirror.\" As I tilted the other side of the mirror toward the ground, white light filled the whole place. I reported this dream to Chogyal Rinpoche, who said, \"It is a very good dream, a sign that, if you meditate, experiences and realization will occur.\" I stayed for some time at a place above Urgeh, where I studied the Seven Treasuries, the 17zree Great Chariots, 19 and other essential writings of Longchen Rabjam. I went over the clifficult points with the Dharma King until I had gained a clear understanding of the different stages on the path, according to the views of both my own and other traditions. Chogyal Rinpoche requested that lama Jimba, whom he regarded as supremely worthy of veneration, teach me the monastic discipline [38a]. Accordingly, l.amajimba taught me the Essence of the ViTlf91a-Ocean, complementing it with selections from the Hundred 77wusand Anecdotes on the Origin of the Vznaya and other works. 20 I gained some understanding from these scriptures; my guru was pleased. When Chogyal Rinpoche gave teachings on the four medical tantras to Lama Perna Rangdrol, \"Self-liberated Lotus,\" and others, I was allowed to come and listen. I also studied a little and learned to diagnose hot and cold diseases. Later, when I was staying in mountain retreats and working for the benefit of others, I was able to help many sick people. As it is said, \"On a golden mountain every-thing becomes gold,\" and just by living in Urgeh I acquired many qualities. I learned how to show respect to my superiors; how to show kindness to"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"46 The Lift of Shabkar those in humbler positions, and how to get along with my peers. In particular, in my attitude and in my practice, I learned how to attend properly the all-encompassing lord and protector of the mandala, the Dharma King. Because I saw all his actions as pure and did whatever he asked, he came to think of me as a heart-son. Therefore, as if fllling a vessel to the brim he gave me all the pith instructions of the old and new translations that he held, with noth-ing added or lost. From the great Chod practitioner, Konchog Chapel, \"He who Spreads the Doctrine of the Three Jewels,\"21 I received the empowerment for the Chod practice called Opening tJze Door of tJze S~; the empowerment of the Five Wrathfol Black Deities; the CMd Accomplished at One Sitting,22 sev-eral other transmissions on the practice of CMd [38b], teachings on bliss and emptiness related to the practice of tummo, and teachings on the Path of Means according to the Sole Ornament of tJze Five Families of V ajrasattva, which is a part of the T aldsang Phurba. 23 When the incarnation of Jetsun Jamyang Shepa, the precious Loseljigme Gyatso,24 \"Intelli-gent Fearless Ocean,\" was invited to Urgeh, Ire-ceived from him the oral transmission for the Protectors of tJze 1hree Families, the Hundred Deities of T ushita, and the Milctsema Prayer. 25 Since I had the good fortune to receive countless empowerments, oral transmissions, and instructions from many great masters, my mind became rich with the sacred teachings.

In Tseshung he set many fortunate and worthy disciples on the path of ripening and liberation. This extraor-dinary site, facing south, sunny in the winter and cool in the summer and autumn, is favorable to clarity of mind. Water, firewood, and all other necessities are available there. There is a pleasant cave called Thayenchi, which in Mongolian means the Hermit's Meditation Cave.1 Go there, and raise the victory banner of spiritual practice.\" On the eve of my departure for this holy place, the revered mother, Abhe Rinpoche, gave me a book cover made of beautifully woven brocade and the lord guru gave me a rosary, each bead of which bore a naturally formed triangle. I took these gifts with me as an auspi-cious connection. The treasurer and the bursar gave me enough provisions for a few months and sent two helpers to carry them. Thinking that at first I might be afraid to stay alone, the master said that one of them should stay overnight near the cave and return the next day [ 40b]. The three of us set out for the cave. When we reached it, my helpers, who were afraid to remain, each said to one another: \"You stay!\" I could see that they would never reach an agree-49 ment, so I told them: \"Neither of you needs to stay.l'm not afraid. Sweep the inside thoroughly, make a hearth, and then you can both go. If a murderous spirit haunts the place, it can kill me tomorrow night just as easily as tonight; now or later makes little difference. If the precious Dharma King questions you, explain that I told you there was no need to stay, and he won't scold you.\" So they happily went back. Mter they left, I made a small, square dwell-ing place in a comer of the cave. First I drew a swastika, symbolizing the unchangeable state, and on top of that I placed some dry grass and my monk's mat. In a high niche, I put a statue of the Buddha, Lord of the Teachings, and arranged some offerings in front of it. After sitting down comfortably, I made the following promise: \"In accordance with the words of my guru, I shall not leave this place until definite and genuine meditation experiences and realization arise in my being. At night, I won't sleep in the corpse-like posture of ordinary people but will stay cross-legged and upright. At all times, rather than indulging in idle chatter, I will refrain from speak-ing. I will eat once a day, at noon. I will live alone. I will think of nothing but my guru's instructions. I will not seek comforts but perse-vere in the hermit's life and accept its hardships. I will avoid all worldly distractions until I achieve stability in my realization [ 41 a]. In short, not letting my body, speech or mind stray into the ordinary, I shall practice day and night."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"50 7he Life of Shabkar May the root and lineage gurus grant their blessings that I be able to fulfill these promises! May the yidam deities grant me siddhis! May the dakinis, the Dharma protectors, and celestial beings who delight in virtue always remain with me! I then expressed these promises and prayers masong: Father, root guru, vajra-holder, Grant your blessing That I, your son, may keep to this mountain retreat. May I be able to practice correctly the profound Dharma As did the victorious sages of the past Throughout their exemplary lives. During the preliminaries common to all paths, May I accomplish the purpose of each practice. Then, during the main practice May all the qualities of meditation experiences and realization arise. Having reached the end of the path in this very life, May I strive for the benefit of all beings, my mothers. When I work for my own and others' benefit, May there be neither obstacles nor interruptions. May the teachings of the practice lineage Flourish in this place, Endowing it with auspiciousness. Sitting comfortably, I then assumed the seven-point posture of Vairocana2 and let my mind rest in its natural state. With my mind turned completely toward virtue, I went through the refuge with prostra-tions, the generation ofBodhicitta, the recitation of the hundred-syllable mantra, 3 the offering of the mandala, and guru yoga. I completed one hundred thousand repetitions of each of these practices. Signs related to the twofold accumula-tion of merit and wisdom, signifying the purifica-tion of defilements, occurred in my dreams. For my main practice I trained with great perseverance in the whole of the Graded Path of Enlightenment [ 41 b]. Thus I laid the foundation for an intense spirit of renunciation, ofBodhicitta, and a perfectly pure view.4 Next, I meditated on the development stage of the sadhana of the W1Sh-fo!filling Gem, Hayogri»a and Varahi. 5 I recited more than the customary number of mantras. Attachment and ordinary perceptions were purified, and I perceived all appearances as the display of the deity. Various signs appeared that indicated the presence of the guardian deities of the terma. Then I practiced the completion stage related to the channels, energies, and vital essences; through this the blissful warmth of inner heat blazed forth, and I was able to withstand the cold wearing just a single cotton garment. Mind and energy joined, entered into the central charmel, and untied the knots;6 I continuously experi-enced the union ofbliss and emptiness. Later, for many months, I concentrated on the extraordinary preliminary practices of the Great Perfection. Finally, for about three years, I concentrated exclusively on the practices of Trekcho and Thogal. I realized clearly the natu-ral state ofTrekcho, and the various visions and experiences ofThogal arose. At that point, I returned to the presence of the precious Dharma King to tell him about my practice and the various visions and meditation experiences I had had. He was extremely pleased. Smiling, his face like the radiant full moon, he said: ''My son! Having persevered with all your heart in the practice, renunciation, Bodhicitta, and. the correct view have truly taken birth in your being. You have also had extraordinary meditation experiences and realization of the two stages. \"Thus, the fortunate human birth you have obtained has become meaningful.

Having relied on"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"the instructions for the Thogal practice of spon-taneous presence, the wisdom of the four visions arose; this is indeed wonderful! [42a]. In one of his songs of realization, the omniscient Longchenpa says: \"The meditation ofluminosity that is naturally present is as follows: In the mansion oflight, the unchanging body, Is the stainless, hollow crystal channel Linked to the water-lamp, the 'far-reaching lasso'.7 Outwardly, the radiance that links jewel and ocean Appears in the cloudless sky. Inwardly, the five-colored light of the five wisdoms Appears as designs in a dome ofbrocade, Adorned by the lamp called 'empty spheres'. Amid all this are the vajra-chains of awareness, Small and large spheres strung together Like threads made of pure gold from the Jambu River, Adorned with clustered constellations of light Like peacock feathers' eyes. The appearance oflights arranged as triads Is the natural appearance called the 'absolute nature becoming manifest'. Then comes the vision of 'increasing appearances'. One sees images of wisdom mansions, Thousand-petaled lotuses of five-colored light, Spokes oflight, webs of jeweled beams, And crystal stupas of five-colored light. In the mansions of empty spheres Appear the seeds of awareness-various symbols, letters, and complete forms of Buddhas Radiating five-colored light throughout space. Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 51 In the vision called 'Awareness reaching its greatest magnitude', These displays are seen in groups of five. Wherever one looks, the universe is filled with light; One sees threads of light entering into one's heart. At that time, if one moves one's body, The realms of the ten directions quake; If one's body remains in the equanimity of samadhi All else rests in equanimity as well [42b]. Through the sonorous Brahma-like voices of the emanations The great drum of Dharma resounds; The qualities of the stages and paths are perfected. By fully integrating the two visions-The gradual increase of enlightened qualities And the exhaustion of dualistic perception-One reaches the stage called 'exhaustion of phenomena in dharmata'. 8 The gross material body, and the swarms of discursive thoughts are exhausted; Ripening karma and latent tendencies are exhausted; The seeds of ignorance and delusion are exhausted; Clinging to apparent phenomena is exhausted; Materiality is purified; its means of growth is exhausted. In the crystal mansion of the body Watch the five-colored lights As they emanate and gather: However the lights and awareness move, They dissolve in a state That is naturally present and primordially pure.

These are the instructions for liberation in this life.\" Having quoted these verses he continued: \"You may wonder which of these stages and levels you have reached. You have come to the point of the appearance of complete forms of Buddhas radiating five-colored light throughout space. Once you have reached this point, you have dealt with the bardo10 in this life. As it is said in the Clear Space T antra: When the vision of deities has increased to fullness, You have passed through the visions of the bardo within this life, And since you have recognized the sambhogakaya, There will be no further bardo. 11 \"Even if you were to die right now, you would attain enlightenment during the bardo in the body of perfect enjoyment. If you practice as long as you live, you will be liberated in the rainbow body within this lifetime, or you will be liberated in the dharmak.aya at the moment of death. Have no doubt about this.\" Such were his predictions. One night, I dreamed of a lofty crystal mountain with steps of blue sapphire cut into it [43a]. Climbing the steps, I saw the sun shining in the south. As its rays struck the crystal mountain, a white light shone from the northern face, bath-ing in light the northern plain, where many people joyfully played. I related this dream to Chogyal Rinpoche, who said: \"Your dream is excellent. In the past, Marpa of Lodrak made predictions about Milarepa by interpreting a dream. Today I will do the same with your dream.\" In an amused tone, he continued in verse: Ema! My fortunate only son: The mountain of immaculate crystal Is the teaching of the Vajrayana. The radiant shining sun Is none other than myself, This old father of yours. The steps you climbed symbolize Your gradual ascent of the paths and stages. The light shining toward the north Shows that in the north, You, my son, will benefit beings. That many beings dance in light Means that your disciples will be capable of practice. Understand and keep this in mind. Then he gave me the initiation, transmis-sion, and explanations of the Lmg-life Practice qf tlze Northern Continent, 12 with the essential oral instructions. Following this, both of us, master and disciple, did that longevity practice for a month. One day, holding a slate in his hand, the Dharma King said, 'Without thinking, let us write a four-line stanza.\" He wrote for me: Everyone is deceived by delusory sarnsara. Persevere in nothing but the holy Dharma And no doubt you shall escape The inescapable ocean of sarnsara."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"In turn I offered this reply: There is no happiness in samsara [ 4 3b]; Like ripples on the water, suffering follows suffering. Thus, in accord with the guru's words, I shall persevere in nothing but the holy Dharma. This was an exceptional and intimate time. Oqt of his immense compassion, the Dharma King spoke with me on many topics related to both Dharma and the world. These conversa-tions are still vivid in my mind. Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche, a guru who had always shown me great kindness, arrived on his yearly visit to Mongolia. He presented me with a monastic robe and a woolen shawl, and gave me extensive instructions and advice. Together we went to Thayenchi, where the great realized being Karma Tsewang Rigdzin had lived as a hermit. Spending the night there, we two, master and disciple, shared our under-standing and experiences, discussing various top-ics related to the supreme words of the Victorious Ones in the sutras and tantras. In an atmosphere of joy our two minds became as one. The next day, as he was leaving, I offered him this farewell song: Compassionate guru who helped me enter the Dharma, Protector of beings in this dark age, Supreme holder of the Dharma Who impartially preserves all teachings, May you continue happily on your way To benefit the teachings and all beings. The venerable Khenchen replied: Ema! 0 powerful yogin who accomplishes great bliss Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 53 Stay happily at this pleasant rocky cave In the joyful solitude ofTseshung, And we will meet again soon. Farewell until then; Auspicious links have been created In this retreat place today. Saying this he went away. I then received a letter from my dear mother urging me to return [ 44a]. Thinking it over, I decided that my living with her for twenty years had not brought her any benefit-how could I now benefit her by seeing her just once, while, at the same time, abandoning my practice? With some presents, I sent a letter asking about her health, and telling her that, according to my guru's command, I was now practicing the divine and perfect Dharma for the lasting happi-ness of both of us, mother and son. I said that I could not come that year but would see her the next. Soon afterward the glorious and excellent Terton Sonam Nyentrak, \"Famous Merit,\" an emanation of Drogmi Lotsawa 13 and a fifth-generation descendant ofTerton Dudul Dorje, came to Urgeh. The Dharma King requested many empowerments from him. Along with the Dharma King, I, too, was fortunate to receive the initiations for the Hundred Supreme Deities, 14 the Prqyer of the Spontaneous Fulfillment of all Aspira-tions, 15 and the Manifestation of Awareness, 16 and other initiations, seven altogether. The terton also granted the transmission and explanations of the cycle of the Single Golden Syllable of the Black Qyintessence17 and the cycle of teachings ofTerton Longsal Nyingpo, 18 the treasure discoverer \"Essence ofBrilliant Space.\" Before his departure, the precious terton came to Thayenchi. There, I questioned him about the sutras and tantras, and specifically about some difficult points of the Trekcho and Thogal practices of the luminous Great Perfec-tion. Pleased by these queries, he answered them at length. He also gave me many helpful teach-ings. I begged him for an object of faith for the hermits dwelling there, and he left an imprint of his hand in a rock.

We prayed that we, master and disciple, might meet again and again in all our lifetimes, and, our two minds having merged, he left [ 44b]. I remained in retreat. One day at noon, when the sky was clear, I walked to the summit of the hill above my cave and sat there alone. Toward the north, I saw a pure white cloud billowing over a mountain peak, as milk does when it is boiled into a froth and spills over. The moment I saw this, the memory of my precious spiritual father,Jamyang Gyatso, overwhelmed my mind, and I sang this song oflonging: To the north, A single great cloud surges Over the high mountain peaks-White as overflowing mille When I see this, I think of my guru's kindness. Beneath that distant cloud Rise the solitary heights ofTashikhyil. The way my perfect guru once lived In that excellent retreat place Comes back to my mind. Thinking of his kindness, Tears come to my eyes, sorrow into my heart. My mind is dazed, Perception becomes uncertain; Everything around me becomes hazy and unreal. How wonderful if he were here again! I am but an ordinary man, A man with scant devotion. Still, I long to meet him once again. The guru dwells now in the space of dharmakaya And his low, unfortunate son is left behind In the mire of samsara. When I see the myriad flowers Blooming in the meadows, The authentic guru's form Comes to mind. Then I could see his excellent form; Now I cannot. Thinking and thinking of him, The guru's presence fills my mind. As I listen to the cuckoo's soft and gende call, The authentic guru's voice, grave and sonorous, Comes to mind. Then I could hear his deep, melodious vmce; Now I cannot. Thinking and thinking of him, The guru's presence fills my mind.

Precious one-From your invisible realm Do you hear me, father? If so, from the pure Spacious sky of dharmakaya Now-this very moment-Appear in a form that I can see; Ease the desolation of your son! As I sang this plaintive song, the cloud con-tinued to swell until it took the form of a heap of jewels. At the top, in a tent of five-colored rain-bow lights, my root guru appeared. Performing a graceful dance, his hands in the gesture of protection, he was more resplendent than ever, peerless in loving-kindness [45b]. He smiled radiantly and spoke these words in a voice like Brahma's: Noble son, You who are like my heart, Do not despair; Listen to your father's words. We, father and son, who came together Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 55 By the power of past prayers, are inseparable In the state of the luminous absolute nature.

It is mind that remembers the guru; It is mind into which the guru dissolves. Remain in the uncontrived nature of mind, The dharmakaya.

I was singing 7he Inconceivable Arisen of Itself, the song on the view which Tilopa 19 used to teach the great pandit Naropa [46a]. While singing and remaining in a state of awareness of the absolute view, I noticed among the profusion of flowers spread out before me one particular flower waving gently on its long stem and giving out a sweet fragrance. As it swayed from side to side, I heard this song in the rustling of its petals: An offering! My father and mother are the sky and the earth; I am the child nurtured by warmth and moisture. See how beautifully I display my fme petals, Waving them in the ten directions! They are my offering to the Three Jewels. Listen to me, mountain dweller: The yogin for whom all phenomena appear as scriptures Is satisfied with the book of the phenomenal world. You, so-called \"hermit,\" collecting all sorts of scribbling, Stagger under the weight Of your load of worn-out books. If these books and instructions Are not present within your own mind, Why should you carry such a burden of writings? When you roam around the mountains To whom can you complain of the hardships you endure? I don't want to hurt your feelings, But, in fact, you even lack awareness Of impermanence and death, Let alone any realization of emptiness. For those with such awareness, Outer phenomena all teach impermanence and death. I, the flower, will now give you, the yogin, A bit ofhelpful advice On death and on impermanence. A flower born in a meadow, I enjoy perfect happiness With my brightly colored petals in full bloom. Surrounded by an eager cloud ofbees, I dance gaily, swaying gently with the wind. When a fine rain falls, My petals wrap around me [46b]; When the sun shines I open like a smile. Right now I look well enough, But I won't last long, Not at all. Unwelcome frost will dull these vivid colors, Till turning brown, I wither. Thinking of this, I am disturbed. later still, winds-Violent, merciless-Will tear me apart Until I tum to dust.

Surrounded by a host of disciples, You enjoy a fme complexion, Your body of flesh and blood is full oflife.

Just thinking about it, Aren't you seized with fear? Since you, mountain-roaming hermit, And I, a mountain-born flower, Are mountain friends, I have offered you These words of good advice. Then the flower fell silent and remained still. In reply, I sang: 0 brilliant, exquisite flower, Your discourse on impermanence Is wonderful indeed. But what shall the two of us do? [47a]. Is there nothing that can be done? The flower replied: I make this offering, An offering to the infallible Three Jewels. We two must now do as I say. Among all the activities of samsara There is not one that is lasting. Whatever is born will die; Whatever is joined will come apart; Whatever is gathered will disperse; Whatever is high will fall. Having considered this, I resolve not to be attached To these lush meadows. Even now, in the full glory of my display, Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 57 Even as my petals unfold in splendor, I pray that I may swiftly go and meet The temple of the ThreeJewels.

One night I dreamed of a child, completely white, radiating light an arm's length in all directions. He was so resplendent that I could not take my eyes off him. He stood on a rock in front of me. With his right hand he held his secret vajra and with a smile he spoke to me these words: Your body, the perfect jewel vase, Is filled with the nectar of pure great bliss. By the power of the vase initiation, May benefit for others increase [ 4 7b]. As he spoke, white nectar flowing from his secret vajra fell on my head and entered my body, gradually filling it in a vivid, perceptible way. Eventually, except for the hair and nails, my whole body was filled, and I experienced the taste of great bliss. With a symbolic gesture of his left hand, the youth pointed toward the sky and said, looking up into space: Natural awareness is the all-pervading absolute expanse."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"58 1he Life of Shabkar Natural clarity is like the vastness of the sky. By my bestowing upon you the initiation Of the wisdom that is naturally arisen, May your aspirations be naturally fulfilled. I remained effortlessly in a state of evenness as vast as the sky, beyond words. The youth then rose slowly higher and higher into the eastern sky and disappeared. Such was my dream. Another night I dreamed that, while seated cross-legged, I held my breath as in a vase and flew high into the sky until I reached the level of the sun and moon. There I saw celestial cities on the sun in the east and on the moon in the west. Looking in all directions, I saw the vast architec-ture of the universe and its various sceneries. Then I tried to descend but could not, be-cause an ascending wind held me aloft; I continued floating where I was. Just then, from amidst the clouds, a young celestial being emerged, visible from the waist up, and said, \"To descend, unfold your legs, free your breath, spread your limbs, and fly, like a bird\" [48a]. Doing so, I flew down with ease and came to rest on the top of the mountain behind Tseshung. I thought these and other good dreams meant that I would travel the path in this very life. One day, one of my benefactors came and said that divinations and astrological calculations indicated that an evil charm had been placed in his home, but he could not fmd out what it was. He urged me to do a divination. I remained evenly in the natural state for a while, and, within this sky-like evenness, I looked to see what the cursed object might be. I saw that under a large wooden case of butter was an old offering lamp with a short stand and a broken rim. Curious as to its origin, I saw that it had been taken out of a pond by the lady of the house five years before, and because of this, she was suffering recurrent difficulties with her right hand. All these images arose clearly in my mind. As I related this to my patron, his faith grew stronger and he said, \"Grant us your protec-tion-though you keep it hidden, you have unimpeded prescience.\" Saying this, he left. Thereafter, when people insisted on having me perform a divination, I was able, after remaining for a while in equanimity, to know the good and the bad of things. Thinking that such prescience might prove quite presumptuous and unreliable, and realizing that all this might invite disturbances and create obstacles to my practice, I later kept silent about such matters and claimed to know nothing [ 48b]. About that time an epidemic broke out and decimated the cattle population. Two patrons living in the vicinity asked for my protection. So, every morning and evening I visualized the pro-tective tent of my yidam and throughout the day I visualized the luminosity ofTrekcho and Thogal permeating the entire place. As things turned out, the cattle of that area were spared, and the two patrons, filled with joy, offered me much assistance. One day a poor Mongolian vagabond turned up. Rilling through my provision bags, he set about stealing one of them. At that very moment I said: Thief, you have come! Wonderful! We'll see ifi, the mountain dweller, ·The so-called \"renunciate,\" Can behave in keeping with my name. Let's see if I have really understood The main point of the Dharma. We'll make some tea and drink it together. If you live far away, stay here for the night. Let's discuss both worldly and spiritual things. Then I shall give you whatever I have. Accordingly, the thief and I boiled some tea, and as we were drinking it he 2Sked, ''Where is your native land? In which monastery do you"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"live? Do you have any family at home? What is your name?\" I answered with these words: My native land is all lands, In no particular direction. My monastery is the solitary mountains, In no particular place. My family is all the beings of the six realms. My name is \"Hermit Protected by the Three Jewels.\" At this playful reply, the thiefburst out laugh-ing and said, \"lama, you are a gifted speaker\" [ 49a]. Then, having given him what little I had, I sang: I pray to you, father, King of Dharma! Grant your blessings That my mind may remain free from attachment! Open your ears, thief, and listen carefully. I see everything as illusion. Having neither accumulated wealth nor craved it, I have never owned illusory possessions. Beyond what you see, I have neither food nor riches. See for yourselfl Now, if you don't know me I shall tell you frankly-! was born in Rekong Shohong; As to my father, I am a disciple of the King ofDharma, Chogyal Wang. I am a practitioner of the Great Perfection; My name is Tsogdruk Rangdrol. Having meditated again and again On all beings as my parents, I am free of the duality of enemy and friend. Having found the sublime inner wealth, I am glad to give you whatever outer wealth, Food, and possessions you desire. Now,just relax and be content. Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 59 On the occasion of this virtuous action, I dedicate all merit accumulated in the past, And all to be accumulated in the future, So that you and all beings May achieve supreme Buddhahood-Such is the way of the Bodhisattvas. Content, the man did three prostrations, wished me good-bye, and went on his way. Another day, on my way to Urgeh, one of my Dharma brothers said, \"Hey! You're supposed to be in retreat in your cave. Have you come out?\" In response, to explain my tradition for doing retreat, I playfully spoke these words [ 49b]: I bow down at the feet of the peerless guru, Protector of beings, whose mind is one With that of Samantabhadra. Fortunate friend, Listen without distraction. For the yogin of the most secret Great Perfection There is no leaving of retreat, Neither is there any entering. In the simplicity that is beyond concepts, There is no crossing of boundaries. With all this formal entering and leaving One cannot really be called a retreatant. My way of doing retreat is this: In the retreat hut that is my own body Endowed with the six characteristics, 20 With the three pure vows 21 I sweep away the dirt-negative actions of the three doors; In the stream of the four initiations, I wash away all defilements. Seated on my cushion-The fundamental consciousness, Coarse and subtle thoughts-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"60 The Life of Shabkar I, the yogin of awareness That is itselfbrilliant and cognizant Remain in the retreat That is the uncontrived natural state. Freed from discursive thoughts, Staying within the limits Of naturally abiding meditation, Fearing visitors-mental dullness and wildness-! mark my retreat boundaries With the poles of undistracted mindfulness. My retreat helper is emptiness: Through which whatever arises Is freed as it appears. As for my way of practicing the development stage: In the immeasurable palace Of primordial purity arisen of itself, The universe and beings arise As a display of deities, apparent yet unreal. Since all sounds are the resonance of voidness, Recitation is never interrupted; Thoughts that are set free just as they arise Are the utter openness of dharmakaya. I offer all food and drink As a feast-offering, a gathering of merit. To the mouth of the birthless absolute state. Whether walking, sitting, or sleeping, To blend all actions with contemplation Is the Mantrayana seal [50a]. Just as no darkness exists in the center of the sun, To a yogin the universe and beings all arise as deities-And the yogin is content. Just as no ordinary stones exist on an island of gold, To a yogin all sounds resound as mantras-And the yogin is content. Just as a bird flying through a clear, empty sky Leaves no trace, To a yogin all thoughts arise as dharmakaya-And the yogin is content. In the vastness of awareness, Without any separation into sessions of practice, For a yogin, practice is relaxed and at ease--And the yogin is content. In the indivisible state in which, from the beginning, Development and completion are indissociable, One may do practice, or leave everything just as it is. Even if one does intensive practice, There is nothing to be done. Beyond the workings of mind, I realize that phenomena are the dharmakaya. You, my friend, should realize this too. Not putting your trust in intellectual teachings, Master the meaning of the great evenness that has no origin. As for the duration of such a retreat: When, at death, the net of the body is fmally torn apart, And one is freed in the clear light of the dharmakaya, One could call that \"taking down the boundaries of one's retreat.\" The virtuous practice of such lifelong retreat,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Beyond fixed periods, Was the way of great yogins of the past.

I gave him a straight answer at first, then, teasing him, I sang these verses just as they came into my mind: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King. You, friend, listen to the words of the yogm: I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Have not worked in the fields of this life; Again and again, I have worked in the fields that are lasting. I have not sown the seeds of samsara; Again and again, I have sown the seeds of liberation; I have not plowed ordinary fields back and forth; Again and again, I have plowed through attachment to cyclic existence; In the pristine field of the nature of mind I uprooted the weeds of the obscuring passiOns. In the vast sky of primordially pure dharmakaya The southern clouds of the lineage gurus gathered; The turquoise dragon of my fervent prayer rumbled; Red lightning-the hook of compassion-flashed; Retreat at the Hermit's Cave 61 And the nectar-rain ofblessings fell to the earth. Having harnessed the oxen of pure perception and devotion, I set in motion the plow of the guru's instructions. The farmhand, fierce endeavor, Plowed the field of study and reflection. Cultivating the crops of the ten white virtues, I cleared away the rocks and stones of wrong thoughts And sowed the seeds of the Great Perfection. Once more, harnessing the ox of perseverance, I took the harrow of meditation And tilled with undistracted mindfulness. With the mallet-the pith instructions-! broke up the clods of obstacles and deviations. When the seedlings of experience and realization emerged, The women of the farm-unwavering vigilance-Cleared away the gross and subde weeds of mental dullness and wildness. As the green blades of uncontrived compassiOn And the sprouts of unwavering concentra-tion flourished The spontaneous crop ofbenefit for self and others ripened. If you have to till the soil, do it like this. If you have to plow a field, do it like this [51 a]. If you have to sow a seed, do it like this. This is how I, the renunciate yogin, Have grown the crops ofliberation. Another time, a layman said, \"The people ofRekong are exceedingly cruel. When you were in your homeland, did you fight with any enemies?\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"62 The Life ojShabkar In reply, after giving him a simple answer, I sang this spontaneous song: I bow at the feet of the Dharma King.

As I, the renunciate, \"Kind One Who Spreads the Dharma,\" Headed toward the city ofliberation On the path of the supreme Dharma, My archenemy, ego-clinging, Gathered the armies of the eighty thousand passions And raised the black-and-white banner of the eight worldly dharmas. As they all were about to barricade the road, I jumped on the horse of renunciation, Donned the armor of Bodhicitta, And seized the long lance of the perfect VIeW. Taking the Three Jewels as my allies and Without a backward glance at this life, From the high ground of my mountain retreat I galloped into the midst Of the army of negative emotions. Moistening my hands with the spit of vigilant mindfulness, I raised the sharp spear-Freedom from mental dullness and wildness-Pierced the heart of the general, ego-cling-mg, And liberated all my foes into the absolute nature. I enjoyed the illusory show of void appearances. And gained total confidence in the undeceiving law of causation. My allies, the undeceiving Three jewels Granted me a reward-happiness in this life and the next-And hailed me as an undisputed hero; Thus the yogin won the battle [51 b]. As I sang, the layman, although he didn't quite understand the meaning, felt happy for a while. Notes I. Thayenchi (known as rtse gz}zung in Tibetan) is a mountain retreat in Bakhog area (ba klwg), near Chuzang Monastery (chu bz.ang dgon).

The seven-point posture of Vairocana (mam snang chos bdun): I) The legs should be crossed in the Vajrasana posture, the right one over the left. 2) The hands, closed into fist, with the thumb pressing the base of the fourth finger, are placed on the thighs at the juncture with the pelvis, and the elbows are then locked straight. (Two variations of this are to place the hands palms up, right over left, on the lap, with elbows bent out to the sides, or to place both hands palms down, relaxed, on the knees). 3) The shoulders should be raised and rolled slightly forward. 4) The abdomen should be pushed forward. 5) The spine should be kept straight, \"like a pile of golden coins. 6) The chin should be tucked in slightly. 7) The eyes should be kept without blinking, unwaveringly focused at a distance of twelve fingers' breadth ahead of the tip of the nose. See Shechen Gyaltsap's kun mkhyen ;:}za/.lung, pp. 41-42. 3. This refers to the hundred-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva. The five steps described in this para-graph are those of the preliminaries (sngon ~o) which · lay the foundation for the main practice (dngos gzht). The main practice goes through the two stages of development (bslged rim) and completion (rtkogs rim), to culminate in the Great Perfection (rtkogs pa chen po)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"4.

The \"far-reaching lasso\" (rgyang z:Jwgs) is the eye, which can \"catch\" distant objects. The eye is also called the \"water lamp\" (chu'i sgron rna). These and the following terms used in this song are related to the secret Thogal practice and belong to the sec-tion of extraordinary instructions (man ngag sde) of Ati yoga (see Appendix I). 8. Dharmata (chos 7!Jid), the absolute nature. At this stage, both ordinary phenomena and the visions experienced in the former stages dissolve in the abso-lute nature. 9. The three kayas (skugsum) are the dharmakaya (chos ~i sku), or absolute body; the sambhogakaya (longs spyod ~i sku), or body of enjoyment; and the nirmanakaya (sprul sku), or manifested body. They correspond respectively to the void, the luminous, and the compassionate aspects of a Buddha. 10. Bardo (bar do), \"intermediate\" or \"transition\" state, commonly refers to the transitional state between death and the next rebirth. One also speaks of six bardos: the bardos of birth and life (s~e gnas rang bz/tingyi bar do), of meditative concentration (bsamgtan gyi bar do), of the dream state (rmi lam gyi bar do), of the moment of death ('chi kha'i bar do), of the absolute nature (chos 7!Jid bar do), and of taking a new existence (srid pa'i bar do). 11 . This means that when a realized person dies, his or her consciousness will merge directly (zang thal) with the dharmakaya. Thus, for this person there is no bardo. 12.

The r angti Nagpo, or the Single Golden Syllable of the Block Qyintessence {yang ti nag po gser gyi 'bru gcig). This cycle of teachings belongs to the most esoteric section (yang ti) of Ati Yoga. It involves practices focused on the Hundred Peaceful and Wrathful Deities and deal-ing with the stages of the Great Perfection, with some pith instructions for the practice of meditation in complete darkness. The later Dungtso Repa (dung mtsho ras pa phyi ma; see G. Smith [1972], GC, vol. 2, pp. 784-86, TN,pp. 518-19, and YangtiNagpo, vol. 3, p. 267), a disciple of the famed dakini Kunga Bum (kun dga' bum), found this tenna in a tortoise-shaped rock near the Lake of the Black Mandala (mtsho mandai nagpo), also known as Kala Dungtso (ka Ia dung mtsho). The latter lies across the Kashong Pass (kha shong Ia; see Fletcher 1975, and Huber 1992) near Gampo. The \"later\" Dungtso Repa is thus called for being the immediate reembodiment of the \"earlier\" Dungtso Repa (dungmtsho ras pasnga ma, 1267-1329?, see GC, vol. 3, pp. 30-31 and TN, pp. 515-16), who also revealed a !erma (the sems klzrid yid bdzin nor bu) from the Lake of the Black Mandala. Although the above sources concur consistently, there is a certain amount of confusion between the two Dungtso Repas, since in ND, p. l44b, for instance, Kunzang Ngedon Long Yang attributes the discovery of the Yangti Nagpo to the frrst Dungtso Repa, and so do other historians who based their works on ND (for in-stance, BD, vol. 3, p. 424).

Later, after passing through the great mon-astery at Labrang T ashikhyil, which is like another U-Tsang,4 he went on to the Golden Valley of Rekong. There, in the solitude of the heights of Tashikhyil, a place predicted by deities and gurus, he concentrated on practice for many years. In this way, he produced immeasurable benefit for the Dharma and for all sentient beings. The details can be found in his biography. I packed up my small tent and supplies, put them on my back, and set out on the road. I soon came upon a man who asked where I was from and where I was-going. I first an-swered him directly, and then I spontaneously sang a song: I'm called \"Child ofWhite Sriow Lioness.\" To begin with, I was fed with milk from my lioness mother. Later, I was fed with foods of various kinds. Now, the three strengths have reached perfection in my form:5 The lion's great turquoise mane bristles through his parents' kindness.

I'm called \"Child of Garuda, King of Birds.\" To begin with, I was nurtured with warmth from my bird-queen mother. Later, I was fed with foods of various kinds. Now, my great wings are spread out in strength; The garuda soars in space through his parents' kindness. I don't stay in one place now, But go wandering across azure heavens. The garuda's domain is the vast skies [57b]. I'm called \"Child of Dharma King.\" To begin with, I was accepted and given instructions. Later, I went into mountain retreat."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Now, meditation experiences, realization, and good qualities have been brought forth in me. The strength to be a wandering practitioner Comes through my master's kindness. I don't stay in one place now, But go wandering across high plateaus. The renunciate's home is wild solitudes. I went on to Tsang Monastery, where a monk kindly gave me a place to stay, and I paused there for a week or so .. I was reading the biographies of the eighty-four rn.ahosiddhas (which, among other books, belonged to a certain Kusho Tsangpa), when this occurred to me: \"Most of these siddhas attained realization by persevering in a few profound practices of development and completion. If I can devote myself entirely to practice, I won't need a lot of different teachings.\" My intention to prac-tice was strengthened by reading these biog-raphies. One day, I went to see Kusho Galgor. I asked for and received from him the transmis-sion of Opening the Door to Mind Training. 6 I also met Kusho Tsamgor, and received the trans-mission for the mani and for Aiming at Loving-kindness. 7 Following that, I went to seejamyang Adzi, a hermit who lived on the mountain behind Tsang Monastery, and I stayed with him for several days. I asked him for the trans-mission of the biography ofjetsun Milarepa, the collected songs of Lord Kalden Gyatso, the Thirty-Sevenfold Practice of a Bodhisattva, 8 and the Seven!J Admonitions. 9 He granted this re-quest and also gave me much good advice. When it was time to leave, I offered him my best wishes and set off for the retreat place at Takmo Dzong, Tigress Fort [58a]. At T akmo Dzong, there were two rock caves. Inside the smaller of the two, I spread out some hay as a mat and stayed there. The next night, I was in a state halfway between waking and sleeping when I heard a roar like that of an earthquake. Tiny lights shim-Meditation at Tigress Fort 71 mered like stars in the space around me. A shiver ran from my head to my toes; my body felt weightless, light as fleece. My skin tingled, and a pounding sensation filled my whole body. The noises and lights got louder and louder, brighter and brighter. I remembered that a certain Lama Parinpa was said to have practiced black magic in this cave, and I figured the trouble probably came from that. I was thinking, \"Maybe I should in-voke Vajrapani,\" and just then I realized, \"I haven't given up clinging to this ego of mine at all! To say, 'Eat me, drink me!' just once is better than saying 'Protect me, save me!' a hundred times! Without really putting an end to the belief that phenomena are real, what's the point of practicing Dharma?\" I then did a thorough visualization of Chod, and fell asleep in an empty and clear state like the sky, like the dharmadhatu, 10 the true condition of all things. In a vivid dream, having left behind my body, my awareness appeared as Vajrayogini. With the hooked knife in her right hand, she carved up my body, which was lying senseless on the ground. She cut off my head and the top of my body, and gave it to a black man, an old lama, and a woman, who devoured it raven-ously. Curious as to the taste of human flesh, I considered eating it, and put some in my mouth [58b]. Then I thought, \"To eat one's own flesh must be very inauspicious!\" I took it out of my mouth, and threw it on the ground. The black man grabbed it in an instant and ate it up. Seeing how hungry they were, I proceeded to carve up the rest of my body and feed it piece by piece to the three of them, until they disap-peared, satisfied and pleased. From that night on, the upheavals in the cave did not recur. I thought, \"Once one relin-quishes regarding phenomena as real, gods and demons will not only stop making trouble, they will be pleased and helpful.\" Later, the monk Thogme from Gartse11 asked me if the cave was pleasant. In reply, I sang a spontaneous song describing its many good qualities:"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"72 771£ Lift of Shabkar Mind-emanation of the Buddhas of the three times, Father, Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo, I supplicate you without ceasing. Grant your blessings that this vagabond May be able to keep to mountain retreat. Making joy and inspiration arise, This solitary place, T akmo Dzong, and I are in complete accord. I'm of the mountains, my mind is there: Thus do I sing my song. \"Tigress Fort\" --stately and auspicious, A place where many great beings once stayed. A rocky crag without-within, a home. Its southern door is bathed in light, even in winter. Spring and fall-the air is cool; mind is clear. Water, wood for fires--everything I need is easily found; My perceptions here are always lofty and joyous [59a]. Above, in a sky without boundaries, Eagles circle, gliding. Celestial juniper trees ornament The cliff's back face; Their scent spices the air. Before me, six-legged honeybees hum, hovering over Wild flowers spread out across the meadow. From a stream's clear water rushing over stones Come continuous murmurings. Wild animals bask on the slopes, Frisking, gamboling; they saunter or stroll about. In the deep green forest, from the highest branches, Various birds chatter and sing. Rain clouds hang overhead like great canopies. From clouds swirled like scattered white silks And patterned with perfect rainbows Summer rain falls in a fme mist. The guardians of this place Are on the Dharma's side: Anything wanted is right here. There are no villages nearby, no temples, no nmse: Everything is slow and serene. Through the lama's blessing, And by the grace of the place itself, Meditation experiences and realization Arise easily in one's mind-stream. I, a renunciate of these mountains, Call out the clear tones of my song. How wondrous if all those who practice, With minds turned toward the Dharma, Had the support of a place like this! To sing like this-Go into the mountains! By this merit, may all those practicing the teachings Make use of solitary places for retreat, And may they become fully perfected. One day, in a joyful state of mind, I sang a small song called the Union of the Sun and Moon of Con-tentment I bow down at the feet of the authentic master. I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, The renunciate who practices the Dharma, am singing a song:"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The union of the sun and moon of contentinent. When I relinquished concern for the usual activities of samsara [59b], There arose a sun-a mind filled with weariness and revulsion. There arose a moon-a real desire for Dharma These were contentinent's first sun and moon. When I searched for the refuge of the Dharma and for a master, There arose a sun-the Dharma, the profound path of Dzogchen. Th~re arose a moon-the Dharma King, lord protector. These were contentinent's second sun and moon. When I stayed at the feet of the lord protector, There arose a sun-the perception ofhim as the actual Buddha, There arose a moon-a mind filled with changeless faith. These were contentinent's third sun and moon. When I practiced in remote retreats, There arose a sun-unceasing compassion for sentient beings, Each one of whom was once my own mother. There arose a moon--excellent meditation experiences and excellent realization. These were contentinent's fourth sun and moon. This small song of the union of the sun and moon of contentinent, I've sung to lighten my mind. By this merit, may all sentient beings, Each one of whom has been my mother, Be content at all times and in all circumstances. Meditation at Tigress Fort 73 One day, when I was thinking about my elderly mother, I felt such a strong wish to see her again that I sang this song: Most kind master, Treasury of all good qualities, I supplicate you. Grant your blessings that attachment, confusion, and taking things as real May be severed at their root. You, renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Listen well, without distraction! When you are still yearning for home, What's the point of having gone off to the mountains? When your attachments aren't like pure, empty space, What's the point of calling yourself \"renunciate\"? When you're not making good use of your free, well-favored birth, What's the point of having obtained a human body? When you still don't behave so as to be free of regret at the time of death, What's the point of knowing that death will come? When you're still not giving up evil and doing what is good [60a], What's the point of having understood the law of karma? When you've still not renounced samsara and its ways, What's the point of having understood its imperfections? When you're not taking refuge with all your heart, What's the point of doing it just with your tongue?"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"7 4 Th Lift of Shabkar When you're still not doing as your master says, What's the point of all those polite yeses?

When you still can't truly regard all beings as once having been your mother, What's the point of keeping this life's mother in mind? · When you still haven't realized samsara and nirvana's single flavor, What's the point of going back to see your mother again? When your thoughts aren't arising as dharmakaya, What's the point of merely suppressing them? When you can't meet face to face beyond \"coming'' or \"going\" In the homeland that is the view \"one taste,\" Just to meet your mother in person is pointless, And might make problems-so forget it! The way to meet your mother in the absolute state Is to practice through mixing your mind and her mind With that of all sentient beings, And all these with the mind of your master. Having thus chided myself, I thought, \"I am confused. Didn't I come to this solitary place because I wanted to attain enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, each one of whom has been my mother?\" Thinking about my own mother, an overwhelming sense of compassion arose in me toward all suffering sentient beings. Mterward, I gave my new tent to a crippled old woman who lived outside Tsang Monastery [60b]. She sold the tent for sixteen lengths of cotton; with half of that, she bought tea to offer to the monastic community. I gave my new long sheepskin coat to a beggar, who traded it for six lengths of cloth, and then bought tea, butter, and tsampa. He was later seen doing prostrations, circumambulating the monastery. I fed a flock of magpies and crows with much of my food. Mter this, I made prayers that all sentient beings might swiftly attain Buddhahood, and that they and the teachings might benefit greatly. Then I began to practice. At sunset one day I heard a male and a female crow, cawing and jabbering at each other, and I wondered what they were saying. I said to my-self, \"If you're such a good singer, try making a song of their conversation!\" The male crow said this: Ah!Ah! Now it's just the time to go: The sun has disappeared in the west. Let's go home to the forest, To our tree's high branch; Going to rest, Let's make our way back home. I spoke to the crows: You! Crows who live in the forest!

Not to know your own home is ludicrous."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The male crow looked miffed, and, rufiling his feathers, replied: Caw! Old monk, what are you talking about?

Since you don't know about your real, Lasting home, I'll tell you-But then you must keep it in mind. This is not home. Home is The realm of Samantabhadra. Just after birth, Some old lady relative called Ignorance Put mother Samantabhadri's child On the horse ofkarma and kleshas:12 Thus was the child brought into Samsara's triple realm. There's no place that we haven't gone, There's no body in which we haven't been born. It's really sad that you, homeless pair of crows, Don't understand where home is! The male crow replied: Heh! Heh! You talk and talk, you homeless beggar, But you just make me laugh. If you're so smart, Homeless beggar, you'll Probably go back to that \"home\" soon, But why should we? I said to him: Listen, you skeptical crow: Many spiritual friends told me That this is not my real home, and At that time I begged them Meditation at Tigress Fort 7 5 To show me the way. I made offerings Of my thoughts and deeds, With pure perception, my palms Joined in devotion toward The guide on the path-the authentic lama. My master showed the direct path, Dzogchen. He placed me on the excellent steed of oral instructions, And put in my hand a whip to enhance my practice. I used the spur of joyful diligence, And rode along the path to liberation. Because of the steed's good breeding [61b], I reached Samantabhadra's realm, The permanent homeland, quickly and easily. Meeting the mother, Samantabhadri, I felt joy beyond duality. In the primordially pure dharmakaya kingdom, I, the child Inherent Awareness, Seized the royal throne of changeless samadhi. With seven noble riches I filled my treasury.13 Luminosity became my most beautiful queen, Whom I accompany with nonattachment. Through the joy and contentment that is naturally present, I have captured the permanent kingdom. What do you think, crow? The crow replied: Hey, if that's true, Then you are amazing! Still, comparing my home to yours, Mine is better! Sweet wife, let's go! With a profusion of caws and jabberings, off they flew. As they flew, the female, looking a bit despondent, spoke to the male:"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"76 Th£ Life ofShabkar It certainly is amazing that this great meditator Who lives inside a cave Has discovered his permanent home.

This masterless, servantless man Is simply shooting his mouth off Because his belly is full of food: There's nothing amazing about that! We two are far more amazing! Hearing this put her mind at ease, and they flew further away. I made up this song just to refresh my mind [62a]. One day, when I went to the spring, I saw that hundreds of winged insects had fallen into a pool of water. Some were already dead, and others, still alive, were struggling on the water's surface. Seeing this, I felt so sorry for them that I lifted many of them to safety with a spoon, to let them dry their wings and fly again. I broke open the pool's dam and let the water escape. Then I made this prayer of aspiration: As I have carried onto dry land These poor insects who fell into this pool, So may I save all beings from the sea of samsara And establish them in Buddhahood. I stayed in the sacred place ofT akmo Dzong for about four months, and, because there were no people coming and going, I made some progress in my practice. I then left for a pilgrimage to Amnye Getho, 14 the seat of my kind root master,Jamyang Gyatso Rinpoche. On the way, I frrst reached Ragya Monastery, where I met Shingsa Lobzang Dargye, 15 from whom I received a reading trans-mission and instructions on taking refuge in the Three Jewels. He kindly gave me detailed expla-nations on the general path, which were of great benefit to me. I also met T rigen Rinpoche, the elder holder of the throne ofTharshul; from him I received reading transmissions for both Th£ Blissfol Path and The Swift Path.16 I saw Lama Jampa Trinley Rabgye, holder of the throne of Arik; at my request, he gave me generous amounts of tea and butter. I crossed the Machu River on a boat and arrived at the mountainside of Amnye Getho [62b]. I stayed for over a month at the seat of Jamyang Gyatso. There I found an old hermit who was reading the collected works ofTsong-khapa and his two spiritual sons. 17 I looked at the works of these precious masters and, by merely reading through them quickly, gained much un-derstanding. Later, when I had time to study them in detail, I understood their prime impor-tance among all the elegant expositions that clarify the sutra and tantra teachings. Karmapa Kunkhyen Chokyi Trakpa18 wrote: Once, the seal of the Dharma Was in the hands of the learned and accomplished Sakya masters. Mter that, the learned one known as Lobzang Trakpa Clarified the doctrines of sutra and mantra. And as I thought this statement quite true, pure perception and devotion increased in me. While I was staying at Amnye Getho, some Mongolian beggar women of W<:lgasu came, asking if anyone had tsampa to trade for some top-quality sweet-roots. I gladly traded with them, and pleased them by adding some extra tsampa. One day a Mongolian layman told me he was ill, and asked me to do a mo 19 for him. I said to him, \"I don't make divinations. Your sickness is temporary and not life-threat~ning, but you"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"are unaware that you've caught a much worse disease. If you want a divination for that, I'll do it.\" So I sang for him, with a stately melody, The DWination Metlwd According to the Buddha's Words: Bowing down at the feet of the Dharma King, I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Now make the unerring divination In accord with the Buddha's words. First, I invoke the truth of the rare, supreme ones: To the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, To the guru, Cleva, dakini, I entrust this divination With fervent supplication [63a]. This man has been struck down Continuously throughout his past lives In the house of samsara's triple realm, And has suffered from the diseases Of karma and of the obscuring emotions. First, the cause; Second, the symptoms; Last, whether his life can be saved If he quickly does the rituals that protect And ward off danger: I trust in you, precious ones, To give a clear answer to these questions. I lay out the divination mat of the Buddha's words Right in the palm of my hand. I throw the dice of clear vision And perform the divination of insight ... Alas! This mo augurs nothing good. First, you are sick from having eaten The putrid food of ignorance and confusion. This stuff remains in the belly of your pure mind-essence, Creating pain from attachment to self And aversion toward others. Meditation at Tigress Fort 77 Your condition is aggravated by the five pmsons As the chief demonic forces, Reinforced by the eighty-four thousand different kinds oflesser harmful spirits. You've lost your appetite for the food of the holy Dharma. This has increased your pain and suffering, and the severity of your illness. You've thirsted for the water of evil deeds. These are the diseases and harmful spirits that afflict you. Sick one, It is certain you've not diagnosed these diseases; Harmful spirits and the obscuring emotions Have left you in anguish and complete delirium. However, if you quickly do the rituals for treatment and healing, There will be no danger to your life. If you don't quickly cast the protection spell of the holy Dharma Your serious illness will become grave And will sever liberation's life force. There is, therefore, a lot at stake. As to the procedures that can cure this disease: Attend the doctor, your spiritual friend [63b]; Offer him the gifts of virtuous thoughts and acts. To counteract the poisoned meat of igno-rance and confusion First apply learning, contemplation, and purification. As appropriate, then drink the excellent medicine of the oral instructions OfMadhyamika,Mahamudra,or Mahasandhi. 20 Without doubt, you will quickly be free of illness.

To counteract all other negative forces He should perform protecting and repel-ling rituals 23 of the ten virtuous deeds. At the end, he should perform the yidam practices Of emptiness and compassion as much as he can. If all these rituals are carried out, Your suffocation will cease, and You will be cured and freed of all illness. If these measures are not applied, Your disease will become more grave And you will collapse onto the deathbed Of samsara's triple world. With birth and death as your pillow And joy and sorrow as your cloak, The excruciating agony of aversion and attachment Will never give you a moment's rest. Because of all this, sick one, Wouldn't it be better To quickly apply the remedies Now, when you can still be cured? [64a]. By this merit, may all beings beneath the skies Make this \"Divination According to the Buddha's Word.\" May they depend on a spiritual friend as their doctor, May they drink the medicine of profound and perfect Dharma, May they cure the sickness of the passions. Mter I said this in a teasing way, the man was impressed and said, \"This divination according to the Buddha's word is truly excel-lent! Since I may die any time, please give me the transmission for the mani, and always remember me in your prayers.\" I gave him a blessing, the transmission he'd asked for, teachings on the general path, and explanations on the benefits of reciting the mani. I sang many songs to him, and thus turned his mind toward the Dharma With genuine respect and devotion growing in his heart, he went on his way home, chanting the mani. I started on a pilgrimage to the slopes of Lhanyen Gotse, where my supreme spiritual master, Arik Geshe Rinpoche, had done some meditation. On the way, I crossed the Machu River at Getho. Near Ragya Monastery, I saw an old Mongolian woman lying in a hollow. The muscles on one side of her body had atrophied, leaving her crippled. Her right wrist was infected, and the stench of the pus and blood that oozed from it could be smelled from far away. Seeing this woman, who had nothing to eat or drink, I felt great compassion. I begged food from the monks at the monastery, and, having gotten enough for a month or so, I put it by the old woman's head, and prayed [64b]:"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Compassionate guru, Compassionate Three Jewels, Regard this old woman With compassionate eyes. There is not a single being Who has not been my mother-It's so sad to see this poor old woman! Now, when she's suffering, There are no friends or relatives to help her. Now, when she's hungry, There's no food for her to eat. Dampness wells up from the ground below; Rain, unwelcome, pours down from above. Her body, stricken with illness, Has no nourishment. She is penniless. She can't move even if she wishes to. Surrounded by the smell of her pus and blood, There isn't one person to look after her. She hovers between life and death On a bed soiled with piss and shit. Seeing this, my eyes fill with tears. When I said this, the old woman also started to cry. She asked me, ''Where are you from? Where are you going?\" and continued, \"I had a dear son who died. Your coming here is like meeting him again; it's as if he came back from death.\" Remembering her son, she wept for a long time; tears came to my eyes as well. I told her a little about myself, and she said, \"Please, protect me in this life, the next, and in the bardn.\" I gave her a blessed pill containing relics of the Buddha that had multiplied miraculously, the Bodhicitta from Orgyen and consort-the mere taste of which brings liberation-and other precious substances. Explaining to her the miser-ies of samsara, birth, and death, I did phowa 25 for her, and offered this prayer on her behalf to the protector Amitabha and his retinue: Meditation at Tigress Fort 79 Amitabha-Buddha, lord of limitless light, Avalokiteshvara-sovereign of the uni-verse, V ajrapani-possessor of great power: Cast your compassionate gaze day and night Upon this old woman who relies on me. Protectors and your heirs: At the time of her death, accompany her joyfully [65a] And guide her to your realm of boundless happiness, The western Pure Realm of Great Bliss. Having made this prayer, I said, \"Now, old woman, continually pray to the protector Amitabha and his retinue, visualizing them viv-idly on the crown of your head, and at the moment of death your consciousness will be led to the western Pure Realms of Great Bliss.\" Two days after I left her, the old lady died. On the slope ofLhanyen Gotse, where the glori-ous and excellent Gyaltsen Oser,26 \"Radiant Banner of Victory,\" an incomparable spiritual master, had once practiced, I spread out some hay and sat down. One night, after I had been there a week, a piercing pain ran three times from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. I began to chant strongly the syllable hung with a thorough visual-ization of \"annihilating phenomena and self\" according to the special preliminaries of the Great Perfection. 27 After I did that, nothing else happened I dreamed that night that many spirits met, and one of them said, \"He seems to be neither Buddhist nor Bonpo-it's hard to tell what he is; we've never had anyone at his level of realization staying here before. Tonight I tried to find out, but when he said 'Hung!

After this, I didn't have a single bad dream [65b]. Over the course of a month, my practice progressed and, especially, great compassion toward sentient beings arose in me. I constantly made prayers that I, in this life, could benefit sentient beings, my mothers in previous lives. Then, I received a message from Chogyal Rinpoche, which said, \"Don't go to another place. Chodpa28 has built many pleasant retreat huts in the secluded grove of Tseshung. Go soon-you can stay in any one of the huts.\" On my way, I spent a day at the entrance to a cave in a rocky place to the right of Lhanyen Gotse. That night, I had a vision of many monks and lay people arriving, led by a yellow-hat priest who said, \"Hey, old monk! Don't sit on our path!\" They all waited. The yellow-hat priest said, 'Well, since he won't go when he's told to, let's teach him a lesson!\" · Suddenly, two black men came with a big bag of charcoal, which they poured on the ground. They heaped up the charcoal and put a bellows to the right and to the left. Between the bellows they placed a cauldron as big as a man, and heated it till it was red-hot. Both men stood up then and said, \"If you're such a good Bud-dhist monk, sit in there!\" They started to beat the top of the cauldron, screaming war cries, and making a noise that sounded like the cracks of thunder in a summer storm. Splashes of molten bronze flew in all directions, splattering over the entire valley. I rested evenly in the natural state. When I looked again, the cauldron had become smaller and smaller and the molten bronze was splash-ing less and less [66a]. Finally, out of love and compassion, I sang this song for them: I ask that the most kind master Transform adverse conditions into helpful ones. You devas, demons, and obstacle-makers Who are gathered here, Listen a bit to this yogin's song. In the vast expanse of space, beyond center and fringe, Clouds that gather in the south Are the sky's adornments. If there's a little rain, So much the better. In the vast ocean, beyond increase or decrease, The waves that interweave there Are the sea's adornments. If the surf comes crashing, So much the better. On the mountains, which are immovable, The trees growing in thick forests Are the mountains' adornments. If the leaves rustle gently, So much the better. For a yogin like me Who has realized the natural state, The arrival of gods and demons Is just adornment for my practice. If you're a bit vicious, So much the better. It's wonderful that you've come today. Now put on an even better magic show! Please, stay here until daybreak, Destroying this old monk So that not one dust-particle remains. Having sung this, I rested evenly in the view. One of the men said, \"Don't say anything to that old monk! Let's get out ofhere!\" With much commotion, they left. This event enhanced my understanding of the view. The next morning, I got up early and went to beg some tea from two camps of nomads from Gartse who were staying in the lower valley. They called me inside and a.Sked where I had spent the night. I said that I'd stayed under the rock overhang at the entrance to Draknaphuk cave. One elderly patron said, \"That's not a place for anyone to stay! They say that two hermits once pitched a tent below that rock, and, at midnight, a fire came out of the side of the cliff [66b]. The next night the fire bum~d even higher. Finally, a demoness with a long iron beak came"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"and split the door of the tent. When she poked her beak in and looked around, one of the her-mits saw it and was terrified. \"At dawn, he told his friend, 'Let's get out of here! 'Ibis place is haunted!' The friend replied, 'No, it'll be fine,' and they stayed. \"At night, the frrst of the two hermits lit a butter-lamp and sat chanting the Milctsemaprayer. The demoness carne again and poked her iron beak through the back of the tent where the other hermit was sleeping. She struck him in his heart. He screamed once and died, without even having had time to wake up. The next morning, the other hermit ran away.\" The elderly patron then asked, \"Did a demoness like that disturb you?\" hold him what had happened; he was amazed and faith arose in him. He said, \"You are a truly realized being! I take refuge in you!\" He offered me some butter; then he escorted me out past the dogs, and I went on. On the road I met a young man from Gartse who asked me, \"Don't you have a horse?\" I replied, \"Oh, yes! I do!\" and I sang a song as if my bamboo walking stick were my horse: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King. When Buddha Shakyarnuni, sentient be-ings' only friend, Milarepa, lord of yogins, And the accomplished, learned beings of the past Went out to beg, They all had horses of excellent breed-And I have one of the same bloodline! [67a]. This horse is caparisoned with sashes of five-colored silk! On its head-a golden halter! On its back-a rug, and a gold-studded saddle cinched with an iron ring! Below, its hooves are shod well with iron. Meditation at Tigress Fort 81 Steering my horse with my right hand I wander at will from wilderness to wilderness, My horse never tires--even after months and years! No matter where I leave it, it's never stolen! My horse does much better than others in mud! Against a guard dog, it does best of all! Thus I sang, and he went away laughing. I arrived at Urgeh, where I met the precious Dharma King, Chogyal Rinpoche, and his con-sort. When I told them how I'd practiced and been attacked by gods and demons, Rinpoche was very pleased. He said, \"Dear son, you've done extremely well! By being able to raise the victory banner of practice, you overcame adverse conditions. From now on, no obstructing spirits or obstacles will be able to harm you.\" I rested for a few days. Every day I went to my master and asked questions on some uncer-tainties I had and on various difficult points of the sutras and tantras. He answered me at length, and thus the days passed. Then I went to the retreat place at Thayenchi where I visited my vajra brothers and Dharma friends; we had many joyous conversations. Fol-lowing the orders of the Chogyal Rinpoche, I gave them all the teachings and transmissions they asked for, and I sang some songs of realization. Mter I had given them the oral instructions, many of the retreatants stayed in their own huts in strict seclusion [67b], concentrating entirely on the practice of the Great Perfection. Thus, they gained confidence that they would actually be liberated in the bardo. I sealed myself in the cave with mud and practiced in complete darkness following the instructions of the Single Golden Syllable of the Black Qyintessence. I was amazed to see the visions and other signs described in the texts."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"82 1he Life of Shabkar One day, it rained lightly and rainbows appeared. High in the sky, eagles were flying; when the sun came out, I took a walk to the mountain peak behind Thayenchi and sang this song of praise to the retreat-place: Ema! This extraordinary wilderness! Here, where so many learned and accomplished lamas have stayed, The gathering-place of dakinis and dharmapalas, Is the place where I stay in solitude. Tseshung, this secluded mountain place: Above--a slow, soft rain drizzles down. F1ocks of eagles flying-north, south-Beaked mothers and their young Trying their wings-Rainbows vividly appear. Below me--the curved necks of geese, Glancing, and the Tsechu River flowing on, Sinuous. Behind them, deer dance on the slope Of a mountain whose peak penetrates space. On both sides, meadows blaze with wild flowers; Myriad bees whirl above them. In front, rocks ornament the mountain meadows; A cuckoo's cry fills me with sadness. Up and down the valley, cattle and sheep Owned by the faithful Dot the land. The young girls Watching over them are busy, Making up songs and plays and dances. Today I climbed behind [68a] This excellent retreat place, Looking down on such channing scenes From the mountain's summit. I raised my head, looking up, And saw the cloudless sky. I thought of absolute space, free from limits, The view of dharmadhatu. I then experienced a freedom Without center, without end-All biased views Completely abandoned. I lowered my head to look in front of me, And saw the sun of this world. I thought of meditation-Luminous and unobscured. I then experienced a nondual empty clarity. All meditations that focus the mind I completely abandoned. I turned my head, looking south, And saw a pattern of rainbows. ' I thought of all phenomena-At once both apparent and empty. I then experienced a natural clarity beyond duality. All nihilist and eternalist viewpoints Completely abandoned. Looking above, looking below, Looking in all directions, I saw the world and the beings in it-All reliant on space. I thought of fruition that is inherent and naturally present. I experienced a state beyond accepting or rejecting-Hope of results and fear of failure I completely abandoned. When I finished this song, I felt great joy. Another time, when relaxing in a place covered with flowers, I sang a song from the Hundred Ihousand Songs of Milarepa:"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Three Jewels, which are all refuges combined, Are contained within unfabricated awareness. In that state, supplications aren't needed. Without having to perform recitations, The yogin is content.

The assembly of dakinis who dispel obstacles and adverse circumstances Is contained within one's own innate nature; In that state there is no need to offer tormas.3o Leaving the six sense-consciousnesses in their natural condition, The yogin is content.

As I sang this, a small, beautiful, sweet-voiced bee flew by, saying: Listen, lucky young one! Don't brag, just pipe down! If appearances are really your books, yogm, Meditation at Tigress Fort 83 Make a song about me and what I do! That will show if you really can read Appearances like books! In reply, I sang: All right, listen here, you lovely bee! Your body's small; your buzz is loud. My experience is feeble, but I have a big mouth, So you and I have much in common. Taking your unreal bee body as a meta-phor, I'll make a song about you and what you do. I, the renunciate yogin-as-bee, Have a body: primordially pure awareness. I've two full-grown wings: skillful means and insight. I'm striped with the experience of luminosity. I stand on six feet: the six paramitas. From meditation experiences and realization, I've grown the antennae of good qualities. I've eyes that discriminate between What to accept and what to reject. Sometimes I visit my patrons, the flowers, and From the jewel-vase of my throat Flow precious songs of realization Sweet as a bee's hum. The patron-flowers' faith blooms fresh and bright: Kriowing just how to take the nectar of food and clothing [69a],31 · I do not impair the freshness of their faith.

When Lakha Tulku's house was being built, a Dharma friend asked me, \"Do you know how to pound walls for a meditation hut?\" I said that I did, and for fun I sang this song: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King! Listen well to this short tale Of how a yogin who renounced all worldly activities Performed the ultimate wall-pounding! My perfect root guru Tamed the earth of my stubborn mind By taking up the antelope hom33 of the profound instructions. Diligence--the good laborer-Piled up the earth-wholesome virtue--On the level ground that is virtuous thought. My gracious root guru moistened this earth With the water of the four empowerments. The foreman--self-existing awareness-Drew the wall-lines of steady calmness, Set the wall-forms of the Great Perfection, And fixed the rods of changeless primordial purity. He bound these with the ropes of undistracted mindfulness, And tightened them with wedges-clearing obstacles and enhancing practice [69b]. With a mallet-profound perseverance--Undistracted, he pounded the walls. 34 The tall earthen house is the view. The firm foundation is meditation. The tightly pounded walls are the action: When these three come together, there is an earthen house that lasts forever. A man once asked me, ''In your homeland, do people live in tents or in houses?\" I first gave him a straight answer, and then I sang this song on living in neither a tent nor a building, but a dwelling of light: At the feet ofChogyal Ngakyi Wangpo I make this supplication, with veneration. Grant your blessing that I achieve A dwelling-place oflight, The source of all the siddhis one could desire. In my homeland, the houses are made of wood. But I, who, carefree and content, Have left behind the things of this life, Do possess a house: A house of five-colored light That, of itself, arose. Worried that a house like those of my homeland would collapse, I put up an absolute, indestructible house, One that is free from fear. The young child, Fresh Awareness, is the woodworker; Various deluded appearances are the wood; By means of the sharp tool of insight, These are turned into Substanceless emptiness. Setting the house foundation is the view; Placing the pillar stone--the lamp called \"lasso cast into the distance\"·35 ' Raising the pillars-the lamp \"absolute expanse\"; Supporting the pillars-the lamp \"empty spheres\"; The covering roof-the various visions. The canopy--luminous emptiness free from taking things as real-Is the lamp called \"insight arisen ofitsel£\""},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"In the house that is naturally present luminosity Are set out the mandalas Of the peaceful and wrathful deities--Apparent, yet empty.

So, fortunate disciples, If you build, make a dwelling oflight. By this merit, may all fortunate disciples Put up the excellent Thogal mansion. Another Dharma friend said to me, \"It's very dirty in here; you should sweep and straighten up the place a bit, and put out some statues and offerings.\" I said to him, \"Following the words of my father-guru, I've already swept and straightened up, and I've made an excellent arrangement of images and offerings according to the tradition of the Great Perfection.\" I then sang this song: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King, The mind-emanation of the Buddhas of the three times. Through the blessings of the sublime guru, I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, A yogin of the Great Perfection, Have an inner shrine, not an outer one. Here is the way to make shrine-offerings That, like the sun, naturally arise In the shrine-room of the luminous Great Perfection. In my body, the shrine-room, The temple keeper called \"thoughts freed as they arise\" Meditation at Tigress Fort 85 Sweeps the dust of thoughts and obscuring emotions Into the unborn expanse of dharmakaya. In the state that is empty, luminous, And free from taking things as real, I set out the deities' images Of primordial purity and natural presence, Not made by hand, but arisen of themselves. On a shelf: stable calm-state meditation, [70b] I offer water for drinking: clear and empty primordial purity. I offer water for bathing: unchanging samadhi. I offer flowers: natural luminosity, free of clinging. I offer incense: the natural freedom of whatever arises. I offer a lamp: continuous practice throughout day and night. I offer perfume: spontaneous presence, free of clinging. I offer food: simultaneous appearance and emptiness. I offer music: unborn and empty sound. I offer a mandala: the various visions. When you set out images, set them out in this way. When you make offerings, make them like this. Most people have outer shrines; This yogin has an inner one. This is the kindness of the glorious guru. Vajra brothers, I am joyful and content. I don't know how to sew. Once, when one of my Mongolian disciples was mending my shawl, he said to me, \"You don't seem very good at sew-ing.

With the shears of study and contemplation, The tailor-all-accomplishing intelligence--Having realized the natural state of all things, Cut out a pattern from luminous Dzogchen brocade. Wearing the thimble of strength and perseverance, I passed the thread of unbroken diligence Through the needle's eye of the lama's instructions [71 a]. In the workshop of the primordially pure absolute space, By guiding the seam of the four lamps With the fingers of the postures and gazes, I made a brocade robe of radiant light Which I continually wear day and night. All you fortunate disciples; When you sew, make a garment of radiant light. To protect against the heat and cold of the obscuring emotions, This is the best clothing of all. Light to wear, extremely durable--It is the superior Dzogchen apparel, The summit of the nine vehicles. 37 By this merit, may all beings, Limitless as the sky, Wear the brocade of the four visions Of luminous Great Perfection To protect against the heat and chill Of the obscuring emotions. When I sang this song, the disciple's faith grew stronger. A man once asked me, \"Are you a doctor? Do you have medicines?\" I answered him with this spontaneous song: I bow down to my old father, the Dharma King. I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, the yogin, Have a supreme medicine to cure the five pmsons Stored within my breast: Dzogchen, the universal antidote, 38 And also many other medicines-The profound sutra and tantra teachings. Following my teacher's oral tradition, I perfected my skill at composing songs in verse. The young physician-awareness-With his voice as the golden spoon, Gives out as required the medicine--perfect advice. If you can drink it with the tongue of discernment, Drinking it from the white porcelain cup of devotion and true respect, It will cure the chronic disease of clinging to ego, And clear the disorders of wind, bile, and phlegm That are caused by the three poisons.

In a mountain wilderness retreat hut, I donned awesome attire-that of a renunciate. I recited a wrathful mantra-having no wants or needs-And dug a magic pit-steady inner calm.

I, the fellow called Self-liberation of the Six Senses, Took my stubborn mind as the paper And smoothed it with the stages of the path. I drew the three straight lines-Development stage, completion stage, and Great Perfection. Sitting on the porch of my retreat hut, I took a bamboo pen-practice and perseverance-And all day long I inscribed The golden letters of meditation experi-ences.

The incomparably kind Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo [76a], was considering installing his son, Tashijungne, \"Source of Auspiciousness,\" as regent, and going to live in a mountain retreat for the benefit of the Dharma and all beings. When he explained his reasons to his queen, ministers and subjects, they all pleaded: \"Precious Dharma King! We rely on you, as does everyone in the whole region, on both banks of the lake; you are our sole protector and refuge. If you retire to a mountain solitude, we will be without protection or refuge, like ants when the rock covering their nest is removed. How could you do such a thing? Especially now that you have grown older, it is hardly advisable that you go to live in seclusion.\" They objected so strongly that they prevented him from following his wish for solitude. Several ministers thought it was I who had talked him into retiring to the mountains. They complained to me, saying, \"Please don't tell our precious king to go into retreat! Have you no sympathy for his subjects?\" Despite my protesta-tions of innocence, they would not believe me, and threatened, 'just you wait!\" At this point I thought it better not to stay there much longer. The Dharma King himself seemed dis-pleased. I told him, \"You reached enlighten-ment innumerable aeons ago, and, since you consciously came here for the sake of beings in this dark age, you will benefit others no matter where you are. Even if you cannot go to an isolated retreat place, please continue your work 95 for the Dharma and all beings [76b]. Besides, if you go into retreat in the mountains, your queen, ministers and subjects will all blame me.\" For a while he said nothing. The next day, he began dictating the Torch of Wtrdom 7ha1 Dispels the Darkness of Ignorance, According to the Great Perftction, 1 which I had re-quested earlier. When he finished, he declared, \"Here is this old man's testament.\" With several similar comments he hinted that he was thinking of going to another Pure Realm. \"Please don't say that!\" I begged him, asking that he remain here a long time for the sake of his disciples. He replied, \"Wherever there is power, there is crime. Nonvirtue naturally follows the attain-ment of high rank. It is also said that 'after pleasure comes pain.' I have no attachment to the samsaric glories of this life. They appear tempo-rarily as pleasure, but lead inevitably to pain. \"Ever since my trip to central Tibet I have cultivated a completely even attitude in which gold is not more desirable than stone, and stone is not less pure than gold. Ever since I was small, I have longed to go into permanent retreat in the mountains, but because of my past karma and aspirations my life has unfolded differently. \"I have reached a mature age, and accord-ing to the predictions made by my tutelary deity and my guru, I have arrived at the limit of my lifetime. Of course, I would be glad to remain in this world a few more years, but why should the remainder of my life be long?\" Apart from this he made no great promises. Then, as if filling vases right up to their"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"96 The lift of Shabkar brims, he gave to Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche, Lakha Tulku [77a], myself, and many other disciples the transmission for the works ofLodrak, 2 the empowerments and transmission for the New Termas,3 and the cycle ofKilaya teachings, along with the permission-blessing for the protectors of these teachings. \"Now, you must not be lazy!\" he warned. He stressed the need for mastering fully the teach-ings of the Victorious Ones in general, and the old translation tradition of the mighty Victorious One, Padrnasambhava, in particular. He insisted on the importance of holding, preserving, and spreading these teachings. He gave all the books to Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche. In the intervals between the teachings, I offered several trans-missions of the New Termas to Lakha T ulku. One day, during a tea break, I told the Dharma King: \"Earlier, I intended to stay in your presence as long as you lived. But if! stay, others may create discord and I am afraid that the guru and consort might dismiss me from their hearts. \"At Thayenchi there are many retreatants now, and thus much distraction. As my only wish is to persevere in my practice, I shall go to some isolated place like Tsonying Island. \"Since, for the last five years, you have so graciously sustained me with food, clothing, and teachings, and I have received from you com-plete oral instructions, everything now depends on my meditation practice.\" The exalted Gyal Khenchen added on my behalf, \"It would be most kind if you granted permission to this mountain retreatant\" [77b]. The Dharma King replied, \"Retreatant, if you were to stay here it would benefit others, yet most people would not perceive this. Therefore, it would be better for you to go to Tsonying ·Island, and that would please me as well.\" Thus he gave his permission. Then he added, \"Yet, for a while longer, let us, master and disciple, stay together in retreat. During this time, we should clarify whatever questions you have, and we shall discuss both worldly and religious matters. I am an old man, and do not know how many years I have left. You are a homeless wanderer, and do not know where you will go next. Who knows if we shall meet again?\" We stayed together in retreat for a month and a hal£ During the tea breaks he gave the transmission of the songs of realization of Kunkhyen Longchen Rabjam, Jetsun Tara-natha,4 and other holy beings, as well as general advice. I listened and engraved it in my mind. Every evening, I did many prostrations and circumambulated his tent several hundred times. I prayed that I would meet him in all of my lives, and be able to see his face and hear his voice-in reality, in meditation experiences, and in dreams-whenever the need might arise. Noting that his hair and beard had become white, I thought, \"If! had met him when he was younger, how happy I would have been! Now, he has grown old and I am ready to go to Tsonying Island. From now on we will be sepa-rated by a great distance [78a], and, as birth and death are so unpredictable, who knows if we will meet again? Should he happen to pass away, to which Buddhafield will he go? I must ask him.\" Unable to think of anything else, I pleaded with him, \"In all my future lives, never leave me without the protection of your spiritual practice! Which Pure Realm are you considering, Rinpoche, for your future birth? Please tell me.\" He said: \"Oh, son! Pray without ever forget-ting me. I will keep you in my mind, and never forget you. Since it is not even possible for me to go into mountain retreat in the present, who knows if it will be possible for me to enter a Buddhafield in the future? Yet, in accordance with a prediction made by the glorious Sakya Dagchen Wangdu Nyingpo,5 I pray to be reborn in the Pure Realm of Heavenly Enjoyment.6 If my prayers are successful, I think I will go there for a while.\" Then I asked him, \"What should be my chief objective for the rest of my life? Please, tell me what I should do.\" \"Son, what's the use of a lot of talk? Keep in mind all I said before, when we had more time; everything is included in that.

The time to leave for Tsonying Island was draw-ing near. One day I went to see the mother, Abhe Rinpoche, Rigdzin Wangmo, \"Great Lady of Awareness,\" and explained in detail my rea-sons for going to the island: Ema! Divine Abhe, you who have been even more kind to me than my own mother! Having left behind my homeland, I came to stay near the Dharma King and you, his consort. When I met you, a joy arose in me like that of attaining the first bhumi. The Dharma King and you, his consort, Have cared for me as kindly as if I were your only son. Thank you, divine Abhe.

She expressed her fondness for me and told me to come back after three years. Then I went to see the precious Dharma King. Mter a few days, on the evening before I was to leave, I did many prostrations and circum-ambulations, went inside, and sat at his feet. He was digging through a big bag, normally used for medicine, and pulled out the money and white scarves that were inside. \"Tonight, now that no one is arourtd, I shall say farewell to my son!\" He then gave me nine sang of silver· and twenty white scarves-long ones and short ones-.-and told me, \"Take these, and buy provisions.\" I took them in my hands, but I kept only two white scarves for the sake of our auspicious con-nection, and offered the rest back to him saying, \"If I had any possessions, I would make a large offering to repay your kindness, but I don't have sufficient merit for that. So, of all the gifts you have given me I shall only accept a token, to make an auspicious connection. \"The life-stories of the sages tell how they received pith instructions from their gurus and then went into solitary retreat [80a]. Giving up all thoughts of this life, they continuously visual-ized their guru on the crowns of their heads, and kept his pith instructions in their hearts. They took with them into retreat nothing more than a staff and a small book to remind them of the teaching. There is no mention of them taking gold, silver or valuables. \"Following their worthy examples, giving up all concern for the affairs of this life, I will go to the mountains without any silver or gold. If you, Lord, want to give these away, great would be your compassion if you gave the old woman who lives near here-to whom you have often given generously-some money to buy a d;:.omo.\" \"Here,\" he said, giving me five sang for that purpose. The next morning he got up early and, while taking te~, said, \"So, renunciate, after drink-ing this tea you will be oft?\" \"Yes, master,\" I replied. He gave me the rest ofhis tea, and, when I had fmished drinking it, putting his right hand on my head he gave me his blessing and added, \"This is my last teaching, my last advice: By the blessings of the Victorious Ones of the ten directions, By the might of having perfected the two accumulations,"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"And by the inconceivable power of the immaculate dharmadhatu, May the aspirations of this fortunate dis-ciple be accomplished.

I thought, \"How can I know ifi will ever see my guru, my spiritual guide, again in this life? If, after today, I never see him again, what shall I do?\" I wept. Then, looking at his face, I offered this song of good wishes: Heart-emanation of the Buddhas of the three times, Protector ofbeings in this decadent age, farewell! Foretold by the great Orgyen, Lord of the transmissions of Dharma, farewell! You who dispel the darkness of ignorance, Shining torch, farewell! You who remove the pain of the obscuring emotions, Medicinal tree, farewell! At The Heart of the Lake 99 You who soothe the burning heat of the five poisons, Water-crystal moon, farewell! You who grant all wishes, Crown jewel, farewell! You who rescue beings from the ocean of suffering, Savior captain, farewell!

My lasting refuge in this and future lives, Gracious guru, farewell! I, your disciple who obey your every command, Ask that you always care for me as your own son! Again I touched my head to his feet, and then moved back a little. In this life and in other lives, Until I attain enlightenment, Never separating from him, May I be reborn at the feet of my glorious guru. While I recited this prayer, I choked with emo-tion, tears streaming down my face [81 a]. As he saw this, some tears came to Chogyal Rinpoche's eyes also and, moved, he took out a fme crystal suffused with rainbow-colored light that he treasured greatly. \"I give you this,\" he said, \"because, owing to your past aspirations and prayers, you are a true disciple.

Finally, resolving to go, I went to the tent of Abhe Rinpoche and of their retinue, wished them good health, and offered ceremonial scarves with these words: Crown jewel of all beings, Dharma Queen, farewell! Caring perfectly for all the subjects and attendants, Sovereign ofkindness and love, farewell! Your countenance is more beautiful than that of a goddess; You, who grant the splendor of every joy, farewell! Your kindness has been greater than a mother's, Abhe, may your health be strong. May you, princes, heirs to the kingdom, fare well May you ministers and subjects fare well. Thus, with unbearable regret, I left. Proceeding down the road, I kept turning my head to look back at Urgeh (8lb]. When it was fmally out of sight, I could not bring myself to continue, and turned to look again: there, bright and vivid, was the tent encampment of Urgeh. I longed to go back. Then I remembered that I had received all the pith instructions and there was no real need for me to return. Thinking that after staying a while at Tsonying Island I would be able to return to see the precious Dharma King, I prayed over and over that I might meet him in all of my lives. Again I found myself standing still, unable to go any farther. Finally, I proceeded on, with a heavy heart. I have never felt greater distress in my whole life. It was a sign that I would never see my guru agam. Filled with sadness, I arrived at Thayenchi, the retreat at Tseshung where I had stayed previ-ously. I remained there for several days with all my vajra friends with whom I shared pure samaya. I told Lakha Tulku, the Chod practitioner of Go, Jampel, Rigden, Dageh, and my vajra friends staying there: \"You have crossed the threshold of the Buddha's precious teaching, the source of all benefit and happiness. You have also benefited yourselves through listening, reflecting, and medi-tating. Now that spiritual experiences, realiza-tion, and qualities have blossomed in you, you must help others in a vast way, tirelessly, using the skillful means of the four ways of gathering disciples. Throughout this lifetime, make cease-less efforts to benefit others and yourselves.\" I then presented each of them with the symbolic gift of a white scarf, and we exchanged many affectionate words. On the morning of my departure, my friends gathered early to perform a vast incense smoke-offering (82a], to sound the cymbals, beat the great drum, and blow the copper horns and conch shells, so that auspicious connections would be created for my teachings to become famed throughout the ten directions. Then they accom-panied me a short distance to a spot where I addressed them: \"It has been many years since we first met and practiced the Dharma together. Now we must go our own ways and will be separated by great distances. Who knows whether we will meet again in this life? Our hold on life is tenuous; all things are impermanent. Consider this and be diligent in your practice. Maintain devotion to the guru, affection for your Dharma brothers and sisters, compassion for sentient beings, and an open, pure attitude toward all the teachings. \"From today on, if you look, you will not see me; if you listen, you will not hear me; I will have gone far away into the wilderness. Yet you should continue to practice, dedicate the merit, and pray for all of us to meet again, both in this life and later in the Pure Realms. Thus will we attain enlightenment together.\" Aku Rigden, Dageh, and most of my friends shed tears, and tears also gathered in my eyes."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Mter we had prayed to meet again and again, I told them to remain seated. Rising and leaning on my staff, I offered them this farewell song: On the high coral-tinted cliffs Young eagles live, nursed by their parents [82b]; Until we meet again, farewell! I, a young eagle, will now Spread my wings and fly away. In the forest of deep turquoise green Tiger cubs live, nursed by their mother. Until we meet again, farewell!

I am now leaving for the solitudes of Tsonying Island. I left them with great sadness. That day my escort and I traveled only a short distance and camped on the sunny side of the valley. Some faithful people had given us more trampa and butter than we could carry, so with most of the trampa we made tonnas, ganachakra feast offerings, and a variety of food offerings to the deities. We melted the butter, filled up a pan and its lid, a lamp and a pitcher, and, inserting many wicks, we offered them that evening as butter-lamps, making prayers to the guru and the 1bree Jewels. The next morning after awakening, I gave all that was left to my escort and to several beggars. Continuing my journey, I made my way through the monastery of Tsang to Yudok, and then to Gartse. To the old devoted ngolcpas Baleh, At The Heart of the Lake I 0 I Tamdrin, and other disciples and benefactors of that area, I gave teachings on relative truth, such as on cause and effect [83a], as well as on abso-lute truth, the profound teachings on the void nature of mind. They offered me horses, cattle, and goods, which I returned to them. When I went to the home of one of these devotees to bless his household, his wife asked if I missed my mother, my friends, and my homeland. I answered with this playful song of the \"ten forgotten things\": By the grace of the king ofDharma, Since I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Have made my home again and again On the safe ground of dharmakaya, My homeland has been naturally forgotten.

With intense devotion, they offered prostrations and circumambulations before returning home. While at Bheldo, I looked up Tsego, a wealthy Mongolian devotee about whom I had been told; he invited me to his home. After receiving his gracious and generous hospitality, I sang teachings to benefit everyone and tum their minds to the Dharma. The next morning, while I was chanting some auspicious verses, my host offered me a horse and red saddle bags, which I didn't accept. Not wanting me to leave his house empty-handed, he then offered me a deerskin bag filled with loose tea, as well as much butter and tsampa. So that I would not lose my way, he sent a man to accompany me to the banks of the Machu. Since this man was poor, I gave him most of my provisions and sent him back, keeping only what I could easily carry. When I arrived at Ngamong plateau, I saw that the camp fires of other travelers had set the grass afrre. Scattered over the plateau were per-haps a hundred fires, resembling hundreds of smoke-offerings [85a]. Curious, I walked around and discovered that these were anthills that had caught frre. Flames were consuming the ants; the ground was aglow with burning embers. Seeing this, I felt great compassion. There was no water on that vast plateau, but I stayed there for the whole day, doing everything I could to accumulate merit and purify obscurations-taking refuge, generating Bodhicitta, making the seven-branch offering, and so on. Visualizing a rain of purifying nectar, I prayed to the guru and the Three Jewels, \"May you guide these dying ants to the Pure Realms.\" In the evening, I sat with a straight back and clear awareness, and merged the minds of all the ants with my own mind. Then, merging my mind with the wisdom-mind of the guru and the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"104 The Life of Shabkar Victorious Ones of the three times, I remained in evenness in the wisdom-mind, the dharmakaya, the state that is like the sky. Thus, the karma, obscuring emotions, two veils, and habitual pat-terns of the ants were purified in the unborn absolute expanse. Just before dawn, arising from this vivid state of luminosity, I visualized the illusory Buddha-body of each dead ant, made of subtle prana-mind, arising in the form of the Great Compassionate One15 with one face and two hands, and glowing with the marks and signs. Then, just as I shouted, \"Phet!\" like flinging a stone into the midst of a hundred birds, I visualized that all the ants [85b], now trans-formed into deities, flew into the sky toward whichever Pure Realm they wished. I then dedi-cated the merit and said prayers. Reaching the riverside in the valley below the Old Hang-nga Mountain, I made some tea and sat there. I spent the next day crossing the mountain. That evening I was thirsty. I spotted the black yak-hair tent of some wealthy people; as I approached and asked for tea, a harsh female voice said, \"Don't come in-there's no tea!\" A more gentle male voice added, \"Wait over there. I'll bring you some.\" Mter a long time, he brought me a: small clay pot with a liquid that was not quite water and not quite tea, and a plate with a handful of tsampa, and a pat of butter the size of two butterfly wings. \"In our area, tsampa is quite scarce,\" he said, apologizing, \"and serving it in the evening is unheard of However, because you've come from far away, I've given you this. Please say some prayers for us and our animals.\" I could not help smiling and told the house-holder that I had taken a vow not to eat at night, so I wouldn't accept the tsampa, but would offer the prayers. I drank the tea and, after reciting a few prayers, I sang this loud enough for the householder to hear me: Great is the compassion of the Victorious Ones. Great is the power of the dharmapalas. Great is the stinginess of the rich. Great is the greed of the poor. Rare is a human body, complete with the freedoms and endowments. Rare is the practice of the holy Dharma by those who have gained such a body. Rare are the householders who make offer-ings to Dharma practitioners. Rare are their offerings ofbutter and tsampa. For me, a repa who looks like neither Bud-dhist nor Bon, 16 This householder, who is neither old nor young, Poured something that was neither tea nor water. All you who are neither gods nor demons Refrain from harming him! [86a]. My teasing must have hit home, because he went inside smiling, and came back with a size-able quantity of tea. \"Take this for your jour-ney,\" he said. Nearby was a poor man who, seeing how much tea I had been given, begged me for some. I took the deerskin bag full of the loose tea other householders had been giving me, turned it upside down, and poured all the tea into the poor man's container. \"If you give me all this,\" he said, \"your mountain retreat will be much more difficult.\" Taking out several handfuls of tea leaves, he insisted that I take them back, which I did. I could see he had nothing to wear but an old worn-out sheepskin, so I gave him my sleeve-less coat, made of fme new sheepskin, which was soft, light, and warm. In its place, I put on my old woolen coat. The beggar was moved with faith and began to offer me prostrations and obeisance. \"These days a Dharma practitioner with such compas-sion is rare. From now on, protect me and remember me always in your meditation,\" he said, with tears in his eyes. Observing my generosity, the householder and most of the other nomads in the vicinity were also moved, and requested some teachings to make an auspicious connection with me. I gave the transmission for reciting the mani man-tra and the Mi.ktsema prayer."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"\"To be poor in this life is the result of miser-liness in previous lives,\" I told them, \"and to be prosperous in this life is the result of generosity in previous lives. If you want to be happy in your future lives, you must untie the knot of avarice and cultivate pure virtuous actions--offerings, prostrations, circumambulations and recitations (86b]. Particularly, develop compassion for the poor and be generous.\" I then sang this song: Kind precious guru, Look with compassion upon all beings. Untie the knot of avarice in the rich. Extend your love to the weary poor. Having failed to accumulate merit in previous lives, One is born destitute in this life. If one again fails to accumulate merit, Again one will be reborn poor; Thus it is said. For the rest of this life Practice the Dharma, The source offuture happiness. Every being has been our parent. How sad to see them now destitute! The rich must not be mean; Rather, they should give generously to the poor. I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, In order to attain enlightenment For the sake of all weary beings, Have abandoned all futile activities And now depart to practice The essential, divine Dharma. I made my way to the monastery of Lama Gyalu Huthokthu, met the lama, and requested teachings. He gave me the transmission for the mani mantra, the Miktsema prayer, the Praises to Tara, and the dharani oflong life. He also gave me tea, butter, and tsampa. I took a little for my own needs and gave the rest back to him. After request-ing his spiritual protection, I went on my way. I encountered a poor Mongolian woman and her son, and gave them a long white scarf At The Heart of the Lake 1 05 emblazoned with the four verses of auspicious-ness that begin, \"May all be auspicious in the day. May all be auspicious in the night ... \" I advised them to trade it for some food so that the boy could study Dharma, thus ensuring [87a] both of them, mother and son, happiness in this and future lives. They departed in a most cheer-ful mood. On the way to Wobu, I met a Bonpo and a layman from Rekong, who were returning home after herding cattle. They asked where I had come from and, on hearing my story, rejoiced at our having met. They asked for a teaching in order to establish an auspicious connection. I gave the transmission for the Swift Fu!fillment of Wzshes17 and a short teaching, ending with this song: Guru, remain always On the crown of my head As its ornament. Bless the mind-stream Of this faithful one. The one who roams the mountains For the sake ofDharma And the two from Rekong Who roam the mountains For the sake ofbusiness Have met on the plain ofWohu. This must be due to earlier aspirations. Do you intend to practice the Dharma? If you are thinking of doing so, consider this: Mter this teaching, we three will part And go our separate ways. Just so, all things are impermanent. Consider this and practice the divine Dharma. Praise, respect, and make offerings To the guru and the Three jewels; Help those who are suffering, And always do prostrations, Recitations and circumambulations. In this way you will be free of regret At the time of death."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"1 06 7he Life of Shabkar I will now go to the solitudes ofTsonying Island, I pray that you may return home content, That your lives be long and free from illness, And your future lives be happy. I gave them each a long white scarf Filled with faith, they left for their homeland. When I arrived at the south shore of Lake Kokonor, it was snowing heavily. Not a single yurt18 was in sight, my supplies were exhausted, and my boots were rubbing my feet raw [87b]. With great difficulty I reached the inhabited area of Arik, on the northeastern side of the lake. There I met an old man I knew called Dziri, who provided gracious hospitality; I stayed with him for two days. Wishing to add to my meager supplies, he filled a small bag with barley and rock salt, and added three pounds ofbutter on top. When I went to beg in other parts of the Arik District, I first came across a small, seem-ingly insignificant tent, which I passed by with-out stopping. I continued walking and came upon some more richly appointed tents. I felt sure I could obtain some provisions there. At the edge of that encampment were about fifteen Tibetan mastiffs; they charged at me like an army. I said to myself There is no way that these faithless, evil people Are going to call off their evil guard dogs. Listen, renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, What you need is the holy Dharma. For that you need this body; And, since this body needs food, You have had to come here. Now, these dogs are extremely vicious; They have their weapons in their mouths. Following their tan-colored leader, The pack of mastiffs surges and attacks! Gather ammunition-Stones and sticks! On this very meadow, Defeat the evil army of dogs! With that pronouncement, I put down my pack, gathered a few stones, and stood my ground as the dogs advanced. I threw one stone; most of the dogs either stopped in their tracks or fled. But \"Tan-head\" caught hold of my shawl and tore it, while a black dog clamped its jaws around the shaft of my boot. Feeling sorry even as I did it, I hit him with a stone. All the dogs then ran away [88a]. From inside the sheep pen, a man called out, \"Hey! What are you doing out there, making noise and stirring up the dogs? We don't take in travelers! Don't come into the sheepfold, fellow!\" The family gave me half a cup of tsampa, and I left, saying to myself Renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, You arrive at a rich man's door Confident of getting what you need, And an army of angry dogs attacks. Now that the old shawl you wear is tom to p1eces, You will be in danger tonight From the cold winter's wind. You'd better get going with a needle and thread! So I sat in a sheltered spot to sew up the rips in my shawl. I then went to beg at the door of the little yurt I had ignored earlier. An old Mongolian woman with very brown lips greeted me from within. She held back her dog, prostrated herself and, when I entered, presented me with a big plate of cheese and a measure of freshly churned butter. I was as happy as if she had given me a horse, and I said dedication prayers. I went to another small yurt, where a man gave me a plateful of tsampa. He apologized, saying, \"I don't have much, but there is a rich family at the end of the valley.\" As I approached that place, I was attacked by two dogs. Before they could bite me, I raised my staff at them"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"threateningly. Unfortunately, the staffhit against a rock and split in two. The family offered me a plate of tsampa and cheese, and I walked back, saying to myself: I ventured down this long valley For the sake of one plate of tsampa and cheese. Now, my staff, worth more to me than even a horse, is broken. This yogin is left with nothing but his own two legs [88b]. Carrying in each hand a piece of the staff, I continued on my way, laughing. Soon I came upon a group of people performing a ritual for a deceased relative; on receiving a plate of tsampa from them, I thought: The renunciate rushes on to a land of rituals. Even though he takes some abuse, He gets to take some food and drink and, Happily, no dogs have yet sunk their teeth into him. A monk at Ngari Monastery named Tendar had a dream in which he was told, \"The Indian Padampa Sangye 19 has arrived-you must go and meet him.\" He went and saw a brown-skinned yogin, hair knotted on top of his head and holding at his waist a golden wheel from which light radiated to people around him. As it shone upon Tendar, he felt bliss pervade his body. He asked the yogin, \"Please tum the Wheel of Dharma again.\" The yogin replied, \"I shall tum it once again in the future; then, you must come.\" The next day, when he met me, he remem-bered his dream. Feeling great fai.th, he asked me for a song of advice. I sang for him the one that Padampa had sung to Jetsun Mila. Later, he came to Tsonying to listen to the teachings and remained there for many years. Persevering in doing good, he became a fine practitioner. Then I went to the Upper and Lower Yangon Monastery, where each person gave me At The Heart of the Lake 1 07 a measure of tsampa. The year before, a fake hermit had come there and stolen a hundred coins from Zungshul Geshe [89a]. When I ar-rived, the kind bursar invited me for tea; while I was sitting there, a few monks came in and asked, \"Who's he?\" Joking, the bursar said, \"He's the hermit who robbed us last year.\" Everyone laughed. Then I went into the room of a monk, who shouted, \"We know how people like you have helped us in the past! Get out! Out! Out!\" Taking a few broken pieces of old, hard, yellow bread, rather than putting them in my hands, he threw them at me and, giving me a dark look, went off I stood there with a smile and, when leaving, quoted a saying: A man will run from a place Where a snake once bit him, Even though he sees a necklace Of gold and silver lying there. Once harmed by another's malice, A man will distrust even the holy. \"I don't blame him,\" I concluded. People from Arik asked me many times, \"Why do you keep your hair so long, coiled around the top of your head?\" I replied: At the feet of the gracious guru I bow down. Assembled sangha, listen: As to the hair I wear coiled on my head, The reason I keep it so long is this: I keep it so that When I forget the guru's kindness, I am reminded. I keep it so that When I wander to various places, I am protected against bandits and thieves."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"1 08 The Life of Shabkar I keep it so that When the cold wind of the new year comes, My ears are protected. I keep it so that When blinding snows fall day and night, My eyes are protected. I keep it so that When I go out begging [89b], I'm protected from the enemy, worldly distraction. I keep it so that When I wander over these vast plains, I don't fit in with other people. I keep it so that When I, wrongly, think in terms of this life's concerns, I remember the life of Milarepa. \"That makes sense,\" said one old monk. Later, as I was begging near Arik, another old man asked, \"Are you a Bonpo, or are you a yogin? What good is all that long hair? It must be tiring to carry it with you everywhere!\" I replied: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King. Keeping my hair like this Makes everyone doubt and mistrust me. If they have doubt, they have no faith. If they have no faith, I don't get offerings. Ifl don't get offerings, I'm not oppressed by possessions. If I'm not oppressed by possessions, My practice progresses. If my practice progresses, Experience and realization are born. If experience and realization are born, I can benefit others. Such are the reasons for wearing This long hair that benefits others. \"It seems to me a person like you doesn't need to beg like this,\" said a woman who was listening. \"Aren't you living this way because of a divina-tion or some astrological calculation?\"20 I answered: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King! I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Made this calculation for myself On the astrological chart-the Dharma of sutra and tantra, I calculated the cycle--the twelve causal links. I set down eight trigrams-the eight consc10usnesses, Surrounding it with nine diagrams-the nrneyanas. I then calculated friends and enemies-virtue and nonvirtue [90a]. This chart proved to be ill-starred. Disease arose like this: First came an offense to the nagas and local deities-deluded ignorant mind. Then, because of this offense,21 the protector-dharmadhatu wisdom-departed, And becaus_e he departed, The demon--clinging to the notion of reality-entered in its place. It is the nature of this demon To produce pain-attachment and aversiOn. Having diagnosed the problem, the chart described a cure: To bring back the protective deity, wisdom, The excellent realized guru Must effect a purification By introducing me to the nature of mind. To subjugate the demon, clinging to things as real, I must renounce my homeland, and, Relying on alms for my food and drink, Wander in the mountains from one soli-tary place to another."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"I must cultivate the supreme attitude That holds others dearer than myself, And preserve recognition of the true condition of all things: The view that one's \"self' and phenomena are essenceless. This is what the chart revealed. Once I embarked on the path prescribed, The protective deity of dharmadhatu wisdom returned. Once I was free of the demon, clinging to the notion of reality, The confusion of desire and anger for the most part subsided, Leaving just a small residue behind. They will never again Be as harmful as before. By the time I had fmished my speech, faith had begun to arise in the woman, who offered me some excellent tsampa. Thus I wandered on and on, begging until my feet, chewed and bruised by my boots, fmally became swollen and infected. Hungry, cold, and tired to the bone, I visited over a hundred fami-lies, each of whom donated a few bowls of tsampa. Altogether, I received one sack of flour, one skin bag of tsampa and one of barley, a quarter of a box of black tea, and nine measures of butter [90b]. On the third day of the first month of the Fire Tiger year, 22 having gotten together suffi-cient provisions, I arrived at the supreme place renowned as Tsonying Mahadeva, Heart of the Lake. It is an island found in the middle of Lake Trishok Gyalmo,23 the abode of Naga Bodhi-sattva, the naga king Anavatapta's minister. It is a natural gathering place of benevolent mamas and dakinis, and was blessed by many holy beings in the past. I thought of my great good fortune in being able to stay in such a place, and, in my joy, sang this song: I bow down at the feet of my father, the Dharma King; Grant your blessing that this lowly one May keep to mountain retreat. At The Heart of the Lake 1 09 I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Have left behind my native country. I have given up my loving friends and relatives completely. Relinquishing all desire for a retinue and servants, I have always served the authentic root guru with great care, With pure intention and pure action. I've received from him empowerments, Teachings, pith instructions, and advice. Fallowing the advice of the glorious guru, I have come to Tsonying Island. In the beginning of the year, through his blessings, I arrived safely to practice the Dharma. Encountering neither obstacles nor hardship. I've found a place to stay and everything I need. Singing a spontaneous song of joy, Dancing, my body at ease, There is such great bliss! There is such great wonder! The realm of the absolute nature Is filled with delights! As I explored the sacred place, I met Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche, \"Sun of the Doctrine,\" a rryungne 24 practitioner living on the hilltop. I explained to him in detail the reasons for my coming, which [91 a] pleased him. That particu-lar year he and his disciple were in short supply of tsampa and had only a box and a half of tea. So, we pooled our supplies and then divided them equally. I stayed alone in a cave facing east. One day Lobzang Dondrup, renunciate T endzin Nyirna's faithful and intelligent attendant, who was close to his master's heart, asked me to sing a"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"110 Th£ Life of Shabkar song in praise of the place. In response, I sang this: I bow down again and again At the lotus feet of the Dharma King. To all, according to their wishes, Even to students who are difficult to tame, He explains the Dharma of sutra and tantra. Have you never heard ofTsonying Mahadeva, The place unsullied by the eight worldly dharmas? Foretold in the prophecies Of Dharma King Songtsen Gampo, And of the Lake-hom Vajra,25 It has many splendid qualities. In the middle of wave-tossed Trishok Lake Stands an immovable mountain; In the wide-open, clear and empty sky above it Dawns the luminous mandala of the sun. In the morning the sun rises early; At night, it sets late. Wherever one looks, There are good, solid caves to live in. There is a good supply of water and wood, And wild flowers bloom here in abundance [91b]. There is plenty of food-Wild garlic and other edible plants-To sustain the yogin's body. Around the bright flowers, Bees continuously hum their songs. The trees move with the wind, Leaves gently rustle. Small birds in their multicolored plumage Sing out all sorts of different songs. When a small breeze blows, Patterns appear on the water's stainless surface. The air rings with the quiet cries Of many waterfowl Nesting near this pure lake. Fish with golden eyes, searching for food, Swim gracefully through the water. Here one never sees thieves outside-neither men nor dogs. Nor is there ever a whisper of thieves inside--rats or other vermin. Around this lake filled with good fortune Are many rich householders who are full of faith. The local deities give help ceaselessly To all who practice the holy Dharma here. The yogin fond of the pleasures of touch Who stays at this infmitely wondrous lake Will find grass for a fme cushion. The yogin fond of the pleasures of sight Will fmd golden fish whose dances dazzle the eyes. The yogin fond of the pleasures of smell Will find the perfumes of a thousand flowers. The yogin fond of the pleasures oftaste Will fmd wild vegetables of exquisite flavor. The yogin fond of the pleasures of sound Will fmd the intermingled melodies of many kinds of birds. This solitary place, Complete with all the pleasures of the senses, Rivals the god-realm of desire. With so many excellent qualities, A solitary place such as this is rare. Recognizing the defects of the eight worldly concerns, Holy ones who practice Dharma should stay [92a]."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"All who follow the perfect lives of past masters Of the practice lineage Should stay, practicing, at this place. 1bis is a happy and blissful place for retreat; Those who wish for bliss and happiness should use it. By the merit of this praise, May all humans and animals here Be free from famine and disease. May the Dharma increase And may all be auspicious! That night I dreamed I came to a celestial mansion made of precious stones. Inside, on a jewel throne, was a beautiful woman adorned with silks and ornaments. She was seated like a queen and was surrounded by a multitude of young boys and girls. They were holding a great feast, sing-ing, dancing, and playing musical instruments. At one point the queen looked at me and smiled. Turning to a young servant girl, she said, \"Sing the praise that he sang yesterday.\" \"I don't remember it all,\" the girl said. \"Then sing as much as you can remember.\" The girl sang: This solitary place, Complete with all the pleasures of the senses, Rivals the god-realm of desire. With so many excellent qualities, A solitary place such as this is rare. Mter she had sung what little she could remember, everyone laughed, and the queen presented me with fruit, sugarcane, and a heap of other sweets [92b]. Having dreamed this, I thought, \"Wherever I stay, a song in praise of the place seems to be appreciated even more than the usual ritual offerings.\" During that year, except for some tea at noon, I didn't cook much.26 For eight months I main-tained silence and only practiced the least elabo-At The Heart of the Lake Ill rate practice, remaining evenly in the natural state of the Radiant Vajra Essence.27 While rest-ing in this state, various visions, such as mystical cities and Buddhafields, came into in my mind. I was quite joyful. The great masters of the past say: \"A yogin who has attained stability in calm-abiding and in insight meditation, and in both the development and completion stages, should train in the vari-ous modes of transformation28 if he wishes to give rise to the qualities of the stages of the path.\" Therefore, each day that summer I practiced different transformations such as these: From wisdom's own manifestation, which occurred when I was visualizing myself as the deity, an unsaddled white snow lioness appeared, which I mounted. Then, with Vajravarahi lead-ing the way, and the guardians of the four direc-tions each holding a paw of the lioness, I ascended into the sky. Sometimes I would ride in succession an elephant, a divine horse, a garuda, a dragon, the sun, and the moon, ascending higher and higher into space. Using my shawl as a pair of wings, I wheeled and soared from one peak to another across the lake. In the sky, I built a long staircase of crystal and beryl and climbed up to the celestial realms and then back down again. Imagining that all mountains and rocks were like rainbows, clearly visible yet insubstantial, I passed back and forth through them [93a]. Visu-alizing rocks as mud, I left handprints and foot-prints in them. I also kneaded rocks like dough and divided them into small lumps. Sometimes I visualized the upper half of my body as turbulent water, and the lower half as blazing fire-without the water extinguishing the fire. I turned my body inside out without any damage; I fluffed it up like wool, poured it like water, and transformed it into the wish-fulfilling gem, the excellent vase of great wealth, or. the wish-granting tree, raining down everything that beings might require. I visualized deities, transforming one into another, until the last one dissolved like a rain-bow in the sky. I then settled into a state beyond images, an emptiness like the sky."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"112 Th£ Life of Shabkar While I performed these and other prac-tices, some people with fortunate karma who lived by the lake saw above the island white lights, rainbow tents pitched in the sky, and many large birds hovering overhead. Various apparitions were reported by people who had visionary abilities. One, a shepherd, saw me flying from Tsonying Island in the direc-tion of Gonpo Dong-nga, the Five-faced Lion Protector. Another, a carpenter from Shabdrung Tsang, said that during the summer he had actually seen me in the Harawol Cave near the lake, and that I had told him not to cut down the sacred trees in that area. People expected storms that summer. When the thunder began, I did this protective concen-tration [93b]: first, I visualized my surroundings as a perfect Buddhafield, in the center of which the immeasurably vast, four-storeyed Mount Meru emerged, composed entirely of jewels and precious stones. On the top was a thousand-pronged iron vajra; its thousand lower prongs reached the solid gold ground below; the central knob rested at the level of the top plateau, and its upper thousand prongs projected into space. I then visualized myself as Vajrapani seated at the heart of the vajra, and above the topmost prongs I visualized a thousand-spoked golden wheel, resting horizontally. In the hub was seated the Buddha. On the spokes, seated in the de-fending and protecting posture, the 1,002 Bud-dhas of this fortunate aeon generated from their hearts a thousand white lions that appeared at the spoke-ends and roared fiercely in the ten directions. Terrified and silenced, the thunder-dragons withdrew and took flight. Several times, while I was concentrating on this visualization and recited the mantra ofVajra-pani, the thunder stopped completely, so I thought that my visualization practice was going quite well. In the fourth month a cuckoo carne. When I heard it singing clear and loud in the forest on the north side of the island, I had mixed feelings of joy and melancholy. Jetsun Nyungnepa,29 Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche, remarked, \"I have been here for ten years. Until today, not one single cuckoo has ever come. 'Ibis year you've arrived and so has this cuckoo. How wonderful!\" [94a]. It flew away after a single day's visit. In-trigued, I thought, \"That bird could have been the emanation of a Buddha, a Bodhisattva, or a spiritual teacher, and his song might have been the holy Dharma. You're supposed to be so good at composition-why not compose a teach-ing on what this bird might have taught?\" I came up with this: Yesterday's heaven-blue cuckoo sang something like this: Listen well, human who dwells here-cuckoo!

Lord, supreme being of this decadent age, Spiritual friend linked with me beyond time, You took ordination when you were young and kept pure discipline; You have attended many authentic gurus, You have heard many profound teachings of sutra and tantra, You have given up worldly concerns, which are so hard to abandon. Along with listening to and reflecting on the Dharma, You now absorb yourself in the actual practice, so hard to undertake. Please grant me whatever enlightened advice Arises in your wisdom-mind. As I thus tried to persuade him to sing, he pleaded, \"I've never tried singing before; at this moment, nothing will come.\" Again the next day I requested: Ema! Dear authentic heart-friend, There is an ocean of sutra and tantra teachings [96a]; Nonetheless, with the nectar of clear exposition That flows from the crystal vase that is your wisdom-mind, Please satisfy the thirst Of your friend who yearns to drink. Out of sheer kindness, he spoke: Ema! Dear intelligent mend, If you are eager to know about the view, I, a simpleton, Will tell a bit of what I've understood. If there's bias, that's not the view. If there's clinging to things as real, that's not the meditation. At The Heart of the Lake 115 If there's accepting and rej~cting, that's not the action. If there's hope and fear, that's not fruition. \"Then what is it?\" you may ask. The view is empty awareness, without any source. The meditation is empty clarity without any concepts, The action, like the path of a bird through the sky, is without any traces. Whatever arises is freed, just as it arises. The fruition is samsara and nirvana, Complete within mind itsel£ Does this suit you, dear friend? I replied: 0 precious supreme being, 0 heir to the Victorious Ones, From the crystal vase of your bliss-void wisdom mind Pours the nectar of clear exposition, Cleansing the wish-fulfilling gem of my mind Of the stains of ignorance and emotions. And this song, I think, might fulfill the needs of one and all. We also talked at length about Dharma; our minds mingled as one. I received from him the transmission of the Kadampa Teachings of Father and Son,31 the Five Stages of Guhyasamqja Accomplished In One Sitting written by Je Rinpoche, the Torch Illuminating the Five Stages, the T wenq-one Notes, 32 and the Nyu:ngne Ritual composed by Panchen Lobzang Chogyen and Changkya Rinpoche.33 From then on, I perceived him as one of my kindest gurus [96b]. Throughout that year, Jetsun Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche's attendant, Lobzang Dondrup, occasionally brought me goat's milk and curd; in the summer some vegetables were to be found. By the end of autumn, however, my supplies were exhausted, and for two months I was re-duced to eating only a thin soup of tsampa. Dur-ing this period I honed my patience and fortified my diligence; when I think back on it, I realize what fortunate times those really were."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"116 The Life of Shabkar When the lake was sufficiently frozen to walk on, I went down to the island's shore and found a Mongolian family called Bageh. With them was a package for me from the Dharma King, the queen, and their son. Inside were seven silver sang, a box of black tea, and a letter saying that they were all in good health. I felt as happy as if they had arrived in person. For the seven silver sang, the local fishermen sold me fifteen hundred live fish, which I set free. At the beginning of the following summer the immeasurably kind Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche came to Arik District. There, he praised me to the inhabitants of Arik and, adding that I was a person with a special destiny, he made pros-trations toward T sonying, where I was in retreat. He asked all residents of Arik, of both high and low standing, to help with my supplies. He himself sent me a box ofblack tea, some butter, a sweet cheese, a white woolen felt blanket, and a letter saying: Padmasambhava, Embodiment of the infinite Victorious Ones, You who look with great love on all the vast number ofbeings, You have manifested as the great nirmanakaya, Ngakyi Wangpo: With great faith, I take you as my crown-Buddha.

During this time, both the humble and the powerful of Arik came to invite me [98a], saying, \"Earlier we did not recognize you as a great hidden yogin; but after Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche told us about you last year, we greatly regret our disrespect. By all means you must come and visit us.\" Accordingly, I went to Arik, where the local lamas, the chieftains, monks and nuns, laypeople great and small, old and young, all came to meet me. I gave some basic Dharma teachings and the transmission for recitation of the mani man-tra, the Miktsema prayer and the Praises to Tara. Singing songs, I tried to inspire them to practice Dharma. Many gave up negative acts in favor of virtuous ones. In particular, each part of the district vowed to recite together a hundred million mani mantras every year; later I heard they had accumulated a hundred times that number. I established connections with all those who offered horses, gold, silver, and other valuables by making prayers and dedications, and then returning the gifts. Accepting the tea, butter, tsampa and cheese, I gathered a stock of provi-sions. The old lama who had thrown pieces of dry bread at me the previous year felt guilty, and, offering me some butter and cheese, expressed regret for his earlier distrust. I was also invited to"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"118 17ze Life of Shabkar the homes of some women who formerly had been barely hospitable, and to the homes of those who hadn't given anything at all.

Please be patient with us, and from now on [98b] keep us under your spiritual protection. May you live long! Next year you must come again and let us offer you our warmest hospitality.\" I promised to come and made some prayers for their good fortune. Everyone was delighted. I then went to meet Naktsang Tulku Rinpoche, a sage of great learning. He gave me the transmission for the biographies of Jetsun Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa and Rechungpa,37 the transmission for the Mind Training on Cutting All T zes of Attachment by Chen-ngawa, 38 and other teachings on mind training. Pleased by our con-versations, he gave me so many presents that on my way back a young man remarked that I should have a horse. At first, I gave him a simple answer, and then teasingly said, \"But I do have a horse!\" and sang this song: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma Kin I g. Though it may not be within everyone's reach I ride a horse that is free of birth and death. I ride a stallion, the foal of a barren mare: Unborn, all-pervading absolute space.39 I sit in a saddle made from rabbit horns: Without meditation, without tampering-Mind just as it occurs. I steer with reins made of tortoise hair: Free of all efforts to accept or reject. This horse, which neither comes nor goes, Canters along the plain of equanimity. Whoever rides this actionless dharmadhatu horse, Without coming or going, Will surely reach the land ofBuddhahood. Before returning to Tsonying Island I impro-vised this song for the chieftain Behu, the house-holder Datrak, and other male and female devotees: You, a lofty and solid rock-making one, I, an eagle who slept here cozily-making two; Our meeting and mutual understanding [99a] Have been excellent. May you, 0 lofty rock, remain content. This eagle cannot stay, but must leave, Soaring through the sky. I pray that I meet you again and again. May my prayer be fulfilled.

All you noble men and women gathered here, Give up evil acts; perform virtuous ones. Devoted patrons, Datrak, and others [99b], I have given you some heartfelt advice; May its merit benefit all. Reaching the lake's shore, my companions said, \"If snow hasn't fallen on the ice by tomor-row, the pack animals won't be able to cross.\" So I prayed to the guru and the Three Jewels, and made an offering of fragrant incense to Mother Trishok Gyalmo and others, exhorting them to act. In the evening heavy snow fell. In the morn-ing everyone was merry: riding on horseback, they could reach Tsonying Island easily. Mter circumambulating the sacred place, they returned home. When I had left Tsonying Island to beg in Arik, only a grass mat and some dried vegetables were left in my cave. When visiting pilgrims saw how few possessions I had, they felt faith and respect; some of them left butter and tsampa, with a note saying that they were an offering. One night, in a dream, I saw that my close disciple Perna Rangdrol had sent from my home-land Gedunjungne, a monk of the Tob family, to inquire about my well-being and present me with a large bag full of tea, a belt, a letter, and a white scarf. I told those who were staying on the island with me, \"Tomorrow someone from my homeland will be coming here.\" When it happened just as I had said, everyone's respect and devotion increased. I asked At The Heart of the Lake 119 the messenger for news; he told me that the lamas, Dharma friends, my mother, sisters, and others were all well, but that Aim Dorje Tseten had passed away. The monk had brought his bones to me. I felt heartbroken that my best childhood friend had died. For his sake, I did some practice to accumulate merit and to purify obscurations. Finally, mingling his mind with absolute mind, I rested in evenness [IOOa]. From his bones I molded tsa-tsas,40 and prayed he would take rebirth in a Pure Realm. I had an auspicious dream indicating that he had been liberated from samsara. In his letter, my close disciple Perna Rangdrol requested all the teachings I had been giving here. So, with the monk from the Tob family, I sent many songs I had written down for various worthy disciples and devoted householders, as well for my own edification. In particular, I sent him the Song of the View called 7he Flight qf the Garuda,41 with the sections on Thogal practice. I also sent a long letter of advice. Later I heard that when it reached them safely, they felt the same joy and devotion as if they had met me in person. I also sent letters in verse and prose to the Dharma King and his queen, and to Gyal Khenchen, who were pleased. That year I was able to offer my root teacher, Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche, and his disciple all the supplies they needed. I also gave empower-ment, instructions, and all sorts of material necessities to Tenpa Phende, Gelong Tendar, Gyupa Kukye of Arik, Rabjampa of Jigme Beh-la, Alak of Suneh, and the old lama from Shabdrung. Mter this, they all stayed in retreat, each in his own cave. I, too, that year, sealed off my cave with mud, and, maintaining silence, persevered constantly in meditation practice [IOOb]. On the night of the tenth day of the third month, I dreamed of a terrifying black man riding a blue horse. He declared that he had been sent by"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"120 The Life of Shabkar Pontsang, 42 and told me, \"Your sole and unfail-ing refuge in this and future lives, the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo, is about to depart for the distant land. Come quickly to see him.\" I got behind him on his horse, and, reaching Urgeh in an instant, I saw the Dharma King astride a blue horse decorated with jewels. He was surrounded by many young men and women in the full bloom of youth, who held aloft stan-dards and victory banners. The Dharma King had reached the foot of a high mountain to the southwest when I caught up with him. The precious Dharma King smiled, and said, \"It is good the protector called you. As I told you earlier, I am going to the Pure Realm of Celestial Enjoyment. Don't feel sad; I will come back soon for the sake of beings to be trained.\" Then he said: Empty and luminous sky beyond attachment, Remain here. I, the evening sun ablaze with light, Shall not remain. I shall set behind the western ridge, Soon to reappear Above the eastern mountains. Vast, unobstructing space, Remain here. I, the five-colored rainbow arc, Shall not remain. I shall disappear into the sky, Soon to reappear again From the very midst of space. Cool lake, clear and shimmering, Remain here. I, the waterfowl with a sweet song, Shall not remain [lOla]. I will fly off to a distant land, Soon to reappear again in spring. Disciple of unwavering faith, Remain here. I, the old man from the snow land of Tibet, Shall not remain. I will pass into the Buddhafield Celestial Enjoyment, Soon to reappear again as another incarnation. With these words, he began to climb; I touched his foot with my head and, with longing, uttered this lament: Just as in earlier times the teacher, Shakyamuni, Left his following of human and celestial beings, And went on to the Pure Realm of Akanishtha, Will you, too, leave us today, 0 second Buddha? Just as the Lotus-born, Padmakara, Who was beyond the sway of birth and death, Left behind the land of Tibet and his twenty-five disciples And went on to Cannibal Island in the southwest, Will you, too, leave us today, 0 second Lotus-born? Just as Milarepa, the king of yogins, Left behind his following of many repas And went on to the eastern Pure Realm of True Enjoyment, Will you, too, leave us today, 0 second Mila? Just as Lobzang Trakpa, Manjushri in person, Left behind his many fortunate disciples And went on to the Pure Realm of Tushita, Don't leave me today, 0 second Lobzang! When I sang these verses to him, he placed his hand on my head and said, ''It is not time for you to"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"go. Uniting your life and your sadhana, work for the benefit of the Dharma and sentient beings.\" Then he ascended a broad white path stretching up the mountain. When he and his disciples and retinue arrived at the top [1 01 b], an inconceivable host of dakas and dakinis emerged from the sky. A white, a yellow, a red, and a green dakini each held a leg of the guru's horse and miraculously lifted it into the sky, rising higher and higher. Those who had escorted him turned and went back. I stayed there motionless and sang this song of sadness: In the thirty-three-fold celestial realm, lndra, the lord of the gods, Leaves his throne and palace, Passing through space in comfort and ease. As he arrives at the pleasure grove, Great is the god's rejoicing. The illuminating sun That benefits all beings, Sets behind the western mountain peaks, Leaving in darkness the southern continent, Jambudvipa. As it arrives in the western continent, Great is people's rejoicing. The wish-fulfilling jewel That grants whatever one wishes Leaves the ocean island, Removed by a clever seafarer. As it becomes as an object of offering On the pinnacle of a victory banner, Great is people's rejoicing. The protector of beings of this dark age, The king of Dharma, Leaves me behind, unfortunate disciple, And proceeds along an immaculate white highway. As he arrives in the Pure Realm of Celestial Enjoyment, Great is people's rejoicing. In my dream, I began crying, and awoke to fmd my pillow wet with tears. I thought, \"I rarely At The Heart of the Lake 121 have dreams, not even good ones, and when I do, they rarely come true. Yet, I fear that such an ominous dream as this might really come true.\" I began to feel cold and uneasy inside. It later turned out that this dream coincided with the precious Dharma King's passing to the Pure Realm [1 02a]. This coincidence astonished the heart -sons when they heard of it and strength-ened their faith in the Dharma. In the summertime, in the fifth month, Ngawang Lobzang, the old Shabdrung lama staying in a cave facing north, fell ill. I heard about it and sent this letter: Listen, heart-son Who lives in accord with the Dharma: If your mirage-like body is unwell, Do all you can to protect it against disease and untimely death. If you do so and are still unwell, I shall come. We have come together in this place Because of links formed by previous actions and aspirations. When we are practicing the holy Dharma purely, If diseases and demons harmful to our lives anse, We must do all we can to avert untimely death. A few days after I had sent this letter, he became ill to the point of death.Jetsun Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche and I left our retreats and went to his cave. After performing a ransoming ritual,43 we did the \"chasing out of hindrances.\" A wind arose inside the cave and, rushing out through the cave opening, transformed into a black whirl-wind. Swirling across the surface of the lake, it disappeared in the distance, as everyone watched.

How amazing!\" Similarly, Rabjampa Kunga Gyaltsen from Jigme Behla was once ill; among other com-plaints he had heart trouble. He sent me this letter from his retreat: Wish-fulfilling gem, bestower of all happiness! Experienced guide on the path Leading to the realm of bliss! Father, embodiment of all Sugatas, Listen a little [I 02b], And tenderly consider your tormented son. In my search for happiness, I follow your instructions And stay in the seclusion Of a peaceful, joyous mountain retreat. Now, while practicing the holy Dharma, The source ofhappiness, I have experienced much suffering. In suffering or in happiness, You are my only hope. Gracious lama, bestower of all bliss, Never dismiss me from your blissful and luminous heart; Swiftly bestow the feast of happiness and jOy. I responded: Ema! Having purified yourself in previous lives, You now have good predispositions. From childhood, you have listened to And reflected on the wondrous Dharma. Now you try to practice accordingly, Without the least attachment to the taste of pleasures. Heart-son who is free from clinging and aversion, If your heart isn't well, Practice purely, and you will recover quickly. I who roam through mountains and valleys Will pray to the Three Jewels, the source of well-being. Heart-son, you have given up worldly activities And, for the sake of future lives, You practice the Dharma in remote mountain places. May the Buddhas of the three times, The yidoms, dakinis, and dharmapalas Who protect one as a mother does her child, Lovingly watch over you, my heart-son. May all obstacles and adverse circumstances Vanish like frost at sunrise. Praying so from the heart, Until the mighty Lord of Death arrives, May we all be free from obstacles and afflictions, And practice in solitude, Making our lives and practice one. I did practices to protect him, but his illness worsened (103a], and again I left my retreat. Mter giving him a long-life empowerment, according to the tradition of the Queen of Siddhas,44 I had a dream: some Chinese were about to kill a sheep and I forbade them to kill it, thus saving the sheep's life. From that very night Rabjampa was free from his illness. Then we all resumed our strict retreats. Again I sealed my entrance with mud and, taking a vow of silence, based my practice on the two Bodhicittas,45 the development and comple-tion stages of the Secret Mantrayana, and the T rekcho and Tho gal practices of the most secret Great Perfection. Day and night, I practiced one-pointedly. On the eighth day of the eighth month, during the midnight session, as I was meditating on great compassion for all sentient beings, our mothers, I thought, \"I am practicing to gain enlightenment for the sake of all beings, but since I lack perseverance, Buddhahood won't come about.\" Contemplating the sufferings of sentient beings, I felt unbearable sadness."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"I thought, \"I have no ability to relieve be-ings of their suffering. Then who does? Surely the noble Avalokiteshvara, the principal deity of Tibet.\" With yearning devotion, I recited the mani mantra, thinking, \"You are aware of the pain and happiness of all beings, each one of whom has been a mother to me.\" The cave grew lighter and lighter, until a white radiance pervaded everywhere. Before me in space, in an expanse of rainbow light, appeared the noble great compassionate one, Khasarpana. He had a pure white complexion and a peaceful smiling expression [I 03b]. His right hand was in the gesture of bestowal, his left hand held the stem of a white lotus. Adorned with silk scarves and jewel ornaments, he was resplendent with the marks and signs of a Tathagata. He sang: I, mighty Avalokiteshvara, principal deity of Tibet, Always watch over the world with eyes of compassion. You, fortunate one born in the central land, Tibet, And everyone who lives there should do this: Ngakpas should protect their samaya As they would protect their own eyes. Especially, they should not perform black magic or sacrifice animals. Monks should keep their vows properly, And, especially, should renounce alcohol and women. Householders should shun the ten nonvirtues, And, especially, should not quarrel, steal, fight, or kill. The rich should not be stingy, but give generously. Dharma-practitioners should not wander around In populated places, but stay in their retreats. Don't mistreat elderly parents; serve and respect them. At The Heart of the Lake 12 3 Don't beat farm animals and watchdogs; be kind to them. Make offerings to the guru and Three Jewels; siddhis will follow. Make prostrations and circumambulations; Negative acts and obscurations of the body will be purified. Recite scriptures and mantras; Obscurations of speech will be purified. Anything you do with a good heart will become Dharma. Please act accordingly, disciples of Tibet. In particular, everyone should pray to me; Young or old, they should recite The six-syllable mantra. I will always be present before those with faith. I have always led those with faith To the Buddhafield ofSukhavati. Follow what I have explained here, And at the time of death I shall appear in the bardo To guide you to Sukhavati or Mount Potala.46 Do not doubt this, my disciples. Having spoken thus, he disappeared [1 04a]. On other occasions, I frequently saw gurus and dei-ties in reality, in meditation experiences, and in dreams. At the end of autumn, at the request of some retreatants, Gyupa Kukye Rinpoche gave the transmission and explanation of the Great Gradual Path to Enlightenment, by Je Rinpoche. When the lake froze again in the winter, Tendzin Nyirna Rinpoche received some visi-tors who told him that my refuge and protector, the lord of the mandala endowed with the three kindnesses, the precious Dharma King, had passed on to another Buddhafield some months before. Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche came to see me. His face was sad. After just sitting silently with me for a while, he fmally said, 'Well, asjetsun Mila says:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"124 The Life of Shabkar Sometimes one feels the presence of the guru. When this feeling comes, Merge with his presence, Visualize him seated on the crown of your head, And pray. Never forgetting the guru, Visualize him in the center of your heart.

You must not let yourself become desolate with sadness: I have heard from a visitor that Chogyal Rinpoche, the precious Dharma King, has passed away into another Buddhafield.\" For a moment my mind went blank. Then, suddenly, the thought of my guru vividly surged in my mind, and my memory became ofhim so strong that I was overwhelmed, and began weeping. Tendzin Nyima took my hand and said: \"Don't let yourselfbe overcome by sorrow. Make offerings and prayers to your guru to fulfill his intentions. He merely displayed the passing of his physical form into nirvana in order to urge all of us who cling to permanence to practice Dharma. In reality, the guru knows no death, yet he must demonstrate impermanence and death [1 04b]. \"Now, to serve your guru, repay your par-ents' kindness, and benefit sentient beings, you should raise the victory banner of practice while staying in solitude. It is by doing so that you will fulfill your guru's wishes. \"Later, you will meet him in the Buddhafield of Celestial Enjoyment. Of course, you know all this; I am merely mentioning it as a reminder. Keep what I have said in mind.\" Then he left. After he had gone, the living memory of my teacher became so intense that I wept and wept, quite uncontrollably. Finally, I sang a song of lamentation: Kye-ma! Kye-hu! Kind lord! Just to hear your name gives birth to devotion. Just to see your face purifies all obscuration. Just to hear your voice brings blessings into one's being. Prostrating oneself to you and circumambulating you, One perfects the accumulation of merit. Instead of staying and Caring for your disciples, Where have you gone, protector, my refuge? Kye-hu!

May I always attend you; May I never part from you. On that day I felt a hopeless anguish-as if my heart had been tom from my chest. I prepared a vast feast-offering with both real and imagined offerings (I 05b]. I arranged the mandala of my tutelary deity, the Wzsh-:fo!fill-ing Gem, Hayagriva and Varahi, and received empowerment from the guru as inseparable from the main deity of the mandala. From then on, I made repeated prayers invoking the guru's com-passion, requesting his swift rebirth, and praying for the fulfillment of his enlightened intentions. One day, I went to the peak of the island and, facing in the direction my guru had lived, I sang this heartfelt song of sadness: Firmly rooted in true concern You extended in the ten directions The shade of benefit for others.

Guru, bountiful wish-granting cow, 52 you have now departed. Kye-hu! I, the nursing calf-disciple, ask: How can I drink the milk of pith instructions? As I sang my lament, remembering the guru and weeping, before me in the southern heavens a new white cloud surged up, higher and higher in the sky, like milk boiling over [1 06a]. Upon it, seated astride a white lion adorned with various precious stones, was seated my root guru, his body more radiant than ever, attired in silken scarves and adorned with jewel and bone orna-ments. He said: Without ever moving from the space of dharmakaya, My rupakaya display appears in many ways. 53 You, who pray to me with a melody of longing, My supreme son, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, listen to me: Son, 0 son, The human body is rare and easily lost. Surely, yes, surely, This will happen to you, Just as it has happened to me. Remember this! Over and over, in the past, I gave you teachings. Now do as I said, just as I said, And whatever you wish shall be accomplished. Saying so, he disappeared. Mter this, my griefbegan to ease. The admiration I had developed for Jetsun Tendzin Nyima Rinpoche's practice of sutra and tantra, and particularly for his practice of the development and completion stages of Secret Mantrayana, inspired this song: Aspiring to benefit yourself and others, You have served authentic teachers Through both thought and action. You received the empowerments and pith instructions Of the development and completion stages. Praying to develop the propensity for the two stages, With a mind deeply moved by faith and devotion, I join my palms above the crown of my head. Praying that my mind be imbued with both the sutras and tantras, May I become like you, 0 second Buddha [l06b]. I offered him this song and he was delighted. Thus, for two years we, father and son, stayed together. On an auspicious day in the first month of the New Year,just before he was about to depart on a pilgrimage to the Five-peaked Mountain in China, I offered him a vajra and bell, a woolen shawl, and a roll of fme silk as farewell presents. I then sang this song: Sole ornament of the southern continent, J ambudvipa, Sun~ high in the sky, may you fare well. Though you will move over the other three continents, I pray that soon I may see your face again."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Sole ornament of the River Ganges in the east, Golden-eyed fish, may you fare well.

Though now you will travel to distant horizons, I pray that soon I may see your face again. I offered this, and in return he gave me many presents and much advice. Just before he left, he presented me with a long white scarf, and said: Stay well, Jambudvipa, While the sun tours the four continents. For a short while we shall separate, But soon the sun and Jambudvipa will meet again. Stay well, Ganges, While the golden-eyed fish roams the ocean. For a short while we shall separate [l07a], But soon the golden-eyed fish and the Ganges will meet again. Stay well, tree, While the cuckoo travels to distant countries. For a short while we shall separate, But soon the cuckoo and tree will meet agam. Stay well, my son, While the old father visits the Five-peaked Mountain. At The Heart of the Lake 127 For a short while we shall separate, But soon we yogins, master and disciple, Will meet again. He then gave much advice and taught the Dharma to all the disciples and patrons as-sembled there, who had known him for a long time. Saddened that he was going so far away, many of them wept. The master crossed on the white-silk ice covering the crystalline lake, as if traveling over some celestial path, and then was gone. A few days later, his disciples lliarampa and Thubten Gyaltsen decided to accompany him to the Five-peaked Mountain and left as well. I remained, feeling a bit sad for a few days. Around this time the faithful old Shabdrung Lama, who lived in this holy place, said, \"Years of meditation must have developed your clair-voyant perceptions. Tomorrow I shall go and try to gather supplies for next year-will I obtain them or not? Will there be any hin-drances or obstacles? Can you make a clear prediction?\" \"What will happen to him?\" I thought [I 07b]. Resting my mind in evenness, I saw that he would get plenty of provisions; he would load two yaks borrowed from his home and from a neighbor, and return with them over the ice.] ust where one begins to see Tsonying Island, the ice would crack, and the two yaks would be unable to continue. At that moment, two patrons on horseback, coming from Arik to see me, would lend him their horses, enabling the old lama to bring his supplies across. This I saw as clearly as seeing a reflection in a mirror and I described it to him. When things happened exacdy as I had foretold, he devel-oped great faith in me, declaring, \"Whoever can make a prediction like that is someone in whom I will take refuge!\" Things like this happened a few times, and so, some people said, \"He doesn't talk about it, but he has unhindered higher perceptions.\" During this period, my young disciple from Arik, Tenpa Phende, was leaving for central Tibet to study. I gave him good advice and, as a farewell-present, sang this song:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"128 Th Life of Shabkar Gurus, victorious ones, and spiritual sons, Allofyou-Bless your devoted son.

Travel the roads with care. Son, when you reach central Tibet, Serve an excellent and authentic master With both your intentions and actions.

From now on, until enlightenment, Whenever we, father and son, wish to meet, Wherever we might be, May we quickly meet once more! In response, he asked for my spiritual protection, offering me butter, sweet cheese, a white scarf, and this song of wishing me well: Merciful lord, sovereign ofloving-kindness, You have treated me as a mother treats her beloved child.

There he studied logic for many years. Later, when I met him there, he had become an excellent geshe54 and rendered me good service. That year the incomparable Jampa Dao Rinpoche, protector of beings in the dark age, came to Tsonying Island. He was the heart-son of the greatly learned, glorious, and excellent spiritual master Jampa Gelek Gyaltsen. Having received and realized many teachings, Jampa Dao was endowed with great qualities. He gave the transmission of the graded path known as The Words-of Margushri. 55 Mter com-pleting it, he said, \"I hear that you can easily improvise songs-let's see. Sing a few verses for me.\" I sang: Lord, authentic precious guru, Consider me with the great love of your wisdom mind. That I am unhindered in song is untrue, That I have sung many songs is true. So I, the singer Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Will now offer you, my protector, A song of thanks. Protector, your visit this year To Tsonying Island's secluded groves Is very fortunate. It was most kind of you To have given us the Speech ofManjushri, The essence of all Dharma. To practice as best I can Is my offering to you: Grant your blessings That my mind may mix with Dharma. Protector, may your life be finn and long (109a]; May we hear more of the vast and profound Dharma. May this offering of song please you greatly! At The Heart of the Lake 129 Pleased, he replied, \"That was excellent. But from your appearance, it's hard to tell whether you are Buddhist or Bonpo.\" I replied to his teasing with this song: The great garuda, dwelling on the peak of MountMeru, Has a body shaped like a man's, Yet, like a bird, has full-grown feathers and wmgs. Neither man nor bird: the garuda. The turquoise dragon, dwelling in space, Has a body shaped like a serpent, Yet, like a bird, it soars in space. Neither serpent nor bird: the turquoise dragon.

I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Have not studied the sutras and tantras; My songs are not fit to be read or heard by learned ones. Yet if those with insight were to hear my songs, They would not find them inconsistent with the scriptures.

To establish a connection with this sacred place, he stayed a few more days. As he was about to leave, I offered him this farewell song: Many authentic gurus' lotus feet have you attended; Many pith instructions from the sutras and tantras have you heard and con-templated; ~y lonely mountain retreats have you practiced in; Many qualities of experience and real-ization have been born in your mind. I wish that you, incomparable guru, may travel on in perfect health. I, a silly man, am also leaving, going to pleasant solitude. I will there practice the holy Dhanna, and so I ask for your spiritual protection, that my practice may have no obstacles and may progress. He replied: Meditate in solitude on the development and completion stages, and on the Great Perfection: At The Heart of the Lake 131 The knots in your central channel will be quickly untied. You express in song the meaning of the sutras, tantras, and shastras: Singer Tsogdruk Rangdrol, your songs are delightful! Until we meet again, stay well. Though I am unable to sing songs as delightful as yours, Out of my joy came this song of well-wishing. He then left to visit his disciples at Gomchok Her-mitage. Later in the year, an uninterrupted stream of Mongolian pilgrims came every day to the island from Arik, crossing from the southern and east-em banks of the frozen lake. There were so many people, it looked as if two black lines had been drawn across the ice. That year I received all the provisions I needed and did not have to leave my retreat [Ilia]. One day some valuables came my way. These were accepted by my ego, which began to speculate about them. However, Wisdom saw this, and chastised Ego: r ou are the one Who keeps those seeking liberation Prisoners in the dungeon of samsara, Forcing them to endure the punishment Of various unwanted sufferings. You--evil corrupter, black heart, enemy--Earlier, I didn't know how to find you. Today, I can see you clearly.

In the beginning of the first month, Perna Rangdrol, my first disciple and heart-son, who possessed a special karma because of his practice in previous lives, came to see me with some ofhis disciples. He offered me a white scarf and inquired about my health: Embodiment of the Buddhas of the three times, Sole protector of all beings, Precious lama endowed with all the supreme marks, Is your rupakaya well? At The Heart of the Lake 135 Melodiously, I sang in reply [114a]: I am not unwell; I am well. In the space of dharmakaya, the rupakaya is well. Worthy son of fortunate karma, Did your journey go well? He answered: By the grace of the authentic guru, From the beginning of the journey to the end, We did not suffer in body or mind; Rather, happiness has followed happiness. Afterward we had a long talk about Dharma. The next day they offered some gold and silver, and insisted I give them empowerments, trans-missions, and instruction, for their benefit. Accommodating their wishes, that same day I gave them the transmission and explanation on the Mind Training on Cutting AU T zes of Attachment. 63 As they had earlier received many elaborate empowerments, I considered that sufficient. I gave them the essential samadhi-empowerment and the empowerment of the display of aware-ness. Mterward I gave transmissions and instruc-tions on the luminous Great Perfection and on the Teachings of the Kadampa Spiritual Sons. I sustained them all with food, clothes, and Dharma. That year I stayed on the summit of the hill; my close son, Perna Rangdrol, stayed where I usually lived, and the other eight retreatants each occupied a cave. They all prac-ticed with energy and determination, and devel-oped boundless devotion, seeing the guru as the Buddha himsel£ Their gross poisons and defile-ments subsided, while their body, speech, and mind became serene, controlled, and in har-mony with the teachings. I stayed alone, maintaining silence. My prin-cipal practice was to remain in evenness free from concepts. In between sessions, I sang many songs for my own and others' benefit [ll4b]. In the summer we built a tiny shrine on the peak ofTsonying Island, for our own merit and"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"136 Til£ Life of Shabkar purification and for that of others, as well as for the welfare of the Dharma and living creatures. Whatever work needed to be done, such as fetch-ing stones, was done by the great son Perna Rangdrol and the other retreatants. When the temple was finished, a statue of the Great Compassionate One with a thousand arms and a thousand eyes was placed inside. On his right was placed a statue of Mahadeva, the lord of this place, and on his left a statue of the goddess Tsomen Trishok Gyalmo. Behind these three were placed the twelve volumes of the Prajnaparamita, sole mother of the Victorious Ones of the three times. The disciples and Dharma friends offered whatever they had-ritual implements, garments for the statues, and ceremonial scarves. A great consecration feast with prayers and dedications was held. Travelers say that this shrine still stands to this day. 64 That year, I felt quite at ease and un-troubled; my awareness became very clear. We had many talks about the sacred Dharma, through which my close son Perna Rangdrol and all those assembled there developed a strong aspiration for enlightenment, and a firm, unchanging confidence in the teachings of sutra and tantra, and of the old and new translations. They developed a pure, unbi-ased perception of all practitioners of the Dharma. One day those assembled there re-quested a song. I came up with this: Contemplating the kindness Of the matchless old father, the King of Dharma [115a], The devoted son bows down. Whatever experiences and realization have ariSen In the mind-stream of this yogin-Bringing them to my throat I will voice them a little. Praying unceasingly to the gracious lama, I have received his blessing in my mind-stream. Considering again and again samsara's defects, I feel revulsion for society, riches, and food. Meditating on all creatures as my kind parents, I have developed the wish to attain enlight-enment, While considering others dearer than mysel£ Preserving the nakedness of unobstructed awareness-void, I have given rise to unmistaken meditation experiences and realization. Practicing Thogal, the special teaching of the Great Perfection, I have discovered that appearances are the Akanishtha heaven. I, the yogin who belongs to the lineage of the Lake-born Vajra, 65 Have sung a song of experience and realization. All of you heart-friends who keep pure samaya, If you sing, sing a song like this. In this sacred solitude, The Heart of the Lake, He who is singing, with a dragon's thunder, Songs of experience and realization, Seems to be just this yogin, Tsogdruk Rangdrol! Through this merit may all beings attain Buddhahood! Everyone was pleased. Another day I took the collection of my written songs and went to a meadow. Sitting there on my own, I sang them with some pleasant melodies. Suddenly, I heard from the sky a voice exclaiming, \"Excellent!\" Filled with joy, I thought, \"Whoever hears these songs will benefit from them-gods, ghosts, or humans\" [115b]."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"One night I dreamed that a youth of about sixteen with a rose-white complexion appeared to me and said he was the tuUm of Jetsun K.alden Gyatso. 66 His countenance was so noble that one never tired oflooking at him.

When I asked where he was going, he replied he was on his way to meditate in solitude. I thought, \"Tills present incarnation must be in mountain retreat-how kind and wonderful for all! It's good that I met him.\" Then we both went on our way. The day after this dream, I recalled the kindness of the first Jetsun Kalden Gyatso and how he had lit the lamp of the Buddha's teaching in the Rekong district, which inspired this song: The light-rays of your omniscience pervade all things, The warmth of your kindness nurtures all beings: Holy sun of good fortune, Shine upon me from the sky of the absolute expanse!

When the immaculate white snow mountain OfMadhyamika,Mahamudra,and Mahasandhi Is bathed in the sunlight of pure perception, The stream of blessings will certainly flow. After I had sung this, all the disciples there devel-oped unbiased pure perception regarding all teachings and individual practitioners. One day in autumn, on seeing a layer of snow that had settled on a mountain peak, I recalled death and impermanence, and sang this to myself: That distant mountain peak Has now been covered in white snow. Hey there, Tsogdruk Rangdrol! Look at the hair on your old grey head! The blue gentian blossomed; It now has withered. Hey there, Tsogdruk Rangdrol! Look at your own face! The waterfowl, one by one, have left; Now the shores of the lake are deserted. Hey there, Tsogdruk Rangdrol! Look what's happened to your friends! What was once a rising sun Is already setting behind the mountain. Hey there, Tsogdruk Rangdrol! Look how old you've grown! Having sung this, I persevered in my practice. On the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month, 67 at night, I lit a butter-lamp, which burned brighdy. After praying to the precious Lord Lama Tsongkhapa, I went to sleep. I dreamed of a long crystal staircase on a mountain made from all kinds of precious stones [117a]. I ascended and, reaching the top, found myself on a level surface decorated with sweet smelling flowers. In the middle of the meadow stood a tent of blue bro-cade with beautiful designs, held with tent ropes made from five-colored silks tied to gold and silver pegs. Inside was a splendid lofty throne upon which were piled soft silken cushions. On it sat a lama of resplendent dignity. One never tired of look-ing at him, and the mere sight of his face put an end to mind's delusions. Surrounded by an innumerable retinue of noble ones, he was giving the transmission of the Condensed Meaning of the Graded Path. 68 I sat down in the assembly, and after having listened to all of it, I asked if I could borrow the book. \"You don't need to return it, just keep it,\" he told me. So I held the book close to my chest and went out-side, transported with joy. Outside, I was able to see throughout the Snow Land of Tibet and lingered a while, enjoy-ing the view. The staircase leading down seemed too steep to descend. Someone to my left said, \"Those who have been on this mountain need not descend by the staircase: they can fly!\" Using my shawl as wings I flew off into the sky and, while descending, could see all the dis-tricts of Tibet."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Inspired by the account of this dream, my close spiritual son, Rigdzin Dawa, offered a golden mandala [ll7b] and, together with all my worthy disciples, asked for a teaching in verse on the gradual path that is concise, easy to com-prehend, and easy to practice in all circum-stances. I composed an exposition of the graded path called T arch That Illwninates the Graded Path. 69 I gave the transmission and advised them to meditate on it a little every day. They practiced it much to their benefit. On a certain occasion, I had a vision of the precious lord Manjushri. Light shone forth from his heart and entered mine. I gradually merged into a state ofbliss, clarity, and nonthought. At the very moment it occurred to me to ask for some clarifications on the view, Manjushri melted into light and dissolved into my heart. I then fell asleep and dreamed that I held in my hand a glowing blue vessel made of precious stone. From within the vessel flowed golden li-quor, which three people drank. Mter that came much curd, which many people drank. So I thought: \"This seems to be a wish-fulfilling ves-sel. I must take it where there are many poor people.\" One day on the lake shore, I looked into the water from the top of a rock and saw, at the base of each rock, a great many creatures, large and small. Realizing that at every rock's base and from the surface to bottom of the whole lake there lived a multitude of creatures, I thought, \"Oh, how sad--there must be a way to do some-thing helpful for their future!\" [118a]. I went back, ground up all the blessed relics given to me by Abhe Rinpoche and others, and dissolved them in water. Then, wading into the lake all around the island, I poured the relics into the lake, while making deep prayers. When I was living at Tsonying, I noticed an eagle70 that, each spring day, caught three or four of the thousands of baby waterfowl that couldn't fly yet. The eagle tore out and devoured At The Heart of the Lake 139 their hearts while they were still alive. Feeling intense pity, each year during those two spring months, I tried to protect the small waterfowl from the eagle. They soon understood that I was protecting them and would come and gather near me on the shore of the island. Whenever the eagle approached, they all cried out miser-ably. One day I ran after the eagle wielding a slingshot; when the eagle saw me it faltered and fell into the water. It lay there flapping in the water, exhausted, and it began to sink, looking right at me. I felt sorry for it, hauled it out of the water, and put it on the shore. When it had dried a little, I tied the slingshot around its neck and scolded it, saying, ''When you're killing little birds you're quite brave, aren't you?\" I tapped it several times on its beak and claws with a twig, and just left it there for a while, then freed it [118b]. It didn't come back for some time. One day the eagle came back and caught a fledgling. I rushed after it and, when it landed on a boulder, I hit it with a stone from my slingshot, almost killing it. It flew off, leaving the baby bird sprawled on its back. I thought the little bird's heart had already been tom out, but when I picked it up, I saw it had just lost consciousness out of fear. Upon reviving, it looked at me and then scampered back into the water. Protecting them in this manner during those two years, I saved several thousand small birds. When they could fly, I used to make this prayer: Like these fledglings That now can fly about happily, Free from fear of the eagle, May all beings be freed from all fears And be established in happiness. I told the other retreatants staying in this sacred island to protect the small birds as I had done; later I heard they did so and saved many lives. Wherever I stayed, I would protect fledg-lings from birds of prey and keep small insects from killing each other. I would always tell others: \"Feeling compassion for all suffering beings, I protect their lives in whatever way I can [ll9a]. Each time I do so, I make a prayer to be able to"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"140 Th£ Life of Shabkar perform the splendid acts of the Bodhisattvas, the spiritual sons of the Victorious Ones. Through the connection created by such prayers, my strength of mind grew, and now I can benefit many beings. All of you, my disciples, should also make prayers when you perform even the slightest altruistic action; later you will be able to benefit all beings.\" Around this time the lake began to freeze once more. All my other provisions were exhausted, and I was eating only trampa. One morning I thought to myself, \"This excellent tsampa! Even when I have no other provisions, it's enough in itsel£\" I sang this song as it came to mind: The only guru I require Is the King of Dharma, Ngakyi Wangpo. The only friend that I require Is Perna Shepai Dorje. 71 The only student I require Is the renunciate Rigdzin Dawa. The only solitude that I require Is Tsonying Mahadeva. The only clothing I require Is the soft wool of sheep. The only food I require Is fme, fresh, white trampa. This sweet song of the six contentments Was sung by Tsogdruk Rangdrol! That year the retreatants were able to practice well, with few needs and a sense of contentment. When the lake froze over again, some new retreatants came, and patrons I had known before came to visit, along with many new ones [119b]. I foresaw that, with so many people in such a small area, I might become susceptible to dis-traction, and my practice might not progress. I felt inclined to go to a more remote, deso-late place where there was no living creature to be found, neither men nor dogs. Mter some thought I decided to go to towering Mount Machen, the king of white snow mountains, the most secluded place of all. I made up my mind that I would leave when summer came. When I told my disciples and patrons of my plans, my close spiritual son Perna Rangdrol and the other disciples from my native region said, \"When we left home to come here, the local lamas, your mother, friends, and relatives--every-one-insisted that we invite you to return home, and we promised to do our best. Your mother and all these people rely on you. Just one visit would fulfill their wishes. Isn't it said that pleas-ing others is also Dharma?\" The disciples and patrons around the Blue Lake argued there was no place more quiet than Tsonying, so I should continue to stay where I was. I paid them no heed, and confrrmed my irrevocable decision to go. My spiritual son Perna Rangdrol then said, \"If you won't go home and must go to Mount Machen, at least, please, answer all the letters I've brought.\" I promised to do so. My old mother had sent a message: \"Son, seven years have passed during which I have been constantly waiting for you to return at least once, but you have not come [120a]. I have often been sick; I would be very sad to die with-out seeing you. This year you must come.\" There was also a letter from her saying: You abandoned your homeland And left behind your family. You served at the feet of the Dharma King And received his profound instructions. You have stayed alone in the wilderness, without companions. Son, you who practice one-pointedly, Here is a message From the mother who gave you life: Son, hearing you are well, I am overjoyed. The illusory body of your mother Has felt much sickness and pain. I am hanging on; I'm just not dead yet."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Even though I haven't the good fortune To be with you for a lifetime, Come and let me see you just once more. I had hoped that we-mother and son-Could stay together in our homeland until I die. I was pleased to think that in my hour of need, When ill, stricken by old age, and at the time of death, I would have a son unlike others' sons. Now that I'm old, just to get up, Sit down, or move at all is difficult. With only meager food and drink My health has worsened. Your mother has no soft, warm clothes: I'm dressed in ragged clothing. Many years have passed since you have left me; How can you bear to stay away like this? When I hear the blue cuckoo, the king of birds, Or see someone practicing Dharma like you, I think of you, and tears flow from my eyes. Sometimes I can't even sleep at night. Even though in my previous letters I've asked you many times to come, You haven't done so. Have you become more dull-witted than a calf? When animal mothers call their young, The young come, instantly! [120b] Consider the kindness With which I have cared for you, And, by all means, come to see me this year. Once we've met, you may go wherever you please: I, your own mother, promise this. At The Heart of the Lake 141 In the past, did I ever once create a single obstacle For your practice of the Dharma? Now that I am just about to meet with death, Other than meeting you again, What other wish could I have? I, your aged mother, Have grown old; I'm close to death. Son, if, out of compassion, You don't pay me even one visit, All your meditation on kindness and compassion toward all beings Will have been for naught. As a result of this letter I am sending you, son, May we swiftly meet once more. May disease, famine, and strife in this region subside, And may virtue, excellence, and abundance Increase like the waxing moon. In reply I wrote this: Dear old mother, kinder than any other mother I know of, I have received your letter And am pleased to hear your illusory body is sound. While I, your son, have been practicing the Dharma, Certainly, you've never caused me the slightest obstacle; · Rather, you have helped me. · By the grace of the guru and the Three · Jewels My illusory body is well, too, And my meditation experiences have progressed.

As people say, \"There's not much difference Between reading in a letter about someone's well-being And meeting him in person.\" Before, I didn't come, but I will come, soon. Several years may pass when an only son Is off performing exorcisms and village ceremonies in distant places, Simply to earn enough to feed his family [12la], Yet the parents he leaves behind don't mind. So why should you feel so unhappy, Mother, That your son has been away all these years, Staying in distant places, In solitary mountain retreats, To accomplish your lasting happiness and enlightenment? There might be many children who benefit Their parents in this life with food, clothes, and wealth. Yet how many parents have children staying in the mountains, Practicing the holy Dharma for the benefit of their parents' future lives? There are difficult children, always opposed to their parents, Who live nearby them all their lives, bringing their parents more harm than help. And there are loving children who do bring benefit, Even though they live far away-Isn't this so? Think about it. We shall meet again in this life; Even if we don't, whatever practice I undertake I shall dedicate it to you, Mother. I pray that, later, we will meet again in the Joyful Pure land And stay there together, never parting. I sent this with some relics and a small present. A letter from the ngakpas ofShohong also urged me to revisit my homeland: Lama, using the sharp hook of compassion, You bring onto the path of liberation The mad, rampaging elephant-disciples, who, Intoxicated with the wine of karma and emotions, Are lost in the jungle of samsara [121 b]. Compassionate One, Heed the fierce and desperate cry of our community of ngakpas! Weighed down by the heavy load of the three sufferings, Tormented by the burning thirst of the three poisons, Wandering constantly over the arid plains ofsamsara, Deprived of the food, riches, and clothing of liberation, Crying out with hatred and attachment, Suffering from multiple afflictions in this house of samsara, All of us impoverished ones Are longing for the coming of a guide like you. Don't linger on golden Tsonying Island, But, sailing on the boat of compassion, come quickly! Bring with you the precious gold of transmission and realization! With fierce lamentations, we pray over and overagam. Blinded by the cataract of ignorance, We can't see the pure path; Driven on by the winds of evil karma We approach the precipice of the three lower realms."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"If you do not seize us with your compassion, we are lost. How can you forsake us? In this boundless ocean of samsara, We are carried away by the great raging waves of karma and kleshas; If you don't save us from being devoured by the sea monster of suffering, Will you not belie your claim to cherish us? This lotus garden of your brothers and sisters who keep pure samaya Is now fresh, blossoming with hundreds of petals. But unless you, the precious bee, now come to visit it, Once the flowers have been withered by the morning frosts of sickness and death, It will be too late! 0 king of swans, protector of beings in this life and the next, It is now time for you to come quickly To the center of the milk-lake of ngakpas And sing the sweet song of the Mahayana. On this auspicious day of the waxing moon, With an immaculate blue-green silken scarf [122a] We present this letter, a pleasant soft meadow Where the deer of your eyes might frolic for an instant. I wrote in reply: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King, My refuge and protector: Bestow all excellence upon these friends And relatives, in this and future lives. All you ngakpas with pure samaya Whom I have known since we were young, Listen to the words of your friend, Tsogdruk Rangdrol: At The Heart of the Lake 143 Not having perfected myself, how can I perfect others? If we stay together, you will see my faults and your faith will grow dim, So there is little reason for us to meet. The best for all of us is that I engage in practice. Even if we were to meet, I have nothing more to tell you Than the instructions I have given you before. Your practicing in accord with these Will bring me great joy, And bring you certain contentment and bliss. I pray that, throughout all of our lives, Whenever we want to meet, Wherever that might be, We may meet like a loving mother and her child. When I attain perfect Buddhahood, May all of you become my first disciples. Until then, throughout all of my lives, May I be your spiritual guide. I sent this with a small gift. I also replied in verse to all those who had written: lamas, rela-tives, and friends from home. I have not included them all here, as there are too many, but one can find them in my Collected Songs [122b]. While I was writing these replies, my rela-tive and disciple Ngawang Tashi thought that perhaps if he tried asking me one more time, I might agree to go home. Putting into verse all the reasons why I should visit my homeland, he said: Vidyadhara Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Who, forsaking all activities of this life, Have secluded yourself in the solitude of Tsonying Island, Here is a request to you from your devoted son:"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"144 The Life of Shabkar Everyone in our region, young and old, Headed by your mother and relatives, Held a meeting and decided That I should be sent to invite you. They said that, though last year Y au declined their insistent requests, This year whatever happens, you should come. By now, everyone must be saying: \"The envoy we sent to invite the lama, Might have died on the way, Or gone off on pilgrimage, Or left for Mongolia to do business-We must find out.\" \"Maybe he is so happy staying with the lama That he has forgotten all about us. Far from inviting the lama, He might even entreat him to stay where he is. Or maybe the envoy is sick. He is not coming-what happened?\" They must be imagining all kinds of possibilities, So please, come home! Particularly, your dear mother Has gone without seeing you for seven years. The sun ofher life is about to set: Your old mother is close to death. She may be happy in future lives, But she yearns to see you, now, in this one. You ought to visit her once, Since it would be best if she could be happy Both in this and in future lives. So please, come home! [123a]. If remote mountains please you, We have most pleasant mountain hermitages, Free ofbustle and diversions. So please, come home! If remote forests please you, We have delightful forest groves Abundant with nourishing wild fruit, As you well know, So please, come home! All the hermitages nearby Need to be blessed. So please, come home! Your homeland is a wild land Where beings need to be trained, So care for us; don't dismiss us from your heart! If you care, show it now, When everyone is awaiting your arrival. Please, come home! No one here creates obstacles to Dharma practice. Emulating your example, Many practitioners have given up all con-cern for this life And live in secluded mountain hermitages. So please, come home! By the power of my sincerity, May I be able to bring the guru home And through the guru's coming, May the whole region experience joy and well-being. May the rain of Dharma fall ceaselessly On the field of beings who need to be transformed. Practicing according to your instructions, May all beings attain Buddhahood. In response to his eager request, I promised to stay no more than a year in the snows of Machen and then come home. That comforted him some-what [123b]. A faithful patron from the Shabdrung com-munity told me, \"Y au haven't been home for"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"many years. Won't your mother think her son is sick or dead, and that people are keeping it a secret?\" I answered, \"It doesn't really matter if I get sick and die,\" and I sang this song on the yogin's being ill and being cremated: I pray with respect at the feet Of the one who has perfected all qualities, Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo: Bless me with death--death to ego-clinging. I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Am a yogin of the Great Perfection. Not only sickness, but even death is fine with me. Listen, I shall tell you all About my sickness, death, and cremation. The aggregate body stemming from cling-ing to \"ego\" Caught the sickness of the lama's blessing And was possessed by the demon of unchanging awareness. When the agonizing pain of spiritual expenence And realization struck me down, Spiritual songs escaped from my mouth like moans. Unable to eat the food of the eight worldly concerns, I collapsed on the bed of the sublime Dzogchen teaching. Not just sickness, but even death is fme with me: The demon of natural awareness Caught me with the lasso of unwavering samadhi. He murdered clinging to the skandhas as real, With the weapon of perfect view: From the extremities escaped the bodily warmth ofhatred; From the nose and mouth came the water of attachment; The head of ignorance fell forward; At The Heart of the Lake 145 The limbs of pride collapsed; The breathing of jealousy came to an end, And I died in the expanse of the unborn dharmakaya. Not just death, but even cremation is fme with me [124a]: The helpers \"freed as they arise\" Built the funeral pyre of the dharmadhatu. The firewood of fum shamatha was arrayed Upon the even plain of pristine simplicity. The cremation fire-the five wisdoms-Consumed the corpse of ignorance and the other poisons. Then the remains were scattered on the ground of the unborn And buried in the charnel ground of Samantabhadra. My song greatly increased his faith. I then gave to Dechen Garwang Tsel, \"Powerful Dance of Great Bliss,\" a staff and a yantra that liberates by wearing, and advised him to concentrate on practice in a hermitage near Gomeh. He became a snow lion-like meditator, who, as result of his practice, was able to benefit the Dharma and sentient beings. I took care of the hermits from Dzogeh-Kunzang Gyurme and Kunzang Rangdrol, Rab-jampa Kunga Gyaltsen, Gelong Tendar, the monk from Mangneh, and others-nine practi-tioners altogether--supplying them with good food and clothing so that they could fly the victory banner of practice on Tsonying Island. As my representative, I sent back the accomplished yogin Perna Rangdrol with this letter to all the devotees, disciples, and house-holders in Rekong: I bow down to the Dharma King, my refuge and protector: Look with compassion on me and those connected with me. All you devoted fellow countrymen with faith in me Should venerate this supreme son of mine, Perna Rangdrol, as myself [124b]."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"146 Th£ Life of Slwhkar Until we meet again, read the songs he will bring you And practice accordingly.

My friends, if you give up concern with this life And follow my example, you will attain lasting happiness. I then told Perna Rangdrol: \"These songs are not just fancies that came into my mind. They are based on the writings of our spiritual forefathers, such as the Teachings of the Kadampas, Father and Sons (Atisha and his heart-sons), which are themselves based on the teachings of the Victorious Ones; on the Mani Kahbum ofSongtsen Campo, the incarnation of the Great Compas-sionate One; the Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa; the Elegant Sayings of Jamyang Sakya Pandita; the Gradual Patlz of Je Rinpoche; the songs of the omniscient Longchenpa; and the songs ofjetsun Kalden Gyatso and others. If an intelligent fellow like you follows the example of these songs and shares them with others, they will inspire faithful men and women to practice the Dharma.\" I gave him the manuscript, containing a thousand songs, and extensive advice on both immediate and ultimate matters. Just before my disciples departed, I expressed in this song my aspiration to meet them again in this and future lives [125a]: Wish-fulfilling gem, supreme ornament of my crown, Gracious father guru, I bow down at your feet. May auspiciousness prevail wherever we, teacher and disciples, go. May we be blessed to accomplish all our aspirations. Following sublime gurus, Accompanied by sublime companions, I listened to and meditated in accord with the sublime teachings, Mter which I practiced in sublime places. Hearing of this you felt faith, devotion, And a deep urge to come here. Although many tried to stop you, You paid them no heed, Aware that one should heed only Dharma. Last year you came here and have stayed until now. I, an ordinary man, have taught you Whatever I know of the holy Dharma, And you have practiced it all year. Even if we part now, we have been fortunate. A lifetime is short and strewn with hazards and obstacles. Nobody knows how long it will endure: Give up thoughts of this life! Sons, make the length of your practice Equal the length of your life; Abide in mountain solitudes, like a wild deer. May your life be free of obstacles; I pray that we, master and disciples, May meet again in this life. Even if we do not meet again, I pray that we meet for certain in the next. May we go to Buddhafields never visited before, May we behold Buddhas never seen before, May we hear sublime Dharmas never heard before, May we see sights never seen before.

Father, source of excellence, think of me: When I was constantly distracted by the activities of this life, You warned me of life's impermanence and of the shortcomings of samsara, And, hearing this, I gave up wealth, food, and society. In the flower-strewn meadow ofTseshung, I tasted the nectar of the Dharma King's words, And stayed at your feet, my protector, for one year. At this time, following the command of our spiritual father and of you, his heart-son, I went to Tashikhyil, in my homeland, Rekong. You told me to raise the victory banner of accomplishment, And I practiced there three years and ten months. For my own sake, I offered my sincere practice; For the sake of others, I established the faithful in virtuous ways. During that time, I was grieved by the death of the Dharma King, And deeply longed to see you, my protec-tor. Last year I came here to meet you, And joy arose in me-As in a meeting of mother and son. At The Heart of the Lake 14 7 For one year I have been with you, like your shadow, And received the vast and profound instructions That ripen and free: This year has been very fortunate for me. Furthermore, you have given us so many songs Enabling us to attain higher rebirths and liberation. Wondrous! I shall now go back to Rekong [126a]; Father guru, may you stay in good health.

I felt an infmitely strong sad-ness, and, in tears, I sang this song of the six remembrances of the guru: South of mighty Mount Meru, In the center is the southern continent, Jambudvipa; In its northern region is Tibet, the Land of Snows. On this vast plateau [126b], In a valley meadow, covered with flowers, In a tent white as a snow peak, On a throne covered with soft and beautiful cushions, Presiding over a varied gathering of subjects and students, Sits the precious unequaled lord. Merely to lay one's eyes upon him Makes happiness and joy well up: Whoever comes before him Cannot bear to part from him. The image of my father, the Dharma King, Comes to my mind. The clear way he addressed The excellent assemblies of silent listeners Comes to mind. Kinder than other fathers, Ngawang Wang-how wonderful if he were here now! Although I have little devotion, I long to see him. Although so far apart, I long to be with him again. Thinking again and again, I remember my old father, The Dharma King, his queen, and his court: The image of the Mother Abhe comes to my mind. To the left of the Dharma King, on a pile of exquisite soft cushions, With a graceful form one never tired of looking at, A daughter of the gods descended to the human realm-The sweet way she used to speak to her retinue comes to mind.

With the Dharma of the great Secret Vajrayana And the four empowerments, you ripened our mind-streams. The memory of those occasions comes to mind.

Although I have no offerings, I long to receive them. Thinking again and again, I remember my old father, The Dharma King, his queen, and his court.

I wept again after I had sung this. That night I had a dream: I arrived in Urgeh and was invited into Pontsang Rinpoche's large tent by an attendant whom I knew well. Inside were the precious Dharma King, his queen, their sons, the ministers, subjects, and all my vajra friends, gathered as before. I felt an immeasurable delight, and with supreme respect prostrated myself and approached the Dharma King [128a]. He was smiling and laughing just as he used to, and he said, with affection,\"Renunciate of the moun-tains, by thinking of us you have come to pay a visit. It is good to see you. Now relax and enjoy yourself!\" He had me sit near him. A big feast was held. From the crowd two young men stood 'up and, in unison, sang Ti-betan songs with slow, enchanting melodies and beautiful words. Mter some Mongolian songs, a man named Durel Onpo put on a brocade dress and a beautiful domed hat with a wide brim and rose from the gathering. Dancing, and singing in central Tibetan dialect, he had everyone roaring"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"150 The Life of Shabkar with laughter. I was having a wonderful time but I laughed so hard that it woke me up. Wide awake, I experienced a clear and joyful state of mind. At the end of the first month, as I was about to leave Tsonying Island to go to great Mount Machen, all the fortunate heart-disciples nearby held a ganachakra feast. At the end of the feast, I told them: ''We have all gathered here, without anyone having requested us to do so. This is due to the pure prayers of aspiration we have made in the past. We have stayed together for two years, but now our ways part. This demonstrates the impermanence of all things [l28b]. Therefore, don't be attached to anything, don't cling to anything-bring everything onto the path of Dharma. \"Especially remember that, after this year, you won't be staying on here either. None of you should be left hungry or cold: when winter approaches, those who have plenty should share with those who don't. In this way, share joy and suffering. Treat each other with tenderness, like brothers and sisters, and persevere day and night in whatever teaching you are practicing. This is very important.\" I then sang this song of the yogin's departure: Precious lord guru and the Three Jewels, Bless the three doors of your sons who dwell here. Lords of this remote land, Heart of the Lake, Assist the practitioners who stay here. Clear and cool ocean, farewell. I, the golden duck, will spread my wings And fly off to another lotus lake.

Do as I instructed you before: You will gain immediate happiness And ultimate Buddhahood. By the merit of singing this song, May all you renunciates Endure no hardships while remaining in this solitude; May you enjoy the good fortune of prac-ticing the Dharma. In reply, my disciple Kunga Gyaltsen offered this song to wish me well and to request spiritual protection: Upholding a stainless life of liberation, Like the pure guide Milarepa, the heir of the Buddhas, You are the source of every pure virtue, Our permanent refuge and protector. I, Kunga Gyaltsen, an inferior, Utterly confused, and humble monk, Opening the ten-petaled lotus of my folded hands, Prostrate myself before you with extreme devotion and submit this wish for your well-being: May you be well, sun, jewel of the sky, And return to shine upon us, the lotus-garden.

The lake is also known as Trishok Gyalmo (khri gshog rgyal mo), the \"Queen who Destroyed Ten Thousand.\" This name is explained as follows by Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche: \"A long time ago the site of the lake was a vast plain; at its center was a spring. There lived an old woman who each day sent her daughter to fetch water from the spring. Knowing that it was not an ordinary spring, she told her daughter always to be careful to put back the flat stone that kept the spring covered. One day, the girl forgot. The water kept on flowing, filled the whole plain and destroyed ten thousand homes, hence the name of the lake.\" This account is almost identical to the one given by Surnpa Khenpo (see the Bibliography), who, how-ever, spells the name khri shor rg;yal mo, the \"Queen Who Swept Away Ten Thousand.\" The legend also says that Guru Padmasambhava came to the lake and miraculously manifested a small hill that covered the spring and stopped the flood. This hill was Heart of the Lake Island, Tsonying Mahadeva (mtsho snying malzadeva). Sumpa Khenpo quotes early references to this lake, e.g. in the writings ofKing Songtsen Gampo, who speaks of the \"Bodhisattva Naga Minister from the Ocean that flooded Ten Thousand\" (khri bshos rg;ya mtsho'i klu bum byang chub sems.) The lake is said to be inhabited by the naga king Bodhisattva and by four naginis, the four Menmo (sman mo) sisters, one of whom is Trishok Gyalmo. These four sisters also happen to be, with the White Mahakala (mgon dkm) and Vaishravana (mam tlws sras), the guardians (gter srung) of the rta phagyid bz:}zin nor bu (see Appendix 4). 24 . .Nyungne (smyung gnas) is a practice of fasting focused upon the Buddha of Compassion, Avalo-kiteshvara, in his eleven-faced and thousand-armed form. The main lineage of T!)IUngne practice came down through the famed Indian nun Gelongma Palma (dge slong ma dpal mo): Bhikshuni Shri. 25. \"Lake-born Vajra\" (mtsho slges rdo rje) is one of Guru Padmasambhava's names. In his Description of Trakar Drel Dzong (brag dkm sprel rdzong gi dkar chag), Drigung Chotrak ('bri gung chos grogs, 1597-1659) speaks of Guru Padmasambhava blessing Lake Trishok Gyalmo. The Guide to Tsorrying Island (mtsho snyingmahatkwa'ignasyig), written by Orgyen Samten Lingpa ( 0 rg;yan bsam gtan gling pa) according to a vision he had, says that 108 great spiritual treasures (gter ma) were concealed by Guru Padmasambhava and Vairocana on this blessed island. 26. In accordance with his monastic vows, Shabkar would eat just once a day at noon. He chiefly ate roasted barley flour (tsampa), which, mixed with tea, needs no further cooking. This combination of tsampa and tea constitutes the diet of most retreatants in Tibet. 27.

They try to subdue evil spirits rather than taming their own ego-clinging. In the CMd practice one visualizes one's body being cut into pieces, which are offered to the four classes of guests (see Author's Introduction, note 32). On a higher level the practice of CMd is intended to cut through the belief that the ego and phenomena truly exist. 31.

The \"exhaustion of phenomena in dharmata\" (chos '!J'id zad pa) corresponds to the reabsorption of all phenomena into the absolute nature, which occurs simultaneously with ultimate realization and repre-sents the fourth and final stage ofThogal practice. 36. When, through having performed the ultimate practices of the Great Perfection, a yogin is on the verge of dissolving his or her body into rainbow light, he or she may concentrate awareness on the tips of the fmger nails (which are considered dead parts of the body). This results in a body of light which re-mains visible for the sake of all sentient beings, like Vimalamitra and Guru Padmasambhava. This is the wisdom form called the Rainbow Body of Great Transformation (Ja' lus 'pho ba chen po). If the yogin chooses not to do this concentration, like Chetsun Senge Wangchuk (lee btsun seng ge dbang phyug, lOth-11th cent.), his body will dissolve entirely into light. 37.

This long-life empowerment, according to the tradition of the \"Sole Mother Queen of the Siddhas\" (ma gcig grub pa'i rgyal mo), is an important longevity practice in the Kagyu lineage. When Rechungpa, Milarepa's heart-disciple, was struck by leprosy he was sent to India to fmd a cure for his illness. There he met the Indian master known as Guru Balachandra (bla ma ba la tsan dra). One day Balachandra told Rechungpa, \"Today, you must go to the Happy City (dga' ba).\" There Rechungpa met an Indian ascetic, wearing a deerskin on his shoulder, who was blowing a thighbone trumpet. Staring piercingly at Rechungpa, the ascetic told him: \"You have only seven months more to live.\" Filled with anxiety, Rechungpa came back to Balachandra and told him what had happened. Balachandra said: \"I knew all about it, but so that you would believe it, I sent you there.\" Then Balachandra went on: \"Go to the place called the 'Golden Mandala ofMeadows and Woods' (shing spang gser gyi mandal) and meet there the dakini called 'The Sole Mother Queen of the Siddhas' (ma gcig grub pa'i rgyal mo). She has attained the siddhi of Amitayus (tshe dpag med), the Buddha of Boundless Life, who blessed her in reality; she alone can save you from dying within seven months.\" Rechungpa went and made his request to the dakini, who asked: \"How much more life do you want?\" Rechungpa answered: \"Until I feel it's all right to die.\" So the Sole Mother made the prayer: \"May the son live the number of years that separate him from his father,\" and spoke: \"Live forty-four years more!\" (Milarepa, 1040-1123, was forty-four years older than Rechung-pa, 1084-1161). When Rechungpa did the longevity practice that the Queen of the Siddhas had taught him, he became cured of his illness. He went back to Tibet and again metjetsun Mila who, offering a mandala, asked Rechungpa to give him one of the pith instruc-tions that he received in India. Accordingly, Rechungpa offered to Mila this longevity practice, which is focused both on Amitayus to extend life and on Hayagriva to dispel obstacles.

In the second half of the first month of the year called ''White,\" the female Earth Snake 1 Year, I set out on the white ice pathway to cross over this lake of immense splendor and auspi-Ciousness. My boots, however, were giving me blisters. I thought, \"I wish I had a piece of cloth!\" I asked around, but no one had any. I said in jest, \"Ama Tsomen Gyalmo! 2 These boots are giving my feet blisters; I can hardly walk. Please give me half a yard of cotton cloth!\" As we went on, everyone saw a piece of red cloth that was being blown about by the wind; it landed in front of us. \"This must be a gift from Tsomen Gyalmo,\" we thought. Everyone was amazed [132a]. Having crossed over the lake, we made tea near Tserpa Mountain and had our lunch. That same day I went to the house of the Mongolian family Bageh. One of my disciples, a skilled phy-sician, translated and explained some thirty songs that I had sung for the householders. He also translated and explained the teachings I gave, . turning the minds of all the devoted Mongolian patrons in that area toward the sacred Dharma. They offered many valuables, including 155 horses and cattle, gold and silver, clothes and brocade. I gave everything back to them, after hav-ing made prayers of dedication and aspiration. The Bageh family would not take back the horse they had given me, so I had to accept it. When I was going to leave to circumambulate the lake, I loaded the horse with clothes and provisions and brought it along. Mter finishing the circumambulation, I sent the horse back. Before leaving, I took my walking stick, rose, and slowly sang this song: May the lord and master gaze with a loving heart And bestow his blessings on you patrons. All of you have been most kind To me, the wanderer from Rekong. My devoted benefactors, farewell-Now I'll go to retreat in the mountains. Just as we, patrons and practitioners, separate, So are all things impermanent [132b]. Without being attached to wealth, food, or clothing, Practice the Dharma as much as you can.

May virtue and excellence reign when we meet again. May auspiciousness prevail in this land! Since I was young and my voice was good, the Mongolian ladies, though they did not understand the meaning of the words, were moved just by the sound of my voice; many of them began crying. Filled with faith, they made many prostrations. and circumambulations. In reply to my song, my devoted disciple, the skillful physician, explained at length why I should come back again, and fmally offered this song of thanks [133a]: Lord, qualified and precious master, Without concern for gifts Of wealth and material things, You have been most kind to us, The householders and ordained sangha of the Blue Lake, Turning our minds toward the Dharma.

They walked on with me, escorting me a long way, their eyes filled with tears. Then I said, \"Now, all of you should go back. I will come back soon.\" They prayed to meet me again throughout all of their lives. They stayed, watching me go for as long as I was in sight, not wanting to go back home. Finally, sadly, they returned home. From then on, they worked wholeheartedly to give up evil and prac-tice virtue. We, master and disciples, circumambulated the lake. Arriving at the northeast side, we camped on the shore in front of Arik. In Arik there was a faithful old man who had been suffering from an abdominal disease and had only a few days to live. His son came to me and said, \"Please be kind enough to perform the transference of con-sciousness tonight for my father.\" I told him, \"Tonight, after everyone has gone to sleep, I will do phowa. At that time, tell your old father to have faith\" [133b]. While I was performing the phowa from a distance, the old man was saying to his son, \"I had an experience of seeing a dark man come to me. He stuck an iron pipe into my genitals, and I felt completely cold all the way up to my navel."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Then Lama Shabkar arrived, and the black man pulled out the pipe and ran away. At this point, Lama Shabkar inserted a copper tube from the crown of my head down to my navel, and my entire body became filled with bliss.\" Soon after he had related his experience to his son, the old man drew his last breath. This occurred at the same time as I was finishing the transfer of consciousness. Because of this, an old lama living in their home gained faith in me and came to our encampment with some tea, butter, and tsampa as offerings for dedication prayers, and told me the story of the old man's experience. Before going home, the lama made this aspiration, \"At the time of my death, may I meet a master like you.\" We continued the round of the lake, and many people from Arik and Mongolia came to see us. I gave them teachings and sang spiritual songs to all of them. Out of deep faith they offered many horses and cattle, which I returned to them. A Mongolian who had come a long distance to see me offered, as a meeting gift, an excellent horse, with saddle, rug, and bridle. I did not accept it, but he left it for me anyway, and took off. The next day I met an utterly destitute beg-gar from Jigme Behla, with his wife and three children [134a]. When he started to beg from me, I felt strong compassion. I placed the reins of the horse in his hands, saying, \"This is for you.\" He couldn't believe it and asked, \"Aren't you teasing me?\" \"No, I am really giving it to you-take it!\" I replied. Then he, his wife, and his children made prostrations and paid me hom-age; joyfully, they took t~e horse and left. Having come around the head of the iake, we reached its southern side. There was a young woman there from the house ofShabdrung who had been suffering from \"Chinese wounds\"3 for a year. Her tongue had been cut off, but still she lingered on, unable to die. I performed phowa for her and, in less time than the time it takes to boil water for tea, she passed away. Again I was offered a horse with saddle, rug, and bridle. 4 Having accepted it, I gave it to an old man from Mangneh who had no money or Meditation at Mount Machen 15 7 possessions. An old lady who had not many years to live asked me to perform the transfer-ence of consciousness for her. When I was per-forming the phowa, she lost consciousness for a moment. 5 When she regained her senses, her son offered a horse to repay my kindness to his mother. I gave it to a poor wandering monk from Dzogeh. As I was doing phowa, giving teachings, and singing songs of Dharma and realization, the pious men and women from the house of Shabdrung came to see me. I gave them teach-ings on death and impermanence and on the karmic law of cause and effect. Many promised to give up evil actions and perform virtuous deeds [134b]. The people of the Shabdrung clan were prosperous, so they might have offered me a great deal, had I been willing to accept it; how-ever, I accepted hardly anything, and what I did accept, I gave to the poor. Some patrons said, \"This is the first and probably the last lama to give away horses to beggars.\" Thus they show-ered flowers of praise over me. I borrowed two yaks from a couple oflong-time patrons and loaded our provisions onto them. As I was about to leave, with the old man from Mangneh and the monk from Dzogeh leading the animals, I sang this song of good wishes for all the people gathered there: The lord, authentic master, wish-fulfilling gem, Provider of all needs and wishes, common and supreme, Adorns the wheel of great bliss on this beggar's crown. From my heart I supplicate you, jewel ornament Bestow on all the men and women assembled here The siddhi of happiness in this and future lives!

If the eclipse-god does not devour me, I will return, spreading a cool white light. If you, night-waterlilies, are not crushed down by snow, You may welcome me, with swaying, dancing blossoms [135a]. Farewell, male and female patrons, As I, yogin, do not stay, but prepare to leave.

Filled with faith and reverence, everyone gath-ered there prostrated themselves and made circumambulations. The faithful doctor, a learned monk who had been my disciple for a long time, offered this song of good wishes in reply to mine: Precious master, protector and source of refuge, Bestow your blessing on us, the faithful who have assembled here, And on all sentient beings, young and old, So that our minds may tum toward the Dharma. It is so rare to meet a spiritual guide: Meeting you, we had the good fortune To taste the nectar of your words. Lord and rupakaya, go now; be well. Protect until enlightenment All of us who are linked with you. Our present meeting has lasted but an instant; May we meet many, many times again. In this dark age, one's hold on life is tenuous at best [135b]; Thus, if we, master and disciples, do not meet again in this life, I pray that in the next life we may meet In the Blissful Buddhafield, The Buddhafield Truejoy,6 Or any other Pure Realm. There, may we receive teachings, attain enlightenment, And serve as guides for all the beings of the impure realms. Having presented this song, the benefactors asked for blessings, and then returned home. A few old patrons escorted us a little further, until I told them, \"You need not walk any farther.\" I blessed them and tied protection cords around their necks, and they went home. We, myself and two disciples, set out on the main road leading to central Tibet. One afternoon, as we were walking at a leisurely pace on the way to Mount Machen, in a meadow below the road we saw eighty wild asses, mothers and foals, eating grass and frolicking about. 7"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Since I had never seen this before, I watched, thinking, ''What a pity! They have never heard the sound of Dharma!\" and I sang the mani slowly and melodiously. Far from being fright-ened, they approached and gathered around me. While they remained thus, listening, I sang this song, with the same tune: In former times, in the noble land oflndia, You turned three times the Wheel of Dharma. Buddha, remain at the crown of my head And regard with compassion all these wild asses. You who have never heard even one word of teaching-you beings were all once my own mother. Poor wild asses gathered here [136a], Listen to the true words of the Buddha: \"Doing no evil whatsoever, Practice virtue perfectly. Tame your mind absolutely: This is the teaching of the Buddha.\" Compassionate teacher, enlightened one: By hearing the sound of Dharma, Their obscurations having been purified, May these wild asses obtain a human form in their next lives And practice the holy teachings! Seeing this, my two escoits were filled with faith and, with tears in their eyes, said, ''What a great wonder that those wild asses came closer to listen to your teaching instead of running away. You must be Milarepa in person! We have been so fortunate to serve you. From now on, in life and death, please keep us always under your spiritual protection.\" Having said this, they made many prostrations. I also thought, \"Considering how, through the blessing of my master and the Three Jewels, these animals came to listen to the Dharma, there might also be some benefit ifi teach human beings.\" Meditation at Mount Machen 159 Further on, I met some people who asked me who I was, and many other questions. Mter answering them, I sang this song: All of you, listen to my song: I am a wandering hermit of the mountains. My homeland is any land, without preference. My chieftain is my perfect master, My paternal uncles are the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, My maternal uncle is the supremeyidam deity, My friends are the dakas and dakinis [136b], My relatives are the protectors and guardians of the Dharma, My neighbors are the local deities and local guardians. My wife is the beautiful maiden Emptiness, My offspring the innocent child Aware-ness. My house is any remote. rocky cave. My field is unchanging faith, My crops are the ten spiritual activities.8 My wealth is the seven noble riches. My benefactors are Tibetan, Mongolian and Chinese: These are the particulars of this yogin. Later, I met some hunters on the road. When they asked me who I was and where I was going, I replied: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King. Listen here to the yogin's song of reply! I am a hermit who has renounced mundane activities. I am a monk possessing the vows. I am a ngakpa whose samaya is pure. I am a meditator who dwells in caves. I am a practitioner who tames his own mind. I am a spiritual friend who encourages others to practice the Dharma. My name is Tsogdruk Rangdrol, and"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"160 Tie Life of Shabkar I am going to the snowy range of Machen. Having arrived there, I will strive to attain enlightenment. These are the particulars of this yogin. They prostrated themselves with faith and reverence, asked for blessings, and left. We went on. On the day we first saw the peaks of Machen Pomra, 9 we made a fragrant smoke-offering and offered prostrations in the direction of the holy mountain. Suddenly the sun shone on the clouds: rainbows appeared and there was a welcoming rain of orange-red flowers [137a]. On the day we reached the foot of the snow mountain, a formidable sound, like that of a thundering dragon, resounded from the glacier. I looked at the mountain and felt happiness and joy. My two escorts stayed on for a couple of days, during which we built a small stone hut, just my size, under a rock overhang in a sunny spot. 10 The escorts then returned home with the yaks. Once alone, out of sheer joy I sang this song: Keeping above my head as an adornment My perfect and sacred master, I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, felt yearning To go to the mountain ofMachen. The white glacier, Mount Machen, The stone hut fit for one person, And I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, have come together: A perfect meeting-auspicious coincidence! The birds calling out in pleasant tones, The lovely wild animals with their lovely forms, And I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, have come together: A perfect meeting-auspicious coincidence! The oral instructions given by my master, The provisions offered by patrons, And my illusory body, free of sickness, have all come together: A perfect meeting-auspicious coincidence! Freedom from obstacles and adverse conditions, Enjoying all favorable conditions, Practicing the divine Dharma correctly: A perfect meeting-auspicious coincidence! 'When all these favorable conditions arise together, Now that I stay happily in solitude I feel like singing a song aloud From the slopes of the radiant snow mountain. 'When the same auspicious conditions occuragam For me and my fellow practitioners, We all will experience the same feeling of joy [137b]. I then persevered single-mindedly in my medita-tion practice. One day I sang this spontaneous song in praise of the place: To my master, who embodies the Three Jewels, I bow down in devotion with my body, speech and mind. Now I sing a small song of praise To this mountain possessing all good qualities and no faults. This ornament of the southern continent of the Rose-apple Tree, 11 The mountain renowned as Magyal Pomra Has been celebrated as marvelous By many spiritual forefathers. This white and majestic snow mountain Is beautified by a raiment of white silk."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Those seeing this white glacier peak Have white thoughts and delight in the Dharma. The moment the snow is touched by sunlight The pure glacier water makes trickling and splashing sounds. This water quenches all thirsts and cures all illness: Everyone comes to drink it. The flow of the famous Machu River Is unceasing, like that of the Ganges. By means of this river, all the water covering the land Flows down into the oceans of the world. On the valley meadows in the mountain's foothills, Wild animals move about at leisure. Chasing one another, gamboling playfully: Watching this, one feels like laughing. Seeing the many thousands of yaks and wild asses That cover the empty plains, The nomads' claim to own lots of cattle Just sounds like bragging. The wild ass foals frisk and roll about [138a], The young wild yaks play, low, and drink from their mothers. As one watches all this, the day passes, And love and compassion well up in one's heart. The lakes, blossoming with a multitude of flowers, Are adorned with many kinds of wild ducks. With these sights before one's eyes, One is always joyful and filled with delight. At the tips ofblue, white, scarlet, and saffron flowers, Meditation at Mount Machen 161 Red and yellow-striped bees soar, hover and swirl. When they buzz and hum, gathering nectar from flower to flower, The yogin longs to wander throughout the land. Here are various kinds of edible plants, Nettles and chives, and the bodies of wild animals that have died natural deaths; 12 There are so many that one could live on these alone, should provisions run out; One has confidence that sustenance will appear. When one has a stone hut And a natural abundance of slate, water and firewood, All the necessities are gathered: It's not true to say one needs attendants. Here dwells the supreme deva Magyal Around whom many devas are always gathered. Sympathetic to those who practice the Dharma, They assist all work in accord with the teachings. At this mountain, good fortune and prosperity come together; Nothing inauspicious is ever even heard of For those who practice meditation in this place The sun of meditation experiences and realization will dawn. All those who wish to attain the level of gods and men Should stay in this divine abode, Mount Magyal.

By the power of this praise ofMount Machen, May all people and animals near this mountain range [138b] Be happy morning, afternoon, evening-Be happy constantly, throughout the day and night. The following morning at the break of dawn, I had this experience: a white man came to call me; I followed him to a camp of hundreds of white tents, at the center of which was pitched an enchanting tent, immense and very beautiful. When I went inside it, I saw a great king seated on a high throne. In front of him, to the right, was a throne where I was told to sit. When I did so, the king stood up and presented me with a long immaculate scarf and a magnificent hat. Then he said, \"It is very wonderful that you adhere to the life-style of our holy predecessors, singing songs of the sacred teachings. I name you 'Bard of the Land of Snows'. It is most kind of you to leave thousands of songs as the heritage of Tibet. They will bring immense benefit to faithful disciples. Please continue to concentrate on medita-tion practice and benefit the Dharma and all beings. At the same time, express in song the meaning of the teachings of the Victorious One; I promise to assist you with any of your spiritual pursuits.\" Following this, I supplicated my masters every day and visualized receiving the four empowerments. Letting my awareness rest, open and relaxed, I merged with the vast sky-like emptiness [139a]. One day, during my meditation practice, I saw many valleys, countries and Pure Realms that I had never seen before. Another time, I saw clearly a couple of yellow ducks and a wild ass that lived on the banks of the two lakes nearby. Wondering whether this could be real, I went outside and looked. They were right there, ex-actly as I had seen them in my meditation. In this way, every day while I was resting in meditation I had many experiences and visions as clear as images in a mirror. One day a bee entered my hut, buzzing sweetly. In a joyful frame of mind, I sang this imitation of its buzz: A rna, A me, my friend the bee-How do you do? Where are you from? This yogin is delighted-His friend has come. Loneliness-suddenly gone! The sun ofhappiness--suddenly come! Sing now, once more, your long, slow song. As I said this, the bee landed on the edge of my seat. Folding its wings, bending its head down and lowering its antennae, it made a gesture like bowing. Coming closer, it touched its head to my robe, as if paying homage. Then it flew into the air and, performing a dance, sang these lines [139b]: Ema! Guru! Are you well? We bees are very well, indeed! My father, my father's father, And his father before him, All were singers-and so am I! I've heard stories That in the past, some of your singers, Such asjetsun Kalden and others, 13 Sometimes made offerings of songs When they felt happy. When we bees sing, we sing as we please, Singing our long, slow songs over the empty plains. If such offerings are pleasing to you, master, Why should we not sing? If we sing songs as offerings to the teacher, The lasting merit of that act will be an enduring harvest. 0 greatJetsun, please listen a while To this, our offering of song."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Flying higher up, it continued: When this thirsty bee drinks the fme nectar From brilliant wildflowers, it spreads its wmgs And performs a joyous dance throughout the air, The celestial pathway, to celebrate you, Celestial one who sings joyous songs. When this bee, once ruled by ignorance, Can drink the fine nectar of your wondrous teachings, And give rise to real experience and realization, It, too, when in secluded places, Will wish to sing songs of realization. The bee came lower again, and continued: Now this singer must return to its homeland. Until we meet again, farewell. From time to time, I shall return, And when I'm happy, I'll offer songs For you to hear time and again. I ask that I be kept in your protection, Jetsun-kept safe from obstacles in this very life, And throughout all of my lives to come [140a]. In response, I sang: My friend the bee, come back again, And sing your songs for me, the yogin. And once I have reached enlightenment, I pray. that you, bee, will join my retinue. If you must go, circle once around this yogm, And be off, fly right back to your home. Thus I sang to refresh my mind. Delighted, the bee made two circumarnbulations, one clock-wise and one counterclockwise, and flew away without a backward glance. Meditation at Mount Machen 163 For my own benefit I also sang about the signs of the path as mentioned in the King of Samadhi Sutra, 14 and how these signs arise when one lives in remote mountain retreats farther than one day away from villages, and one prac-tices the sacred Dharma in accordance with the Buddha's words: I bow down to the compassionate Buddha: Grant your blessings so that I may keep to secluded places. If, having understood impermanence And the defects of samsara, You live alone in isolated places To practice perfecdy the sacred Dharma, There are ten benefits, As taught in the King of Samadhi Sutra: Your activities will be fewer and fewer, And you will be far removed from noise and distractions. You will be free from quarrels; You will be also free from harm. You will not let obscuring emotions mcrease, Nor create causes for discord [140b]. You will always enjoy perfect tranquility, Keeping your body, speech, and mind under control. Living in a way that is conducive to liberation You will quickly reach complete freedom. The same sutra further states that If you remain in solitary places You will attain divine sight and divine hearing, The capacity to know the minds of other beings, Recollection of your former lives, And other miraculous powers."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"164 The Life of Shabkar You will perceive the innumerable Buddhas Of the east, south, west, and north; And never be parted from them. Through divine hearing, you will receive All the sacred teachings that are taught By these Buddhas throughout the ten directions; Thus you will continuously listen to the Dharma. Never forgetting any of these teachings, You will teach the sacred Dharma to all beings. Fully comprehending their meaning, You will know the acts of all sentient beings Throughout the past, present, and future. As it was taught, so also you, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Should remain alone in secluded places And you will surely achieve the great and lasting aim. May everyone who hears this song Keep to remote places and practice Dharma. After this, my diligence grew stronger and I worked harder at my meditation, merging with the ultimate nature of mind. One evening I had this experience: a black whirl-wind appeared in my room. I shouted, \"Go away!\" and spat on it. The whirlwind turned into a terrifying black man with long fangs (141 a]. Ferociously biting his lip, he looked extremely angry. Raising up a sword with a short double-edged blade, he said, \"Until today, no one ever spat on me. In retaliation for being spat upon by you, a disgusting yogin, I will enter your body and stab my knife into your heart. I'll be damned if I don't kill you!\" He instantly turned into a black pea, entered through my mouth, and dis-appeared inside me. I thought, ''What a weird hallucination! Well, if you're going to do that, here is my answer!\" And, in a single moment, I visualized my body as being an indestructible house of meteoric iron. Holding my breath, I focused intensely on the letter Ram below my navel, and I visualized an intensely hot fire arising from it. As I did so, the black man made himself grow bigger, gradually filling my chest from the bottom up, until I felt that my body was going to burst. Still, I increased the flames and kept them burning. Unable to bear it, he cried out, \"Don't bum me! A-tsa tfa! I'm being burned alive!\" and moaned piteously. I replied, \"It seems that you have murdered many meditators who came here and many patrons of this region. Now, there's no escape for you!\" and I made the fire blaze even stronger, adding, \"I shall roast you alive and send your consciousness into the absolute expanse!\" His voice grew meek as he said (14lb], \"A-tsa tsa! Don't you, a Dharma practitioner, have compassion for me? Don't bum me; let me go! From now on, I shall never harm anyone!\" I replied, \"Well, then, swear that you will never again harm visitors or local patrons.\" After he had sworn many times, I said, \"I have never had a revolting ghost like you sneak inside me. I'll let you go out-not through my mouth but through my anus.\" Holding the upper breath, I forced him down, and I visualized him coming out through my anus. He came out, looking like a corpse the size of a handspan, and fell onto the floor. He grew to the size of a man: his hair and beard had been scorched and he was nearly dead. Mter he had recovered for a few moments, he again turned into a whirlwind and went away, spinning slowly. The following day, my whole body felt wob-bly and strange, and my chest uncomfortable, but, by doing the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva, I felt well again. The next evening a white man appeared to me, laughing, and said, \"Last night a bad person from our family went to"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"test you, but you put him to shame. He told us about it, and he will not harm anyone again [l42a]. Forgive him for being so rude as to enter you. In the future, please don't forget to keep him under your spiritual protection.\" A pair of yellow ducks had been living on the banks of the two lakes in front of my hermitage. One afternoon, an eagle killed one of the ducks and the other duck fled, terrified. Since they had kept me company for so long, I felt saddened, and I sang this song: E rna! Marvelous and wonderful birds, From your bodies of precious gold, Wings of white conch and turquoise opened. Your beaks and feet were black as bees, And your webbed toes were like a lattice. Garlands ofberyl were draped Around the vase of your jeweled necks; Duck and drake, you were a pair. Your wings shone with a dazzling splendor, Your melodious voices sounded in clear tones. When you came, with joyful dancing movements On the vast, celestial pathway of the skies, You were divine birds, eminent monarchs of fowl, Whose qualities, far surpassing those of other birds, Captivated irresistibly the minds of those who beheld you. When you alighted on our aquamarine lakes, It was more beautiful than placing a vase Made of gold from thejambu River Upon a mandala of white grains and blue turquoise. Meditation at Mount Machen 165 While you remained on the shore of the lakes, You delighted the spirit of this yogin Even more than the company ofDharma friends. But today, suddenly, this very afternoon [142b], One of you was killed by a wicked eagle; One of you flew away. Alas! The unique jewels of the lake are lost. Unadorned, the lake is no better than water in a cauldron. I, the yogin, am bereft of friends, No better off than a widower. Left desolate, my grief is fierce indeed. Compassion for my old companions, Those two ducks, brings tears to my eyes; This prayer comes to my lips: \"There is no happiness in samsara. Birth, old age, sickness, death: There is so very much suffering. \"To the west is the Buddhafield called Blissful Realm. By the power of whatever merit I possess, May my faithful friend, The duck who was killed today, Not be reborn within samsara, But be reborn in the Blissful Realm.\" So sad, so sad! How strange is samsara! Yesterday, the two ducks, male and female, Flew and played near the banks of the lakes. Today, one was killed by an eagle And the other, terrified, flew off to another place. The link which once united them Has been severed; And they have gone apart."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"166 Th£ Life of Shabkar Today this old man, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Found a teacher of impermanence. Understanding the indications given by this good teacher I found certainty in the Buddha's teachings. All things are subject to impermanence, and I myself am also subject to it. If my clinging to permanence is strong, It will sever my chance to practice the Dharma. Now I must strive to practice in secluded places. Thus I sang to encourage myself to practice. One day, when I was living happily, at ease, a gang of bandits from Golok swept down upon me [143a]. When they started rifling through my provision bags, I told them, \"You don't need to look for my provisions; they are here. One of you can make tea for lunch, and after we have fmished drinking it, if you need some provisions let's talk it over, and you may have some.\" We had the tea and talked about different things. Mterward, I showed them all my provi-sions and, giving them half, I sang this song: Surpassing even the wish-granting gem, Master, remain as the ornament on the crown of my head. No matter what joy or sorrow befalls Tsogdruk Rangdrol the yogin, It is my nature to sing, So listen to my song. Though you have now obtained a human birth, It is hard to obtain again and again. No one can say when you will die: Death may strike tomorrow. Good and evil actions Bring their results without fail. At death, whatever happens accords With whatever you have done. If you have performed wholesome, virtuous acts, There will be happiness, birth in the higher realms. If you have done unwholesome, unvirtuous acts, There will be suffering, birth in the three lower realms. Right now, when there is the choice, To be happy or to suffer, Don't indulge yourselves in unvirtuous acts But strive as best you can To perform virtuous deeds, great and small. It is wrong to take what has not been g~ven, So refrain from doing that. In particular, when stolen, the food of a practitioner Is like poison: to eat it will cause your own destruction. If you cannot curtail your cravings and learn to be satisfied, You may take for yourself the wealth of the whole country And still be wanting more. Once you've become ruled by craving [143b], In the end you will die by the knife. If you sustain anything, better sustain your own life. c·urtail your craving and be content. Today you have been good to me; You made me practice generosity and patience. Even ordinary possessions have become supreme. E m~ This yogin is fortunate! I know nothing of magic and evil spells.

If you want some meat, this is clean and wholesome.\" Saying this, he gave me several hunks of meat and prostrated himsel£ All of them asked for my blessings and said, \"A good practitioner is someone like you. May you live for a hundred years! May your health be good! Don't forget to keep us under your spiri-tual protection.\" Mter they had gone, I sang this song: Root teacher, endowed with blessings, Bless me that I keep impermanence in mind. Yesterday, in the morning, In the foothills of the snowy ranges of Machen, Wild asses and yaks lay around on the plain, at ease. Some ate grass; the little ones played. On the lakes, white and golden ducks assembled. Some stretched their wings and cried out with melodious voices. The yellow flowers outside my doorstep l.a.ughed and danced. Yesterday, this little hut, my dwelling place, was full of food; Leaving the bigger pieces, I ate the smaller ones. Trouble was something unheard of Everyone was happy and joyful [144a]. But this very day, near noontime, Eight bandits with malicious intent Who claimed to come from Golok Appeared suddenly out of an untraveled valley, Meditation at Mount Machen 167 And hard times fell upon us mountain dwellers: The wild asses and yaks stampeded up and down the hills. The birds flew away to other places. The flowers at my door were trampled by their horses, And the bandits themselves stole the food from my hut. Today the teacher of impermanence Came to visit the beggar Tsogdruk Rangdrol. Do you see how all things are impermanent? Don't take them to be permanent, Renunciate of the mountains! The next day, thirteen other bandits turned up; they prostrated themselves with faith and respect, and having asked for my blessing, presented me with fresh provisions. I answered their many questions about where I came from and where I was heading. When they were about to leave, I sang this song: Master and Precious Ones, Bestow your blessings Upon my body, speech, and mind, and those of others. You faithful bandits gathered here, Listen to the song of this yogin. I am a wandering hermit of the mountains And my name is Tsogdruk Rangdrol. My homeland is Lower Rekong, The name of my village is Shohong. From childhood, I had faith In the teachings of the Old and New Schools And I followed many qualified masters. In particular, for five years without interruption I followed the King of the Dharma, Ngawang Wang,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"168 7he Life of Shabkar Receiving many oral instructions on the sutras and tantras. By the grace of that immensely kind master, I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, have understood liD permanence, The defects of samsara, and that all sentient beings are my own parents [144b]. From deep within me, the yearning welled up To attain Buddhahood for the sake of all beings; And, thinking that for attaining this I should do spiritual practice, I completely gave up the concerns of this life. I wandered from one solitary place to another, And several years went by. At the retreat ofTsonying I stayed for three years; Afterward I came to this sacred place. Such is the story of this yogin. The faith you all have in me Is the result of your past karma and aspirations. This precious human birth is difficult to fmd. Life is short; we soon must die. Birth in the western Blissful Realm Will be full of happiness and joy. If you act virtuously, you will be reborn there. So, you must do that, 0 faithful ones. Birth in the eighteen hells below Will be full of intense suffering. If you act wrongly, you will be reborn there. So, don't live by banditry, 0 faithful ones! I don't know if, in future, I will come to your place, But if I come, you must look after me. For now, go in peace; I shall pray that you all have long lives, free of sickness. When I had sung this, they bowed down and asked for my blessing. As they set out, some of them said, \"How amazing! That man is Orgyen in person! 15 How fortunate to have met him just once! Among all the unfortunate we are the most fortunate! Those men who came here yesterday were not good people! This yogin is not one of the usual lot who roam around here. You can tell just by the way he looks at you. He's not one to come to the Machen Glacier just because he can't fmd any place else to stay. Just see what happens to those other bandits later. It'll be nothing good!\" [145a]. After they had left, I sang this song: Master,yUiam, and dakinis, I ask that you grant your blessings. Yesterday, at noontime, Faithless bandits took away my provlSlons. But this morning, Faithful bandits replenished my supplies. Joy and sorrow are like travelers on the roadside--Suddenly come and suddenly gone. Before this, I was not eating much; I wasn't even offering as much as a feast tonna to the deities. Those provisions I'd been hoarding at great pains Turned into supplies for all those bandits. When the food is there, it should be eaten; This, I didn't know before today.

Give up plans for the future! That year, it didn't rain during the summer months, and many of the lakes and pools not fed by streams dried up. This was especially true of the smaller of the two lakes in front of my hermit-age. When I went to that lake, I could see thou-sands oflittle creatures, tadpoles and fry, as many as millet seeds in an urn of chang. Using my leather bag, I first carried some water from the large lake to the small one. Then, cupping my hands, I lifted the little creatures out of the reced-ing lake, poured them into the bag, and took them to the large lake. I made about thirty trips. I think that in this way I was able to save a myriad lives (145b]. For those that died, I recited many prayers of aspiration, such as: By the power of all my meritorious deeds, symbolized by this one, May all these dead creatures Gain existence as human or celestial beings in their next lives, And, by practicing the divine Dharma, may they attain Buddhahood. An owl used to come every night and perch on a rock above the place where I was staying. Its hooting disturbed me very much. Late one night, I got s-ome pebbles and hid under a rock overhang near its perch. When the owl came, I could hardly keep from chuckling to myself I waited, thinking I would let it hoot and then toss a pebble at it. It stayed silent, and I wondered if it had become aware that I was there. Just as I had decided to toss a pebble whether it hooted or not, it went ''Whoa!\" loudly. Meditation at Mount Machen 169 I let it go ''Whoa!\" twice, then, just as it was about to do it again, I threw a pebble. It hit the bird at the very moment it was going ''Whoo-oo!\" and I dissolved into laughter. Then I thought, \"You say that you are prac-ticing the view, but you can't bear even the irritation caused by the hoot of an owl-that's pathetic! What has become of your 'view'? You think that you meditate on compassion, but what if that owl dies as a result of your throwing a stone at it-how will that be? Perhaps this par-ticular owl was not your mother in a previous life? Perhaps this owl does not require your com-passion? [ 146a] . \"You are a practitioner who wanders in the mountains, with no fixed home. Here is one single owl, who is a permanent resident of this place, and tonight, unable to endure a few off-key hoots, you've picked a fight with it! \"Look what you've done! Tonight it has become clear that you have failed to develop even the most meager compassion, realization of emptiness, or any other good quality.\" Having thus made myself feel utterly ashamed, I re-turned to my hermitage. I promised myself that even if the owl came back and hooted right above my head, I would do nothing. But the owl, terrified, didn't come back; I heard him hooting somewhere down in the lower part of the valley. Fallowing this, after each session of resting in the nature of mind, I would do intense medi-tation on compassion. Subsequently, without having to cultivate it, a strong, uncontrived, almost unbearable compassion was born in me. Every day I made ardent prayers to the Three jewels for the sake of sentient beings, and made many dedication prayers so that I might benefit all beings, my former mothers, in this lifetime. One day, through the connection that had been created by these prayers, while resting evenly in the true nature of mind, I had a vision. I saw the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"170 The Life of Shabkar Buddha surrounded by all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions and by many sages and accomplished great beings of India and Tibet.

One night I dreamed that I came to a re-mote mountain wilderness where I had never been, an exceedingly pleasant place like a celes-tial land. Sitting there, at ease, I sang many spiritual songs by Jetsun Milarepa and other exalted beings. My mind became filled with the thought ofjetsun Milarepa and his spiritual sons, and, as I prayed to them with great yearning, they appeared before me, smiling and laughing. With great tenderness, Mila placed his two hands upon my head, and, spat, as a blessing (148b]. At that moment, all my deluded perceptions ceased, and I rested serenely in the vivid state of Mahamudra, free of discursive thoughts and adorned with bliss, clarity, and nonthought.

Thus, in the style of the spiritual songs ofJetsun Kalden Gyatso, playfully using tongue-twisting words, with pure intention, I sang these songs for my own edification and for the benefit of others. Then, remembering my experiences and visions, I felt joy and spoke these words: I bow down at the feet of the Dharma King. E rna! Listen, fortunate spiritual sons! Mind, once settled in samsara and nirvana, Experiences various joys and sorrows. The nature of mind is the entrance To the great mansion that is the absolute expanse. When this door opens, one sees the true face Of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions; One actually comes to understand everything about The happiness and suffering of sentient beings in samsara. Following my lama's teachings, I, an old monk, Have tried to open the entrance to the vast expanse of mind, But the door moved just a crack. For me to say that I've seen the faces of Buddhas, As many as there are stars in the sky, Would be an enormous lie. Still, from time to time, I have beheld The faces of my tutelary deities: In dreams, in meditation, in reality. For me to say that I see the happiness and suffering, The good and bad, that happens to all beings Would be an enormous lie. Still, from time to time, I have seen Something about people's past and future. But I wasn't able to open the door all the way, I got just a glimpse through a crack, Not seeing much-It waxes and wanes, this old monk's clairvoyance! King of Dharma, grant your blessings that, In this, the last part of my life, I may complete the opening of this entrance, And witness wondrous things [150b]. May all spiritual children Who hear this fmd benefit in it. One day, to refresh my spirits, I walked to a summit of the Machen Range and, relaxing my mind completely, I looked around in all direc-tions. My mind opened up, becoming clearer and clearer. I sat, keeping my back straight, and looked straight ahead into the infmite expanse of the sky. My mind blended with the sky, becoming indistinguishable from it. Completely at rest in the natural state of mind-empty, luminous, without taking things as real-1 sang this song, in a state like space, an unlimited, transparent, all-pervading expanse. Without a center, without a border, The luminous expanse of awareness that encompasses all-This vivid, bright vastness: Natural, primordial presence.

Sky, awareness, absolute space, Indistinguishably intermixed: Immense, infmitely vast-The ground of samsara, The ground of nirvana. To remain, day and night, in this state-To enter this state easily-this is joy [15la]. Emaho! Yogin! In this state, You must simply remain: Resting loosely-Letting yourself open-Attaining dharmakaya-Letting nirmanakaya come to pass-Phet! A! Ah! Then, I rested one-pointedly in the evenness of a sky-like emptiness. All mental wildness and dullness, gross and subde, vanished naturally, like clouds vanishing in the sky. Like the sun shining in a clear autumn sky, the luminous emptiness that is the true nature of mind was laid bare. In a state without center, without limits, empty like space, all phenom-ena-forms and sounds-were present in spon-taneity, vivid as the sun, moon, planets and stars. Mind and phenomena blended completely in a single taste. Meditation at Mount Machen l 7 5 Friend and enemy-no difference; gold and stone-no difference; this life and the next-no difference; mind and sky-no difference. Hav-ing seen this for myself, I was ready to sit among the glorious sky-like yogins. One afternoon, I saw, one after the other, two royal eagles flying high in the sky toward the abode of my guru. I thought, \"If I had a pair of miraculous wings, I could fly in an instant to my master's place like those two eagles-but I can't.\" Overwhelmed by recollection of my master, his consort, my Dharma brothers and sisters, and all my vajra companions, I sang this plaintive song of remembering the guru [151 b]: I saw two mighty eagles, Royal birds, flying one after another, In the direction of my guru's dwelling. The memory of the place, my guru, and my friends Arises vividly in my mind; Thinking of our frrst meeting, tears fill my eyes. Ushu! If only he were here, right now! The longing to meet him bums in me like frre. Again and again I remember my master's excellence, His great kindness, And fervent devotion wells up from deep within. His wisdom mind was lofty like the sky, His compassion was impartial, like the sun and moon, His boundless good qualities were like miraculous jewels. Most kind lord, you fulfilled all aspirations!

By the power of this yearning song of remembrance, May I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Who was always cared for by my guru, Continue always to be cared for by him. Not long after this, over two arm-spans of snow fell during eight days and nights without interruption. For many days it was that deep snow which set the boundaries of my retreat; I wasn't even able to boil any tea. I drank melted snow mixed with a little tsampa, and rested evenly in meditation. In earlier years, during the times when I was contemplating such things as the difficulty of obtaining a free, well-favored human birth, the . unpredictability of the time of death, the defects of samsara, and the fact that all beings were once my parents-while I was practicing to the best of my capabilities, roaming through uninhabited places, glaciers and mountain slopes, trying to regard others as dearer than myself, keeping to the most humble station, wearing worn-out clothes, and forgetting about food, clothing and conversations [15 2b ]-I did not have very many strong thoughts about my mother. When thoughts of her did come to mind while practic-ing, I was able to use some meditation tech-niques as antidotes to settle my mind again. But while I was staying on the slopes of Mount Machen, I must have had a premonition that my mother was about to die. One evening, when eight months and nine days had gone by and all my provisions were exhausted, I began thinking about my mother, ye~ing to see her again as if thirsting for water. Though I tried and tried to stop thinking about her, the thoughts would not subside. I realized that over nine years had passed since I had last seen her, and that this year corresponded to the prediction made by Terton Sonam Nyentrak Rinpoche about her life span. I thought, \"Is she still alive? If so, I must go to see her once more. The last time I saw her, afraid she might not consent to let me go away, I purposely lied to her. Because of my lie, when I left I wasn't even able to say good-bye properly. \"Nothing is sure about birth and death. Whether or not I actually succeed in seeing her again, I shall go to her.

See Kongtrul's rgya chen bka'i mdzod, vol. 12, p. 10. 9. The mighty Amnye Machen Range, the \"Great Peacock Ancestor\" (a myes rma chen), also called Magyal Pomra (rma rgyal spom ra), or Machen Pomra (rma chen spom ra), stands in the great curve of the Machu River (which becomes the Yellow River in China), to the east of two great lakes, known in Mongolian as Tsaring Nor and Oring Nor (Tib. slga rangs mtslw and sngo rangs mtslw). This sacred mountain is said to be the abode ofMachen Pomra, a powerful protector of the Dharma who, after having being Meditation at Mount Machen 1 77 subjugated by Guru Padmasambhava, became a Bodhisattva of the tenth spiritual level (bhumi). In his History of the Dharma Protectors (dam can bstan srung rgya mtslw'i mam tlzar, vol. 1, p. 142), Lelung Shepai Dorje (sle lu.ng bdzad pa'i rdo rje, b. 1697) pre-sents Magyal Pomra as the chief of 360 surrounding mountain-gods, led by four main ones, one in each of the four directions (among whom is gnyan chen thang lha, in the north). Magyal Pomra is said to be married to Gungmen Lhari (gung sman lha n) and to have nine sons and nine daughters. When, at Samye, Guru Padmasambhava bound under oath the devas and rakshas, he omitted to subju-gate Machen Pomra. The Bonpos rejoiced greatly, but after Guru Padrnasambhava made the summon-ing mudra, Machen came, arrogantly putting one foot on top of Hepori at Samye and keeping one foot in Amdo. Guru Padrnasambhava bound Machen under oath, yet the latter remained one of the haughtiest among the wild spirits. There are eight great peaks in the Machen range, of which the three most prominent are Amnye Machen itself, in the center, the lowest of the three, at 6282 meters; Chenrezi (spyan ras gzigs), to the south, the medium peak; and Dradul Lung Shok (dgra 'dul rlunggslwg), to the north, the highest. It takes a week to perform the circumambulation of the whole range on foot, and more than a month when making pros-trations the entire way, as many faithful pilgrims do. Pilgrims gather in especially great numbers every twelve years, in the Horse Year. See K. Buffetrille (1992) and Galen Rowell (1984). 10. The ruins of Shabkar's stone hermitage are still clearly recognizable (see Buffetrille, 1992). Pil-grims who perform the circumambulation of Amnye Machen often visit the site, which is located at a place called Mowatowa (mo bagto ba) on the west side of the range, in between the Height of the Supreme Horse (rta mclwg gong pa) and before the Great Hanging Brocade Image (gos sku chen mo), a cliff of various hues, said to be the door curtain ofMagyal's palace. 11. The Jambu Riksha, the Rose-apple Tree (Eugenia jambolana), is a legendary tree that grew on the banks of the \"Ever-cool Lake,\" Anavatapta or Manasarovar. Its fruit falling into the lake made a sound like '1ambu!\" This gave the nameJambudvipa to the southern continent. 12.

Another day, on a plain, a fierce wild yak, a drong, 2 suddenly got to its feet in front of me [155a]. Grunting and raising its tail, lightning-quick, it charged at me. I ran toward it, too. It rushed headlong at me, its horns lowered, and when it was only a few steps away, it lowered its head even further. Just then, I jumped at it, and landed between its horns. As the drong tossed its head up, I was around its neck, my legs braced against the two horns, my hands clutching at its mane. Praying to the guru and the 1breejewels, aiming at the drong's heart I shouted \"Ki!\" so strongly that the drong, startled and terrified, ran about fifty yards3 with me on its back. It then shook itself with great force, scattering like hay my backpack, my walk-ing stick, a small drum, and one tuft of its hair with me still grabbing onto it. Without a single glance back, the drong ran off. Having suffered no injury, I jumped to my feet. Shouting \"Ku!\" I chased the drong, which 179 took off to the top of a small hillock, stopped, released a turd, and turned around to inspect me. While retying my bundle, I sang this song: Master, precious ones, and yidam deities [155b], Dakinis and Dharma protectors, remain above my head. Fierce wild yak, you, the drong, tum round and Listen to this yogin's song. First, when you charged like lightning, intending to kill me, an innocent yogin, You looked brave And I, the yogin, was scared Next, when you were on the point of crushing me, And I, the yogin, rode on your back unharmed, You lost your bravery and were struck with fear. In the end, like a thieving dog in flight, You fled without looking back. Drong, today you were worse than dead. Your great strength has been of little use. How embarrassing that you couldn't crush me! The horns that have grown on your head Set you apart, and you live alone. Having kept a long plait on my head,"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"180 77ze Life of Shabkar I too live alone. Don't run away, come back here! Let's compete in strength and intelligence; Let's see the difference between man and beast. Great is the compassion of the precious ones! · Great is the power of the dakinis and dharrnapalas! Today a yogin endowed with intelligence Defeated a wild yak endowed with strength. I am not sure yet Whether this is dream or real, But even if it is a dream, it's a rare one for sure To thus go riding on a drong! If it's real, then anyone who might have seen this today Would have been entirely amazed! Isn't it astounding and fortunate To have escaped thus from between the horns of a drong? Having sung this, I beat my small drum and shouted \"Ku!\" Thereupon the drongraised its tail and ran off to the far end of the valley [156a]. I put my bundle on my back and set off again. A little further, I said to myself, \"Who knows when I'll die? I must leave a testament for my disciples and patrons. What kind of testament should it be?\" And I sang this Testament of a Yogin: May all the Victorious Ones who are free from the fear of death Lead the way for me--a vassal of the Lord of Death. Disciples and patrons who have not yet been struck down by death, Listen to this song, a testament made on the eve of death. The name \"death\" is proclaimed to all like the sound of thunder, And when the Lord ofDeath strikes, irrevocably, like lightning, To try and pay him ransom4 or perform healing rituals is of no avail. Death is certain, but the time it arrives is not certain-just like me. Without being attached to this life, think of death, and, To be joyful at death, put all your strength into the sublime Dharma. On the eve of death I do not need to leave a lengthy testament. The songs I sang when I was healthy and spared by death Are the testament left for the time of death: act in accordance with them. Even the Buddhas who achieved the deathless vajra body, Gave the appearance of death-needless to say what will happen to people like ourselves. Think of death as the teacher of rmpermanence, And do not be afflicted when I fall under the power of death. But until the very moment you meet with death, persevere in virtue. Tsogdruk Rangdrol has now set out on the path of death. Unafraid of death, he goes to the Realm of Truejoy [156b]. Thus I sang, lighthearted. With autumn coming, all the mountain heights became blanketed with snow, and drongs and other wild animals descended to the low-lands. At one point, I had to walk around a group of dangerous drongs who were lying across the path, blocking it. One night, I stayed in an empty valley, with deer calling at the upper end, foxes yapping at the lower end, and owls hooting in between. It sounded as if I were in the bardo. Traveling on the path that leads to central Tibet, I came upon the remains of some traders' pack animals. Exhausted and left behind, they had just been killed and eaten by wolves. Look-"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"ing around, I saw about ten wolves moving on a mountain slope. I shouted \"Ki!\" and they took off, glancing back as they fled. When I arrived near the White Rock Mon-key Fortress, 5 some devout people asked, ''Where is your home? What is your name?\" I replied with this song: As a lion cub, I stayed in the den; When my strength developed, I followed my lioness mother, Roaming the glacier's heights. I fully trained my body And have no fear of falling over the glacier's edge. Now I live near the crest of white snow peaks. My name is Lion, the king ofbeasts. As a little bird, I stayed in the nest; When my feathers grew, I flew behind my mother bird; High above in the sky, I fully trained my wmgs And have no fear of falling into the abyss below [157a]. Now I live on the cornices of red cliffs. My name is Eagle, the king of birds. As a young vagabond, I stayed in my homeland, Then I served at the lotus feet of my master. Having entered the door of Dharma, I fully trained my mind And have no fear of falling to the lower realms. Now I live in mountain solitudes; My name is Tsogdruk Rangdrol, the renunciate. Mter I had sung this, everyone became filled with faith. Upon reaching the White Rock Monkey Fortress, Trakar Drel Dzong, I met the hermit Alak Gonpo, who had come from Labrang Tashikhyil and practiced the ritual of the Six-armed Mahakala, the protector of this holy place. I met too the nun Dechen (who used to recite by At White Rock Monkey Fortress 181 heart the Sutra qf Great liberation), 6 a faithful old nun from Gyalu Shabunar, the monk Chokyap ofBongtak with his relative, and all the patrons. We talked a lot, and when I asked after my mother, they said that, so far as they knew, she was still alive. \"If it is so, I shall go to see her again.\" When I said this, they began to plead with me, arguing, \"We are so fortunate that you came to this holy place; you must stay for a few months as the object of our veneration. The dead of winter is not a time for traveling. It will be much better to go and meet your mother after the new year, when the earth warms up, the mountains and valleys become green, and the blue cuckoo sings sweetly\" [157b]. Another patron asked how old my mother was. I told him that if she lived, she would be fifty-three at the new year. \"Your mother is not very old,\" he said. \"Don't behave like us worldly people; relax, we will take good care of you.\" They thus insisted that I postpone my de-parture; unable to resist, I had to stay. They gave me all I needed. To benefit their minds, I gave them teachings on the law of karmic cause and effect, and sang many spiritual songs as well, which turned everyone's mind to the sublime Dharma. From Alak Gonpo, a person orna-mented by the Three Trainings who was living in this holy place, I received the transmission of the texts for the ritual of the Six-armed Mahakala. Then my spiritual son, Kunzang Rangdrol, arrived from Tsonying. I gave him the various transmissions and explanations that he needed. My kind root teacher Tendzin Nyirna Rinpoche had come back from the Five-peaked Mountain and gone to Tserpa Mountain, at the far end of the Blue Lake. He sent me the following letter in verse, a letter worthy of placing above my head. I take refuge in the excellent Three Jewels. Bless all mountain-dwelling vagabonds! Enjoying the excellent fruition of his past deeds, Has my son, the young lion, been well? Did your experience and realization grow? Did you feel no more attachment to body and life Than you would to a rotting carcass?"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"182 The Life of Shabkar Were you harassed by fierce bandits? [158a] Did weariness and renunciation grow in your mind? Did your compassion and loving-kindness increase? Did you meditate, first equating yourself with others, then exchanging yourself for them? Did you don the armor of patience? Did phenomena dawn as your mind? Did you understand the play of illusion? Are you sad at the condition of samsara? Do you bear in mind the qualities of liberation? Did you stop distinguishing between enemies and friends? Does your Dharma keep up with circumstances? Does your Dharma always win? Did you understand the warnings of impermanence? Did you cut the ties of clinging to permanence? Did you merge space and awareness? Did you conquer the kingdom beyond birth? Did you have any trouble on the way? Were there any dangers from wild beasts, narrow paths, and rivers? Did your meditation progress? Are you well now? By the compassion of the deities and the guru, We all, master and disciples, Arrived safely at the Five-peaked Mountain, And thought, \"Could we have wished for better than this?\" As for my way of wearing the armor, I thought, at best, to leave there the heap of my bones, Or at least to stay a few years. But due to karma accumulated in the past And the conditions we met, one of my attendants, To whom the place and water were not suitable, Was on the verge of death; Therefore, driven by compassion, We had to leave. By the grace of the ThreeJewels We met on the way A noble official with the pure mind of a Bodhisattva. By the kindness of this good person [158b) We came back without difficulty or fatigue. At present I dwell at ease On the mountain at the end of the lake, And after the Mother has donned her mantle7 I wish to visit the holy place. Ifl feel happy in the Mother's palace I intend to remain there. Son, what do you think of this? If we can meet and converse, that would be the best. If not, tell me clearly your thoughts. Simply to have something to offer to your eyes, I send you a few presents And a white scarf of auspiciousness. In answer to his letter I offered him this song in verse: Lord, precious and authentic guru, Great is my joy that you have returned safely. Your son will now relate to you, lord, What he did at the Magyal Mountain. Having left behind my native place, I was well, For at Magyal there were no attachments nor aversions."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Since family and friends were far away, I was well, For there was no one for me to look after. Having offered or given away All my wealth and possessions, I was well, For I had nothing to hoard and guard. Since there was a massive stone cavern Above my head, I was well, For I did not suffer from heat or cold. Since dry yak dung was easy to fmd, I was well, For I was never short of fuel. Since my patrons provided me with provisions, I was well, For I was never short offood. By the blessings of the lord guru and the Three Jewels, I was well, For I never suffered from illness. Having meditated with diligence, I was well, For I found the confidence that death will bejoyful [159a]. It is excellent that both father and son are alive and well; In due time we will talk about the Dharma and the world. Through the son having told of his well-being to the father, May all sentient beings, our mothers, be well and happy. E rna! PreciousJetsun Rinpoche, Protect me until enlightenment! I shall now relate to you in detail How I came and stayed at that glacier of immaculate whiteness. Distractions having increased In the happy secluded grove ofTsonying, At White Rock Monkey Fortress 183 The progress of my spiritual practice dimmed Like moonlight vanishing with the coming of sunlight. I therefore thought to go to the solitudes Of the white snows of Magyal To meditate there with my whole being. So, I left, Carrying food, clothing, and all necessities. One afternoon, stopping on the way, I saw eighty wild asses in a meadow by the road, Something I had never seen before. While watching them playing, carefree and frolicking about, I thought, ''What a pity; none of them has ever heard the sound of Dharma.\" Then, when I began to sing the mani, Not only did the wild asses not run away, They came closer and gathered near me. While they were thus listening to me, free offear, I proclaimed the Dharma in one verse and prayed for them. My two escorts, filled with amazement and faith, Were moved to tears, and prostrated themselves many times. The day I first saw the summit of the snow peak, The arc of a rainbow appeared in the sky And a rain of orange flowers fell. The day I reached the foot of the mountains [159b], Extraordinarily melodious sounds issued from the glacier, Like the roar of a thunder-dragon, And I felt extreme joy. After I had stayed there for a month, One day, as I was meditating, In a vision a white man invited me to come, And led me to a most beautiful tent Standing amidst hundreds of white tents."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"184 The Life ofShabkar Inside was a great king sitting on a lofty throne. I was given a seat on a throne to his right, And the king stood up and presented to me A long silken scarf of immaculate whiteness And a hat of great beauty, and said: \"Emulating the lives of the great masters of the past, The way you sing songs of realization is wondrous. I name you: 'Bard of the Land ofSnows'. Continue to persevere in the essential practice And to sing songs to benefit beings. The collection of your songs will be a great legacy for Tibet And will greatly benefit beings of the future.\" Three months later, one evening, I saw in a vision A black whirlwind swirling in front of me. I uttered, \"Go away!\" and spat on it, And it turned into a black man holding a short sword. When I asked who he was, he became furious, And, transforming himself into a black pea, Entered my mouth and disappeared inside me. I then visualized my body as an iron house And at my navel the letter Ram, from which arose a fire. As I did so, the black man made himself grow bigger, Gradually filling my chest from the bottom up, So that I felt that my body was going to burst. I made the flames blaze stronger Until, unable to bear being consumed by the fire, The man shouted, \"Don't bum me!\" And kept on supplicating me with loud lamentations [l60a]. Finally, when he had promised that from then on he would never harm anyone, I let him pass out through my lower door. The next day, the whole inside of my body felt a bit uneasy, So I did some meditation and recitation on Vajrasattva and felt well again. During the fourth month, some Golok bandits came And went away, taking half of my provisions. Thinking that all beings were my parents I meditated on compassion over and over agam, And considered the bandits as spiritual friends Who had helped me to perfect the two pararnitas, generosity and patience. Short of food, I donned the armor of endurance; I regarded all phenomena as dreams, illusions. These words came vividly to mind: \"Give gain and victory to others; Take loss and defeat upon yoursel£\" I gained an even stronger certainty, too, in the truth of saying: \"Impermanent as the dew on grass, Wealth and possessions are just invitations, Attracting enemies and harmful influ-ences.\" During the fifth month I had visions of many deities, And of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas singing songs. In the seventh month snow fell day and night Without interruption for eight days. Asjetsun Mila said: \"There were big flakes, big as tufts of wool, That came gliding down, like birds."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"There were small flakes, small as spindle wheels, That came swirling down, like swarms of bees. There were tiny flakes, tiny as bean seeds, That came whirling down, like fine grains of hail.\" Since two arm-spans of snow had fallen, For many days I was cloistered inside, Not even able to boil some tea [160b]. At the end of the eighth month My provisions were exhausted, and I had to leave. Along the way, one day at noon, I came upon two brown bears, a mother and cub, And my sudden fright on seeing them helped my view to progress. Another day, in the afternoon, A fierce wild yak suddenly stood up in front of me. Raising his tail, snorting fiercely, He ran straight at me, like lightning through the sky. Yet, through a happy combination of circumstances, I managed to fmd myself riding on his neck. Leaning over his side I shouted, \"Ki-ii!\" And, frightened, the wild yak ran away. It was wondrous that he did not kill me. At present I am staying, quite content, At the White Rock Monkey Fortress. Eight years have gone now since I last saw my mother. The time predicted for her life to end, Given by my root teacher, the vidyadhara Terton Sonam Nyentrak, Is drawing near. Therefore, after the new year, I shall go to see if the kind mother Who gave me life still lives. At White Rock Monkey Fortress 185 If she is alive, I shall go back to see her; If she is dead, I shall go back to pray for her. May mother and son, whose minds are one, meet again soon. May you, the perfect teacher, be pleased By this news of how I traveled to and lived in the snow mountains. When this detailed letter reached him he was very pleased-the best offering that I could make to him. When entering into retreat I sang these verses in praise ofTrakar Drel Dzong: With body, speech, and mind [161 a] I bow down, with respect, to the Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo. I will sing here a few words in praise Of this sacred place, White Rock Monkey Fortress. E rna! The Trakar Drel Dzong mountain Is as beautiful as a heap of precious white crystals. It is a supreme abode of solitude Blessed by Padmakara, the Lord of the Victorious Ones. There are countless miraculously arisen images of deities, The refuge of all beings, men and gods. Almost all the practitioners who, after renouncing the world, Meditated in this place, attained realization. Here, too, came many masters Who, like the sun, benefited countless beings. Here gather the dakas and dakinis of the three planes, And the local deities revere the Dharma."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"186 The Life of Shabkar The rocky slopes are adorned with trees and flowers, And from deep within the rocks, sacred springs issue forth. Wild animals, carefree, come and play; People from central Tibet and elsewhere come here To do prostrations and circumambulations. Wild edible plants and berries grow here, The sustenance for many sages. Celestial juniper trees sway as though dancing, Celestial birds sing their tunes. When the mountains and valleys tum lush green, The blue cuckoo comes and sings. No hindrances or hardships Disturb those who stay in this sacred site. Food, clothing, everything one needs, Is found without even being sought. You who aspire to happiness and satisfaction in this existence, Give up concern with ordinary life; stay in this place. You who long for ultimate happiness, Stay continuously in this wilderness [161 b]. Through having expressed these few words of praise, May obstacles and adverse circumstances be dispelled! May all aspirations and favorable circum-stances be accomplished! Again, one day I sang: I have never defiled the wish-fulfilling gem, The perfect teacher, with disrespectful thoughts, But have brightened it even more, using the soft cloth of ardent faith, And now wear it as my crown-ornament. I shall now sing a melodious song: Wondrous! When in the sky ofU and Tsang, The sun and the moon-the two protectors, the Victorious One and the Great Pandita8-Send forth the rays of their excellent sayings, The darkness of ignorance is dispelled And beings see what is to be done and what is to be avoided. When, on the Gold Mountain of Lower China9 The poised white lion, the emperor, protector of all, Roars his commands and laws, Millions of wild animals, his subjects and retinue, are subdued. In the Middle Lands, at the top of the pleasant temple ofRekong, The most precious J etsun Kalden Gyatso left this world. Mter that precious one had raised the indomitable victory banner of the teaching, His reincarnation came and raised it even higher.10 At this very moment, I, the renunciate born in Lower Rekong, Having drunk the nectar of the sutras and mantras, Sing, in the cool shade of a solitary mountain retreat, Songs pleasant to hear and satisfying to the mind. Wondrous! You faithful people from the Upper, Lower, and Middle Lands, How fortunate you are to be born these days in Tibet: Make connections with both the Victorious Lord and the Great Pandita, And they will lead you to the Pure Realms [162a]. Observe the laws proclaimed by the emperor, the Guardian of the Skies, And all countries will enjoy happiness and well-being."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Practice according to the words ofjetsun Kalden's reincarnation, And all your aspirations will be accom-plished, while the Dharma will spread more and more in Rekong. Remaining in solitudes, meditate as I do, And the sun ofhappiness will arise from within. With a mind as white as a snow mountain, I, the snow-land bard, have sung this song. By this merit, may the teachings of the Buddha spread far and wide, And may the lives of the teachers be finn and long. May all the beings of the three worlds be happy and peaceful, And may they, filled with joy, Practice the Dharma and attain Buddhahood. I then did strict retreat. Two months later, the wives of five men from Derge families came to the door of my retreat hut, weeping. Their husbands had been arrested on their journey by some Chinese who accused them of being thieves and had taken them to Xining. I felt bad for them, and I asked them who was the most influential person in the area. One of the older women said that the chieftain Gyaltsen Martri, a member of the Shabdrung clan, was on good terms with the Chinese; she added that if he sent a letter stating that the men were not thieves, and requested their release, the Chinese would let them go. I told them, \"Don't worry, this chieftain is one of my most devout patrons [l62b]. I shall ask him to come and he will have your husbands released.\" They left, much relieved. However, since I was alone, there was no one to go and contact the chieftain. I wondered, \"Could I bring him here simply through medita-tive concentration?\" At White Rock Monkey Fortress 187 I visualized myself as the yidam, and visual-ized myself emanating rays of light that went from my heart to my patron's heart. I then imagined that this light generated in my patron's body and mind a feeling of bliss-void he had never felt before. I imagined that, in this state, he would think of me, feel an urge to see me, and come. I did this visualization repeatedly and, in a few days, Gyaltsen Martri did come, with a large group of people. Mter I explained the matter to him, he wrote a letter, and the five men from Derge were released, to the joy of everyone. Later, whenever I needed to summon a disciple or a patron, I did the same visualization and they came. I thought that from then on, I could easily contact anyone. For my own edification and that of others, I sang several satirical songs pointing out my own and others' shortcomings: I bow down to all those who, Having generated loving-kindness, compassion and Bodhicitta, Train themselves in the ways of the Bodhisattvas. I, an old monk roaming the world, which I see as a book, Once took the highway of mind training. While traveling, I reached the treacherous path of desire and hatred [163a]; There sat three people, a master and his two disciples, serene and self-controlled. They were \"Bodhisattva,\" \"Precious Loving-kindness,\" and \"Boundless Compassion.\" On meeting them I asked: ''You three, where are you from and where are you going?\" They replied: \"We are from the Diamond Throne of Ultimate Excellence; 11"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"188 The Life of Shabkar We came because a few people of the High Realm of Tibet called us. \"Those who called us proclaimed loudly our excellence To all the monasteries and villages around. But, although they were many, none of them asked us to stay. In this dangerous area filled with high cliffs and gorges, We endured many difficulties, So, we won't remain; we are going back.\" \"Well,\" I said,\" I am an exceedingly fortunate man. If you are going back, Take me, an old monk, along with you!\" With a smile, Bodhisattva said: \"Poor old monk, we have already taken many people like you, And most of them, while climbing the pass Of the Bodhisattva's activity, got tired and turned back. To look at you, it seems that you are one of that kind. The pass of the Bodhisattva's activity is very steep And one must climb up to it; there is no way to leap over it. You had better just stay quietly here, in this Higher Realm!\" Having said so, he laughed and left. May all those who hear this song Cultivate loving-kindness, compassion, and Bodhicitta, And put them into practice. In this way, I tried to point out the defects of some practitioners who, having first generated a bit ofloving-kindness, compassion, and Bodhicitta [163b], become disheartened when they com-prehend the vastness of Bodhisattva conduct, and are unable to train in it. Again I sang: I bow down to those who unite means and wisdom in their practice, And therefore perfect the level of Buddha-hood, the ultimate excellence. One day when I set out upon the main road Of the gradual path and was looking around, Along came a man carrying a bulky load of provisions-skillful means-But who, lacking a horse-wisdom-was going on foot. I said, ''Where are you going, uncle with a big load?\" He replied: \"I am going to the Central Land ofUltimate Excellence.\" I asked: \"Did your horse die under you on the way? Or was it seized by bandits or stolen by thieves?\" \"I came from home without a horse,\" he replied. I went on, \"People who come from there say, 'Without a horse, it is too difficult-you won't reach the Central Land.\"' \"To ride on horse is a risky thing,\" said he, And, having readjusted his load, he went on his way. Mter he had gone I thought, \"Aha! This is not the way to travel; one must have a horse.\" Then, having gone a little farther, I saw a man riding swiftly upon a fme blue wisdom horse, Controlling him with the bridle of mindfulness And urging him on with the whip of vigilance. ''Where are you going, swift-moving uncle?\" I asked him. He replied: \"I am going to the Central Land of Ultimate Excellence.\""},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"I questioned him further: \"Has the horse-skillful means----carrying your prov1Slons Gone ahead or is it following behind?\" \"I am but one rider with but one horse; I have nothing else.\" I replied: \"'Without provisions you won't reach the Central Land, it is too difficult'-that is what everyone says.\" \"To take along a packhorse is to create heavy karmic debts,\" he said; and saying so, he whipped his stallion and sped off [164a]. After he had gone I thought: \"Aha! This is also not the way to travel; one must have a packhorse!\" After I had rested there for a while, Someone came riding on a wisdom horse, Leading the packhorse, skillful means. He had as guides the Three Jewels and the Three Roots, And was singing songs filled with good words. \"Amazing! Where are you going, uncle?\" \" I am going to the Central Land of Ultimate Excellence.\" I thought, \"This is the right way to travel. From now, whoever intends to go to the Central Land of Ultimate Excellence Should go in this way, and he will surely arrive there easily. This is how I should go.\" Whoever hears this song should never separate wisdom from means, But practice, uniting the two of them. In this way, I pointed out the defects of those who separate wisdom from skillful means. Again I sang: At White Rock Monkey Fortress 189 I bow down to all the great beings of the past, endowed with discipline: May you tum to the Dharma the minds of all faithful monks and nuns! Once, as I was going to a mountain solitude I met a monk, his body dressed in the three monastic robes And his mind filled with serenity and composure. \"Amazing! Venerable monk, where are you going? Who gave you your monastic vows? Considering how many vows there are, I wonder if you decided on your own to take them, Or if someone else induced you to do so? Or are there gelong ordinations with a variable number of vows? 12 He said: ''What's the matter with you?\"[l64b] ''Well,\" I said, \"it looks like you alone are keeping more vows Than a hundred of those other monks around here.\" He replied: \"There are two hundred and fifty-three vows, And I am a gelong observing that very number, For when receiving the full ordination, One must take the full number of vows. I am now going to my patrons at Ganden.\" And so saying he continued on his way. Having seen this fully ordained monk, I could not but admire him. Having gone a little further I met on my way An easy fellow dressed in an old sheepskin, walking along with a girl, Chatting away, with great animation."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"190 Th£ Life qf Shabkar \"Aro! Eh, you old chap, where are you from? Where are you going like that with your wife?\" \"I am a gelong,\" said he. \"Aha! Did someone steal your robes? Or did they run out of robes at the time of your ordination? Or maybe you took your vows so long ago that you're all finished with them now? Or perhaps you thought they were pointless and gave them back?\" Angrily, he grumbled: \"What's the matter with you?\" 'Well, compared to some other gelongs, it seems That you have no vows to keep at all.\" Mter I had said this, he left without saying anything. On seeing such a monk, I felt quite sad. May all the faithful monks and nuns who hear this song Keep their discipline with joyful enthusiasm. And in this way, I pointed out the defects of some monks. Again I sang: I bow to the realized Chod13 practitioners of the past [165a]. ·May they tum to the Dharma the minds of the faithful ones who practice the Chod! Once I went into an empty valley And reached a pleasant spring. And there I saw a Chod practitioner playing his drum, Dro-lo-lo! Playing and dancing as well. \"Amazing! Dancing Chod practitioner, Why must you live in this empty valley? Can't your Chod cut anything? Or is it that, having already finished your cutting in the villages, Y au wanted to see if there was anything else to cut on mountaintops? \"What's the matter with you?\" he said. I went on: \"Compared to some of the ChOd practitioners around, It seems that you don't busy yourself going here and there . Cutting off the heads of goats, sheep, and ewes.\" He replied: \"I am cutting through ego-clinging.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"and where will you go from here?\" \"I shall go to a celestial field.\" Having said this, he left, playing his drum. On seeing this Chod practitioner, I became filled with admiration. Then having gone a little farther, at a crossroad, I met a fellow approaching on a wild horse, Carrying behind the saddle the skins of some freshly flayed sheep. I hailed him: \"Aro! Benefactor, where are you coming from? Has an epidemic broken out among the sheep?\" He replied that he was a ChOd practitioner. I continued: \"A-me! Look at how sharp your 'cutting' is; Do you use an axe or a knife? It seems that you are cutting through nothing but the necks of old ewes (165b]. Doing so, aren't you cutting the jugular of your own liberation?\" He got upset and retorted angrily: \"What's the matter with you?\""},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"I replied: \"How good of you, going around like that Cutting off the heads of goats and sheep!\" Muttering a few threats, he went away. Seeing this Chod practitioner I felt quite sad. May all the faithful Choo practitioners who hear this song Give up skinning animals. Thus I pointed out the defects of some Chod practitioners. Again I sang: I bow down-at the feet of the hermits of past who lived in mountain retreats; Grant your blessings that I and others may remain in mountain solitudes. One day as I was going into the wilderness, I saw, in a pleasant cave beneath an overhanging cliff, A hermit who had given up all worldly activities To stay in retreat in the mountains; He sat with his back straight, His two hands resting .in meditation posture. \"E rna! How wonderful! Mountain hermit, are you well? Why do you need to stay here? Are you staying on behalf of all the 'mountain hermits' Who are roaming about in the villages? Or are you a villain banned from villages? ''What do you mean?'' he answered. ''Well,\" I went on, \"It seems that, when you feel hungry and cold, You stay here and don't go down to the villages for food.\" ''Yes, I stay and practice meditation,\" said he. ''Where will you go from here?\" \"I shall slowly move on to the plateaus of the pure land ofU and Tsang.\" At White Rock Monkey Fortress 191 On seeing this mountain hermit, I was fllled with admiration. Then having gone a little farther, I saw approaching, in the distance, An old monk riding on a horse and hold-ing a spear [166a]. \"Uncle-with-a-spear, where are you going? It looks as though you have lost something.\" \"I am a hermit staying in mountain retreat,\" he said. \"Aha! Did you fall sick? Did some brigand steal all your provisions? Did you come face-to-face with some ferocious beast? Did hosts of gods and demons show up as appalling apparitions? Was your cave destroyed by lightning? Upset by these words, he shouted: \"What's the matter with you?\" I went on: \"It looks as if rather than staying And meditating in a mountain retreat, Y au go visiting in the villages from morning to night.\" His lips and voice quivering with anger, he grumbled: ''What's that madman saying?\" and went away. As he passed I looked closely and I could see that his \"spear\" was only a bamboo cane. ''What an odd fellow!\" I thought, bursting into laughter.

One day as I went to refresh myself In the middle of a meadow, Many goats and sheep came from all sides And gathered around me. Among them, an old sheep spoke: \"Old monk, neither virtuous nor sinful, I have something to tell you.\" \"Alright,\" I said. \"Come on, tell me.\" He went on: \"I have a great favor to request Of the 'meritorious' lamas Who come gathering alms in summer and autumn. \"The very moment a short-necked, shiny, chubby monk Arrives at our village door, leading packhorses carrying a lama's red bundles, He takes a villager with him and comes right toward us sheep. \"The 'protection cord' the lama is going to give out Is for us a noos~ It gets tied around the patrons' necks-And soon, by our necks, we ourselves are caught. \"The fate of goats and old mother ewes 16 Is thus in the hands of visiting lamas. In this life, in the bardo, and in the next life There is no other object ofhope than the guru, So, at the time ofhope, don't betray us, Take pity on us! ''You should let us live out this life, Or take us to the higher realms in the next one.

When they invite you, Don't pretend you don't know That your patrons are about to kill us sheep. Rather, come after having said a few kind words on our behalf [ 168a]. Otherwise, the time of a lama's arrival Means the time for our death. \"So, don't pretend you don't know what's happening, But come to visit after saying, kindly: 'Don't slaughter your sheep; set them free.' ''When some lamas enter someone's house And seat themselves comfortably upon the throne, We are being slaughtered right outside the door-Don't pretend you don't know what's going on! When there is nothing on earth You lamas don't know, How can you not know about this? \"A goat or a sheep is thrown down to the ground.

''We pray to you from the bottom of our hearts That, at that moment, you may say something to reprieve us. When we are gagged and being smothered, If we could but draw a single breath, It would be the greatest goodness on earth. We have such terrible karma! When autumn comes, the season for slaughtering sheep, The fate of the old mother ewes is the worst of all. 1 7 If, at that time the compassion Of even the lamas, which is said to be great, declines, What will happen to the compassion of those who have so little to begin with? In short: When the red lamas come, For the sake of red meat and blood, They cut our red jugulars, And, red, the sun rises.\" In answer to this I said: \"Aro! Goats, sheep, and old ewes, These bodies in which you've taken birth Will have to be left behind, sooner or later. ''If one were to pile up all the flesh and bone [168b] Of all the bodies you've once had and left, They would make a heap higher than MountMeru; There would be as many as all the particles of dust on the entire earth. \"Not even one of these bodies was used to sustain the life of a master-Every one of those lives was wasted.

But when I do so, some of them May curse or try to kill me!\" May all alms-seekers who hear this song Never accept the meat of animals That have been killed especially for them. Thus I pointed out the defects of some of the prosperous lamas who go around gathering alms in summer and autumn. Again I sang: One day I went to the top Of a mountain where no one lives. From the unborn expanse there came The child \"He-who-does-not-regard-th. al\" mgs-as-re . Alone, he was thinking, \"Who would be a proper vessel for me?\" Over and over again, pondering Whether this person or that would be more suitable: \"The eminent lamas possess the clear eyes of insight, But they've caught the disease of the eight worldly concems-I'djust as soon not choose them! \"The monks and the nuns Have nice costumes and a nice appearance, But they're prone to catch the 'cold disease' of desire and craving-I'd just as soon not choose them!

But you won't do, either! \"Ifl can't fmd a healthy, pure being I won't enter into a defective being! \"I'd rather just go back to the absolute expanse.\" And having said so, he disappeared. Thus, to tease and amuse, I sang these criticisms, aimed at myself and others. Another time, to brighten the spmts of the Dharma practitioners, I imitated the style of Jetsun Milarepa and sang a few songs explaining my way ofhaving banquets with meat and chang.

Again a few of my ordained disciples said, \"If you would build a small monas-tery in a nice place it would be useful for all of us, master and disciples, when we grow old. I told them, \"I don't need a small monas-tery. I've already built a big one.

I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, installed the monastic community of the ten religious activities In the mountain monastery of my body [172a].

I now hope to enlarge the monastery of meditative experiences and realization. I myself have built a monastery like this; In the same way should you build one too, And enjoy happiness now and in time to come. Everyone nodded and said, \"That's a re-markable monastery indeed. We may not be able to build one like yours, but at least let's see if we can build an ordinary one. Please grant your spiritual protection to achieve this easily and without hindrances.\" Then, having prostrated themselves and walked round me with devotion and respect, they left. Mter I had finished my retreat, many people came to see me. I gave them the transmission of the mani, the Praises to Tara, the fasting practice, and the one-day vows. I explained to them the karmic law of cause and effect and various songs about impermanence and death. Everyone's mind turned toward the Dharma. Many people offered me horses, cattle, sheep, tea, cloth, and garments. I did not take them; having made prayers to dedicate the merit of their offerings, I returned them to the donors, except for a dzo which, moved by pity, I gave to a woman of the Shabdrung family who had come to meet me. She was in tears because her only possession, a bull, had been stolen [172b]. I also accepted one hundred lengths of cloth of various colors, with which I made a thousand prayer flags printed with the mani. When I hung them, there were enough to make five lines of flags between two hills above my place. I then went to pay homage, circumambulate, prostrate myself, and make offerings to the many self-arisen images which are found in the area of the White Rock Monkey Fortress. Then, wondering whether I would be able to see my mother or not, I crossed the Machu River on my way. At some point on the journey, the strong yearning I had felt when I thought of her vanished, and I no longer felt such a strong urge to go. By the banks of the Machu was a pleasant cave known as Perna Dzong, the Lotus Citadel. Mter I had stayed a few days there, Lhundrup Rigdzin, Gelong Nyungnepa, and a few others arrived with the news that, a little more than a month after I had reached at the White Rock Monkey Fortress, my mother had suddenly fallen ill. She told my sisters, my cousins Nyingpo Cham, Alak Bendhe, and others: \"I wasn't well last night. This is the year of Terton Rinpoche's prediction20 and the year that my son promised that he would come and see me. Can it be that I shall die this year? My son once sent me a letter that said, 'This is what you should do when you are on the point of death .. .' Look for that letter, and read it to me; even if I can't see my son again, that will bring me great peace of mind.\" When the letter was read to her, she wept tears as big as peas, and said, \"Since I am dying now, and since my son hasn't come back to me, send my bones to him, in accordance with what he wrote to me [l73a]. I have no other request.\" Saying this, she died, without much pain. lfl had not succumbed to the persuasion of my patrons when I was staying at the White Rock Monkey Fortress, there would still have been enough time to go to see my mother while she was living. There would still have been time for her to be able to hear me ask her, \"Mother, how are you?\" But blinded by ignorance and tangled up in circumstances, I did not have the good fortune to see my mother one last time in this life."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"When my mother died, the lord of si.ddhas, Perna Rangdrol Rinpoche, was invited to come from Tashikhyil. He set the mandala of the hun-dred supreme peaceful and wrathful deities, and, making clouds of material and imagined offer-ings, he prayed to the Three Jewels to lead my mother along the path. He thus made a perfect accumulation of merit and purification of obscurations. Especially, following the tradition of the Radiant Great Perfection, he performed the puri-fication of the seeds for rebirth in the six realms. Then he visualized clearly the consciousness of my mother as a white letter A and merged it with the sky-like dharmakaya of his mind. Remaining evenly in the confident view of the natural state of all things, he purified, in the unborn absolute space, her two veils and their subtle residues. He then visualized that, from within the expanse of dharmakaya, my mother's mind arose as a wisdom dakini, with one head and two hands, so beautiful that one would never tire of looking at her [I 7 3b]. Through her unhindered miraculous power, the dakini transported herself instantly to the Blissful Western Buddhafield. There, she met Lord Amitabha, heard his voice, was graced by his prediction, 21 and reached the level from which one never falls back. Perna Rangdrol then performed the crema-tion with a fire offering ceremony, and con-cluded with prayers and wishes of dedication. My sisters, using all our possessions and the plen-tiful goods and food that our relatives and all the local devotees had gathered, performed all the traditional meritorious deeds. · On the night of the cremation, my spiritual friend Tsewang Rabten dreamed that my mother, radiant and beautified with various dresses and ornaments, and surrounded by a fabulous reti-nue of dakas and dakinis, rose in the sky and advanced westward on a great path of light. When he recounted his dream, people said, \"For-tunate mother! By the kindness of her son she is now in the Blissful Buddhafield.\" After this, according to my mother's last request, my close disciple Perna Rangdrol col-lected her bones and sent them to me with lhundrup Rigdzin, Gelong Nyungnepa, and a At White Rock Monkey Fortress 201 few others [1 7 4a]. When they found me, they told me how my mother had died, what her last will was, and all the other details. When they placed in my hands my mother's bones, I thought, \"Aho! Things of this world really are nothing. In the past, my old mother, overwhelmed by affection and thinking of her only son, used to weep bitterly and send me messages and letters begging, 'Son, come back once again.' But still I did not interrupt my practice. I still thought of my mother as being young, and thought that, even ifl did not see her for a few years, she wouldn't die. \"Thus, believing in the permanence of things, I kept putting off my return. I purposely deceived her by continuing to write, saying, 'Next year ... I'll come to see you next year.' And, in the end, she died without my ever having seen her again. \"Thinking of my mother, I, her bad son, had just set out on my way back to her from a distant place, pack on my back, staff in my hand. I did not have anything of value to bring for her, but I was coming back to her with many com-forting words already in mind that would have brought peace to her mind. \"But my merit was insufficient. My mother had already set out on the infamous road called Death. She is no longer in a place where, if I looked, I could see her, or that, if I spoke, she could hear me. She has gone on to the distant land that is the next life. \"Even if, by virtue of having practiced the Dharma, we meet again in our next lives, we did not have the opportunity to meet once again in this life in order to say a few things to one another that would have warmed our hearts.\" Disconsolate, my sadness was fath-omless. Weeping, I sang this song of mourn-ing [174b]: Lord guru, enlightened one, Please remain on the crown of my head. With compassion look upon all sentient beings, Each one of whom was once my mother.

For my mother's benefit, for a few days I did as much practice as I could to accumulate merit and purifY obscurations. I made tsa-tsas 22 from her bones.

Now I do not need to do \"meditations on impermanence.\" My old mother, leaving me, gave me these teachings. With this in mind, I, her disconsolate son, From now on will praclice the holy Dharma. Having sung this, I thought: \"My mother, whose memory is like a knife in my heart, no longer exists. What is the point of staying on here any longer?

It occurred to me that she must be an ema-nation of Arya Tara. Just then, she said: \"My son, don't be sad that you left too late to find your mother still alive. The law of impermanence rules all things. You must use difficult circum-stances as an inspiration to practice virtue. \"Don't stay here; go to the Pure Realm of U-Tsang and plant the victory banner of prac-tice there. Practicing the Dharma is the most supreme way to repay your mother's kindness and is the most supreme of all virtuous acts you might perform for her benefit.\" Having made this prophecy, she disappeared. I thought, ''When I was living in remote places, far away from my mother, I had intended to come back to see her, and then stay in a place sufficiently close that she would at least be able to hear news of me. But, as the saying goes, 'A horse does not always run where man wants.' I will never again, in this lifetime, see my mother. While I'm still young, I should go to the Pure Realm of U-Tsang to practice, as indicated in my dream.\" Thus, I decided to go to U-Tsang. After I had told some monks, disciples, and patrons of my intentions, I sang the song Leaving for Central Tthet [l78a] Before, When my mother lived, 205 I did not wish to go to meet her. Now when I wish to go to meet her, She no longer lives. The time never came to pass For us to meet once more. I won't remain here; I'll go on to U. Before, I did not wish to stay nearby her. Now, when I wish to stay near to her, My mother no longer lives. The time never came to pass For us to meet once more. I won't remain here; I'll go on to U. Before, I did not wish to listen to her words. Now, when I wish to listen to her words, My mother no longer lives. The time never came to pass For us to meet once more. I won't remain here; I'll go on to U. Now I will go to practice the profound teachings In sacred sites like those wherejetsun Mila stayed. Heart-sons, disciples who follow my example, Like me, practice for the whole length of your lives."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"206 7he Lift of Shabkar Patrons who put your t.Iust in me, This vagabond-give up evil acts; Practice virtue. May you all have long lives; May you be free from illness; May you act in accordance with the Dharma. I pray that we all will meet again. Mter singing this song, I set off toward U-Tsang. From that time onwards, my despair over my mother's death eased. To mature his mind-stream for the first time, I gave the four empowerments of the \"samadhi without concepts\" to my supreme heart-son Lhundrup Rigdzin, \"Spontaneously Accom-plished Awareness Holder,\" also called Kalden Rangdrol. He was a being offortunate karma, who had already trained himself in previous lives. At the time of the Descent of Blessings, 1 Kalden experienced this pure vision: before him in space, in a mass of rainbow light, I was seated as the dharmakaya Buddha, Samantabhadra. From my heart, light radiated and [178b] pen-etrated his heart, and all his perceptions of his body being substantial ceased. Even my apparent form as Samantabhadra disappeared, and he could just hear the sound of my voice, without understanding any words or meanings. Thus, he remained for a moment in a state like a pure cloudless sky. Over several days, I gave him the transmis-sion for and detailed explanations on the text called Dispelling the Darkness qf Ignurance, 2 accord-ing to the teachings of the Great Perfection. Finally I gave him this advice: On a lotus, a sun and a moon Above the crown of our heads Is the noble root master, Possessor of blessings-Look upon all beings with compassion; In particular, cherish as your sons Disciples who live in harmony with the Dharma. Through the power of past pure actions and aspirations We two have taken birth in the same country; This year we have come together in this place; We are fortunate to have established a good connection. Life is not permanent; it ends in death. A gathering of relatives does not last-In the end, they part. Amassed wealth does not last-In the end, it runs out. A high position does not last-In the end, one falls from it. Son, if you consider well How all dharmas are impermanent, You will cease thinking of this life's affairs, And will follow the life-examples of past saints. Son, in the future, regardless of where I maybe, To accomplish all your aims, Supplicate the divine Three jewels And urge the glorious dharmapalas and protectors To act in fulfillment of their vows. Until we meet again, remain well and in peace. I make prayers of aspiration That we meet again soon, not at some distant time; · On the auspicious day when we meet once more, May auspiciousness pervade that very place [179a]. My disciple, Kalden Rangdrol, who was like my own son, replied with this song: In a pleasant hermitage, away from all society, You preserve the life-examples of past holy beings-"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Precious father, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Be kind enough to heed your son's request. Protector, through the power Of your many vast, profound teachings, The mind of your lowly disciple Has begun to turn toward the Dharma: This is your kindness, father guru. 0 venerable master of inestimable kindness, From now on, by remaining in remote retreats, I will dedicate my life to intensive Dharma practice. This is my offering, made to please you, father guru. From now on, until I reach enlightemnent, I have no other hope for refuge Than you, father guru. With your unfailing love and compassion, Please look after me. Gracious master, travel safely. I pray that, later, when I long to meet you, I, the son, will meet you once again. May virtue, excellence, and auspiciousness prevail. A few days later, when the patrons at Beldo, Jipar and other nearby places heard that I was about to go far away, they all came to see me. I explained to them in great detail the diffi-culty of finding a free, well-favored human birth, the uncertainty of the time of death, and the need to believe in the karmic law of cause and effect. Many of them gave up negative actions and practiced virtue [179b]. As I was leaving, I sang this advice: I pray with fervent devotion To the guru, the crown ornarnent Above the head of this wanderer. 0 venerable, glorious guru, Possessor ofblessings, May the minds of those who have gathered here Be turned toward the sacred Dharma. Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 207 Through the power of our previous pure actions and aspirations We, teacher and disciples, though born in different places, Have gathered here this year and made Both a material and spiritual connection. Now teacher and disciples Will go their separate ways-Impermanent, as are all things. From now on, all you faithful disciples, Continuously practice virtue as much as you can, Relinquish, as you would poison, Lies, harsh words, theft, banditry, fighting, and the taking of life. The cuckoo comes, His melodious song resounds; And then he leaves for other lands. So have I come here And taught the Dharma, And so shall I leave For retreat in distant lands. Just as the cuckoo returns again, So shall I come back, again and again. Until we meet once more, Farewell and be happy. May our future meeting bring Virtue, excellence, and auspiciousness. Having heard this, filled with faith, they did prostrations and circumambulations, and re-turned home. One evening it occurred to me that I should try to fmd a way to pacifY the banditry rampant in Upper Rekong, and the fighting and feuds in Lower Rekong [180a]. I went to sleep, and, in a dream, beheld the face of Terton Sonam Nyentrak Rinpoche. He made a prophecy that I wrote down and proclaimed to all:"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"208 7he Life of Shabkar I bow down at the feet of the true manifestations Of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas-the gurus, Kings and ministers of the past and present. Please look with compassion on all sentient beings. Especially, grant your blessings To pacify banditry, wars, and feuds In Upper and Lower Rekong, Bringing back peace to all. I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Will give you some advice beneficial For now and for the future. Devoted men and women, Listen without distractions; Keep what I say in mind. One evening I was wondering If there might be a way to pacify The theft and banditry in Upper Rekong And the feuds in Lower Rekong That bring ruin and disaster upon all. With this thought in mind, I went to sleep. Near midnight, in a dream appeared My root teacher Terton Sonam Nyentrak, Vajraclhara, lord of siddhas, Treasury of omniscience, who said: \"The wise lamas and chiefs of Upper and Lower Rekong Have issued edicts to control banditry, according to the imperial laws. If these edicts are heeded, for seven generations Everything will continue to improve. But if they are disregarded A Mongolian king of either the Snake Year or the Ox Year Will foster intrigues at the court of the Guardian of the Skies;3 For seven years there will be great unhappiness, And all will suffer like fish thrown on hot sand (180b]. ''When the lamas and chiefs of Lower Rekong Use their wisdom to weigh others' faults, petty or serious, and make judgments, Then disputes and lawsuits will be settled. \"Laws must be made to curb fighting: If no fighting occurs For twenty, fifteen or, at the very least, ten years, The ravenous, belligerent ghost, Greedy for the flesh, blood, breath and life of humans, Will go far away to the north or to the west, And for many generations happiness will reign. But should much fighting continue, Hail, frost, drought, famine, and epidemics Will increase and become the rule. \"To stop theft and banditry in Upper Rekong And fighting in Lower Rekong Everyone should commission paintings of the Blissful Buddhafield, Erect statues of the great Compassionate One, Avalokiteshvara, And recite the quintessential six-syllable mantra. \"Old and young alike should learn to read And observe minutely the karmic law of cause and effect Regarding positive and negative acts. All should cultivate a pure mind. If this is done, in this life and in future lives The sun of happiness and well-being will hin \" s e. Thus he spoke in my dream. In these degenerate times Human life is extremely short. See how even the young die suddenly. The time of death is uncertain, And, when their deaths come, Robbers, thieves, and warriors Will fall into the eighteen realms of hell,"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"And experience unbearable suffering, With no chance of escape. Therefore all you devoted people Of Lower and Upper Rekong, great and small [18la], Since theft, banditry, and fighting Are causes for suffering, never commit them again, Even in the slightest degree: Perform virtuous deeds as often as possible. I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, give this advice To all the devoted men and women Of Upper and Lower Rekong. May whoever hears it benefit! Put into writing and distributed throughout Upper and Lower Rekong, this proclamation helped a great deal. On the way to Chuzang, in Mangra, we stopped in a verdant forest grove near Jipar to boil some tea and take our noon meal. Mter I had left, some people with pure vision said they saw my handprints in the rock table; some saw me flying across the Machu River from one mountain to another; some saw me in the form of the great Compassionate One and of other deities. Because of this, they considered me as the Buddha in person, and my renown spread in all directions. At Chuzang,4 I met Alak Gedun Sherap of Botsuk in Kangtsa, a pure, noble and learned lama. Perceiving me with pure vision, he mad~ me sit on a high throne. Then, hoping that it would help to tame the wild tribes of Bhanak Khasum, the Three Black Camps, he asked me to teach them the Dharma. He told them all, ''You must listen to his advice,\" and thus helped to establish auspicious spiritual connections [l8lb]. He built a high throne in the middle of a plain and made announcements in all directions, saying, \"This lama will be staying only a month, Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 209 as he is on his way to U. All those wanting to meet him must come soon. Out of his great compassion, he will tum the Wheel of Dharma for all.\" Because, in those days, in the Three Black Camps and the domain of the Shabdrung clan the nomads were prosperous, all the men and women came dressed in their fmest clothes and jewelry, rode their best horses and brought excellent white tents. Every day thousands came to see me, filling the plains of Chuzang with white tents and hearthstones. Then a few people asked, \"Do you drink kumiss?\"5 When I said I didn't, they asked, \"Why not?\" In reply I said, \"Actually, I do have a most excellent kumiss to drink,\" and sang this song entided How a Yogin Drinks Kumiss: Father, King of Dharma, I supplicate you. Grant your blessing so that my mind-stream May merge with the Dharma. I, a yogin who has realized the true nature of mind, I, the awareness-holder,Jampa Chodar, Have never tasted kumiss made by human beings; But I have a kumiss that others do not. With a mind that thirsts for the holy Dharma, Toward worldly dharmas I felt only wearmess. With money-the glories of worldly existence-! bought a mare-the Great Perfection, From whose womb came forth a foal-compassiOn. The milk of spontaneous accomplishment naturally appeared. Then the youthful maiden----i':mptiness-Sat in the postures of the three kayas [182a] And with her fingers-the four lamps-Did the milking-the experience of the four visions-"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"210 The Life of Shabkar Into the milking pail-the crucial points of the three gates.6 She then poured the milk into the vessel of naked, utter transparency, Stirred it with the golden spoon of the practice, Uniting primordial purity and spontaneous presence, And let it rest in the natural state. Now I shall offer the first fresh part. You, the young child Awareness, Stand, vivid, in the natural state And dip out the first part With the ladle of undistracted mindfulness. Ema! This Dharma, wondrous and extraordinary, The fresh, first kumirs ofliberation from suffering, I offer to the lamas and the hosts of yidam deities: Partake of it from within the state of the unborn dharmakaya-This is the joyous feast of gratitude. Secondly I offer it to the dakinis and dharmapalas. Partake of it in the state beyond the workings of mind-This is the joyous feast of the accomplishment of activities! Then I offer it to all my vajra brothers and sisters: Partake of it in the spontaneous, uncontrived state--This is the joyous feast of pure samaya! l.asdy, the dregs of ambrosia, on the bottom, Are drunk by me, the fortunate renunciate. All the guests were cheered by this excellent ambrosia And offered toasts to excellent auspiciousness. I, the yogin, also became intoxicated. Deep from within, I savored its taste, Inexpressible like the blissful ecstasy of a young maiden. An experience arose in me--One that could not be captured in words, Like the dream of a mute. I realized the single meaning, Indivisible, indissociable, Like raw sugar and its sweet taste. Ignorance and conflicting emotions dissolved into the absolute expanse, Like clouds vanishing in the sky [l82b]. I found irreversible confidence, Like an archer of great skill and strength shooting arrows. I felt an immeasurable joy, Like a beggar discovering his hearthstone to be gold. Be blissful and happy, 0 vajra brothers and sisters. This song inspired faith in their minds. Then from Bhanak Khasum, Trika, Rekong, Marnang, Tso-nga, the Mongolian area under Shabdrung, and other places, so many people came to meet me it that became like a busy marketplace. Hav-ing prayed to the Three Jewels and generated Bodhicitta, with love and compassion, from a throne erected in a field I taught in detail on the karmic law of cause and effect, as one can find in the Ben¢cia1 Sun. 7 My close disciple Kalden Rangdrol gave refuge vows and, according to everyone's need, the transmissions of the confession prayers, the mani mantra, the one-day vow and fasting prac-tice, the Praises to Tara, the JiWzite Umbrella man-tra, and the Diamond Sutra. 8 Doing so, we could tum toward the pure Dharma the minds of all the cruel tribes ofBhanak Khasum who, high and low, had never done anything but exert themselves in banditry and wrongdoing, and were renowned for having remained untamed despite the countless .13ud-"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"dhas who had appeared in the past. All those who killed many wild animals, goats, and sheep stopped their endless sins, and many also re-nounced robbing and stealing. For many years, most families gave up killing lambs and the calves of rkomo9 [183a]. To everyone's amazement, even the servants who were in charge of slaugh-tering took vows not to kill. Many men and women pledged to practice virtue. To many qualified disciples I gave the em-powerment of the W1Sh-:fol.fiUing Gem, HayagrWa. and Varahi, and the teaching on the Great Perfec-tion called Dispelling the Darkness qf Igrwrance. About twenty of them renounced the world. So much silk, cotton, clothing, jewelry, sheep, horses, and cattle were offered to me that, had I accepted it all, it seemed that it would not have fit into the valley. Realizing that the northern route I was going to take entailed many difficul-ties, I returned most of these offerings after hav-ing dedicated the merit. Of what I did accept, I used the most valuable things as Dharma offer-ings and gifts, and to offer in central Tibet put aside one thousand coins, a few white Chinese bowls, some corals and turquoise, and hundreds of scarves with woven designs of Amitayus. With the help of a few monks-Ngawang Dargye and Kunzang Rangdrol from Shabdrung, Alak Tsondru, Bendhe from Shohong, and Chodpa from Bongtak-all the food, supplies, pack-and riding horses needed for our journey to central Tibet were swiftly and easily prepared. I offered to Alak Gedun Sherap Rinpoche all the remaining goods and provisions, and requested some teachings to establish a spiritual link. In return, he gave me one horse for the journey to central Tibet [183b]. Mter we had conversed joyfully for a long time, I offered this song before parting: You, luminous empty sky, farewell, While I, earthly sun, make the round of the four continents. Soon, with rays oflight, I will return. You, wish-fulfilling tree, farewell, While I, cuckoo, king of birds, fly off to other horizons. Soon, with melodious songs, I will return.

You, authentic lama, farewell, While I, fortunate disciple, leave for whichever wilderness I please. Soon, with an offering scarf, I will return. Mter I had offered this song, he accompanied me outside his tent, said farewell, and went inside. I then passed through Chuzang, where I gave much advice on religious and worldly matters to all the faithful men and women gathered there; I ended with this song: Above the crown of my head, On a lotus, a sun and a moon, Sits my root lama, the lord Vajradhara: Grant the accomplishments To this gathering of men and women That they may be happy in this and in future lives. You, sky-blue in color, so easy to soar through, Passage of the gods-remain in joy. I, a white eagle, fly off to other lands [184a]. Riding on the high winds, I will return, time and again.

There were altogether about fifty other trav-elers from the province of Bhanak Khasum go-ing to U, including Kharjam and Chador from Dratsa, and Tsering Gyal and others from Kangtsa.

If you buy a horse, buy an excellent horse-emptiness! If you race a horse, race a horse like this! Mter singing this song, I mounted the horse and rode off. At Dzasmwa, we had to wait more than ten days for some central Tibetans returning from Dorney to U. We heard that a trading caravan coming down from U had abandoned a man from Trika who was near death. Mter two days Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 215 of searching we found him, and gave him food and clothing. When he had recovered, we sent him home. For those who had escorted me up to that place, I sang a song called the Auspicious Aspiration to Meet Again: I supplicate the kind master: Please bless the body, speech, and mind Of all those who have assembled here [187b]. Faithful men and women gathered here, Listen a moment to this yogin's song. Through the power of previous pure deeds and aspirations, All who are assembled here have had the good fortune To encounter the Buddha's teachings. Achieving either a higher state of existence Or ultimate excellence is up to you. Now, when you have the choice, Practice right away the means to attain the ultimate excellence-enlightenment!

Like the bee returning I, the yogin, will soon return. Until then, may virtue and auspiciousness Continuously pervade this land. After I had sung this, everyone did prostrations and circumambulations with faith and devotion, then bade me farewell, saying, \"Be well till we meet again!\" At this time we met a leper from Mamang Be'u Thang, on his way to drink the medicinal snow waters of Mount Machen. Out of pity, I gave him a tk.o, a saddle, ropes, a tent, bellows and flint, and a month's provisions, and sent him off.

During the journey, my devoted disciple, Gelong Ngawang Dargye, asked me to sing, for the benefit of the present and future travelers to U-Tsang, a song that would explain how to behave properly on the road and at home.

He overloads the horse and, Rushing on, he overworks it. He takes along with him many sheep, To be killed for food along the journey. As he goes, he also hunts wild animals-many of them. When his sheep are all eaten up, he buys more on the way. Thus, committing evil deed after evil deed, he travels. When discussing whether to travel on or to set camp, No matter what anyone says, he disagrees. Arguing back and forth, he always says no. Since he never listens to experienced travelers, Almost everything goes wrong; Mistaking the road, he goes astray. He doesn't stay awake when he's on guard, but is sunk in sleep; When his possessions are carried offby thieves, He just runs around in circles. He doesn't let his horse stop to graze, But forces it to keep going on and on, And when the horse, exhausted, cannot take another step, He hurls abuse at it. He lingers near the hearthstone where people are cooking, But can't be bothered to bring back wood or water; When the firewood runs out, he'll blame his friends. When there is nothing to worry about, his courage is at its zenith. He'll say, \"No need to stay on guard, there won't be any problems.\" But when bandits come, his heart shakes with fear [I88b]. He won't go where there's fighting; Should he happen to fmd himself where there's fighting, he hides. When faced with outer enemies, he is hopeless; At creating discord within the party, he is peerless. On the road, he keeps on slandering his fellow-travelers behind their backs. His stomach is gigantic, his appetite insatiable. He scrutinizes each person's portion; If someone else takes more than he does, He throws a fit, eyes ablaze with rage, While he seizes the choicest, richest food for himsel£ He won't give away a morsel; If, by chance, he does, he gives only the tiniest sliver, Saying, \"Here, sink your teeth into this!\" Since the sliver isn't even something big enough to swallow, much less chew, The recipient, embarrassed, just slinks off."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"He just cannot keep his big mouth shut; Behind their backs, he'll ape the way some people speak or eat-To make all the others snigger.

Not only does he not lend anything to his friends, But he begs to be given, or sneaks off with, Their belongings, their money, their food, And even their stakes, rope, and string-Or else he just steals them. When his friends say, \"Don't you see that we're having trouble?\" · He shouts back, \"Ah, what's eating you?\" And after a while, he wails \"Ah! Oh! Oh!\" And grumbles, \"I should never have gone with these people!\" In the middle, When the bad traveler Arrives in U, what does he do? He buys hats, felt, cups, corals, turquoise, And other articles for his own enjoyment, But never makes a single offering of tea or distribution of alms. He never does prostrations or circumambulations, but strolls about the marketplace. He never says daily prayers, but gossips and tells stories. He has no faith and devotion and is thoroughly warped within. All the goods in the marketplace--When he sees them every day, his desire mcreases. He steals the silver coins of his friends [189a], Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 21 7 And when he's caught, says, \"I'm terrih!Y sorry!\" He gives lavish presents to the ladies of the evenmg, Sleeps with them, and ends up with the clap. He tells many lies, says divisive things, And meddles in the affairs of good friends, Causing discord and ill will. He backbites his friends, and the represen-tatives from his homeland, Covering the whole ofU and Tsang with evil rumors. In the end, When this bad traveler goes back to his re_gion, He does not bring a single sacred object related to Buddha's body, speech, or mind, But sets offloaded down with goods. On the way, if a weakened packhorse of one ofhis friends dies, Not only does he not lend him another horse, But he curses his friend, saying, \"You just bring bad luck!\" On the way, if one of his friends falls ill, He's irked, and tries to get rid of him. On the road, he looks at the humble dwellings To see ifhe could possibly steal something. Evil speech, evil mind, evil conduct! Traveling on and on with him, things get worse and worse.

In the future, his countrymen will use him as an infamous example. All of you who travel to central Tibet, Please don't behave like this! May this song benefit all those Who hear or read it on their way to U and Tsang [189b]. After that, I sang Haw to Canduct Oneseffin aNoble W191: I bow down at the feet of the divine refuge and protector of all beings, I bow down at the feet of the Victorious Ones, Father and Son: Look with compassion upon all long-distance travelers Bound for central Tibet. At the start, The good traveler Puts a good saddle and a good saddle-pad On his packhorse, and gives it A light and comfortable load. He does not rush his horse, but takes his time. He brings not a single sheep to eat, And on the way, does not kill a single wild animal.

So, for those few months, one should share whatever comes, Good times or bad times, Helping each other as much as possible, Without quarreling or fighting.\" Regarding how to go and where to stop, He takes the advice of experienced travelers who have taken the road before. Withstanding hardships of cold or hunger, he works well-He pitches tents, unloads and stacks the luggage, Fetches water, collects firewood, and starts up the fire with the bellows: Whatever is needed. While resting or on the move, he eagerly says, \"I'll do it.\" He is always ready to get up and ready to go. When his tum comes to watch the horses, he takes good care of them. When it rains, when crossing rivers, when night falls, He reminds everyone to be careful. When he sees bandits, he tries to reason with them; If they don't listen, he rushes at them, spear in hand: No question oflosing his own things-He even takes away the bandits' hoard!

To the J owo statue he offers a new coat of gold and a hundred butter-lamps; To the beggars he gives alms of food and drink, From the butchers he ransoms goats and sheep. With body he does prostrations and circumambulations. With speech he exerts himself in daily prayers and recitations. With mind, he keeps faith, devotion, and pure VISIOn.

To load an immense burden on a packhorse, Till it can't budge, to beat the horse with sticks and stones That fill its whole body with pain, To leave it at night where there is no grass or water, To abandon it to be eaten alive by wolves or ravens When at last its back is covered with sores And its legs are lame and injured: There is no crime worse than this. Please treat your pack animals with kindness. The sheep become attached to the master Who drives them along on great distances [19la]. Wherever he goes, they follow him, Wherever he stays, they stay as well. If they don't see their master they start to bleat; When they see him, they joyfully rush toward him. One day, when they are resting, trusting their owner and completely at ease, Their owner grabs one, ties its mouth to smother it, Slits open its belly, and pulls out its red life-vein with his hand: This is just like murdering an old friend. One cannot conceive of a greater shame. Though he has made the pilgrimage to central Tibet, Such a man has not gained virtue, but only committed sin. So, please do not take along sheep to slaughter for food on the way. In the wilderness, Many innocent wild animals live, Eating free grass and drinking free water. Even if the sight of such beauty doesn't move you, You must not shoot and kill them. Wild animals are like the pets of the local deities, And if one kills them, diseases will plague men and animals. Hail, thunder, lightning, snowstorms, landslides, And flash floods will bring suffering to all. So, don't shoot and kill wild animals! The Jowo Shakyas, and the Victorious Ones, Father and Son, Look lovingly on each sentient being as they would their child. Therefore, if you take life, No matter how much wealth you offer them, they will never be pleased. When on the way to pay homage to the twoJowos, If you think there is no harm in doing evil And you perform unvirtuous deeds, This is creating bad karma in connection with Dharma-This is the worst possible karma. Someone who is traveling to the feet of the twoJowos In order to confess his previous negative acts And commits even more negative actions on the way, Is merely adding evil deeds to evil deeds, So that nothing ever gets purified. Therefore, don't commit evil acts at any time [191 b]."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"May all travelers who hear this song Never commit negative actions.

It is hard to get more than one chance to see The Victorious Ones, Father and Son, the twojowos, And the sangha of the three monasteries-Sera, Drepung, and Ganden. 14 It is a rare chance in this life To travel to the distant land ofU. So, if you have possessions to offer, take them with you, For, if you leave them behind, Thinking to offer them in a future pilgrim-age, This may never happen. On the journey, unable to bear hardships like hunger and cold, A traveler might grow angry and threaten others. He argues over the size of his share of hunks of meat, His share of tsampa, bread, and butter, and even over how much tea is poured into his cup. Ifhe has a full stomach, he shows a smiling face and chats happily. If he is hungry, he gives dark looks and speaks nastily. When he is on guard watch, he is completely unreliable; When there is no danger, he shouts out, 'Wake up! Run! Come!\" But when the danger is real, he sleeps more soundly than a corpse, Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 221 And though you call his name many times, he won't wake up. Don't behave like this! Such a bad fellow is only concerned about his homeland; He does not visit pilgrimage places, but gossips about home. He never does prostrations or circumambulations; And even worse, he doesn't even let his friends do any either. When the time approaches to go home, he just says, \"Let's get out ofhere!\" When leaving central Tibet, don't say such things. When the travelers arrive in their homelands, everyone rejoices, And rushes up in welcome, asking after their travels: \"0 mother, 0 uncle, you lucky ones, What did you see and what did you visit? How many prostrations and circumambulations did you do? What religious offerings did you make? [192a]. Surely you have collected relics ofbody, speech, and mind; please, give me one!\" How shameful if there is no answer!

When crossing the second valley and river, Looking back, I think of my mother. And why do I think of my mother? My mother and her dzomo are both greatly kind. When crossing the third valley and river Looking back, I think of my younger brothers and sisters. And why do I think of my brothers and sisters? My siblings and their colts are all so very young.

To take the cantle of a saddle as an example, It is like the place and parents one has left behind. Pulling back on the light bit, One feels like staying on [192b]. To take these three as an example: The tall wooden saddle, its covering carpet, And the leather pads underneath, They are like the hearthstones put out by three brothers; Dismounting, one feels like stopping a bit to play. A few of the women shed tears when they heard these songs, which reminded them of home. Another singer joined with this happy song: Upon a yellow golden throne, A qualified teacher feels at ease. Upon a white silver throne, A meritorious chief feels at ease. Upon a swift striding horse, An elegant skilled youth feels at ease. How do you like this kind of song? Saying this, they laughed.

Every day my fellow travelers and the chief merchants killed some of the sheep they had brought along, and thus the number of sheep dwindled. Out of compassion, paying three sang for every sheep, I ransomed the lives of about thirty-five of them, which I then brought with me. One important merchant on his way to cen-tral Tibet with his caravan had left behind two monk escorts of Kumbum Monastery who had fallen sick and [193b] a Khampa household of five travelers whose horse and dzo had collapsed from exhaustion.

The Chod practitioner from Arik Tromtsa and many other pilgrims from Dorney and Mongolia were also there. Together, we received the empowerment of the Great Compassionate Kmg of the S9'.28 On another occasion, Khardo Rin-poche gave me a long-life empowerment from Thangtong Gyalpo 's Oral Transmission29 and, later, the transmission for several of his own mind treasures. 30 Whenever I met him, filled with faith and devotion I felt it was the same as if I was meeting the Dharma King Terdak Lingpa and other tertons of the past.

All were pleased [200a]. When paying homage to the sacred objects ofbody, speech, and mind at the Potala, Lhasa 1bil, Chakpori, Ling Sum, Gyu To, Gyu Me, Meru, Shi De,50 Sera, and Ganden, I offered hundreds of ceremonial scarves and made many prayers of aspiration. I offered tea to all those monastic communities and requested their spiri-tual protection. I distributed alms and tea to all, and offered a permanent fund to our provincial headquar-ters.51 Especially, I offered to the Vaishravana Treasury of the Upper Palace52 an endowment of eight hundred silver coins and a porcelain cup filled with turquoise and corals. From the Upper Palace, I was given fifty coins of the purest gold. I entrusted these coins to Shiwa Tsering, the gold-smith master from Do pel, 53 and to Chakzam Khenpo for the making of a gold butter-lamp, inscribed with this prayer: The devoted Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Chador, and others from Dorney Offer this lamp of gold at the feet ofjowo Rinpoche, The sole ornament of the world, the supreme object of offering and obeisance. Pilgrimage to Central Tibet 231 By the power of this offering, may the teaching of the Buddha spread, May its holders have long life, and May all beings have happiness in the present, And ultimately attain Buddhahood. I presented the lamp before the Supreme Protector at the top of the Potala. Very pleased, he threw auspicious rice to consecrate it, made compassionate prayers, and told me, ''You have accumulated merit. When you place this before thejowo, make fervent prayers,\" and gave me a long ceremonial scarf [200b]. On the occasion of the Great Prayer Festi-val of the new year, on the fifteenth day, I took the butter-lamp to the top of the Labrang and showed it to the ministers seated there. I offered it and it was entered in the official register. Almost everyone, gods and men, said, \"He surely has accumulated merit,\" and rejoiced. When the ministers read the inscription engraved on the lamp of solid gold, they put it above their heads and made prayers. The minister, Kalan Trim on, said, \"You have accumulated merit. When you offer it in the temple, dedicate it to the long life of the two Victorious Ones, Father and Son, and the Guard-ian of the Skies, 54 as well as to the prosperity of the Buddha's teachings and all sentient beings.

That same day I filled it with melted butter and offered it at the feet ofthejowo Shakya-mum. I arranged vast offerings and invited many monks from Lubum Khamtsen. I offered them tea, soup, and a silver coin each. They per-formed the Offering to the Gurus and concluded with many stainless prayers. All of us, master and disciples, recited the butter-lamp prayer, as can be found in The Blaz-ing Jewel That Grants All Wzshes [20 l a]. 55 I sent Alak Tsondru, Gelong Ngawang Dargye, and the Chad practitioner back home to Dorney. Alak Tsondru went into retreat for life in the Trika mountains. As a result of his practice, he"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"232 Th£ Life of Shabkar became able to benefit the Dharma and sentient beings.56 Gelong Ngawang Dargye went to Mangra and other mountain retreats, and through his efforts became an excellent practitio-ner. The Chod practitioner gave up \"red offer-ings\"57 and was able to help many sick people by performing rituals in the villages. My spiritual son Kunzang Rangdrol received many empowerments and teachings from Khardo Chokyi Dorje, Terton Sala Rinpoche, Chogyal Lhagyari, and many other lamas of U and Lokha. Mter staying one year in these areas, he returned to Dorney. There he practiced the two stages of the Secret Mantrayana and the profound path of Chad, and became a realized sky-like yogin who brought delusion to an end. Through his Chod practice he brought great benefit to beings. Shohong Bendhe was sent on pilgrimage where he visited the three perfect sacred places, met three excellent lamas, and became a renunciate free of clinging and attachment. I myself did circumambulations and pros-trations for a few months, paying over and over again my respects to thejowo oflliasa. One day I stayed in front ofthejowo a long time, making such fervent prayers that I became absorbed in a state of profound samadhi. Mter-ward, when I was walking along on the outer circumambulation path, I saw many sheep and goats that had been slaughtered [20 I b]. Feeling unbearable compassion for all animals in the world who are killed for food, I went back before thejowo Rinpoche, prostrated myself, and made this vow: \"From today on, I give up the negative act that is eating the flesh of beings, each one of whom was once my parent.\" From then on, although I engaged in many activities to benefit beings, no one ever killed animals as food to offer me. I even heard that, knowing that I was coming, some faithful patrons said, \"This lama does not even eat the meat of animals that have died a natural death. Don't leave any meat around where he will see it,\" and they hid whatever there was. The fact that the lives of animals were no longer being taken on my account was, I thought, due to the compas-sion ofthejowo hirnsel£ Near Lhasa, at the Upper Cholung Valley, \"the Dharma Valley,\"58 was a place called Zhalung, \"the Valley ofNettles,\" where the Lord of Beings, Lama Shang Yudrak,59 once lived. There was a temple with a statue of the Four-armed Mahakala. I explained to the temple-keeper, named Gonpo, how I happened to have come there, and told him that I wanted to do retreat for a year in that sacred place. Very pleased, he gave me a place to stay, and turned out to be hospitable and helpful later, he became my disciple and, after I gave him empowerments and instructions, he practiced medi-tation and became a self-liberated yogin. The next summer I received an invitation from the Lubum Khamtsen ofDrepung. I went to Drepung and stayed there a few days. The discussions we held about the Ancient and New Traditions pleased all the geshes. At this time, I also did prostrations and circumambulations at Drepung and Lhasa, and went to pay homage to all the sacred relics [202a]. An epidemic of fever broke out in Lhasa, and Gonpo caught it. 'When we came back to Zhalung, he became so ill that he was unable to get out ofbed for a few days. I gave him blessings and some medicine; after a few days he recov-ered. 'When he was better, I fell ill; my fever raged for several days. In my feverish state I had the deluded vision of a temple burning down. The deities inside the temple, far from being burnt, became even more resplendent. I saw Pure Realms in all four directions and when I felt like going to one, an imposing black man stopped me saying, \"No, don't go!\" During my sickness, I prayed to my teacher and to the 1bree Jewels, and visualized a con-tinuous cool stream of cleansing nectar flowing inside my body and purifYing me. Gonpo went to lliasa and brought back medicine from the physician ofDoring. With this auspicious help, I quickly recovered. Gonpo and I performed a ga:nachakra feast in front of the Four-armed Mahakala"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"I then happened to run out of food. For a few days I ate only a few roasted peas. Gonpo went to perform rituals for some patrons of Cholung, and when he told them that I had exhausted my provisions, the administrator of Kushojamyang Shepa, the administrator of the chief merchant Namkhai Dzo, and some local chieftains gave some tea, butter, and tsampa, which Gonpo brought to me. Water had always been scarce in that valley, but from the year I lived there onward, water became plentiful and crops were abundant. This fortunate event increased the faith of the patrons of the Upper Cholung Valley, rich and poor, and prompted them to help me during my stay and when I left [202b]. At that time, the wise, devoted, diligent, and compassionate Gelong Lobzang Oser was on pilgrimage. He had gone from the Lotus Lake in To to the Great Stupa of Bodhnath in Nepal. Since all prayers made in front of this stupa are fulfilled, he did prostrations and circumambula-tions, offered many butter-lamps, and made this wish: \"In this lifetime, as quickly as possible, may I have the good fortune to meet a qualified teacher and receive his profound instructions. Following the example of the holy beings of the past, may I live in retreat in the mountains, making the length of my practice equal to the length of my life.\" On the way back; he eventually arrived in Lhasa, where he met Ngawang Nyentrak Rinpoche from Chakyung in Amdo, 60 then throne-holder ofGanden and tutor of the Sover-eign of the Upper Palace.61 By merely hearing about me from this abbot, Lobzang Oser felt great devotion and came straight to meet me. When he arrived I was sitting outside my door, in the shade of a beautiful bush of wild roses. The air was filled with the melodious buzzing of bees and I was singing ~his song, Vzctory Over the Obscur-ing Emot:Wns: Ema!

On my bow--the skillful means of generosity and the other paramitas--1 placed an arrow-the perfect view-Drew it tight with fierce diligence and endeavor, And shot into the midst of the enemy army-the obscuring emotions. It struck the heart of the general-ego-clinging-And pierced his vital artery-deluded Ignorance. He fell senseless on the ground of egolessness, And the army of the eighty-four thousand conflicting emotions Fled, routed, in complete panic. Today the yogin won; He beat the great victory drum-the sublime Dharma-And hoisted the great flag of joy. The fears of samsara have vanished; I now relax on the plain of great bliss. Ema!

Hearing this song, Lobzang Oser ceased taking illusory phenomena as real, concrete enti-ties, and remained in a state of pristine clarity, free of thoughts. Thinking that the coincidence of his arrival with my song was auspicious, immeasurable faith and joy arose in him. He prostrated himself, and offered me some nut-megfi2 and a silk scarf. With fervent devotion, he explained in detail all he had done until then and asked me to give him empowerments and spiri-tual guidance [203b]. I said, \"You have offered me medicine, so I will offer you medicine--the medicine of the sublime Dharma, the cure for the obscuring emotions.\" Gradually, I gave him all the empowerments and special instructions. As an auspicious omen that he might hold the Buddha's teaching, the source of peace and benefit, and be of help to all beings, I gave him the name Tendzin Nyima, \"Sun-like Holder of the Teaching.\" Thus having declared him a son of Shakyamuni Buddha, I gave him this heart-advice: I supplicate the compassionate Buddha.

In answer to their greetings and inquiries about my well-being, I sang this song entitled 7he Yogin's Happiness: Venerable master who bestows the Dharma, Source ofbliss and excellence, Rest on the crown of my head in a sphere of rainbow light.

Of this gold I used seven large coins for the casting of a statue ofBuddha Shakyamuni, about a hand-span high. I had his throne and back support cast in silver, inlaid with turquoise and · corals. After performing the consecration, I placed the statue on the heads of all, masters and dis-ciples, and prayed that we might attain Buddha-hood together. For a few years I kept the statue constantly with me, and then offered it to Tsemon Lingpa, the regent-king ofTibet.65 Out of the horses, cattle, silver, and cloth offered to me, I gave enough to Kalden Rangdrol and Kunzang Shenpen for them to buy them-selves provisions for pilgrimage to the Tsari Ravines. I used the rest as offerings to make spiritual connections with the two protectors, Father and Son, with Khardo Chokyi Dorje, and with other lamas. I offered tea and money to Sera, Drepung, and Ganden, and to our provin-cial headquarters, dedicating the merit to the attainment of complete enlightenment [206b]. Then Kunzang Rangdrol, Kalden Rangdrol, Tendzin Nyima, Tsondru Gyatso, and many other faithful disciples and householders offered stainless white scarves with this request: 'When you came to Bhanak Khasum, and to Upper, Lower, and Middle Tibet, you taught the Dharma, mainly about karma-the law of cause and effect-in simple, ordinary language.

Rasa Trulnang Tsuklagkhang (rasa 'phrul snang gtsug log klzang), the \"Goat Field's Manifested Temple,\" is commonly known as thejokhang (jo kh.ang, see note 12) from the name of its central chapel. To shelter the most precious statue ofTibet, thejowo Shakyamuni (see above, note 13), King Songtsen Gampo, through his miraculous powers, had this temple built with the earth carried by a single goat. The \"Goat Field\" (ra sa) is the ancient name of the place; it later was called the \"God's [i.e., King's] Field\" (fha sa).

At the end of the dream Buddhapalita stood up and blessed Tsongkhapa with a volume of his commentary on the Madlryamaka-ka.rika. Following this dream, Tsongkhapa attained a high degree of understanding of the ultimate reality while reading a verse of Buddhapalita that states that \"the self is neither different from, nor identi-cal to, the aggregates.\" The same day, Tsongkhapa wrote this praise to the Lord Buddha, the Awakened One who first realized this truth.

So, at the beginning of the eleventh month of the year of the female Iron Sheep, 2 I left Cholung. I asked Khenpo Shiwa Tsering of Dopel for a letter of introduction soliciting the deputy-treasurer of the supreme protector, Drukpa Rinpoche,3 to help me in Tsari. I assured him that his kindness would be repaid. Since Topden, the governor ofE Kyilkhor, was returning home from lliasa, I went with him. On the way, we spent a day visiting all the sanctuaries and sacred images of Samye, the Glorious Immutable Temple that has been praised in coundess ways. The great master, Guru Padmasambhava, said: Unique under the sun is Samye, \"the Inconceivable,\" Equal to the Diamond Throne oflndia.4 For whoever sees Samye, The gates oflower rebirth are shut; Whoever circumambulates Samye, even a butcher, Will be reborn in the higher realms; Whoever bows down to Samye Will rise to ever greater excellence. On meeting the abbot, I offered him one silver sang and requested the blessing of Vajrakilaya [209a]. I made offerings and prayers and went to the houshold of the meritorious patron, the noble-243 man Tsachanga, to whom I gave a wild mule. In return, he gave me whatever provisions I needed. Then I met Tertbn Sala Rinpoche of Neuring, who was ill at the time, and offered him a good-natured mule. I asked for a teaching to establish a spiritual connection. For several days I offered prayers for his long life; he gave me some presents and whatever I might need. Passing through Chogyallliagya's5 pastures, I reached Char Sang-ngak Choling and entered the presence of the supreme refuge, the omni-scient Drukpa. I offered him nine sang, and when I told him the circumstances of my coming he was very pleased. I then presented the abbot's letter to the deputy treasurer, who, after reading it, gave me valuable help and offered to look after my personal effects. A few days later, I passed Chbzam and Dotsen rest house,6 and reached the Mandala Plain off sari. I stayed there several days while people from all directions were gathering. Some said prayers and did prostrations, some sang, danced, and played music, and some offeredganachokra feasts. Government officials gave two yaks to the lliopa tribesmen; they gave one the first day and the other the next. The yaks were tied up; many lliopas gathered, pulled out knives of all sizes, and cut the legs, hide, and flesh from the yaks' bodies while they were still alive.

Then, in the male Water Monkey Year,11 called Angira, on the third day of the first month, we were divided in groups12 and, accordingly, we set off single file on the pilgrimage of the Ravines. On the way, I met some sick people on the verge of death, and came upon some corpses as well. I offered my spiritual protection to the sick and performed the transference of consciousness for the dead. Some, left behind by their companions, un-able to travel further, were simply sitting there The Ravines ofTsari 245 and weeping. Approaching them, I tried to com-fort them, saying, \"The stream of pilgrims is not exhausted yet; rest for a few days and continue on when you feel stronger.\" Before continuing my journey, I left medicines and provisions with them. Some people carried their ailing friends, while others carried their friends' burdens. Ap-proaching them, I said, \"You have fidelity and concern. Relax now and rest; we are near the Shag River.\" Thus I tried to hearten them. In other cases as well, I always did my best to take care of those in difficulty. Nearly every-one faced severe hardships and I felt great pity for them. When similar difficulties befell me, I visualized that all my obscurations and negative acts were being cleansed [211 a] . When we fmally reached Yulmeh at the end of the circuit, everyone was cheerful and relieved. At Chozam 13 all the pilgrims boiled some tea and drank it. Each person packed his or her things, and after having put those aside, most of the pilgrims gathered round me. They asked me: \"Where will you go? Please visit, at least once, our homelands-Kongpo and Kham!\" I answered that I was going on pilgrimage to the three holy places-Tsari, Mount Kailash, and Lapchi-and added: \"I pray to come to your homelands, yet human birth and death are unpredictable. If the distance between us prevents us from meeting again, I shall pray that you be protected in this and in future lives. \"Realize that death strikes without warning; do not be attached to this life; practice some Dharma for the sake of your next lives. Even if you are not able to practice a great deal, at least renounce the evil ofkilling. When dying, remem-ber your spiritual master and the Three Jewels. Pray to them, and we will have the good fortune to meet again in a Pure Realm.\" Thus I gave them much advice. As their hearts were with me, they remained there, trans-fixed, not leaving.

We, master and disciples, went back to Char Sang-ngak Choling, the seat ofDrukpa Rinpoche.

Because medita-tion experiences and realization occur instantaneously in this secluded place, it is called Chikchar, which means \"all at once\" [212a].16 There one finds an extremely beautiful golden-roofed temple 17 that houses many blessed objects symbolic of enlightened body, speech, and mind. Chief among these is a dazzlingly resplendent image of the two-headed Varahi.18 Larger than human size, made of many kinds of precious jewels, this image seems alive. It was made by the very hands of the omniscient Perna Karpo, 19 a manifestation of Padmapani. On a hillside nearby lies a beautiful meadow with trees spread out like a lattice of turquoise, sapphire, and pearls; it is known as Yangon, which means \"completely secluded.\" I stayed there in solitary retreat for one year and one month in a pleasant meditation hut just large enough for one person. On auspicious days I experienced visions of many dakas and dakinis coming and going in the direction of the Turquoise Lake Palace.20 I joined their ganachrlkra feast and listened to their vajra songs. Mter this, through the blessings of the dakinis, I developed spontaneous faith and respect for the Path of Means relied on by the yogins who practice the development and completion stages of the Secret Mantrayana, and for teach-ings and practitioners of all levels. I saw all of them as pure. One day, after having heard all sorts of curious stories from many places, I sang this: Some vassal kings of the land of Kancha, Kill their old fathers before seizing the kingdom. Some savages from a comer of the southern land ofMon, Kill their old mothers before taking a wife. Some Nepalese, when a husband dies, Bum the wife alive when they bum the husband's corpse [212b]. Some heretic kings Sacrifice their mothers to Maheshvara. Some barbarians in the land ofLo Kill as many animals as they possibly can, Thinking to benefit their dead parents. Some people in Kongpo believe that by poisoning others Their own good fortune will increase. Hearing that in the world so many people Act in such perverted ways,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"I feel pity for those who do not understand That the fruit of evil deeds is suffering. A person who is fortunate to be born in an age And place where the highest Dharma flourishes, And who, owing to the kindness of an authentic spiritual master, Is able to differentiate virtue and nonvirtue, Yet still commits evil actions, Is like a man who jumps knowingly into an abyss. There is no madness greater than this! Wise ones, practice virtue! Having sung this, it became clear to me that my sound understanding of karma, the law of cause and effect, was due to my gurus' kindness. Thereafter, I applied myself more than ever to giving up evil and to doing what is right. As Jetsun Mila said: Ifl die, I am happy: I didn't do evil. If I live, I am happy: I will further my virtuous practice. The truth of these verses struck me, and I felt extremely happy, thinking that even if I were to die this very moment I would have nothing to regret. Then a devoted and wealthy patroness, Yidzin lhamo, \"Enchanting Goddess,\" requested some advice to remind her of virtue. I offered her the following words: Though now you delight in wearing Ornaments of gold, turquoise, and coral, When leaving for the next life, Leaving all that jewelry behind, You will be sad. Though now you enjoy the company Of your friends, beautiful and noble-minded, When leaving for the next life [213a ], Parting with your family, You will be sad. The Ravines ofTsari 247 Though now you delight at having gathered All the possessions, food, and wealth that you need, When leaving for the next life, Leaving all these_possessions behind, You will be sad. Though now you rejoice at having This jewel-like human body, free and well-favored, When leaving for the next life, Empty-handed, without Dharma, You will be sad. Therefore, Yidzin Lhamo, Do not assume that you'lllive long. Do not entertain excessive craving or attachment Toward friends, food, and wealth. Knowing that death will strike without wammg, Do not delight in adornments of turquoise and coral; Do not be spiteful to your spouse; Do not be mean with wealth; Do not indulge in meaningless distractions. Use your body to do prostrations and circumambulations. Use your speech to say prayers and recitations. Use your mind to have faith, respect, and pure perception. Cultivate loving-kindness and compassiOn; Make offerings to the guru and the Three Jewels; Give to those in need; Serve the members of the sangha; And be kind in all ways to your servants.

I pray that in the life hereafter We may meet again in a Pure Land. Thus I gave her this advice. She acted accord-ingly, and by the time of her death, she had entered the Path. One day, my spiritual son Kunzang Shenpen, \"Ever-perfect Benevolence,\" asked me to sing a praise of the sacred Caritra. My words could only praise a few drops of the ocean of perfec-tions of this glorious place, which fortunate beings with pure perception and karma see as the heav-enly realm ofKhechara,21 a vast Buddhafield in which peaceful and wrathful deities dwell, num-berless as the sesame seeds in an opened pod [213b]: White and brilliant, the color of white crystal, The central mountain is like a king on his throne, Surrounded by a host oflesser mountains as ministers. Multicolored flowers blanket the whole place. Blossoms and fruit bedeck the trees. Its meadows are like golden trays Carrying their blue lakes like mandalas of turquoise; Its rivers unfold like white silken scarves. Wild geese sound the sonorous drum of their throats, While, like reed flutes, small birds trill. Bees are humming, dancing. Here mind is content and awareness clear. Here is the dwelling place of many siddJuJs of the past, The fields where dakas and dakinis gather. Most exalted among the twenty-four holy places, Wondrous as the pure paradise, Khechara, This is glorious Caritra: In the center, on the immaculate crystal mountain, Dwell two thousand eight hundred deities.22 In each of the surrounding hills, rocks, and lakes Are countless dakas and dakinis. The men and women who live here Are all of the race of dakas and dakinis. Whoever stays here to practice the Dharma Will find that meditation experiences, realization, and positive qualities blossom. He or she will see the faces of dakas and dakinis In reality, in dreams, or in visions. Here, performing a single sacramental feast, Making a single offering, lighting a single lamp [214a], Will increase life and merit. At the time of death, dakas and dakinis Will lead one to the pure celestial field of Khacho. To do a single prostration or circumambulation Will shut the doors to the three lower realms, and Even a very sinful person Will be reborn in the higher realms of gods or men.

If! were to speak for a thousand aeons with a thousand tongues, It would never suffice to describe The outer, inner, and secret qualities of this sacred place. This is why you, faithful men and women, Should always pay your respects to it with offerings, Praise, circumambulations, and prostrations. My words are in accord with those of the sages of the past; therefore you should hold them to be true, and make offerings, prostrations, and circumambulations. Thus I exhorted all the pil-grims gathered there. On one occasion, I received the transmis-sion of the biography and spiritual songs of the omniscient Padma Karpo from the vajra holder of Chikchar, Ngaktra Tulku Rinpoche.23 I also requested from the great siddha Damcho Zangpo the instructions on the Six rogas of Naropa and on the Hundred and Eight Combined rogic Exercises [214b].24 To demonstrate the power of tummo25 prac-tice, the .thirteen great yogins ofChikchar retreat center used to go out in the dead of winter, wearing only a single cotton shawl, and spend a night in the snow at the edge of the glaciers. Early the next morning, the tsulpas, 26 the patrons of Tsari, would come to greet them with cano-pies and banners. Seeing all the yogins approach-ing, steam rising from their bodies, everyone felt overwhelming faith in these sons ofMilarepa. Then Kunzang Rangdrol, my fortunate and excellent spiritual son, endowed with the good karma accrued through training in his previous lives, and Kalden Rangdrol, who was rich in the noble virtues of faith, generosity, and wisdom, urged me to compose a detailed teaching for the benefit of the present and future disciples dwell-The Ravines ofTsari 249 ing in mountain retreats. Accordingly, I com-posed the text called Ben¢cial Moon, ornament-ing it with sayings of the saints of the Kagyu lineage. Giving many reasons for their request, they also asked for a teaching according to the non-sectarian point of view, that would generate faith, respect, and pure perception in everyone's minds. So, I composed the Ben¢cial Jewel and the Offer-ing-Cloud of Samantabhadra, 27 ornamenting these with scriptural quotations and with my own un-derstanding. When I gave the transmission for these texts to my spiritual son Kunzang, I visualized myself as the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, emanating rays of light from my heart, inviting all the Bud-dhas and Bodhisattvas of the three times and the ten directions and all other worthy objects of offering without exception. I then visualized clouds of offerings, real and imaginary, filling the whole sky, and offered these to the Buddhas with praises and prayers. I invoked their blessings to make me able to benefit the Dharma and all beings [215a]. I then visualized all the beings of the billionfold universe in front of me, imagining that, as the melodious sound of the Dharma fell upon their ears, they would understand both the words and the meaning. I gave the transmission, reading with a clear, loud voice; at the end I placed the volumes on Kunzang's head, praying that these teachings might benefit all those who would see, hear, remember, or touch them. At that very moment, by the blessings of the deities and dakinis of this sacred place-which I was visualizing as a perfect Buddhafield-in the sky before me, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas appeared vividly, smiling in approval, emanat-ing from their hearts a multitude of light rays that illuminated the entire universe. They said: \"0 son of the Victorious Ones, it will be so! These wonderful new teachings fulfill the wishes of the Buddhas and will satisfy the minds of all beings. Noble son, you are truly the heir of the Victorious Ones; we enthrone you as protector and refuge of all beings.\" Thus, as they graced and honored me, all the dakas, dakinis, and guardians of the Dharma performed graceful dances, and sang \"Immov-"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"250 The Life oJShabkar able Meru ... \"28 and other auspicious songs. Clouds of rainbow light appeared, flowers fell like rain, and the sound of cymbals resounded [215b]. Besides this vision, a five-colored rainbow appeared in the sky, a rain of white flowers fell, and the sound of conches, drums, and other instruments resounded. These were seen and heard by almost everyone nearby. It was a most auspicious omen for both of us, master and dis-ciple. The thought that in the future these teach-ings would help many beings delighted me as much as ifl had attained the bhumi of Complete Joy.29 In this mood I sang many more songs of happiness. Once, some of the greatyogins of the retreat center of Chikchar asked me, \"Who is your teacher? What instructions did he give you? What practices have you done?\" First I answered directly, and then I sang this song: In the beginning I took the teacher as · teacher, In the middle I took the scriptures as teacher, In the end I took my own mind as teacher. From the teacher who showed the path of deliverance, I received the sacred pratimnksha teachings:30 My practice was to shun wrongdoing and cultivate virtue. From the Bodhisattva teacher, I received the sacred Mahayana teachings on generating Bodhicitta: My practice was to cherish others more than mysel£ From the Vajradhara teacher, I received the sacred teachings, Initiations and instructions of the Secret Mantrayana: My practice was to meditate upon the development and completion stages, and the Great Perfection. From many other teachers, I received many sublime teachings, Thus establishing spiritual connections: My practice was to cultivate faith, respect, and pure perception. This song pleased them and enhanced their faith. Again, some people said [216a], \"It's amazing that your songs seem to burst forth from space, unhindered, whenever you want, without your having to-make any effort as others do.\" In reply I sang this song as it arose in my mind: The white eagle, the rishi, 3! Having grown feathers and wings in the nest, Flung himself from the cliff and flew out into the sky. Now he soars higher and higher into space. I, the disciple of an authentic guru, Having heard the teachings and Contemplated them in my master's presence, Severed all doubts and misconceptions, and then wandered off into the wilderness. Now I persevere in my meditation. The divine bird, the beautiful snow grouse,32 Sought grass and water among the rocky crags. Now it dwells at the edge of the snows, Sounding its musical call in the misty heights. I, a bard from the Land of Snows, Sought food and clothing in valleys and nomad camps. Now I dwell in mountain seclusion Singing songs among my heart-sons. The fully grown deer with ten-branched antlers Gazing afar from the mountaintop Descends into the valleys, playing and running as it goes, And again returns to its rocky heights.

Again some asked, \"Why did the hermits and great meditators of the past, and some recent masters and practitioners, sing so many spiritual songs?\" I answered, \"This is a sign that medita-tion experiences and realization have flowered within them,\" and I improvised this song: On the mountain covered with gleaming, golden meadows, The grazing wild animals, sleek and con-tent, sing their song: It is the sign that they have had their fill of grass and water. In the fields of yellow summer flowers The six-legged bees sing their song: It is the sign that they have had their fill of honey.

In the solitude of mist-shrouded peaks The renunciate yogin sings his song: It is the sign that meditation experiences and true realization have dawned. On another occasion, someone asked, \"When the holy beings of old sang their vajra songs, it brought great benefit; has the same benefit accrued from your songs?\" In reply, I sang of how many disciples had been benefited [217a]: All the wise sages of old, from India and Tibet, Expressed in song the meaning of the sutras and tantras, And, by doing so, immensely benefited beings. I also sang, in accord with the words of the holy ones, Of the way to rely on the father guru; Many came to follow in this way.

When I sang of how, having received teachings on sutra, tantra, and pith instructions, I practiced meditation to realize these teachings, Many who had listened to the Dharma began to practice. When I sang of the fruit of Dharma practice In mountain retreats where past saints lived, Many went to live in solitary places. When I sang that all the philosophical VIews Flourishing in the land of Tibet were pure traditions, Many developed pure perception [21 7b]. Someone else said, \"In central Tibet, we con-sider that the distinctive sign of a practitioner is that he wanders alone in cemeteries and remote, uninhabited mountains.\" I answered with this song: Mighty Vishnu, blessed with miraculous powers, Moves throughout all of space Fearless of the sun, moon, stars, and planets: This is the distinctive sign of his great might. The golden wild duck, the king of migrating birds, Soars throughout the vastness of the sky Fearless of the most turbulent winds: This is the distinctive sign of its powerfully feathered wings.

When I attended the authentic guru I obeyed his every command. When I prayed wholeheartedly, I was unable to contain my tears. When I remembered the unpredictability of the time of death [218a], I grew diligent in study, reflection, and meditation."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"When I considered the flaws of sensory enjoyments, I grew utterly weary of worldly pleasures. When I stayed in secluded mountains, Not a thought alien to Dharma passed through my mind. When I remained in the natural state, I saw a spectacle that I had never seen before.

When I expounded the teachings on cause and effect, Gods, men, and demons were stirred by faith. When I sang melodious songs, Even the gandharvas smiled. 33 As I sang this, a yearning faith grew in them. One day I watched an eagle, the king of birds, gliding in the sky and, as it soared higher and higher, this song burst into my mind: You, royal eagle, soaring in the firmament, Circling in the midst of the azure sky, In whichever of the four directions you go, Carry this message of mine.

Once, some people asked me, ''When you were doing the pilgrimage of the Tsari Ravines, \"Yhat came into your mind?\" In answer, I sang this: When I made the pilgrimage of the Tsari Ravines-The paradise of Khechara on this earth [219a]. The amazing abode of the deities of the Three Roots-These thoughts arose in my mind: When traversing with difficulty the treacherous paths, The rivers and bridges of the land of llio, It occurred to me that it must indeed be like this When traveling the perilous paths of the bardo. When I saw those possessed of food and strength Going along joyfully, It occurred to me that it must indeed be like this When going to the next life possessed of Dharma. When I saw all those lacking food and resources Struggling along with great hardship, It occurred to me that it must be indeed like this When going to the next life without the Dharma. When I saw some people continuing on, Having abandoned their ailing friends, It occurred to me that the likes of these, indeed, Are what are called shameless friends. When I saw some people going along, Carrying their ailing friends on their backs, It occurred to me that these indeed are What are called real friends. When I saw some caring for and giving food To those bereft of everything, It occurred to me that these indeed are What are called Bodhisattvas. When I saw that many who were making the pilgrimage Were dying of starvation and illness, It occurred to me that those people indeed Had given their bodies and lives for the Dharma. When I saw pilgrims by the tens of thousands Part from each other and disperse, It occurred to me that indeed this showed The impermanence of all phenomena. At these words, everyone felt sadness and com-passion. One day, I sang this spontaneous song of experience [219b]: In mountain rock mansions, In the cool shade of forests, In small huts of green grass, Under tents of white cotton, I, the carefree yogin, Dwell at will.

I stayed in a solitary place In the continuum of the natural state--Like releasing a handful of cotton wool, I let consciousness relax, And it resumed its natural shape. The darkness of ignorance Having naturally cleared, There arose the vast sky Of the absolute expanse. As to whether this is the absolute nature, Not a question, not a hesitation Arises in my mind. Even if all the Buddhas were to appear before me, I would have no doubts for them to clarif)r.

This song pleased the realized yogins, the \"destroyers of delusion,\" who dwelled there. Then someone else asked, ''While you were alone in the mountains, since there was no one to desire and no circumstances to inspire desire, did lust arise in your mind?\" I answered, \"0 yes, many opportunities came to me, and, not only did desire arise, but I satisfied it!\" and, teasing, I sang this song: In the pleasure groves of isolated mountains, The six-legged dancing bee Is embraced and kissed By the exquisite lotus maiden. Many young birds, Bending their graceful necks And sending each other sidelong glances, Ride one upon another in their sensuous dance. Seeing this, I, the yogin, Became inflamed by intense desire.

When someone asked for a song about my medi-tation experiences, I sang this [220b]: When relying upon the perfect teacher, I felt that he was the Buddha himsel£ When receiving the profound and vast instructions, I felt they were like ambrosia. When contemplating the imperfections of samsara,. I felt samsara was like a prison. When meditating on compassion for all beings, I felt like a mother toward her children. When merging with emptiness, I felt it was like the vast sky. When practicing the development and completion stages, and the Great Perfection, It felt like arriving at the Unsurpassable Buddhafield. When dwelling in isolated mountains, I felt I was in a celestial realm. When staying alone with no companions, I felt like I was a rishi. When roaming through countries at random, I felt they were like my homeland. When meeting any sentient being, It felt like I was meeting my own kin. Once my fortunate spiritual son Kunzang Shenpen asked me, \"How should one remain in the nonmeditation samadhi that is like a con-tinuous stream? What is meant by 'stream'? Is there any risk of confusing this with another state?\" My answer was this song: Having received the fauldess instructions on Mahamudra or on Dzogchen, The unique path traveled by coundess Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, If you wish to remain uninterruptedly In the nonmeditation samadhi That is like a continuous stream, You must do this: Keep your body still; Keep your voice silent; As to mind, don't bind it: let it rest at ease [22la]. Let consciousness relax completely. At this time, attachment to \"meditation\"' and \"nonmeditation\" clears, And mind remains without any aim or fabrication In self-luminous awareness, vast and transparent. To remain just like this Is the view ofMahamudra and Dzogchen. If intellect does not tamper with this state, And if you are graced by blessings of your root and lineage gurus, The view arises, clear as the sky. Preserving this view continuously With awareness undistracted, In a continuity unbroken like a flowing stream, Is what is called \"nonmeditation samadhi, continuous like a stream.\" If one has not recognized this, One might simply let everything go And lapse into an amorphous, ordinary state That cannot be said to be this or that-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"To be irrunersed in an indistinct vagueness. 1bis would be a mistake. Although these two states are similar, Insofar as neither is intentional meditation, Nonmeditation samadhi that is like a continuous stream Is just remaining in a vivid clarity That is like a bright, cloudless sky-Limitless, pervasive, transparent. The other is merely a dull state of mind That is nothing in particular: A constricted, fragmentary, biased state Lacking lucid clarity, A vague and hazy stupefaction. Apart from confusing these two states, There is no other error to be made. Kunzang Shenpen went on, \"That being the case, when one is remaining in the nonmeditation samadhi that is like a continuous stream, what should it be like?\" I replied: One must remain in a vivid, lucid openness, Like looking out Into the reaches of the boundless sky From the peak of a mountain open to every direction The lord of sUidlzas,]etsun Tilopa [221 b], Directing his gaze toward the sky, Said to the great pandita Naropa: What supports the sky? On what does sky rest? The Mahamudra of one's mind has nothing to rest on. If you loosen the bonds, liberation is certain. Remain at ease in primordial simplic-ity. The nature of mind is the sky beyond the contents of thoughts. Remain thus at ease, The Ravines ofTsari 257 Not holding on to some thoughts, Or pushing other thoughts away: In true Mahamudra mind is undi-rected. The unsurpassable fruition Is simply to preserve this state. Thus, through Marpa Lotsawa, There will come many sky-like yogins, Sons of the lineage of the great . panditos N aro and Maitri. The great awareness-holder, Shri Singha,35 Pointing his finger toward the heart of a cloudless sky, Told the Lotus-born Guru: Ever empty, ever empty; ever void, all void; This crucial absolute truth is a treasure Which shines everywhere-above, below, between, in all directions-Shri Singha made it spring from the perfect vessel: Action inseparable from view. And with this he dissolved into vajra space. In the same way the omniscient Longchen Rabjam said: In the infmite sky, there is neither meditation or non-meditation. This is the vast expanse that is Samantabhadra's wisdom. It is also said in the Miscellaneous Sayings if the Kadampas: The place for practice must be open and spacious; One's view must be vast and open, too; Even if the whole of samsara and nirvana were placed within it, It would remain as unfilled as ever-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"258 The Life oJShabkar Such should be the immensity of the view [222a]. He said, \"To practice by merely remaining in a vague, oblivious, ordinary state--that's com-pletely useless for progressing along the paths and stages, isn't it?\" I replied: The Victorious One, the incarnation of the Holder of the White Lotus,36 said: These days, some say that when mind is just at rest, That is the Mahamudra view; But that is not the true Mahamudra. And Manjushri incarnate, Sakya Pandita, said:37 Mahamudra as practiced by fools Usually leads to an animal state. This is why all the teachers ofMadhya-rrllka,Mahamudra,andDzogchen Repeatedly warn that just remaining without awareness in a vague, oblivious state, Won't result in progress along the paths and stages. This is not merely true, but is a most profound, crucial point! If one merges with the evenness of sky-like samadhi, At a certain point a real knowledge will burst forth from meditation. Boundless clairvoyance, miraculous powers, and miraculous vision will manifest, And ultimately one will realize the dharmakaya. Not understanding this, one might go astray And remain merely in a dull, amorphous state--Then meditation withers and one dozes off. When absence of mind prevails, there occur Dullness, obliviousness, and, fmally, sleep; Mter much meditation like this, One will take rebirth in the animal realm. All of this, which is said out of affection, Must be understood. To practice meditation, confusing these two states-Like drinking milk mixed with water-Is the way of fools; To practice meditation clearly distinguishing the two Is the way of the wise. Kunzang asked again, ''What should one do when, while remaining in evenness, one does sink into that oblivious, ordinary state?\" I replied: When clouds form, they obscure the stainless sky [222b]. If they are blown away by the wind And scattered in the ten directions, The natural blue color of the sky reappears. In the same way, when a state of vague oblivion Obscures one's meditation, One should straighten one's back, Raise one's gaze, Widen one's perspective, heighten awareness. Let it extend into infmity, Then let it be. Thus one separates the pure essence from the dross; This mental haze will clear away like clouds that just vanish, Leaving the royal samadhi, Vividly transparent, like the immaculate sky. This is the supreme method For dispelling difficulties and enhancing practice."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Rigdzin Shri Singha said: The mind of sentient beings remains fragmented, While the mind of the Buddhas is all-encompassmg; To let the mind become vast and open like the sky Is the key instruction for enhancing practice. From time to time, examine the mind with analytic insight; Ascertain that mind is not something graspable-That it has neither center nor boundary-And let this discovery expand. Sometimes, merge mind With a clear, cloudless sky; Make it vast and lofty; Leave it wide open As an immense, all-encompassing expanse. Doing this, you will avoid the flaws Of slackness, obliviousness, and somnolence; Your experience of the view will be enhanced. Then, when mind contracts again, Like an old scroll rolling itself up, Examine mind thoroughly, time and agam: This is a profound instruction. Wondrous-remaining in lucid serenity [223a], The state of sky-like evenness! Joyous-when day or night, indoors and outdoors, Eyes open or closed, makes no difference to your awareness. Wondrous-when the world of form appears The Ravines ofTsari 259 Like a rainbow in the unchanging sky of dharmakaya! Joyous-to dredge the depths of samsara, Bringing all beings to enlightenment! All you whose wisdom is vast as the sky, Brilliant as the unobscured sun, Limpid as crystal, firm as an unshakable mountain-To you I pay homage, go for refuge; Grant me the waves of your grace. Mter I had said this, his understanding of the view progressed greatly and his realization became as vast as space. The great king of Dharma, Lhagyari Tashi Tsering Pelbar, a true descendent of the lumi-nous celestial beings, asked me to perform a ceremony for his long life, and sent whatever was needed for that purpose. I sent him this letter: You observed the exhaustion of vain wealth, And took hold of the inexhaustible treasury of the seven noble riches. Having extracted from it the wish-fulfilling gem of skill With the four ways of gathering retinue and disciples, You fulfilled the aspirations of all. With the iron claw of scriptural and intellectual authority You shed the heart-blood of vile naga-like, evil-minded antagonists.

As for myself, the hennit Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Though I obtained all the potential of a human being, Met a perfect teacher, received his vast and profound instructions, And remained in solitudes [223b], Because I did not have the fortitude to persevere in meditation, The swift path of the Secret Mantrayana became for me As long as the road of the sutras, and I could not even help myself, much less benefit others. Before the jewel throne supported by fearless lions, On which rest your lotus feet, 0 matchless Dharma King, From the core of my heart, Not merely paying lip service, I respectfully offer this letter, Presenting it with both hands held high above my head. As I received your perfect letter with its seal intact, Conveying the news of your good health, together with your presents, A delight never known before arose in my mind. By the grace of the Three Jewels The illusory body of your servant is also well: Not lacking the basic necessities, my body and mind are at ease. I have devoted myself as much as possible to virtuous practice, Adorning it at the outset with Bodhicitta And at the end with the dedication of merit and prayers of aspiration. 0 wondrous Dharma King, I have taken the flowers of your words As a wreath upon my head; I have taken the nectar of their meaning As a treasure to my heart. I shall accomplish your command, And present you with the sacred long-life substances. 0 lord, it is fitting that your efforts To benefit the Dharma and sentient beings Should increase a hundredfold. Do not impose excessive taxes, nor require excessive labor; Show all possible kindness to the poor within your domain, As though they were your children. 0 lord, we pray that, like a wish-fulfilling tree Protected by the wall of our good fortune, Your manifested form, which fulfills the aspirations of gods and men, May ever remain [224a]. This letter, resting upon a pure white scarf, I offer to you From Caritra, the meeting ground of dakas and dakinis, The realm of the Great Glorious Heruka, The forest where realization dawns all at once. My letter greatly pleased him. As I was about to leave the area, I stayed for seven days in the meditation cave of the Guru ofOrgyen, near Lomi Kyimdun, the Seven Households of Lo, making a spiritual connection with that holy place. As Ama Khandroma38 called me to her home; I went and gave her a long-life empower-ment and some teaching. Faith arose in her; she gave me a good pack-dzomo and all the tea and butter we needed. Palgye, a chieftain from Kongpo, also gave some tea and butter. With these I sent from the Phagmo lbakhang, \"The Varahi Temple,\" a day's supply of tea and soup to the great hermits of the Chikchar retreat cen-ter. A ganachakra feast was offered and religious dances performed, to everyone's delight."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"In farewell, for the benefit of Ama Khan-drama Mingyur Paldron, \"Torch of Unchang-ing Glory,\" the chief Palgye, and all the faithful patrons ofChikchar and Norbu Khacho, I sang this song: May the divine assembly of the deities of· the Three Roots Bless the body, speech, and mind of all those assembled here. You, faithful patrons of the blissful abode ofT sari, Do not feed yourselves by hunting birds and wild animals [224b]. Do not lie and cheat when trading. Do not kill calves to get more milk from dris and rk.omos. Do not accumulate wealth by theft, robbery, or banditry. If, in this life, your acts are evil, Great will be your suffering in the next life. While your body is still healthy, offer prostrations and circumambulations. While your tongue can still move, recite prayers and mantras. While your mind is still clear, listen to the Dharma. While you are still young, hasten to practice meditation. While wealth and possessions are in your hands, make offerings; be charitable. While you are powerful, protect the helpless. If you practice the Dharma while you are young and have white teeth, Your mind will be at peace when you are old and have white hair. All you patrons, men and women, have been very kind To all of us yo gins, master and disciples; I pray that, in the present, you may enjoy long and healthy lives, And that, ultimately, you may attain Buddhahood. The Ravines ofTsari 261 May this heartfelt advice sung by a departing vagabond Benefit the mind of whoever hears it. This song did them some good, and later they did their best to shun wrongdoing and perform only virtuous acts. On the day of our departure, all the great hermits accompanied us for a while on our way. As a farewell prayer I sang this: Remain, pride of white snow lions, Living at ease on the splendid snow mountains, F1ourishing your extraordinary turquoise manes, While with perfect wings the royal eagle, Whose eyes see everywhere, Soars through the azure sky To distant lands. Remain, vajra friends, Dharma compamons. May your extraordinary meditation experiences and realization F1ourish on splendid Tsari Mountain, While I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Who travels from place to place with no particular destination, Regarding everything with pure percep-tion, Set out for distant solitudes [225a]. We, vajra brothers with unsullied vows, Met for a brief instant in this life. May we meet again in a pure Buddhafield; May we never again be parted! At the end of this song, all the elder yogins stayed behind, filled with fervent devotion and respect, while the younger cotton-dad yogins escorted us on a little farther. When the time came to part, so great was our mutual affection that most of them did prostrations with tears streaming down their faces. I prayed that we would meet again and again. Then, although our parting was almost unbearably sad, every-one went on his own way."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"262 The Life of Shabkar After we, master and disciples, reached Dotsen, I went on to the Adamantine Rampart39 with only my spiritual son Kalden. Having offered purifYing smoke of fragrant plants, a ganachakra feast, tormas, and prayers, I told Kalden, \"I feel that many dakas and dakinis have come. If you know any folk songs, sing some to please them.\" He sang many different songs with beautiful tunes, and accompanied these with dances. We laughed a lot and had the impression that the dakas and dakinis were laughing too [225b]. Past Chozam, we climbed to just below Gongmo La, the Snow Grouse Pass, and spent the night there. Before dawn I had a dream: Crossing the pass near Dagpo Ganden Rabden, Kalden, Tsultrim, and I were leading a horse carrying food and clothes. On the pass, we saw a very old woman lying there, apparently unable to move. Filled with pity, I asked her if she could get up. She could not, but raised her head and begged us to give her anything we could. I gave her tea, butter, and tsampa. She also asked for some clothes, and I gave her some. Then she said, \"You are able to walk; I am unable to do so. It would be most kind and compassionate if you were to give me your horse.\" Filled with compassion, I gave her the horse as well. At that moment she got up joyfully and said, ''You are said to be the most compassionate one of all, so I thought to see for mysel£ I have no need of a horse or anything of that sort. Don't you know who I am?\" \"No,\" I said, and she continued: \"If you don't recognize me, I am Vajravarahi. I shall bestow a siddhi upon you-If you have doubts, look at this!\" Instantly she transformed herself into Vajravarahi, red, with two heads: her main head, with a wrathful expression, was surmounted by the smaller head of a black sow. She was naked, adorned only with bone ornaments and garlands of dried and fresh skulls [226a]. In her right hand she held a hooked knife, and in her left a skull cup filled with blood. In the crook ofher left arm she held a khatvanga.40 Majestically, she danced. From her heart emanated rays of light that pen-etrated me and brought me into an increasingly clear and vivid expanse ofbliss and voidness. \"Here is the siddhi,\" she said, handing me a sack resembling a medicine bag, made of multi-colored cloth. It contained what seemed to be thousands of silver coins of various sizes. \"Take this!\" she said, \"and give these to many fortunate beings with suitable karma; they will all be able to fly.\" Then she flew into the sky. Tucking the miraculous bag into the left side of my garment, I, too, could fly. Kalden and Tsultrim were also flying and we rose higher and higher. Seeing us, the people on the ground prostrated themselves. Vajravarahi then said, \"It is not yet time for you to come. You must give the siddhi to all these beings. Later, when you are dying, pray to me and I shall come to receive you with a myriad dakas and dakinis.\" Having ut-tered these words, she rose higher and higher, then disappeareru · Filled with joy, the three of us continued to fly and, watched by all the local people in the valley, alighted on the summit of a mountain. Overwhelmed with faith, the people climbed to meet us and offered abundant food and many presents. I thought, ''Vajravarahi has given us a siddhi so that whenever we are without food or resources, we just need to fly\" [226b]. Not accepting the offerings, we returned them, and people's faith grew even stronger. Then the three of us came down. In a pleasant place we opened the miraculous bag and found in it round pieces of silver that looked like coins--over a hundred large ones, a thousand medium-sized ones, and ten thousand small ones. If one held a large coin, one could fly any-where one wished. If one held a medium-sized coin, one could fly up into space until disappear-ing from sight. If one held a small coin, one could fly at the height of a four-or five-storey house. I thought joyfully that, later, I would give these to many people so that they too could fly. In this mood, we continued on our way. Later, reflecting on the meaning of this dream, I thought it predicted that, by giving to"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"my spiritual sons the profound instructions; which are like the warm breath of the mother dakinis, they would attain either the state of celestial and human beings, liberation, or ultimate omni-science, in numbers corresponding to those of the different silver pieces. The next day we reached the monastery of Ganden Rabden and stayed for the night. We offered tea to the whole community, and did prostrations and circumambulations. The fol-lowing day we crossed the Tsangpo River in a hide coracle and spent the night at Lungkar Monastery, where we received a warm welcome [227a]. The next day we arrived at the holy place ofDagla Gampo. We visited the chapels of the monastery and made offerings. The day after, we went to the retreat center on the hillside. I was offered use of the hermitage where Shar Dagpo Tashi Namgyal41 and many other great sages of the past had lived, and I stayed there in retreat for four months. During this time a drought occurred. The local people asked me to bring rain. I said I did not know how to make rain, but that I would pray to the guru and the Three Jewels. Then I went to a lovely nearby meadow facing south. In the middle, at the foot of a juniper tree, flowed a spring. I performed the consecration of the ground, the invitation to the Buddhas, the cleansing ritual, the offering of the Hwulred T annns, and the tmma offering to the nagas. Then I made this prayer. \"By the blessings of all the Buddhas of the ten directions, the merits gathered by all our mother-sentient beings, and by the good fortune I may have gathered through performing virtu-ous deeds and meditating with pure motivation, when rain is needed, may the sky fill with clouds and as much rain as desired fall. ''When warmth is needed, may a warm, gentle sun shine and ripen the crops [227b]. When hail threatens, may the air tum into a great fire and melt the hail into a welcome down-pour of rain. When hoarfrost threatens, may it be prevented by a gathering of warming clouds. May all the birds, rabbits, and insects that destroy the crops and damage the trees be diverted. · \"May every year be an excellent one, and may harvests be so abundant that jars are filled The Ravines ofTsari 263 to the brim with grain and overflow into inex-haustible heaps, ensuring prosperity and happi-ness for everyone, day and night, as in the golden age.\" Mter making this prayer, I returned to my hermitage and visualized frrst a vast empty sky, then this sky becoming filled with huge clouds. Within a few moments, it began to rain heavily. Since the year thus turned into a good one, people's faith grew, and they kept on bringing me offerings and provisions. During my retreat, praying to the spiritual forefathers of the Kagyu lineage, I practiced the skillful path of tum:mo, the inner heat, and the dear-light Mahamudra. An ineffable realization ofbliss-emptiness dawned in my being [228a]. My close spiritual sons Kalden, Tendzin Nyima, and Kunzang Shenpen chiefly practiced merging with the realization of the vast, all-pervasive expanse of pristine simplicity that crushes delusion into dust:42 the primordial true nature of one's own mind-nondual, empty, luminous-which is the root of both samsara and nirvana. In between meditation periods they cultivated compassion for all beings under the sky. Doing so, they greatly enhanced their inner experience and realization. We then received many transmissions from Tendzin Chowang Rinpoche, \"Dharma Lord Holder of the Doctrine,\" a teacher at the retreat center. Among these were instructions written by Dagpo Tashi Namgyal on the Six Y ogas of Naropa, Mahamudra, Guru Yoga,43 yogic exer-cises, instructions on isolating the central chan-nel, and on drinking the vajra water.44 From Lama Tsondru Chobar, \"Blazing Spiritual Endeavor,\" we received the transmis-sion of the writings of Dagpo Lharje-Lord Gampopa-and of other texts.45 From the head lama of the retreat center, I received a few texts from the Single Golden Syllable qf the Black Qyintes-sence, 46 the rediscovered treasures of Dungtso Repa, which I had not received earlier. At my request, the hermit Damcho, \"Sub-lime Dharma,\" and other great practitioners who had mastered the practices of the channels, ener-gies, and yogic exercises showed us the holding of the breath and other exercises, which we"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"264 The Life ofShabkar enjoyed watching. I was fortunate to learn some new exerciSes. One day, Kalden Rangdrol asked me to compose some verses in praise of this supreme place. Granting his request, I said this: Here is the true palace of the Buddhas of the three times And of the infinity of peaceful and wrathful deities; Here is the gathering field of the dakas and dakinis of the three places [228b]47 And of the glorious protectors of the Dharma. Here the teaching of the practice lineage has flourished; Here many learned and accomplished sages have lived. Dagla Gampo, the great eastern holy place,48 The most illustrious, glorious mountain, One with the Diamond Throne oflndia, You are the chief ornament of the Land of Snows, Tibet; You offer to men and gods a basis for accumulating merits. Behind, the summits of the rocky peaks reach the sky. Wherever one looks there is delightful beauty. To the south are vast and verdant forests In which lovely birds fly and wild animals roam. The scene is a brilliant mingling of exquisitely colored flowers And a great variety of potent medicinal plants. Natural food, fruits, nettles, and other edible plants abound. Down all the hillsides cool streams cascade. There are many pleasant caves and huts to dwell in. Enchanting place! Looking out, one sees the vast open sky; In front, the Tsangpo River49 winds, as if it were a water-offering; The trees, with all their many forms and foliage, form a mandala. The local guardians are well-disposed toward the Dharma. Rain falls in due season, crops and cattle prosper; In the winter the sun always shines, giving warmth, While in summer the weather remains cool and pleasant. One's mind is always happy; awareness is cnsp. One finds everywhere people who are practicing the Dharma And shrines sheltering sacred objects imbued with blessings. Faithful patrons living on either side of the valley Supply water, firewood, and other necessities. No one here creates obstacles to Dharma practice; Meditation experiences and realization grow by themselves [229a]. If one lives in such a place, this life will be a happy one; If one can also practice meditation, the next life will be blissful. Therefore, those who aspire to happiness in this life and the next Should live and meditate in this very place. Doing so, benefiting themselves and ·others, May they all become holders of the teachings of the practice lineage. Everyone was gladdened by these words. On the eve of our departure, I offered tea to all the monks and a ganachakra feast at the retreat center, concluding with many prayers of dedica-tion. Lama Tendzin Chowang Rinpoche told me, \"Last night I dreamed that, sailing on a vast ocean, you reached the far shore. Wherever you go, you will receive much wealth. Without any clinging, use this wealth to make offerings and be charitable, and it won't deflle you.\""},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"On the morning of our departure, the Dharma brothers with whom I had pure con-nections, together with many disciples and patrons, accompanied us for a short while.

I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, who have given up all concerns for this life, Sing these words to urge you to practice the Dharma. You, my spiritual brothers whose samaya is pure And my son-like disciples, listen well! In this decadent age, Life is short and subject to many hazards. No one can say when this vulnerable body will be destroyed. Whether we consider it or not, death is near [229b]. Even if we had enough provisions for a hundred or a thousand years, Crossing the threshold of death, we leave everything behind. Even if our wardrobe would suffice for a hundred or a thousand years, Crossing the threshold of death, we go on, naked. Even if we owned a hundred or a thousand pieces of gold and silver, Crossing the threshold of death, we go on, empty-handed. Even if we had a hundred or a thousand relatives and friends, Crossing the threshold of death, we go on all alone. So it is!

The minds of all those present became imbued with the spirit of the teachings; with unshakable faith, they implored me to visit this sacred place again and again. When we left, they all remained standing where they were. Full of faith and respect for the lamas, the Dharma brothers and the sublime place we had left behind, we all, master and. disciples, went on, looking back, praying that we might meet them many times again [230a]. We then spent one day at Lama Lochenpa's place, and asked him for a long-life blessing to establish a spiritual connection. Next, we visited Dagpo Shedrup Ling;50 here we offered tea to all, and made offerings and prayers. I made prayers of auspiciousness for the senior and jun-ior treasurers of Dagpo Drumpa and gave a longevity blessing and some teaching to their wives and children. They were very helpful to us and gave us provisions. As offering for the Ion-'"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"266 1M Life of Shabkar gevity blessing, they gave us a skin bag full of butter and some silver coins.

I presented them with a rk;omo, and asked for the initiations for the most profound Embodiment of the Three Jewel? 1 and for the Secret Wis-dom, 52 as well as the oral transmission of the rituals related to the Secret Wzsdom and the mind teaching known as The Eternal Slg.53 In tum, I offered him a longev-ity empowerment and the oral transmission of the life and Songs of] etsun Milarepa. Then I remained in retreat at the place known as Zabmo Ri, Profound Mountain. There I gave some teaching on the nature of mind to the Dharma King's mother. She was introduced to the nature of mind, and offered me various gifts. I gave a longevity blessing to the chieftains Khangsar and Kyilkhor, to Tsachanga, Yukhang, and other faithful patrons, men and women, and also gave them teachings on the karmic law of cause and effect. Faith grew in all of them. Pleased, Tsachanga offered me a dotsd'>4 of Chinese silver, and others offered much gold, silver, corals, and turquoises. I accepted these and went to Lhasa [230b]. There I met Theji, the nephew of Abhe--the consort of Chingwang Rinpoche, the Dharma King of Mongolia-as well as the treasurer Darhen, Agyap Delek, and many other devoted patrons who had come from Mongolia. They offered me thirteen dotse of silver. I exchanged them for gold and asked the master goldsmith of Dopel to make with it a lamp weighing about fifteen coins. In the meantime, I stayed for two months in King Songtsen Gampo's meditation cave, Drak Lhalupuk, on the side of Chakpori Hill. I also performed a longevity practice for the benefit of Demo Rinpoche, the regent-king of Tibet. The son of Topden, the faithful, diligent, intelligent, and compassionate governor of Kyilkhor, came to meet me with the intention of crossing the gateway of the Dharma and renouncing the world. I ordained him and gave him the name K.alzang Tsultrim, \"Fortunate Discipline.\" Breaking with all worldly affairs and devoting his whole life to spiritual practice at Serphuk Gangri, the Golden Cave of the Snow Peak, and at Lapchi, he became an authentic practitioner. When the gold lamp was fmished, the patron Namkha Dzopa and I went to glorious Samye. Filling the lamp with clarified butter, I lit it and offered it in front of the Jowo Changchup Chenpo, the Great Enlightened Crowned Buddha55 and, with it, made the \"Great Thou-sandfold Offering.\" I offered food for one day and a silver coin each to all the monks ofSamye. I gave alms to over a hundred beggars. To the most destitute, who were shoeless and half-naked, I gave shoes and clothes. I concluded with many prayers of dedication [231 a]. The great protector Oracle of Samye56 was very pleased, and, manifesting through the trance of the Dharma Lord, called me into his presence and declared, \"Great siddha, it is excellent that you offered a gold lamp to Samye, for there was none before. You should continue to render as much service as you can, and I shall always protect you, accompanying you like your shadow.\" So saying, he gave me a long white silken scar£ The Dharma Lord of Samye, the governor of the fortress, 57 and all the local people were moved with faith. Many of them called me to their homes and presented me with food and other things. I stayed for a few days at the temple on Hepori hill. When I offered a ganachala-a feast, a girl who could see gods and demons said that she saw celestial beings belonging to the eight classes of gods and rakshas coming to the feast from all directions, gathering in the sky like clouds. I went to Samye Chimphu to visit the cen-tral gathering place of the dakinis of Akanishtha. 58 There I lit a hundred lamps, offered a hundred ganachala-as, and gave tea and a silver coin to each of the retreatants. From Chimphu I went to the Red Rock of Y amalung, 59 where I met and made offerings to all the pure monks who do retreat in this sacred secluded place [231 b]. Following this I proceeded to Ganden.

I made gifts to all the beggars and ransomed the lives of seven sheep and goats, which I bought and set free, praying that wherever I went I might have a long life free of illness, and be able to practice Dharma purely. Notes 1. Tsari is identified as both Caritra and Deuilcota, two of the twenty-four great sacred places described in the tantras. For an analysis of the identification of Tsari as these two sacred places, see Huber (1992, vol. 2). For a summary of the guidebook to Tsari by the eighth Drukchen, Chokyi Nangwa, see Filibeck (1988). There are four main gateways to the Pure Crys-tal Mountain ofT sari (dagpa shel ri): the eastern one is that of Manjushri; the southern, of Vajrapani; the western, of Tara; and the northern, of Avalokitesh-vara. According to Kunkhyen Perna Karpo (see Bib-liography), the general sequence of human entry into the Tsari mandala is as follows: Guru Padmasambhava entered through the southern door and remained seven years in the Mag-nificent Secret Cave (zil chen gsang phug; see JK, vol. Da, p. 104). Vimalamitra, too, traveled miraculously to Tsari. Lawapa (la ba pa, or Kambalapada, tenth cen-tury), a teacher of Atisha, entered through the east-ern door with his disciple Bhusuku, and later departed to the Buddhafield ofKhechara (mkho.' spyod) without leaving his physical body behind. The Ravines ofTsari 267 Kyebu Yeshe Dorje (s9es bu, also spelled s9e bo, ye shes rdo rje, twelfth century), an incarnation ofNyang Ben Tingdzin Zangpo (see TN, p. 515), tried thrice to enter Tsari according to the prediction of Gampopa, his teacher (seeJK, vol. Da, p. 104). The third time, Yeshe Dorje was able to enter through the western door and reached the Turquoise Lake {g:JIU mtsho). He also opened the door to the Lake of the Black Mandala (mtsho mo.ndal nag po) in Dagpo; there, together with Gampopa, he concealed as tmna the Teaching on Mind, the Wzsh-:fo!filling Gem (sems khrid yid bzhin nor bu). Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje (gtsang pa rgya ras ye shes rdo rje, I 161-1211, not to be confused with K yebu Yeshe Dorje) went to Tsari, following a prediction given to him in a vision by Gyalwa Lorepa (rgyal ba lo ras pa, 1187-1250). After Tsangpa Gyare had opened the door of the sacred place he had a vision at the Turquoise Lake Palace in which Chakrasamvara told him, ''You will become the Buddha known as The Young Aspirant (chung mos pa), the youngest of the 1 002 Buddhas of this kalpa, and your teachings will spread far and wide from here, to the distance of eighteen days of a vulture's flight.\" Drigung Jigten Gonpo (Jig rten mgon po, 1143-1217) sent to Tsari first three of his main disciples, headed by Nyo Gyalwa llianangpa (gnyos rgyal ba lha nang pa), and then a great number of hermits (see chap. 11, note 10). Finally Sonam Gyaltsen (bsod nams rgyal mtshan), from Ralung, entered through the northern door. 2. In 1811. 3. This was the eighth Drukchen, Kunzig Chokyi Nangwa ('brug chen lcun gzigs chos 9i snang ba, 1768-1822). 4. The Diamond Throne of India; see chap. 1, note 1. 5.

A prophecy from the State Oracle ofNechung said that if the lliagyari line flourished, so would Tibet. See also Karsten (1980). 6. Chozam (chos zam) is a small village. Dotsen (rdo mtshan), or \"sexed stones,\" is so called because of large stones naturally shaped as the linga of Chakra-samvara and the bhaga of Vajravarahi. They were kept in the Dotsen Temple (rdo mtshangtsug lag khang). Childless couples would come to circumambulate the temple and pray to be blessed with a child. 7. There are three levels at which one can circum-"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"268 The Life of Shabkar ambulate the holy mountain of Tsari: upper, inter-mediate, and lower. The last one, known as Tsari Rang Khor, the Circumambulation of the Ravines of Tsari (tsari rong bskor), is exceedingly difficult and was done only once every twelve years, in the Mon-key Year. Because of its blessing and rarity, this event attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims. These were confronted by many difficulties. The southern part of the pilgrimage led through low altitudes and the pilgrims had to travel under the cover of tropical forests so thick that the sky could not be seen for hours on end. The humidity, moreover, was so intense that their woollen and felt clothing, suited to the dry, cold climate of the highlands, would rot. Sometimes the pilgrims had to walk along dangerous cliffs and cross turbulent rivers on vertiginous ladders or on bridges made from the slippery trunks of trees. Another danger carne from the savage Lhopa tribes scattered throughout the forest, who would attack unaccompanied travelers with poisoned arrows and often kill them. In an attempt to prevent such incidents, every twelve years the Tibetan govern-ment would send up to a hundred loads of gifts and offer incentives to the Lhopas to pacify them while the pilgrimage was taking place. After an agreement had been reached, a swearing ceremony was held. (See House qf the Turquoise Roof, pp. 90-91, summa-rized below.) A gate made of bamboo was erected and the meat of two freshly killed yaks was tied to the post on each side. The Lhopas' representatives would show their good faith by passing under the gate. In passing, each Lhopa would cut a small piece of raw meat from one the carcasses and eat it. But even then they could not be trusted completely, and the govern-ment had to send soldiers to protect the pilgrims and guides to lead them on their hazardous journey. 8. The Pure Crystal Mountain (dag pa shel ri}, the central and holiest snow peak of Tsari. Detailed descriptions of this mountain are given in Perna Kar-po and Chokyi Nangwa's guidebooks. See also Martin (1988), Sorensen (1990, 14-22), and Huber (1992, note 11 0). Around the sacred mountain are four ravines: the Human Skin Protector Ravine (mi lpags mgon po rong), the Dazzling Ravine ('od 'bar rong), the Tiger's Den Ravine (stag tshang rong), and the difficult and frightening Bear's Den Ravine (dom tshang rong). In these four ravines flow four rivers related to the four empowerments (dbang b<)zi). 9. Caritra; see note 1 above. IO. Shapes of deities and of sacred letters which appear naturally on the surface of rocks. 11. In 1812. 12. The procession of the pilgrims was divided according to geographical origin into groups called slw and would proceed in long lines headed by a group leader (stong dpon, as communicated by T. Huber). The local people would take the lead, since they knew the place well. Next came the Bhutanese, since they were good at clearing the way, followed by the strong Kharnpas, and finally the pilgrims from central Tibet. Often the path was so narrow that the pilgrims had to walk in single file and if, for some reason, the way was blocked for those in front, they might have to wait for many hours leaning against a rock wall above a precipice. Those who were among the first fifty behind the guide were considered lucky, for the difficulty and danger were much greater for those coming further behind in the line. The main purpose of the pilgrimage was the long circumambulation of the sacred Pure Crystal Mountain. The route followed, which includes in particular the celebrated \"nine passes and nine val-leys\" (la dgu lung dgu), has been described by Bailey (1957) and Huber (1992). Anyone who had success-fully completed this pilgrimage, which could take ten to fifteen days, would find any other pilgrimage rela-tively easy. In the lower altitudes, there were no places or temples of particular interest. In contrast, in the upper levels of Tsari the way led through pleasant and beautiful areas such as Chikchar (cig char), where there were many temples and sacred objects to be visited, and all were accessible throughout the year. These temples and images were nearly all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. 13. Yulmeh ()lul rmatf), a small village at over four thousand meters, is the main practice place of the Drigungpas in Tsari. Chozarn (clws ;:,am) marked the end of the pilgrimage. See Huber (1992, note 54). 14. The Sadhana qf Amitayus and HU:JagriJJa Combined (nye brgyud tshe rta zung 'brel 'chimed dpal gter) is a sadhana that was prophesied in a terma concealed by Guru Padmasarnbhava in the Magnificent Secret Cave ( zil chen gsang phug) at Tsari and revealed by the great siddha Thangtong Gyalpo; see Compendium qf Sadhanas (sgrub tlzabs kun btus, vol. I, p. 439). The sadhana texts presented in the Rinchen Terdzo(vol. Tshi, pp.l 91-204) combine the three traditions of the Canonical Transmission (bka' ma), Spiritual Treasures (gter ma) and Pure Visions (dag snang). On this longevity prac-tice, see]. Gyatso (1981, 142-69). 15. The BlackNaga'sDevil (klubdudnagpo), known"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"in full as the \"Supreme Herb, Black Diamond Naga's Devil\" (rtswa mchog klu bdud rdo rje nogpo), is the bonnet bell-flower ( Codonopsis). According to information re-ceived in conversation with Dr. Sherapjorden, this is a creeping plant with grey-blue flowers and an un-pleasant smell. The preparation made from its roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits is said to cure all diseases, especially leprosy and epilepsy; to enable one to fly in the sky and walk on water; and to bring forth all ordinary and extraordinary siddhis. It is used in the preparation of a sacramental substance (dam rdzas) called the \"rainbow light pill\" (Ja 'od Til bu), the mere taste of which liberates one from rebirth in the three lower realms of samsara. The common klu bdud (Codonopsis nervosa) is used, associated with eighteen other medicines, as an anti-inflammatory, an analge-sic, a tonic, and as a treatment for gout, abscesses, and leprosy. See also T.J. Tsarong (1986). On the likely identification of the klu bdud rdo rje as Codonopsis convolvulaceae or Codonopsis ovata, and for the detailed description of this plant and its varieties, see Fletcher (1975), Martin (1988, 351-54) and espe-cially Sorensen ( 1990). According to Terton Rinchen Lingpa (gter ston Tin chenglingpa, 1295-1375) this plant is called Diamond Naga's Devil because it is precious like a diamond and because it overcomes the nagas that cause leprosy and other skin diseases (see gso ba rig pa'i tshig mdzod g:JU thog dgongs rgyan, p. 18). Accord-ing to Trogawa Rinpoche, the Diamond Naga's Devil (klu bdud rdo rje) should not be confused with the ordinary Naga's Devil (klu bdud): only some persons with spiritual capacities can see and fmd the former at dusk, when the plant is said to emit a faint glow. 16. Chikchar (cig char) is a secluded spot in Old Tsari (tsa ri mying rna) on the northern side of the Pure Crystal Mountain. For a history ofChikchar, see also Filibek (1988, 4). 17. The famous Varahi Temple(phagmo'ilhakhang) was founded by Padma Karpo between the years 1567 and 15 74. See Perna Karpo's biography (vol. 3, Ga, pt. Nya of his Collected Works, fols. 128-29) and Situ's Account of a Pilgrimage to Central Tibet, p. 526. 18. Called \"two-headed\" because the head of a sow emerges from Vajravarahi's own head. 19. Kunkhyen Perna Karpo (kun mkhyen padma dkar po, 1527-92), the \"Omniscient White Lotus,\" was an emanation ofPadmapani, the \"Lotus-holder,\" a name of Avalokiteshvara. As the fourth Drukchen ('brug chen), the head of the northern branch of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage (byang 'brug), he founded the monas-tery of Char Sang-ngak Choling (byar gsang sngags chos gling). He had two immediate reincarnations. The The Ravines ofTsari 269 first, Gyalwa Pagsam Wangpo (rgyal ba dpag bsam dbang po, 1593-1641 ), occupied the throne of Sang-ngak Choling. His incarnations were known as Drukchen Rinpoche. The second, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (zhabs drung ngag dbang mam rgyal, 1594-1651) went in exile to Bhutan, where he con-tributed greatly to the spreading of Buddhism and unified the country as a Buddhist state. 20. The Great Turquoise Lake Palace (pho brang chen po gyu mtsho), two days walk from Chikchar, is south of the Pure Crystal Mountain. It is a magnifi-cent lake \"like a mirror of sapphire and the mandala of Chakrasamvara.\" 21. mkha' spyod; see chap. 6, note 6. 22. The two thousand and eight hundred deities who dwell on the central mountain of Tsari, which resembles a large crystal \"Stupa with Many Doors of Auspiciousness\" (bkra shis sgo mang mchod rten). An explanation on how to calculate that number is given in Perna Karpo's description ofTsari. 23. Ngaktra Tullm, which should be written sngags grwa sprul sku, means \"the Tulku of the Tantric Col-lege,\" and refers to one of the six monastic communi-ties of Sang-ngak Choling. (Communicated by Sengtrak Rinpoche. See also G. Smith, 1968). 24. The Hundred and Eight Combined Yogic Exercises are the yogic exercises related to the Six Y ogas of Naropa. Se-pho (bsre 'pho), \"Combination and Trans-fer,\" is the basic name of the cycle of teaching of the Six Yogas ofNaropa. The instructions on these teach-ings are found in two main sets of explanations: I) rgyud dang 'brel ba thabs lam gyi dbang du byas te bshad pa, a large and detailed explanation based directly on the texts of the tantras. Its lineage and practice have become extremely rare. 2) byin rlabs dang 'brei ba snyan rgyud lgi dbang du byas nas bshad pa. A concise summary of these instructions, according to the oral tradition, has been preserved and is still practiced today. \"Combination\" (bsre) refers to combining a spiritual practice with any of the many ordinary activities of daily life. \"Transfer\" ('pho) refers to the various kinds of practice of the transfer of consciousness at death. 25. Tummo (gtum mo); see chap. I, note 65. 26. The tsulpas (tshul pa) were local people from Tsari villages outside the Ravines who used to help the pilgrims going to Tsari. They would set up rest houses (tshul k.harttJ along the pilgrimage route and provide the pilgrims with water and fuel, but rarely provisions."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"270 The Life of Shabkar 27. The Beneficial Moon (chos bshadgdwn phan zlo. ba); the Beneficent Jewel (chos bshad gdwn phan nor bu); and the Offering Cloud qfSamantabhadra (chos bshad 1om bzang mchod sprin). (See Appendix 5). 28. Verses of auspiciousness which say: May the auspiciousness of the body, immovable as Mount Meru, prevail, May the auspiciousness of the Sixty Branches of Speech prevail, May the auspiciousness of the mind, the ulti-mate meaning free from extremes, prevail, May the auspiciousness of the body, speech, and mind of the Victorious Ones prevail. 29. Bhmni; see Author's Introduction, note 15. The level of Complete Joy is the first bhumi of the Boclhisattvas. 30. Pratimoksha: The vows of individual liberation (so sor thar pa'i sdom pa) are seven sets of precepts intended for lay disciples, novices, and fully ordained monks and nuns. They form the foundation of the Three Vehicles. See Appendix 1. 31. The Sanskrit rishi has been translated in Ti-betan as drang srong, \"Straight Ones,\" and refers to Indian hermits, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, who were renowned for the rectitude of their con-duct and spiritual practice. Rishis were dressed in white, hence the analogy with the white vulture. In the Tibetan culture, the vulture is considered to be the king of birds. We have substituted \"eagle\" for \"vulture\" in most instances in this translation, since the latter often has a negative connotation for West-em readers. 32. The snow grouse or Tibetan partridge (gong mo, Lat. Perdrix Hodgsoniae). 33. Gandharvas (dri za), a class of spirit-gods who have exceedingly melodious voices and who feed on odors alone. 34. The continent of Ominous Sound (sgra mi ST9'an), Uttarakuru, so called because when any of its inhab-itants reaches the end of his or her very long life, a tree falls down, and in the sound it makes when falling one can hear the words, \"You are going to die!\" 35. Shri Singha, the great vidyadhara who con-ferred upon Guru Rinpoche the empowerment of the \"Manifestation of Awareness\" (rigpa'i rtsal dba.rqj). See chap. 4, note 16. 36. The fifth Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Lobzang Gyatso (rgyal ba blo bzang rgya mtsho, 1617-82), who wrote this verse in his advice called the Pearl Garland (mu thi lo.'i phreng ba). 37. Sakya Pandita, Kunga Gyaltsen (sa slga pan di ta kun dga' rgyal mtshan, 1182-1251 ), wrote this verse in his Distinctive Features qf the Three Vows (sdom gsum rab 'byed). 38. Ama Khandroma (a ma mkha' 'gro ma) was said to be a human descendant of the da.kini guardian of Tsari. See Wylie (1962, 94). 39. Adamantine Rampart (rdo rje ra ba), or Vajra Horn or Prong (rdo rye rwa ba). The two words ra ba (rampart, fence, enclosure) and rwa ba (horn, prong, tip) are often confused. At the beginning of chapter 13, for instance, the text reads La phyi gang gi rwa ba, where it should read la phyi gangs gi ra ba (the Lapchi Snow Range, or \"enclosure of snow mountains.\" According to a personal communication by T. Huber, the term rdo rje ra ba or rwa ba can be understood in different ways in the context ofTsari sacred geogra-phy. 1) 2) 3) The Crystal Mountain is considered to be the palace of Chakrasamvara, with all the surrounding hills, valleys, lakes and trees arranged in the shape of a mandala. Every mandala is circumscribed by a rampart or fence (ra ba) of standing vajras tightly fit together, which prevents negative forces from entering. Here, the Adamantine or Vajra Rampart is believed to encircle the Crystal Mountain and forms a sacred threshold over which one must pass to enter the mandala. Near the Crystal Mountain, most pilgrims cross the Adamantine Ram-part and enter the mandala when they climb up from Chikchar (cig chaij on the \"central\" or \"middle\" circumambulation track (gzhung bskory, or at a certain point on the upper circumambulation (rtse bskor) around the peak. The guide to Tsari describes the relation-ship of the three holy places of Chakra-samvara and Vajravarahi in this area as being like a vajra laid down from east to west, with the Pure Crystal Mountain (dog pa shel ri) as the western prong (rdo rje rwa ba nub), the White Lake (mtsho dkar) as the central knob, and New Tsari (tsa ri gsar ma) as the eastern prong of the vajra (rdo rje rwa ba shar). Another possibility, which fits well with the text of this biography (considering the route which Shabkar took, from Dotsen to rdo rje rwa ba, then to Chozam, see map 3), is that Vajra Hom is an alternative name for a site referred to as Vajra Rock (rdo rje brag) by inhabitants of Tsari or by pilgrims. The Vajra Rock is a site above Dotsen. The"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"biography of Doring Pandita, who made a pilgrimage to Tsari in 1794 (see rdo ring pandita'i rnam thar, Szechuan edition, p. 1043), refers to VajraHorn (rdo rjerwa ba) as a site which corresponds to the Vajra Rock (rdo rje brag). 40. Klw.tvanga, a staff surmounted by a double vajra, by a long-life vase, by three heads-a fresh head, a decomposing head, and a dry skull-and by a vajra (here the vajra replaces the trident usually found on Guru Rinpoche's Khatvanga). This Khatvanga rep-resents Vajravarahi's male consort in hidden form. On the symbolism of the Khatvanga, see Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1989, 23). 41. Dagpo Tashi Namgyal (dwags po bkra shis mam rg;yal, 1513-87), a descendant as well as an incarna-tion ofGampopa and a holder of the throne ofDagla Gampo (dwags Ia sgam po). (See GC, vol. 4, pp. 113-15 and JK, vol. Da, p. 333). He studied with many masters, including Karma T rinlepa (karma phrin las pa) and Khenchen Sakya Zangpo (mldum chen sha lga bzang po). He is the author of several commentaries on various aspects of contemplative life, including the famed Three Cycles of Light-rays ('od zer skor gsum), one of which, the zla ba'i 'od zer, has been translated into English by L. P. Lhalungpa under the title Mahamudra, th£ Q]..tintessence of Mind and Meditation ( 1986). As communicated by Tashi Tshering, a short biography ofTashi Namgyal is found in folio 83 of the biographies of Gampopa's successors (gangs can 'dir ston pa'i rgyal tshab dpal sgam po pa'i khrigdung 'dzing pa'i dam pa mams lgi gtam be durya'i phreng ba). It was written by one Zangpo (bzang po) at Dagla Gampo in 1662 and is presently kept at the library of Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. 42. \"Pristine simplicity which crushes delusion into dust.\" zang that is a synonym of ma 'gags pa, \"unob-structed,\" but according to TaklungTsetrul Rinpoche (Perna Wangyal) it can also be explained as zang kha ma that du 'byung. zang kha ma, \"natural condition,\" refers to ma bcos pa'i gdod ma'i gnas lugs, the unmodified simplicity of the primordial nature; and that du 'byung, \"reduce to dust,\" refers to the annihilation of deluded thoughts, 'khrul pa'i mam rtog. 4 3. The four basic practices of the Kagyu lineage are: I) The view-of Mahamudra (pl!Jag rgya chen po) 2) The meditation-the Six Yogas ofNaropa (naro chos druiJ 3) The action-the Six Cycles of Even Taste (ro snyoms skor drug) · 4) The profound path-Guru Yoga (lam zab bla ma'i mal 'byor). The Ravines ofTsari 271 The guru yoga mentioned here is likely to be the secret Guru Yoga associated with the yogic exercises. 44. Isolating the central channel (dbu ma 'dzugs skor): a yogic exercise in which the central part of the abdomen and the subtle central channel are isolated by making them protrude from the rest of the abdo-men. The Vajra Water (rdo rje chu) refers to a highly esoteric yogic practice-the first of two practices known as mdun thur and rg;yab thur. (See Y angti Nagpo, vol. 2, 273-74). 45. The collected writings of Gampopa, Sonam Rinchen (sgam po pa bsod nams rin chen, 1079-1153), comprise two volumes of spiritual instructions, and the famed Jewel Ornament of liberation (dam chosyid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan). Gampopa was born in Nyal in eastern Tibet. He first trained as a physician, hence his name Dagpo Lharje (dwags po lha rje), the Physician of Dagpo (the province in which he spent many years). He renounced the world and became ordained at the age of twenty-six after his wife and two children died in an epidemic. After having stud-ied and practiced the Kadampa teachings, at the age of thirty-two he met and became the foremost dis-ciple ofjetsun Milarepa. His own chief disciples were the first Karmapa Dusum Khyenpa (dus gsum mkhyen pa, 111 0-93), Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo (phag mo grupardorjergyalpo, 1110-70),andDharma Wangchuk (dho.rma dbang phyug, 1100-?). 46.

The three places (sa gsum) are the realms of celestial beings above the earth, of human beings upon the earth, and of the nagas below the earth. 48. Dagla Gampo (dwags Ia sgam po), the place where Gampopa lived. It is said that such was the devotion of Gampopa's disciples that some of them realized the meaning of Mahamudra simply by see-ing the Dagla Gampo mountain from afar. 49. The Brahmaputra. 50. Dagpo Shedrup Ling (dwags po bshad sgrub gling), a monastic college, seat of the fifth Shamar Konchog Yanlak (dkon mchogyan lag, 1525-83). Also the place where the eighth Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje (mi slgod rdo rje), passed away in 1554. 51. 7he Embodiment of th£ Three Jewels ( bka' rdzogs pa chen po tDwn mchog spyi 'dus), the famed spiritual treasure revealed by Rigdzinjatshon Nyingpo, (~ 'dzin )a' tshon snying po, 1585-1656), which contains, among other instructions, sadho.nas focused upon the peaceful and wrathful aspects of Guru Rinpoche (gu ru zhi ba and dragpo), and upon the Lion-headed Dakini (sengge gdongma). 52.

This could also refer to the cycles of the same name revealed by Minling Terdak Lingpa (1646-1714; see chap.l, note 38) and elaborated by Lelung Shepai Dmje (sle lung b.dzad pa'i rdo rje, b. 1697; see chap. 14, note 51). 53.

The central image in the main temple of Samye, thejowo Changchup Chenpo (jo bo byang chub chen po), is a huge stone statue of Lord Buddha taken by Guru Padmasambhava as a f£rma from Hepori Hill. 56. The Protector (chos s9orzii and the Dharma Lord (chos rje) ofSamye. At Samye, Guru Padmasam-bhava subdued all the king-spirits (rgyal po) and put them under the power of King Pehar (pe har). He did the same with all the Tsens (btsan), whom he put under the power ofTsimara (tsi rna ra). The Protector of Samye, Gyalpo Pehar, sometimes descends into, or inhabits, a predestined person called the Dharma Lord ofSamye. When present in the Dharma Lord, Pehar gives prophecies for the sake of Tibet and the Dharma. When Pehar took the oath not to harm any beings and to guard them and Guru Rinpoche's teachings, he offered his heart to Guru Rinpoche as a symbol of his pledge. Until recently this \"heart\" was kept in a precious box that only the Oracle was allowed to open. He would do so once a year. When Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche (1903-87) gave the em-powerment of the Rinchen Terdzo (rin chen gter mdzod) at Samye, at one point the Oracle went into a trance and showed him this heart, which looked like a fresh heart. 57. The Governor of the Fortress (rdzong dpon) was a notable from Lhasa posted at Samye's fortress behind the main temple. 58. The place where Guru Padmasambhava gave the first empowerment (abhisheka) in Tibet to King Trisong Detsen and to seven other disciples, each of whom was entrusted with the practice upon one of the Eight Herukas of the Eight Canons of Accom-plishment (sgrub pa bka' brgyad). 59. Drakmar Yamalung (brag dmo:r gya' rna lung), the eighth among the sacred places in Tibet and Bhutan blessed by Guru Padmasambhava for the practice of the Eight Herukas.

The golden reliquary that contains the remains ofje Tsongkhapa. · 61. The Pledge-holder Dharma King (dam can chos rgyalj is one of the three main protectors of the Gelukpa tradition. Tsongkhapa received a prophecy that the followers of his lineage must propitiate one of three protectors, and none other, failing which the Gelukpa tradition would decline. These three are: 1) Namsey (rnam sras), for beings of lesser faculties, 2) Damchen Chogyal (dam can chos rgyalj, for beings of medium faculties, and 3) Gonpo Chadrukpa, the Six-armed Mahakala (mgon po phyag drug pa), for beings of highest faculties. These three categories ofbeings correspond to those explained in the Great Graded Patlz (lam rim chen mo), written by Tsongkhapa. 62. Drak Yerpa (bragyer pa) is the holy place of Guru Padmasambhava related to the speech aspect. It is also said to be the \"life tree\" (srog shing), or spiritual axis, of Lhasa.

You must go to a remote place like Kailash Snow Mountain and practice for the rest of your life. let's find out if you can attain the rainbow body.\" I made up my mind: nothing else mattered. At that time, I met the treasurer ofPurang Shephel Ling Monastery and the generous chieftain Depa Wangpo, both of whom had come to Lhasa. They told me about the area around Kailash, and I decided to travel with them. Khenpo Chaksampa entrusted me to the good care of Depa Wangpo. Khenpo Shiwa Tsering and his spouse gave me a tent and other necessities. In the company of Depa Wangpo, we set off. On the way we visited the Tara ofNyethang1 and the great Maitreya ofRong, offering butter-lamps and prayers [233b]. At Tashi Lhunpo2 we paid homage to all the sacred shrines and objects, met the Panchen Lama and his tutor, and requested their protection and teaching to estab-lish spiritual connections. Further on our journey, I gave to some beg-gars the twenty-five silver coins that I had. At Saga the governor, a relative of Khenpo Chaksampa, and his devout wife requested a long-life empowerment. They offered me coins, trampa, tea, and butter, which we took with us. On the way, people would occasionally ask me where I was going. Saying that I was on my 275 way to the Snow Mountain, I would sing verses like these: On the summit of great Mount Meru Lies the wonderful Mansion of Complete Victory.3 Before I did not have the chance: Now I will go and see it. In the vastness of distant oceans, Lies the marvelous wish-granting jewel. Before I did not have the chance: Now I will go and get what I desire.

Withered with age, The illusory body of this yogin Can never be what it once was. My youth is finished. Whatever comes to mind, Everything, is transient; It is not what it once was. I can't rely upon this life. Cut off all attachments! I will sever all ties to this life And go to the Snow Mountain, The very center of the southern continent, Jambudvipa. In the Cave of Miracles, on the glacier, I will raise the victory banner of practice As high as samsara's highest point: This is my prayer. My weariness and renunciation grew even stron-ger, my determination to practice even more fierce [235a]. On the road to Drosho, I met a beggar woman named Drolma, weeping bitterly by the road. While she was out begging, some thieves from the Magar Yalong tribe4 had entered her small tent and taken everything, down to the tent poles. Feeling pity, I gave her ten silver coins and all the tea, butter and trampa I had. I told her to pray to Tara. She stayed by the main road, telling every-one passing by, \"An accomplished lama, a true Buddha, has passed by on his way to the Snow Mountain ofTo.\" The reputation she made for me aroused faith in Drungtse, the chieftain of Drosho, and in most of the wealthy nomads. They came to meet me and, later, their devotion grew even stronger and inspired them to come visit me at the snow mountain, where they helped me. When we arrived at Trugolho, the South-em Gate of the Thaw,5 on the shore ofMana-sarovar, the Ever-cool Turquoise Lake, 6 the monks there thought we were the party of the abbot ofShephel Ling, 7 and came to welcome us"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"in a beautiful procession. That was an auspicious sign! During the waxing moon of the third month, in the male WoodDogyear,8 known as 'Wealth,\" we came to the monastery of Purang Shephel Ling. Mter a few days' stay, we collected our provisions and went to a cave below the White Footprint of the Cave ofMiracles,9 near Kailash, the king of mountains. The frrst thing I did was to sing this song in praise of the place: Described in the sutras and tantras, This mountain is the mansion of infinite Jinas [235b]. The gathering place of mother dakinis and local guardians, The abode of celestial beings and sages: The snow mountain renowned as Kailash 10 ' With its ice-peak shaped like a crystal stupa. This is the mountain the Buddha meant When he spoke of\"The Snow Mountain.\" This crystal-stupa mountain Is the infinite palace of Chakrasamvara. The places where many arhats once stayed Ring the slopes of the mountain. Here, the Buddhas of the three times Are gathered like clouds, With dakinis and dharmapalas Assembled as their servants, And in every cave sits a practitioner, Each like a turquoise set in gold. Self-arisen forms of deities, footprints of the Buddha, And amazing signs of the miracles Performed by Lord Milarepa and Naro Bonchung-11 So many wonders can be seen! The two great lakes, Manasarovar and Rakkas Tal, Lie before that mountain Like two lovely water-offerings. At Mt. Kailash 277 Surrounded by many faithful patrons, One feels complete contentment; Everything needed to practice the Dharma is at hand. The call of the golden duck, the king ofbirds, And those of other birds delight the mind. East of the noble Kailash snow peak, In the solitary Cave ofMiracles, I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Have the good fortune to practice the Dharma. Masters of the whispered lineage who have stayed here: Mature me, free me with your blessings! [236a]. Victorious peaceful and wrathful yidam deities, Grant me the ordinary and extraordinary siddhis! May the dakinis, dharmapalas, and local guardians Help this beggar to attain enlightenment. I then sealed the entrance to my cave with mud and, in a song, made this vow to practice: No sentient being who has not been my mother! No happiness when one stays in samsara! No condition in the lower realms without unbearable suffering! No way to avoid suffering! Thinking of the pain of sentient beings I can't help but feel dismay. Kye rna! Kye hu! What should one do?

I may serve as a guide for a few small valleys,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"278 The Lift oJShabkar Teaching the Dharma, benefiting a few-But how can that empty samsara?

Previously, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Dredging the depths of samsara again and agam, Brought to Buddhahood the six classes Of beings of this billionfold universe. In the future, at the time of the Buddha Aspiration, The beings of this billionfold universe Saved from the depths of samsara Will become Buddhas, the sutras say. Ifl practice now, I will surely reach enlightenment; With enlightenment [236b], I can dredge the very depths of samsara. So, better to meditate than to teach-I will now dedicate myself to practice, With the aspiration that, one day, Emanating infinite forms, I may dredge the very depths of samsara. I stayed in retreat and kept silence. While I was engaged single-mindedly in the excellent practices of the development, comple-tion, and Great Perfection stages, my supreme and worthy heart-sonJimba Norbu and many fortunate disciples gathered in the vicinity like ra_in clouds in summer. Offering a golden mandala heaped with corals and turquoise, they repeatedly asked me for teachings. \"Should I strive to reach perfection myself, or to help others?\" With this question in mind, I prayed to the deities of the Three Roots. One night, towards dawn, the Lion-faced Wisdom Dakini appeared, surrounded by a large retinue of other dakinis. She said: \"K ye! Son of the Victorious Ones, it would be wonderful if, through spending your whole life in practice, you attained the body of rainbow light. But you wouldn't be able to help others very much in this lifetime. Through the vast prayers and aspirations you made previously, the time to care for others has come, and there are many for whom you have already opened the door. You should bring these fortunate beings onto the path of maturation and liberation; this will greatly benefit the Dharma and all beings. We, the dakinis, will accompany you like your shadow\" [23 7 a]. Having said this, she vanished. \"According to the dakini's prophecy, ifl serve the Dharma and all beings, I may not attain the rainbow body, but I will have no regrets.\" With this in mind, along with my practice, I gave teachings from time to time through a small window in the door of my cave. This is how I came to work for both myself and for others. One afternoon, thinking of my spiritual mas-ter and the place where he used to live, and thinking about my parents, relatives, Dharma friends, and my native land, I sang this melan-choly song: Journeys through marvelous countries Brought delightful sights to my eyes, Yet thoughts of my kind guru's home Again and again come back to mind. Excellent teachers I encountered Granted all the teachings I desired, Yet thoughts of the Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo, Arise in my mind, again and again. Close friends practicing the same tradition Happily talked with me about Dharma, Yet thoughts of my heart-friend, Dorje Tseten, Again and again come back to mind.

One day I heard heart-breaking news: the refuge and protector of all Tibetans, the powerful Vic-torious One Lungtok Gyatso Rinpoche, 12 had passed on to another Buddhafield. My infmite sadness arose as this song of lamentation: At Mt. Kailash 279 Aho! The sun has set in Tibet, the N orthem Land.13 The master pillar in the great house of the Buddha's teaching has fallen.

To spur on those who cling to permanence and Who postpone practicing the sacred Dharma, You have departed for the Pure Realms [238b].

Even if I were to search Throughout samsara and nirvana For eighty thousand kalpas, How could I fmd such a wondrous incarnation?

What would have become of me, A slave to this life, Oblivious of the stark presence of death, Had I not had such a teaching on impermanence?

Keep in mind the transience of life! And now, right at this very instant, Throw yourself into your practice of the Dharma! Once, I gave the transmission and instruc-tions for the practice of the Graded Path and other teachings on mind training to my fortunate dis-ciple Lamajimba Norbu and many other spiri-tual sons. Some of them asked me, \"What practices did you do while wandering from place to place?\" My answer was this song: I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Gave up my homeland, took to other countries, Visited many different places, And practiced like this: I went to the east [239a]. And, like a Chinese woman Gently unraveling threads of silk, I loosened and relaxed My own entangled mind. I went to the south, And, like a carpenter from the south lands ofMon Straightening a crooked piece of wood, I unbent and straightened out my mind.

In short, wherever I went, Equating happiness and sadness, I turned pleasure and pain into practice: This is what you must do. My song strengthened their aspirations. In the summer, Lama Neten, who was from Marmig in the northern steppes and whose secret name was Gangshar Rangdrol, \"Self-liberation ofWhatever Arises,\" arrived at this sacred place. He had consciously taken rebirth for the sake of the nomads of the northern steppes who had neither protector nor refuge. He performed of-ferings to the Snow Mountain and asked me for a mind teaching in the tradition of the Great Perfection [239b]. I offered him what I knew about clarifyjng and enhancing practice, and removing obstacles. After all his doubts were cleared away, his realization became vast as the sky. Offering seven sho of gold, he asked for some profound advice. I sang this: Handsome body-Like a rainbow in space. Sweet voice--Like Brahma's song. Vast mind-At Mt. Kailash 281 Like the wide expanse of sky: To the guru's body, speech and mind, I bow down. Look with stainless wisdom-eyes On myriad beings, each one once our mother. Grant your blessing that, Having swiftly realized the absolute body, I may manifest the body of form. I, the yogin Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Will now sing some essential advice: Fortunate ones, you wish to reach Buddhahood In this very life, with this very body: Listen with respect. The root of all that exists, Samsara and nirvana, is one's own mind. Primordially, mind is emptiness. Merge into the sky-like absolute expanse, Empty, luminous, beyond clinging. Outside, inside; eyes open or closed, Day, night; asleep, awake: No difference. During practice, after practice, Mind, appearances: Blend them. Continuously, without wavering, . Merge completely with this vibrant, sky-like state. Even if you died right now, You would have no regrets.

Therefore, fortunate heart-son, Practice the development stage of the yidam deity.

My mother: Heap of Goodness, A native of that region [24la]. My father: I don't know who he was. We were three children, Among whom I was the eldest; I was called Auspicious Lord of Speech. From childhood, I had faith in the Dharma and the lamas; From the age of seven I could read, And from ten I attended spiritual masters. Up to now I've had perhaps a hundred teachers. Among these, my gracious root-lama Was the Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo. I received many profound teachings, On Madhyamika, Dzogchen, Mahamudra, and Chod. At the age of twenty-one, I gave up all the affairs of this life. In Dorney, U, Tsang, and other regions, I stayed in many remote retreats. I meditated without distraction On the profound instructions Of the two Bodhicittas, And on the development and completion stages. By the blessing of my gurus, I recovered From the illness of the five poisons, the obscuring emotions, And developed loving-kindness, compassion, and Bodhicitta. I know that all phenomena are illusory; I have lit the blissful fire of twnmo in my body: At Mt. Kailash 283 The experience ofbliss and void is uninterrupted. I have opened the nadis in the enjoyment chakra in my throat; Now, my vajra songs flow freely. I have purified all clinging to ordinary perceptions And experience the natural display of the Unsurpassable Pure Land. In dreams, in meditation, and in reality, I have beheld marvelous visions of deities · and Buddhafields. The eyes of wisdom, clairvoyance, miraculous powers, and so forth, All the signs and qualities of the path, have occurred. I have not the least preferential attachment: To me rocks and gold are quite the same [24lb]. Such is the brief story of your spiritual father's life. Son, use it as an aid for your devotion.

But he insisted, saying, ''I know you have no need for this, but please wear it just for today, so that I can accumulate merit. Later, give it to whomever you wish.\" He gave me the coat. I put it on, and sang this song: When I was wandering freely from place to place, When I was living in various distant places, I, the yogin, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Afraid of the cold, made myself a garment. I lined the light and soft brocade coat-The splendid deity, apparent yet unreal-With the soft lambskin fur Of the vividly clear three nadis and five chakras. I threaded a sharp needle--the ashelz-With a fine thread-the letter Hang, And, holding the vase, I joined the upper and lower energies. I have worked on this for months and years, And, through perseverance, it has come out nicely. Now, wearing it, my body feels completely warm, And both body and mind are comfortable.

Would you kindly advise me: how I can best serve and please you?\" [246a]. I replied, 'Well, to serve your guru, if you simply conform with what I just explained about good and bad attendants, that will do. However, in essence, this is what you should do in your daily activities: in the morning and evening do your spiritual practice as much as you can. In the daytime, avoid whatever would displease or dis-grace your lama; instead, render him whatever services please him. Do not distort anything he says. Help all your spiritual friends equally, with-out partiality. Care for the lowly and the poor as if they were your own children.\" Putting it into verse I said: My dear attendant Lobzang Sherap---Get up before dawn, Dress, wash your face and hands, Take refuge, generate Bodhicitta, and recite your daily prayers. Sweep the room and clean the hearth. Make a good fire without much smoke, Carry out your duties with diligence, And delegate work to others. When you talk, laugh, or sneeze, Take care that your saliva does not land in the cooking pot. Be clean with all food and drink; Prepare it without clumsiness or waste."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"When it's ready, serve everyone in proper order, And after that, eat your own food.

Assist them in meeting the lama and asking for teachings. Accompany those who leave and bid them farewell with gende words. Prepare the dwelling and bedding for new disciples; Welcome them with the flowers of pleasant speech. Even if they stay for a long time, don't make them feel uneasy. When they leave, give them whatever food you have, Accompany them for a short distance, And with kind words, send them on their way. Don't be intimate with some and distant with others, But care for all equally, whether high or low. At night you should wait to sleep Until you see the visitors to bed. When all is finished, Think about the next day's work. Consult the lama about the questions you have, And notify others if you have work for them. Th~n, go to bed. Recite the Seven-Branch Prayer, Do your regular practice as much you can, And sleep peacefully. Once you know how to organize your day, You can simply go on in the same way. At Mt. Kailash 289 So he did, and as long as he was my attendant, he was of great help to me. Later he became an excellent practitioner. My disciple Thaye Gyatso, \"Infmite Ocean,\" was also a true practitioner. He had devotion, pure perception of his spiritual friends, and great compassion for living creatures. I taught him the essential instructions of the sutras and tantras; through his practice of inner calm and insight meditation, of tummo and phowa, he had extraor-dinary experiences and realization. One day, to express his gratitude, he offered me a woolen blanket, saying, \"You have already been so kind to me; still, please give me some further advice\" [24 7 a]. He presented this request mverse: As gods and men respectfully paid homage To the Buddha when he came to this world, I, too, with supreme respect Bow down to the gracious guru. As the maiden Sujata Joyfully offered milk to the Buddha, I, too, present the glorious lama With real and imagined offerings. As Kmg Ajatasatru came before the Buddha And offered confession of his sins, I, too, before the eyes of the guru, Confess all my wrongdoing. As the beggar rejoiced In the virtue of Kmg Prasenajit, I, too, rejoice in the activity of the guru And the virtuous deeds of the exalted ones.

Wish-fulfilling gem, refuge and protector! Consider me with your great kindness. Jetsun, I have nothing else to ask of you but this [247b]: In this present degenerate age, Life is short, disease and dangers are rampant. I have known many who died in their youth; Really, one could die tonight. Even if one lives a long time, Half of life is wasted In the meaningless torpor of sleep, The other half is wasted in eating, drinking, and distraction, Leaving little time for Dharma practice. When I was young, I didn't think much about the Dharma. I was seduced by monastic wealth. Now I'm old and unable to practice the Dharma. Though it is late to begin practice now, I will emulate the householder Palkye. 22 As death draws nearer, I intend to practice the Dharma as best I can. Compassionate lama! Out of your great affection, please teach me How to reject nondharmic acts and thoughts, And how to practice in accord with the Dharma.

I replied: Depend upon an authentic guru, the source of all good qualities. Pray to him continuously and all your wishes will be fulfilled. Until you attain real confidence in practice, Stay in the company of true spiritual friends Whose excellence can help you reach the ultimate goal of the Dharma. Dharma practice makes meaningful The unique opportunity of your free, well-favored human birth. Death is certain, its time of coming is not; So, don't bother to accumulate wealth. Give up worldly dharmas and the divine Dharma will come about. Consider the shortcomings of the sense-pleasures; Sever your clingings and cravings. If you are weary of attachments, you won't need wealth. Cast away your possessions, and you will be done with your relatives as well. Give up your homeland, and attachments and aversions will subside of their own accord [248a]. Stay in a hermitage, and your practice will naturally increase.

I also gave my kind-hearted, devoted and generous disciplejigme Gyaltsen, \"Fearless Ban-ner ofVictory,\" some instructions on the nature of the mind according to Mahamudra. Within six months of practicing this meditation, he gained certainty regarding the teaching and unprece-dented experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-thought arose in his mind. \"This is due to my lama's kindness!\" he thought.

One day, with a white ceremonial scarf, he offered me some butter, sweet cheese, a piece of white woven wool, and a few turquoises on behalf of people who had asked for prayers. He respectfully offered me praise like those found in the life-stories of the past sages. Putting it into verse, he sang: You attained Buddhahood long ago, Yet, to guide the beings of this degenerate age, You came again as a renunciate yogin. Lord root guru, think of me. You took birth in Dorney, Yet your karma and aspirations Brought you to the Snow Mountain, Kailash. Here, according to the capacity of each individual, You have offered the feast ofDharma To all, regardless of rank or lineage. You have consecrated all holy objects that needed consecration; You have dedicated all merit that needed dedication. You have restored broken vows and samayas. You have given food, wealth, and clothing to the poor. You have taught the ignorant how to observe the karmic law of cause and effect. You have set every disciple ofNgari in western Tibet Onto the path to higher realms and liberation [250a]. This region is greatly indebted to you.

Earlier you gave me profound and extensive instructions, Yet I ask you to give me one more reminder. From now on, and for the rest of my life, May I only please you, protector, And accomplish your every command. Bless me that my wishes may come true. I replied, \"0 son, you entered the door of Dharma at a young age and were fortunate to hear many teachings and reflect upon them. In this degenerate time, life is short and the time of death is uncertain. Don't bother with external knowledge; tum your attention inward and prac-tice as I taught you earlier. For that, you must give up all thoughts of this life and stay by your-self in mountain retreats.\" Having explained all this to him, again, I told him in verse: Tendzin Rabgye, my son, You were ordained a novice at a young age, and you kept pure discipline. You served many gurus, well-known and unknown, You received empowerments, transmis-sions and instructions: Son of noble family, you have been fortunate indeed!

I understood that the nature of mind Does not truly begin, remain, or come to an end-It is substanceless; Its nature is emptiness.

Keep to your silent retreat, don't t3.l.k; Obstacles won't come, siddhis will. You who practice the preliminaries, Persevere throughout day and night. Meditators resting in samadhi, Meditate with unwavering body, speech, and mind. Practitioners of tummo, the path of skillful means, Be diligent, and bliss-warmth will blaze forth. Even those of you who know only the mani, Don't run around, stay inside; do your recitations. Be ready to starve to death for the sake of Dharma; Be ready to endure hardship for the sake of happiness in future lives. In brief, don't think so much! Put all your energy into practice! Thus I exhorted them. Some practiced for one year, some for two. Ngondro 31 practitioners had dreams indicating that their obscurations had been purified. Those who trained in relative Bodhicitta [258b] developed kindness, compas-sion, and the wish to benefit others. Those who meditated on absolute Bodhicitta were able to remain steadily in mind's true condition, the state of simplicity that is like the sky: empty, luminous, and beyond grasping. Phowrr2 practi-tioners had many signs, such as itching, swelling, and secretion of liquid at the top of the skull. Those practicing on prarur'33 gained extraordi-nary realization of bliss-emptiness, their bodies blazing with the bliss-warmth of tummo. In real-ity, in dreams, or in meditation, Chad practitio-ners had all the appropriate signs: the arising of challenging experiences and their successful ter-mination.

To make true Dharma come alive is difficult. With a full stomach, sitting comfortably in the sun, We might visualize deities down to the most minute detail, And count mantras, our lips mumbling diligently: Outwardly, we look like true Dharma practitioners. But when we encounter the slightest difficulty, Cold, hunger, fatigue, ghosts, or enermes, We can't bear it: our faults are brought to light, And we cease to appear as real Dharma practitioners. We relish delicious foods, comfortable clothing: The precious teaching slips away and is lost. The lama gives teachings but that won't suffice: We expect that he will also give us presents. We may give food and drink to friends, But we hope for something in return. At Mt. Kailash 303 We stay in remote and solitary places, But we hope that others will provide us with food and drink. When everything goes well, we want to practice Dharma; When things go wrong, we feel like giving up. Now we have become aware of thoughts And actions contrary to the Dharma [259b].

We stay in lonely mountain retreats But don't do our practice: we're just distracted. Far from developing meditative experiences and realization, We develop desires and cravings. ''Wouldn't it be something if people looked on us as great practitioners And gave us offerings and veneration!\" With this in mind, we stay in the mountains [260a]. We swear to practice for three years, But the days seem endless. We can't bear it any longer. We entrust our provisions and tsampa to a friend, And race down to the village, to be snared by attachment and aggression. If you really want, from the depths of your heart, to practice Dharma, Don't ever do this! Ema! Now that you have gained this human body, Rely upon your lama in thought and deed.

I said to my fortunate disciples, \"Between meditation sessions, while cultivating the deep understanding that everything is like an illusion, it will help you to chant from time to time these verses from the King of Samo.dhi Sutra:35 Like a mirage, like an illusion, Like the apparition of a city of gandho.rvas, 36 Like dreams-The forms you have been taking for realities Are empty by their very nature [261 b]: Know that all phenomena are like this. When the moon rises in a clear night sky, Its reflection appears on the surface of a calm lake. But the moon is not really in the lake, is it? Know that all phenomena are like this. When people who are in a rocky gorge Sing, or laugh, or weep, or shout, No one pays any attention to the echoes, do they? Know that aJl phenomena are like this. These echoes are but the empty resonance Of those songs, that laughter, weeping, shouting: They have no separate existence in themselves at all. Know that all phenomena are like this. When someone feels a pleasurable sensation in a dream, And then awakens, there is nothing left. But, under the enchantment of desire, A childish person clings to such experience. Know that all phenomena are like this. The illusory forms created by a magi-cian-Horses, elephants, and chariots-Have no real existence whatsoever: Know that all phenomena are like this. When a woman dreams that she has given birth to a son And then, in the dream, sees that son dying, She rejoices when he is born and She is grief-stricken when he dies. Know that all phenomena are like this. At night, in a clear, calm lake, The reflection of the moon Appears to be there in the water: Can anyone take hold of that water-moon?

Thinking that the watery trunk of the plantain tree Has a solid core, one may cut it down; But there is nothing solid there, outside or inside.

As months and years went by, I turned the Wheel of the Dharma for them at length. I taught stage by stage: first, according to the pro-visional, relative truth, I taught that actions have inevitable consequences. Then, according to the definitive, absolute truth, I taught that, by nature, even the most subtle particle lacks true existence. I wrote the Emanated Scriptures of the Kadam-pas, 37 explaining the heart essence of the teach-ing of the Victorious Ones-the gradual path for the three types of individuals-following the teachings of the Kadampa masters, and illustrat-ing them with various stories. I also wrote the Emanated Scriptures of· Margushri, 38 in the form of questions and an-swers. Using verse and prose alternately, it explains at length the crucial pith instructions of the graded path [262b], mind training, Maha-mudra, Dzogchen, and the Dohas. 39 When, over many days, I gave the transmis-sion and explanations of these two texts, rainbow canopies formed in the sky, flower-shaped rain-drops fell, extraordinary fragrances manifested themselves, and I felt that the sky was filled with celestial beings who had come to attend the teachings. The explanations I gave enabled fortunate students with sharp intelligence to comprehend the essential teachings of the Victorious Ones. Some became learned, virtuous, and noble dis-ciples who fully benefited themselves and others, and the Dharma as well. You may wonder what the term \"emanated scriptures\" means. In the past, the Great Mas-ter40 presented immeasurable outer, inner, secret, and absolute offerings to Manjushri, and prayed fervently to him.] etsun Manjushri then bestowed upon him the Great Emanated Scriptures of the Oral Transmission Pith Instructions, 41 a work which cov-ers the entire body of sutras and tantras. This Great Master handed these on to the lord of sUldhas Jam pel Gyatso (\"Ocean ofTender Glory\"), who gave them to Baso Chokyi Gyaltsen At Mt. Kailash 307 (\"Victory Banner of the Dharma\"), who then transmitted them to the mahasiddha Chokyi Dmje (\"Diamond of the Dharma\"), who gave them to Gyalwa Wensapa Lobzang Dondrup (\"Victorious Hermit 'Fulfilling lntelligence\"').42 The teaching I composed is not as perfect as its model, but, insofar as it consolidates the important points of the sutras and tantras explained therein, it is similar [263a]. The incomparable Atisha-the patriarch of the Kadampa teachings who perceived each word of the Buddha's as a pith instruction-and his spiritual sons, Drom Tonpa and the others, con-densed the essence of the eighty-four thousand approaches to the Dharma into a graded path for the three kinds of individuals, in a way that can be easily practiced. I extracted the instruc-tions and stories contained in these teachings and arranged them as a book. I called them \"emanated,\" to show their authenticity. They are \"emanated\" by the earlier Scriptures of the Kadampas,just as one butter-lamp lights another. As to the Emanated Scriptures of Manjushri: re-linquishing his long hair43 for the sake of the beings who needed care, the precious Manjushri, lord of supreme wisdom, manifested as the saf-fron-robed great protector Lama Tsongkhapa. Tsongkhapa composed the Great Graded Path, a lamp for the three worlds. My work is based on this and other similar works. The title indicates that it is an emanation from a pure source. The Emanated Scriptures of the Bodhisattva44 is so called because it is inspired by the life-story and writings of the precious Gyalse Thogme, the \"Unimpeded Bodhisattva,\" an emanation of Avalokiteshvara [263b]. The Marvelous Emanated Scriptures45 is based on the teachings and stories found in the dis-courses of the Victorious One and in various writings of learned and accomplished sages of India and Tibet. For these reasons, the mere titles of these texts carry, for future disciples, the blessing of the Buddhas of the three times. I told everyone, \"Put these teachings into practice; they will surely benefit your minds.\" The fortunate disciples gath-ered there felt faith and respect, and valued highly these writings. To purifY their karma and obscurations and"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"308 17ze Life of Shabkar to perfect their provision of merit, my disciples and patrons erected a stone Stupa of Enlighten-ment. I consecrated it and made prayers. Soon after, the anchorite Jetsun Sangye Dorje, \"Adamantine Buddha,\" came to this sacred place. I requested from him the transmis-sion of the cycle of the Formless Dakini 46 from the oral pith instruction lineage of Lodrak Marpa. I also requested teachings from all the lamas who came, in order to create spiritual links with them. I made the offering and prayers to Mount Kailash many times. One night I had a dream: Dordzin Rinpoche, \"Holder of the Vajra,\" a lama from Kailash, came and said to me, \"If you want to visit a sacred place, I shall take you there.\" I followed him and we arrived at a huge palace, resembling the Great Temple ofSakya [264a],47 made from a variety of precious stones. In its center was a stainless crystal stupa, brilliant and transparent as though made of light. Inside, the lord of the mandala was Chakra-samvara, surrounded by the deities of the four classes of tantra. They appeared clear, bright, and distinct, like reflections in a mirror. On seeing this, I prostrated myself and made circum-ambulations and offerings. Then, as I was pray-ing, light emanated from the hearts of the deities. It touched me, and I experienced an extraordi-nary bliss-void wisdom. Another day, while meditating I had a vivid experience: a host of dakas and dakinis appeared in the sky before me and said, \"We are circumambulating the palace of Chakrasam-vara.\" I watched them doing circumambulations in the sky around the snow peak of Mount Kailash, carrying a multitude of offerings. Once, some patrons from the area of the Crystal Peak ofRong48 insisted that I visit them. \"I can't come now,\" I said. \"Have faith and pray; I shall give a blessing just as real as if I had come in person.\" The patrons guessed that I would come there miraculously, and prayed with great faith. Repeatedly, I visualized myself going to their homes and blessing them [264b]. Through the auspicious link thus created, one day, some wood-collectors and herdsmen with pure vision and good karma saw me flying through the sky. I was coming from the direction ofMount Kailash, holding in each of my hands a white prayer-flag. They saw me land on the summit of the Crystal Peak, plant the prayer-flags, and fly away. They told the local people, who went to investigate. Everyone could see, on the top of Crystal Peak, a large white prayer-flag that hadn't been there before. This event aroused great faith and created auspicious circumstances for the Dharma to flourish in that area. During the three years I practiced there, through the combination of my students' deep faith and the blessing of my having meditated on the two Bodhicittas and practiced the development and completion stages, many of my devoted disciples and patrons had pure visions. Handprints and footprints were found in places where I had walked or sat, and became objects of reverence in the mountain monasteries. Spreading the word, faithful people said, \"In his sky-like meditation, he flew to the Crystal Snow Peak, and in his post-meditation, seeing all phenomena as illusion, he left footprints in the rock.\" Through the combination of the compas-sion of the lama and the Threejewels, the faith of the patrons [265a], and the strength of my pure aspirations, a new sun of happiness and well-being dawned: harvests were abundant, catde were healthy, gold ore was found, and auspiciousness prevailed throughout the region. The local men and women, laypeople and clergy alike, understood that this was due to the kind-ness of the lama and the Three Jewels. Filled with faith, many had the good fortune to enjoy the sacred Dharma. I told my disciples, \"If the disciples have faith, devotion, and pure perception, even though the teacher has not achieved any special quality of transmission and realization, they will see signs of accomplishment. This shows how important respect, devotion, and pure perception are. I have trained myself in these, and, as a result, I have had many excellent visions. You, too, my son-like disciples, must train yourselves, and your"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"vision will be pure.\" They all developed devo-tion, respect, and pure perception. Then, ten of my spiritual sons, who had renounced all thoughts of this life, spent a year receiving teachings and doing retreat. Among them were Ngawang Senge, \"Lion with the Power of Speech,\" a teacher deeply endowed with Bodhicitta; Tendzin W angchuk, \"Powerful Holder of the Doctrine,\" a Bonpo whose mind had turned to the Dharma; Trulshik Kunzang Rangdrol, \"Self-liberated Samantabhadra, the Destroyer of illusion\"; and my attendant Kalzang Sherap, \"Fortunate Wisdom.\" I supplied them with food, clothing, and teachings. Mter a year, they came to see me. They first offered me a scroll painting of the mandala of the Great Com-passionate One [265b], and then, for the sake of making a connection, each made a personal offering of whatever he had. Finally, with great respect they asked: \"Precious Lama, for one year you have given us food, clothing, and teachings. We are extremely grateful. Now, out of your great kindness, please give us some advice on what we should do when .we lea:ve here and wander from one secluded place to another.\" One of them expressed their request as a song: Your body is the embodiment of all Buddhas, Your speech is the source of the depth and breadth of the Dharma, Your mind is a vast treasury of wisdom, love, and strength: Lord root guru, think of us! 0 Protector, though you became enlightened long ago, Your loving heart could not bear The misery beings must endure in this dark age.

Practice the Dharma, which does have mearung; Become a pure renunciate, And apply yourself single-mindedly to practice In remote mountain retreats. Even if we, teacher and disciples, Don't meet again in this life, I pray that in future lives We meet again many times in a Pure Reahn. Tears fell from their eyes; touching their heads to my feet, they offered this song of good wishes: Peerless king who has conquered The relentless enemy-the obscuring emotions-Lord, farewell! Youthful physician who can remove The cataract of our ignorance--Lord, farewell! Authentic guru who gives food, clothing and Dharma To all humble practitioners, Lord, farewell! Wish-fulfilling gem Who grants all ordinary and extraordinary siddhis, Lord, farewell!

From now on, until we attain enlightenment, Lord, care for us always. The disciples who were to depart left in tears, making many prayers. The assembled friends remaining behind were so moved that they wept as well. For some distance, they accompanied their friends who were traveling to Nepal and then intended to wander on from place to place, with no particular destination in mind [268a]. Mter more than two years had passed in this great sacred place, I often talked to my disciples about leaving, and one day I sang this song: In a small willow grove The cuckoo flies happily here and there. But once he gets entangled in a net, He regrets his carelessness. Now he severs his ties to the willow grove And, freed, flies back into the heavens. The cuckoo makes his way through the blue sky-The place where the white vulture soars. In the cool shallow waters, The fish swims happily here and there. But once he is caught on a steel-blue hook, He regrets his carelessness. Now he breaks out from shallow water, And swims comfortably in the pure depths. The fish makes his way to the ocean-The playground of the great whales. In the quiet mountain retreat, The yogin lives happily amid his disciples, But once he is caught by the Lord of Death He will regret his heedlessness. Now, breaking the ties to this life, Traveling here and there to pleasant regions He will make his way to other solitudes Where past sages once stayed. Realizing that I was thinking ofleaving, Rabgye and other disciples presented many reasons why I should stay one or two more years to help them, and offered this song: You are the fire-crystal, the sun, Born in the land beyond the ocean [268b]. Because you dispel the darkness of the four continents, The beings here are happy; The wild flowers of this meadow Will sadden without you. Please remain in the azure heights, Continuing to illuminate us. You are the white snow lioness of the glaciers, Born in the high snow ranges. · Because you rule over the savage beasts, All other animals are joyful; The wild creatures of the forest Will sadden without you. Please remain on these mountain slopes, Tossing your turquoise mane. You are the authentic guru, Born in Dorney. Because you came to benefit others, Everyone is joyful; Your followers and disciples, Will be saddened without you. Please remain in this great sacred place, Granting us your teachings. When they thus entreated me, I could not resist their pleas; I had to promise to stay on a while longer. I then sang this song: Roaming the ordinary jungle, The Bengal tiger longed for the sandalwood forest. Forsaking the ordinary jungle, He reached the sandalwood forest-"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"The place where tigers display their splendid stripes. Roaming on the glacier's edge The white lion longed for the heights of the ice-peak.

Roaming at random from place to place, The yogin longed for the solitude of the wild mountains [269a]. Forsaking his wanderings, He made his way to this sublime sacred place-The place where yogins practice meditation. Pleased with this, the disciples made offerings, and held a fme ganachala-a feast. At the end of it they sang this joyful song: The fragrant lotus flower Gives off a most delicious scent, Even seeming content to do so; It unfolds itself petal by petal. Striped like small tigers, Humming our contentment, We bees fly easily through space In joyful celebration of the lotus flower. The dark and cool southern cloud, Lets fall a gende rain, Even seeming content to do so, It unfolds its varied transformations.

Kailash 313 To hold a feast with song and dance In joyful celebration of these teachings. Jigme Gyaltsen and a few other disciples said: \"Today we are indeed fortunate [269b]. Pre-cious lama, to benefit our minds, please sing a song of spiritual advice, and a short song in praise of this sacred mountain and the two lakes.\" I sang this song: Here is Manasarovar, the great turquoise lake, The fountainhead of the four great rivers. Here dwells the naga king, 52 The Lord who bestows upon this land Prosperity and auspiciousness. Here is the Vulture Peak, K.ailash, The center of the world, Where people of four human races come and go. Here dwells the Buddha himself, The lord who turns the Wheel of Dharma For the sake of sentient beings. The wish-granting jewel. Comes from a distant ocean. To free all beings from poverty. It is now set at the pinnacle of the victory banner And rains down all our needs: Whoever has a wish, come and fulfill it! The renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Was born in Dorney, Yet to benefit the Dharma and sentient beings, From the slopes of the Snow Mountain He now showers whatever Dharma one might wish for: Whoever has an interest, come and listen. The fragrant, exquisite lotus flower, Will one day be spoiled by frost, Its stalk will be wilted, its petals left behind.

It will purify your bad karma, unwhole-some deeds, and obscurations, And you will reap blessings and accomplishments. After I sang this, they prostrated themselves with fervent devotion, offered many words of grati-tude, and returned to their hermitages. Almost three years had passed since I had come. I said to all my disciples [270b]: \"In the past, holy beings never stayed in one place for more than one or two years. This was not because they were unable to remain, it was for the exalted purpose of benefiting themselves and others. I have been in this excellent place three years now. I have taught you whatever I know, without keeping anything back. If you practice, you will be able to accomplish your rums. \"Owing to your kindness, disciples and patrons, in these three years, I, too, was able to complete my retreat, thus benefiting myself. Benefit for both self and others having been accomplished, it would be best if we parted now in such excellent circumstances and mutual sat-isfaction. Now, it is time to go: there is no point in trying to delay my departure.\" I explained to them at length why there was no reason to try to dissuade me from leaving, and at the end I sang this song: Once the proper number of days has passed No one can keep the moon From moving on to other continents. Powerful mantradho:ras, now it is your task To guard the garden of white lotuses From the threat of hail!

Powerful dharmapalas, now it is your task To guard the assembly of fortunate disciples, From the threat of disease and evil spirits! My disciples from Toding, Tashigang, and Purang did prostrations and said to me politely: \"Precious lama, wherever you go, you do nothing but benefit others. Yet, the benefit of helping a single being here, in this dark barbar-ian country, is far greater than that of helping one hundred beings in central Tibet, where the Dharma is well-established. A starving person is much happier with a handful of plain tsampa than is a well-fed person with a plateful of but-tery tsampa. 'We are grateful indeed for the teachings you have given us, but how can we, who are so stupid, comprehend all these teachings at once? Please teach us more, until we understand thor-oughly what to adopt and what to abandon. There have been many instances of siddlzas stop-ping the sun. Even if it is time for you to leave, please stay another year or two!\" They emphasized the reasons I should stay, finally condensing them into this song [2 71 b]: When the sun above, the sole ornament of the southern continent, Moves on to the western continent, Each being of the southern continent feels his own sun has set. lord, compassionate guru of sentient beings, If you move on to another country Each of us, unprotected disciples, Will suffer as though his own protector has gone. Once, when the sun that dispels darkness Was to leave for another continent, It was seized by an ancient siddha, And for many days stood still. Look at the life-stories of so many siddhos of the past-At Mt. Kailash 315 How they prepared to leave for the sake of other beings, And yet would prolong their stay for many years When supplicated by their faithful disciples. Compassionate lord, protector ofbeings, You ought to leave and help those elsewhere who need your care; Yet, because of our faith and yearning, You must stay for at least a year or two more. How can small children learn right away How to behave--to eat and do things properly? Over and over again, their mother must teach them. How can we disciples with confused minds Understand properly right away The causes and consequences of our actions And the depth and breadth ofDharma? Please teach us the Dharma again and again! I replied, \"I have no answer for that; I'll have to stay.\" They were all exceedingly happy and said to me, 'just as a king's statement is irreversible, since you, our lama [272a], the Buddha of the three times, have said you will stay, it would be wrong for you to change your mind again. On this occasion, please sing a ben-eficial song.\" I sang this: Just as, even having searched and searched, No one can ever fmd a royal white eagle That has died of starvation, No one will ever fmd the bones of a practitioner Who died ofhunger.

For the mouth to eat something very delicious, The hands must work very hard. To obtain the lasting bliss ofBuddhahood, One must diligently practice Dharma. Birds and wild animals Stay wherever they are content. Practitioners should stay Wherever their practice progresses. If the snow lion lives in the snows, Its turquoise mane grows lavish. If the meditator stays in remote mountains His meditation will flourish. A cat may look like it's fast asleep, But it hasn't forgotten about mice. A meditator may stay up in the mountains, But not forget about food and clothes. A fish lives in the water, But a hook pulls it out onto dry land.

Hanging around with coarse companions, You'll be stained by their bad behavior. Ants scurrying around here and there May get stuck in some pine-pitch.

When reasoning, the wish-granting tree, Is shaken by the wind of impermanence, Its leaves, melancholy songs like this, Lie scattered everywhere. This song prompted higher aspirations and a strong feeling of renunciation in many disciples. When I had finished my retreat and was about to set out on a pilgrimage, I sang this: In the turquoise lake ofManasarovar Lives the golden-eyed fish; Circumambulating the lake toward the right, It goes on to the waters of the Ganges.53 In the Snow Mountain Cave ofMiracles Lives the renunciate yogin; Circumambulating the Snow Mountain toward the right, He now goes on to other solitudes.

The authentic root guru May reside far away; Still, he benefits the faithful [273b] In this life and in the next. Worthy disciples, We have met but for a moment in this life. In future lives, when we meet again, May we remain together for a long time. Saddened by parting from their teacher, some disciples wept. During the waxing moon of the f:llth month in the year called \"Rich with Power,\"54 I circum-ambulated the Snow Mountain. I first reached Gyangdrak Monastery55 on the south face. There I performed the offering to the Snow Mountain, and offered donations and tea to the sangha. I met Serphuk Lama Rinpoche and requested from him the transmission of the preliminary practices for the Fivefold Mahamudra of the victorious Drigungpa.56 I then traveled on to the western ridge to Nyenpa Ridzong,57 where I saw the Choku Rinpoche statue. 58 I performed the offering to the Snow Mountain, and offered donations and tea to the monastic community. There, too, lived Dordzin Rinpoche,59 a true Bodhisattva. When I first met him, the very sight of him had caused my mind to merge with his.

Lord, hidden Buddha, think of me. Long ago, you attained the body of ulti-mate union, Yet you assumed again the form of a vajra holder To carry the burden of liberating all beings, our mothers (274a]: Your life is the most sublime of all!

Like the cuckoo that, sweetly singing, Flies off to distant places, So I, expounding the profound Dharma, Go off to distant solitudes. Like the eagle that soars higher and higher in the sky And flies off to whichever land it chooses, · So, I, having circumambulated this holy place, Go on, as I please, to other holy places. Protector, never cease to care For your disciples in this region. In this life and in all my lives, May I meet you many times again. After I offered him this, he spoke to me at length and with great kindness; he gave me pro-visions and other useful things for my journey. On the northern face I visited Drithim Phuk, The Cave in which the Dri Vanished,60 and made offerings to Mount Kailash and to the sangha (274b]. During the ganachokra offering, the great accomplished practitioners of this place sang vajra songs and performed Dharma dances in a most joyous manner. I finally came back to the eastern face. There, too, at the Cave of Miracles, I performed the offering to the Snow Mountain, and made dona-tions and a distribution of tea to the sangha. I gave alms to all the poor people and supplies to the resident monks and disciples for their re-treats. Before setting off we held a great ganachokra feast, and I blessed all those gathered there, pray-ing that they might encounter no obstacles in their spiritual practice. I ended with these words: ''Worthy disciples, listen carefully and re-member these words. The strength of our previ-ous karina and pure aspirations naturally brought us here, without anyone having called us to come together. Now, having spent three years in retreat, we must part. This illustrates the impermanence of this world--everything is transitory, changing more with every year. One cannot count on any-thing at all. Before reaching the age of eighty, most of us will have already left for our next lives. There is neither order nor fixed time for our deaths.

I pray that you tum toward the Dharma The minds of these sons and daughters of rnme, And put an end to all thoughts contrary to the Dharma. Faithful disciples assembled here, Listen to this beneficial advice: At all times, ceaselessly, Pray to the kind lord guru, Whose kindness can never be repaid. This human body is a very rare support to fmd; Now that you have found it, practice the essence ofDhanna. It is certain that we will all die, but uncer-tain when; Dismiss concern for this life alone. The sufferings of the lower realms are diffi-cult to bear; To fmd protection from fear, take refuge. The consequences of actions are inevitable; Give up wrongs acts and perform virtuous ones. There is no happiness anywhere in samsara; Strive to fmd the way out of it. At Mt. Kailash 319 To do so there are three trainings, The ground of which is discipline. You should guard it as you guard your own eyes. All sentient beings have been your kind parents [275b]; Care for them with kindness and compassiOn, And strive for their enlightenment. The practice of the six paramitas encompasses all Dharmas; Practice these six continuously. The Secret Mantrayana is the swiftest path; It is impbrtant to practice it in secrecy. If you wish to practice in this way, Remain in a remote mountain retreat. Buddhahood is not gained by practicing for a few months or years; You must practice the whole length of your life: This is crucial. This my ultimate advice; Were I to die now, I would have no other testament. Pray that you may put the Dharma into practice, Free from obstacles and deviations. They offered me whatever wealth they pos-sessed, with touching words, gestures, and feel-ings of immeasurable sadness.

Even if we don't meet again in this life, I pray that, in a future life, we come together In the eastern Buddhafield ofPureJoy. At the end of my song, most of the monks and disciples were in tears; for a moment no one could speak. Then they all accompanied me down to Dzongdo and, having prostrated themselves before me and circled me with reverence, they remained there [277a]. I walked on, looking back from time to time; as long as they could see me they stood there transflxed, and then slowly returned to their dwellings. Leaving the snow mountain, I went to teach in nearby Gangsakpa and Barkha Tasam. That night I dreamed that I sailed across a great lake in a boat, that I rode across a plain covered in filth, and that great wealth came to me. Combining pilgrimage with teaching, I went to Tsegyeh Monastery,63 to the households of Gopa Rinchen and Nyala Chukpo, to Dochu Monastery, Pretapuri,64 and Khyung Lung Mon-astery. In each of these places, I made offerings to all the sacred sites and shrines. Mter I gave teaching to the patrons, Gopa Rinchen offered me a tent worth forty silver sang and flve gold slw. Other patrons offered me many valuables--gold, silver, clothing, ornaments and food. At Mt. Kailash 321 I then continued on, visiting the monasteries on the banks of Manasarovar, Serkyi Chakyip Gonpa (the Golden Bird-shelter), Bcmri Gonpa (the Monastery of the Bon Mountain), Sera Lung Gonpa (the Monastery of the Hailstorm Valley), and Bon Phuk Gonpa (the Monastery of the Bon Cave).65 Everywhere, I offered tea, alms, and prayers. Then with some nomads from Hor and To, I went on to Rang Limi. Here many patrons from the Valley of the Crystal Peak came to see me [2 77b]. Giving them teachings, I was able to tum their minds to the Dharma. Many offered me food and cloth-ing. I went on, visiting the main families on the southern face of the Rang glacier, and having visited successively upper, lower, and central Purang, I gave to several thousand monks, dis-ciples, and householders empowerments of the Great Compassionate One and oflongevity, as well as transmissions and instructions for the development and completion stage practices of yida:m deities. In all these places I gave appropriate teach-ings. First, I would ask the disciples to practice the meditation and recitation of Vajrasattva to become suitable recipients for the teachings. Next, they would visualize the lama as Buddha Vajradhara upon the crowns of their heads and receive his blessing. Then, I would give some general teaching like this: You must attend this teaching with a good heart and think, \"As fast as I can, I must attain the precious and unsurpassable level of Buddha-hood for the sake of all sentient beings, my moth-ers, whose number is unfathomable like the sky. . For this purpose, I shall fust listen to the sacred and profound teaching from this holy and glori-ous lama, and from today onward, I shall prac-tice them. The Vqjra Peak T antra says:66 Gathering your attention, Listen to the teaching with a pure heart. The Udan01Jarga says:67 Giving up dullness and laziness, Listen with supreme joy."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"322 The Life of Shabkar The Garland of Rebirths says:68 As a patient listens to a doctor, Listen to the teaching with the intention of applying it [278a]. \"According to these words, listen to the teach-ing with a perfect attitude and respectful man-ners. \"Now that we have gained this great ves-sel-this life with its freedoms and endowments-we must cross the vast, awesome ocean of samsara. Why? Owing to virtuous deeds we have performed in the past, we now have the extraor-dinary good fortune to possess a precious human body with five unimpaired senses; we are able to speak and reflect. We have been accepted by a spiritual teacher, have met the teachings of the Victorious One, and are able to practice them. At this point, knowing what we should do, if we fail to practice the Dharma-the surest way to free ourselves from the wheel of samsara-we will fmd out how diflicult it is to gain such an existence in the future and how exceedingly rare it is to meet the Dharma. The Buddha said: Countless realms fill this universe-To be born on the continent of Jambudvipa is rare, To obtain a sound human body is exceedingly rare. As it is stated in 7he T antra of the Enlightenment of Maluwairocana:69 The omniscient ones in this world Are like the Udumbara flower: In a hundred kalpas, one may or may not appear. The Secret Mantrayana tradition is even more rare. Lord Tsongkhapa said: To obtain a human body and meet the Dharma Is very rare: it has happened just this once. Right now is a unique chance to accomplish something meaningful [278b]. Consider this, and use this human body for what is essential. The omniscient Longchen Rabjam said: To gain this human body is one chance in a hundred. Moreover, to meet the Dharma is as rare as seeing a star in the daytime, And to meet the Dharma of the supreme vehicle is next to impossible. So now is the time to practice the sacred teachings wholeheartedly. \"As these quotations say, we must practice the Dharma. Not to do so would be worse than a seafaring captain returning empty-handed from the treasure-island. It would be like being a living corpse, or like a person having gone insane though not possessed by an evil spirit. It would be more senseless than filling with spit and excrement a vase made of precious jewels. The utter to a Friend says:70 To take rebirth as a human being, And still engage in evil acts, Is more foolish than to own A golden vessel studded with jewels, And use it as a dustbin or a chamber pot. \"Thus on top of missing the path of libera-tion the fool will fall into the abyss of the three lower realms, where, for many millions ofkalpas, he won't even hear the word 'happiness' [279a]. In Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Acti:ui.p/1 one fmds: Ifl do not practice virtue, And instead accumulate negative acts, In many hundred millions of kalpas I shall not even hear of the higher realms. \"There is no person in the world more fool-ish than one who, hoping to gain a little food and"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"clothing for this life, accumulates evil deeds and thus cuts himself off from happiness in future lives. Again, in Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Actizrity it is said: Having found such freedom, If I do not practice virtue, There is no greater delusion, No greater mistake. \"At death, such degenerate, ignorant, and destructive individuals are just objects of com-passion for the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The great master Padmasambhava said: A free, well-favored human birth is so hard to obtain! When the Lord of Death strikes one down in agony, How sad for those who are empty-handed, Who lack the Dharma! Men and women, you must discriminate between that which is important and that which is not by asking yourselves, examining any act, large or small, \"Is this in accord with the Dharma or not?\" Padampa Sangye72 said: One without courage rarely attains Buddhahood; Be equal to hardship, Tingri folk! . If you don't have time now, you will never fmd time later; This is your one meal in a hundred chances, Tingri folk! Recognize what is truly important; Don't waste your entire lives, Tingri folk! \"As these words say, 'Now that you have been born this time in a land where the Dharma flourishes, don't go empty-handed to your next life.' 'Wise, skillful, and courageous men and women: you have gained a precious human body; At Mt. Kailash 323 try to make it meaningful and satisfying. You may ask, 'Ifl just practice when it's convenient, is that enough?' No. That won't do. Why? Because, although you have gained this precious human life, it won't endure; it is subject to death [279b]. The Buddha said: When there is birth, there is death; When there is growth, there is decay. Youth does not endure; Radiant health is carried off by illness, Life is carried offby death: There are no lasting phenomena. The great rriaster Padmasambhava said: Failing to understand That all things are impermanent and unreliable, We continue to cling to samsara. Throughout our lives we are wishing for happiness, But our lives are consumed by suffering. We fritter away this human birth, Wasting its freedoms and endowments On the paths of distraction. A sick man at the point of death Is like a lamp running out of oil. Once the conditions for maintaining life have been exhausted, There is no way to remain. \"Thus, there is not one sentient being who, once having been born, will not die. There are no exceptions; there is no possible doubt. The master Asvaghosha said: Have you ever seen, heard, or even suspected That there is anyone on this earth or in the higher realms, Who, having been born, has not died?"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"324 1k Lift of Shabkar \"Great spiritual masters and eminent rulers, fabulously wealthy monarchs and starving beg-gars, newborn babies and eighty-year-old men-no one escapes the Lord of Death [280a]. Even so, most of you in this village--old parents, young children, beloved spouses and relatives-assume you will stay and make a lot of plans. But when that devil, the Lord of Death, shows up, you won't be able to stay even for an instant longer. Think about those who, without Dharma, walk empty-handed to the land of the next life. \"None of us here is beyond death. Like animals drawing near to the slaughterhouse, tak-ing one step after the other, every year, month, morning, and evening, we draw nearer to the formidable jaws of the Lord ofDeath. The Udano.-varga says: Those whose fate it is to be butchered, Come nearer and nearer to their slaughter With each and every step they take. So, too, goes the life of man. \"The girl Saleh 0, 'Brilliant Light',73 said to Jetsun Milarepa: Owing to the merit accrued in previous lives, I have, this once, gained a human body. Now, years and months push me from behind, Days and hours pull me from ahead-Each moment I come nearer to the dreaded death. Thinking about it, this girl feels dismay And longs to practice the blessed Dharma. \"Death is certain; when it will occur is not. Today you may have a beautiful, bright counte-nance, and by tonight, tomorrow, or the day after, have turned suddenly into a stinking, rot-ting corpse. This has happened to so many beings, yet not one of them thought, 'By tomorrow, I'll be dead.' \"This body, a combination of the four ele-ments, cannot be depended upon to endure even for as long as it takes to eat a meal. Our breath is just vapor, bodily heat a mere spark; at any moment they might vanish [280b]. \"Practice the Dharma now, when you have the chance to do so, this year rather than next, today rather than tomorrow: there is no time for being idle. The Victorious Kalzang Gyatso74 said: says: In the morning, you sit there, excited and healthy, Talking about how to take care of your friends And finish off your enemies. By dusk, at the sky-burial rock, Your corpse is fed to vultures And gets eaten by dogs. Isn't that really what happens? \"And in Engaging in tlze Bodhisattva's Activiry it Don't be heedless, thinking, 'I'm not going to die just yet-at least, not today.' \"And in the Udanavarga: There is no saying which comes first, Tomorrow, or the next life: Rather than making plans for tomor-row, Work for your future lives. ''When death comes you won't gain much from the achievements of this life--the houses you've built, the wealth you've accumulated, your acquaintances, children, spouse, servants, or possessions: only the Dharma can help you. In the Sutra o/Margushri's Perfect Emanation75 it is said: Your parents will be no refuge, Neither will your friends or relatives. You will leave all of them behind, And go on, all alone, to your next life."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"\"Also, the Great Master, Padmasambhava, said: Even if the King of Physicians appears, When your life span is exhausted, He cannot prolong it. A powerful man cannot prohibit death; A persuasive man cannot not talk his way out of it; A rich man cannot buy his way out of it You will have no power to take wealth, Food and possessions with you [28la]: Despite yourself, you will go, Like a hair plucked out of butter. 76 ''When death arrives, the power and influ-ence of a universal monarch will not help in the slightest. Rich as V aishravana, the god of wealth, you won't be able to take as much as a sesame seed with you. None of the parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, and friends who surround you can go with you. This is certain: at one point you will have to leave, like a hair pulled from butter. You will go alone, without protection, without refuge, along the long, narrow, unfamiliar, unpredictable track of the hardo, where you will experience terrifying hallucinations, beyond imagination. \"Then, except for the holy Dharma and your guides-the lama and the Three jewels-you will have no other assistance. No help will come from wealth, friends, and relatives of this life. But that's not all: driven on by your karma and obscuring emotions, you will wander through the three reahns of samsara; from then on there will not be a moment ofhappiness, only suffering. \"Born in the hell realms, you will suffer unbearable heat and cold. Born a hungry ghost, you will suffer the pangs of hunger and thirst. Born as an animal you will suffer from stupidity, and from being abused, killed, or eaten alive [28lb]. Born as a human you will suffer birth, ageing, sickness, and death. Born as a demi-god you will suffer from rivalry and fighting. Even if born as a celestial being, you will later suffer At Mt. Kailash 325 from transience when falling from that realm. The possibilities for suffering are limitless. In the Sutra of Intent Mindfol:ness77 one reads: Beings in the infernal realms Must endure being burnt in the fires of hell; Animals must endure being eaten by others; Hungry ghosts must endure hunger and thirst; Humans must endure a short lifespan; Asuras must endure quarreling and fighting; And gods must suffer from their own heedlessness. Thus in all of samsara there is no place-Even one as small as a needle-tip-Where real happiness is to be found. \"The Great Master Padmasambhava said: These sentient beings circle through The cities of the six realms From which they never find release, Like a water-wheel, continuously Turning round and round-how sad! \"Marpa of Lodrak said: Son, ponder the miseries of samsara. Even ifl were to manifest miracu-lously a hundred tongues And expound the sufferings of samsara for myriad aeons, I could never fully put those sufferings into words. Don't let the holy Dharma go to waste! This is my advice. \"Thus, the suffering in samsara is fathom-less. No matter where you are born, high or low, samsara is a place of suffering. Your compan-ions are your companions in suffering; your enjoyments are the enjoyments of suffering. Whatever you do will prove the source for additional suffering."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"326 1he Life of Shabkar \"Therefore, as if you had discovered your-self to be in a dark prison, you must try to escape from samsara [282a]. You must escape from this immense ocean, the torment of cyclic existence, in which you are driven on by the swelling waves of karma and the obscuring emotions, where the terrifying sea monsters of the three sufferings abound. \"Still, setting yourself free is not enough at all. All beings have been your kind parents in previous lives: you must liberate them from samsara. To do this you need first to attain Buddhahood, in which all defects are exhausted and all enlightened qualities perfected. For that, the Buddha taught infinite approaches to the Dharma. The Sutra of IndWidualliheration78 sum-marizes these: Doing no evil whatsoever, Practice virtue perfectly, Tame your mind completely: This is the teaching of the Buddha. \"This means giving up negative acts and performing wholesome ones. 'Negative' means attachment to oneself, aversion toward others, and mental darkness. These three poisons lead to the ten negative acts-killing, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying, slander, harsh words, gossip, greed, harmful thoughts, and wrong views [282b]. You should never commit these ten acts, or induce others to commit them, or rejoice when someone else has committed them. If one fails to reject like poison even the slightest negative action, great suffering will fol-low. It is stated in the Uda:navargtr. Committing even a small misdeed, Will lead to great fear and utter misery In the next life: It is the same as swallowing poison. \"It is most important, therefore, to confess your previous negative acts and vow not to com-mit them again. For instance, someone may have been poisoned in the morning and be cured in the evening by taking an antidote. Similarly, through confession and vowing to shun future wrongdoing, negative acts can be purified. In this way, even great sinners can have the good fortune to reach the higher realms and achieve liberation. Therefore, until you die, muster your intelligence, confess your negative actions, and vow to amend your conduct. \"Similarly, wanting to give up negative acts and undertake virtuous ones, you may wonder what positive acts are. Positive acts include being aware that all sentient beings have been your kind parents in previous lives. Be sympathetic toward the destitute who come to your door and toward all those who suffer. Show tenderness toward those who are unhappy. Vow to attain enlightenment in order to dispel others' suffer-ing, and establish them in happiness. Resolve that you will practice the Dharma for that very reason. 'With kindness, compassion, and the aspi-ration to attain enlightenment, cherish all living things, be generous without attachment, main-tain discipline, speak the truth, reconcile adver-saries, speak gently, celebrate others' good qualities, be content [283a], be kind toward oth-ers, and trust the law of karmic cause and effect. In this way practice the ten virtues. \"Also, offer prostrations and circumam-bulations, sponsor the making of sacred objects symbolic of the enlightened body, speech, and mind, read scriptures, perform offerings, remem-ber the words and meaning of the teachings, contemplate them, explain them to others, and assimilate the ultimate meaning. Perform such virtuous deeds yourself, inspire others to perform them, and rejoice when they do. \"Thus, beginning by doing small virtuous deeds, little by little, like water drops which gradu-ally fill an entire jar, you will eventually attain the level of Buddhahood. The Condensed Perfect:Wn of Wtsdom states: 79 Drops of water falling into ajar Little by little, fill it; The aspiration to enlightenment, the initial seed, Eventually blossoms into Buddha-hood, Complete with all the pure qualities."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"''Whatever positive act you seek to under-take, do not lose courage: be like a heroic warrior hurling himself into battle.

I pray to the compassionate teacher [283b]: Look upon all of us, your followers. Protector, may your blessings Enable us to follow your life-example, And practice according to your instructions. Lord Buddha, the fourth of the perfect guides,80 Displayed infmite deeds in his many lives, Yet, in essence, he first meditated on kindness and compassion; He cultivated the wish to attain enlightenment, And put that wish into practice-the two Bodhicittas. Next, he abandoned all concern for himself, Strived for the sake of sentient beings, Whom he considered to be like mothers, Swiftly attained Buddhahood, And now reigns as the crown of all beings. Taking as examples the lives of the compassionate Buddha, Cultivate kindness and compassion for sentient beings, your mothers, And develop the two Bodhicittas-aspiration and action. Offer gain and success to others, And take loss and defeat upon yoursel£ At Mt. Kailash 327 The complete detailed exposition of the Buddha's Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma is unimaginable, Yet the essence is, \"Give up negative actions; do what is good; Tame your mind and the obscuring emotions.\" So, in accord with the compassionate Buddha's words, Reject as you would reject poison the ten negative deeds: Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, Lying, slander, gossip, harsh words, Covetousness, ill will, and wrong views. Practice instead the ten immaculate virtues: Safeguard living things, be generous, Keep your vows, speak truthfully, Reconcile conflicts, speak gently, Extol the virtues of others, be content [284a], Be kind to all beings, And develop conviction in karma, the law of cause and effect. When the mental poisons arise-desire, anger, ignorance, pride, jealousy, and greed-Counteract them immediately with antidotes.

They also sang and danced to the song that begins, \"Earth goddess, earth goddess ... ,\" and to others as well. Celebrations were held over many months. The joy of young and old matched the happiness of celestial beings. Wealth and bounty were showered upon me. I was offered futy sho of gold by Dorje Wangchuk of Limi, fifteen by a wealthy lady of the southern slopes, and between ten and thirty each by the wealthy Logpa and Gyashang, by the general of K yithang, and by the prosperous families ofPurang. Even those who weren't rich offered two or three sho of gold, clothes, head ornaments, and whatever precious things they had. Altogether, the gold alone made up a full load for a horse. I was also offered thirty gold tangka-coins, one hundred big and small silver reliquary lockets [285a], five large and small mandala offering plates, two silver butter-lamps, three torma trays, eighty pearl and coral earrings, a full bag of turquoise, coral, and amber hair ornaments, forty-three rolls of new brocade and woolen cloth, ten rolls of old woolen cloth, twenty-five excellent horses, and two mules. There were also countless persons who offered silver tangka-coins, blankets, rolls of woolen and of cotton cloth, and an incalculable number of white scarves. Since I was born, I had never experienced being surrounded by so much wealth and com-fort as in that year. With this wealth, on the roof of the assembly hall of the Shephel Ling monas-"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"tery, I erected two big victory banners, oneganjira pinnacle ornament, and a thousand-spoked Dharma-wheel flanked by a male and a female deer-all made of copper covered with gold. I used seven hundred sho of gold for the gilding.

With objects worth one thousand sang, I created a permanent fund for offerings. I distributed alms and tea to the monks. I requested the em-powerment of Bhairava from the abbot, and made him a large offering of gold and other valuables; he was very pleased. Depa Wangpo undertook building a. high stone wall to hold back the water that had been damaging the temple of the silver J owos of Purang. 86 This took two months, and involved bringing stones on horse-drawn carts from dif-ferent places. From then on, the water did no damage. Depa Wangpo thus rendered a great service to the threejowo images [285b]. He also erected two gilded copper victory banners on the roof of the temple, toward which I contributed ten sho of gold. I filled a huge brass lamp and a cast-iron cauldron with an ocean of melted butter and made a thousandfold offering, with vast aspiration-prayers. My close disciple Rigdzin Orgyen Namgyal offered lotus flowers to be held by each of the three Jowo statues and, later, Khampa Tulku offered a volume of scripture and a sword of pure beaten silver.87 I then prompted my close disciplejimba Norbu to offer a splendid butter-lamp made from three hundred sho of gold. I spent the winter staying in the Kangyur Lhakhang, 88 where I read the Kangyur, the Tengyur, and the collected writings of Lord Tsongkhapa and his spiritual sons. I wrote a work in which I included many of the stories about the Buddha's life, about the way his fol-lowers practiced, and about his teachings on both the Dharma and ordinary life-what should be given up and what should be accomplished. I called this work the Marvelous Emanated Scriptures. 89 At Mt. Kailash 329 Everyone took good care of me. When I was about to leave, the local authorities presented me with a set of clothes, a saddle, a saddle-blanket, a bridle, and one hundred and eight sho of gold. I was also invited to visit some monks and some rich people, several of whom offered me six or seven sho of gold each. The next summer, I went to upper Purang with many students and benefactors of Purang [286a]. At Kardung, we met Lama Kalden from Lokha in central Tibet, a Khenpo from Ladakh, Tendzin Nyima, and the Dharma practitioners Kalzang Tsultrim and Rigdrol, who had come up from the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang. Ladakh Khenpo had renounced this worldly life to go wandering from one mountain retreat to another. He offered me five dotse of silver, and many brocades of different colors. I gave him the name Jatang Rinchen, \"The Precious Renun-ciate,\" and made extensive dedication of merit and prayers for him. Drubwang Kalden offered me one dotse and many ceremonial silken scarves, short and long. The others also offered me differ-ent things, worth seven dotse altogether. Out of this, I left one hundred silver sang as an offering of a permanent fund at Purang Shephel Ling and the rest as a contribution for a golden lamp for Ganden. Then we, teachers, patrons, and disciples, reached the shore ofManasarovar, at the South-em Gate of the Thaw. We stayed there many days. I offered money and tea to the monastic community. In the great turquoise lake of Manasarovar, the spiral of auspiciousness and good fortune, I placed an offering of twenty-one vases filled with various kinds of grains and pre-cious stones. I concluded with wishes and prayers that, in all countries, rains be timely, crops be abundant and cattle thrive [286b].

This inspired me to sing this instruction to my worthy heart-son Orgyen Namgyal: Omniscient lama Whose wisdom mind is wider than the sky, Grant your blessing that My mind and yours may merge as one. Like dreams, like apparitions: All these phenomena of samsara and rurvana. Like the wide sky: One's own mind. All the phenomena of samsara and nirvana Are the natural play of mind-This I've come to understand. The source of all phenomena of samsara and nirvana Is the true nature of one's own mind: An immense expanse that is an empty brilliance Completely free of taking things as real: This I have realized.

When I remain in this state, Which is like a transparent, empty sky, I experience joy beyond words, thought, or expression. When I dissolve into that vast expanse--Empty and clear-Without end, without limits-There is no difference between mind and sky. Looking on with the eyes of a wisdom That is more immense than the all-encompassing sky, The phenomena of samsara and nirvana Become delightful spectacles. Within that brilliant continuum, There is no need for effort. Everything occurs by itself, Completely at ease, very naturally: Complete contentment! [287a].

The view, free from bias or polarity, Is the all-pervasive vast expanse. The meditation, free from mental dullness and wildness, Is the complete transparence of awareness.

Yet you are abandoning us poor people ofTingri. What shall we do?\" This advice, his testament, was his response [288b].

Teachers such as the matchless Potowa became devoted to him. With the pure motivation of bringing benefit to the mind-streams of his fortunate students, Karak Gom-chung wrote these seventy admonitions ending with the interjection ang!

Through these instructions, pure seeds were sown in the mind-streams of all those present. Sponta-neously, they all became diligent renunciates, who lived only in mountain retreats, in harmony with the Dharma. One day Lama Kalden told me, \"I heard from a pilgrim that one of your root-lamas, the compas-sionatejampel Dozje97 from Dorney, has passed on to another Buddhafield.\" Filled with sadness I said: At Kushinagara in India, The protector ofbeings, the Buddha, passed into nirvana. From the Gungthang pass in the Land of Mang, Padmasambhava left for the cannibal island to the southwest [290b]. At Nyethang in central Tibet, Jowo Atisha passed into the realm of the invisible. From the manifest palace ofChubar, Jetsun Milarepa left for the Buddhafield of Pure Joy. From the monastery ofGanden, The second Buddha went to Tushita heaven. In the palace that is the Potala on earth, Our refuge and protector tossed away the flower of his life. 98 Now, in Lower Kham, My root guru has departed for another Buddhafield. Kye-hu! The sun, the precious master, has set; Who will bathe us in rays of compassion? The medicinal tree of Dharma has fallen to the ground; Who will cure the diseases of the obscuring emotions?"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"The snow peak of the four empowerments has collapsed; From what source will the rivulets of blessing flow? The treasury of liberating instructions has been emptied; Who will dispel our poverty? The great drum of the vast and profound Dharma has been rent; How will the sutras and tantras resound? The standard of the profound instruction has fallen; How will the flag of the whispered lineage wave? In brief, the crown jewel has been lost; To whom will we direct our wishes? Kye-hu! The blind man, lost in the desert, In despair calls out for guidance. The young orphan who can't manage on his own, Crying, thinks of the mother who once cared for him. The fish flopping on dry land, Stares toward the water and vainly tries to leap into it. I, luckless, sunk in the mire of samsara, Pray to my lord and guide: In whichever Buddhafield you may dwell, Look with compassion upon me, the one left behind. I am now old, close to death; When death comes, lead me along the path. I pray to meet you again, Face to face, in a Pure Realm. Jetsun, by your blessings, May my prayer be fulfilled [291a]. At Mt. Kailash 335 I performed some meritorious deeds, praying that his enlightened intentions might be fulfilled. Some days later, I sang this song with a sad mind: He who frees us from the fears of samsara, Our escort, the lama, has departed. Left with no protector, We are lost in a desert of despair. The old people of my native region, whom I knew for so long, Have now passed away-Even my old mother has left this world, Without the two of us meeting one last time! Where did the years, months, and days go? Unnoticed, they slipped away in an instant! My life runs out in meaningless distractions; I feel utterly depressed. I may have gained this free and fortunate human body, Yet I haven't really practiced the divine Dharma. Most of my relatives and friends have passed away, Yet I am oblivious to death and llTipermanence. I may bear the marks of grey hair and wrinkles, Yet I don't recognize this as old age. I may have illness and fever, Yet the thought that I may die doesn't even occur to me [291 b].

The monks, disciples, patrons, laymen and laywomen, who had been following me on the way, gathered around and we exchanged words of farewell. I gave them my spiritual protection, blessed them, and concluded: \"Supreme among the four continents, where it is difficult to gain rebirth, isjambudvipa in the south. The Buddha, the Conqueror, has walked on this earth and blessed it as a Pure Realm for his followers. We have taken birth on it, having gained a rare and precious human existence, complete with the eighteen freedoms and favor-able conditions, more valuable than the wish-fulfilling gem. We have met the precious teaching of the Buddha, the source of benefit and happi-ness, rarer than the udumhara lotus. 'We have met a lama, a spiritual master, an occasion rarer than a star in the daytime. Perse-vering in virtuous actions, we must again obtain birth in the higher realms of celestial and human beings and reach the certainty and excellence of omniscience. When one has a boat, one should cross the ocean; when one has gathered an army of heroes, one should defeat the enemy; when one has a wish-granting cow, one should milk it; when one has a superb horse, one should ride it to faraway places. You now have a precious human body and a lama who embodies the Buddhas of the three times. With great joy and enthusiasm think that, traveling the highway of the sacred Dharma [292a], you will come closer and closer to the higher realms and to the ulti-mate excellence of liberation and omniscience. \"Not attached to your body, to an entou-rage, to relatives, or to the possessions of this life, right now, concentrating solely on the holy Dharma, embark upon the path ofliberation. If you don't, it will be worse than a seafaring mer-chant returning home empty-handed from an island of jewels. You would be behaving as if you were mad; you would be as good as a corpse, even though you were still breathing. 'Whether or not you have reason, courage, creativity, and intelligence is now-clear. Don't waste your precious human existence and end up empty-handed; practice the sacred Dharma according to your lama's instructions. At the time of death, perceive your lama or yidam deity corning in reality to guide you to a perfect Buddhafield-the realm ofPureJoy, the realm of Celestial Enjoyment, the Paradise of Bliss, or another-and go there just like a child going home to his parents. A fortunate person who, without delay, joyfully applies himself in this way has all the above qualities. \"Consider someone who does not embrace the Dharma, refuses even to listen to an authen-tic teacher, and day after day accumulates a full measure of negative actions for the sake of food, clothing, family, and all the rest [292b]. When that person dies, many messengers ofYama will appear-fierce, enraged, merciless, and hideous in color, tying one by the neck with a black rope, striking one's body with sharp weapons-and will lead that person down to one of the three lower realms, the eighteen hells or others, as if tugging that person, terrified and powerless, into a black dungeon. People like that-male or fe-male, high or low-have no hearts in their chests and no brains in their skulls; they are worse than lunatics--cheating, deceiving, ruining themselves. \"Don't return empty-handed from the jewel island. You have been born in a civilized country where the holy Dharma is taught; it is imperative that you practice it. Immediately, vigorously, throw yourself into your practice, since, although you may have gained this rare and precious human body, you won't keep it for long; you will die. \"No one will escape death.

With each passing year, month, day, morning and evening, we are drawing closer and closer to the feared maw of death, like an animal being taken to the slaughterhouse draws closer to its death with every step it takes. Appalling! Horrible! What agony! \"There are means to preserve life--medi-cine, food, clothes, and so on-but even these, when used wrongly, can become the causes of death. People die while trying to seek food and clothing, infants are smothered under their blan-kets, people are poisoned by food, die by taking the wrong medicine, are betrayed by intimates, are crushed under their collapsing houses, are dragged on the ground after falling from their horse--all previously helpful conditions that can become causes of death. There are also 404 diseases, 80,000 evil influences, and a multitude of circumstances that are injurious to life and cause death. \"No one who dies suddenly has had the least thought on the previous day that he was about to die. Yet, there is no certainty that the Mara of Death will not strike right now, like a bolt of lightning. Today an eloquent, radiant person; tomorrow a stinking corpse. This hap-pens all the time. No one really thinks that he or she will die tomorrow, yet this body, an aggre-gate of the four elements, cannot be relied upon to last even for the duration of a meal.

Your bed, clothes, dishes-everything is just left behind, discarded. Taken away from your home and companions, you must go. 'He died'; 'she died.' Nothing but these words are left of you. \"In short, life is less enduring than autumn mist, and one is as easily parted from one's spouse, relatives, and companions as from people met in a marketplace.

You may be rich as V aishra-vana, the god of wealth: you won't be able to take anything, not even as much as a mustard seed, on the journey to your next life. Like a hair plucked from butter, you will be pulled out alone from among the multitude of your parents, broth-ers, sisters, and friends. \"Though they cannot bear to be parted for a second from the house they've built [294a], the wealth they've accumulated, their friends, rela-tives, possessions, and the children and spouses who were like their own hearts, people must leave everything behind.

It is neither like the crying of someone who tells a lama his worldly troubles about food and cloth-ing, nor like the tears caused by one's spouse or relatives. It is said that tears shed while thinking of the guru can close the doors of the Hell of Blisters. 99 \"To cry when parting from one's guru, and when one's father or mother dies, is a noble thing in this world.

Its other names are the Unvanquished Turquoise Lake (maphomg:Ju mtsho), Anavatapta, the Ever-cool Lake (mtsho ma dros pa), and the Divine Lotus Lake (padma Uza mtsho). It is called the Unvanquished Lake because when one examines all the other great lakes of Tibet to see if they possess the eight qualities of perfect water (chu yan lag brgyad ldan) they are faulty in some respect. It is called Turquoise Lake because its limpid waters re-semble a turquoise mandala. It is given the name Ever-cool Lake because it is the palace of the naga king Anavatapta, \"Who Never Warms Up.\" It is called Divine Lotus Lake because it resembles a fully opened eight-petaled lotus.

It is recounted in the Chalcrasamvara T antra and its commentaries (as related in MK) that the world was once ruled by Bhairava, the wrathful form of Mahadeva, who made the land ofMagadha the seat of his power. It is said also that four devas and four gandharoas descended from the sky and established their dominion in eight places known as the eight Celestial Abodes (mkha' spyod lgignas brgyad). Likewise, four yakshas and four rakshasas, already on the earth, made their way to Jambudvipa, where they estab-lished themselves in eight Earthly Abodes (sa spyod lgi gnas brgyad), while four nagas and four asuras came to Jambudvipa from beneath the earth, to settle them-selves in eight Underground Abodes (sa 'og gi gnas brgyad). They invited Bhairava to visit their dwellings, twenty-four in all, but he, instead of coming person-ally, manifested in each place as a lingam to which these savage beings would make blood sacrifices. These demonic forces prevailed from the \"golden age\" until the beginning of our present \"era of strife and conflict.\" It was then, the tantra recounts, that the Blessed One, Vajradhara, knew that the time had come to subdue these unsuitable beings. Without his mind ever wavering from objectless compassion, he arose in the formidable wrathful display of a Heruka with four heads and twelve arms. He danced, and through the power of the nondual wisdom of all the Buddhas, trampled down Mahadeva and his consort together with their retinue, liberating their minds into the absolute expanse and establishing them in great bliss. The Heruka then blessed each of the twenty-four abodes as a palace of Chakrasamvara and each of the the twenty-four lingams as a mandala of sixty-two wisdom deities. The sixty-two are Chakrasam-vara, his consort, and his retinue: the twenty-four male and twenty-four female Bodhisattvas, and the twelve goddesses. At the nirmanakaya level, it is said that Mt. Kailash was miraculously blessed by Buddha Shakyamuni and five hundred arhats. Once, Ravana (mgon po beni'J and his consort had taken to their palace in Lanka one of the three statues of the Buddha Shakyamuni which the Lord himself had blessed. Desiring to place this statue on a worthy support, Ravana had planned to take Mt Kailash on his back and carry it to Lanka. At the same moment Lord Buddha and five hundred arhats came flying through the sky and alighted· to the west of Mt. Kailash, At Mt. Kailash 343 leaving their footprints in the rock. The Buddha stepped on all four sides of the mountain, leaving footprints in the rock that are known as the Four Immutable Nails of Kailash (mi gyur ba'i gzcr b;dzi). Ravana was thus unable to lift the mountain. Then the Buddha sat on a rock in front of the mountain and taught the Dharma to the naga king Anavatapta, the lord of Lake Manasarovar. He then taught the Lankauatara Sutra to Ravana, and blessed him and his consort as the Glorious Wisdom Protector, the Great Being and Consort (dpal ye shes mgon po beng chen !cam dra~. Mt. Kailash was later blessed by Guru Padma-sambhava, and became famous afterJetsun Milarepa lived there in meditation and held his contest of miracles with Naro Bonchung (see below, note 11). Later Gyalwa Gotsangpa (see note 60), Lingje Repa (gling rje ras pa, 1128-88), and many other great medi-tators lived ascetic lives at the foot ofMt. Kailash. In particular, holders of the Drigung Kagyu lineage frequented the place in great numbers. Drigung Jigten Gonpo ( 'bri gung Jigs rten mgon po, 1143-121 7) had a dream in which the guardian deities of the three holy places ofTsari, Lapchi and Kailash came and prostrated themselves before him, requesting him to go and bless their territories.Jigten Gonpo replied that he would send great meditators instead. Accordingly, he dispatched 80 hermits to each place. Some years later, he reputedly sent 900 hermits and fmally 55,525 practitioners to each site (see Huber 1989). At Kailash they were under the leadership of the great pandita Y akgangpa (pan chen yag sgang pa, who is also called, according to MK, p. 59, Dordzin Guhya Gangpa, rdor 'dzin guhya sgang pa); at Lapchi the practitioners were led by Geshey Paldrak (dge bshes dpalgrags, 12th,-13th century); and at Tsari they were under the guidance of Dordzin Gowoche (rdor 'dzin mgo bo che). In the three sacred places of Kailash, Lapchi, and Tsari, Dordzin (rdor 'dzin, \"Holder of the Vajra\") usually refers to a spiritual master or an administrator sent from Drigung Mon-astery as representative of the Drigung hierarchs. (See Petech 1978, 317.) 11.

There, I explained the Dharma to the Horpa chieftain Truk and other patrons, cutting the stream of negative action and initiating the stream of virtue. People offered me many horses and a lot of silver and gold, tea and butter. That year, everyone gave up the sin of kill-ing, and the official traders, going back and forth, said that meat had become scarce. Having reached T rocho, I went to the home of Gopa LobzangTrinley, sonofGopa Trungse. He gave me many ornaments of gold, silver, turquoise, and pearls, as well a large number of silver dotse. The rich people of Trocho too offered me horses, clothes, turquoise, corals, and various precious things. I then gave more than a thou-sand silver coins' worth of these things to about twenty-five families of hunters who used to kill thousands of antelopes and other game every year [30 l b]. I taught them the Dharma of cause and effect and made them promise to stop hunt-ing. I also gave them advice about worldly affairs. I collected five or six yak-loads of ropes and trappers' nets and burned them all. I then brought together the hunters and the wealthy families of Trocho, made them sit together, and told them that if the hunters stopped killing, the rich must help them. Later on I heard that the rich people were giving the hunters food and clothing in exchange for some work, and that all were happy.

Following this I offered tea and distributed money to the entire monastic community ofGanden, and concluded with stain-less prayers of dedication. People said that this lamp weighed approximately one hundred and eighty sang of gold. In those days, a new temple was being built at Samye; as a contribution I offered a hundred sho of gold and five horses, as well as turquoise, corals and amber worth one dotse of silver. I sent my offering through the regent-king of Tibet. 5 Soon after, the treasurer Depa Wangpo [302b] went to stay for some time at Y erpa Lhari Nying-po Mountain near Lhasa. Practicing as best he could, he gained peace of mind. With a few disciples, I then went through Namgyal Lhatse to the southern land ofChumik Gyatsa, the Hundred Springs, where one fmds fire coming from stones and frre burning upon the water.6 On the way I met my close disciple Kunzang Shenpen, who was coming up from the holy place ofT sari, where he lived. He asked me, \"When you were living at Mt. Kailash did you give many teachings? Did many of your disciples practice the Dharma?\" Mter giving him a detailed answer in prose, I spoke these verses: I bow down at the feet ofthejetsun Lama. Look with compassion upon all your followers, And bless those to whom I have taught the Dharma So that they may practice in accordance with it. This is how I taught the Dharma To the faithful who lived at the Snow Mountain: I taught the Dharma, Telling them to make offerings, prayers, and render service To authentic teachers and the Three Jewels. I taught the Dharma, Telling them the rarity of the freedoms and favorable conditions, To inspire them to use their human existence meaningfully. I taught the Dharma, Telling them of impermanence and death, To spur their diligence for the sake of the next life. I taught the Dharma, Telling them of the suffering of the six realms, To extinguish their thirst for samsara. I taught the Dharma, Telling them the defects of the objects of desire, To inspire them to give up craving for wealth. I taught the Dharma, Telling them how to meditate on compassion [303a], So that they might never forsake sentient beings. I taught the Dharma, Telling them how arouse great compassion And generate Bodhicitta. I taught the Dharma, Telling them to shun The ten unvirtuous actions and other wrongdoing. I taught the Dharma, Telling them to strive To gather virtue through the six perfections and other means. I taught the Dharma, Telling them to benefit others as much as they could Through the four ways of gathering."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"I taught the Dharma of the profound Secret Mantrayana Through which Buddhahood can be attained in one lifetime.

I taught the Dharma, telling the chiefs To protect their subjects with loving-kindness. I taught the Dharma, telling the subjects To serve and respect their leaders. I taught the Dharma, telling all To serve their parents, for they are the kindest of all. I taught the Dharma, telling everyone To abandon killing, for life is dear to all. I taught the Dharma, telling the rich Not to be stingy but to make offerings and gifts. I taught the Dharma, telling people To cultivate pure perception toward all traditions and doctrines. Thus, by the power of having taught the Dharma, there appeared: Many disciples, practitioners, and faithful ones, Many who gave up thoughts of this life [303b], Many who remained in mountain retreats, Many who had great compassion, Many who had generosity and wisdom, Pilgrimage to Nepal 351 Many who worked for the sake of others, and Many who had pure perception. There is no way to recount all that happened, So, for now, this will suffice. Continuing to expound the Dharma in this way, May I bring benefit to all beings. This song made Kunzang Shenpen happy. On the way, I bestowed longevity blessings on Jampel Dradul, king ofLo Mangthang,7 Trowo Palgon, king ofTrithok, Yonten Sangye, gover-nor of Jyulung, and to many other faithful men and women. I also gave them the followingteach-mg: ''We have now obtained this precious hu-man existence, but we won't stay for long. It is certain that we will all go to the unknown land of the next life, yet when we will go is uncertain. There is a danger that we may even set out this very night on the great path of death and imper-manence. \"At that time, those who have practiced the Dharma will ascend higher and higher to the freedom of the superior realms and experience happiness and bliss. Those who have committed negative actions will go lower and lower to the three inferior states of existence, and suffer there. Right now, when the power to ascend or fall is in your hands, you must give up the negative actions that will lead you to the inferior realms, and by all means accomplish the sublime Dharma that will cause you to ascend. \"Killing goats, sheep, and other wild ani-mals [304a]; taking wealth from others through stealing, robbing, or deceit; angrily scolding and abusing your servants and others-in brief, all evil thoughts and violence--are negative acts.

If, in accord with this, you abandon negative acts and accomplish positive ones, your present life will be happy and the next one also. ''We have established an auspicious connec-tion so that eventually we may all meet in a Pure Realm and achieve Buddhahood together!\" Then I sang this song: I bow down at the feet of the lord of men, the Munindra. Grant your blessing that my aspirations And those of others be accomplished. Listen while I explain the means to generate happiness both in this life and in the next: How to distinguish between what to avoid and what to accomplish.

Fortunate beings who have practiced the sublime Dharma in this life Will ascend to the freedom of the higher realms. The unfortunate, who have committed unvirtuous acts, Will descend to the three lower realms: You are now at the crossroad, which leads up and down-Don't take the wrong path! Therefore, to give up negative actions, which lead one down, And accomplish positive ones, which lead upward, do this: Have faith and respect in the Three jewels and the Three Roots. Develop compassion for all beings in the three worlds. Even for the sake of your father and mother, never take life. Even at the cost of your own life, never give up the Three jewels. Offer flowers, incense, lamps, food, hanging banners8 and canopies To the sacred objects symbolic of enlightened body, speech, and mind.

Pilgrimage to Nepal 353 These words turned toward the Dharma the minds of all-kings, ministers and subjects. By following my advice, they gained the good fortune of enjoying merit, power, longevity, descendants, luck and fame in this life, and of gradually achieving the unsurpassable attainment, Buddhahood. They offered me many gold and silver coins, coral and turquoise ornaments, and other pos-sessions. I reached the Hundred Springs of the land of Lo and I stayed there for a few days [305b], making a connection with this holy place, offering ganachakra feasts, and bathing in the waters. I saw fire burning on the water and fire burning on stones. On the way back I visited holy places and monasteries. In each village I benefited beings and gave the following teaching to the Abchenpa nomads and all the faithful men and women of Ngari Dzongkar: \"All of us have been born in the southern continent of Jambudvipa, supreme among the four continents, a place where birth is difficult to obtain. At this time, when we have a precious, free and gifted human existence, so difficult to gain, when we met the teachings of the Buddha and an authentic teacher, so difficult to meet, we must strive to do what is good. \"If, right now, we don't practice the sublime Dharma-the way to travel the far-reaching path-we won't obtain a free and gifted human existence again. Even if we were to obtain it, we might not meet the teachings of the Buddha. Even if we were to meet these teachings, who knows if we would have the freedom to practice the sublime Dharma? Now that we have a choice, we must give meaning to our freedoms and endowments. If we don't make efforts immedi-ately, but leave everything for tomorrow or the next day, simply feeling regret at the time of death will be useless. ''Why? Because all compounded phenom-ena are by nature impermanent. This body of flesh and blood is like a bubble in water; the universe and beings are in a perpetual cycle of change; our life, our breath may vanish as easily as mist on a mountain pass-we can't even have the least confidence that we will not die tonight"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"354 The Life ofShabkar [306a]. The causes for our death may flash at any moment like lightning. There is no way to avoid death, no way to run away. ''When death comes, even if our influence and strength have been equal to those of a uni-versal monarch, it won't help us a bit. Even if we had the riches and possessions ofVaishravana, 10 we won't have the power to take with us even so much as a sesame seed. Even if our father, our mother, many relatives, and friends surround us, we won't be able to take along a single one of them. We will go completely alone, like a hair pulled out of a pat of butter. \"Moreover, we will experience inconceiv-able, terrifying fears-the delusory appearances of the banJo. At that time, only the supreme Dharma and our guides-the spiritual master and the ThreeJewels-an be ofhelp. None of the people, wealth, and food of this life can give us an atom ofhelp. \"But that's not all. If, for the sake of food and clothing, or for our sons and daughters, we have committed serious negative actions, we will be reborn in the hells and experience unbearable sufferings, heat or cold. If we have committed negative actions of medium strength, we will suffer thirst and hunger when reborn among the tortured spirits. If we have committed negative actions of small magnitude only, we will experi-ence coundess torments when reborn among animals-obscured by stupidity we will be abused, enslaved, and finally slaughtered. \"After these experiences, we will eventually be freed from the three lower realms [306b], but even though we are then reborn in the human realm, if we are sinful, with impure karma, out of a hundred possible misfortunes-short life, con-stant sickness, death from poison or weapons, being blind, deaf, mute, crippled, enslaved, des-titute, or powerless-there's not a single one that we will not encounter. \"Having obtained a miserable existence, lacking even a single opportunity for happiness, the waters of sin, suffering, and defamation will rise; we will accumulate further bad karma and again be hurled like a stone to the bottom of the three lower realms, from whence one can hardly rise again. This is why it is said that one must give up unvirtuous actions. \"If we practice virtuous deeds perfecdy and extensively, in the best case we will achieve Bud-dhahood in this lifetime with this very body, and become able to set forth on the path of ripening and liberating all sentient beings who see, hear, touch, or remember us. \"If we practice virtuous deeds in a medium way, at the time of death our spiritual master and tutelary deities will come in reality to show us the path, enabling us to go to the Pure Buddhafield ofManifestJoy, to the Blissful Buddhafield, or to any other Pure Realm. \"If, in the last case, we have accomplished minor virtuous actions, we will again obtain a free, well-favored human birth and be born in a good family, with a good appearance, wealth, power, intelligence, longevity, health and happi-ness. Going, we will go on horseback; 11 sitting, we will sit on a carpet; eating, we will eat what-ever we like. Acting, we will have the freedom to practice the sublime Dharma [307a], and prac-ticing it joyfully we will eventually reach the level of no return, gaining the good fortune to beneflt sentient beings. This is why it is said that one must practice virtuous actions. \"If we have to give up nonvirtue for virtue, what are the unvirtuous actions to be aban-doned? They are those committed under the sway of obscuring emotions--desire, hatred, ignorance: taking the lives of many beings, each one of whom was once our parent, stealing the possessions of others, indulging in sexual miscon-duct, telling lies, slander, speaking harsh words, gossiping, feeling envy, fueling harmful thoughts and false views-in brief, whatever makes the lama and the ThreeJewels ashamed of us and causes harm to other sentient beings is a negative action that we must avoid. \"Even minor unvirtuous actions entail grave consequences. In the past, someone who told another, 'You are like a monkey,' was reborn five hundred times as a monkey. A novice monk who once told a fully ordained monk who had an unmelodious voice, 'You sing like a barking dog,' was reborn as a dog for five hundred lives."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"A woman who told other women, cy ou are like bitches!' was reborn as a bitch for five hundred lives. A monk who told a major lie12 to the All-seeing One, 13 thus losing his vows, was reborn for five hundred lives as a worm [307b]. \"In particular, the moment we merely con-ceive of killing a goat, a sheep or a wild animal, our life span, good fortune, and merit become exhausted and in a future rebirth we will our-selves be killed. If we have a hundred or a thou-sand similar thoughts, we will be killed that many times. If we actually kill, in this life we will have a short life filled with many illnesses; after we die we will be reborn in the ever-reviving hell where hundreds of thousands of times a day we will be killed by weapons, revived, and killed again and agam. \"If, under some false pretext, we take away others' possessions, in this life we will be stricken by leprosy or some other grave disease; in the next life we will go to a hell realm where our tongue, five hundred miles long, will be ploughed by a thousand ploughs of burning iron. If we speak wicked words to our parents, our tongues will be pierced from beneath the chin by an iron rod, an arm's length long, stuck in the ground. If we are fraudulent traders who cheat people by falsifying weights and measures, flesh will be cut from our bodies until it weighs on the scales the same as the amount we stole. \"Even a single burst of anger destroys the merit accumulated for a thousand kalpas and leads us after death to be reborn in a hell realm. Even if we are eventually reborn a human being, we will have an ugly complexion and be unat-tractive to all. \"Therefore, having pondered the evil con-sequences of negative actions-that to have done them is as harmful as having swallowed boiling, poisonous water [308a]-it is of utmost impor-tance to confess them remorsefully and make the firm promise that, even at the cost of our life, we shall never commit them again. \" Someone who has swallowed poison in the morning can be cured by good medicine in the afternoon, and even though we have committed sins in our early life, through confession we can Pilgrimage to Nepal 355 purifY them later in our life. Even we sinners will have the fortune to travel to the freedom of the higher realms. Therefore, I entreat you to belief and trust in confession and vows. \"Having given up negative actions, how are we to practice the positive ones-those moti-vated by loving-kindness, compassion and an enlightened attitude? ''We must familiarize ourselves with the Dharma, make offerings to the Three jewels, be generous, listen to the teachings, read the scrip-tures, keep them in mind, explain them to oth-ers, say prayers, and meditate earnestly. In brief, all that pleases the heart and mind of the spiritual masters and the Three Jewels, all that benefits others, is virtue. This is what we need to accom-plish. \"Even a small virtuous action brings great benefit. Once an old lady offered a single butter-lamp to the Buddha, who then made the predic-tion that in the future she would become a Buddha named 'Bright Lamp', 14 endowed with the ten powers. The Buddha also prophesied that a village chief who kept the vow of not killing for a single day, would ultimately become enlightened as the Buddha 'Beneficial Speech' [308b]. 15 A Brahmin girl offered her needle to a bhikshu; because of that she became the noble Shariputra. A woman offered a meal to a beg-gar; she was reborn in a mansion made of jewels, where she enjoyed delicious food with a hundred flavors. A pig who happened to make one circumambulation around a stupa because he was chased by a dog took rebirth as the house-holder Palkye, who attained the level of an arhat. So it is said. ''If we ransom the lives of animals and set them free, in all our lifetimes we will enjoy a long life free from illness. If we offer respect and bow down to our teacher and our parents, we will be reborn into a good family. If we cultivate patience, we will have a beautiful appearance in all our lives and will eventually obtain the major and minor marks of a supreme body.

There we will delight in joyous conversa-tions, and through our unimpeded miraculous power visit millions of pure and impure realms [309a]. We will make offerings to all the Bud-dhas and be able to bring there all sentient be-ings. Such will be our good fortune. Keep that in mind.\" Then I sang this song: Lord and master, Vajradhara, Dwell as an ornament on the crown of my head And bless all the fortunate men and women gathered here So that their minds may tum toward the Dharma. This yogin who roams throughout the land Sings this melodious song. All you who have good fortune, Listen well to my heart-advice. A human birth, free and well-favored, is hard to find. It is unlikely that you will obtain it again and again. Now that you have obtained it once, Don't return empty-handed, fortunate ones.

Like people gathered in a marketplace, One's family won't stay together for long; Soon they will pass on to the next life. For the present, maintain harmony among yourselves, fortunate ones. Your enemy was your parent in past lives. Even ifhe harms you a little in this one [309b], He must look forward to his own death as well; nothing endures, So don't nourish hatred, fortunate ones. When departing for the land of the next life, If the suffering of the three lower realms Falls upon you, it will be hard to bear. So give up unvirtuous actions, fortunate ones. If you can ascend to the supreme place of freedom of the higher realms, You will enjoy constant bliss and happiness. The divine Dharma is the best method for reaching there; Practice it, fortunate ones. Morning and evening, at all times, Take refuge in the Three Jewels-The infallible refuge. With a good heart, whatever you do will tum to Dharma: Develop an enlightened attitude, fortunate ones.

Having established all beings in Buddhahood, May I not remain at rest even then, But as long as absolute space remains, May I emanate infmite clouds of offerings, Pleasing all the Buddhas.

Having said this and thrown consecrated rice throughout the house, everyone in the house-holds of the two chief merchants rejoiced greatly and, filled with great faith, were most respectful. At that time I could not visit all the holy places of Nepal. Yet, in the vicinity of the two great stupas, I saw the ·image of the Great Com-passionate One called the Jowo Jamali in the royal city of Yambu.31 I also visited the Royal Pilgrimage to Nepal 365 Palace and had a look at the deer, horses, tigers, leopards, elephants, and rhinoceroses that were kept there. I stayed a month, doing prostrations and performing circumambulations around the two great stupas. Then I returned to K yirong, where I offered before the Wati Zangpo a lamp made out of thirty-four ounces of gold set with turquoise. I made a thousandfold offering and concluded with this prayer: 'just as this lamp is perfectly clean within and without, and made out of fme material, may I keep throughout all of my lives perfectly pure vows and samayas, and have a good mind filled with loving-kindness and an enlightened atti-tude.

I also made vast prayers of dedication for the sake of the Dharma and all beings. That year, I went to stay in retreat for a few months at the hermitage ofTsigpai Gon Nang, in Mang Yul near Kyirong-the abode of the miraculously manifested image of Arya Lokeshvara, Wati Zangpo. Located at the border between Tibet and Nepal, where different languages are spoken [320a], where milk products and crops are al-ways plentiful, where the snows do not melt in summer, and the flowers do not dry up in winter, Kyirong is a marketplace where all desirable things can be found. Near there, the translator Tsarni Lotsawa Sangye Trak33 once had a vision of Mahakala, who told him, \"Make your dwelling place over there on that big square rock.\" Thus, Drupkhang Tsigpai Gon Nang, \"the Meditation Hermitage Built at the Order of the Gonpo,\" was built where Mahakala had indicated. It is a solitary mountain dwelling conducive to practice. In back of it are massive rocks, and in front of it a mountain surrounded by a garland of snow peaks. In all directions, clouds of mist gather, passing beneath the arches of five-col-"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"ored rainbows. In that place are many different kinds of trees; their branches sway like offering goddesses swaying as they dance. There are many kinds of wild flowers that, like seductive maidens, display smiling faces. There are streams, murmuring, \"I am pure, pure; drink here, drink here.\" Juniper trees and wild rhododendrons fill the air with their fra-grance. Cuckoos, laughing-thrushes, and other sweet-voiced songbirds soar freely. Because the slope faces south, there is sun-light all day, even in winter. In summer and in spring it remains cool and one's awareness is clear. Water, firewood, and all one needs are here [320b).ln the lower parts of the valley live many wealthy benefactors. In this pleasant place, fllled with auspiciousness, with a vast open view, one feels naturally happy, lighthearted, serene and relaxed. It is a wondrous mountain wilder-ness, as though a celestial grove had been trans-ported to earth. I stayed there in retreat for several months and my meditation progressed more than in any other solitary place. One day, I sang this song in praise of the place: I bow down to the guru, Who in this sacred place Opened the door to hundreds of samadhis And saw wondrous visions. Bless me and others like me, To remain in mountain solitudes Where contemplation blossoms. Wondrous! Behind are mountain rocks, Solid and beautifuL Snow ornaments the summits Of the amazing mountains in front. In all directions mist gathers and rainbows appear. In this wondrous sacred place, The very sounds of rivulets seem to say, \"Swiftly, quickly, like this goes the life of man-Practice meditation without interruption!\" Pilgrimage to Nepal 367 flowing on continuously, day and night, Sweetly murmuring, they seem to say, ''When you meditate upon the yidam deity This is how you should recite The void sound of mantras.\" The trees, when their branches wave In all directions, seem to say, \"Come to the mountain You fortunate ones with good karma.\" When the branches are still, they seem to say, ''When meditating, remain still in one place as we do.\" The many flowers demonstrate to all [32la), \"This is how your meditation experiences should bloom.\" And when autumn comes, the flowers show their transience, To remind one of impermanence and death. Like a fan that waves back and forth, The cool breeze tempers the ardor of the sun; The fresh winds as well bring many fragrances. ''You, hermit, have no incense.'' Without fiXation, the wind goes its way. \"Like me, have no attachment to anything.\" Surrounding me closely, Singing sweetly, Birds, large and small, Dispel my loneliness, as if saying, ''You don't need to hoard; Food and drink are easy to fmd.\" And, flying on from treetop to treetop, they say, ''To eat whatever comes your way Is the source ofhappiness."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"368 The Lift of Shahkar Without clinging to anything, Go on your way.\" A variety of flowers In the full bloom of their youth Sway like seductive maidens.

The bees' wings thrum And seem to say, \"When staying in solitude, Sing like this.\" To an intricate melody, they say, ''Wondrous is the yogin who dwells in sacred places.\" Having circled around me many times They touch my robe for blessing, And flying off without a backward glance, say, \"Do not be fascinated Even by those who seem the most desirable of all.\" Marvelous! In this sublime, secluded place of retreat, Whatever appears points out the teachings. Like a celestial forest brought to earth, The wilderness shelters all kinds of natural beauty. In this remote and wondrous forest [32lb], Outside, the nurturing sun: My illusory body is content. Within, primordial clarity: My mind is content. In between, I sing songs: My voice is content. If he found out about the complete contentment Of my body, speech, and mind, Even the king of Nepal himself Might feel envious and restless-Let alone anyone else! \"Practitioners who roam the villages Instead of staying in such a retreat place--What are you doing?\" This I proclaim everywhere. May fortunate beings with good karma understand! Thus, one day I spontaneously sang this song. Another day, at that pleasant retreat, I was walk-ing alone on the mountainside to refresh mysel£ These thoughts arose in my mind, \"I am old, my hair has turned white. Now, on the eve of death, it's no good to move around too much, it's better to stay in mountain retreats. Stricken by years, even if I feel like going, I can't get around much. It's almost certain that I won't meet again most of my disciples and benefactors, who live far away.\" Reflecting on joining and parting, birth and death, and all the miseries of samsara, I felt sad and sang this melancholy song: Essence of all the Buddhas, Source of the eighty thousand sections of the Dharma, Sole ornament of the supreme assembly of theSangha-Most kind root lama, think of me. Enduring the drought of the three months of summer, The crops seem inconsolable. Turquoise thunder-dragon, Come with your refreshing rain To console the sadness of the fields [322a].

But, even though it is so very beautiful, When the cold, strong winds sweep through, The rainbow will have to go. For as long as a blossom is sustained By sunlight and by moisture Its appearance is very beautiful. But even though it is so very beautiful, When the frosts of autumn come The blossom will have to go. For as long as this transitory body is sustained By clothing and by nourishment, Its appearance is very beautiful. But even though it is so very beautiful, When the Demon Lord of Death arrives, This body will have to go. Omens of danger to the lives of fish, The nets are set along the coast; Don't go to feed at the ocean's edge, But stay out at sea, in the deep!

The wind was pleasant and refreshing, filling my mind and body with well-being. I said to the wind-god: Ema! Wind-god-you go from place to place, Not clinging to anything-wondrous!

Mountain streams cascade: splashing, murmunng. The branches of the many trees are moving, Just as if dancing; sweet birds are singing out Sweet melodies; new buds present their smiling faces [323b].

Disciples and patrons, rejoice at this song Expressing the yogin's happiness. When I finished, everyone rejoiced. One day, during my stay at that excellent place, I gave the following teaching for the benefit of some fortunate disciples, including my close spiri-tual sons Kunga Lekpa, Kalzang Trinley, Pilgrimage to Nepal 371 Kalzang Dondrup, Lobzang Sherap, Lobzang Tsultrim, andJamyang Rangdrol: \"All of you, fortunate sons and daughters, listen without distraction and keep this well in mind: \"Time out of mind we have taken countless rebirths in samsara, particularly in the lower realms [324a]-more times than the number of hairs on the body of a black animal. Now that we have, for once, obtained a precious human birth, free and well-favored, it is like one single white hair on that beast's forehead, amidst all of the black ones. If, this time, we fail to take advantage of this human birth, and fail to prepare the ground for lasting happiness by practicing the Dharma properly, it will be exceedingly difficult to come upon such an existence again. As it is said in Engaging in the Bodhisattva's Activi!J: A free, well-favored human birth Is extremely hard to fmd. How can those who do nothing To give their lives real meaning Encounter such favorable conditions ever . ? agam. \"However you may reflect on these words, using metaphors or numerical comparisons, human existence is something very hard to obtain. Not only is it rare, but it can be made truly meaningful as well by using it to practice Dharma-to reach the highest realms and ulti-mate excellence. \"Think about this, and, without clinging to society, wealth, food, and other things of this life, persevere solely in practicing the sublime Dharma. At death, the best practitioner will be joyful, the medium one will be free from fear, and the worst one will have no regrets-so it is said. Even if, when you die, you are neither joyful nor free from fear, at the very least you should have no regrets. Otherwise, can you endure. not having repaid your kind parents for having fostered you?

No one escapes these. Most important of all, on the very day of our birth we begin traveling on the road towards death. It is said in the Prior Lives of the Buddha:35 'From the very evening of entering our mother's womb, we set out on the path of this world, a path that leads us directly into the presence of the Lord of Death.' \"Our life is shorter than a sheep's tail; our plans for the future longer than a horse's tail. There is no certainty as to when the Lord of Death will tum up; we don't know whether dawn or death will come first. Therefore, being aware of death, make only short-term plans and abandon, one after another, all the activities of this life. \"Alas! Who knows if I will still be alive another year, another month, another day? I am not even sure that I won't die tonight. What is the point of thinking of things to be done next year, next month, tomorrow? Right now I must practice the Dharma to ensure a happy frame of mind at the time of death!' It is essential always to think in this way, and cut short all speculation about the future. \"After death, those who have acted posi-tively will be reborn in the higher realms of freedom and enjoy happiness. Those who have committed negative acts will be reborn in one of the three lower realms and enjoy suffering. For example, if one sows the seed of a sweet plant, one will harvest sweet fiuit; if one sows the seed of a bitter plant, the harvest will be bitter-there is nothing more true than the karmic law of cause and effect [325a]. \"Yet nowadays there are people who claim, 'To be too meticulous about the law of cause and effect is the way of the Hinayana-the Sravakas and the Pratyekabuddhas. We who have real-ized the view of the Mahayana have no need to be so punctilious about the laws of karmic cause and effect.' For them it is said, 'Erring too much on the side of emptiness is the downfall of those with weak intellects.' \"It is vital not to lean to the side of those who declare, 'The practice of the Mahayana over-rides the Hinayana,' and not to become like them. The Great Master Padmasambhava said: One's view may be higher than the sky, But attention to one's actions and their results Must be even fmer than barley flour. I am the Lotus-born Guru, I hold the instructions that differentiate In accord with the laws of cause and effect. \"Similarly, the precious Physician of Dagpo36 said, 'Even if your view is higher than the sky, it is vital that your behavior regarding cause and effect be fmer than barley flour.' \"If, as a result of your negative actions, you are reborn in one of the three lower realms, needless to say, you will suffer. Even if you have given up the ten nonvirtuous actions, and through the power of small virtues you are born in the higher realms as a human being, you will endure the sufferings ofbirth, old age, sickness and death, of having what you do not want and of not having what you want, of separation and gather-ing,37 of having more power or less power, of being beaten, and so forth. Likewise, if you are born as demigod you will suffer from constant fighting; if you are born a god you will suffer from the change and fall that go with death38-there are inconceivable sufferings! \"The Supreme Dharma of Intent Minr!folnesS39 states, 'In samsara there is no place in which there is happiness-no place even as small as the tip of a needle.' Thus, once you are born in samsara, you will only reap suffering; you will not fmd one single instant of true happiness [325b]. Look, therefore, at the )oys of samsara' and the 'perfections of this life' as a jaundiced person looks at food, or a son regards his father's murderer. Have revulsion toward them; aban-don them, utterly. \"Consider the qualities of liberation and omniscience, and long for them as a thirsty per-son longs for water; desire them ardently, like a lustful man who sees a beautiful woman. Con-stantly keep the feeling in your heart that you must achieve these qualities at any cost."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"\"Eh, all of you! There is no chance that you can free yourselves from samsara and achieve Buddhahood relying only on your own strength: you require help. In ordinary life, someone with few resources must rely on more powerful people; likewise, you must rely on a spiritual master and the Threejewels. If you do so, they will protect you from the terrors of samsara, especially those of the three lower reahns, and certainly establish you in liberation and omniscience. Therefore, take refuge and rely on them with all your heart. \"Generating the aspiration for enlighten-ment is the seed for Buddhahood; therefore, engendering total love and compassion, develop the intention and application ofBodhicitta.

Entailing little difficulty and possessing real meaning, mandala offerings are the best way to perfect the two accumulations. 'Without purifYing obscurations one cannot achieve Buddhahood; therefore correcdy practice the meditation and recitation ofVajrasattva [326a]. Like a stream, it will cleanse all your negative acts, faults, downfalls, and obscurations. 'Without receiving the guru's blessing, one cannot achieve Buddhahood; therefore, practice Guru Yoga, praying from the very core of your heart. This is a vital point. \"These days some people say, 'There is no need to expend great effort on the preliminary practices. What's the point of so much complica--tion? It's enough just to practice Mahamudra, devoid of all elaborations.' But this is like saying, 'Though I can't chew butter, I shall chew stones.' Don't listen to such nonsense. How can some-one who hasn't even reached the shore talk about the sea?40 ''It is said, 'If the preliminary practice is profound, the main practice will be profound.' It is absolutely necessary to develop the inner expe-riences and realization related to these prelimi-naries, if you have not yet done so. If you have developed them already, you must develop them further, without letting them deteriorate. This is something important at all stages of practice. \"You must then receive a ripening empow-erment for any deity of the Secret Mantrayana-Pilgrimage to Nepal 373 this is the swiftest way to become enlightened. Mter that, you must keep pure samayas and vows according to the promises you made when receiving the empowerment. \"Following this, you must familiarize your-self with the path of development and comple-tion stages as much as you can. Above all, for a long time, you must practice the ultimate comple-tion stage: remaining in evenness in the con-tinuum of the nature of mind-void, luminous, free of fiXation; all-pervading, open, vast, simple, like the sky. 'When practicing the Dharma you must give up all concern for the affairs of this life. Keep to the lowest position, wear worn-out cloth-ing: give no importance to food, talk, or clothes. Be always a child of the mountains: wear mist as a robe, a rocky cave as a cap. Even if trees fall from the right, boulders roll down from the left [326b], the sky collapses on you from above, or the earth quakes under you, you must maintain the firm determination to remain unwavering, like a stake driven into the ground. \"You also must have fervent devotion toward your spiritual master, love for your vajra broth-ers and sisters, compassion for all beings, and pure perception towards all teachings. Place all beings above yourself, particularly those who have crossed the threshold ofDharma, and more especially those companions with whom you have received teachings.

At night, if there were comfort-able beds he would have his companions sleep on them; if there was a cold place he would be the one to take it.

When people tell us a mixture of pleasant and unpleasant things, we can't bear a single harsh word. If we own possessions in conunon with others, we cannot bear our share to be less, even by a hundred grams.42 \"Practitioners like this are fine only while they are just sitting around talking, but whenever they actually encounter difficult circumstances they behave even worse than ordinary people. \"To avert this, keep to the humblest posi-tion, as explained above; take a vow to consider everyone before yourself, and put this vow into practice at all times. \"It is very important to dedicate all the vir-tuous actions you have done in accord with the Dharma for the benefit of others, and for their attainment of unsurpassable enlightenment.

If you come there, you, too, will be happy.\" Deceiving them in this way, he went and came back several times with a number of poor children, and sold thirteen of them as slaves to some local Monpas. He made their lives miser-able, while he lived on the earnings ofhis trade. When I arrived, one of the boys the man had kidnapped, knowing that he was about to be sold into slavery, ran away to my place; he was soon followed by the man himself. I gave the man many silver coins, reminding him that it was improper to sell human beings and that he would certainly be punished if the Palace of Ganden64 heard about it. I taught him some Dharma, explaining to him that, behaving in this way, in his next life he would be reborn in the lower realms. Feeling remorse for his mis-deeds, he confessed and offered a promise never to deal in slaves again. All the kindhearted people of Kyirong rejoiced and expressed their grati-tude. That year, at the time when all the people of that area hold many ganachakra feast offerings and joyful gatherings, a group of young men and women sang this praise of Gyalwa Rinpoche:65 On the top of the Po tala The full moon rises-Oh! It's not the moon, It's the face of the Victorious One! On the top of the Po tala A golden flute resounds-Oh! It's not a golden flute It's the melodious voice of the Victorious One! Whoever sees the face of the Victorious One Will not be born in the lower realms. Whoever once hears the voice of the Victorious One Will obtain a human existence in his next life [339b]. They sang this and many other songs, danced, and exclaimed, \"May auspiciousness prevail! May prosperity reign!\" After Jetsun Chokyi W angchuk had cut their hair,66 a few nuns performed an auspicious sacred dance, which he himself had created: Let's sing this auspicious song Of total, consummate auspiciousness, Glowing with auspicious virtue Like an auspicious waxing moon!

Many others sang, danced, and played all sorts of music for the pleasure of the men and women gathered there. Then, a few of us, master and disciples, went to visit K yirong Sam ten Ling, the seat of Yongdzin Rinpoche.67 There I offered a general distribution of tea and money, and received from the abbot, Chozang Rinpoche, the transmission for the cycle of teachings on the Great Compas-sionate One.68 We stayed there a few days and were welcomed with great hospitality by the treasurer."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"We then proceeded to Riwo Pelbar, the Glorious Blazing Mountain, where Jetsun Milarepa once meditated.

Then we went to Ragma Changchup Dzong, the En-lightenment Fort of Ragma, and to Kyangpen Namkha Dzong, the Sky Citadel of Kyangpen (340a], establishing connections with these two holy places.

After this, I crossed the pass of Gungthang and stayed a day at a small village monastery called Chamangpo, \"Many Birds\" (340b],81 where I was received hospitably. Following this, the treasurer Wangpo and a few ofhis people left for central Tibet through the Pongrong Valley of the glorious Gungthang Plain, while I and the Pilgrimage to Nepal 389 others stayed at Chamangpo, teaching the Dharma and singing spiritual songs.

This refers to the story of the poultry woman Shamvara who built the stupa ofjarung Kashor (bya rung kha shor), the present Bodhnath. When she was dying, she enjoined the four sons she had by four different fathers to complete her work. By the merit of her deeds, she attained Buddhahood and mani-fested as the protectress Pramoha Devi. At the completion of the work, each of those who contributed to it made an aspiration-prayer. In accordance with their vows, the first son became the Abbot, Shantarakshita, the second one became the Master, Guru Padmasambhava, the third one became the Dharma King Trisong Detsen, and the fourth one became the wise minister Barni Trihzi (zhang blon rba mi krhi gzigs), a Buddhist minister of King Trisong Detsen. The ox who had carried earth and stones did not know how to pray and, feeling that his hard work had been forgotten, made the perverse wish to harm the work of the four sons. He became King Lang-dharma, who attempted to eradicate Buddhism from Tibet, but failed to do so; he was eventually assassi-nated by Lhalung Palkyi Dmje, himself the rebirth of a crow who had heard the ox make his wicked vow, and had made a wish to be reborn as a Bodhisattva who would assassinate the apostate king. The text of the history of the Jarung Khashor (mchod rten chen po bya rung kha shor gyi lo rgyus thos pas grol ba) is a terma revealed at Samye around the eleventh century by Lhatsun Ngonmo (lha btsun sngon mo), who hid it again because the time for its dissemination was not ripe. It was rediscovered again (yanggter) probably in 1512 (see GC, vol. 3, p. 50) by Ngakchang Sakya Zangpo (sngags 'chang shalga bzang po), who wrote it in its present form. See K. Dowman, 1he Legend of the GreatStupa(1973) and Franz-Karl Ehrhard (1990 and 1991). Keith Dowman communicated to us the follow-ing summary of the conventional history of the Great Stupa: \"Both Newari and Tibetan legend place the foundation of the Great Stupa ofBodhnath in antiq-uity. The Newars believe that the Licchavi king Manadeva (died A.D. 505) built the original stupa as a reliquary for his father, King Vrsadeva, after he had unwittingly killed him. The Tibetan legend implies only that the stupa was built before Trisong Detsen invited Guru Padmasambhava to Tibet in the eighth century. A thirteenth-century Tibetan biography of Padmasambhava (Padma bka' thang shel brag ma) pro-vides the first literary reference to the stupa and"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"establishes the earliest Tibetan connection with it. There is no further substantial information concern-ing Bodhnath until the early sixteenth century, when Shakya Zangpo, a Nyingrnapa yogin from Kham, had a vision at Samye, in central Tibet, that induced him to travel to Bodhnath to restore the stupa. How-ever, upon arrival, he had difficulty in identifying the mound of earth that once had been the stupa. Hav-ing found the right location, Shakya Zangpo un-earthed the stupa and restored it. It is Shakya Zangpo's sixteenth-century reconstruction that is still extant, although its form has been modified. Shakya Zangpo established a line of incarnate lamas in Y olmo (Helambu) who wc:;re the caretaker abbots of the stupa. Thereafter the community of Buddhist Tamangs thrived around the stupa, which also be-came the principal destination for Tibetan pilgrims outside Tibet. In 1855 the abbacy ofBodhnath was given to a Chinese pilgrim, a Nyingrna yogin, who gave service as interpreter to Jung Bahadur during the peace talks following the Nepali-Chinese war. Under the second and third Chini Lamas, who also were the Dalai Lama's consuls in Nepal, the abbacy ofBodhnath extended both its spiritual and temporal power. Since the death in 1982 of the last traditional abbot of Bodhnath, the third Chini Lama, much of the spiritual authority has devolved upon the Tibetan lamas who have built monasteries in the vicinity of the stupa.\" 29.

There many learned and accomplished sages have raised the victory banner of practice and turned the wheel of the Dharma ofRealization.4 I decided to go there to practice. Accompa-nied by many disciples, I frrst came to Betse Doyon Dzong, where we stopped for the night. The next day, on the way, we met some pilgrims who told us that the protector and Dharma King ofTibet, Demo Rinpoche, one of my root teach-ers whom I treasured like a jewel ornament on my head, had discarded the flower ofhis body.5 An unfathomable sadness welled up again and again in my mind, and I sang this song of yearn-ing, calling for his swift rebirth [342b]: Kyehu! Incarnation of the Victorious Ones, you have gone. Gem fulfilling all beings' wishes, You adorned the diadem of the teachings. Unique, inconceivable ornament of this uruverse, Because of our extreme lack of merit, As beings of this decadent age, You vanished suddenly, like a rainbow in the sky. 395 Master of Tibet, spiritual sovereign, Sun with a thousand rays of compassion, Now you have set; Like the earth helplessly shrouded in darkness, Your disciples are stunned by grief. Though a torrent of tears washes over our faces, The stain of grief will never leave our minds. Though our fists beat on the drums of our chests, We will never awaken from this sleep of despair. You who were to lead us to Buddhahood at death, Our guide and master, have now gone on before us. Blinded by ignorance, We are all left behind, unfortunate. Kye hu! What can be done?

Hearing that the abbot of this monastery was Khenpo Kalzang Khedrup Rinpoche, a teacher who combined knowledge, virtue and excellence, I sent ahead this letter: Sublime spiritual guide, Holder of the banner of the teachings Of the diadem of gods and men, the Buddha, You found the sky treasure of knowledge and realization.

Far away from the cities of distraction, this abode of rishis and celestial beings, this dancing place of the mother dakinis, lies beneath slate mountains and glaciers ever wrapped in clouds and mist. 9 I did prostrations and offerings to the dei-ties, the dakinis, and dharmapalas who delight in virtue, and I sang this song of praise: I bow down, make offerings, sing praises, and pray To the gurus,yidam deities, and dakinis [344a]: May you grant blessings and realization To all beings who stay in this place. Universally renowned, truly wondrous, The Lapchi snow range is the dwelling place Of the forefathers of the practice lineage, Who turned the wheel of the Dharma of Realization. The mountain summits are crowned with snow, Their waists girdled by belts of silver mist. Snow-melt streams appear beneath glaciers; From high, rocky cliffs, water cascades down. On lush green mountain meadows Blanketed with wild flowers, Beautiful wild animals gambol, completely at ease. Bees gather and sing their songs On the fragrant corollas of many-colored blossoms.

Following my stay in this holy place, all my wandering thoughts, coarse and subtle, subsided by themselves, naturally giving way to the vast, boundless state that is primordial wakefulness completely free of discursive thoughts, and em-bellished by clarity, bliss, and emptiness. One wintry afternoon when I was perform-ing a ganachakra feast, I saw this: in front ofl.a.pchi Mountain, in the middle of the sky, were two white clouds. Between them a rainbow arose, broad as a highway, such as I had never seen before. Its far end led into another cloud, toward the Tonting Gyalmo, the Azure Queen Moun-tain; 11 on the path of the rainbow many deities moved back and forth. That scene lasted for a longtime. From then onwards, in dreams, in medita-tion experiences, and in reality, I met the Five Sisters of Long Life, the protectors of Tibet, many times, and I was able to accomplish which-ever of the four activities I needed. In particular, when I offered a coating of gold to the stupa of Bodhnath in Nepal, I solicited their help, and my aims were accomplished easily and without hin-drance [345a]. In this holy place, whenever I offered a ganachakra, wondrous rainbow-colored clouds would appear, seen by all. I thought that these were signs that, pleased, the Five Sisters of Long Life were coming time and again. At that time I thought of going to pay hom-age to the Diamond Throne oflndia, Bodhgaya. I mentioned this to my disciples, who said, ''If you go, we will all go with you.\" Having offered a ganachakra feast to the dei-ties of the Three Roots and recited all the related prayers, just before dawn the next day, in a state that was half dream, half vision, the Tiger-faced Dakini appeared to me. She said: \"If you go to India, many lives will be endangered. If you stay in Tibet to help beings, you will bring great benefit to the Buddhist teachings and to beings. We dakinis will always accompany you like your shadow; we will never fail you.\"· Having spoken thus, she vanished. Following her advice, I did not go to India. Soon after that, one night I dreamed that I.a.pchi had become a vast, open plain. There came a multitude ofTibetans, Nepalese, Monpas, Indian acharyas, and people of many other races, all speaking different languages. They filled the whole plain, which became like a busy metropo-lis with people moving back and forth. I saw this as a sign that, in the following years, many people would come and gather there. The next year, on a late summer day, I went to the plain below the Cave of the Subjugation of Mara.12 Where the plain meets the hill [345b] was a tree with fully developed foliage and branches facing upwards, divided into two crowns. I asked the monks who were with me to build a throne of stones at the foot of the tree. Then I told them, \"In future I must teach the Dharma from this throne,\" and to create an auspicious connection, sitting upon it, I expounded the Dharma to the treasurer Kalzang Trinley and a few other attendants, quoting these and other scriptural passages: and: Doing no harm whatsoever, Practice virtue perfectly, Tame your mind completely: This is the teaching of the Buddha. Good health is the supreme comfort, Giving joy is the supreme gift, Nirvana is the supreme bliss, One who is constant is the supreme friend. They all were very pleased. At the Cave of the Subjugation ofMara, in order to enter the actual cave where Jetsun Milarepa stayed one had to crawl through a small en-trance at the back of a temple. I thought, \"At the"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"time of Jetsun Mila there must have been an-other, easier, access.\" Mter a search, I found an entrance right in front, at the foot of the cave. As we were clearing away fallen rocks and earth, I discovered the remnants of Milarepa's stone hearth. When this occurred, strong faith increased in all those assembled there. The news spread that the door to the holy site had been reopened.13 I stayed in the cave. At the beginning of summer, just as I had dreamed earlier, one after another, many worthy and fortunate disciples [346a] came there from all directions, and I turned the Wheel of the Dharma for them under that tree. In the Cave of the Subjugation ofMara I lit a wick as thick as my forearm in a huge lamp that was like an ocean of melted butter. This butter-lamp burned day and night, warming the whole cave. At this time I sent a letter to Khenchen Yon ten Lhundrup Rinpoche ofChubar, a master filled with loving-kindness and compassion whose wisdom eyes were wide open. Accompanying my request for his spiritual protection with some offerings, I wrote: Diadem of all gods and men; Foremost among learned, virtuous and noble-minded beings, Amidst the holders of the teaching, You stand aloft like the pinnacle of a victory banner. In front of you, great abbot, supreme spiritual guide, I present these words, with the unfeigned respect of my body, speech, and mind I, the yogin who, like the wind, never settles anywhere, Roam at random through secluded groves and mountain retreats, Traveling without preference throughout all countries.

Most of the shrines of this holy place, which sheltered precious relics and symbols of the enlightened body, speech and mind, were dam-aged or had fallen into ruins. The monks of Lapchi were unable to repair them. I could not bear to see to see this, and the pure intention arose to do something beneficial for the Dharma and for all beings. Accordingly, in the upper part of the valley, I built shelters at the feet of the glaciers; in the lower part I made bridges over the streams; and in between, I restored the damaged temples. In the center of the plain where the monas-tic community dwelt, 16 I built an assembly hall surrounded by an outer, enclosing wall, and many new cells for the monks. I set up a golden pin-nacle on the roof of the temple. Inside, using thirteen dotse of silver, I fitted the temple with all the ritual objects for performing offerings. I also gave new ordination to those monks who had strayed into being householders. Mter completing all this, I sent the following letter to the hierarchs of Drigung, Father and Son, 17 under the authority of whom this holy site and its monasteries were placed [349a]: Supreme pair of great emanations, Like the sun and moon rising together You manifested as spiritual guides who ceaselessly help beings.

In order swiftly to attai.\"'l Buddhahood For the sake ofleading all beings, your mothers, to that level, Practice the six paramitas With a mind filled with love, compassion, and Bodhicitta.

Meditation at Lapchi 405 Since the Secret Mantrayana, the direct path, Is the swift means to attain supreme Buddhahood, Practice the paths of development, completion, and Great Perfection, And you will become a Buddha in one lifetime: This is certain. When practicing in this way, Rely upon secluded forest groves [351 b]. Emptying your mind of preoccupation With this life and the eight worldly concerns, Treasure a solitary life of practice. By the merit of these words, May all beings, our mothers, quickly attain Buddhahood, May goodness prevail in this place And pervade the entire universe. This song helped many faithful disciples. The men and women of Drin Chubar,19 and most of the wealthy householders of Nyanang, were well-known for being miserly people who never made offerings or gave in charity. In addition, every year they killed scores of goats, sheep, and yaks. In brief, they per-formed many evil actions. By teaching them the Dharma, I was able to interrupt the stream of their evil deeds and, finally, gave them this advice: Precious and supreme gurus: Like galaxies of stars, Wreathe and diadem my head. Under the protection of the unfailing Three Jewels, I sing whatever comes into my rnilld. We now have a human birth, free and well-favored: A unique opportunity which will not occur time and again-Thus the Buddha has said."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"406 Th Life of Shabkar We are always facing death.

You rich misers, even if in this life You cannot bear giving alms, At least don't ready yourselves For the depths of hell in your next lives, Continuing to slaughter goats, sheep, and yaks year after year.

They seem to be saying, \"This is how your parents reared you when you were small.\" Seeing this, I remember the kindness of my parents, And feel a strong wish to repay their kindness.

Seeing this, I remember relative truth And feel a strong wish to train in the great activity of the Bodhisattvas. The immense, wide-open sky above, Empty of alllimitations-\"This is emptiness-naked and clear, free of all veils and obscurations.\" Seeing this, I remember absolute truth And feel a strong wish to practice according to the profound view.

Seeing this, I think about benefiting everyone impartially; I feel a strong wish to serve the teachings and all beings. Singing. various songs, I refreshed myself, walk-ing through forests thick with foliage, flowers, and fruits, under cool archways of bamboo, Meditation at Lapchi 407 thoughts ofjoy and thoughts of sadness alternat-ing in my mind [353a]. At one point some silver and gold came into my hands. I remembered how, in the past, the poul-try woman Shamvara, assisted by her four sons, built the stupa of Bodhnath and placed in its central axis20 a measureful ofBuddha Kashyapa's relics. According to the prayers they made, 21 the poultry woman attained Buddhahood as the oath-bound deity, Pramoha Devi, and the four sons became, respectively, the Abbot, the Master, the Dharma King, and the Minister, who spread the teachings of the Buddha far and wide in Tibet. Reflecting upon their story and the benefits of their deeds, I thought it would be such good fortune if, for the welfare of the teachings and all beings, I could offer a coating of pure gold to the thirteen top rings of the Great Stupa. With this in mind, I sent the following letter to the Gorkha king of Nepal: \"Great lord, Dharma King, like the sun you tower above all beings. With immense respect and countless prostrations I, the yogin hermit Shabkarpa, who now dwell in the highlands of Lapchi Snow Range, the holy place of the speech of Chakrasamvara at the border between the excellent land of Nepal, gathering place of all desirable perfections, and the Snow Land of Tibet, source of all benefit and bliss, present this humble petition before your jeweled throne raised by fearless lions: \"Great king, you are like the wish-fulfilling gem adorning the pinnacle of the unshakable victory banner; you are like a diadem for [353b] the heads of all vassal kings and ministers; you display outstanding kindness to all your subjects and to all countries. \"By the compassion of my gurus and the Threejewels, the illusory body of your humble servant is well.

It would be magnificent if, for the sake of the Dharma and sentient beings, a covering of gold laid on copper, similar to that of the Svayambhu stupa, could be offered to the top of the stupa of Bodhnath. \"This Great Stupa ofBodhnath, the unique adornment of this world, and the most eminent object of offering and praise, benefits all those who make a connection with it and, as a wish-fulfilling gem, grants all the aspirations of who-ever prays to it-the white flag of its melodious name flutters in all directions, its fame increasing day by day. \"Therefore, with a perfectly pure mind, thinking solely to serve the Dharma and all beings, and in particular to make a new sun ofhappiness shine over all the inhabitants of Nepal and Tibet [354a], I have conceived the wish to offer to the thirteen Dharma wheels22 at the summit of the Great Stupa of Bodhnath a perfect garment of precious gold laid on copper, which will radiate rays of splendor and beauty in a hundred direc-tions. \"When, next year, the precious chance to do this arises, I request that you, great Dharma King and lord, and your ministers, all true Bodhisattvas, be pleased to grant your permis-sion, delightful to hear, to realize this aim.

Following this, the great king, having consulted with Colonel Bhimsen23 and the other royal ministers, granted permission to undertake the work, and said that they would offer their assistance [354b] . While I was staying in Lapchi, my disciple Kunzang Shenphen, someone gifted with faith, diligence and intelligence who had been living alone in the mountains, said to himself, \"How-ever much I try, I cannot rid my mind of craving for the comforts of this life. If a Dharma com-panion takes away a tiny object, a piece of cloth or a morsel of food, that poisonous old corpse of attachment and anger tries to get up on its feet again. Isn't this proof that I've missed some cru-cial point of the teachings? I must go and ask my lama.\" In this frame of mind, he came to me and expressed his doubts in a song: Lord Shabkar, king of all renunciates, Attachment and greed have ceased to exist in your mind. Tum for an instant your tenderness toward me--A disciple scorched by the desires of this life and a c~ving for comfort. Protector, for long you have regarded The glories of samsara as a nest of vipers.

Although this way of talking seems impressive, If someone takes away anything of ours, food or clothing, We grow red-faced with fury, Abuse spews forth from our mouths; We are fully prepared to beat that person with a club. All of us, your followers, Have little hope soon to be able [355a] To cast away concerns for this life as you have; Still we hope that, through the guru's compass10n, It may happen one day. We ask that you impart to us some profound instructions That will clearly teach the crucial points About banishing from our minds all worldly concerns. Through practicing according to your instructions, May we swiftly banish preoccupation with this life's concerns. I replied: \"Listen!

Therefore, worthy son, from now on, Keep in mind impermanence and death Throughout the six periods of the day and night. While recollecting impermanence and death, You should especially remember that they may come at any time. You have no assurance that, tomorrow, you will still be alive; Think, \"What is the point of making plans for the day after?\" And rid your mind of the thoughts of this life. Today's sun has already set; Tonight you may die. Think, \"What's the use of planning for tomorrow?\" And rid your mind of the thoughts of this life.

May whoever hears these words, Banish all concern for this life [356a]. These words hit home to all present; they real-ized the truth of what I had said. Later, by bearing constantly in mind the imminence of death, a complete absence of wants and needs became their natural frame of mind. Many of them, men and women, became practitioners who renounced all activities and preoccupations pertaining to this life. One day, Gelong Yeshe Nyentrak, a devout, pure-minded, generous and diligent practitio-ner, offered me a silver and gold mandala with a top ornament and, with the following verses, requested some spiritual advice: I bow down to you who perfected the twofold gathering (Tsog), 25 Lord of the Four Kayas, no different from the Sixth (Druk) Conqueror, Vajradhara.

In the past, you've given me many profound and vast instructions, Still, I could not rid myself of my wicked defects. Eager to cast them away now, I beseech you for spiritual advice. I answered, \"Listen! All defects come from not having let go of concern for the affairs of this life, so--let go!\" I gave him this advice on how to abandon all worldly affairs-preoccupation with society, wealth and food-and how to detach his mind from the things of this life: I bow down at the feet of the guru, the Lord of Dharma, Grant your blessings that I may be able to follow the Dharma!

Heart-disciple, holder of the sacred bond, You who wish from your heart to practice the sacred Dharma, listen: One's homeland is the source of attachment and anger; Leave your native place far behind.

The greatest trouble can come from women; Don't ever get too intimate with one.26 Wanting and attachment are the roots of samsara; Curb your longing for food and clothes. Miserliness will make you take rebirth among hungry ghosts; Do not be miserly with your wealth. Hatred is the seed of hell; Do not allow aggression to arise. Proliferating thoughts are Mara at work; Preserve wisdom that is beyond the workings of mind. Compassion is the essence of Dharma; Cultivate it eagerly. If you do so, you will be happy, And ultimately you will reach Buddhahood. On hearing these words, he effortlessly rid him-self of all his mental sufferings, shortcomings, and physical sickness, and enjoyed unceasing happiness of body and mind. Later he became an authentic renunciate and achieved excellent meditative experiences and realization-in short, he became an exemplary Dharma practitioner able to benefit others. On another occasion, one of my close heart-sons, Phugtra Khenpo, a fortunate being endowed with knowledge and realization [357a],27 offered me some gold and silver along with all his other possessions, and asked, \"Have you been in good health?

Even when you have a chance to strike back, Don't do it! Practice compassion. Even when others shower you with abuse, Don't abuse them in return. Don't bring up others' weak points, taunting them, Saying \"Hey, you! One-eye!\" or \"Ha, ha! You lost your vows!\" Even when you know that others have done wrong and are paying for it, Don't rub their noses in it, saying, \"Serves you right!\" When blame falls on you, Don't try to shift it onto someone else. About an enemy or anyone you don't like, Don't think, \"I wish he were dead!\" Always praise good qualities you see in others, Be they enemies, friends, or strangers.

I, Shabkarpa, free from all aims and expectations, At ease and with a cheerful mind [362a], Sing this song on emptiness and compassion. Gelong Y eshe, listen without distraction. All the phenomena of samsara and niivana, What appears and what exists, Are no more than rainbows in an empty sky, Which appear through a conjunction of causes and conditions. No matter how they may appear, they are nothing in themselves; They arise as embellishing ornaments For the sky-like nature of mind-wondrous! Mind-it has no color, it has no shape. Look for it: it cannot be found at all-Emptiness! Leave mind just as it is-Vivid clarity! Immaculate, empty, like the infinite sky-Let mind remain in that very state, And let it be-raw, brilliant, awake-Never obscured, utterly transparent. Leave mind at ease, open, without aim. When mind merges with that state Which, like space, is all-encompassing, All phenomena are understood with utter clarity And all the enlightened qualities Of the various paths and stages arise. Boundless compassion is born Toward beings who lack such realization. Through such training in emptiness and compass10n, Benefit for other beings naturally occurs. May void, primordial wakefulness, Immaculate as the sky, actually arise-Vivid, free of obscuration-In the mind-streams of those who hear this song.

One day, my heart-sonjimba Norbu, 'jewel of Generosity,\" a fortunate being adorned with the ornament of the three trainings, thought [362b]. \"However much people like me practice the Dharma, they neither please the Buddhas nor benefit beings; this must be due to having missed a crucial point of the Dharma, but which one?\" Since I had said, \"Without compassion, the root of Dharma is rotten,\" he had reflected a great deal on compassion, and it became clear to him that his flaw was that vast compassion en-compassing without preference all sentient be-ings--good, bad, or neutral-had not yet been born in him.

Emptiness without compassion Is like an empty house without a landlord. Meditating without compassion is simply to inflict hardship on yourself: You will never achieve ultimate enlightenment. A practitioner without compassion Is disliked by whoever lays eyes on him; A \"great meditator\" without compassion Will never benefit beings. If you possess the wish-fulfilling gem, All your wishes will be granted; If you foster great compassion in your mind-stream, All other practices will follow. What is the point oflearning countless things? Better to learn a single one, compassion, The one Dharma that suffices for all. Therefore, practice compassion earnestly.

He became a supreme practitioner, a lama respected by all, who naturally set in motion great waves of benefit for the Dharma and all beings. One day my spiritual son Kalden Rangdrol carne from the Snow Mountain33 and presented me with all the offerings he himself had received from others. I told him, \"Here is a lot of wealth, but what do you have to offer me in terms of meditation experiences and realization?\" In answer he sang this: Of all beings, you are the jeweled diadem, 0 compassionate protector; Of all attachment may I free myself through your blessing; Of all the many practices you taught, I was a fortunate recipient; Of all the experiences which arose in my being, this account I offer to you:"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Absolute primordial purity (ka-dag), 34 the nature of mind, cannot be shown by symbols; and Because it has neither color (kha-dog) nor characteristics, Cannot be apprehended no matter how (ga-nas) you regard it. tDeluded thoughts of\"I\" (nga) have vanished in the absolute expanse--Empty words (ca-co) and cogitation cannot describe this.

''Now I have some heart-advice to give you: a sky needs a sun, a mother needs a child, a bird needs two wings. Likewise, emptiness alone is not enough. You need to have great compassion for all beings who have not realized this empti-ness--enemies, friends, and strangers. You need to have compassion that makes no distinctions between good and bad. You must understand that compassion arises through meditation, not simply from waiting, thinking that it may come forth by itself from emptiness. \"The same number of years you spent medi-tating on emptiness, you should now spend meditating day and night on compassion-a compassion a hundred times stronger than that of a mother for a child burnt in a fire, an unbear-ably intense compassion that arises when think-ing about the suffering of sentient beings. \"Once such compassion is born, you must practice until you come to think, with fierce energy, 'Until enlightenment, I shall do what-ever is possible to benefit all beings, not omitting a single one--no matter what evil actions they commit, and no matter what difficulties I must endure.\"' And I continued with this spiritual advice: Master, Lord of wisdom and compassion, I supplicate you: Grant your blessings that emptiness imbued with compassion May be born in my mind.

From that very same evening he meditated in this way. An uncontrived compassion arose in him; cherishing others more than himself, he greatly benefited beings. One day, the learned and accomplished Gelong Dmje Lopon offered me all his possessions, even his monastic robes, with these words: Just as when the Muni, the Bhagavat, Came into this world, Meditation at Lapchi 423 So you, precious refuge and protector, Came to benefit the beings of this degenerate age.

Therefore, I, Dmje Lopon, Folding my hands at my heart, Submit these words to you with utter veneration: I have heard it said that the two truths [366b] Were the heart of the teachings Of the compassionate Shakyamuni. I therefore ask that you give me a teaching In a few simple words that contains the whole meaning And explains how to contemplate the view of the two truths. 0 protector, I pray that throughout my lives I may be nourished by the nectar of your words.

There is little need for me to tell you all this ' Nevertheless, simply as a reminder for you And as a source of help for others, I shall give a few explanations--listen well. Regarding the view of the absolute truth, With the help of your intelligence and the scriptures, You should examine in various ways, carefully and repeatedly, The outer objects apprehended by mind And the inner mind that apprehends them. Are these empty or not empty? When you examine them closely, There is nothing to be found-See the nature of all phenomena to be empty. Examining well, in the same way, tum your attention Toward the intellect that was analyzing objects: Does that have any true existence or not? When both the subject that examines And the object that has been examined Have completely vanished into emptiness [367a], Looking toward the nature of that sheer emptiness Without distraction is called \"the view.\" When you are thus looking at the empty nature of mind, Although there is no object being examined And there is no subject who examines, Do not confuse this empty nature With some amorphous state of mind Devoid of any qualities whatsoever. When you are practicing, remaining in evenness In a state that is like the sky-Clear without, Clear within, Clear and void-transparent-Although there is no object of meditation, Although there is no subject who is doing meditation, Without agitation, without drowsiness, Firmly maintain an alert presence. When you are preserving the natural state of mind That is sheer, unobstructed emptiness, Free from such limiting concepts as Existence and nonexistence, Eternity and nothingness Going and coming, Sameness and difference, Although there is no object of analysis And no subject who is analyzing, Do not, like some thoughtless child, Just indulge yourself in unconsidered actions. If the wish-fulfilling jewel of the view Is polished over and over again with meditation And set at the top of the victory banner of action, It will grant you the fruition you desire, the dharmakaya.

See how the causes and conditions of nonvirtue, Lead to its fruit: suffering. Cultivate love and compassion For those who do not recognize this. Like a magician transforming one thing into another, You must exchange nonvirtue for virtue, And for the sake of all beings Release the great waves of Bodhisattva activity. If you accomplish this perfectly, The fruit of the rupakaya will ripen. On hearing these words, all those gathered there developed strong conviction about relative truth-the law of cause and effect-and about absolute truth-profound emptiness. Following this, many of them emulated the perfect lives of the Bodhisattvas, uniting view and action har-moniously, not making the mistake of combin-ing the highest view with unseemly conduct. Once, about five hundred monks and nuns and a thousand laymen and women came to receive Meditation at Lapchi 425 teaching. All of them, including the local Monpas, developed faith and listened to the Dharma. I recounted the past lives of the Buddha and other life-stories, and taught the Graded Path and mind training. I also gave them empowerments for the Secret Mantrayana and instructions on the de-velopment and completion stages. I gave them, too, teachings on plwwa, prana, and Chod; as well as on Mahamudra, the Great Perfection, and the Dohas. Mter having thus turned the wheel of the vast and profound Dharma of the sutras and mantras at length, I concluded with this advice: Wear on your head the wish-fulfilling gem, The Muni, the Buddha, And all your wishes will be granted. Listen time and again to the drum of the Dharma, The Graded Path qf Enlightenment, And you will be saved from the lower rebirths. Drink time and again the peerless nectar, The mind training of the Mahayana, And you will be cured of the disease of the obscuring emotions [368a].

May this Drop of Gold, 38 an advice that came from the yogin's heart, Relieve from their sufferings those who are destitute ofDharma. All those present were heartened by these words. Having accomplished their own benefit through their practice, many of them became great dis-ciples who brought to others the stream of these teachings, thus benefiting the Buddha's teach-ings and many beings. At this time, several hundred men and women, led by a lama from Drakmar, the great siddha Ngawang Lhundrup, shaved their heads. Some took novice vows; some took full monastic vows [368b]. Mter that, one could see hair all over the place, stuck into the cracks and cavities of the slate rocks. One day, I said to the disciples and patrons that if they prevented people from hunting birds and wild animals in the vicinity of the mountain hermitages and monasteries, this would bring auspiciousness and prosperity to the country; long life, good health, happiness and good for-tune would come to everyone. I explained to them in detail the reasons for this. Following my advice, they circulated letters all around explain-ing that it was wrong to hunt. Mter this, not only did people stop hunting birds and wild animals, but they also forbade other hunters and Tilinka warriors to hunt. They also requested and obtained from the Gorkha king a decree stating that hunters would be pun-ished. In this way the lives of thousands of birds and wild animals were saved every year. From this time, too, all the monks there received a regular allowance of rice. Sometimes, we would cook ten to fifteen large bags of rice in a huge pot, and make it into hundreds of ganachakra offerings. Not just the people but even the dogs became quite fat and could not eat all that they were given. One day, a lame old man sang something like this: A good fortune we have, Ia! The Dharma has flourished, Ia! The banner of the teachings Has been unfurled on the palace heights; The auspicious comiection has been created For the teachings to spread further and further north. 39 A good fortune we have, Ia!

All the people from Nyanang, the pilgrims, and the traveling merchants sang, played music and danced; everyone was filled with joy. From this time onwards, many fortunate disciples, both men and women, gathered there every year. Before I gave the first teaching, to celebrate the greatness of the teacher and the Dharma, all the disciples would walk in a proces-sion, headed by the fully ordained monks, who were composed and peaceful, wearing the three monastic robes. They carried variegated ban-ners, canopies, and standards; they blew gyalings, 40 trumpets, and conches, and beat drums. The monks would be followed by the great yogins, with their long hair coiled up on top of their heads in various ways. They would beat the big Chad drum with their right hands and blow the thighbone trumpet held in their left, pro-ceeding with festive dancing movements. Then would come the ordained nuns, hold-ing vajras and ringing bells, or playing [369b] the tiny cymbals, 41 followed by the female lay practitioners, the long-haired jetsunmas, 42 holding incense and multicolored flowers. Thus they would proceed, in groups of five hundred. The procession started from the plain down below and ended at the Cave of the Subjugation ofMara where I was staying. Those who arrived fust would circumambulate the temple three or four times until the procession ended. They would then invite me to come down. When the proces-sion would reach the teaching place, all the dis-ciples and patrons gathered there would display boundless joy, faith, respect~ and pure percep-tion, as though they had arrived in a celestial land of dakas and dakinis. Even now, when I remember this, I feel cheerful. During the summer, many people having Meditation at Lapchi 427 gathered there, I thought of building a stupa. I asked everyone to bring stones and with each person fetching only one stone, to everyone's amazement, that very day the stupa was com-pleted. In the month of the Pleiades in the female Iron Snake Y ear43lmown as Khyuchog, the treasurer Kalzang Trinley (someone with great faith, gen-erosity, and intelligence, who always did everything in accord with his teacher's word), Lama Jimba Norbu, the sovereign siddha Kalden Rangdrol, Phugtra Khenpo, Dapa Lama, and hundreds of other fortunate dis-ciples left, one after the other, to offer the gold for the pinnacle of the Great Stupa of Bodhnath. I sent to the king and his ministers a new letter that said: Dharma King Surya Kumar,44 \"Princely Sun,\" Who illuminates the whole earth with loving-kindness [370a], And sustains all lands with your beneficial warmth, You are without peer on this earth.

At this time the Am ban 46 became appre-hensive and sent to the court ofjamyang Gong-rna Rinpoche47 a letter about current events. But the day the messenger left to bring the letter, his horse stepped into one oflliasa's refuse pits and broke its leg, and the man himself dislocated his arm. The box containing the letter fell to the ground and broke. The Amban saw this as a bad omen and asked the noble dignitaries, ''What kind of person is Lama Shabkar? What has he been doing? Won't we be reprimanded if we don't notifY the emperor?\" [37lb]. The regent-king and ministers ofTibet said, \"From his youth, Lama Shabkar has been con-cerned solely with the Dharma and knows noth-ing of worldly affairs. Since he came to central Tibet, he has used all his possessions for offer-ings, for charity, and to serve the monastic com-munity. Particularly, he offered lamps of solid gold to the Crowned Buddhas of lliasa and Samye. \"These days, having in mind the long life of the Gongma Rinpoche and of the Victorious Ones, Father and Son,48 the perpetuation of the Dharma, and the happiness of beings, in fulfill-ment of these prayers he is currently offering a gold coating laid on copper to the thirteen rings crowning the great Bodhnath stupa in Nepal. We are told that half of the work has been completed. If he failed to report this matter to the emperor, it is only because as a Dharma practitioner, he is unaware of the protocol to be observed.\" Following this the Amban pondered the matter and said, \"The news must be reported to Meditation at Lapchi 429 the emperor, otherwise he may blame us if any trouble arises with our foreign neighbors.\" \"In that case, after having consulted each other, we must send news,\" they said. Accordingly, the Amban, having consulted with the regent-king and ministers of Tibet, sent a letter that said: \"The one by the name ofLama Shabkar, an exemplary Dharma practitioner, has undertaken to offer a gilded copper garment to the upper rings of the Bodhnath Stupa in Nepal, with the intention ofbenefiting Your Imperial Majesty's longevity, the Buddhist teachings, and the hap-piness of all beings. Is he or is he not authorized to do so?\" All the disciples and benefactors then waited anxiously, wondering what sort of answer the emperor would give [372a]. When the answer fmally came it said: \"As he is a Dharma practitioner, ignorant of worldly customs, we will not reprimand him for not having sought advice. If one prevents him from completing the thirteen rings, there is a danger that the neighboring people may become uneasy and raise trouble. Therefore, let him do it. Mter that, he must come back to Tibet and involve himself in purely religious matters. He must not stay in border areas.\" Everyone rejoiced greatly at this outcome. Soon after came the good news that the offering of the thirteen gold rings had been com-pleted. I offered hundreds of dedication prayers and, with great joy, voiced this song: I bow down to the matchless king of the Shakyas, To the Dharma sovereign of the three worlds, Tsongkhapa, To his spiritual sons and the heirs of their lineage: Grant your blessings that I may benefit the Dharma and all beings!

In the end, I roamed at random through a hundred lands, Giving food, clothes, and Dharma to help beings. Now, for the good of the teachings and of all beings, I have covered the Dharma rings of the stupa with gold. I have made pure prayers to dedicate the merit from the accomplishment [372b] Of more than a hundred great tasks for the benefit of the Dharma and all beings. If! die I am glad, I have offered my prayers; If! live I am glad, I shall work intensively For the sake of the Dharma and all beings.

Now, whether I meet happiness or suffering, I am in your hands-Keep me under your protection until I reach enlightenment. May all those who rejoice upon hearing of these deeds Obtain the merit they would have earned If they had performed these deeds themselves. When I sang this, all those present were very happy. Since I was wondering whether I should travel to perform the consecration of the newly gilded pinnacle, one evening I prayed to the precious Dharma King, and the same night I met him in a dream. He said to me, \"This year, do not go; it will be the same if, directing your mind, you perform the consecration from here.\" Accordingly, I did not go to Nepal. On the consecration day, some ten thou-sand people gathered and a vast ganachakra feast was offered. The great siddha Kalden Rangdrol gave a long life empowerment to all. With him, Lamajimba Norbu, Phugtra Khenpo, and about a hundred other masters performed the conse-cration. On that same day, from Lapchi, I clearly visualized performing the consecration and then threw flowers into the sky [373a]. Through the auspicious coincidence of my doing this and the ardent faith of the disciples and patrons, some persons with good karma and pure perception saw me, amidst an expanse of rainbow-colored clouds that filled the sky, actually performing the consecration at Bodhnath. Everyone saw a mass of light in the sky, in the middle of rainbow clouds, and a large vulture which, having circled many time around the stupa, ascended higher and higher and flew in the direction of Lapchi. They said that consecration flowers rained on the stupa; most of the people there collected some and kept them as objects offaith. For this great task, Lamajimba Norbu had offered 150 s!w of gold, the great siddha Kalden Rangdrol400, the chieftain Tako 108, the chief-tainNamgyal200, SonamDargye 150, the house-holder Norbu 80, and Nagpon Sonam and his wife 50. With this and all the other offerings, altogether over 1,000 sang of gold were used. The details can be found in the descriptive list called the JiVhite Path of liberation. 49 The sun and moon are the two marvels in the sky; The Great Stupas are the two marvels on earth. Other than this pair, universally renowned, Are there, anywhere else, more sublime objects For circumambulation and offering?"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Wondrous accounts relate how Many wise and accomplished great beings Offered time and again a mantle of precious gold [3 7 3b] To the Great Stupa ofSvayambhu. Although they also could have offered A mantle of gold to the great Bodhnath stupa, It seems they left it to be done by us, future disciples, So that we might have the good fortune to accumulate merit. I mustered all my courage, And with gods and men lending a hand to the work, For the frrst time a precious mantle of gold has been completed. Look how its dazzling beams shine toward a hundred horizons! Celestial and human beings abiding on the side of virtue, rejoice! With joyous movements, dance cheerfully! If you have melodious songs to sing, sing them! There is no meaning in accumulated wealth, But there is meaning in wealth used like this. I offer this discourse to all gods and men; Full of joy, may they repeat it to each other. I pray, not only from the lips, but from deep in my heart, To all future great Dharma practitioners: Just as I did for the Dharma rings, May you cover with precious gold The middle and the vase-like body of the stupa. I pray that in a future life, I myself May cover the entire stupa with precious gold, Meditation at Lapchi 431 And adorn it with the images of the thousand Buddhas of this age And the infinite deities of the four tantras. I dedicate all merit accumulated throughout the three times, Symbolized by this, to the benefit of the Dharma and of all beings. By the efficacy of this dedication, May the Buddha's Dharma expand and spread [3 7 4a]; May all sentient beings fmd happiness and bliss; May not even the words \"disease,\" \"fam-ine,\" \"conflict,\" And \"undesirable events\" be heard in this world; May there be longevity, good health, abundant harvests and prosperous herds; May great auspiciousness pervade the whole earth! While I was benefiting many beings in this holy place, many lepers who had heard about me came--those who had someone to take care of them were carried-to receive a blessing that would cure them. I made them stay many days in this holy place, and with great compassion I recited the mantras of the Three Protectors, of the Multicolored Gamda, and of the Adamantine Annoi>0 over some water collected from the glaciers, and had them drink it. I also washed their bodies while performing cleansing rituals, and gave them medicines. Many of them were cured, and people said, \"This lama is the Buddha in person; he has marvelous blessing powers.\" Many more sick men and women came and most of them were cured. Mter this episode faith grew stronger than ever in the local patrons; many of them tried their best to abandon negative actions and to endeavor in virtue, in accordance with the teach-ings I had given them."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"432 Th£ Life of Shabkar I gave many presents to all the hunters that came by, Magars and Yalongs,51 and having taught them some Dharma, made them promise not to kill any more wild animals. They offered me their hunting dogs, and at one point I had ten or fifteen of them. Fearing that these dogs might kill animals or bite people, I put a few men in charge of them [374b]. Later, I took these dogs to Tibet and gave them to some patrons who never hunted. Sometimes, thieves, monks or nuns who had broken their vows, Khampas who had killed people, villagers possessed by the devil of drunk-enness, 52 fighting couples, or old men and women who had committed evil actions-in short, all sorts of mischievous people-would come. Know-ing what they had done, either through having talked with others or through my own insight, I would tell them: \" Eh, you! Didn't you kill some-one?\" or, \"Aren't you drinking chong?\" \"Yes, it is true,\" they would admit, and many of them would prostrate themselves, confess their past actions, and promise not to commit them again. One day a faithful old woman came, bring-ing along a big lump of butter. I told her, \"It is good that Grandma came bringing a big lump of butter, but didn't Grandpa say 'Don't take the big lump, take the small one'?\" Realizing that I knew, the old lady replied, \"Yes, he did!\" and everyone burst into laughter. Another time, a patron from the valley, a drunkard, came with a supply of chang, and hid it somewhere by the road before coming to me. When he arrived, I told him, \"Oh, benefactor, welcome to you! By the way, where did you hide your clw.ng?\" He thought, \"He knows!\" and vowed, \"From now on, I shall not drink so much.\" Similarly, because I would sometimes sud-denly say whatever came into my mind from within a state of calm meditation, the faithful used to say, \"Knowing all the hidden faults of others, he can tell them without difficulty [375a]. If you ask him for a divination, he says he doesn't know; it is not that he doesn't know, it is just that he doesn't say. But when he does say something, he reveals his unimpeded clairvoyance.\" Many of them developed faith and respect, perceiving me in a pure way. Sonam Nyentrak was a devoted disciple liv-ing at Changchub Metok, the Enlightenment Flower, a new monastery in the valley. On the thirteenth day of the tenth month of the Iron Snake Year, 53 he dreamed of a twenty-year-old yogin with hair knotted on the top of his head and a mark of ashes between his eyebrows, whom he knew to be the protector Shabkar. The yogin sang this song: Father, Dharma King, inseparable From the matchless protector Padrnakara-The lord who embodies the Buddhas of the three times-Dwell in the center of my heart! Listen for an instant, fortunate son: This excellent support so hard to obtain, a free and fit body, Will not last for long and is doomed to destruction. Better hasten to practice the sublime Dharma. The root of the path is the spiritual master; You need an authentic one: make no mistake. This is a vital issue. Ponder it carefully And follow a qualified teacher. Among the teachings ofMadhyamika, Mahamudra, and the Great Perfection, Which all carry the meaning of the sutras, the tantras and pith instructions, Practice the teachings toward which you feel most affmity, And the sun ofhappiness will shine on this life and the lives to come. The yogin added, ''If you need water, you will find a blessed spring to the right side of Changchub Metok\" [375b]. It is said that, fol-lowing these indications, people searched for and found the spring. All were amazed and con-firmed in their faith."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"In those days the Buddhists living near the Dia-mond 1brone oflndia, Bodhgaya, were saying, \"Although now the precious teachings of Lord Buddha are not found to any great extent in India, they flourish in Tibet. During the Great Prayer Festival of the miracle month,54 amidst a gathering of hundreds of thousands of monks and nuns, there are hundreds of panditns thor-oughly versed in the five branches of learning, and in mountain caves there are thousands of renunciates who are great meditators endowed with clairvoyance and miraculous powers. \"Among them is the siddha Shabkarpa, an emanation of a past siddha of India. He is called Shabkarpa, White Foot, because wherever he lays his feet, that whole place becomes white with virtue. Whenever he moves to another mountain retreat, he goes unimpeded through the rocks, with no one knowing where he went. When others beg him for wealth, he takes any ordinary stone, transforms it into gold and gives it away. When faithful people pray to him, he appears to them in reality, in visions, or in dreams. Now he is staying at Lapchi Snow Range.\" As they were wondering, 'What does he look like? Does anyone want to go and see?\" four young acho:ryaf5 said, \"If this is a true story, we will go.\" They came to Lapchi, and when we met I offered them some presents, silver, gold, and other things [3 7 6a]. They did not accept them, saying instead, \"We don't need these, we came to see you.\" They stayed about four days, and when they returned they described how I looked, how I spoke, and so on. It is said that, following this, some faithful faced towards Tibet and pros-trated themselves. Once, a foreign notable56 residing in Nepal met some of my monks who had gone there on pilgrimage and borrowed a collection of my songs they had with them. He asked a knowledgeable person to read them to him, and while listening he thought, \"This person seems to be a real Buddha; teachings like these are certainly benefi-cial to the ethical principles of a country.\" Fol-lowing this, he had my songs translated into his language and sent them overseas to his country's queen to arouse her wonder, mentioning, \"This Meditation at Lapchi 433 is the kind of delightful composition one fmds here.\" More than once, some respectable Nepalese and Monpas, with all their young sons and daugh-ters, would walk for ten or fifteen days to come and meet me. Through an interpreter, I used to teach them the Dharma, particularly on the karmic law of cause and effect. With great faith, many of them would place my feet upon their heads, shed tears and make prayers before return-ing home. Some of the Monpas who came to sell loads of rice would kill and eat many large grasshop-pers on the way. I told them, \"It is wrong to kill living beings; don't do it, or after death you will go to hell\" [376b]. Mter this many of them gave up killing. I also said, \"If you want happiness, pray to Avalokiteshvara and, gathering people, wealth, and food, you will fmd satisfaction. To pray, recite Om mani padme hum,\" and I taught them the mani. Later, when I was back in Tsang, some of them came there singing the mani. Mter three years had passed, filled with the joy of having completed the offering of the gold mantle to the Bodhnath stupa, and also remembering Tibet, the Land of Snows, I felt a wish to return there, and sang this cheerful song: Authentic jewel guru, Remain upon my head as my crest orna-ment. I, the renunciate yogin, Will sing today a song of happiness.

After this I went on pilgrimage to establish a connection with the places wherejetsun Milarepa stayed in meditation: Drakmar Chonglung, the Red Rock of the Valley of Agates; Po tho Namkha Dzong, the Sky Citadel Mountain; and K yiphuk Nima Dzong, the Pleasant Cave of the Sun Citadel. At the Red Rock we built five hermitages in one day, and. I installed a few retreatants in them. There Drakmar Lama, a resident ofPotho, was most helpful to all of us, master and disciples, From there we went to make a connection with the holy place of Shelphuk Chushing Dzong, the Crystal Cave Reed Fortress. 58 I served Osang Monastery as best I could, setting a gan-fira59 pinnacle of gold-plated copper on the roof of the assembly hall. When we came to the castle of the Po district, the notable T ashi Deden and his son offered us good hospitality. Proceeding to Chubar Gonpa, 60 we paid homage at the statue of the preciousjetsun made out ofhis funeral ashes and known as the ':Jetsun Meaningful to See.\"61 We made large offerings in front of it. There I met Chubar Khen Rinpoche, Yon-ten lliundrup, the heart-son of the Bodhisattva Y ongdzin Pandita. Over a period of fifteen days, I received from him the explanations upon the Qyintessential Ambrosia [377b],62 a text on mind training; the initiations of the Opening the Door of the Slg63 and of the Sixteen Spheres;64 and the trans-mission of the Malwmudra Teachings of the Gedenpas. 65 In gratitude for these teachings, I presented him with an offering of the symbols of the body, speech, and mind, with some silver and gold, and other offerings. He himself gave me many presents. From there, I returned to Lapchi. As I was going to leave for central Tibet, the lamas T rinley and Tsogsham from the main monastery, the patrons Dorgyapa and Trinley, and all the local disciples and householders offered a vastgana£hakra feast. They presented me with me the symbols of the body, speech, and mind, and, several times, made the hundredfold offering.66 The Khampa merchants who had been to India offered many crystal vases filled with water from the Ganges and a large light-mansion made of glass to house butter-lamp offerings. The lama from Lidepago offered a black antelope's skin and horns. To Tsogsham Monastery I offered agar!fira . pinnacle made of gilded copper. To all the local disciples and patrons I gave blessed substances, including precious relics of the hair and clothing of past saints.

Faithful villagers, listen carefully To this advice from my heart. Lamas, do not spoil the water of virtue at its source By drinking chang and becoming possessed by the ''bitter devil\" [378a]. To engender trust in the minds of virtuous monks, Behave in accord with the Dharma. Virtuous monks, do not drink chang, Lest you act in disorderly ways; Rather guard your vows as taught by the guru And behave in accord with the monastic precepts. Chieftains, do not inflict Unjust punishments on your subjects. Humble the arrogant and raise the humble. Care for all with loving-kindness. Old people, driven by excessive cravings, Do not indulge in useless gossip. Satisfied with whatever food you get, Stay quietly and recite the mani. All of you who live in the same home, Avoid harsh words and quarrels. The elders should look after the young ones, And the young should listen to their elders. Husbands and wives, do not rudely Talk back to your elderly parents, But give them the best of your food And gently help them to dress or go to bed. Do not give too much work to your servants, Meditation at Lapchi 435 Without even feeding them properly; Give them food and clothing as you would to your children, And give them time to rest. Don't let the old dog by your door Suffer from hunger and cold; Feed it morning and evening, Let it sleep in a warm place, And when you eat, give it something, too. Do not mercilessly slaughter the tkomo's calf, As though you were killing an enemy, Just because it drinks its own mother's milk; But, with compassion, give it half of the milk And never kill the to!hu 67 calves. Don't let people hunt The birds and wild animals of your land; Spare their lives, and the local deities will be pleased-Needless to say, you yourself shouldn't hunt. Do not create senseless animosity and quarrels [378b] With your nearest neighbors; Rather, whenever anyone is in difficulty, Be quick to help each other. Don't let quarrels triggered by a few bad people Spread discord among all, But settle past disagreements, And then maintain harmony. Rich people, don't be so miserly: You cannot say when death will come. Every year, offer a generous feast To all the local folk.

I pray that-however difficult it seems-We may meet again in this life. But even if we don't, May we meet in the next life. These words having made their way into people's minds, they refrained from evil actions and tried to do good. As a result of the Dharma being practiced in this area, crops became abundant and happiness prevailed. On the eve of my departure, the old patron Dresang Tsering, Umze Gyawo, and all the people from this holy place, who had been con-tinuously providing [379a] me with milk, whey, butter, and other necessities, offered, together with many wealthy patrons, a great ganachakra feast, and presented me with a hundred different offerings. Even the poorest contributed what-ever they could. Then they said: \"Precious protector and lord, you have already shown great kindness to us, the people ofLapchi. Still, you must remain in our monastery for one or two more years. If not, at least you must give us some profound advice that would be the same as your being here.\" In answer, I gave them much beneficial advice, and concluded with this: I pray to my gurus and to all the gurus of the lineage: Grant your blessing that all my thoughts may be turned towards the Dharma.

As a result, the people's good fortune increased and everyone enjoyed happiness and peace. Again, for the sake of the faithful and kind patrons of Drin, Tsogsham, and Nyanang Tashigang, I gave many teachings and beneficial pieces of advice. As we were about to part, I concluded with this heart-advice: Lord guru endowed with the three kindnesses 69 ' Assembly of peaceful and wrathful deities, I pray you to bless the body, speech, and mind Of all those gathered here. Shower upon them a rain of ordinary and extraordinary siddhis. To have obtained a human body in this life Is like reaching a crossroad, The point from which one may go up or down: Don't take the wrong path, dear patrons. In the years gone by since you were born, See how many have died, old and young. Keep in mind that you can't be confident That you won't die tomorrow or even today. When the merciless Lord of Death arrives, He will not let you remain in this life even one day longer; Unable to take with you your children, food, and wealth, Y au go alone from this life to the next.

While I remained in Lapchi, you came to me; I was able to tum your minds to the Dharma. Through this, many of you became good practitioners. When I ponder this, I think, \"How fortunate that was!\" My affection for all of you became greater and greater As the days we spent together passed by. Now that it is time to leave, we cannot bear to separate; Yet, shedding tears, we must take leave of each other. If your yearning love does not change, Even though I shall be gone to distant lands, From time to time-in actuality, in meditation, or in dreams-We shall meet again, faithful friends! And though most of us may not meet again in this life, I pray that we may meet again in the next. Keep clearly in your minds This farewell advice given from my heart; And wherever I go, In my mind I shall keep you all. May all those who hear these words, Ponder the impermanence of all things, And, having naturally turned their minds toward the Dharma, Give up negative actions to strive in positive ones. As I sang this, most of those present, shed-ding many tears, took vows not to kill any living being, to recite the mani, and to perform other virtuous deeds. Some pulled off their ornaments and offered them to me, requesting protection and prayers [38la]. Some, prostrating them-selves, prayed to meet me throughout their lives. Finally, almost everybody went back home. When the actual time came to leave, I offered a vast ganachakra feast to all the gurus, the yidam deities, the dakinis, the dharmapalas, such as the Five Sisters of Long Life, who abide on the side of virtue, and to all the local deities including the own-ers of the ground--in short, to all those abiding in the highlands of the Lapchi Snow Range. Lapchi is the seat of the supreme Rishi, the playground of the dakas and dakinis, the happy grove where deities inclined toward virtue gather, the central place where the Wheel of the Dharma of Realization has been set in motion, the perfect mansion where the victory banner of the Muni's teaching is raised, the land where the lineage of spiritual practice spreads far and wide, the secluded spot where contemplation naturally flourishes, the exalted sacred place that is like a celestial field wreathed in wondrous rainbows. Then I gave food, clothes, money for the journey, and other useful things to all the dis-ciples gathered there. The patrons of Lapchi, too, gave presents and provisions. When we were enjoying the sacramental feast together, I gave the following advice to all the disciples and patrons gathered there: \"Although born in different places, by the power of our past karma and prayers, we gath-ered at this extraordinary place, coming from all directions without having been summoned [381 b]. For three years we established deep spiri-tual connections, through teachings and offer-ings. Now we are parting from each other, and it seems unlikely that I will come here again: this is the way everything goes.

May we achieve three things: bliss, happiness, and esteem.

'When we die, may the gurus, the sublime deities, the wisdom dakinis, and Dharma protec-tors endowed with wisdom eyes come in reality to show us the path leading to the pure land of Celestial Enjoyment, or to any other Buddhafield to which we aspire. \"May we, in the lives thereafter, actually meet in a pure and blissful Buddhafield; then, never parting from each other, may we happily converse on all sorts of subjects. Using unlimited miraculous powers, may we wander throughout the coundess millions of realms, pure and impure, making offering to the Buddhas and requesting the deities of the 1bree Roots to lead and protect all beings. I have made before, and I shall always Meditation at Lapchi 439 make, prayers to create a perfect connection for the accomplishment of these wishes.\" Thus, having prayed from my heart, I added, \"Now,just like the flowers of auspiciousness tossed into the sky, we, master and disciples, will be scattered in all directions and be separated by great distances. One can never plan birth and death, so who knows whether we will meet again? Now that we are gathered here together, we think, 'How nice if we could remain together a little longer!\"' Garlands of affectionate thoughts revolved in my mind, inspiring this song: I pray to the guru and the 1breejewels [382b]: Grant your blessing that I be of benefit to both myself and others.

Now it is time for you to return home; Devote all your energies to the Dharma, Since you can't know when death will come.

As I was about to depart, our spiritual brothers and sisters, too, were preparing to leave. Seeing this, Dorje Lopon, Y eshe Wangchuk, and all the faithful with pure samaya who were staying in this holy place were struck with boundless sadness, and, with one vmce offered this sorrowful song: Wondrous and preciousjetsun, Protector, you are a past Buddha Who assumed an ordinary human form To guide the beings of this decadent age [383a].

Here are gathered, without having been summoned, Many fortunate beings you are meant to help. Protector, when for three years Dwelling on the lion throne, You turned the Wheel of the vast and profound Dharma For all the celestial and human beings who thronged here, We thought that, having thus met Vajradhara himself, Even if we were to reach the Akanishtha heaven, There would be nothing better to expect. When we think of this, sadness whirls in our hearts, And tears continually fall from our eyes [383b]. Driven on by our karma, all of us will go our own ways To the world of our next life. Who can say whether we will meet or not? When we think of this, sadness continually wells up in our minds. All gathering ends in separation-This is the condition of the samsaric world; This brings sadness, but what is to be done? Kyema!

All you vajra brothers and sisters with pure samaya, Set off in peace for your own lands. In whichever direction you may go, Hoist the victory banner of practice in solitude.

We go now to distant places where, Even if we look, we will not be able to see each other; Even if we call out, we will not hear each other-So it will be, when going on to the next life. When great distances lie between us, master and spiritual friends, And the way we used to live together in this holy place comes back to our minds, We will think, \"Why couldn't that happen again?\" And a time will come for all of us to weep. At that time, remembering the guru, Pray to him over and over again, Remembering our spiritual companions, Let your tears flow freely. It is certain that you will then meet the guru and companions In reality, in inner experiences, or in dreams.

Each person's mind being filled with thoughts of his or her companions, overwhelmed by a boundless sadness, weeping, they left, looking back many times, the thought of impermanence written on their faces [385a]. Following this, haunted by the way imper-manence strikes, most of them did not even feel like eating for one or two days, and they broke into tears many times. Later, they went to vari-ous mountain solitudes and lived in accord with the Dharma. When I heard of this, I was very pleased. Notes l. There are several Tibetan guidebooks to Lapchi, among which the most extensive was written by Drigung Chungtsang Konchog Tendzin (1829-1906; see chap. ll, note l 0), hereafter quoted as GL. A clear and detailed description of the site of Lap chi and its history, with translation of large parts of the guide mentioned above, has been presented by Toni Huber (1989, hereafter quoted as LNY). Among the twenty-four holy places (see chap. II , note I 0), Lapchi corresponds to Godhavari. Sev-eral other locations are also known as Godhavari, perhaps the most ancient one of which is situated in central India (see LNY, note 2). Another one is located in the Kathmandu Valley, near a spring said to be the womb of Vajravarahi. It must be remembered that sacred geography does not follow the same crite-ria as ordinary geography. Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910-91), for instance, said that within any single valley one can identify the entire set of the twenty-four sacred places. Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche (1903-87) also said that sacred places, such as Uddiyana, can shrink and even disappear when con-ditions are no longer conducive to spiritual practice. The twenty-four sacred places are also present in the innate vajra body of each being. Among these, Godhavari, or Lapchi, is the left ear. It is said that Lapchi was first ruled by a mali-cious and fierce gandharva (dri ;;.a) couple, Suravarina and his consort Viramati, who took Mahadeva as their object of refuge. Following the subjugation of Mahadeva (see chap. 11, note I 0), the Bodhisattva"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Vajrapani (phyag na rdo de) and his consort V etali (ro lang ma) subdued Suravarina and his consort. The Bodhisattva and his consort took possession of the spirits' abode and ornaments. The Bodhisattva trans-formed them respectively into a celestial palace and into divine attributes. He and his consort enjoyed the meat and drink in which the spirits reveled, as the sacramental substances of ganachakra feast offerings. They blessed the lingam symbol of Mahadeva as the mandala of the sixty-two deities of the Chakrasamvara mandala. Lapchi was also blessed by Guru Padmasam-bhava and by the great physician Yuthok Yonten Gonpo (g:Ju tlzogyon tan mgon po), but it became espe-cially famous after the great saint Jetsun Milarepa ( 1 040-1123) spent many years there in solitary medita-tion. Milarepa \"opened\" the sacred place by subju-gating the local deities and negative forces adverse to the Dharma. Later many other masters came to meditate at Lapchi. Those from the Drigung lineage in particular exerted their spiritual influence on the place over centuries down to the present day (see chap. 11, note 10, as well as GLand Petech 1978). The central site of Lapchi is said to be a \"triple triangle\"; the sky above is seen as a triangle, the earth below is triangular, and the rivers in between form a triangle. Among the many sacred mountains around, the central one is said to be the palace of Chakra-samvara. Three other mountains are considered to be the palaces of Avalokiteshvara, Vajrapani, and Manjushri. 2. The three sacred places: Kailash, Tsari, and Lapchi. 3. The Cave of the Subjugation of Mara (bdud 'dul phuiJ is the principal among the four main caves of Lapchi, the three other one being the Crest Cave (ze phug), the Revelation of All Secrets (sbas pa lam gsa~, and the Prophesied Cave of the Great Forest (lung bstan tshal chen phug), and the Hidden Cave (sbas phug). The Cave of the Subjugation of Mara is one of the \"four widely known caves\" mentioned in Milarepa's life-story (see Bacot 1925 and Lhalungpa 1984). It was in this cave thatjetsun Milarepa subjugated a host of demons who had attacked him. It is also the place where, blocked by snow that had fallen for eighteen days and nights, he spent six months in complete seclusion, surviving on one measure of tsampa. There too, Milarepa performed many miracles and left nearby a footprint in a rock. See Tsang Nyong Heruka's Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa (mi la'i mgur 'bum) and their translation in English by G. C. C. Chang (1977). Meditation at Lapchi 443 Other great saints who meditated in this cave include Milarepa's moon-like disciple Rechung Dorje Trakpa (ras chung rdo de grogs pa, 1084-1161 ), Nyo Lhanangpa (gnyos lha nang pa, 1164-1224), the \"Mad Yogin of Tsang Ornate with Bones\" (gtsang smyon heruka rus pa'i rgyan can, 1452-1507), and the \"Victorious Hermit ofLapchi,\" Namkha Gyaltsen (rgyal la phyi pa nam mkha' rgyal mtshan, fifteenth century, said to be the mind-aspect incarnation of Milarepa). 4.

Under his regency Tibet knew a period of peace and prosperity. The regency then fell to a weaker character, Tsemon Lingpa, Ngawangjampel Tsultrim (tshe smonglingpa ngag dbang )\"am dpal tshul khrims), who ruled from 1819 to 1844. See Shakabpa 1976 and 1984. 6. Pelgyeling ('phel rgyas gling), the \"Place of In-crease and Expansion,\" was named by Milarepa. Mter Milarepa's death, a monastery was built upon the Garuda Cave, Namkha Ding Phug (nam mkha' !ding phug), a cave where Milarepa meditated for sev-eral years, in the \"Nyelam,\" or more correctly Nyanang (gnya' nang) Valley. At the nearby Belly Cave (grod pa phug, see PP, NL Y, and MI), one can still see the hand-and footprint that Milarepa left mi-raculously on the rock. Rechungpa's cave lies slightly above Milarepa's cave. 7. Fifty Verses of Devotinn to the Guru (Skt. Guru-panchashika, Tib. bla ma lnga bcu pa, T 3721) by Asvaghosha (frrst century C.E).

Huber (1989) says, \"Like many Tibetan pilgrimage sites it is a place characterized by a rugged natural beauty, quite remote from major centers of human activity. Pilgrims who journey to Lapchi from tl1e expansive steppes and broad valleys of the arid Tibetan plateau experience a dramatic change in the physical environment as they descend deep into the heart of this Himalayan valley with its mantle of vegetation and noisy watercourses.\" 10. The Hidden One (sbas pa; see GL, p. 51, and l.NY, p. 55).

According to GL, p. 54/b, Shabkar stayed in the upper cave, the Revelation of All Secrets (sbas pa kun gsol). 11. The Azure Queen Mountain (mthon mthing rgyal mo), also known as the Peak of the Five Sisters ofLong Life (tshe ringmched lnga) and as Gaurishankar in Nepali, is a beautiful snow peak of triangular shape (7146 meters), east of Lapchi. It is considered to be the palace ofTseringma and her sisters. 12. According to GL, p. 53/a, this is the Lower Triangular Plain (chos 'byung ma thang), below the Cave of the Subjugation ofMara. 13. GL, p. 56/a says that the actual door of the cave, which Shabkar thus reopened, had been closed by nonhuman beings. According to a personal com-munication from Toni Huber, the cave itself has an outer and an inner part, separated by a narrow passage with a low roof. The stone hearth ofjetsun Milarepa is the centerpiece and inner sanctum of the cave. The temple is built as a continuation of the outer part of the cave. 14. This is an analogy with the formation of the universe. When the primordial ocean was churned by the winds, Mount Sumeru and the continents rose above its surface. 15. The seven royal emblems are the precious wheel, the precious jewel, the precious queen, the precious elephant, the precious minister, the precious horse, and the precious general. Here, Tashi Dedenpa is endowed with the seven noble riches (see chap. 5, note 13). 16. This small monastery called \"The Dharma Enclosure where Virtue Increases\" (chos ra dge 'phel gling) partially escaped destruction during the Cul-tural Revolution. It is situated at an altitude of 3900 meters at the upper limit of the forest, in the Lower Triangular Plain (chos 'byung ma thang) of Lapchi (see LNY, p. 74). It consists of a small temple surrounded by walls and rooms for the monks that form a monas-tic courtyard, or \"Dharma enclosure\" (chos ra), about twenty-five meters square. After Shabkar completed the construction, most of the precious images and relics in the valley were transferred and preserved in the temple. Chief among them (GL, p. 57/b) was the \"Nasal-blood Image\" (mtshal khrag ma), a statue of Jetsun Mila made by Rechungpa after Milarepa him-self had prepared the clay, mixing it with blood from his nose and veins, and with his saliva. Most of these precious images are no longer extant except for a painted-day statue of Shabkar. (Personal communi-cation byT. Huber.) 17. The Drigung Father and Son are the senior and the junior incarnates of Drigung Monastery, Drigung Chetsang (che tshang) and Chungtsang (chung tshang). The former was here Drigung Kyabgon Tendzin Padma Gyaltsen ('bri gung slgabs mgon bstan 'rkin padma rgyal mtshan, born in 1 770), the twenty-seventh hierarch ofDrigung and the reincarnation of Jigten Gonpo (Jig rten mgon po, 1143-1217).

One writes on it various mantras and prayers, and one attaches precious relics to it. 21. \"According to the prayer they made ... \" See chap. 12, note 28. 22. The very top of a stupa consists of thirteen Dharma wheels of decreasing diameters, fmally sur-mounted by a moon crescent and a sun. These thir-teen \"wheels\" are sometimes thirteen squares, as in the case of Bodhnath stupa. 23. Kazi Bhimsen Thapa ruled as prime minister of Nepal for thirty-one years ( 1806-3 7) under three successive kings. When Shabkar wrote his letter, King Rajendra Bikram Shah ( 1816-81 , dethroned in 184 7) was an infant, and the power was in the hands of Bhimsen Thapa and the regent queen grandmother, Tripura Sundari. 24.

The Amban and assistant Amban were the Chinese emperor's representatives in Lhasa, from 1727 to 1912. The emperor himselfwas known in Tibet as the Jamyang Gongma, or, in full, \"God of the Skies, Exalted Manjushri, Great Lord\" (gnam gyi IJza Jam dbyangs gong ma bdag po chen po), a title that the fifth Dalai Lama, on the occasion ofhis visit to Peking Meditation at Lapchi 445 in 1653, conferred upon the Manchu ruler (China being considered to be the Buddhafield ofManjushri). The Ambans at the time of this story were Wen'gan (who stayed at Lhasa from 1820 to 1823) and Linghai (1819 to 1821). SeeJosefKolmas (1992). The reasons to the apprehensiveness of the Amban are explained below. Most of the money circulating in Tibet in the second half of the eighteenth century was Nepalese silver coins. Although some were made of pure silver and some of 50 per cent alloy, they all circulated in Tibet at the same value (see Rhodes 1980). In 1768:_ 69, Prithvi Narayan Shah, chief ofGorkha (a princi-pality thirty miles west of Kathmandu) overthrew the Newari rulers in Kathmandu Valley and conquered most of the other areas of what is now Nepal. He then demonetized the debased coins, which became valued at half of those made of fme silver. This devaluation was not accepted by Tibetans, to whom it would have caused great losses. Trouble broke out in 1786, just after the regent-king of Tibet, Tsemon Ling Ngawang Tsultrim, had been invited to China. In 1788, the Gorkhali army invaded Tibet. In 1789 a treaty was signed in favor of the Gorkha1is, who withdrew their troops. Returning from China, the Tsemon Ling regent scolded his ministers for their feebleness in dealing with the Gorkhalis, but he died in 1791. In one incident, Tibetan negotiators who had come to Nyanang were killed or taken prisoner by the Gorkhalis in a trap set on the occasion of a religious festival, during which Gorkhali soldiers had disguised themselves as merchants and coolies. In 1 791, a Gorkhali army strong of eighteen thousand men again invaded Tibet as far as Tashi Lhunpo. The Tibetan army counterattacked and pushed the Gorkhali forces back to Nyanang. At that point, thirteen thousand Manchu troops arrived in Tibet and joined the ten thousand Tibetan soldiers. Together they drove the Gorkhalis back to within twenty miles of Kathmandu. In 1792, a treaty was signed between Nepal, Tibet, and China. In Lhasa, the populace began to protest against the presence of the Chinese army, which, they said, had entered Tibet unasked for, and had caused more harm to the Tibetans than the Gorkhalis themselves. Fallowing this, the two Am bans were removed for misconduct and returned to China. The new Ambans sent to Lhasa retained a little power for some time, but this power vanished soon after the death of Emperor Qjanlong in 1796.

Inside the temple, I offered a butter-lamp made from over one hundred silver coins and offered a general distribution of alms and tea. Going to the main market of Nyanang, I taught the Dharma and gave a long-life empow-erment to all the Nepalis and Tibetans there [387a]. This inspired many Nepali merchants-who every year sacrificed three hundred goats, sheep, chickens and other animals to the Hindu gods-to stop these \"red offerings\" and perform \"white\" ones only. Most of the butchers, too, made a vow to give up slaughter. After I had ransomed the lives of a thousand sheep with eleven dotse, there was no roundup for the slaughter of sheep in the valley that year. All the sheep whose lives I ransomed were set free in the pastures around Pelgyeling Monastery. Their wool was used for the benefit of the sangha-for making cushions and as a source of income. With nine dotse, I bought some thin cloth and some heavy woolen cloth and gave it to those monks who needed robes. Continuing on my way, I paid homage to the \"Speaking Tara\" atLeshing, and made offer-ings and prayers. At Dulung, Baro, and other places in Upper Nyanang, many wealthy fami-447 lies vowed to stop butchering sheep and goats. I thus saved the lives of thousands of animals. As the minds of people in the whole of upper, middle and lower Nyanang turned toward the Dharma, they became imbued with virtue. From Zurtso I reached Lung; I gave a longevity blessing and taught the Dharma to the householders. They presented me with many offerings and I made prayers for dedicating their merit. I went to pay homage and establish a spiri-tual connection with the place where the siddha Tsang Nyon, the Mad Yogin of Tsang,3 had meditated. Passing through the central district of Nyanang, I reached Tingri Langkhor4 and stayed for a while in retreat at the place where Padampa had lived. I read the four large volumes of Padampa's teachings entitled 1he Pacification qf Stiffering5 and, through his blessings, derived immense benefit from them [387b]. I turned the Wheel of the Dharma for Shekar Changwa, Sharlung Tsering, and other patrons of Shingri and Tingri. As result of this, some wealthy patrons who had previously been slaugh-tering two to three hundred sheep a year made a vow henceforth not to kill more than twenty or thirty; those who had been slaughtering twenty or thirty vowed to kill no more than two or three; those who had been killing one or two gave up slaughtering altogether and vowed to eat only the meat they could buy.

The Khampa Tseten of K yidrong gave me two domes of translucent crystal to cover butter-lamps [389a]-each worth a hundred silver coins-a pair ofbinoculars, and a vase filled with water from the Ganges. The chieftain Seh offered me valuables, jewels, and dresses worth seven dotse. A Kothang house-holder's daughter who renounced this life offered me her hair ornaments, worth sixty sang. Like-wise, day after day, faithful monks, nuns, and laypeople offered me dresses and ornaments, as well as many bags of tsampa and pouches of butter, which filled the whole place where we stayed. With all this wealth, I provided supplies for the retreatants staying at Khyemkyichu. Ten to fifteen people were employed to make boxes and loads of tea and butter; still there was some left, which was sold. I also gave food and clothing to the pilgrims who had come from afar. From time to time, we kneaded ten to thirty bags of tsampa, added gum to it, and made it into the shape of a huge Mount Meru, with all its steps and levels. Around it, we arranged many offerings-meat, chang, fruits, and all kinds of food-and offered a large ganachakra feast. The local people sang and danced, and the atmo-sphere of joy and happiness matched that of heaven. I repaired the Great Maitreya Temple of Samling. I placed on its terrace a golden wheel, Return to Central Tibet 449 and inside, in front ofMaitreya, I offered a huge lamp, filled with an ocean of butter and a wick the size of a forearm, which burned day and night. When one entered, the whole temple was warm, ·reminding one of the Jowo Temple of Lhasa [389b]. For all this I spent fifteen dotse. Then I had the treasurer and many monks go and restore the Stupa ofLangkhor, and offered one dotse for the work. Altogether I spent over a year in Tingri. When all the disciples who had come from To and the lamas from Mangnang were leaving, I sang for them this heart-advice: 0 root guru, immensely kind Vajradhara, Father, whose name I hardly dare to pronounce, Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo, Please remain above my head Upon a throne raised by lions, Within a tent of rainbow light. I, your son, ask in fervent supplication: Tum the minds of those gathered here toward the Dharma; Bring to an end all thoughts contrary to the Dharma. All of us assembled here were born in different places, Yet, by the power of our good karma and pure prayers, We have gathered here in this eminent holy place. Having made many connections, spiritual and material, We now depart in all directions--Thus are all things impermanent! From today onward, Even if we look, we will not see one another; Even if we call out, with affection, we won't hear each other. We will have gone off to our respective lands. Separated by great distances, It will be difficult for us to meet again."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"450 The Life of Shabkar I pray that we may meet in future lives; Yet, as we have accumulated diverse karma, good and evil [390a], Will we really meet again? I cannot say. Pondering this, I feel sad from deep within. This joyous gathering of men and gods in this village Was our own unique encounter. You who spontaneously assembled here, Listen to this advice from my heart: How many people have died, old and young, Since your mother bore you? See how many of your acquaintances Now leave this world: Be aware of the fragility oflife. No one lives forever. What is not related to Dharma Is of no use in the next life. Don't simply store up wealth; Make offerings; give alms. Even if you can't practice the Dharma very much, Don't act wrongly. Don't kill, Confess your faults, and refrain from repeating them. At home, avoid animosity and malicious thoughts and actions. Cultivate compassion, gendeness, and generate supreme Bodhicitta. The very essence of all this Is that, even if you can't practice the Dharma And cannot reach the higher realms, At the very least, don't wind up in the hells Through being weighted down by evil actions. This is crucial; keep it in mind. Farewell now-1 shall pray for your good health and long life. We, master and disciples, won't remain either, But will wander from one mountain solitude to another. When the wish to see each other arises, May we meet again and again. If, because of the distances between us, we can't meet again in this life, May we meet in the land of the next. May whoever hears or reads this song embrace the Dharma [390b]; May Dharma practitioners spread throughout the world! After I had sung this, hundreds of disciples departed every day. Seeing how nothing evades impermanence, I was filled with sadness, and so were all those taking leave of each other. We broke camp and made the circumambulation of the sacred place Gyalkyi Shri, \"Splendor of the Conquerors.\" I offered tea and alms to all the monasteries. I requested a longevity blessing from Neuring Lama Rinpoche, who was a hundred years old, and offered him gold and presents. During the circumambulation, I taught the Dharma to the local householders. A few wealthy patrons who used to kill four or five hundred sheep a year (using some for their needs and selling the rest at the market in spring), vowed not to kill more than forty or fifty. Most other people who used to kill sheep offered me their promise to eat only meat that was being sold, but never themselves to slaughter sheep at home. In that way I was able to interrupt a stream of wrong deeds, enhance the stream of virtue, and tum everyone's mind towards the Dharma. Then, I went to Shelkar Chodeh, 7 the 'White Crystal Abode ofDharma,\" and offered, as general property for the monastery, the horse I had been riding on, with its gear. I placed on the top of the monastery a gilded-copper Dharma-wheel and made a general distribution of tea and alms. Everyone was pleased. A few monks invited me to their cells and asked me for"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"teachings to establish a spiritual connection; the wealthy ones among them offered me many sang. Traversing the various districts of this province [39la], I reached Tsogo and Drangso. I give a long-life blessing and taught the Dharma to the lady of Tsogo, the chieftain of Tradeh, and a crowd of householders. I sang songs as well, inspiring people to practice the Dharma. Many proniised to give up killing and practice virtuous deeds. The wealthy local patrons of the area offered gold, silver, clothing, jewelry, and a large amount of barley. Using this, I made a distribu-tion of tea and money to the monastery ofSung-kar Chodeh and offered the barley as provisions for the retreatants of Dechen Phuk, the Cave of Great Bliss. Then I gave empowerments and taught the Dharma to the wealthy patron Shulung Gonpo and to all the local people. They offered me a lot of food, gold, silver, brocades, jewelry and other valuables. I went to the household of Phumar Bartso, a wealthy, good-hearted person inclined toward the Dharma. I gave teachings and bless-ings to him and his people, and prayed that auspiciousness might reign. They promised not to kill more than fifty sheep a year, instead of five hundred. They offered us all the tea and butter we could have wished for, as well as amber, corals, turquoise, and gold and silver ornaments. I invited lama Rinpoche of Gonchang and requested him to give me the empowerments for the Gathering of the Awareness Holders, the Great Compassionate One, and the Wrath.fol Guru from the Northem T erma [391 b]. 8 I presented him with some silk, gold, and turquoise. When I was on the point ofleaving I gave the following advice to all the householders: Lord guru, my everlasting refuge and protector, Remaining as my crown ornament, Look upon me with compassion And on all these disciples and patrons, And grant your blessing. Faithful, generous, and intelligent patron Phumar Bartso, Listen to this helpful advice from my heart. Return to Central Tibet 451 Now that you have gained a precious human life, If you don't hurry to practice the divine Dharma, Remember: in this dark age, life's duration is uncertain-you may even die tonight. One who has acted virtuously Will go on to the higher realms of freedom; One who has acted wrongly, Will go on to the threefold lower realms. The power to choose your course Is now in your hands. Forsake negative deeds, which will drag you down, And diligendy pursue positive deeds, which will lead to the higher realms. Among all unvirtuous actions, Taking life is the worst; Give it up as you would give up poison. Stinginess with your own wealth-Covetousness toward the wealth of others--Anger and hatred, always senseless-Jealousy and a competitive mind-All these you should shun. With remorse, confess your past misdeeds And promise not to commit them again. Among all virtuous actions, Offerings and generosity are foremost-Perform them at all times. Be kind to your servants and attendants; Be helpful to your neighbors [392a]; Don't beat your cattle and the dog at your door, But take good care of them.

I then reached the great monastic estate of the Glorious Sakya. I met the elder Jetsunma and the throne-holders Kunga Gyaltsen and Ngodrup Pelbar.9 I offered them pairs of long copper trumpets, of cymbals, and of gyalings, and some gold, silver, turquoise, corals, and other valuables. I requested the empowerments oflon-gevity, ofVajrakilaya, and of the Wrathful Guru. I filled with butter the lamp of solid gold that I had earlier entrusted the treasurer Depa W angpo to offer there on my behalf, and made extensive prayers. I made offerings in all the other temples, and arranged a distribution of tea and alms to the whole monastic community. I stayed fifteen days, doing prostrations and circumambulations, and witnessed the Great Thread-cross cer-emony.10 From Sakya I went to Chang Lhatse and stayed for two days in the great landlord Tanagpa's house. I gave him a long-life blessing. He offered me tea, butter, silver and many other things [392b]. Then I reached the Yonpo Valley of Gyang and stayed there a couple of months. Hundred of patrons of Gyang I.hatse came to me, and in the course of time, giving them long-life blessings and teachings, I could tum their minds towards the Dharma. They presented me with many offerings. Lama Perna Rangclrol, accompanied by many others, arrived from Dorney. Offering me a hundred Chinese silver coins and many valu-ables of all kinds, he asked for a longevity bless-ing. I gave him an empowerment according to the tradition of the \"Sole Mother Queen of the Siddhas,\"11 establishing auspicious connections for his long life. I also gave him this advice: I bow down to the gurus and the Three Jewels, To theyidom deities, dakinis, and Dharma protectors: Grant the accomplishment of all our aspi-rations. I became filled with joy when I heard That, by the compassion of the guru and the Threejewels, You, the great spiritual son Perna Rangclrol, Gifted with faith, diligence, intelligence, and compassion, Together with the physician Nyerwa And other worthy disciples, sons of my heart, Had reached the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang Through the northern road, without suffering any harm or trouble, And, after having paid homage to the two Crowned Buddhas of Lhasa, To Samye and to Tashi Lhunpo, were heading for this place. I, the old man, have not yet died. I went round many countries and many a wilderness-The precious Snow Mountain, Nepal, Lapchi, and others-And have now again reached central Tibet. As if timely appointments had been made, Owing to my good karma and past prayers, I was able to visit the Yonpo Valley of Gyang, The great master Padmasambhava's supreme place of accomplishment. Everything, filled with auspiciousness, occurred in harmony with the Dharma [393a]. Paying homage to that place, I felt great JOy."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"E rna! Worthy spiritual sons of mine, There are so many things to see And to which to pay respect In this Pure Realm of U-Tsang! Why would you go back home? Stay for a year or so; That would be the greatest good fortune. We would talk at ease and at length, And I would gradually give some helpful heart -advice. Since, however, you must return this year To serve your teacher and benefit beings in Dorney, Prepare everything carefully for the JOUrney. Just as, now, all of us yogins, master and disciples, Part again, all phenomena are impermanent. Reflect upon this and practice the holy Dharma. If you long wholeheartedly to practice the Dharma, Empty your mind of the eight worldly concerns, Keep pure vows and samayas, And practice diligently according to your lama's instructions. Whenever we, Dharma practitioners, master and disciples, Long to encounter each other during the remainder of our lives, May we meet as we did today. In these degenerate times, our hold on life is so fragile! If because of great distances between us We cannot meet in this same life, May we meet in the next. Mter Perna Rangdrol had described the worthy commitments to the Dharma and sen-tient beings that called him back to Dorney, I gave him my permission to leave. Return to Central Tibet 453 With them, I sent a letter to the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo's son, Wang Tashi Jungne, 12 \"Royal Fountainhead of Auspicious-ness,\" asking him to come and visit the holy places of U and Tsang, in keeping with the excellent tradition ofhis forefathers: I present this letter at the feet of the Chingwang, king of Mongolia, The supreme benefactor of the Buddha's teaching [393b], Whose fame resounds to all horizons Like the thundering summer dragon. Prompted by the keen affection I nourish for you from afar, I, Tsogdruk Rangdrol, who am linked with you through my good karma and past prayers, Submit these few words to you. Although both the Dharma King and his consort have gone on to another Buddhafield, 0 supreme being, you now hold the kingdom. Hearing how you have established The whole land in peace, I feel boundless JOy. Owing to the Dharma King's kindness, I am well in body and mind, free from all suffering, Filled with joy in the Pure Realm of U-Tsang. At the same time I am filled with sadness, Since both the Dharma King and his consort Have departed for the Pure Realms. Life is short and fragile: It is time for you to practice the divine Dharma!

If now, when you are young, you don't come, You will regret it when you grow old. It would be best if you came now. Come, in the midst of your youth. In the past, when your supreme mother, Abhe, Came to central Tibet, she made such vast offerings And distributed tea and alms to such an extent. That her fame spread across the whole land. You, supreme being, her son, Ought in the same way to make large offerings, To offer tea, and distribute alms. Such is my feeling; keep it in your heart. When the Dharma King and his consort Came to central Tibet, They encountered neither hardship nor hindrances And could accomplish all their noble aims. Owing to the auspicious links they thus created, It is certain that if you come to central Tibet [394a] You will meet no difficulties or obstacles. All favorable conditions will be gathered, And you will accomplish your aims. Earlier, I, the old man, offered Ceremonies for your long life, to the best of my ability. I shall continue to do so in the most careful way, And pray to meet you before long. Wherever these words are heard, May auspiciousness and abundance be conferred upon the land, May people enjoy long lives free of illness, And may all their aspirations be fulfilled in accord with the Dharma. I sent him this letter with some presents-a gold coin and a rosary made of turquoise, corals, and other precious jewels. When Perna Rangdrol was about to leave, praying that we meet again and again, I presented him with sacred objects of body, speech, and mind, a khatvanga trident from India, one silver dotse, turquoise, corals and other precious stones. At this time, the chief merchant Sonam Rabgye offered me much gold. Instead of accepting it, I offered it back to him, telling him to add whatever was needed and offer a lamp of solid gold before the speaking image of Guru Padmasambhava (thus called because it actually spoke on several occasions) at the top temple of Riwo Trazang.13 Accordingly, Sonam Rabgye made a lamp with twenty sang of gold and offered, too, a fund so that the lamp would always be replenished with butter and bum day and night. I also made extensive dedication prayers. I visited Gyang Bumoche, 14 offered some butter-lamps [394b], and continued on to Drangmoche where I offered tea and alms and stayed overnight. In this area, the Tsangpo River often flooded and damaged the monastery and the rest of the valley. The next day, on the way to Chang Lhatse, I erected a placard with an exhortation to the Three Protectors15 and conse-crated it, visualizing that the waters were diverted to another direction, and uttering verses calling for the power of truth to act. Later, by the com-passion of the Three Jewels, the course of the river changed and the valley and monastery were safe. \"This is a miraculous feat,\" said the people, and their faith increased. I was invited to visit the chieftain Tako, who offered me a golden gargira pinnacle brought from China, some gold, silver, tsampa, and an abundance of food and valuables. I placed the ganjira atop one of the temples of Chang Lhatse, and offered tea and alms to the monastic community. In return, the monastery gave me much help. Continuing on to Tsarong I spent a few days at Mengon, where I offered a longevity"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"blessing to Choying Drolma-the patroness of Tsarong, 16 a faithful noblewoman who al-ways carried the Three Jewels as her crown ornament and persevered in virtuous deeds-and to all the local householders. I then gave her teaching on the nature of mind, ending with this advice: Lord root guru, Vajradhara, through your blessing May inner experiences and realization anse. Listen, faithful Choying Drohna, I shall tell you how to maintain the recognition of mind's nature: Rest without making efforts In the expanse of clear emptiness, Like a great garuda soaring through the skies. Leave your mind as a brilliant radiance Like the sun free from clouds. Let mind's vivid cognition be free of clinging Like a young child looking inside a temple. Let your mind rest in serene, vast cahnness, Like an ocean free of waves [395a]. Let thoughts vanish without a trace, Like a bird's flight that leaves no trace in the sky. If you meditate as I have explained, Meditation experiences and realization will arise like this: An experience of transparent emptiness will arise, Ineffable--just as space is ungraspable, indefmable. An experience of clarity will arise, Indescribable--like the dream of a mute. Return to Central Tibet 455 An experience ofbliss will arise, Inexpressible--like the blissful pleasure of a young girl. An experience of non-thought will arise, Conceptless-like a corpse abandoned in a charnel ground. Do not have any attachment Toward whichever experience arises-Bliss, clarity, or non-thought. Simply allow it to remain in its vividness. If you preserve the natural state of mind in this way, At the moment of death you will be liberated in the dharmakaya. Do not forget this advice, keep it at the core of your heart; May it benefit the minds of all those who hear it. This was helpful to all those assembled there. The elder and younger noblewomen and all the local people offered amber, pearls, corals, tur-quoises worth two hundred sang, and many bags of tsampa. Having made pure prayers of dedica-tion, I distributed the tsampa to five hundred monks and sent all the butter to Tashi Lhunpo as an offering. Since I sent someone every two or three days, the inhabitants of Shigatse and the monks ofTashi Lhunpo started to ask, \"Who are all these people?\" \"l.ama Shabkar is coming; those are his monks,\" they were told. People wondered [395b], ''What does l.ama Shabkar look like? We must see him.\" On the way to Shigatse, I visited Ngor Mon-astery, 17 met the throne-holder and, having pre-sented him with some offerings, requested a spiritual connection. I offered tea and alms to all, and placed in the temple a large lamp made out of one dotse of Chinese silver. When fmally we reached Shigatse, to my great amazement about three thousand people--monks of Tashi lhunpo, patrons, and house-holders-had gathered on both sides of the road to see us coming."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"456 The Life of Shabkar At Shigatse, I stayed at Guru Changrna and, for many days, received many visitors, who offered me ceremonial scarves and coins.18 I went to meet the Refuge and Protector, Panchen Rinpoche, at Tashi Kunkhyap Ling, the Abode of All Encompassing Auspiciousness. I presented to him one horse, two dotse, a large crystal dome for covering butter-lamps worth a hundred silver coins, and many other precious things. At T ashi Lhunpo, I offered in front of the golden reliquar-ies of Panchen Lobzang Y eshe and Panchen Palden Y eshe a large begging bowl gilded with three sang of gold, worth five dotse, and a big lamp made out of one dotse of silver. I offered tea and one coin to each of the thirty-eight hundred monks of the monastery. One day, Panchen Rinpoche called me into his presence and said, \"Bearing in mind the benefit of the Dharma and sentient beings, you restored the Great Stupa ofBodhnath. That was an excellent thing [396a]. Now, the Great Stupa of Many Gates of Auspiciousness, Tashi Go-mang, at Chung Riwoche, 19 which was erected by the siddha Thangtong Gyalpo, the \"King of the Empty Plains,\" to avert the invasions coming from Mongolia and western Tibet, and to bring peace and benefit to the Dharma in central Tibet, has been damaged by the depredations of time. Its thirteen rings have been destroyed by fire. With a pure motivation, you should go and restore it.\" Having accepted his command, I prostrated myself and requested his spiritual protection. Praying to the Three Jewels, he put a long silken scarf around my neck, and when I took leave, said, \"Muster your diligence and accomplish this task without discouragement. Today, auspicious connections have been established through your past pure prayers and aspirations; there is no doubt that you will succeed in your endeavor.\" Confident in the truth of his words, instead of continuing on my journey I retraced my steps. On the way, I stopped a few days at Kagye, visiting the holy places, and finally reached Chung Riwoche. As I was getting things ready for the restoration work, Kunzang Nyentrak Rinpoche, a lama with a gende nature from Dronla, who lived in perfect harmony with the Dharma, ar-rived with many monks. He offered me fifteen gold slw, a hundred coins of silver, pieces of coral and turquoise, and a few silver reliquaries, request-ing a spiritual connection. I offered him some teachings and a blessing of longevity. He also asked for advice, and I sang this song: I bow down at your feet, protector [396b], Lord guru, Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo. Gaze lovingly upon us; Bless me and all my disciples. 0 lama from Dronla in the north, You obtained this precious, jewel-like human body, Met many precious authentic teachers, And practiced the teachings-how fortunate you are! There is no happiness in samsara. Especially, there is no meaning in accumulating wealth. Life is short and can end at any time. Henceforth, give up all concern for this life And remain in mountain solitudes. Pray to your lama from the core of your heart And, without fixation, rest your mind in luminous emptiness. Foster compassion for all sentient beings, your mothers. To practice Dharma, one does not need many instructions. Keep these in your heart, dear lama! I pray to behold your face many times agam, From now until we reach enlightenment. May the Buddha's teaching flourish And may happiness befall all beings, our mothers! In the fifth month of the Wood-Monkey Year,20 with the treasurer Kalzang Trinley, Ladakh Khenpo, and the chieftain Tako as"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"supervisors, about six hundred monks, nuns, and pilgrims began the work on the stupa. At one point the number of workers exceeded one thou-sand. Everyone worked in a playful and joyous mood, and soon the restoration of the entire stupa was completed, from top to bottom, within and without. We placed at the top thirteen rings and a ganjira pinnacle, all made of copper cov-ered with gold. Mter this, about six hundred monks spent days in the waters of the Tsangpo River piling up stones to raise the sagging iron bridge [397a]. Eventually, in the eighth month, the work was completed. On the festive day when I performed the consecration of the Great Stupa, about three thousand people gathered there--monks, nuns, and laypeople. We offered a ganachakra feast with ftfty loads of tsampa, and I distributed alms to everyone--twenty-five dotse worth. As a contribution for these restorations, Lama Kalden Rangdrol offered ftfty dotse, Lama Jimba Norbu forty, Lama Gangriwa thirty, and the chieftain T ako a hundred sho of gold. Alto-gether, the disciples, patrons, and devoted house-holders · made offerings amounting to seven hundred dotse; they are described in detail in the Bright Mirror Record. 21 First the stupa was perfectly erected, Second the stupa was perfectly restored, Third dedication prayers were perfectly made: Thus everything was perfect in the beginning, middle, and end.

With utter veneration, I prostrate myself To the Victors, the Father and the Son, And to all the great beings Who skillfully spread the Buddha's teachings. I pray with perpetual devotion To my root master, Whose kindness surpasses even that of the Buddha: Protect me until I reach enlightenment! Many years have passed since I, the renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, carne here. Now, I am old, close to death. Even if I don't die now, I will not stay; I am leaving for Dorney. Just as, among worldly people, a departing father Gives a last admonition to his children, So, with great tenderness, I shall now give some last advice To all of you, faithful ones. Listen! \"Keeping in mind the life-examples of the holy beings of the past, I have wandered at random through many lands, pleasant dwell-ings, and mountain solitudes. A free, happy, and relaxed renunciate, I have pondered the flaws of samsara's cycle of births and deaths, and renounced the affairs of this life. \"In the beginning, I followed an authentic master and received the depth and breadth ofhis instructions [398b]; in the middle, I put these instructions into practice in mountain retreats; and in the end I benefited the Dharma and sentient beings as best I could. Especially, with the welfare of the Dharma and sentient beings in mind, I offered a mantle of precious gold to the thirteen rings of the Great Stupa of Bodhnath. Likewise, I have now offered a canopy, a pinnacle, and thirteen rings of gilded copper to the Tashi Gomang Stupa Ifl don't die now but live longer, I will go to Lower Kham to turn toward the Dharma the minds of the faithful. Here is my advice while I am alive, my testament when I am dead: \"Every day of your lives, remember that phenomena are impermanent, unreliable, and essenceless. Especially remember that life is short and that death may strike at any time: the last part of our lives may last no longer than the sun setting on a mountain pass. Don't take for granted that you will live long; instead, having thought, 'lfl am going to die within a few days, what is the best thing to do now?' persevere day and night in Dharma practice-the best provision you can make for next life. This is a crucial point. \"If you can't practice Dharma intensively, under no circumstances should you commit evil deeds such as taking life. At all times, cultivate compassion for sentient beings, your mothers, and have a good heart. Make vast aspirations for the sake ofbeings. If you do, the sun ofhappiness will doubtlessly shine upon this life and all your lives to come [399a]. \"May we--master, disciples, and patrons-enjoy well-being in this and in future lives. Even-tually, meeting in a Pure Realm, may we travel together to millions ofBuddhafields, make offer-"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"ings to the Buddhas, and bring all beings there. This is the sincere prayer I make. ''With my messengers, I send blessed im-ages to touch on the crowns of your heads, pro-tection cords to put around your necks, sacred substances to put in your mouths, and heart-advice for you to hear. When these reach you, feel the same joy as if we had met in reality! I feiVently pray from my heart To the Dharma King, Ngakyi Wangpo: With the eyes of compassion look upon me And upon all my disciples and patrons; Grant your blessing. Disciples, worthy children of my heart, And you, faithful patrons Of the Three Provinces ofNgari in west-em Tibet, Listen to this beneficial heart-advice. I, the yogin Shabkarpa, Wandering at random through various countries, Staying in delightful mountain retreats, Left my native land behind And came to the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang. Thus I spent fifteen years In the Three Provinces ofNgari in To, And in the four districts ofU and Tsang. During these years, I was able to accom-plish many religious activities. Recalling these, I feel extremely fortunate [399b]. Now that I am old, I thought of staying In this celestial field of central Tibet. But this year, many devotees came from Dorney Insisting that I come to benefit beings In the Three Ranges ofDomey.22 They repeated their request so earnestly That, feeling pity for them, I let a promise escape my lips. Henceforth, if I don't die and live longer, In order to help other beings Return to Central Tibet 459 I will surely, step by step, Go to distant, secluded mountains, Such as the Five-peaked Mountain of China. Once I have gone, it seems that we will not meet again in this life. Therefore, if we don't meet this one last time, In the future, it will be difficult Even to hear news of one another, let alone to meet. It is like a death. Just as a kind, loving mother Always thinks of the child gone off to a distant land Whom she may not see again, and whom she yearns to meet, So when I am on the eve ofleaving for Dorney, A place in which I shall never see you agam, I would like to meet you once more, disciples and patrons. Therefore, I entreat those who truly want to see me one last time, To come, within the Bird Year, to the Pure Realm of central Tibet. I shall pray that all those who come Encounter no difficulty at home and on the road, Find favorable conditions, and see their aspirations fulfilled. For most of you-those who yearn to come, yet are not able to do so Because of the long distance to travel or adverse circumstances [400a]-I am sending this letter and news. In accordance with the lama's word, persevere in the divine Dharma. I shall pray for you in such a way That it will be the same as if you had come and met me."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"460 The Life of Shabkar In all our births to come, May we, master and disciples, whose minds have merged as one, Meet in the Buddhafield of Pure Joy, in the Blissful Buddhafield, Or in any other Pure Realm of our wishes. Here I offer you this letter, These verses of heart-advice, meant to help you. May all those who read it or hear it, Enjoy a long life free of illness; May the Dharma and auspiciousness increase! Following this letter, most of my disciples and patrons did come and we met before my depar-ture for Dorney. On the way back from Chung Riwoche, I visited most of the districts up to the end of that valley, such as Tharpa Ling Rinchen Ding. At Chang Lhatse I also went to the estate of the chieftain Taka, and to most of the other villages in the area. To all, I gave teachings and sang spiritual songs, inspiring them to practice the Dharma. Before leaving, as the chieftain Taka (a person of great faith, generosity, and intelligence) and his wife requested some spiritual advice. I told them this: I remember you always and supplicate you, 0 divine master whose kindness Is greater than that of the Buddhas of the three times. Make all our aspirations come true! Taka, wealthy benefactor of the Dharma, And you, divine lady gifted with faith [400b], Listen to this useful heart-advice. Birth ends in death, gathering in separation, Accumulation in exhaustion, and rise in fall. There is no substance to samsaric dharmas; Strive from your heart in the divine Dharma. In the best case, to attain Buddhahood in this very life, As the yoginjetsun Milarepa did, Banish all concern with this existence alone And spend your whole life practicing in solitary places. In the middling case, to go to a Buddhafield at death, Guard your vows and samayas purely, And stay in a monastery, exerting yourself in religious practice. In the least case, to obtain another human birth, Like the householder Anathapindika23 Even though you live at home, Work hard at doing prostrations and circumambulations, And at making offerings, giving charity, and saying prayers. In essence, don't fuel discursive thoughts. At all times and in all circumstances Let your mind rest in the state of luminous void, And develop vast compassion and a good heart. I, \"White Foot,\" a wanderer, Having spoken this helpful advice, set out on my way; You who remain should never forget it But keep it in mind. If, because of the great distance between us, We don't meet again in this life, May we meet in our future lives And remain together in a Pure Realm. They did many prostrations and circum-ambulations, praying that we would meet many times again, and presented me with many offer-mgs. From there, I visited Ganden Phuntsokling,24 the seat of the omniscientjonangpa,Jetsun Tara-natha, where I offered tea and alms to the monks."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"From the wooden blocks there, I had printed a set of the eighteen volumes ofTaranatha's writ-ings, and took it with me [40la]. I then paid homage at the great statue ofMaitreya at Drophu in Botong Tashigang, and offered tea and alms. Finally I came back to Tashi Ilmnpo, where I met the supreme all-knowing Panchen Lama. I offered him the copper and the other materials left over from the stupa's restoration, as well as two fme horses and all the gold, silver, amber, coral, turquoise, and everything else I had been offered while helping beings along the way. I requested a spiritual connection from him, and with great kindness he gave me a longevity em-powerment, and the transmission for the teach-ings on the Graded Path and on Mind Training found in the writings of the former Panch ens. He also gave me about fifty volumes-the collected writings of Lord Tsongkhapa and his two chief disciples, and the writings of the successive Panchen incarnations-and a painting of Chakrasamvara that had been hanging in his room, a yellow shawl that had belonged to the former Panchen I.a.ma, and many \"seven-re-birth pills.\"25 He also gave to me, and to four of my students, a monk's jacket, protection cords, ceremonial scarves, and many other presents. Especially he gave me this letter for the general benefit of the Dharma and all beings in Dorney: Here is a proclamation from the Shakya bhikshu, Lobzang Palden Tenpai Nyima Chogle Namgyal, \"Intelligent All-Victorious Sun of the Glorious Doctrine,\" someone with perfect cour-age for holding and spreading the unbroken tradition of the Fourth Buddha of this fortunate aeon, the Matchless Companion of the Sun: This is a message for those on this earth who enjoy the mandala of intelligence [ 401 b ]-the treasure-lode of this world-and especially for the lamas, teachers, and ordained persons; for the notables who hold the rank, according to the golden edicts of the great Emperor, ofWang,26 Pi'i ling, Pa'i ling, Gung, Jasag, Miring, Jagi Rukshi, Thabunang,Jesang, Misang, Dorokha, and for the inhabitants, religious and lay, high and low, of the forty-nine districts of Mongolia, of the shore of Lake Trishok Gyalmo, Xining, Return to Central Tibet 461 Tongkhor, the Six Ranges ofDokham, Golok, Rang Ngen, Arik, and other places: May the sole source of happiness, The Buddha's Dharma, long remain. In accordance with these words, the ground and support for the present happiness and ulti-mate felicity of all beings is indubitably the pre-cious teachings of the Victorious Ones-the teachings themselves and the realization that stems from them. For the Dharma to remain, the Tripitaka needs to be heard and contem-plated by the sangha, and the Three Trainings need to be meditated upon. The renunciate Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol has been acting in accordance with the Dharma in an exalted way since his youth. Not only that, within our land enclosed by snow peaks, at many extraordinary sacred places and mountain soli-tudes he has exerted himself in the contempla-tive practice of the teachings he heard. More especially, as means to avert foreign invasions, he restored the Great Stupa of Glori-ous Riwoche erected by Thangtong Gyalpo [ 402a], which had been damaged over the course of time. As the fruit of his pure prayers and his lofty intelligence, with the purest motivation he has restored the Tashi Gomang Stupa, the . temple around it, and whatever else needed repair, exhorting to virtue everyone in upper, central, and western Tibet. To the stupa, above the main structure, he offered thirteen rings and a canopy, all made of gilded copper and exe-cuted in the fmest and most complete way. In many monasteries and holy sites, he has placed new victory banners and Dharma-wheels of copper gilt. He has made large offerings, including ritual implements made of precious substances, to the twoJowos-the Crowned Bud-dhas ofLhasa-the precious golden reliquary of the second Dalai Lama, and other sacred objects and relics of the three kinds. He has made clouds of offerings and given service to all religious communities without making any sectarian dis-tinctions: in essence, he has accomplished splen-did and mighty virtuous acts which fulfill the intentions of the Victorious Ones and set the"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"462 The Life of Shabkar fmest kind of example for all beings. He has thus become an object of praise. Wherever he goes and whatever he does in upper, central, and western Tibet, for the good of all, everyone, high and low, should assist him by providing him food, housing, a place to rest, and whatever else he might need. You must listen to his admonition to give up all acts of enmity, [402b] banditry, theft, and other ac-tions that harm sentient beings and to his en-treaties to perform virtuous deeds. This is to be understood by all. I shall always keep in my prayers, and under my spiritual protection, those who act according to this com-mand. Those who transgress it will, without doubt, suffer fierce punishments from the ocean of oath-bound protectors. Be careful! This letter, clear in meaning, was written on an auspicious day in the twelfth month of the Wood-Monkey Year,27 from the Lofty Banner of the All-Victorious Palace, at the great monas-tery ofTashi Lhunpo. Having affixed his great seal on this decree, he gave it to me rolled up in three lengths of yellow brocade. When taking leave, I asked him never to cast me out from his spiritual protection and to pray that I might be able to meet him again. He did so, adding, \"Come back soon, and we will meet.\" Then, accompanied by five hundred monks and nuns, I went to Nyamo where the chieftains Tenpa, Drupchen Chadar, and Chala were most helpful. I performed a longevity blessing, taught the Dharma, and made prayers of dedication and auspiciousness. Through Rongchung, we then reached Nyemo. The chieftain Kachagpa offered over a hundred bags of tsampa, and others made many offerings, too [403a]. We offered a vast ganachakra feast and distributed the tsampa. Carrying whatever they could, one after the other, all my companions reached lhasa. I stayed behind and gave long-life blessings and teachings, inspiring all the householders to practice the Dharma. Many patrons, such as the chieftain Mariam and the administrator ofKalon Thanpa's estate, gave me provisions and valuables; many of them became Dharma practitioners. I then went to Rina Monastery where I met our root teacher, Orgyen Tendzin Rinpoche,28 to whom I offered five slw of gold. I also offered tea and alms to the monks. Arriving at lliasa, I stayed at the house of Kalan Ztrrkhang, who offered me exceptional help-whatever could be needed--and became among all my patrons the one toward whom I felt the greatest gratitude. At that time, Khenpo Shiwa Tsering suf-fered from edema and was close to death. I performed many curative ceremonies and gave him some medicine. He recovered. To express his thanks, he offered me two dotse, which I contributed for alms to be distributed at the Great Prayer Festival of lhasa. One day I went to behold the golden face of the Refuge and Protector, the Dalai Lama Tsultrim Gyatso.29 I offered him the mandala and sacred objects symbolic of the body, speech, and mind of the Buddhas; a large, transparent glass dome made in a distant country, to place over a butter-lamp; one dotse of gold; and other valuables worth five dotse [403b]. I requested from him the transmission of the Prayer to the Lords of the Three Families and of the Praise of Dependent Arising. 30 Following this I went to meet the regent-king of Tibet, Tseman Lingpa,31 and presented with him a pair of binoculars and one dotse, asking him for a spiritual connection. Then I gave a long-life empowerment to my hosts, the family of Kalan Zurkhang. I was also called to the houses of Kalan Thanpa, Samdrup Phodrang, the Dalai Lama's mother Dandrup Drolma, and Khenpo Chakzampa; to all, I gave longevity blessings and taught the Dharma as well as I knew how. Pleased, they presented with me many dotse, which I offered for distribution at the Great Prayer Festival of lhasa. From the Muslims and Nepalese merchants, down to the poor people living in the hom-fence huts, 32 who-ever called upon me, I answered their requests, went to their homes, and said prayers of auspi-ciousness. They offered many silver coins. I also gave this advice for long life to all the patrons: I bow down with respect to all the deities of longevity,"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Who have achieved deathlessness: Please make finn the lives of all those Who accomplish spiritual deeds.

In our time there are many obstacles to life, Return to Central Tibet 463 Therefore do these recitations and you will live long! May whoever hears and reads this excel-lent advice Enjoy the happiness of a long and healthy life. Most of them followed this advice and lived a long time. Many disciples with good karmic tendencies, able to help beings and to serve the Dharma, such as Tendzin Nyima from Togar and Tendzin Rangdrol from Nyemo, came at this time. I gave them empowerments and instructions, thus setting them on the path of maturation and liberation. All my monks and nuns did fasting practices and made many cir-cumambulations of the two Jowos, drawing the admiration of all the faithful. Mter we had stayed one month in Lhasa, I went to Khardo Samten Ling, 33 the wondrous seat of my kind root master, the lord of siddhas Khardo Chokyi Dorje Rinpoche [ 404b]. This sacred place was fust blessed by an heir ofjetsun Mila's lineage, the precious Shang Yudrak Gonpo,34 whose fame resounded in all direc-tions. Having paid great service to the Jowo of Lhasa and established many monastic commu-nities in this area, Yudrak Gonpo came to stay in this sacred place ofK.hardo. He performed splen-did deeds for the sake of the Dharma and all beings, and caused the Kagyu teachings to shine like the sun. Then came the fifth Dal~i Lama, the pro-tector ofTibet, Avalokiteshvara in human form, who, having brought everything under his power in an overwhelming way, 35 made the tradition of the great lord Tsongkhapa become as bright as the sun. At the time of the sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, Desi Rinpoche36 built in Khardo a residence resembling the gem atop the victory banner, and the Dalai Lama came and blessed the place. Sopa Gyatso, 37 who gained matchless real-ization through the great prayers he made for the tradition of the Great Lord, lived in Khardo for a long time. ExemplifYing the perfect lives of liberation of the Kadampas, he vastly benefited"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"464 The Life of Shabkar the Dharma and all beings, established a retreat center, and erected many sacred objects sym-bolic of the enlightened body, speech, and mind. He took rebirth as Choden Wangpo, who him-self was reborn as the lord of siddhas, Chokyi Dorje [405a]. Both of them devoted themselves to the essence of spiritual practice and, as a result, could vastly benefit the Dharma and all beings. Many other great beings also came to this holy place, conquered the stronghold of unwa-vering inner calm, and, catapulting the boulder of unerring insight, pulverized their archenemies: the five confusions, the eight worldly dharmas, and the misconception that beings and phenomena are real. Thus Khardo Samten Ling, the \"Stone Cita-del of Contemplation,\" lived up to its name. The place has excellent qualities: facing south, it basks in the sun all year; it remains cool in summer so that mind is clear. Water, fire-wood, and other necessities abound. At its back is a beautiful and lofty rock mountain; to the east is a colony of vultures, which reminds the· renunciates and meditators of death and of the need to remain steadfast in their caves, meditat-ing. Pleasant caves of all sizes form beautiful roofs; from time to time mist wreaths the mountain's neck like a silver scari Those gifted with good predispositions stemming from their former purification long to take mist as their clothing and caves as hats. Meadows of medici-nal plants are strewn with multicolored flowers in which bees buzz their songs, inviting skilled physicians to collect medicinal leaves, flowers, and fruits [405b]. The place is immaculate, with fragrant odors, bright smooth stones, fmely shaped hills, and a lofty summit from which one can see far and wide, inviting the families of noblemen and the young Nepalese merchants to come in the sum-mer for joyful picnics. The cattle herded by the nomad tribes in the meadows up the hill feed on grasses full of strong medicinal herbs. Drinking the curd and whey that comes from the milk of the cows thus cures most illnesses of wind, bile, and phlegm. As they sit, relax, or wander about the slopes, shep-herds sing witty songs, making the practitioners who live on the mountain laugh. Springs of pure water with eight excellent qualities continuously fill ponds in which tad-poles and other water creatures are gracefully moving. The water is cool, and just a sip of it quenches one's thirst. It is perfectly pure; bathing in it cleanses the body and gives a feeling of well-being one has never felt before. Amid the crags and on the high meadows, wild sheep, musk deer, and many other wild animals live at ease, their young gamboling play-fully. Snow cocks, celestial laughing-thrushes, and many other lovely birds, fly happily from place to place, singing sweetly [406a], bringing such delight to those who arrive here that they feel compelled to stay a few days. In summer, between the fourth and fifth months, the blue cuckoo arrives. The cuckoo, the king ofbirds, shows off his beauty as it moves about, calling out sweetly, reminding people of the homelands they've left behind; thinking of home, they also think back to when they spent time talking with their kind old parents. The cuckoo's poignant call also makes meditators, who have renounced this life in order to wander through the mountain wilderness, recall vividly the abode of their root lama and the teachings he gave. \"This is what the lama said; those were the spiritual companions with pure samaya who were there; such were the spiritual conversations we shared, the jokes we enjoyed.\" Melancholy arises, and tears well up in their eyes. There are plenty of edible plants here-nettles, wild garlic, bitter roots, and berries-nourishing and succulent, which makes the hermits recall Milarepa's life and thus appreciate the fortunate opportunity of a simple and aus-tere life. It is wonderful to see the temples and the sacred relics of body, speech, and mind they shelter-they are supreme objects of offering and prostration, inspiring those who live here to perfect the accumulations of merit and wisdom easily by making offerings, prostrations, and circumambulations [ 406b]. On the sides of the hills are other pleasant hermitages where one's awareness becomes clear. Those are inhabited by spiritual teachers and companions who prac-tice in harmony with the Dharma and give what-"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"ever initiations and instructions beginners may need to dispel obstacles and to progress. Down in the valley is the pleasant city of lhasa, where all desirable things, food and wealth, are gathered, ensuring that whatever one needs for one's sustenance will come of its own accord. Brought together by our pure aspirations and good karma, I, the wandering yogin Shab-karpa, and my disciples came to this perfect place. When, following my teacher's word, I was meditating in the Great Cavern ofBrilliant Light where Khardo Sopa Gyatso practiced in the past, I was driven by sheer enthusiasm to sing this praise in verse: Lama who grants all blessings, Yidam deities who grant all siddh.is, Dakinis who dispel all obstacles: Rain upon us blessings and siddhis. Near the Emanated Temple oflhasa, The peer of the Diamond Throne of India; Near the Potala Palace, the seat of Avalokiteshvara, The protector of the Land ofSnows; Near many monastic communities, Such as Sera, Ganden, and Drepung, Lies the secluded hermitage of Khardo Samten Ling, Where the Dharma of spiritual practice blooms [407a], Where many wise and realized beings live, Where dakinis and Dharma protectors assemble, Where gods who delight in virtue abide. The many-colored mountainside, An excellent, unsullied site, Faces south, offering a vast, open view: In summer, the fragrant breeze is cooling; In winter, basking in sun all day, the mountainside stays warm. Behind it, cliffs rise up, lofty and majestic; On one side is a colony of vultures That make the mountain hermits think, \"This is the kind of place we need!\" Return to Central Tibet 465 It is wrapped in silvery mists, And is capped becomingly with many caves That make one want to wear Mist as a mantle and a cave as a hat. On the slopes are grasslands With thickets of medicinal plants And meadows blanketed with bright flowers-Physicians come here to collect medicinal herbs. The mountain is rich in colors; Its range unfolds in splendid shapes. Climbing to the summit, one can see far and wide. This is why noble families and merchants Come here to enjoy pleasant excursions. The nomads' cows eat potent medicinal herbs, And therefore drinking their curd and whey Naturally cures most diseases. Shepherds, here and there on the moun-tain, Sing spirited songs that make renunciates Meditating nearby burst out in laughter. The pure, fresh, limpid springs nearby Are enlivened by tadpoles and other tiny creatures. Just by drinking or bathing in this water, Well-being increases and awareness becomes clear. All kinds of wild animals frolic there [407b]; Large and small birds emit sweet calls-Whoever comes here is enchanted, And wishes nothing more but to stay on.

By the merit of having praised this holy place, May Dharma practitioners remain in mountain retreats! May all countries enjoy good harvests! May everyone practice the Dharma! I stayed nine months in this place, persever-ing in practice. In between sessions, I composed the Ama.d.ng Emanated Scripture, 38 a treatise that leads one to consider the flaws of the five sense pleasures in general, and especially the craving for food, clothing, and sex. It then tells of the need to rid oneself of the preoccupations of this life, to devote oneself to spiritual practice in re-mote solitudes, and be unattached to body, life, and possessions. Then Kardri of Tsapo, Tsegon Tsultrim, and many other people from Dorney arrived in Khardo. I gave them empowerments and in-structions. The main disciples stayed in the mon-astery and most of the other monks and nuns, living almost like wild animals, stayed at the foot of overhanging cliffs and large boulders. On the twenty-fifth of the tenth month, 39 when the monastic estates are illuminated, we offered countless butter-lamps on all the nearby rocks, so that the place looked like a sky filled with stars. For a few hours the whole hillside was covered with twinkling lights. People could see it from Lhasa and rejoiced, while, amazed, chil-dren exclaimed, \"Look up there!\" For a few months after this, I gave one session of teaching daily which was attended by hundreds, sometimes thousands of people [408b]--spiritual masters, disciples, monks and nuns, patrons, laymen and laywomen, who came from all directions.

The last day of the teachings, on the occa-sion of the thanksgiving feast, Lama Rabgye from To offered seven dotse and other valuables, worth altogether fifteen dotse.

At various times, the disciples and patrons offered about seven hundred slw of gold, a lot of silver coins, and many dotse. I used the gold to make an offering to the regent Tsemon Lingpa, and later to make a general distribution of tea and money at the Great Prayer Festival. Following this, the reembodiment of the great siddha Khardo Rinpoche was enthroned. I offered seven dotse and did my best to help with the enthronement. The treasurer and two daughters of the former incarnation were ex-tremely pleased and offered me one of his hats, a complete set of his clothes, seven tlzangko. paint-ings that had been the objects of Kardo Rin-poche's meditation, and many precious relics [409a]. I offered to the main temple of Sera a lamp made out of fifty dotse of silver, and made a general distribution of tea and alms. I gave sup-plies of tea, butter, and tsampa to most of the thousands of disciples, monks, nuns, household-ers, and pilgrims who had gathered at Khardo. From time to time, I offered a ganachakra feast, using ten to twenty loads of tsampa. Altogether I offered tea and soup thirteen times to the monks of the three monasteries of Sera, Ganden, and Drepung-the supreme field for accumulating merit. That year, I twice offered tea, soup, and a coin to each of the monks participating in the Great Prayer Festival.43 I gave one coin each to two thousand beggars. For all that I spent over one hundred dotse. I dedicated all the merit of this to the flourishing of the Buddha's Dharma-the source of present happiness and ultimate con-tentment-and to the welfare and felicity of all beings. Return to Central Tibet 467 One day my attendant Khepa asked me to ex-plain the significance of my hat. I answered with these words: The name of the hat that I, The renunciate Tsogdruk Rangdrol, wear on my head, Is the Lotus Cap That Liberates on Sight. As for the significance of its elements, Meaningful to whoever beholds them: Its yellow color signifies That the Buddha's teaching is alive.

Wearing it upon my head symbolizes Placing everyone above myself May everyone practice the Dharma In accordance with this meaning.

Likewise, I gave suitable farewell presents to all those who were departing. Most of them went to their own places and raised, in mountain retreats, the victory banner of spiritual practice. Then, with many monks and nuns, I came down to Lhasa. While I was performingganachakra offerings, the monks and nuns, led by Lama Jimba Norbu, did the long circumambulation around Lhasa, doing full prostrations all the way. They filled the circumambulation path so that other people could hardly fmd space to walk. Everyone said they did not remember ever hav-ing seen so many people circumambulating do-ing full prostrations. People would also come to watch when we were offering ganachakra feasts [410a]. I stayed in Lhasa for five months. My dis-ciples and I completed several thousand fasting practices. The patrons and faithful people of Lhasa provided everyone with sustenance. On the full moon of the fourth month,44 my monks and nuns bought all the flowers from the Lhasa mer-chants and offered them to the mandala of the Great Compassionate One, filling it completely. During my stay in Lhasa, every eighth and fifteenth of the month we would knead loads of tl'ampa and, while doing the long circumambula-tion, feed some to the dogs. We would also take three or four huge hide bags of white tl'ampa and distribute it to the beggars. To the sick, the blind, and poor cripples, I would give coins. Mter I had done this several times, both humans and dogs recognized me and would rush toward me when-ever they saw me coming. Because I was trying in these ways to help and protect the poor people and beggars from Upper, Lower and Middle Tibet, most of the beggars would speak of me as their \"protector.\" The other inhabitants of Lhasa, too, would say, \"the refuge and protector Shabkarpa.\" At that time two Indian sadhus-those as-cetics who renounce meat, alcohol, onions, and garlic, are celibate, practice pure conduct, and wander at random from place to place-having heard of me, came to meet me [ 41 Ob]. \"You don't cling to wealth; you give to the beggars; that is truly excellent. Your way of being is like that of many of our gurus in India. Your conduct is also like ours. We feel happy about that. There are many learned lamas in Tibet, but those with compassion like yours are rare. 0 Bodhisattva guru, give us your spiritual protection! We pray to meet you again in the blissful paradise of Sukhavati.\" Having prayed with these words, they prostrated themselves, and touched their heads to my feet. Mter they left for India, I often wondered what had become of them. I was told that some old lamas from Sera and Ganden were saying to each other, \"These days, below the two Victors, Lama Shabkar has become even more famous than the throne-holder ofGanden. He must have a special power for magnetizing people.\" A lama remarked, \"Magnetizing rituals alone can't achieve such results; his gathering of so many people is due to the Bodhicitta which soaks his being.\" Another concluded, \"Anyway, we don't know the reason, but, however one looks, one cannot fmd fault with his conduct. So, don't criticize him.\" I went to Ganden for two days and paid homage to the great Golden Reliquary. I filled the golden lamp with butter a hundred times. Next, I went to Chimphu [411a] and Drakmar Y ama Lung,45 where I stayed a few days making offerings, prostrations, circumambulations, gana-chakra feasts, and dedication prayers. I went down to Samye and for fifteen days my monks and nuns did many full prostrations. I made large offerings, praying to benefit the Dharma and sentient beings. During my stay, the governor and his wife, who lived near the Red Stupa, provided me with all I could need. Upon my departure they presented me with the collection of the Seoen Treasuries and of Gampopa's writings. 46 I then went to Densathil, the seat of Lord Phagmo Drupa;47 it is a sublime holy place in southern Tibet. My people and I offered our services to the Tibetan government's dignitary in charge of the restoration of the main temple, and gave one dotl'e as a contribution for the work.

I provided most of them with tea, butter and tsampa. From time to time we would knead ten to fifteen loads of tsa:mpa, add gum to it, and shape it in the form of Mount Meru. We would arrange many offerings around it and hold a great ganachakra feast offering. It was then that Gangshar Rangdrol, \"Self-liberation of All That Arises,\" a close disciple of the precious and powerful siddha of the Great Perfection, 48 came from Dorney with my disciple Kunzang Rangdrol, my patron the chieftain Bendhe 1bar [4llb], and many Mongolian na-trons. With Lama Gangshar offering one dntse, alto-gether they offered one hundred sang. Bendhe 1bar explained to me the reasons why I should come to Dorney, and my close disciple Kunzang Rangdrol presented me with this written supplication: To your body-endowed with the marks and signs born of your perfect twofold gathering (Tsok); To your speech-endowed with the sixty (Drug) branches, fulfilling the hopes of the multitude ofbeings, To your mind-all-seeing, the self-liberation (Rangdrol) of obscurations; To your body, speech, and mind, which grant all excellence, I bow down.

The essence of this request made by me-A person in whom good qualities, intelligence, and the like, Are as rare as gems and as rabbit horns; Who made the short path of Samantabhadra's (Kum;ang) wisdom And self-liberation (Rangdrol) into a long one-Is as follows: Forsaking my native land and father, mother, and relatives, Traveling along an arduous road So that beings could be established in happiness, I came to central Tibet to invite you, old father [412a]. Sublime Dharma Lord, having come to central Tibet, . You may delight at the land being filled with Dharma practitioners, But how can you forsake your homeland which is bereft of Dharma? I feel immense sadness at the many non-dhannic actions committed there. In the past the mighty Victor Born from the Lake, Abandoned the king and disciples of Tibet And went to the southwest continent of Chamara50 To subdue the untamed rakshasas. Similarly, precious refuge and protector, I ask that you part from your disciples and patrons ofU-Tsang, And come this year to Dorney, your homeland, To tum toward the Dharma the minds of the untamed people there.

Lama Kunzang Rangdrol decided to stay. After I had given them relics of the three kinds and provisions for the road, Lama Gangshar (to whom I offered the text of the Sangwa r eshe cycle of Olkha)51 and the other patrons left with most of the bundles containing my books. From time to time, I turned the Wheel of the Dharma for the disciples assembled there, giving them explanations on the Swift Path, the Seven-Point Mind Training, the Coemergent Mahamudra, the Great Perfection 17zat Dirpels Dark-ness, and other teachings. Then they endeavored in whichever practices they wished. In answer to the request of my faithful and intelligent disciple Y onten Gyatso, \"Ocean of Good Qualities,\" I sang this song in praise of that great holy place [ 413a]: Father lamas, I supplicate you: Look with compassion upon all of us gathered here. Densathil is the central seat of the holy Kagyu forefathers, A paradise where infinite peaceful and wrathful deities abide, Where mother dakinis and Dharma protectors gather.

Whoever yearns to emulate the lives of the Kagyu forefathers Should plant here the victory banner of spiritual practice. Whoever aspires to obtain the supreme and common siddhis, Should make offerings and ganachakra feasts here. Whoever wants to purify his or her karma and wrongdoings, Should offer prostrations and circumambulations here. By the merit created by this song, May the Dharma of the practice lineage spread. Celestial and human beings all rejoiced at this praise. The householders living below this holy site asked me to make it rain. I told them that I did not know the special instructions for bringing rain, but that I would pray to the Three Jewels [413b]. With a pure motivation, I suppli-cated the Three jewels to bring a beneficial rain. I then rested in meditation, visualizing that the blessings of the Victorious Ones of the ten direc-tions, and the merit gathered throughout the three times by myself and others took the shape of a huge cloud, filling the whole sky, from which rain fell in drops as big as spindles. The same evening it rained heavily, without any thunder-storm, and everyone's wish was fulfilled. Hence-forth, rain always fell whenever needed and the area enjoyed good harvests. Drolma K yidzom, the wife of Dagpo Drumpa, 53 having offered me some of her jew-Return to Central Tibet 4 71 elry and many gifts and provisions, asked me persistently for a supplication prayer to my past incarnations. In answer I spoke this: Many, many aeons ago, Having swiftly attained perfect Buddhahood, To benefit sentient beings and the teachings of the Conqueror, He manifested in whatever manner was appropriate to transform beings. At the time of the Buddha he was A valokiteshvara, In the land oflndia he was Manjushrimitra, 54 In the center of Tibet he became Trenpa Namkha, In the Kagyu tradition he was Milarepa, In the Kadampa lineage he was the glorious Gyalse Thogme, In the Ganden lineage he was the Lord Lodro Gyaltsen, In the nonsectarian lineage he manifested to beings as Thangtong Gyalpo. Now he is the protector ofbeings, Shabkarpa [414a]. In future, in the presence of the Lords of the Five Families, In True joy and every other Buddhafield, He will be a supreme son Who will lead all those who have made a connection with him To the Pure Realm of their wish. To him, who in the past, present, and future, Did, does, and will manifest multiple forms, according to need, Compassionate one, who benefits the Dharma and all beings, Wish-fulfilling gem, refuge, and protector, I supplicate you!

This prayer enhanced the faith of disciples and patrons. The daughter of the Dharma King Lha-gyari55 came to practice the Dharma. I gave her monastic vows and the name l.haksam Drolma, \"Savioress with Noble Intention.\" She offered me most of her jewelry, two boxes for storing religious implements, a good padded carpet, and valuables worth altogether one hundred sang. Many others monks and nuns, men and women from Zangri and Drakicho, became good practi-tioners. To all, I explained the need for conduct-ing themselves according to the Yinaya, and many of them became practitioners who kept pure vows [ 414b]. When the time of my departure approached, I called together all the monks and nuns, and we offered a large ganachakra feast. They implored me to care for them in all their future lives.

All of us yogins, master and disciples, Were born in different lands; Yet by the power of our good karma and prayers, Without being called, Some came from Ngari in western Tibet, Some came from Dorney in eastern Tibet, Some came from U and Tsang in central Tibet, And today all are assembled for a fleeting moment. Demonstrating again the impermanence of compounded things, We part and go our ways. Some will go to secluded mountain retreats To raise the victory banner of practice; Some will wander at random through various lands, As pilgrims to eminent holy places; Some will go to their homelands To meet their kind parents. Once we have gone to our respective destinations, It is unlikely that we will meet our companions again in this life. Even if we were to look for them, we would not be able to see them; Even if we were to listen for them, we would not be able to hear them. All birth ends in death, meeting in separation; Amassing ends in depletion; rise ends in fall [415a]. Everything that exists in samsara Is unreliable, impermanent, essenceless.

Prompted by sadness, I sang this song: Sublime wish-granting gem, protector and refuge, Dwell as the ornament of the chakra of great bliss.

However I consider it, I feel that we won't meet again. Pondering this, I feel sad deep inside. Contemplating the time we've spent together, It seems to have lasted but an instant. Now, when the time comes to go, Unable to endure parting, we must never-theless part. Tears gather in my eyes; I offer you this heart-advice, good for your mind, And these provisions and clothes, good for your body. Besides giving you these, there is nothing else I can do.

They left, their eyes filled with tears and their minds filled with thoughts of their master and the spiritual companions left behind. When I was preparing to leave for Dorney, my fortunate heart-son Kunzang Rangdrol, who was on his way to mountain solitudes in western Tibet, sang this farewell song: Sole ornament of the vast celestial pathway above, Lord of the Twelve Mansions, farewell! When, before long, you will have gone round the three other continents, And, rising again to illuminate J ambudvipa, Radiate in all directions millions ofbeams, I, the white lotus, with all my peers, Our vivid blossoms fully opened, Will make an offering to the Three jewels.

Having said this, accompanied by a few companion, he left to raise aloft the victory ban-ner of spiritual practice in the mountain wilder-ness ofTo, in western Tibet. On the day that we, master and disciples, left Densathil, the whole monastic community accompanied us to the foot of the mountain which lies in front of the monastery. When we were going to part, I sang this song of wishing to meet them again: Root teacher, Vajradhara, Remain as my crest ornament. For all those gathered here, dispel this life's obstacles, And guide them when they leave for the next life.

My disciples and I headed for the estate ofDmje, the administrator of Zangri, and his wife. On the way, I offered a general distribution of tea to the monks ofNgari.57 They requested spiritual pro-tection. I stayed for a few days at the estate of Zangri, giving long-life empowerments, teach-ings, and advice, thus turning everyone's mind to the Dharma. The patrons, men and women, offered jewelry, clothes, and silver coins. I went to visit Zangri Kharmar,58 the Red Fortress of the Copper Mountain, the seat of the Sole Mother, Machik Labdron. There I made offerings and aspiration prayers. We crossed the Tsangpo River in a coracle [ 41 7b] and went to the households ofTsachanga, Yukhang, and Khenpo Shiwa Tsering. To all I Return to Central Tibet 475 gave a blessing oflongevity and a teaching on the nature of mind. They offered a thanksgiving ganachakra feast; those who knew how sang and danced.

In return, I offered him one dotse and a long ceremonial scarf of the finest silk with woven images of Amitayus, the Buddha of Boundless Life. Tsachanga and Yukhang, too, offered me ornaments of gold, silver, turquoise, and corals, light and heavy woolen material, and many bags of tsampa. Since we had known each other for such a long time, unable to bear our separation I stayed for a few more days. Finally, with grief in our hearts and tears in our eyes, we left. At Neuring, I visited the holy places of the valley of La [ 418b], offering tea and alms.

I departed with a heavy heart. The Jetsunma of lhagyari and her atten-dant accompanied me as far as the plain below, and then stayed behind, in tears. I, too, was filled with sadness, and glanced back from time to time. Reaching Tsetang, I offered tea and alms at the monastery and paid homage to the speak-ing image ofjetsun Drolma of Yarlung and to that of Guru Padmasambhava of Sheldrak, 64 making offerings and prayers in front of them. I taught the Dharma and said prayers of auspi-ciousness for the sake of the governor and the householders.

When I went to take leave from the regent-king of Tibet, he, too, gave me many sacred relics and farewell presents, and this edict for the benefit of the Dharma and sentient beings in Dorney: Here is a proclamation from the one known as Bhadarkol Husamati Pakshi, the Sherekeh Thushazin ofGanden, 73 representative of the glori-ous Nominhan7\"\"who holds the yellow hat tradition and the responsibility for Tibet, as granted by the Great Emperor, Jamyang Gongma: This is addressed to the lamas, chieftains, Wangs, Pi'i lis, Pa'i lis, Pa'i sis, Gungs, Jasags, Tha'ijis,Ja'i sangs,75 noble persons, and all the inhabitants-religious and lay, high, low, and medium--of this great continent of the Rose-apple Tree in general, and to the inhabitants of the area of the forty-nine tribes, of the four districts of Orod [ 421 b], of the banks of Lake Trishok Gyalmo, of the Six Ranges ofDokham, ofUpper and Lower Amdo, ofChagmo Golok, of Rang Ngen, and ofBhanak in particular. The renunciate from Amdo called Tsogdruk Rangdrol, prompted by his excellent propensi-ties, conceived a strong feeling of renunciation that led him to receive many profound instruc-tions on the sutras and tantras from numerous teachers, and then to strive earnestly in spiritual practice in mountain solitudes. Return to Central Tibet 4 79 Not only does he benefit in a vast way, mate-rially and spiritually, whomever makes a con-nection with him, but he also has offered thirteen rings of copper beautifully gilt with gold to the Great Stupa of Bodhnath in Nepal and to the Great Tashi Gomang Stupa in Chung Riwoche. He also offered butter-lamps made of solid gold in front of the Jowo Rinpoche at Lhasa, the Jowo Changchup Sempa at Samye, and the Golden Reliquary at Ganden and made cloud-like offerings ofbutter-lamps in different places. At Purang Shephel Ling and at Shelkar Chodeh he placed ganjira pinnacles and Dharma-wheels made of gilded copper. In the great holy place of Lapchi at the Great Maitreya Temple ofGyalgyi Shri, and in other places, he restored many temples [422a]. On the occasion of the ocean-like gathering of Lhasa's Great Prayer Festival, he offered great services, making several general distributions of alms and large offerings. These are just a few examples of the splendid virtuous activity through which he benefits others with impeccable intention. Wherever he gives spiritual advice, everyone should welcome it with enthusiasm and be help-ful to him, as explained in the scriptures, without ever causing him harm or acting mischievously against him. All those who act in accordance with these words will gather the compassion of the Three Supreme jewels, and be kept under their protection in this and future lives.

That night I dreamed that flying miraculously in the sky like a bird I went between the sun and the moon and looked in the direction ofDomey. Seeing that Tsonying, The Heart of the Lake, and Mugeh Thang, the Plain ofFamine,78were empty, I thought, \"I can work miracles! How excellent ifi could transport the Crowned Buddha of lhasa, with its whole temple, to Tsonying, in the middle of the Blue Lake.\" With my hand, I miraculously lifted the whole temple and put it down intact on the crest ofTsonying Island. All around the summit of the island, many kinds of trees had grown, on the tops of which flocks of the seven kinds of birds found on the island were singing melodiously and playfully flying around. Then I thought, \"How wonderful if I now transported the whole of the Chinese emperor's treasury to Mugeh Plain.\" Right away, taking it in my hand, I transported it, and laid it in the middle of Mugeh Plain. From four sides of the treasury, four rivers appeared and flowed in the four cardinal directions. Myriads ofhuman beings and animals joyfully drank their water. I felt this auspicious dream presaged that I would serve the Dharma and beings of Dorney in a great way, both spiritually and materially. Notes 1. In 1822. 2.

On the ninth day of the fourth month of the male Earth Mouse Year, 1 called Kundzin, eighteen of us left Lhasa, carrying five hundred volumes of Lord Buddha's words and commentaries, a load of precious relics, over a hundred statues of vari-ous sizes, eighty painted scrolls, and provisions for the road. For a while we were escorted by Lamajimba N orbu, Lochen, Kalden, and about fifty monks and nuns.

There was no one who was not crying, even Lama Jimba Norbu, foremost among the disciples; some were even wailing [426a]. I looked back many times; there came a point where I saw them as a distant mass of maroon. I did not have the heart to go on and, turning toward them, sat for a while. When, finally, I did go on and lost sight of them, I felt even sadder. They, too, had stood weeping as long as I had remained visible and cried even more when I disappeared from sight. Reluctantly, they went back home, one after the other. I traversed Nakchuka and the countries of the Tsomoras and the Derge Rishmwas,4 and worked to benefit them all. As offerings, I received forty packhorses and ckomos, and many goat -skins filled with butter. We loaded whatever we had on the animals and went on, in the company of a gov-ernment trade official, the Garpon of Xining, and many big merchants.5 We took the long northern route, and when we reached the Drichu River, over a thousand bandits from Golok captured us with all the merchants. Mter talking to them and showing them the proclamations from the regent and from the supreme protector, the Panchen Lama, the bandits gave back the horses, ckomos, and goods belonging to the Garpon, the cloth trader, and us. But they stole the loads of all the other merchants. They broke open the bundles, stole woolen cloth6 and other valuables and, leaving all the religious objects and blessed pills scattered on the ground, rode off[426b]. The Drichu River was in flood, and we were unable to cross it; we had to wait near the banks for a month and ten days. I gave each of the seventy-three people who had been robbed some barley soup, to which they added what little meat they had. Eventually their provisions were exhausted and everyone was on the verge of starvation. Moved by compassion, and with no thought for his own life, my precious heart-son Kalden Rangdrol went along the river search-ing for a ford, but when he bravely tested the ford, the current was so strong that he was swept away and drowned. Filled with boundless grief, I uttered these words oflamentation: I pray to all the teachers Who displayed the ways of passing into rurvana To inspire Dharma practice Among procrastinating disciples who think that everything lasts.

When Lodrak Marpa's son, Dharma Dodeh, Was thrown by his horse and died, His father and mother suffered As though their hearts had been tom from their chests [427a]. Likewise, out of compassion for those who had lost everything, This precious master went to search for a ford And lost his life to the river. Kyema!

Having pondered the impermanence of things, I shall practice the divine Dharma, And dedicate all the merit of my practice To my spiritual daughters and sons. By the truth of my song, May the precious lama Be reborn in a celestial field. Overwhelmed by sadness, I shed many tears. By the strength of his compassion, soon after Kalden Rangdrol's death a ford appeared in the river. Many of my patrons from Banak Khasum, the \"Three Black Camps,\"7 who were on their way to central Tibet arrived on the other side of Return to Dorney 487 the Drichu River. We called out to them. In their midst were some ferrymen who had brought many horses and dzos, and who crossed to fetch the survivors of the robbery. Everyone was able to reach the other side of the river safe and sound. We then met the omniscient Kusho Nye and Bensar Rillpoche. When we came upon Norbu, of the Khyam family, and other faithful men-and women, patrons from Banak Khasum, we rejoiced beyond expression. I stayed with them for a day and gave them a long-life em-powerment, as well as many blessed substances [ 427b]. They gave us butter and tsampa, eighteen bundles of tea, and horses to carry them. All those now-destitute victims of the bandits, who had almost died of starvation, realized that they owed their lives and safe return to these patrons, and remembered their kindness forever. Continuing on our way to Dorney, we en-countered a group headed by the Khenpo and the Nangso, two high officials of the central gov-ernment; they were returning to Lhasa. 8 They, too, gave us much tea, butter, and tsampa. Owing to the kindness of these people, more than sev-enty survivors were able to continue their jour-ney with sufficient food and clothing. One day, the chief of the caravan left an attendant behind, near a place called Choneh. I felt great pity for him and, stopping by the road, sent my disciple Drupchen half a day's walk to fetch him. With difficulty, we continued on. As we reached the top of the pass of Hato, we saw the Kokonor, the Blue Lake. The sight of it brought to my mind the memory of my root teacher, Tendzin Nyirna Rinpoche, who had lived there before, and inspired these words: True and precious guru, My constant refuge in this and future lives, Lord protector, look on me with compas-Sion From the Blissful Paradise; bless me.

When I remember you dwelling In the wilderness of the Blue Lake, tears fill my eyes; I prostrate myself many times in your direction And ask that you look upon me with compassion. When the time comes for me to die, May you, my guru, come, To lead me without hindrance To the Blissful Buddhafield. May we then travel to many Pure Realms, Make offerings to all the Buddhas, And return to this impure world To guide all beings! As we neared the shore of the lake, we sat for a while to rest. Led by lliarampa, the Mongo-lian monks and those who had been robbed said, ''Your compassion saved our lives!\" Everyone felt completely relieved; they were happy to be alive. As a gesture of gratitude, they offered me some silver, which I returned to them. By this time, everyone felt so close to one another that, when we separated to go our own ways, we parted in tears (428b]. Reaching the shore of the Blue Lake, I was happy to meet many friends, disciples and patrons, including the Chod practitioner of Tromtsa and other disciples from Arik. As an object of faith, I gave to the Chod practitioner a painting related to the mind treasure of Khardo Rinpoche; it was sealed on the back by both the master and his son. I accepted an invitation from fifty nomads of Derge and went to their camp near Arik. They gave me many horses, rkos, and yaks. I myself gave them many precious pieces of robes of past saints and other sacred relics. At this time, my spiritual son, the powerful siddha Perna Rangdrol, accompanied by his father Aka and a few other people, came to the Blue Lake carrying a letter and a ceremonial scruf from Pontsang Chingwang Rinpoche,9 but I had I had already left for Xining. They went to wait for me near Gomeh, while I myself was approach-ing Xining via T ongkhor. In Xining, I told the Am ban everything that had happened; he said with great warmth, \"It is remarkable that you were able to save from starvation so many who had been robbed, to provide them with food and clothing, and to bring them back. I am very happy about that.\" He gave me tea, clothes, and other gifts. Following this, I went to Kumbum, where I met the throne-holder. As a funeral offering for Lama Kalden Rangdrol, I presented a few horses and rkos to the lamas ofKumbum and requested their spiritual protection [ 429a]. I also offered tea and three hundred silver coins to the monas-tic congregation. At the precious Golden Reli-quary, 10 I offered a rosary of coral adorned with various jewels, and a silver lamp made of six ounces of Chinese silver. I also lit a hundred butter-lamps, praying for the benefit of the Dharma and all beings. We stayed and rested there for thirteen days, doing prostrations and circumambulations. Then I went across to Dhitsa, where the many ngakpas took good care of me. There I met"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"the accomplished siddha Perna Rangdrol and his retinue. He offered me a horse, a load ofbutter, a letter of greetings and a scarf from Chingwang Rinpoche, and other letters, all of which brought me great joy.

To Chingwang Rinpoche I sent blessed substances of the body, speech, and mind, multiplying relics of Lord Buddha, some corals and a ceremonial scar( Very pleased, he later sent to me at Tashikhyil fifty sang of silver. Many people from Gomeh came to meet me at the entrance to the Machu Valley. Some wealthy people offered me horses; I ended up with three of them, four loads of black tea bricks, and many ceremonial scarves. Then I came up the valley and went to see the temple of the Crowned Buddha ofTrika. I stayed there a few days, making offerings [429b]. The enclosure of the Crowned Buddha's temple grew crowded with thousands of people from the Trika area, monks, laymen and women. I received them all, taught them the foundations of the Dharma, and gave the transmission of the dharanis of the Three Lords, the Miktsema prayer, and the Vajra Guru and longevity mantras. Finally I sang this song: Compassionate Buddha, I supplicate you-Look upon us, your followers! I shall now sing of the benefit of virtue: Listen to me with a joyous, undistracted mind!

May all men and women who hear this song, Practice virtue and swifdy attain Buddhahood. All the people from Tromlha who were gathered there rejoiced gready and were confrrmed in their faith. At that time the community of yogins of Nub Khamra came to greet me and offered many bricks of black tea. In return I offered them a painted scroll from central Tibet as an object of faith. About a hundred people-some on horseback, some on foot--came from my homeland, Shohong Lakha, to receive me, led by the chieftains Tralo and Tselo. When we met, everyone rejoiced. Continuing on, I went to pay homage to the local deity ofTrika [430b]. I offered some bro-cade, two rings of gold and silver, and some turquoise and corals, beseeching the deity to act for the sake of the Dharma and all beings. I met, too, the twojamgon Lamas, senior and junior, as well as Kusho Shabdrung Karpo. I offered them sacred objects related to the body, speech, and mind, relics that had multiplied miracu--lously, and other sacred substances, along with a bowl in divine tkah wood11 and a rosary. To establish spiritual connections, I requested some teaching from them; on their part, they gave me some horses, clothes, and many other presents and provisions. I then went to visit the monasteries of Deshung district in Trika and offered some rel-ics. I taught the local men and women, and said prayers of dedication and auspiciousness. Faith-ful people offered me barley, coins, pieces of cloth and ceremonial scarves--over three hun-dred items altogether. I gave these to Kumbum Monastery as reimbursement for the coins I had distributed earlier. After this I reached the Yell ow Valley of Rekong. At the pass ofThang, the treasurer and other main attendants of the Omniscient One of Shar, from the great monastery ofRongpo, had come to welcome me with many horsemen. 12 Accompanied by them, I reached Rongpo Gon. The day I entered the monastery, many rain-bows appeared in the sky; they were seen by both Tibetans and Chinese. Everyone said it was an auspicious sign, and the faithful rejoiced. When I entered the presence of the Precious Omniscient One ofShar [ 431 a], I offered him a full set of robes, the skin of a k:rishnasara ante-lope 13 with its two horns, a longevity vase made of gilded copper (with a stopper carved with an image of Amitayus), a fmely painted set of three scrolls from central Tibet representing the Six-teen Arhats, eighty-eight volumes of the col-lected writings of various teachers, and one horse, one mule, and twenty-five yaks, all with their saddles. I requested from him the transmission of the dlwanis of the Three Lords, the dlwani of"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"longevity, and the prayer known as the Ground of Good Qy.alities. I venerated him as my root teacher, thinking ofhim always present above my head as a crown jewel. I also met all the other lamas of Rongpo: Khenchen Tullm, Yershong Tullm, Rongpo Tsang, Kusho Samdrup, Changse Tsang, the senior and junior Dzongkar, the senior and jun-ior Dechen, and others. I asked them for some teachings to form spiritual bonds with them, and I offered one yak with its saddle to each of the senior attendants. With ten large packages of tea, I offered tea to all the monks of the monastery. Lamas, chieftains, monks and nuns, and men and women ofRekong by the tens of thou-sands came to meet me. I gave audience for many days. Ahnost all the lamas and chieftains asked me, \"From the time you first left our coun-try until now, which holy places have you visited, which extraordinary lamas and sacred objects have you met, what sort of things have you seen? Today, you must recount all this for us in great detail\" [43lb]. I told them at length how I had visited the great holy places and practiced there, how I had met many teachers and paid homage to many sacred objects, and how in different countries I had seen people dressed in all sorts of ways. Finally, I summarized everything in these verses: Masters, grant your blessings That I accomplish all my aims! I, the yogin Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Became weary of samsaric affairs, And, leaving my native land, Went to the monastery ofDoby. There, I met Y ongdzin Arik Geshe, And from him received the full monastic vows. I understood that discipline was the root of the Dharma And acted in accordance with the Vinaya, not eating in the evening, for example. Then I went to Little Mongolia And met the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo. Return to Dorney 491 I received instructions that unite sutra and tantra, And preserved the Three Vows as though they were my own eyes. I went to the wilderness ofTseshung And practiced for five years. Through the kindness of the Dharma King and his consort Everything went well; my experiences and realization flourished. I went to the wilderness ofTsonying Island And practiced for three years. In meditation experiences and in dreams, I heard teachings from the gurus and deities. I was happy on this delightful island, Where seven kinds ofbirds sing. I went to the glaciers of Machen And practiced for nine months. I saw the faces of many deities In reality, visions and dreams (432a]. On my way back, events turned out well When I happened to ride on a wild drong. I went to Trakar Drel Dzong And meditated for six months. I saw on the rocks of this sacred place Many naturally formed figures of deities. From the patrons of the Three Black Camps, Provisions fell upon me like rain. The death of my mother Led me to the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang. In Lhasa I paid homage to the two Crowned Buddhas, Which I perceived as the Buddha himself I met the Precious Victorious One, 14 Whom I saw as the Lotus-bearer in person.

At the Great Prayer Festival I saw all sorts of amazing scenes. I saw the Great Golden Reliquary of Ganden, The most supreme object of offering and prostrations, And perceived it as if meeting The Victorious One, Lobzang Trakpa, in person. I went to glorious Samye, the Inconceivable, And saw the Triple-Styled Central Temple. Remembering the graciousness of the Abbot, the Master and the King,15 Boundless faith grew in me. During the Sutra Offering at Samye, 16 I saw many wondrous happenings. I made the pilgrimage of the Tsari Ravines, Where I experienced both happiness and hardship. Seeing some Lhopas wearing small cymbals Attached to their ears made me laugh [432b]. The Turquoise Palace Lake ofT sari Seemed to be laid out as a mandala of turquoise. I saw great siddhos remain on glaciers overnight Wearing a single cotton garment. Practicing there for one year, I had various visions and spiritual expenences. On my way back, I went to Shar Dagla Gampo And saw the abode of the Physician of Dagpo. I remained there about four months, Contemplating the life-stories of Kagyu masters of the past. I went to Tashi I.lmnpo And met Panchen Rinpoche, Whom I saw as the lord of the Blissful Realm in person. The roofs of the temples Were shining like golden suns-Such a great and pleasant monastery Is indeed a wonder in the world. I went to To Ngari And saw the three silver-crowned Buddhas. The inhabitants of Purang have great faith in the Dharma, And many of them gave me all I needed to sustain me. I went to the White Snows ofMount Kailash And remained in retreat for three years. At the door of my cave, I expounded the Dharma, Accomplishing the good of others as well as my own. The snow-white summit of Mount Kailash Is like a stupa of crystal. There are many gold mines. Crystal-sugar and molasses can be bought. I went to the land ofLo And visited the Hundred Springs, Where one can see fire continually burning On the waters and in the cracks of the earth and rocks. I went to the border between Nepal and Tibet, Where I saw the self-arisen Wati Zangpo [433a]Y By the blessings of this sublime image, Everyone there enjoyed happiness.

I came back to central Tibet, And, as before, encountered spiritual teachers and sacred objects. By accomplishing the good of others, My own benefit was accomplished as well. I fmally returned to Lower Dokham, And today, in celebration of our meeting Within the auspicious and harmonious sphere of the Dharma, I have offered you these agreeable words May this song benefit the minds Of all those who hear it. Virtue prevailing all over the country, May everyone practice the Dharma! These stories about the lanqs of To, U, Tsang, and others, satisfied everyone. I went to meet Kusho Magsar Rinpoche18 who, having fallen ill, was on the verge of death. Soon after we met each other, he passed away with a joyful heart, but my mind was sad beyond mea-sure [433b]. For his funeral, I offered a horse, a dzo, and a large white porcelain cup, as well as some brocades; I performed dedication prayers, com-forted everyone, and looked after his monastery. I met Drupwang Narnkha Rinpoche19 and Gotse T ulku. One of my spiritual sons from the early days, Alak Dechen, invited me to his home, and offered me objects symbolic ofbody, speech, and mind, as well as a large-sized bell, 20 five Return to Dorney 493 head each of horses and cattle, a hundred large pieces of cloth, and a hundred ceremonial scarves. I accepted these and said prayers to dedicate the merit. Then I went to the end of Gowu, the auspicious and pleasant place where Jetsun Kalden Gyatso had meditated in the past, and stayed there a few days. During that time, three tribes from Lingya and seven from Lower Jam were feuding. The whole area was seething with unrest; about eigh-teen people had already been killed. When I heard about it, I went there and blessed them all, after which the demon instigating their quar-rel-their spiteful thoughts and violence-qui-eted down. Having talked to them in accord with both the Dharma and the customs of this world, I settled them down. Having left the chief Tralo as my tempo-rary representative, we all, master and disciples, went to Shelgon, the Crystal Monastery, and met Kusho Chumar Rinpoche. I offered him symbols of body, speech, and mind, and re-quested some teaching from him to create a spiritual connection between us. T rearing us as guests coming from afar, he gave us all the provi-sions we needed. When I took leave, he gave me a mule, a lot of cloth, and some silk. When I returned from Shelgon, I was able to settle the feud between Lingya and Lower Jam once and for all; many human lives were saved [434a]. As the river of Serkha had become muddy and was running dry, problems and repeated quarrels arose among the local people. I blessed the river, and from that year onwards, it broad-ened and flowed without cease. For the frrst time, an abundance of trees and shrubs flour-ished there. People said that this was a miracu-lous deed, and their faith became stronger than ever. This ended, too, all reason for people to quarrel and kill each other about sharing the water. Then, taking the White Road, I reached Shohong Lakha and my own village, Nyengya. I met my two sisters, my nephews, and other rela-tives, and all the people around were extremely pleased to see me. The whole village gave a feast, after which everyone asked me to their homes."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"494 The Life of Shabkar They offered me eighteen horses and head of cattle, and forty bags of barley. I went to my mother's house, which was deserted and had fallen into ruins. In one corner was a small shed with no one but a lone, half-paralyzed woman. When she saw me, she cried. I felt great pity for her; the image of my old mother rose in my mind. Now, not only was my mother no more, but even her home no longer existed. Tears gathered in my eyes; filled with sadness, thinking, \"It's really true that all things are impermanent,\" I sang this song [434b]: Gurus, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Having seen with your wisdom eyes Wherever in the six realms my mother maybe, Lead her to the pure Blissful Buddhafield. At the time that I lived here, I myself was young, and my mother was not old. I then went off to other lands-But I thought that I would meet her once agam In the clear light of this world. When my kind mother stayed at home, I, the son, left for distant places. By the time that I returned, My mother had gone on to the next world: The reunion of mother and son did not occur. Thinking of this, I remember my mother. What joy if she were here now! How I wish that mother and son Could meet again once more! If we could meet but for an instant, How happy would be the reunion of the living with the dead! Kyema! Everything that exists in samsara Is fleeting, impermanent, essenceless. My mother is no more--that's how it is. Even her house did not outlast her. Both my mother and her home have given me The teachings on impermanence And the transience of illusory phenomena. Contemplating this, I, the yogin; Feel sadness deep within my mind; I want to relinquish pointless activities; I want to practice the divine, purposeful Dharma. As result of practicing this holy Dharma, May the two of us, mother and son, Be reunited in our next lives in a pure Buddhafield, Talk together joyfully, Make offerings to all the Buddhas, And guide all sentient beings. Sadness welled up from the depths of my being [435a]. I thought, \"My work in my home-land is over; who knows when my life's work will be fmished?\" This reflection strengthened my diligence in performing positive actions. After some time the ailing woman died. I erected a temple and a stupa on the site where my home had been. There, I gave teaching on mani, setting into motion the stream of virtue. Following this, all the local people never stopped doing prostrations, circumambulating, and mak-ing daily offerings, morning and evening. Following this, I went to Tashikhyil Hermit-age. 21 The caretakers of the monastery, the se-nior and junior lamas of Shohong, the chieftain Norbu, and all the men and women of the local-ity, came to see me and requested the initiation of the Great Compassionate One. On the day I gave it, the sky was filled with rainbows; seeing this, every-one felt stronger faith than ever. They offered me all the tea, butter, and tsampa I could use. My Dharma friend Chogden, a sky-like yogin who had destroyed illusion and attained sublime realization, asked for some condensed spiritual advice on the way to maintain recognition of the nature of mind. In answer I said: \"Aku Chogden, listen well! Your body and everything that exists in samsara and nirvana-the universe and the beings in it-are just words,"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"names; they do not have an atom of existence on their own; they are primordially void, like the sky. Manifest phenomena are but an architec-ture of various causes and conditions that came into being on the basis of our various good and bad actions, through the process of interdepen-dent arising. Like a rainbow in the sky, the reflec-tion of the moon in water, or an image in a mirror, although they do not exist, they appear; they are empty even though they are apparent [ 435b]. 1bis entire illusory display of unreal void-appearances is fabricated by mind, appears in mind, and remains in the expanse of mind. \"The nature of mind is an infmite, all-en-compassing and unobstructed expanse, void and luminous, free of taking things as real, and devoid of fabrication-like the sky. To remain in total ease and openness within this natural expanse of mind is to become a glorious sky-like yogin for whom there is no difference between friend and enemy, gold and stone, the present life and future lives.\" I continued with this song: I continually supplicate the accomplished guru Whose realization is as vast as the sky: Watch over me with your compassionate eyes And bless me so that your mind and mine fuse into one. The source of all phenomena of samsara and nirvana Is the nature of mind-void, luminous, All-encompassing, vast as the sky. When remaining in that state of sky-like vastness, Relax into its openness; remain in that very openness, Merge with that sky-like state: Naturally, it will become more and more relaxed-Excellent! If you become accomplished In this method of integrating mind with view 22 ' Return to Dorney 495 Your realization will naturally become vast. Just as the sun shines unobstructed within the sky, Compassion will infallibly shine on all unrealized beings [436a]. If an heir of the yogin Longchen Rabjam's lineage Sings a spiritual song, he will sing in this way. 0 yogin, destroyer of illusion, endowed with supreme realization, If you want to maintain awareness of the nature of mind, follow this song. I pray that, after death, you may be liberated in the absolute body, And benefit beings with your manifest body. After hearing this song, Chogden relaxed in unobstructed openness, and as he remained in this state his realization of the natural brilliance and vastness of mind increased greatly. From then on, no matter where he was, his perceptions remained completely free and at ease. Knowing how to get along with everyone, he was always joyful. Later, when he passed away, he did so with pure joy, in the state of the great openness and freedom of the absolute nature. A limpid sky and other excellent signs indicated that at the moment of death he had achieved liberation in the dharmakaya. Having held a meeting, the local patrons decided to repair the monastery, which was in a poor condition. All the faithful men and women from the Upper and Lower Shohong all the way to Tsodu in Lingya came; many people began to work. All the nomads from Awartheu, Kangtsa, I.hashi and other places came in crowds to join us, bringing supplies of tea, butter, milk, curd,"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"496 Th£ Life of Shabkar and cheese. While villagers and nomads were carrying on the restoration work [436b], the Vajradhara lama, Kusho Serkhang Rinpoche, came and offered many horses and cattle as a contribution to the restoration. Having blessed this place of veneration by setting foot there, he said, \"I had a good dream last night; I dreamed that the whole hill of Tashikhyil was covered with temples and her-mitages, right to the top.\" Later, his prediction came true. An outstanding Dharma and samaya connection was established between us, and our minds mingled as one. At that time too, many lamas and spiritual teachers-Kusho Hortsang, Changlung Tulku, Alak Tragpoche, and others--came, offered many horses and cattle, and asked for teaching. Complying with their wishes, I offered them initiations, transmissions, and explanations on the profound path ofChod, and whatever other teachings they wanted. Over several months, I gave several initiations, such as the Avalokiteshvara initiation of the Sixteen Spherel-3 from the Kadampa tradition, and initiations of Vajrasattva and ofVajra Kilaya, as well as bless-ings for longevity and prosperity. I gave trans-missions and explanations to the congregation of yogins and to many laymen and laywomen. I also gave many of them monastic vows. In this way I was able to tum everyone's mind toward the Dharma. Many male and female disciples, such as Lodro of Gomeh, the Gelong of Khagya, the sculptor of Mangra, Rigdrol the Mongolian, and others, completely relinquished the ordinary affairs of this life. Hun-dreds of monks, nuns, and ngakpas such as the hidden yogin Perna Rigdzin, the hermit of Tongsa, Rinchen Dmje, and so on, either devoted their whole lives to spiritual practice or stayed several months or years in retreat [437a]. When help was welcome for the restoration of the temple, my relative Aku Menpa offered a horse with its saddle, carpet, and bridle, a full set of clothes, a big bundle of tea, and two lumps of butter, one big and one small. His attendant, Gelong Tenpa Dargye, contributed one big bundle of tea, two ounces of silver, five bags of barley, and a few wide pieces of cloth, all of which proved very useful. I gave them both the transmission and explanations of the Condensed Meaning of the Graded Path24 and the transmission of the Traniference That Leads to Enlightenment With-out Meditation. I gave them many miraculously multiplied relics of the Buddha, and other blessed substances. When the outer works of the temple had been completed, the mask makers] am yang Tashi and Trogyal Bum and the sculptor Sonam Rinchen made the statues and other sacred objects inside. Both the outside and the inside were decorated with various paintings. A mo-nastic congregation was then installed. To pay for this, I spent nine packets of red and yellow gold leaves, and gave five hundred lengths of cloth to the artists and the same to the carpenters; altogether I must have spent the equivalent of more than a thousand ounces of silver. Having more or less settled at T ashikhyil, I deposited there most of the precious things I had brought from U and Tsang. I gave the rest of the statues and thangka paintings to neighboring mon-asteries [437b]. I used the miraculously multi-plied relics and other precious relics I had to fill statues and other sacred objects symbolic of en-lightened body, speech, and mind that had been erected in some one hundred and eight temples. As time passed, I also gave some to many faithful people. The whole region became filled with these three kinds of sacred objects. Mter having performed the consecration of · the temple, I offered a feast and sang a song in praise of the place: I pay homage to all the Victorious Ones of the past Who attained Buddhahood by dwelling in solitary places: Bless us, your followers, practitioners of the Dharma, That we be able to remain in mountain retreat.

It seems difficult to fmd a way of acting Attuned to the minds of the beings of our times. Most of the learned and accomplished sages Have passed away or gone into the easy rest of their own practice.

When I received this letter, which he had sent with great enthusiasm, I felt as much joy as though meeting him in person. One night I dreamt that I came to a place said to be the Paradise Arrayed in Turquoise Petals34-a vast and even plain, perfect in all aspects, ringed with different kinds of trees with beautiful leaves, flowers, and fruits. In the middle of the plain stood a lofty three-story pavilion entirely made ofjewels, the beauty of which was enhanced by a glittering golden dome, just like paintings of Buddhafields. As I arrived on the path that encircled the pavilion, there came three young maidens doing circumambulations. One of them kept on look-ing at me and asked, \"Don't you recognize me?\" \"No,\" I said, ''I don't\" [440a]. She continued, \"Son, I am your mother! Mter I died, I came here. It has been many years since I've seen you. It is good that we've met again. You've grown old, my son.\" The image of my mother in her old age was vivid in my mind and I cried. My mother, too, could not hold back her tears. Then I asked, ''Who are these two other girls?\" and she men-tioned the names of two old women of our vil-lage who were always reciting prayers to Drolma. The girls, too, looked at me and cried. When I recalled the faces of the two old grandmothers, more tears filled my eyes. \"It is really good that Return to Dorney 499 you are all happy now! But where do you usually stay?\" I asked. 'We live in the Western Blissful Buddhafield; we came this morning to circum-ambulate and offer prostrations toJetsun Drolma. For the moment, you must continue benefiting beings; later we will meet again, in whichever Buddhafield you attain.\" With that, the three girls continued their circumambulations. As I was thinking myself to do some, I woke up. I realized that what had become of my old mother and her friends, the two old ladies, was thanks to their having said many prayers to Drolma, and I felt great joy. That year, just before the autunm, I went to Gartse Monastery at the invitation of its monas-tic community [ 440b]. They presented me with a hundred different offerings, starting with a big bundle of tea. Some monks from wealthy fami-lies asked me to their cells and offered me bundles of tea also. I then proceeded to Shuknyin Her-mitage, where Kusho Gartse gave me one bundle of tea and two lengths of thick woolen cloth. 35 The junior lama of Gartse gave me one horse, one dzo, and two lengths of woolen cloth; the old lama Tendzin gave me a large bundle of tea; all the monks and neighbors, too, offered me a lot of provisions and other things. I made a distribu-tion of money and tea to all the monks, offerings to the two main lamas, and requested teaching from them. From then on, we were to accom-plish many religious tasks, helping each other as friends. Then, one after the other, I visited the no-madic areas of Awartheu, Kangtsa, Lhashi, Rang Ngen, Gengya, and Luchu Thang. They gave us a thrilling welcome; everywhere it was all, \"The gods have come! Glory has come!\" and so on.

The offerings came to eighty horses and head of cattle, seven big bundles of tea, thirty-three large and small hide-pouches ofbutter, thirty-one lengths of white felt, 36 and many pieces of wool, cotton, and ceremonial scarves. From lhashi I went to meet Taksang lliamo Ser Tri Rinpoche, a Bodhisattva who was dwell-ing on the bhumis [441a]. I offered him a horse and requested some teaching. Then I went to Nyimalung Monastery and met Alak Hortsang, who gave me horses and cattle in great number. On my part, as substitute for a general distribu-tion of alms and tea, I offered to the monastery several horses and head of cattle. Going to Gengya, I visited the great holy site of Trakar, the White Rock, and remained for many days in the guest house attached to it. Establishing a connection with this holy place, I met the Dakini ofTrakar, offered her the sym-bols ofbody, speech, and mind, and requested some teaching from her. As the equivalent of a tea offering, I offered one horse to the monas-tery. I stayed there for two days, doing prostra-tions and circumambulating the temple. Just before the winter, I came back home and gave initiations and teachings to benefit the people ofShohong Chi. I was offered a hundred and fifty large and small bags of wheat and barley, and nearly thirty horses and other ani-mals. During the winter I went to the various districts of Shohong Lakha, taught the Dharma, and gave empowerments. On the occasion of a general feast, people sang songs like this one sung by Nam Lhagyal: One garment gives warmth to all beings-The sun ofJambudvipa. One food sustains all beings-The white trampa. One chief can rule all his provinces-The Manchu ruler. And the singer Tse Wangyal sang: High mountains? Tsongkha Kyeri is high: Even birds must fly around it, not over it; Wide rivers? Machu Luma is wide [ 441 b]: When crossing, one starts above and ends far down; Great rulers? The Manchu ruler is great: People are still paying attention this year To what he was saying last year. Two girls sang in unison: When the sun emerges from behind the mountain, See how sunny and shady slopes both grow warm. When the moon rises high in the frrmarnent, See how mountains and plains both grow clear. When the protector and refuge comes back from U, See how old and young faces all grow happy. A young boy sang: The lama is a winter sun-Day after day he shines brighter. The treasurer is a cairn on the mountain pass-Day after day he grows richer. 37 Monks are stars in the sky-Day after day their numbers increase. These songs and dances filled everyone with joy. The chieftain Tralo offered me a silver dotre and five bags ofbarley; the chieftain Tselo, twenty-five bags of barley, ten ounces of silver, and one piece of brocade; and with everyone, rich and poor, offering me whatever they had amassed, the offerings came to thirty horses and other animals, and over three hundred bags ofbarley, big and small.

I also sang a song explaining the need for compas-sion, the root of all Dharma: Avalokiteshvara, mighty Great Treasure of Compassion From my heart I invoke your blessing [442a]. By this blessing, may compassion be born in my mind And in the minds of all beings under the sky. If a man has compassion, he is a Buddha; Without compassion, he is a Lord of Death. With compassion, the root of Dharma is planted, Without compassion, the root of Dharma is rotten. One with compassion is kind even when angry, One without compassion will kill even as he smiles. For one with compassion, even his enemies will tum into friends, Without compassion, even his friends tum into enemies. With compassion, one has all Dharmas; Without compassion, one has no Dharma at all. With compassion, one is a Buddhist, Without compassion, one is worse than a heretic. Even if meditating on voidness, one needs compassion as its essence. A Dharma practitioner must have a compassionate nature. Compassion is the distinctive characteristic of Buddhism. Return to Dorney 50 I Compassion is the very essence of all Dharmas. Great compassion is like a wish-fulfilling gem. Great compassion will fulfill the hopes of self and others. Therefore, all of you, practitioners and laypeople, Cultivate compassion and you will achieve Buddhahood. May all men and women who hear this song, With great compassion benefit all beings! This song benefited everyone's mind [442b]; many became Dharma practitioners and, with the love of a mother for her child, cared with intense compassion for all suffering beings. In the summer, accompanied by Kusho Gartse Rinpoche, the old lama Tendzin, and many chieftains and disciples, I went to settle a feud that had been going on for eighteen years between the people ofDoby and Seychang, and that had led to the loss of the lives of over eighty men and horses, with still more killing going on. Neither envoys from China nor lamas and officials from Tibet had succeeded in settling the dispute. Speak-ing to both parties, I brought them to an agree-ment. In this region was a stupa known as N amdag Chenmo, the Great Pure One, which contained a begging bowl made of lapis lazuli filled with small relics of the Buddha Kashyapa. It had become damaged, and I restored it. On the day of the thanksgiving feast for the consecration, sitting at the feet of the Great Stupa, I taught the Dharma. Everyone, even the Chinese, Mongols and Muslim Salars,38 listened with faith. Later, people said, \"The words of our Kachu Buddha39"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"502 The life of Shabkar and those of the Lama Shabkar from Tibet are identical.\" Then the Dotheye40 ofXining came on a tour. He had heard that I used to feed many beggars and especially that I had taken care of and safely brought back many people who had been robbed by Golok bandits, and that I had thus benefited the country. When he reached Yadzi, he called me into his presence and said [443a], \"I am very pleased to hear all this news about you; you are truly a good Dharma practi-tioner.\" He gave me a piece of brocade, some black tea, and a mirror, adding, \"Henceforth, continue to benefit beings. In particular, tell each bandit group from Banak Khasum and Nyakyarul to stop robbing and to respect the command of the emperor. This will benefit those places. If you come to visit the Five-peaked Moun-tain, I shall help you.\" At my request, he freed many prisoners at Y adzi and everyone, even the Salars, became filled with faith and respect. Then I went to Shardzong, the Eastern For-tress, where Jetsun Kalden Gyatso had medi-tated; I stayed there many days to establish a connection with this holy place. I also erected a stupa of piled-up stones, and beside the monastic community I built a walled enclosure for holding religious debates. Within it, I erected a mansion sheltering a statue of the Protector of Nechung, whom I supplicated to increase the prosperity of the monastery. I gave a long-life empowerment and taught the Dharma to all the villagers, who became filled with faith. Many of them offered me food, animals, and possessions. I myself gave service to the monastic community. I also brought back many bags ofbarley to Tashikhyil, where they were very useful. From Tashikhyil, I went first to Lingya. Giving teachings and empowerments, singing spiritual songs-through various means I turned everyone's mind towards the Dharma and inspired strong faith in them. They offered me about a hundred bags of wheat and two hundred large and small bags ofbarley [443b]. At that time my fortunate disciple Gyurme and my good friend the retreatant Toptsang left together on pilgrimage to the Five-peaked Moun-tain of China. I visited one by one all the districts of the upper, middle and lower parts of the Golden Valley of Rekong-the ten districts of Lower Jam, Nyang, Dardrong, Changchup, Kyitsang, Tsodu, Gyalpo, Trang Yar, Nang, Sedo Runyin, Chuma, Shalang, Lhoncho, Homag Lakha, the seven districts of Rongpo, the four parts of Gyatre, and so on. To all the male and female patrons I explained the Dharma and gave empowerments. In particular, I gave them much advice re-garding the affairs of this world, following which all dissension and quarrels ceased. I began many projects that were the sources of virtuous activ-ity. Especially in the places where there were no temples, no mani prayer-wheels, and no stupas, I urged them to erect holy edifices and objects related to the body, speech, and mind of the Buddhas. All the benefactors, rich and poor, of the north and south sides ofRekong, filled with faith, offered many provisions and animals: one thou-sand and thirty bags of barley, horses, yaks, dris, and oxen (two hundred head altogether), thir-teen big and small skin-bags of butter; five big bundles of tea, two dotse of silver; red woolen bags, 41 lengths of cloth of various colors and several thousand ceremonial scarves. On that occasion I offered the following prayer for the fulfillment of whatever the disciples and patrons wished [444a]: May the blessings of the Three jewels enter your minds! May accumulated virtue ripen for the sake of the whole universe and its inhabitants! May the outer universe be a pure Buddhafield! May the inhabitants be only celestial beings! May grass grow where there was no grass! May water gush forth where there was no water! May trees grow where there were no trees! May crops be abundant where they were scant!

While I was at Yarnang Dambu Trakar, I met Kusho Dzong Ngon Rinpoche when he came there [ 444b]. 42 He offered me a lot of provisions and animals, including horses, clothing, and a white conch. In return, I offered him many sa-cred objects and the three kinds of blessed sub-stances, as well as some teaching to establish a spiritual connection. I told him, \"Your aims are the welfare of the beings and the teachings; as a means to accomplish this, it would be very good if you built a temple to Maitreya,\" and he did so. At that time, too, I met the senior and the junior Alak of Gartse. I offered them a long-life empowerment and some blessed substances; in return they presented me with horses, clothes, and many other things, and took good care of me. Our minds mingled as one. Once, when the junior Alak was helping in the construction of a house for retreat at the entrance to the holy place ofDambu Trakar, he Return to Dorney 503 fell from the roof-a height of three storeys-without suffering any harm. Everyone was amazed that he wasn't hurt and proclaimed, \"By the compassion and protection of the lord guru, he displayed a miraculous sign of accomplish-ment. How amazing!\" Some said, \"Don't tell the villagers that Alak fell, tell them he flew!\" and everyone laughed. later we met time and again, and erected together many sacred objects and buildings. As I went to Magsar, my fortunate spiritual son Khandro called me for the consecration of a temple devoted to the Great Compassionate One, \"King of the Sky.\"43 On the occasion of the thanksgiving ceremony, he offered me a horse and a dzo, a skin-bag ofbutter, and one hundred pieces of cloth. I dedicated the merits with many prayers. I then went to Kohudeh, where I met the powerful siddhas of the Great Perfection, father and son [445a].44 I offered them many precious objects, including miraculously multiplying rel-ics, and requested teachings from them to make a spiritual connection. In return they gave me horses, clothes, tea, butter, and other useful things. Then, at Rongpo Gonchen, at the time of the great annual Chinese prayer festival, 45 I had some bread baked with more than forty bags of wheat, and distributed these to the assembly with tea and soup. Before the Omniscient Manjushri, I placed a set of seven large brass offering bowls and a butter-lamp made out of one hundred and eight silver coins. At Lukra Pekar Choling, I built a large temple to shelter the principal images: a statue of the Crowned Buddha and one of Manjushri. To cover the expense, I used over a hundred bags of barley and ten of wheat, as well as thirteen packets of ten thousand pieces of yellow and red paper.46 As wages I offered eighteen big bundles of tea for the sculptors and five hundred large pieces of cloth for the carpenters. Tea, butter, and many other goods were also used for expenses. Arriving at thejokhang Temple of Sakar-shar, I offered forty silver coins and five big bundles of tea. As a contribution for the Rongpo temple of Kusho Tsendrok Khen Rinpoche, I offered thirty-three bags of wheat and barley."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"504 The Life of Shabkar For the repair of the Maitreya temple at Gartse, I offered twenty-five bags of barley to the trea-surer ofKusho Sey Rinpoche. For the making of thirty-one paintings depicting the One Hundred Episodes of Lord Buddha's Former LWes [445b],47 I offered thirty horses and other animals, twelve bags of wheat and barley, and nineteen sang of silver. In addition, I offered fifteen pieces ofbro-cade for the frames and ten lengths of cloth for the lining on the back. On various occasions I also gave over a hundred bags ofbarley to beggars. During the following summer, my fortunate spiritual son, the learned Achung, went to do a retreat at Namdzong, the \"Sky Citadel,\" after which his practice, meditation experiences, and realization developed greatly. The Khenpo and the cook Kunga Tendzin, who had stayed at Tashikhyil meanwhile, completed the remain-ing work on the temples. Accompanied by Orgyen, Drupchen, and the other monks, we were escorted by a hundred horsemen from the Upper and Lower Shohong La up to the Golden Valley above Great Bend, where we stayed for a day. People organized horse races and all kinds of singing and dancing. Then all the horsemen went back. With a large party, I went to the nomadic area of Changlung. The population there re-quested a longevity blessing; I gave them empowerments and teachings, and enjoined the bandits to obey the laws. I went to everyone's tents, rich and poor, said prayers of auspicious-ness, and dedicated the merit. I was offered horses, cattle, and excellent butter. I then proceeded to nomad areas of Dopa, where many people came on horseback to wel-come me. !Jorse races and all sorts of games were held. At the request of those gathered there, I gave a longevity empowerment and a blessing of Jambhala to four or five hundred people, taught the Dharma, and sang spiritual songs. Many bandits promised to cease robbing; thus I helped revive and enforce the laws against ban-ditry [ 446a]. All the wealthy families called me to their tents; I said prayers for bringing prosperity and auspiciousness, and dedication prayers. They offered me many horses and cattle, and much butter and cheese. Having received forty head of horses and cattle and fourteen loads of butter at Changlung and Dopa, I brought them to Tashikhyil for the use of the temple and other works. Then I went to Gonshul, Chipa, Meshul, and Gartse. At each place I taught the Dharma and gave empowerments. Everyone, out offaith, offered silver dntse and many head of horses and cattle. Then I went to Tseshung, in Mongolia, and met Kusho Lakha Rinpoche. I offered him many sacred objects and substances, including multiplying relics of great blessing, as well as many books, some flour, tsampa, horses, and clothes, and requested some teaching from him. With great kindness he gave me a hundred silver coins, a hundred pieces of cloth, thirteen horses and tk,os, and four saddles; he also gave many sheep to those who were accompanying me. I met Kusho Depa Tsang from Labrang, offered him flour, tsampa, horses, and clothes, and requested teaching from him to make a spiritual connection. He gave me one dress and a scar£ Then I met Pontsang Chingwang Rinpoche, and offered him flour, tsampa, horses, and clothes, with relics of the three kinds and long-life pills. In return he gave me a plate, some brocades, and a ceremonial scarf[ 446b]. We vowed to meet again. Then fighting broke out between the tribes of Banak Khasum and the two tribes of Hor. Because of this, I had to return quickly to the site of the fighting, and could not visit the many patrons from Mongolia who had invited me. On my way back, I reached Upper Namo Wen in Hor. Many people mounted on horses, led by the chieftain of Hor, came to welcome me. The whole population requested teachings, and I gave empowerments for long life and pros-perity to a crowd of over a thousand people.

Following this, I gave a lot of gifts to many fierce bandit chiefs, made them promise not to rob anymore, and enforced the law on banditry. Having stopped the fighting between Banak and the two other tribes, I gradually brought them to an agreement. Many people came to offer me horses, dzos, dris, yaks, multicolored leather boxes,48 woolen bags, fox-skins, butter, and cheese. I gave food and clothing to all the monks who were accompanying me, and to everyone else, including the Chinese beggars. To pay for this, I gave away seventy-five horses and other animals, large and small. To the wonder of all the patrons I gave a horse each to some people who had been killing marmots, and made them swear never to hunt anymore.

The people asked that I give some teach-ing; I gave empowerments and explained the Dharma to all, turning their minds toward the sublime teachings. I responded to the invitations of all the faith-ful who invited me to their homes, and said for them prayers and wishes of auspiciousness. They offered me horses, cattle, and sheep, and much butter and cheese.

Some people who were ignorant of the reasons why this had happened said that the monks had refused to drink out of sectarianism [ 449a]. \"What-ever the truth, it was an obstacle to my virtuous intention. I felt sad to have been unable to make this distribution, and left some money to make a general tea offering later on. Then I went to visit, one by one, the patrons Lheba, Palchog, Dushul, and others. They all came to welcome me on horses. Arriving at their homes, I taught the Dharma, gave empower-ments, and was invited everywhere. Many of them offered silver coins in packets of fifty, and numerous horses, cattle, and sheep. Then I went to two places in Upper Mangra, Dratsa Chador and Benshul. People came to welcome me on the way with food. They made a common offer-ing of fifty pieces of sweet cheese and of melted butter. At their request, I gave them empower-ments and spiritual instructions, and went to their homes. They offered many horses and cattle. Then the powerful siddha Perna Rangdrol, with all the patrons from Khyamru Kangtsa in Lower Mangra, came to fetch me. I went to his residence, where he held a great feast and of-fered me hundreds of sweet buttered cheeses. I gave elaborate empowerments for longevity and prosperity to a gathering of several thousand people from Trornllia, and gave them teachings on the truth of the karmic law of cause and effect.

Better not to have any helpers and servants at all Than to have many who don't listen to a thing you say. Better to remain childless Than to have a son who creates problems and contention. Better to have no wife than to marry a demoness Who quarrels with husband, family, and servants. Better to throw them out the door Than to keep at home children who misbehave. Spread some sand on the kitchen fires Of the cantankerous old men who constantly boil the soup of endless complaints. Praise the nice old ladies Who always have a smile for everyone [450b]. If your life is spent in the happiness of Dharma practice, It will have been meaningful to have obtained a human body. May the minds of all the patrons, men and women, who hear this song Tum toward the holy Dharma. May auspiciousness and abundance prevail in this land And the earth be covered with wealth and cattle. On hearing this song, everyone became filled with faith; many bandits and thieves gave up their activities; the laws on robbery and theft were enforced. I instituted the regular obser-vance of one-day vows, the fasting practice, and the Offering of the Twenty-Fifth, 51 of the Tenth, and the other auspicious days. 52 The great siddha Perna Rangdrol presented me with fifteen horses and cattle, and fifty sheep, of which I offered half back to him."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Then, one after the other, I went to the districts in K.angtsa Khyam in the Mangra prov-ince, which were under the authority of the Shabdrung of Hrinag Tharshul in Rang Ngen. There I gave my blessings and protection to all, performed phowa for the old men and women, and recited dedication prayers and wishes of auspiciousness. Every day, people would come and offer forty of fifty head of horses and cattle, as well as many sheep. I also received many silver dotre. With this, I offered to Ragya Monas-tery f:tfty horses, tkos, dris and yaks large and small, eight loads ofbutter, and six bags ofbar-ley. To lliamo Dechen Monastery I offered fifty horses, dris, tkos, and yaks, ten loads of butter, and ten silver coins for distributing tea and soup. Before the great Crowned Buddha of Trika I placed a large butter-lamp worth two hundred silver coins [45la], lighted a thousand lamps, and made vast prayers. To each of the thirty-six monasteries of the T rika district I offered one tko and one sang of silver. About twenty horses and tkos went to people who came to gather funds for various monasteries. Since my two disciples Khepa and Tshegon were restoring the temple of Achung Namdzong, I offered a horse and two loads of butter and cheese. I met Dechen Ponlop Rinpoche, offered him a horse and some brocade, and requested a teaching to establish a spiritual connection. I met the reincarnation of Arik Geshe Rinpoche, offered him some precious relics and a horse, and requested his spiritual protection. Machak Tulku came to meet me and I offered him the empowerment and reading transmission of the Sixteen Spheres. He presented me with a horse, which I offered back to him. That winter, many of those accompanying me stayed at Chuzang; I myself stayed in retreat at Madram Machak Monastery, on the banks of the Machu River. As a contribution to the monastic community, I offered horses and some cattle--seven head altogether.ln the main temple · I erected a statue of the Great Lord. 53 That year, too, many monks came by, one after the other, to raise funds for their monasteries. Altogether, I gave them eighty horses, tkos, dris, and yaks. I bought seven dotre and thirteen horses' worth of trampa and gave it to the many beggars Return to Dorney 509 of Chuzang. As this still wasn't enough, I also gave over a hundred sheep to be traded away, thus saving more than hundred beggars from certain death by starvation [ 451 b]. Then I wrote for my disciples and benefactors in U, Tsang, and Ngari provinces this letter of advice called the White Banner q[Praise, and sent it with my disciple Tashi lliunpo, who was going to the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang, via Kham and Lokha: Supreme objects of offering and prostration, Sole ornament of the universe, the two Shakyajowos and the two Victors, Father and Son, I supplicate you: look upon us with compassion And bless us so that our aspirations will be fulfilled in harmony with the Dharma! At the beginning I received instructions from a spiritual master, In the middle I practiced in a mountain hermitage, And in the end I established disciples and patrons in virtue. Thus I, Shabkarpa, ''White Foot,\" Practiced virtue in the beginning, middle, and end. The white flag that heralds The many excellent dharmic deeds I've performed In the five years since returning to Dorney From the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang, Waves in all directions.

Although we all, master and disciples, Met with many hazards on the way, By the grace of the Victorious Ones, Father and Son, We reached Dokham safe and sound. By expounding the Dharma-chiefly the law of cause and effect-To religious and laypeople and the chieftains of this area, I was able to put an end to robbery and theft in Upper Rekong And to all the feuds and disputes in Lower Rekong. Today, since there are no more attacks and thefts in the area of Rongpo, A new sun of unprecedented peace and happiness has arisen there, And happy tales resound in the ten directions. There r>eople offered me food, cattle, and wealth, according to their means. As soon as these had been offered to me, Without storing or accumulating it, I used it To serve the spiritual teachers around, Making offerings to sacred objects of the body, speech, and mind of the Buddhas, Making distributions of money and tea to the monastic communities, Giving alms to thousands of needy beggars, And buying animals to free them and save their lives. Particularly, having in mind the prosperity of the Dharma and all beings, As well as the long life of the two Victors, Father and Son, I restored many damaged temples and sacred objects, And in monasteries and villages built temples where there were none [452b]-Altogether a hundred and eight templ~, Ten thousand statues, large and small, as symbols of the Buddha's body, One thousand volumes of sutras, tantras, and commentaries, as symbols of the Buddha's speech, And over a hundred stupas, large and small, as symbols of the Buddha's mind. Besides this, many hermitages were built in secluded places, People molded many hundreds of thousands of small statues and tsa-tsas, And many stayed in retreat and practiced the Dharma. In brief, directly or indirectly I was able to bring great benefit to the Dharma and to many beings. The sheer joy of celestial and human beings who delight in virtue And particularly of my gurus, spiritual compamons, Disciples and patrons, by tens and hun-dreds of thousands, Expands as a billowing cloud of offerings.

I pray that in accordance with my wish, Quickly reaching U, I may make offerings to thejowo, the Wish-fulfilling Gem, Serve the two Victorious Ones, Father and Son, And benefit the Dharma and all beings.

By the grace of the two Victorious Ones, our lords, our refuge, By the faith and devotion of disciples and patrons, And by the strength of my perfectly pure wishes, May all our aspirations quickly be fulfilled! I also sent a missive called the Song of the Ntghtingale, a spiritual song called the Gentle Call of the Blue Cuckoo, a song of excellent aspiration called the Melodious Lute and Flute, and the supreme teaching of the Sublime Drumbeat of the Golden Radi-ance. 54 These appear in my Collected Songs. It was said that when these reached the hands of my disciples and patrons, they felt boundless joy, as though meeting me in person. Return to Dorney 511 The next year my spiritual sons Drupchen, Onpo, Kardri, Tayen, and others stayed at Chuzang and built a temple with an image of the crowned Buddha [ 453b]. For this we spent the equivalent of three dotse of gold leaf, paint, and varnish, twenty horses, rk:.os, yaks, and dris, fifty sheep, and thirteen silver coins as wages for the artists, and twenty horses and head of cattle and twenty-five silver coins for the carpenters. With many dis-ciples I went from Chuzang to the Bhel area. We met Gyaza Tripa Rinpoche of Serlag Monastery, the holder of the throne ofGyaza. As a contribution to the construction of the new monastery, I offered him fifteen horses and head of cattle, half a large load of tea, and a load of butter; I requested teaching to make a spiritual connection. Then I went successively to the area of my old patrons Bongtag Benlo, Chokyap, the Bache RinchenJam family, Kala (the chief of Gyaza), the governor Chonyon, and the chieftain of Khonag. To all of them I gave longevity empowerments and Dharma teachings, and said prayers for them. People came to offer many dotse of silver, clothes, and head of cattle and sheep. The list of the offerings made by the nomads included thirteen hundred horses, rk:.os, dris, and yaks large and small, seventeen hun-dred sheep, one hundred and eighty skins of butter, one hundred loads of cheese, ten big bundles of tea, thirty-three dotse, seventy whole pieces of dyed leather, and sixty pairs of boots of the same material, forty fox-skins, over five hun-dred lengths of cloth and printed woolen mate-rial [ 454a], and several thousand large and small ceremonial scarves. At that time, for the sake of disciples and patrons, I uttered this blessing for perfect auspi-ciousness: Om Suasti! May there be the perfection of a sky filled with Buddhas!

Mter I said this, grass grew in all arid places, and water surged forth where there had been no water before; these and other auspicious things happened in the district of Bhel Mangra, arous-ing in everyone greater faith and respect than ever. I then met the reembodiment of the omni-scient Shingsa Rinpoche55 and offered him a horse. I met Alak Gonpo of Labrang and the reembodiment of Jetsun Jamyang Gyatso Rinpoche, and offered each of them a horse. I met too the reembodiment of Gyal Khenchen Rinpoche, my most kind root teacher, who had taken rebirth in the family of Alm Bendhe of Gyaza. I offered him fifteen horses and rk.os, fifty sheep, and ten sang of silver, with some loads of tea, butter and cheese. I offered Tsang Monas-tery thirty rk.os, dris, yaks, and horses, and four loads of butter and one big package of tea. Then a feud broke out between the people of Rekong and the three ·districts of Banak Khasum. Chang Tse Khen Rinpoche and myself went to conciliate the two sides. We succeeded in pacifying the quarrel and bringing things back to the Dharma; thus many lives were saved. Mter this I came back to the hermitage of Tashikhyil and stayed there in retreat. While in retreat I composed the Wondrous Emanated Scrip-tures, 56 which explains the need to give up meat, alcohol, and women. It makes one reflect upon the negativity associated with their enjoyment and quotes excerpts from many scriptures [ 455a]. In summer, remembering the places where my root guru of unfaltering kindness, the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo, and his consort, had first stayed, I felt a great desire to go there. Accord-ingly, I proceeded through Sazang. First I met Rinpoche's son, inquired about his health, and presented my offerings to him. He himself gave me some brocades and other presents. Then I met Kusho Lakha Rinpoche, a Bodhisattva who had reached the bhwnis, and staying over a month in his presence, I received from him the empowerments and transmissions for both the Rigrk;in Dupa, 7he Gathering of tk Vufyadharas and the Khandro Dechen Gyalmo, 7he S9-Jaring Qyeen ofGreatB!iss, from the cycle of the Longchen Nyingthig, 7he Heart Essence of tk Great"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Expanse. 57 In return, I offered him the empower-ment of the Sixteen Spheres qf tlze Kadompas, and the blessings and transmission of the collections of sadhanas called the Source qf]ewels. 58 I also offered him three volumes of the Sealed Vz.sWns, 59 and other useful books, as well as some fine tsampa. He gave me fifteen horses and cattle, fifty sheep, thirty length of cloth, tea, butter and all sorts of helpful things. Mter this I met the supreme reembodiment of]etsun Sonam Trakpa, the Dharma heir of the teachings of the profound path ofChod. I offered him some tsampa and requested from him the transmission for the text of the Profound Pacifying Path qf Cutting Through.60 We had many discus-sions which pleased him [ 455b]. He gave me presents and provisions. Following this I responded to the invitations of the chieftain Tsige, of the chieftain of Mon-golia, and of many other faithful patrons. I gave them longevity blessings and Dharma teachings. In conclusion, I sang this song of advice on worldly and religious ethics: I bow down to the Omniscient One: Look with compassion upon me and all beings! Listen to this beneficial advice On both divine and human dharmas. When any newcomer arrives, as soon as you see him, Ask after his health with a smiling face. Any guest who comes must be received like a deity; Offer him some tea and chang, and talk with him in a pleasant way. Speak suitably and with measure, Not saying everything that crosses your mind. Gentle speech and a broad mind will accomplish Every aim, whether for yourself or for others. Return to Dorney 513 Explain the reasons: if you don't give clear explanations, Even your own father won't understand. Give good advice: if you don't teach the good and the bad in detail, Even your own child won't listen. Give food and clothes to those around you, servants and relatives. If you don't, even your own son won't stay around. Become skilled in either religious or worldly matters: No one learns without effort. Don't consider an outsider as an enemy: Make a friend of him; that will be good for you. Keep to the humblest position and you will be respected by all: The greatness of a good person does not need an enthronement. Even when persons of bad character put themselves forward, In others' eyes they are merely objects of shame and derision. Just mouthing kind words won't please your relatives; Be sincerely eager to do what benefits them [456a]. A big mouth will not defeat an enemy; Better subdue him through gentleness and skillful means. Great miserliness will not accumulate wealth; You must know how to give and receive. Even if the wife is wise in giving counsel, It looks better if the husband decides. Treat a good friend well, And he will be with you in a time of need."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"514 The Life of Shabkar Remain umuffied both in success and in adversity.

Do not praise the good prematurely; They might do evil later. Don't scold or beat your servants fiercely, Or there won't be a single person left around you. Do not exercise power ruthlessly.

May whoever hears this excellent advice Be ofbenefit to his fellow human beings! As I sang this, everyone's thoughts turned to the Dharma. Many people offered horses, cattle, cheese, and butter. I proceeded to Thayenchi, the pleasant se-cluded grove of Tseshung [456b], and stayed there for a week. I repaired my retreat hut and had an arm-size statue of Lord Buddha erected inside it, for the making of which I gave one dzo to the sculptor. While I stayed there, many people came from Tsang Arik to meet me and offered much butter and cheese. I taught the Dharma and said prayers of dedication. I installed my spiritual sons Rigdrol and Khampa Drupchen in retreat and left an annual allowance for them. I then went to the upper end of the sunny slopes where the Dharma King and his consort lived when they frrst came. I offered prostrations and prayers, and remembering my guru, sang this song of grief and longing: Gurus whom I met and heard, You have dissolved your manifest bodies into absolute space And now dwell in the invisible expanse: Think upon me with compassion and bless me! The gurus of my homeland, Whose faces I saw, whose voices I heard: What joy if they were here now! I yearn to meet them, to serve them! Today, not one of them remains; They have all departed for other Pure Realms, And I, unfortunate, am left behind With none of my gurus still in this world. Thinking and thinking, my tears pour down like rain. I remember my gurus one by one And think, \"This one is no more; that one is gone.\" Thinking and thinking, my mind reels with sadness.

Before it comes, I shall practice the divine Dharma, And pray that in the next life I may meet my gurus In the pure Buddhafields. As I sang this, I remembered my lamas, one by one. Particularly, when rememberingvividlythe Dharma King and his consort, an unfathomable sadness swept through my mind and I shed many tears. On my way back, I came to the Shukdu retreat center of Upper Rekong and stayed there a few days to establish a connection with that holy place. The patrons from Khasog Lakha, Karon-khok, Tsenmo Thang, and other nearby villages and nomad grounds invited me and I visited them all. They offered me many horses and other animals. I said some prayers and wishes of auspiciousness; having gathered all the people of the area I taught the Dharma and sang spiritual songs, thus turning everyone's minds to the Dharma. Then I visited Dzong Kar and Dzong Ngon, the ''White and the Blue Fortresses,\"61 as well as Dechen Gonpa, the \"Monastery of Great Bliss.\" I offered butter-lamps in the temple and made a general offering of money and tea to the monks. As a contribution to the Maitreya temple built by Kusho Dzong Ngon, I offered one horse and many precious relics. In return, he gave me sacred objects related to body, speech and mind, together with horses, clothes, and corals. Having returned to Tashikhyil, I entered into retreat. During this retreat I composed the Emanated Scripture of Pure Vzsion, 62 in which I explained the need to develop pure perception, faith, and respect toward all the great and holy lamas who did not reject sense-pleasures, but enjoyed them as ornaments, as well as toward all the yogin practitioners of the two stages of the Mantrayana [457b].63 Return to Dorney 515 Mter this, for one year I again went to the area of Hrinag and Chenza for the sake of the nomads there. I gave empowerments for long-life and prosperity to the Hrinag lamas and all the patrons, gave teachings on the law of karma, and sang them this song of beneficial advice: I bow down to those knowledgeable in temporal and spiritual ethics: Grant your blessing that I may be able to distinguish right from wrong. Human and celestial beings, for the sake of your happiness Listen to this beneficial song of mine. Do not be contemptuous toward those in difficulty; Misfortune may come to you one day. Do not show off when everything goes well; Good fortune comes to others also. Don't make those who gave wrong advice feel guilty; You too will make mistakes. Don't demand gratitude in return for your help; Let your generosity fade away unrecognized. A person is judged by the gentleness of his speech and of his actions; Try to act in harmony with all. If you neither lie nor deceive, Wherever you go, you will fmd food and clothing. If you speak little and you are honest, Wherever you stay people will like you. If your wants are few and you know how to be content, Everyone will be your friend."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"516 The Life of Shabkar Do not put power into the hands of a base person; He will get everyone into trouble.

May this song benefit the mind Of all who hear it. May goodness prevailing in all directions, Long-life, good health, and happiness be enjoyed by all. Having sung this, I calling for blessings and made prayers of auspiciousness for the benefit of the area. From then on, illnesses ofboth humans and cattle subsided, and good grass grew on the plain of Chenza, where there had been none before. Consequently, all the patrons became filled with faith and respect. They also offered me a hundred horses and seventy sheep. Bandits vowed not to rob and kill, and many people committed themselves to perform virtuous actions. At that time the bursar Orgyen and a few people accompanying him were departing for the Pure Realm ofU-Tsang to make offerings there. As offerings, I sent with them ten dotse of Chinese silver, carpets, some dyed leather, corals, tur-quoise, a lot ofbrocade [458b] and ceremonial scarves, and thirty-three horses and dzos.

The patrons of both Upper and Lower Gurong offered me five mules with saddles, saddle carpets, and har-nesses; ten dzomos, dris, yaks, and oxen; and thirty goats and sheep [ 460a]. The temple at Mani Thang in Gurong had been burned down by armies of Chinese Salars, who later committed themselves to rebuild the temple. I offered a statue of Lord Buddha made of precious lima alloy, sacred relics, and earth and water that came from various parts of the world. Then going to Shingkar, to Gurteng, and to Nangra, I bestowed empowerments and gave teaching, turning the minds of all towards the Dharma. I paid homage and made offerings to the image of the Buddha that had been conse-crated by the Dharma Lord Do Rinpoche and that is the main sacred object of the Golden Temple of Nangra. I urged all the patrons to have a fence built by the army around the temple. I also repaired a large stupa. Mter this, I proceeded towards Lo Dorje Drak65 and paid homage to the famed Prqjna-paramita ofLowa, which had been written in gold by dakinis who had transformed themselves into vultures. I also consecrated the stupa ofKyaring. Then I went to Ri Nyingpo, where I stayed many days. I gave teachings on the nature of mind to many faithful yogins. I repaired the back of the Temple of the Great Dharma Wheel, and helped the abbot, Konchog, and the other monks staying there. I went to Trulche and Doring, and per-formed the consecration of the Mani Temple. Going to many districts in the areas of Hor Pashi, Hrinag, Kyamtsang, Totsang, Shodzom Lakha, Keu Chu, and so on, I gave long-life empowerments, taught the Dharma, and also sang this spiritual song [ 460b]: Gurus and the Three Jewels filled with grace, Bless the body, speech and mind of those gathered here! Listen to this song, which tells What chieftains, faithful men and women need. o~to say good things, Two-to have good thoughts within, Ihree--to always tell the truth, Four-to ponder everything carefully, Five-to be impartial, and Six-to want little for yourself: These are what a chief needs."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"One-great generosity, Two--a fierce and impressive appearance, 17zr~an unwavering mind, Four-the grit to face an adversary, should one anse, Five-a stable mind in a strong body, and Six-a sense of moderation: These are what a man needs.

Filled with faith, men and women offered me four mules, two dzomos, forty cows and bulls, two hundred bags of barley [46la], fifteen mats of white felt, eighteen bricks ofblack tea, thirteen rifles, thirty porcelain cups, and many pieces of turquoise and coral. Then I offered thirty dris and yaks, two loads of butter, and fifty sheep to Dechen Gonpa, the Monastery of Great Bliss. As a contribution for the repair of the Temple of the Crowned Bud-dha, I offered a hundred silver coins with tea, butter, and tsampa. To all the small and big monasteries around, I offered two, three, or four horses and head of cattle, forty in all. A feud had occurred at Mapha Ri between the tribes of Adarchaka and Sheshin, causing the killing of many people. I went there and settled their dispute through various means. Return to Dorney 519 One day I had gone for a stroll at Shisar-the location that had been the cause of the feud. I was sitting in the cool shade of the hollow trunk of a large tree, when an old Chinese Mongol came, and stared at me for a long time. Finally he said, \"Hey! I've heard of you before, but I never thought I would meet you. What a plea-sure it is to meet you today! In the past when one spoke of a 'good lama', one would speak of Arik Geshe; these days people are speaking of you, Alak Shabkar. I don't have any wealth, but please come and have a cup of tea at my place.\" I went, and having drunk some tea and eaten a piece of bread I told him [ 461 b J, 'We don't know when we will die. Have a good heart; don't be cruel to people at home. If you don't die too soon, you will fmd some wealth and the end of your life will be without hardship. When your children have grown up, life will be pleasant for both parents and children.\" Before leaving, I said some prayers of dedication. As I sang verses of auspiciousness, a Chinese woman who was there became moved by faith and started to weep. The old man escorted me and said, \"Alak, come again from time to time!\" and I replied, \"Yes, yes, ifl don't die I will come. Be well!\" and he added, \"Be well too, Alak!\" and went back to his house. My close disciple Tendzin Nyima had built a new temple on the plain of Adarchaka. For that I contributed eighteen horses and other cattle, one bundle of ten thousand yellow paper sheets, and three bundles of one thousand, as well as much tsampa, butter, and tea. The chief of Adarchaka offered one mule, a rifle, a shanglang cymbal66 and a package of black tea. Kyargo offered a horse and many turquoise and corals. Other local people, too, offered a lot of food, wheat and barley, cattle and other valuables. Then I went to Chakyung Gonpa, the Garuda Monastery. I offered forty horses, tk:_os, dris and yaks large and small, as well as four loads of butter and four bundles of black tea. Also, I made a general distribution of tea and alms to the monks. I sent two of my disciples, Drupchen and Neten, to bring the following letter to both the all-knowing Kusho Changkya67 and Chuzang Rinpoche [462a]:"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"520 Th£ Life qf Shab/w.r Supreme Omniscient Changkya and Chuzang Rinpoche, 0 glory of the southern continentJambudvipa, you rise like the radiant sun and moon together in the infmite sky that has neither center nor periphery. I, the vaga-bond yogin Shabkar, respectfully offer countless prostrations at your feet adorned with golden wheels. Fulfilling our prayers, both of you, precious and supreme objects of refuge, remain in good health and, out of your vast aspirations, show the greatest possible kindness to beings, display-ing the great waves of your activities for the sake of the teachings and sentient beings. By the compassion of the guru and the Three Jewels, I am well in body and mind, and, like a small bird trying to imitate an eagle, looking up at the lives of the great saints of the past I train in the Bodhisattva's activity as best I can. For the sake of the Dharma and all beings, according to your aspirations, both of you, pre-cious lords and objects of refuge, have built without hindrance a temple more wonderful than any before, filled with sacred objects [ 462b]. With one voice, celestial and human beings claim that it is just as though the Rasa Tsuglakhang Temple of Lhasa, erected by King Songtsen Gampo in the Pure Realm of U-Tsang, had been transported with all its sacred objects, to become the glory of the beings that need to be benefited in Dorney. Hearing this pleasant news resound in the ten directions of space, not once but many times, like the rumble of the summer thunder-dragon, my faith, my respect, my pure perception, and my desire to meet you increase like the waters of a lake in summertime. With great delight I rejoice, and not just in words. Again I pray with folded hands that for the sake of the Dharma and all beings you live long, and that your pure activities continue to increase year after year. I shall always offer, to the best of my ability, prayers for your long lives, 0 great beings who hold the life-tree of the teaching. Supreme objects of refuge! Always nurture in the expanse of your vast and profound mind the spiritual protection that you extend to me and my peers, who are and will be your disciples throughout our lives, until enlightenment. Heed me! Heed me! Today I offer you this letter along with two good horses, one mule, and a pair of immacu-late ceremonial scarves, from the holy place of the Garuda, on this auspicious month and date. Again I said in verse: In the vast sky without center or periphery, Radiant, like the sun and moon rising together [463a], You shine beautifully, 0 glory of this southern continent of the Rose-apple Tree. I, the carefree happy yogin who roams carelessly Through mountain wildernesses, Offer countless prostrations with utter respect At your lotus feet, 0 my protectors. Folding hands at my heart, I present you with these words: You both achieved Buddhahood long ago, Yet, for the sake of those beings to be helped in this degenerate age, You assumed with great kindness the form of holders of the three saffron robes, And have worked for the benefit of the Dharma and all living beings. By the compassion of the gurus and the Three Jewels I am well in body and in mind. Like a small bird trying to imitate an eagle, I struggle to follow the lives of the saints of the past. When I heard time and again, resounding like the summer thunder-dragon, The delightful news that, within no time, You had completed the construction of a temple Which was as though the magically arisen Rasa Temple, Erected long ago at the time of the Dharma King, Had been transported with all its contents to Lower Dokham, Again and again, faith, respect, pure perception, Rejoicing and the wish to meet you arose."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Now comes the core of my request, 0 lords, exalted objects of refuge: Live long and increase even further Your activity for the Dharma and all beings-This is the prayer I repeatedly make, Not merely paying lip service [463b]. I beg your spiritual protection, So that I and all your disciples, my peers, Be accepted by you and never part from you, My refuge, my protectors, Throughout our lives, until we reach enlightenment. So that my request for your protection may not be without any support, I offer you three horses and mules, together with immaculate scarves, Most respectfully, on this auspicious date and month, From the Monastery of the Garuda, source of all benefit and bliss. When the messengers who had gone to carry this letter came back and gave me all the news and details, my desire to meet these two great beings increased even more. For a while I remained there, making offer-ings to the Golden Reliquary of the Garuda Monastery and other sacred objects, meeting the lamas, requesting their spiritual protection, and doing prostrations and circumambulations. Then I went to Dosho and a few other districts, and helped beings. Many people offered me great quantities of wheat, barley, and silver coins. I also went to pay homage to the Lhachen Palbar, the \"Mahadeva Ablaze with Glory\" of Shongchen, and made prayers and offerings. After this, accompanied by a few people, I went up and stayed overnight at Serkhang, the \"Golden Mansion.\" The next morning, starting early from the peak on the right side, we went round Tsongkha Kyeri Mountain. We started by walk-ing and rode mules on the other side of the mountain, finally reaching Chuzang. There we met the all-knowing Kusho Changkya. I offered him a statue of Amitayus, the Buddha of Eternal Life, a copy of the Treasury qf the Sublime Vehicle,68 and the mule I had been Return to Dorney 521 riding on, with its saddle and harness. I requested from him the transmission of the commentary on the mind-training teaching known as 1he Wheel q[Sha:rp Weapons [464a].69 I met Kusho Chuzang Rinpoche too, offered him apparel and requested a spiritual connec-tion. I met the tulku of the precious throne-holder ofGyanak, offered him apparel, and asked his protection. On the occasion of the celebration marking the completion of the new temple, Kusho Changkya Rinpoche, the venerable Chuzang, Gyanak Sertri Tulku, the venerables Shar, Ragor, andjedrung, and many other great lamas went to make a purifying offering of fragrant smoke on the pass above the K yela Cairn. After that, tents having been pitched down on the plain, a great feast was given. Complying with the com-mand of the supreme refuge Changkya Rinpoche to sing a spiritual song, I sang about the Five Perfections: Lord gurus who bestow blessings, Tidam deities who grant accomplishments, Assembly of d~is who dispel obstacles, Remain as ornaments on the wheel crown-ing my head, And shower a rain of blessings and siddh:is Upon all the virtue-loving human and celestial beings assembled here. Here, at a time of perfect joy and happi-ness, I shall sing a cheering and joyous song. The place is a wondrous Pure Realm, The Lord is the Vajradhara Changkya, The retinue consists of the pure and fortunate disciples, The teachings are the unsurpassable Dharma of the Great Vehicle, And the time is the zenith of the golden age. Everything is truly perfect and auspicious! [464b]. In this sublime, all-perfect, sacred place, Gurus and tutelary deities gather like clouds;"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"522 The Life of Shabkar Dakas and dakinis are vivid as rambows; Guardians and protectors of the Dharma flash like lightning; Blessings and siddhis shower down like ram; Fame and glory rumble like thunder; Enjoyment and abundance brim like a lake; Happiness and satisfaction shine like the sun; Meditative experiences and realization wax like the moon: Everything is truly perfect and auspicious! May this all-perfect song Bring happiness and well-being to all who hear it; Through all-perfect happiness and well-being May the auspiciousness of practicing the divine Dharma prevail! Then, modifying slightly the Wondrous Happy Song that I had sung earlier on the occasion of a ganaclzakra feast, I sang this: To receive wondrous blessings, We have our own gurus and those of the lineage. We don't need to look for other blessings. How happy we are! To attain ordinary and supreme siddhis We have the assembly of the peaceful and wrathful deities. We don't need to look for other siddhis; How happy we are! To dispel obstacles and unfavorable circumstances We have the dakinis and dharmapalas of the three planes. We don't need to look for other guardian deities; How happy we are! To attain enlightenment in one lifetime, We have the instructions of the Secret Mantrayana, which ripen and free [465a]. There is no doubt that we will become enlightened; How happy we are! As companions in accomplishing unsurpassable enlightenment, We have vajra brothers and sisters of pure samaya. Together we will attain Buddhahood; How happy we are! As the supreme field for accumulating merit, We have erected sacred objects of the body, speech, and mind. All our wishes will be accomplished; How happy we are! On hearing this happy song, May our gurus, brothers, and sisters be pleased, May all celestial and human beings who delight in virtue rejoice; May all be auspicious in this land. Hearing this, the lamas, notables, and everyone else there were very pleased. Changkya Rinpoche presented me with a long ceremonial scar£ Though these two great teachers had already performed one hundred and eight consecration ceremonies, they asked me to perform one, too, and to say prayers of auspiciousness, which I did. Extremely pleased, they gave me one dotse of Chinese silver, one horse, two pieces ofbrocade; a rosary ornamented with corals and two long ceremonial silk scarves. I accepted these except for the silver, which I offered back to them. I also made a thousandfold offering70 in the temple, a general distribution of tea to the monks, and alms to the beggars. I sealed all with pure prayers for the long life of the two protectors and other prayers [465b]. I uttered a command to the Chinese spirits not to cause any harm to the masters' relatives. I gave them a protecting bless-ing, which kept them well. Although some patrons from the area of Palri invited me to visit them, I told them, \"I cannot come now, but I will try to come later,\""},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"and did not go. Then I thought that it would be quite convenient to go with Changkya Rinpoche on pilgrimage to the Five-peaked Mountain of China. I told this to this great being, who replied, \"According to your aspirations you benefited beings from central Tibet to Dorney. If you for-sake helping others here and go to the Five-peaked Mountain, you will indeed pay homage to a holy place, but you won't be able to continue benefiting others. The reason for this is that you know neither Chinese nor Mongolian, and, not being able to communicate with people, even if you meet them, it will be just like one animal meeting another. \"In the past you have been able to help all those who live in Rongpo, Rekong, and on both sides of the Machu River. These are people who could not be tamed by the countless Buddhas who have already come on this earth; they are tough people who don't stay home and who kill many people with little reason. If you can con-tinue to help them for a few more years, it will be a hundred times more beneficial than to go to the Five-peaked Mountain. You have reached a ripe old age; it is very hot in China [466a]. Who knows if the conditions there will suit your health? One cannot be sure that there won't be some obstacles to your life. Since in your own country the water agrees with you/ 1 and you benefit beings more and more, it seems to me that it would be best for you to remain here.\" Echoing this, the Omniscient One of Shar said, \"Don't go to other places. By the power of your past prayers and aspirations, and by the skillfulness of the means you have displayed in the present time, you have helped Upper, Middle and Lower Rekong. If, for a few more years, without feeling disheartened, you continue to benefit and tame the wild people of these places, not only it will be an inexhaus11ble cloud of offering to the Buddhas of the three times, but it will please the teachers of this decadent age, such as mysel£\" In accordance with their words, I gave up the idea of going to the Five-peaked Mountain. When I came back to benefit beings at Khagang in Mapha Ri, I received this missive in verse from Alak Lhoncho, the eminent spiritual son ofJetsun Serkhang Rinpoche: Return to Dorney 523 At the feet of the great holder of the mantra teachings, The one who has seen inherent primordial mind, Luminous and devoid of concepts, Who has realized the illusory nature of whatever arises, The yogin free from doing and not-doing, accepting and rejecting [ 466b], An insignificant old beggar monk will speak frankly to you. Having seen the mad dance of the eight worldly concerns, And the condition of samsara-a pit of burning coals-An intense weariness and renunciation shook your being, And, entering the door of the teachings, You reached the very summit of the Secret Mantras. Alone, like a wounded deer, You roamed from wilderness to wilderness, And having cleared away all doubts through study, reflection, and meditation, Your meditation experiences and realization became vast as space, You freed yourself from the chains of clinging to subject and object. Naturally your action became free of doing and not-doing, accepting and rejecting. Moved by irresistible loving-kindness and purity of intention, You strive in all ways to aid all beings and teachings without distinction; Gathering disciples through the four ways, You ripen and free them; Paying boundless honor to the sacred objects ofbody, speech, and mind, You serve and help all monastic communities; You pacify quarrels through skillful means, And bathe all things in the radiance of the jewel of pure perception."},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"524 The life of Shabkar I too rejoice at your amazing life and deeds With all of my heart. We are now at the most degenerate point of a degenerate age. At this time, when the hidden faults of this dark age are on the increase, When harm is returned for good, Though people may deceive and slander you, Don the armor of patience And the indomitable courage of cherishing others more than yoursel£ To benefit the Dharma and all beings [467a], Leading an utterly perfect life in the image Of Samantabhadra, Manjushri, Avalokiteshvara, and others, I request that you remain in this world for an ocean ofkalpas. Protect me so that, through my virtuous thoughts and actions, however small, Such as doing a few prayers, recitations and the like, I may serve the Dharma and all beings, And attain unsurpassable enlightenment. I respectfully offer these requests with a scarf and a few presents. By this merit, may all sentient beings--our mothers-fmd happiness. In answer I sent him some news and our mutual pure perception increased. Hail had damaged the crops at Khagang. Mter I gave a blessing, no more hailstorms came that way. At that time I gave this oral advice to my disciples and patrons, sons and daughters of Shakyamuni's spiritual lineage: May all the supreme beings who have come in the past Grant their blessings. The sublime protector of beings, Nagatjuna, said: Taking support of the Dharma ofhuman beings, The celestial realm is not far. Taking support of the Dharma of celestial and human beings, Liberation is near. Accordingly, if you follow the Dharma tradition of celestial and human beings You will achieve the ultimate excellence of liberation. Therefore, first of all, to obtain the excellent condition of celestial and human beings. Maintaining a sense of shame and propriety Always avoid the ten negative actions [ 467b]. Toward your parents, relatives, and all beings, Look with the eyes oflove and affection. Encourage everyone to practice the sublime Dharma And tum them away from wrong actions. Offer to the guru and the Three Jewels; Give to those who have nothing. Serve the old; respect your parents. Be helpful to the guest coming from afar; Care for those who are chronically ill. Repair damaged boats, bridges, and roads; Build river embankments and shelters. Guide people across perilous paths, rivers, And areas where enemies and brigands abound. Ransom the lives of goats, sheep, birds, Game and fish which are about to be killed. Pray with folded hands, walk round, and bow down To stupas, temples, and sacred images."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Looking at them with admiring eyes and making offerings, Restore old monuments and repair those that are damaged or destroyed. Making no distinctions between strangers and those who are dear, With equanimity and gentleness inspire everyone to practice Dharma. Doing away with anger, quarrels, and arguments, Remain in harmony with everyone's mind. Though someone may say unpleasant things to you, Do not utter harsh words in return. Always be broad-minded and good-natured; Do not harm others, help them as much as you can. Never deceive, defraud or pretend; Always keep an honest mind. Never forget kindness done to you; Be well-disposed and grateful for ever. Do not upset others' minds, cut off jealousy, And get rid of rivalry, craving, hatred and dispute. When you happen to be rich, don't be haughty; Don't disdain others. When you happen to be poor, don't be disheartened [468a]; See it as the mere result of your past actions. The temporal and the spiritual are for the most part in agreement, 72 So act in harmony with both society and the Dharma. In brief, give up nonvirtue and accomplish virtue, Return to Dorney 525 And always have a kind mind. This is the way noble worldly people Lead their perfect lives. May this nectar-like admonition Be useful to me and to everyone else. This advice benefited the minds of all. I then came back toward Marnang Tsho-nga. The de-voted ngakpa Tamdrin and the other ngakpas of Tsho-nga's community gave me a fme welcome. Mter I taught the Dharma, many people gave up wrong actions and practiced virtue. Many people, too, erected sacred objects of the body, speech, and mind, such as the stupa ofGurchung. For these, I gave many miraculously multiplied relics of Lord Buddha and other precious relics. Out of great faith, the patrons on both banks of the Machu offered me three horses, thirty dzomos, dris, yaks, cows, and bulls; twenty goats and sheep; five bundles of tea; ten mats of white felt; a hundred bags of barley; and many cups and ceremonial scarves. Of these, I offered thirty horses, dzos, dris, yaks, cows and bulls to the various monasteries on both banks of the river. I also began building one hundred and eight temples in separate monasteries and villages, and making several hundred volumes of the holy scriptures, stupas, and mani wheels. 73 To pay for these, I offered an almost incalculable number of bars of silver, horses, dzos, dris, yaks, cows, bulls, goats, and sheep [468b];-bundles of tea, lengths of cloth, brocade, ceremonial scarves, and bags of barley and wheat. I offered this prayer for everyone: \"By virtue of the meritorious deeds I and others have performed throughout the three times, symbolized by these present ones, may the precious Dharma of the Buddha spread, expand and prevail in all directions, places, and circum-stances. In particular, may boundless happiness and contentment befall the totality of beings under the sky. \"More especially, may all the disciples, pa-trons, and I live as long as the sun and moon; may our merit become like Mount Meru, the · king of mountains; may our fame fill the skies; may our activity for the sake of beings equal that"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"526 7he Lift of Shabkar of the Buddha; may the word 'suffering' not even be heard; may we never be parted from bliss and joy even for an instant. \"May I be able one day to dispel all the sufferings of beings. May I be able one day to establish in wealth all those stricken by poverty. May the day come when I am able to give my flesh and blood for the welfare ofbeings. May I become able one day to remain in the hell realm and bring some good there. May the day come when I am able to fulfill all the hopes of beings with the bounty of samsara and nirvana [ 469a]. May the day come when I become enlightened, a Buddha, able to remove forever the suffering of beings. May I never enjoy harming others rather than benefiting them. May the day come when all beings will become happy through the exchange of my happiness for their suffering. May all beings have happiness; May they be free of all suffering; May they never be separated from happiness; May they abide in boundless equanimity!\" Thus in accordance with the Eight Wishes of the Bodhisattvas and the Four Boundless Ones, I made an excellent concluding connection with this stainless prayer. I also offered for the assem-bly hall of Gartse monastery a silver lamp made with thirty sang of silver, and for the temple of T ashikhyil a set of offering bowls made with twenty-five silver sang worth ofbell-metal. I offered too many ritual objects to Bhupshol, Dungkar Shagpa, and other temples in various places. I offered garments and long silken scarves to many statues, and ended with aspiration prayers. I brought back seven hundred sheep to Tashikhyil, and kept them there, saving their lives. I used their wool as a resource for the monastery, and gave the other sheep that were offered to me to the people who were coming to collect donations for their monasteries, with the condition that the sheep would not be killed. For many years, I looked after sixty to sev-enty humble monks, nuns and beggars at Tashikhyil who were homeless and had no one to take care of them [ 469b]. Every year on the fifteenth day of the fourth month, I would gather several hundred religious and lay devotees for a fasting practice. During the third week of the fourth month, I would sponsor a five-day ceremony of the Eight Classes of Herukas, performed by nineteen hundred plw:rba mantra-practitioners ofRekong. 74 As an endowment for tea and butter to be distributed during this ceremony, I offered over a hundred tb:.omos and dris. As if to confirm the saying which goes, \"Wealth is a flag that calls forth enemies and demons,\" all these animals were taken by cattle rustlers from Achog in Tsa. Some thousand phurba-holding ngakpasperformed a phurba ritual; their powers being feared by everyone in the region, the thieves brought back all the animals and begged for forgiveness. From then on, thinking that hoarding is not in accord with the Dharma, I gave everything away as offerings and charity. Again, just as the saying goes, \"No more wealth, no more enemies\"; free from enemies, thieves and bandits, I enjoyed complete tranquility. Patrons from Shohong and Dzarnling provided for my sustenance. Every year I received alms ofbarley in the autumn and ofbutter in the spring. Besides this, people would help me as best they could and gave me dona-tions for prayers for the dead and other things. One day, Kathok Lama Rinpoche came from Chuzang. I invited him to the Tashikhyil Her-mitage and received him in the fmest fashion. He gave the empowerment of the peaceful and wrc.th-ful deities to the assembly of ngakpas, and to about thirty of us, master and disciples he gave the complete empowerments and reading transmis-sion of the Nyingthig Ya Shi, the Four Heart-Es-sences. 75 In thanks, I presented him with a statue of Tara, a copy of the Graded Patlz of t1ze Jewel Ornament of libera.t:Wn, a stupa in the Kadampa style [470a], one horse, one mule, and four d;:.os with saddles. Mter that, Serkhang Rinpoche, a Bodhi-sattva dwelling at a level where he benefited all"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"who made a connection with him, came to Rongpo .. I met him and offered him, as sign of homage, a statue of the Great Compassionate One and a copy of Drukpa Kunleg's life-story, together with two horse blankets. Then, when he gave the empowerments of Guf!Jasarrzt9a and Chakra-samvara to the whole assembly of the main mon-astery of Rongpo, I sat among them to receive these teachings. People from Nyenthok invited him to give a blessing of the Great Compassionate One, which I received too. One day I went into his presence; he spoke to me at length and showed me great kindness. He gave me some yellow brocade, a red shawl, many plates of sugar and fruit, two long silken scarves, and a copy of the teachings on mind training called the Rays of t1ze Sun. 76 After I had returned to Tashikhyil and was staying there, he sent Lobzang Dargye, a holder of the three trainings, as well asJampa, Khedrup, and others-six monks who had completely renounced worldly life. According to the Kagyu tradition, I gave them the transmission and detailed explanations upon Mahamudra, the Six Y ogas ofNaropa, the 7hree Cycles of Oral lineage, 77 the Nme Cycles oftlze Formless Dakini,78 and all the related yogic exercises. Then, the great spiritual son Lobzang Dargye asked for some spoken advice [470b]; I gave him this Great Wondrour Advice: The Teacher, the Buddha, Who loved all beings like his only child, said: To benefit beings Is to benefit me. To harm beings Is to harm me. Just as a mother rejoices When someone is helpful to her child, My heart is gladdened When someone is helpful to any sentient being. Just as a mother is distressed When someone harms her child, Return to Dorney 527 My heart is distressed When someone harms any sentient being. Therefore, never do harm and violence, And always strive to bring benefit and happiness. He also said: Incense, flowers, lamps, and the like Are not the best offerings to the Buddha. The best offering to the Buddha, Is to benefit all sentient beings. Therefore, to make an offering to the Buddha, Benefit all sentient beings. This offering will delight the Buddhas And make all sentient beings happy. There is no better way to please the Victorious Ones Than to gladden the hearts of sentient beings. If you ponder these verses of the Buddha, There is a very deep point to be understood: If we please the Buddha He will accept us with joy, And once he has accepted us, We will be continuously happy and fulfilled. There is no virtue greater than this: To gladden the hearts of Buddha and all beings [47la]. And a time will come when, without making great efforts, Our own accumulations will be complete, And we ourselves will become Buddhas. This instruction for bringing satisfaction to both oneself and others Is wonderful indeed!"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"528 Th Life of Shabkar May this Great Wondrous Aduice Benefit the minds of all who hear it. This was my advice. From time to time, I used to go to the Eight Great Places of the Accomplished Ones of Rekong, as well as to the places where J etsun Kalden Gyatso meditated and other secluded sites. I would stay in retreat in each of these places, in some for one month, in some half a month, in some seven days, establishing a con-nection with these holy sites, performing \"Call-ing for the Descent of Blessings,\" and reciting prayers and wishes for auspiciousness. I made a small retreat hut in every place where there had been none, and sang this song in praise of moun-tain solitudes: I pray to the eight siddJzas Who came in the past to the eight holy places Of the Golden Valley of Rekong: Bless me to be able to remain continuously in mountain retreats. E rna! The golden days of old are gone. K ye rna! The evil times have dawned. All the wise beings of the past have gone And a crowd of fools is hom. The silken knot-the divine Dharma-has been untied, And the binding of the sheaf--human ethics-has been cut. The golden yoke of the royal laws has been broken, And the ocean of the chiefs' counsel has dried up. The pattern has vanished from the skins of tiger-like heroes, And virtuous women have thrown away the mantle of modesty [47lb]. The noble traditions of the elite are not being maintained, And vulgar behavior is encouraged. Without thinking carefully about ultimate benefit People only make careful reckoning of immediate profit. Not holding onto excellent traditions, They set a plethora of bad examples. Not heeding the scriptural authority of the learned, They make a great fuss about the discourses of fools. Now, when people are not imitating the good But emulating the inferior, Is the time to follow the examples Of the perfect lives of past saints And give up all concerns of this life; Now is the time to devote oneself to the profound practice In places where the past siddhas dwelled. Ema! In the pleasant groves of wild mountain solitudes Where wise and accomplished beings Attained supreme realization, One is not distracted by the affairs of this life. As gods and goddesses play In the pleasant gardens oflndra's paradise, Birds and wild animals frolic insouciantly In thickets and meadows where medicinal herbs grow in abundance.

May all practitioners who hear this song Not stay in their homelands, But, relying on places of total solitude, Devote themselves to the essence of practice. Mter this, most of the monks and nuns, Bonpos, and ngakpas around went into retreat in these holy places, and devoted themselves to recitation and sadhana practice. In the villages, yearly gatherings were insti-tuted to recite the mani. Also, at home, everyone did a lot of spiritual practice with body, speech, and mind. Under these fortunate circumstances, the whole province was rendered sparkling white by the holy Dharma. For the benefit of all the men and women of Amdo I then sang a song called the Garland qf Vital Points qf Human Ethics: I entreat the blessing of the gracious gurus So that I may accomplish my aspirations In accordance with the Dharma.

Wherever you go, wherever you stay, Be in harmony with all, Amdo folk! Even if you have great attachment for your own things, Never covet another's possessions, Amdo folk! Even if you are skilled and wise, Ask everyone's opinion, Amdo folk! Even if you have built up a fortune by yourself, Don't show offin public, Amdo folk! [473a]. Even .if everyone holds you in high esteem, Don't become infatuated with your greatness, Amdo folk!

Even from afar, bow down and show marks of respect To others' teachers and chiefs, Amdo folk! When you encounter someone of equal status, Place him above yourself, Amdo folk! Whatever you do, have little craving; Know how to be content with what you have, And always keep a humble position, Amdo folk! In brief, be always respectful to your supenors, Kind to your inferiors, And in harmony with your equals, Amdo folk! Act thus in accordance with the Dharma: You will enjoy happiness and everyone's confidence, Amdo folk! From now on and throughout all my lives, May I myself be skilled in benefiting all beings. May all who read, hear, remember, or merely touch the written words of this song Realize their aims and those of others in this very life. May goodness prevail in all countries, may crops be abundant, May a great auspiciousness cover the whole earth. This song opened the minds of most of the reli-gious and laypeople gathered there. I went and stayed for a few days in each of the districts. When I took leave, all the patrons escorted me for a while, and when we were going to part I gave them my blessing, protec-tion80 and advice, put around their necks fare-well scarves, and sang for them, men and women, this song of helpful advice that starts with \"Upon my head, in a vast tent of rain-bows ... \" [473b].

I, his son, supplicate with fervor: May you tum to the Dharma the minds of all those present here; May all their perceptions alien to Dharma cease. By the power of our past prayers and karma, We, people of various origins, gathered here for a fleeting moment-Some coming from the realm ofU-Tsang, Some from the directions of Kham and Domey-And established perfect connections through Dharma, food and material things; Yet, before long we will disperse. Like this, everything is impermanent. There isn't a single being who will remain in this life, And when going to the land of the next life Nothing but the Dharma will help at all. You patrons, men and women, assembled here, Remember that death may come at any time, And without entertaining excessive attachment for the affairs of this life, Endeavor in the sublime Dharma to prepare for the paths and levels in the next life. Even if you can't practice the Dharma, beware of sin, And have good thoughts at all times. Wherever I myself may go, I'll always keep you within my spiritual protection For this life and the life thereafter. Now, farewell, men and women patrons; I, the yogin, will not stay, but go. Return to Dorney 531 May we meet again and again Before the end of this very life [ 4 7 4a]. Yet, since in this degenerate age life is uncertain, If, separated by great distances, we don't meet again, May we meet in the land of the next life. This is farewell advice given from my heart To all the devout patrons; May all men and women who hear this song Be joyful and happy at all times. May good omens and prosperity prevail in this land; May auspiciousness encompass the three realms! All those gathered there felt completely tired of samsara, and felt an urge to escape from it. Faith burst forth in their minds, and made tears well up in their eyes and all the hair on their body stand on end. Praying that we might meet many times again in this life and all our future lives, they did prostrations, respectfully walked round me, and departed for home. That year a new retreat place had been estab-lished at Amnyejadron. I went and stayed there for seven days. One day, remembering my kind root teacher Jetsunjamyang Gyatso Rinpoche, I went to see the stupa containing his relics and found it had collapsed into an earthen heap. Realizing the impermanent nature of all condi-tioned things, I became overwhelmed with sad-ness, and, remembering my precious lama with all my heart, I bowed down, touched the heap of earth with my head, and wept helplessly [ 4 7 4b]. Then I offered aganachakra, supplicated him many times, and made vast prayers. Prostrating myself and reverentially walking round the stupa many times, I stayed a long time. Before leaving, I touched my head again against the mound of earth and uttered this song of longing for the gracious guru:"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"532 The Life of Shabkar Kind lord, precious lama, Who bore the sweet-sounding name \"Ocean of Serene Melody,\" I, your son, supplicate you with great fervor; Look upon me from invisible space! Before, I met the body of the guru. His body did not remain, but left this world. Later, I met the relics of the guru; The stupa that contained them fell apart. At last, I meet a mere mound of earth. Now, as I go wandering on to distant lands, How shall I ever encounter even this earthen heap again? Thinking of this, again and again, I remember you, my supremely kind master. As soon as you come into my mind Tears stream down my face, beyond control. Today, I, your son who clings to permanence, Can see that all compounded things do not last; Impermanent, they are doomed to disintegrate, Just as I've seen here. In particular, this illusory body of mine, A compound of the four elements, Is doomed to dissolution, Just as I've seen here. For the swiftly vanishing remnant of this life, Like the sun setting swiftly over a mountain pass, Not indulging in the affairs of this life, I will practice Dharma for the sake of the next. Compassionate lord, master, In whichever of the infmity ofBuddhafields you now dwell [475a], Comfort the mind of your son on the brink of death. In whichever Buddhafield you are--take me there, And once reunited, may we two, father and son, Never part again. By your blessings, glorious lord guru, May the years in this land always be good. at As I sang this, the few disciples and patrons who were there felt strong disillusionment with this world, and were filled with awe and faith. On the way back I performed the consecra-tion of the retreat place and pronounced verses of auspiciousness. Then I came back to the secluded place ofTashikhyil, blessed by the feet of past saints. I entered into a year's retreat and, like the Great Compassionate One, \"Repose of the Mind,\" I remained in the state of luminous radiance, the true nature of mind. Soldiers from Rekong raided and destroyed the monastery of Upper Tashi Gephel. The abbot, Khen Rinpoche, a person who always fulfilled his guru's commands, together with all his dis-ciples rebuilt the monastery and erected a huge statue of Buddha Maitreya. For that purpose they spent a bundle of ten thousand gold leaves and seven bnndles of one thousand; twenty horses, rkos and dJis; thirty sheep; forty-five bags of tsampa; ten sheepskin bags of butter; and two large bundles of tea. Similarly, Alak Tendzin Nyima, Rabjung, and Nuchi rebuilt the monastery of Lower Gurong, which had been burnt down by Chi-nese soldiers [475b]. For that they spent two hundred and eighty lengths of cloth, about forty bags of tsampa, eight sheepskin bags of butter,"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"and over half a large bundle of tea. Many monks, led by the treasurer Drupchen and Tendzin, made one hundred thousand tsa-tsas and a line of stones, engraved with the mani, next to Tashikhyil Monastery where I was living. By doing so they were fortunate enough to purify their obscurations and accumulate merit. Eating only one meal a day, I remained evenly in the natural state. As post-meditation practice, I opened hundreds of different doors of concentration, practicing long-life sadhanas, de-velopment and completion stages, emanations and transformations, 82 and other practices. At one point I had the following thought: \"There is a saying that goes, 'When one reaches fifty, life is gone; when the cock sings, night is gone.' Now I am fifty-six, my hair has turned grey and my eyes red; all the signs announcing death have descended upon me. Now my body is still free of illness and my mind free of suffer-ing; my intelligence is still clear and my tongue agile; so ifl have anything to give to my disciples, anything to tell them, I must give it and tell it now.\" Accordingly, I sang a song-my advice while I was alive and my last will and testament for the time of my death: I bow down and make offerings, praises and prayers To the gurus who bestow the waves of blessing, To theyidam deities who grant accomplish-ments, To the dakinis who dispel obstacles [476a]: Always look with compassion Upon myself, my disciples and benefactors. Grant the blessings of your body, speech, and mind, And the supreme and ordinary siddhis! Having pondered the unpredictability of the time of death, I, the yogin Tsogdruk Rangdrol, Will, while I am still alive, Give to my disciples what they need. To the disciple whose vows and samayas are perfecdy pure, Return to Dorney 533 Who has few needs and is easily contented, Who has sharp intelligence and great diligence, I give a place where the past saints meditated. To the disciple who, like the Victorious Ones of the past, Has given up all the affairs of this life And is able to stay in solitude, I give the victory banner of the lineage of spiritual practice. To the disciple who, having practiced, tamed his mind, Cultivated loving-kindness, compassion, and Bodhicitta, And is able to benefit others, I give the golden wheel for expounding the teachings. To the disciple who from childhood has had faith, compassion, Great capacity for study, reflection, and meditation, As well as sharp intelligence, I give the treasury of the pith instructions of sutra and tantra. To the disciple who, having studied and reflected impartially in his youth, Acquired a pure perception of all the doctrinal views And is free of sectarianism, I give the jewels of the Madhyamika, Mahamudra, and Mahasandhi. To the miserable masterless disciple, Who has no predisposition for the Dharma, And does not possess the wealth of merit, I give the food and possessions that bring fleeting happiness.

You disciples who once had a strong faith in the Dharma, And after a few years developed strong faith in wealth, Busying yourselves with trade, exorcisms, and village ceremonies, Do not disgrace the Dharma. You disciples who once devoted yourselves to the practice of Dharma, And after a while began to hoard And keep accounts for every needle and thread, Do not trade away the lineage of spiritual practice. You disciples who once worked for the benefit of others, And after a few years began to work for yourselves And to be jealous of other practitioners, Don't make the teachings meaningless. You disciples who once devoted yourselves to study, reflection, and meditation, And, after some years turned into sectarians And disparaged others' traditions, Don't accumulate bad karma by throwing away the Dharma. You disciples who once kept pure monastic vows, And after a few years came to rely on women and liquor, Don't behave in an even less disciplined way Than ordinary laymen. You disciples who have been left behind, When after some days your mourning is over And you start to quarrel about food and money, Do not betray your teacher. Everyone must die, certainly; At the time of death, what's certain to benefit Is the sublime Dharma-nothing else. So, all of you, practice the supreme Dharma! While I am alive, this is my advice, When I die, this will be my testament. This is my ultimate admonition: Act according to it and all will go well. May this benefit the minds of all the faithful men and women who hear it; In the next life, may I lead all those With whom I have had a connection in this one, May crops and cattle prosper throughout the land [477a], May Dharma, auspiciousness, and all excellent qualities Increase like the waxing moon. This advice did some good to the minds of most of the disciples; later many of them gave up worldly affairs to wander in mountain soli-tudes. One day, having come to remain in the even, natural state of mind, I rested for a long time simply enjoying the taste of the samadhi of bliss, clarity, and absence of thoughts. At the end I thought, \"How nice if all my faithful disciples could just remain like this in the natural state of all things, without having to do intentional medi-tation,\" and I sang a song upon my meditation experience, the Guru and Triple Gem song: Guru and wish-fulfilling triple gem, Shower blessings and siddhis upon us like .

In this way, I had little difficulty in accumulating merit and purifying my obscurations, as a way to perfect easily the two accumulations. I persevered as much as I could in all Bodhisattva actions.

From childhood until now, touching my head to the dust of their feet, I have attended hundreds of spiritual teachers. From them I received time and again many vast and profound instructions uniting sutra and tantra. I have done spiritual practice in hundreds of mountain retreats, from the White Snows of Kailash in Upper Tibet, to The Heart of the Lake, Tsonying Mahadeva, in Lower Dokham. I have also been to hundreds of villages and mon-asteries, benefiting as much as possible the teach-ings and all beings. From the ages of twenty-one to forty I kept unbroken the precept of not eating after noon. I did the fasting practice more than three hundred times. I recited one million times the hundred-syllable mantra 1 and the mani ten million times, as well as many other mantras and prayers. From the ages of twenty to thirty I mainly practiced to perfect myself, and from the ages of thirty to fifty I worked mainly for the good of others. I spent altogether nine years in the Three Provinces of Ngari 2 in western Tibet, in the Four Districts ofU-Tsan~ in central Tibet, and in the Three Heights of Dokham 4 in eastern Tibet, tirelessly working for beings. I always kept purely the three vows [480b]. Giving up meat, garlic, onions, and tobacco, I lived on the three whites5 and the three sweets, and on tea, butter, and tsampa. Wherever I went 541 in Upper, Middle, and Lower Tibet, I told every-one there, men and women: \"There is no certainty as to when we will die. It may well happen tonight, tomorrow, or the day after. You must consider carefully the law of karma, cause and effect. If, as someone who has committed many negative deeds, you haven't taken this law into account and die sud-denly, you will be reborn in the hell realm, while those who have practiced virtue will be reborn in the higher realms; therefore you must beware of negative actions and exert yourself in virtuous ones. \"Above all, you must constantly train your mind to be loving, compassionate, and filled with Bodhicitta. You must give up eating meat, for it is very wrong to eat the flesh of our parent sentient beings. If you are unable to give up eating meat, only take meat under the three permissive conditions, 6 and by no means should you accept meat of an animal that has been killed for you. \"Keeping pure vows and saml!Jas, you should study, reflect and meditate in a proper way upon the vast and profound teachings of both sutra and tantra.

I had over three hundred disciples who were practitioners who trained in the Bodhicitta prac-tice of cherishing others more than themselves, were filled with compassion, and never ate meat [48la]. I had one thousand eight hundred disciples-monks, nuns, and hermits-who, coming from all directions and all lands, lived in the moun-tains, kept pure vows and samayos, and gave up all concern for the affairs of this life. Finally, I had countless disciples who were monks and nuns dwelling in monasteries, dis-ciples who worked hard at making offerings, prostrations, circumambulations, prayers and recitations; village ngakpos who practiced recita-tion and meditation upon the yidam deities; and laymen and laywomen who took temporary vows and vows of fasting, and recited the mani. I was fortunate enough to be able to ransom the lives and set free tens and hundreds of thou-sands of goats, sheep, yaks, birds, and other wild animals, and to save over five hundred people who were on the verge of death-beggars, pil-grims, people coming from afar, people who had long been sick, condemned prisoners, and people who had been trying to kill each other in feuds. Having returned to Dorney, using spiritual and worldly skillful means, along with wealth, I settled eighteen great feuds, in which many people had been killed, thus putting a halt to the line of those waiting to enter the hells. In brief, directly and indirectly I was able to bring vast benefit to the Dharma and sentient beings. Wherever I worked for others, I would men-tally call for the descent of auspiciousness on all the places I saw; call for a rain of blessings over all the mountain retreats I saw; consecrate all the sacred objects I saw; give empowerment to all the people I saw, and pray for all those who had died [48lb]. I felt loving-kindness when seeing someone bereft of happiness, compassion when seeing someone suffering, joy when seeing someone happy and free of suffering, and evenness when seeing someone free of attachment and hatred. While traveling I would continually repeat: May all beings have happiness and the causes ofhappiness; May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering, May all beings never be parted from the happiness free from suffering, May all beings remain in the evenness free from attachment and aversion. To conclude every action done in accor-dance with the Dharma, I would say prayers dedicating all merit, so that the precious teach-ings of the Buddha-the source of all temporal benefit and ultimate happiness-would spread vastly, and that in this way the sun of happiness and fulfillment would shine on sentient beings. I prayed that, by the power of my dedication, in all lands and particularly in the places I was visiting, the rain would be timely, crops good, and cattle prosperous, that diseases of men and beasts cease, that life span and merit would increase, that everyone might enjoy happiness and comfort in this life and the next, and that, ultimately, meeting in a Buddhafield we would all have the good fortune to attain Buddhahood together.

Alternately, these three have been defmed as I) Guge Ya'i Kor (gugeg:Ja'yi skor), the Slate Land of Guge; 2) Purang Khang gi Kor (spu hreng gangs lgi skory, the Snow Land of Purang; 3) Ruthop Chap gi Kor (ru tlzob chab lgi skor), the Water Land ofRuthop. According to AC, val. I, p. 3, the three divisions are: 1) Purang, Mang Yul, and Zanskar (spu hreng, mangyul, zangs dkar), making the first division; 2) Li, Gilgit, and Balti (li, bru sha, sbal h), making the second division; and 3) Shang Shung, Triteh and Lower To (zhang zhung, khri te I bri ste, stod srruuf), making the third division. To (stod) and Lata (la stod) are sometimes con-fused. To refers traditionally to the western part of Tibet at large, as opposed to U-Tsang (dbu gtsang) and Dorney (mdo smad}, and is the same as Ngari. Lata is the western part ofT sang and includes the districts of Nyanang (gnya' nang), Tingri (ding ri}, Pungrong (sp1111g rong), and Shelkar (shel dkar). People from Lata call themselves Tapas (stod pa), \"the people ofT a,\" which adds to the confusion, but they are not considered as such by inhabitants of Ngari. One also distinguishes North Lata (byang la stod) and South Lata (Uw la stod; see TC, p. 2745), which were two of the thirteen divisions ofTibet (bod klzri skor gcu sum). 3. The Four Districts ofU-Tsang (bar dbus gtsang ru bz;hr): According to AC, val. 1, p. 4. and CN, p. 97, initially, during the reign of Songtsen Gampo the Four Regions in U and Tsang were described as follows: In U (dbus): 1) Uru (dbu ru) all the regions on the left banks of the Kyichu River, and of the Tsangpo River, after Chaksam, where the Kyichu and Tsangpo meet; 2) Y oru (g:Jo ru), the regions on the right banks of these two rivers. In Tsang (gtsang): 3) Yeru (g:Jas ru), the Right Region (on the right bank of the Tsangpo which flows from Mt. Kailash) and 4) Ru lag (ru lag) on the left bank of the Tsangpo. More recently, they have been described as in U: 1) Puru (spus ru) and 2) Gungru (gung ru); in Tsang: 3) Yeru (g:Jas ru) and 4) Yonru (g:Jon ru). 4.

He highlights the significance and value of human life, the meaning of impermanence and the imminence of death, the ineluctible laws of karma, the unsatisfactory condition of samsara, and the necessity of developing a determination to renounce worldly affairs and accomplish spiri-tual goals. He explains the benefits of relying upon an authentic master, the need to cultivate compas-sion, devotion, and pure vision, and, fmally, the unsurpassable view of the infinite purity of all phenomena, which allows the actualization of one's innate Buddha-nature. Not only does Shabkar explain all this, but he does so in a way which makes one feel that with the right amount of personal effort and confidence in the teach-ings, one could follow in his \"white footsteps.\" These teachings, however, do not appear in the autobiography in the same order as they would in a traditional graded exposition of the path. For the sake of clarity, we will therefore present an overview of their general structure. Some elements of Buddhist philosophy and practice purportedly reached remote Tibet as early as the fifth century (see Translator's Intro-duction). However, the major advent of Bud-dhism occurred in the eighth century, when King Trisong Detsen (b. 730 or 742) invited the Indian abbot Shantarakshita to Tibet, and, soon after-wards, the incomparable tantric master Padmasam-547 bhava. Under the latter's guidance, over a hun-dred great Indian panditas and an equivalent number of Tibetan translators translated into Tibetan most of the Buddhist Canon. This period is known as the Early Transla-tion, Ngagyur (snga gyur). The upholders of the vast and rich spiritual tradition which flourished in its wake are known as the Ancient Ones, or Nyingma (mying rna). Although the monastic tra-dition was nearly eradicated during the persecu-tion waged by King Langdarma, the Nyingma tradition survived through lineages of highly re-alized lay yogins (see NS, p. 523). In the late tenth century, a second wave of ·translation occurred, spearheaded by the great translator Rinchen Zangpo (95 7-1 055). The various lineages that sprang from it belong to the New Translation period (gsar ma). These include the traditions of the Kadam (and its later development, the Geluk), Sakya, Kagyu, Shangpa Kagyu, Chad and Shije, Kalachakra, and Orgyen Nyendrub.1 These traditions, old and new, are often called the Eight Chariots of Spiritual Accomplishment (sgrub brgyud shing rta. brgyad). The main instructions of these eight schools were collected by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye (1813-99) in the Treasury of Sp£ritual ln-structi.ons (DZ). Firmly grounded in the Mind Training (blo sbyong) of the Kadam-Geluk tradition with its emphasis on renunciation and compassion, Shabkar's main practices were those of the Nyingma lineage, particularly the terma tradition"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"548 The life of Shabkar of revealed spiritual treasures stemming from Padmasambhava. Guru Padmasambhava's lineage maintains a complete tradition of both sutra and mantra, arranged into nine vehicles that incorporate all aspects ofBuddhist theory and practice. Although all teachings and paths have but one goal, there are as many paths and vehicles to reach Buddha-hood as there are different natures and capaci-ties in sentient beings. This is why the Buddha and all the accomplished masters following him taught a variety of methods to suit varying needs. The !Ankavatara Sutra says:2 As long as there are deluded minds, There will be no limit to the number of vehicles. Once delusion comes to an end, There will be neither vehicles nor sentient beings. The Nyingma tradition distinguishes nine main vehicles for realization, or yanas. They do not represent separate, altogether different, approaches: each of them is a step toward the next, which naturally includes the preceding ones. Just as all rivers merge into one ocean, as all paths lead to a single summit, so all vehicles ultimately fuse into one as they culminate in Buddhahood, the Radiant Vajra Essence ('odgsal rdo rje snying po) of the Great Perfection (rdzogs chen). The following summary of the view, medi-tation, action, and result of these nine vehicles is based on Shechen Gyaltsap Perna Namgyal's Concise Meaning oftheNme Vehicles, 3 and on Khenpo Yon ten Gyatso's commentary onjigme Lingpa's Treasury of Spiritual Qyalities. 4 A yana is defined as a \"vehicle or support that allows one to reach the path's fmal destina-tion.\" It is a means of spiritual development. Before summarizing the main features of each of the nine vehicles, one must first establish the distinction between worldly or mundane vehicles, which cannot take one beyond samsara, and supramundane vehicles, which can lead one first to freedom from samsara and, ultimately, to enlightenment. WORLDLY VEHICLES There are two kinds of worldy or mundane ve-hicles, which, according to their result, are con-sidered to be unmistaken or mistaken. The first is the \"vehicle followed by human and celestial beings\" (lho. mi'i theg pa), which allows rebirth in the highest forms of existence within samsara but cannot deliver one from samsara altogether. We will consider here briefly its view, meditation, action, and fruit. Vzew: Here, the practitioner acknowledges the suffering of the lower realms of samsara, and recognizes the laws of karma, of cause and effect (that negative acts will inevitably bring suffering and positive acts happiness), and the existence of past and future rebirths. In this respect his understanding is considered to be correct. His aim, however, is limited to avoiding rebirth in the lower realms and gaining rebirth as a human being or as one of the three kinds of celestial beings.5 Mediiation: Striving to reach his goal, he prac-tices the four contemplations (bsam gtan) and merges with the four formless states. Action: To achieve this he avoids the ten non-virtuous actions (killing, stealing, and sexual mis-conduct; telling lies, slandering, gossiping, and saying harsh words; envy, ill will, and erroneous views) and actively practices their opposites, the ten virtuous acts, while cultivating loving-kind-ness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and even-ness-the four boundless thoughts. Fruii: According to the strength of his medi-tation and the extent of his virtuous deeds, the practitioner will take rebirth in any of the higher realms of samsara, from the human realm up to the realm of formless gods. Among the followers of the second kind of worldly vehicles, the mistaken ones, there are some who thoroughly lack understanding and ignore the karmic laws of cause and effect, as well as some with wrong understanding, such as nihilists who assume that there are no past and future lives and are principally concerned with seeking power and pleasure in this present life. Others, the etemalists for instance, assume that there is a permanent, independent, all-powerful"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"creator, himself without cause, who decides the fate of beings and who produces impermanent phenomena despite being permanent himsel£ In short, the followers of these vehicles lack the views and means effective for achieving liberation. TilE NINE VEHICLES FOR REAll,ZA TION In the supramundane vehicles, one takes the support of the Three Jewels-the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha-and one trains in ethical discipline, concentrated meditation, and penetrating insight, which can deliver one from the bonds of samsara. These nine vehicles comprise the three ve-hicles of the sutras-those of the shravakas, the pratyekabuddhas and the Bodhisattvas-and the six vehicles of the Kriya, Upa, Yoga, Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga tantras. They can also be grouped into three vehicles, Hinayana, which includes the first two, Mahayana the third, and Vajrayana the last six. TI!EHINArANA The Hinayana path is based on renunciation. Its practice is motivated by the wish to liberate oneself alone. When considered on its own, it may be called \"lesser vehicle\"; when integrated into the whole path of the three vehicles, it is regarded as the \"fundamental vehicle.\" THE SHRA V AKAS A shravaka ('!Yan tlws, literally, a \"listener\") is someone who fears the sufferings of samsara. Concerned with his own liberation, he listens to the teachings of the Buddha, realizes the suffer-ing inherent in all conditioned phenomena, and meditates upon the Four Noble Truths--suffer-ing, the cause of suffering (the obscuring emo-tions), the extinction of suffering, and the path to attain this extinction. Vzew: A shravaka understands that there is no truly existent \"self\" inherent in an individual, but maintains that phenomena have a real basis Appendix 1 549 in indivisible particles and moments of conscious-ness, which are held to be truly existent. Such views define the V aibhasika school (f(;e brag smra ba). Meditation: On the basis offlawless ethics and self-discipline, lay or monastic, the practitioner listens to the teachings, ponders their meaning, and assimilates this meaning through medita-tion. Applying antidotes, such as considering the unpleasant aspects of objects of desire, he con-quers the conflicting emotions (kleshas), and at-tains inner calm (samatha). By cultivating insight (vipa.ryana), he comes to understand that an indi-vidual possesses no truly existent, independent \"sel£\" Action: He practices the twelve ascetic virtues6 and acts chiefly to achieve personal hberation. Fruit: Beginning with the stage of \"stream-enterer\" and continuing with the stages of \"once-returner\" who will be reborn only one more time, and of \"non-returner\" who will no longer be reborn into samsara, he liberates himself and eventually becomes an arhat, \"one who has de-stroyed his adversary\" (dgra beam pa), referring to the vanquishing of the obscuring emotions. THE PRATYEKABUDDHAS A pratyekabuddha (rang sangs rgyas, \"who became Buddha by himself') can attain the level of an arhat without relying upon a teacher in this lifetime (although he has met teachers in former lifetimes). He meditates on dependent origina-tion (rten 'breQ, the natural process through which everything arises and appears. Phenomena come into existence through the combination of causes and conditions. No phenomenon appears with-out a cause, none are made by an uncaused creator. Acquainting himself with the fact of death, he becomes weary of the condition of samsara and, pondering the causes of suffering and death, he investigates the twelve links of dependent origination to find that the misery of samsara originates in ignorance. Vuw: He realizes that individuals and indi-visible particles of matter are devoid of true exist-ence, yet he still clings to moments of con-sciousness as constituting real entities. Thus he"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"550 The Life oJShabkar realizes fully the selflessness of the individual and partly the selflessness of phenomena. This view characterizes the Sautrantika school (mdo sde pa).

Birth is the result of the drive toward existence ( 1 0), which arises from grasping (9), which rises from crav-ing (8), which arises from feeling (7), which arises from contact (6), which arises from the six senses (5), which arise from name and form (4), which arise from consciousness (3), which arises from karmic dispositions (2), which arise from igno-rance (1 ). Following the chain in its direct order from ignorance to death, the pratyekabuddha understands that ignorance, the clinging to phe-nomena as real, is the source of all suffering in samsara. Fruit and Action: Practicing for his own, lim-ited deliverance, the pratyekabuddha does not teach others verbally, but inspires faith in them through the display of miracles, such as flying through the sky and transforming the upper half ofhis body into ftre and the lower half into water, etc. Eventually he becomes an arhat. Since shravakas and pratyekabuddhas practice prima-rily for their own sakes, they cannot attain com-plete Buddhahood and benefit innumerable sentient beings, as does a Bodhisattva. WE MAHAYANA The Mahayana practitioner is motivated by the altruistic intention to liberate others from suffer-ing and bring them to Buddhahood. The Mahayana, or Great Vehicle, surpasses the Hina-yana in many essential aspects. A Bodhisattva recognizes the lack of true existence both of the individual and of all phenomena. Vowing to attain enlightenment for the sake of others, he develops limitless compassion for all suffering beings, yet his compassion is united with wis-dom, the perfect realization of emptiness. Having examined phenomena and recog-nized their empty nature, the Bodhisattva regards everything as being like a dream or an illusion. However, his understanding of absolute truth does not lead him to ignore relative truth: with loving-kindness and compassion, he keeps his actions in perfect accord with the karmic law of cause and effect and works tirelessly to benefit beings. Realizing the ultimate nature, which is free from clinging and from all limiting condi-tions, he rests in the great evenness, the nondual absolute truth. Vzew: The view involves correct understand-ing of the lack of reality of both the individual and all phenomena. Various levels of under-standing this view, and of defming the absolute and the relative truth, are found in the Mahayana schools of Cittamatra and Madhyamaka. The Cittamatrin (sems tsam pa) says that all phenomena are the products of mind, and there-fore unreal, but postulates that, in terms of abso-lute truth, self-cognizant, nondual awareness truly exists. The Madhyamaka (dbu ma) has two main schools, Svatantrika (rang rgyud pa) and Prasangika (thai gyur pa). The ftrst one considers that, in terms of absolute truth, phenomena have no true existence whatsoever; but in terms of rela-tive truth, phenomena appear through the com-bination of causes and conditions, perform their function, and have a verifiable conventional ex-istence. The second school asserts that, from both an absolute and a relative point of view, phe-nomena are totally devoid of existence and can-not be characterized by any concept such as \"existent,\" \"nonexistent,\" \"both existent and nonexistent,\" or \"neither existent nor nonexist-ent.\" For the Prasangikas, absolute truth is the nondual pristine wisdom of the Buddhas, free from conceptual elaboration. Meditation: On the four \"paths of learning\" one practices the thirty-seven branches of en-lightenment. Having recognized that the poten-tial for achieving Buddhahood, the Tatha gatagarbha, is present within oneself, one aspires to reach enlightenment. Through inner-calm meditation (shamatha) one pacifies all clinging to"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"outer perceptions and develops a serene samadhi. Through insight meditation (uipasyana) one as-certains that all out~r phenomena are unreal, like illusions, and that all inner clingings and dualistic notions of subject-object are void. Ac-cording to the Great Middle Way, resting free of taking things as real in the evenness of the abso-lute nature--in which there nothing to subtract and nothing to add-one unites inner-calm medi-tation and insight. Action: In post-meditation, one benefits be-ings, considering others as dearer than onesel£ For this, one practices the six paramitas-gener-osity, morality, patience, effort, meditation, and insight-to which one adds skillful means, strength, prayer, and pristine wisdom, thus de-fining ten paramitas altogether. When these all become permeated with wisdom, the other paramitas are transformed from ordinary virtues into transcendent activities. Fruit: Eventually, when a Bodhisattva attains the path of\"no more learning'' and the eleventh spiritual level, or bhumi, he becomes a fully en-lightened Buddha. Having fulfilled his own aspi-rations by realizing the dharmakaya (the absolute body), for the sake of others he manifests the rupakaya (the body of form which includes the sambhogakaya and the nirmanakaya) and per-forms his compassionate activity for sentient be-ings until the end of samsara. 7HE VAJRAYANA The Vajrayana path is based on pure perception and is motivated by the aspiration to free swiftly oneself and others from delusion through skillful means. The Mahayana chiefly considers that the Buddha nature is present in every sentient being like a seed, or potentiality. The Vajrayana con-siders that this nature is fully present as wisdom or pristine awareness, the undeluded aspect and fundamental nature of the mind. Therefore, while the former vehicles are known as \"causal vehicles,\" the Vajrayana is known as the \"result-ant vehicle.\" As it is said, \"In the causal vehicles one recognizes the nature of mind as the cause of Buddhahood; in the resultant vehicle one Appendix 1 551 regards the nature of mind as Buddhahood itself.\" Since the \"result\" of the path, Buddha-hood, is primordially present, one only needs to actualize it or divest it of its veils. The Vajrayana is also said to be unobscured, to provide many skillful means, to be without difficulty, and to be intended for beings of highest faculties. The various levels of the Madhyamaka phi-losophy consider relative truth as either false, impure, and rejectable, or as simply nonexistent. Here, the Vajrayana is able to make use of rela-tive truth as a path by seeing phenomena as the unlimited display of primordial purity. The six classes of Vajrayana tantras teach this in an increasingly direct and profound way. The gateway to the Vajrayana is the em-powerment, or abhisheko., which is given by the spiritual master. It empowers one to practice the Vajrayana teachings and thus to achieve ordi-nary and supreme spiritual attainments, or siddhis. The tantras and their related vehicles are categorized into three outer and three inner tantras, according to the level of their view, medi-tation, action, and fruit. 7HE THREE OUTER TANTRAS Kruv A. Although one has gained some un-derstanding of absolute truth, in relative truth one still seeks accomplishment as something to be gained from outside. Kriyatantra (bya rgyud, the tantra of activity), emphasizes ritual cleanli-ness: cleanness of the mandala and the sacred substances, and physical cleanliness of the practi-tioner, who practices ablutions and changes clothes three times a day, and eats the three white and the three sweet foods. 7 Vzew: The view is based on the two truths. Absolute truth is the wisdom of mind's ultimate nature, which is pure, luminous and void. It is free of four limiting concepts: existence and non-existence, appearance and emptiness. Relative truth can be viewed in two ways: according to the Madhyamaka, it is completely fictitious while, according to the view of the tantras, it is perfect, since phenomena are perceived as constituting the mandala of enlightened deities."},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"552 TIT£ Life of Shabkar Meditation: The deity that is the object of one's meditation is considered as a lord whom the practitioner, usually visualizing himself in his ordinary form, supplicates to be granted siddhi in the same way as a servant or a subject would suppli-cate a master. Contemplating absolute truth, with-out any specific object of focus, is also practiced. Action: Action focuses on cleanliness, concen-tration, fasting, and mantra recitation. Fruit: Realization of the Three Kayas and Five Wisdoms of perfect Buddhahood is attained in seven human lifetimes. UPA. It is called Upatantra (spyod rgyud), \"practice tantra,\" or Ubhayatantra (gnyis ka'i rgyud), \"dual-tantra,\" because it practices the view of the next vehicle, Y ogatantra, along with the action, or conduct, of the former, Kriyatantra. The ahhisheko. consists of the empowerment of the Five Buddha Families. Realization can be gained in five lifetimes. YOGA. This yana is the Yogatantra (mal 'byor rgyud)y or \"tantra of union with the nature.\" It is thus called because it emphasizes inner practice more than outer conduct. The ahhisheka adds to that of Up a the blessing of the vajra master. Vuw: In absolute truth one realizes the non-conceptual ultimate nature and its expression, luminosity. As result of this realization, within the \"perfect\" relative truth, phenomena appear as the \"mandala of adamantine space\" ( vajradhat:u mandala). Meditation: In formal meditation one visual-izes oneself as a deity and invites from the Buddhafield a wisdom deity similar to oneself, which usually remains in the space before one. The relationship between the deity and the prac-titioner is that of equals or friends. In objecdess meditation, one merges one's perception of phe-nomena with the absolute nature beyond char-acteristics and one rests in evenness: phenomena are thus seen as the play of wisdom manifesting as deities. Action: One still strives toward accomplish-ment through achieving the \"good\" and eschew-ing the \"bad\"; one gives chief importance to the yoga of the deity and one strives to benefit others. Fruit: Realization is attained in three life-times. TilE THREE INNER TA.NTRAS The view is to see all phenomena as being pri-mordially perfect; one thus realizes the \"great purity\" and the \"great evenness.\" Deities are visualized in union, symbolizing the indivisibility of emptiness and compassion, wisdom and means. The wisdom nature of the deity is considered to be inseparable from one's own nature; Action transcends accepting and rejecting. The fiuit is Buddhahood in one lifetime. There are three inner tantras: Mahayoga is like the ground, or basis; all phenomena are recognized as the magical display of mind-as-such, the union of emptiness and appearances. Anuyoga is like the path; it allows one to realize that phenomena are the nondual manifestation of space and primordial wisdom. Atiyoga is like the fruit and allows one to realize the natural presence of primordial wisdom, beyond begin-ning and ending. MAHA. Mahayoga is called the \"great yoga\" (mal 'hyor chen po) because it brings realization of non-duality. Its gateway consists of four main empowerments: the vase, the secret, the wisdom, and the symbolic (or word) empowerment. These purify the defilements of the body, speech and mind, as well as their subde obscurations, and enable one to realize the Four Kayas. Vuw: Awareness, free from all conceptual limitations, is here considered as absolute truth and is inherently endowed with all enlightened qualities. All phenomena-the outer universe, the various psychophysical elements of the body, as well as thoughts-arise as a mandala which stands for relative truth. The two truths, emptiness and phenomena, are inseparable, like gold and its color. Meditalion: Mahayoga emphasizes the devel-opment stage (bsf<:yed rim), which focuses on the process of visualization. One sees oneself as a deity-the manifestation of one's own wisdom nature. The outer world is seen as a Buddhafield and the beings therein as male and female deities."},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"These methods help one to recognize the pri-mordial, unchanging purity of phenomena, which is the true condition of things. One also practices the completion stage (rtkogs rim) related to the channels (na.dz), energy (prana) and essence (hindu). Formless meditation is merging one's mind with the profound, absolute nature. Action: In the path of action, through the confidence born from skillful means, such as devotion and pure perception, without rejection or attachment one uses sarnsaric experiences as catalysts to foster one's practice. Fruit: Realization is attained within this life-time, or in the ensuing barrio, the transitional state between death and rebirth. A.Nu. Anuyoga emphasizes the completion stage (rtkogs rim) and the mandala as being con-tained within one's own vajra-body. Having re-alized the non-duality of the expanse of emptiness and of pristine wisdom, through \"union\" and \"liberation\" (slryor grolj, one attains accomplish-ment. Anuyoga is called the \"ensuing yoga\" (rjes su mal 'lryor) because it focuses on the path of wisdom-desire which follows the experience of bliss. Its gateway, the empowerment, comprises thirty-six sections. Vzew: All phenomena are understood as the play of one's own mind. The uncreated aspect of mind, transcending all conditions, is the called the \"immaculate expanse of the mother Sa-mantabhadri,\" the mandala of the primordial nature. Its all-pervading and unobstructed manifestation, which is mind's self-display, is the \"wisdom father Samantabhadra,\" the natu-rally present mandala. These two aspects have the same nature: this is called the \"child of great bliss,\" in which the absolute expanse and of pristine wisdom are united, representing the indivisible nature of all mandalas. Meditation: One practices the path of skillful means (thabs lam), which focuses on the channels, energies, and vital essences of one's vajra-body. Practicing the yogas of the \"upper door\" and the \"lower door,\" one swiftly realizes one's inherent wisdom. One also practices the Path of Libera-tion (grollam) without elaboration. Having merged with the depth of nonconceptual simplicity, with-Appendix 1 553 out intentional meditation, one lets everything remain in the absolute nature, just as it is. In formal, elaborate practice, through uttering a mantra once, the mandala with its deities arises with perfect clarity, instantly, like a fish leaping out of water. Action: This primarily involves resting in even-ness. One also speaks of three actions: the \"sky-like action,\" which comes through realizing the nonduality of the absolute expanse of emptiness (dbyings) and pristine wisdom (ye shes); the \"king-like action,\" also called the \"action resembling wood burning in a bonfire,\" which comes through mastering the five poisons as five wisdoms; and the \"uninterrupted river-like action,\" which comes through realizing the sameness of samsara and nirvana. Fruit: Within one lifetime, one actualizes the Body of Great Bliss, which embodies the Four Kayas. An. The extraordinary feature of Atiyoga is that one maintains lucid recognition of the ultimate nature of mind: pure, vividly clear, per-fect in itsel£ It is luminosity which is naturally present, self-existing primordial wisdom, with-out any alteration or fabrication, beyond taking or rejecting, hope and fear. This is the \"ultimate yoga\" (shin tu mal 'lryor), far surpassing all the lower vehicles (all of which entail striving, fabri-cation, and effort). Atiyoga is also known as Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, meaning that all phenomena are naturally perfect in their pri-mordial purity. Its gateway is the empowerment of the \"efflorescence of awareness.\"8 According to the Secret Heart Essence (gsang ba snying thig), one receives four empowerments: elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, and utterly unelaborate. Vzew: All phenomena, within both samsara and nirvana, are perfect in primordial Buddha-hood, the great sphere of dharmakaya, the self-existing pristine wisdom beyond search and effort. Atiyoga has three classes: According to the mind class (sems sde), all perceived phenomena are none other than the play of mind-as-such (sems r#J, the inexpress-ible, self-existing wisdom."},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"554 The Life of Shabkar According to the space class (klong sde), the self-existing wisdom and all the phenomena sprung from its continuum never stray from the expanse of Samantabhadri: they have always been pure and liberated. According to the most extraordinary of the three, the class of pith instructions (man ngag sde), in the true nature of samsara and nirvana there are no obscurations to be rid of and no enlight-enment to be acquired. To realize this allows an instant arising of the self-existing wisdom beyond intellect. The first class is meant for individuals who are concerned with the workings of mind, the second for individuals whose minds are like the sky, and the third for individuals who transcend all effort. Meditation: In the mind class, having rec-ognized that all phenomena are the indescrib-able dharmakaya, the self-existing wisdom, one rests in the continuum of the awareness-void in which there is nothing to illuminate, nothing to reject, and nothing to add. The enlightened mind is like infinite space, its potential for manifesta-tion is like a mirror, and the limitless illusory phenomena are like multifarious reflections in the mirror. Since everything arises as the play of the enlightened mind, one does not need to obstruct the arising of thoughts; one simply remains in the natural condition of mind-as-such. In the space class, having recognized that all phenomena never leave the expanse ofSamanta-bhadri and are primordially pure and free, one abides in the continuum of the ultimate nature (clws rryid), without targets, effort, or search. There is no need to use antidotes: being void, thoughts and perceptions vanish by themselves. Phenom-ena are like stars naturally arrayed as ornaments in the firmament of the absolute nature: one needs not consider, as one does in the mind class, that they arise as the play of awareness. Every-thing is the infinite expanse of primordial libera-tion. In the class of pith instructions, having rec-ognized that mind-as-such is primordially pure emptiness, one practices Trekcho, leaving mind and all phenomena in their natural state of pris-tine liberation. Then, having discovered the natu-rally present mandala of one's body, one prac-tices Thogal and sees the very face of the naturally present luminosity, the pristine wisdom which dwells within onesel£ Without leaning either toward the \"clarity'' aspect of the mind class or toward the \"void\" aspect of the space class, without considering either the self-liberation of thoughts (as in the mind class), or the way of letting them be in emptiness (as in the space class), one simply rests in the confident realization of primordial purity, which is inex-pressible, beyond intellect, and of which phe-nomena are the natural radiance. Trekcho, \"cutting through hardness [or con-creteness],\" refers to breaking through the solid-ity of mental clinging, and Thogal, \"direct leap,\" refers to going directly to the highest point of realization. These two are related respectively to primordial purity (ka dag) and to spontaneous presence (!hun grub). These extraordinary prac-tices are found only in the teachings of the Great Perfection. It is said that the first eight vehicles use mind (sems) as the path, and that only the ninth uses awareness (rigpa) as the path. Action: Since everything that arises is the play of the absolute nature, one acts within the con-tinuum of nondual evenness, without taking and rejecting, free from clinging and fixation. Fruit: One dwells right now on the level of the Ever-perfect, Samantabhadra. Having mas-tered outer phenomena, they are realized as infmite Buddhafields; having mastered the inner aggregates of one's illusory body, this body can tum into radiant light; having mastered the in-nermost expanse of awareness, one puts an end to delusion. One has neither hope of attaining Buddhahood, nor fear of falling into samsara. As it is said: The fruit of the Great Perfection Is primordially present as the Buddha nature. It does not need to be obtained: It is ripe within onesel£ As said above, the nine vehicles do not represent separate paths. Each of them is a step toward the"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"next; all vehicles ultimately culminate in the Great Perfection. WEWREEVOWS The practice of these nine vehicles involves vows, precepts, and commitments. There are many divisions to these, but, in essence, they fall under three sets of vows (sdomgsum). The pratimoksha vows of the Hinayana con-cern all the lay and monastic precepts of ethical conduct taught by Lord Buddha in the Vinaya. Discipline and the keeping the vows protect the mind from conditions that generate negativity and emotional entanglements. The Bodhisattva vows of the Mahayana are embodied in the generation, cultivation, and pres-ervation of Bodhicitta, 9 the vow to dedicate all one's thoughts, words and actions toward the benefit of others and to lead all beings to com-plete enlightenment. The samayas are the precepts and commit-ments of the Vajrayana, which formalize the all-important bonds with one's guru, fellow disciples, and spiritual practice. There are many levels of samayas according to the outer and inner tantras. KARMA, TERMA, AND DANANG The Nyingma tradition has been blessed by countless enlightened masters and is very rich in spiritual lineages. Its three main streams of trans-mission are the long canonical lineage, kahma (ring br~ud bka' rna), the short lineage of spiritual treasures, terma (T!Jie br~ud gter rna), and the pro-found pure visions, dagnang (zab mo dag snang). The first is the ''long'' lineage of the canonical scriptures, which have been transmitted without interruption from master to disciple, from the pri-mordial Buddha, Samantahhadra, through Guru Padmasambhava and other great Awareness Holders. The second is the \"short,\" or direct, lineage of the revealed treasures concealed by Guru Pad-masambhava for the sake of future generations, and represents the quintessence of the kahrna. When the Lotus-born Guru, Padmasambhava, bestowed the ripening empowerments and liber-Appendix I 555 ating instructions upon the Tibetan king Trisong Detsen, the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal and the other twenty-five main disciples, he entrusted many teachings to each of them and miraculously con-cealed these as spiritual treasures in various places-temples, images, sky, rocks, and lakes. Then, he prophesied that, in the future, these disciples would reincarnate, reveal these teach-ings from their place of concealment, and spread them for the sake ofbeings. Such reincarnate lamas are called \"treasure masters,\" or tert:Ons (gter ston). In due time, a terton experiences visions or signs indicating how and where to discover his or her destined Ierma. In the case of\"mind-treasure\" (dgpngs gtei), the teachings are not physically unearthed but arise in the terton's mind by the blessing of Guru Rinpoche. Many such masters have appeared throughout the centuries, . down to the present day. In the third stream of transmission, the pure visions, Guru Padmasambhava appears in real-ity to the terton and speaks to him in person. Although this brief introduction to the Bud-dhist path structured into nine vehicles reflects the approach of the Nyingma tradition, it is by no means contradictory to that of other schools of Tibetan Buddhism. In several of his writings, Shabkar quotes Panchen Lobzang Y eshe, who said: The various doctrinal views found in the provinces ofU, Tsang, and Ngari Are all the very teachings of the Victorious One. How fme if, not allowing the demon of sectarianism to ignite animosity, The radiance of the jewel of pure perception would encompass all. Notes 1.

How-ever, following his nonsectarian approach, Shabkar received teachings from many other masters as well, wherever his wandering through mountain wildernesses and holy places took him. In Urgeh, for instance, he received the trans-mission for the lineage of Chod (see chap. 3, fol. 38b). In Tsari, he received many teachings ac-cording to the Kagyu tradition (see chap. 1 0), and in central Tibet he forged close connections with the ninth and tenth Dalai Lamas, and the seventh Panchen Lama (see chaps. 9 and 14). At Sakya, he received important empowerments from Ngakchang Kunga Gyaltsen and Gonpo Ngodrup Pelbar, sons ofWangdu Nyingpo (1765-1806), the thirty-third throne-holder of the Sakya lineage, who had been a teacher of Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo (see chap. 6, fol. 78a). We will consider here a few other masters who were influential in Shabkar's spiritual quest. TERTON SONAM NYENTRAK At Urgeh, together with Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo, Shabkar received many transmissions from Terton Sonam Nyentrak, said be an ema-nation of Drogmi Lotsawa and the fifth descen-dant ofDudul Dorje (see chap. 4, fol. 44a). Little is known about this terton, but, according to Shabkar's autobiography, in which he is fre-quently mentioned, he appears to have been an influential teacher in the Rekong area. (See, for 557 instance, chap. 8, fol. 160a and chap. 9, fol. 180a). Through this master, Shabkar became connected with the lineage ofKathok, the oldest Nyingma Monastery in Kham (see NS, pp. 688ff.). KHARDO CHOKYI DOI\\JE Khardo Chokyi Dorje Rinpoche (mkhar rdo clws 9i rdo rje, died c. 1820) was a highly realized lama, initially of the Geluk tradition, who later became a Nyingma master and revealed some mind treasures (dgongs gter; see Appendix 1). He was a reincarnation of Khardo Sopa Gyatso (mkhar rdo bz:.od pa rgya mtsho, b. 1672), a main disciple of the hermit Drupkhangpa Gelek Gyatso (sgrub khang pa dge legs rgya mtsho, 1641-1713): Sopa Gyatso deliberately renounced the world at the early age of seven and, after some formal studies, devoted himself entirely to the contem-plative life at the age of seventeen, practicing the Great Graded Path. 1 Later in his life, he founded the retreat center of Khardo and wrote many instructions on contemplative practice (see BD, val. 5, pp. 361--69). His next reincarnation was Choden Wangpo (chos !dan dbangpo), the immedi-ate predecessor of Chokyi Dorje. As seen in chap. 9, fol. l98a, Shabkar re-ceived the transmission of several of this master's mind treasures and felt ')ust as though meeting the Dharma King Terdak Lingpa and other tertons of the past.\" A few writings of Khardo Rinpoche survive to this day.

CHINGKAR DONYO DORJE Chingkar Donyo Dorje,2 \"Meaningful Vajra Clad in White Felt,\" an important master in the lineage of the famed YangtiNagpo cycle ofDung-tso Repa (see chap. 4, note 17), was both a teacher and a disciple ofShabkar, a not uncom-mon occurrence among spiritual masters in Ti-bet. Like Khardo Rinpoche, Chingkar begun his studies in Gelukpa monasteries and eventually became a great yogin of the Nyingma tradition. Shabkar met Chingkar at Ngari Dzong Kar (see chap. 12, fol. 340a) and received several teachings from him. The oral tradition, as re-lated by Trulshik Rinpoche, has this to say about the relation between these two masters: \"Chingkar Donyo Dorje first became a Geshe of Sera Monastery. He then had a vision of Guru Rinpoche, prophesying that he would discover spiritual treasures. Following this pre-diction, Donyo Dorje abandoned the monastic life and became a yogin. For that reason he was despised, and for some time unable to spread the teachings. ''When Guru Rinpoche gave the Y ongtiNagpo teachings to King Trisong Detsen, Y eshe Tsogyal and Vairocana, he had predicted that an ema-nation of V airotsana would reveal them in the future. Accordingly, of the Three Roots of the r angtiNagpo, Dungtso Repa (see chap. 4, note 17) found the Yidam (deva) section. Chingkar Donyo Dorje, a reincarnation of Dungtso Repa, found the Lama (guru) section and the Khandro (dakini) section. He revealed several termas connected with the r angtiNagpo. Donyo Dotje's terton name was Guyang Lodeh Dechen Do-ngak Lingpa (gu yangs blo bde bde chen mdo sngags glingpa), the 'Serene Relaxed One', but he was also known as the 'Crazy Tekya' (rtas slg smyon pap When Shabkar came to Betse Doyon Dzong in Mangyul and taught the Dharma, Chingkar Donyo Dotje sat there, unnoticed among the crowd, along with his consort and children. At one point, Shabkar remained silent for a little while and then said, 'There is someone here greater than I.' As people wondered who he could be referring to, Shabkar pointed to the anonymous beggar yogin and invited him to sit on the seat next to him. By recognizing him in this way, Shabkar enabled Donyo Dorje to increase his activities for the benefit of beings and to spread the termas he had discovered. Shabkar and Donyo Dotje became very close and exchanged teachings, thus becoming con-nected to each other as both master and disciple.\" Chingkar Donyo Dorje's reembodiment was T rulshik Kunzang Thongdro1 ( 'khnd dTig kun bzang mtlwng grol, see r angtiNagpo, vol. 1, p. 446), whose subsequent reembodiment is the present Trulshik Rinpoche, Ngawang Chokyi Lodro (ngag dbang chos lgi blo gros, b. 1924), also known as Kunzang Trinley Drodul Tsel (kun bzang phrm las 'dro 'dul rtsal). In hi~ Collected Songs, fol. 145/b,4 Chingkar often speaks ofShabkar as one ofhis five princi-pal teachers.

Shabkar's lineage of the Khandro Nyingtlzig (see chap. 3, note 16) is detailed in DOL 3 (fol. 109/b), and represented in table 2. It is also quoted in one ofChingkar's Dzogchen writings, the Guyang Nyingtlzig, 6 which spread widely in Arndo and elsewhere. In the colophon of this text, Chingkar also speaks of Shabkar as \"the ultimate renunciate, the monarch of the wise and accom-plished masters, the VaJradhara Tsogdruk Rang-drol,\" and presents him as the main person who requested the composition of the text. The spiri-tual transmission of Chingkar's writings and visionary teachings is still alive today, owing especially to the efforts ofTrulshik Rinpoche. Later in his life, having returned to Arndo, Shabkar met two masters for whom he expressed great admiration. One was a Nyingmapa, Choying Topden Dorje, and the other a Gelukpa, Serkhang Dmje Chang. CHOYING TOPDEN DORJE Choying Topden Dmje (chos dbyings stobs ldan rdo rje, 1787?-1848) was a Nyingmapa master renowned for his tantric powers and his realiza-tion of the Great Perfection. He was a disciple the first Do Drupchen, Jigme Trinley Oser, Kunzang Shenpen (see Translator's Introduc-tion, note 48), and founded the monastery of Kohudeh Dzogchen Namgyal Ling, 7 where he taughtjigme Lingpa's limgchen Nyingthig cycle. Around 1833, Shabkar read some ofTobden Dmje's writings, including the Treasury of Sutra and T antra, 8 and was moved by faith. He sent a song of praise to the master, whom he calls Kushog Dzogchen Rinpoche, the Precious Mas-ter of the Great Perfection. Shabkar went to meet Tobden Dorje at Gartse. He was received with great pomp and ceremony, and Tobden Dorje compelled him to take his own seat. Shabkar then requested from Topden Dmje a longevity blessing and the transmission of the Treasury of Sutras and T antras. When Topden Dmje died in 1848, Shabkar performed all the funeral rituals and comforted the master's consort and two sons. From the colophon of the Treasury of Sutra and Tantra one reckons that this master was born around 1787. He composed thirteen volumes of writings (see RO, p. 651 ). His immediate reincarnation, Dzog-chen Tenpai Gyaltsen, was recognized in the Kokonor area. SERKHANG DORJE CHANG The Vajradhara Serkhang(gser khangrdo rje 'chang) was a remarkable Gelukpa master who spent most of his life in mountain retreats. He exem-plified the pure life-style of his Kadampa fore-fathers at a time when many Gelukpa monasteries in Arndo had become large institutions shelter-ing monks who had often ceased to follow the renunciate's ideals (as Shabkar notes in SH 2, pp. 310-12). Shabkar expressed great admiration for this master, who returned the sentiment, declaring Shabkar a \"Lord of the Buddha's Teachings\" (GL2, fol. 302). According to AC, vol. 2, pp. 151-54 and RO, p. 241, SerkhangLobzangTendzin Gyatso (gser khang blo bzang bstan 'tkin rgya mtsho) was born in 1780 and recognized by Arik Geshe (see above) to be the reincarnation ofRayo Jam yang Tendzin Gyatso (ra yo Jam dhyangs bstan 'dzin rgya mtsho). After studying at Ragya Monastery, he spent many years in retreat places such as Gopo Dzong, Tsonying Island and Serkhang, the place which lent him his name. He also made a pilgrimage to Wu Tai Shan, the Five-peaked Mountain of China. He died around l848 (see TS 2, p. 410-11 ). In his Emanated Scriptures of Orgyen, Shabkar mentions a biography of this master.9 Notes 1. For The Great Graded Patlz (lam rim chen mo), see chap. 3, note 8."},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"2. Chingkar Donyt:i Dmje (phying dkar donyod rdo rje) or \"Meaningful Vajra Clad in White Felt.\" Com-passionate teachers like Patrul Rinpoche and Shechen Gyaltsap Perna Namgyal, who emphasized the prac-tice of Bodhicitta, abstained from wearing or using animal furs and skins, and preferred using white felt for their coats and carpets. 3. Crazy Tekya (rtas slga smyon pa): rtas slga is written in a mystic dakini script and has no ordinary intelligible meaning. As communicated by Trulshik Rinpoche, because he was refused the consort he needed for the discovery of the Guru Sadluma (guru bla sgrub), Donyt:i Dorje (don yod rdo rje) could not reveal it fully and write it down. Soon afterward, the maiden who should have been his consort died. The parents felt great regret and contacted the yogin, who said that the auspicious connection had been missed. It is said that he brought the girl back to life for a few moments and gave her instructions, adding that he would guide her in the bardo. After these events, Donyo Dorje concealed the Yellow Scroll (slwg ser) for the Guru Sadhama in a mask, to be discovered again as a yanggter. His immediate reembodiment, the former Trulshik Rinpoche, Thongdrol Dorje (mtJwng grot rdo ry'e), found this Yellow Scroll when he came to Nepal with Dzatrul Ngawang Tendzin Norbu (rtka sprul ngag dbang bstan 'dzin nor bu, 1867-1940, the present Trulshik Rinpoche's root teacher) to perform the reconsecration of the Bodhnath stupa. Thongdrol Dorje also wrote expanded versions of the other sadhanas of the Three Roots. 4.

Tendzin Chogyal (bstan 'rkin chosrgyal, 1592-1654), otherwise known as Gushri Khan, left his pasture lands in Urumchi to establish himself near Lake Kokonor. He had three queens and ten sons. His descendants in the region ofKokonor and along the banks of the Machu River became known as the Barungar (Right Banner) of the Orad Mongols. The Mongolian nation was divided into a series of principalities or \"banners\" (fib. dpon khag, Mong. klwshwz). Each was ruled by aJasag (ja sag, pronounced tk.asa by Tibetans), who could belong to any of the various ranks of the Mongo-lian nobility, from that of Chingwang, king or prince of the first order, to that of Gung, or duke. These \"banners\" were in tum subdivided into \"arrows\" (fib. mda', Mong. sumwz), originally a group of 150 adult men and their families. See Howorth (1876), Ahmad (1970), and Ho-chin Yang (1969). Thirty-three ''banners\" and a hun-dred and one \"arrows\" are mentioned by Sumpa Khenpo as existing in the Kokonor area. As Konchog Tenpa Rabgye points out (AC, val. 1, pp. 56-I 05), there exist several different, often contradictory, accounts of Gushri Khan's genealogy. The clearest records of the rulers of the right, or southern, bank of the Machu River 565 are given by KonchogTenpa Rabgye, by Konchog Gyaltsen, in his History of Chino., TWet, and Mongolia (rgya bod sog gi lo rgyus), and by Muge Samten (a scholar ofLabrang T ashikhyil) in his recent article drir Zan /i. dwangs rang sgra.

Tsering Elduchi's eldest son, Khandro Lobzang Tenkyong (mkha' 'gro blo bzang bstan slgong), conquered the entire Six Ranges of Kham (mdo khams sgang drug, see chap. 14, note 23) and adjacent regions up to Dartsedo (dar rtse mdo, Tachienlu or Kanding) in the east. He even-tually settled in the Dzachukha area (rtk.a chu kha) and adopted the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Other chieftains were displeased by this and had him assassinated. Lobzang Tenkyong was succeeded by his younger brother, Dar Gyalpo Shokthu (dar rgyal po shag thu), who first settled near Lake Kokonor and later in Balshung ('balgz}zung) and Tseshung (rtse gdzung), a place to the southeast of the Machu River where Shabkar stayed for many years in retreat. Dar Gyalpo also extended his territories to include most of Amdo and Kham, up to Konjo (go jo). During his reign the region enjoyed a period of great prosperity.

Junang also proved to be a powerful monarch, and enlarged his frontiers as far as Golok Dzamthang (mgo log 'rk.am thang). It was he who offered land to the first Jam yang Shepa 1 and helped him to build the large monastery of Lab rang T ashikhyil in 1708. Later, at the height of its prosperity, this monastery counted four thousand monks and fifty incarnate Lamas. King Junang had three queens, one of whom, Chungurza Namgyal Drolma, gave birth to a son, Dondrup Wangyal (don gruh dbang rgyalj. The latter, however, died young. Junang therefore adopted as his heir Tendzin Wangchuk (bstan 'dzin dbang phyug), the third son of his elder brother lha K yap Mergen Tai Ching (/Jza s9abs me rgan ta'i eking). Tendzin Wangchuk's youngest son, Dorje Palam (rdo de pha lam), inherited the title ofChing-wang at an early age, since both his parents and two ofhis elder brothers died during his infancy. However, he died without issue in 17 70, and was succeeded by a cousin, the son of]asag Wangchuk Rabten (ja sag dbang phyug rab brtan). 21bis son was Ngawang Dargye, Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo (ngag dbang dar rgyas clws rgyal ngag gi dbang po, 1736-1807), Shabkar's teacher. Following the death ofK.ingJunang, a series of bloody feuds broke out among the rulers of the Kokonor area, with the result that by the time Ngawang Dargye inherited the throne, the power of the Wang rulers was reduced to the region ofSogpo, south ofRekong. Nevertheless, Ngawang Dargye received the title ofChingwang and eventually ruled over two to three thousand families (as compared with the thirty thousand acknowledging the authority ofjunang). Ngawang Dargye devoted most ofhis life to spiritual activities; eventually he asked his brother, Benmukjasag Lobzang Tendzin (ban mugja sag blo bzang bstan 'dzin), to administer most of the domestic affairs. It so happened, however, that Lobzang Tendzin fell foul of the central Tibetan Appendix 3 567 government and was deprived of the title of Chingwang. Mter his death, Ngawang Dargye was suc-ceeded by his son, Wang T ashijungne (wang bkra shis 'byung gnas). According to AC (vol. 2, p. 123), the latter had three sons, one of whom, Tashi Wangyal (bkra shis dbang rgya~, ascended the throne. The Ven. Tulku Thondup, however, tells us of a different oral tradition: \"Tashijungne became the disciple ofDola Jigme Kalzang, 3 a great Nyingmapa master, him-self one of the main disciples of the first Do Drupchen, Jigme Trinley Oser. Mter having been invited to Tashijungne's court, Dolajigme went to China. There he encountered a thief who was going to be tortured to death by being made to ride an iron horse which, like a cast iron oven, was being slowly heated red hot by a fire within. Seeing this, in order to spare the thief, Dola Jigme immediately claimed that he had committed the theft. He was seized, and died on the iron horse. When they heard that their mas-ter had died in China, Dola Jigme's disciples blamed Tashijungne, thinking he was respon-sible for their master going to China. One of them, Alak Dzong Ngon, put a curse on Tashi Jungne so that he could have no male descen-dants. The oral sources claim that Tashijungne had only daughters, who themselves had no sons.'' Tashijungne's descendants are now living near Rekong, in Amdo. One of them married Apa Alo (a relative of the ftfthjamyang Shepa), who became a very popular secular leader in Amdo until his death in 1988. Notes I.

Following this empowerment, Shabkar spent five years in Tseshung Hermitage practic-ing this cycle of teachings, which covers the entire spiritual path from the preliminaries to the Great Perfection. It was during this period of intense practice that Shabkar's meditative experiences and ultimate realization gradually unfolded (see chap. 4, fol. 41 b). Later on, the Wzsh-.fo!filling Gem, Hayagriva and Varahi remained the innermost empowerment and instructions that Shabkar be-stowed upon his close disciples. Today, this is perhaps the only terma of Dechen Gyalpo for which the transmission has remained unbroken. Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo was also known, at different times and in different places, as Monlam Dmje, Ngawang Dmje, Karak Terton, Kongpo Terchen, and Drukthang Terton.1 He was the immediate reincarnation ofRatOn Terton Topden Dmje, 2 a master whose termas were also practiced by Shabkar. The ramifications of Dechen Gyalpo's lineage (see table 4) reveal close connections with other important spiritual lin-eages, such asjigme Lingpa's LJmgchen Nyingtlzig, which Shabkar's teacher, Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo, held too. Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo was born in 1736 in an area below the White Vulture Pass (rgod dJw la) at Samye. He studied at Samye and at Palri Monastery (dpal ri mgon) at Chongye ('phyongrgyas). 569 His principal spiritual teachers were Kunzang Oser, Chubri Drupchen Kunzang Rangdrol, and especially Rigdzin Thukchog Dmje, 3 who became his root master and whom he served for many years. At the age of five or six, Dechen Gyalpo had a vision of Guru Padmasambhava. It is said that he was forever aftexwards accom-panied by dakinis, who followed him like his shadow. At the age of twelve he found the list of the termas he was to discover, and at the age of twenty-six he revealed the Fi:oe Essential Cycles of the Fi:oe Families (rigs lnga snying po'i slwr lnga) from the sacred site of Rolpu on the border between Upper Kongpo and Lower Dagpo. Following this he revealed many other spiritual treasures in Powo, Kongpo, Dagpo, Tsari, Samye, Drigung, and elsewhere.4 At Tsechen Drolma Lhakhang (rtse chen sgrol ma 1Jza khang), near Gyantse, he revealed profound instructions that had been concealed by Atisha. Altogether he rediscovered eighteen spiritual treasures. Dechen Gyalpo became the teacher of the regent-king of Tibet, Demo Rinpoche, 5 who invited him to perform the ''Taming the Ground\" ritual (sa 'dulj on the occasion of the restoration of Samye in 1770. Dechen Gyalpo performed many miracles. To extract a terma from a high cliff at the Grove of the Secret Mantras, Sang-ngak Gatsel (gsang sngags dga' tshal), in inner Tsari, he flew through the sky like a bird. In other places he left imprints ofhis hands and feet in rocks. In Dagpo, a statue of Gampopa took off its hat and spoke to him.

His main patrons were the lliagyari king ofE Rigpai Jungne (erigpa'i 'lryunggnas) and other notables of Dagpo and Kongpo. He passed away in Kongpo, where he had settled after he had been offered Drukthang Monastery (see note 1 ). Many relics the size and shape of sesame seeds, as well as naturally formed images of deities, were found among his bones and ashes. According to GC, vol. 4, p. 143, Dechen Gyalpo passed away after Shamar IX Trisur Garwang Gyatso, which means not before 1791 (Garwang Gyatso lived fifty-eight years and could not have been born before 1733, since Shamar VIII died in 1732). According to the Necklace of Jewels (ND), Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo's next incarnation was the eldest son of Orgyen Drodul Lingpa9 (the fifth Gampopa, b. 1 7 57), one of his chief dis-ciples. This incarnation revealed some termas, but died young. An oral tradition, related to us by Ven. Khetsun Sangpo, who is a native of Bartang, 10 near Karak, presents some little-known aspects ofDechen Gyalpo's life-story. \"In his youth, Dechen Gyalpo was a humble shepherd on the slopes ofjomo Karak, at a place called Y angdrong Shika (yang grong gl)zi kha) in Bartang (bar !hang). Soon he developed into a realized siddha blessed with many visions and signs of accomplishment. For a long time he lived in a cave called Dechen (bde chen, 'Great Bliss'), where Guru Padmasambhava had spent six months in meditation at the edge of the eternal snows on the secluded heights ofjomo Appendix 4 5 71 Karak's western slopes. On account of this, Dechen Gyalpo became renowned as Karak T erton. Several statues, preserved in this area until the Chinese invasion, 11 depicted him as an impressive, large, bearded lama, not unlike Minling Terchen Gyurme Dmje. \"Some say that when, in the latter period of his life, Dechen Gyalpo's fame as a spiritual teacher had spread far and wide, some peasants from his valley who had come to meet him in southern Tibet were amazed-and somewhat disappointed-to discover that the great master they had come to meet was none other than the shepherd they had known. But others say that this anecdote stemmed from a confusion with a similar event that happened to Thangtong Gyalpo when he resided at Chuwori.\" The Taphag Yishin Norbu (rta phagyid b<ftm nor bu) belongs to the larger cycle of the Klzandro Sangwa r eshe (mkha' 'gro gsang ba ye shes). The ac-count of its discovery is found in the terma texts 12 and in the Torch of W?SdJJm (1W, pp. 8-20), a commentary on them written by Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo, of which the following is a summary: Langchen Palgyi Senge was Yeshe Tsogyal's companion while she practiced Vajra Kilaya at Paro Taktsang in Bhutan. Mter numerous rebirths, he appeared as Raton Terton Rigdzin Topden Dmje, whose immediate reincarnation, born in the Fire Dragon Year (1736), was the treasure rediscoverer Dechen Gyalpo Tsel. At the age of thirty-two (in the Pig Year, 1767), when Dechen Gyalpo was in strict retreat at Chuwori, a beautiful woman, magnificently dressed and adorned, appeared to him at dawn on the fnteenth of the eighth month and said, \"In the east, in the cave called Sang Yak Drak, you will receive a prophecy from Guru Rinpoche.\" First, Dechen Gyalpo suspected that this was a hallucination, but the woman reappeared many times, urging him to go. Finally, he went to this place and at dawn, on the fifteenth of the rawa month 13 of the Earth Mouse Year ( 1 7 68), Dechen Gyalpo's brother, Rigden Yinrik, told the terton, \"I can see many things appearing in the sky.\" At that very moment, Dechen Gyalpo had an experience of intense bliss and saw Guru Perna Gyalpo, one of the eight manifestations of"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"5 72 The Life of Shabkar Guru Padrnasambhava, in the sky, encircled by an expanse of five-colored rainbow light. On either side of him were the lady Mandarava, dressed as a nun, and Yeshe Tsogyal, dressed as a Tibetan laywoman. They were surrounded by myriads of dakas and dakinis who made offer-ings, danced, and sang, assuming innumerable attitudes and expressions. Moreover, King Pehar appeared at the head of a wonderful procession, waving fragrant incense. All the sky was filled, as if by clouds, with gods and rakshas of the eight classes.14 Seeing this, Dechen Gyalpo prayed fervently, and Guru Perna Gyalpo said: Aho! Listen, supreme son who is like my own heart. I, Padrnakara ofUddiyana, Never fail to fulfill karmic connections. Let my words dissolve into your heart, noble son; The time has come to reawaken your excellent potential! In the sublime hidden land ofPemako, the Lotus Array, 15 To the right of the throne upon which I dwell in the form of the Medicine Buddha Is a treasure that was meant for Topden Dmje. Yet because of the scant merit ofbeings in this dark age, The profound requisite conditions did not manifest for him. Now is the time for this siddhi To be granted to you, his next rebirth. Pray from your heart that it will benefit beings! By the power of our past prayers, The actual Yellow Scroll, 16 endowed with pure and perfect karmic links, Will be brought to you by dakinis From Pemako's divine land. Northeast ofhere, at the Treasure Chest, 17 Tsogyal will be holding the Yellow Scroll. She herself will utter the symbolic words And decipher the symbolic writings. These teachings will spread to Tibet, Mongolia, and China, And bring immeasurable benefit to beings. Then Perna Gyalpo predicted that auspi-cious connections would be established if the terton could find a dakini who was an incarna-tion ofShakyadevi [one of Guru Rinpoche's five main consorts]; he also gave many other predic-tions. For seven days after this, rainbows filled the sky. later, in Yeshe Tsogyal's Secret Cave at Shoto Terdrom in Drigung, Dechen Gyalpo, having fulfilled all of Guru Rinpoche's predic-tions and auspicious connections, received the temza in direct transmission (snyan brgyud), amidst many miraculous signs. When he practised the sadhana related to the temza, he dreamt that he went to Zangdok Palri and received empower-ment from Thekchen Lingpa, whom he per-ceived as inseparable from Guru Rinpoche. In the Crystal Mirror (CM), a manual for practicing the Taphag Yishin Norbu written by one ofShabkar's chief disciples, Gurong Tullm Natsok Rangdrol, the transmission of the temza in Shoto Titro (same as Terdrom) and its propagation are related in the following way: While Dechen Gyalpo was practicing for a long time at Chuwori and other sacred places, living on alms, he received repeated predictions from the gurus and dakinis. When he was thirty-three years old, he came to the Secret Cave of Tsogyal at Shoto Titro. On the fifteen of the month of the sheep (sixth month) in the female Earth Ox Year (1769), while he was offering a large ganachakra feast, he beheld Guru Padrna-sambhava and his consort appearing in a sky filled with rainbows. As Guru Padrnasambhava gave him the direct oral transmission (snyan brgyudJ18 of the profound terma, rainbow cano-pies shone in all directions, the air was filled with extraordinary fragrances, and many other mi-raculous signs occurred. When Dechen Gyalpo practiced this spiri-tual treasure he had many visions and medita-"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"tion experiences, such as receiving empower-ments from Guru Padmasambhava and the wis-dom dakinis. Keeping to the injunction of Guru Padmasambhava and his consort, he kept his terma secret for ten years. When the time was ripe for establishing his fortunate disciples on the path of maturation and liberation, following the repeated requests of the terma guardians and the Dhanna protectors, on the first day of the first month of the male Earth Dog Year (1778) he undertook a special spiritual practice on top of Chuwori Mountain. On the twenty-second, in the morning, he offered an elaborate ganachakra feast. When he supplicated the guardians of the terma, there appeared, on a mass of clouds, a resplendent blue dakini, naked and without ornaments. She held in her right hand an arrow of long life, and in her left hand a mirror and a treasure box. This was the sign that the terma could now be propagated. Through these profound teachings, he set countless male and female disciples on the path of ripening and liberation. Among these was his spiritual son Orgyen Tendzin Rinpoche, who had been prophesied to be the heir to this spiri-tual treasure. Orgyen Tendzin gave the com-plete transmission to the glorious Dharma King Chogyal Ngakyi Wangpo, who had been pre-dicted to be the mind incarnation of Guru Padmasambhava and the terma's next spiritual heir. When Ngakyi Wangpo practiced the Three Roots of the Ierma, he had visions of the mandala and the deities, and many miraculous signs occurred: sparks and smoke came from the tarmas, and vessels of amrita and rakta overflowed. The Dhanna King subsequently disseminated these teachings widely in Tibet, Mongolia, and China. His main spiritual heir was Shabkar. In this way, the lineage of the Taphag Yishin Norbu has come down to the present, unbroken (see table 4). In a song, 19 the Dharma King invokes this spiritual lineage: Samantabhadra and consort, Vajrasattva, Great wisdom dakini Lekyi Wangmo, Humchenkara, Lapkyi Dronma, Pejung, Tsogyal, Palseng, Dechen Gyal, Appendix 4 57 3 Orgyen Tendzin and all the other glorious root and lineage gurus-With your extraordinary blessings, Make a rain of siddhis fall, And bless this fortunate disciple's three doors as the three vajras. According to this supplication, the transmis-sion thus passed from the primordial dharmakaya Buddha, Samantabhadra, and his dharmakaya consort Samantabhadri, to the sambhogakaya Buddha Vajrasattva, and then to the wisdom dakini Lekyi Wangmo.20 It then went to the dakini Lapkyi Dronma who, according to TW (p. 139) and to theNecklaceqfJ.t1tite.Lotuses(NW),21 is said to reside to the east of the Great Holy Mountains of China. 22 From Guru Padmasambhava the lineage passed to his chief consort and disciple, the prin-cess ofKarchen, Yeshe Tsogyal, a human ema-nation ofJetsun Drolma and Vajrayogini, who wrote down and helped to conceal most of the termas that Guru Rinpoche had taught to his disciples. It then passed to Palgyi Senge, one of Guru Rinpoche's twenty-five main disciples. Guru Rinpoche entrusted the teachings of the T aphag Yishin Norbu to him and predicted that, in a future rebirth, Palgyi Senge would reveal these teachings and propagate them for the sake of beings. This prophesied rebirth Was the treasure discoverer Terchen Dechen Gyalpo, whose spiri-tual heir was Orgyen Tendzin. According to NW, Orgyen Tendzin is said to have lived at Dechen Ling, Rina Monastery.23 CM states un-ambiguously that Ngakyi Wangpo24 received the transmission from Orgyen Tendzin. There is no mention of Ngakyi Wangpo meeting Dechen Gyalpo, although he was the latter's contem-porary. Ngakyi Wangpo transmitted these teach-ings to Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol. In chapter 9, Shabkar says that in 1824, at Rina Monas-tery,25 he received from Orgyen Tendzin the transmission of \"the New Termas.\" This cer-tainly refers to Dechen Gyalpo's revelations, and probably to the Taphag rtshin Norbu.

At the request of several disciples, especially of Shabkar himself, Ngakyi Wangpo wrote The T arch oJWisdom That Dispels theDarlatess of Ignorance (fW), a lucid explanation of the practice ofT aphog rishin Norbu. This explanation covers the com-plete spiritual path from the preliminary prac-tices up to the highest teachings of the Great Perfection. A manuscript copy of this text, in Shabkar's own handwriting, was enshrined in a golden stupa containing some bones and other relics of Shabkar at Pelek Gonpa in central Tibet. 29 Some relatives of Lopon Khyentse, a disciple of Dza Trulshik Rinpoche, saved and concealed these relics when the reliquary was destroyed by the Chinese invaders. Later, Lopon Khyentse offered this manuscript to Trulshik Rinpoche, who in tum presented it to H.H.

A large number of these texts originated from the hbrary ofKyabje Kangyur Rinpoche in Drujeeling. In our days, it is through the efforts of the Ven.

Tsering, 1991 ), he was the main teacher of the famed woman master Shuksep Jetsun Chonyi Zang-mo (shug gseb rje btsun clw '!ftl bzang mo, 1852-1953). He was active in Kyirong (slgidgroniJ. He must have been quite young when he received the transmission from Shabkar, and lived to a ripe old age since, not long before his death, he met the thirteenth Dalai Lama (1876-1933). He met Shabkar possibly in Kyirongin 1818-19, and most likely before the saint's return to Amdo in 1825. The biography of the Shuksepjetsun gives no indication that Perna Gyatso traveled to Amdo. 27.

His style is among the clearest and most beautiful found in Tibetan literature. Shabkar writes in the lively, often colloquial manner that later characterized Patrul Rinpoche's works such as his Wordr qf My Perfect Teacher (kun bzang blo. ma'i z}zallung). Color-fully and effectively, he articulates a fresh exposi-tion of the truths underlying the contemplative life, weaving together stories from traditional scrip-tures and anecdotes from recent times to make the Dharma a living reality in one's own life. Although the author's erudition is daunting, his main focus is not theoretical knowledge but bring-ing the essence of the teachings to life. The evocative titles ofhis works-The Moun-tain qf Gold, 1he Songs Arisen on the Mirror qf Mind, 1he Ma11:)1-st:ringed Lute--open the reader's mind to the teachings they contain. The expression Emanated Scriptures appears in the titles of nine of Shabkar's major works. In his autobiography (chap. l 0), Shabkar explains, ''I called these teach-ings 'emanated' to indicate their authenticity. They are as though emanated from earlier scrip-tures, just as one butter-lamp is lit from another.\" Shabkar's writings never remain frozen in one literary style or confmed to one viewpoint. His series of Emanated Scriptures succeeds in capturing and conveying the savor and the essential teach-ings of all the main streams ofTibetan Buddhism. Shabkar's works never fall into being mere imitations. While he makes free use of quotations from past masters, his explanations are strikingly 577 original, and are expressed in his own vigorous, lucid manner without lapsing into pedantry. This style became characteristic of a number of writ-ers of the nineteenth century, a time of Renais-sance in Tibetan Buddhism. Although no listing (dkar chag) of Shabkar's collected works seems to have been written in the master's time, most ofhis works are referred to in his autobiography or in his other writings. In 1988 Jigme Thekcho included a partial list of Shabkar's writings in his History qfthe Great Monas-tery qf Rongpo. 1 In 1993 Pal Gyalkar presented an extensive list, with abstracts, of the master's works, and an excellent analysis ofhis style.2 The latter is so far the best study in the Tibetan language on Shabkar's literary production. A few of Shabkar's works described in this Appendix, how-ever, appear in neither of these two lists.3 Excellent wood blocks existed at Tashikhyil Hermitage in Amdo for almost the entire corpus ofShabkar's works Through the efforts ofSangye Rinchen, one of Shabkar's close disciples, most of them were copied and carved during Shabkar's lifetime. Shortly after the master's death, Sangye Rinchen completed his task by carving both another volume of Collected Songs and the second part ofShabkar's autobiography (see Translator's Introduction). These wood blocks were burned during the Cultural Revolution, but printed vol-umes made from them were hidden and saved.

Early one morning at Amnye Machen (see chap. 7, fol. 13ab ), Shabkar had a vision of a king who told him, \"It is very wonderful that you adhere to the life-style of our holy predecessors, singing songs of the sacred teachings. I name you 'Bard of the Lmd ofSnows'. It is most kind of you to leave thousands of songs as the heritage ofTibet. They will bring immense benefit to faithful disciples.\" Shabkar is often compared to Milarepa, not only for his way of life and his spiritual accom-plishments, but also for his amazing ability to improvise extemporaneous songs. From down-to-earth advice on ethics and conduct, through highly ornate poetry sent to spiritual masters and kings, up to songs setting forth the vastness of the Dzogchen view, each song has a particular fla-vor. In whatever style he chooses to adopt, the Bard of Tibet effortlessly displays his mastery of all facets ofTibetan literary art. The collections of songs are a mine of infor-mation about both Shabkar's activities and his disciples. Several smaller collections were gath-ered at every sacred place where Shabkar spent time: Lake Kokonor, Tsari, Mount Kailash, Lapchi, etc. (See below under Miscellaneous Writings). Later, many of the songs were incor-porated in the two autobiographies (see Translator's Introduction, p. xix). Yet, there were still enough written songs left to fill two more Appendix 5 579 volumes. The complete edition, which contains over a thousand songs, has been published by the Qinghai Nationalities Press.

Composed at Tsonying Island when the author was around twenty-six (1807), this is perhaps Shabkar's most famous work. In twenty-three short songs addressed to his disciples, it intro-duces-with striking beauty, simplicity, and clar-ity-the profound view, meditation and practice ofDzogchen, the Great Perfection. The Flight of the Garuda (mkha' lding gslwg rlo.bs), which gives its name to the collection, is the first part of a trilogy; it focuses on the Trekcho section of Dzogchen practice, which leads directly to realization of the ultimate nature of mind. It has been translated into English by E. Schmidt (1987) and by Keith Dowman (1993), and in part into German by Franz-Karl Ehrhard (1990). The latter also offers a detailed analysis of the text and its background. The second part, in eighteen songs, presents the fundamentals ofThogal, the ultimate practice of Dzogchen. The third part, in three songs, elucidates actual instructions for that visionary practice, based on the oral tradi-tion.

(See chap. 6, fol 117a) Inspired by this dream, disciples requested that Shabkar compose a teaching in verse on the graded path (!om rim), easy to comprehend and to practice. In answer to their request, he wrote 1he T arch That IllmnituJJes the Graded Paih (!om rim gsal ba'i sgron me). Shabkar's intention was to write an intermediate version of the Graded Path teachings of Tsong-khapa-shorter than the lengthy Greai Graded Paih (!om rim chen mo), yet more detailed than the Candensed Meaning of the Graded Paih (/om rim bsdus don). Com-posed in verses of fifteen syllables each, this treatise is the most formal ofShabkar's works. 7he Berufo:ial Sun, A Dharma Discourse chos bshad gdum phan rryi ma, composed in 1811, at Cholung near Lhasa.

Such people sometimes emerge from a long session of teach-ings with nothing to keep in mind and nothing to pass on to others. They can only say, 'The mas-ter spoke at length, but we did not understand what he said. We would like to practice, but we don't know how to begin.'\" In order to benefit everyone, even the most uneducated people, Shabkar composed this text. He said, \"When my disciples kept on asking for these teachings, I had no book from which to draw stories and quotations; yet like a generous person who turns his bag inside out and pours all the contents onto a cloth spread on the ground, without holding anything back, I wrote down everything that came into my mind and called it The Beneficial Sun.\" The structure of this text is typical of several other writings ofShabkar that focus on Mahayana training. Beginning with the basic law of karma, cause and effect, he explains how negative thoughts and actions lead to suffering and posi-tive ones bring happiness. He also explains the value ofhuman existence: to misuse or squander this life is like filling a jeweled golden vase with f:t.lth. Through vividly depicting the sufferings of animals, he stresses the evils of hunting, fishing, butchering animals, and eating meat. Having emphasized the essential role of loving-kindness, compassion, and Bodhicitta as the very essence of the Mahayana path, Shabkar exhorts everyone to be altruistic and open-minded, to have a good heart, and to renounce selfishness and all the deluded pursuits of this ephemeral world. Finally, he explains the impor-tance of dedicating the merits of virtuous actions to the benefit of others. 7he Beneficial Moon, The Beneficial Jewel and The Offering Cloud of Samantahhadra chos bshad gdum phan zla ba, composed at Tsari in 1812.

It presents nonattachment and renunciation as the keys to spiritual progress and"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"happiness. If no inner transformation comes out of study, meditation and action, it is because of desiring the pleasures of this life. Shabkar exhorts us to go to a secluded mountain retreat without postponing our spiritual practice any further. A novice practitioner who practices in bustling places stacks all the odds against his or her suc-cess on the spiritual path. On the contrary, soli-tary places allow even vulnerable beginners to foster their progress without hindrance. Although the welfare ofbeings must be their only preoccu-pation, immature practitioners should not has-ten to help or teach others before they have developed a stable realization.

It presents the essence of the Great Graded Path, Mind Training, Mahamudra, Dzogchen, and the Dohas. 6 In a hundred folios containing twenty-two pieces of advice, Shabkar states in a clear and effective way the essentials of spiritual practice: the need to renounce the world, to rely on a spiritual master, and to unite meditation on emptiness with compassion. He also explains how to prac-tice meditation and maintain at all times the insight thus gained, how to practice absolute Bodhicitta and realize the union of appearance and emptiness, how to merge one's mind with the guru's mind, how to liberate thoughts as they arise; and how to cultivate nonsectarian pure perception toward all the different teachings.

This text was composed at Tashikhyil Hermit-age after Shabkar's return from central Tibet. It opens with a powerful admonition against eating meat, one ofShabkar's favorite themes. Shabkar quotes at length several Mahayana sutras, espe-. cially the Lankavatara Sutra (often said to be \"the quintessence of the Buddha's words\"), in which the Buddha says, \"Those who practice loving-kindness should consider all sentient beings as their own children; therefore, they must give up eating meat.\" The sixth chapter of this sutra is entirely devoted to condemnation of the eating of meat. Contrary to common belief, not only the sutras but also the tantras condemn meat-eating. The Tantra qf the Great Compassionate One Wlw Dredges the Depths qf Samsara (thugs rje chen po 'ldwr ba dong sprug gi rgyud), for instance, says that the result of eating meat is rebirth in the hell realm for one kalpa. If one eats the meat of an animal one has killed oneself or asked someone to kill for oneself, one will be reborn in the hell realm for a hundred thousand kalpas. Many great saints of the past have denounced meat-eating. The ''divine madman'' Drukpa Kunleg, seeing monks going to buy meat at the autumn market, exclaimed, \"Here is a den of wolves, here is adenofwolves!\" AndMilarepasaid, ''Havingslaugh-tered innocent animals, one eats their flesh and drinks intoxicants: all the conditions come together for rebirth in the hell realm.\" The second section of the text depicts the negative effects of drinking. It quotes Guru Padmasambhava and Lord Buddha, who said, ''Whoever drinks a drop of alcohol is not my disciple.\" The third section discusses sex, pre-senting it as a compulsive craving that leads to all kinds of negative behavior.

In many of his writings, Shabkar emphasizes the approach of Mind Training, including renunciation of worldly pleasures, since such an approach is suited to most practitioners. Here, Shabkar explains the fundamentals of the path that utilizes sense-pleasures and bliss as catalysts for spiritual progress. He clearly delin-eates the conditions that must be fulfilled by the exceptional practitioners who can perform such practices in a valid way. Shabkar wrote this text when his disciples requested that he compose a teaching that would universally inspire pure vision toward Vajrayana yogins. In the colophon Shabkar mentions that he first conceived the wish to write such a text when he saw, during his travels, that many people thoughtlessly criticized practitioners of the Vajrayana who did not renounce meat, alcohol, and sex. In the introduction he states, \"Although many individuals in this age appear to be merely indulging their worldly desires, one does not have the capacity to judge them, so it is best to train in pure vision.\" With the help of many quotations he de-fends the Nyingma tradition against its detrac-tors, warning that it is a serious fault to disparage an authentic tradition because of prejudice and ignorance. He also shows that all views and traditions are mutually noncontradictory and lead to the same goal. Sense-pleasures, says Shabkar, are like fire: if one does not know how to use them, one gets burned. Yet, for a genuine Vajrayana practitio-ner, bliss and the experiences of the five senses are offerings to the Three Roots and effect swift progress toward realization. It is craving and attachment that make one fall into the lower realms, not sense-pleasure itsel£ Shabkar also explains at length that one Appendix 5 583 should treat one's human body properly, using proper food and clothing to sustain one's life and use it solely to practice the Dharma. One needs to renounce worldly concerns but not to mistreat . one's body. Extreme asceticism is inappropriate. Shabkar also explains the reasons why the Vajrayana must be kept secret, and concludes, \"Since one cannot judge the actions of Bodhi-sattvas and great siddha.s, one must cultivate pure perception toward them. Yet, immature disciples should not thoughtlessly try to imitate them.\" 1he Mountain of Gold rang g<lzan thams cad 'tshengs pa'i gdams ngag gser gyi ri bo. 4 7 fols. Tashikhyil edition.

These, and others, are the various methods that allow one to perfect the twofold accumulation of wisdom and merit.

Shabkar shows that termas are found in all lineages oflndian and Tibetan Buddhism, not exclusively in the Nyingma lineage, and he quotes great masters from various schools who indicate that the terma tradition is especially needed and appropriate for this \"final age.\" The third section describes how Lord Atisha Diparnkaraand Tsongkhapa LobzangTrakpa were both emanations ofPadmasambhava The second Dalai lama, Gedun Gyatso, for instance, wrote, Awareness Holder, the Lord ofSiddhas, Padmakara, Crest Ornament of five hundred fpanditas], the glorious Dipamkara, Mighty Vajra Bearer, the exalted Lobzang Trakpa: I bow down to you who display the dance of various emanations. Arik Geshe (see Translator's Introduction, p. xxix n. 46), a great nonsectarian Gelukpa master, also said, \"To be able to practice the Dharma is due to the unique kindness of Guru Padmasambhava, who bound under oath all negative forces in Tibet.\" Having thus quoted many masters from all schools, Shabkar lays special emphasis on the important relationship between the Nyingma master Lodrak Drupchen Lekyi Dorje and Tsongkhapa. 7 The oral tradition also says that Lekyi Dorje described Tsongkhapa as someone who attained instant realization (gcig char ba). 8 Tsongkhapa used to ask Lekyi Dorje questions to clarify profound aspects of his spiritual prac-tice. Lekyi Dorje, who had frequent visions of Vajrapani, the \"Lord of Secrets,\" would present these queries to Vajrapani, and convey the latter's answers to Tsongkhapa. These answers are pure Dzogchen teachings, highly similar in word and content to those of Padmasambhava's Klzandro Nyingthig (see chap. 3, note 16). When he first encountered Lekyi Dorje, Tsongkhapa was on his way to India to meet Indian panditas in order to clarify his understanding of the doctrine. How-ever, according to some prophecies he received, Lekyi Dorje persuaded Tsongkhapa to remain in Tibet. This event had an immense impact on the unfolding of the history of Tibet. The fourth section is a fmal encouragement to disentangle oneselffrom the bonds ofsamsara and quickly reach Buddhahood: maintaining pure vision toward all teachings, one must follow the life-examples of all the masters of the past. 1he Stream of Ambrosia, An Excellent Discourse legs bshad bdwl rtsi'i chu rgyun.

It opens with a beautiful hyrrm to compassion, adorned with many quotations that Shabkar collected throughout his life. It contin-ues with two sections in which he again con-derrms uncompromisingly the eating of meat by Buddhist practitioners. On the Mahayana path, says Shabkar, eating meat, at the cost of great suffering for animals, is unacceptable.9In the Sutra of The Great Nirvana (Mahoparinirvana-sutra), the Buddha said, \"The eating of meat annihi-lates the seed of compassion,\" and in the Lankavatara Sutra he taught, \"If, bereft of compas-sion and wisdom, you eat meat, you have turned your back on liberation. . . . Meat is food for ferocious beasts, improper to eat.\" Shabkar articulates here the most sweeping indictment against meat-eating found in Tibet-an literature. This was particularly relevant at a time when the prediction the Buddha made in the Lankavatara Sutra had already become a real-ity: \"In the future, meat-eaters, speaking out of ignorance, will say that the Buddha permitted the eating of meat, and that he taught there was no sin in doing so.\" MISCELlANEOUS WRITINGS Words of Aduice to Self and Others rang g</lan gyi sems la phan pa'i gsung nye mkho kha shas.

In his History of the Great Monastery of Rongpo (RO, p. 646),Jigme Thekcho, speaks of twenty-two major works of Shabkar: nine \"Emanated Scrip-tures\" (sprul pa'iglegs bam), three \"Excellent Discourses\" (legs bshat!), three \"Dharma Discourses\" (clws bshat!), three \"Songs on the View\" (lta mgur), and four \"Auto-biographical Songs\" (mam mgui). However, he does not identify them individually. The nine \"Emanated Scriptures\" have been re-viewed above. The three \"Excellent Discourses\" are Th Self-arising Sun (legs bshad nyi ma rang shar), Th Golden Scalpel (legs bshadgser gyi thur ma), and Th Offer-ing-Cloud of Samantabhadra (legs bshad kun bzang mchod sprin). In his autobiography, Shabkar mentions four, not three, \"Dharma Discourses\": Th Beneficial Sun (clws bshad g;:han phan rryi ma), Th Beneficial Moon (chos bshad g;:Jwn phan zla ba), Th Beneficial Jewel (chos bshad g;:Jwn phan nor bu) and Th Offering-Cloud ofSamantabhadra (chos bshad kun bzang mchod sprin). The three \"Songs on the View\" may corre-spond to the trilogy of Th Flight of the Garuda. The identification of the four \"Autobiographical Songs\" is also unclear, although here and there in the autobi-ography Shabkar offers summaries of his life (for example, in chapters II and I5). 2. Pal Gyalkar ( I992) speaks of twenty-five major works.

According to some Hinayana treatises, meat-eating is tolerated to a certain extent, under the so-oilled \"three conditions\": 1) that one has not killed the animal oneself; 2) that one has not ordered its killing; 3) that it has not been purposely killed for one's own consumption. The Mahayana view understands that meat is sold purely because of consumer demand. There-fore, only the meat of animals who have died of natural or accidental causes is suitable to be eaten, a rare occurrence. In Mahayana sutras it is explained that applying the \"three conditions\" to oneself is a method that should result in one's becoming more aware and responsible, and thus help one to stop eating meat. It is not intended to suggest that, even though these \"three conditions\" may have been met, eating meat is suitable for a Buddhist practitioner."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"Appendix 6 Shabkar's disciples In Buddhist teachings, it is said that, just as bees swarm around a flower filled with nectar, dis-ciples will gather around a master replete with wisdom and compassion. 1bis was certainly the case with Shabkar, who inspired fervent devo-tion in the many disciples who flocked to him. Shabkar never changed his ascetic life-style, which was always that of a wandering renunciate. However, after his fame spread through Tibet, when he was walking from one holy place to another he would sometimes be followed by hun-dreds of disciples and beggars, and be awaited by thousands of people who came to see him pass-ing by and to seek his blessing. At the end of his autobiography Shabkar says, \"I had over one hundred great, learned and accomplished disciples who were mindful of the law of cause and effect, maintained pure disci-pline and had good hearts; who realized the natural state; who thoroughly assimilated the practices of the developing and completion stages and had visions of their yidam;who were aware of the happiness and the suffering of others, as well as their own good and bad qualities, and were thus able to benefit both the Dharma and sen-tient beings. \"I had over three hundred disciples who were practitioners trained in the Bodhicitta prac-tice of cherishing others more than themselves, were filled with compassion, and never ate meat. I had one thousand eight hundred dis-ciples-monks, nuns, and hermits-who, com-ing from all directions and all lands, lived in the mountains, kept pure vows and samayas, 589 and gave up all concern for the affairs of this life. \"Finally, I had countless disciples who were monks and nuns living in monasteries, disciples who worked hard at making offerings, prostra-tions, circumarnbulations, prayers, and recitations; village ngakpaswho practiced at recitation and medi-tation on the yidam deities; and laymen and women who took temporary vows and vows of fasting, and recited the moni.\" Only a small fraction of Shabkar's spiritual heirs are mentioned in his autobiography and in his other writings, such as the Collected Songs. It appears, from these texts, that Shabkar's chief disciples were Perna Rangdrol and Kalden Rangdrol in Amdo, andjimba Norbu in western Tibet. In his History of t1ze Great Monastery of Rongpo (RO, p. 646),Jigme Thekchog speaks of six main disciples by the name of Rangdrol: Kalden Rangdrol, Perna Rangdrol, Kunzang Rangdrol, Natsok Rangdrol, Gangshar Rangdrol, and Jamyang Rangdrol. (fhis enumeration, how-ever, refers to disciples from Amdo.) Shabkar's lineage has also been passed on through impor-tant disciples from central and western Tibet. A few details about Shabkar's main disciples are presented below. PEMA RANGDROL Perna Rangdrol, otherwise known as Sengzang Gyatso and Rigdzin Dawa, had also been a close disciple of the Dharma King Ngakyi Wangpo. Shabkar refers to him as \"great spiritual son\" (bu chen) or as ~'lord of the accomplished ones\" (grub"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"590 77ze Lift of Shabkar dbang), saying, \"The great spiritual son, Lama Perna Rangdrol, had received many instructions and empowerments from Chogyal Rinpoche ... I also gave him many transmissions, instructions, and much personal advice-although this was like using a butter-lamp to light up the daytime. Later, he went on to the Golden Valley of Rekong, and there, in the solitude of the heights of Tashikhyil, a place foretold by deities and gurus, he concentrated on practice for many years. In this way, he produced immeasurable benefit for the Dharma and for all sentient beings. The details can be found in his biography.\" 1 Throughout his life, in Amdo and in central Tibet, Perna Rangdrol visited Shabkar many times to receive his guidance .. When Perna Rangdrol died in 1837, Shabkar performed the funeral ceremonies and erected a stupa contain-ing the disciple's relics (see TS 2, pp. 183-84 and 202). Perna Rangdrol's reincarnation was born into the family of Alak Khandro and was active in the areas of K yamru and Kangtsa. KALDEN RANGDROL Kalden Rangdrol, also referred to in this autobi-ography as Lhundrup Rigdzin, was one of Shabkar's earliest and closest disciples. He ac-companied his teacher for most of his life, from -Amdo to Mount Kailash and Lapchi. Shabkar sent him to Nepal as his representative for the consecration of the newly gilded Great Stupa of Bodhnath (see chap. 13, fol. 369b) and speaks of him as \"great siddhd' and \"precious heart-son.\" It is to him that Shabkar sang his famous advice on compassion (chap. 13, fol. 365) that begins: Sky-yogin, endowed with realization, Fortunate son, your realization of emptiness Equals that of your father-This is wonderful indeed, 0 noble son! But your compassion, I think, Is not equal to his. In the same way that you meditated on emptiness, You should now meditate on compassion. On his way back to Amdo with Shabkar in 1828, Kalden Rangdrollost his life while search-ing for a ford in the Drichu River to save from starvation a hundred people who had been robbed byGolok bandits (see chap. 15, fol. 426b). KUNZANG RANGDROL Originally from Dzogeh in Amdo, Kunzang Rangdrol came to meditate near Shabkar at Tsonying Island. He also went to meet Shabkar in Tsari, and is often mentioned in the autobiog-raphy as one of Shabkar's closest disciples. In chapter 9, Shabkar says, \"After staying one year in central Tibet, he returned to Dorney. There he practiced the two stages of the Secret Mantrayana and the profound path of Chod, and became a realized sky-like yogin who brought delusion to an end.\" NATSOK RANGDROL This is Gurong Tulku Natsok Rangdrol, a figure who often appears in the second part ofShabkar's autobiography. He wrote 1he Crystal Mirror, an important guide to the Wish-fulfilling Gem, Hayagriva and Varahi (see Bibliography). GANGSHAR RANGDROL This could be the lama of whom Shabkar speaks in chap. 11, fol. 239a: \"In the summer, Lama Neten, who was from Marmig in the northern steppes and whose secret name was Gangshar Rangdrol, 'Self-liberation of Whatever Arises,' arrived at this sacred place. He had consciously taken rebirth for the sake of the nomads of the northern steppes who had neither protector nor refuge. \"In chap. 14, fol. 14a, Shabkar speaks of Gangshar Rangdrol as \"a close disciple of the precious and powerful siddha of the Great Perfec-tion,\" which presumably refers to Do Drupchen Jigme Trinley Oser (1745-1821). In his Beneficial Moon Shabkar also quotes extensively the songs of a Gangshar Rangdrol but gives no indications allowing identification of this author. ]AMY ANG RANGDROL In chapter 12, Shabkar, then staying at Kyirong, speaks ofjamyang Rangdrol as one of his close disciples. Later (see fol. 21 0), Shabkar also says, 'jamyang Rangdrol and a few others left to raise the victory banner of spiritual practice at the Snow Mountain of To ... \""},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"JIMBANORBU A detailed manuscript autobiography of Jimba Norbu is kept in Tarap, Dolpo, Nepal (see Bibli-ography). Shabkar's main disciple in western and central Tibet,Jimba Norbu entered Shepel Ling Monastery, in Purang, when he was ten years old and took novice vows from Jimba Dargye (sbyin pa dar rgyas). He then went to cen-tral Tibet and received full monastic ordination from the seventh Panchen Lama, Lobzang Tenpai Nyima (blo hzang bstan pa'i 7fYi ma, 1781-1854). He studied at Sera and then met the throne-holder of Ratreng (rwa sgreng khri chen), who gave him many teachings and initiations on Madhyamaka, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen, but soon passed away. Finally, at Mount Kailash, Jimba Norbu met Shabkar, who was to become his lifelong teacher, and remained near him for several years. When Shabkar went to Nepal, he sentJimba Norbu to Drosho (dro slwd) to do a three-year retreat. Following this, Shabkar entrustedJimba Norbu with the task of going to Nepal to gild the top of the Bodhnath stupa. After spending some more years with his master, Jimba Norbu accomplished the Tsari pilgrim-age. He came once more into Shabkar's pres-ence at Densathil, where the master gave him his fmal instructions before leaving for Amdo in 1828. Their fmal parting occurred near Ratreng. Jimba Norbu, in tears, compared Shabkar's departure to that of Guru Padmasambhava leav-ing Tibet for the southwest continent ofChamara. After spending some months in retreat, Jimba Norbu went to Draktsa Cave (brag rtsa phuiJ, Yeshe Tsogyal's cave in Drigung Terdrom in which Kunzang Dechen Gyalpo had revealed the terma of the Wishfu!filling Gem, Hqyagriva and Varahi. He then returned to western Tibet through Lodrak (where he visited the place where Lodrak Drupchen met Tsongkhapa) and Ralung. The autobiography ends abruptly after Jimba Norbu takes leave of the Panchen Lama at Tashi lhunpo and heads westward. Jimba Norbu already had disciples ofhis own when he was practicing and studying with Shabkar and he later became a charismatic teacher in western Tibet. His autobiography is rich in songs and teachings in prose, the style of which, clear and inspiring, is reminiscent ofShabkar's own. Appendix 6 591 Although his initial training was in the Geluk tradition, Jimba Norbu predominantly makes use of the style and vocabulary of the Dzogchen teachings of the Nyingma tradition. CHANGLUNG TULKU KHYAPDAL LONGYANG Changlung Tulku Khyapdal Longyang (spyang lung sprul sku khyab brdal klong yangs; see RO, p. 640-41; spelled Ieang lung in A C) was the reembocliment of Changlung Namkha Jigme (spyang lung nam mkha' Jigs med, 1769-1833) who founded the Garuda Monastery (khyung dgon, which is not to be confused with the large Gelukpa monastery of bya khyung, nearby in Dorney). N amkha Jigme traveled to central Tibet and Kham, where he received and transmitted Nyingma teachings, especially those of the Mindroling tradition, ofNyima Trakpa's termas, and of the I.nngchen Nyingthig cycle. It is said that when he recited the hundred-syllable mantra of Vajrasattva, the sound of his heartbeat became the same as the sound of the mantra and that the mantra could be heard resounding from his chest. According to H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, he was also a disciple of Do Drupchen Jigme Trinley Oser (17 45-1821 ). He became an accom-plished master of the Palchen Dupa practice from the limgchen Nyingtlzig and recited the man-tra of this yidam two hundred million times at one of the Eight Places of Accomplishment ofRekong. Shabkar wrote a biography of this master (see Pal Gyalkar 1993). Namkha Jigme had three immediate reincarnations, one in Kyung Gon (khyung dgon), one in Adarchaka (a dar chags ka) and one in Gurong (dgu rong, see RO, p. 642 and AC, vol. 2, p. 298). Khyapdal Longyang, the first of these three, was one of Shabkar's close disciples. He is often mentioned in the second part of the autobiography (fS 2) as NamkhaJigme Tulku or as Alak Namkha. Alak Namkha's reincarna-tion was a disciple ofJamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro (1893-1959), who also recognized the next incarnation. The present Alak Namkha is a respected teacher in the Rekong area. Among Shabkar's other eminent disciples are the following: Nyangkyi Tsampa, the \"Her-mit of Nyang,\" Lobzang Tenpai Nyima ('!Yang"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"592 Th£ Lifi of Shabkar mtshoms pablo bzang bstan pa'i 1!Ji ma, 1811-61), who was a learned and influential master in the Rekong area (see Author's Introduction, note 24); Chingkar Donyo Dmje, who considered himself to be Shabkar's disciple but was at the same time one of his teachers (see Appendix 2); Dragon Perna Gyatso, who was the teacher of the Shuksepjetsun, owing to whom the lineage of the Wtsh-fo!fi!Jing Gem, HayagrWa. and Varahi is still extant today (see Appendix 4); and Sangye Rinchen, a resident of T ashikhyil Hennitage, who copied and directed the calVing on wooden blocks of most ofShabkar's writings.

The Jowo Rinpoche (jo bo rin po che), or Jowo Shakyamuni, which is in the Jokhang, the main temple of lliasa (also known as rasa 'Phrul snanggtsug lag khang); and thejowo Mikyti Dorje (jo bo mi bslgod rdo rje), which is kept in the temple ofRamoche (ramo che). These statues, the most venerated in Tibet, were brought to Lhasa by the two wives of Songtsen Gampo, the Nepalese princess Bhrikuti (lha gcig khri btsun), who founded thejokhang, and the Chi-nese princess Wengchen Kungchu, who founded Ramoche.

Nagarjuna and Asanga, two among the Six Ornaments of the World. 'IWOFOID THOUGHT OF ENliGHTENMENT (!(yang chuh 1gi sems gnyis). Bodhicitta, the thought or mind of enlightenment, is defmed as the intention to achieve Buddhahood for the sake of all beings. It has two aspects, relative and abso-lute. The relative mind of enlightenment (kun rdzob byang chub 1gi sems) is itself divided into two steps: the wish to attain ultimate perfec-tion to become able to free all beings from suffering (smon pa'i sems bslged), and the entry into spiritual practice in order to actualize this wish (Jug pa'i sems bslged). The absolute mind of enlightenment (don dam byang chub 1gi sems) is the realization of emptiness and the recognition that the Buddha-nature abides in every sentient being. 'IWO TRUTHS ( bden pa gnyis). Absolute truth and relative truth. Absolute truth (don dam bden pa) is beyond concepts and defmitions.
