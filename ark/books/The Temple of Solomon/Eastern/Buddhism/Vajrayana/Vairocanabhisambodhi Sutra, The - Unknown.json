Thus his teachings were alwaysappropriate for the particular suffering individual and for the time at which theteaching was given, and over the ages not one of his prescriptions has failed torelieve the suffering to which it was addressed.Ever since the Buddha’s Great Demise over twenty-five hundred years ago,his message of wisdom and compassion has spread throughout the world. Yetno one has ever attempted to translate the entire Buddhist canon into Englishthroughout the history of Japan. It is my greatest wish to see this done and tomake the translations available to the many English-speaking people who havenever had the opportunity to learn about the Buddha’s teachings.Of course, it would be impossible to translate all of the Buddha’s eighty-four thousand teachings in a few years. I have, therefore, had one hundred thirty-nine of the scriptural texts in the prodigious Taishō edition of the Chinese Buddhistcanon selected for inclusion in the First Series of this translation project.It is in the nature of this undertaking that the results are bound to be criti-cized. Nonetheless, I am convinced that unless someone takes it upon himselfor herself to initiate this project, it will never be done. At the same time, I hopethat an improved, revised edition will appear in the future.It is most gratifying that, thanks to the efforts of more than a hundredBuddhist scholars from the East and the West, this monumental project hasfinally gotten off the ground.

Under his leadership, a special preparatorycommittee was organized in April 1982. By July of the same year, the Transla-tion Committee of the English Tripiṭaka was officially convened.The initial Committee consisted of the following members: (late) HANAYAMAShōyū (Chairperson), (late) BANDŌ Shōjun, ISHIGAMIZennō, (late) KAMATAShigeo, KANAOKAShūyū, MAYEDASengaku, NARA Yasuaki, (late) SAYEKIShinkō, (late) SHIOIRIRyōtatsu, TAMARUNoriyoshi, (late) TAMURAKwansei,URYŪZURyūshin, and YUYAMAAkira. Assistant members of the Committeewere as follows: KANAZAWAAtsushi, WATA NABEShōgo, Rolf Giebel of NewZealand, and Rudy Smet of Belgium.After holding planning meetings on a monthly basis, the Committee selectedone hundred thirty-nine texts for the First Series of translations, an estimatedone hundred printed volumes in all. The texts selected are not necessarily lim-ited to those originally written in India but also include works written or com-posed in China and Japan. While the publication of the First Series proceeds,the texts for the Second Series will be selected from among the remaining works;this process will continue until all the texts, in Japanese as well as in Chinese,have been published.Frankly speaking, it will take perhaps one hundred years or more to accom-plish the English translation of the complete Chinese and Japanese texts, forthey consist of thousands of works. Nevertheless, as Dr. NUMATAwished, it isthe sincere hope of the Committee that this project will continue unto comple-tion, even after all its present members have passed away.It must be mentioned here that the final object of this project is not aca-demic fulfillment but the transmission of the teaching of the Buddha to the whole world in order to create harmony and peace amonghumankind.

In India and Tibet it came to be classified as a Caryā Tantra, or “Prac-tice Tantra,” corresponding to the second category of what was to become inTibet the standard fourfold classification of Buddhist tantras, only to be even-tually superseded to a large degree by the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgrahaandthe large body of literature spawned by this latter text (corresponding to theYoga and Anuttarayoga Tantras). In East Asia, on the other hand, the Vairocanā -bhisaṃbodhi-sūtrahas remained together with the Sarvatathāgata tattva saṃgrahaone of the two basic texts of Esoteric Buddhism and could indeed be said tohave been the more influential of the two. (A translation of the Sarvatathāgata -tattva saṃgraha,under the title Adamantine Pinnacle Sutra,appears in the vol-ume Two Esoteric Sutras,Numata Center, 2001.)To date no manuscript of the original Sanskrit text of the Vairo canā bhi -saṃbodhi-sūtrahas been discovered (although a number of passages are eitherquoted in other Sanskrit works or preserved in Chinese transcription), but it wastranslated into Chinese (Taishō no. 848) and Tibetan (Peking no. 126). The San-skrit title preserved in the Tibetan translation is Mahāvairocanā bhisaṃbodhi -vikurvitā dhi ṣṭhāna-vaipulya sūtrendrarāja-nāma-dharmaparyāya(Dharma Dis-course Called “Mahāvairocana’s Enlightenment, Miracles, and Empowerment,”King of the Best of the Extensive Scriptures). The title of the Chinese version,on the other hand, may be translated as “Scripture of the Enlightenment, Super-natural Transformations, and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana,” but the Chi-nese commentary informs us that the full title included the words Mahāvaipulya -sūtrendra rāja, which tallies closely with the title preserved in the Tibetantranslation. (The term vaipulya-sūtra,or “extensive scripture,” is a commonxiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introductiondesignation of Mahayana sutras.) Buddhaguhya, its chief commentator in India,meanwhile, refers to it as a tantra, and Sanskrit texts generally cite it simply asVairo canābhisaṃbodhior Vairocanā bhisaṃbodhi-tantra.Since the Chinesetranslator Śubhā kara siṃha does not use the word tantra(and although it iswidely known as the Mahāvairocana-sūtra), it will hereafter be referred to asthe Vairo canā bhisaṃbodhi-sūtra.The Chinese translation was produced in seven fascicles by Śubhā kara -siṃha (637–735) and his Chinese disciple Yixing (683–727) in 724–5, appar-ently on the basis of a manuscript sent to China some decades earlier by theChinese monk Wuxing, who died in India in 674. Strictly speaking, it is onlythe first six fascicles in thirty-one chapters that correspond to the Vairocanābhi -saṃbodhi-sūtraproper, with Fascicle Seven (in five chapters) constituting a rit-ual manual that is preserved as a separate work in the Tibetan canon (Pekingno. 3488). The Tibetan translation, on the other hand, was produced almost acentury later in the early ninth century by Śīlendrabodhi and dPal-brtsegs, andin addition to the base text in twenty-nine chapters it includes a “ContinuationTantra” (Uttara-tantra) in seven chapters not found in the Chinese version. Itis evident that during the intervening period the text had undergone some reor-ganization, for Chapters XXVIII–XXX of the Chinese translation have becomeChapters VII–IX in the Tibetan translation and Chapters VI–VII and ChaptersXXVII and XXXI in the Chinese translation have been combined into singlechapters in the Tibetan translation (becoming Chapters VI and XXIX respec-tively), while the order of Chapters XIII and XIV has been reversed (becom-ing Chapters XVI and XV in the Tibetan translation). But apart from these for-mal differences, the Chinese and Tibetan versions of the base text tally fairlyclosely with one another.As well as translating the Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra,Śubhā karasiṃhaand Yixing also produced a twenty-fascicle commentary (Taishō no. 1796) onthe first six fascicles of their translation. (In the notes added to the English trans-lation, this text is referred to as the “Chinese commentary.”) After Yixing’sdeath in 727, this was revised by some of his colleagues and redivided into four-teen fascicles. In addition, the Korean monk Bukesiyi, another of Śubhā -karasiṃha’s disciples, composed a two-fascicle commentary on the final sev-enth fascicle of the Chinese version of the Vairocanā bhisaṃbodhi-sūtra(Taishōno. 1797). The Chinese canon also preserves a separate, somewhat abridgedxiv"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introductionversion of the ritual manual constituting Fascicle Seven (Taishō no. 849), thetranslation of which is attributed to Bodhi vajra (i.e., Vajrabodhi [671–741]),although this attribution is questionable. It is interesting to note that just as thereexist two versions of Śubhākarasiṃha’s and Yixing’s commentary, so too arethere an unrevised version and revised version of the Tibetan translation of Buddha -guhya’s commentary (Peking nos. 3487 and 3490), which is thought to havebeen originally composed sometime around 760. Buddha guhya also wrote acondensed commentary on the Vairocanā bhisaṃbodhi-sūtra(Peking no. 3486). The Chinese canon further contains four lengthy ritual manuals associatedwith the Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra(Taishō nos. 850–3), as well as severalshorter ones, and there subsequently developed in Japan a vast corpus of com-mentarial literature (not to mention a subcommentary by eleventh-centuryJueyuan of the Liao dynasty). This exegetical activity has continued down tothe present day, and there now exists a large body of scholarly research on theVairo canā bhisaṃbodhi-sūtra,albeit largely in Japanese. The chief publicationsin Western languages are listed in the Bibliography (p. 291).ContentsFor the most part, the Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtratakes the form of a dialoguebetween Vajrapāṇi and the Buddha Vairocana. Vajra pāṇi begins in Chapter I byasking the Buddha how he obtained “the knowledge of an omniscient one” (sar -vajña jñāna), or perfect enlightenment, and what its cause (hetu), root (mūla),and culmination or final outcome (paryavasāna) are, to which the Buddhareplies, “The bodhi-mind (bodhicitta) is its cause, compassion (karuṇā) is itsroot, and expedient means (upāya) is its culmination.” These three propositionsare considered to encapsulate the essence of the entire sutra, and the rest of theVairo canābhisaṃbodhi-sūtracould be regarded as an elaboration of their var-ious ramifications.The remainder of Chapter I deals in particular with the bodhi-mind in itstwin aspects of the aspiration for enlightenment and the mind whose intrinsicnature is enlightenment. This is the most theoretical portion of the sutra, differ-ing little from a standard Mahayana sutra, and it also describes some traditionalMahayana methods for observing the nature of the mind. The remaining chap-ters of the sutra proper then go on to deal in detail with various practices that aremore specifically “Tantric” in character, and these include the construction of axv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introductionmaṇḍala,initiation rites, mantra recitation, ritual hand gestures or “seals”(mudrās), and visualization techniques. There is also a chapter on the ten pre-cepts, common to most forms of Buddhism.As regards the maṇḍala,it might be noted that the Vairocanā bhisaṃbodhi-sūtradescribes three forms of the main maṇḍala,the full name of which is“MaṇḍalaBorn of the Matrix of Great Compassion” (*Mahākaruṇā garbhod -bhava-maṇḍala): in the maṇḍala described in Chapter II the deities are repre-sented by their physical forms, in Chapter VIII by their seed-syllables, and inChapter XI by their symbolic objects, and there are also some differences in thelayout of the maṇḍalaas well. Originally the maṇḍalawould have generallybeen laid out on the ground in a specially prepared site for the purposes of ini-tiation, rather than being drawn on cloth or paper, as later became the norm inEast Asia, but pictorial representations preserved in Tibet, with one hundredand twenty-two deities, follow the description given in Chapter II fairly closely.In China, on the other hand, several versions developed, starting with thatdescribed in the Chinese commentary, an enormous maṇḍalaof four hundredand eighty-four deities (or more than seven hundred if one includes the atten-dant deities). The form most prevalent in Japan today, with more than four hun-dred deities, is thought to have originated in China in the late eighth centuryand was first introduced to Japan by Kūkai (774–835) in 806. The author(s) of the Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtraclearly drew on a num-ber of earlier works, and it is perhaps partly for this reason that there is someduplication in the content of some of the chapters. It is therefore fortunate thata ritual manual has been appended to the Chinese translation of the sutra proper,for this shows how the various practices described in the Vairocanābhisaṃ-bodhi-sūtrawere integrated both into a coherent whole and into the daily lifeof the practitioner. Taken as a whole, the Chinese translation of the Vairo canā -bhisaṃbodhi-sūtrathus provides an excellent overall picture of the theory andpractice of Indian Tantric Buddhism in the mid- to late seventh century. A Note on the TranslationIn the English translation presented here, the aim has been to be as faithful aspossible to the Chinese translation as preserved in the Taishō edition (vol. 18,no. 848), which means that when Śubhā kara siṃha and Yixing translate, I gen-erally also translate, and when they transliterate, I generally also transliterate.xvi"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Translator’s IntroductionThere are several exceptions to this, one being the treatment of proper nouns,for which, on account of their large number, only the Sanskrit form is given,even though they are usually translated into Chinese in the original.In accordance with the editorial policy of this translation series, the noteshave in the main been confined to points having a direct bearing on the inter-pretation of the text, and no attempt has been made to point out differencesbetween the Chinese and Tibetan translations or differences of interpretationbetween the Chinese and Indo-Tibetan commentaries.

These were not produced by the body or speech or mindof the Buddha Vairocana, and the limits of their arising and disappearing inall places cannot be apprehended. Yet all the actions of Vairocana’s body,all the actions of his speech, and all the actions of his mind proclaim every-where and always in the realms of sentient beings the Dharma of the wordsof the mantra path.

And yet this path of theknowledge of an omniscient one is of one taste, namely, the taste of the Tathā-gata’s liberation.“World-honored One, just as, for example, the element of empty spaceis free from all differentiation, without differentiation and without nondif-ferentiation, so too is the knowledge of an omniscient one free from all dif-ferentiation, without differentiation and without nondifferentiation. World-honored One, just as, for example, the great earth is the support of all beings,so too is the knowledge of an omniscient one the support of gods, humans,and asuras.

Youshould listen attentively and pay very careful attention as I now explain it.”Vajrapāṇi said, “So be it, World-honored One.

Next, Lord of Mysteries, theyobserve the precepts so as to be born in heaven: this represents the seventh[stage of] taking in seeds.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, as they transmigrate through birth-and-deathwith this mind [of the seventh stage], they hear the following words from agood friend: ‘This is a god, a great god, who bestows all happiness. If youworship him with devotion, all your wishes will be fulfilled.

That is to say, having thus understood that there are onlythe [five] aggregates and no-self, one lingers on in cultivation [associatedwith] the [six] sense organs, [six] sense objects, and [six] elements (i.e., sixconsciousnesses), pulls out the stumps of karma and mental afflictions andthe seeds of ignorance whence are born the twelve causes and conditions [ofdependent arising], and dissociates oneself from the schools of established[purity] and so on. Such deep serenity cannot be known by any non-Buddhists,and previous buddhas have proclaimed it to be free from all faults.“Lord of Mysteries, with this supramundane mind dwelling in the [five]aggregates, such wisdom may arise correspondingly. If one is to give rise tofreedom from attachment to the aggregates, one should observe foam, bub-bles, a plantain tree, a mirage, and an illusion, thereby attaining liberation.That is to say, the [five] aggregates, [twelve] sense fields, [eighteen] ele-ments, and the grasper and the grasped are all removed from Dharma-nature,and when one realizes the realm of quiescence in this manner, it is called thesupramundane mind. Lord of Mysteries, when one has left behind the sequenceof eight minds incompatible and compatible [with the world]12and the webof karma and mental afflictions, this represents the yogin’s practice for tran-scending one eon.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, there is the practice of the Great Vehicle,whereby one generates the mind of the vehicle without any object [of cog-nition] and [understands] that dharmas have no self-nature. How? Just likethose who practiced thus in former times, one observes the ālaya(substra-tum) of the aggregates and realizes that its own-nature is like an illusion, amirage, a reflection, an echo, a whirling wheel of fire, and an [imaginary]gandharvacity. Lord of Mysteries, if one thus abandons no-self [in dhar-mas], the mind-lord being absolutely free, one awakens to the fact that one’sown mind is originally unborn. Why? Because, Lord of Mysteries, the ante-rior and posterior limits of the mind cannot be apprehended. When one thusknows the nature of one’s own mind, this represents the yogin’s practice fortranscending a second eon.133b"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sutra“Next, Lord of Mysteries, bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practicesvia the gateway of mantras accomplish all the immeasurable merit and knowl-edge accumulated during immeasurable and incalculable hundreds of thou-sands of koṭis of nayutas of eons and all the immeasurable wisdom and expe-dient means for fully cultivating all practices; they become a refuge for theworlds of gods and humans, they transcend the stages of all śrāvakas andpratyeka buddhas, and they are attended and revered by Śakra Deven dra(King of Gods) and so on.

The world will venerate [such a person] and should alwaysmake offerings to him.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, in the stage of practice with faith-and-under-standing one observes the three minds,13the vision of wisdom [based on]immeasurable pāramitās, and the four means of conversion. The stage offaith-and-understanding is unparalleled, immeasurable, and inconceivable,and [in it] one establishes the ten minds14and boundless knowledge is born.Everything whatsoever that I have taught is all obtained on the basis of this[stage].

Why? Because their originalnature is pure. In the same way illusions [produced by] mantras are able toproduce anything through success in recitation.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, a mirage is by nature empty; it is in depend-ence on the false notions of worldlings that it is established and may be spo-ken about.

You have done well to speak these words.In keeping with the questions in your mind, I shall now reveal everything.Obstructors are born from one’s own mind in accordance with past avarice.In order to remove their cause, one thinks on the bodhi-mind,Which is well removed of false differentiation born from the mind and thought,And by recollecting the bodhi-mind, the practitioner will be free from faults.One should always think in one’s mind of the mahāsattvaAcalaAnd bind his mystic seal, whereby one will be able to remove all obstructions.Lord of Mysteries, listen further how to tie down turbulent wind.

He visualizes an effigy [of the obstacle] with [Acala’s or his own] left foot placed on its head:The obstacle will be eliminated and extinguished, not to arise [again].Alternatively, having carefully mixed [poison] with rājikā(black mustard),The practitioner makes an effigy [of the obstacle] and smears its body with [the mixture]:Those [obstacles] who seize one will, on account of this antidote,Have their sense organs scorched—about this one must not engenderany doubting thoughts.Even the honored ones Śakra and Brahmā, should they not follow my teaching,Will be burned, not to mention other beings.”13c"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Fascicle Two57Thereupon Vajrapāṇi said to the Buddha, “World-honored One, insofaras I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, I too thus knowthat, dwelling in their own maṇḍalastations, the holy deities bring aboutwhat is awe-inspiring. Because they dwell in this manner, the Tathāgata’sinjunctions cannot be obfuscated. Why? Because, World-honored One, thesamayaof all mantras is to abide in their own lineage. Therefore, bodhi-sattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras shouldalso dwell in their proper station and perform [ritual] deeds.”[The Bhagavān said, “Lord of Mysteries, it is so, it is as you have said.]40Moreover, Lord of Mysteries, if colors have been mentioned [for any deities],you should know that the holy deities’ maṇḍalastations and the deities’figures are also the same [colors]: this has been taught by previous buddhas. “Lord of Mysteries, in future ages beings of inferior intelligence and nofaith will, on hearing these explanations, be unable to accept them on faithbecause they have no intelligence, and their doubts will increase. If theymerely hear them and remain set in their ways without practicing, they willharm themselves and harm others, and they will make statements such as‘Non-Buddhists have such methods, but they were not taught by the Buddha.’These ignorant people will produce such faith-and-understanding.”Then the World-honored [One] spoke these verses:The omniscient World-honored One has gained sovereignty over dharmas,And in accordance with what he has mastered, he delivers beingsby expedient means.This was taught by previous buddhas to bring benefit to those who seek the Dharma.The foolish person does not know the characteristic of the dharmas [as taught] by the buddhas:I have taught that the characteristic possessed by all dharmas is that they are all empty.One should always dwell in mantras and be sure to act with resolve.14a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"59Chapter IVA Treasury of Mantrasin Common UseThereupon the vajradharas, with the Lord of Mysteries at their head, andthe host of bodhisattvas, with Samantabhadra at their head, bowed down tothe Buddha Vairocana and, out of a desire to expound in this great king ofmaṇḍalas “Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion” the Dharma-phrasesof their mantras, [each] in accordance with the pure gateway to the Dharmarealm that they had mastered, they appealed each in his own words to theWorld-honored One [for permission to do so].

Why? It would not be proper for us ourselvesto proclaim in the presence of the Honored Bhagavān the Dharma as mas-tered by each of us. Verily, World-honored One, it is only because we wishfor the weal and happiness of future beings.”Thereupon the Bhagavān Vairocana addressed all the vajra dharas, say-ing, “Excellent, excellent, good sirs!

Tathāgata.That which is called the second gives rise to the performance of many [ritual] deeds.The third is conferred by the mind and is completelydissociated from time and place;In order to please the honored [ācārya], one should perform it as explained,And one will be consecrated directly by the Buddha: this is themost excellent.The Perfectly Awakened One has explained in brief five kindsof samaya.The first is possessing the samayaon seeing a maṇḍala;Words of truth (i.e., mantras) are not yet transmitted, nor are mystic seals conferred.The second samayais entering and looking at the assembly ofholy divinities.In the third, complete with altar and seals, one practices wondrous actions in accordance with the teachings.Next, [the ācāryagrants] permission to transmit the teachings, and this is described as possessing the [fourth] samaya.Although one may possess [knowledge of] seals and the positions [of the deities] in the altar as explained in the teachings,So long as one has not obtained the consecration of the mind,secret wisdom does not arise.Therefore, in the center of the secret ritual site the mantrin,Possessing the fifth pledge (samaya), should be consecrated in accordance with the rules.13233b"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Fascicle FiveOne should know that anything other than this is not called samaya.If, well abiding [in the precepts] and meditating on the mind,the mantrinawakens to the mindWithout apprehending the three loci,89he is described as a bodhisattva.Having attained the practice of meditating without any object, he benefits beings with expedient meansIn order to plant the roots of goodness, and therefore he is called honored among humans.In dharmas originally quiescent and always without own-nature,He rests like [Mount] Sume[ru]: this is called seeing the truth.This emptiness corresponds to the apex of reality, and it is notfalse words;What is seen [by him] is like [that which is seen by] the Buddha, and previous buddhas have [also] seen thus.The siddhiof attaining the bodhi-mind is quite unsurpassed;Apart from this, there is a fivefold distinction among the siddhis:That is to say, entry into the cultivation of practice, advancing up through the stages,The five mundane supernatural faculties, [the state of] buddhas,and [the state of] pratyekabuddhas and so on.If one practices unceasingly until the continuum of the mind is pure,Causing that which has not yet matured to maturate, it is then that siddhiis accomplished.In that single moment of time, pure action and the mind are both identical,And the mantrinwill achieve the arising of siddhiat will:He ascends into the sky through siddhilike one who is unafraidof illusions;His ensorcellments by means of the net of magical arts are like Indra’s net;Just like all the people in a gandharvacity (i.e., mirage), So too is the secrecy (i.e., invisibility) of his body, being neitherof the body nor of consciousness.Again, just as in a dream while asleep one may visit the palacesof the gods133"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sutra134Without forsaking this body and without [actually] going there,So too in yogic dreams, for him who

down as desired without any thoughts of differentiation.Just as empty space in the ten directions is dissociated fromconditioned formations,So too is the mantrinundefiled by any differentiated formations.Realizing that there is only thought, he observes everything inthis manner,And then the mantrinrejoices together with the buddhas.The Perfectly Awakened One, honored among two-legged beings, has described two kinds of homa,That is to say, internal and external, and increasing the potency [of offerings] is also like this.Having examined the special types and natures of the deities, one should recognize them.I shall now explain the limited measure of the mantras of mundane [gods].In the case of heavenly divinities known by many, such as the blessed Īśvara,The spells uttered by them, as well as the seals of the verypowerful ones,All have results in the present world, and therefore it is taught that they have a certain measure.Even though [results] are accomplished, they are not enduring and are all characterized by birth and extinction.Mantras of the supramundane are unproduced and originally unborn;Karma and [re]birth are completely severed, and, victorious, they are dissociated from the three faults.90I shall [now] explain the measure of the mantras of unicornlike [pratyekabuddhas,] without a teacher,And of the multitudes of the Buddha’s śrāvakas and of bodhisattvas:They transcend the three ages and arise from many conditions,33c"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Fascicle Five135And their results, visible and invisible, are born of mind, speech, and

and of the multitudes of the Buddha’s sonsAre pure and dissociated from thought; those that are associated with thought are mundane.In the acquisition of results through action, there is maturation

the course of transmigration through birth-and-death.”When he had finished speaking thus, the World-honored One Vairocanagazed upon the entire Dharma realm with the eyes of a Tathāgata andaddressed

I shall now explain the path of skillful practice. If a bodhisattvaand mahāsattvaabides in this, he will gain mastery of the Great Vehicle.Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not taking life, whichshould not be done; he keeps [the precepts against] the taking of what is notgiven, sexual misconduct, mendacious speech, harsh speech, slanderousspeech, meaningless speech,115covetousness, anger, and wrong views, in allof which he should not engage. Lord of Mysteries, this basis of training thebodhisattva practices in accordance with the training in the same way as dothe perfectly awakened World-honored Ones and bodhisattvas; in this man-ner should he train.”Then the vajradharaLord of Mysteries said to the Buddha, “The World-honored Bhagavān has also explained this path of ten wholesome actions forthe śrāvakavehicle, and people in the world at large and non-Buddhists too16539a"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sutraare always desirous of cultivating the path of ten wholesome actions.

Itis indeed excellent that you have asked the Tathāgata about this matter. Lordof Mysteries, you should listen attentively as I now explain the Dharma gate-way of the different paths and the one path. Lord of Mysteries, in the caseof the code of training for the śrāvakavehicle, [though] I have taught it, itis divorced from wisdom and expedient means, enjoins the achievement [ofmorality], fosters [one-]sided knowledge, and is not the same as practicingthe path of ten wholesome actions. World[ling]s, furthermore, because theyare divorced from attachment to the [petty] self, are subject to another cause(i.e., the divine self). The bodhisattva[, on the other hand,] cultivates theGreat Vehicle, enters the equality of all dharmas, and embraces wisdom andexpedient means, and his actions unfold for the sake of both himself and oth-ers. Therefore, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva here takes hold of wis-dom and expedient means, enters the equality of all dharmas, and should bediligent in his training.”Then the World-honored One again gazed upon the realms of beingswith eyes of great compassion and addressed the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, say-ing, “Lord of Mysteries, those bodhisattvas keep the precept of not takinglife for as long as they live. They should forsake the sword and the rod, befree from murderous intent, and guard the life of another as if it were theirown. There is [also] another expedient means: in order to liberate some kindsof beings from retribution for evil deeds in accordance with their deeds, [thetaking of life] is [on occasion] carried out, but without thoughts of enmityor animosity.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva keeps the precept against tak-ing what is not given. With regard to possessions belonging to others, hedoes not give rise to thoughts of touching or taking them, let alone takingother things that are not given. There is [also] another expedient means: ifhe sees beings who are miserly, hoard things, and do not cultivate the meritof giving, then, according to their kind, and in order to counter their miser-liness, he performs [the act of] giving on their behalf, free from [thoughts16639b"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Fascicle Six167of] self and other. Therefore, when praising [the act of giving, he says that]if one gives, one will acquire a fine appearance and so on. Lord of Myster-ies, if a bodhisattva engenders thoughts of covetousness and touches or takes[what is not given], this bodhisattva will fall back from the factors conduciveto bodhiand violate the unconditioned Vinaya rules.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not com-mitting adultery. In the case of [wives] belonging to others, his own wife,[women of] his own clan, and [women] protected by a [religious] sign, hedoes not engender thoughts of covetousness, let alone engage in improperphysical intercourse. There is [also] another expedient means: in accordancewith those who ought to be delivered, he may [perform such acts in orderto] safeguard beings.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not lyingfor as long as he lives. Even for the sake of saving his life, he should not lie,for this would betray the buddhas’ bodhi.Lord of Mysteries, this is called thebodhisattva’s abiding in the supreme Great Vehicle. If one lies, one violatesthe dharmaof the Buddha’s bodhi.Therefore, Lord of Mysteries, you shouldknow this Dharma gateway in this manner and renounce untruthful speech.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva observes the precept of notengaging in harsh abuse. He should embrace beings with the speech of gen-tle thoughts and with words that are appropriate. Why? Lord of Mysteries,the first practice of the bodhisattva is to bring benefit and happiness to beings.Alternatively, another bodhisattva, seeing someone dwelling in a cause of[rebirth in] an evil destiny, may exhibit harsh speech in order to confute him.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva observes the precept of notusing speech that causes discord; he dissociates himself from divisive speechand dissociates himself from hurtful speech. He who violates [this precept]is not called a bodhisattva, who does not cause thoughts of dissension amongbeings. There is [also] a different expedient means: if those beings produceattachment in accordance with their [wrong] viewpoints, he will utter divi-sive speech according to their kind and [so] make them abide in the one path,that is to say, the path to the knowledge of an omniscient one.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not engag-ing in idle talk. With appropriate words and conforming to time and place,he produces benefits, causes all beings to engender thoughts of joy, and39c"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sutrapurifies the path of the organ of hearing.

Although he utters much meaningless speech, sucha bodhisattva is not attached to transmigration through birth-and-death.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva should keep the precept ofnon-covetousness. He does not give rise to defiled thoughts toward another’sthings of which he makes use. Why? Because there is no bodhisattva whoproduces thoughts of attachment. If a bodhisattva’s mind has defiled thoughts,he will become powerless at the gateway to omniscience and will fall to oneside. Again, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva should engender joy and pro-duce the thought, ‘It is most excellent that whatever I must do is made to bedone spontaneously,’ repeatedly feeling happy for himself, for he must notcause beings to lose their property.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva should keep the precept ofnon-anger. In all circumstances he always cultivates tolerance and is notattached to anger or joy, and his mind operates equably toward foe and kin.Why? A bodhisattva does not harbor ill-will. Why is that? Because the bodhi-sattva is by his original nature pure. Therefore, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhi-sattva should keep the precept of non-anger.“Next, Lord of Mysteries, the bodhisattva should abandon wrong views.He practices right views, fears the otherworld, and is without animosity, with-out deceit, and without trickery; his mind is upright, and his mind has becomefixed upon the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Therefore, Lord of Mysteries,wrong views are deemed to be the very greatest of faults, they cut off all thebodhisattva’s roots of goodness, and they are regarded as the mother of allunwholesome dharmas. Hence, Lord of Mysteries, one should not give riseto the causes and conditions of wrong views, even in jest.”Then the vajradharaLord of Mysteries said to the Buddha, “World-hon-ored One, I beg you to explain the cutting off whereby the precepts of thepath of ten wholesome [actions] cut off the ultimate roots [of unwholesomeactions].

What are [these] two? They are the householder andthe renunciant.“Lord of Mysteries, the householder bodhisattva observes the five basesof the precepts, acts freely in positions of power, conforms to time and placewith the path of various expedient means, acts freely to embrace [beings],and seeks [the knowledge of] an omniscient one.

On reaching the middle watch of the night, don adaman-tine armor with the action-vajra164as before and pay reverence to all thebuddhas and great bodhisattvas. Then you should make offerings with themind according to the rules and form this thought: “Because I seek after thecauses and conditions of the most important thing (i.e., enlightenment) forthe sake of all beings, I shall sleep for a short while out of solicitude for thisbody. It is not because of craving for the pleasures of sleep.” First you shouldarrange your physical posture and lie down on your right side with both feetplaced one on top of the other. Should your limbs become tired, you mayturn over as you please without offense. In order to make yourself wake upquickly, you should always fix your mind on something bright.165Moreover,you should not lie down on a bed.Next, on other days too practice in this manner. The mantrin,by notneglecting the rules and practicing diligently without interruption, gains thedesignation of one who cultivates bodhisattva practices via the gateway ofmantras. If, in rites of recitation with the number [of recitations], times, man-ifestation of signs, and so on [specified], you perform the preliminary expe-dient means and practice in full the special actions, but are nonetheless unsuc-cessful, you should admonish yourself and redouble your efforts; do notengender thoughts of inferiority and say, “This method is not suitable forme.” In this manner you develop willpower, benefit yourself and benefit oth-ers, and never spend your time in vain. Because the practitioner is assidu-ous and never rests, the holy ones mystically illuminate his mind, where-upon he experiences the establishment of awesome divinity and gains freedomfrom obstacles.In this there are two things that you should not forsake. Namely, youshould not forsake the buddhas and bodhisattvas, nor the thought of bring-ing benefit to inexhaustible beings.

But because in the Chinese commentary thisdesignation is interpreted in connection with the three mysteries of body, speech, andmind and Vajrapāṇi is said to bear this title because “he is lord of the mystery of themind,” the translation “Lord of Mysteries” has been adopted. In addition, it should benoted that the reconstructions of the Sanskrit names of the vajradharas are for themost part tentative, and they have been variously reconstructed by different scholars.3Among the twenty-nine erroneous views of the self listed here, “the measure of man”corresponds to puruṣa(“[primeval] man” or “spirit”), “the completely adorned” toeither prabhuor vibhu(“lord”), and “life-force” to jīva(“life [principle]” or “soul”);“mind-born” (manoja) is a common mistranslation of manuja(“born from Manu”),while “youngster” (māṇava) is a mistranslation of mānava(“descended from Manu”);and jñatvamshould possibly read jñātavya(“that which is to be known”). 4The six days of abstinence are the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month.5Many of the names of gods both here and elsewhere in the text are accompanied by theword “god” (deva), but hereafter this has generally been omitted in the translation.6In the Tibetan translation the eighth stage is called “that which has become strength,”presumably meaning that the fruit of the previous stage, which, according to theTibetan translation, was ingested to provide nourishment, has been converted intophysical strength. This sits better with the extended analogy of a seed, and it wouldsuggest that there was some scribal confusion between bala(“strength”) and bāla(“[male] child”). 7Added on the basis of the Tibetan translation and Chinese commentary.8Added on the basis of the Tibetan translation and Chinese commentary. After this“mind of mud,” the Tibetan translation adds “mind of mire.”9Because the Chinese text lists only fifty-nine minds (having omitted the “mind ofmire” mentioned in the Tibetan translation), the Chinese commentary adds a sixti-eth, “mind of the monkey.” 251"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Notes10According to the Chinese commentary, it is the five basic mental afflictions—greed,anger, stupidity, pride, and doubt—that are doubled five times to give a total of onehundred and sixty minds (5 x 2 = 10, 10 x 2 = 20, 20 x 2 = 40, 40 x 2 = 80, and 80 x2 = 160). Buddhaguhya, on the other hand, presents a complicated system of calcu-lation to derive the one hundred and sixty minds from the sixty minds that have justbeen described. 11In the Chinese translation kalpa(“eon”) has been interpreted as vikalpa(“[false] dis-crimination”), and according to the Chinese commentary, “transcending the mun-dane three false attachments” means to eradicate three levels of attachment (gross,subtle, and very subtle). According to the Tibetan translation, on the other hand, “theone hundred and sixty mundane minds are transcended in three eons.”12According to the Chinese commentary, the “eight minds compatible [with the world]”are the eight stages through which an ordinary person passes, described earlier, whilethe “eight minds incompatible [with the world]” are eight further stages leading upto the pulling out of the stumps of karma and mental afflictions and the seeds of igno-rance mentioned just above. 13According to the Chinese commentary, the “three minds” correspond to the mindsof the cause (hetu), root (mūla), and culmination (paryavasāna).14The Chinese commentary explains the “ten minds” with reference to ten minds men-tioned in the Avataṃsaka-sūtraand also in terms of the eight stages mentioned ear-lier.15I.e., one further quarter of an eon is needed to reach full enlightenment.16Or possibly “rapids” or “the confluence of a river.”17Other versions of this mantra have samantānugate(“all-pervading one!”) for samatā -nugate,while the Tibetan has gaganasamatānugate(“attained equality with the sky!”)for gaganasame samatānugate.Throughout the text there are many discrepancies,usually minor, between the mantras given in the Chinese and Tibetan translations,but these differences have generally not been noted. 18The Tibetan translation and Buddhaguhya’s commentary imply that Vairocana wearsa crown on top of his topknot, but according to the Chinese commentary his topknotresembles a crown, and the corresponding phrase (jaṭā-mukuṭa) has been translatedin this latter sense throughout. Iconographical evidence suggests that both interpre-tations were current in India.19According to the Chinese commentary, this refers to an area between Acalanātha andTrailokyavijaya (to the west of the central deity).20“Most excellent vow” corresponds to Sanskrit vara,which can mean either “(most)excellent” or “request, gift,” and here means simply “excellent” and qualifies “path.”In the Chinese translation its two meanings are often conflated as “(most) excellentvow,” but hereafter when the Sanskrit or the Tibetan indicates that the sense of “vow”is out of place, it has usually been translated simply as “(most) excellent.” 21The designations “initial quarter,” etc., for the four directions are literal translationsof the Sanskrit equivalents.252"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Notes22This possibly refers to a path for circumambulation.23Also aṅgula.A unit of measurement equal to a finger’s breadth and sometimes ren-dered in the Chinese as “finger” or “phalanx.”24Or possibly, following the Tibetan “sign of the buddhas,” “seal of all omniscientones.”25Or possibly an ear of millet (priyaṅgu).26Or, judging from the Tibetan translation and according to Buddhaguhya, Pāṇḍara -vāsinī.27The text has vidyādhararāja(“king of spell-holders”).28Following the Chinese commentary, this could also be taken to mean that it is thevajrathat “gives out blazing light all around.”29The Tibetan translation and extant exemplars of the maṇḍalawould suggest that “ini-tial quarter” here refers to the northern quarter rather than to the eastern quarter. 30The Chinese has “Gemmed Palm,” which suggests Ratnakara (cf. note 99).31According to the Chinese commentary, Indra composed a grammatical treatise inwhich he incorporated multiple meanings into a single syllable.32Presumably phaṭ+ aka,with -akabeing a common suffix. “Phaṭaka”would thenmean something like “[a mantra] with [the word] phaṭ.”33The Chinese equivalent musuusually refers to Medicago sativa(lucerne), but it isalso used as a translation of Sanskrit spṛkkā(Trigonella corni cu lata).34Sanskrit anusvāra:a small circle or dot that is placed over a letter to indicate nasal-ization of the vowel.

Withregard to other seals too described in this chapter, there are discrepancies betweenthe Chinese and Tibetan translations and the Chinese commentary (Buddhaguhyagenerally does not comment on the seals themselves), but these have not been noted.76The text has “lotus flower of the auspicious vow” (or “auspicious lotus flower of thevow”), but it is evident from the Tibetan translation that “vow” is an abbreviation of"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Notes“excellent vow,” corresponding to vara,and it has therefore been translated as “excel-lent.” Cf. note 20.77Ūrṇākośarefers to the circle of hair between the eyebrows of a buddha and is countedas one of the thirty-two chief distinguishing marks of a buddha.78The mantra for this seal is missing in the Chinese translation, but it is given in theTibetan translation: Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ, pracaṇḍa vajrajvāla visphura hūṃ(cf. mantra 18). 79Or possibly “great source of manifold knowledge!”80ºvācaṃ samatāprāptawould seem to be corrupt and differs considerably from theTibetan transcription (which is also problematic).81In light of the Tibetan transcription and also the following mantra, dayā jñānaṃshouldperhaps be regarded as a corruption of chedayājñānaṃ(“sever ignorance!”).82The text has ratnanirjita(“O you who have been conquered by a jewel!”) for ratna -nirjāta,but the Chinese commentary interprets it in the sense of ratnanirjāta,andthe Tibetan transcription has ratnanirjāte.83There appears to be some confusion in the Chinese translation regarding the follow-ing group of seals and mantras for the attendants of Ākāśa garbha. According to theTibetan translation, this first seal and mantra are for Ākāśagarbha, which would seemlogical, since the other groups of seals and mantras are headed by the seal and mantraof the chief deity of the group. Meanwhile, the seal and mantra assigned below to Sthi-ramati are, according to the Tibetan translation, those of Gaganāmala, and these arein the Tibetan translation followed by a seal and mantra for Sthiramati not given inthe Chinese translation; the mantra is: Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ, vajrakāra svāhā.84According to the Tibetan translation and Chinese commentary, this is the seal of Dur-dharṣa, which is also corroborated by the mantra.85The subject of the initial verb “produce” is not specified in the text, but according tothe Chinese commentary it is the letter A.86According to the Chinese commentary, the vajracircle is square and yellow (cf. note61), the water circle circular and white, the fire circle triangular and red, and the windcircle semilunar and black, and they are associated with the letters A, Va, Ra,and Harespectively. 87The text has vidyādhararāja(cf. note 27).

The five series of consonants are the gutturals or velars (ka, kha, ga, gha,andṅa), the palatals (ca, cha, ja, jha,and ña), the cerebrals or retroflexes (ṭa, ṭha, ḍa,ḍha,and ṇa), the dentals (ta, tha, da, dha,and na), and the labials (pa, pha, ba, bha,and ma), and each of these twenty-five letters takes the following four forms: short(-a), long (-ā), aspirated (-aḥ), and nasalized (-aṃ). These hundred letters are all saidto be encapsulated in the letter Aṃ,which is the actual focus of this and the follow-ing four chapters.118According to the Chinese commentary, the “three dharmas” are principle, practice,and result.
