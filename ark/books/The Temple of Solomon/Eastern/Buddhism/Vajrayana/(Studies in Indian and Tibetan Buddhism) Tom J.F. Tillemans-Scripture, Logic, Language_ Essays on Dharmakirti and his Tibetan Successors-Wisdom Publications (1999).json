This series was conceivedto provide a forum for publishing outstanding new contributionsto scholarship and also to make accessible seminal research not widelyknown outside a narrow specialist audience. Wisdom also intends to in-clude in the series appropriate monographs and collected articles trans-lated from other languages. \\Much of the new scholarly research in Indian and Tibetan Buddhistphilosophy and practice is worthy of wider circulation among an intelli-gent readership. Several outstanding dissertations are produced each yearat academic institutions throughout the world. Such significant contri-butions are normally accessible only through University Microfilms orthrough research journals that are scattered across the academic landscape.It is heartening to the editors at Wisdom to see how much of the schol-arship being produced today is the result of collaboration with scholarsbelonging to the indigenous traditions of Tibet and the Indian subcon-tinent. Wisdom Publications is certain that this approach has the great-est possibilities for enriching both academic scholarship and Buddhistpractice. Increasingly, researchers must be able to work in a bewilderingvariety of languages and disciplines in the humanities and social sciences.What a visionary like the late Richard H. Robinson hoped to produce inhis Wisconsin curriculum were scholars able to work with living expo-nents of the Asian traditions in their own languages. He also dreamt ofresearchers who would be able to keep abreast of the advances in West-ern thought. A scholar like Tillemans is a realization of Robinson'sdreams.Tom Tillemans, the author whose work is presented here, is a scholar'sscholar. He is able to work in a vast variety of languages: all major West-ern languages and Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese and Japanese. He is trainedin modern Western philosophy and can see how the traditions of East andWest interact."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"X  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEThe eleven essays presented here were published over the period1986—1999. They appeared in a number of journals or as contributionsto Festschriften. Tillemans has now arranged these essays into a unifiedand compelling structure. One can now see clearly the underlying struc-ture and understand the significance of Tillemans' contributions to Bud-dhist logic, language and epistemology.Tillemans' scholastic ancestry is rooted in the great names of Euro-pean scholarship, such as F. I. Stcherbatsky, Eugene Obermiller and ErichFrauwallner. Tillemans brings a sophisticated understanding of devel-opments in Western logic and epistemology to the traditional scholar-ship of Indian and Tibetan thinkers. He presents in these carefullycrafted pieces a clear delineation of the varying approaches of the Indiemasters and their Tibetan interpreters.This is a fascinating work with which to begin the new series.E.

It was taken up with great energy inTibet, especially from the eleventh century on, the time of the \"secondpropagation\" (phyi dar) of Buddhism, and has remained an important el-ement of Tibetan Buddhism up to the present day. It is what many people,within or outside the Buddhist community, have considered to be themost philosophical, and even the most critical, form of the Mahayana.Curiously enough, although one speaks of a distinct and influentialphilosophical school composed of the followers of Dignaga, it was onethat remained fundamentally nameless in Sanskrit. In Tibetan traditions,however, the philosophy received the conventional designation, tshadma,the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit term pramdna, a term which in itsmore ordinary sense means \"measure\" and which in its technical usemeans \"a means of valid cognition'V'a means of knowledge.\" It was inpart this Tibetan transformation of the Indian technical term pramanainto a name for a philosophy and discipline of study that led modernwriters to speak of \"Buddhist logic\" and \"Buddhist epistemology\" orpramdnavdda. Indeed, the transition from the study of \"means of validcognition\" to \"epistemology\" is relatively natural; \"logic,\" on the otherhand, seems to be better based on the term hetuvidyd/gtan tshigs rig pa,the \"science of reasons,\" which is one of the important subsidiary domainsin tshad ma studies. In any case, one should not be misled: these Englishterms are no more than approximations for a multi-faceted system in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"2  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEwhich logical theory was a major element, but certainly not the onlyone. There is no reason to think that this school's elaborate debates onparticulars, universals, mind, matter, idealism and realism were some-how more logical or epistemological than metaphysical, or that the ar-guments concerning the virtues of the Buddha, his omniscience andcompassion were any less religious or scholastic than they would seemto be.If one looks at the present collection of essays, it is quite apparent that\"Buddhist logicians\" did much more than what we might call \"logic\"and \"epistemology,\" even in loose uses of those terms. Indeed they veryactively pursued the doctrinal and religious aspects of Buddhism, somuch so that many Indians and Tibetans, and indeed some modernwriters too, would depict the religious as the primary aim of this phi-losophy. How did these Buddhist philosophers see themselves as doingsomething unified and coherent? Given that inference and perception(the two \"means of valid cognition\") would seem to concern rationallydecidable matters, how can the apparently non-rational elements be-longing to the religious side of Buddhist philosophy be coherently ac-commodated in this system?The first section of this collection of essays (i.e., \"Scripturally BasedArgumentation\") consists of three pieces in which I tried to grapple withthe Buddhist logicians' stance on religion and rationality. The strikingfeature of the Dharrnaklrtian school is that it holds that religious doc-trine can be justified and can be argued for, and with extremely restrictedtools, i.e., perception and inference. Yet if religious matters can be ar-gued for in this way, did the Dharmaklrtian school adopt the conserv-ative view that religious reasoning is just as objective and certain as rea-soning about uncontroversial, non-religious matters (like smoky hillshaving fires)? These are the concerns of the first two essays, i.e., \"Dhar-makirti, Aiyadeva and Dharmapala on Scriptural Authority\" and \"HowMuch of a Proof is Scripturally Based Inference?\" The third essay inthis section is somewhat more historical in orientation. Dharmakirtirecognizes that much religious argumentation demands allegiance to aschool and to a body of texts, but nonetheless maintains that the ordi-nary, or unexceptional, uses of logical argumentation should have com-plete independence from such doctrinal affiliations. This extremely rad-ical view on scripture has as its consequence that when one is arguingabout most empirical or even metaphysical matters, conformity with"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  3the propositions found in the scriptures of a school is virtually irrelevant.The problem that \"Pre-Dharmaklrti Commentators on the Definitionof a Thesis\" seeks to solve is \"Who first came up with this position?\" Wasit already in Dignaga? If not, how did Dharmakirti come to hold it?The second section (i.e., \"Logic\") is the largest and probably mosttechnical part of this collection, dealing in one way or another withquestions of implication, negation, valid reasons and the so-called Bud-dhist syllogisms—in short, the type of topics that a Westerner would as-sociate, in part at least, with the idea of logic. It should be obvious thatno one in the Indian and Tibetan schools could be said to have been do-ing formal logic. Nevertheless, it is so that these philosophers were awareof questions of logical form, although often inextricably combiningquestions such as \"What is logical implication?\" with what might seemto be extra-logical considerations. The first essay in this section, \"Pardrthd-numdndy Theses and Syllogisms,\" looks at the so-called \"Buddhist syl-logism,\" and more generally the idea of proof (sddhana). The second,\"On Sapaksa\" examines the notion of a logical reason and the role ofexamples in argumentation in Dharmaklrtian and Tibetan logics, fo-cusing on the Buddhist position that certain types of seemingly soundarguments are nevertheless to be rejected because examples cannot begiven. The next essay, \"Formal and Semantic Aspects of Tibetan Bud-dhist Debate Logic,\" investigates the logical structures and semantic no-tions in Tibetan bsdus grwa, a system which is considered by its expo-nents to be a faithful continuation of Dharmakirti, and yet which isalso, in many ways, quite remarkably original. \"Dharmakirti and Ti-betans on Adrsydnupalabdhihetu then takes up Indian and Tibetan waysto argue for nonexistence, while \"What is the Svadharmin in BuddhistLogic?\" examines the problems that arise when the subject of an argu-ment is itself nonexistent. The section ends with an article translated fromFrench on the general problem as to whether Buddhists somehow rea-son in a fundamentally different or even incompatible manner from theclassical logic that one finds in typical Western works on formal logic.The third section (i.e., \"Philosophy of Language\") takes up aspectsof the Buddhist semantic theory known as apoha (\"exclusion\"), the fun-damental idea being that abstract entities such as universals, conceptsand meanings can be analyzed away in terms of double negations (sup-plemented, at least for Dharmakirti, by a purely causal account as to howwe make judgements of similarity). In its Indian forms, apoha yieldsand reinforces a type of nominalism where the real is the particular."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGE(Note that \"nominalism\" is used here in the modern sense as found inNelson Goodman and W.V. Quine, where the essential requirement isthat what exists must be particular; nominalism need not be, and indeedis not for the Buddhists, a philosophy where universals are just merewords alone, or flatus vocis) The peculiarly Buddhist contribution isthat abstract entities are not just dismissed, but accountedjo< as mere ab-sences of difference and are hence unreal, just as are all other absencesfor Buddhists.1 The first essay in this section, \"On the So-called Diffi-cult Point of the Apoha Theory,\" looks at ontological matters and showsthat the nominalistic rejection of real universals was considerably modi-fied by certain Tibetan schools who reintroduced a type of realism in thegarb of a system as much inspired by bsdusgnva as by Dharmakirti. Thesecond essay, written with Donald S. Lopez, Jr., consists in a translationof a Tibetan text that applies the theory of apoha to account for what itis one talks about when discussing nonexistent pseudo-entities. The un-derlying problem which Indian and Tibetan Buddhists took up is notunlike that which inspired the philosophy of language of Meinong andprovoked the reaction that one finds in Bertrand Russell's Theory ofDescriptions and later in W.V. Quine's celebrated essay \"On WhatThere Is.\"The papers presented here are intended to be, broadly speaking, his-torical, though it is obvious that the conceptual tools employed are of-ten those of contemporary Anglo-American analytic philosophy. It isequally obvious that the history I am pursuing is the history of a phi-losophy, and as such it should not be surprising that what counts mostin this aim are texts and philosophical analyses of them. One of themain reasons why the history of logic in the West has become so welldeveloped and interesting is that historico-philological competence intextual studies has been combined with philosophical sensitivity. Thereis no reason why such a combined approach should not yield results inan Indo-Tibetan context too. Indeed, in order to disentangle what aDharmaklrtian or a Tibetan text could be saying it is necessary not just toadopt a Principle of Charity, but also to formulate a number of alter-natives in terms more precise than the text itself and, if need be, usingalien philosophical or logical notions. Being faithful to an historical au-thor does not demand that one keep the possible interpretations couchedin the same problematic or obscure language that is the author's. Thistype of \"faithfulness\" is the misguided rationale for translations thatread like \"Buddhist Hybrid English.\"2 More generally, such a method-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  5ology seems to rest on a fallacy of imitative form,3 i.e., that talk aboutsomething obscure, mysterious, funny, boring, etc., should itself havethe same stylistic characteristics as what is being talked about. Usingphilosophical tools is not, however, an attempt at appropriating Dhar-maklrti so that he might somehow become relevant to a contemporaryBuddhist philosophy. Perhaps a contemporary \"Buddhist theology\" us-ing selective doses of Dharmakirti is possible, but, even it it is not, theabsence of blueprints for the present doesn't detract from Dharmaklrti'simportance, just as it doesn't detract from that of Plato, Leibniz or Spin-oza to whose systems virtually no one subscribes now. Indeed, I wouldthink that Dharmaklrti's system, if better available, would receive amixed response today; its reductionism, its strict mind-body dualism,and its highly fragmented ontology of partless atoms and instants mightwell be quite difficult to aipcept for the many Buddhists who are seek-ing a more holistic, integrated vision of the world.A feature of these papers is that they regularly zigzag between Indianand Tibetan contexts. Almost needless to say, this does not mean thatwe take as given that Tibetan Buddhist traditions are identical with theirIndian counterparts. Tibet as being the faithful prolongation or even du-plication of India has been a seductive idea, even one which motivatedpeople to do valuable work on Tibet, but it is one whose time is nowdefinitely past. The course that we have taken between Tibet and Dhar-makirti may often be different from that of Tibetans themselves, as isour sense of what is the Indian debate and what is a Tibetan develop-ment. But then there is no easy recipe for pursuing an Indo-Tibetanapproach, nor are there any shortcuts enabling us to avoid reading bothlanguages and both sets of texts. What makes the effort worthwhile isthat history may perhaps be seen in a binocular fashion, in stereo vision,thus lending further depth to our understanding of these texts.Publishing a collection of this sort allows me to nuance a few thingsand speculate on some future directions to be pursued. One particularlyinteresting area for reflection is the question of pragmatism in Dhar-makirti, and more generally the theories of truth and justification im-plicit in his system. Another is the problem of vydpti (the implicationbetween the reason and what is to be proved), what it is for Indians andwhat it is for Tibetans. Finally, the question of whether Buddhists ever"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEuse a logic different from the usual classical variety is not easily put aside.As it was practically impossible to incorporate these discussions into thearticles themselves, let me use the remainder of this introduction tosketch out some of the broad outlines of how these philosophical themesappear to me now.PragmatismFirst of all, it has sometimes been suggested that Dharmaklrti has sometype of a. pragmatic theory of truth, especially because the reliability(avisamvddakatva) of a means of valid cognition (pramdna) consists inthere being \"confirmation of practical efficacy\" (arthakriydsthiti)* Totake one of the most common versions of a pragmatic theory of truth,as found in William James, a belief is true for people if and only if it isin the long run most useful for them to accept it.5 Now, irrespective ofhow we translate the term arthakriyd, i.e., \"efficacious action,\" \"practi-cal efficacy,\" \"goal accomplishment,\" etc., there is no reason to believethat Jamesian pragmatism or anything much like it is Dharmaklrti'stheory oi truth, certainly not when it comes to the usual examples ofpramdnas, i.e., direct perception (pratyaksa) of things like vases, and in-ference (anumdna) such as that there is fire on a hill because there issmoke. The point for Dharmaklrti, following Devendrabuddhi andSakyabuddhi, is that an awareness can jpe asserted to be a pramdna be-cause of a confirmation—this \"confirmation\" (sthiti) is glossed bySakyabuddhi as being an \"understanding\" (nogs pa)—which in typicalcases is subsequent to the initial awareness. In other words, we can ration-ally say that we genuinely saw a vase, and not some vase-like illusion,because after the initial perception we came to perceptually confirm thatthis seeming vase really does permit us to carry water as we expected andwished. Equally, although initially we might have suspected that whatwe saw was not actually fire, subsequently we were able to infer that itwas indeed fire, because there was smoke. While most initial sights andother sense perceptions are to be confirmed by subsequent perceptionsor inferences, an inference itself is something of an exception: it is saidto be confirmed simultaneously and needs no subsequent understand-ing—the point turns on the idea of inference having svatahprdmdnyamor \"intrinsically being a means of valid cognition.\" Be that as it may,what is important for us to note in the present discussion is that one"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  7understanding is being confirmed by another or in certain special casesby itself. There is nothing at all here in Dharmakirti, Devendrabuddhior Sakyabuddhi6 which suggests a Jamesian account along the lines of\"the understanding/belief/statement that there is a vase/fire over thereis true for us because it is in the long run most useful for us to believethat there is a vase/fire over there.\"Nor for that matter is there very much which would suggest a \"prag-maticist\" theory like that of C.S. Peirce, who held that \"the opinionwhich is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate is whatwe mean by truth.\"7 The major similarity between these two philoso-phers is, as far as I can see, their common commitment to the impor-tance of results and to there being an objectively right version of whatthere is. However, the idea of truth as an ideal rational assertibility isneither asserted nor rejected by Dharmakirti: what we regularly find forhim is that existent things are those that are actually established by ameans of valid cognition (pramdnasiddha). Peirce's theory is not thattruths consist of opinions that are now established, but that they are thelimits to which people's informed opinions will or should converge, i.e.,the destined upshot of inquiry.8 Indeed, his theory defines truth in termsof a consensus which may well never actually be realized (as Peirce him-self recognized); this all-important reference to an ideal consensus thatmay even be just a regulative principle is what is absent in Dharmakirti.In any case, in what follows I will mean by \"pragmatism\" and \"pragmatictheories\" essentially the Jamesian version.In fact we can go further on the question of truth and arthakriyd:arthakriydsthiti does not, I think, set forth a theory of truth at all. Letus speak of a truth theory as one which gives a definition of truth, i.e.,the necessary and sufficient conditions for statements or understand-ings to be true, while a justification theory will provide us with the prop-erties that allow us to reasonably determine that a statement or under-standing is true and satisfies the definition. Looked at in that light,arthakriydsthiti, especially as it is explained by Devendrabuddhi andSakyabuddhi, is best taken as part of Dharmakirti's justification theory.Dharmakirti is giving a procedure for truth testing, typically a kind ofverification principle along commonsense lines: \"Look and see or ana-lyze logically whether the object actually behaves as you think it does,and if it does, you can be confident that you were right in your initialunderstanding.\" In short, he is telling us when and how we can be con-fident that our understandings are true, but not what truth is."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEWhat then is Dharmakirti's theory of truth and is there any role tobe found for pragmatism in his system? It is not clear to me that Dhar-maklrti explicitly gives a generalized theory of truth anywhere, althoughif we cobble one together in keeping with his system it is probably bestviewed as turning on stronger and weaker forms of a correspondencetheory. To see this better let us briefly look at how Shoryu Katsura de-picted truth for Dharmaklrti. Katsura cited what he termed \"the time-honored definition of error in India\", i.e., \"that which grasps xas non-x,\"as evidence that Dharmakirti \"believes in some kind of real 'correspon-dence' between perception and its object, namely, resemblance of theimage.\"9 He then remarked that this definition of error is used by Dhar-maklrti to classify inference as erroneous:In other words, inference takes a universal as its immediateobject and possesses a partial and generalized picture of theobject rather than the true representation of it. There is no realcorrespondence between inference and its real object [i.e., thereal particular in the world], but merely an indirect causal re-lationship. In short, inference grasps the object through itsuniversal characteristic. Therefore, Dharmaklrti considers in-ference to be erroneous.10On Katsura's interpretation of Dharmakirti, while inference is erroneous(bhrdnta) in that it does not correspond to reality, it is nonetheless true\"from a pragmatic point of view,\" in that it \"can lead to the fulfillmentof a human purpose.\"11What Katsura has rightly focussed upon in speaking of perception asbeing \"non-erroneous\" (abhrdnta) and corresponding to its object is thewell known principle in Buddhist logic that perception has a certain re-semblance with its objects, because it sees only particulars, undifferen-tiated into substances, qualities, actions, etc., and in reality it is only theundifferentiated particular (svalaksana) entity which exists. The otherside of the coin for the Buddhist is that these fundamental distinctionsbetween separate substances, universals, etc., are only invented by theconceptual mind and hence are not mirrored by the facts. There is there-fore, in an important sense, no resemblance between how things areconceivedhy inferential cognition and how they are.12 While it is thusundoubtedly right to say that for Dharmakirti inference is bhrdnta in away in which perception is not, I don't think that it follows that the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  9implicit truth theory in Dharmaklrti's account of inferential under-standing must be a type of pragmatism, rather than correspondence.We can untangle this problem by distinguishing two senses of corre-spondence, and when they are distinguished there will be no need to in-troduce a pragmatic theory of truth.A contemporary analytic philosophy textbook surveying truth theoriesdistinguishes between two varieties of correspondence: \"correspondenceas congruence\" and \"correspondence as correlation.\"13 Both types arecorrespondence theories in that a certain fact must exist if the relevantproposition, statement or belief is to be true. The first type, congru-ence, involves an added condition, viz., that there be a structural iso-morphism, a type of mirroring relation between the truth-bearer and afact. (Thus, for example, subject-predicate structures in thought andlanguage might or might pot be congruent—depending upon one'smetaphysics—with facts composed of real substances and universals.)The second type, i.e., correlation, is a weaker type of correspondence,where there is no such isomorphism, but where it suffices that the factexist for the statement or understanding to be true. Now, if we acceptthat for Dharmakirti there is correspondence involved in perception, asI think we should, then it is the strong kind, congruence, i.e., the un-differentiated perception is congruent with the undifferendated partic-ulars. For inferences, however, although there is no structural mirror-ing, there is a causal relation that does link the understanding, or truth-bearer, to a fact, or more exactly to the particular real entities. When wecome to understand a subject-attribute proposition like \"sound is im-permanent,\" there is, for Dharmakirti, no separate substance, sound, inwhich the universal, impermanence, inheres. There are, however, im-permanent sounds, which are the real particulars to which the under-standing is linked and which must exist if the latter is to be true.Granted, impermanent sounds, hills on which there is smoke, etc., arenot in themselves strictly speaking what we might term facts or states ofaffairs, but the transition to facts like \"sound's being impermanent\"or the \"hill's having smoke\" is relatively easily made. For inference andconceptual thought, then, we still have a weak form of a correspondencetheory, like in many respects the correspondence theory that was advo-cated by J.L. Austin in the 195O's or, interestingly enough, like the the-ory of the great English idealist, J.M.E. McTaggart, who specificallyrejected a \"copy theory of truth\" but nonetheless maintained corres-pondence.14"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"IO  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEWhat is seductive is to take Dharmakirti's contrast between bhrdntaand abhrdnta as also being his explicit formulation of a theory of truth,or his theory of \"truth from an epistemological point of view,\" and tosomehow identify this and this alone with correspondence.15 The prob-lem then arises, however, as to how to classify inferential understand-ing, which is bhrdnta and thus would not seem to be true in the senseof correspondence. Hence, we are stuck with an equivocal Dharmakir-tian theoiy of truth: correspondence for perception and pragmatism forinference, I think that the root of the problem lies in looking for a pan-Indian, and hence Dharmaklrtian, theory of truth in the pair of termsbhrdnta-abhrdnta: for Buddhist logic, at least, we would come up witha more elegant, univocal result by analyzing the notion of truth implicitin the concept otprdmdnya, \"being a means of valid cognition.\" In short,we might do better to try to find a unified idea of truth which allowsDharmakirti to say univocally that both inference and perception arepramdna. That minimalist single notion of truth which Dharmakirtiactually seems to apply in common to both inference and perception isas likely to be correspondence as correlation.16The reason a Jamesian \"pragmatic truth\" theory should be ruled outas applying to Dharmakirtian inferences is that it does not require thata certain fact or certain objects must obtain for an understanding/state-ment in question to be true: on a pragmatic theory, no matter howmuch we talk about \"long term utility,\" it remains logically possiblethat a belief be useful, but that there isino such fact. Now contrast thiswith Dharmakirti's system. It is a cardinal element in Dharmakirti's ac-count of how the usual type of smoke-fire inference works that the par-ticular entities to which it is causally related must exist: if there wasn'tactually any fire on the hill, the inferential understanding would notmake us obtain (prdpaka) the object in question and hence could notbe a pramdna. The upshot is that inference does satisfy the condition forthe weaker version of the correspondence theory, correlation, becausethe entities in question must exist for the understanding to be true.Alas, the terms, bhrdnta and abhrdnta, are not naturally translated as\"incongruent\" and \"congruent,\" but rather as \"erroneous\" and \"non-erroneous.\" Still, if we are looking for notions close to congruence, theseare the likely candidates. In \"On the So-called Difficult Point of the ApohaTheory,\" I opted for the usual translation and hence had to put up withthe usual infelicities of expression. If we see the bhrdnta-abhrdnta con-trast as pertaining to congruence, however, it becomes possible to say,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  IIin keeping with Dharmakirti, that certain understandings, like infer-ences, are incongruent, i.e., bhrdnta, but are nonetheless true (becausethey are pramdnas). The gain in clarity is substantial. I'm afraid that thealternative where one says that inference is erroneous but also true is, forthe uninitiated at least, bordering on incomprehensibility. At any rate,it makes Dharmakirti look quite exotic, whereas if the point is one ofincongruence being compatible with truth, Dharmakirti ends up hold-ing a subtle and defendable position.The last thing to say on this score is that scriptural inference is un-deniably something of a special case. In \"How Much of a Proof is Scrip-turally Based Inference?\" I argued that this type of (quasi-)inference isthe only sort where some forms of pragmatism do seem to be involved,precisely because it bears upon facts to which we have no access otherthan testimony in scripture. (Indeed, because it is not connected withfacts for us, Dharmakirti explicitly denies that it is a real full-fledged in-ference.) Is this where we would find a pragmatic theory of truth? No,I don't think so. A pragmatic theory of truth is an instrumentalist truththeory, i.e., it allows as possible that statements and beliefs may be truejust because they are maximally useful, but without any fact or real en-tities corresponding to them. There is no evidence to me that Dhar-makirti would want to say that the existence of the supersensible factsspoken about in scripture is somehow not needed, or that it is irrelevantto the truth of the scriptural proposition, or that what constitutes thetruth of beliefs on such matters is just long term maximal utility. Whatis more likely is that we have here a pragmatic theory of justification,showing how people of limited understanding can and should determinewhen it is appropriate for them to believe in things like the details of thelaw of karma, things which they fundamentally cannot understand ontheir own and without scripture. In other words, if we wish to pursuespiritual \"goals of man\" (purwdrtha), we have no other criterion for test-ing scriptural statements on supersensible matters and justifying our be-lief in them apart from the vital beneficial consequences that believingin such things will have for our spiritual progress. This is part of what isinvolved in Dharmakirti's well-known formula that we rely on scripture\"because there is no other way\" (agatyd): our limited understanding can-not have access directly or inferentially to the facts. Nonetheless, noth-ing in that discussion implies that there is no fact to the matter or neednot be any fact for scriptural statements to be true.

This constitutes asignificant difference in approach from Dharmakirti and the post-Dhar-makirti Indian schools in that the purely logical problem of saying whatvyapti is is separated from the very difficult epistemological enterpriseof providing a procedure to ascertain that there is a relation guarantee-ing the absence of a counterexample.17Some writers, such as Bimal Krishna Matilal, have argued that it is adistinctive feature of Indian logic not to separate logical, epistemologi-cal and psychological issues.18 That is, I now think, true. Let us brieflylook at some of the details of Matilal's position, in particular the indis-pensable role of the example. Matilal argues that a multi-faceted ap-proach combining logic with extra-logical matters is evident in the In-dian position that vyapti be not just a universally quantified statementbut one which is exemplified, as in:(1) Whatever is produced is impermanent, like a vase.Although the first part of the statement of the vyapti \\s^ according to"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  13Matilal, translatable into first order logic as a statement of the form \"Forall x: if x is .Fthen x is G\" the example serves to guarantee that we arenot arguing about uninstantiated empty statements and that vydpti willalways have existential commitment. And that is one of the major reasonswhy, for Matilal, Indian logic is not like a formal logic: a universal pre-mise in a syllogism-like formal structure would have no need for anexample at all.19I think that Matilal was indeed onto something here about the In-dian context and that it is important to get clear what is right about thischaracterization to be able to see what happened when we get to Tibet,where this characterization does not apply. Now, first of all, it is not fullyaccurate to say that a genuine example (drstdnta) different from the sub-ject (dharmin, paksa) is always necessary: as is well known, the \"advo-cates of intrinsic implication!1 (antarvyaptivddin) did not think exampleswere necessary for \"the intelligent,\" and in fact there is an intriguing pas-sage in Dharmakirti's Pramdnavarttika which indicates that he himselfheld a type of proto-Antarvyaptivada.20 Nonetheless, even for an An-tarvyaptivadin, the vydpti will not be uninstantiated, as it will be in-stantiated by the subject of the reasoning. More seriously, there are realproblems in saying that the first part of the vydpti statement is translat-able into a quantified conditional of the usual sort that one finds in firstorder logic. In first order logic the \"for all xn will range only over existentthings, whereas it can be rather quickly shown that if we are to intro-duce quantification to account for the vydpti statements in certain In-dian Buddhist discussions, the quantifier \"for all x\" must range overboth existent and nonexistent things. We see quite clearly in the Bud-dhist logicians' use of inferences like the so-called bddhakaprarndna(based on Dharmakirti's Vddanydya) that the example can be a nonex-istent thing, like a rabbit's horn or a flower in the sky, and that the scopeof the vydpti must therefore range over nonexistents as well as existents.Nor is it particularly infrequent or revolutionary for Buddhists to givesuch nonexistent items as examples—Bhavaviveka, who was well beforeDharmakirti, used the example of the sky-flower in Madhyamakahrdayaand Tarkajvdld too and even Dignaga used the example \"space\" (dkdsa)in his Hetucakra, an example which is not actually existent for a Bud-dhist.21 It we wish to formalize vydpti statements into first order logic,we probably need quantifiers which range over actual and non-actualitems, such as in the logic developed in Richard Routley's (i.e., RichardSylvan's) article entitled \"Some Things do not Exist.\"22 And in that case,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"14  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEit cannot be maintained that the use of the example is to guaranteegenuine existential commitment, for in many cases the example itself isnot something real at all.While we cannot maintain that vydpti statements in Indian Buddhistlogic must actually have existential import or commitment, we can agreewith Matilal in maintaining that the antecedent and consequent termsin vydpti—i.e., the vydpya (\"pervaded\") and the vydpaka (\"pervader\")—do have to be instantiated. But this instantiation or exemplification caneven be by utterly nonexistent items. Take the so-called sddhyaviparyayebddhakdnumdna, or the \"inference which invalidates [the presence of thereason] In the opposite of the [property] to be proved\" to which we al-luded above: \"The permanent/non-momentary does not exist, becauseit does not have any efficacy successively or all at once, like a rabbit'shorn or flower in the sky.\" This inference is usually given in somethinglike the following way:(2) Whatever does not have a successive or simultaneous[production of effects], is not capable of effective action[i.e., does not exist], like a rabbit's horn. That which isnon-momentary does not have a successive or simulta-neous [production of effects].23This bddhaka-inference is thus used to establish that existence is ab-sent amongst non-momentary things, or in other words that whateveris non-momentary/permanent does not exist, which is clearly the con-traposition of the fundamental principle that whatever exists is momen-tary. The vydpti statement here is:(3) Whatever does not have a successive or simultaneous[production of effects], is not capable of effective action[i.e., does not exist], like a rabbit's horn.Putting the first part of (3), without the example, into its formal para-phrase yields:(4) For all x, if x does not produce effects successively orsimultaneously, then x does not exist.The quantification in this conditional must range over existent as well"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  15as nonexistent things. To complete the paraphrase, a statement that therabbit's horn does not produce effects and does not exist would have tobe conjoined to (4). This example statement would then imply:(5) For some (existent or nonexistent) x, x does not pro-duce effects successively or simultaneously and x doesnot exist.In short, the example statement, \"like a rabbit's horn,\" has the effect ofshowing that both the antecedent and consequent terms in (4) are notempty. It is not guaranteeing genuine existential commitment) but it isguaranteeing that the vydpya and vydpaka must have instances.Now, what seems to have happened in the case of Tibetan bsdus grwalogic is that the Indian requirement that the vydpya and vydpaka besomehow instantiated (either by an example or at least by the subject)was simply dropped. True, the example is cited on occasion, by andlarge out of deference to the fact that the reasoning in question has beenborrowed from an Indian text. Equally, the theoretical discussion aboutexamples being needed is there in the Tibetan texts,24 perhaps essen-tially because it is there in their Indian ancestors. However, in the vastmajority of statements of vydpti in bsdus grwa logic texts or in the nu-merous texts which use bsdus grwa logic, no example is given at all. Ifan example is presented and discussed, it is generally in order to answerthe epistemological question as to how a particular controversial vydpti isto be established on the basis of an example (dpe'i steng du grub pa).That the statement of vydpti itself generally does not include an exam-ple suggests fairly clearly that, de facto at least, this Tibetan vydpti is dif-ferent from its Indian homologue, in that it is just a universal implica-tion, and not a universal implication which also has an instance. But onecan go further: bsdus grwa logicians clearly and explicitly recognize thatthere are vydpti where in principle no instantiation whatsoever is possi-ble. In these vydpti not just are there no examples of existent or nonexis-tent things having the property of the vydpyay even the subject doesn'tpossess the vydpya. In effect, Tibetan bsdus grwa logicians recognizedthe fact that the falsity of the antecedent was a sufficient condition forthe truth of the whole conditional—one finds this in the curious state-ments of vydptiwhere the antecedent is clearly impossible, as for exam-ple when people are arguing about all barren women's children havingsuch and such properties. The principle is known as gangdran dranyin"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"16  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEpas khyab (\"whatever one might think of will be implied\") and is simi-lar to the Medievals' exfalso sequitur quodlibet: because the antecedent is(necessarily) false, the whole conditional is true, whatever might be givenas the consequent.25 As far as I can see, there is no evidence that Dharma-klrtians in India countenanced any analogue to the idea oiexfalso sequi-tur quodlibet. Quite possibly it would have seemed as absurd to them asit has to many in the West, who feel that if that is what material implica-tion in formal logic permits, we had better explain our ordinary notionsof entailment in some other way, perhaps along the lines of relevancelogic or strict implication. In one way or another, people do demand thatthere be instantiation and a connection between terms for an entail-ment to hold—falsity or impossibility of the antecedent does not seemenough.The preceding discussion has some summarizable results. First of all,in \"Formal and Semantic Aspects of Tibetan Buddhist Debate Logic\" Ihad thought that \"epistemological and logical aspects were perhaps in-adequately distinguished\" in Dharmakirti's thought, that \"pervasion it-self in Dharmakirti translates into the same universally quantified for-mula as in Tibetan logic,\" and that \"the Tibetans' separation of theformal notion of pervasion from its Dharmaklrtian epistemological bag-gage does, perhaps, represent a certain progress.\"26 It should be clearthat I would no longer go to that extreme. Secondly, if we agree withMatilal that one of the main features differentiating Indian logic fromWestern formal counterparts is the insistence upon the implication be-ing instantiated, then bsdus grwa logic's notion of implication is notonly rather un-Indian, but it shares the major features of the formal no-tion. And thirdly, it is clear that there were important formal discover-ies in bsdus grwa, influenced by the revised understanding of vydpti. Aswe mentioned, a logical notion of vydpti stripped of requirements aboutexamples and relations between terms led the Tibetans to discover andaccept formal principles similar to ex falso sequitur quodlibet. Anotherstriking development which this purely logical notion of vydpti permit-ted was the bsdus grwa logicians' discovery that there could be severaltypes of vydpti (i.e., the so-called khyab pa sgo brgyadov \"eight types ofpervasion\") by changing the order of the implication and adding nega-tion operators, and that these pervasions would have elaborate formalrelations between them. Indeed, 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa (1648-1721)went very far in this direction, distinguishing twelve pervasions ratherthan the usual eight; his elaborate calculation of iterated multiples of for-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  17mal equivalences between these pervasions, abstracted of all content andneeding no instances, deserves to be regarded as genuine progress in theformal knowledge of his time.27Deviant LogicFinally, a word on the perennial question as to whether and to what de-gree the logic which Buddhists use and advocate is in accord with keytheorems of Western logic. Is their logic a more or less classical logic,with perhaps an odd twist or two concerning quantification and exis-tential import, but nothing deviant like a rejection of contradiction orexcluded middle? That is essentially what I argued in the essay \"Is Bud-dhist Logic a Non-classical orlDeviant Logic?\" I would continue to standby that position in the case of Dharmakirti and his successors, Indianor Tibetan, and indeed for most of the Indo-Tibetan Madhyamaka too.It can be reiterated that \"If there is any deviance, it can only be highlylocal.\"281 would, however, be prepared to grant that the logic underly-ing the Prajfidpdramitdsutras and, to a lesser degree, the early Madhya-maka, may after all be something of the exception, more prone to para-dox or paraconsistency, indeed that it could perhaps be close to the kindof depiction that scholars like Edward Conze and Jacques May gave it.29The result would be that on this scenario Buddhist thought would havea history of going from the very provocative logic of certain Mahayanasutras, and perhaps even Nagarjuna, to the tamer logic of the scholas-tic. The later Indo-Tibetan scholastic, not surprisingly perhaps, wouldturn out to have an increasingly conservative reaction to the originalwritings of their tradition, arguing that the paradoxical or provocativeaspects just cannot be taken at face value, but must be explained awaywith qualifiers and hedges. Indeed, interestingly enough, when it comesto logical deviance, a writer like Tsong kha pa would argue very muchin the way that people like J.F. Staal have argued: the thought behindthe texts cannot be like that, if it is not to be irrational.30 This is un-doubtedly a powerful interpretative intuition. But with inconsistent orparaconsistent logics becoming ever more sophisticated and respectable,it becomes increasingly difficult to see that all types of contradictions areequally irrational. Furthermore, notions like the Hegelian Aufbebung,which Jacques May relied upon in his interpretations, cannot be dis-missed in the cavalier fashion that they were by logical positivists and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"18  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEtheir successors. I don't now know how to exclude that the Prajndpdra-mitasutras are most simply and naturally read as having more or less thecontradictions they appear to have.

TillemansLausanne, May 1999NOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION1 Precisely because apoha does try to give an account for the universalsto which language is committed, rather than just dismissing them, HansHerzbeirger has characterized it as a \"resourceful nominalism,\" as contrastedwith the less satisfactory \"happy nominalist\" variety that he attributes to JeanBuridan and to Nelson Goodman. See Herzberger (1975).2 The term is that of Paul Griffiths (1981). For more on the necessaryintersection between philosophy and philology, see Tillemans (1995c).3 I don't know who first coined this term. At any rate, compare its use byWilliam Ian Miller in The Anatomy ofdisgust (1997: ix): \"While one neednot be boring to describe boredom, nor confusing to describe confusion, itjust may be that the so-called fallacy of imitative form is not completely falla-cious when it comes to disgust.\"4 Cf. the discussions in Dreyfus (1995: 671-91) and in Dreyfus (1997: ch.17). Although Dreyfus gives a nuanced \"No\" to the question \"IsDharmaklrti a Pragmatist?\" his arguments are rather different from mine andcannot be taken up here. Cf. also R. Jackson (1993: 43-63).5 Williams James's own formulations of pragmatism are notoriously vague.Here are two samples from James (1907), reprinted in Goodman (1995: 28,63): (1) \"Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that willcarry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,linking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor; istrue for just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally.\" (2) \".. .anidea is *true' so long as to believe it is profitable to our lives....The true is the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  19name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief.\" Cf. the refor-mulation of this position in R. Kirkham (1995: 97): A belief h is true forsuch and such a person s when \"all things considered and over the long-term,acceptance of b helps s explain, predict, and manipulate his world and com-municate with others better than if s did not accept b\" We could abbreviatethis formulation: b is true for s if and only if it is maximally useful for s toaccept b.6 See PramdnavdrttikaW, k. lbc: arthakriydsthitih I avisamvddanam.Devendrabuddhi comments in the Pramdnavdrttikapanjikd, P. 2b2-3:skyes bu ma sluspas ni mi bslu ba ni mngonpar 'dod pa'i don dangphradpar byedpa'i mtshan nyid can gyi mngon sum dang I ryes sudpagpar khyab par byedpayin no II de nyid mam par grel pa'i phyirI don byed nus par gnas pa ni I mi bslu bayin te I zhes by a ba smos teI tshad mas yongs su nges pa'i don gyis (b)sgrub par by a ba'i don byedpar rtogspa'o //\"What is non-belying [i.e., reliable], in that it doesnot lie to people, encompasses perception and inference, which havethe characteristic of making [people] obtain the sought after (mngonpar 'dodpa = abhimata) object.

Austin (1950); see also Kirkham (1995: 124-30) on Austin. Cf.McTaggart(1921: 12):Our theory that truth consists in a certain correspondence with afact, which correspondence is not further definable, must not beconfused with the theory that truth consists in resemblance to afact—a view which has been sometimes called the 'copy theory' oftruth. Resemblance is a correspondence, but all correspondence isnot resemblance, and the particular correspondence which consti-tutes truth is not resemblance There is no special resemblancebetween the belief and the fact.15 Perhaps one would invoke Aristotle's definition of truth as found inMetaphysics 101 Ib26 (\"To say [either] that which is is not or that which isnot is, is a falsehood; and to say that that which is is and that which is notis not, is true\") as being essentially the same as the pan-Indian definition ofbhrdnti-abhrdnti. The supplementary premise would be to say that Aristotleis defining truth as correspondence, or even correspondence as congruence.This would, however, be a very shaky argument, as it is not at all clear thatthe supplementary premise is true.16 In a recent article my colleague J. Bronkhorst quite convincingly showedthe importance of a correspondence theory in several Indian philosophies in-cluding Madhyamaka, Samkhya and others. This correspondence of whichhe spoke was correspondence as congruence, involving an isomorphism be-tween the components of the truth bearer (i.e., an understanding or proposi-tion) and the components of reality. Interestingly enough, he recognized thatcertain Buddhists, such as Vasubandhu, did not seem to accept such a one-to-one correspondence or isomorphism, but that they nonetheless did haveimportant features of a correspondence theory. I would submit that he was"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION  21right, not just for Vasubandhu but also, or even especially, for the logicians:if we need a label for the sort of correspondence theory involved in concep-tual thought, it is \"correspondence as correlation.\" See Bronkhorst (1996).Finally, it should also be remarked that the theory of correspondence ascongruence and correspondence as correlation applies when Dharmakirtispeaks from a Sautrantika viewpoint, but also when he adopts the Yogacarapoint of view. Notably, from his idealist stance, perception remains abhrdntaand conceptualization remains bhrdnta. (The position that the separationbetween subjects/substances and predicates/universals is only due to concep-tualization continues to apply from the Dharmakirtian Yogacara perspec-tive.) It might be wondered as to what correspondence could be on theYogacara point of view, because there is no external object to correspondto. Nevertheless, there are pramdnas concerning mental particulars, and thatwould again entail that if a cognition is a pramdna, and hence true, the rele-vant particulars (all be they mental) exist. That's all we mean by the minimaltype of correspondence which every pramdna has, viz., correspondence ascorrelation. An understanding is true when the relevant particulars exist, butexistence can be qua external entity or qua mental entity—Dharmakirti'schoice of ontology probably doesn't matter much on that score. Cf. Kirkham(1995: 134-35) on non-realist correspondence theories. J.ME. McTaggartis, once again, an interesting comparison, as he advocated both idealism anda correpondence theory of truth (i.e., correspondence as correlation). Seen. 14. See also McTaggart (1927: 53): \"The belief in the non-exiscence ofmatter does not compel us to adopt a sceptical attitude towards the vastmass of knowledge, given us by science and in everyday life, which, primafaciey relates to matter. For that knowledge holds true of various perceptionswhich occur to various men, and of the laws according to which these occur-rences are connected...\"17 Why am I so pessimistic about the success of Dharmakirti's program forfinding a \"natural relation\" (svabhdvapratibandha)? The problem lies in hisestablishing causality by induction and claiming that this relation will lead tocertainty so that a counterexample is definitively ruled out. No matter howmany qualifiers and hedges one adds (and Dharmakirti adds several ofthem), it seems highly unlikely that anyone, East or West, is going to solvethe problem of induction so that one can say with certainty that one thing isthe cause of another, rather than just coincidentally succeeded by that otherthing. See B. Gillon (1991) on Dharmakirti's potential difficulties with in-duction. Dharmakirti and his school put forward a threefold and a fivefoldmethod of analysis (trikapahcakacintd).

Interestingly, Matilal (1998:111) is about as pessimistic as 1 am about this doomed quest for certainty; hequotes approvingly the philosopher J.L. Mackie who said, \"If anybody claimstoday to have solved the problem [of induction], we may think ofhim as being mildly insane.\"18 See B.K. Matilal (1998: 14-15). Matilal, like several other scholars,deliberately did not take vydpti and the necessary relation between terms(sambandha, pratibandha) as separable concepts. He regularly glossed vydptias \"the inference-warranting relation,\" as, for example, in the followingstatement: \"This 'inference-warranting' connection was called vydpti, prati-bandha, or niyama...\" (1998: 49).19 Matilal (1998: 15-16). See P.F. Strawson (1952: 164) on existentialcommitment:Everyone agrees that it would be absurd to claim that the man whosays \"All the books in his room are by English authors\" has made atrue statement, if the room referred to has no books in it at all. Hereis a case where the use of \"all\" carries the existential commitment.On the other hand, it is said, we sometimes use \"all\" without thiscommitment. To take a classic example: the statement made by1 All moving bodies not acted upon by external forces continue ina state of uniform motion in a straight line\" may well be true evenif there never have been or will be any moving bodies not actedupon by external forces.20 See n. 33 in our article \"On Sapaksa\" reprinted as chapter 5 in this volumeSee also K.

However, what is remarkable, as we shall see lateron, is that Dharmakirti's presentation also bears important similaritiesto, and perhaps may have even been influenced by, some passages in chap-ter 12 of the Catuhsataka (CS) of Aryadeva.The Epistemological Schools PositionLet us begin with some of the relevant passages from Dignaga and Dhar-maklrti:PS II, k. 5a:2 Because authoritative words (dptavdda) are simi-27"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGElar [to an inference] in not belying, they are [classified as] in-ference.PV I, k. 215:3 A [treatise's4] having no visamvdda (\"lies\")[means that] there is no invalidation of its two [kinds of]propositions concerning empirical and unempirical things bydirect perception or by the two sorts of inference either [viz.,inference which functions by the force of [real] entities (vastu-baldpravrtta) and inference which is based on scripture(dgamdsrita)5].PV I, k. 216:6 As authoritative words are similar [to other in-ferences] in not belying, the understanding of their imper-ceptible (paroksa) object is also termed an inference, for [oth-erwise] there would be no way [to know such objects7].PV I, k. 217:8 Or, they do not belie with regard to the prin-cipal point [viz., the four noble truths9], for the nature of whatis to be rejected and what is to be realized as well as themethod is acknowledged. Therefore [the understanding aris-ing from the Buddha's words can properly] be an inference inthe case of the other things [too, i.e., radically inaccessible ob-jects10].Now, first of all, the usual types of inferences which we associate withDignaga and Dharmakirti, such as those of sound's impermanence andthe like, are said to be vastubalapravrttanumana in that they derive theirtruth from the fact that the reason—being a product (krtakatva)—is inreality, or objectively, related with the property—impermanence—andqualifies the subject, sound. However, an important point which needsto be made clear is that in spite of the numerous passages in which theseauthors talk about one state of affairs proving another, or about naturalconnections (svabhdvapratibandha) between the terms in an inference,it is not the case that every inference functions by the force of [real] en-tities (vastubalapravrtta)}1 (Often, for convenience, we will adopt a lessliteral translation for this technical term, i.e., \"objective inference.\" Thepoint here, very briefly, is that the usual or paradigmatic type of inferencein Dharmakirti is one which functions objectively, or \"by the force ofreal entities,\" in that it can and should be evalutated purely on the basis"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"DHARMAKIRTI, ARYADEVA AND DHARMAPALA 29of facts and states of affairs, and not in any way because of belief, ac-ceptance or faith in someone or his words.) Vastubalapravrtta is cer-tainly an unbending requirement for the normal or \"straightforward\"type of inferences with which we are familiar, but, as we see in PV 1, k.215, there are also inferences based on scripture; that is to say, there ex-ist inferences in which a scriptural passage rather than a state of affairsis given as the reason. The questions then easily arises as to (a) whichsorts of scriptural passages can be used in such inferences, and (b) howthe admittance of scriptural proofs can be harmonized with the generaltenor of Dignaga and Dharmakirti's thought which is, no doubt, ori-ented towards vastiibalapravrttdnumdna.Let us begin with (b). The epistemological school solves this problemby introducing three sorts of objects: perceptible (pratyaksa), imper-ceptible (paroksa) and radically inaccessible (atyantaparoksa). The firstsort consists of those things such as form (riipa), vases, etc. which areaccessible to direct perception, while the second consists of things (suchas impermanence, selflessness, etc.) which can be proven through theusual vastubala kind of inference. The third kind, however, are objectssuch as the different heavens (svarga) or the details of the operation ofthe law of karma, which are, of course, inaccessible to direct perception,but which also cannot be proven by citing some other state of affairs asa reason. In short, we might say that these objects are beyond the lim-its of ordinary rationality.12 A slight complication which should becleared up at this point is that Dharmakirti often uses paroksa, a termwhich also has an extremely important place in PV III, in the sense ofatyantaparoksa. However we see in the commentaries that what is atstake in PV I, k. 216 is indeed atyantaparoksa, and moreover, it is clearfrom certain passages elsewhere (in PV IV) that Dharmakirti himselfdid explicitly accept this threefold division of objects.13So Dharmakirti limits the scope of scripturally based inferences tocases where the object is radically inaccessible (atyantaparoksa), and hencebeyond the range of ordinary ratiocination. By means of this strict de-limitation, he can preserve his theory of inferences being objectivelygrounded, for this will be a requirement of logical reasoning which appliesto pratyaksa and paroksa objects. He can also at the same time distancehimself from the non-Buddhist schools' use of scripture. In effect the er-ror which a Mimamsaka or Samkhya makes in citing scriptural passagesas a means of proof (sadhana) is that they apply scriptural arguments topropositions, such as sound's impermanence, etc., which can and should"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEbe decided by vastubalapravrttdnumdna, and which are not at all out-side the bounds of ordinary ratiocination.14As for question (a), viz., the kinds of scriptural passages which can beused, Dharmaklrti introduces what Tibetan scholastics would come tocall \"the threefold analysis\" (dpyadpa gsum) for testing as to whetherscriptures (lung = dgama) are sound bases for inference or not.15 In par-ticular, as PV I, k. 215 makes clear, such a scripture must be (i) unre-futed by direct perception, (ii) unrefuted by vastubalapravrttdnumdna,and (iii) free from contradiction with other propositions whose truth isscripturally inferred. Put in this way it might seem that what is beingsaid is simply that the scripture cannot be refuted by any pramdna, orthat it cannot come into conflict with any of the other three kinds ofobjects. However, the point at stake, as we find it elaborated in PV I, k.216, Dharmaklrti's Svavrtti or Svopajiiavrtti (PVSV) and Karnakago-min's Tikdy is more subtle, and is essentially an inductive argument: thescripture's assertions concerning pratyaksa and paroksa are seen to betrustworthy, and so, similarly, its assertions about atyantaparoksa, if notinternally inconsistent, should also be judged trustworthy. The argu-ment is given an alternative formulation in PV I, k. 217 when Dhar-maklrti says that because the (Buddhist) scriptures are trustworthy con-cerning the principal points, viz., the four noble truths, they should alsobe trustworthy on radically inaccessible matters. The four noble truthsare accessible to proof by vastubalapravrttdnumdna—as we see in thesecond chapter of PV—and thus, as fchese propositions in the Buddhistscriptures are trustworthy, so the others should be, too.In short, scriptural argumentation—when applied to atyantaparoksa,which is its only proper domain—is an inference: there is no need to pos-tulate an additional pramdna such as the sdbda (\"testimony\") of certainHindu schools. It is, however, a rather special, indirect case of inference,in that it turns on an inductive generalization which presupposes the useand correctness of direct perception and vastubalapravrttdnumdna.Aryadeva and DharmapalaNow, a remarkable point in this connection is that the Tibetan writerTsong klia pa bio bzang grags pa (1357—1419) in his Tshadma'i brjedbyang chen mo noticed that Dharmaklrti's PV I, k. 217cd resembles k.280 in chapter 12 of Aryadeva's Catuhsataka.^ Tsong kha pa was fol-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"DHARMAKIRTI, ARYADEVA AND DHARMAPALA 31lowed in this by rGyal tshab dar ma rin chen (1364—1432), who alsoremarked that CS XII, k.280 was the same reasoning as found inDignaga and Dharmakirti (phyogs glang yab sras). Subsequently, theMongolian A lag sha ngag dbang bstan dar (1759-1840), in his sTonpa tshad ma'i skyes bur sgrub pa'i gtam, elaborated on the two verses,paraphrasing them into an identical formal argument (prayoga), and cit-ing them in his proof that the Buddha is a \"person of authority'\" (tshadma'i skyes bu).n While it seems impossible to definitively establish a di-rect lineage from Aryadeva to Dharmapala to Dharmakirti, the similar-ities between the verses in question do seem more then coincidental,and it is not at all impossible that Dharmakirti was aware of Aryadeva'sthought, and that he made use of certain elements. Let us look at CSXII, k. 280 with Dharmapala's commentary.After Dharmapala has argued that the doctrines of the non-Buddhist\"Outsiders\" (wai dao, ^il) contain various faults and untruths, hiscommentary then has the Outsider object:In that case, the noble teaching in the Tripitaka of the Tatha-gata [also] sometimes has statements which are scarcely believ-able, and so {shi ze, HIM = evam ca krtvd (?)) all the Insiders'and the Outsiders' texts would be untrustworthy; thus a grossabsurdity (tai guo shi, ^C M. ^ = atiprasanga) would ensue.How so? [Because] in the Buddha's sutras are mentioned var-ious miraculous transformations {shen bian, ffl §H = vikurvana;rddhilK) which are unimaginable. Or [these sutras] speak aboutobjects which have extremely profound (shen shen, IS S;) na-tures; no sentient beings can fathom [these things]. ...[Theobjector now goes on to describe the miraculous powers andqualities of the Buddha and various other difficult to compre-hend facts. He then sums up the objection:] As things such asthese are all hardly credible, we harbor deep reservations aboutthem. [Reply:] Phenomena, if they merely existed, could in-deed give rise to [such types or] doubts. But phenomena arealso void. Hence [Aryadeva] states in the following verse:19When someone gives rise to doubt concerningthe inaccessible [things] (paroksa) taught by theBuddha, then he should develop conviction inthese very things on account of voidness.20"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEThe point is that correctness of the Buddha's teaching on voidness,which is accessible to ordinary inferential understanding, should leadone to believe that his teachings on matters inaccessible to such infer-ences are also correct. It is interesting to note that the Sanskrit of Arya-deva's verse employs the term paroksa, which is translated into Chineseas shen W- or \"profound\" (see n. 20). In Dharmapala's commentary wesee him using the term shen shen ifi M in this context, which wouldthus very likely be the equivalent of atyantaparoksa, although such anequivalent is not to my knowledge attested elsewhere. (Usually shen shen= gambhira.) At any rate, it is clear that the use of paroksa/shen at stakein Aryadeva and Dharmapala, just as in Dharmaklrti's PV I, k. 216,does refer to propositions inaccessible to direct perception and ordinaryinference.The similarities between Dharmakirti and Dharmapala's approachesbecome even more striking when we look at the argumentation in thesubsequent kdrikdm CS with Dharmapala's commentary. In this verse,Aryadeva gives a kind of contraposed version of the reasoning found inCS XII, k. 280, arguing that because the Outsiders are mistaken on ob-jects which are accessible to inference, then they must also be mistakenon those which are not. Dharmapala, at this point, launches into a longrefutation of the Vais'esika's metaphysical categories (paddrtha) and theSamkhya's theory of the primordial nature (prakrti) and the three qual-ities (guna) to show that the Outsiders are indeed hopelessly mistakenin their accounts of rationally analyzable objects, and hence cannot betrusted in their accounts of what is unanalyzable and is essentially moredifficult to comprehend. Now, not only is this completely consonantwith Dharmaklrti's approach in PV I, k. 215-16, but conspicuously,Dharmakirti in the Svavrtti to k. 215 explicitly mentions the three qual-ities and the Vaisesika categories of substance, motion, universals. etc.as being prime examples of refutable objects.I conclude then that the similarities between these authors do seemto represent a common approach, as the Tibetan scholastics maintain.This, of course, may have been because these ideas were more or lesscommonly familiar to various thinkers of that period of time, ratherthan due to any more direct relationship. If however we take the hy-pothesis that Dharmakirti (ca. 600—660 C.E.) was familiar with, andeven influenced by Aryadeva's thought, then it may very well have beenvia the commentary of Dharmapala (530-561 C.E.), which is after allthe first commentary on the Catuhsataka that we know of. Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"DHARMAKlRTI, ARYADEVA AND DHARMAPALA 33we know that Dharmapala did write a commentary on Dignaga's Akim-banapariksd,21 and as M. Hattori maintains, he may veiy well have beena \"grandpupil of Dignaga\"22: in other words, on Dharrnapala's side it isclear that he was, in spite of his commentaries on Madhyamika texts,very close to the epistemological school. It remains to be investigatedthen as to what other significant points of similarity, or influences, canbe found between Dharmapala and that other illustrious member ofDignaga's lineage, Dharmaklrti.23NOTES TO CHAPTER 1The original publication of this article contains the following dedication:\"The present article took shape from work which I did during 1983—85 atHiroshima University and is offered as a gesture of gratitude to Prof. AtsushiUno, of whom I retain very fond memories.\"1 In what follows the difference between dgama and s'dstra is of no conse-quence.

This interpre-tation of Dharmakirti's account of scripturally based inferences (dgamd-s'ritdnumdna),1 which we shall term for short \"inference-like-any-other,\"is not just a hypothetical possibility. Indeed, with a few minor differ-ences, the idea of scriptural inference as being just one amongst threekinds of inferences, but as full-fledged as the others, is the way Dhar-maklrti has been interpreted by many, who have in one way or anothertaken Dharmakirti's account of scripture to be a surpisingly rational ap-proach to subjects which, otherwise, would be unknowable to us. Inter-estingly enough, although it is hard to pin down specific Indian writerson the question of just how rational or probative a Dharmakirtian scrip-tural inference is, we do see major Tibetan writers clearly taking scripturalinferences as being as probative as any other inference, just different insubject matter.

All the other considerations are suppos-edly just as in the case of vastubalapravrttdnumdna. To look at some ofthe details in the Tsong kha pa version of scriptural inferences, the usualcriteria for a valid reason, the so-called three characteristics (tshul = rupa),are said to hold quite unproblematically, even objectively (dngos stobs kyis- vastubalena) in the case of scripturally based reasons, i.e., the \"reasonsbased on authority\" (yid ches pa'i rtags). In other words, it is objectivelyso that the reason based on authority is a property of the subject (paksa-dharma), and that it has the two types of pervasion (vydpti). In the Tshadma 'i brjed byang chen mo passage, Tsong kha pa makes the point that allinferences (viz., those concerning objective matters, conventions andthose based on scripture/authority) are in fact reliant on the certaintyor ascertainments (ngespa = niscaya; niscita) due to objective pramdnas;there are no degrees or hierarchies of certainty amongst inferences: allinferences have the same degree of certainty coming from having thesame type of pramdnas ascertaining the reasons' characteristics.To sum up, Tsong kha pa's position, as we see in these two quota-tions, has the following key features:(1) Scriptural inference is just to be differentiated from oth-ers by its sddhya."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGE(2) Scriptural inference relies on a reason which can be shownobjectively (dngos stobs kyis = vastubalena) to possessesthe three characteristics.(3) Scriptural inference is a bonafidey full-fledged inferenceleading to certainty (niscaya) that the reason proves thesddhya.It should be said that Tsong kha pa is construing the scriptural in-ference in such a way that it is not actually the words of the scripturewhich prove anything, but rather the fact that the scripture passes thethreefold analysis (dpyadpa gsum). And although Tsong kha pa's viewscertainly became the majority view in Tibet, there were dissenting writ-ers, such as Tsong kha pa's great critic, the Sa skya pa, gSer mdog panchen s'akya mchog ldan, who took the logical reason to be the textualquotation itself.4 However, although the ensuing debate between thetwo camps is interesting for other reasons (which we cannot go intonow), there are no significant differences between the two camps aboutpoints (1) though (3) which I just mentioned. Both camps, at one stageor another in scriptural argumentation, rely upon the exact same formalargument (prayoga) that such and such a scripture is non-belying withregard to what it teaches because it passes the threefold analysis. More-over for both Tsong kha pa and Sakya mchog ldan, the characteristics(rilpa) of that latter logical reason (i.e., passing the threefold test) are ob-jectively proven so that the conclusion (\"non-belying\") is utterly com-pelling and certain.5Now, earlier we had said that on the Tsong kha pa version of the \"in-ference-like-any-other\" position, all the other considerations, besidesthe choice of objects for the sddhya, are just as in the case of vastubala-pravrttdnumdna. The same remark will hold for Sakya mchog ldan. Butwhat are these \"other considerations\" which we were thinking oft Broadlyspeaking, they are all that pertains to the \"probative status\" of the in-ference, i.e., how certain is it and how much can it compel people to be-lieve in the truth of the conclusion, when they do not fully share thesame vision of the Buddhist spiritual path as that presented in the scrip-ture, or a fortiori when they are not members of the Buddhist commu-nity at all. Involved in this same question is the philosophical issue ofwhat kind of theory of truth (or perhaps better, what kind of theory ofjustification of truth claims6) is being advocated, whether scriptural"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"HOW MUCH OF A PROOF?  41inference is turning on the same type of theory as the usual vastubalavdi-riety, or whether it leans towards a different type of theory, one whichis more along the lines of a form of pragmatism and which might evenallow dissent and criticism. In short, the real question at stake is whetherBuddhist scriptural statements are true or can justifiably be thought tobe true, because belief in their truth is useful, even crucial, to someonewho wishes to attain a certain type of spiritual progress and liberation,or whether scriptural statements are true and justified objectively, invirtue of facts, and independently of the utility of believing in them. Say-ing that scriptural inferences are vastubala-pravrtta is (in a way whichwe will specify later) to lean towards the latter view and will have pre-dictably conservative consequences.It is time to turn to Dharmakirti and some of his Indian commentators.There are, I think, some clear passages which show that scriptural in-ference is not a full-fledged inference and that, as it functions induc-tively, it lacks the certainty (niscaya) which a real inference should have.In the Pramdnavdrttika, at PV I, k. 213-17 and the Svavrtti (PVSV),Dharmaklrti develops the major points of his account of scripturallybased inference:(a) PV I, k. 213: words do not have any necessary connec-tion with entities; they just enable us to infer the inten-tion of the speaker.(b) PV I, k. 214: scriptures are worth investigating whenthey are coherent, present appropriate, praticable meth-ods for gaining results, and when they focus on goalswhich are relevant to the spiritual \"goals of man\"(pumsdrtha).(c) PV I, k. 215 presents the threefold analysis (describedabove) which one applies to scriptures worth investi-gating.(d) PV I, k. 216: Dignaga's point in saying that authorita-tive words are an inference was that when an authority's"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEwords (= scripture) have been found to be non-belyingon rationally decidable matters, then we are justified tounderstand radically inaccessible matters based on thatscripture.

This one \"exception\" to k.213 must be allowed because otherwise there would beno way (agatyd) for us to come to know radically inac-cessible things.(e) PV I, k. 217 elaborates upon aspects of k. 216: when thescripture is non-belying on important rationally acces-sible things it should also be so on the inaccessiblethings.The logical status of scriptural inference is then summed up in theSvavrtti to PV I, k. 217: the methods outlined mean that one infersstates of affairs from words, with a resultant lack of strict necessity; theseare not real inferences.PVSV adVN I, k. 217: tadetadagatyobhayathdpy anu-mdnatvam dgamasyopavarnitam I' varam dgamdtpravrttdvevam pravrttir iti I na khalv evcun anumdnam anapdyamandntariyakatvdd arthesu sabddndm iti niveditam etat II'This fact that scripture is an inference is asserted inboth cases [i.e., in PV I, k. 215 and 217] because of thelack of any [other] way.

To this the reply is sim-ply to accept the opponent's objection without reservation. Although thethreefold analysis does not yield certainty, one should not and can notrequire such certainty either. We accept scriptural inference, not be-cause it is a genuine prarndna> but rather to be able to engage in thespiritual path. As Dharmaklrti had put it, \"because there is no otherway\" (agatyd).10 Karnakagomin and Sakyabuddhi adW I, k. 216 areclear on the implications: scriptural inference is an inference because ofthe thought of people (pumso 'bhiprdyavasdt) who want to engage them-selves (pravrttikdma) on the spiritual path; it is not an inference objec-tively (vastutas).nIt looks then that the position of scripture being inference-like-any-other has very little support in Dharmakirti, or in Indian commentatorssuch as Sakyabuddhi or Karnakagomin. And it is not surprising to addthat for these Indian writers scriptural inference is in no way vastubala-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEpravrtta, or objective, either. Scriptural inference, as is amply mentionedin Dharmakirti and his commentators, depends upon abhyupagama,\"acceptance,\" and that in itself is probably sufficient to show that it isnot objective. At any rate, as if that were not enough, they explicitly tellus that it is not objective and not certain.12Now, it is true that both Tsong kha pa and Sakya mchog ldan wereaware of passages in the Svavrtti which seemed to go against their posi-tion on scriptural inference being inference-like-any-other and hencefelt obliged to explain why Dharmakirti in PV I, k. 215—17 spoke ofscripture as not being an authentic inference (rjes dpag mtshan nyidpamayinpa). The move which we see both these Tibetan authors makingis to say that citing the scriptural words lacks certainty and that it wasonly that which Dharmakirti was talking about, as if PV I, k. 215—17and k. 318 were not talking about the actual authentic scriptural infer-ences, but only about quasi-inferences where words are cited to \"prove\"things. The real inference, not surprisingly, turns out to be the proof thatsuch and such a scripture is non-belying because it passes the threefoldanalysis. And this inference is supposedly certain and objective. I don'tthink that this move works at all.Although the argument that words do not prove things is indeedDharmakirtian, I think it is clear that one cannot say that this is theonly point which Dharmakirti was making, and arguably it is not eventhe most telling point against scriptural inference being compelling andcertain.In fact, the threefold analysis constitutes a weak test of scripture, andI think it should be clear that Dharmakirti and his commentators knewit to be weak, not just because of the lack of necessary connections be-tween words and things, but as we see in the Svavrtti to PV 1, k. 318and the commentaries, because of the inherently inductive nature of thewhole procedure. A limited number of observations of correctness doesnot guarantee that we subsequently won't find errors on testable things(nor I suppose would the fact that we don't see internal contradictionsmean that there aren't any). And a limited number of observations onperceptible and inferable matters would not imply or guarantee anythingabout what is radically inaccessible. What emerges from the Svavrtti tok. 318 and from the commentaries is that the first two stages of thethreefold analysis, where the scripture is tested for correctness on ratio-nally decidable matters, guarantee nothing—they are at most groundsfor thinking that such and such a scripture is as far as we can judge trust-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"HOW MUCH OF A PROOF?  45worthy and to be relied upon. The key phrase, oft-repeated, Is vararndgamdtpravrttdv evam pravrttir: \"If one engages oneself on die basis ofscripture, it is better to engage oneself in this fashion.\" In short, if wemake the move of accepting a scripture's statements on radically inac-cessible matters, it is because we are not, as far as we can judge, precludedfrom doing so and because we want to or need to do so for our spiritualgoals. That is all. What is striking in the Dharmakirtian account, then,is that the threefold analysis does not compel us to accept scripture's ac-counts of radically inaccessible matters in the way in which a normal vas-tubalapravrtta kind of inference does compel us to accept the conclu-sion. Instead of logical compulsion, the Dharmakirtian is making whatcould perhaps best be described as an informed, but fallible, choice.Let us go back to Sakyabuddhi's and Karnakagomin's idea of scripturalinference being a kind of inference, but one due to pumso 'bhiprdyavasah(\"the force of human thought/intentions\"), this being contrasted withfull-fledged inference which is objective (vastntas). What could this phrase\"human thought\" or \"human intentions\" mean? It certainly should notbe taken as a trivialization of the role of scripture, for Dharmaklrti isquite clear that in spite of the problematic logical status of scripturalproof, there is no question about scripture's crucial importance to ourlives: ndyampuruso andsritydgamaprdmdnyam dsitum samartho... \"A man[who wishes to apply himself to spiritual goals] cannot proceed withoutrelying on the validity of scripture...\"13Put the problem another way. If we accepted the Tsong kha pa-Sakyamchog ldan position that scriptural inference was inference-like-any-other and was as objective as the smoke-fire variety, the question as towhy one would believe in a scripture's propositions would become deadsimple. One would perform the requisite threefold analysis and the gamewould be up: rationally there would be no alternative but to accept thescripture's propositions on atyantaparoksa, just as one has to accept thatthe hill has fire once one knows how smoke comes about and once onesees that the hill does indeed have smoke. This simplicity is in a sensewhat some people are attracted to in Dharmaklrti, and not coincidentallythey are often conservative Buddhists or even proselytizers: for them, itis Buddhism's force or even superiority that belief in scripture is whollyrational and logical and that acceptance (abhyupagama) follows easily"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"46  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEand impersonally. But now let us imagine that a Buddhist is not a sub-scriber to the inference-like-any-other scenario, and that he realizes thatthe threefold analysis is fallible, that the inference is not a real one, andthat it is not objective, not certain, etc., etc. Why and how would sucha person, if he is of a Dharmaklrtian bent, nonetheless come to believein scriptural propositions on radically inaccessible states of affairs? Doesahhiprdyavasa mean that after all the Dharmaklrtian account is littlemore than a type of leap of faith? No. I do think the Dharmaklrtian textsin speaking of pravrttikdma (\"desire to engage oneself) and purusdrtha(\"goals of man\") suggest an account which is more subtle than that ofa camouflaged and excessively long path to arrive at a key step that is nomore than blind faith. Briefly stated, Dharmaklrti's version as to whyone chooses to accept a scripture's propositions, after having done thepreliminary three-fold analysis, would seem to be best viewed as a typeof pragmatism, one which is not of an objective or person-indifferentvariety, but one which would take into account the interests and aimsof a specific group of people, those who have an idea of what spiritualgoals are and who wish to attain them. To use Nicholas Reseller's term,it would be a subjective pragmatism, in that it would involve a belief be-ing justified because it leads to (and may even be crucial to) the successof such and such a group of people in their specific aims.14\\Quite a number of years ago, Richard Hayes, in what was for many ofus a veiy thought-provoking article, examined the \"question of doctri-nalism\" amongst Buddhist epistemologists. One way, inter alia, in whichHayes formulated this question was \"whether the Buddhist epistemol-ogists should be characterized primarily as champions of reason or ratheras champions of dogma.\"15 Clearly, as Hayes himself recognized, one ex-tremely important element in a response to these types of questions willbe our account of how rational or dogmatic is the Buddhist's belief inhis own scriptures. Now, if we look at the two types of accounts that wehave described so far, the first, i.e., what we have termed inference-like-any-other, makes an obvious attempt at ensuring rationality by stress-ing the idea of scriptural inference being certain, objective, etc., just ascertain and objective as proving fire on the smoky hill. This attitude hasa natural tendency toward a certain conservatism, even fundamentalismabout scripture, for once the scripture has been determined to pass the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"HOW MUCH OF A PROOF?  47three tests then logically any and all of its propositions on atyantaparoksashould be accepted—there is little or no possibility of a half-way housefor skeptics who might want to accept some but not other such propo-sitions, for all should be necessary, objective and compelling. It is no co-incidence that the Tibetan, and especially dGe lugs pa, use of the ideasof scriptural inference in Dharmakirti has been in such extremely con-servative directions. Equally, it is not surprising that the subjective ele-ments, the pragmatism, the uncertainty, the recognition of the prob-lematic status of scriptural inference have been very much downplayed,in favor of watertight scriptural inferences which rationally must com-pel conviction. Dharmakirti was somehow used to build a dogmaticedifice.What was Dharmakirti's own degree of dogmatism or doctrinalism?Arguably there could be different and much less conservative applicationsof a Dharmaklrtian methodological position on scripturally based in-ferences. The uncertainty and inductive character of scriptural reason-ing might well allow a Buddhist to maintain that some or even manyscriptural passages on karma, cosmology and other subjects need not betaken to be true simply because so much else, or so much else which isimportant, in the scripture seems to be true. There is the possibility thatthese would be precisely the areas where the inductive character of scrip-tural reasoning revealed its weaknesses. Someone could go one step fur-ther. A left-leaning Buddhist might then come to the additional con-clusion that believing in such passages would no longer be of any use ina modern man's spiritual search, and that they could be rationally leftto the past. In fact, I don't think that the interpretation of Dharmakirti'smethodology which I am setting forth does invariably place Dharma-kirti, or even Dharmakirtians, in a left-leaning camp when it comes toapplications. I have above all tried to argue against what I take to be anoverly facile view of his rationality, one which does, in effect, yield a typeof dogmatism in rational garb.

And there is a pragmatism ofthe left, a Jamesian or subjective pragmatism of'What works for X'in proving efficient and effective for the realisation of a particularperson's (or group's) wishes and desires.Note that some type of pragmatism has also often been seen to be behindDharmakirti's theory of vastubalapravrttdnumdna.

As their contributions show, in this research it is not only impor-tant to trace Dharmaklrti's positions as they evolved throughout his ownworks on epistemology and logic, but it is equally necessary to gain asmuch information as possible on the opponents against whom Dharma-kirti argued. And not just the non-Buddhists: we need to collect and an-alyze the fragmentary presentations of the views of the other Buddhistcommentators on Dignaga, positions which Dharmakirti sought to refuteand which often motivated him to formulate his own particular inter-pretation of Dignaga. In what follows, we shall call these latter com-mentators \"pre-Dharmaklrti\" in the sense that their works and ideas wereanterior intellectual influences on Dharmakirti—it does, of course, have tobe allowed that at least some of them might not have been pre-Dharma-kirti in a purely chronological sense and could have been his approximatecontemporaries.1Amongst these pre-Dharmaklrti commentators on Dignaga—none ofwhose actual works survive either in the original or in translation—onestands out fairly clearly: IsVarasena, Dharmaklrti's probable teacher, whowrote a commentary on Dignaga's Pramdnasamuccaya (PS), one againstwhich Dharmakirti repeatedly argued.2 Let us summarize some of the ba-sic elements of recent research on Is'varasena's philosophical stance. Al-though IsVarasena's name is extremely rarely mentioned explicitly in In-dian texts, Steinkellner3 has shown that he was nonetheless spoken of byname by Arcata and Durvekamis'ra in connection with a position on non-perception (anupalabdhi). The position was, namely, that nonperception53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"54  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEof x was just the lack of perception of x (upalabdhyabhdvamdtra), themere fact that one does not see x (adarsanamdtra), and that this consti-tuted a separate means of valid cognition (pramdndntara) for proving xsnonexistence or absence. This position, which was rejected by Dharma-kirti, was linked with an essentially inductive account of valid reasons,where absence of the reason in dissimilar instances (vipaksa) was to beestablished by mere lack of perception. In other words, the general prin-ciple, or pervasion (vydpti), would be established as not having any coun-terexamples merely because one does not see any. This is the positionwhich Dharmakirti went to great pains to reject in Pramdnavdrttika(PV) I, proposing instead a necessary absence of counterexamples basedon a fact in reality, viz., the natural connection (svabhdvapmtibandha)existing between the terms in the inference.Subsequently, in his Hetubindu (HB), Dharmakirti would also argueat length against a theory which held that a valid reason needed six char-acters (sadlaksana), instead of the usual three. While the attribution ofthe sadlaksanahetu doctrine to Is'varasena is still on the level of a rea-sonable hypothesis, unconfirmed by any specific Indian sources, it is atleast corroborated in the indigenous Tibetan commentary on the Pramd-naviniscaya by rGyal tshab dar ma rin chen, where Isvarasena is namedin connection with the sadlaksanahetu doctrine.4 Isvarasena, quite pos-sibly in reply to Dharmaklrti's initial critique, seems to have realizedthat his inductive method of proving the absence of counterexampleswas insufficient, and thus proposed three supplementary criteria for va-lidity,5 all of which were rejected by Dharmakirti. In short, we can thusreasonably assume with Steinkellner that Isvarasena was the major cat-alyst for Dharmaklrti's own interpretation and defense of the triply char-acterized reason (trirupahetu), his notion of natural connections, andhis views on nonperception.6Besides Isvarasena, there were some other, much more obscure, Bud-dhist commentators on Dignaga against whom Dharmakirti consecratedsome of his argumentation: in PV IV, k. 27 and 122 Dharmakirti wasapparently refuting \"a commentator on Dignaga's Nydyarnukha\" (nydya-mukhatikdkdra) whose name is recorded in the Tibetan translation ofthis portion of Sakyabuddhi's Pramdnavdrttikatikd(PVT) as \"Mang polen pa'i bu.\"7 S. Watanabe, in his article on this subject,8 has speculatedthat aMang po len pa'i bu\" might be restored as \"Bahuleya,\" but this isconjectural and both names are, to our knowledge at least, unfindablein any other works. Compounding the mystery somewhat is that"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"PRE-DHARMAKIRTI COMMENTATORS 55Sakyabuddhi seems to have alluded to other commentators on the Nydy-amukhay that is, he spoke of Mang po len pa'i bu la sogspa (= ddi \"andothers\"); and Vibhuticandra's annotations also mention \"the commen-tator on the Nydyamukhaand others.\" Now, there probably waste leastone other major Indian commentator on the Nydyamukha: Chinesesources tell us that Dharmapala commented on the Yin ming lun, whichis the Chinese name for the Nydyamukha? However, this work of Dhar-mapala has not survived in the original, in translation or in fragments,and it is thus impossible to know what its specific positions might havebeen.Much more significant in the fourth chapter of the Pramdnavdrttikais the position of the/a \"commentator on the Pramdnasamuccaya.\" Thispramanasamuccayatikakara—which, as we shall see below, is the way heis repeatedly identified by Dharmaklrti's own commentators—is one ofthe opponents in the large section of PVIV which treats Dignaga's defi-nition of the thesis (paksa; pratijnd) in a logical argument. We can as-sume that we are dealing, once again, with Is'varasena:(a) Is'varasena is, after all, the only pre-Dharmakirti com-mentator on PS that we know of.(b) Especially if the sadlaksanahetu ascription is correct,lsvarasena was particularly influential in the develop-ment of key aspects in several of Dharmaklrti's works,so that it would be no exaggeration to say that many ofthe main elements of Dharmaklrti's thought on logicalmatters developed in a dialectical relationship withlsvarasena.(c) Just as IsVarasena played such an important role in PVI, so too it would be reasonable to assume that he is theone whose ideas recur in PV IV.Let me briefly give the background from Dignaga and some of the mainelements in the section on the thesis in PV IV.

For our purposes it is the definition given inPS III, the chapter on inference-for-others (pardrthdnttmdna) whichconcerns us, for in this chapter Dignaga gave a specification of a num-ber of requirements which a valid thesis should satisfy, each one of whichwas commented upon in extenso by Dharmakirti in PV IV. The defini-tion is as follows:PS III, k. 2: svariipenaiva nirdesyah svayam isto 'nirdkrtah /pratyaksdrthdnumdndptaprasiddhena svadharmini //\"[A validthesis] is one which is intended (ista) by [the proponent] him-self (svayam) as something to be stated (nirdesya) in its properform alone (svariipenaiva) [i.e., as a sddhya]; [and] with re-gard to [the proponent's] own subject (svadharrnin), it is notopposed (anirdkrta) by perceptible objects (pratyaksdrtha), byinference (anumdna), by authorities (dpta) or by what is com-monly recognized (prasiddha).\"11Dignaga himself, in his Pramdnasamuccayavrtti (PSV) on PS III, k.2, commented upon the words svarupenaiva nirdesyah as serving to elim-inate unestablished reasons and examples from being theses, thus sup-posedly insuring that his definition would avoid the faults incurred byrival definitions, such as the pratijndlaksana put forth in Gautama'sNydyasutra 1.1.33.12 The phrase svayam ista, however, eliminated the-ses which were just positions found in a treatise, and which were notthose of the proponent himself. We cite the relevant passage as follows:PSV adVS III, k.2: bdagnyid 'dodpazhes bya ba ni 'disni bstanbcos la mi bltospa'i khas blangs pa bstan pa yin no II \"This[phrase], svayam ista, shows (darsayati) an acceptance (abhy-upagama) which does not rely upon treatises (sdstrdnapeksa)\"XiThe section in PV IV commenting upon the word svayam (PV IV,k. 42-90) contains the most significant argumentation against what canplausibly be presumed to be Isvarasena's positions.

According tothis view, when the proponent seeks to prove that sound is imperma-nent, the reason, \"being produced\" (krtakatva), not only will have toprove impermanence, but should also not contradict any of the proper-ties which the proponent's treatise (in particular, the Vaisesikasutras) as-cribe to sound, such as that it is a \"quality of space\" (dkdsaguna). Now,the argumentation up until PVIV, k. 69 is clearly directed at non-Bud-dhists. As the repeated advocacy of dkdsagunatva and other well-knownVais'esika tenets suggests, we are dealing with an adversary who adheresto basic Nyaya-Vais'esika positions. Equally, then, the adversary's viewon the thesis, or equivalently on \"what is being proven\" (sddhya), mustalso be one which was, broadly speaking, ascribable to the Nyaya-Vais'esika.14 From k. 69 on, however, we see that virtually the same po-sition on the thesis is attributed to a Buddhist, whom Prajnakaraguptaterms \"a commentator on the Pramdnasamuccaya' (pramdnasamucca-yasya vydkhydtr).

What stands out clearly is the fact that the \"com-mentator on the Pramdnasamuccaya did hold the same view on thethesis, or sddhya, as the Nyaya-Vaisesikas against whom Dharmaklrtiargued in the kdrikds preceeding k. 69. Let us from here on, in keepingwith the arguments sketched out above, speak of this commentator onPS as being IsVarasena.It might be, prima facie at least, unclear how Isvarasena's view on thesddhya, as found in PVIV, k. 69 and PVBh adcit., could have been rec-onciled with Dignaga's idea in PSV that the proponent's position shouldnot rely on a treatise (sdstrdnapeksa)—after all IsVarasena does accept thatthe thesis, or sddhya, includes properties mentioned in treatises, andthus is not independent of treatise-based positions. We might, however,reasonably hypothesize that IsVarasena took Dignaga's sdstrdnapeksa asmeaning \"no reliance on treatises which are unaccepted by the propo-nent at the time of the debate.\" This interpretation is borne out fairlywell if we look at the adversary's view discussed in PV IV, k. 72—onceagain Sakyabuddhi's PVT (322a3) identifies him as being a/the \"com-mentator on the Pramdnasamuccaya\" ftshad ma kun las btuspa'i tikdbyedpa --- pramdnasamuccayatlkdkdra)—and as before, Isvarasena seemsby far the most reasonable candidate.

In particular, svayamdid not eliminate #//treatises, but only those which theproponent might have once accepted, but now rejected.(c) Isvarasena thus may well have interpreted PS V's phrasesdstrdnapeksam abhyupagamam darsayati as meaning thatsvayam ista shows a position which does not rely uponany treatises which are not accepted by the proponenthimself at the time of the debate.(d) Dharmakirti took Dignaga's statements in PSV aboutno reliance upon treatises (sdstrdnapeksa) much moreradically: at the time the proponent makes an inferenceconcerning rationally accessible matters he does not relyupon, or even accept, any treatises at all; the positionsin the treatise do not count as being the sddhya; infer-ence which functions by the force of [real] entities (vas-tubalapravrttdnumdna) is completely independent of allscriptures and treatises.17(e) The word svayam does not serve to indicate which trea-tise is to be taken into account to determine the sddhya.It shows that only those properties which the proponentintends to prove himself are the sddhya (see PV IV, k.42). Unrelated properties, which happen to be mentionedin a treatise but are unintended by the proponent in thespecific debate, are irrelevant (see PV IV, k. 56 and 57)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"60  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEThis, then, is what we can glean about the views of the \"commentatoron the Pramdnasamuccaya\" on the thesis-definition, a commentatorwhom we have taken to be Is'varasena.18 If we are right in our identifi-cations and attributions, then a picture of what must have been a com-plex dialectic emerges: Isvarasena seems to have attempted to reconcileDignaga's views in PS III, k. 2 and PSV with an essentially Naiyayikaposition on the sddhya—viz., that the sddhya is not independent of trea-tises. This uneasy combination then led him to a very strained inter-pretation of Dignaga's proviso, svayam. Dharmaklrti, by contrast, sim-plified things and vociferously rejected both those aspects of Is'varasena'sinterpretation of Dignaga. In so doing, he reinforced his general posi-tion in PV that logical argument on rationally accessible matters standsor falls only on its own merits and not because of any appeals to au-thority or tradition.Finally, it is worthwhile to remark that there was probably at least oneother commentator whose views on svayam seem to have served, in somemeasure, to stimulate Dharmakirti's own thought. In PV IV, k. 76 etseq. Dharmakirti argued against an adversary (anya) who maintainedthat svayam was destined to eliminate all treatise-based qualities of thesubject (dharmin). In other words, when we prove sound is imperma-nent, we are speaking only of sound as it is recognized (prasiddha) bycommon individuals, and not of the theoretical entity, \"sound,\" whichis described in the Vaisesikasutras as being a quality of space (dkdsaguna):according to this adversary, svayam insures that the dharmin is indeedprasiddha. Dharmakirti's reply in PV IV, k. 77 is that elimination of\"theoretical,\" and hence not commonly recognized, dharmim is at anyrate already presupposed in any debate on whether a dharmin has theproperty to be proved (sddhyadharma). As soon as it is understood thatthe dharmin is not the commonly recognized real entity, the debate willsimply cease. Hence, svayam, if explained as assuring commonly recog-nized dharmim, would perform no needed function at all.19It is far from clear who /A/V adversary was: the commentators say noth-ing.

This dis-cussion begins at PV IV, k. 91-92, where Dharmakirti gives a general expla-nation of the need to include the provision anirdkrta (\"not opposed\") andpresents the four types of possible opposition, viz., by perceptible objects(pratyaksdrtha), inference (amimdna), authorities (dpta, i.e., scriptures or theproponent's own words) and wbiat is commonly recognized (prasiddha). De-vendrabuddhi (PVP 342b8), commenting on k. 92, spoke of \"some people'('ga' zhig) who seem to have interpreted the compound pratyaksdrthdmimd-ndptaprasiddhena differently—Sakyabuddhi then identifies them as commen-tators on PS:PVT 325a 1: 'dir yang 'ga' zhig ces by a ba ni tshad ma kun las btuspa 'i tikd byed pa dag ste I de dag ni tshiggsum zlas dbye ba by as nasrab tu gragspa 7 sgra dang Igsurnpa 'i de V skyes bur khas ten cinggragspa / sgra yang re re la mngon par sbyor bar byed do II.The explanation in PVP and PVT is frustratingly brief and obscure, but itseems that the \"commentators on PS\" held that prasiddha qualified thedvandva compound pratyaksdrtha-anumdna-dpta, \"what is commonly recog-nized through pratyaksdrtha, amimdna, and dpta.\" The whole compound be-comes an instrumental tatpurusa.

Specifically, if we take a typical pardrthdnumdnasuch as, \"Whatever is produced is impermanent, like a vase. Now, soundis produced,\" the point of this logical form is not to show an actual de-duction of the conclusion, \"Sound is impermanent,\" but rather to showonly those elements which would prove such a deduction. In short apardrthdnumdna only presents the \"provers\" (sddha?ia) of a conclusion orthesis, viz., the triply characterized reason (trirupahetu; trirupalinga), asit is only that which has the \"power\" to prove.3 It presents these sddhana,however, in a very specific way: to take the above-mentioned case, thepardrthdnumdna shows that the reason \"producthood\" (krlakatva) is avalid prover in that the universal implication, or \"pervasion\" (vydpti),holds, as does the specific case at hand, the so-called paksadharmatva, or\"fact that the reason is a quality of the subject.\"In any case—so I argued in 1984 on the basis of Dharmaklrti and hiscommentators—a thesis will never prove itself or even contribute in theslightest to its own proof and thus is not considered a sddhana by Dhar-maklrti: it is therefore important for Dharmaklrti that the thesis-statement(paksavacana) be absent from a well-formed pardrthdnumdna.

Such was my argumentin 1984 against treating a pardrthdnumdna as a syllogism and so it re-mains in philosophical and logical discussions on the theme of pardr-thdnumdna versus syllogisms. In such discussions, as we shall see below,we make a justifiable gain in simplicity by dealing with the final devel-oped form of the pardrthdnumdna, i.e., the form to which Dignaga's andDharmakirti's earlier thought was tending.The historical question as to when exactly the thesis-statement was de-finitively banned from pardrthdnumdnasy however, is more complicatedthan I had thought in 1984. The present: article will provide some evi-dence to show that the case for Dignaga in the Pramdnasamuccaya (PS)and Dharmakirti in his early works is probably somewhat different fromwhat I, or the Dharmaklrtian commentators, made it out to be. Dhar-makirti himself seems to have changed his position from that of his ear-lier works, such as Pramdnavdrttika and Nydyabindu, to that of his laterHetubindu and Vddanydya. In fact, it is really in the Vddanydya that theprohibition on thesis-statements is at its most clear and absolute—therehe stresses that since the statement of a thesis (pratijndvacana) is useless(vyartha), then presenting such a thesis or conclusion in the statementof a sddhana (sddhanavdkya) is a \"point of defeat,\" or nigrahasthdnay forthe proponent.4While I'm not a partisan of the current tendency to exaggerate the dif-ferences between Dignaga's and Dharmakirti's philosophies—e.g., Idon't believe that Dharmakirti \"washed away Dignaga's philosophicalaccomplishments\"5—I do think that here on the question of the mem-bers of'a pardrthdnumdna, Dharmakirti inherited an inelegant and overlycomplicated position from his master, one which did nonetheless con-tain a number of core ideas that Dharmakirti, over time, struggled withand tried to unravel and simplify. Unfortunately, some of Dharmakirti'sown commentators, such as Prajnakaragupta and Santaraksita, in truescholastic fashion, attempted to show that Dharmakirti's (later) viewwas completely consonant with the textual evidence in Dignaga. In otherwords, Prajnakaragupta et al. wished to show that Dharmakirti's viewwas unoriginal and already wholly present in PS.

This is PS III, k. led:tatrdnumeyanirdeso hetvarthavisayo matah I. \"In this regard,the presentation of the inferendum is held to concern the goalof the reason.\"He invokes this passage in PV IV, k. 18ab,6 and interprets it quite cor-rectly as showing that thesis-statement has no power to prove anything,i.e., that it is not a sddhana, an interpretation which, no doubt, fits wellwith what Dignaga himself says in the Pramdnasamuccayavrtti:PSV adPS III, k. led: yan lag rnams nasgang rjes su dpagparby a ba bstan pa de ni kho bo caggi sgrub byed nyid du mi 'dodde I de nyid the tshom skyedpar byed pa 'iphyir ro II (Kitagawa:471.5-7) \"Amongst the members, the presentation of the in-ferendum is not held by us to be a sddhana, for it engendersdoubt.\"Nonetheless, PV IV, k. 18's interpretation of PS III, k. led is a far cryfrom justifying the later Dharmakirtian view in Vddanydya that the the-sis-statement should not be in a pardrthdnumdna. In other words, it isclear that in PS Dignaga did not consider the thesis-statement as beinga sddhana, but nevertheless he most likely allowed its presence in a. pardr-thdnumdna—we shall see more on this below. Dharmakirti, in theVddanydya, seems to have gone one step further on his own in sayingthat if the thesis-statement is not a sddhana it should not be in apardrthdnumdna. How much Dharmakirti was conscious that this ad-ditional step was his own is difficult to say. At any rate, his discussionin PV of Dignaga's actual words can, with little difficulty, be taken asshowing that he realized that Dignaga in PS only went so far as to denythat the thesis-statement is a sddhana.7 Indeed, I now think that thereare good reasons for thinking that Dharmakirti in PV held this same po-sition.In a recent study on the notion of paksdbhdsa (\"fallacies of the thesis\")in pre-Dignaga logicians, Dignaga and Dharmakirti, Masahiro Inami"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEhas shown that the use of the paksavacana can be profitably comparedwith the development of the closely related concept ofpaksdbhdsa* In-ami is of the opinion that Dharmaklrti in PV, the PVin and the NB ad-hered to the same position as Dignaga in PS III, i.e., he permitted thepresence of a thesis, all the while denying that it had any status as asddhana. In this phase Dharmaklrti, like Dignaga before him, also stillaccepted paksdbhdsa, as we see by the discussions in PV IV, PVin III andNB III. The ban on thesis-statements comes later in the Hetubindu (HB)and Vddanydya (VN) and coincides with his rejection of the theory ofpaksdbhdsa.Inami's account is, I think, correct, as it seems reasonable to assumethat there must be a correlation between the acceptance and rejectionof paksdbhdsa and that of the thesis-statement. After all, it is incongru-ous to give an account of paksdbhdsa in a chapter on pardrthdnumdnaand yet maintain that the thesis-statement can under no circumstancesbe given in such a logical form! I might remark, though, that in prac-tice, when Dharmaklrti gives actual pardrthdnumdna in texts such asPV IV, k. 22; NB III, 8, 21, 23, etc.; and PVin III, he does not give the-ses, but only presents a two-membered form. The \"permissibility\" ofthesis-statements, then, is at most a theoretical possibility for Dharma-klrti at this stage, but one which he himself did not, to my knowledge,avail himself of in his own argumentation.Now, Inami's account—to which I am heavily indebted—could besupplemented with one of the motivation behind Dharmakirti's evolu-tion. There seem to be two basic motivations. One is Dharmakirti'sview (from his early works on) that the thesis is known by arthdpatti(\"presumption\") and is hence unnecessary in the pardrthdnumdna. WhereasDignaga in PS stresses that the thesis is not a sddhana, but that it maybe stated to show the \"goal of the reason,\" i.e., the proposition whichthe argument is about, Dharmaklrti goes one step further in suggestingthat this proposition is at any rate indirectly known by means of thestatement of the vydpti and paksadharmatva in a pardrthdnumdna. Pro-gressively he realizes that Dignaga's function for the thesis-statement interms of hetvarthavisayatva is usurped by the indirect knowledge stem-ming from hearing the two other members. In fact, he gives various for-mulations explaining just how the conclusion can be known from thepardrthdnumdna: in PV IV, k. 22 he uses the term arthdt (\"by implica-tion\"); in NB he speaks of sdmarthydt; and in PVin IIP we find him us-ing arthdpattyd (Tib. dongyis go bas). Indeed, what seems to be at stake"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"PARARTHANUMANA, THESES AND SYLLOGISMS 73is \"presumption\" (arthdpatti)—the conclusion is \"presumed' from thetwo statements in the pardrthdnumdna in that these two statementscould not both be true unless the conclusion were also.10 But what is ofinterest for us here is that it seems that it was the fact that the thesis wasknown indirectly from the other two statements in a pardrthdnumdnawhich was one of the driving forces behind Dharmakirti's own changesof position. In PV IV, PVin, and NB Dharmakirti probably took theview that the thesis-statement was dispensable because known by im-plication, but that it could be used and could have paksdbhdsa. Later,from the HB on, it was the same fact of sdrnarthya which led him to viewthesis-statements as completely redundant and to abandon talk of them(and paksdbhdsa) altogether.HB 5.23—24: atra sdmar\\hydd evapratijndrthasyapratiter napratij naydh pray ogah /\"Here, because the thesis is known justsimply by implication there is no need for the thesis.\"The other driving force for abandoning the thesis-statement completelywas the fact, already recognized by Dignaga, that the thesis-statementis not a sddhana. This is evident in the progression from the argumen-tation in PV IV to VN 59, 8-9 where it is argued that the thesis-state-ment is not a sddhana and that its presence is a point of defeat in that itstates something useless.11By way of a contrast with this evolutionary view of Dignaga and Dhar-makirti's development let us briefly look at some of Dharmakirti s com-mentators. Their view on Dharmakirti, which would become the receivedinterpretation in later Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, was that Dharmakirti'sposition did not evolve from PV to VN: the thesis-statement was com-pletely inadmissable. Not only that, but they maintained that Dignagain PS had no role at all for the thesis-statement either. Let us for conve-nience term Prajnakaragupta's and Santaraksita's interpretation of Dig-naga, the \"Dharmakirtian commentators' interpretation.\" This inter-pretation where one seeks to impose the Vddanydya-Hetuhindti positionon Dignaga is, 1 now think, untenable.

Katsura 1981, 5.5; Tuccip. 44) and Dignaga's PSV on PS IV, k. 6 is identicalwith NM's own explanation of NM, k. 13.While the Dharmaklrtian commentators' view that the thesis-state-ment must be excluded finds no hard evidence in Dignaga, there is, bycontrast, considerable hard textual evidence to show that Dignaga inthe NM and PS did allow a place for the thesis-statement in a pardr-thdnumdna. The degree of obligatoriness is, however, different. Aboutthe NM, there is no question that at this stage Dignaga held that thethesis should be a member of a pardrthdnumdna, for it was a sddhanawhich, if left out, would bring about the fallacy of the sddhana knownas \"incompleteness\" (nyunatd).u In PS and PSV it is clear, as we sawabove, that Dignaga no longer considers the thesis-statement a sddhanaand that he has redefined nyunatd to concern only the statement of thecharacteristics of the reason.15 The result is that to avoid nyunatd, thereis now no obligation to present a thesis.

The statement of theexample is to show that the [reason] has a necessary connec-tion with the inferendum (anumeya). One states the thesis-statement in order to show the inferendum [itself].\"16Dharmakirti's commentators on his PV IV, k. 18 were obviouslytroubled by the fact that k. 18 seemed in contradiction with Dignaga'sPS IV, k. 6, and they devised various tortuous explanations to resolvethe apparent contradiction so that they could continue to maintain thatDignaga completely rejected the thesis-statement. These types of explan-ations might have been possible for PS IV, k. 6 taken in isolation, butthey become extremely problematic in the light of PSV. The coup degr&ce, however, comes from the fact that PS IV, k. 6, along with thequoted passage (and more) from the PSV, is also found in Dignaga's ear-lier work, the Nydyamukha?1 and that in NM's system the thesis-state-ment does indeed figure in a pardrthdnumdna. Now, we cannot reasonablyinterpret NM k. 13ff. along the lines of Dharmakirti's commentators,but have to take it as showing that the thesis is stated. Hence, either thesame passages would have to mean two radically different things in twodifferent texts of Dignaga—an unlikely prospect—or Prajnakaragupta'sand Santaraksita's approaches are impossible.In short, as typically happens in Indian philosophy, commentatorsare reluctant to admit that there was an evolution and an historical de-velopment of certain notions. If, however, we take a more evolutionaryview, we should get the following result: True, Dignaga did make achange in his positions in NM and PS on the questions of the thesis-statement being a sddhana and the fallacy of nyunatd being incurred ifit is absent, but in PS he still kept some holdovers from his earlier views.Specifically, the lack of a thesis-statement ceases to be a criticizable fal-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"PARARTHANUMANA, THESES AND SYLLOGISMS 77lacy in PS, but nonetheless, there is still a theoretical justification for stat-ing a thesis in a pardrthdnumdna. Dharmakirti initially inherited thisview (although in his actual practice of pardrthdnumdna he never actu-ally stated theses), but then moved gradually to simplify Dignaga's in-elegant theoretical stance.SyllogismsWhat implications does this revised version of the history of paksava-cana have for our philosophical comparison between pardrthdnumdnaand syllogisms? A catalyst for the present reflections is a recent book byV. A. van Bijlert, who makes three basic criticisms of my 1984 article:(a) Dignaga did accord some |)lace for the thesis-statement in a pardr-thdnumdna; (b) hence, my anti-syllogism polemic is unfounded or toostrong; (c) there are significant similarities between the Buddhist pardr-thdnumdna and Aristotelian syllogisms.18 Van Bijlert's book is a generallyvaluable contribution and raises some interesting questions concerningthe specific problem of pardrthdnumdna. In effect, I think that the abovediscussion and Inami's paper show that van Bijlert is basically right onthe first point.ly The errors in his second and third points should becomeclearer below.To take up (b), the revised historical account of paksavacana in pardr-thdnumdna does not change my earlier point that the thesis-expression,contrary to the conclusion in a syllogism, is fundamentally irrelevant inan inference-for-others. In fact, the basic metalogical views In PS andPV concerning what is and is not a sddhana already implied that the the-sis-statement was a more or less useless appendage, although it tookDharmakirti some reflection to actually arrive at the explicit positionthat it was thoroughly useless and should be banned. In making a logi-cal comparison between pardrthdnumdna and syllogisms, then, I wouldmaintain that we can profitably disregard the tortuous historical processthat it took for the Buddhist writers to work out the implications oftheir own key ideas. If we wish to speak of\"a pardrthdnumdna as a logicalform and make philosophical analyses about what is and is not crucialto it, we do better to speak about the fully developed form where theextraneous elements, such as the useless paksavacana, have been con-sciously eliminated. In discussions on comparative logic there is a cer-tain justifiable simplicity in relegating the Buddhists' actual discovery of"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"78  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEtheir own implicit notions to the domain of an extremely long footnote.Let us now look at van Bijlert's remarks on (c), the so-called similar-ities which make it appropriate for us to use the term \"syllogism\" forpardrthdnwndna. My critic first gives a paraphrase of Aristotle's defini-tion of the syllogism—\"a discourse in which from certain propositionsthat are laid down something other than what is stated follows of ne-cessity.\"20 For the rest of the argument let me cite the relevant passagefrom van Bijlert (1989: 89-90):What is important here [in Aristotle's definition of the syllo-gism In the Prior Analytics] is that from general true proposi-tions another proposition generally follows. If this general no-tion is kept in mind, we are able to see the correspondence ofthis with the pardrthdnumdna, for in the latter the drstdntafunctions as a proposition enunciating a general fact whilethe hetu enunciates a particular fact. The thing that was an-nounced for proof follows from both propositions.Van Bijlert, in brief, is emphasizing that in a pardrthdnumdna too, \"thething that was announced for proof follows from both propositions.\" In-deed it does. But that is relatively trivial and was certainly not the pointI was driving at. What is important for us—as I insisted in 1984—is theway in which syllogisms and pardrthdnumdna are evaluated. Let us takethis up again from a slightly different angje.First of all, most of Aristotle's key discussion of syllogisms in the PriorAnalyticsand in particular that concerning the syllogistic figures is com-prehensible only if we include the conclusion with the premises in a syl-logism. We get sentences like \"If A [is predicated] of no B, and B of allC, it is necessary that A will belong to no C\" where syllogism is said tooccur and other cases where syllogism is said to fail to occur. We cannotunderstand these occurrences of syllogisms or non-occurrences, or \"syllo-gistic necessity\" (to use Lukasiewicz's gloss on the word avayiai figur-ing in syllogisms), without taking into account the conclusion. Take thesyllogism's three figures, which William and Martha Kneale simplify as:(I)  (ID  (HI)A-B  M-N  n-IBzT  M-E  P-EA-r  N-5  n-P"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"PARARTHANUMANA, THESES AND SYLLOGISMS 79(Here letters show the skeleton of general statements which can be affir-mative or negative, universal or particular in accordance with the Squareof Opposition. The variables are term variables.21) Again it makes no senseto evaluate figures in terms of syllogistic necessity unless we specify whichconclusion we are speaking about. Now, I realize that some writers likeLukasiewicz and Bochenski have preferred to take syllogisms as mater-ial implications along the lines of \"if P and Qthen /?.\" In other words,we are not speaking about validity, as in inferences, but rather of thetruth or falsity of a sentence. Dr. T.J. Smiley once proposed the inter-esting solution that the syllogism be seen as a type of formal deduction,viz., a finite series of well-formed formulae satisfying certain specificconditions. Thus the syllogism would have to be the ordered triple<P, Q,R>.22 At any rate, whatever analysis we adopt, the conclusion is ob-viously an integral part of the syllogism. This, then, was my point in say-ing in my 1984 article (87): \"un syllogisme, quelle que soit notre manierede l'analyser, doit avoir une conclusion.\"I can imagine that at this point someone schooled in traditional logicmight argue that all this only serves to show that actually it is the en-thymeme (viz., a syllogism-like form where one member is missing)which is a better candidate for a parallel with pardrthdnumdna. Specifi-cally, it might be argued that a pardrthdnumdna is like what older logictext-books23 would call \"an enthymeme of the third order\"—those inwhich the conclusion is the omitted member. This is typically used incases of innuendo. E.g.,Cowardice is always contemptible, and this was clearly a caseof cowardice.24Actually shifting to enthymemes changes virtually nothing, for they aresimply truncated syllogisms whose necessity is to be judged by that of acorresponding elaborated form. The usual textbook explanation is thatwe must first determine which member has been omitted, restore it,and then evaluate things in the usual syllogistic fashion: \"if the syllogismthereby constructed is formally valid, the original enthymeme is valid,if the syllogism is formally invalid, the original enthymeme is invalid.\"25So, to be blunt, enthymemes are a red herring for this discussion andcan best be disregarded.Now, contrast all this with the Buddhist pardrthdnumdna as we findit already in Dignaga's PS, all of Dharmakirti and certainly in post-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"80  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEDharmaklrti logicians, where the \"validity\" of the reason and of thepardrthdnumdna which exhibits that reason is not a matter of whetheror not the conclusion follows, but whether the vydpti and paksadhar-matva hold. (I am aware that the term \"validity\" in this Buddhist con-text is not used in the same way as in formal logic, and indeed that thereis no term in Buddhist languages which corresponds fully to the term\"validity\" in Western writing on logic. When we speak of \"valid reasons\"in Buddhist logic, we are speaking about saddhetu, rtagsyarig dag, liter-ally \"real reasons\" or \"good reasons.\" [See chapter 5, n. 40.]) If we wantto judge a pardrthdnumdna s merits, the main question is whether thereason possesses the triple characterization (trairupya): we can and dojudge a pardrthdnumdna without even examining the \"necessity\" of its\"conclusion\" at all. Granted in PS and the earlier works of Dharmaklrtithe thesis may be present, with the result that a pardrthdnumdna can bejudged faulty if there are paksdbhdsa. But this was little more than aninessential transitional stage. The gradual elimination of the notion ofpaksdbhdsa and the growing realization of the redundancy of thesis-statements indicate just how little logical role they played. The stream-lined version of the pardrthdnumdna captures all the essential featureswhich Buddhist logic demanded of it. Nor does the arthdpatti-versionof the way in which a conclusion \"follows\" from the pardrthdnumdnain any way contradict my fundamental point: we can come to know thetruth of the conclusion by arthdpatti, but in order to evaluate a pardr-thdnumdna, the conclusion plays no indispensable logical role.So, looking deeper at the respective ways to evaluate syllogisms andDharmakirtian pardrthdnumdnas we see that the conclusion has a com-pletely different importance in the two sorts of logical forms. This is, inturn, connected with the fact that syllogisms and pardrthdnumdna playvery different roles in widely differing accounts of argumentation, theformer providing a type of derivation (a la T.J. Smiley), the latter merelygiving a perspicuous presentation of the triply characterized reason,nothing more than a preliminary step to inferring a conclusion.In short, the whole PS, Dharmakirtian and post-Dharmakirtian ac-count of pardrthdnumdna is principally governed by their peculiar ac-count of sddhana—something totally foreign to Aristotle—and it is inthat sense that we could say that the fundamental incommensurabilitybetween between syllogisms and pardrthdnumdna stems from two dif-ferent philosophies of logic, or metalogics. The supposed similarity be-tween Aristotelian syllogisms and the Dharmakirtian pardrthdnumdna"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"PARARTHANUMANA, THESES AND SYLLOGISMS 8lis only correct, then, in a trivial sense. No doubt, conclusions do followfrom pardrthdnumanas: they are forbidden in the statement of the pardr-thdnumdna itself not because they are non-sequitim, but for metalogi-cal considerations about sddhana, i.e., about how logic works.In my 1984 article I insisted upon this incommensurability betweensyllogisms and pardrthdmimdna not out of nit-picking compulsion fordetail, but rather because if we satisfy ourselves with superficial similar-ities of the sort which van Bijlert presents we blur the philosophicallyinteresting points where Buddhist logic is suigeneris. Thus we precludemeaningful, informed attempts at comparative philosophy and contentourselves with a few platitudes. Naturally, if someone wishes to use theword \"syllogism\" in a new sense and is conscious that the pardrthd-numdna is very different from an Aristotelian syllogism, I'll give himthe word. There's clearly no hata here in adhering to Humpty Dumpty'sphilosophy of language and letting a word mean \"just what we chooseit to mean—neither more nor less.\"26 Far be it from me to prevent writ-ers on Buddhist logic from using \"syllogism\" in their own way, just asthey use \"epistemology\" to categorize what Dharmaklrti and companydid, even though that use of the term bears little resemblance to West-ern notions of \"epistemology\" or \"Erkenntnistheorie,\" terms which weredeveloped by neo-Kantians in the nineteenth century.27 But unfortu-nately, our secondary literature from Vidyabhusana to Stcherbatsky andonward to van Bijlert is full of evidence that people ^//Windeed seepardr-thdnumdna as being a kind of quasi-Aristotelian syllogism.

For one who does not accept this first basis of reliance,the paksadharmatas definition will be problematic.15(b) The opponent would be unable to term homologous examples (mthundpe = sddharmyadrstdnta) \"sapaksa'\" because the latter would alsoinclude the subject—and the subject is a fortiori not a homologousexample.

We shall return tothis point later on, but for the moment let us without further ado lookat some aspects of the dGe lugs view.Sapaksa Taken Etymologicallyand Sapaksa Properly Speaking'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa'i rdo rje ngag dbang brtson 'grus (1648-1721),in his rtags rigs textbook, introduces a distinction between sapaksa takenin the etymological sense (sgra bshaddu juggi mthun phyogs) and sapaksaproper. Sapaksa taken etymologically are those items which are similarto the subject in possessing the sddhyadharma, while vipaksa taken ety-mologically are all those items which are not similar from this point ofview.18 In effect, then, the sapaksa spoken about in the above quotesfrom the Pramdnasamuccaya and the Tarkabhdsd could—following 'Jam"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA   93dbyangs bzhad pa's views—be taken as showing sapaksa explained in itsetymological sense. For that type of sapaksa, the corollary of (1) mightvery well follow, although 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa himself does not sayanything either for or against.At any rate, sapaksa properly speaking, which is what must figure inthe definition of the anvayavydpti, is something quite different. Takingthe sound-impermanent reasoning as a basis, he defines sapaksa as whatis not void (mi stong) of the sddhyadharma, and vipaksa as what is void.He then goes on to say that sapaksa for proving sound's impermanenceis co-extensive (don gcig) with impermanence, whereas vipaksa for thisproof is co-extensive with non-impermanence (mi nag pa ma yin pa)PLater dGe lugs pa logic manuals, such as that of Yongs 'dzin phur bulcog byams pa tshul khrims rgya mtsho (1825—1901), have similar de-finitions. Yongs 'dzin rtags rigsl for example, states:The definition of sapaksa for proving sound's impermanence is:What, in keeping with the proof mode (bsgrub tshul) for estab-lishing sound's impermanence, is not void of impermanence.20\"Proof mode\" here simply refers to the verbs yin (yin bsgrub) or yod (yodbsgrub). Thus, for example, if one is establishing that fire exists (meyod),then the sapaksa will be all those places where fire exists (yod) ratherthan all cases which are (yin) fire.21We can, then, summarize 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa and Yongs 'dzinphur bu lcog's characterization of sapaksa and vipaksa proper as follows:For all x:xis a sapaksa for proving sound's impermanence if andonly if x is impermanent. For all x: x is a vipaksa for provingsound's impermanence if and only if xis not impermanent.Now, given this view of sapaksa proper, 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa clearlydoes not agree that sapaksa must exclude the subject. And moreover thistype of (proper) sapaksa will bear only limited resemblance to the sapaksaof points (1) and (2), viz., sapaksa taken etymologically. In fact, 'Jamdbyangs bzhad pa and Yongs 'dzin phur bu lcog both devote a numberof pages in their rtags rigs texts to show that the two types of sapaksastand in a \"three point\" (mugsum) relationship.22 What this comes downto is that \"sapaksa taken etymologically for proving [some proposition]P\" (de sgy^ub kyi mthun phyogs kyi sgra bshad du jug pa) is a proper sub-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEset of \"sapakfa for proving P\" (de sgrub kyi mthunphyogs). (Here it mightbe useful to remark that Tibetan logic texts have means to express in-dividual and propositional variables: khyod (\"you\") can be used in amanner similar to our individual variables x, y, z, etc., whereas de (\"that\")is used as a variable ranging over propositions or states of affairs, muchin the same way as P, Q, R, etc. are used in formal logic. This is why Ihave translated de sgrub kyi... as \".. .for proving P\" rather than a strictlyliteral \".. .for proving that.\")Let us, then, represent the relationship between the two types ofsapaksa for proving Pby means of the following diagram, all the whilestressing that P can be any proposition one wishes so long as it is thesame in both cases.A = the claSvS of sapaksa taken etymologically for proving P; B = the classof sapaksa (proper) for proving P.The question naturally arises as to what Indian textual support, ifany, can be found for this dGe lugs pa vifew on sapaksa proper. It is in-teresting to see that in this context 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa cites a well-known line from the Nydyabindu (NB II, 7), one which also occurs inthe Nydyapravesa.1* The Sanskrit and Tibetan are as follows:sddhyadharmasdmdnyena samdno 'rthah sapaksah IImthun phyogs ni bsgrub par bya ba V chos kyi spyi dang donmthun pa 'o ll2iThe usual interpretation of this verse—as we see, for example, inStcherbatsky (1930), Tachikawa (1971) and Gillon and Love (1980)—is to read the instrumental sddhyadharmasdmdnyena as meaning\"through...\" or \"by...\" or \"insofar...\" I might remark in passing thatalthough these authors prefer to take sdmdnyahsxe. in its sense of \"same-ness,\" it would seem to me better to take it as meaning \"universal,\" in"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA   95the technical sense of the noun, all the more so because Dharmottaraclearly contrasts it with visesa:Now, what is to be proved is not a particular (visesa), butrather, a universal. Thus, here, he says that it is a universalwhich is to be proved.25If, following Dharmottara, we take the compound sddhyadharmasdmd-nyeita as a karmadhdraya, it would then be better translated as somethingalong the lines of \"on account of the universal which is the sddhya-dharma\"2* and with this amendment the translation of NB II, 7 wouldbecome:Sapaksa are things which are similar [to the subject, i.e., thepaksa] on account of [possessing] the universal which is thesddhyadkarma.So taken, NB II, 7 would seem like a perfect specification of what thedGe lugs pa have been calling \"sapaksa taken etymologically\"—how-ever, that is not what 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa seems to take it to meanat all. Here the divergence of interpretations is understandable if wecompare the Sanskrit and its Tibetan translation. The Tibetan has (in-stead of the instrumental) ... dang don mthun pa, which can only betranslated as \"an object similar to ...\" Thus, translating the Tibetan ofNB II, 7 we get:Sapaksa are objects which are similar to the universal whichis the sddhyadharma.'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa, using the technical language of debate andmtshan nyid, argues that this verse shows that sapaksa (proper) includesboth the \"exclusion-universal\" (spyi Idog) of the sddhyadharma and allthat is similar to it, viz., the \"exclusion-bases\" (gzhi Idog).21 These aretechnical terms in dGe lugs pa philosophy, and although a satisfactoryexplanation would necessitate an excursus into apoha theory, for ourpurposes the point can be expressed in simpler terms: sapaksa includesthe sddhyadharma universal itself and everything which has this univer-sal. The subject can also be a sapaksa.But basically, though, to make a long story short, I do not think that"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"96  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEwe can easily side with 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa in interpreting NB II, 7.Although there is nothing in Vinitadeva's commentary on theNydyabindu which would exclude such an interpretation (the Sanskritis not extant, and the Tibetan naturally speaks of ...dang don mthunpa), Dharmottara's commentary does not support it; in fact, Dharmot-tara clearly justifies a translation such as that of Stcherbatsky, et aL, dulyamended.28 In short, although 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa himself seems tofind his textual grounding in NB II, 7,1 think that we will have to lookelsewhere.29Curiously enough, it is Sa skya pandita who provides the clue as tothe Indian precedents for the dGe lugs pa position. (I say \"curiously\"because the dGe lugs pa are of course post-Sa pan.) Recall that earlieron, when we were discussing Sa pan's position, we spoke of a view whichheld that sapaksa and vipaksa are directly contradictory, that all exis-tents are classifiable as either one or the other, and that sapaksa andvipaksa are respectively to be defined as what does or does not posses thesddhyadharma. Now, in the Rigs gter rang 'grel, Sa skya pandita explicitlystates that these definitions of sapaksa and vipaksa—and hence also theother two points, which follow from such definitions—were acceptedby \"certain people who followed the teacher Santipa\" (= Ratnakaras'anti,a tenth to eleventh-century thinker who formulated the position of \"in-trinsic entailment\" (antarvydpti)).30Indeed it is true that Ratnakaras'anti himself did put forward theseparticular definitions; they can be found in his Antarvydptisamarthana?1Moreover, it turns out that the dGe lugs pa definitions, along with theirconsequences, are identical to those of the Antarvyaptivadins. Although'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa and Yongs 'dzin phur bu lcog had phrased thingsa little differently, using the terms \"non-voidness\" and \"voidness,\" it doescome down to the same position. And interestingly enough, a few linesfurther on in the Rigs gter rang 'grel, we see that Sa pan himself speaksabout certain people who took sapaksa as being what is not void of thesddhyadharma, and vipaksa as being what is void: he says flatly that thisis nothing different from the other formulation (de nyidlas ma 'das so)?1It can be determined with reasonable certainty that some post-Sa panthinkers, such as Nya dbon kun dga' dpal, did subscribe toRatnakarasanti's views on Antarvyaptivada. Se ra rje btsun chos kyi rgyalmtshan quotes passages from the Nya tlkd—which is most likely Kundga' dpal's now lost commentary on the Pramdnavdrttika—where thelatter author endorses Ratnakaras'anti's views.33 However, concerning"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA   97the pre-Sa pan Antarvyaptivadins, whom Go rams pa characterizes as\"various early scholars,\" I am unable to ascertain who they were.What is noteworthy, though, is that while the An tarvyap tivada defi-nitions of sapaksa and vipaksa seem to have found their way into the dGelugs pa school, the cardinal tenet of antarvydpti did not.34 Ramakarasancihad argued that for the intelligent examples were not necessaiy to as-certain the anvayavydpti—it could be ascertained in the subject—andsimilarly, the fallacy of asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu was only for dullards.Now, the dGe lugs pa do not subscribe to that. In fact, as can be seenfrom a passage from rGyal tshab rje which I have translated and in-cluded as an appendix, the dGe lugs pa came down squarely on the sideof the traditional view of \"extrinsic entailment\" (bahirvydpti), whichmaintained that examples were necessary and that the fallacy of asddhd-randnaikdntikahetuwas inescapable in the case of certain types of reasons.It is probably fair to say that as a unified, coherent system, Antarvyap-tivada caused no more than a few ripples in Tibet. While some thinkersbefore and after Sa pan probably did consider themselves Antarvyap-tivadins, they were, it seems, the exception. The Sa skya pa generally didnot endorse it, and the dGe lugs pa only subscribed to its views onsapaksa and vipaksa, which, as we shall see, they managed to harmonizewith a version of the asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu.Chos kyi rgyal mtshan on the asadharananaikantikahetuLet us look at a few passages in rNarn 'grelspyi don where Chos kyi rgyalmtshan debates with the Rigs gter ba, the followers of the Tshadma rigspa'i gter. First of all, Chos kyi rgyal mtshan presents Sa skya pandita'sfourfold classification of the different forms of this hetu,35 the first ofthe four being the sound-impermanent-audible case, where, in true or-thodox fashion, Sa pan maintained that the reason was completely ab-sent from both the sapaksa and the vipaksa. Chos kyi rgyal mtshan thenargues that such an asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu just does not exist. Why?I quote:Because if something is an asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu (thunmong ma yin pa'i ma nges pa'i gtan tshig) for proving sound'simpermanence, it must be present in only sapaksa for provingsound's impermanence.36"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEWith a bit of reflection we can see that this does in fact follow from thedGe lugs pa notion o£ sapaksa (proper): if something is co-extensive withsound, then it must be exclusively present in impermanent things, i.e.,in the sapaksa (taken dGe lugs pa-style).Next, we get the Rigs gter ba reply:To that, the followers of the Rigs gter say: \"There is a reasonfor saying that audibility is both completely absent in the sapaksafor proving sound's impermanence and is also completely ab-sent in the vipaksa. For audibility is both completely absentfrom sapaksa [such as] vases for proving sound's imperma-nence, and it is also completely absent in vipaksa [such as]space. Therefore, all the preceding consequences [such as, in-ter alia, the nonexistence of such a type of asddhdrandnaikd-fitikahetu,] do not refute [our position]. For, 'sapaksa (mthunphyogs) for proving sound's impermanence' and Valid homo-logous example (mthun dpeyangdag) for proving sound's im-permanence' are co-extensive (don gcig), and Valid hetero-logous example (mi mthun dpeyang dag)' and 'vipaksa forproving sound's impermanence' are also co-extensive. And[furthermore] if [one says that] there does not exist an uncer-tain reason (ma nges pa'i gtan tshigs = anaikdntikahetu) forproving sound's impermanence which is absent in the respec-tive sapaksa and is also absent in the respective vipaksa-, thenthere would be the fault that the text [i.e., the Pramdna-samuccaya] which says, 'the paksadharma is present or absentin the sapaksa and so on, could not be accepted literally.\"37To this Chos kyi rgyal mtshan offers two rejoinders. First, the equa-tion between homologous examples and sapaksa is faulty. If they werethe same,then it would follow [absurdly] that a rocky mountain, whichdoes not arise from effort, would be a valid homologous ex-ample for proving a conch sound's impermanence through thereason, 'arisen from effort', because it is a sapaksa in such a proof.After all, a rocky mountain is a sapaksa, because it possesses the sddhya-dharma, impermanence, but it cannot be a homologous example, as it"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA  99is not an instance of the property which is cited as the reason, viz., \"arisenfrom effort.\"38Second, when Dignaga in the Hetucakra and the Pramdnasamuccayasays that a reason such as \"audibility\" is completely absent in sapaksa andvipaksa, what he means, according to Chos kyi rgyal mtshan, is that theopponent who ascertains the paksadharmatd cannot, in this case, estab-lish that audibility is present in the sapaksa or vipaksa. The point is thataudibility is in factthere in exclusively the sapaksa^ but the opponent can-not know this without an example, and in this case an example is notforthcoming. Thus, we have the fallacy of an uncertain reason (ma ngespa 'igtan tshigs = anaikdntikahetu) in that the anvayavydpticannot be as-certained (nges pa = niscita) by one of the parties in the debate.39Accordingly, the key moves in the dGe lugs account of the asddhdra-ndnaikdntikahetu are that they make a split between their (redefined)notion of sapaksa and that of homologous examples, and then they \"psy-chologize\" Dignaga's statements about existence and nonexistence asmeaning \"...knows that ...exists/does not exist.\" They can then arguethat in certain special cases, such as the sound-impermanent-audiblereasoning, where there is no example which differs from the subject, itis impossible (i.e., epistemically impossible) that the opponent ascer-tains the presence of the reason in the sapaksa. {A fortiori he will not as-certain its presence in the vipaksa, because it is in fact not there.) In thiscontext, we should also stress that this interpretation of \"existence\"/\"nonexistence\" or \"presence'7\"absence\" is certainly not just an inven-tion on the part of Chos kyi rgyal mtshan, et al., but finds some sup-port in Dharmaklrti's Svavrtti to PV I, k. 28 (the Svavrtti passages aregiven in bold-face; the rest is Karnakagomin's commentary as found onp. 84 of Sankrtyayana's edition):katham tarhy asddharanatvdc chrdvanatvam nitydnityayorndstiy ucyata ity aha I kevalam tv iiyddi I nitydnityesu srdvana-tvasya bhdvaniscaydbhdvdt Isrdvanatvam nitydnityayor ndstityucyate II \"Now then how is it that audibility is said to be ab-sent in both permanent and impermanent [things] because itis an exclusive [attribute]?

The basic line,though, remains the same: instead of asking factual questions as towhether or not the reason is present in sapaksa, one inquires about whatthe opponent can or cannot reasonably know or think—in effect, theasddhdrandnaikdntikahetuhzs been transformed into a problem of epis-temic or belief logic.Some Brief Remarks on the Formal Issues at StakeAll the preceding may still seem like a series of bizarre moves to onewho is accustomed to the received scenario, but it is not, I think, with-out its merits, especially formal logical merits. (I cannot attempt a verydetailed exposition here—only some guidelines—but the main argu-ments will be fleshed out in formal logic in the notes.)First, it can be argued, as does S. Katsura (1983), that at an earlierstage in the development of Buddhist logic, anvaya and vyatinku jointlyserved as a type of inductive procedure, but that with the addition of theparticle eva to the formulation of the trairiipya—following Katsura thisoccurs already with Dignaga's Pramdnasamuccayavrtti—and the re-quirement that there be a necessary connection (pratibandha) betweenthe reason and the sddhyadharma, this inductive logic was gradually re-placed by notions of entailment which were more rigorous and deduc-tive in character.40 It seems to me that the orthodox model of sapaksaand vipaksa and the asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu would apply quite wellto such an inductive logic; one \"observes\" that the reason is present ina number of examples/sapaksa, and absent in various counterexamples/vipaksa, and one then induces that a new and different case, viz., the sub-ject, will also have the property in question.However, applied to a trairiipya with eva, it can be shown that the or-thodox model presents serious formal problems, not the least of whichis that the anvaya and vyatireka are not logically equivalent.41 Indeed itdemands a most acute effort of logical acumen to see how the conclu-sion could be entailed at all.42 The main advantage, then, of the dGe lugspa interpretation of sapaksa and vipaksa—whatever might be its textual"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA   IOIand historical grounding—is that it does overcome those formal prob-lems. And moreover, in contradistinction to the Antarvyaptlvada ap-proach—which would also avoid the formal pitfalls, but which wouldhave to sacrifice the role of the example and the fallacy of asddhdra-ndnaikdntikahetu—the dGe lugs pa can and do still keep these impor-tant elements of Dignaga's and Dharmaklrti's logic.Appendix A:from rGyal tshab rje's rNarn 'grel thar lam gsal byed[Opponent:] It does follow that the vyatirekavydpti is established inproving that sound is impermanent by means of [the reason] audibil-ity. For, audibility exists in only impermanent things and never in whatis permanent. If it were otherwise, then sound too would not be estab-lished as impermanent.[Reply:] Now then, does a reason make [something] understood likea butter-lamp, i.e., by its mere competence, or does it depend on the as-certainment of a necessary connection ('brel ba - sambandha; prati-bandha) in the example [between it and the sddhyadharma] ?Taking the first [hypothesis], it would then follow [absurdly] thatone could understand a sddhya simply by having a reason such as \"pro-ducthood\" come to be an object of the mind; for, it would make [thesddhya] understood in the same manner as a butter-lamp, which, bymerely coming to be an object of the mind, clarifies forms, it [the op-ponent] agrees, then [we reply that] it would follow [absurdly] that noone would be confused about selflessness (bdag med = nairdfrmya), andthat [all] would, hence, be effortlessly saved.43But taking the second [hypothesis], then \"audibility\" could not be es-tablished as both the paksadharma proving sound's impermanence aswell as the vyatirekavydpti. This is because it would be impossible to as-certain the necessary connection in the example before establishing thesddhya.[Objection of the Antarvyaptivadin:] To demonstrate the necessaryconnection to a dullard one does depend on an example. But the intel-ligent, even without an example, will remember the connection as soonas they see the reason, as they have previously established the entail-men (khyab pa = vydpti) by means of direct perception (tnngon sum =pratyaksa). And given this [recollection], they will understand imper-"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"IO2  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEmanence in [the subject] sound. So although an extrinsic entailment(phyi'i khyabpa = bahirvydpti), which depends on an example, wouldnot be ascertained, an intrinsic entailment (nanggi khyab pa = antar-vydpti) would; hence, audibility will be a valid reason.[Reply:] This is incoherent. For, if [the opponent] ascertains thatthings audible are impermanent, then he must also ascertain that soundis impermanent [in which case he could no longer doubt the truth ofthe sddhya, as the criteria for thepaksadharmatdrequire].44[Objection:] But then it would follow [absurdly] that audibility isnot the defining characteristic (mtshan nyid = laksana) of sound [as itshould be possible to ascertain a defining characteristic and not ascer-tain its definiendum (mtshon bya)].45[Reply:] This is not a problem. In general it is so that the two [viz.,sound and audibility] have differing degrees of difficulty of ascertain-ment. But unless one discerns what the subject, sound, is through ameans of valid knowledge (tshadma = pramdna), it will be impossibleto prove the paksadharmaftd], namely, that audibility is established in[sound] in keeping with the mode of presentation (godtshul).46 So if au-dibility is not apaksadharma, then it cannot be a valid reason. But whenit is a paksadharma, then one cannot fail to ascertain sound once one hasascertained audibility. And then, after that, even if audibility mightmake the sddhya understood, it is not possible that one [i.e., the oppo-nent] fails to ascertain that sound entails impermanence when he has as-certained that audibility entails impermanence.

Unfortunately, however, the Hungarians ran into various finan-cial problems which delayed publication for a number of years, and inthe interim—as frequently happens in these situations—I found someother relevant material on the problems at stake. In particular it turnedout that Dharmakirti, in PVIV (Pardrthdnumdna), supported the dGelugs pa interpretation of sapaksa and asddhdrandnaikdntikahetu muchmore clearly than I had initially imagined when I wrote \"On Sapaksa'in 1984. In an article published in 1988 entitled \"Some Reflections onR.S.Y.

This, then, is what I have done, although I am conscious"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"104 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEof the article's inadequacies in treating Dharmakirti's position. Proba-bly the best and least disruptive way to balance the dossier which I pre-sented in \"On Sapaksa\" is to quote some passages from pages 160—61of my 1988 article. The reader will see that when in 1984 I said that \"this[dGe lugs pa] interpretation of \"existence'V'nonexistence\" or \"pres-ence'7\"absence\" is certainly not just an invention on the part of Choskyi rgyal mtshan et al.y but finds some support in Dharmakirti,\" I wasbeing overly cautious. Here then are the relevant passages:[Pages 160—61] \"...Dharmakirti, in Pramdnavdrttika IV's long dis-cussion of the asddhdranahetu, does not support the orthodox scenario,but rather comes up with a version (similar to the dGe lugs) whichwould interpret this fallacy as being essentially a problem of an epis-temic and intensional logic in that it involves contexts such as 'X knowsthat...'\"Kdrikds 207-59 of PVIV form part of a larger section loosely treat-ing of Dignaga's Hetucakra, and specifically concern the refutation ofthe Naiyayika's argument that living bodies have selves (dtman) becausethey have breath and other animal functions (prdnddi). Although Dhar-makirti does not discuss the sound-(im)permanent-audibility examplevery much, he does explicitly state in PV IV, k. 218 that the asddhdra-ndnaikdntikahetu, 'breath, etc.,' is completely logically similar to theexample found in the Hetucakra (srdvanatvena tat tulyam prdnddi vyab-hicdratah). Here are some of the key verses along with extracts fromcommentaries.\"Context: In PV IV, k. 205 and 206, Dharmakirti has been puttingforth the recurrent theme that the certainty of the reason's being ex-cluded from the dissimilar instances depends upon there being a neces-sary connection (avindbhdva) between it and the property to be proven.Such a connection will guarantee the pervasion (vydpti), i.e., the con-comitances in similarity (anvaya) and in difference (vyatireka). Thus,given such a connection, the reason would be excluded from the dis-similar instances, but in the case of the asddhdranahetu, such a connec-tion cannot be established; hence there is no such definitive exclusion.Devendrabuddhi's introduction to PV IV, k. 207: [Objec-tion:] If in this way the Master [Dignaga] did not exclude(Idogpa may in na) the special case [i.e., the asddhdranahetu}[from the dissimilar instances], then why is it said that it is ex-cluded from the similar and dissimilar instances?47"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"ON SAPAKSA  105Dharmaklrti's PVIV, k. 207: [Reply:] It is just from the pointof view of merely not observing [the reason among the dis-similar instances] that he spoke of it being excluded.

Otherwise [if there were the certaintythat it is excluded from the dissimilar instances], [the reason)would be demonstrative (gamaka)}*PV IV, k. 220: By saying that [the sddbana] is excluded justfrom the contrary of what is to be proven (asddhya) [viz., thedissimilar instances], it is asserted [by implication] that it ispresent in what is to be proven (sddhya) [viz., in the similarinstances]. Therefore, itiwas said that by means of one [viz.,the vyatireka or the anvaya], both will be demonstrated byimplication.49\"The point of PV IV, k. 207, then, is that Dharmakirti wants to in-terpret 'absence in the vipaksa metaphorically: it does not mean thatbreath, etc. are in fact completely absent from what does not have a self,but rather that the debaters do not observe that breath, etc. occurs inthings which have no self. But, although the debater might not see some-thing, that does not necessarily mean that it is not there. In that sense,the debater does not ascertain absence, for indeed, as k. 220 makes clear,if breath, etc. were really absent in the dissimilar instances, then thevyatirekavydpti would hold; hence, the anvaya would hold too, and thereason would be valid!\"So in brief, 'exclusion' or 'absence' is to be interpreted metaphori-cally as meaning 'nonobservation.' And precisely because nonobserva-tion is not probative, the essential point of the asddhdrariahetu, accord-ing to Dharmakirti's interpretation of Dignaga, is that the debaters donot know or ascertain vydpti, be it the reason's absence in vipaksa or itspresence in sapaksa.\"Note that this interpretation of \"absence in the vipaksa' is slightly dif-ferent from what Dharmakirti had given in the Svavrtti passage whichI had quoted in the body of my article (see p. 99 above). There Dhar-makirti argued that the reason, \"audibility,\" was \"not ascertained as be-ing present\" (bhdvaniscaydbbdva) in the vipaksa. (This Svavrfti passageseems to be reflected also in Yongs 'dzin rtags rigs; see note 39.) In short,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"IO6  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEthis view apparently construed \"absence in vipaksd' as meaning \"no as-certained presence.\" In PV IV, however, Dharmaklrti is explaining theasddhdrandnaikdntikahetu s \"absence in vipakscT as being an uncertainabsence. The two explanations are not completely identical, althoughundeniably they do complement and reinforce each other.Finally we might add the following philological observation in con-nection with PV IV, k. 220 which would seem to support the view thatDharmakirti is rejecting the \"orthodox scenario\" in favor of sapaksa andvipaksa along the lines of Antarvyaptivada. If we examine the Sanskritof k. 220, we see that Dharmakirti uses the terms sddhya and asddhya—Manorathanandin and Devendrabuddhi (cf. PVP 312b6-7) gloss thesewords as sapaksa and vipaksa respectively. In other words, sapaksa wouldseem to be everything which has the property to be proved and vipaksawould be everything which lacks this property.NOTES TO CHAPTER 5The orginal publication contains the following acknowledgment: \"I should liketo acknowledge gratefully financial assistance received from the Social Sciencesand Humanities Research Council of Canada (program 461) enabling me topresent this paper at the Bicentential Csoma de Koros Symposium in Viseg-rad, Hungary, Sept. 13-19, 1984.

The essential point, then, which this defini-tion makes is that it must be possible (sridpa) to ascertain that the subject isqualifed by the reason (e.g., that sound is a product) and still doubt or wishto know whether the subject is qualified by the sddhyadharma (e.g., whetheror not sound is impermanent). Go rams pa and Yongs 'dzin phurbu lcog alike say that for the paksadharmatd to be satisfied, the reason mustqualify such a \"subject of enquiry.\" They both also speak of \"bases of re-liance\" (Itos gzhi) of the three characteristics (tshul = rupa), the \"subject ofenquiry\" being the basis for the paksadharma(td), and sapaksa and vipaksabeing the bases for the anvaya and vyatirekavydpti respectively (Cf.

Moreover, in NP 2.2 we find vipakso yatra sddhyam ndsti, whichalong with Durvekamisra's comment on NBT, suggests that all and onlythose things which do not possess the sddhyadharma are vipaksa. This seemslike what the dGe lugs pa are terming vipaksa (proper). Certainly vipaksataken etymologically is different from this, as we can see from 'Jan* dbyangsbzhad pa's and Yongs 'dzin's arguments that they have a three point relation(mu gsum). Cf. n. 22. (Tachikawa [1971: 117], gives quite the same etymo-logical explanation of vipaksa as the Tibetan authors, saying: \"vipaksa meansanything dissimilar to the paksa insofar as it does not possess the sddhya\")All this could, then, provide a certain amount of ammunition for a dGelugs pa argument that there are notions of sapaksa and vipaksa proper inDharmakirti.30 Rang 'grel 132b4—5: kha cigslob dpon sdnti pa'i ryes su 'brangs nas bsgrubby a V chos dang Idan pa mthun phyogs I mi Idan pa mi mthun phyogs zhes zer laI.

I do not want to lend support to the fairly wide-spread view that the trirupalinga can be assimilated to a Western formal logicstructure, in particular, the syllogism. First of all, the trairupya is better seenas a set of second order criteria used to evaluate an informal, ordinary lan-guage structure, A is B because of C. Secondly, although the paksadharmatdand vydpti, when fleshed out as the two members of a pardrthdnumdna, do(formally) entail the proposition to be proved, there is much more at stake inthe Buddhist notion of \"validity\" then just validity in a formal logic sense.Specifically, there is a cognitive element, viz., that both parties in the debatemust also ascertain and accept the three characteristics. This provision is im-plicit in the wrord niscita occuring in the definitions (cf. n. 1). These andother questions of a similar nature are dealt with in Tillemans (1984b).41 Bearing in mind the cautions of n. 40, it is still true that the provisionsof at least the Dharmakirtian trairupya should imply the (necessary) truth ofcertain formal logic sentences. Let me adopt the notation of Mates (1972).Also, I would prefer to take the paksa (\"subject\") as a general term repre-sentabk by a predicate letter, rather than by an individual constant. (If thesubject is an individual such as Devadatta, this is no problem: proper namescan become predicate letters a la Quine.) This accords better with the ayoga-vyavaccbeda use of eva in the paksadharmatd definition. Cf.

Kat-sura op. city n.16, has an interesting suggestion as to how to make the anvayaand vyatireka logically equivalent (on the orthodox scenario): \"In my opin-ion, paksa should be excluded from the universe of discourse, so that the tworupas are logically equivalent in the domain consisting of sapaksa andvipaksa.\" Unfortunately, if \"logically equivalent\" means that the bicon-ditional must be necessarily true by virtue of its logical form, then this bicon-ditional should be true under all formal semantic interpretations, no matterwhat the domain. To hold that the equivalence statement between anvayaand vyatireka is only true on certain appropriately circumscribed interpreta-tions is to credit Dharmakirti et al. with no formal perspective or insight atall concerning this equivalence. Finally, note that all these problems areavoided on the dGe lugs pa and Antarvyaptivada view of sapaksa and vipaksa.(x) (Hx~*Sx) *-> (x) (-Sx-> - Hx) is necessarily true, and (x) (Px~>Sx) canbe derived from (x) (Px^Hx) and (x) (Hx~*Sx). Representing the paksa bythe constant/?, Sp can obviously be derived from Hp and (x) (Hx~~+Sx).

Nonetheless, in terms of the conceptsand terminology used, we see that almost all of bsdus grwas definitionsand classifications were already given (in prose) in Tsong kha pa's (1357—1419) sDe bdun la 'jugpa'i sgo dongnyeryidkyi mun Wand indeed most117"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Il8  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEof the lessons\" do most likely go back to theories of Phya pa himself.4'Jam dbyangs phyogs lha 'od zer and other bsdus grwa writers' contri-butions, thus, were doctrinally fairly unoriginal, but consisted in record-ing debates in a more formal, stylized pedagogical manner, one whichno doubt was closer to what transpired orally.Now, the term \"bsdus grwa\" itself admits of a certain ambiguity, fre-quently being applied in a narrow sense to a group of texts containingin total approximately eighteen lessons (mam bzhag), from an intro-ductory lesson on colors (kha dogdkar dmar sogs kyi mam bzhag) to thepresentation of the apoha theory of meaning (sel 'jugsgrub juggi mambzhag). \"bsDusgrwa\"does, however, also have a wider sense, referringto these \"' lessons\" plus a work on the varieties of cognition (bio rigs) andone on the logic of valid and invalid reasons (rtags rigs)/ For our pur-poses, we will speak of\" bsdus grwa logic\" as a type of logical idiom: itis of course typically found in bsdus grwa texts, but it is also rigorouslyused in a genre of texts known as \"word commentaries\" (tshig grel),which paraphrase the verses of major Indian texts such as Pramdnavdrtti-ka and Madhyamakdvatdra into debate logic format. It was, and still is,a commonly accepted medium for monastic students. No doubt at itsbest it contributed to a certain clarity; at its worst, it seems to have beenused to give an appearance of rigor, dressing up dogma in the trappingsof logic.My proposal then is a relatively modest one: to examine basic formalaspects of this logic such as quantification, variables, and entailmentand make some remarks concerning certain rather complicated seman-tical problems which arise in the interpretation of terms. Afterwards Ishall bring out the classical character of this logic by examining a dGelugs pa debate logic treatment of the tetralemma (catuskoti), a part ofBuddhist logic which is often taken as a prime candidate for a so-calleddeviant, or non-classical, logic. The examples and explanations below arebased on an examination of a number of elementary texts includingYongs 'dzin bsdus grwa, Rwa stod bsdus grwa, Yongs 'dzin rtags rigs, bsDusgrwa rjes tho of dGe bshes ngag dbang nyi ma, the bSe bsdus grwa of bSengag dbang bkra shis,6 as well as various dGe lugs pa commentarieswhich are in debate logic format or extensively use these means of expres-sion.7"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 119bsDus Grwa Logic as a Real Debate LogicdGe lugs pa logic has by now received a certain amount of study, notablyan early descriptive article by Sierksma, an M.A. and Ph.D. thesis by D.Perdue, the articles in Japanese by S. Onoda and two informative recentarticles by M. Goldberg.8 In Tillemans (1986b), I attempted an analy-sis of intensional epistemic statements in this system. However, what hasyet to adequately emerge from this mass of brute data is the generalcharacter of the system: here, modern interpretors have tended to abuseterms, such as \"syllogisms\" and \"sets,\" borrowed from Aristotelian ormodern symbolic logic, as if bsdus grwa were somehow a fragment of anodd sort of deductive logic or set theory.9 In fact, as one immediatelysees when one looks at the Tibetan texts, or even at the data which Per-due, Goldberg etal. give in a generally accurate way, the logic is throughand through a set of rules for conducting a dialogue; this is an obviousfact, but it means that bsdus grwa logic is not properly speaking a seriesof \"proofs\" (to cite Goldberg), \"syllogisms\" (to cite most writers on Indi-an or Tibetan logic), enthymemes, or derivations.Indeed, recently we have seen a growing interest among logicians andphilosophers in theories of argumentation and in so-called debate log-ics in their own right, an interest generally founded on the realization thatargumentation, while it is to varying degrees translatable into formallogic, is not the same as doing derivations, and indeed that it exhibitsfundamentally irreducible elements which deserve to be analysed with-out the distortions of translation into alien terms. J. Hintikka, E.M.Barth, L. Apostel, P. Lorenzen and numerous other philosophers writ-ing in a wide range of languages have attempted to provide analyses ofrational argumentation which offer alternatives to translations into ele-mentary first-order predicate logic, and indeed some writers, such asLorenzen, have even reinterpreted this elementary logic in terms of a for-malized dialogue logic.10 It is not my intention to try to present the var-ious currents in this new domain of \"argumentology,\" but to stress thatthe key steps which such theoreticians share is to conceive of argumen-tation and dialectics in terms of games, strategies, rights and obligationsfor the participants and finally, winning and losing. In short, to use EricC. W. Krabbe's (1982) terms: If we present a logic in a \"derivationalgarb,\" the \"validity\" of arguments will be defined as derivability in somesystem; if we use a \"dialectical garb,\" \"validity\" becomes the existenceof a winning strategy in a dialogue-game.11"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"I2O SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEIt should be clear to anyone familiar with bsdus grwa logic, that thekey terms such as 'dod(\"l agree\"), rtags ma grub (\"the reason is unestab-lished\"), khyabpa ma byung(\"there is no pervasion\"), cViphyir (\"why?\")and so forth embody a system of moves, responses, rights and obliga-tions in a rigidly structured game, a game in which certain strategieswill lead to subvictories punctuated by the exclamation /?/?*//and, even-tually, to a final victory marked by rtsa ba'idam bca'tsha, \"tsha! to [your]fundamental thesis.\"It is unnecessary to restate all the rules and procedures of this game—others have already done that. To make my point about the particular-ities of a debate logic, suffice it to cite here the rules, rights andobligations governing \"pervasion\" (khyab pa = vydpti), i.e., the entail-ment between the reason (rtags = lingo) and the property to be proved(bsgrub bya'i chos = sddhyadharma). If a proponent presents a statementof the form a has property Fbecause a has property G, his opponent isfaced with three possiblities of which he must choose one: (i) he maysay that he agrees that a has F; (ii) he may assert that a does not have G;(iii) he may assert that not everything which has G has i7, or in otherwords: For not all x: if x has G then xhas F. Should he choose the thirdoption, the opponent will then be summoned to show a counterexam-ple (ma khyab pa'i mu), viz., something which has Gbut does not haveF; if the opponent fails to give anything at all within a \"reasonable\" timeperiod, or if the example turns out to be bogus, the proponent will havethe right to assert that the pervasion does indeed hold.While we obviously can translate debates about pervasion into a nat-ural deduction system, where we speak of premises, universal instanti-ation, etc., and where truth is defined in the usual way relative to adomain of objects, this loses sight of the fundamental fact that debateis an activity, where the ontological question as to whether there is acounterexample or not is replaced by the practical activity of seeking andfinding one.12 In short, a universally generalized conditional, \"For all x:if x has Cthen xhas F\" is true in normal first order predicate calculusif there is no member of the domain which in fact has the propertyassigned to \"G\" but lacks the property assigned to \"F.\" In a debate logic,one is allowed to assert the generalization if the opponent cannot followa certain set of procedures and then find a counterexample. We shalllook at the details and consequences of this type of view of pervasion,below, but first of all, by way of a preliminary, let us take up the prob-lem of quantification and variables."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 121Formal StructuresQuantification and variablesFirst, it should be pointed out that language used in debate is a rathertechnical, artificial form of Tibetan, and in this idiom we find an exten-sive technical use of pronouns in a manner which is analogous to the useof variables. Indeed, it has been often said that variables are artificiallanguages' analogue to the ordinary pronouns in daily discourse. In thecase of Tibetan debate logic, however, this parallel between pronounsand variables is even more marked, for the Tibetan idiom is itself arti-ficial and the pronoun khyod which is used as a variable-analogue doesnot have its ordinary sense of \"you,\" the second person pronoun stand-ing for people whom one addresses, but instead usually stands for inan-imate things and notions. So without any more ado let us speak of khyodand its cousin chos de in such contexts as being, for our purposes, thevariables in debate logic: khyod is used when one variable is all that isnecessary, and chos de (lit., \"that dharma\" \"that element\") when a sec-ond variable is called for. Propositions are represented by de (lit., \"that\")as in de sgrub kyi rtagsyang dag, \"a valid reason for proving P.\" In mostcases when a predicate is monadic, the variable khyod w'i\\\\ be droppedas unnecessary and cumbersome: khyod can however always be explicit-ly added, if one wishes to do so, and the reasoning functions as if it wereimplicitly present. For example,(1) sgra chos can mi rtag ste (lit., \"sound, the subject, isimpermanent...\")could be phrased as:(2) sgra chos can khyod mi rtag pa yin ste (lit., \"sound, thesubject, you are impermanent...\").In a dyadic predicate such as \"x is the cause ofj/\" (khyod chos de'i rgyuyin) or \"xis identical with x\" (khyod khyod dang gcigyin), the variablesmust be used. (For more on the use of khyod, see Onoda [1979b].)Now the obvious question to ask is: What is the purpose of contin-ually saying \"the subject\" (chos can = dharmin) when stating proposi-tions? In fact, it plays a very necessary role, but let me bring this out intwo steps."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"122  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEFirst of all, chos can is not really a subject marker, but rather a markerof the topic under discussion. (Readers of Japanese when confrontedwith bsdusgrwa logic for the first time, invariably think of the Japanesetopic-marker wa, and the analogy is apt.) In the usual sound-impermanentreasonings, \"sound\" is actually the subject, but if we take the Tibetan ren-ditions of the classic Indian smoke-fire reasoning, viz., parvato vahn-imdn dhumdt- du Idan la la chos can meyod de du ba yodpa'i phyir, wesee immediately that in Tibetan the word \"hill\" is not a simple nomina-tive as in Sanskrit, but rather has the la particle (viz., du Idan la Id). Totranslate the Tibetan literally we would have: \"On the smoky hill, thetopic, there is fire, because there is smoke.\" It is apparent then that choscan is indeed more like a topic-marker, rather than a marker of the gram-matical subject.This however is at most the beginning of an explanation. More inter-esting is to see the use of the marker chos can as indicating a special typeof quantification. To see this more clearly, let us take a sample reason-ing with khyod being used as a variable:(3) bum pa chos can khyod khyod dang gcig yin te khyod yodpa Vphyir (lit., \"the vase, the topic, you are identical toyourself because you exist\").13This then is a statement of the form, F because G, and naturally theproponent can ask whether the corresponding generalization or perva-sion holds. We shall represent this pervasion as a universal generaliza-tion, viz., a statement of the form (x)(if Gx then Fx) which one shouldread as: For all x: if x has (7 then xhas F. (I should mention that quan-tification must range over existent and nonexistent items—everythingfrom vases to rabbit's horns. In another article I discuss the problemswhich this poses in the context of Indian Buddhist logic. I refer thereader to the discussion there for precisions on this problem; for ourpurposes it is not necessary to enter into details again.14)In Tibetan the pervasion of (3) becomes:(4) khyodyod na khyod khyoddang gcig yin pas khyab (lit., \"ifyou exist then you are pervaded by being identical withyourself).Formalizing things, we could represent the predicate \"exists\" by \"E!\""},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS  123and thus come up with:Now it should be clear that the variable khyodused in (4) also figuresin the original reasoning (3). How then could we formalize (3) all thewhile showing khyodzs being a variable? How, in effect, are to make thephrase \"the vase, the topic,\" (bum pa chos can) be anything more thana useless appendage followed by an unbound variable x? The answer isto treat it as being a quantifier which binds variables in the usual way;however, instead of the usual existential and universal quantifiers, whatis at stake here is what J.A. Faris (1968) terms \"singular quantification.\"Consider the following:(6) Ollie loves Nicaragua.(7) Ollie is such that he loves Nicaragua.(8) Ollie, he is such that he loves Nicaragua.If we treat the pronoun \"he\" in (8) as a variable then we can see that\"Ollie,\" in indicating the pronoun's antecedent, is in effect binding thevariable. Following Faris, sentence (8) could be formalized as:(9) (Ollie x)(x loves Nicaragua). Read: \"Of Ollie as x, it isso that xloves Nicaragua.\"16As Faris shows, this type of quantifier-matrix form for singular state-ments can be integrated into the fabric of first order logic without anyspecial problems; in fact the main reason which one can see for notdoing it in modern logic is that it is horribly cumbersome and does notreally do anything that individual constants don't already do. But inbsdus grwa logic it does have explanatory power. Sentence (3) becomes(10) (the vase x)(x = x because E!x), or equivalently,(1 l)(the vase x)(if E!xthen x= x)From (11) we only need to change the quantifier to universal quanti-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"124 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEfication to get (5). In short, khyodfunctions as a bound variable in bothsorts of statements, the singular statements (3)/(10) and the universalstatements (4)/(5): what changes is the type of quantifier which bindsit. In the first case singular quantification is conveyed by the topic-mark-er, chos can; in the second case, universal quantification is conveyed bythe idiom of \"pervasion\" (khyab pa).A curiosity in Tibetan debate, which is worth mentioning as it bringsout further the likeness between topic-markers and quantification, isthe possibility of redundant quantifiers, that is to say, in this logic wecan and frequently do find quantifiers which prefix formulae which haveno variables whatsoever. The result is that the quantifier becomes redun-dant—just as can occur in modern predicate logic—because it fails tobind any variables.In modern logic redundant quantification is a possibility, of course,but one of little practical importance. Not so for the Tibetans. To bringthis out more clearly, let us look at the following examples:(12)(x)(if Robert Johnson sang \"Crossroads\" then SonHouse sang \"Death Letter Blues\").(13)(x)(if sound is impermanent then vases are products).(14)([the] knowable thing x)(sound is impermanent andvases are not products).Obviously, for (12) to be true it is sufficient that either the antecedent(Robert Johnson sang \"Crossroads\") be false or the consequent (SonHouse sang \"Death Letter Blues\") be true. Similarly for the Tibetan-styleexample (13). It is interesting, however, to look at the manner in whichthis basically banal logical phenomenon presents itself in debate logic.Should an opponent assert the contrary of (13), the proponent will nat-urally say \"Show me a counterexample,\" and here he will be asking fora statement prefixed by a topic-marker such as in (14). It should beapparent that whatever topic the opponent might choose as a candidatefor a counterexample, it will be ineffectual, for the statements \"sound isimpermanent\" and \"vases are products\" will remain true. Failing to showa counterexample, the opponent has to accept the pervasion.In cases such as (14) Tibetan debaters regularly say that the chos canIs nits med(\"powerless\"), although I have never seen this particular term"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 125used in a text. At any rate, it is quite an apt description and brings outthe element of redundancy in that the chos can is not the antecedent ofany pronoun in the subsequent proposition: in our terms it is redundantbecause the proposition contains no variables for it to bind.Finally, note that in (14) the topic given was \"the knowable thing\"(shes bya) but in fact it could have been anything whatsoever, all be therea type of practical convention among debaters which leads one to use\"knowable thing\" as a virtual powerless topic of choice which is imme-diately recognized as such by competent debaters familiar with the \"code.\"This redundant quantification, I may add, is what is frequently chosento dress up doctrinal propositions in the trappings of logical rigor, as wesee in dGe 'dun grub pa's commentary, the dBu ma jugpagsal ba'i melong, where there are elaborate debate logic paraphrases of the verses inthe first five chapters of the Mhdhyamakdvatdra, chapters which concernessentially dogmatic subjects having little or nothing to do with logicalargumentation. Typically the powerless topic of such reasonings is rep-resented by \"the knowable thing,\" which is followed by two completesentences with no pronouns or variables, the second sentence ending inphyir and showing the reason for the first.17Pervasion for Tibetan logiciansand pervasion for DharmakirtiAt the risk of saying a few things which are becoming fairly well knownby now, let us briefly look at the Indian Buddhist account of vyapti asrepresented by Dharmakirti; this provides a significant point of con-trast to pervasion in Tibetan debate logic.18 Specifically, two questionsneed to be examined: (i) What is pervasion in the two logics? (ii) Howis it established?Now, for Dharmakirti, the key point is that the implication betweena reason (hetu) and a property to be proved (sddhyadharma) must befounded on a necessary connection (sambandha; pratibandha) betweenthe terms, be this a causal connection (tadutpatti) or one of essentialidentity (tdddtmya)}1* If there is such a connection, then it is certain thatthe former term entails the latter and it is impossible that there be a coun-terexample.One might want to take \"certain\" and \"impossible\" in a suitablymodal sense, one which is construed in terms of causal necessity or thenecessity between two conceptually-fabricated distinctions (i.e.."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"126  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEsdmdnyalaksana) of the same real particulars (svalaksana). Following thisline, the temptation would be to say that for Dharmakirti the terms Gand .Fare in a relation of pervasion if and only if(15)N(x)(if GvthenFx)where \"N\" is a necessity operator. In fact, though, it is not clear as towhether Dharmakirti means that, or whether his point is more of anepistemological one, i.e., that one cannot know or be sure about thetruth of (x)(if Gx then Fx) unless one knoius that there is a connectionbetween G and F. I am of the opinion that the epistemological versionis a more accurate account of Dharmaklrti's thought, although in thefinal analysis one probably has to say that epistemological and logicalaspects were perhaps inadequately distinguished. At any rate, the keyposition which he is opposing is primarily a certain epistemologicalstance, viz., IsVarasena's view that pervasion is based on \"mere nonob-servation\" (adarasanamdtra) of a counterexample. More exactly, whatthis means is that one could assert (x)(if Gx then Fx) with no groundsother than not seeing something which had (7 but did not have F. So,to simplify things a bit, let us provisionally say that pervasion itself inDharmakirti translates into the same universally quantified formula asin Tibetan debate logic: the important difference, as we shall see, is intheir respective justifications for asserting that there is pervasion.In point of fact, in Dharmaklrti's epistemology it is quite complicat-ed to establish the necessary connection justifying the assertion thatthere is pervasion. How is one to know that such a connection exists andhence that there can never be a counterexample? In PramdnavdrttikaIV, k. 245-57 Dharmakirti explains what later became a standardaccount of the method to establish causal connections: causality betweenA and its effect B is established when observations of previously nonex-istent B s are preceded by those of A s, and nonobservations of A s arefollowed by nonobservations of B s.20 As for tdddtmya, identity, he arguesin PV IV, k. 258 that this sort of necessary connection is to be estab-lished by analyzing whether the real nature to which the concepts cor-respond is the same or not. Subsequently, in the Vddanydya,Dharmakirti will use a different method.21 But here in PV he relied upona type of conceptual analysis. Here is k. 258 with Devendrabuddhi'sintroduction:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 127Devendrabuddhi: \"So indeed, the necessary connection betweencause and effect is like this. The essential property (rang bzhin= svabhdva), i.e., the reason which is an essential property isas follows:\"22PV IV, k. 258: \"The necessary connection of the essentialproperty is to be understood by considering the reason accord-ing to its [real] nature (yathdsvam), just like [the proof ofidentity (tdddtmyasddhana)2*} between perishability and pro-ducthood which was previously explained.\"24So much for Dharmaklrti's stance. Of course, this view about neces-sary connections, and in fact all the basic features of Dharmaklrti's logic,were known to the Tibetans and were held in reverential awe as theguidelines on how to do logic. But while that may be so, the logic whichthey actually used, viz., the debate logic, was probably something whichwould have made Dharmakirti wince a bit, particularly as it comes veryclose to the accursed adarsanamdtra method of establishing pervasion.If we refer to the rules and obligations of this debate logic, we see thatif an opponent challenges a pervasion (i.e., asserts the contrary), the pro-ponent will say \"Show me a counterexample!\" In other words, in anactual debate, necessary connections and that sort of thing play very lit-tle role: a pervasion is accepted when one cannot find a counterexam-ple.25 No doubt the mixture of Dharmakirtian theory and actual Tibetandebate is slightly schizophrenic, but it is probably true that the simpli-fied approach to establishing universal generalizations is indeed whatone finds most of the time in real arguments, be they among Buddhistlogicians, members of Oxford debating unions or lawyers in an Assizecourt. Alas, nobody caught in the rough-and-tumble of debate can takemuch time out to do conceptual analysis of necessary relations betweenterms.Ex falso sequitur quodlibetSurprisingly enough, not only is it so that in practice Tibetan debatersdid not need to ascertain a necessary connection between terms in orderto establish pervasion, but this necessary connection is not even a stricttheoretical requirement. Let us suppose that we have a statement of a per-vasion where we are sure that the antecedent is false, e.g., the antecedent"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"128  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEcould involve an item universally recognized as being nonexistent, suchas the barren woman's son, a rabbit's horn and the like. In that case itwill be impossible to show a counterexample, not because of the barrenwoman's son's necessary connection with the term in the consequent(the barren woman's son isn't connected with anything at all!), but ratherbecause there are no instances of such \"sons.\" Once again, failing toshow a counterexample, one must then accept the pervasion.Consider the following formulae, the first representing a pervasion,the second showing the dGe lugs pa view that nothing, existent or non-existent, is a rabbit's horn:(\\6)(x)(if xis a rabbit's horn then xis impermanent).Ex)(xis a rabbit's horn).It should be clear that (16) follows from (17).26 Indeed, given (17),the consequent of (16) could have been anything at all: so long as theantecedent remains \"xis a rabbit's horn,\" the whole conditional will betrue. This is in fact a version of the medieval logician's principle of exfalso sequitur quodlibet,11 a principle which has its correspondent inTibetan debate logic:(18) ri bong rwa yin na gang dran dran yin pas khyab (uifsomething is a rabbit's horn then it is pervaded by beingwhatever one can think of').28The Medievals generally made a distinction between consequentiaewhoseantecedents were necessarily false (i.e., contradictory) or contingentlyfalse, a distinction which is not explicitly formulated in Tibetan debatelogic, but the logical insight at stake here, while somewhat less elabo-rated in the case of the Tibetans, is turning on the same point.Naturally, if a Tibetan has such a view on pervasion, exegetical prob-lems will arise as to how he is to interpret Dharmakirti's strictures con-cerning necessary connections. Their solution is to make a split betweenpervasion simpliciter, such as one might find in \"consequences\" (prasanga)used in a debate, and pervasion as the anvayavydpti and vyatirekavydptiin the context of the theory of the triple characterization (trairupya) ofvalid reasons; it is only in the latter case that a necessary connection isrequired.2y Frankly, I do not know how a consistent Dharmakirtian"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 129would have to react to such a split, but I would go so far as to say thatthe Tibetans' separation of the formal notion of pervasion from its Dhar-makirtian epistemological baggage does, perhaps, represent a certainprogress, in that they explicitly developed precisely those cases whichshow that the logical problem of formulating what we mean by sayingthat a pervasion holds is different from the epistemological problem asto how we we can know or come to be sure that it holds.30Semantic AspectsWhile the formal aspects of bsdusgrwa logic, such as those which I havediscussed above, can be explained with a relative degree of clarity andrigour, the semantic problems $f interpreting what the individual termsrefer to in Tibetan arguments are often nightmarishly complex. Mar-garet Goldberg, in two recently published papers, had the courage andpatience to try to disentangle and classify some of these problems. Shenoticed that there are a number of rules where one can predict certainresults providing the case is a \"normal\" one, or in her terms, 'providingno contradictory condition is present.\"31 Prima facie this might seem toboil down to the simple tautology that cases are normal providing theyare not odd and seemingly inexplicable exceptions, but in fact there ismore to it—she tried to give some rules which would explain whensome of these \"exceptions\" occur. Unfortunately, much of her expositionis either an intrasystemic mass of data—largely correct, valuable, but ascomplex as the bsdus grwa arguments themselves—or involves an attri-bution of some alien and ill-fitting concepts. I think that we can and shouldsimplify things a bit by diagnosing a few ambiguities and equivocations.The basic problem in bsdus grwa logic which guarantees \"exception-al cases\" is the ambiguity of the terms used as topics. Thus, e.g., almostall young Tibetan debaters end up scratching their heads in puzzlementat the following pair of statements:(19) shes bya chos can rtagpayin (lit., \"knowable thing, thetopic, is permanent\").(20) shes bya y in na rtagpa yin pas ma khyab, dper na gserbum chos can (lit., \"if something is a knowable thingthen it is not pervaded by being permanent, for exam-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"IjO SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEpie, the topic, golden vase\").32The oddity is that (19) is saying that \"knowable thing,\" taken as thetopic, is permanent, while (20) means that not every knowable thing ispermanent—vases are knowable but are not permanent.Goldberg tried to explain cases such as (19) by \"the rule that says thatany entity which includes a mixture of permanent and impermanentinstances is permanent.\"33 This is true, although it does not get us muchfurther than merely repeating the intrasystemic reason which Tibetansthemselves invariably give and usually do not understand either. Let ustake up two more notions which she discusses.(21) mtshan nyidchos can mtshan nyidmayin te mtshon by ayin pa Vphyir (lit., \"defining property, the topic, is nota defining property, because it is the object of a defin-ing property\").(22) mtshan nyidyin na mtshan nyidyin pas khyab (lit., \"ifsomething is a defining property, it is pervaded by beinga defining property\").34So, finally, what is going on here? First and foremost, we have thepurely linguistic fact that Tibetan does not have a definite article andrarely uses the indefinite article or abstraction-designators such as the-tva or -td which we find in Sanskrit. It might be objected straightawaythat tva/td do have their equivalent in Tibetan, viz., nyid, but while thatis so for Tibetan translations of Indian texts, in indigenous Tibetan logicor in literary Tibetan which is not translationese, nyid is almost neverused in this role. Nobody would say shes by a nyidchos can or bum pa nyidchos can.If we do not use articles, it is of course difficult to know whether weshould understand shes byaas meaning \"the knowable thing [over there]\"or \"a knowable thing\" or even \"all knowable things\" or \"some know-able things.\" Lacking a distinction such as that between jneya and jne-yatva we do not know whether shes bya means \"a/the/some/all knowablething(s)\" or \"knowableness.\" This, then, is the first element in disen-tangling the \"exceptions\" in bsdus grwa logic: in cases such as (19) theTibetans are not meaning \"an/the/some/all A(s)\" but rather may be tak-ing the term more in the sense of the property y4-ness. More exactly"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS  131speaking, it is we who have to take the term as meaning yl-ness: they failto make the distinction. At any rate, once we make such a distinction,the paradoxical quality of asserting both (19) and (20) vanishes, for theparadox arises if we take shes bya as implicitly meaning \"all knowablethings\" rather than knowableness. Certainly, in Tibetan logic substan-tives must often be understood as meaning \"all...\", but there are manycases where we have to take the Tibetan term as implicitly meaning theabstract property in question.35Now, it should be of some interest to know that this sort of ambi-guity is by no means restricted to Tibetan logic: the Medievals had a sim-ilar problem in their theory of supposition (suppositio), a theory whichI. Bocheiiski has termed \"one of the most original creations of Scholas-ticism, unknown to ancient and modern logic.\"36 For us it is impossi-ble and unnecessary to enter into the details of the complete theory, awell-developed doctrine on which most every post-twelfth century logi-cian had something to say. What is relevant to us, however, is themedieval logicians' attempt to explain the varieties of attribution anddesignation which one and the same substantive could have, and here aroot cause of these logicians' problems seems also to have been that Latintoo has no articles.If we take the theory as formulated by the thirteenth-century writer,William of Shyreswood, the same term homo can be used to mean\"a/some/all men,\" or \"man\" in the sense of the property or species, i.e.,one can say homo currit, [omnis] homo est animal, or homo est species.The case which is of interest to us is the third one, where, according toWilliam, the term homo \"simply stands for what is signified withoutreferring to the things.\"37 This latter suppositio simplex pro significato sinecomparatione ad res seems to have been somewhat controversial amongthe medieval logicians, but at any rate it was recognized that a term suchas homo could in certain contexts refer to the property, or \"variety\" ratherthan any or all individual men: another term for this suppositio is mane-rialis, quia supponit pro ipsa manerie speciei (\"manerial suppositionbecause it stands for the very manner [i.e., specific character] of thespecies\").38Let us now return to the pair of statements, (21) and (22). If we takethe term mtshan nyid&s referring to the various entities which are them-selves defining properties, then (21) will lead to the paradox that a/some/the/all things which are defining properties are not defining properties.However, taking (21) as a kind of suppositio simplex sine comparatione"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"132  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEad res, it asserts that being a defining property, or defining-property-ness, is not itself a defining property. To Sanskritize things, the pointat stake may be taken to be that laksanatva (\"defining-propertyness\") issomething which can itself be defined, therefore, it is the object of a de-fining property (mtshon bya = laksya)2&A is not itself a defining property.39Curiously enough, although the Tibetans never developed a theoryapproaching the complexity of the Medievals' theory of supposition theydo seem to be aware that a special type of reference is occurring whenone uses terms as in (19) and (21). They will insist that what is meantis just \"its own exclusion\" (rang Idog) rather than the \"exclusions of itsbases\" (gzhi Idog), thus making use of Tibetan (?) adaptations of the ter-minology in the Indian Buddhist theory of apoha, a theory which holdsthat the referent of any word is always some sort of exclusion (Idog pa =vydvrtti) of what is contrary.Nonetheless, the use of the term \"exclusions\" is not of crucial impor-tance for us: the real point at stake is whether a word is referring only tothe general notion or property (i.e., rang Idog) or whether it is also insome way referring to the things which have that property (i.e., gzhildog)y in other words what the Medievals termed respectively suppositiosimplex pro significato sine comparatione ad res and suppositio simplex prosignificato comparato ad res.40 While Tibetans will draw upon the termsrang Idog and gzhi Idog in an ad hoc fashion to explain away paradoxicalcases (in that sense one could say that they potentially have the con-ceptual machinery necessary to construct a theory of different sorts ofsuppositio)^ there is no clear attempt to systematically explain and gen-eralize upon the fundamental logical differences between such state-ments as bum pa Ito Idir zhabs zhum chos sky or gyi don byed nus payin(\"vase[s] are bulbous, splay-bottomed [and] able to perform the func-tion of carrying water\"42) and byas pa sgra mi rtag par sgrub pa V rtagsyangdagyin (\"product[hood] is a valid reason for proving that sound isimpermanent\").43 And yet, obviously, in the first case there mustht ref-erences to actual vases in addition to the reference to the rang Idog,whereas in the latter it would be incoherent for the term byas pa to referto actual products of causality such as seeds, sprouts and pillars—nobodywould want to pretend that a pillar is a valid reason for proving thatsound is impermanent.Ultimately we have have no choice but to diagnose ambiguities andequivocations, for if we remain rigourously faithful to what is writtenin the texts, the result will certainly be that we end up with a more or"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS  133less incomprehensible logic of the sort which Goldberg, alas, accurate-ly describes in her list of \"puzzles.\" At any rate, we do not get rar in ourunderstanding by saying things like \"the dGe lugs pas assume that thereis an almost consistent universe,\" or by exaggerating the importance ofa few bsdus griva brain-teasers so that we end up with a \"unique non-Western formulation of topics related to set theory including logicalantinomies similar to Russell's paradox.\"44 In fact, it is probably fairerto say that the dGe lugs pa generally were hardly confronted with theproblem of inconsistency in a logic, largely because their debate logic wasnot sufficiently formalized so that this problem would arise clearly. Whatthey were doing was nothing so elevated as the postulation of a \"semi-consistent\" universe: it was very often a matter of simply patching thingsup. In short, while it is not necessary to go so far as to say (as doesQuine) that there can be no logics which really do deviate from the clas-sical logical laws of contradiction and excluded middle, it is better toexplain away the anomalous phenomena in bsdusgrwa as resting on mis-understandings, equivocations, translational problems and the like.45So much for the comparative philosophy approach to solving logicalanomalies which arise in articleless languages.46 There are other conun-drums which arise because of the apoha-hased view that entities such asbyaspa \"(product[hood]\") and mi nag pa (\"impermanent'7\"imperma-nence\") cannot be identical (gcig) in some very strong sense of the term\"identity.\" But I have developed these points elsewhere and will notagain enter into the details of the Tibetan notions of identity.47 What isperhaps of interest as a final section to this article, is to look at how theTibetans used debate logic in their interpretations of a key Indian Bud-dhist doctrine, the catuskoti (\"tetralemma\"; Tib. mu bzhi). For the sakeof brevity, let me presuppose a certain familiarity with the broad out-lines of the Indian Madhyamaka and restrict myself to the position ofthe dGe lugs pas without making comparisons with other Tibetan schools,who, it should be remembered, did have very different positions.The Catuskoti as Seen viathe Perspective of dGe lugs pa Debate LogicA classic Indian statement of the catuskoti occurs in k. 21 of chapter 12of Aryadeva's Catuhsataka:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEExistent, nonexistent, both existent and nonexistent, neitherexistent nor nonexistent, that is the method which thelearned should always use with regard to oneness and othersuch [theses].48As phrased in this way, we have denials that anything exists, is nonex-istent, is both or neither. The commentary of Candrakirti makes it clear,however, that this tetralemma also applies to other dichotomies, suchas one/many, and so forth—in other words, it can be generalized toapply to any proposition P, and not just to the usual context of\".. .exists,\"\"...is nonexistent,\" etc.49 Ruegg (1977: 9) sums up the Madhyamikause of this schema:This type of analysis of a problem thus constitutes one of thebasic methods used by the Madhyamikas to establish the inap-plicability of any imaginable conceptual position—positive,negative or some combination of these—that might be takenas the subject of an existential proposition and become one ofa set of binary doctrinal extemes (antadvaya).While one might somehow find a way to rationalize this fourfoldnegation, prima facie, it looks as if it would lead to a deviant logic, a factwhich, of course, has not gone unnoticed by Western interpreters. If wetake the negations of the four lemmas^ as being -P, --P, -(P & -P),-(^P&C ~-P), then these four cannot be maintained together unless wegrant that the negation operator is not that of classical logic: in otherwords, inter alia, --Pcannot imply P, and other such classical laws can-not hold either. In point of fact, many Western interpreters are quickto say that the negation operator is not classical, that it is prasajyapra-tisedha, a type of negation which would not be bound by the law ofdouble negation.Now, indeed, in spite of Ruegg's excellent paper, the Indian catuskotiandprasajyapratisedha is, no doubt, a subject on which many writers willcontinue to seek interpretations, especially those who are philosophicallycautious about embracing non-classical logics and negations. Fortu-nately, that problem need not be solved here; what is of interest to usnow is the fact that the dGe lugs clearly felt the same sort of qualmsabout a literal interpretation of the tetralemma, an interpretation whichwould necessitate a non-classical view of negation. They avoid these"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 135unpalatable consequences by adding the qualification bden par grub pa(\"truly established\")—or equivalently, rang bzhin gyis grub pa (\"estab-lished by own-nature\") or don dam par (\"ultimately\")—wherever nec-essary to avoid paradox.50 This is in keeping with the fundamental viewof Tsong kha pa that statements in Madhyamaka arguments, in gener-al, cannot be taken literally, but must be prefixed by a qualificationwhich specifies exactly what it is that is being refuted (dgag bya). Fail-ure to qualify yodpa (\"existence\"/\"existent\") as bden par yodpa (\"trulyexistent\") would, besides engendering paradoxes in catuskoti-style argu-ments, also lead to a complete denial of conventional truth.Consider the following passage from Se ra rje btsun chos kyi rgyalmtshan's sKabs dangpo V spyi don where the author first presents a liter-al version of the catuskoti, which he considers untenable. He then givesa duly qualified version:An opponent might say: \"The ultimate mode of being is thatall dharmas are not existent, nor nonexistent, nor both, norneither, for in the sutra it is said that all dharmas are not exis-tent, nonexistent, both or neither, and the Ratnakuta [sutra]states: 'Kas'yapa, saying that [a thing] exists is one extreme,saying that it does not exist is the other extreme. Abandon-ing these two extremes is the Middle Path.'\" [Reply:] This isincorrect for the following reasons: the meaning of the firstscriptural citation is the point that all dharmas are not ulti-mately existent, [and thus] are not truly established, nor arethey conventionally nonexistent, [and thus] established asbeing that [i.e., nonexistent], nor are they truly established asbeing both ultimately existent and conventionally nonexis-tent, nor are they truly established as being neither [ultimatelyexistent nor conventionally nonexistent]; the meaning of thesecond [citation] is to show that the view [that things are]truly existent is the view of permanence and that the view thatthey are conventionally nonexistent is the view of annihila-tion. If it were not like this, then it would follow that all dhar-mas, the topic, are existent, because they are not nonexistent....Or, what is more, it would follow that all dharmas, thetopic, are existent and are also nonexistent, both and neither,because all dharmas are not existent, not nonexistent, not bothnor neither—the reason is what you hold.51"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"136  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEIn fact, Chos kyi rgyal mtshan's qualified version is somewhat com-plicated to interpret. We might take \"truly established\" (bden par grubpa) ox \"truly\" (bden par), \"ultimately\" (don dam par) 2& a kind of modaloperator which we could symbolize by \"•\". Thus - • Pmeans \"it is nottruly so that P.\" In that case, Chos kyi rgyal mtshan's version asserts:-• P;—P;-D (DP&-P), -• (-•/>&>- P). First of all, note that thethird lemma, in particular, seems unnecessarily circumscribed, i.e., hecould have simply said -(DP& -P): on either solution though, we seethat the third lemma would not be a simple restatement of the law ofcontradiction, as it is in the literalist version. At any rate what concernsus most in Chos kyi rgyal mtshan's version is that no contradiction isderivable from the conjunction of the four negated lemmas. Jn simplerterms, to take his version of the Ratnakutds famous pronouncement, the\"Middle Path\" would be an assertion of an unqualified statement P; the\"extremes\" would be DP and ~P; there is no contradiction in a formu-la which denies the \"extremes\" and asserts P, viz., ((-DP& --P) & P).At this point, though, I should make an exegetical aside with regardto the interpretation of the negation of the second lemma, which, inChos kyi rgyal mtshan, is to be taken as denying that things are com-pletely nonexistent. In other words, for Chos kyi rgyal mtshan, thiscomes down to the statement which we sometimes see in other dCelugs pa texts that phenomena are gtan nas medpa mayinpa (\"not com-pletely nonexistent\").52 Such a version of the second lemma seems tocorrespond with his interpretation of the \"extremes\" (rntha * = anta)which are to be avoided and indeed one finds no shortage of allusionsto this idea in dGe lugs pa commentaries.Be all this as it may, the dGe lugs pa do in fact recognize two versionsof the extreme of nonexistence (medmtha'): (a) \"one which denies some-thing legitimate\" (skur 'debs kyi medmtha')—this is what Chos kyi rgyalmtshan is talking about; (b) \"one which involves reification [of the nega-tion]\" (sgro 'dogs kyi med mtha').5i The latter type of med mtha'wouldbe something like saying, \"it is truly so that things do not truly exist,\"and its denial would therefore be, \"it is not truly so that things do nottruly exist,\" or in symbols, -D-DP.54 Note that here too, there is noth-ing contradictory about asserting (-DP& -D-DP). What is signifi-cantly different from the denial of the skur 'debs kyi medmtha\\ however,is that \"•- DP does not in anyway imply or contradict P; -D-DPiscompatible with Pand also with \"P.Now, turning to the absurd consequences which Chos kyi rgyal"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"FORMAL AND SEMANTIC ASPECTS 137mtshan maintains follow from the literalist position, we see further evi-dence that the debate logic which he is using gives results analogous towhat one would expect from a classical propositional calculus. In otherwords, to use propositional calculus with the normal negation operator,we can tautologically derive jPfrom \"-P, and that is just what Chos kyirgyal mtshan does. Indeed, debate logic analogues to the laws of dou-ble negation in classical logic are nicely described in Yongs 'dzin bsdusgrwds treatment of negation:The negation-of-not-being [an A] (ma yin pa las log pa) isequivalent to being [an A] (yin pa); the negation-of-being [anA] (yin pa las log pa) is equivalent to not being [an A] (ma yinpa); however many times one accumulates [occurrences of]negation-of-not-being, i^ is equivalent to one [occurrence of]negation-of-not-being; an even number of [occurrences of]negation-of-being [an A] is equivalent to negation-of-not-being; if a [term] has an odd number of [occurrences of] nega-tion-of-being, it is equivalent to [the term with] one negation-of-being.55Not surprisingly then, prasajyapratisedha, as explained in bsdus grwatexts and in Tsong kha pa,56 turns out to be unexceptional and con-forms to classical negation. In sum, one occurrence of a negation oper-ator such as ma yin pa or the negative particle ma, mi, etc. in terms suchas bum pa ma yin pa (\"not being a vase\"; \"non-vase\") or ...bden par magrub pa (\"not being truly established\") will be counted as a prasajyapra-tisedha, because no positive assertion about a phenomenon is implied.57Two occurrences of ma yin pa or an occurrence of ma yin pa las log pawill be an implicative negation (paryuddsapratisedha).If we look at Chos kyi rgyal mtshan's rendering of the catuskoti, hehas clearly taken pains to add bden par ma grub (\"not truly established\"),which is a prasajyapratisedha and implies no positive assertion at all. Hisexegetical weak point, however, is his denial of the second lemma, forhe must accept such a denial will imply the positive statement (i.e., ~~Pimplies P): in that sense it is difficult for him to maintain that all thenegations in the catuskoti are prasajyapratisedha,^ Furthermore, on Choskyi rgyal mtshan's version of the catuskoti involving the skur 'debs kyi medmtha\\ there will be conventionally false existential propositions (e.g.,\"The creator of the world exists\") for which it will be impossible to"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"138  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEnegate all the lemmas: a dGe lugs pa could not say that the creator ofthe world is not conventionally nonexistent, because the creator wouldthen have to exist. Thus, we have another exegetical problem in that wewill not be able to apply the catuskoti to any proposition we like. A lit-tle reflection, however, shows that if we take the second lemma as beingthe sgro 'dogs kyi medmtha', the negation operator will still behave clas-sically, but neither of these two exegetical problems will arise.NOTES TO CHAPTER 61 Stcherbatsky (1932: vol. 1, 38).2 On Phya pa and his oeuvre, see van der Kuijp (1978), (1983: chap. 2).3 Indeed, after Tsong kha pa, we see dGe lugs authors regularly alternatingbetween prose and debate logic format in their more extensive commentarieson the meaning of canonical Indian texts. Tsong kha pa may also have usedit in his lectures, although in works written directly by him (i.e., not the lec-ture notes of rGyal tshab and mKhas grub), he does not seem to use it.

In controver-sial cases, I give passages on which my examples can be based.8 See Sierksma (1964); Perdue (1976); Onoda (1979a; 1979b; 1980;1982a; 1982b; 1982c; 1983); and Goldberg (1985a; 1985b). Onoda (1992)is an English work based on his Japanese articles.9 While predicate calculus, set theory, etc., can be profitably used on occa-sion in explaining structures in bsdus grwa, we must bear in mind that thesemodern logic structures are at most approximate analogues of the structuresin bsdus grwa itself: in effect, we make a trade-off between the precision andfacility gained in our explanations versus the fidelity lost with regard to theactual bsdus grwa argumentation. Goldberg, however, systematically blurs thedistinction between a description of the debate logic and its possible ana-logues or translations into Aristotelian or formal logic. Cf. Goldberg(1985a):157: \"The theory of logic which I encountered deals with infer-ences as single syllogistic units.... The rules of inference of Detach-ment (Modus Ponens), its contrapositive (Modus Tollens), andSubstitution are known and used [my italics].... Negation of impli-cations, conjunctions, and disjunctions (including DeMorgan'sLaws) are also known.. .The Aristotelian techniques of direct proof,reductio ad absurdum (including reductio ad impossibile and con-sequentia mirabilis) and ecthesis are used routinely.\" Ibid, 156:\"The dGe lugs pa theories of formal logic are theories of predicate"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"140 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGElogic.\" Ibid, 158: \"dGe lugs pa logic presents a calculus of arbitrarysets, properties and extensions....\"What does Goldberg mean by saying that all these things \"are known andused\"? They are never explicitly formulated nor, with perhaps the exceptionof contraposition, are they even discussed clearly. Of course, wean, if wewish, use this Aristotelian terminology for comparative purposes, or we caneven try to transpose/translate bsdus griva into such a logic. We could, withlimited utility, do the same thing with regard to the arguments that occurbetween lawyers, but it would be somewhat silly to say that debaters incourts of law know and use Aristotelian logic. As for the \"dGe lugs pa theo-ries of formal logic\" and the \"calculus\" of sets, etc., this falsifies the characterof dGe lugs pa argumentation: there are no \"theories of formal logic\" or cal-culi, if she is using these terms in anything other than a very loose or solecis-tic manner. A few debate rules and obligations are informally presented inthe third book of Yongs 'dzin bsdusgrwa, but many are not explained at all—the student has to \"pick them up\" as best he can. For the problems in usingthe terminology of sets, see n. 44.10 See the extensive chronological bibliography of research in this area inBarth and Martens (1982).11 See Krabbe (1982: 126-27).12 The essential change of perspective which this way of doing logic bringsout has been interestingly described by Barth in her introduction to Barthand Martens (1982: 6) as follows: \"...the habit of logicians, old and new, ofbasing logic as well as their philosophy of language on some kind of \"ontol-ogy\"—that is to say, on things, properties and values that \"are there,\" poten-tially or actually, in some \"domain\" or other—this habit should give place toa semantics in terms of the human activities of seeking and finding.\"13 Gf.

A good illustration of the ambiguity of terms inTibetan.40 An example of the latter is piper venditur hie et Romae (\"Pepper is soldhere and in Rome\"), where there is not just a reference to the variety or typeof thing, but also to the concrete peppercorns which are actually sold.41 For rang Idog and gzbi Idog, see the third chapter of Yongs 'dzin bsdus grwachiing on Idogpa ngos 'dzin. A good example of the use which the dGe lugsmake of these terms is in the theory of apoha, where they want to say that thelikeness of the object which appears to the conceptual mind and is the mean-ing of a word is a conceptually created fiction, a sdmdnyalaksana. However,that which has that likeness, viz., the svalaksana (i.e., the real particulars inthe world), is not conceptually created. We find bsdus grwa arguments onapoha such as the following:bum 'dzin rtogpa la bum pa mayin pa las log par snang ba chos canspyi mtshan yin. \"Appear[ance] as non-non-vase to the conceptualmind thinking about vase[s], the topic, is a sdmanyalaksana.\"khyod bum 'dzin rtog pa la bum pa ma yin pa las log par snang nakhyod spyi mtshan yin pas ma khyab, dper na bum pa bzhin. \"If x issomething which appears as non-non-vase to the conceptual mindthinking about vase[s], then x is not pervaded by being a sdmanya-laksana, for example, as in the case of a vase.\"Cf. Yongs 'dzin bsdus grwa che ba, the chapter on apoha (gzhan sel). Notethat bumpa'i don spyi, the \"object-universal of a vase\", or the mentally-creat-ed likeness which is the basis for words and concepts, is explained in bsDusgrwa chungand che ba as bum 'dzin rtogpa la bum pa mayin pa las log parsnang ba. ICang skya rol pa'i rdo rje in effect explains the point brought outin the above two statements by using the terminology of rang Idog and gzhiIdog—the \"appearance\" itself (rang Idog) is the conceptually fabricated basisfor applying mental and verbal conventions such as \"ox,\" but the individualoxen which appear as non-non-ox are the gzhi Idog of this appearance and aresvalaksana.

[Editor's note: see also Tillemans(1995a), reprinted as chapter 10 in the present volume.]42 Cf. Yongs 'dzin bsdus gnva cbungGz where Ito Idir zhabs zhum chos skyorgyi don byed nus pa is also given as the defining property of vases (burn pa).43 Cf. rl'ags rigs, 8b6 ( = p. 31, ed. Onoda): byaspa sgra mi rtagpar sgrubpa'i gnyis pa [i.e., sgra mi rtagpar sgrub kyi khyadpar Itospa pa'i rang bzhingyirtagsyangda^.44 For the first quotation, see Goldberg (1985a: 177); for the second, seeibid. p. 153. The usual version of Russell's paradox arises in the context of anineteenth-century set theory. Now bsdus gnva is far from being a theory ofsets, nor is it even likely that topic terms regularly refer to anything even sim-ilar to sets. This is easily seen by the following typical example: bum pa choscan bum pa y in te Ito Idir zhabs zhum chos skyor gyi don byed nus pa yin pa'iphyir (lit., \"vase, the topic, is a vase because it is bulbous, splay-bottomedand can perform the function of carrying water.\") But the set of vases is not avase, nor can it carry water.Goldberg (1985b: 295) says: \"This entity [viz., rang ma yinpa] was notmentioned in my studies of dGe lugs pa logic but its existence is obviousfrom the postulates.\" Disregarding the hyperbole and inexactitude ot talkingabout \"postulates\" in dGe lugs pa logic, it is worth mentioning that it is real-ly Goldberg who came up with this paradox of rang ma yin pa (\"not beingitself), a paradox which is hardly clearly extractable from the bsdus grwaarguments on rang ma yin pa'i Idogchos, etc. Granted, there seems to besomething like a paradox in the latter arguments, but it is arrived at in anextremely roundabout and woolly way. Secondly, the terms rang ma yin paand rang ma yin pa'i Idog chos suffer from a similar type of ambiguity as thecases which we saw above. If one felt less charitable one could, it seems tome, justifiably say that one does not understand what the terms mean andthat the whole thing is a type of pseudo-paradox. But taking a more charita-ble point of view, we could understand rang ma yin pa in the sense of the\"property of not qualifying itself\" or the \"property of not being predicable ofitself—this, given what we saw previously about the ambiguities of termsin Tibetan, is probably a much more legitimate possibility than somethingabout sets. If we take that course, however, then rang ma yin pa looks likeRussell's property of \"impredicability\": a property/that is not predicableof itself will be termed \"impredicable\", i.e., Irnpr(f) if and only if-/{/)."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"146 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGELet the property \"impredicable\" be/Then Impr(Impr) if and only if-Impr(Impr). See Copi (1971: 9). In other words, if there is a parallel withRussell, it is better understood as not being a version of Russell's set theoreti-cal paradox, but as a paradox turning on properties. The inescapable impres-sion which one gets from bsdus grwa and Goldberg, however, is that theTibetans did not have a clear awareness of such paradoxes, nor of their con-sequences; they stumbled onto something and then adopted a patchworksolution with the notion of rjes mthunpa (\"semblant entities\"). Coming upwith explicitly formulated logical paradoxes is quite a different thing.45 Cf. Quine (1970: 80-87), or (1960a: 387) where he gives the simplisticview that apparent logical conflicts are always results of mistranslation: \"pre-logicality is a myth invented by bad translators.\" Actually as Susan Haack(1974) shows, Quine's position is not wholly consistent. If we adopt hisviews in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" that there is no fundamental differ-ence between so-called \"necessary\" logical truths and factual truths, then it istheoretically possible that some circumstances would lead us to revise logicallaws. This theoretical possiblity is to be governed by his \"maxim of mini-mum mutilation,\" which reminds us of the awesome consequences. SeeHaack (1974, ch.2) for a discussion of the question, \"Could there be goodreason [s] for a change of logic?\"46 Note that one could reproduce similar ambiguities in Chinese, and itwould be interesting to see whether the Mohist logicians did have similarlogical problems and how they solved them.47 See Tillemans (1986b).48 sad asat sadasac ceti sadasan neti ca kramah I esa prayojyo vidvadbhirekatvddisu nityasah II49 See CSV ad CS XIV, k. 21:ekatvam anyatvam ubhayam nobhayam ity ekatvddayah I etesvekatvddisu paksesu vddind vyavasthitesu sadasattvddyupalaksitodusanakramah sudhiyd* yathdkramam avatdryah II * Better to readsudhiyd (= Tib. bio bzangpos) than svadhiyd, which is the readingfound in Haraprasad Shastri and V.

Here there is a constellation of questions, ranging frompurely factual matters like the history of transmissions of the Pramd-navdrttika, Pramdnaviniscaya, etc., to philological and philosophicalpoints, such as the history of certain intra-Tibetan debates on key Dhar-makirtian notions. So long as one does not attempt to evaluate these Ti-betan debates as to their accuracy or fruitfulness in elucidating Dhar-maklrti's thought, one can treat them as purely Tibetan events, andindeed one can even quite justifiably go a long way in investigating thispart of Tibetan philosophical history without preoccupying oneself verymuch with Dharmaklrti's actual works. The result is what one could terma purely Tibetological approach.The second orientation is evaluative in nature and does therefore pre-suppose an understanding of Dharmaklrti's own system: one shuttlesback and forth between the indigenous Tibetan commentaries and theoriginal Indian texts (in Sanskrit where available), seeking to use Tibetanmaterials to gain a deeper understanding of Dharmaklrti's own thought.The question then inevitably arises as to what kind of understanding ofDharmaklrti we can get in this manner. Here there is no one simple an-swer. Sometimes Tibetans do give us valuable pieces of specific historicalinformation on the Indian debates figuring in Dharmaklrti's works, suchas identifying IsVarasena as being the proponent of the sadlaksanahetudoctrine against which Dharmaklrti repeatedly argued.1 More frequently,however, the Tibetan contribution to our understanding of Dharmaklrti"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"152  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEdoes not concern specific historical figures, facts, or events, but ratherwhat I have termed elsewhere \"internal history,\" and where the essen-tial procedure is not unlike what David Seyfort Ruegg, if 1 understandhim correctly, would explain as systematical hermeneutics.2 In short,the Tibetan commentators often attribute ideas to Dharmakirti whichare implied or presupposed by the whole system of his thought, althoughDharmakirti himself may never have subjectively entertained such ideas,or if he did, it was in a highly condensed, or even perhaps sometimes adimly understood fashion.Let us very briefly mention a few of the important Tibetan contri-butions to understanding Dharmakirti, contributions where the Ti-betans are largely proceeding by systematical hermeneutics, rather thanby rigid adherence to Dharmakirti's words:(1) The notion of tshad ma / skyes bu (\"person of authority\") which fig-ures in the exegesis of PV II.3(2) The differentiation between the various types of universals (sdmdnya),some of which should be acceptable to a Dharmakirtian, and oth-ers which should be totally unacceptable.4(3) The formulation of the so-called \"reasons/inferences from author-ity\" (yidchespa'i rtags;yidchespa'i ryes dpag). Dharmakirti in PVI and PV IV, in keeping with Dignaga, had explained that citationsfrom scriptures could be used for certain sorts of inferences. Ti-betan commentators then speculated on just what the formal rea-sonings (prayoga) in such inferences should look like, and what de-gree of probative status scriptural inferences had vis-a-vis othertypes of inferences, a problem which led to the infamous lunggnodbyed/lunggegs byed debate between Sa skya pas and dGe lugs pasover the question of whether a scripture (lung = dgama) could re-ally serve to invalidate (gnod byed = bddhaka) a thesis, or whetherit could at most conflict with the thesis, or more literally speaking,\"impede it\" (gegs byed = pratibandhaka). Some Tibetan commen-tators (such as dGe 'dun grub pa [1391-1474] in his Tshad ma rigspa'i rgyari), maintained that the debate had historical Indian pro-ponents (viz., \"disciples of Dignaga\"), but they never actually iden-tified these \"Indian thinkers,\" and it seems more likely that the de-bate is better viewed as an important contribution to systematical"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"ADRSYANUPALABDHIHETU  153hermeneutics, albeit one which was dressed up as an historicalpseudo-event.5In what follows we shall take up another Tibetan contribution to un-derstanding Dharmakirti, namely, the development of two significantlydifferent types of reasoning consisting in the non-apprehension of pu-tative states of affairs, in other words, two different types of anupalab-dhihetu (ma dmigs pa V gtan tshigs). As is well known by now, the stan-dard account of annpalabdhihetu which we find in Dharmakirti's worksand those of later logicians is that the absence of a perceptible type ofentity (drsya) is proven when^that entity is not apprehended: it wouldbe apprehended if it were present in a certain spot, but in fact it is notapprehended, and thus it is absent. It is repeatedly stressed, however, thatif the entity is not perceptible (adrsya), that is, if it is the type of thing,like a spirit (pisdca), which is not empirically accessible to ordinary be-ings, then merely not apprehending it does not prove its absence at all.This type of argument from non-apprehension is thus fallacious.This much should be relatively ho-hum for any Dharmaklrtian scholar.What is not obvious at all for someone relying on only the Indian textsis that, following Tibetan exegesis on Dharmakirti, there was a use ofadrsydnupalabdhi which was fully probative. In other words, Tibetansrecognized two equally valid, but different types of anupalabdhihetu,viz., the familiar drsydnupalabdhi (snangrungma dmigs pa), non-appre-hension of a perceptible thing, and a specific, well-circumscribed use ofadrsydnupalabdhi (mi snang ba ma dmigs pa), non-apprehension of animperceptible thing. Dharmakirti thus supposedly recognized a type ofadrsydnupalabdhihetu which could not be assimilated to the frequentlycriticized fallacious use, but which actually was a valid reason for prov-ing a certain type of negative proposition. As we shall see below, at leastone modern writer, Ernst Steinkellner, recognized that Dharmakirtisometimes spoke of inferences based on adrsydnupalabdhihetu as beingmeans of valid cognition (pramdna), but for Steinkellner (or rather, tobe fair, for Steinkellner in 1967 when he published his translation of theHetubindu6), a negation of the adrsydnupalabdhi sort was only hypo-thetical (hypothetisch) and not as real (echt) as the usual drsya sort. Sig-nificantly, the Tibetans made no such distinction, and I believe they"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"154  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEwere probably better off in not doing so. At any rate, following the Ti-betan scholastic, both sorts of valid anupalabdhiketuwztz of equal sta-tus, and led to negations and hence to inferential pramdnas which wereequally full-fledged and equally authoritative.Let us now look at typical Tibetan examples of the valid sort of adrsyd-nupalabdhihetu. We first take up the version of Tsong kha pa (1357—1419) as found in his short work on logic, sDe bdun la jugpa'i sgo dongnyeryid kyi mun sel, p. 48:mdun gyi gzhi 'dir sha za bskal don du song ba V skyes bus sha zayod nges kyi tha snyaddon mthun mi jug par sgrub pa la sha zabskal don du song ba 7 gang zaggis sha za ma dmigs pa bkodpaha bu //\"It is like stating [the reason] that someone for whomspirits (sha za = pis'dca) are inaccessible entities (bskal don =viprakntdrtha) does not apprehend a spirit, in order to provethat a person for whom a spirit is an inaccessible entity willnot apply a correct vyavahdra (= tha snyad don mthun) that aspirit is certain (nges = niscaya) to be present in the place infront.\"This basic idea is given in the form of various prayogas (\"formal ar-gument\") in dGe lugs pa rtags rigs texts; prayogas and definitions arealso given, with various modifications, by Sa skya pa writers such as Gorams pa bsod nams seng ge (1429—1489), Glo bo mkhan chen bsodnams Ihun grub (1456—1532) and goer mdog pan chen sakya mchogldan (1428—1507). To avoid overly burdening the text here we shallpresent these variants in our notes (see n. 7). To begin our discussion,then, here is the formal argument given by a later scholar, Yongs 'dzinphur bu lcog (1825—1901), who, in his monastic textbook on rtags rigsypresents an elaborate dGe lugs pa version of the prayoga:mdun gyi gzhi 'dir chos can I sha za bskal don du song ba V gangzaggi rgyud la sha za nges pa 'i dpyad shes don mthun med de Isha za bskal don du song ba V gang zaggi rgyud la sha za dmigsbyedkyi tshadma medpa'iphyirI \"The topic [is] 'with regardto the place in front.'

Thus the logical structureof the above reasoning is very similar to what Pramdnavdrttika I, k. 4termed hetvasiddhi and what the Vddanydya termed kdrandnupalabdhi—in the usual example of this sort of reason one proves that there is nosmoke in such and such a place because its cause, viz., fire, is not there.The point in the Tibetan example of the adrsyanupalabdhihetu is thatthe cause of a correct subsequent cognition (dpyad shes) must be apramdna, and in the case of cognizing inaccessible entities like spirits,ordinary beings simply do not have such pramdnas.Now, the initial temptation might well be to object that anyone, Ti-betan or not, who speaks positively of an adrsyanupalabdhihetu as beinga valid reason like drsydnupalabdhihetu has, ipso facto, understood noth-ing about Dharmakirti's system. After all, didn't Dharmaklrti explicitlysay in PVin II, k. 32cd and NB II, 27 that \"in the case of inaccessiblethings (bskalpa = viprakrsta) absence is not certain (bskalpa mams la niI medpar nges pa yod ma yin = viprakrstesu...abhdvaniscaydbhdvah)\"?Here, so it would be argued, what was meant was that various existentthings could be inaccessible to our perception, i.e., literally \"remote\"(viprakrsta), because of their subtle natures, or their distance from us intime or space. Such inaccessible entities would be adrsya, and indeedsimply not seeing them would not give any certainty that they werenonexistent. Thus, tolerating or advocating an adrsyanupalabdhihetuwould run completely counter to Dharmaklrti.I have in fact heard this objection voiced, and indeed not so long ago.But is it cogent? I don't think so. What the Tibetans are advocating asbeing a valid adrsyanupalabdhihetu is not at all like this fallacious use.The Tibetans in the above type of example are not seeking to establishthe certainty that a thing which does not lend itself to being perceivedis absent, rather they are establishing the simple absence of any certainty,or of any cognition which is certain about presence or absence of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"156 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEviprakrstartha. In short, they accept the Pramdnaviniscaya s idea of ab-sence being uncertain in the case of viprakrstartha, and then they go onestep further: they give valid reasons to prove that there is no certaintywith regard to the presences or absences of viprakrstartha. It is, thus,this type of reason which is the acceptable sort of adrsydnupalabdhi: ananupalabdhihetu which, like all such reasons, proves a negative propo-sition, but in this case what is being negated is the existence of an as-certaining cognition.In fact, there are some difficult passages in Dharmakirti's PVin II andin the PVSV which are probably best interpreted as supporting the Ti-betans on this matter. We shall first translate these passages and thenattempt to superimpose upon them the idea of an acceptable adrsydnu-palabdhihetu, one which is as valid—no more, no less—as a drsydnu-palabdhihetu.PVin II, 23.24-23.27 (ed.

First ofall, however, let us cite PV I, k. 3. This is the verse which Tibetan writ-ers themselves, be they dGe lugs pa or later Sa skya pa, will take to bethe main Indian source for a twofold classification of valid anupalabd-hihetu into adrsydnupalabdhi (mi snang ba ma dmigs pa) and drsydnu-palabdhi (snang rung ma dmigs pa):PV I, k.3: apravrttih pramdndndm apravrttiphald sati Iasajjndnaphald kdcid dhetubhedavyapeksayd //8 \"Non-activa-tion of pramdnas results in [one's] not acting towards thatwhich is not present.

The first half of PV I, k. 3 speaks of both adrsyaand drsydnupalabdhi-hetiiy but the emphasis is on the former.

Both PVin"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"158  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEand PVSV speak of the nonexistence, or non-activation (apravrtti), of pra-mdnas \"resulting\" in a negation of cognition, etc. This idiom \"resulting\"is not to be taken in a purely causal way, but rather in a logical sense, mean-ing \"establishing\" or \"proving.\" In other words, the nonexistence of pra-mdnas is a reason which establishes the conclusion that there is no cogni-tion, etc. of presence. Indeed, Sakyabuddhi, in commenting on the Svavrttito k. 3, makes it clear that we are dealing with a process of reasoning,i.e., two types of anupalabdhihetu which have different conclusions.10PVT D. 13a7: yodpa dgagpa'igtan tshigs ni bltar mi rung bami dmigspa'o (I) medpa sgrub pa'i gtan tshigs ni dmigs pa'imtshan nyidkyigyur ba mi dmigs pa b /\"The logical reason whichnegates presence is [one by] adrysdnupalabdhi (bltar mi rungba mi dmigs pa). The logical reason proving absence is that ofanupalabdhi of what has the character of being apprehendable{dmigspa'i mtshan nyidkyigyur ba = upalabdhilaksana).\"B. Only some kinds of anupalabdhi, namely drsydnupalabdhi, lead to acertainty that an object is absent, but nonetheless, both adrsya- anddrsydnupalabdhi are to be classified as pramdnas. This fact that both arepramdnas is clearly brought out in the latter part of the Svavrtti passage,and I think that we have to take the passage as meaning that both areequally full-fledgedpramdnas. Let me take this up by examining a mod-ern purvapaksa in some detail.Ernst Steinkellner, in a long note to his 1967 translation of the Hetu-bindu, had discussed the passage in the Svavrtti and had concluded thatthe negation spoken about in connection with adrsydnupalabdhi wasonly \"hypothetical\" (hypothetisch), and that it was drsydnupalabdhi whichwould have the status of a full-fledged and real (echt) negation.11 The re-sult, according to Professor Steinkellner, was as follows: \"Since by meansof this non-apprehension one does not obtain any certain knowledge,Dharmakfrti also concedes that we should not regard it to be apramdna.\"n According to Steinkellner's reading of Dharmaklrti, it wassupposedly only drsydnupalabdhi which would elicit certainty (niscaya)and which would definitively prove of some putative entity that \"it isnot there,\" or in other words, \"it is not present\" (Es ist nicht; Es ist nichtvorhanden). The former type, viz., adrsydnupalabdhi, would lead todoubt about some entity's absence and could only prove at most that\"it is not so that it is there\" (Es ist nicht, dass es ist). I think that the point"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"ADRSYANUPALABDHIHETU  159is best interpreted somewhat differently. In what follows I will try to pre-sent my reasons.First of all, a \"hypothetical\" negation, or what is worse, a \"hypothet-ical\" or somehow inferior type of pramdna, is an extremely puzzling no-tion, and we would be better off if we could avoid burdening Dharma-klrti's system with something that we can hardly understand. Thus, ourinterpretation obviously would make considerable gains in simplicityand elegance if we could do as the Tibetans and speak of both theadrsydnupalabdhi and the drsydnupalabdhi mentioned in k. 3 as beingequally full-fledged inferential pramdnas involving equally full-fledgedreal negations.Second, from a logical point of view, can we, or could Dharmaklrti,reasonably make a difference between \"It is not there\" and \"It is not sothat it is there\"? Perhaps a difference could be discerned by a sophisti-cated modern logician, but one would have to have a rather acute con-centration for any such supposed difference to become apparent. Dowe really want to impose on Dharmakirti some complicated logicalstructures which would make a distinction between Es is nichtzrxi. Es istnicht, dass es ist?\\ think the answer is that if we can avoid it, we had bet-ter not complicate an otherwise formally simple seventh-century logic.Third, there seems to be Indian evidence in support of the Tibetaninterpretation. Karnakagomin, who essentially follows Sakyabuddhi,may well give us a clearer idea of how to take the occurrences of theterms \"doubt\" and \"certainty\" in the Svavrtti passage. These commen-tators even anticipate the objection that the \"doubt\" spoken about in theSvavrtti would make it impossible for adrsydnupalabdhi to be a realpramdna, and then they go on to explain, in reply, that adrsydnupalab-dhi is a pramdiia in one respect and not in the other: in particular, it isa pramdna for denying cognition of, speech about, and action directedtowards presences (sajjndnasabdavyavahdrapratisedha), but it is not apramdna with regard to absences or exclusion (vyatireka), for in this re-spect {and I would stress only in this respect) doubt persists.13 In short, in-stead of speaking about adrsydnupalabdhi in a general way as somethinglesser or \"hypothetical\" leading to doubt, the commentators seem tosupport the view that we need to make precise distinctions specifyingthe exact propositions for which it is a pramdna and those for which itis not. This is certainly in keeping with the Tibetan approach whichdistinguishes where adrsydnupalabdhi is a pramdna and where it is not.Fourth, according to indigenous Tibetan texts, the proposition which"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"160 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEis being proven is that for such and such a person, there is no correctsubsequent cognition or no pramdna of an imperceptible thing in frontof him (... nges byed kyi dpyad shes don mthun medpa; ... nges byed kyitshadma med pa), or that this person cannot reasonably maintain or actupon the proposition that such a thing exists in a specific place (yod cesdam bca' mi rigs pa; yod nges tha snyadmi 'jug pa). This is a credible in-terpretation of sajjhdnasabdavyavahdrapratisedhaphald. Instead of takingDharmakirti to mean that adrsydnupalabdhiserves to establish a propo-sition like \"It is not so that it is there,\" the Tibetan scholastics argue thatthis type of anupalabdhi is proving that we ordinary beings cannot knowor say that an imperceptible thing is present. And that is something quitedifferent. After all, proving \"We do not know whether x is there\" isdefinitely not the same thing as proving \"It is not so that x is there.\"Last, I can imagine the following doubt a la Steinkellner: If you sayDharmakirti and his commentators maintain that adrsydnupalabdhi isa real pramdna, there must then actually be some proposition with re-gard to which it is in fact certain. Which one? Given our Tibetan-styleinterpretation of Dharmkirti's words sajjndnasabdavyavahdrapratise-dhaphald and sadvyavahdranisedhopayogdt, the doubt is, fortunately,quite easily resolved. AdrsydnupalabdhivjouXd. be a perfectly good nega-tion and a perfectly good pramdna, as good as drsydnupalabdhi, andwould even yield a type of certainty, although, of course, not one con-cerning absences of putative objects. The specific proposition that is be-ing proven by an adrs'ydmipalabdhihetu, namely the denial that there iscognition, etc. of presence, would be just as certain as the sddhya or theusual annpalabdhihetu where one proves absence of smoke when thereis no fire.C. Are there any other passages in Dharmaklrti's works, or in the worksof other Indian authors, which clearly show an acceptance of a fully pro-bative adrs'ydnupalabdhihetu? Probably not. Or at least, very few. Apartfrom the discussion in the Svavrtticoncerning PV I, k. 3, the similar pas-sages concerning PV I, k. 198—202 and the borrowings from the Svavrttiin PVin II, there are not many other sources, at least as far as I can tell.There is, however, one passage in PV IV, k. 276—277, which deservesmention and which is interpreted by some Tibetans, such as rGyal tshabrje and dGe 'dun grub pa, as speaking about the two types of anupalab-dhi.14 But the grounds provided by PV IV, k. 276-277 for imputingrecognition of a fully probative adrsydnupalabdhihetu are quite slim, and"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ADRSYANUPALABDHIHETU  l6lone would only take these verses in that sense if one had already beenconvinced by the discussion concerning PV I, k. 3. As for other Indianauthors, it is, of course, impossible for us to check everywhere, but cer-tainly this second type of anupalabdhihetu is not nearly as developed oras clear as it is in the Tibetan literature. There is of course always thepossibility that the term, or even an example of t\\\\t prayoga, might cropup now and again in other Indian authors' works, but, provisionally atleast, it seems to me unlikely that there are other very important Indiansources. It is interesting to note that 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa'i rdo rje ngagdbang brtson 'grus (1648—1721), who in his rTags rigs almost invariablycites numerous Indian textual sources for the various logical notionswhich he discusses, in this case only seems to cite PV I, k. 3 and 200,the Svavrtti passage to PV I, k. 3 and a small passage from the PVin.15These sources have either already been discussed by us or are very sim-ilar to the passages which we have taken up. 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pagives nothing other than that. One can probably conclude that other In-dian sources, if there were any, were either unknown to this great Ti-betan scholar, or seemed to him so brief, obscure or inconclusive as tobe not worth mentioning.Let us now sum up our discussion of the Tibetan contribution to un-derstanding Dharmakirti's use of adrsydnupalabdhi. Although Indianslike Sakyabuddhi and Karnakagomin did shed some light on the oth-erwise obscure passages of the PVSV and the PVin, Tibetans scholarsundoubtedly went much further, their major contribution being thatthey gave definitions of this type of hetn and explicitly formulated theprayogas at stake, and thus showed clearly the exact procedure for ar-riving at an inferential pramdna based on an adrsydmtpalabdhihetu. It isespecially this explicit formulation of the sddhya, hetu, etc. which is lack-ing in Sakyabuddhi and Karnakagomin, and which gives us so muchtrouble if we base ourselves only on the Indian sources.Finally, what information can be gleaned about the indigenous Tibetandevelopments concerning adrs'ydnupalabdhibetii? Sa skya pandita kundga' rgyal mtshan (1182—1251), in the section of his Rigs gter rang 'grel(p. 240.1.4ff.; f. I46bff.) concerning anupalabdhi, conspicuously didnot even speak of a valid adrsydnupalabdhihetu. gTsang nag pa brtson'grus seng ge (twelfth century)16 and Bu ston rin chen grub (1290—1364)"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"l6l  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEin their commentaries on the PVin passage which we cited above (andwhich largely resembles the key passage from the PVSV) did speak ofan adrsydnupalabdhihetu, but they gave explanations which did not gomuch further than the Svavrtti and Sakyabuddhi's Tikd on PV. Signif-icantly, they did not give the prayogos, and their explanations are littlemore than paraphrases of Dharmakirti.17 The same holds for the com-mentary on PV by 'U yug pa rigs pa'i seng ge (thirteenth century).18By the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, texts of the dGelugs pa school gave detailed interpretations of PV I, k. 3, definitions ofthe adrsydnupalabdhihetu as well as illustrative prayogas, often with anelaborate discussion of the fine points of the wording of these reason-ings.19 Equally, the Sa skya pa Rigs gter tradition by this time must havehad their own definitions and prayogas, although their general treatmentwas certainly different from that of the dGe lugs and even seems com-paratively simpler and less sophisticated. An idea of the Sa skya pa/Rigsgter ba position can be gained from the rTags rigs of Glo bo mkhanchen (1456-1532), which is the earliest Sa skya pa text in this genre ofliterature which we possess. (It is true that other sources inform us ofthe existence of fourteenth-century Sa skya pa rtags rigs texts—such asthat of gYag ston sangs rgyas dpal [1348—1414]—but these are, at pre-sent at least, unavailable.) By comparing Glo bo mkhan chen's rTags rigsand passages in rGyal tshab rje's rNam grel thar lam gsal byed (see ourn. 7), it is clear that Glo bo mkhan chen's position on adrsydnupalab-dhihetu reflects an earlier Rigs gter ba view, one which was alreadyknown to rGyal tshab (1364-1432) and which the dGe lugs pa scholarhad attempted to refute in his rNam 'grel thar lam gsal byed. Other Saskya pas—notably, Sakya mchogldan (1428-1507)20—also adopted thesame formulations which had earlier been the target for rGyal tshab rje'srefutations, so that it seems that by the time of Sakya mchog ldan andGlo bo mkhan chen, a distinctive Sa skya pa/Rigs gter ba view on thedefinitions and prayogas of adrsydnupalabdhihetu had been relatively wellestablished for some time. It also seems likely that this Rigs gter ba po-sition constituted a significant addition or modification to the systemof Sa skya pandita. As we saw above, Sa pan did not speak about adrsyain his discussion on anupalabdhihetu, confining himself to the drsyava-riety, all of which would suggest that although he probably knew aboutthe existence of such a type of reasoning from Indian commentaries, heattached little philosophical significance to adrsydnupalabdhihetu. It isinteresting to note that both Glo bo mkhan chen and Sakya mchog ldan"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"A D RS Y AN U P AL A B D HIH ETU  163cited a key passage from Rigsgter rang grelwhich spoke only ofdrsydnu-palabdhi; they then argued that Sa pan, in this passage, must also haveintended to include the adrs'ya variety. It is clear that for these authors,too, Sa skya pandita's omission was problematic, and it is difficult to re-sist the impression that they sought to incorporate a later philosophicaldebate into Sa pan's Rigsgter.2] We might well hypothesize then that themajor Tibetan developments on adrsydnupalabdhi took place in the con-text of the dGe lugs pa-Sa skya pa dialectic, around the fourteenth cen-tury. And if we can offer hypotheses about when things happened, wemight go one step further and speculate as to where. It would not be atall surprising if it turned out that these developments in logic centeredaround the celebrated monastery of gSang phu (s)ne'u thog, which hadboth dGe lugs pa and Sa skya pa colleges and which was a decisive in-fluence in the development of these respective logical traditions.22NOTES TO CHAPTER 71 The attribution to Lsvarasena of the doctrine of the \"logical reason pos-sessing six characters\" (sadlaksanahetu), albeit a very reasonable hypothesis,seems to be unconfirmed by any specific Indian sources. It is, however, cor-roborated in the indigenous Tibetan commentary on the PVin by rGyaltshab dar ma rin chen, where IsVarasena is explicitly named in connectionwith the sadlaksanahetu doctrine. See Steinkellner (1988: n. 47). [Editor'snote: see also Tillemans (1994), reprinted as chapter 3 in the present volume.]2 See Ruegg (1985).

See Steinkellner(1983) and the introduction to Tillemans (1993a).4 The unacceptable, or completely nonexistent, type of universal whichDharmaklrti is supposedly refuting, is one which is substantially existent(rdzasyod) and is a different object from its particulars (spyi don gzhan).Tibetan commentators stress, however, that there are universals which aresimple mental constructs and have at least conventional existence. In otherwords, it is argued that Dharmaklrti recognized the mental apoha (blo'igzhan sel), or more exactly speaking, the don spyi, \"object-universal,\" which"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"164  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEfigures so prominently in dGe lugs and Sa skya exegesis. This notion of a donspyi is used to great advantage in explaining Dharmakirti's thought, althoughit is not clear that the term don spyi (=*arthasdmdnya) itself ever explicitlyfigured in this exact use in Dharmakirti's or even in other Indian logician'sworks. Cf. the use of the term don spyi/don gyi spyi in Vinitadeva'sNydyabindufikd adNB 1.5. See, e.g., the characterization in the context ofthe definition of kalpand(p. 41.9-11 ed.

[Fxlitor's note: see n. 15 in Tillemans(1995a), reprinted as chapter 10 in the present volume.]Undoubtedly what is much more speculative is the dGe lugs pa idea thatDharmakirti accepted a fully real universal which was in essence identicalwith its particulars (ranggigsal ba dang ngo bo gcig). The justification for at-tributing this type of universal (i.e., spyi dngospo ba, \"real universal\") toDharmakirti's system is much less clear than the case of the don spyi, and itcertainly solicited long and intricate debates amongst Tibetans themselves, somuch so that it would be presumptuous for us to take sides in the context ofthis mini-resume. For a fuller development, see Dreyfus (1991: 237-328)and Dreyfus (1992).

He rejected the versionwithout this phrase as leading to the absurd consequence that the spiritwould be absent/nonexistent. The point, as developed further on by rGyaltshab rje, was that if the spirit existed, at least the Buddha would have apramdna apprehending it, and would be certain of its existence. Therefore ifwe say that there is absolutely no pramdna apprehending a spirit in front ofus, this is tantamount to saying that the spirit is nonexistent.

To take the well-worn Western example, a proposition like \"Thepresent king of France is bald\" is either false or neither true nor false, de-pending upon one's philosophical analysis, because there is no such kingto whom we can ascribe baldness. The logical dependence of the truth ofthe proposition upon the subject's existence is agreed upon, even thoughthe question whether subject failure implies falsity or presuppositionalfailure is not. Equally, a similar basic logical insight that the proposition'struth is dependent upon the subject is to be found amongst Buddhist lo-gicians, who hold that a thesis (paksa) cannot be established when the sub-ject fails, because debate about its properties will naturally cease.1 Thatsaid, there are problematic cases where a philosopher, Buddhist or oth-erwise, would certainly wish to maintain that subject failure, or dsraydsid-dha, does not occur, even though the subject is nonexistent. For the Bud-dhist logician, this philosophical problem—i.e., when asrayasiddhagenuinely occurs and when the accusation is simply misplaced—typicallycomes up in connection with such arguments as proofs of momentariness(ksanabhangasiddhi), refutations of pseudo-entities accepted by non-Bud-dhists, and in the later Madhyamaka proofs of the absence of intrinsic na-ture (nihsvabhdvatd). Thus, for example, to take an argument which fig-ures in Dharmakirti's Pramdnavdrttikasvavrttiand in the third chapter ofhis Pramdnaviniscaya, if someone manages to show that the Primordial171"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"172 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEMatter (pradhana) accepted in Samkhya philosophy does not in factexist, then the Samkhya proponent's thesis that pradhana has such andsuch properties will thereby be invalidated. This much is fairly obvious(and little different from the case of the French king's baldness). The po-tential problem arises, however, when the Buddhist himself actuallywants to show that a pseudo-entity like pradhana does not exist, or whenthe Buddhist wants to simply deny that pradhana has the essential prop-erties which the Samkhyas attribute to it. We can readily understand thatfor the Buddhist, in this type of context, where he is proving a simpledenial of existence, a charge of ds'raydsiddha must somehow be ruledout, on pain of an absurd self-refutation.The point of departure in many later Indian or Tibetan discussionson dsraydsiddha is very often Dignaga's definition of the thesis (paksa-laksana) in Pramdnasamuccaya III, k. 2, in particular, the specificationthat the thesis should not be opposed (anirdkrta) by perception andother means of valid cognition ivith regard to the proponent s own in-tended subject (svadharmini \"with, regard to his own subject\").PS III, k. 2: svarupenaiva nirdes'yah svayam isto 'nirdkrtah /pratyaksdrthdnumdndptaprasiddhena svadharmini II [A validthesis] is one which is intended (istajby [the proponent] him-self (svayam) as something to be stated (nirdesya) in its properform alone (svarupenaiva) [i.e., as a sddhya]; [and] with re-gard to [the proponent's] own subject (svadharmin), it is notopposed (anirdkrta) by perceptible objects (pratyaksdrtha), byinference (anumdna), by authorities (dpta) or by what is com-monly recognized (prasiddba).By saying that the thesis or \"what is being proven\" (sddhya) shouldnot be opposed (anirdkrta) \"with regard to [the proponent's] own [in-tended] subject (svadharmini)''1 Dignaga supposedly recognized thatnot only the property to be proved (sddhyadharma) should be unop-posed by any means of valid cognition (pramdna), but also that the pro-ponent's subject must be existent, for if the subject were not existent itcould not have the property, and hence the thesis would be invalidated.3Now, the term svadharminy which figures briefly in Dignaga's Pramd-nasamuccaya (but not in his earlier Nydyamukha), will be commentedupon in extenso in Dharmaklrti's PVIV, k. 136-48 as meaning that onehas to make a distinction between the subject actually intended by the"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE SVADHARMIN?  173proponent himself (svadharmin) and one which is just unrelated, \"iso-lated\" (kevala), or (to adopt a frequent Tibetan gloss on kevala) is sim-ply \"nominal'5 in the sense that it is spoken about but is not the actualsubject at stake.4 It is only when the proponent's actual intended sub-ject fails to exist that the fallacy of dsraydsiddha will occur. The neces-sity to make a separation between the two especially arises in the caseswhere one wishes to prove that a certain pseudo-entity is in fact nonex-istent or does not have such and such an essential property, for, as wesaw earlier, it is especially in this type of case that dsraydsiddha would bean absurd self-refutation. What is it in nonexistence proofs that makesthem of different logical structure from other proofs, so that differencesof svadharniin and kevaladharmin can (and indeed must) be made? Whatis the svadharmin and what is the kevaladharmin in such proofs?3What we find in the Indian Buddhist literature is that Dharmakirt-ian commentators, like Devendrabuddhi and Sakyabuddhi, in their ex-planations of PV IV, k. 136-48, emphasize the idea that subjects, likespace, taken as real (dngos por gyurpa = vastubhuta) by the opponents,are kevala in proofs where the property to be proved and the reason are\"mere exclusions\" (mam pargcodpa tsam - vyavacchedamdtra); in thesespecial cases, the subjects can be negated with impunity. Although De-vendrabuddhi himself does not gloss these \"mere exclusions\" by the no-tion of non-implicative negations (prasajyapratisedha) so often invokedin Buddhist philosophy, the transition is very natural and is, indeed,explicitly made by Sakyabuddhi: mere exclusion means that no entityor positive property is stated, implied or presupposed.6 The idea then isthat so long as we are merely denying that such and such a pseudo-en-tity has a property P(e.g., existence, permanence, etc.), no positive as-sertion of any other property is implied at all, and hence a charge ofdsraydsiddha would be misplaced. Such a position was adopted by writ-ers such as Prajnakaragupta, Kamalasila and by Tibetan writers such asTsong kha pa, ICang skya rol pa'i rdo rje, A lag sha ngag dbang bstandar and the Sa skya pa, Sakya mchog ldan et al.» with the further devel-opment that when a Buddhist logician is proving a mere exclusion, ornon-implicative negation, such as that the Vais'esika's space (dkdsa) is nota permanent unity or that the Samkhya's Primordial Matter (pradhdna)does not exist, the kevaladharmin is just the space or Primordial Matterwhich the adversary takes to be real, whereas the Buddhist proponent'sintended subject, the svadharmin, is the conceptual image of thesepseudo-entities. In that case, the proponent's own intended subject, i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"174 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEthe svadharmin, will be unreal externally (avastubhilta), but will nonethe-less exist qua conceptual representation; the fallacy of asrayasiddhahetuwill thus be avoided.This is, in its essentials, the approach which was advocated by laterIndian writers as well as by Tibetans, although with a number of innova-tions and refinements centering on the theory of apoha and on the natureof the conceptual representations, as well as some interesting discussionsin the Tibetan literature on subtleties such as whether prasajyapratisedhawould always allow us to avoid dsraydsiddha or whether a conceptualsubject could only legitimately have prasajyapratisedha as its properties.7In fact, as we shall show, there are competing scenarios as to what thesvadharmin was for Dharmakirti and Dignaga when they dealt withBuddhist refutations of the pseudo-entities accepted by their adversaries.First scenario: The proponent's own intended subject (sva-dbarmin) in nonexistence proofs and proofs of simple negationsis taken to be just a conceptual representation of the entity inquestion and not the entity itself.Second scenario: The reasoning in question should be para-phrased so that the svadharmin and the property to be provedare to be understood in ways acceptable to the Buddhist pro-ponent himself.Now, the first way to take the svadharmin, which we shall designateas being the \"Principle of Conceptual Subjects,\" turns on a deliberaterapprochement with Dignaga's discussion, in his Nydyamukha, of the ar-gument against the existence of Primordial Matter (pradhdna -prakrti)and hence with the corresponding discussions in Dharmaklrti's PVSVand PVin III.8 The second approach (i.e., the \"Method of Paraphrase\")is probably what figures in the discussion on svadharmin in Pramdna-samuccaya(vrtti) III and Pramdnavdrttika IV. It is, broadly speaking,close to the Method of Paraphrase which was used in Nydyamukha toanalyse the Samkhya's supposed proofTor pradhdna existing because ofthe individual things all bearing the same general characteristic.Let us first look at the Nydyamukha and Pramdnasamuccaya in a bitmore detail.9 In the Nydyamukha, Dignaga had discussed different ar-guments in connection with the Samkhya school, the first argument be-ing a supposed Samkhya proof of the existence of pradhdna due to the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE SVADHARMIN?  175various individual things possessing the same general characteristic, thesecond being a Buddhist argument to show pradhana s nonexistence. Inboth cases, given that the subject of the argument was pradhdna, apseudo-entity, there was a potential charge of dsraydsiddha. Dignaga, inthe first case, had avoided this charge by giving what he took to be amore rigorous philosophical paraphrase of the opponent's argument:\"For them, [as for the first syllogism,] they should formulatethe thesis as 'The various individuals certainly possess one andthe same cause [i.e., pradhdna],' in which case they do notprove [directly the existence of] the Primordial Matter [i.e.,dharmin].\"Dignaga then took up the second reasoning, \"Primordial Matter (pra-dhdna) and so forth are nonexistent because they are not perceived\" (nasantipradhdnddayo 'nupalat?dheh),w and avoided the fault of dsraydsid-dha by invoking the idea of the subject being merely conceptual:\"When they [i.e., the Buddhists] argue that [Primordial Mat-ter] does not exist [because of nonperception], 'nonpercep-tion' is a property of the imagined object [i.e., pradhdna](kalpitasydnupalahdhir dharmah).\"It is noteworthy that later, in the subsequent parallel discussion in PSIII, Dignaga prudently avoided even mentioning the problematical sec-ond reasoning and that elsewhere, taking up pradhdna, he seems to haveadvocated more rigid strictures, excluding as illegimate all argumentswhich had such unacknowledged pseudo-entities as subjects. PrimordialMatter was not to be a subject of inference. As Katsura has pointed outrecently, what may be the case is that Dignaga had little place in Pra-mdnasamuccaya for such proofs at all, and that Dignaga, in his later writ-ings, tended towards a logic in which unreal or conceptual subjects couldhave no role.11Be that as it may, Dharmaklrti used the argument in Dignaga's Nyd-yamukha proving die nonexistence of pradhdna as well as the Nydyamukhdsphrase kalpitasydnupalabdhir dharmah12 to come up with a general prin-ciple in PV I, k. 205-12, the Svavrtti and PVin III that the directly sig-nified objects of words were always conceptual representations (kalpand);he then maintained that although pradhdna did not exist as something"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"176 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEreal and external, its conceptual representation, or in other words, theobject of the word (sabddrtha) existed, so that the charge of dsraydsid-dha did not apply.

Significantly enough, though, the actual passages in Pramdna-vdrttika IV (and in Pramdnasamuccaya III) which discuss svadharrnin donot mention or even allude to this idea of the subject in such proofs be-ing a conceptual representation at all. The application of the generalidea of apoha and sabddrtha found in PV I, k. 205—6 to the svadharmin-kevaladharmin context figures only in the commentators.We seem to have commentators taking notions from one context,i.e., the anti-Samkhya discussion in the Nydyamukha, Svavrtti and Pra-mdnaviniscaya and the theory of anupalabdhi and apoha, and imposingthem on another, namely, the discussion about svadharmin in Pramdna-samuccaya(vrtti) III and Pramdnavdrttika IV.

In particular, Prajnakaragupta makes it clearthat one interpretation of these kdrikds was to invoke what we havetermed the \"the Principle of Conceptual Subjects\": the actual intendedsubject is not the space which the Vais'esika takes to be a real externalentity (vastubhuta)—that is only the nominal subject, the otic which isspoken about, but is not what possesses the properties to be proved orthe reason—the svadharmin is the conceptual representation of space.Thus, according to Prajnakaragupta, on this first scenario the svadhar-min, on the basis of which the proponent proves that space does not have\"anovel nature unproduced [by causal conditions]\" (na...anulpddydpur-variipa)^ is unreal (avastubhuta) and is completely derived from con-ceptualisation.The other interpretation of Pramdnavdrttika IV, k. 141—42 men-tioned by Prajnakaragupta—an interpretation which clearly turns onthe Method of Paraphrase—is that the svadharmin is not the Vais'esika'spermanent unitary space, nor the conceptual representation, but ratherthe impermanent space which the Buddhist himself accepts. The argu-ment in k. 141—42 thus has to be paraphrased and actually means thatspace is impermanent because it produces effects sequentially. We quotek. 141—42 along with Prajnakaragupta's Pramdnavdrttikabhdsya:PV IV, k. 141—42: yathd parair amitpddydpurvarupamx(i nakhddikam I sakrc chabdddyahetntvdd ity ukte prdba diisakah IItadvad vastusvabhdvo 'san dbarmi vyomddir ity api I naivatnistasya sddbyasya bddhd kdcana17 vidyate//\"For example, when[the Buddhist] states that space, etc. do not have a novel na-ture unproduced by other [conditions] because they are notcauses for [producing their qualities such as] sound, etc. all atonce, then the [Vais'esika] adversary might say that like thatthe subject, space, etc., would also not have the nature of a realentity.

In that way, it proves thata subject such as space is not real (vastutvdhhdva)J [Reply:] Anunrelated invalidation of the subject is not faulty. Indeed, theproponent commits no fault like this. For, precisely what heintends to prove is that space and so forth are not real. Con-sequently, there is no fault in saying with reference to a sub-ject, unreal space (avastubhutdkdsadbarmini), that space doesnot have a novel nature unproduced [by other causal condi-tions], because it is not a cause [for producing its effects suchas sound] all at once. This is because [he] establishes the[property] to be proved on the basis of a subject which is com-pletely derived from conceptualization (vikalpaparinisthitedharmini sddhyasddhandd). But: a real thing is not the subjectof that [property]. Therefore, although there is invalidationof this unrelated (kevala) [subject], there is [in fact] no fault.This is what is meant by the word svadharmin [in Pramd-nasamuccaya]. Indeed, when the opponent's subject is inval-idated it is not so that this property [i.e., nonexistence] willbe unestablished. So, as there is nothing annuling the estab-lishment of the property to be proved (sddhyadharma), thereis no fault.Alternatively, this [reasoning that space] does not have a novelunproduced nature because it is not the cause [for its effects]all at once, has the following meaning: space is impermanent.To this an adversary might say that the subject, permanentspace, has been invalidated. But let it be invalidated. Even sothe subject will be impermanent space. For, the contrary ofthe [property] to be proved will definitely be invalidated bythe logical reason. And indeed a permanent subject is not thelocus for the property to be proved under discussion, so whenit is invalidated how could there be any fault at all!\"19The question immediately arises: Which of the two interpretations,or two scenarios, best fits Pramanavdrttika IV? Or, in other words: Howexactly did Dharmakirti make the distinction between the proponent'sown intended subject (svadharmin)'and unrelated (kevala)subjects in PVIV, k. 136-48? Did Dharmakirti opt for an approach which relied uponthe Principle of Conceptual Subjects or did he use the Method of Para-"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE SVADHARMIN?  179phrase? In our opinion, there can be little doubt: Dharmaklrti's positionin PV IV was the Method of Paraphrase. The commentators' attemptsto read a Principle of Conceptual Subjects into k. 136-48 are an at-tempt to read the Svavrtti-Pramdnaviniscaya discussion of apoha,sabddrtha and anupalabdhi'into a context where it does not easily belong.That said, most, if not all, of the later Indo-Tibetan tradition has un-derstood the relevant kdrikds in Dharmaklrti's Pramdnavdrttika IV ac-cording to the first scenario!If we look at the rest of the discussion in this section of Pramdnavdrt-tika IV, it is clear that k. 144-45 is a complete parallel to k. 141-42:what holds for the latter should hold for the former. In k. 144-^45, Dhar-makirti is confronted by the objection that if his refutation of theVaisesika's permanent space is correct, then a certain Buddhist argu-ment against the Samkhya will fail, for the Buddhist will have to facethe charge that refuting the subject would lead to invalidation of thewhole thesis and hence viruddhahetu. Briefly said, the negative existen-tial proof would turn out to be self-refuting. The stated subject of theanti-Samkhya argument is \"pleasure, etc.\" (sukhddi), that is to say, \"plea-sure, pain and bewilderment,\" each of these terms being understood inthe light of Samkhya philosophy where each feeling is correlated withone of the three gunas (\"qualities\"), these gunas in turn being of theessence of Primordial Matter. The Buddhist then argues that pleasure,etc., i.e., pradhana, is not the permanent nature of the various effects ortransformations (vikrti) making up the world, because if it were, thenall its effects such as sound and the like would have to be produced si-multaneously, and such is not in fact the case. Here the Samkhya sup-posedly retorts that refuting the permanence of pleasure, etc., i.e.,pradhdna, is tantamount to refuting the subject itself. Dharmakirti thenuses the Method of Paraphrase, to maintain that what the proponent isactually proving is that ordinary (and real) pleasure, etc., which are ac-knowledged by all, are impermanent, because they produce their effectssequentially (kramakriyd)—thus one does not refute the proponent'sactual subject, which is pleasure, etc. taken as the ordinary, impermanentand fully real entity (vastubhuta) accepted by Buddhists and others alike,and not the theoretical pseudo-entity \"pleasure, etc.\" as accepted byonly Samkhya philosophers.The parallel with k. 141-42 is striking and deliberate: the argumentshave the exact same reasons and virtually the same sddhyadharma, dif-fering only in their choice of subjects, i.e., space, etc. or pleasure, etc. If"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"180 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEDharmakirti's whole argument is to work, then the svadharmin ink. 141-42 cannot be the conceptual representation, it must be the Bud-dhist's own accepted notion of impermanent space; just as in k. 144—45the svadharmin is notm unreal conceptual representation, but is just theordinary accepted entities. Not only that, but if we look at the termsused in Prajiiakaragupta's description of the first approach (i.e., relyingon the Principle of Conceptual Subjects), when Prajnakaragupta speaksof vikalpaparinisthite dharmini sddhyasddhandd the choice of words de-liberately mirror k. 205 s anddivdsanodbhutavikalpaparinisthitah. Thematter is thus probably as follows: the first approach, where one takesPramdnavarttika IV's discussion of svadharmin versus kevaladharminalong the lines of the first scenario is a commentator's strategy consist-ing in a transposition into Pramdnavarttika IV of a discussion elsewherein Dharmaklrti, but it is a transposition which probably does not fit theactual context of Dharmakirti's argumentation of svadharmin and ke-valadharmin.I would not want to suggest that this \"transposition\" grossly falsifiesthe notion of svadharmin—that type of conclusion would not only looksomewhat arrogant on our part but would denigrate the creative syn-theses that commentators typically make in juxtaposing a doctrine in onepart of a work with one in another. Nonetheless, I think it is importantto see this later synthesis for what it is and that it probably did not al-ready figure in Dignaga and Dharmakirti's own thought. The questionof conceptual representations being the subject in negative proofs wasmost likely not at stake in Pramdnavarttika IV, k. 1 3 6-48, this in spiteof the fact that so many authors from Prajnakaragupta and Kamalas'llato Tsong kha pa and Ngag dbang bstan dar cite these kdrikds as thesource for the idea that the svadharmin is a conceptual representation.A final remark. It is probably fair to say that the histoiy of Buddhistthought about dsraydsiddha and svadharmin would have been quite dif-ferent if the Method of Paraphrase had been emphasized and further de-veloped by later writers. Was it a good thing that the solution by con-ceptual representation became predominant in Buddhist logic? A typeof Method of Paraphrase can be used very well to deal with the prob-lem of talk about non-being, as we see in certain contemporary appli-cations of Russell's Theory of Descriptions. We can, for example, para-phrase \"Pegasus does not exist,\" or \"Pegasus does not fly\" as repectively:\"There is no x which is Pegasus\" or \"There is no x, such that x is Pega-sus and x flies, etc.\"; these approaches avoid the problem of a pseudo-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE SVADHARMIN?  181entity nonetheless existing somehow as a concept. Paraphrase starts withthe assumption that what is literally said is often not what is actuallymeant, and this assumption yields an extremely effective approach foravoiding commitment to needless conceptual entities. Thus a sentencelike \"I did it for Peter's sake\" bears only an apparent similarity to \"I didit for Peter's brother.\" Although we are committed to the existence ofbrothers, we are not actually obliged to accept that there are odd meta-physical or purely conceptual entities known as \"sakes\": \"sakes\" can beparaphrased away when we reformulate what we really mean. However,the Buddhists did not go that route; arguably they took a less promis-ing path, fraught with avoidable problems. Indeed, the later Tibetanwritings on the problem show just how complicating a development itwas to mix apoha with the svadharmin-kevaladharmin problem. It is cu-rious that most elements for a satisfactory theory of talk about non-be-ing were already present to varying degrees in Dharmakirti and some ofthe earlier commentators: a developed use of philosophical paraphraseand a theory of negation without presupposition of existence. The prob-lem of dsraydsiddha could have been treated purely as one: concerningthe logical form of statements and negations, but the temptation to turnto the all-purpose and ever-present semantic theory of apoha seems tohave been irresistable. In the hands of commentators less taken withapoha, things could perhaps have turned out to be much simpler, butthey did not.NOTES TO CHAPTER 81 Cf. PV IV, k. 76-79, translated in Tillemans (1995b).

Likewise, the Dutch logician Evert Willem Beth empha-sized on numerous occasions1 the importance of the study of Indian logicfor the general philosophy of logic. It was, however, Beth's compatriot,J.F. Staal, who actually undertook concrete research on the subject. Staaltreated the topic in several articles, including one on the Nyaya-Vais'esikatheory of definition, another on negation according to the Mlmarnsakas,and a third concerning the use of contraposition in various Indian schools.In this regard, we should also mention the works of the late Bimal KrishnaMatilal of Oxford University. This remarkable philosopher, trained inboth the traditional logic of Nyaya-Vais'esika and analytical philosophy,has left us numerous studies on the logical and epistemological problemswithin the Indian philosophical schools. In 1970, he founded the Jour-nal of Indian Philosophy, a journal whose aim is to apply the methods ofanalytical philosophy to the problems of Indian philosophy.To demonstrate the importance of such studies, we could, of course,cite the names of many other scholars who work on the border betweenAsian studies and philosophy. We must recognize, however, that this ap-proach bears considerable difficulties and that it can currently be practicedby only those who have sound training in Asian languages. The presentstate of research is such that translations and editions of numerous prin-cipal texts are far from completion, and among those that are available,187"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"188  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEa good number are mediocre. It is thus understandable that some schol-ars maintain that it would be premature to attempt serious work oncomparative logic or epistemology—an opinion one often hears amongboth Asianists and philosophers. In part, this objection is justified, sinceat this point, a philosopher who is not competent in Asian languagesruns the risk of basing his analyses or theories on incomplete or erro-neous data.There is another objection against a philosophical approach to Asianstudies—an objection that even now has numerous advocates, at leastamong Anglo-American philosophers. Allow me to cite a particularly re-vealing passage from Anthony Flew's work, An Introduction to WesternPhilosophy, published in 1971:...philosophy, as the word is understood here, is concernedfirst, last and all the time with argument. It is, incidentally,because most of what is labeled Eastern Philosophy is not soconcerned—rather than any reason of European parochial-ism—that this book draws no materials from any source eastof Suez.2The objection amounts to two points: (a) philosophy should devote it-self primarily to rational argumentation; (b) Asian philosophers do notexercise any—or, at least, very little—rational argumentation. Mostprobably, the second point stems from the opinion that Asian philoso-phers are primarily mystics, and that hence, they are irrational and bereftof argumentation. Professor Matilal devoted a large part of his acade-mic career to the refutation of this received idea, and it is not necessaryto replicate that discussion here. Let us simply note that in the philoso-phies of India, Tibet and China, there is an imposing number of philo-sophical and rational works that are not mystical at all. And in any case,when a religious goal—or even a mystical one—figures explicitly or im-plicitly in a text, the argumentation is often so autonomous that it is ofconsiderable philosophical interest even for one who does not share theauthor's religious goals.The idea, moreover, that Indian philosophy is essentially mysticaland that hence it is bereft of rational argumentation is a non-sequitur. Letus suppose that a good part of these traditions are influenced by sometype of mysticism: it does not thereby follow that rational argumenta-tion stemming from or leading to those mystical ideas will be absent or"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 189insignificant. To take a similar case in Western philosophy, would wedare to be so severe with the mystical philosophy of the Tractatus, whereWittgenstein sought the limits of language so as to transcend those lim-its? No one would claim that Wittgenstein had renounced rational ar-gumentation. In the Buddhism of the Madhyamaka school—of whichwe will often speak in this article—the philosopher also uses logic to ar-rive at an understanding beyond all argumentation and discursive thought.But as with the Tractatus, the majority of Madhyamaka writings are de-voted to rational argumentation.If Anthony Flew's ideas are typical of an approach where one tendsto underestimate the role of argumentation in Asian thought, there isanother widespread belief regarding Asian thought. On this view, oneadmits that these philosophies employ arguments, but one maintainsthat their ways of reasoning diverge substantially from our own, or eventhat their forms of rationality are incommensurable with occidentalthought. Indeed, there are Indian texts containing arguments that mayseem difficult to reconcile with the most fundamental laws of Westernlogic. We are thinking primarily of problematic passages found in Bud-dhist texts such as the Sutra on the Perfection of Wisdom (Pmjndpdra-mitdsiltra), the famed Stanzas on the Middle Way (Madhyamakakarika)composed by Nagarjuna (third century C.E.), or the Four Hundreds(Catuhsataka) of his disciple Aryadeva. Within Buddhist thought, thestructure of argumentation that seems the most resistant to our attemptsat formalization is undoubtedly the tetralemma or catuskofi. This struc-ture appears scattered throughout the canonical Mahayana literature,but it is above all found in the works of Nagarjuna and Aryadeva, whereit becomes the method par excellence used by the Madhyamaka to refuteall philosophical theses.The Catuhsataka speaks of the tetralemma in the following manner:sad asut sadasac ceti sadasun neti ca kramah I esa prayojyo vid-vadbhir ekatvddisu nityasah II'\"Being, non-being, [both] be-ing and non-being, neither being [nor] non-being: such is themethod that the wise should always use with regard to iden-tity and all other [theses].'We have here the four alternatives at their most abstract level: being,non-being, both at the same time, and neither one nor the other. TheMadhyamaka method for arriving at absolute truth is to refute all four"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"T9O  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEalternatives, regardless of the proposition to which they apply.Clearly, the conjunction of these four negations would make a West-ern logician dizzy, since, at first glance, the Madhyamaka offers us thefollowing four statements:4[i] -P[2] ~P[3]-(/>&-/>)[4]-(-/>&:-/>)Since (1) and (2) would imply -(P v ~P), the law of the excludedmiddle falls by the wayside, but what is worse, we would likewiseencounter various contradictions: -P & ~~P from [1] and [2];(-/>& --P) & -(- P&c ~ P) from [1], [2], and [4]; or again simplyP & -Pfrom [1] and [2] by the law of double negation.A logically trivial interpretation of the tetralemma would be to con-sider it to be a uniquely \"therapeutic\" use of language and hence closeto what the positivists of the Vienna Circle called \"non-cognitive state-ments.' The four negations would therefore be pseudo-propositions de-void of any truth-value: they would just be one of the many Buddhisttechniques designed to halt ordinary thought—as with the riddles(koan)t the blows from the teacher's staff, or the sudden shouts that ful-fill the same function in the Zen schools. The great Asianist Louis de laVallee Poussin thought that the tetralemma could be understood onlyin this manner, that is, as a psychological technique designed to inducea certain meditative state: \"Nagarjunism [i.e., Madhyamaka] is withoutphilosophical significance... [it] contains nothing but a method for pu-rifying the mind.\"5Louis de la Vallee Poussin's notion has appeared with numerous per-mutations in the works of diverse authors. We cannot address all ofthese permutations here, but they nearly always have as their conse-quence the denial of any propositional content or truth value as applic-able to any of the tetralemma's four negations. And it is precisely in thisregard that this interpretation is insufficient, for it minimizes the roleand the seriousness of argumentation in the Madhyamaka system. True,the contemplation of the four negations is indeed a method, an updya,for halting discursive thought. Nevertheless, to say that the tetralemmais nothing but a psychological technique amounts to neglecting—ortrivializing—the numerous rigorous arguments advanced by the Madhy-amaka in support of each negation. Typically, the Madhyamaka uses this"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 191structure to argue in detail against opposing positions that, accordingto him, adopt one or another of the alternatives. He thus employspremises that are acceptable to the adversary so as to show him that hisposition is absurd, and that it actually implies its own contrary. But ifNagarjuna uses the logic and metaphysics of his adversaries to refutetheir positions, one must nevertheless suppose that he believed his ownreasoning by reductio ad absurdum to be not a mere ruse or sophism, butrather an argument that was valid and that resulted in a true conclusion,albeit negative.We find among Asianists a long debate on the question of whetherthe tetralemma—as well as other, similar forms of reasoning rooted inthe canonical texts of the Mahayana—stands as an example of a radicaldivergence between Asian logics and the classical logic of the West. Pro-fessor D. Seyfort Ruegg, in his excellent article on the use of the tetra-lemma,6 has summarized the numerous attempts at translating this struc-ture of Buddhist thought into the terminology of classical Western logic.He has likewise summarized the analyses that rely on alternative logic,including, for example, L. Mall's semiotic analysis and the treatment byJ.F. Staal based upon intuitionist logic.7Undoubtedly, we must admit that the initial attempts at applyingclassical logic to the most recalcitrant structures of Mahayana Buddhistthought—most notably the tetralemma—have been failures. But whatconclusion should we draw from these repeated setbacks? The stakes arehigh, for numerous philosophers currently apply themselves to the prob-lem of knowing whether the formal calculi of alternative logics reallyhave a field of application. It is thus of some importance to determinewhether Buddhist texts provide examples of discourse that obey logicallaws other than those of classical Western logic. In short, our problemis essentially located within the scope of a philosophical debate, initiatedby W. V. Quine,8 on the question of knowing whether alternative log-ics are possible and whether they have, in fact, a field of application.At this point, our terminology requires some clarification. First of all,we must alert the reader that our term \"Buddhist logic\" does not trans-late any Sanskrit term. Generally, the term is used as a conventionaldesignation for a certain school of Buddhist philosophy or a type ofthought identified particularly with the school of Dignaga and Dhar-maklrti—that is also how we have used the term in other publications.9Here, however, what we shall call \"Buddhist logic\" is a translation—asfaithful as possible—into modern logic of the formal structures of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"192 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEthought found in Buddhist texts. Our project requires such a transla-tion, since one obviously cannot ask about the possible deviance of a sys-tem that has not been sufficiently formalized. Hence, in the followingpages, our arguments will essentially concern the adequacy of certain for-mal translations of the structures of Buddhist thought and the formalproperties of the calculi employed in such translations.By the term \"classical logic,\" we understand the first order proposi-tional and predicate calculus that one generally finds in a work on ele-mentary logic.10 What then would be the difference between a non-das-sical logic and a deviant ond Since the beginning of this century, varioustypes of logics have proliferated: sometimes they are studied for theirpossible philosophical contributions, at other times, for their formalcharacter. Among these logics, several types, such as modal or epistemiclogic, are not true rivals of classical logic; rather, they are supplements—to employ the distinction presented by Susan Haack in the first chapterof her Deviant Logic}x According to Haack, a logic L\\ is a supplementfor logic L2 when:(a) the sets of formulae and theorems of L2 are included inthe respective sets of L\\(b) all of the surplus theorems of Lj contain vocabulary thatis supplementary to that of L2.If I/? is classical logic, the supplementary logic Lj described by (a) and(b) will be considered a non-classical logic, but not a deviant one. In con-trast, an L\\ will be deviant relative to L2 if Lj has the same formulae andlogical vocabulary as L2, but nevertheless does not have the same set oftheorems as L2. Thus, a logic can have the same set of formulae as clas-sical logic and use its vocabulary, while still rejecting some of the mostimportant classical theorems. This is precisely the case for J. Lukasie-wicz's multi-valued logic—as it is the case for intuitionist logic—thatdoes not accept as theorems the laws of the excluded middle and doublenegation. These logics are not supplements but rather rivals to classicallogic.Another distinction proposed by Haack will prove useful: this is theone between global deviance and local deviance. The first type of devianceapplies to all subjects of discourse, while the second is restricted to alimited domain of discourse. It is thus possible to use a deviant logic for"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 193mathematics or quantum physics while still retaining the use of classi-cal logic in other domains of discourse—this would be a case of localdeviance. In contrast, some neo-intuitionists such as M. Dummett applytheir logic to all cases and would thus recommend a global deviance.Let us return now to Buddhist logic, or more precisely, to our at-tempts at translating the statements of Buddhist philosophers into a for-mal logic. We should begin by noting that any potential deviance inBuddhist logic would be, at most, local. The structures of argumentationmost frequently employed by Buddhists—including the Madhyamakas—do not present any violation of our classical logical laws. Here, we arethinking, for example, of the so-called \"Buddhist syllogism,\" or moreprecisely, what the Buddhists themselves call an \"inference-for-others\"(pardrthdnumdna). Consider this example:All that which is conditioned is impermanent, like a vase.Now, sound is conditioned.In fact, this form of argumentation is not a syllogism in the Aris-totelian sense. The pardrthdnumdna—at least the version unanimouslyaccepted after Dharmakirti (sixth to seventh century C.E.)—only hastwo members and cannot itself state a conclusion. Indeed, from the sev-enth century onward, the addition of a conclusion, such as \"therefore,sound is impermanent,\" is considered a \"point of defeat\" (nigrabasthdna)}2Clearly, though, there is no question as to whether the logic involvedhere is deviant or not. Although the metalogical explanations for thefunctioning of inference diverge from our own, we are not confrontedwith a reasoning that would necessitate a translation into a logic that re-jects or violates the most fundamental laws of logic, such as contradic-tion, double negation and the excluded middle.We should likewise note that no surprises arise from fornialization ofother Buddhist notions, such as those analogous to material implication,conjunction, disjunction and other logical constants. Nor does the fa-mous theory of vydptiot \"pervasion\" provoke any formal surprises. Forexample, when Buddhist authors say that the property \"is conditioned\"(krtakatva) is pervaded by the property \"imperrnanence\" (anityatd), theymean that all conditioned things are impermanent. In other words, inour terminology, vydpti is translatable, in part at least, as a universalstatement: for all x, if xis conditioned, then xis impermanent.13 Inter-estingly, the quantification expressed by \"for all x\" is certainly not lim-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"194 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEited to existent things, because the variable x also represents fictive en-tities. Nevertheless, while this reinterpretation of quantification differsfrom the usual interpretation in predicate calculus, it does not entailany deviance at all. In short, in many cases Buddhist argumentationmight possibly require the introduction of some operators and termsthat would be supplementary with regard to those of first order predicatelogic We would thus be obliged to employ a non-classical logic (in thesense of the term that we have specified), but the vast majority of argu-ments found in Buddhist texts do not require translation into a deviantlogic. If there is any deviance, it can only be highly local.Before continuing our analysis, we should respond to a possible ob-jection. Is it possible that the tetralemma—which appears to violate thelaw of contradiction—might constitute a case of local deviance? Onecan easily show that any contradictory statement whatsoever entails allother statements, even those that are in violation of the most funda-mental laws of logic. As a result, a single inconsistency appears to leadinexorably to the most global deviance imaginable.14 An intuitionistlogic, such as that of L. Brouwer and A. Heyting, only rejects the lawsof double negation and the excluded middle, and this rejection does notentail uncontrollable implications. It is, however, far more difficult toenvisage a calculus that does not admit the inviolability of the law of con-tradiction. It is hence imperative to know whether one can limit a logic'sdeviance while at the same time admitting exceptions to the law of con-tradiction.Clearly, until recently the law of contradiction has been consideredas an inviolable principle almost unanimously among logicians. Never-theless, the old menace of uncontrolled implications has now been calledinto question by some of our more illustrious logicians, and inconsis-tent logics have thus become an acknowledged field of research. We candistinguish two strands within modern research on such logics: (a) for-mal calculi which contain several truth-values, such as the calculi of G.Priest,5 and which admit contradictions but preclude unlimited impli-cations; and (b) the semantics of N. Rescher and R. Brandom,16 whichadmits an uncontrolled implication only in the case of a strong incon-sistency (for Rescher and Brandom, it is possible, for example, to affirmthat P is true and to affirm that non-P is true without, however, ad-mitting the truth of the statement, P and non-P—this latter would ineffect be a strong contradiction). The lesson that we can draw from thesemodern developments in logic is at once radical and surprising: there is"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 195no formal requirement thata priori prevents us from adopting a literal read-ing of the paradoxical passages in the Madhyamakakdrikd, the Catuhsataka,and the Prajnaparamitasutra. From the perspective of formal logic, thesetexts can include inconsistencies without becoming irrational discourses)1 Inother words, nothing in formal logic stops us from saying that, in thevast majority of cases, the Buddhist uses a consistent logic but that, incertain contexts, he clearly accepts paradoxes. Of course, a paradoxicalinterpretation of Buddhist discourse is nothing new. Some of the earlygreat Buddhologists, such as E. Conze and D. Suzuki, were convincedthat \"the logic of the prajndpdramita' is indeed paradoxical. This posi-tion may currently have few adherents, but it is nevertheless importantto emphasize that one cannot exclude it without systematic, textual ar-guments: one cannot a priori sweep this opinion under the carpet by say-ing that the acceptance of contradictions amounts to irrationality.This is not the place to examine passage after passage of the works ofNagarjuna and Aryadeva. The reader can profitably consult the publi-cations of scholars such as D. Seyfort Ruegg, J. May, G. Bugault, P.Williams and others. Elsewhere, we have already discussed the logic ofthe Madhyamaka and its interpretation in recent publications.18 We willcontent ourselves here with raising three systemic points that militateagainst the attribution of a paradoxical logic to Buddhists:(a) The prohibition against \"contradiction\" (virodha) is accepted by allschools of Indian philosophy, including the Buddhist schools. Itwould thus be surprising if a treatise by a great Buddhist philoso-pher were to go against such a key principle.19(b) Buddhists themselves invoke a schema of two truths—the absolutetruth and the superficial—so as to explain how one can affirm aproposition from one point of view and yet negate it from another.And since the time of Aristotle, we have considered a real contra-diction to be the affirmation and negation of the same proposi-tion from the same point of view.20(c) A number of Indian authors exhibit the stylistic tendency to choosecondensed, enigmatic, and provocative modes of expression. Thesestatements inevitably assume a non-paradoxical meaning whenthey are explained by the authors themselves or by their commen-tators."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"1^)6  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGELet us take two particularly revealing examples of this stylistic ten-dency to deliberately employ paradoxical turns of phrase. The first ex-ample occurs in the Madhydntavibhdga, a Mahayanist text attributed toMaitreya:sattvddasattvdtsattvdc ca madhyamdpratipac ca sd//\"Due toexistence, due to nonexistence, and due to existence, this is themiddle way.\"21At first glance, at least, this passage may seem contradictory, but Va-subandhu (fourth century) clearly tells us that Maitreya is speaking ofthe existence of unreal conceptual constructions (abhiltaparikalpa), thenonexistence of all duality, and the existence of the emptiness of theunreal conceptual constructions. One can only agree with Ruegg, whoconcludes his discussion of this passage with this remark: \"there seemstherefore to be no question here of attributing to one and the same en-tity opposed properties on the same level of reference and from the samepoint of view \"22Let us now turn to an example of this same stylistic tendency in theVdkyapadiya, a work of the non-Buddhist author Bhartrhari:tan ndsti vidyate tac ca tad ekam tat prthak prthak Isamsrstamca vibhaktam ca vikrtam tat tadanyathd//\"It [i.e., substance]does not exist, and it exists; it is one and it is divided; it is con-joined and it is separate; it is modified and it is other [thanmodified].\"\"As J. Bronkhorst points out, in the context of Bhartrhari's system thisstanza must be understood as a description of substance from two dif-ferent points of view—namely, as an absolute and indivisible reality,and as the phenomenal diversity of the world. Bronkhorst explains: \"Theindivisible totality is real, one and without modifications; its division—that is, the phenomenal world—is unreal, variegated, separate and mod-ified.\"24 As with Vasubandhu and Maitreya, here too the paradoxes dis-appear.How then are we to dissipate the seeming paradoxes of the tetra-lemma's four negations within an adequate translation of that structureinto modern logic? First of all, the Madhyamaka, in using the tetra-lemma, appears to wish to refute above all the attribution of properties"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 197(whether affirmative or negative) to real entities (bhdva).15 Such a pro-ject involves negations that concern things' absolute status—it does notseem to easily involve four unqualified negations in a simple preposi-tional calculus, as we have presented them in [l]-[4]. Some commen-tators—such as Bhavaviveka, but especially some Tibetans—have triedto add qualifications such as \"truly established\" (Tib. bden par grub pa)or \"established from an absolute perspective\" (Tib. don dam par grubpa)\" so as to indicate clearly the level of discourse implicit in the use ofthe negation operators. This technique was used with great mastery byTsong kha pa bio bzang grags pa, the great Tibetan commentator of thefourteenth century; he managed to transform the tetralemma into a sortof modal logic where the laws of double negation, excluded middle, andcontradiction function in a classical manner.26 Let us just consider herehis version of the first two negations; they respectively become: \"Pis notestablished from an absolute perspective\" and \"non-Pis not establishedfrom an absolute perspective.\" It is evident that these two propositionscan both be true without imperiling the laws of contradiction and ex-cluded middle. The result is that the negations of the tetralemma wouldbe translated into structures that are at most supplementary with regardto classical logic.Indisputably, Tsong kha pa's interpretation offers advantages in termsof its logical clarity, but as an exegesis of Madhyamaka, his approach mayseem somewhat inelegant, since it obliges us to add words almost every-where in the Madhyamaka texts. Remarkably, Tsong kha pa himself ac-tually accomplished this project down to its most minute details in hiscommentary on the Madhyamakakdrikds—perhaps at the price of sac-rificing the simplicity of Nagarjuna's language.27 Hence, is there a sim-pler and more elegant interpretation of the tetralemma that also takesaccount of the negation of bhdvas, this denial of all ontology that lies atthe heart of Madhyamaka philosophy? In the final portion of this article,we will sketch out a solution by proposing two ways of understandingthe quantification implicit in the Buddhist's statements.A logic without ontological commitment is possible. For some years,scholars such as R.B. Marcus, N. Belnap, R. Routley and others haveregularly reinterpreted quantification in such a manner that the variablesdo not refer to objects in a domain but rather to terms that form a substi-tution class.28 This tactic consists in proposing a substitutional seman-tics in lieu of the usual referential semantics, and it has been profitablyemployed within modal and epistemic contexts, as well as in fictional"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"198  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEcontexts, where one reasons about \"things\" that are devoid of any real-ity. In short, when interpreted in an substitutional manner, (Fx) Fx(\"there is an .vsuch that Fx\") does not mean that there actually exists areal entity that has the quality F, but rather that there is a name a suchthat the substitution of a for the variable x\\n Fx yields a true sentence.Thus, if we wish, we can avoid all ontological commitment. In fact,most Western logicians who use a substitutional interpretation believethat reference to things is essential to any veritable language, and thatas a result, one must introduce a referential relation that ties at least somenames to objects. Nevertheless, a purely substitutional interpretationdevoid of any such reference to real things remains feasible. D. Vernantdescribes such a semantics:.. .the truth of the atomic sentences [of the language] LQ is de-fined, ab initio, in a purely conventional fashion, abstractingfrom all actual reference. This is what occurs, for example, inmythologicaldiscourse, which defines as true the sentence \"Pe-gasus is a winged horse,\" without inquiring into reference. Inmore general terms, such is the case for all fictional discourse.Without asking oneself about the actual reality of the objectsarising from the creative imagination of an author, we cannevertheless assign a truth value to assertions about those ob-jects. In this manner, we know full well that it is false to saythat Hamlet is Ophelia's brother.29A possibility that, to our knowledge, has not been seriously consid-ered in Western logic would be to universalize this ontologically neutraluse of a substitutional interpretation. Ruth Barcan Marcus had arguedin her 1978 article, \"Nominalism and the Substitutional Quantifier,\"that the substitutional interpretation would offer a nominalistic way outof commitment to higher-order objects like kinds, universals, proposi-tions, etc. It would only be concerning the lowest order of the things,i.e., nominalistically acceptable particular objects, that the interpretationwould remain referential. She concluded: \"it is not at all clear that sucha program is wholly feasible, but it is surely a nominalistic program.\"30Now, it is conceivable that a philosopher might, for some meta-physical reasons, go even further beyond this rigorous nominalism andsimply reject ^//reference to real entities, and that he therefore wouldaccept only a logic interpreted in the ontologically neutral substitutional"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 199fashion. This is, arguably, the case for the Madhyamaka when he acceptsthe superficial truths of the world. In effect, the Buddhist's two truths,i.e., the conventional and the absolute, can be understood as two dif-ferent ways of interpreting language: without reference to real entitiesand with such reference, respectively. For the superficial truth, or theconventions generally recognized by the world, it is the substitutionalinterpretation which applies. Thus, under such an interpretation, itcould be said that there are tables, chairs, buddhas and atoms (but norabbits' horns!)—the Madhyamaka too would accept those conventionalstatements because for him they only involve language without any cor-responding entities. In contrast,when the question as to whether thereare or not such actual entities is being posed, the debate has shifted tothe absolute level of truth, and the interpretation must be referential. Fora metaphysician who does not accept any real entities, then the con-ventional affirmations accepted earlier will no longer be maintained:there are no tables, chairs nor buddhas when \"there are\" means thatthere actually are such kinds of real objects in a set of entities to whichwe refer. It is in this manner that it would be possible to affirm, on theone hand, that conventionally there are forms (rupa), sounds (s'abda),odors (gandha), and so on, while on the other hand saying that therereally are none. Interestingly, the Madhyamaka also appears to acceptsome of the most important elements of a substitutional interpretation.In fact, there is a cliche—one found in other schools as well, includingthe Chinese traditions—that maintains that nothing exists substantially(dravyasat), but rather that things exist merely as designations (prajnapti-mdtrasat) or in a purely nominal fashion (ndmamdtra). This applies toall superficial reality, even to buddhas and nirvana: these are but desig-nations without any corresponding, real entity.31We are now in a position to give a translation of the tetralemma intoformal logic: the four alternatives will be statements preceded by exis-tential quantification. Here we will just give the first two, namely:\"There is an xsuch that xhas property Z7\" and \"There is an xsuch thatx does not have i7.\" In symbols, these would be rendered: (Ex)Fx and(Ex)-Fx. Since we are dealing with a tendency to attribute properties toentities, the semantics here must be referential; in other words, the op-ponent maintains that there really is some thing that has, or does nothave, property F. It is precisely this attribution of properties to entitiesthat the Buddhist wishes to oppose. As a result, the four negations thatthe Buddhist maintains are:"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"2OO  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEFor any predicate F:[V] ~(Ex)Fx[31 ~(Ex)(Fx&-Fx)[4'] ~(Ex)(-Fx&^Fx)If we interpret the quantification in a referential manner—as we mustdo in this context—all four alternatives can be denied without the leastlogical deviance. The statements (Fx)Fx and (Ex) -Ex are false for theMadhyamaka philosopher who does not accept the existence of enti-ties; the statements are false because, for him, the domain cannot con-tain any objects. In fact, we are dealing here with a banal principal ofmodern logic: any statement having the form (Ea) 0 is false in an emptydomain.32 [1]—[41] would thus reflect the Buddhist's rejection of all on-tology: no attribution of properties to objects can be accepted.In conclusion, the response to our initial question—to know whetherBuddhist logic was deviant or not—comes almost as a corollary to thepreceding discussion. When we translate the Madhyamaka's statementsinto a logic with two types of interpretations, we will not encounter anyviolation of the laws of contradiction, excluded middle or double nega-tion, or of any other fundamental theorems of classical logic. There thuswill not be any significant deviation.33 In sum, looked at in this way,Buddhist logic appears to be at most a non-classical logic, in the sensethat its operators and its vocabulary are somewhat peculiar, but it is nota rival of classical logic.NOTES TO CHAPTER 9The original publication contains the following note: \"This article is a reworkedversion of a lecture I delivered in February 1990 at the Seminaire de Philoso-phic of the University of Neuchatel.

In this context, some scholars have cited MMK VII, k.30:satas ca tdvad bhdvasya nirodho nopapadyate I ekatve na hi bhdvas candbhdvas copapadyate // \"First of all, a real entity (bhdva) cannothave any cessation because if [entities and non-entities (abhdva)] areidentical, then neither an entity (bhdva) nor a non-entity (abhdva)is possible\" (see PrP 170.7: tasmdd ekatve sati bhdvdbhdvayoh).R. Robinson (1976: 50), for example, thought that this stanza doesdemonstrate Nagarjuna's acceptance of the law of contradiction. But it seemsto us that this opinion is probably based upon a dubious translation of thesecond half of the stanza: \"Existent and inexistent in a unity is not true tofact.\" This stanza does not say that bhdva and abhdva are not found in thesame thing. Rather, it says that, if bhdvas could cease, then bhdvas andabhavas would become identical, and that in that case, neither would be pos-sible. In fact, it is Candraklrti's commentary on MMK VII, k. 30 (PrP:170.7-9) that gives us a version of the law of contradiction by way of theterm parasparavirudddha (\"mutually contradictory\"):atha vd parasparaviruddhatvdd dlokdndhakdravad ekatve sati na hibhdvas ca ndbhdvas copapadyate // \"Or again if they are identical,then neither a bhdva nor an abhdva are possible, since they are mu-tually contradictory, as is the case with light and darkness.\""},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"NON-CLASSICAL OR DEVIANT LOGIC? 203That much said, it is nonetheless true that Nagarjuna himself uses theterm paraspamviruddha in MMK VIII, k. 7:kdrakah sadasadbhutah sadasat kurute na tat / parasparaviruddhamhi sac cdsac caikatah kutah //\"An agent that is real and unreal doesnot accomplish this [action] that is real and unreal because how canthe real and unreal, which are mutually contradictory (paraspara-viruddha), be unified?\"20 Cf. the formulation in the Metaphysics, T3, 1005b 19-23.21 MVI.3cd.22Ruegg(1977:26).23 VP III. 123.24 See Bronkhorst (1992: 64).

Seyfort Ruegg (1986: 233) also emphasizes the importance of bhdva forthe Madhyamaka in the rejection of all philosophical theses (pratijna, paksa):In sum, the Madhyamika's approach to the question ofthepratijnaand paksa stems from his rejection of epistemic commitment to anyproposition—positive or negative—that presupposes the existenceof a bhdva or dharma possessing a svabhdva and posits such an en-tity in terms of the binary structure of vikalpa and the quaternarystructure of the catuskotiSee also G. Bugault (1983 and 1989). Bugault highlights the importanceof the rejection of bhdva and svabhdva (\"own nature\") in Nagarjuna's argu-ments, but he maintains that the principle of contradiction must be tied to abelief in entities:Or, comme Aristote lui-meme en est parfaitement conscient, leprincipe logique de contradiction suppose, au moins implicitement,une metaphysique de la quiddite: il faut croire aux choses.It follows that the Buddhist himself, who does not believe in real entities,cannot be constrained by this law in his own thought. In fact, this type ofAristotelian point of view—which demands that logic be tied to an ontol-ogy—currently seems far less defensible.

Finally, note also that in a recent article, C. Oetke (1991)also offers us a modal interpretation of the tetraiemma. He remarks (318):It is of greatest importance to become clear about the logical struc-ture of this proposition [viz. the central tenet that on the highestlevel of truth there is nothing of any kind]. It contains as ingredi-ents something like a sentential operator \"on the level of highesttruth (it is the case that)\" and a negated existential proposition,which could be represented by an expression of the form \"-(Exr) ...x...\" (...). The feature of the central tenet that it has a negative gen-eral existential proposition as its component necessitates the rejec-tion of all statements in which something is attributed to some-thing (at the highest level of truth).28 See Marcus (1962 and 1972); Belnap and Dunn (1968); and Vernant(1986).29 Vernant (1986: 291):...la verite des phrases atomiques [du langage] Lo est definie, abinitio, de facon purement conventionnelle, abstraction faite de toutereference effective.

Equally, there is,in Dharmakirti, a very important causal account which complements thearthakriyd criterion: particulars cause perceptions, which leave imprintson one's mind, and these imprints in turn condition subsequent thought.Thus there can be a necessary connection (sambandha; pratibandha) ofcausality between particulars and thought, albeit indirect, which ex-plains why adhyavasdya can work so well as to \"make us reach\" or \"makeus obtain\" (prdpaka) the real world, and also why we can continue tosay justifiably that in certain cases a conceptually created fiction, i.e., auniversal, is a property of real things and in other cases that it is not.2Certain Tibetan schools, however, developed other aspects of the processof unconscious error, supplementary and even alternative accounts,which tried to explain the fine points and sometimes the step-by-stepdetails of the internal mechanisms of the thought process. And indeed,whatever be the merits of their answers, the interest of the questions\"Just how do thought and determination actually work to reach reality?\"and \"What are the necessary ontological conditions for them to be ableto work in this way?\" was by no means exhausted by the Dharmakirt-ian account.dGa' ldan pa and later dGe lugs pa writers developed a very complexanswer to these two questions, devoting a strikingly minimal amount ofenergy or ingenuity to elaborating upon the Dharmaklrtian causal ac-count, the account of prdpakatva or even that of arthakriyd. Rather, theypursued an approach which was depicted by Tsong kha pa and rGyaltshab rje as depending, above all, upon properly seeing through a so-called obstacle (gegs) or difficult point (dka'gnaslgnad) which peoplehave when tackling issues connected with apoha? In what follows, weshall look at this dGa' idan-dGe lugs approach, trying to see why it cameabout, and contrasting it with certain Indian and Indian-like positions,such as those of Sa skya pandita and certain Rigs gter bas, who, as wasso frequently the case in Tibetan epistemology, had complex debateson this matter with Tsong kha pa, his predecessors and his successors.(In what follows, I will, for the sake of simplicity, drop the differencebetween \"dGa' ldan pa\" and \"dGe lugs pa,\" and speak only of \"dGelugs pa,\" with the caveat that this is something of a distortion which at-taches Tsong kha pa and his two main disciples to a rigidified versionof their thought developed by later interpreters.1)To begin with, Tsong kha pa et al felt that in order for thought and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"212  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEinference to be able to bear upon or \"contact\" (regpa) the real world, itwas necessary that at least some universals, some sddhya, some dharrnin,some reasons, some examples, some identities, some differences, etc.,etc. should actually be fully real entities (dngospo) and particulars (rangmtshan). Georges Dreyfus, in important studies on the dGe lugs theoryof universals, has termed their theory a type of \"moderate realism\"—viz.,the position that real universals exist, but only \"in\" the particular enti-ties (don la gnaspa), or in other words, that universals are substantially/essentially identical (rdzasgciglbdag nyidgcig) with the particulars theyqualify.5 Now, this realism does, of course, seem to fly in the face ofwell-known principles of the apoha theory found in Dignaga, Dhar-makirti, and most later logicians, about universals being unreal, and notsurprisingly, it was vociferously rejected by anti-realist exponents of theSa skya pa Rigs gter ba tradition.6 Go rams pa bsod nams seng ge andgSer mdog pan chen sakya mchog ldan, for example, dismiss it as a Ti-betan invention, in other words, as being completely without basis inIndian texts. Indeed, Sa skya pandita himself was very aware of variousBuddhist realist positions—he attributes them, contemptuously, to \"Ti-betans\" (bod mams), the term by which he generally refers to the rNgogand Phya pa traditions developed in gSang phu sne'u thog monastery.We can be confident that much of the dGe lugs pa's tradition of real-ism was nothing fundamentally original on their part, but was inspiredlargely by the gSang phu positions, especially based upon the Tshadma'ibsduspa of the early twelfth-century thinker, Phya pa chos kyi seng ge.7All that said, Go rams pa and other Sa skya pas may well have beena bit too harsh in accusing \"Tibetans\" and their \"later followers\" of com-pletely inventing things, for there probably was also a weakening in laterIndian Buddhist logic of the stricture that all universals must be unreal.As I showed briefly in an article some years ago, Sankaranandana seemsto be one plausible candidate for being an Indian Buddhist realist, andindeed the dGe lugs pa frequently cite a passage from his commentaryon Prarndnavdrttika (PV) I, k. 40 (= PVin II, k. 29) as their prime Indiansource on the question.8 Dreyfus (1992) has looked at other potentialIndian sources in much more detail, examining inter alia some aspectsof Dharmottara's writings.

Suffice it to say here that the dGe lugs pa probably didhave some Indian antecedents for a generalView of realism. Nonetheless,the details of their own position and their actual arguments or che routewhich they took to \"resolve\" prima facie contradictions with Dignagaand Dharmakirti and arrive at their own version of moderate realism,turn on a curious ensemble of ideas which has no parallel that I know ofin Indian thought. This is what is involved in the so-called difficult point.The basic source for the dGe lugs pa position on the \"obstacle\"/\"diffi-cult point\" and many other aspects of apoha seems to have been Tsongkha pa's Tshad ma'i brjed byang chen mo, a work which is described asbeing rGyal tshab's recording of Tsong kha pa's lectures on pramdna(rGyal tshab chos ryes rje'i dntng du gsanpa). The key passages from thiswork are taken almost verbatim by such authors as dGe 'dun grub paand ICang skya rol pa'i rdo rje, while rGyal tshab rje and mKhas grubrje's philosophical debts to the position laid out in the Tshad ma'i brjedbyang are also clear, even if the textual passages are not borrowed wordby word. On the other hand, a proviso is in order to avoid giving themistaken impression that all dGe lugs pas routinely use the term \"diffi-cult point\"/\"obstacle\" in this connection. It is just Tsong kha pa whospeaks of the \"obstacle,\" and it is rGyal tshab rje in rNam grelthar lamgsal byed who speaks somewhat bombastically of \"the supreme mainpoint of our difficulties of understanding in this tradition\" (gzhung lugs'di / rtogs dka'ba 'ignas [orgnad] kyigtso bo dam pa).

The consequences of not understanding thiscompatibility are, according to rGyal tshab rje (who faithfully echoesTsong kha pa), serious indeed. We will create a false dilemma: either,in order to preserve thought's ability to \"contact\" (regpa) particulars,we will give up the ^0/^-principle that thought apprehends fictions, ap-plies by exclusion (sel jug) and does not apply positively (sgrub jug), orwe will end up saying that thought cannot \"contact\" (regpa) particularsat all and applies just by its own inflated misconceptions (rlompa tsam= [abhi]rndnamdtra).H The rest of the account in Tsong kha pa, rGyaltshab, dGe 'dun grub, ICang skya et al speaks about particulars ap-pearing as mixed up ('dres nas) with the mind-created appearances/rep-resentations (snang ba). And the result of all this is that the dGe lugs pawill diagnose the unconscious error inherent in thought as being that aconceptually created fictional representation and the particulars appear(snang ba) to thought as being one (gcig tu) and indistinguishable (so sodbyer medpa), although they are, in themselves, very different, the for-mer being unreal, the latter real (see n. 28 below)."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 21/In brief: following Tsong kha pa and rGyal tshab, there are two closelyrelated key elements which we supposedly have to understand to cor-rectly grasp the difficult point and hence avoid falling into a seductivedilemma:I. The separation between unreal A itself and the various real As: Some-thing like universal or sadhya itself is unreal, but not all universals, etc.,are. In other words, universal, sadhya, etc. are not in opposition (galba = viruddha) with real entities, i.e., particulars, but have a com-mon basis (gzhi mthim = samdnddhikarana) with particulars (see n.6). Strange as it will probably seem to one used to Indian texts, in thisTibetan ontology, the various universals (e.g., sound, tree, etc.),sddhyas (e.g., impermanent things), sddhanas (e.g., products), and soforth are also particulars! The result is that the dGe lugs pa are obligedto make an extremely difficult to defend split between sdmdnya ispyi\"universal\") and sdmdnyalaksana (spyi mtshan), the latter being onlyfictional and completely in opposition with particulars, so that thereare no sdmdnyalaksana which are also real and particular. Whether wethink all this is elegant or not, or philologicaliy sound or not, is an-other matter, let us just stress for now that what we have described isan essential feature of the dGe lugs pa system.15II. What we shall term the \"appearance principle\": real particulars mustactually appear to thought, be apprehended ('dzinpa) by it, and evenbe its explicit object (dngos yul), all be the appearance of particulars\"mixed up\" ('drespa) with that of fictions.First of all, turning to point I, it seems quite clear that Tsong kha pathought that the separation between unreal A and real As in the case ofsdmdnya, sadhya, etc. was to be explainedhy the general statement that\"the object of thought is not a particular but particulars are the objectsof thought.\" A very similar formulation is to be found in ICang skya,who first cites the cases of sdmdnya, sadhya and the like, and then giveswhat he takes to be the reason (rgyu mtshan) why these terms admit aseparation between unreal A itself and real As:"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"2l8 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEICang sky a grub mtha'p. 100 ed.

Whatit and other similar formulations do is much more like restating theproblematic A-As separation in a different, more general form, but ourpuzzlement will probably remain. Thus, universal itself (spyi kho rang)is unreal but universals may not be; appearance to thought (rtogpa lasnang ha) itself is unreal, but the various appearances (or alternativelythose things which appear) may not be (= rtogpa la snang bayin nay deyin pas ma khyah),16 object of thought (rtog pa'i yul) itself is unreal, butobjects of thought may not be (rtog pa'i yul yin na, de yin pas ma khyab),etc. etc. Whether we're dealing with universals, appearances or objectsof thought, the logic is the same and turns on being able to speak of un-real A itself (kho rang) or mere A (tsam)y or the \"own exclusion\" of A(rang Uog) in contrast to the various real and particular As.Now, this differentiation between an A itself and the various As is ex-tremely foreign to us and seems absent in Indian Buddhist logic. More-over, for many Tibetans, too, it must have seemed a mysterious, par-alogicai or even completely sophistical move, as we see by Go rams pa'scharacterization of it as just \"verbal obscurantism\" (tshiggi sgrib g.yogs)(see n, 6). A tempting way to dismiss the strangeness, would be to saythat we are dealing with no more than language-based problems. In keep-ing with Go rams pa, we too might think that all this is no more thanwordplay, of about the same level of interest as the numerous bsdusgrwatricks turning on features of Tibetan-like ambiguities in the use of thegenitive, etc.—in short, a bad joke which, as usual, does not translatevery well.

What we see in the opposing argumentsof the Sa skya pa Rigs gter ba is precisely that this type of separation be-tween unreal A and real As is avoided by means of a very different ex-egesis of Indian texts, one which allows them to say that all universals,reasons, examples etc. are indeed unreal (there is no distinction here be-tween A and As), but that we can nonetheless use them to contact realentities. The essential points of their explanation turn on Sa skyapandita's distinction, in Rigs gter 5, between theoretical explanation('chadpa) and practical application (jugpa)—when we critically explainwhat it isy then a term in a reasoning or an object of thought is indeedonly a mentally created universal, but from the practical point of view,we do, due to unconscious error, \"speak about\" svalaksana.19 There isthus, according to the Sa skya pa Rigs gter ba, no need to subscribe tothe fundamental dGe lugs pa idea of universals like byas pa tsam, shingtsam (\"mere product,\" \"mere tree\") and so forth really existing in thefull-fledged sense, but being \"in\" or \"substantially identical with\" par-ticulars—this odd position is considered to be a just gross hypostatiza-tion, like saying that besides our two hands or two eyes, we also have areally existent \"hand\" (lagpa) or \"eye\" (mig).20There is also, of course, a historical dimension to this A-As separa-tion. Indeed, as we mentioned earlier, we can be confident that the dGelugs pa did not invent the major features of their logic on their own; theywere no doubt following some broad lines already developed by earliergSang phu scholars. The A-As separation, and in fact much of the\"dilemma\" in the so-called difficult point, was already described by Saskya pandita in his critique of certain views on the conceptually createdexclusions (Idogpa - vyavrtti) which Buddhist logic took to be thepseudo-universals directly expressed by words.

There are anumber of variations in the presentations of these views being attacked,but they have the same essential structure of A versus As\\ the vyavrttiitself is conceptually created, but the x which is the vyavrtti may not be.Glo bo'i mkhan chen speaks of one variant as being that of the later fol-lowers of the bsduspa (of Phya pa), and not surprisingly, it does indeedcorrespond precisely to what we find in dGe lugs pa bsdus grwa texts.21"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 221Second, how did the dGe lugs pa (and probably some earlier followersof the gSang phu traditions) come to hold that real particulars actuallyappear to thought?22 This \"appearance principle\" was trenchantly criti-cized by the Sa skya pa opponents, and especially so by Sakya mchogldan, who did not accept that real particulars appeared to thought, wereapprehended by thought, or were explicit objects of thought at all. Forhim, adhyavasdya leads to knowledge of particulars by unconscious er-ror; we call (tha snyad byaspa) the pseudo-sounds, etc. which appear tothought \"substances,\" but when we critically explain ('chadpa V tshe) theprocess, it is only unreal sdmdnyalaksana which actually appear or whichare apprehended.23 In this he was in keeping with the mainstream posi-tion of Buddhist logic, as found in Dignaga's Pramdnasamuccayavrtti(PSV) ad 1.2:svalaksanavisayam hi pratyaksam sdmdnyalaksanavisayamaniirndnam itipratipddayisydmah /\"We will show that per-ception has [only] svalaksana as its object and inference lias[only] sdmdnyalaksana as object.\"Note that word \"only,\" which is very important here, is not just ourdoing: it figures in Jinendrabuddhi's commentary as well as in the ver-sions of this passage found in the non-Buddhist writers, Mallavadin andSimhasuri. It does no doubt reflect the usual Indian understanding ofthe passage.24Sakya mchog ldan was also in keeping with statements from Dharma-kirti (see PVin II.2, 8—10 above), Dharmottara (see above), and withthose of later writers like Jnanas'rimitra and Ratnakirti.2* Indeed, I thinkit's safe to say that the Sa skya pas have an overwhelmingly strong case,for it is almost impossible to defend an interpretation of Dignaga andDharmakirti which allows particulars actually to appear to thought, andwhat is perhaps worse, to be the explicit objects (dngos yul) of thought.Interestingly enough, the idea of thought applying by rlom pa tsam orabhimdnamdtra, an idea which the dGe lugs pa are criticizing as a dis-astrous consequence of misunderstanding the \"difficult point,\" may wellhave Indian antecedents, as it seems to be alluded to by Durvekamisrain his sub-commentary on the phrase svalaksanam avasitam in the pas-sage from the Nydyabindutikd which we cited above; Sakya mchog ldan's"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"222 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEdevelopment of the distinction between rlom tshod as opposed to songtshod may also be related to this idea.26 But, on the other side of the de-bate, the dGe lugs pa's idea of real particulars actually appearing tothought does not seem to be present in other Indian writers, althoughof course one cannot rule out that there may yet be some or anothersource to be discovered. At any rate, there were later thinkers, likeMoksakaragupta who, following Jnanas'rimitra and Ratnakirti, had al-lowed that universals could appear to perception, but none that I knowof that allowed that particulars could appear to thought or actually beapprehended by thought.27Although the dGe lugs pa do, of course, have interpretations of Dig-naga's and Dharmakirti's key statements about only sdmdnyalaksana be-ing the objects of thought, in the end it is quite apparent that this textualexegesis is Intertwined with the other key element of the so-called diffi-cult point, viz., the separation between unreal A and real As. In brief:thought's appearing object (rtogpa'isnangyul), its apprehended object(rtogpa'igzungyul) and the appearance or representation itself (rtogpa /snang ha) are said to be indeed sdmdnyalaksanas, but not everythingwhich appears or is apprehended by thought is: rtogpa'i snang yul [orsnang baj spyi tntshan yin; rtog pa la snang na spyi mtshan yin pas makhyab. And we are more or less back to where we started, once againfaced with the peculiar talk about an unreal A in itself, as opposed to realAs, being used to save consistency with Indian texts.28Part of the dGe lugs pa's motivation for insisting that real particularsmust actually appear to thought was an aprioristic reasoning about whatis needed to preserve a distinction between (partially!) right or validthoughts, like inferences, and utterly wrong thoughts (log shes), likethinking that sound is permanent. As we saw in the initial passagesquoted from Tsong kha pa, the idea that all thought just worked by\"inflated misconceptions\" (rlom pa tsam = abhimdnamdtra) was takento be a catastrophe: this was so for him because if all thought were mereinflated misconceptions (rlom pa tsam), no distinction between rightand wrong would be possible, and every thought would be simply wrong.Thus a hierarchy of error was deemed necessary, and the dGe lugs pafelt that there had to be some point which distinguished the two sortsof error, viz., valid (tshadma) thought, which is only erroneous in a veryspecific way about what appears, and utterly wrong thought (log shes),where nothing real appears at all and error occurs on the level of deter-mination."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 223Not surprisingly, perhaps, this idea of a twofold hierarchy of error hasonly a very strained grounding in Dharmaklrti, who repeatedly stressesthe complete similarity of the psychological processes of valid and ut-terly wrong thoughts and just relies upon the criterion arthakriyd andupon indirect causal connections (sambandha) with particulars to makethe necessary distinctions. (See e.g., PV I, k. 81.). Sakya mchog ldan doesnot bother with the hierarchy of error at all, and actually speaks of validthought about samdnddhikarana, visesa, etc. as being nothing other thanwrong cognitions (logshes kho na), \"because they apprehend them by su-perimposition\" (sgro btags nas 'dzinpa'iphyir) (see n. 19 below).The dGe lugs pa arguments are, I think, so strikingly weak on thisscore,29 that one is tempted to look for other explanations. Do all these\"solutions\" of dilemmas come down to a case of the fascination whichphilosophers have notoriously had with rhetorical parallelisms and in-versions, thinking that they somehow embody profundity?30 Alas, thisis probably part of what's going on when Tsong kha pa and rGyal tshabput forth a long series of inversions along the lines of \"objects of thoughtare not particulars, but particulars are objects of thought.\" However,some remarks of Klein, which I have also frequently heard from Ti-betans, lead me to think that we are not dealing so much with argumentscouched in potent rhetorical figures, as with, above all, a certain fixedidea or dominant metaphor of how sdmdnyalaksana operates inthought.31 The dGe lugs model, as Klein very correctly states, is some-thing like mirroring (a variant on the mirror metaphor which I have of-ten heard is glass or crystal)—a vase actually appears to thought via asdmdnyalaksana, just like an object might actually appear via a mirroror crystal. Moreover, since thought must understand its object via this\"medium,\" then if the vase did not appear in this mirror or crystal-likesdmdnyalaksana, we would not know anything about it all—our ideaswould be just inventions and misconceptions. Representations, appear-ances, etc. thus end up being taken as faithful duplications, rather thanas constructed proxies which convey only an extremely limited and par-tial picture of the object and even involve various distortions. Un-doubtedly, however, it is the latter idea of constructions, rather thanthat of sdmdnyalaksana-as-mirvors or sdmdnyalaksana-as-crysta\\, whichbetter captures the sense of invention/creation and imagination in theterm kalpandand which squares with the fundamental idea of Dignaga'sapoha theory that thought functions by exclusion (sel 'jug) to focus ona very limited number of the object's otherwise many qualities."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"224  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGESdmdnyalaksana-as-mirrots, if we stick to this metaphor, looks morelike a transformation of thought into a type of positive application (sgrub'jug), like perception, where everything about the object must appear inan undifferentiated unity. In short, appearance of an object in a mirrorwould be a meaningful metaphor only if conceptual representationswere also more or less directly caused by their objects and were not par-tial in the way all Buddhist logicians say they actually are.32Finally, it remains to ask how important for dGe lugs pa philosophy wastheir \"solution\" to the dilemma-like difficult point? How much of a roledid it actually play in their apoha-related doctrines? In other words, wasit really the key point for them that they said it was? I think the answerto the latter question must be a strong \"Yes.\" For better or for worse,they were right when they spoke about it being, for them, the supremedifficult point of the logicians' tradition, or the principal obstacle to un-derstanding the logician's version of the two truths—for them it wasvery important, as is clear from even a quick perusal of the list of keyconcepts which Tsong kha pa mentioned in the passage from Tshadma'i brjed byangwhich we cited earlier on. Indeed, this \"difficult point\"was not just important in usual apoha-relatcd problems, such as ques-tions of universals and semantics, but elements of this doctrine crop upin numerous other areas of dGe lugs pa philosophy. A few examplesshould suffice to show what I mean.The quirky character of bsdus grwa logicThe differentiation between A and As is extremely widespread in thissystem of logic, and does not just involve logical terms like sddhya,sddhana, etc. One very frequently finds statements along the lines ofshes bya chos can rtagpayin (\"knowable thing, the topic, is permanent,[i.e., unreal]\") and shes bya y in na rtagpayin pas ma khyab, dper na gserbum bzhin (\"if something is a knowable thing, it need not be permanent[i.e., unreal], like a golden vase\").33 This and very many other statementslike it turning on the A/As separation are at the core of many of theseemingly paradoxical examples which M. Goldberg (1985) gave in a listof \"puzzles\" found in bsdus grwa. What Goldberg also correctly noticedwas that A itself is sometimes an A and sometimes not, and that it is very"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 225difficult to give anything other than ad hoc 01 merely intra-systemic ex-planations as to when one outcome is to be endorsed rather than theother.34 The word \"quirky,\" as I am using it here, doesn't me;in 'formallydeviant\" in the technical sense intended by W.V. Quinc or Susan Haack,namely, a logic which would reject key classical theorems. Formallyspeaking, bsdus grwa is a coherent, functional and even quite a sophis-ticated system of logic, having analogues to variables, rather unusualquantifiers and a number of classically behaving formal structures ofimplication, contradiction and so forth.35 But, in its semantic aspects, itis quirky or unpredictable, in that we simply have a hard time sayingconvincingly when and why a number of statements should be true andothers false. And this quirkiness is very often due to the recurring prob-lematical distinctions between A and A's.36Parallels between the difficult pointin apoha and the two truths in MadhyamakaIn rNam 'grelthar lam gsalbyed, vol. 1, p. 110, we find the followingpassage:bsgrub by a sgrub byed sogs tha dadpa'i cha dang de daggi rangIdog rtogpas btags (brtags?) par ston pa yin gyi I de dag yin nartogpas brtags pas khyab par ston pa ni mam pa kun tu mi rungste I lugs gzhan du bden stong don dam pa 7 bden pa yin yangbden stong yin na des ma khyab par bshadpa bzhin no //\"Oneteaches that the fact of there being a difference (tha dad paicha) between sddhya and sddhana, as well as the 'own exclu-sions' (rang Idog = *svavydvrtti) of these [terms, sddhya aiiclsddhana], are things imagined by thought. However, it is to-tally wrong to teach that if something is one of these [i.e., ifit is the sddhya or sddhana, etc.] it must be imagined bythought (rtogpas brtags pa). It is like in another tradition [I.e.,the Madhyamaka] where it is said that 'void of truth' (bdenstong) is the ultimate truth (don dam bden pa), but that irsomething is void of truth, it need not be the latter [i.e., itneed not be ultimate truth].\"I think that the structure which we have discussed under the problemof the difficult point, namely A itself being unreal, but A's being real, is"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"226  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEso obvious here with regard to sddhya, etc. as to need few further re-marks.37 What is however noteworthy is that, following the dGe lugs pa,the Madhyamaka gets drawn into using a similar type of logical struc-ture where one makes a general separation between A and As. In short,elements of the so-called difficult point in apoha also become key ele-ments in the dGe lugs pa understanding of Madhyamaka.Continua and gross objectsThe fundamental separation between unreal A and real As is also largelypresent in the dGe lugs formulations of an ontology of real continua(rgyun = samtana) and gross (ragspa - sthula) objects extended in space.The dGe lugs pa came up with a peculiar interpretation of these two no-tions so that samtana and sthula themselves are unreal, but if somethingis either or these it need not be unreal. Dreyfus (1991: 173ff.) has ex-plained these positions in mKhas grub rje. What is relevant for us hereis that the passage of mKhas grub rje which Dreyfus cites makes a veryclear connection between the A versus As structure as applied to uni-versals and the same structure applied to continua and gross objects. Inshort, the argument is a pure case of the so-called difficult point.slJe bdunyidkyi mun sel f. 34a 1—2: spyi dang rags pa dang rgyunzhes by a ba ni sgro btags rdzas su ma grub pa V spyi mtshan yinkyang spyi dang rags pa dang rgyun yin na rdzas su grub pa dangrang mtshan la sogs pa yin par mi 'gal zhing I spyi mtshan yinpas ma khyab bo Ide'i phyir bum pa Ita bu spyi yang yin rags payangyin rgyun yang yin rang mtshan yang yin la spyi mtshan mayin no zhes shespar gyis shig/\"When one speaks of universal,gross object and continuum, they are imagined sdmdnyalak-sana which are not established as substances. However, it isnot contradictory for something which is a universal, a grossobject or a continuum to be established as a substance and tobe a particular; it does not have to be a sdmdnyalaksana. There-fore, know that something like a vase is a universal and a grossobject as well as a continuum and a particular, but is not asdmdnyalaksana.\""},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT XT]It is high time to draw some conclusions. The above discussion shows,if there is really still need to show such a thing, the necessity for a crit-ical historico-philological approach to dGe lugs pa philosophy, an ap-proach which takes seriously both the Indian and purely Tibetan as-pects of this complex system. Equally, I think that Paul Williams (1994)is quite right in saying that this type of material cries out for sensitiveand in-depth philosophical treatment. And that must also mean logicalanalysis. Notwithstanding the admirable work of Klein and others, thewhys and wherefores of the logic of the dGe lugs pa system still remainvery obscure—we cannot in future just translate or paraphrase dGe lugspa texts and oral traditions on apoha and yet hope to navigate satisfac-torily through the very complex, and often seemingly paralogical, Ti-betan arguments. There is, in being \"faithful\" in this way, the real dangerof an illusory understanding, one where we have essentially just learnedto think adroitly in the same language as rGyal tshab etaly viz., Tibetanapoha-ese. Lastly, as the dGe lugs pa's own major contribution to apoha-theory, the so-called difficult point, turns inextricably on two rathermarginal positions probably having little to do with Indian thought, weshould definitively lay to rest the seductive idea of the dGe lugs-gSangphu tradition being a kind of extremely subtle \"magic key\" ('phrulgyiIde 'u mig) for understanding this vital aspect of Dharmaklrtian episte-mology.38NOTES TO CHAPTER IO1 Cf.

Theprocess was explained by Dharmakirti in various places. See e.g., PV III(pratyaksa), k. 52-53.

The latter work, to which I am heavily indebted,goes into considerable detail on the debates between the Sa skya pa and dGelugs pa thinkers on some of these major issues of episteniology.6 Thus, Go rams pa, in his Rigsgter dka'gnas 55al-5, criticizes some \"Tibe-tans\" (bod dag) who reject real universals (spyi dngospo ba), but accept thatthere can be a common basis (gzhi mthun = samdnddhikarana), between\"universal\" (spyi) and \"real entity\" (dngospo). This position, which is exactlylike the dGe lugs pa account of universals in their bsdusgrtca texts, comesdown to saying that \"universal itself is unreal, but that there are universalswhich are real entities.

Let's take some examples. When one has ruledout 'appearance to thought as excluded from non-vase, [where thisappearance is] established by its own characteristics' (rtogpa la bumpa ma yin pa las logpar snang ba ranggi mtshan nyid kyis grub pa),one would also rule out and then be unable to account for 'ap-pearance to thought as excluded from non-vase [where the vase is]established by its own characteristics' (ranggi mtshan nyid kyis grubpa'i bum pa ma yin pa las log par snang ba). When one has estab-lished that there is a svalaksana which appears as excluded fromnon-vase (bum pa ma yin pa las logpar snang ba'i rang mtshan yodpar bsgrubpa na), one would then also not rule out 'appearance tothought as excluded from non-vase, [where this appearance is] es-tablished by its own characteristics,' and one would [feel he] wasobliged to accept that it [i.e., this appearance] was established by itsown characteristics (ranggi mtshan nyid kyis grub par), so that onewould be unable to account for it being merely imagined by thought(rtogpas btagspa tsam du),. When one has ruled out ' sdmdnyalaksanawhich is a real entity' (spyi mtshan dngos po yin pa), one wouldthereby rule out real entityness (dngos po nyid) too and be unableto establish it by means of a pramdna, and when one has accepted'real entity' (dngos po) one would [feel he] was obliged to acceptthat the sdmdnyalaksana was also a real entity. The two [sorts of]dharmas which exist ultimately and those which exist merely con-ventionally would become just a collection of contradictions so thatwhen one was established by a pramdna the other would be re-futed—this constitutes the supreme main point which is difficultto understand in this tradition (gzhunglugs 'di'i rtogs dka'ba'ignaskyigtso bo dam pa yin). When one doesn't understand it, then wrongviews will arise, such as thinking that if one accepted that asvalaksana was an object of thought, then [thought] would applypositively (sgrub Jug) und then other pramdnas would be useless, orif one accepted that words, logical reasons, and so forth applied byexclusion (sel jug), they could not contact svalaksana at all and theway they applied would just be by mere inflated misconceptions(rlom pa tsam). In short, if one is unable to account for dharmaswhich are just imagined by thought being similar to the svalaksanawhich are faultless objects of pramdnas, then in general one cannotunderstand well the points of this supreme tradition and, in par-ticular, one will not understand conventional states of affairs which"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"234 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEexist simply by vyavahdra. But if one accepts [that there is] a com-mon basis (gzhi mthun - samdnddhikarana) between that [i.e., theconventional] and what is able to accomplish an aim, one will notunderstand the special way of the ultimate in this tradition.\"15 The \"fictions\" (brtagspa I btagspa) of which we are speaking are sdmdnya-laksana, and are generally termed object-universals (don spyi = arthasamdnya).The term figures prominently in Tibetan texts stemming from the gSangphu tradition: its use by \"Tibetans\" (bod mams - the followers of Phya pa) isdiscussed polemically in Rigs gterl and Rigs gter rang 'grel, where Sa skyaPandita argues extensively against the Phya pa tradition's position that donspyi Is an object of thought; Sa pan considered this don spyi not to be an ob-ject (yul) at all, just like nonexistent things. See Fukuda et al. (1989: lOff.) Sapan was also very aware of Indian uses of the terms sabdasdmdnya andarthasamdnya in the Sammitiya tradition; this Sravaka school (contrary toPhya pa and his followers) took the two sdmdnya to be established as sub-stances (rdzas su grub pa). See Rigs gter rang grel ad 1.1; Fukuda et al (1989:34). The pair sabdasdmdnya (sgra spyi) and arthasamdnya (don spyi) also hasdefinite antecedents in Dignaga's apoha theory; see the very lucid article byPind (1991) in which he examines passages from PS V and from Dignaga'slost text, the Sdnidnyapariksd, to show how Dignaga construed thevdcyavdcaka (\"signified-signifier\") relation as holding between two types ofuniversals, sabdasdmdnya and arthasamdnya, rather than between particularwords and objects (sabdavisesa and arthavisesa). As Pind points out,Dignaga's views are similar on this score with those of Bhartrhari—only theword-type or jdtisignifies—and go back to Katyayana. Dharmaklrti, how-ever, adopted a somewhat different position in which sabdasdmdnya had alesser role. Pind (1991: 277) argues that although the terms do figure everyonce in a while in subsequent Indian texts (e.g., Vinltadeva's Nydyabindutikdon NB 1.5s definition of kalpand, ed. Louis de la Vallee Poussin, p. 41), \"theconcepts of arthasamdnya and sabdasdmdnya no longer play any role in post-Dharmaklrti Buddhist epistemology.\" I think it is important to note that thisis true, but only for the major Indian authors: somehow or another, the Phyapa tradition resurrected these terms—possibly from Digndgean sources or froma minor figure like Vinitadeva—and used them constantly to interpret Dhamia-kirti. It is ironic that this comparatively minor technical term arthasamdnya(don spyi), which seems to have largely fallen out of favor in India after Dig-naga, came to be used virtually everywhere in dGe lugs pa philosophy in thesense of a \"mental image\" or \"conceptual representation.\"16 rtogpa la snang bayin na (or snang no) rang mtshan yin pas ma khyabadmits of two translations which are quite different for us: a. \"If something"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 235is an appearance to thought, it is not pervaded by being particular\"; b. \"Ifsomething appears to thought, ....\" There is often an ambiguity in Tibetanbetween nouns and verbs, and this is the case here with snang ba (\"somethingwhich appears\"; \"appearance\"). The result is that this specific example pre-sents an additional problem of imprecision, one which does not occur in thecase of \"object of thought\" (rtogpa'iyul), \"universal\" (spyi), \"reason\" (gtantshigs), etc. which do not have the possibility of being taken as verbal forms.17 1 don t want to rule out the possibility of someone doing a study on howfundamental Tibetan notions of being, existence, instantiation, predication,etc. are conditioned by features inherent in the Tibetan logical language.Here one would have to take account of the blurring in the count noun ver-sus mass noun distinction. It would indeed be valuable to do a study alongthe philologically rigorous lines of A.C. Graham's Dispnters of the Tao(1989), Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science (1978) and his earlier \"Beingin Western Philosophy Compared with Shih/Feiand Yu/Wu in Chinese Phi-losophy\" {Asia Major!', 1959), or one in the same vein as Chad Hansen'swork on Chinese in Language and Logic in Ancient China, 1983. Moreover,such a study would have to take very seriously the Quinean ideas of ontologi-cal relativity and indeterminacy of translation. That said, however, thespecific feature we are speaking of now, i.e., the A-As separation, is probablytoo theoretical and philosophically inspired to be good material for this sortof approach.18 An overly facile way out would be to say that Tibetan locutions alongthe lines of \"A itself are actually expressing A-ness or \"being an A.\" Thus,on this scenario, there would be little difficulty in saying that A-ness or \"be-ing an An is mind-created, but that the individual As are not. Unfortunately,this move would only work in a very limited number of cases. If we appliedthe same interpretation to bum pa kho ra/zg(\"vase itself) and most othersuch banal cases, we would go against what the dGe lugs pa themselvesaccept: for them, bum pa kho rang is not to be taken as mind-created, nor isit to be taken as the same as vaseness or \"being a vase,\" two notions whichfigure regularly in Tibetan and which would be better expressed by bum panyid and bum pa yin pa respectively.19 Rigsgter&b6 (ed.

Most of the[thinkers] of the land of the snows who pride themselves on beinglogicians say that although vydvrtti of non-entity (abhdva) is non-entity, the vydvrtti of real entity (bhdva) is real entity, because theformer is essentially indistinguishable from real entity.\"Sakya mchog ldan sums up these views {Rigs gter dgongs rgyav smadcha, p.152):bod snga phyi thams cad na re I shing tsam de shing gi Idog pa yinzhingl rdzas sn grub pa yang yin no zhes zer ro I \"All earlier md laterTibetans say that mere tree is the vydvrtti of tree and that [meretree] is established substantially (rdzas su grub pa)'.\"Note too that Glo bo'i mkhan chen distinguishes between two variants ofthe \"Tibetan\" view: 1. that the vydvrtti of bhdva is bhdva, and 2. that onlybhdva (dngospo nyid) is the vydvrtti of bhdva.

Klein (1991: 29-36). What is at stake in the dGe lugs pa theory isnot just the (banal) idea of one thing seeming to be another, but the idea ofboth things actually appearing, but mixed up—this idea looks un-Indian. Apossible factor in the dGe lugs-gSang phu tradition adopting the idea of par-ticulars actually appearing indistinguishably mixed up with fictions may havebeen their very confused understanding of Dharmakirti's definition ofthought. 7 heir version of this definition and an indigenous bsdus pa or bsdusgrwa-style adaptation of it may have led them to think that Dharmaldrtihimself regularly had recourse to the notion of \"mixed or indistinguishableappearances\" or of \"two things which appear mixed up as one and which areindistinguishable from the point of view of appearance\" (de gnyis gcig tu 'dresnas snang zhing snang ngor so so dbyer med pa).

(It is noteworthy that someone like ICang skya discusses the \"difficultpoint\" with its use of the idea of 'dres nas snang and then proceeds directly toa discussion of the definition of thought which uses 'drer rung tu 'dzin pa and'drer rung tu snang ba). The definition of thought given in Dharmaklrti'sPramdnaviniscaya and Nydyabindu 1.5 reads: rtogpa ni brjodpa dang 'drerrung ba snang bai shes pa. The Sanskrit admits of two versions dependingupon whether we read the tatpurusa compound °pratibhdsapratltih or abahuvrihi, °pratibhdsd, qualifying pratitih: abhildpasamsargayogyapratibhdsa-pratitih kalpand or abhildpasainsargayogyapratibhdsd pratitih kalpand. Choos-ing the tatpurusa version, we should have a translation like that of Hattori(1968: 85): \"a cognition of [aj representation which is capable of being asso-ciated with a verbal designation\" (Kajiyama [1966: 41] is identical apartfrom translating abhildpa as \"words\"). If, however, we follow Dharmottara'sNydyabindutikd and read °pratibhdsd, as seems preferable, we would havesomething like \"kalpandh a cognition in which a representation is capableof being associated with a verbal designation.\"First of all, we should note that drer rung ba snang ba'i shes pa correspondsto the tatpurusa samsargayogyapratibhdsapratitih, and that 'dre = samsargadoes not have the sense here of being \"indistinguishably mixed up,\" nor is itat all commented upon in that way by Dharmottara: rather it simply means\"being associated.\" Secondly, the natural tendency in Tibetan is to readsnang ba (- pratibhdsa) as a verb beginning a relative clause, i.e., \"to whichappears ...,\" rather than the correct way, which is as the noun \"representa-tion\"/\"image.\" Thirdly, Tibetan texts often, but not always, read rung bar,"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 239rather than rung ba, and thus further change the sense radically. The result ofall this is that the frequent Tibetan misinterpretation of this definition be-comes something like \"thought is a cognition to which [something] appearsas capable of being mixed up with an expression.\" Apart from a perhapssomewhat doubtful rendering of snang ba'ihy \"perceives,\" Klein (1991: 138)is quite faithful to this misunderstanding when she translates: \"a thoughtconsciousness is a consciousness which perceives [a meaning-of-a-term] assuitable to be mixed with an expression.\"To conclude: My argument is admittedly speculative, but I think it isworthwhile to consider if the Tibetans may have started on a wrong trackdue to some fairly rudimentary philological errors. They may well have comeup with a notion of 'dres nas snang ba, based on a misinterpretation of Pramd-naviniscaya and Nydyabindus term samsargayogyapratibhdsapratiti (- 'drer rungbafrjsnang ba'ishespa) as \"a cognition to which [something] appears as capa-ble of being mixed up with...\" The misconstrual ofsnang ba'i coupled with'drer in Nydyabindu and Pramdyiaviniscaya might well, therefore, have created(already in the earlier gSang phu schools?) a kind of pseudo-precedent for anIndian source which spoke of two things actually appearing to thought, or xactually appearing to thought as indistinguishably mixed up with y.Finally, note that the dGe lugs-gSang phu tradition came up with theirown definition of thought, sgra don 'dres rung tu 'dzin pa'i bio \"a cognitionwhich apprehends a sabdasdmdnya and an arthasdmdnya as fitting to bemixed up,\" as a reworking of Dharmaklrti's definition in PVin. See n. 15on the bona fide Indian terms sabdasdmdnya and arthasdmdnya. While rGyaltshab and dGe dun grub pa took sgra don as sgra spyi and don spyi, mKhasgrub rje protested that this was impossible, and he, as well as ICang skya,came up with a different definition (sgra don 'dzinpa'i bio) in order to beable to take sgra don as the equivalent of Dharmaklrti's use of sabddrtha(\"object of a word\") in PV III, k. 287. See Tshadma rigs rgyan, p. 36ff.(definition of rtogpa); sDe bdunyid kyi mun set 56b—57b (= pp. 114—16);ICang skya grub mtha, p. lOOff; Klein (1991: 129-40). mKhas grub, forexample, argued, inter alia, that rGyal tshab's version of sgra don 'dres rungtu 'dzinpa'i bio was absurd because \"it is contradictory to accept that themeaning of'mixed up' would be that name and object would appear asidentical; if we did, then one would have to accept that the meaning of'being fitting to be mixed up' was also that the name and object were fittingto appear as identical\" (57a: 'dres pa 'i don ming don gcig ha bur snang ba la'dodpa ang gal ba yin te I de Ita na I 'drer rung ba V don kyang ming don gcigIta bur snang du rung ba la 'dod dgos I). This turns on the misunderstandingof samsargayogya I 'drer rung ba as \"fit to be indistinguishably mixed up,\" themisreading rung tu and the reading of snang ba as a verb rather than as thenoun pratibhdsa, \"representation.\" In conclusion, I think that we can safely"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"240  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEsay that this discussion (and especially the \"refutations\" in mKhas grub andICang skya) was a confused debate, where a misreading of PVin's definitionand its equally doubtful transformation into an indigenous Tibetan version,led to a long, but woolly and useless controversy.23 Cf. e.g., Tshadma rigsgter dgongs rgyan (smadcha) 5 lb-52a (= pp. 102-3):'di dag la [i.e., rdzas, log pa, gsalba, dngos po la sogs pa la] gnyis gnyis te Idonla gnaspa 'i rdzas sogs dang I sel ngo 'i rdzas la sogs pa '01 dangpo ni / don la gnaspa V sgra rang mtshan pa Ita bu '01 gnyis pa ni I rtogpa la snang ba / sgra la sogspa 0 // di nigzhan sel kho nay in gyi / rdzas la sogs pa mtshan nyidpa min kyangrtogpa la snang ba 'i sgra sogs la / don rang mtshan gyi sgra sogs su zhen nas zhugspas / mthar de rang mtshan la mi bslu ba 'i phyir / rdzas la sogs pa / tha snyadbyaspayin no //.

In the first case, the par-ticular tree-instances would have to appear to thought as excludedfrom non-trees, and thus, granted that [according to your position]a svalaksana cannot be thought's appearing object (rtogpa'i snangyul), there would be a contradiction with what you accept. In thesecond case, too, for you the tree-instances would have similar ef-fects and would also be similar in being excluded from non-tree, andthus there would a contradiction with your having posited 'excludedfrom non-tree' (shing ma yin las log pa) and 'appearance as excludedfrom non-tree' (shing ma yin las log par snang ba) as both being uni-versals of those instances. Since impermanence, selflessness and thelike would also be nothing more than mere appearances to thought,then impermanence, selflessness, etc. different from these mere men-tal appearances would not be qualities belonging to the real beingof entities and the latter [qualitiesj would not be understood. In thatcase, there would no point whatsoever for you to formulate, in trea-tises, numerous accounts concerning sdmdnya, samdnd-dhikarana,sddhya, sddhana, etc.The reply is as follows. Although 'appearance as excluded from non-tree' (shing ma yin las log par snang ba) is imagined by thought andis not capable of accomplishing an aim (don byedmi nus), still thereis absolutely no contradiction for the particular tree-instances toappear to thought as excluded from non-trees (shing gsal rangmtshanpa rtogpa la shing ma yin las log par snang bayinpa). There-fore, it is logically correct for these to be [respectively] universals andinstances.

The particular tree-instancesappear to thought as excluded from non-tree; what is apprehended(gzung bya) by thought grasping trees and appears to it to be some-thing separate also appears to thought as excluded from non-tree;so, both what is and is not excluded from non-tree are mixed up andthen appear ('dres nas snang) to thought as being excluded fromnon-tree, and do not appear separately; and therefore due to this ap-pearance as such [i.e., as excluded from non-tree] all the while notbeing so [i.e., excluded from non-tree], it [i.e., thought] is obscuredand cannot therefore see the special nature of'exclusion from non-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 243tree' in a way which is not mixed up with anything else.

See also ibid. p. 129 for the standard dGelugs pa view, which is summarized by a Tibetan informant:1) appearance (the actual object) and imputation (the mental im-age) appear undifferentiably mixed, and 2) the image of pot ap-pears to be a pot but is not. Although an image and a pot appear tobe one, thought does not actively conceive them to be one. Thus, itis not a wrong consciousness (logshes) even though it is a mistakenconsciousness ('khrul shes). [The italics are those of Klein.]Similar explanations by Tibetan informants are found in Napper (1986;132ff); see also Klein (1986: 15-6).The central idea of Tsong kha pa etal. can be paraphrased as follows: /.Thought practically applies by determining a fictional representation to bethe external object. 2. However, in its way of apprehension (blo'i 'dzin stangsla) it does not consciously entertain the proposition: \"a fiction is a particu-lar.\" Thus one is not deceived with regard to the adhyavaseya, in that onedoes not explicitly or consciously hold that the fictional representation isthe particular.

It's hard to see that anyone would want to contest thisidea of Tsong kha pa, as it looks like little more than a restatement of thecentral idea of thought proceeding by unconscious error. On the other hand,it's also extremely difficult to see that this truism about not consciously andexplicitly thinking \"the sdmdnyalaksana is the particular,\" would prove thatthe error in thought had to be on the level of appearances and not determi-nations.)30 Cf. William James' pronouncement that the rational statement is that wefeel sorry because we cry, not that we cry because we are sorry, cited inKripke (1982: 93, n. 76). Kripke gives a list of these surprisingly frequent in-versions and parallelisms in philosophy, including examples from James,Hume and Wittgenstein. The statement \"the object of thought is not a par-ticular, but particulars are objects of thought\" is, however, in all fairness, notquite the same thing as what Kripke is describing, in that Kripke's examplesall involve a \"because\"-clause and work their effect by reversing philosophicalpriorities. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of an inversion seeming to be \"sub-tle\" and to undo a conceptual knot is there too.31 See Klein (1986: 136): \"In other words, just like looking in a mirror cancause one to realize something about the reflected image, so through the im-age of an object thought can correctly realize something about the actual ob-ject.\"32 The general question of the Buddhist use or rejection of a mirror theoryof cognition is of interest to comparative philosophy, especially in the lightof R. Rorty's theses in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. Now, it iswell-known that the Sautrantika Sakaravadins hold that perceptual knowl-edge (pratyaksa) of external objects comes about because the objects leave animage or likeness (dkdra) on the mirror of consciousness. See Kajiyama(1965: 429f.), Mookerjee (1935: 77f.) and Mimaki (1976: 72). Glass/crystal(sphatika) is often used as a metaphor for perceptual knowledge in non-Bud-dhist schools, like the Samkhya, who take buddhiox the \"inner organ\"(antahkarana) as being like glass which is \"colored\" by the substances under-neath it. See Nydyabhdsya adNydyasutra 3.2.9 (sphatikdnyatvdbhimdnavattadanyatvdbhimdnah) and also Bai lun T. 1569 shang 171c 22-25; see Tille-mans (1990, endnote 344). Depictions of conceptual thought (vikalpa) interms of mirroring or glass, however, seem rarer, although they do seem tohave some limited support in Indian texts. Dharmakirti in PV III, k.164 and165 does speak of vikalpapratibimba \"the representations/reflections belong-ing to thought\" and \"the representation/reflection of the object\" (arthaprati-"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"ON THE SO-CALLED DIFFICULT POINT 245blmbaka). (Note that pratibimbaka = pratibimba, see Bohtlingk Sanskrit-Worterbuch s.v. pratibimbaka.) Moreover k. 165 specifies that arthapratibim-baka appears in a cognition which arises due to words—the most we can sayis that the cognition with this representation is very indirectly caused bysvaiaksana. Accordingly, the. pratibimba is still better taken as a purely fic-tional constructed representation, rather than as a reflection in a stricter causalsense where a svaiaksana would actually appear in thought via mirroring.The representation involved in thought, thus, is not at all of the same typeof \"mirroring\" as that in a Sautriintika theory of perception where externalobjects are said to be mirrored as dkdra. Finally, we should note that thereare Indian Buddhist contexts in which glass/crystal and mica (abhraka) areused as similes to explain the degrees of vividness of the representation inthought. This is notably the case in NBT ad NB 1.11 (bhutdrthabhavand-prakarsaparyantajam yogijndnam), where Dharmottara discusses \"yogic per-ception\" (yogipratyaksa) of reality as arising right after the utmost vivid stageof conceptualisation of this reality, namely, after the very last moment beforeconceptual meditation becomes non-conceptual yogic perception, thebhutdrthabhdvandprakarsaparyanta \"limit of the superior stage of meditationon the truth.\" The superior stage (prakarsa) is when the object begins to be-come clear; at the limit, it is as if one sees via mica, and finally in perception,it is as if via crystal (amalaka). I think, however, that here we are just dealingwith illustrations ofdegrees of clarity (sphutdbhatva) in a rather special case,the transition to yogic perception: the NBT passage is not, as far as I can see,citing the example of crystal and mica in the context of a general cognitivemodel for all mundane conceptualisation, thus supplanting the model ofconstruction and imagination.33 Cf.

Graham and others have investigated in the Mohist canon.(My point is a logical one, and not one of historical relations.) This ad hoccharacter is not very prominent in the Indian logic to which bsdusgrwa is(very uneasily) related.

Lopez, Jr., University of MichiganTHE FALLACY of asrayasiddhahetu, or a \"logical reason whose basisis unestablished\" arises when the subject of an argument is nonex-istent; in usual cases, this subject failure implies that the propo-sition to be proved (sddhya) cannot be established—Buddhists such asDharmaklrti repeatedly stress that when the subject fails, a debate aboutits properties ceases. To take an invented example, if one says that \"Pega-sus flies around the Aegean,\" it suffices to show that there is no Pegasusand one will have, ipso facto, short-circuited the question of \"his\" flight,or even proved the contrary, i.e., that he does not fly. Similarly, if some-one shows that the Primordial Matter (pradhdna) accepted in Samkhyaphilosophy, does not actually exist, then the Sarnkhya's own thesis thatpradhdnahas such and such properties will thereby be refuted.1 The prob-lem however becomes thorny when one is proving simple nonexistenceof some pseudo-entity, for then the case should be different from that ofPegasus's supposed flight. The height of absurdity would be if all proofsof nonexistence became self-refuting because the subject failed to exist.The problem of dsraydsiddha is taken up in various Buddhist contexts—typically in connection with proofs of momentariness (ksanabhanga-siddhi)2 and in connection with later Madhyamaka proofs of the absenceof intrinsic nature (nihsvabhdvatd).

Besides passages from Dignaga, we should mention thesubstantial and influential sections in Dharmaklrti's PV IV, k. 136-48and PVin III, as well as those in the works of Kamalas'ila, in particular hisMadhyamakdloka (MA).

The present article consists primarily in a transla-tion of the section on dsraydsiddha in a text by A lag sha ngag dbangbstan dar (1759-1840), a dGe lugs pa scholar who was from the A lashan region of Inner Mongolia but wrote in Tibetan and who was, inour opinion, remarkable for his clear and often quite innovative think-ing. His gCig du bralgyi rnam bzhagis 2L Madhyamaka work, one thattreats of various problems centered around the Svatantrika Madhya-maka's use of the ekdnekaviyogahetu (- gcigdu bralgyi gtan tshigs \"nei-ther one nor many reason [for sunyatd]\"). For Ngag dbang bstan dar theproblem of dsraydsiddha arises when the Madhyamaka uses logical rea-sons like the ekdnekaviyogahetu to prove ultimate voidness of things; italso occurs when he uses logical reasoning to prove that pseudo-entitiesdo not exist at all. Ngag dbang bstan dar, thus, like his Indian and Ti-betan Svatantrika predecessors, zig-zags between the Madhyamaka andlogicians' positions, using the latter to buttress the former.A striking aspect of the later Indian and Tibetan explanations ofdsraydsiddha is that certain earlier texts are almost invariably cited inlater ones, giving a kind of \"unfolding telescope\" effect where each sub-sequent text includes its predecessors but seems to enlarge upon themand carry the ideas a few steps further, all the while seeking to remainfaithful to the original intentions of Dignaga. This impression is, how-ever, potentially misleading. In fact, be it the position of Kamalasila,that of Tsong kha pa or Ngag dbang bstan dar, what is at stake is a com-plex synthesis of disparate doctrine that has been elaborated over time;it would thus be a mistake if the seeming elegance of the unfolding tele-scope presentations lulled us into thinking that the later presentation wasalso ahistorically present ab initio, Lopez, in his Study of Svatantrika, hasdescribed the Tibetan theory on dsraydsiddha as it is found in Tsongkha pa, rGyal tshab and ICang skya rol pa'i rdo rje and others: this con-stitutes the received position for Ngag dbang bstan dar.

On certain topics, such as avoid-ance of dsrayasiddha in cases of simple, non-implicative, negation(prasajyapratisedha), bsTan dar makes a radical break with his Indian andTibetan predecessors, and arguably he is right to do so. The rapproche-ment with the Madhyamaka debate on \"concordantly appearing sub-jects\" (chos can mthun snang ba) is also noteworthy for its philosophicalinterest, turning as it does on the general problem of the incommensu-rability of rival theories.Readers will probably recognize that the problem of talking aboutnon-being has a long history, not only in the East, but in the West, in-cluding its twentieth century technical treatment in formal logic's the-ory of descriptions and in the theory of presuppositions.

Second, the doubt that the subject (chos can; dharmin) might be un-established when one presents the formal argument (sbyor ngag; prayoga-vdkya). [Objection:] If we follow what is literally stated in the Madhya-makdlamkdray it is evident that one also presents partless consciousness,Primordial Matter (spyigtso ho;pradhdna) and so forth5 as subjects of en-quiry (shes 'dod chos can) for a valid logical reason.6 Thus this [reason]would have an unestablished basis (gzhi ma grub pa; dsrayasiddha). Wouldit not then result that the reason would be one which is unestablished(ma grub pa; asiddha) because the entity of the subject does not exist?7"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"250 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGE§2. By way of a reply to this [objection], many scholars have said thatthere is no [such] fault so long as one presents simple negations (meddgag; prasajyapratisedha) as both the reason and the property to be proved(bsgrub byai chos; sddhyadharma), but that should one present a posi-tive phenomenon (sgrub pa; vidhi) or an implicative negation (ma yindgag; paryuddsapratisedha), it will then be an unestablished reason.8 Thisdoes indeed seem to be based on certain statements in [the works] ofTsong kha pa and his disciples, such as [the passage] in [Tsong kha pa's]dBu ma dgongspa rab gsal that reads:The fact that there is no fault, even though the subject statedfor that reason might be negated, is due to the essential fea-ture that both the reason and the property [to be proved] aremere exclusions (rnam bead tsam; vyavacchedamdtra).However, this alone can not eliminate all doubt. Thus it is necessary toexplain things as follows. There are cases where [the reason] would notbe a reason that is unestablished, in spite of the fact that one might pre-sent either an implicative negation or a positive phenomenon for boththe reason and the property to be proved. For example, an argumentsuch as \"Take as the subject, a rabbit's horn; it is fitting to be desig-nated by the word 'moon,' because it exists as an object of conceptualthought'—this [argument] is the idea of 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa'i rdorje.9 Alternatively [there could be the argument], \"Take as the subject,being gored by a rabbit's horn; this is a fallacious reason for provingthat a person is in pain, because it is reason that does not have the triplecharacter [needed] for proving that a person is in pain\"—this [argu-ment] is the idea in [dGe 'dun grub pa's] Tshadma rigs rgyan.]0§3. The reason why these [arguments] are not reasons that are un-established because the entity of the subject does not exist devolves fromthe essential feature that when something is [qualified by] either the rea-sons or properties to be proved in the proof of these [propositions], itneed not be existent. So, even when simple negations are presented asboth the reason and property [to be proved], there can also be the faultof the subject being unestablished provided that either the reason orproperty to be proved in the proof in question is pervaded by being ex-istent, as for example when one proves that [something nonexistent likea rabbit's horn] is the subtle selflessness of the elements (chos kyi bdagmed; dharmanairdtmya) by means of the reason, \"being the consummate"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENCE? 251[nature]\" (yongs grub; parinispanna).n Consequently, when one presentsan unestablished basis as the subject, then all cases where a thing's be-ing held to be [qualified by] the reason necessitates its being existentwill [incur the fault of] being fallacious reasons unestablished becauseof the nonexistence of the entity of the subject, but when being held tobe [qualified by] the reason does not necessitate being existent, then the[reason] will not be fallacious. The details of this way [of distinguishingbetween faulty reasons and valid ones] should be correctly brought out.§4. In general, the subject of an argument is of two sorts, the subjectthat is the [proponent's] own [intended] locus (rangrten choscan)1 anda nominal subject (chos can yba'zhigpa; kevaladharmin).^ Between thesetwo, the subject that is the [proponent's] own [intended] locus is, e.g.,when one proves to a Samkhya that sound is impermanent by means ofthe reason that it is produced, for at that time one proves imperma-nence based upon the simple [commonly recognized entity] sound. Anominal subject is, e.g., when one proves to a Vais'esika that the space,which is [taken by the Vais'esika to be] a real entity (dngosporgyurpa'inam mkha) vastubhutdkdsa), is not [in fact] a permanent substance [asthey maintain it is] by means of the reason that it does not serve as thelocus for other qualities. [This is called a \"nominal subject\"] because, atthat time, one is not proving that being a permanent substance is locatedin a real entity, space, and thus this type of space is just merely pre-sented as the subject, but is not the locus or subject.14 Now, something'sbeing a \"nominal subject\" means that although it might be stated as thesubject, it is not the locus of the property to be proved (sddhyadharma),and is thus an unrelated subject. Consequently, although the nominalsubject, i.e., the stated subject [as Tsong kha pa refers to it in §2 above],in the argument in question [against the Vais'esika] is an unestablishedbasis, the subject that is the [proponent's] own [intended] locus does ex-ist, because at that time it is what appears to the conceptual thoughtgrasping the real entity space (vastubhutdkdsa) as excluded from the con-trary of real space that is the [actual] subject or locus for the proof inquestion. It follows that this is so, because [this appearance] is like that[i.e., is the actual locus], due to the fact that the desire to know (shes 'dod;jijndsd) occurs once the opponent has mistakenly taken this type of spaceand the [conceptual] appearance as such [a space] to be identical.15Therefore, in order that we understand this difference between the factthat in the argument in question the subject that is the [proponent's] ownlocus is an established basis, while the nominal subject that is presented"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"252 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEin the actual words is not an established basis, [Dignaga] stated in thePramdnasamiiccaya:With regard to the [proponent's] own locus (rang rten la), [athesis is not opposed] by perceptible states of affairs, by in-ference, by authorities or by what is commonly recognized.16The purpose behind [Dignaga's] not saying \"the [proponent's] own sub-ject\" (rang gi chos can; svadharmin) here but rather \"the [proponent's]own locus\" (ranggi rten), was explained in extenso in thirteen verses fromthe Pratyaksapariccheda in Pramdnvdrttika, verses that begin \"sarvatravddino ...sva\"...V7§5. [Objection:] Then, it would follow [absurdly] that the appear-ance as something excluded from not-sound (sgra mayin pa las log parsnang ba) would also be the subject that is the [proponent's] own locuswhen proving that sound is impermanent by means of the reason thatit is produced, because that is what you asserted [about space].§6. [Reply:] This is not the same, because of the following: if some-thing is a valid reason it must be established on the basis of the subjectof enquiry in accordance with its mode of presentation ('god tshul),1*and so, because the appearance to conceptual thought as something ex-cluded from not-sound is an imagined entity (kun brtags; parikalpita),it does not concord at all with being a product.19 This follows, for it wasstated in [Tsong kha pa's] dBu ma rgyan gyi zin bris:If one is proving that sound is impermanent because it is pro-duced, then as the exclusion qua appearance (snang Idog),which appears to conceptual thought as excluded from notsound, is not a real entity (dngos po), the reason, i.e., beingproduced, does not qualify it. Rather, [being produced] mustqualify the basis of the appearance (snang gzhi), i.e., sound.This is due to the essential feature that real entities (dngospo)are taken as the reason and property to be proved.The [latter] necessary implication (khyab pa; vydpti) holds, because (a)it is obvious that a conceptual appearance will not be established as thesubject of enquiry of an argument where real entities are presented asthe reason and property to be proved, and (b) it was stated in the rNamnges dar tik [of rGyal tshab rje]:"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENCE? 253The [two cases] are not the same, because the conceptual ap-pearance of space is the subject that is the basis ascertained as[qualified by] the previous reason [in the argument againstthe Vais'esika], but what appears to conceptual thought assound cannot be the basis that is ascertained as produced.§7. To summarize, although we present space as the subject to theVais'esika, it is not the subject, but the appearance of this [space] is thesubject. And when we prove that sound is impermanent by means of thereason, being produced, what appears as sound to conceptual thoughtdoes not serve as the subject, rather it is mere sound itself that serves asthe subject that is the [proponent's] own [intended] locus. The reasonfor this, if one carries it as far as possible, comes down to whether thereis or is not a subject that appears concordantly (chos can mthun snangba) to both the Buddhist and the Vaisesika, for the Buddhist acceptsspace as being a simple negation (med dgag) consisting in the mere de-nial of obstruction and contact, whereas the Vaisesika accepts that it isa real entity (dngospo) that is independent (rang dbang ba) and is a pos-itive phenomenon (sgrub pa).20§8. [Objection:] Then it would follow that even sound would not ap-pear concordantly to both [parties], because the Buddhist asserts thatsound is derived from the elements ('byung 'gyur; bhautika), whereas theVais'esika asserts that sound is a quality of space (nam mkha'iyon tan;dkdsaguna).§9. [Reply:] This is completely different on account of the essentialfeature that, to both these [parties], a mere object grasped by the audi-tive consciousness is established as appearing concordantly as an objectfound by non-erroneous means of valid cognition (tshadma; pramdna),21whereas in the case of case of space, if [the parties] were to search for thedesignated object (btags don), they would find no object established asappearing concordantly apart from the mere verbal designation.§10. Moreover, the omniscient ICang skya [rol pa'i rdo rje] has saidthat rGyal tshab rje maintained that the conceptual appearance (nogpa'i snang ba) was the subject, but that mKhas grub rje did not acceptthat verbal objects (sgra don; sabddrtha) [i.e., conceptual entities] werethe subject.22 And the omniscient 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa has said thattaking Primordial Matter as the subject was Dignaga's idea, and thatDharmakirti's idea was to take the conceptual appearance as the subject.However, suppose we examine their ideas carefully. Then whosoever's"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"254 SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEposition we might take, be it that of Dignaga and his disciple [Dhar-makirti] or that of Tsong kha pa and his disciples [rGyal tshab rje andinKhas grub rje], if we presented an argument like \"Take as the subject,Primordial Matter; it is not the substratum (nyer len; updddna) for itsvarious manifestations (mam 'gyur; vikrti), because it is not perceived tobe the substratum of its various manifestations,\"23 none would deny thatit is correct to take what appears as excluded from not-Primordial Mat-ter to the conceptual thought grasping Primordial Matter (gtso bo 'dzinpa V rtogpa la gtso bo may in pa las log par snang ba) as being the subjectof this argument. For it was stated in the Madhyamakaloka [of Kama-las'ila]:It is just what exists as an aspect of mind, but is metaphori-cally designated by the infantile as external and real, that is thesubject. Therefore, one negates Primordial Matter and thelike in dependence upon that.24§11. There is a necessary implication (khyab pa; vydpti) here [be-tween what the passage from the Madhyamakaloka says and the fact thatthe subject is a conceptual appearance], because [Kamalas'lla's] words \"Itis just what exists as an aspect of mind that is the subject\" make it clearthat he holds the conceptual appearance to be the subject.25 This is alsothe case because of the following quotations. It is said in the Svdrthd-numdnapariccheda [of Dharmakirti's Pramdnavdrttika]:A verbal object [can] be a dharma of three types [a basis forexistence, for nonexistence or for both].ex[To which] [Dharmakirti's] Svavrtti states:Thus, those who depend upon this subject [deliberate aboutexistence and nonexistence, asking whether] this object thatis represented by the word \"Primordial Matter\" [does or doesnot have a real substratum].26In the commentary on this [passage] Sakyabuddhi says:What is expressed by the word \"Primordial Matter,\" that aloneis the subject."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENCE? 255And in [mKlias grub rje's] rNam 'greltik chen rigs pa i rgya mtsho it is said:This means that because it is generally taught that all con-ceptual appearances are verbal objects (sgra don; sabddrtha),27what appears as Primordial Matter to the conceptual thoughtgrasping Primordial Matter is also established as being a ver-bal object. And in this way it is the exclusion qua basis (gzhiIdog) of the verbal object for Primordial Matter, or [in otherwords] it is just what appears as Primordial Matter to con-ceptual thought, that is the subject of this argument.28§12. Here an opponent might say: Take as the subject the verbal ob-ject for Primordial Matter (gtso bo'i sgra don); it would follow that thiswould be the subject of that argument [mentioned earlier], because theappearance as Primordial Matter to the conceptual thought graspingPrimordial Matter (gtso bo 'dzin pa'i rtogpa la gtso bor snang ba) is thesubject of that argument.§13. [We would reply:] There is no necessary implication (ma khyab).§14. [The opponent:] It would follow that there is a necessary im-plication, because the appearance as Primordial Matter to conceptualthought is the verbal object for Primordial Matter. -§15. [We would reply:] Again there is no necessary implication, be-cause there is a difFerence between an exclusion qua thing itself (rangIdog) and an exclusion qua basis [of the thing] (gzhi Idog).29 For it wasstated in the same [rNam 'grelj tlk chen [of mKhas grub rje]:Therefore, the subject when one says \"Primordial Matter isnot existent, because it is not perceived\" is neither a real (dngospo ba) Primordial Matter, nor is it the exclusion qua thing it-self of the verbal object for Primordial Matter (gtso bo'i sgradon gyi rang Idog). Why? This very appearance as PrimordialMatter to conceptual thought is asserted by the Samkhyas tobe the [actual] Primordial Matter endowed with the five qual-ities, but in our own system we assert that it is a verbal object.Thus, the conceptual appearance as Primordial Matter is con-sidered to be the subject, because it is the basis of the debateabout whether [something] is or is not the Primordial Mat-ter endowed with the five qualities."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"256  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEA differentiation between the exclusion qua thing itself (rang Idog) andthe exclusion qua basis [for the thing] (gzhi Idog) is extremely valuablein this context.30§16. This [point] is related to the essential feature that although theSamkhya believes in this type of conceptual appearance, he does not be-lieve that this appearance is a verbal object, for in [mKhas grub rje's]Tshad mayidkyi mun selit is said:Also for the foolish opponent to say that the verbal object forthis type of [autonomous and substantially existent (rang rkyathubpa'i rdzasyod)} self is the subject would be a proclamationof his own faults since he accepts that the verbal object of thistype of self (de Ita bu bdaggi sgra don) does not [really] exist.§17. Thus, it is indeed correct that the conceptual appearance is thesubject, but when one is refuting an opponent's position, one does nothave to present literally the conceptual appearance as being the subject.Why? It is because the very Primordial Matter, permanent Is'vara, au-tonomous persons and so forth in which the opponent believes must beexplictly presented as the subjects in just the same way [as the opponentbelieves in them]. Otherwise there would be the fault that PrimordialMatter and so forth would not be negated in themselves (rang Idog nas).31For in [rGyal tshab rje's] rNam grel thar lamgsalbyed it was said:Their thought according to the Lord of scholars, Kamalasila,was that Primordial Matter had to be refuted by [explicitly]taking it as the subject. Otherwise, although [the property of]being the substratum of various manifestations might be ne-gated, Primordial Matter would not be negated in itself (rangIdognas). The basis for ascertaining the reason with apramdnais maintained to be just the appearance as Primordial Matter(gtso bor snang ba nyid).51§18. [Objection:] In that case, it follows that the conceptual ap-pearance cannot correctly be held to be the subject, because it is void ofability to perform a function (don byed nus pa; arthakriydsdmarthya).There is a necessary implication, because whatever is void of ability toperform a funtion cannot properly be a basis of deliberation for the per-spicacious (rtogldan; preksdvat). In this vein, the Pramdnavdrttika stated:"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENCE? 257What point is there, for those who have such an aim, in de-liberations about a thing that has no ability to perform a func-tion? Why should a woman rilled with desire wonder whethera eunuch was handsome or not?§19. [We reply:] There is no necessary implication (ma khyab). Thisis for the following reasons. The meaning of this quotation is that whensomeone hopes his desired effect will ensue from some basis, then thebasis about which he deliberates must have the ability to perform thefunction. Thus, [Dharmakirti] illustrates [his point about the useless-ness of deliberation about inefficient things] saying that it is inappro-priate, because it would be like, for example, a woman, intent upon sex-ual pleasure, who took as the subject [of her thought] a eunuch, and after[mistakenly] hearing that he could perform the acts that would give [herpleasure], wondered whether he was handsome or not. Nonetheless, ingeneral, things that are void of ability to perform a function can prop-erly be bases for [positive] proofs and negations. Indeed, the direct ba-sis (dngos rten) for proofs and negations must inevitably be a verbal ob-ject. This follows, because:(a) the reason why the direct basis must be a verbal object when oneis denying that sound is permanent or proving that it is impermanentby the reason of its being produced is also grounded in the fact33 thatthe conceptual thought that proves or negates relies upon verbal objects;(b) it was said in the Pardrthdnumdnapariccheda [otPramdnavdrttika],...We accept that all [positive] proof and negation (vidhini-sedhana) here [in practical activity (tyavahdra)] is in relianceupon a verbal object..., which has no external basis;34(c) when it is said that permanence is negated and impermanence isproved with regard to sound, what is meant [here] is the performanceof the function of conceptual thought (rtogpa'idon byed), and thus, onsuch an occasion, particular (rang mtshan pa; svalaksana) sounds, im-permanent things or products and so forth do not directly (dngos sit) ap-pear to the conceptual thought that proves or negates.In this vein, it was stated in [Tsong kha pa's] dBu ma rgyangyizin bris;The [Pramdnajvdrttika, the sense of Dignaga's statements,states:"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"258  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEHowever, this condition of practical designations in terms ofv/hat infers (anumdna) [i.e., the logical reason] and the propo-sition to be inferrred (anumeydrtha) is constructed in depen-dence upon a difference established by means of [conceptual]thought.35Following this explanation, in cases where the basis must be?. real entity (dngos po), [such as when one is] proving thatsound is impermanent because it is produced or that there isfire on the smoky hill, the direct basis (dngos rten) for theseproofs and negations is just the object that is the appearanceof sound or hill to conceptual thought as things excluded fromwhat they are not. Sound and hill are not, however, them-selves direct bases, because they do not directly appear to theconceptual thought that proves or negates.As for the meaning of conceptual thought performing the function ofnegation and proof, it is as follows. When, for example, the quality ofthe subject (phyogs chos; paksadharma) is established for proving soundto be impermanent by the reason that it is a product, then from the per-spective of the opponent, it is as if sound is initially established and af-ter that producthood newly depends upon sound.

See Tillemans (1995a: 869 and n. 19) andDreyfus (1997: 161, 163, 167 etpassim). Note that this latter schema, i.e.,song tshod kyi chos can and rlom tshod kyi chos cany is applied to the problemof dsraydsiddha in a way that does not seem to coincide fully with the sva-dharmin and kevaladharmin contrast. See n. 13 on svadharmin vs. kevala-dharmin.4 Selections from his work on particulars and universals, i.e., his Rang mtshanspyi mtshan gyi mam bzhag rtsom phro, have been translated in Klein (1991).A translation of his commentary on the Heart Sutra appears in Lopez (1988:"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"266  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGE137-59).

Note that following rGyal tshab's dBu margyangyi brjed byang (Sarnath ed. p. 80), the refutation of partless conscious-ness is in the context of the refutation of the Sautrantika view that the \"man-ifold is non-dual\" (sna tshogs gnyis medpa). The Madhyamaka argues that theaspects/images (mam pa; dkdra) cannot be substantially distinct (rdzas thadad) from each other, because they are not substantially distinct from a part-less unitary consciousness (shespa cha med gcig): mDo sdepa'i lugs dgagpa la /sna tshogs gnyis medpa / sgo nga phyad tshal ba I mam shes grangs mnyam pa Vlugs dgagpa 'o // dangpo ni I shes sogs bzhi la I shes pa gcig la sngo ser dkar dmarsogs mam pa da ma shar ba \"i tshe mam pa de mams rdzas tha dad min par thai/ de mams shes pa cha med gcig dang tha dad min pa'i phyir /.

The \"reason that is unestablished (asiddha) because of the nonexistenceof the entity of the subject\" (chos can gyi ngo bo mednas ma grub pa'i gtantshigs) is a subdivision of the first category.8 On these two types of negation, see Kajiyama (1973: I67f.) and the refer-ences in his n. 1. Indian Buddhist logicians had the important insight thatproving a mere negation of existence is, in its logical structure, quite differentfrom proving positive qualities, and that in the former case (i.e., simple de-nial along the lines of \"it is not so that S is existent\") subject failure is not aproblem at all whereas in the latter case it is. Cf. Matilal (1970). Tibetan ex-planations of ds'rayasiddha, such as those found in dBu ma rgyan gyi zin brisand iCang skya grub mtha \\ generally cite a passage from Kamalas'lla's MA asbeing the source for this idea.

On Kamalas'lla's different treatment of dsray'dsiddha inhis earlier Madhyamakdlamkdrapanjikd and in the later MA, see Kobayashi(1989). The Tibetan dGe lugs pa treatment of the problem has been devel-oped in detail in Lopez (1987: 168-80), Klein (1991: 118-19, 173-81, etpassim).In fact the central idea in the MA that one avoided dsraydsiddha when theproperty being proved was a simple negation was already clearly formulatedwell before Kamalas'ila. What we find in the Indian Buddhist literature isthat Dharmakirtian commentators, like Devendrabuddhi and Sakyabuddhi, intheir explanations of PVIV, k. 136-48, emphasize the idea that subjects, likespace, taken as real (dngos por gyur pa = vastubhuta) by the opponents, are ke-vala in nonexistence proofs where the property to be proved and the reason are\"mere exclusions\" (rnampar gcodpa tsam = vyavacchedamdtra); in these specialcases, the subjects can be negated with impunity. Although Devendrabuddhihimself does not gloss these \"mere exclusions\" by the notion of non-implica-tive negations (prasajyapratisedha) so often invoked in Buddhist philosophy,the transition is very natural and is, indeed, explicitly made by Sakyabuddhi:mere exclusion means that no entity or positive property is stated, implied orpresupposed.

This is because in spite ofthere being no subject that would be a real entity, there is no in-validation of the mere exclusion of the conventionally designatedsubject.\"Our thanks to Mr. Ryusei Keira for making us aware of this passage fromSakyabuddhi.This position concerning \"mere exclusion\" was adopted by later Indianwriters such as Prajnakaragupta, Kamalasila and by Tibetans such as Tsongkha pa, et ai, with the further development that it was argued that when aBuddhist logician was proving a mere exclusion, or non-implicative negation(e.g., that such and such a pseudo-entity did not exist), the Buddhist propo-nent's intended subject, the svadharmin, was just the conceptual image. (Inthe case of Dharmakirti and Devendrabuddhi it is not at all clear that thislast additional development is also attributable to them. See n. 13. [Editor'snote: see also chapter 8 in the present volume.]) Ngag dbang bstan dar showsthe rough edges and pitfalls of this Indo-Tibetan attempt to use the distinc-tion between the two types of negation as a watertight way to delineate be-tween harmless subject failures and genuine dsraydsiddha.9 Unidentified in 'Jam dbyangs bzhad pa. The example purports to showthat the property being predicated of a nonexistent subject (like a rabbit'shorn) can be a positive entity (vidhi) or an implicative negation: it need notnecessarily be a prasajyapratisedha if we are to avoid dsraydsiddha. The prop-erty being proved here, viz., \"being fit (rung ba = yogya) to be designated bythe word 'moon,'\" is itself a positive entity. Ngag dbang bstan dar, suppos-edly following 'Jams dbyangs bzhad pa, has hearkened back to the argumen-tation found in the pratitibddhd section in PV IV, k. 109-30, NB III, PVinIII, etc., where Dharmakirti develops the idea that any word is fit (yogya) todesignate any object, the use and correctness of words depending only uponthe speaker's linguistic intention (vivaksd).

Thus, a rabbit's horn is indeed fit to be the designatum (abhidheya)of the word \"moon,\" in that there is no objective or intrinsic nature found inwords or objects that would preclude such a use.Ngag bdang bstan dar is obviously playing with a frequently found reason-ing (prayoga) called grags pa'i nags (''reason based on what is commonly ac-cepted\" [gragspa = prasiddha, prattti]). This reasoning is given in Indian andTibetan texts to establish the fact that sasin {ri bong can, \"that which has arabbit,\" \"that which is hare-marked\") is fit to be the designatum of the wordcandra (\"moon\"). The trick is to change ri bong can to ri bong rwa C'the rab-bit's horn\"). On the Indian reasoning, see Durvekamis'ra's Dharmottara-pradipa 184.16-17:evarn tu prayoga drastavyah yo 'rtho vikalpavijndnavisayah sa sdnike-tikena sabdena vaktum sakyah I yathd sdkhddimdnartho vrksasabdenaI vikalpavijhanavisayas ca sasiti I \"The formal argument (prayoga)should be regarded as follows: 'Whatever entity is the object of aconceptual cognition, can be designated by an agreed upon word,just like the entity having branches and so forth [can be designated]by the word 'tree'. Now, sasin is the object of a conceptual cogni-tion.\"3 (The conclusion is that sasin can be designated by the agreedupon word candra?)The usual Tibetan formulation of the prayoga is: ri bong can la zla ba zhespa / sgras btjodrung bayin te Irtogyulnayodpa'i phyir /\"That which is hare-marked is fitting to be designated by the word 'moon' because it exists as anobject of conceptualization\"; see Yongs 'dzin nags rigs, p. 46.10 See Tshad ma rigs rgyan 117a.11 See Lopez (1987: 173—74). just as it was shown that avoidance ofdsrayasiddha is possible even where the property is a positive entity, so nowNgag bdang bstan dar shows that the reason and property being non-im-plicative negations will not guarantee that dsrayasiddha is avoided.

In short, it is not so that ds'rayd-siddha is avoided if and only if the reason and property are vyavacchedamdtra.Ngag dbang bstan dar, to his credit, proposes a stricter criterion than had hisIndo-Tibetan predecessors: dsraydsiddha will be avoided if and only if thereason and property do not imply existence. The innovation here is discrete,but it represents a radically different, and even in some ways better, approach:it turns on the sound logical insight that certain properties (like being blue,etc.) imply existence, while others (like \"being thought of\") do not, and thatsubject failure will lead to refutation in all and only the former types of cases.12 The term rang rten chos can is most likely a Tibetan invention, based onTibetan writers' choice of a rather misleading Tibetan translation of thePSV, a translation which was also reflected in the sDe dge and Co ne edi-tions of PS III, k. 2. See Tillemans (1984c: 42) for the details. In brief,PSV(a) adVS III, k. 2cd reads deyang ma bsal ba'0 //mngon sum don dangtjes dpag dang //yid ches gragspas rang rten Wo, whereas the Peking version ofPS III, k. 2cd and of PSV(b) have: ranggi chos can la mngon sum don dangrjes dpag dang // yid ches grags pas ma bsal ba'o //. See Kitagawa (1973:471-72). What happened is that major dGe lugs and Sa skya writers citedPSV(a)\\s text mngon sum ... rang rten la '0 without the initial deyang ma bsalba 0, which they probably considered to be an independent sentence due toits final particle.

In what is an ironic, but understandableblunder, Ngag dbang bstan dar will subsequently on p. 455 argue thatDignaga himself did not speak of ranggi chos can (svadharmin), but ratherranggyi rten.13 Ngag dbang bstan dar has introduced one of the key themes in the Indo-Tibetan explanations of dsraydsiddha^ viz., the contrast between svadharminand kevaladharmin. Amongst Indian authors, the starting point in their dis-cussion of dsraydsiddha consists in Dignaga's definition of the thesis(paksalaksana) in PS III, k. 2, in particular, the specification that the thesisshould not be opposed (anirdkrta) by perception and other means of validcognition with regard to the proponent s own intended subject (svadharmini\"with regard to his own subject\"). See n. 12. While Dignaga only spoke ofsvadharmin, Dharmakirti in PV IV, k. 136-48 introduced the idea of a con-trast between svadharmin and kevaladharmin, the latter being a nominal orunrelated subject, one which may be merely stated but which is not actuallywhat is qualified by the property to be proved. This contrast comes up againand again in Ngag dbang bstan dar, and indeed he mentions the twelvekdrikds in PV IV (not III!) as being the Indian source.Important in the philosophical background to this discussion of svadhar-min and kevaladharmin (although not so often explicitly cited in Tibetantexts) is Dignaga's treatment in the Nydyamukha of the Samkhya's argumentsconcerning Primordial Matter (pradhdna) and other such postulates in theSamkhya system. Dignaga had argued \"pradhdna and so forth do not existbecause they are not perceived\" (na santi pradhdnddayo hupalabdheh) andspoke of \"non-perception being a property of an imagined object\" (kalpi-tasydnupalahdhir dharmah). See Katsura (1992: 230-31); Tucci (1930:16-17); Sanskrit fragments in Svavrtti(ed. Gnoli: 105 and 107). This ideaof an imagined subject was then generalized by Dharmakirti to form a keypart of his apoha theory. In particular, he took the anti-Samkhya argumentin Dignaga's NM proving the nonexistence of pradhdna as well as the NM'sphrase kalpitasydnupalabdhir dharmah to lead to the general principle in PVI, k. 205-12, the Svavrtti and PVin III that the directly designated objects ofwords were always conceptual representations (kalpand); he then maintainedthat although pradhdna did not exist as something real and external, its con-ceptual representation, or in other words, the verbal object (sabddrtha) ex-isted, so that the charge of dsraydsiddha did not apply.In later developments, including what we find in the dGe lugs pa positionsand clearly in Ngag dbang bstan dar, the Dharmakirtian general principle ofdesignata being only concepts will be combined with the svadharmin versuskevaladharmin contrast to explain when dsraydsiddha is avoidable and whenit is not. Grosso modo, in nonexistence proofs the svadharmin is the concept"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"272  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEand no more; the kevaladharmin is the pseudo-entity. Ngag bdang bstan darhere (following Tsong kha pa and others) applies this point of view to PVIV, k. l4l-42's discussion where the Buddhist refutes the Vais'esika's versionof space. Thus the Vais'esika's space becomes the kevaladharmin, whereas theconceptual representation of space is the svadharmin, i.e., the subject ac-cepted by the Buddhist himself. Although the kevaladharmin is obviously re-futed, the svadharmin is not and hence dsraydsiddha is avoided. However,this synthesis is arguably a later invention. Tillemans is of the opinion thatwhile for a writer like Kamalas'lla (who figures so prominently in the Tibetantheories) this move to combine the notions of svadharmin and conceptualsubjects is present in his MA, in the case of Dharmakirti this combination isnot very likely. The kdrikds in PV IV (viz., k. 141-42) that are often inter-preted as supporting this combination are probably better interpreted differ-ently. First of all, Prajnakaragupta's PVBh ad?V IV, k. 141-42 clearlyspecifies two interpretations of the kdrikds at stake. One advocates provingnonexistence with regard to a subject that is \"completely derived from con-ceptual thought\" (vikalpaparinisthite dharmini) and thus that the conceptualsubject is the svadharmin. The other paraphrases the controversial reasoningabout space in such a way that the svadharmin becomes a real entity accept-able to the Buddhist, namely, the impermanent space that Buddhists them-selves accept. See PVBh 550.18: tathdpy anityam dkds'am dharmi bhavisyati.Secondly, this latter interpretation in PVBh fits noticeably better into therest of the argumentation in PV IV, k. 136—48, where a completely parallelreasoning against the Samkhya sukhddi (\"pleasure, etc.\" = the three gunas) isintroduced by tathaiva (\"in precisely this way\") in k. 144—45. This time thesvadharmin is clearly taken by Dharmakirti as not being the conceptual repre-sentation of sukhddi, but as being the ordinary, impermanent sensations ofpleasure that the Buddhist himself acknowledges. The impression is thatreading an advocacy of the combination of svadharmin with conceptual sub-jects into Dharmakirti is a later position that may well change Dharmakirti'sown stance. The svadharmin may well have been no more than an entity ac-ceptable as real (and not conceptual) to the Buddhist himself And determin-ing what this actual subject was seems to have involved paraphrasing of theexplicitly stated arguments, but had little to do with postulating conceptualsubjects. [Editor's note: see chapter 8 in the present volume.]14 Ngag dbang bstan dar is (correctly) simplifying the argument. As itstands in Dharmakirti, the reasoning at stake seeks to prove that space doesnot have \"a novel nature unproduced by other conditions,\" in other words,a permanent but real intrinsic nature. Cf. PV IV, k. 141-42:yathd parair aniitpddydpurvaruparn [i] na khddikam / sakrcchabdd-"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENT? 273dyahetutvdd ity nkteprdha dusakah II tadvad vastusvabhdvo san dharrnivyomddir ity api I naivam istasya sddhyasya bddhd kdcana [2] vidyateII \"When [the Buddhist] states that space, etc. do not have a novelnature unproduced by other [conditions] because they are notcauses for [producing their qualities such as] sound, etc. all at once,then the [Vaisesika] adversary might say that like that the subject,space, etc., would also not: have the nature of a real entity.

Tib. ga' yang; [3] PVV evam dharrnibddhane  'pi.15 The argument presupposes some fundamental positions in the dGe lugspa understanding of apoha. In brief, the dGe lugs pa explain the conceptualrepresentation of real space (dngos gyur gyi narn mkha' = vasttibhutdkdsa) asbeing \"what appears as excluded from the contrary of real space\" (dngos gyurgyi narn mkha' may in pa las log par snang ba). They then add the additionalstep that not only does the conceptual appearance/representation {snang ba)itself appear in this way but real space itself (albeit nonexistent) also appears(snang) as excluded from the contrary of real space. The result is that the dGelugs can argue that the svadharmin, the actual dharmin that is being arguedabout, i.e., the conceptual representation, appears concordantly (mthunsnang) to both parties in the debate. However, the Vais'esika, who believes invastubhutdkdsa, does not know that it is only a mentally invented conceptbeing argued about rather than vasttibhutdkdsa itself. The opponent thus hasthe impression that he is arguing about actual space, while the Buddhist pro-ponent knows that they are both only arguing about the concept. This is saidto be possible because both real space itself and the representation/appear-ance (snang ba) appear erroneously mixed together ('dres nas) to conceptualthought. An analysis of this type of argumentation is to be found in Tille-mans (1995a); see Lopez (1987: 178-79) for rGyal tshab's use of the sametype of argument; see Klein (1991: 35-36) on ICang skya's and bsTan dar'sposition that \"the actual object appears, mixed with its image, to thought\";see also Yoshimizu (1997: 1107-8); Dreyfus (1992: 36 etsq).

It seems co be equally re-jected by Sa skya pas like Sakya mchog ldan; see Tillemans (1995a: 872 etsq.).

Cf. the definition of the paksadharrna(tva) in Yongs 'dzin rtagsrigs, p. 23:de sgrub kyi shes 'dod chos can sky on med kyi steng du 'god tshul dangnithunparyodpa nyiddu tshadmas ngespal \"It [i.e., the reason] isascertained by a pramdna to exist relative to the faultless subject ofenquiry in accordance with the mode of presentation.\"The 'god tshul, or \"mode of presentation,\" in Ngag dbang bstan dar (as in"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXISTENCE? 275Yongs 'dzin nags rigs) refers to the type of verb stated in the reason, i.e., thecopula yin as in e.g., byaspayinpa'iphyir or byaspazphyir \"because.. .is aproduct\" or the existential yod as in du ba yodpa'i phyir \"because there issmoke.\" We thus have the possibility of yin 'god or yod 'god. The point of in-cluding 'god tshul dang mthun par in the definition of the paksadharma(tva) isa rather cumbersome way to guarantee that the subject possesses the propertyof the reason in the very same way as the proponent has stated, i.e., yin ox yod,19 Ngag dbang bstan dar's reply here and in what follows turns on theprinciple that the reason must be a property of the subject, i.e., of the sva-dharmin: in other words, the reason must be apaksadharma (see n. 18).Now, when we prove that space is not a permanent substance, the concep-tual representation of space is indeed not a substance, and will also be quali-fied by the reason. Thus the paksadharmatva will hold. On the other hand, ifwe are validly proving that sound is impermanent because it is produced,then sound itself (and not the concept of sound) must be the svadharmin.This is because sound is both impermanent and something causally pro-duced—hence the paksadharmatva holds with regard to that subject, i.e.,sound qua particular, rather than the concept of sound. See Lopez (1987:175-76).20 On the Tibetan development of the problem of chos can mthun snang ba(\"concordantly appearing subjects\") see D. Lopez (1987: 78 etpassim);Hopkins (1989); Yotsuya (1995); Tillemans (1990: 42f); Tillemans andTomabechi (1995: n. 25). The term chos can mthun snang ba is a Tibetaninvention with no Sanskrit equivalent. The notion is developed by Tsongkha pa in Lam rim chen mo, Drangs nges legs bshad snyingpo and other worksas a philosophical elaboration upon a section in the Bhavaviveka-Candraldrtidebate in PrP I (ed. L. de la Vallee Poussin, reprint ed.: 26. etseq.), whereRealist and Sunyavadin conceptions are argued to be radically incommensu-rable so that there are no commonly acknowledged (ubhayaprasiddha) sub-jects when the two parties are debating about ultimate truth—see Tillemans(1992c: n. 5) for a translation of the passage from PrP. The issue is alsotaken up by non-dGe lugs pa writers (such as Go rams pa bsod nams seng gein his ITa ba'i ngan j<?/4laf), but plays a particularly important, and undeni-ably complex, role in the dGe lugs pa Svatantrika Madhyamaka system.Ngag bdang bstan dar is presupposing an understanding of Tsong kha pa'sposition on Svatantrika. The point in the argument is delicate. Judging bythe previous discussion, bsTan dar seems to accept that the svadharmin inthe Buddhist-Vais'esika argument, viz., the concept of space, is what bothparties are actually arguing about—nonetheless this conceptual svadharmin,as he had said earlier, could not be explicitly acknowledged by the Vais'esika"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"276  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEopponent, who thinks he is arguing about real space (vastubhutdkdsa). bsTandar then argues that space itself is incommensurable for both parties, i.e.,given the parties' differing respective views on what space is, a concordantlyappearing and commonly acknowledged (ubhayaprasiddha) space cannot bewhat they are arguing about: space is thus the kevaladharmin and cannot bethe svadharmin. (Here one could reasonably ask if the svadharmin, i.e., theconcept, appears concordantly to both, given their respective positions.) Inwhat follows, Ngag dbang bstan dar alludes to an objection in PrP that if theRealist and Sunyavadin have no commonly recognized subject, then nor doBuddhists and Vais'esikas when they argue about sound being impermanentor not, given that both have different conceptions of what sound is; see PrP(reprint ed.: 29). The dGe lugs pa reply, based on Candrakirti, is that sound,irrespective of one's philosophical theories, is heard commonly by both par-ties, whereas space is just a purely theoretical notion without any perceptualcontent in common for both parties.21 Ngag bstan dar is arguing from a Svatantrika position where concor-dantly appearing subjects and especially non-erroneous valid cognitions mustbe possible for both parties, as this is a condition for the logical reasons being\"autonomous\" (rang rgyud = svatantra). The phrase ma 'khrul ba'i tshad ma'irnyeddon du mthun snang du grub pa (\"established as appearing concordantlyas an object found by non-erroneous means of valid cognition\") alludes tothe dGe lugs pa view that for a Svatantrika, who holds a type of limited real-ism, a pramdna is non-erroneous in apprehending its objects as being estab-lished by their own intrinsic natures (ranggi mtshan nyid kyis grub pa). Notethat for a Prasangika, by contrast, a pramdna can supposedly never be correctin this way, because these intrinsic natures do not exist at all, and thus forhim all pramdnas without exception would be erroneous. The incommensu-rability between Realist and Sunyavadin then lies in the fact that the way thesubject is established by a pramdna (tshad mas grub tshul) will differ for thetwo parties, the realist taking the pramdna as non-erroneous and theSunyavadin holding it to be erroneous.

In fact, it is to be found in a verylong purvapaksa where a logician's position is presented, one which Kamala-sila replied to by drawing partial parallels with his own philosophical projectof proving ultimate lack of intrinsic nature (nihsvabhdvatd). The logician'sposition, which looks to be a type of Alikdkdravdda (\"false images'), heldthat: (a) the dharmin is said a mental entity, but in reality is not mind andhas no real existence at all, being only an imagined and unreal menial image(dkdra); (b) the ordinary person erroneously conflates the image with the ob-jects themselves; (c) mind really exists although the images are unreal.

PV III, k. 287ab:s'abddrthagrdhiyadyatra tajjndnam tatra kalpand II \"Wherever consciousnessapprehends a verbal object, it is conceptual.\"28 On gzhi Idog and the argument at issue, see n. 30.29 See n. 30.30 The term Idog pa (=vydvrtti) is a pivotal term in the Indian and Tibetanapoha theories of meaning; see Tillemans (1993a: 69-70, n. 6) for explana-tions and references to PV I. The fundamental idea is that the object directlydesignated by a word for Xis a conceptual construction proceeding by exclu-sion of all which is non-X As for rang Idog and gzhi Idog, these are termswhose Indian origins, if indeed they have any, seem quite obscure. The termsfigure preeminently in the bsdus grwa literature (and hence in dGe lugs papramdna commentaries) as part of a scholastic category of different sub-typesof the Indian logician's notion of vydvrtti, including also don Idog (\"exclusionqua object\") and spyi Idog (\"exclusion qua universal\"). Given their place in a"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT NONEXtSTENCE? 281literature heavily influenced by the Tshadma bsduspa texts of gSang phu tra-ditions, it is not unlikely that the interpretation of these four subvarieties ofvydvrtti, and possibly even their origin, is due to the gSang phu traditionsstemming from Phya pa chos kyi seng ge. See, e.g., the third chapter of Yongs'dzin bsdus grwa chung, the chapter concerning Idog pa ngos 'dzin \"recogniz-ing exclusions\" (in T. Kelzang and S. Onoda, eds., 1985). The argumenta-tion in Ngag dbang bstan dar turns essentially on the distinction betweenknowing an object Xas being simply an Xitself (rang), and knowing an in-stance, or basis (gzhi), of Xbut under some other name or description—thefirst case is that of rang Idog and the second gzhi Idog Thus, for example, therang /^pertaining to a vase (bumpa'i rang Idog), is just the vase and not,e.g., some particular bulbous golden object that is able to carry water—thelatter would be a gzhi Idog of vase. In the context at hand, a Buddhist and aSamkhya, when arguing about Primordial Matter, are both arguing about amere concept of Primordial Matter, i.e., a verbal object (sgra don). Nonethe-less they cannot be arguing about the rang Idog of the verbal object (sgra dongyi rang Idog) of Primordial Matter because this would mean that both knowthe verbal object to be just a verbal object, i.e., a conceptually and verballycreated fiction; clearly, the Samkhya does not know this, but thinks that Pri-mordial Matter is more than just a verbal object, because it is for him fullyreal. Thus they are both thinking and arguing about a type of verbal object,but one that both parties don't consciously recognize as such—hence the in-sistence on the subject of their deliberations being the gzhi Idog of a verbalobject. See also n. 15 on the dGe lugs pa idea of an object (like PrimordialMatter, etc.) and its conceptual representation appearing \"mixed\" ('dres nassnang ba) and hence indistinguishable to the opponent.31 Literally, \"from their exclusions qua the things themselves.\" On rangIdog, see n. 30. On the argument at stake, see n. 32.32 The point is that if we explicitly presented the subject as being somethingalong the lines of the concept of Primordial Matter, and not Primordial Mat-ter itself, we would not actually succeed in refuting Primordial Matter. Theargument would not tell against the Samkhya opponent, who is convincedthat there really is such an entity and that it is a fortiori not a mere concept.On the other hand, when we establish by means ofapramdna that the rea-son is a property of the subject (paksadharrna), then the subject can only bethe conceptual construct, i.e., only the appearance as Primordial Matter (gtsobor snang ba nyid). The argument at stake is, in effect, that both the kevala-dharmin and svadharmin have their purpose: the former assures that the refu-tation presents the subject as the opponent conceives it, while the latter isthe proponent's actual subject that will serve as the basis upon which will be"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"282  SCRIPTURE, LOGIC, LANGUAGEassessed the three characteristics of the logical reason.
