Study (or, as it is traditionally undertaken, listening) is the first of the three means to knowledge, the other two being reflection and meditation. All Buddhist practitioners engage in some form of study, though for many of those whose main interest is meditation, the formal study of philosophy, with its branch areas of epistemology and logic, seems quite unnecessary. Yet, as Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche’s foreword explicates, the sys-tematic study of the topics contained in this volume will lead us from the foundational Buddhist teachings on the four truths to the Madhyamaka of Secret Mantra, and thence to awakening.Khenpo Tsültrim teaches that there are four ways to approach the real-ization of mahāmudrā: through training progressively in the view, medi-tation, conduct, or the tantras. In the Karma Kagyu tradition, training in meditation starts with the four common preliminaries and four uncom-mon preliminaries,2 and is followed by shamatha (calm abiding) and vipashyanā (superior insight) meditations according to either a Sūtrayāna or a Vajrayāna approach. When training in conduct, the first step is to do no harm, either to oneself or to others; subsequent training in altruistic behavior may be followed by instruction in other styles of conduct appro-priate to one’s level of practice.3 To train according to the tantras is to practice the meditations of the four sets of tantra in sequence, starting with kriyā (action) tantras, charyā (conduct) tantras, yoga tantras, and finally anuttarayoga (highest yoga) tantras. Khenpo Tsültrim explains that while any of these three approaches will lead to the realization of mahāmudrā, training in the stages of the view, such as presented by Jamgön Kongtrul in this section of his Treasury of Knowledge, is the most profound way to proceed.4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 C the treasury of knowledgeJamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé and the Rimé MovementJamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé5 (1813–1900) was a Tibetan polymath: an erudite and eclectic scholar, teacher, meditation practitioner, and even a skilled political mediator when needed. Along with other luminaries of his time, such as Dza Paltrul,6 Jamyang Khyentsé wangpo,7 Chokgyur Lingpa,8 and later Ju Mipham,9 Jamgön Kongtrul contributed to the revi-talization and preservation of many lineages and traditions of Buddhist teachings in what is called the Rimé (ris med), or nonsectarian, movement. His outstanding quality as a synthesizer and harmonizer, both on a secu-lar and a religious level, is just one of the reasons for his leading role as a nonsectarian. There are many good accounts of Jamgön Kongtrul’s life and times, such as Gene Smith’s (2001) “’Jam mgon Koṅg sprul and the Nonsectarian Movement,” The Autobiography of Jamgön Kongtrul (Barron 2003), and Ringu Tulku’s (2006) The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgön Kongtrul the Great.10 Here we will look at those aspects of his thought that are most relevant to this book. The origins of the Rimé movementThe nineteenth-century Rimé movement was both a reaction to its times and a reflection of the views of its proponents. The religious climate in Tibet (which was intertwined with its politics) had become highly parti-san, and the Rimé movement was a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned. Jamgön Kongtrul and others brought to light many valuable teachings in both their own and others’ traditions, some of which had been dangerously close to being lost, and to reduce the Rimé movement to the redressing of religious power or prestige would be to undervalue its funda-mental ecumenical spirit. The Rimé masters’ contribution is not simply one of balance: it enables us to experience the rich wisdom and means found in a variety of approaches. It should be mentioned that a Rimé approach does not mix traditions. Each tradition of Buddhism in Tibet has its own meditation texts and com-mentaries, and its own approach to training practitioners. Jamgön Kongtrul and his contemporaries were concerned with preserving and promulgat-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"introduction c 11ing these traditions, each in its own right; by doing so, they ensured their availability for subsequent generations of practitioners and scholars.Jamgön Kongtrul’s influencesTwo aspects characteristic of the Rimé movement are seen in Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation of Buddhist doctrine in general and its philosophy in particular. The first is a return to emphasizing Indian sources—to fun-damentals (though not to fundamentalism)—and the other is the revival of the Shentong system and the establishment of its place in the study of Madhyamaka philosophy. As we shall see, he drew upon the works of Indian masters, from Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu to Chandrakīrti and Shāntarakṣhita. For his Shentong presentation, he relied primarily on the works of two more recent Shentong masters: the Sakya scholar Shākya Chokden11 and the Jonang master Tāranātha.12 Tibetans rely more on the Indian exegetical works than sūtras: “original” sources often means the writings of Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu, rather than the words of the Buddha found in the sūtras. One reason for this is that the great Indian masters systematized, and in that process clari-fied, the words and thought of the Buddha; and, of course, each generation usually finds recent works more accessible than the ancient texts, both conceptually and linguistically.Jamgön Kongtrul states that what became known in Tibet as Shen-tong (Extrinsic Emptiness or Empty-of-Other)13 was known in India as Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka. This stream of teachings began with the Buddha’s third turning of the dharma wheel14 and was later elucidated by Maitreya, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, and Nāgārjuna in his Collection of Praises.15 Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen16 of Jonang monastery in Tibet is generally considered to be the first to use the terms Shentong and Rangtong (Rang stong; Intrinsic Emptiness or Empty-of-Self) in an extensive way. Jamgön Kongtrul says that many Kagyu and Nyingma masters17 explain the key points of this system as the definitive meaning, specifically citing the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorjé,18 and the great Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam.19 The Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka, or Shentong, view is also an intrinsic part of mahāmudrā teachings and of the Vajrayāna. The great yogi Milarepa sang many songs that express this view, as well as songs that express its coun-terpart, Rangtong.20 The Jonang school and Shentong teachings were banned in Central and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 C the treasury of knowledgewestern Tibet during the mid-seventeenth century owing, it seems, largely to a change in political power. Its texts were sealed and their printing was forbidden, and Jonang monastery was converted to a Geluk monastery.21 Despite these restrictions, the Jonang Shentong teachings and practices continued even in Central Tibet, albeit in a reduced way, and in its fairly isolated affiliated monasteries in the eastern areas of Tibet (Amdo). During the eighteenth century, there was a revival and open reinstatement of the Shentong view within the Kagyu and Nyingma schools, which began with Kaḥ-tok Rikdzin Tsewang Norbu,22 Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné,23 and Getsé Paṇḍita Gyurmé Tsewang Chokdrup.24 Tsewang Norbu received the transmission of the Jonang teachings from Kunzang wangpo,25 a student of one of Tāranātha’s disciples, Kunga Tayé.26 Tsewang Norbu also strongly influenced the adoption of Shentong views by Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné of the Karma Kagyu school, who regarded his Shentong views to be in accordance with those of the seventh Karmapa, Chödrak Gyamtso,27 and Shākya Chokden.28 Another important contributor to the Shentong revi-talization was Shalu Ri-buk Tulku, Losel Ten-kyöng,29 who enabled the reprinting of Tāranātha’s banned works in 1874.30 In this section of his Treasury of Knowledge, Jamgön Kongtrul carries on their work, clarifying and reaffirming the place of this system within the traditionally accepted hierarchy of four philosophical schools.Jamgön Kongtrul’s literary works Jamgön Kongtrul’s prodigious literary output (over ninety volumes) is con-tained in collections known as the Five Great Treasuries,31 which comprise meditation practices, empowerments, and commentaries, as well as his own compositions. His own writings are found in The Treasury of Extensive Teachings32 and The Treasury of Knowledge, also known as The Encompass-ment of All Knowledge (see below). His collections of texts are The Mantra Treasury of the Kagyu School, The Treasury of Precious Terma Teachings, and The Treasury of Instructions.33The Treasury of KnowledgeThe work translated in Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy: A Systematic Presentation of the Cause-Based Philosophical Vehicles34 is one section of The Encompassment of All Knowledge and its auto-commentary, The Infinite"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"introduction c 13Ocean of Knowledge.35 Together these texts are often called (and hereafter will be referred to as) The Treasury of Knowledge,36 the name given to them by Jamyang Khyentsé wangpo.Although Jamgön Kongtrul began compiling the texts for The Mantra Treasury of the Kagyu School first, The Treasury of Knowledge is generally regarded as his first work. He undertook it at the request of Ngédön Tenpa Rabgyé,37 who had asked him to compose a treatise on the three vows: the Hīnayāna vows of individual liberation (prātimokṣha, so sor thar pa’i sdom pa), the Mahāyāna vows of a bodhisattva (byang chub sems dpa’i sdom pa), and the samayas, or commitments, of Secret Mantra (gsang ba sngags kyi dam tshig ’am sdom pa). Jamgön Kongtrul recounts the circumstances in his autobiography:38 Prior to this, Lama Karma Ngédön had urged me to write a trea-tise on the three levels of ordination, saying that if I did so he would write a commentary. But my feeling was that there were already any number of treatises on this subject, and that if I were to write a treatise it should be more comprehensive in scope, something that would be of use to people who had not studied much. So in the periods between my meditation sessions I had been composing the source verses to my treatise The Encompass-ing of the Knowable [or The Encompassment of All Knowledge] a treatise dealing with the three higher trainings.39 Later, I offered this to my lord guru for his inspection, and on that occasion he gave me great encouragement, saying, “This is definitely due to the blessings of your spiritual masters and the power that comes from having the ḍākinīs open up your subtle channels. we will call this The Treasury of the Knowable [or Treasury of Knowledge] the first of the five great Treasuries you will produce. Now you must write your own commentary to it.”Begun in 1863, the root text and its three-volume auto-commentary were probably completed by Jamgön Kongtrul in 1865. Certainly they were completed by mid-1867 when Jamgön Kongtrul recorded that he gave the oral transmission for the work to the Ngor master Ngawang Rinchen.40 Although it was originally intended to discuss only the three vows, this work came to be a comprehensive treatise on Buddhism, covering all areas of knowledge and interest to the Buddhist population of Tibet. It is the last"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 C the treasury of knowledgegreat Tibetan encyclopedia. Additionally—and not insignificantly—it pro-vides us with a clear picture of Jamgön Kongtrul’s nonsectarian approach to Buddhist practices and study. The Treasury of Knowledge: Style and ContentsAs befitting a compendium of this nature, The Treasury of Knowledge draws on and from the writings of both Indian and Tibetan masters. An important aspect of Buddhist scholarship is to ground one’s presentation in the works of previous masters, a tradition stretching back to the time of the Buddha Shākyamuni. Readers should bear in mind that The Treasury of Knowledge is as much a compilation as it is an original work, and this should be under-stood from the traditional Buddhist context, where reliance on scripture is not only laudable but to varying degrees mandatory; where passages may be borrowed in their entirety without attribution; and where original writ-ing—that is, something wholly self-created—is considered a fault. Growing from the original section on the three vows, The Treasury of Knowledge is divided into ten sections (gnas)—called “books” in this trans-lation series—each with four parts (skabs) of varying lengths. As we can see from the following overview, it begins with cosmology and history, moves on to survey vast and varied areas of knowledge, then discusses medita-tion practices, and concludes with sections on the path and the fruition of nirvāṇa. Each book has a theme that it discusses in its four parts from various perspectives: sometimes in terms of the Hīnayāna, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna approaches; at other times according to the different Tibetan traditions; in some cases, a section will be an in-depth look at one or more areas of the book’s broad topic.Book One: Myriad Worlds: Buddhist Cosmology in Abhidharma, Kālacakra, and Dzog-chen (1995)Part 1: The Cosmology of the Universal Way [Mahāyāna]Part 2: Our Universe according to the Individual and Universal ways [Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna]Part 3: Space and Time in the Tantra of the wheel of Time [Kālachakra]Part 4: The Causes of Cyclic Life [and the Primordial Purity of the Universe]"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introduction c 15Book Two: The Advent of the Buddha41Part 1: Our Teacher’s Path to AwakeningPart 2: The Buddha’s EnlightenmentPart 3: The Buddha’s Twelve DeedsPart 4: Enlightenment’s Bodies and RealmsBook Three: The Buddha’s Doctrine—The Sacred TeachingsPart 1: what Are the Sacred Teachings?Part 2: Cycles of Scriptural TransmissionPart 3: Compilations of the Buddha’s WordPart 4: The Origins of the Original Translations’ Ancient Tradition [Nyingma]Book Four: Buddhism’s Spread Throughout the WorldPart 1: Buddhism’s Spread in IndiaPart 2: How Buddhist Monastic Discipline and Philosophy Came to TibetPart 3: Tibet’s Eight Vehicles of Tantric Meditation Practice Part 4: The Origins of Buddhist CultureBook Five: Buddhist Ethics [The Training in Higher Ethical Conduct] (1998)Part 1: The Qualities of the Spiritual Teacher and StudentPart 2: The Vows of Personal LiberationPart 3: The Commitments of Awakening Mind [Bodhichitta]Part 4: The Vows and Pledges of Secret MantraBook Six: The Topics for StudyPart 1: A Presentation of the Common Fields of Knowledge and worldly PathsPart 2: The General Topics of Knowledge in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna Part 3: Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy: A Systematic Presentation of the Cause-Based Philosophical Vehicles Part 4: Systems of Buddhist Tantra: The Indestructible Way of Secret Mantra (2005)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 C the treasury of knowledgeBook Seven: The Training in Higher wisdomPart 1: Gaining Certainty about the Keys to Understanding Part 2: Gaining Certainty about the Provisional and Definitive Mean-ings in the Three Turnings of the wheel of Dharma; the Two Truths; and Dependent ArisingPart 3: Gaining Certainty about the View Part 4: Gaining Certainty about the Four Thoughts that Turn the MindBook Eight: The Training in Higher Meditative Absorption [Samādhi]Part 1: Shamatha (Calm Abiding) and Vipashyanā (Profound Insight)Part 2: The Stages of Meditation in the Cause-Based Approaches42Part 3: The Elements of Tantric Practice: A General Exposition of Secret Mantra Meditation Systems43Part 4: Esoteric Instructions: A Detailed Presentation of the Process of Meditation in Vajrayāna44Book Nine: An Analysis of the Paths and Levels to Be Traversed45Part 1: The Paths and Levels in the Cause-Based Dialectical Approach46Part 2: The Levels and Paths in the Vajrayāna Part 3: The Process of EnhancementPart 4: The Paths and Levels in the Three YogasBook Ten: An Analysis of the Consummate Fruition StatePart 1: The Fruition in the Dialectical ApproachPart 2: The More Common Attainments in the Vajrayāna Part 3: The Fruition in the Vajrayāna Part 4: The Fruition State in the Nyingma SchoolBooks One through Four cover Buddhist views on the world and Bud-dhist history.

Book Six—the topics for study—sits between the training in ethical conduct (Book Five) and the trainings in wisdom and samādhi (Books Seven and Eight respectively). This organization suggests that the material in Book Six is designed to provide practitioners and scholars with the understanding that they will reflect upon (aided by Book Seven) and cultivate in their meditation (as set out in Book Eight). Part One of Book Six is a presentation of what are called common fields"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"introduction c 17of knowledge (thun mong rig pa’i gnas), which are areas of learning common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists. These subjects, which include a study of valid means of cognition (pramāṇa, tshad ma), cover the tools necessary for Buddhist philosophical studies. Part Two of Book Six, The General Topics of Knowledge in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna, begins with an overview of what distinguishes Buddhism from non-Buddhist systems and then surveys the ways Buddhist yānas (theg pa, vehicles) and philosophical tenet systems (siddhānta, grub mtha’) are categorized and enumerated. Jamgön Kongtrul concludes this opening with the most well-known framework: three yānas and four philosophical systems.47 This is the framework that Part Three of Book Six, our present work, presents in some detail. Book Six, Part Three: Frameworks of Buddhist PhilosophyIn Part Three of Book Six, A Systematic Presentation of the Cause-Based Philosophical Vehicles, Jamgön Kongtrul presents an overview of the main aspects of the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna systems (leaving out the Vajrayāna segment of the Mahāyāna),48 and highlights the important points of their approaches. These are “cause-based yānas” (rgyu’i theg pa), in contrast to the “result-based yānas” (’bras bu’i theg pa), which is a common name for the Vajrayāna. As Jamgön Kongtrul says,49 cause-based yānas employ “that by which we travel,” a cryptic phrase meaning that these yānas use the causes of buddhahood as their path. Result-based paths use “where we are traveling to” as their means; that is, their method is the result itself: the wisdoms and pure appearances of buddhahood. (Result-based approaches are treated in Part Four of Book Six, Systems of Buddhist Tantra.) Speaking generally, from a Hīnayāna perspective, the causes are the renunciation of saṃsāra, the cultivation of ethical conduct, and the realization of the absence of a self of persons (pudgalanairātmya, gang zag gi bdag med). The Mahāyāna adds to that list the cultivation of the six pāramitās and the realization of the absence of a self-entity of phenomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). These yānas are also called “philosophical” (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid). The term translated here as “philosophical” in other contexts is translated as “characteristics,” “defining characteristics,” or “dialectics.” In Chapter Five of this book, Jamgön Kongtrul states that the Pāramitāyāna part of the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"1\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeMahāyāna “is called a philosophical [yāna] because it portrays (mtshon par byed pa) the path and its attributes that directly connect us to the unified state of Vajradhara, the final fruition.” Thus the term refers to these yānas’ descriptions of the characteristics that make up the path. They do this by means of categorizations and definitions, analysis and reason, rather than faith and devotion. Here, the application of the term is broad since it covers the early Buddhist schools through Madhyamaka, including the Madhyamaka character of Secret Mantra. As is the case throughout The Treasury of Knowledge, many topics simply mentioned in this volume are explained in detail elsewhere.50 In this book we find a general presentation of the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna doctrines, paths, and results with an emphasis on the specifics of their philosophi-cal tenet systems. In terms of Buddhist literature, we could say broadly that this section conforms to the genre of doxography or tenet systems (siddhānta, grub mtha’).51 In fact, this section often serves as such for the Karma Kagyu tradition these days, which makes it important not just as a general document or a reflection of Jamgön Kongtrul’s Rimé perspective, but as a textbook in a contemporary and vital tradition. Before we look at the structure and content of Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation, some back-ground and context for this work may be helpful. Doxography: An overview of shifting structures Doxography is the systematization of views, the classification of fluid lines of thought into discrete, hierarchical categories that suggest uniformity where it may not exist. It should be kept in mind from the outset that these pedagogical frameworks, into which centuries of works are placed, are the creation of Buddhist thinkers: each one is an artifact (and sometimes an artifice). They do not necessarily describe or reflect historical facts—none of the Indian teachers they categorize thought of themselves as belong-ing to any such “schools” (or even necessarily holding the views that are ascribed to them). They evolved into their present forms mainly because they were so enthusiastically embraced by Tibetan scholars. Nāgārjuna52 (ca. second century ce) was the earliest Mahāyāna philoso-pher to provide a systematic exposition of emptiness. In his Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way,53 Nāgārjuna demonstrates through reasoning"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"introduction c 19that phenomena have no nature and specifically refutes assertions held by the major abhidharma schools of his time, such as the Vaibhāṣhikas, or Sarvāstivādins.54 In doing so, he is considered to have established the Middle way, or Madhyamaka, system. Traditionally, three sets of texts are attributed to Nāgārjuna: Collection of Reasonings,55 Collection of Praises, and Collection of Advice.56 The works in his Collection of Reasonings and the texts of his student Āryadeva are considered models of Madhyamaka philosophy.57 During the fourth century, Asaṅga58 and his brother Vasubandhu59 wrote a large number of treatises, some of which comment on the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, while others amplify teachings found in the third turning of the dharma wheel, such as the three characteristics,60 ālaya consciousness, and buddha nature (tathāgatagarbha). Vasubandhu, having begun his scholastic career studying the Hīnayāna systems, wrote a major text on Vaibhāṣhika abhidharma (Treasury of Abhidharma),61 while Asaṅga wrote the Mahāyāna equivalent, the Compendium of Abhidharma.62 As a whole, their works can be seen as supplementing Nāgārjuna’s Collection of Reasonings and provid-ing a balance for any Buddhists who mistook his presentation of emptiness for a kind of nihilism. They also furnished Mahāyāna practitioners with detailed descriptions of the path and practices leading to awakening, both practical and vitally important topics (as attested by the fact that the basis for the Prajñāpāramitā studies in the Tibetan monastic colleges is one of the texts Asaṅga received from Maitreya, the Ornament of Clear Realiza-tion). Later, the works of Asaṅga and Vasubandhu were called Yogāchāra (and, in Tibet, either Chittamātra or Shentong). Dignāga (ca. fourth/fifth century) developed a Buddhist system of logic and epistemology, which was furthered by the works of Dharmakīrti in the seventh century. Until the middle of the sixth century, there is no evidence that Mahāyāna followers perceived themselves as being divided into dif-ferent schools or representing different points of view.63 The first compendium of Buddhist and non-Buddhist Indian philosophical systems was written by the great sixth-century philosopher and debater Bhā -vaviveka64 in his Heart of the Middle Way65 and the auto-commentary, Blaze of Reasoning.66 Bhāvaviveka is remembered for other firsts: he was the first to cast Madhyamaka arguments in the logical forms developed by Dignāga; perhaps the first to have used the terms Madhyamaka and Yogāchāra to refer to systems of thought; the first to criticize the views of those he calls Yogāchāras;67 and the first to “divide” the ultimate into what he called “nomi-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 C the treasury of knowledgenal ultimate” and “non-nominal ultimate.”68 Bhāvaviveka also took exception to the way Buddhapālita (early sixth century) presented the reasonings found in Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way, which later earned Bhāvaviveka the position as the founder of *Svātantrika-Madhyamaka. Although one of the most famous Madhyamaka scholars for Tibetans and a brilliant scholar, Chandrakīrti (sixth century) was probably not widely influential in India. He is most well known for his Entrance to the Middle Way,69 a commentary on the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way, in which he refutes the ideas of non-Buddhists and Buddhists. In Lucid Words,70 Chandrakīrti defends Buddhapālita’s approach and criticizes Bhāvaviveka’s critique of the latter, for which Chandrakīrti is credited with being the founder of the *Prāsaṅgika branch of Madhyamaka. The crux of the disagreement between Bhāvaviveka and Chandrakīrti is whether Mādhyamikas should or can use the formal inferences, as developed by Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, when arguing for Madhyamaka emptiness, Chandrakīrti’s position being that they should not.71By the eighth century, the presentation of four tenet systems—Vaibhā -ṣhika, Sautrāntika, Yogāchāra, and Madhyamaka—appears in works such as Āryadeva’s short Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wisdom72 and Shān-tarakṣhita’s Compendium on Suchness73 and Ornament of the Middle Way.74 This systematization continues to be found in the writings of eleventh-century Indian authors, such as Bodhibhadra,75 Jetāri,76 Maitrīpa,77 Sahaja-vajra,78 and Mokṣhākaragupta,79 with some variation and individuality. Tibetans received their first teachings on Madhyamaka philosophy from Shāntarakṣhita, who also set the tone for their approach to studying philo-sophical tenet systems. His Ornament of the Middle Way80 demonstrates the flaws of the lower Buddhist tenet systems (Vaibhāṣhika through Yogāchāra), pointing out in each case their error of reification, but it concludes:81On the basis of the Mind Alone,we should know that outer things do not exist. On the basis of the method set forth here,we should know that mind is utterly devoid of self.Those who ride the chariot of the two approaches, who grasp the reins of reasoned thought, will thus be adepts of the Mahayana,According to the sense and meaning of the word."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introduction c 21As this demonstrates, Shāntarakṣhita’s approach was to unite Yogāchāra and Madhyamaka, with the latter expressing the highest view. The impor-tance of Madhyamaka studies was confirmed for Tibetans when, following the debate between Shāntarakṣhita’s student Kamalashīla and the Chinese master Heshang Moheyan,82 the Tibetan king Trisong De-tsen83 (742–797) declared that Tibetans would henceforth follow the view of Nāgārjuna.84 It was later decreed that among the eighteen Hīnayāna orders, only the texts belonging to the Mūlasarvāstivādin (which includes the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika tenet systems) would be translated,85 which certainly accounts for the limited representation of non-Mahāyāna commentarial works in Tibetan. Attention would still be paid to the texts and doctrine of the so-called lower tenets, but often as supplemental studies. In keeping with Shāntarakṣhita’s Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka synthesis, Yogāchāra texts con-tinued to be translated and studied, along with the epistemological works by Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, and, of course, Madhyamaka texts. By the eighth century, subdivisions had already been introduced into the presentations of four tenet systems. In the above-mentioned Indian texts of this period, Yogāchāra is typically split into Proponents of Images (Sākāravādin, rNam pa dang bcas pa) and Proponents of Nonexistent Images (Nirākāravādin, rNam pa med pa).86 As Jamgön Kongtrul recounts in Chapter Seven, Madhyamaka was classified in a variety of ways by Indian masters.87 Tibetans contributed to this by creating new subdivisions, starting with the first Tibetan doxographical works written by the ninth-century trans-lators Shang Yeshé Dé88 and Kawa Pal-tsek,89 who introduced the terms Sautrāntika-Madhyamaka and Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka90 and applied them to Bhāvaviveka and Shāntarakṣhita respectively. Since these neologisms reflect the different ways these masters explained conventional reality (saṃvṛitisatya, kun rdzob bden pa), they began to be incorporated into doxo-graphical schemas during the later spreading of Madhyamaka, as evidenced by the eleventh-century Rongzom Paṇḍita Chökyi Zangpo’s91 works. A significant contribution to Tibetan Madhyamaka studies occurred in the eleventh century when Pa-tsap Lotsāwa Nyima Drak92 translated Chandrakīrti’s Lucid Words and Commentary on the “Entrance to the Middle Way,”93 and prepared a new translation of his Entrance to the Middle Way. Although Atīsha had introduced Tibetans to Prāsaṅgika and singled out Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti as the ones who had realized emptiness,94 the works of Chandrakīrti had not been studied extensively prior to the time of Pa-tsap Lotsāwa. (As mentioned earlier, Chandrakīrti was not widely"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 C the treasury of knowledgestudied in India; and the only commentary on his works by an Indian master, that by Jayānanda, was composed in the eleventh century.95) Pa-tsap Lotsāwa is credited with coining the now-famous terms Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika96 and setting in motion the propagation of Chandrakīrti’s Prāsaṅgika view, which in time became accepted as the highest form of Madhyamaka view.97 This did not happen immediately: the Svātantrika approach was favored and taught extensively by the eleventh- and twelfth-century masters such as Ngok Lotsāwa Loden Sherab98 and Chapa Chökyi Seng-gé.99 The terms Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika became more or less uni-versally adopted by the fourteenth and fifteen centuries,100 for instance by the great Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam, who used them in his Pre-cious Treasury of Philosophical Systems.101 A notable occurrence on the philosophical landscape of the fourteenth century, with far-reaching doxographical implications, was Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen’s proclamation of Shentong as the highest interpretation of Madhya-maka view. Dolpopa’s presentation of Shentong, or what he calls Great Madhyamaka, is a synthesis of the teachings found in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras,102 commentaries on the tantras (especially the Three Commentaries by Bodhisattvas),103 and the works of Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, and Maitreya. One of his main points is that the teachings of the second and third turnings of the dharma wheel104 are fundamentally in agreement, and that they teach that wisdom is empty of what is extrinsic to it (gzhan stong), not empty of its own nature (that is, intrinsically empty, rang stong). Another noteworthy point, both generally and from a doxographical point of view, is that Dolpopa distinguished between a relative Chittamātra and an absolute Chittamātra, identifying the latter as Great Madhyamaka.105 By promoting the terms Rangtong and Shentong in contradistinction and “clarifying” the Madhyamaka view, he introduced another wrinkle into the arrangement of doctrines. However, Dolpopa’s views were regarded by many as radical and were vigorously refuted, particularly by Tsongkhapa and his followers, and, starting in the seventeenth century, were effectively banned; it is not until recently that we have access to his works (and not simply to accounts of what others claim he said, embedded in their refutations of him).106 Dolpo-pa’s presentations are of utmost importance for us, since, when it comes to subdividing the four tenet systems, Jamgön Kongtrul follows Dolpopa’s main interpretation. In Chapter Seven,107 Jamgön Kongtrul states that, generally speaking, there are two types of Mādhyamikas: Mādhyamika Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāvavādins) and Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas;"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"introduction c 23these became known in Tibet from the time of Dolpopa as Rangtong Propo-nents and Shentong Proponents . Also living in the fourteenth century was Je Tsongkhapa,108 founder of the Geluk tradition. In keeping with the continued interest in Chandrakīrti’s works (set in motion by Pal-tsek and passed down to Tsongkhapa by the Sakya master Rendawa109), he emphasized Chandrakīrti’s Prāsaṅgika as the pinnacle of views. Yet Tsongkhapa introduced what some regarded as new and unfounded interpretations, including a highly debated (and debat-able) presentation of what constitutes Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika and what distinguishes them.110 In his Essence of Eloquence,111 Tsongkhapa makes a modification to the tenet system classifications that changed the course of Tibetan doxographical literature: he designates Sautrāntika-Madhyamaka and Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka as subcategories of Svātantrika-Madhya-maka,112 thus “lowering” the standing of Shāntarakṣhita and Bhāvaviveka. As controversial as Dolpopa’s views were for Tsongkhapa, some of Tsongkhapa’s own views were regarded as equally controversial by his contemporaries. Refutations of Tsongkhapa’s views are found in writings of the Sakya masters Tak-tsang Lotsāwa,113 Gorampa Sonam Seng-gé,114 and Paṇchen Shākya Chokden, as well as those of the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorjé.115 For Jamgön Kongtrul the most influential of these masters was Paṇchen Shākya Chokden, who gradually took a Shentong position in his writings, particularly once he met the seventh Karmapa, Chödrak Gyamtso. His Shentong views are not identical to Dolpopa’s116—they could be said to be more moderate—but they are one of Jamgön Kongtrul’s main sources. Eventually Shākya Chokden’s works were banned in Central Tibet117 (along with those of Dolpopa and Tāranātha). The next major figure relevant to our present work is Tāranātha of the Jonang tradition, upholder of the teachings of Dolpopa. His works are Jamgön Kongtrul’s other main source for the Shentong view. Tāranātha sets out his perspective on the four tenet systems in his Essence of Shen-tong,118 where he divides Mādhyamikas into Ordinary Mādhyamikas (dBu ma phal pa) and Great Mādhyamikas (dBu ma chen po). He states that the ordinary Madhyamaka became known in Tibet as Rangtong and is the tradi-tion of Buddhapālita, Bhāvaviveka, Vimuktisena, and Shāntarakṣhita (note the absence of Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti). Great Madhyamaka became known in Tibet as Shentong and is elucidated in the works of Maitreya, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, and in Nāgārjuna’s Praise of the Dharmadhātu.119 Tāranātha was a brilliant and prolific writer, who did much to promote"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 C the treasury of knowledgethe Shentong teachings of Dolpopa. Unfortunately, his works were banned in the mid-seventeenth century.120 The establishment of the political rule of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1642 and the subsequent rise of the Geluk school to the stature of state religion in Central Tibet resulted in lean times for the Kagyu scholastic tradition. Some of its monastic seats were converted and its monastic colleges (bshad grva) were closed.121 This, of course, interrupted its scholastic tradition, a situation which began to change only during the eighteenth century with Situ Chökyi Jungné and the subsequent flourishing of the Rimé movement in eastern Tibet.As the Geluk school developed its strong monastic base and scholastic achievements, the genre of doxography rose to the level of an art form in Jamyang Shepa’s mammoth Great Exposition of Tenets.122 written partly as a rebuttal of Tak-tsang Lotsāwa’s criticism of Tsongkhapa, Jamyang Shepa’s work in turn generated numerous supplemental texts, such as Chang-kya Rolpé Dorjé’s Beautiful Ornament of Philosophical Tenet Systems,123 Könchok Jigmé Wangpo’s Precious Garland,124 and Losang Könchok’s Clear Crystal Mirror.125 By this point, the categories have been subdivided more extensively, so we no longer simply have a schema of four philosophical tenet systems. Only the first system, Vaibhāṣhika, remains the same (though Jamyang Shepa’s explanation that they include all eighteen orders differs from Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation126 and a western academic perspective).

The drawing of lines and the making of distinctions was not only a matter of doctrinal issue in Tibet. In a land with no separation of church and state, it certainly had political aspects. Thus, the doxographical literature became not just a means to sort out the complicated array of philosophical views, but also the forum for establishing the supremacy of one’s interpretation. Nevertheless, it should be said that Tibetans were certainly commenting on and debating matters that were, and had been, of issue and contention throughout Buddhism’s long history in both India and Tibet. while this does not pretend to be a comprehensive overview of doxo-graphical works or of the issues inspiring those divisions, it should provide a sense of how the literature (and classifications) evolved over the centu-ries, sometimes in response to, and as a reflection of, doctrinal conundrums. In India, the debates between Buddhists were largely between Abhidharma followers and Mādhyamikas, or Yogāchāras and Mādhyamikas. In Tibet, with the introduction of divisions of Madhyamaka, the debates became between different “forms” of Madhyamaka: Svātantrika versus Prāsaṅgika, Shentong versus Rangtong. One thing is certain: there were never four sep-arate, monolithic philosophical tenet systems130 with which people identi-fied. Over the centuries, others applied the model backwards, sometimes categorizing someone’s works as representing a particular tenet system but not categorizing that person as espousing that view (the most famous example being Vasubandhu and the Vaibhāṣhika system).131 Nevertheless, despite the fluidity and imprecise nature of doxographical frameworks, they are useful as pedagogical tools.

Of particular interest is his organization of the tenet systems and the texts on which he bases it, both of which reveal his own view as well as his sources of inspiration.

For those with"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 C the treasury of knowledgesome background in the subjects covered here, what Jamgön Kongtrul says and what he does not may be equally interesting. Chapter One133 begins with the statement that the three yānas were taught by the Buddha Shākyamuni, whereas the four philosophical tenet systems were demarcated by the Buddha’s followers. The three yānas are characterized either in terms of the methods they employ or the intentions of their followers. Their methods are either cause-based or result-based. As mentioned above, “cause-based” means that the causes for awakening, for example, the six pāramitās for Mahāyāna practitioners, are practiced as the path. “Result-based” means that the results of awakening, the wisdoms and kāyas of buddhas, are meditated upon as the path. The three yānas can also be distinguished from the perspective of their practitioners. The term “Hīnayāna” (Lesser Vehicle) is used to refer to the yānas practiced by those whose sole aim is their own liberation, and the “Mahāyāna” (Greater Vehicle) indicates that its practitioners strive to liberate others as well as themselves. Historically speaking, the terms Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna were only used by Mahāyāna followers—no one following the teachings designated by the term “Hīnayāna,” or Lesser Vehicle, considered their approach “lesser.”134 There are, however, long-standing precedents in Buddhist history for redefining and refining terms, and these terms need not be regarded as historical relics, but may be con-sidered from the perspective of a progressive path. Of course, some Bud-dhist practitioners prefer one mode of teachings to another, and continue with it throughout their lives, while others choose to train in the yānas in a graduated manner. In the latter approach, the Hīnayāna represents the foundational teachings and practices, and as such is an essential and integral part of the path for Mahāyāna practitioners. The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche135 presents this view: The Hīnayāna, which is associated with the first cycle of the Buddha’s teaching, is translated as the “lower vehicle.” How-ever, this does not mean that the Hīnayāna is lower in quality. “Lower” refers to that which occurs at the beginning, the most fundamental part of our journey. The Hīnayāna is said to be lower than the other two vehicles136 in the same way that the foundation of a house or building is lower than the upper floors . . . M any of the other factors that affect our journey are deter-mined by how well we lay the foundation of the Hīnayāna path."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"introduction c 31If we attempt to leap right into Mahāmudrā or Dzogchen, then we are forgetting about Hīnayāna, which means we are forget-ting about our foundation . . . The foundation that we are trying to develop consists of the Hīnayāna view of selflessness, the understanding of interdepen-dent origination, and the path of revulsion and renunciation . . . When we develop a genuine understanding of suffering, renun-ciation, and the selfless nature of ego, we can properly enter the path of Mahāyāna. It is with this view in mind that the term Hīnayāna is used in these pages. The canonical sources Jamgön Kongtrul provides for the four philo-sophical tenet systems (siddhānta, grub mtha’) are both tantras: the Hevajra Tantra advises teaching the four systems sequentially, and the Kālachakra Tantra gives a symbolic account of their origins. Jamgön Kongtrul then explains that the four tenets systems137 are the outcome (grub don) of the final view (lta ba mthar thug) that individuals reach through their own intellectual analysis, thus providing us with both an explanation of the origin of the tenets systems and the meaning of this term. Within the three yāna structure, the first two yānas—the Shrāvakayāna and Pratyekabuddhayāna—are considered Hīnayāna. The Shrāvakayāna contains the first two of the four tenet systems: Vaibhāṣhika and Sau-trāntika. The third yāna, Mahāyāna, contains the last two tenet systems: Chittamātra and Madhyamaka.The four main sections of this book are the Shrāvakayāna, Pratyeka -buddhayāna, Chittamātra tenet system, and Madhyamaka tenet sys-tem. Jamgön Kongtrul’s systematic presentations of the Shrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna, and Madhyamaka cover six topics: the meaning and etymology of their names; their entryways; their vows; their views; their results; and their classifications. (Madhyamaka has a seventh topic: a syn-opsis of its ground, path, and fruition.) For his presentation of Chittamātra, Jamgön Kongtrul chose a slightly different format that begins with the meaning and etymology of the name, and then incorporates seven topics from the Compendium of the Mahāyāna:138 the source of knowable objects; the three characteristics; how to engage the import of those; the cause and result of that engagement; the unfolding; the three trainings; and the results of purification.

It is under the heading of the classifications in the Shrāvakayāna, Chittamātra, and Madhyamaka chapters (Chapters Two, and Six through Twelve) that we find the details of the four philosophical tenet systems.Shrāvakayāna Jamgön Kongtrul bases his discussion of the Shrāvakayāna (Chapter Two) on Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma and Asaṅga’s Compendium of Abhi-dharma. Most of the chapter is an analysis of the four truths for noble ones (suffering, its origins, its cessation, and the path), which are the shrāvakas’ entryway to their path and its results. Jamgön Kongtrul first treats these in general ways, discussing their essential qualities, defining characteris-tics, numbers, sequence, and etymologies, before turning to examine them individually. The truth of suffering is generalized as being of eight, six, three, or two kinds, with the threefold presentation probably being the most familiar: the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of conditioned existence. The origins of suffering are, as the Compendium of Abhidharma says, mental afflictions and defiled karma. Under the heading of the karmic ori-gins of suffering, the ten unvirtuous actions (three of body, four of speech, and three of mind) are discussed in detail: each has a basis, intention, act, and completion that are needed to fulfill the karmic path of that action. Their divisions, worst instances, and three types of results (matured results, results that correspond to their causes, and dominant results) are also pro-vided. Finally, six alternative classification schemes are given, making for a complete overview of the categories and topics related to karma. Jamgön Kongtrul introduces the truth of cessation by saying that it is the attainment of separation from stains, and then describes its nature in terms of twelve aspects presented in the Compendium of Abhidharma. Cessation is the nirvāṇa attained through the Shrāvakayāna, and it is described in a number of short sections in Chapter Two, as well as in Chapter Three’s explanations of the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika tenet systems and the classification of the result. The presentation of the truth of the path is sim-ply a list of the five paths (accumulation, junction, seeing, meditation, and beyond training), as these paths are the main focus of Part One of Book Nine. This discussion of the four truths closes with a summary of their general characteristics."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"introduction c 33The view for shrāvakas is primarily the realization of the absence of a self of persons (pudgalanairātmya, gang zag gi bdag med). As Jamgön Kong-trul recounts, some scriptures and Indian masters assert that shrāvakas (and pratyekabuddhas) also realize the absence of a self-entity of phenom-ena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med); others do not. In Chapter Ten, Jamgön Kongtrul says one of the distinctive features of the Prāsaṅgikas’ system is their assertion that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize both absences of self-entity. Chapter Two closes with a simple summary of the shrāvakas’ result, nirvāṇa. It contains some technical differences in the positions ascribed to Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas, but, simply put, their result is first nirvāṇa with the remainder of the aggregates and then, at death, nirvāṇa without remainder. (The details of the stages of the result are presented in the next chapter.)Chapter Three is an account of three ways to classify the Shrāvakayāna: according to its tenet systems, its orders (nikāya, sde pa), and the attain-ment of results. Jamgön Kongtrul states that “the Shrāvakayāna contains numerous philosophical tenets with many subtle distinctions,” but, to put this simply, it has two philosophical tenet systems: Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika. This categorization, seemingly well-established by the eighth century in India, is probably derived from the fact that these were the two dominant abhidharma schools in northern India. Jamgön Kongtrul’s obser-vation that the Vaibhāṣhikas are a subdivision of the Mūlasarvāstivādins (one of the four main orders)139 indicates that he does not regard the Vaibhāṣhikas as including or representing all eighteen orders, as other Tibetan doxographical works do.140 It is also worth noting that Jamgön Kongtrul does not divide Sautrāntikas into Followers of Scripture and Followers of Reasoning, as is commonly done in the Geluk tenet system texts. In Tibet, the primary source for the Vaibhāṣhika view is Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma. Its auto-commentary, the Explanation of “The Trea-sury of Abhidharma,” contains refutations of the Vaibhāṣhika positions and representations of Sautrāntika positions. Since the views of these tenet systems are complicated, digests like this are helpful places to start one’s studies or simply to discover the main points. Jamgön Kongtrul begins with a succinct account of the points the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika positions have in common: they do not accept the Mahāyāna scriptures as the words of the Buddha Shākyamuni; they reject the notion of a perma-nent, single self; and they posit karma as the creator. This section also lists"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 C the treasury of knowledgeother topics they agree upon, from their classifications and definitions of phenomena (encompassing forms and mind) to their presentations of the paths and results. Jamgön Kongtrul presents their views of the two truths as shared posi-tions (whereas in Part Two of Book Seven he presents their positions on the two truths separately).141 On the basis of a famous verse from the Treasury of Abhidharma, he explains that Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas consider conventional reality to be anything that can be broken down, either physi-cally or mentally, such that it is no longer understood to be that thing. If a table is broken apart, we no longer think “table” when we see the bits of wood. Thus, that “table” is only conventionally, or nominally, real. Ulti-mate reality is whatever is still cognized by a mind even when it is broken down into its individual parts.142 It is the partless particles and irreducible moments of consciousness that serve as the building blocks of conditioned phenomena and mind. Next, Jamgön Kongtrul looks at points of disagreement for Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas. The first, and possibly seminal issue, is that Vaibhāṣhikas consider seven abhidharma texts to be the Buddha’s words compiled by seven arhats, while Sautrāntikas consider them to have been composed by the seven arhats. Other points of difference are that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that, in most cases, sense consciousnesses and their objects arise simultane-ously, whereas Sautrāntikas state that they arise sequentially, that is, that an object is the cause for its corresponding sense consciousness to arise. Vaibhāṣhikas consider the phenomena of the three times to be substan-tially existent, and Sautrāntikas consider them to be mentally imputed. Sautrāntikas state that external objects are hidden and that they cast an image (ākāra, rnam pa) that is apprehended by the sense consciousness. Sautrāntikas also assert reflexive awareness (rang rig). Vaibhāṣhikas do not accept either of these two positions. Vaibhāṣhika teachers include four mas-ters whose views are cited in the Treasury of Abhidharma—Dharmatrāta, Vasumitra, Ghoṣhaka, and Buddhadeva—as well as Saṅghabhadra and Anantavarman.143 Sautrāntikas are represented by Saṅgharakṣhita and Shrīlāta, and Vasubandhu’s Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma.” The second way to classify the Shrāvakayāna is according to its orders (nikāya, sde pa). Jamgön Kongtrul bases his presentation on Butön’s History of Buddhism144 and Pawo Tsuk-lak Trengwa’s Feast for Scholars: A History of the Dharma,145 both of which reflect descriptions of the orders found in the works of the Indian masters Vinītadeva, Shākyaprabha, Bhāvaviveka,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"introduction c 35and Padma.146 The classification of the orders is looked at in three ways: as four main orders, as eighteen divisions, and as a twofold summation. Jamgön Kongtrul considers the four main orders, Mūlasarvāstivādins, Mahāsāṅghikas, Sthaviras, and Saṃmitīyas, in terms of such points as their names, lineages, and a few key tenets. The names of the eighteen orders are provided by a citation from Vinītadeva’s Compendium Showing the Dif-ferent Orders. These divisions developed for geographical and doctrinal reasons but, as a well-known sutra passage attests, each order contains a complete system of teachings that lead to liberation. Finally, the eighteen orders fall into two groups: those who propound the absence of a self of persons and those who assert an “inexplicable self [or person].” The latter, represented by the Vātsīputrīyas, “maintain that although the person can-not be described as being the same as or separate from the aggregates, or as permanent or impermanent, and so forth, it is substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient.”147 Needless to say, this view was repudi-ated by other Buddhists. The third way to classify the Shrāvakayāna is in terms of its four results: stream enterers, once returners, nonreturners, and arhats. Jamgön Kong-trul treats these four in some detail; in fact, this is his most extensive cov-erage of these four levels in The Treasury of Knowledge. Again, the primary source for the complex architecture of approachers to and abiders in the results of stream enterers, once returners, nonreturners, and arhats, and their accompanying subdivisions, is the Treasury of Abhidharma. The Com-pendium of Abhidharma has similar categories, but its classifications and definitions are somewhat different. Pratyekabuddhayāna In Chapter Four, Jamgön Kongtrul turns to the second yāna, that of pratyeka-buddhas. Pratyekabuddhas attain awakening in the periods when there are no buddhas or shrāvakas in the world. They are characterized as having a proud, independent nature, being intelligent, and possessing only a little compassion, although they do teach the dharma in nonverbal ways once they attain awakening. The systematic presentation of their yāna covers six topics: the meaning and etymology of their name; their entryway; their vows; their view; their results; and their classifications. Pratyekabuddhas enter their path and attain nirvāṇa by contemplating the four truths and the twelve links of dependent origination. Observing"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 C the treasury of knowledgethe world, they see that all things arise from causes and conclude that if causes are interrupted, their results will not arise. working their way back through the twelve links of dependent origination, they determine that if they uproot ignorance, the links following, through old age and death, will come to an end. All the traditional sources agree that pratyeka-buddhas realize the absence of a self of persons. In addition, some texts, such as Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realization,148 say that they also real-ize that perceived objects have no self-entity. However, since they do not realize that the perceiving subject has no self-entity, pratyekabuddhas are said to realize only “half” of the absence of self-entity of phenomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). There are two types of pratyekabuddhas: the rhinoceros-like and the congregating practitioner. These categories are based on their dispositions and intelligence, with the rhinoceros-like being more inclined to solitude and of greater intelligence. All pratyekabuddhas attain the same results as the shrāvakas (stream-enterer through arhat). Jamgön Kongtrul con-cludes this chapter by remarking that although many Indian and Tibetan texts do not consider the philosophical tenet systems of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas separately, they do in fact have many differences. That, coupled with the prevalence of the phrase “three yānas” in the scriptures, warrants a separate presentation for pratyekabuddhas. Jamgön Kongtrul bases this section on the Treasury of Abhidharma, Compendium of Abhi-dharma, and Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realization. This completes the Hīnayāna section.Mahāyāna Jamgön Kongtrul opens the Mahāyāna section (Chapter Five) by distin-guishing it from the Hīnayāna in terms of its view (the realization of the twofold absence of self-entity); its trainings (the six pāramitās); its relin-quishments (the afflictive and cognitive obscurations); its results (nirvāṇa that does not abide in the extreme of existence or peace); and its seven greatnesses, which are found in Maitreya’s Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras.149 Jamgön Kongtrul begins his systematic presentation of the Mahāyāna by dividing it into the Pāramitāyāna and the Vajrayāna, of which the latter is the subject of Part Four of Book Six. In his overview of the Pāramitāyāna he states that the Pāramitāyāna is the cause-based part of the Mahāyāna path that leads to the primordial wisdom of buddha-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"introduction c 37hood. In this he contradicts Tsongkhapa’s position that final awakening can only be attained through the practice of the Vajrayāna. The remainder of Chapter Five is mainly devoted to an eleven-point discussion of the six pāramitās: their essential qualities; characteristics; etymologies; divisions and summaries; pure forms; most important types; distinctiveness; ways of training; results; numerical definitiveness; and order. The primary source for this is again Maitreya’s Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras. The next major section on the Pāramitāyāna is a detailed presenta-tion of its philosophical tenet systems, which will occupy the remaining seven chapters of the book (Chapters Six through Twelve). This may be the area of most interest to Buddhist practitioners and scholars, and it is where Jamgön Kongtrul’s own views on the tenet systems are most clearly revealed. Chittamātra The Chittamātra system (Chapter Six) is treated in three parts: the mean-ing and etymology of its name, its seven bases, and its classifications (or subdivisions). The opening verse is a concise statement of one of the Chittamātras’ main tenets: they assert consciousness to be truly existent. According to Jamgön Kongtrul, this assertion distinguishes this tenet sys-tem from Shentong-Madhyamaka. He states that Chittamātras are known as Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) and Yogāchāras (Yoga Practi-tioners). It should be noted that Chittamātra is the more commonly used name for this system in Tibet, and that Jamgön Kongtrul also uses the lat-ter two names for the Shentong tenet system (Chapter Eleven).150 Whether we call it Yogāchāra or Chittamātra, the teachings associated with this tenet system are based on the sūtras of the third turning of the dharma wheel and texts by Maitreya, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu. They include a number of important topics: the eight modes of consciousness (rather than six) and the three characteristics or natures (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid). Although Jamgön Kongtrul later indicates that he does not regard Asaṅga’s teachings as Chittamātra, his summary of the seven bases, or topics, of the Chittamātra system is based on the ten topics (here con-densed into seven) discussed in the ten chapters of Asaṅga’s Compendium of the Mahāyāna. The first two topics are the source of knowable objects, which is the ālaya consciousness, and the three characteristics. The short presentation of the ālaya consciousness covers four points: the reasons for"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"3\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgepositing it; its characteristics; that its reversal is buddhahood; and that it is not a creator, single, a self, or permanent. The positing of the ālaya is integral to a Chittamātra presentation. The ālaya is the source of all we experience, which is characterized as threefold: dependent, imagined, and consummate.151The dependent characteristic arises from the ālaya consciousness, and in its impure state it is called “the imagination of what is unreal.” It is mere cognition appearing as the perceived images and the perceiving conscious-ness. It is called “dependent” because it manifests in dependence upon the force of habitual tendencies. The dependent characteristic is the basis for the designations of the imagined characteristics. Imagined characteristics are simply the names, labels, and notions that are applied to the dependent characteristic. These include the labels “big,” “small,” and notions of a self or true existence. The consummate characteristic is what exists ultimately: nonconceptual cognition empty of the duality of percepts and perceiver. Jamgön Kongtrul provides the subcategories of the three characteristics that are most well-known to Tibetans: imagined characteristics devoid of any characteristics and nominal imagined characteristics; impure and pure dependent characteristics; and the unchanging and the unerring consum-mate characteristics. The classifications section of the Chittamātra system begins with another concise statement of its tenets: Chittamātras assert that external referents have no existence apart from being mere cognition (vijñaptimātra, rnam rig tsam). They consider external referents to be like the objects experienced in dreams for the following three reasons: First, referents (that is, all appear-ances) are only mental appearances, like the spots of light we see when we press on our closed eyelids. Secondly, if external appearances were to exist, they would exist for noble beings in meditative equipoise (which contra-dicts accepted Buddhist tenets). Thirdly, the same external appearances are experienced by different beings in quite different ways: for example, water is regarded as a home by fish, and something to drink by humans. Given their assertion that appearances are simply mind and that mind (nondual cognition) is real, Chittamātras address the question of the sta-tus of these appearances, or what are called images (ākāra, rnam pa), in two ways. Some state that images are either “real” as mind, and others state that they are not; these account for the two main subdivisions of Chittamātra: Proponents of Real Images and Proponents of False Images.152 Proponents of Real Images are subdivided based on how they posit the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"introduction c 39relationship between the cognizing mind and the images. The position of those called Split-Eggists is that the perceived objects and the perceiv-ing mind are matching halves. Proponents of Perceptual Parity consider them to be in a one-to-one relationship: one consciousness for each image. Non-Pluralists say that there is only one consciousness, from which and to which many objects manifest. Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation of these subdivisions and their positions is based on Jetāri’s Explanation of “Differ-entiating the Sugata’s Texts”153 and Shāntarakṣhita’s Ornament of the Middle Way; both texts refute these positions. Proponents of False Images say that images are not real; it is the force of ignorance and its attending habitual tendencies that cause the appearance of outer images. Those who subscribe to this view consider two issues: Is the mind tainted by images? Do buddhas experience dualistic appear-ances? The two responses to these issues yield two doxographical divi-sions: Proponents of Staining False Images and Proponents of Non-Staining False Images. The first are those who state that consciousness is tainted by images and that buddhas, while not being deluded themselves, do experi-ence dualistic appearances. Those in the second category hold the positions that consciousness is not tainted by images and that buddhas do not experi-ence dualistic appearances. Jamgön Kongtrul then turns to the matter of whose works are consid-ered Chittamātra. He states that although some Tibetans consider Vasu-bandhu’s texts to be the scriptural source for the Chittamātra system, “This is simply the mistake of those who speak deviously by not distinguishing between Vasubandhu’s assertion that primordial wisdom is truly existent and the Chittamātra system’s statement that consciousness is truly exis-tent.” Under the heading, “The Masters Who Assert Chittamātra Positions,” Jamgön Kongtrul first recounts the various views of Tibetans, and then introduces his first quotation from Dolpopa. After that, with characteristic brevity, Jamgön Kongtrul states what must be taken to be his own position regarding Chittamātra: “The great exalted one of Jonang and his follow-ers maintain that Asaṅga and his brother were Madhyamaka masters and that their system of philosophical tenets is the Great Madhyamaka (dBu ma chen po).” If the texts by Asaṅga and Vasubandhu are not the source of the Chittamātra doctrine, we may wonder, who were the founding masters of the Chittamātra system? Drawing from texts by Tāranātha,154 Jamgön Kongtrul says that the founders and promulgators of the Chittamātra sys-tem were “five hundred Mahāyāna masters, great exalted ones of earlier"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 C the treasury of knowledgetimes, such as Avitarka, and others. ‘Others’ means some of their followers and some later Proponents of Mere Cognition (Vijñaptimātra).”This chapter concludes with a brief account of why the Chittamātra sys-tem is refuted by Mādhyamikas. Chittamātras assert that reflexively aware, self-illuminating cognition, or consciousness, that is empty of the duality of percept and perceiver, exists ultimately. Since this constitutes a truly existing substratum, Mādhyamikas do not accept it. This, Jamgön Kongtrul says, is the primary difference between the Chittamātra and Madhyamaka systems. Madhyamaka The analysis of the Madhyamaka system (Chapters Seven through Twelve) has seven topics: the meaning and etymology of its names; its entryway; its vows; its view; its results; its classifications; and a synopsis in terms of ground, path, and fruition. Chapter Seven covers the first five topics and begins the subject of classification by surveying the various ways in which Madhyamaka is classified in India and Tibet. These classifications are derived from the way that Mādhyamikas explain the ultimate to be empty or the way they posit conventional reality. Jamgön Kongtrul’s view is that there are two forms of Madhyamaka: Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Secret Mantra-Madhyamaka. The latter is the topic of the short but highly interesting Chapter Twelve. Sūtra-Madhyamaka is covered in Chapters Eight through Eleven. Its followers are divided into the Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāvavādins) and the Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas. Jamgön Kongtrul states that they became known in Tibet, from the time of Dolpopa onwards, as Rangtong Proponents and Shen-tong Proponents respectively. Rangtong-Madhyamaka is the subject of Chapters Eight, Nine, and Ten. Chapter Eight begins with a brief introduction to the divisions of Rang-tong, Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika, which are derived from the differences between Bhāvaviveka and Chandrakīrti. Bhāvaviveka and his followers assert as part of their own system that phenomena are empty, and they pri-marily use independently verifiable reasonings in debate. Chandrakīrti and his followers accept that phenomena are empty only from the perspective of others, and since they do not accept that there are independently verifi-able reasonings, they primarily use consequences in debate. Details of the differences between these two systems are found later in this chapter and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"introduction c 41in Chapter Nine. The majority of Chapter Eight is devoted to their shared approach to refuting the self of persons and the self-entity of phenomena through reasoning. Since reasoning is an important topic in the Rangtong system, it is treated at some length under four subheadings: the subject, object of negation, probandum, and reasons. When Rangtong-Mādhyamikas engage in debate (without differentiat-ing between whether they are Svātantrikas or Prāsaṅgikas), the subject is not something established by the valid cognitions of both the challenger and the opponent. The object of negation is only something imagined, not appearances. what is imagined is either something whose existence as a convention is negated (such as a self), or something whose ultimate existence is negated, but whose existence as a convention is not (e.g., prag-matic expressions). The probandum (what is to be proven) is a nonimplica-tive negation155 that simply refutes the reality of the subject. Reasons are formulated either as negations or affirmations, but all five reasons used by Rangtong-Mādhyamikas are, in fact, negating reasons. The five are: (1) the vajra sliver reasoning, which refutes arising from the four extremes (self, other, both, or causelessly); (2) reasonings that refute the arising of a result that either exists at the time of its cause or does not exist then; (3) reason-ings that refute arising from four possibilities;156 (4) reasonings that refute that something is a single unit or a plurality; and (5) the reason of depen-dent origination, called the king of reasonings. These are also presented again in Chapter Ten, where some are delved into more extensively. At the end of Chapter Eight Jamgön Kongtrul summarizes the Svā-tantrika and Prāsaṅgika positions. First and foremost, they do not disagree about ultimate reality. They only disagree about the way to posit conven-tional reality. There are three main areas of difference: (1) Svātantrikas either assert conventional reality according to a Sautrāntika position (that there are outer objects) or a Chittamātra position (that there are no outer objects, that objects are images of mind). Prāsaṅgikas make no assertions of their own regarding conventional reality: they simply comply with the everyday expressions that people ordinarily use. (2) Svātantrikas accept the pragmatic conventions of conventional reality as part of their own system; Prāsaṅgikas simply accept them for others, not as part of their own system. (3) In debate, Svātantrikas will establish their own position (emptiness or nonarising) and will use reasons that function by virtue of their relationship to real things, meaning reasons that are independently verifiable (svatantra, rang rgyud). Prāsaṅgikas state that they have no posi-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 C the treasury of knowledgetion. In debate, they primarily use consequences and do not accept the use of independently verifiable reasons. In his Svātantrika presentation, here and in the following chapter, Jamgön Kongtrul synthesizes positions known to be held by those who are designated as Svātantrika masters, from Bhāvaviveka and Shāntarakṣhita to the early Tibetan masters Ngok Loden Sherab and Chapa Chökyi Seng-gé. Readers should be aware that all those designated as Svātantrikas do not necessarily hold all the positions attributed to this style of Madhya-maka. Although Jamgön Kongtrul’s sources for this chapter are not certain, it seems that he has drawn much of the material in this chapter (and Chap-ters Nine and Ten) from Shākya Chokden’s Dharma Treasury.157Chapter Nine focuses on the Svātantrika system. Jamgön Kong-trul recounts again that the Svātantrika-Prāsaṅgika distinction began with Bhāvaviveka’s criticism of Buddhapālita’s way of commenting on Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way and Chandrakīrti’s defense of Buddhapālita’s approach. Bhāvaviveka advocated the use of formal inferences that have become known as “independently verifiable proof statements,” and he later came to be considered the founder of the Svātantrika-Madhyamaka. As Jamgön Kongtrul’s lengthy list of masters who embraced this system demonstrates, this approach was very popular in India from the sixth century onwards. Since its proponents differ in their assertions regarding the status of objects on a conventional level, they are categorized either as Sautrāntika-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas, meaning they accept outer objects as mere conventions, or as Yogāchāra-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas, meaning they assert that outer referents are simply con-sciousness. Bhāvaviveka is cited as the main proponent of the first division, and Shāntarakṣhita as the main proponent of the latter.Mādhyamikas’ entryway to their path and its results is the two truths. In the Svātantrika presentation, knowable objects are the basis for the classification of the two truths. Conventional reality is what exists from the perspective of a deluded mind; it is what cannot withstand rational analysis. A basis for the definition of conventional reality is a pot. Ulti-mate reality is that conventional phenomena, when analyzed, do not exist from the perspective of an undeluded mind; it is whatever can withstand rational analysis. A basis for the definition of ultimate reality is that a pot is empty of reality.Jamgön Kongtrul lists the four possible relationships between the two truths: (1) they are synonyms; (2) they are discrete in their own natures,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"introduction c 43that is, completely separate from each other; (3) they are discrete simply in the sense that their sameness is negated; and (4) they are identical in nature but are discrete isolates.158 Jamgön Kongtrul says that many Svātantrikas hold the fourth position. A distinguishing feature of the Svātantrika system is its divisions of the two truths: conventional reality is divided into cor-rect conventionality and mistaken conventionality; and ultimate reality is divided into the nominal ultimate and the final ultimate. In this twofold explanation of the ultimate, the purpose of the nominal ultimate is to account for the role of inferential reasoning in relationship to the ultimate. Jamgön Kongtrul cites Jñānagarbha’s Differentiation of the Two Truths159 as the source of these classifications. Chapter Ten discusses the Prāsaṅgika system under four headings: an account of Chandrakīrti’s system; the Madhyamaka exposition according to the works of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva, which are models for Madhya-maka; an explanation of ground, path, and result in Madhyamaka; and a synopsis of the main points of the Prāsaṅgika system. In his account of Chandrakīrti’s system, Jamgön Kongtrul demonstrates the use of four types of reasonings unique to Prāsaṅgikas. These four are: (1) inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others; (2) consequences that expose the opponent’s contradictions; (3) comparable applications of the opponent’s reasons; and (4) demonstrations to the opponent of the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum. Following the procedure outlined by Shākya Chokden, Jamgön Kongtrul applies these four to the refutation of arising from the four extremes (self, other, both, and neither), the mode of reasoning called “the vajra sliver.”In Chandrakīrti’s system, the two truths are presented as follows: Con-ventional reality is dependently originated phenomena appearing to the deluded mind because of the power of ignorance. It is defined as the object found by false seeing. The bases for this definition are, broadly, igno-rance; specifically, the ignorance of taking things to be real; and, more particularly, the ignorance present in the mindstreams of ordinary beings. Ultimate reality is the expanse of the noble ones’ primordial wisdom; what appears to an undeluded mind. It is defined as the object found by correct seeing. The basis for this definition is primordial wisdom, which directly realizes the absence of reality. Chandrakīrti’s system does not divide the two truths and makes no distinction between correct and mistaken con-ventionalities. All conventional phenomena are equal in the same way that objects in dreams and the objects in waking states are equally “real”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 C the treasury of knowledgewhen we believe them to be so, yet equally not real in terms of their actual nature. Under his second heading, “The Model Texts’ Exposition of Madhya-maka,” Jamgön Kongtrul cites the Sakya scholar Tak-tsang Lotsāwa as saying that the system of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva explains emptiness in relationship to the three phases of analysis: no analysis, slight analysis, and superb (or thorough) analysis. This brief section makes two valuable points. First, if Buddhist scriptures are looked at from the perspective of these three levels of analysis, there are no internal contradictions. Teach-ings on the aggregates and constituents (skandhas and dhātus), the meth-ods of the path, and the kāyas and wisdoms of buddhas are presented from the point of view of no analysis. Teachings that refute the existence of a self of persons and a self-entity of phenomena, and those that discuss emptiness and ultimate reality are presented from the perspective of a rational mind that analyzes slightly. The teachings that nothing exists in any way—not as something existent, nonexistent, permanent, imperma-nent, empty, not empty, or the like—reflect the perspective of thorough analysis. Secondly, these three levels of analysis provide a clear summary of the graduated approach to understanding emptiness. First, we turn away from the causes of suffering and take up what is positive, practices which require no analysis of the ultimate status of those objects. Next, by analyz-ing phenomena, we are able to counteract our belief in the true existence of our suffering, our emotions, and a self. Finally we must transcend all conceptual elaborations, even notions of emptiness.In the third section on ground, path, and result, Jamgön Kongtrul says that the ground of the Madhyamaka system is the unity of the two truths, its path is the unity of method and wisdom, and its result is the unity of the two kāyas. Of these, only the first topic of the two truths is dealt with at length. Here, the two truths are described as method and what develops from method. Conventional reality, which consists of what is commonly accepted in the world, is the method for realizing the ultimate, and, in that sense, the ultimate is what develops from method. To bring about an understanding of the ultimate, Prāsaṅgikas use five types of reasons to prove the absence of a self-entity of phenomena, and employ a sevenfold reasoning to prove the absence of a self of persons. The five reasons are presented in detail here, and the sevenfold reasoning is treated briefly as it is discussed at greater length in Part Three of Book Seven.160 The five reasonings (which are the same five discussed in Chapter Eight) are"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"introduction c 45analyzed in terms of the formulations of the reason, the subject, subject property, and entailment. Here Jamgön Kongtrul says that the Prāsaṅgika position is that these five reasonings are commonly acknowledged by oth-ers, whereas the Svātantrika system regards them as independently verifi-able reasonings. This discussion of the two truths closes with statements about the actual ultimate: The actual ultimate is beyond being an object of the intellect, and it transcends all conceptual elaborations. It is beyond the means used to cut through elaborations, and it is beyond being a position or thesis of any kind. It is simply to abide in peace, free from elaborations and reference points.The fourth, and final, part of Chapter Ten is a synopsis of the main points of the Prāsaṅgika system. First, Jamgön Kongtrul presents what he considers to be the five distinctive positions of the Prāsaṅgika system: (1) All phenomena exist only nominally. (2) All conditioned phenomena are deceptive. (3) Taking things to be real is the afflictive obscuration (not the cognitive obscuration), which establishes that shrāvakas and pratyekabud-dhas must realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena. (4) The way dharmatā is seen is the same in all three yānas. (5) Buddhas’ form kāyas and activities are simply appearances for others. Jamgön Kongtrul closes with a list of what he calls “eight uncommon theses expounded by a later generation of Tibetans.” These are Tsong-khapa’s famous, yet highly controversial, “eight difficult points of the Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka.” Jamgön Kongtrul cites Shākya Chokden’s view of these: “[We can agree] only with the words of the statement ‘Noble shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phe-nomena.’ As for the other seven points, they are philosophical tenets that Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamikas would not consider even in their dreams.”Shentong-Madhyamaka Chapter Eleven is Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation of what he considers to be the highest expression of the Sūtra-Madhyamaka view: Shentong-Madhyamaka, known prior to the time of Dolpopa as Yogāchāra-Madhya-maka. For this chapter, it seems that Jamgön Kongtrul draws exclusively from the works of Tāranātha and Shākya Chokden, either as paraphrases or direct quotations (sometimes without attribution). The scriptural sources for Shentong-Madhyamaka are the five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya161 and the commentaries on these by Asaṅga and Vasubandhu, which were"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 C the treasury of knowledgetransmitted in two streams. The general philosophical tenet system of the first three treatises—the Ornament of Clear Realization, Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras, and Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes—was transmitted by a lineage originating with Dignāga and Sthiramati. The uncommon philosophical tenet system of the last two treatises—the Dif-ferentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature and Highest Continuum—was transmitted orally in India, and passed to Tibet through the translators Zu Gawé Dorjé162 and Tsen Kawoché.163 The Tibetan mahāsiddha Yumo Mikyö Dorjé,164 a forefather of the Jonang tradition, established this latter trans-mission as a system of standard texts. As mentioned before, Jamgön Kong-trul considers that the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorjé, and the Nyingma master Longchen Rabjam explain the key points of the Shentong teachings as the definitive meaning. Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen “proclaimed the lion’s roar of Shentong-Madhyamaka,” setting out his views on Shentong in a clear and definitive manner. Significant contributions to the transmission of the Shentong teachings were made by Shākya Chokden and Tāranātha in the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries respectively. As has been the case with the other philosophical tenet systems, the teachers named as representatives of the Shentong system do not present all points in the same way. Jamgön Kongtrul addresses one of these differences by presenting the views of both Shākya Chokden and Dolpopa on the categorization of the five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya, and in doing so he also establishes the rationale for why all five treatises are considered Madhyamaka. (Other Tibetan scholars classify these five treatises in various ways, from all being Chittamātra to some being Rangtong.) The detailed explanation of the Shentong system covers three topics: the two truths; the way Shentong is not the same as Chittamātra; and the way Shentong and Rangtong differ. The presentation of the two truths is a long passage from Tāranātha’s Essence of Shentong (though not so attributed), in which the two truths are discussed within the framework of the three char-acteristics. It begins with the first two verses of Maitreya’s Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes. In his explanation of these verses, Tāranātha demonstrates how conventional reality (the imagined and dependent char-acteristics) and ultimate reality (the consummate characteristic) transcend the extremes of nihilism and permanence. Tāranātha describes the three characteristics: Imagined characteristics include nonentities (such as space), the objects that appear to our thoughts,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"introduction c 47and all the things that are conceptually imputed by the mind (big, small, good, bad, and so on). The dependent characteristic is mere consciousness that manifests as the entities of percept and perceiver. The consummate is reflexive awareness, self-illuminating and free from conceptual elabo-rations; it is known variously as dharmatā, thusness, and the ultimate. Imagined and dependent characteristics are equal in that they do not really exist, that they are delusive appearances, and that they are conventionali-ties and false. They are not, however, identical: imagined characteristics do not exist even on a conventional level, whereas the dependent do exist on a conventional level. The consummate characteristic does not exist con-ventionally and does exist ultimately; thus it really exists.Tāranātha next turns to how each of the three characteristics exists, is empty, and is an inherent absence (niḥsvabhāva, ngo bo nyid med pa). These explanations are found in the Sūtra Unraveling the Intention,165 Mai-treya’s Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras and Differentiation of the Middle and Extremes, and Vasubandhu’s Thirty Verses.166 Imagined characteristics are imputedly existent; they are the emptiness of the nonexistent; and they are the inherent absence of characteristics. Dependent characteristics are substantially existent; they are the emptiness of the existent; and they are the inherent absence of arising. The consummate characteristic exists without conceptual elaborations; it is ultimate emptiness; and it is the ultimate inherent absence. Tāranātha then addresses questions that might arise regarding the consummate nature: If the consummate nature is truly existent, does it exist as something that comes or goes? Is it singular or is it a plurality? He replies that if it had any such characteristics, it would not really exist. The consummate nature is, in terms of its own nature, not something that arises or ceases—it is free from conceptual elaborations. It is permanent, partless, and omnipresent. Here, Jamgön Kongtrul adds that the Shentong presentation of the topics related to the ground (the two truths), the path (the pāramitās, five paths, and ten bhūmis), and the result (buddhahood with its kāyas and wisdoms) are for the most part in accord with the Chittamātra system. The second topic in this chapter is the ways in which the Shentong sys-tem is free from the defects of the Chittamātra system, specifically that of the Chittamātra Proponents of False Images. (Some Tibetan scholars regard the Shentong system as being nothing more than that of the Chittamātra Proponents of False Images.) Jamgön Kongtrul provides a simple statement of their differences: Chittamātra Proponents of False Images assert that the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"4\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeālaya consciousness truly exists, for which they are considered to be Real-ists. Shentong Proponents assert that primordial wisdom, which transcends consciousness and is free from elaborations, truly exists. Since primordial wisdom is not a conditioned phenomenon, they are free from the mistakes that characterize Realists. The third topic is how Shentong differs from Rangtong and other points. First, Jamgön Kongtrul says that the Shentong and Rangtong systems do not differ in the way they determine all conventional phenomena to be empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaborations cease during meditative equipoise. These two system only differ in the way they use conventional expressions in their exposition of their philosophical tenet systems. As a conventional position, Shentong Proponents say that the consummate characteristic, or dharmatā, exists, and Rangtong Propo-nents say that it does not exist. Shentong Proponents state that nondual primordial wisdom is truly established at the time of final analysis by means of reasonings that analyze for ultimacy, and Rangtong Proponents do not make such assertions. The Shentong position is that ultimate reality is not simply a nonimplicative negation—that is the way the imagined and dependent characteristics are empty. For them, the ultimate is primordial wisdom, which is empty of the duality of perceived and perceiver. Other points in this part include another lengthy quotation from Tāranātha’s Essence of Shentong, answering critics of the Shentong position on sugata-garbha (buddha nature).In the final section of this chapter Jamgön Kongtrul makes two recom-mendations. The first and most important is that we should understand that the system stemming from Nāgārjuna and the system originating with Maitreya and Asaṅga are both Madhyamaka, and that we should appreciate each for its specific contribution to the exposition of the Buddhist path. As Shākya Chokden says, the presentations of the ālaya and the three modes of emptiness (that is, the ways in which the three characteristics are empty), which are found in Asaṅga’s texts, are necessary to explain topics found in the tantras, such as the bases for purification and the means of purifica-tion. The explanations of the way nondual primordial wisdom is empty of a nature, which are found in the Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika texts, are needed to eliminate any reification of wisdom. The second point we should keep in mind is that Tāranātha and Shākya Chokden stress the need to distin-guish between Chittamātra and Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins). For both these points, Jamgön Kongtrul quotes two passages from Shākya"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"introduction c 49Chokden’s works, first his Great Path of the Nectar of Emptiness,167 followed by his Establishing the Unity of the Definitive Meaning.168 Secret Mantra-Madhyamaka Chapter Twelve is a pithy exposition of the Secret Mantra-Madhyamaka found in the tantras and their commentaries. Since the Madhyamaka found in Secret Mantra (Vajrayāna) emphasizes nondual primordial wisdom, it accords most with Shentong-Madhyamaka; nevertheless the Rangtong expression of Madhyamaka is relevant to, and necessary for, Vajrayāna practice. In this chapter, Jamgön Kongtrul shows how the Rangtong and Shentong modes relate to the two phases of Vajrayāna practice, the genera-tion and completion stages. Generation stage practice involves imagining deities and their maṇḍalas. The practice of the completion stage is to remain within primordial wis-dom. Each stage has two aspects, for which either the Rangtong or the Shentong expression of Madhyamaka is more profound. The first aspect of generation stage practice is the ground for the arising of the deities. Shentong-Madhyamaka explanations clarify how the seed syllables and emblems (from which the deities manifest) arise within emptiness and are expressions of nondual primordial wisdom. The second aspect of gen-eration stage practice is that these deities manifest without conceptual elaborations. Rangtong-Madhyamaka teachings are most useful for under-standing this. In terms of the completion stage, first we must let go of any fixations on the generation stage by dissolving the visualization of the deities and maṇḍalas and resting without reference points. The Rangtong approach is most effective for this phase. However, simply resting without reference points is not the actual completion-stage wisdom. The second aspect of completion stage is the actual completion-stage wisdom: the pri-mordial wisdom of connate great bliss. This is described in the Shentong-Madhyamaka teachings. Jamgön Kongtrul concludes by saying that Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Man-tra-Madhyamaka do not differ in terms of the object of their realization, which is freedom from elaborations. They are distinguished only from the perspective of the mind and its qualities of realization. The book closes with a summary of all Madhyamaka systems in terms of the ground, path, and result and their transcendence of the two"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 C the treasury of knowledgeextremes. Ground Madhyamaka is the union of the two truths. The Madhyamaka view of the two truths is free from the extreme of nihilism because it accepts that, on a conventional level, appearances manifest due to interdependent causes and conditions. It is free from the extreme of permanence because its view of the ultimate does not involve any conceptually elaborated extremes. Path Madhyamaka is the union of wisdom and merit. In the cultivation of these, Madhyamaka practitio-ners avoid the extreme of nihilism by amassing merit out of their com-passion for others, and they avoid the extreme of permanence by not reifying wisdom. Resultant Madhyamaka is the union of the two kāyas. It lies beyond the extreme of nihilism because of the manifestations of the form kāyas (nirmāṇakāya and sambhogakāya), and it is beyond the extreme of permanence because of the dharmakāya, which is beyond all conceptual elaborations.

The refutative method identifies and refutes flawed positions, while a more reconciliatory mode is syncretic in emphasizing the strengths of each philosophical system and incorporating them into a broad picture of philosophical endeavor. The syncretic approach is characteristic of many of the great Indian Buddhist teachers, from Asaṅga to Shāntarakṣhita, and the masters of the Kagyu tradition, such as Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé, Situ Chökyi Jungné, and Jamgön Kongtrul in the present volume. Refutation offers clarification of subtle and profound points, and is vital to the tradi-tion at certain times (as was the case when Nāgārjuna wrote his Fundamen-tal Treatise on the Middle Way). It is also more apt to appeal to scholars. The syncretic approach taken here by Jamgön Kongtrul is one well-suited for scholar-practitioners: those who seek awakening through the combination of analytical inquiry and meditation.Having presented the progressive stages of view in this volume, in Book Eight, Part Two, Jamgön Kongtrul discusses the meditations of the cause-based philosophical yānas, concluding with a succinct summary of meditation as practiced in the two Rangtong-Madhyamaka systems and Shentong-Madhyamaka. The following verses from that section outline a progressive approach to meditating on emptiness, showing how the study of the view and the practice of meditation as found in the tenet systems result in the realization of mahāmudrā."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 C the treasury of knowledge[Mahāyāna practitioners] primarily [meditate] upon the meaning of madhyamaka.

The complexity and concise nature of The Treasury of Knowledge requires that the translator either possesses a thorough knowledge of the topics, or that she (or he) receive explanations from living scholars of the traditions rep-resented, and supplement those with textual research. This translation has been prepared by the latter method, for which I am indebted first to Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, whose teachings on this book I heard over twenty years ago. Secondly, I have had the invaluable and tireless help of Āchārya Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen, a learned scholar of the Karma Kagyu tradition. Following that, I have read, as much as time and resources permitted, the texts from which Jamgön Kongtrul either drew his presentations or directly quoted, as well as the related commentaries on quoted texts. This has proved to be illuminating, and revealed the vastness of the topics that are the subject of Jamgön Kongtrul’s succinct exposition. These sources are named in the bibliography and the endnotes, which also include some discussion of difficult or controversial points. Since many of the subjects con tained in this volume are found in the works of western scholars, refer-ence has been made to other works in English to which interested readers may turn for more details on a particular topic.

In this volume, I have cho-sen to use the Sanskrit for some technical terms as well as the major yānas and school names, rather than introduce possibly new translations. Many technical terms are followed by the Sanskrit or the Tibetan to facilitate identification, and a trilingual glossary is provided. Given the highly tech-nical nature of the subjects discussed here, accuracy and precision have been the foremost concern. Many of the notes should provide readers with the understanding and information that Jamgön Kongtrul presumed his audience to possess; however, exhaustive annotation is simply not possible (it would require an additional volume, at least). Numerous points or key terms simply mentioned in this volume are discussed or defined in other sections of The Treasury of Knowledge; some of these have been noted and cross-referenced, but a thorough cross-referencing must await the comple-tion of this translation series. The text translated in Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy consists of root verses, an outline, and commentary. Following this introduction, the root verses are presented with the outline. Since root verses are often studied on their own and memorized, the outline is included to aid such an approach. The main body of this book (root verses, outline, and commentary) has been divided into chapters by the translator, and each chapter opens with its section of outline. Throughout this book any text found in brackets has been added by the translator, including bracketed subheads. The complete outline with page references may be found in the appendix. Tibetan words are transliterated according to the Turrell wylie system with the modification that the head letter is capitalized in proper nouns. For Sanskrit the following modifications are used: ṛi, ch, sh, and ṣh rather than ṛ, c, ś, and ṣh (although cch is used for cch, not chchh). Reconstructed Sanskrit is indicated on first instance and in the glossary with an asterisk. Acknowledgments This translation is the result of the vision and generosity of many people.

T HREE Y ĀNAS AND F OUR T ENET S YSTEMS• • • •I. A General Statement• • • •The systematic presentation of the cause-based philosophical yānas, or vehicles, begins with two parts: a general statement; and the specific divi-sions. A General Statement [I]The three yānas of Buddhism were expounded by the Victor.The four philosophical tenet systems are the outcomeof the final view [reached] by individuals through their own intellectual processes. Our Buddhist tradition170 is renowned for its three yānas and four systems of philosophical tenets. Among these, the three yānas171 are what the Vic-tor [Buddha Shākyamuni] presented as his teachings; they are also what the victors who appeared earlier in this excellent aeon taught, and what the victors who will appear later will teach. Generally, it is well known that a “yāna”172 is [a form of transport] such as an elephant with its load; the term also carries the sense of that which is traveled on (bgrod par bya ba) while it bears its load. Accordingly, the means for traveling (bgrod par byed pa) to the supreme state while carrying the burden of benefiting ourselves and others is designated as a “yāna.” Furthermore, [the yāna that employs] that by which we travel (’dis bgrod"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"\u00184 C the treasury of knowledgepa) [as its method] is referred to as a “cause-based path”; and [the yāna that uses] where we are traveling to (’dir bgrod pa) [as its method] is “a result-based yāna.”173 Also, the yāna that involves the greater burden of the welfare of both ourselves and others is designated as the Mahāyāna; the yāna that involves only the lesser burden of our own benefit is designated as the Hīnayāna.174 The four philosophical tenet systems are described in Secret Mantra175 as follows. The Glorious Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra] states in its section on a gradual progression based on view:176 Teach them the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika [systems].Explain Yogāchāraand, after that, Madhyamaka. The Primordial wisdom chapter of the Kālachakra Tantra177 says that the four philosophical tenet systems arise from the four faces of the Bhagavat. Their names are mentioned simply for symbolic purposes; the tantra does not present them in terms of a threefold exposition of ground, path, and result, as it does for the three yānas. (The four Vedas178 are also said to arise from the four faces of Kālachakra;179 however, that does not mean that they were the Buddha’s exposition.)The four systems of philosophical tenets were set forth by individu-als who appeared after the Teacher [Shākyamuni Buddha] and who were founders of particular chariot-systems. Therefore, the philosophical tenet systems are the outcome (grub don) of the final view (lta ba mthar thug) that individuals [reach] through their own intellectual analysis. For this reason, the omniscient Rongtön the Great180 explains:As for the meaning of “philosophical tenet”:181 it is the outcome of thorough analysis, which individuals who are engaged in investigating what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected [arrive at] through their particular orientation (’dod pa). The meaning of the term signifies that what is established (grub pa) through the scriptures and reasonings of a particular system is not surpassed [for followers of that system]."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"SECTION I: HĪNAYĀNA"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"2.

It is not, however, that the four truths include all knowable objects (jñeya, shes bya), because they do not include four types of phenomena: space, nonanalytical cessation, impure thusness, and completely pure worldly realms.The sequence of the four truths, which are the objects, are presented according to the order in which they are comprehended by the perceiving mind.

Finally we conclude that meditation on the undefiled path, which is the method for [attaining] that [cessation], must be practiced, in the same way that we would take an efficacious medicine. This is stated in the Highest Continuum:194Just as an illness must be identified, its cause eliminated,well-being attained, and medicine taken,so must we identify suffering, abandon its causes, recognize cessation, and practice the path. Their Etymologies [d]In terms of their essence, each is undeceiving; thus they are said to be truths. The commonly [applicable explanation is that] in terms of their essence, each of the four aspects [of the four truths] is true and undeceiving (mi bslu ba). Therefore, when the natures of those [truths] are seen just as they are, an unmistaken state of mind (phyin ci ma log pa’i blo) occurs. This is why they are called “the truths of noble beings.”195 Their individual etymologies are given in the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma”:196Because it has the character of being distressful, it is suffering . . . Since it is the source, it is the origin . . . Because it is the disintegration of the aggregates, it is cessation . . . Since it refers to the journey, it is the path.The Individual Explanations of the Four Truths [2]In this section, there are four parts: the truth of suffering, what is to be understood; the truth of the origins of suffering, what is to be relinquished; the truth of cessation, what is to be attained; and the truth of the path, what is to be practiced."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 C the treasury of knowledgeThe Truth of Suffering, What Is to Be Understood [a]This has two divisions: ascertaining its nature; and the categories [of suf-fering] and their abridgement in terms of their nature.Ascertaining Its Nature [i]The nine levels within the three realms (which are the places where beings take birth)and the beings who take birth there are of the nature of the truth of suffering. The Compendium of Abhidharma says:197 What is the truth of suffering? It is understood through the lives of sentient beings and the places where they are born. The three realms divided in terms of their mental states, make nine levels (bhūmi, sa): (1–4) four levels of the form realm, which are the four meditative concentrations (bsam tan bzhi); (5–8) four levels of the formless realm, which are its four spheres;198 and (9) one level of the desire199 realm, which is similar throughout. These worlds (the inanimate environments) are the places where sentient beings take birth. They and the beings living there (who are the animate inhabitants) should be understood to be of the nature of the truth of suf-fering.The Categories [of Suffering] and Their Abridgement in Terms of Their Nature [ii]In terms of their nature, [sufferings] can be condensed into eight, six, three, or two [categories].Sufferings are classified in terms of their natures in the following ways.200"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 95Eight [Sufferings]The four types of suffering in relation to the internal [that is, your body] are birth, aging, sickness, and death. The three types of suffering in rela-tion to external things are encountering unpleasant things, being separated from what is attractive, and not being able to obtain what you desire despite your efforts. The [Compendium of] Abhidharma states:201 In brief, the five appropriated aggregates are suffering.Accordingly, there is the one suffering of negative propensities,202 which serves as the cause for all [the other kinds of suffering]. Those are the eight. Six [Sufferings]Those eight can be reduced to six. Since three—aging, sickness, and death—are related to changes in age, health, and vitality, they are counted as one: the suffering of change. When that is added to the remaining five, there are six. Three [Sufferings]Those can be further abbreviated into three. (1) Of the eight kinds of suffering, the four of birth, aging, sickness, and death, plus the fifth of encountering what is unpleasant have the characteristic of being phenomena that are experienced as suf-fering. Thus, they are the suffering of suffering (sdug bsngal gyi sdug bsngal). (2) Two—being separated from what is attractive and not being able to obtain what you desire despite your efforts—are characterized by being changeable phenomena that are initially experienced as plea-surable. Therefore, they are the suffering of change (’gyur ba’i sdug bsngal). (3) The five appropriated aggregates, which involve negative pro-pensities, are not liberated from pleasure or pain and are linked to what is impermanent. Since they exist that way and are not pleasurable, they are the suffering of conditioned existence (’du byed kyi sdug bsngal)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 C the treasury of knowledgeTwo [Sufferings]The eight kinds of suffering can be condensed into two. The first seven are so easy to understand that even worldly beings recognize them to be suffering. Because they are the objects of such [minds], those seven are suf-fering according to conventional truth.203 The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” says:204 Immature beings are like the palm of the hand:they do not recognize the hair of the suffering of conditioned existence. Noble ones are like the eye:they are greatly disturbed by that hair. The eighth type of suffering is difficult for worldly beings to understand, but those who have transcended the world know it to be suffering. Since it is the object for their minds, it is suffering according to ultimate truth.205The Truth of the Origins of Suffering, What Is to Be Relinquished [b]This has two divisions: an overview; and the extensive explanation.An Overview [i]The truth of the origins of suffering consists of the mental afflic-tions and defiled karma. The [Compendium of] Abhidharma states:206 What is the truth of the origins of suffering? It is the mental afflictions and the karma that develops under the influence of the mental afflictions. The mental afflictions (desire and the others) and defiled karma, which is driven by those mental afflictions, serve as the origin of suffering. Thus they are called “the truth of the origins [of suffering].”"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 97The Extensive Explanation [ii]This is discussed in two parts: the origins of suffering in terms of the men-tal afflictions; and the origins of suffering in terms of karma.The Origins of Suffering in Terms of the Mental Afflictions [aa]This has three topics: the causes of the [afflictive] origins of suffering; the nature [of the afflictive origins of suffering]; and the classifications [of the afflictive origins of suffering].The Causes of the [Afflictive] Origins of Suffering [1]Subtle proliferators, observed objects, and incorrect mental engagement are the causes. The Treasury of Abhidharma says:207 The causes of the mental afflictions are complete [when]the subtle proliferators have not been abandoned,their objects are present, and the mind engages incorrectly. Mental afflictions arise based on the following three conditions:(1) Their causal conditions (rgyu’i rkyen) are [present as long as] their seeds, “the subtle proliferators”208—which are that [mental afflic-tions] mature from subtle [propensities] in a way that is magni-fied—have not been eliminated. (2) Their object conditions (dmigs rkyen) are the presence of things that are attractive, unattractive, and so forth.(3) Th eir dominant conditions (bdag rkyen) are incorrect mental engage-ments, such as considering unpleasant objects to be attractive ones. The Nature [of the Afflictive Origins of Suffering] [2][The afflictive causes of suffering] are mental events character-ized by a pronounced lack of tranquility."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"9\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgewhenever something arising within the mind involves distraction, mistak-enness, agitation, torpor, recklessness, or a lack of restraint, it is charac-terized by a pronounced lack of tranquility. Because they arise from such [causes], the function, [or activity, of those mental events] is to make the mindstream very unpeaceful.The Classifications [of the Afflictive Origins of Suffering] [3]The motivating forces are the root mental afflictions, the second-ary ones, and the views.There are six root mental afflictions.209 They are also counted as ten, since one, views, is divided into five types.210 There are also twenty secondary mental afflictions,211 which, although they do not create mental afflictions in the same way that the root ones do, are capable of creating mental afflic-tions that are subsidiary to those [root ones]. Their defining characteristics are as described earlier.212Generally speaking, all mental afflictions are origins of suffering, which means they are causes that are the source of suffering. Nevertheless, igno-rance is the fundamental, root cause of saṃsāra. Then what about the explanation in the [Compendium of] Abhidharma and other places that crav-ing (tṛiṣhṇā, sred pa) is the origin of suffering?213 Craving is described in that way because it is what immediately impels us into our next existence and is the principal cause that links us with our next birth. This accords with the Commentary on Valid Cognition:214Although lack of awareness is the cause of existence,that is not stated; it is craving that is named. It is the cause because it impels.Karma [is also not stated as the cause] because it is what comes next.Thus it is that ignorance acts as the cause. Craving, being the linking fac-tor, is the motivating force and the origin of karma.

It is always a mental act. (2) The result of intentions (bsam pa) is the motivating force that occurs while the action generated by those intentions is performed.

(2) The intention (bsam pa) is being aware of that [other being] in an unmistaken way [with the intent to kill].

Killing is categorized as three: (1) killing out of desire, such as craving for meat;(2) killing out of anger, such as vindictiveness; and(3) killing out of bewilderment, such as offering a sacrifice.The most evil form of killing is to kill your father if he is also an arhat. Stealing(1) The basis is things owned by others, objects dedicated to the three jewels, the wealth of nonhumans, and the like.

[The Results of Unvirtuous Actions]Those [nonmeritorious actions produce] three kinds of results. (1) Matured results (rnam smin gyi ’bras bu) refer to the fact that major results can mature from minor causes. In cases where the results do not match their causes in all regards [e.g., a result is experienced for a long time even though its cause was brief], the expression “matured karma” (smin pa las) is used. Furthermore, when an unvirtuous action is impelled by a strong motivation or done often, the result will be birth in the hells. when done with an intermediate motivation and frequency, it will result in birth as a hungry ghost. when done with a lesser degree of motivation and frequency, it will bring rebirth as an animal.Secondly, there are results that correspond to their causes; and thirdly, there are dominant results that come to fruition even for beings in the higher realms.(2) Results that correspond to their causes (rgyu mthun gyi ’bras bu) are of two kinds: (a) [resultant] actions that correspond to their causes and (b) [resultant] experiences that correspond to their causes. (2a) [Resultant"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 C the treasury of knowledgeactions that correspond to their causes] are those actions which one natu-rally enjoys doing from the time of one’s birth and which one is compelled to do because of one’s previous actions. (2b) [Resultant experiences that correspond to their causes] are described in the Precious Garland:227Having killed, your life will be short. Having injured others, you will be greatly harmed. Having stolen, you will be materially impoverished. Having committed adultery, you will be [plagued by] enemies. Having lied, you will be disparaged. Having spoken divisively, you will be separated from your friends. Having used harsh language, you will hear unpleasant things. Having spoken meaninglessly, your words will not be honored.Covetousness will destroy your hopes. Malice will create fears.Wrong views [create] negative views.(3) Dominant results (bdag po’i ’bras bu) mature environmentally. The same text says:228 Externally, there will be little affluence and many dangers, swirling dust, smells, and [extreme] highs and lows [in the terrain], salt plains, and erratic [seasons];harvests will be minimal or nonexistent.As for when those results will ripen, the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” provides this quotation:229 whatever is heaviest in the cycle of karma will mature first.Next will be what is close, followed by what you are habituated to,and finally by what you did in previous [lives]. Engaging in those ten unvirtuous actions yourself is not the only way to complete a karmic path. When [a group of people have] a similar intention and activity—such as is the case with a group of soldiers—if one person"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 107commits the act of killing, the karmic path will be completed for all those in that gathering. The Treasury [of Abhidharma] states:230 Because armies and the like have the same aim,all will have [the karma] of the one performing [the act]. This is certainly the case for the following as well. Bands of robbers, ban-dits, and others, who unite for the sake of stealing, [will experience] simi-lar [results]. Anyone who causes someone else to commit one [of the ten unvirtuous actions] (with the exception of the three unvirtuous actions of mind) will complete the karmic path [of that action]. It is also taught that those who rejoice in [the negative actions] done by others will be tainted by a corresponding karma, and that those who rejoice in the virtue engaged in by others will obtain roots of virtue. When those actions are considered in terms of the mental afflictions (i.e., whether they are committed with aggression, desire, or bewilderment), or in terms of their frequency (i.e., whether they are done innumerable times, many times, or just a few times), or in terms of their object (i.e., whether they are done in relation to supreme, middling, or inferior beings), they are said to cause rebirth as a hell being, hungry ghost, or animal. This is summarized in the Precious Garland:231Desire, aggression, stupidity,and the karma they generate are unvirtuous. From unvirtuous actions, suffering and all lower states arise.The ten unvirtuous actions are committed in some form by the beings in the desire realms, with the exception of the beings in the hells and Unpleasant Sound.232 In the higher realms [the form and formless realms], there are no unvirtuous actions. Also when a chakravartin233 appears in the other continents of humans,234 the ten unvirtuous actions are not evident owing to the force of his merit. Meritorious Karma [bb]Meritorious karma is summarized in this quotation from the same text:235"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"10\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeNot killing, giving up stealing,refraining from [sexual engagements] with others’ spouses;restraining oneself from speaking falsely, divisively, harshly, or meaninglessly;being without attachments or malice,and renouncing views of nihilistsare the ten positive paths of action. As is stated, the [ten] meritorious actions are the intention to renounce tak-ing life through the intention to give up wrong views. Meritorious karma does not only involve [being free from] the mental afflictions, it must also include the four other aspects of basis, intention, act, and conclusion. These actions become distinguished when we go beyond, for example, simply not killing by committing ourselves to that with a vow, by protect-ing living beings, and by employing the means to extend the longevity of others. Such distinctions apply to the rest of the virtuous actions. we should know that these actions bring about matured results, results that accord with their causes, and dominant results, and that they manifest correspondingly pleasurable [results], which are the direct opposites of the unpleasant results of the ten unvirtuous actions. [The results of] these actions also differ according to whether their object is higher or lower and the frequency of their occurrence, as described above. This is summarized [in the Precious Garland]:236The opposites of desire, aggression, stupidity,and the karma they generate are virtuous.From virtuous actions, happy statesand enjoyments in all lifetimes arise. Stable Karma [cc]Stable [or unmoving] karma (mi g.yo ba’i las) is referred to as such because its maturation does not occur [or “move” to] anywhere but its originating states [which are the form and formless realms].237 It is a state of equipoise and is not disturbed [or “moved”] by the faults of lower states.

Since [the Buddha’s] teachings and the treatises treat the topic of karma and its results extensively, there are many ways it is categorized. The main ones are (1) th e classification of karma in terms of the four combinations of impe-tus and completion (’phen rdzogs);(2) th e classification of karma in terms of the speed of its maturation (rnam smin myur bul);(3) the classification of karma in terms of whether it is performed and stored (byas bsags) or not; (4) the classification of karma in terms of its strength (stobs che chung);(5) the classification of karma in terms of its mode of appearance (snang tshul); and(6) the classification of karma in terms of whether it is of a similar type (rigs mthun) or not.It is on the basis of the causal karmic origins [of suffering] that there is the resultant suffering and [beings] take rebirth in the three realms. To state this in a way that is easy to understand:(1) [The classification of karma in terms of its impetus and completion] is fourfold.240(a) The driving impetus may be a positive action, but if the complet-ing action is negative it will result, for example, in one becoming an impoverished human being."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 C the treasury of knowledge(b) The action that is the driving impetus may be negative, but if the completing action is positive the result will be circumstances such as those of the wealthy nāgas.241(c) If both the action that is the impetus and the completing action are negative, states such as the hells will be experienced. (d) when both the action that is the impetus and the completing action are positive, the results include that of a chakravartin.(2) [The classification of karma in terms of the speed of its maturation] is threefold:242 (a) “Karma experienced in this life”: Karma propelled by a strong intention and activity, and done in relation to a supreme object, will ripen in the same lifetime. For example, the karma Devadatta243 accrued by attempting to poison the Bhagavat with his fingernails produced the fires of hell at that very moment. (b) “K arma experienced in the next life” is the experience of the maturation of an action in the life immediately after this lifetime. The five acts of immediate consequence244 and the five secondary acts of immediate consequence245 are examples of this type of karma. (c) “K arma experienced in a succession of other lives” means that the experience of the maturation of an action can occur during three lifetimes [after the action was done] up to hundreds or thousands of lives later.(3) [The classification of karma in terms of whether it is performed and stored or not]: Taking positive karma as an illustration, “performed and stored” would refer to making offerings to the three jewels with faith. “Not performed but stored” would be to rejoice in other’s vir-tuous actions. “Performed but not stored” would be the recitations of a distracted mind. Actions neither performed nor stored are easy to understand. we should know that these distinctions apply in the case of negative actions as well.(4) [T he classification of karma in terms of its strength]: generally, if one does something that should be avoided, it will impel a result. The action of a remedy, however, is stronger because antidotes have the power to transform [karma]."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 111(5) [The classification of karma in terms of its mode of appearance] is twofold:(a) The karma related to shared appearances (snang ’gyur thun mong ba’i las) is that the appearances of the world, or environment, and all the beings living there manifest uniformly owing to the shared quality of [sentient beings’] accumulated karma. (b) The karma related to unshared experiences (myong ’gyur thun mong min pa’i las) is that [beings have] unique pleasurable or painful experiences of different places, bodies,246 and posses-sions. These are created by the karmic appearances of individual sentient beings. (6) [T he classification of karma in terms of whether it is of a similar type or not is threefold:](a) “Both are positive”: in the case of offering to the guru with faith, since both the intention and the activity are a similar type—posi-tive—the path of virtuous karma is completed. (b) “B oth are negative”: in the case of taking life with the intent to kill, since both the intention and the activity are a similar type—negative—the path of unvirtuous karma is completed.

Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas [respectively] assert it to be a nonimplicative negation that is substantially established or that is not so established."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 C the treasury of knowledgeThe attainment247 of separation from stains brought about by meditating on the path is referred to as “cessation” (nirodha, ’gog pa) or “thusness” (tathātā, de bzhin nyid). Vaibhāṣhikas assert that cessation is a nonimplicative nega-tion248 that is substantially established (dravyasiddha, rdzas su grub pa), and that it is a mere refutation equal in number to what is negated. Sautrāntikas assert that cessation is a nonimplicative negation that is not substantially established, in which, owing to antidotal meditation, the factors to be aban-doned have become like a rainbow disappearing in the sky. Ascertaining the Nature [of Cessation] [ii]The nature [of cessation] is [described by its] twelve aspects: its characteristics, profundity, and so forth. The nature of cessation is described in the [Compendium of] Abhi-dharma:249what is the truth of cessation? The truth of cessation can be known through a description of its characteristics, profundity, conventional representation, ultimacy, incompleteness, com-pleteness, absence of ornamentation, ornamentation, remainder, and absence of remainder, exalted state, and synonyms.The nature of cessation is discussed extensively in terms of its twelve aspects, but here I will simply explain what is essential. (1) How is cessation presented through its characteristics (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid)? Its characteristics are as follows. Cessation is dharmatā, thusness. The undefiled path [leads to] cessation. It is the cessation, or nonarising, of the mental afflictions, the factors to be abandoned. Those are [respectively] the ground where ces-sation occurs, the methods by which cessation occurs, and the factors to be stopped, which are what cease. In brief, cessation is that, within the naturally pure dharmadhātu, by meditating on the path, adventitious stains cease. (2) How is it profound (gāmbhīrya, zab pa)? • Cessation cannot be said to be something that is other than the disintegration of all defiled formative forces (’du byed zag bcas), an implicative negation (ma yin dgag), and an entity (dngos por"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 113’gyur pa), because if it were something other than those [that is, something separate from those], there would be no connection between a phenomenon and its dharmatā [its reality].250 • Cessation cannot be said to be something that is not other [than or separate from phenomena], because those [phenomena and dharmatā] do not have the same defining characteristics. If they did, cessation would be an afflictive phenomenon. • Cessation cannot be said to be both [a phenomenon and its dharmatā], since both [the just-mentioned] faults would apply. • It cannot be said to be neither of those: since [cessation] is what is intuitively cognized (so so rang gis rig par bya ba), it is not absolutely nonexistent. • why is it that cessation cannot be described in any of those ways? It is because the truth of cessation is the expanse (dby-ings) in which all conceptual elaborations related to those four possibilities are absent. (3) How is it conventionally represented (saṃvṛiti, brda)? A cessa-tion in which the seeds of the factors to be abandoned have been restricted or suppressed by the paths of worldly beings is itself simply designated as a cessation, and is considered to belong to the category of cessation. Since [such cessations] are branches, or aspects, of complete cessation (ma lus par ’gags pa), they are taught to be nirvāṇa. (4) what is ultimate cessation (paramārtha, don dam)? It is a cessa-tion in which the seeds of the factors to be abandoned have been destroyed by the wisdom of noble beings (who have transcended the world), and in which those seeds will not re-arise. (5) what is an incomplete cessation (aparipūri, yongs su ma rdzogs pa)? It is the cessation of noble beings in training, and refers to any of the following: • the cessation of all factors to be abandoned by the path of see-ing, which is the result of stream enterers; • the cessation of the six factors to be abandoned during the path of meditation that pertain to the desire realm, which is the result of once returners; or • the cessation of all the factors to be abandoned during the path of meditation that pertain to the desire realm, which is the result of nonreturners."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 C the treasury of knowledge (6) what is a complete cessation (paripūri, yongs su rdzogs pa)? It is the cessation [attained by] noble beings beyond training when all fac-tors to be abandoned are exhausted. This is the fruition of arhats. (7) what is unornamented cessation (niralaṃkāra, rgyan med)? It is the cessation of arhats who, through their wisdom,251 are liber-ated from only the afflictive obscurations (nyon sgrib) but are not adorned with supercognitive abilities or any similar qualities. (8) what is ornamented cessation (sālaṃkāra, rgyan dang bcas pa)? It is the cessation of arhats who are liberated from both the afflictive obscurations and the obscurations to absorption (snyoms ’jug gi sgrib pa). Such arhats possess the six supercognitive abilities,252 the three knowledges (knowledge of the process of death and rebirth, of previous and later lives, and of the exhaustion of defilements), and the eight excellent qualities.253 (9) what is cessation with remainder (sheṣha, lhag bcas)? It is a cessa-tion in which there is the remainder of the five aggregates (which are the matured [result] of previous [karma]) in the case of beings of the desire or form realms and four aggregates in the case of beings of the formless realm. [These continue to be present] as long as [the arhats] remain in their [present] life, even though they have abandoned all their mental afflictions. (10) what is cessation without remainder (asheṣha, lhag med)? It is a cessation in which aggregates [resulting from] matured [karma] do not remain because [the arhats] have passed from this life and have relinquished all their mental afflictions. (11) what is its exalted state (agra, khyad par du ’phags pa)? It is the ces-sation that is the nirvāṇa that does not abide in either the extreme of existence or of peace. This is [attained] by buddhas and bod-hisattvas through their wisdom and compassion, and [is exalted] because it is the source of ultimate benefit for all sentient beings and the source of their temporal happiness. (12) what are its synonyms (paryā̄ya, rnam grangs)? It has many syn-onyms: complete relinquishment, definite relinquishment, puri-fication (byang bar gyur pa), exhaustion (zad pa), freedom from desire, cessation, complete peace, and disappearance (nub pa).Thus it is said [in Asaṅga’s Compendium of Abhidharma].254"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 115The Truth of the Path, What Is to Be Practiced [d]The path is that which, once embarked upon, takes you to your goal. It comprises the five paths: accumulation, junction, seeing, meditation, and beyond training. The nature of the path is that, once it is relied or embarked upon, it is the method that enables you to attain your goal of nirvāṇa. Although the path is classified in many ways in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna, we should know that all [the classifications] are contained in the five paths: the path of accumulation (saṃbhāra mārga, tshogs lam), path of junction (prayoga mārga, sbyor lam), path of seeing (darshana mārga, mthong lam), path of meditation (bhāvanā mārga, sgom lam), and path beyond training (ashaikṣha mārga, mi slob pa’i lam). A detailed exposition of these paths is found in the later section describing the path.255 The Presentation Summarizing the General Characteristics [of the Four Truths] [3]This section is discussed in four parts: suffering; its origins; its cessation; and the path. Suffering [a][Suffering is] impermanent, suffering, empty, and without a self-entity. The truth of suffering is summarized by four general characteristics. It is(1) impermanent (mi rtag);(2) suffering (sdug bsngal); (3) empty (stong pa); and(4) without self-entity (bdag med pa).256It is said, “Everything conditioned (saṃskṛita, ’dus byas) has the charac-teristic of being impermanent. Everything impermanent is characterized by being suffering. All suffering has the characteristic of being empty. whatever is empty has the characteristic of being without a self-entity.”"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116 C the treasury of knowledgeYogins and yoginīs should investigate [the truth of suffering] using these four points. The etymologies or meanings of the terms for those four are found in the Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:257 Because [suffering] depends on conditions, it is impermanent. Because it has the character of being distressful, it is suffer-ing. [Suffering] is empty since it is discordant with the view of “mine,” and it has no self-entity since it is discordant with the view of a self-entity.when these four aspects are fully comprehended, they are the remedies for the view [that suffering is] permanent, pleasurable, something that belongs to you, and something that has a self-entity. Its Origins [b][The origins of suffering are] causes, origins, strong producers, and conditions. The general characteristics of the origins [of suffering] are that they are(1) causes (rgyu);(2) origins (kun ’byung);(3) strong producers (rab skye); and(4) conditions (rkyen).258we should understand the following about these points:(1) Karma and mental afflictions are characterized as being causes, because they are enabling causes259 that plant the seeds of the habit-ual tendencies that will produce future lives in cyclic existence. (2) They have the characteristic of being origins, because they are enabling causes that are the source of the six states of sentient beings, gods and the others. (All of these states have their respective manifestations and similar attributes, [which are caused by] their accumulated karmic tendencies.) (3) They have the characteristic of being strong producers, because they are enabling causes that definitely give rise to specific, discrete mindstreams;260 that give rise to different kinds of beings, types of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 117birth, and so forth; and that give rise to the Pinnacle of Existence,261 the highest state of beings [in saṃsāra]. (4) [Karma and mental afflictions] have the characteristic of being con-ditions, since they are enabling causes for obtaining bodies [that is, rebirths] previously not attained and for leaving already obtained bodies. The etymologies for those four are given in Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:262[Origins] are causes in the sense of being phenomena that are seeds. They are origins in the sense of being phenomena that are sources. They are powerful producers in the sense of being con-nectors, and they are conditions in the sense of being creators of the actual [result]. These [work together] in the same way that a pot can be produced when a lump of clay, stick, wheel, rope, and water are assembled. [Knowledge of] these remedy the wrong views [of thinking that suffering] has no cause, that it has only one cause, that it is a transformation of a causal [entity], and that it is a planned occurrence [i.e., something created by an all-powerful creator].Its Cessation [c][Cessation is] cessation, peace, goodness, and definitive release. The general characteristics of cessation are that it is(1) cessation (’gog pa);(2) peace (zhi ba);(3) perfection (gya nom); and(4) definite release (nges ’byung).263we should understand the following about these points:(1) Cessation is the characteristic of being separated from all mental afflictions, which are the causes of suffering. (2) Peace is characterized by the separation from suffering, that is, from the appropriated aggregates [and] formative forces (saṃskāra, ’du"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"11\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgebyed), which create an unpeaceful state. (3) Perfection has the characteristic of purity since it is free of the men-tal afflictions, and the characteristic of being happiness since it free from suffering. (4) De finite release has the characteristic of being permanent since it will not revert, and the characteristic of being the foundation of benefit for others since, ultimately, it is what is virtuous.The etymologies of those four are described in the Explanation of the “Trea-sury [of Abhidharma]”:264It is cessation because it is the disintegration of connections, since it is without any connections. It is peace because it is free from the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena.265 It is perfection since it is virtuous. It is a definite release because it is a supreme state of confidence. By meditating on these four, we will definitely emerge from the incorrect views of thinking, “There is no liberation”; “Suffering is liberation”; “The bliss of the meditative concentrations is perfection”; and “Liberation is not lasting.”The Path [d][The path is] a path, suitable, effective, and what brings definite release.The general characteristics of the path are that it is(1) a path (lam);(2) suitable (rigs pa);(3) effective (sgrub pa); and (4) what brings definite release [from saṃsāra] (nges par ’byin pa).266we should understand the following about these points:(1) [The meaning of] “path” is established by its linguistic root, as it is said: [Sanskrit] mārga means “to seek.”267"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 119 Thus, the path is characterized as being the means for seeking and realizing the dharmadhātu. (2) “Suitable” is its characteristic of being the antidote for mental afflic-tions, which are unsuitable. (3) “Effective” is its characteristic of initiating the realization of such-ness (tattva, de kho na nyid) and producing an unmistaken mind, having reversed mistaken [ideas], such as taking conditioned phe-nomena to be permanent. (4) “Bringing definite release” is its characteristic of leading to the last-ing state of nirvāṇa, which is unconditioned and permanent. The etymologies of those four are presented in the Explanation of the “Trea-sury [of Abhidharma]”:268It is a path in the sense that it is what is traversed. It is suitable because it is appropriate. It is effective in the sense that it actu-ally produces [the result of nirvāṇa]. It brings definite release because it brings true transcendence [of suffering]. Meditating on these four is the antidote for views involving mistaken anal-ysis in which one thinks, “There is no path,” “This path is bad,” “Some-thing else is the path,” and “This path also can be reversed.”These descriptions of the four truths are topics of knowledge common to all yānas. Some of the categorization is derived from the Compendium [of Abhidharma]. In his [Jeweled] Tree,269 Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen270 discusses in detail that, overall, the Compendium [of Abhidharma] is to be considered a Sautrāntika text.The Vows to Be Guarded [iii]The vows, that which are to be guarded, are the discipline of individual liberation, [motivated by the wish for] definitive release. In the two Shrāvaka schools and the Pratyekabuddha[yāna], the vows to be guarded consist of the ethical conduct of individual liberation (prātimokṣha, so so thar pa). These vows are motivated by the wish for"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120 C the treasury of knowledgedefinite release [from saṃsāra] and involve the intention, and its congru-ent [mental events], to avoid harming others and the basis [of that harm]. This has already been explained in detail.271 The explanations of the way the congruent [mental events] operate in the context of those [vows] differ in the higher and lower abhidharma [systems].272The View to Be Realized [iv]The view is primarily the realization of the absence of a self of persons. The view for shrāvakas is primarily the realization that a self of persons (pudgalātman, gang zag gi bdag) does not exist. The self of persons imputed by tīrthika practitioners to be permanent, single, clean, a creator, or inde-pendent does not exist. The mind that takes such a self of persons to exist is confused, because it is a mind [perceiving] something that is not there, like someone taking a striped rope to be a snake. The aggregates are not the self of a person, because they are imperma-nent, multiple, and unclean. They are also not a creator because they are under the power of other things. There is also no self of a person apart from the aggregates, because “person” (gang zag) is [only] used to refer to the continuity of the aggregates, which are filled with (gang) and degener-ated by (zag pa) causal karma and mental afflictions. This accords with the statement in the Treasury [of Abhidharma]:273 No self exists—there are just aggregates.[No self of persons exists apart from the aggregates,] because the mind that apprehends a self of persons comes into being when it observes the mere continuity of the aggregates. In this root verse the term “primarily” is used for the following rea-son. Texts such as the Sūtra on the Heavily Adorned Arrangement274 and the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra275 teach that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). Their view is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not directly comprehend [the nonexistence of a self-entity of phenom-ena] through meditation. On the other hand, some [texts] explain that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do realize both [absences of self-entity]."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: an overview and the four truths c 121Their view is that the attentiveness [developed] during study, reflection, and familiarization assists shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas in abandoning the mental afflictions experienced in the three realms. Consequently, some Tibetan scholars say that the view of Nāgārjuna and his son [Āryadeva] is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena, and the view of Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu] is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not real-ize this. These scholars maintain that they [i.e., Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva] assert that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize both absences of self-entity.276 The Result to Be Attained [v]Nirvāṇa is a nonarising, unconditioned phenomenon. Vaibhāṣhikas assert that it is an implicative negation and Sautrāntikas that it is a nonimplicative negation. [Nirvāṇa] with remainder [is divided into] eighty-nine conditioned and unconditioned [results],or into four results; [nirvāṇa] without remainder is the severing of continuity. In all three yānas the result to be attained is the same: nirvāṇa. Here, however, this is a nirvāṇa that is a cessation. The essence of nirvāṇa is described [by Chandrakīrti] in his Commentary on the “Sixty Verses on Rea-soning” as follows:277 Nirvāṇa is the nature of an entity [with] defining characteristics (i.e., the very essence of a form and so forth) that does not arise again owing to the absence of its causes and conditions, or karma and mental afflictions.The shrāvakas’ assertion [regarding nirvāṇa], as stated earlier,278 is that, among conditioned and unconditioned [phenomena, nirvāṇa] is an uncon-ditioned [phenomenon].Kashmiri Vaibhāṣhikas say that there are three types of unconditioned phenomena,279 and Magadha, or Central Indian, Vaibhāṣhikas assert that there are four types by adding thusness. Among those four, Clarifying the Sage’s Thought280 explains that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that [nirvāṇa] with"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 C the treasury of knowledgeremainder is an analytical cessation and [nirvāṇa] without remainder is a nonanalytical cessation, and Sautrāntikas assert that the absence of mental afflictions is an analytical cessation and the absence of the aggregates is a nonanalytical cessation. The Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]” comments that although these schools agree that [nirvāṇa] is uncondi-tioned, they differ in that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that it is an implicative negation and Sautrāntikas assert that it is a nonimplicative negation.281 The meaning of their [positions] is that Vaibhāṣhikas say that [nirvāṇa] exists substantially (dravya-sat, rdzas su yod pa), thereby asserting that [nirvāṇa] is an existent entity (dngos po yod pa). Sautrāntikas say that it does not exist substantially, thereby asserting that [nirvāṇa] is not an existent entity.In this presentation of [nirvāṇa] with remainder and without remainder, [nirvāṇa] with remainder means that all mental afflictions have been aban-doned, but the continuity of the aggregates has not been severed. It [is divided into] eighty-nine conditioned [results] and eighty-nine uncondi-tioned [results],282 or the four results of shrāmaṇas.283 [Nirvāṇa] without remainder is that when an arhat has relinquished all mental afflictions, the formative forces are cast aside and the continuity of the aggregates is severed. Thus, not even a trace of a remainder of suffering or aggregates is left, like a candle flame dying out. Both Shrāvaka schools assert that once arhats die, their awareness does not have any link with a subsequent life [i.e., does not take birth again]."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"3.

This section has three main parts: the classifications of its philosophical tenet systems; the classifications of its orders; and the classifications of its results.The Classifications of Its Philosophical Tenet Systems [aa]This has two parts: the actual classifications; and a description of their assertions.The Actual Classifications [1][The Shrāvakayana’s] philosophical tenet systems are either Vaibhāṣhika or Sautrāntika. The Shrāvakayāna contains numerous philosophical tenets with many subtle distinctions, having been formulated [on the basis of] the specific philosophical positions [taken by various] individuals. Nevertheless, for simplicity’s sake, two divisions are made: Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika.284 [In his Commentary on the “Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wis-dom,”] the elder (sthavira) Bodhibhadra285 says:Because they state that [the phenomena] of the three times exist as discrete particular substances (rdzas kyi bye brag),286 they are referred to as such [that is, as Vaibhāṣhikas, Proponents of Par-ticular (Substances)]. Alternatively, because they make state-ments in accord with the Great Detailed Exposition,287 they are"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 125referred to by that [name: Vaibhāṣhikas, Proponents of the Great Detailed Exposition].Among the orders (nikāya, sde pa), they are a subdivision of the Mūla-sarvāstivādins.288 From the same source:289Since they accept sūtras such as the Six Doors and Excellent Con-duct290 as literal and follow those sūtras, they are Sautrāntikas (Sūtra-followers). They are also known by the name of Dārṣhṭāntikas (Exemplifiers),291 since they are skilled in teach-ing through examples.A Description of Their Assertions [2]This is discussed in two sections: their similar assertions; and their dis-similar assertions.Their Similar Assertions [a]They agree in not accepting the teachings of the Mahāyāna scriptures. They reject a permanent, single self and state that karma is the creator. Both Shrāvaka schools agree that the Mahāyāna scriptures, which comprise the middle and final teachings of the wheel of dharma, are not the words of the Victorious One, and thus they do not accept them. They say that the Mahāyāna scriptures contradict the four principles of the dharma292 for the following four reasons: The Mahāyāna teaches (1) that the sambhogakāya is always present; (2) that bodhisattvas proceed to happiness; (3) that there is a supreme self, as in such statements as, “the supreme self, which is no-self, is attained”; and (4) that after shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have entered [nirvāṇa] without remainder, they must be roused [from that state] to then become buddhas. Shrāvakas say that the Mahāyāna is not found within the eighteen orders of the Buddha’s teachings and, therefore, is not a part of [the Buddha’s teachings]. Also, the Mahāyāna teachings are not part of the three collec-tions of scripture (tripiṭaka, sde snod gsum), because they do not appear in"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 C the treasury of knowledgethe common vinaya, do not fit within the sūtras, and contradict dharmatā [reality]. • Since the Shrāvaka schools do not consider the self-entity of phenomena or cognitive obscurations, they do not discuss the two types of absence of self-entity or the two obscurations.293 • Since they do not posit an ālaya294 or an afflictive mind, they do not speak of eight modes of consciousness. • Since they do not accept the extensive collection of the Mahāyāna sūtras, they do not assert the ten bhūmis,295 which appear in the Mahāyāna sūtras. • They believe that the bhūmi of a buddha has a remainder of karma and suffering and do not accept that all flaws are exhausted [in that state]; thus, they do not assert a transformation.296• Since they do not accept that the sambhogakāya [forms of buddhas dwell] in Akaniṣhṭha, they do not assert or accept the three kāyas, four primordial wisdoms,297 and so forth. In the context of the bases (mūla, gzhi), neither school accepts, even on a conventional level, the self [of persons] imagined by non-Buddhists as being permanent, single, independent, and so forth, just as [they would not accept that] a striped rope is a snake. They assert that the environment and beings have no external creator, such as Cha or Īshvara;298 they state that karma is the creator, as is said:299The myriad worlds arise from karma.They concur in their presentations of the categories of the five aggregates, the eighteen constituents, the twelve sense spheres, the four modes of birth, the five kinds of beings, and the four kinds of food (coarse, of con-tact, mental, and of consciousness).300 [Phenomena and the Two Truths]Observed objects either increase defilements or do not.Thus conditioned phenomena are defiled phenomena; and the phenomena of the truth of the path and unconditioned phenomena are undefiled phenomena.[Conventional reality] is whatever halts its perceiverwhen it is destroyed or eliminated."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 127[Gross] entities and continuities are conventionally existent and ultimately do not perform functions. Partless particles and instants of mind, which do not so halt,are ultimately existent and perform functions.[The Shrāvaka schools] also agree on the main points regarding knowable objects, which are bases (gzhi’i shes bya): the way of positing defiled and undefiled phenomena301 and the way of positing the two truths. [Defiled phenomena] are what cause [mental] defilements (āsrava, zag pa), or mental afflictions, to increase and endure when a mind with desire cognizes and observes the nature of those phenomena. [Defiled phenom-ena cause mental defilements] by way of being observed objects (dmigs pa) or being [the mind and mental events, which] are congruent in five ways.302 [Undefiled phenomena,] when observed, are what do not cause [mental defilements] to increase. Thus all conditioned phenomena, other than those included in the truth of the path, are illustrations (mtshan gzhi) of defiled phenomena; and the phenomena of the truth of the path and unconditioned phenomena are illustrations of undefiled phenomena.The way of presenting the two truths303 is given in the Treasury [of Abhi-dharma]:304Something that is no longer engaged by a mindwhen physically destroyed or mentally broken downexists conventionally, like vases or water.Everything else exists ultimately. Conventional reality [is defined as] any phenomenon which is such that if it is physically destroyed or broken down into different parts by an elimi-nating mind (sel byed kyi blo), the mind perceiving it is halted.305 Gross entities (such as the environment and its inhabitants) are false because they involve directional parts and because the mind can eliminate them [by separating them] into different parts. [Temporal] continuities (such as years, months, and days), which are imagined [to exist] in the three times, are not real since they can be divided into parts. All convention-ally existent [phenomena] (kun rdzob yod pa) are ultimately unable to perform functions. Ultimate reality is that which does not halt the mind perceiving it"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"12\u0018 C the treasury of knowledge[even] when it is broken down into parts.306 It consists of (1) minute par-ticles that truly exist (bden par grub pa) as the building blocks of things since they have no directional parts; and (2) the instants of the inner per-ceiving mind that exist as the building blocks of the temporal continuity [of mind]. All ultimately existent phenomena are capable of performing functions ultimately.307The reason vases and so forth are conventionalities is that ultimately they are unable to perform functions. This is because, if one’s position is that an object ultimately able to perform a function from its own side is a phenomenon, or referent, that intrinsically (rang gi mtshan nyid la) produces an unmistaken perceiver of itself, then those vases and so forth are conventionalities since the mind [perceiving them] relies upon inner contributory aspects, such as symbols, [to perceive them]. Thus it is said.They agree for the most part about the way conditioned phenomena arise and about the paths and results.Generally, [Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas] agree that the definition of mind is that which apprehends simply the essential nature of an object, and mental events are what apprehend just the distinctive features [of an object]. They also are in agreement about the way conditioned phenomena arise, about which they state the following:• The element-derivatives308 of forms arise from the elements.• The substances of cognitions (shes rig gi rdzas) arise in conjunction with the five congruent aspects.309• The entities of [the formative forces] not associated [with forms or mind]310 arise from forms or minds, which are “that which bear a state”311 (gnas skabs can).In terms of the paths and their results, they agree• on the main points of the illustrations and defining characteristics of the four truths, which are either objects to be adopted or to be rejected;312 • that, in terms of the subjective agent, there are five paths—accumula-tion, junction, seeing, meditation, and beyond training; • on the enumeration of four pairs of beings, also called eight kinds of individuals;313 and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 129• on most aspects of relinquishment and realization.They are in agreement about the way [the Buddha] first developed bodhi-chitta, in the middle phase increased his stores [of merit and wisdom], and in the end became a buddha. They agree that in his last lifetime in cyclic existence when, as a prince, he was to accomplish his aim, he was an ordinary being on the path of accumulation and fully fettered (’ching ba kun ldan), even though he had perfected his stores of merit and wisdom during three incalculable [aeons].314They do not assert that the Buddha awakened in Akaniṣhṭha, but rather that this occurred in front of the bodhi tree. At dusk, he tamed the thirty-seven million hordes of Māra. Then, on the same seat, at dawn he attained all the relinquishments and realizations—having progressed from the path of junction to the attainment of the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defile-ments] and their [subsequent] nonarising315—solely by means of the path of realizing the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others). Prior to his awakening, the Buddha received key instructions on the worldly meditative concentrations from Arāḍha-kālāma and Udrako-rāmaputra,316 and through his practice of the absorptions of the sphere of Nothingness and the sphere of Neither Discrimination Nor Nondiscrimina-tion, he became separated from passion. Thus the Buddha was free from passion prior to becoming a buddha. They mostly agree on the presentation of the relinquishments and real-izations for the twenty types of saṅgha317 and on the way someone can regress from the attainment of relinquishments and realizations, with a few minor exceptions.318 Their presentations of the excellent qualities of the four samādhis, the four formless states, and the four immeasurables are the same. They assert that the truth of suffering is [experienced] on the bhūmi of a buddha, meaning that the Buddha had matured aggregates that were impelled by previous karma and that he had a remainder of defiled karma.319 They share the belief that the three types of nirvāṇa without remainder—which are [the fruitions attained by] shrāvakas, by pratyekabuddhas, and by buddhas—are the severing of the continuity of cognition (rig pa rgyun chad pa), just like [the extinction of] a fire when its wood is exhausted."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 C the treasury of knowledgeTheir Dissimilar Assertions [b]This has two parts: Vaibhāṣhikas’ assertions; and Sautrāntikas’ assertions.Vaibhāṣhikas’ Assertions [i]Points of dissimilarity are that the Vaibhāṣhikas assert that the seven [abhidharma] texts are [the Buddha’s] words;that there are partless, discrete particles with interstices between them;that when of similar types, [such particles] perform the same activity, and that they are like [grasses in] a meadow;that sense faculties see referents, and consciousnesses apprehend those [referents];and that in most cases, percepts and perceivers, as causes and results, arise simultaneously. Specific points of disagreements between the Vaibhāṣhikas’ and Sautrāntikas’ systems of philosophical tenets are found in abundance throughout the Treasury [of Abhidharma]. I will now summarize the Vaibhāṣhikas’ posi-tions in a general way. Vaibhāṣhikas make the following assertions:• The seven abhidharma texts320 are compilations of teachings actually contained in sūtras that were extracted by individual arhats, just as was done with the Collection of Meaningful Expressions.321 Thus, the seven abhidharma treatises are [the Buddha’s] words (vachana, bka’).• Since the collection of dharma—the scriptures and so forth—is a series of words, it is included within the category of non-associated formative forces.322• Everything included with the category of forms is either an element or an element-derivative, or is composed of minute particles. • when minute particles form gross phenomena, a middle particle is sur-rounded by particles of the six directions; and yet, partless discrete particles (rdul phran cha med sil bu) have interstices, or empty spaces, between them. Minute particles are substantially established (dra vya -siddha, rdzas su grub pa). [When they are] of similar types, they perform the same activity. They are like [the hairs in] a yak’s tail or [grasses in]"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 131a meadow. Although discrete minute particles remain separate, they do not disintegrate because they are held together by karma or wind. Coarse phenomena are also drawn together in one direction by the wind that holds those [partless particles] together.323• As for the way consciousnesses apprehend objects: sense consciousnesses apprehend their respective objects nakedly and immediately without an [intermediary] image,324 like pliers [taking hold of] a lump of iron. Once a sense faculty sees the actual object (don gyi rang mtshan), a conscious-ness apprehends it. Vaibhāṣhikas assert that in most cases percepts and their perceivers, as causes and results, arise simultaneously, because a consciousness cannot be produced by something past or future.[Vaibhāṣhikas] maintain that the five bases, [the phenomena of] the three times, and nirvāṇa exist substantially;that unconditioned phenomena are permanent, and the truth of cessation is an entity;that consciousnesses are aware of what is other; and other points.The basis [of their system] was delineated by the four great ones and others in reliance upon scriptures. • The five bases of objects of knowledge,325 [the phenomena of] the three times, nirvāṇa, and, particularly, non-associated formative forces—which are referents (don) that are other than “that which bear a state” to which states are ascribed326—are substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient (rang rkya thub pa’i rdzas yod).327• They assert the three kinds of unconditioned phenomena328 to be per-manent. Furthermore, since they are incapable of positing knowable objects that are not established by way of their essence (ngo bos ma grub pa), they assert that [unconditioned phenomena] are substances or entities that are [positive] determinations.329 Although they consider unconditioned phenomena to be entities, they never assert them to be conditioned entities able to perform functions.330 This is because they state that [unconditioned phenomena] have neither cause nor result, as is said [in the Treasury of Abhidharma]:331 Unconditioned phenomena do not have those [that is, causes and results]."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 C the treasury of knowledge• They state that arhats can regress to the state of a once returner (phyir ’ong) and so forth. • They say that the truth of cessation is something attained through the five faculties,332 is the supreme of all phenomena, is the substance of separation (bral ba’i rdzas), and so forth; thus they consider the truth of cessation to be an entity. • Citing the example of the way a sword cannot cut itself, they do not believe that consciousness (shes pa) can be a reflexive awareness [i.e., a consciousness aware of itself] (rang rig), or that it can experience itself. They state that every consciousness is an other-awareness [i.e., a consciousness aware of what is “other,” meaning outer objects] (gzhan rig).The phrase “and other points” in this root verse refers to other of their numerous unique positions, such as that they are not able to posit that the nonimplicative negation that is the simple negation of the self of persons is thusness.333 It is well known that the four great venerable ones,334 the Kashmiri Saṅghabhadra,335 the venerable Anantavarman,336 and others, in reliance upon teachings found in scriptures [of the Buddha], clearly delineated the basis of this system of philosophical tenets.Sautrāntikas’ Assertions [ii]Dārṣhṭāntikas mostly state the opposite of that.Particles touch but do not join, like [the pages of] a book.The sense faculties are matter; external referents are hidden phenomena.The consciousnesses do not see these: they experience images as their referents. Dārṣhṭāntikas (Exemplifiers), or Sautrāntikas,337 mostly state the opposite of the Vaibhāṣhikas, meaning Sautrāntikas do not make the same asser-tions as the Vaibhāṣhikas on the topics just explained. It is said:Jñānaprasthāna (Entering Primordial Wisdom)338 was composed by Kātāyanīputra;Prakaraṇapāda (Correct Analysis)339 by Vasumitra;"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 133Dharmaskandha (Dharma Aggregate)340 by Shāriputra;Prajñāptishāstra341 (Treatise on Designations)342 by Maudgalyāyana;Vijñānakāya (Collection of Consciousnesses)343 by Devasharman;344Saṅgītiparyāya (Enumerations of Persons)345 by Mahākauṣhṭhila; andDhātukāya (Collection of Constituents)346 by Pūrṇa.Sautrāntikas believe that these seven abhidharma texts347 are treatises (shāstras, bstan bcos) [and not the words of the Buddha] because they were composed independently by those arhats.• They assert that the collection of scriptural dharma—which has the characteristics of terms, and covers all that is contained in the scriptural tradition—is included within the aggregate of forms.• As for forms, like [the Vaibhāṣhikas] above, they say that there are two types: minute particles, which are building blocks; and gross phenom-ena, which are constructed with those. Sautrāntikas, however, say that minute particles circle [each other] and do not join, but they also have no interstices between them. Hence, they are perceived as touching, like [the pages of] a bound book.348• Sense faculties are matter (bem po) and, therefore, they are not what sees referents. • External referents (phyi don) are considered to be hidden.349 Because [external referents objects] are past [when a consciousness arises], they are not what a consciousness sees. Thus, [Sautrāntikas posit] what is called “an image,”350 which is an appearance of consciousness that has been cast by the referent. Although the referent has ceased, the image that is consciousness set by that [referent] is experienced as the likeness of the referent. This is designated as the experience [of the referent]. A consciousness apprehending an object perceives by means of an image [acting] as an intermediary (bar du chod pa). • Sautrāntikas state that percepts and their perceivers, as causes and results, arise sequentially, not simultaneously. Given the Sautrāntikas’ position that external referents are hidden [phe-nomena], they are similar to Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images in considering dualistic appearances to be cognition (shes pa). Nevertheless, these systems differ as to whether “what casts [images]” (gtod byed) is an external referent or not: [for Sautrāntikas, it is an external referent that casts the image; for Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images, it is not]."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 C the treasury of knowledgeForms, mind, feelings, discriminations, and intentions exist substantially.Everything else is imputedly existent; space and the others are nonimplicative negations.They assert that [consciousness is both] a reflexive-awareness and an other-awareness; that [the phenomena of] the three times are imputed entities; and other points.This is [the system] asserted by Saṅgharakṣhita, Shrīlāta, and others. • Among the five bases (which are knowable objects), forms, mind, and either two or three of the mental events—feelings, discriminations, and, [in some cases,] intentions—exist substantially.351 Everything else is asserted to be imputedly existent entities—meaning that they are desig-nated [as entities simply] in relation to [having some] aspects [of enti-ties]352—or to be imputedly existent nonentities (dngos med).• They consider the three types of unconditioned phenomena (space and the others) to be permanent, but [simply] as nonimplicative negations that just refute their impermanence. In terms of what is determined,353 this means that they assert [unconditioned phenomena] simply to be knowable objects that have no established essence, like the horns of a rabbit. • Using the analogy that if something does not illuminate itself, it cannot illuminate something that is other than itself, they say that conscious-ness is twofold: it is reflexive awareness (rang rig), which is an inwards-facing experiencer, and it is other-awareness (gzhan rig), which is an outwards-facing experiencer. [The relationship between a consciousness and the objects it cognizes is like that of a crystal and the colors that appear within it:] colors appearing in a clear crystal are of the nature of that crystal. Thus, since a consciousness is that which is aware of referents that are of the same nature as itself, it is an authentic reflexive awareness (rang rig mtshan nyid pa) and a nominal referent-awareness (don rig btags pa ba).• They maintain that [the phenomena of] the three times are not substan-tially established, that they are mentally imputed entities."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 135The phrase “and other points” in this root verse includes the following:• Sautrāntikas assert that both nirvāṇa with remainder and without remainder are nonimplicative negations, which negate the factors that are to be abandoned by remedies; that is, they are a mere nothingness.• They say that arhats regress just from the meditative concentration of resting at ease in the present life,354 and these arhats are called “those who regress.”355 They do not accept, however, that arhats regress from their result.• They assert that the truth of cessation is a nonentity for the following reasons: It cannot be observed by a valid cognizer356 to be an entity, the way a form or feeling can be, or to be a potential (nus pa), the way the eyes can be. Also the sūtras refer to it as “separation,” “exhaustion,” “disappearance,” and “cessation.” • Sautrāntikas are able to posit that the nonimplicative negation that is the mere negation of a self of persons is thusness.357 The basis of this system of philosophical tenets relies upon the sūtra section of the Victor’s scriptures and is explained by the venerable Saṅgharakṣhita,358 Shrīlāta,359 and others.

Name changes are [part of] the present-day [ordination ceremony], but were not part of the original ceremony.377 The differentiation [of the orders in terms of their] robes, names, and so forth has been explained according to Atīsha’s exegesis.Since the Hevajra Tantra, in the fourth chapter of its second section, cor-relates the four orders to the four chakras,378 and it is explained that the four faces of Kālachakra taught the four orders,379 these are authoritative sources for the position that there were four root orders.The Eighteen Divisions [2]The divisions into five, seven, three, and three [result in] the eighteen [orders]. The way the eighteen orders developed from the four main orders is stated in Vinītadeva’s Compendium on the Different Orders:380Pūrvashailas,381 Aparashailas,382 Haimavatas,383Lokottaravādins,384 andPrajñaptivādins385 are the five orders of Mahāsāṅghikas.

Their dissimilarities arose only because their followers lived in different areas, had different ways of asserting the points of their philosophical tenet systems, and had different founding masters; they do not differ in terms of being paths to liberation. The Sūtra of a Teaching Given in a Dream399 to King Kṛikī states:Great king, you dreamt that you saw eighteen people divide a single piece of cloth and that each person received a piece with-out the original being diminished. This signifies that although the teachings of Shākyamuni will split into eighteen parts, the cloth of freedom will not be diminished. We should know that the eighteen orders do not differ in terms of their qualities.The Twofold Summation [3]This has two divisions: the actual twofold summation; and ancillary analysis.The Actual Twofold Summation [a]They are grouped into propounders of a self and propounders of an absence of a self. If the eighteen orders are simplified, they fall into two groups: propound-ers of a self [of persons] and propounders of an absence of a self [of per-sons]. The five Saṃmitīyas (the Vātsīputrīyas and the others)400 assert an inexplicable self [or person]. They maintain that although the person can-not be described as being the same as or separate from the aggregates, or as permanent or impermanent, and so forth, it is substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient. All the other Vaibhāṣhika orders, as well"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 C the treasury of knowledgeas the Sautrāntikas, state that there is no self [of persons]. The Blaze of Reasoning explains:401 Among those orders, the eight Mahāsāṅghikas402 (who were listed first) and (within the [ten Sthaviras] who were listed second) the Sthaviras, Sarvāstivādins, Mahīshāsakas, Dharmottaras,403 and Kāshyapīyas are propounders of the nonexistence of a self [of persons]. They maintain that the self and “mine” imputed by the assertions of the tīrthikas are empty, and that all phenomena have no self-entity. The remaining five orders, Vātsīputrīyas and the others,404 are propounders of a person. They state that while the person can-not be said to be identical with nor other than the aggregates, it is cognizable by the six consciousnesses and it is clearly what circles in saṃsāra.Ancillary Analysis [b][Shrāvakas] are flawed in their refutation of the Mahāyāna and in their assertion that [ultimate] reality is established.On other [topics] they are not wrong; it is their own system.It is said that the Shrāvaka orders’ refutation of the Mahāyāna is [a reflec-tion of] their inability to comprehend the Mahāyāna’s profundity and vast-ness, and that this is attributable to their inferior scholastic knowledge (rtog ge nyid kyi shes rab), beliefs, and weak merit. Their assertion that ultimate reality is substantially established reflects a similar flaw of not understanding the intention (dgongs pa) of [the Buddha’s] teachings. It is for these reasons that the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras405 and other texts discuss in detail how the Mahāyāna is in fact [the Buddha’s] words. The Vaibhāṣhikas’ assertion of substantial existence is refuted by Sautrāntikas. The Sautrāntikas’ position regarding imputed existence406 is refuted by the Chittamātras by means of numerous scriptures and rea-sonings.

The Classifications of Its Results [cc]This has two parts: an overview; and an extensive explanation.An Overview [1]Having meditated on the sixteen aspects, one progresses through the five paths by applying the factors for awakening, and attains the four types of results. The Buddha appeared in the world and the doctrines he taught remain and are practiced. This makes it possible for one, first, to abide by the ethical conduct of one of the seven or eight sets of vows of individual liberation.409 Then, with a qualified spiritual mentor, one studies, in keeping with the level of one’s acumen, the nine scriptural categories410 according to the shrāvakas, which are contained within the three collections of scripture. Study is followed by critical reflection. By meditating on the topics of reflection, which are the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others),411 one will progress gradually through the five paths of the shrāvakas (accumulation, junction, and so forth) by applying the thirty-seven factors for awakening (byang phyogs so bdun). Finally one attains the four results: stream enterer (srota-āpanna, rgyun zhugs pa), once returner (sakṛid-āgāmin, lan cig phyir ’ong ba), nonreturner (anāgāmin, phyir mi ’ong ba), and arhat (dgra bcom pa).An Extensive Explanation [2]This is discussed in two sections: a detailed explanation of the gradual type; and an explanation of the skipping and instantaneous types as supple-mentary topics."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 C the treasury of knowledgeA Detailed Explanation of the Gradual Type [a]In this section, there are four parts: stream enterers; once returners; non-returners; and arhats.

For those approaching the result of a shrāvaka stream enterer, the particu-lar features of their relinquishment412 are that it is possible that they have not relinquished any of the afflictions of the desire realm (’dod nyon), or that they may have abandoned the fourth or the fifth afflictions413 of the desire realm. They will not have abandoned the sixth affliction at all for it is not possible that those approaching this result have abandoned the sixth.414The particular features of their realization are that they abide in any one of the first fifteen of sixteen moments, which are the path of seeing.415 The sixteen moments comprise the following:• the acceptance of phenomena,416 knowledge of phenomena,417 subse-quent acceptance, and subsequent knowledge418 related to the truth of suffering (1–4); • the acceptance of phenomena, knowledge of phenomena, subsequent acceptance, and subsequent knowledge related to the truth of the origins of suffering (5–8), related to the truth of cessation (9–12), and related to the truth of the path419 (13–16)."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"the shra ̄vakaya ̄na: its tenet systems, orders, and results c 143Those approaching the result of a stream enterer fall into two categories: (1) followers of faith,420 who are of lower acumen; and (2) followers of dharma,421 who are of higher acumen.

(2) Those who were of higher acumen become those who attain through seeing (dṛiṣhṭiprāpta, mthong bas thob pa).424 Second, in terms of the way they take rebirth, there are two types: (1) those who will take rebirth seven times in cyclic existence (saptakṛitparamaḥ, lan bdun pa); and (2) those who will take rebirth two times, who are called “those born into the same class” (kulaṃkula, rigs nas rigs su skye ba).

From a causal perspective, the Treasury [of Abhidharma] says:449 The swift are released in three existences.The rhinoceros [are released] through the causes [they cultivate] during one hundred aeons. In terms of the result, the distinctive qualities of their type are as follows. Those of the pratyekabuddha450 type have a strong sense of pride and, con-sequently, wish to manifest awakening on their own in a world devoid of buddhas and shrāvakas and without any teachers or rivals. They naturally have few mental afflictions, and thus they dislike distractions and seek solitude. Since their compassion is weak, they do not delight in benefiting others and the scope of their concern is limited. Given that their wisdom is more profound than that of the shrāvakas, they do not need to be taught by others and can manifest awakening using their own intelligence. The distinctions of their path are as follows. In addition to understand-ing the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others),451 pratyekabuddhas realize how the twelve links of dependent origination452 are engaged and reversed (’jug ldog). On top of realizing the absence of a self of persons, they also realize that perceived objects have no nature. Thus it is taught that the pratyekabuddhas’ realization is distinguished by their realization of one and a half absences of self-entity.453 A Systematic Presentation of the Pratyekabuddhayāna [ii]This presentation has six topics: the meaning of the term and its etymol-ogy; its entryway; the vows to be guarded; the view to be realized; the result to be attained; and the classifications [of pratyekabuddhas].The Meaning of the Term and Its Etymology [aa]The meaning of the term is that they awaken on their own without relying on others."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"the pratyekabuddhaya ̄na c 153The meaning of the term pratyekabuddha (rang sangs rgyas; self[-realized] buddha) is as follows. without relying on anyone else as their master, they manifest their own awakening through the power of their own wisdom and, therefore, are known as “self-awakened” (rang byang chub). Alterna-tively, in his Commentary on the “Teachings Requested by Akṣhayamati,”454 [Vasubandhu] says that they are called “realizers by means of conditions” (rkyen rtogs)455 because their primordial wisdom realizes dependent origi-nation by means of the condition of an observed object.456Its Entryway [bb]This has two parts: an overview of its entryway; and a detailed explanation of its style of meditation.An Overview of Its Entryway [1']Their entryway is to take external causes and results as analogiesfor the forward and reverse sequences of internal dependent origination.The entryway for pratyekabuddhas is the twelve links of dependent origi-nation, which has external and internal aspects. In terms of the first, the causal forms of external dependent origination include earth, water, fire, space, and time; and its resultant forms include roots, stalks, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The forward sequence (lugs ’byung) is that when causes are present, their results will arise, and the reverse sequence (lugs ldog) is that when the causes are canceled, their results are canceled. Pra tyekabuddhas take these as analogies for internal dependent origina-tion. They examine a skeleton and understand that it comes from old age and death. Accordingly, they work through the steps to realizing that igno-rance is the root of saṃsāra, thereby understanding the forward order of dependent origination. They also recognize that by reversing ignorance, the formative forces are canceled, and so on up through the reversal of old age and death; thus they realize the reverse sequence of dependent origination."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 C the treasury of knowledgeA Detailed Explanation of Its Style of Meditation [2']Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa both have two modes: forward and reverse. Pratyekabuddhas’ meditation on dependent origination involves two modes for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa: a forward mode and a reverse mode. First: Sam.sa ̄ ra The sequence of engaging saṃsāra through the power of afflictive phenom-ena (saṃklesha, kun nyon) is the process as it usually is. This is described in a sūtra:457The condition of ignorance produces the formative forces. The condition of the formative forces generates the consciousnesses . . . The condition of birth results in aging, death, misery, lam-entation, suffering, unhappiness, and agitation. In this way, it is only a great mass of suffering that arises. The reverse sequence is the reverse of that order, as is stated:Aging, death, and so forth follow birth. Birth comes from exis-tence, and existence comes from grasping . . . Formative forces develop because of ignorance. These sequences are distinguished from each other solely on the basis of their order; in fact, they are equivalent in terms of producing conviction about the causes and results of saṃsāra. Second: Nirva ̄n.a The sequence of engaging nirvāṇa through the power of purified phenom-ena (vyavadāna, rnam par byang ba) is stated as follows:From [the perspective of] the descending order, when ignorance is stopped, the formative forces are stopped. when the formative forces are halted, the consciousnesses are halted . . . when birth is stopped, aging, death, and so forth come to an end."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"the pratyekabuddhaya ̄na c 155The reverse sequence is described aswhen birth is stopped, aging and death are stopped. when exis-tence is halted, birth is halted . . . when ignorance is stopped, the formative forces come to an end. These sequences are also simply different in terms of their order, but they are, in fact, identical ways to attain nirvāṇa. Therefore, because it is the case that when fundamental ignorance is stopped one is freed from all suffering, pratyekabuddhas set out to develop true wisdom in order to relinquish that ignorance. The Vows to Be Guarded [cc]Their vows are those of individual liberation.The vows of pratyekabuddhas are the ethical conduct of individual libera-tion, which are the same as for shrāvakas. The View to Be Realized [dd]They realize the absence of a self of persons and that perceived referents have no nature.The Treatises on the Bhūmis458 explain that pratyekabuddhas, like shrāvakas, only realize the absence of a self of persons. On the other hand, the Ornament of Clear Realization says:459 Know that the path of the rhinoceros-like is summarized accurately by [three things]:that they abandon the concept of perceived referents,that they do not relinquish [the notion] of a perceiver,and [the particular quality of] their support.In addition to realizing the absence of a self of persons, pratyekabuddhas realize that perceived referents have no nature, which is one part of the self-entity of phenomena. This [interpretation] accords with the position of most [scholars]."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 C the treasury of knowledgeThe Result to Be Attained [ee]Pratyekabuddhas attain the results of nirvāṇa with remainder and nirvāṇa without remainder. Since those are the same as the shrāvakas’ results, I will not discuss their classifications here at all.460The Classifications [of Pratyekabuddhas] [ff]This has two divisions: the rhinoceros-like; and the congregating practi-tioners.The Rhinoceros-like [1']Those of higher acumenin their final phase of cyclic existence take rebirth on the basis of three aspirations. They become fully ordained monastics and rely upon the special and final fourth [meditative concentration].By meditating on the sixteen aspects [of the four truths], on one seat,they proceed from the heat of the path of junction to the attainment of an arhat.Rhinoceros-like (khaḍgaviṣhāṇakalpa, bse ru lta bu) pratyekabuddhas are of the highest acumen. Like the single horn of a rhinoceros,461 they dwell alone out of their fear of busyness and distraction, and thus they are given that name.462 For one hundred great aeons they please the buddhas who appear, thereby accruing stores [of merit and wisdom]. They also become proficient in the six topics of training: the aggregates, constituents, sense spheres, dependent origination, what is the case and what is not the case, and the truth.463 During their final phase of cyclic existence,464 they make three aspira-tions: to be born in a world without buddhas and shrāvakas; to attain awakening on their own, not relying upon a master or anyone else; and to benefit others only by physical gestures that communicate the dharma, not by verbal communications. with these three aspirations they take their final birth in one of three castes465 (and not the laborer, or shūdra, caste) in a world devoid of buddhas and shrāvakas. In that state [i.e., lifetime]"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"the pratyekabuddhaya ̄na c 157through the force of their previous aspirations, they become fully ordained monastics without preceptors (upādhyāya) or masters (āchārya). They meditate on the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others), relying on the distinctive “final perfection,” which is the fourth meditative concentration.466 On one seat they proceed from the path of junction to the attainment of the primordial wisdom of an arhat, which is endowed with the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defilements] and the knowledge of their [subsequent] nonarising.467 This explanation accords with the shrāvaka tradition. The Mahāyāna’s [Compendium of] Abhidharma explains that pratyeka-buddhas require a series of lifetimes to proceed from the level of heat [on the path of junction] to the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defilements] and the knowledge of their [subsequent] nonarising.The Congregating Practitioners [2']The lesser congregating practitioners are of lower acumen, the greater congregating practitioners are of intermediate acumen.They take two lifetimes, and bring [the doors of] liberation to mind. They teach the dharma by means of silent physical communications. The pratyekabuddhas called “congregating practitioners” (vargachārin, tshogs spyod) are said to be like parrots, who fly in flocks. Thus, their basic quality is that they meditate with their companions. [There are two sub-types: the lesser congregating practitioners (tshogs spyod chung ngu) and the greater congregating practitioners (tshogs spyod chen po).]The lesser congregating practitioners have accrued stores [of merit and wisdom] like the previous type [i.e., the rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddhas]. During their final phase of cyclic existence, they become learned in the six topics [of training] and develop through the middle level of patience [on the path of junction]. To progress through the rest of the paths, they again become proficient in the six topics. They take their last birth [propelled] by their three aspiration prayers and attain the result according to their type. This group is of lower acumen. The greater congregating practitioners are similar to the previous type,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"15\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeexcept for the following differences. During their final phase of cyclic existence, they become learned in the six topics [of training], see the truth, and attain one of the first three results. Since they have been unable to attain the level of an arhat, they again become skilled in the six topics in order to attain that state. They take [their last birth] through [the force of] their three aspiration prayers and attain the result according to their type. This group is of intermediate acumen. Both [congregating types] take two lifetimes [to achieve their aims]. All three types of pratyekabuddhas bring to their minds profound depen-dent origination and the three doors to liberation.468 To counteract others’ lack of faith, they display whatever miraculous powers are appropriate. By being peaceful and restrained when they are out seeking alms, they teach the dharma that brings the realization of dependent origination through silent physical communications.Generally, the Treatises on the Bhūmis explain shrāvakas and pratyeka-buddhas in terms of higher and lower acumen and results, but since their expositions of the paths are mostly the same, they do not have separate collections of scriptures. In keeping with this approach, many Indian and Tibetan texts conflate the philosophical tenet systems of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. On the other hand, the Sūtra Dispelling the Remorse of [King] Ajātashatru469 and the Kālachakra Tantra state that pratyekabuddhas have their own collections of scriptures, and, following those, some texts make a distinction between their tenet systems. Here, I have made separate presentations of the philosophical tenet systems of shrāvakas and pratyeka-buddhas because, despite the fact that their tenet systems are mostly the same, they do have many dissimilarities, and because the general expres-sion “three yānas” is well known in the scriptures.470"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"SECTION II: M AHĀYĀNA"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"5.

A Detailed Explanation of the Classifications of [the Pāramitāyāna’s] Philosophical Tenet Systems 1' An Overview: Their Names• • • •[This chapter begins the second main section of this volume:] a systematic presentation of the Mahāyāna. It has two parts: a description of the dif-ferences between the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna; and the actual systematic presentation of the Mahāyāna. A Description of the Differences between the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna [1][Mahāyāna practitioners] realize both absences of self-entity; their intention and practice accord with the pāramitās. They abandon the two obscurations, and do not abide in the extremes of existence or peace.[The Mahāyāna] possesses seven greatnesses. To begin a systematic presentation of the Mahāyāna, I will address the question of what the differences are between the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna. Mikyö Dorjé471 and his successors explain that they differ in terms of five points:(1) their realizations of the view;(2) the intentions and practices (sbyor ba) of their training;(3) their relinquishments of the factors to be abandoned;(4) the results they attain; and(5) seven greatnesses.First: [Realizations]Those who, in addition to realizing the absence of a self of persons, clearly and completely realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena, belong to the Mahāyāna; those without such realization belong to the Hīnayāna. This accords with [Nāgārjuna’s] statement in his Praises of the Transcen-dent One:472"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 163You taught that those who do not realize that characteristics do not exist are not liberated.Therefore you presented this in its entirety in the Mahāyāna. Second: [Trainings]They differ [in terms of their training]: [Mahāyāna practitioners] are moti-vated by their intentions of love, compassion, and bodhichitta, and under-take to train in the six pāramitās; [Hīnayāna practitioners] have neither [such intentions nor such trainings]. This accords with the statement by Āchārya Shūra:473The rhinoceros-likehave never heard even the words “six pāramitās.”It is only the Bhagavat who abides in all six pāramitās. Third: [Relinquishments]The Hīnayāna is able to remove the afflictive obscurations (kleṣhāvaraṇa, nyon sgrib) in their entirety, but cannot remove completely the cognitive obscurations (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya’i sgrib pa). The Mahāyāna is able to remove both obscurations along with all their habitual tendencies. Fourth: [Results]The Hīnayāna is inferior in terms of its method and wisdom, thus it is for those who aspire only for a nirvāṇa [that is] peace. The Ornament of Clear Realization states:474 [Bodhisattvas] do not abide in existence owing to their wisdom,and they do not abide in peace owing to their compassion. Accordingly, since the Mahāyāna teaches about profound wisdom and extensive methods, it is for those who aspire to and will achieve a nirvāṇa that does not consist of abiding in the extremes of existence or peace. Fifth: [Seven Greatnesses]The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras says:475"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164 C the treasury of knowledgeBecause [the Mahāyāna] possesses [seven] greatnesses—great focus;the two accomplishments;primordial wisdom; the cultivation of diligence;skill in methods; the greatness of true accomplishments;and the great activity of the buddhas—it is described definitively as “the Greater Vehicle.” To take those in order: (1) [G reatness of focus means that Mahāyāna practitioners] focus on the great breadth of the Mahāyāna collection of scriptures (piṭakas, sde snod). (2) [I ts two accomplishments] are to be of benefit to oneself and oth-ers. (3) [The Mahāyāna’s primordial wisdom] is the realization of the two-fold absence of self-entity.476(4) [Bodhisattvas] cultivate the diligence of devoted application through-out three incalculable aeons477 [on the Mahāyāna path].(5) [The Mahāyāna’s skillful methods mean that] since [bodhisattvas] have not forsaken [beings in] saṃsāra and have none of the afflictive phenomena (saṃklesha, kun nyon), they may, for example, do [any of] the seven physical or verbal unvirtuous actions.478 (6) [The true accomplishments of the Mahāyāna] are to perfectly achieve the strengths, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities of a buddha.479 (7) [Buddha activity] is spontaneous, uninterrupted activity. The Mahāyāna possesses those [seven greatnesses]; the Hīnayāna does not. The Condensed [Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra]480 says:Because they have great generosity, great intellects, and great powers,because they enter the supreme Mahāyāna of the victors,wear great armor, and tame the magical displays of Māra,they are called “mahābodhisattvas.”"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 165The Compendium of the Mahāyāna says:481 The source of knowable objects; the characteristics; engaging those;its causes and results; its unfolding;its three trainings; and its results—the relinquishmentsand primordial wisdoms—are what make the [Mahā]yāna outstand-ing and distinguished. Such quotations are representative of innumerable similar ones found in the teachings [of the Buddha] and the commentaries on their intention. The Actual Systematic Presentation of the Mahāyāna [2]This is discussed in two sections: the Pāramitāyāna: the cause-based phil-osophical [yāna]; and the Vajrayāna: the result-based [yāna] of Secret Mantra.482 The Pāramitāyāna: The Cause-Based Philosophical [Yāna] [a]This has two parts: an overview of its characteristics; and a detailed account of the systematic presentation [of the Pāramitāyāna].483 An Overview of Its Characteristics [i]This is the Mahāyāna, [which leads practitioners to] buddhahoodthrough its cause-based philosophical [path].

It enables us to develop vast wisdom and a sphere of far-reaching activity, and to attain the joys of the elevated states484 and the happiness of defini-tive excellence.485 Thus it is termed “Mahāyāna” (Greater Vehicle). The Condensed [Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra] explains why:Why is it called the Mahāyāna of awakening?when traveled upon, it takes sentient beings beyond misery. This yāna is a palace of immeasurable proportions, like space."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166 C the treasury of knowledgeIt is the supreme of yānas: the means for truly attaining joy, plea-sure, and happiness. [The Pāramitāyāna] is called a philosophical486 [yāna], because it portrays (mtshon par byed pa) the path and its attributes that directly connect us to the unified state of Vajradhara, the final fruition. In relationship to the pri-mordial wisdom of unification (which is nonabiding nirvāṇa, the ultimate result), [the Pāramitāyāna] is referred to as the cause-based yāna since it takes as its practice the cause-based part [of the Mahāyāna path that leads] to that [primordial wisdom].487 A Detailed Account of the Systematic Presentation [of the Pāramitāyāna]488 [ii]This has two topics: general statements about undertaking the training; and a detailed explanation of the classifications of [the Pāramitāyāna’s] philosophical tenet systems.General Statements about Undertaking the Training [aa]This has three parts: the person who trains; the application of the training: the six pāramitās; and an explanation of the actual practice: shamatha and vipashyanā.The Person Who Trains [1']People who make this journeyare highly intelligent; their acumen is at one of three levels.Generally speaking, people who journey on the Mahāyāna path possess great minds: their propensities (rigs) for the Mahāyāna have been awak-ened by circumstances, they have developed the intention of the two kinds of bodhichitta,489 and they have the capacity to engage in the extensive conduct of awakening as their undertaking. With those [qualities] as a basis, there are three levels of acumen: lower, higher, and highest. Those of lower acumen have an interest in and forbearance for the pāramitā of wisdom, but when they engage in the first five pāramitās, such as generos-"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 167ity, they are unable to bring the pāramitā of wisdom to bear. Such people are known as beginning bodhisattvas. Those of higher acumen are able to apply the pāramitā of wisdom to their practice of generosity and the other pāramitās. Those who are of the highest acumen are able to bring a distinctive [aspect of] the pāramitā of wisdom to bear on their practice of generosity and the other pāramitās, meaning their intuitive reflexive awareness (so so rang rig) directly recognizes the natures [of the other five pāramitās].The Application of the Training: The Six Pāramitās [2']Following the generation of bodhichitta,their undertaking is to train in the six pāramitās.We should understand these in terms of their essential qualities; characteristics; etymologies;divisions and summaries; pure forms; most important types; distinctiveness; ways of training;results; numerical definitiveness;490 and order.The training for all three levels of acumen is to engage in the conduct of awakening once bodhichitta has been aroused. This is mainly to train in the six pāramitās as one’s undertaking. Although many of the topics concerned with these have already been discussed in the section on the vows of a bodhisattva,491 I will give a brief account now [in terms of the following eleven points]. Their Essential Qualities [a']The Precious Garland says:492 Generosity means to give away your own wealth.Ethical conduct benefits others.Patience means to renounce anger.Diligence fully embraces virtue.Meditative concentration is one-pointed, free from mental afflictions. wisdom ascertains the meaning of the truths."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"16\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeTheir Characteristics [b']Each pāramitā has four characteristics: it diminishes its opposite quality (miserliness and so forth);493 it is endowed with primordial wisdom, which does not conceive of the three spheres;494 it fulfills the welfare of oth-ers through its practice; and it matures the mindstreams of beings. These accord with statements such as the one in the Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras]:495Generosity diminishes its discordant quality;it is endowed with nonconceptual primordial wisdom;it fulfills all wishes;and it matures all beings through the three means [or yānas]. Their Etymologies [c']The same text states:496 It is explained that they are what dispels poverty; what produces coolness; what prevents anger;what is the supreme application; what focuses the mind;and what knows the ultimate. “what dispels poverty” is given as the etymology of generosity. The [San-skrit] equivalent for generosity (sbyin pa) is dāna. Dā is from dāridrya,497 meaning “poverty.” Na is a negating word, [meaning] “eliminate.” Since [dāna] means “to eliminate and dispel poverty,” it is [the word] used for generosity. we should know that such explanations are given for all [the other pāramitās’ names].498 Their Divisions and Summaries [d']The DivisionsEach of the eighteen divisions of the root pāramitās, which were described in the section on the vows of a bodhisattva,499 has the following six quali-ties, making one hundred and eight divisions of the pāramitās:"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 169(1) it is done for the welfare of sentient beings;(2) it is done in a way that does not harm sentient beings;(3) it is done with forbearance for the sufferings involved with difficult deeds;(4) it is done without being interrupted by other activities;(5) it is done with an undistracted mind; and(6) it is done with the understanding that everything is empty and illusionlike.Alternatively, the Ornament of Clear Realization states:500 Since each of them incorporates each of the six—generosity and the others— armor[like] accomplishmentis described in terms of the six sets of six.Since each of the six pāramitās incorporates the other six—such that there is the generosity of generosity, the ethics of generosity, and so forth—there are also thirty-six divisions of the pāramitās. The SummariesThe Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:501 Generosity and ethical conductcontribute to the store of merit, and wisdom to [the store of] pri-mordial wisdom.The other three belong to both.The [first] five can also belong to the store of primordial wisdom. Thus it is said that [the six pāramitās encompass] the two stores. One alter-native explanation is that when [the first five pāramitās] are embraced by wisdom, they become the store of primordial wisdom. Another is that since the first five [pāramitās] are method and the sixth is wisdom, [the pāramitās] are contained within method and primordial wisdom."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"170 C the treasury of knowledge[Their Pure Forms] [e']Our generosity is pure when we have no hopes for rewards or the matura-tion [of the act]. The Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] states:502 Generosity free from hopes;ethical conduct not concerned with [rewards] in future existences;patience in all ways;diligence that is the source of all excellent qualities;meditative concentration not [directed towards] the formless [realm];and wisdom endowed with methodsare what those steadfast in the six pāramitāspractice perfectly.Their Most Important Types [f ']we should know that among all the types of generosity, generosity involv-ing the dharma is the most important. The same text says:503 Giving the dharma, maintaining pure ethical conduct,attaining patience with the unborn,cultivating diligence in the Mahāyāna [path],abiding in the final [equipoise] with compassion,504and wisdom are considered to be the most important pāramitās for the intelligent. If we wish to incorporate those qualities associated with [the primary pāra-mitās], we must practice with the six genuine aspects (dam pa drug):505(1) The genuine support (rten dam pa) is to possess bodhichitta.(2) The genuine object (dngos po dam pa) is, for example, an object of generosity for which we have absolutely no partiality.(3) The genuine goal (ched du bya ba dam pa) is to work for the welfare of others. (4) The genuine method (thabs dam pa) is that [our practice of the pāramitās] is embraced by the wisdom that does not conceive of the three spheres."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 171(5) The genuine dedication (bsngo ba dam pa) is the sealing [of an act] by purely dedicating [the merit] to [the attainment of] awakening. (6) The genuine purity (dag pa dam pa) is practicing [the six pāramitās] as the direct antidotes for the two obscurations.Their Distinctiveness [g']This has two aspects. [First,] there is the distinction between discordant qualities and their remedies. Those with the propensity for degeneration (nyams pa’i skal ba can) possess qualities discordant with generosity, such as attachment to pleasures. There are others with the propensity for dis-tinction in that they possess the remedies [for discordant qualities], such as nonattachment. [The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:506 The causes of the degeneration of the steadfast ones’ [pāramitās] arebeing attached to pleasures, being [morally] weak,being proud, having excessive desire [for comfort],indulging [in meditative concentration], and [holding on to reifying] concepts.Know that bodhisattvas who have the remedies for thosehave the qualities conducive to distinction,since they are able to overcome those [hindrances].[Second,] there is the distinction between artificial [pāramitās] and true [pāramitās] as described in [The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras]:507It is taught that those who are false, are hypocritical,who make a show of being agreeable, apply themselves [only] intermittently,are [just] physically and verbally calm, or are [merely] eloquent,have divorced themselves from the practice of the [pāramitās].They are not true bodhisattvas."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172 C the treasury of knowledgeThose who practice the opposite of thoseare said to [posses] the true [pāramitās].The Way to Train in the Pāramitās [h']We should practice each [pāramitā] as incorporating all six pāramitās by being aware of their respective benefits and being aware of the faults of the qualities that are discordant with them. This can be illustrated by looking at generosity. when practicing the generosity of giving away our body, possessions, and roots of virtue, we should incorporate the other five pāramitās: • by maintaining the ethical conduct of [observing] the vows and mental engagements of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; • by having patience for, and interest in, the qualities of omniscience; • by having the diligence that will motivate us to increase those [pāramitās]; • by remaining in the meditative concentration of resting our minds one-pointedly without mixing in [things from] the Hīnayāna; and • by sustaining the wisdom of recognizing that the object of generosity, the act of generosity, and the person who is generous are illusionlike. Their Results [i']The temporal [results] are described in the Precious Garland:508Generosity generates wealth; ethical conduct brings happiness.Patience [results in] radiance; diligence brings brilliance;meditative concentration [creates] peace; and intelligence liberates.The final results are that the store of merit is the direct cause of a buddha’s form kāyas;509 the store of primordial wisdom is the direct cause of the dharmakāya; and diligence assists both, bringing about the attainment of these two kāyas [that is, the form kāyas and the dharmakāya]. Their Numerical Definitiveness [j']That the pāramitās are definitely six is derived from the fact that when all the dharmas that the bodhisattvas practice are condensed, they are"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"the maha ̄ya ̄na’s distinctions and training c 173contained within the three trainings.510 The Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] explains:511 The Victor perfectly elucidated the six pāramitās in the context of the three trainings.Three [pāramitās belong to] the first [training];the last two are the [other] two forms [of training];and one [pāramitā] accompanies all three [trainings].Alternatively, the six pāramitās are described in relation to the elevated states and definitive excellence. Three pāramitās are performed for the sake of [results in] the elevated states: one is generous in order [to gain future] wealth; one maintains ethical conduct so that one will have a good physical body [in future lives]; and one is patient in order to [attract a favorable] entourage [in the future]. Three pāramitās are [performed for the sake of results] connected to definitive excellence: one practices meditative concentration in order to develop shamatha; one cultivates wisdom in order to develop vipashyanā; and one is diligent for the sake of increasing one’s excellent qualities.Their Order [k']The same text says:512 [The pāramitās] are presented in this orderbecause the latter ones arise on the basis of the earlier ones;they [progress from] inferior to superior,and [grow] from coarse to subtle. For those three reasons, the pāramitās (generosity and the others) are taught in this specific order.An Explanation of the Actual Practice: Shamatha and Vipashyanā [3']The actual practice is first to cultivate shamatha, which is one-pointed concentration, and then vipashyanā, which is the discernment of phenomena."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174 C the treasury of knowledgeThe actual practice is described in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras:513Shamatha and vipashyanā are that,on the basis of true abiding, mind rests within mindand phenomena are discerned.As a beginning, one cultivates the one-pointed samādhi of shamatha first, and then one practices vipashyanā, which is the wisdom that discerns, or differentiates, phenomena. In the end, one meditates within the samādhi that fuses shamatha and vipashyanā, resting evenly in a natural way. Thus one is liberated from the bonds of cyclic existence and peace, and attains nonabiding nirvāṇa. The Sūtra Unraveling the Intention states:514 A person who becomes familiar with vipashyanā and shamathawill be liberated from the bonds of taking on bad statesand the fetters of characteristics. An extensive systematic presentation of shamatha and vipashyanā will appear in the section on the stages of meditation.515 A Detailed Explanation of the Classifications of [the Pāramitāyāna’s] Philosophical Tenet Systems [bb]This is discussed in two parts: an overview of their names; and an extensive explanation of their characteristics.An Overview: Their Names [1'][The Pāramitāyāna’s] systems of philosophical tenets are either Chittamātra or Madhyamaka.The cause-based philosophical yāna contains the philosophical tenets sys-tems of the Chittamātras, who are the Proponents of Cognition,516 and the Mādhyamikas, who are the Proponents of the Absence of a Nature.517"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"6.

An Overview [aa']They condense the entire Mahāyāna path into seven bases.Chittamātras condense the whole Mahāyāna path into seven bases, follow-ing what is stated in the Compendium of the Mahāyāna:523The source of knowable objects; the characteristics; engaging those;its causes and results; its unfolding;its three trainings; and its results—the relinquishmentsand primordial wisdoms—are what make the [Mahā]yāna outstanding and distinguished. An Extensive Explanation [bb']This presentation has seven topics: the source of knowable objects; the [three] characteristics of those [knowable objects]; [how] to engage the import of those; the cause and result [of that engagement]; the unfolding; the three trainings; and the results of purification.The Source of Knowable Objects [1'']The source of knowable objects is the ālaya consciousness. It is taught that the source (gnas) of knowable objects is the ālaya con-sciousness (ālayavijñāna, kun gzhi’i rnam shes) so that we will become skilled in understanding the dependently originated causes of all phenom-ena.524 There are four points involved in ascertaining this subject."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"17\u0018 C the treasury of knowledge(1) The reasons that the ālaya exists are given in the Sūtra Unraveling the Intention:525The appropriating consciousness,526 profound and subtle, flows with its seeds, like a river.It is wrong to regard it as a self;thus I do not teach it to the immature.(2) The characteristics [of the ālaya] are as described in the Abhidharma Sūtra:527The expanse of beginningless timeis the source of all phenomena.Since it exists, there are beings and the attainment of nirvāṇa.Since [the ālaya consciousness], on the basis of the habitual tendencies for all afflictive phenomena,528 holds the seeds [for such phenomena], it is the cause for the arising of all afflictive phenomena. Since it can become anything, it is also not obscured. It is indeterminate, because it is neither virtuous nor unvirtuous. (3) As for when [the ālaya consciousness] is reversed (ldog pa): it engages (’jug pa) as long as beings are in saṃsāra, but it is reversed with the attain-ment of arhatship. This accords with the teaching:That which is like a flowing riveris reversed with [the attainment] of arhatship.when one becomes a buddha, it is reversed in the sense of being trans-formed, as is said:Whatever is of the ālaya consciousnessbecomes mirror[like] primordial wisdom.(4) [The ālaya consciousness] is distinctly different from a creator, such as Īshvara. Īshvara and the like are considered to be the creator of all, single, a self, and permanent. The ālaya is notably superior since it is asserted that"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 179it is present within each and every sentient being, and it is of the nature of the momentary dependent origination that is the differentiation of the nature [into phenomena].529 The [Three] Characteristics of Those [Knowable Objects] [2'']This has three topics: the dependent characteristic, the basis for designa-tions; the imagined characteristic, what is designated; and the consummate characteristic, the pervader.530 The Dependent [Characteristic], the Basis for Designations [a'']As for the three characteristics: the dependent characteristic arises from that [ālaya consciousness].It is the imagination of what is unreal, appearing through the force of habitual tendencies.It does not remain for an instant and is governed by what precedes it. [Knowable objects] are categorized in terms of the three characteristics.531 First, the dependent [characteristic] (paratantra, gzhan dbang) is what arises from that ālaya consciousness. It is referred to as “the imagination of what is unreal”532 in that it is what appears as perceived aspects (zung cha’i rnam pa)—that is, what appears as the phenomena of the aggregates, constituents, and sense spheres—and it is what appears as the perceiving aspects (’dzin cha’i rnam pa).”• Because [the dependent characteristic] arises through the force of its own habitual tendencies, which are previous seeds of similar types, it is [dependent] in terms of its causes. • Because it is its nature not to remain for a second moment once it comes into existence, it is [dependent] in terms of its nature. • Because it generates subsequent [moments of the dependent character-istic] as similar types, and because such later [moments] are governed by the previous ones, it is [dependent] in terms of its results. In brief, [the dependent characteristic] is the basis for the designations of imagined [characteristics] and is part of the ālaya. It is the imagination of what is unreal, which is the mere cognition533 (vijñaptimātra, rnam rig"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"1\u00180 C the treasury of knowledgetsam) characteristic of [all beings in] the three realms.534 Its nature is that it is substantially established.535 From the perspective of delusion, it arises from causes and conditions. The Imagined [Characteristic], What Is Designated [b'']On top of that substantially existent basis for designations, a self, “mine,” and so forth are mistakenly imagined. On top of that dependent [nature], which (as just stated) is the basis for designations and is substantially existent, the mental consciousness, that is, the imagination of what is unreal, mistakenly superimposes (samāropa, sgro btags pa) persons and phenomena, and imagines a self, “mine,” names, reasons, and so forth.536 [Imagined characteristics (parikalpita, kun brtags)] appear although ultimately they do not exist substantially in any way, just like floaters.537 They are only the perceived objects of a deluded mind. To focus on these [imagined characteristics as existent] is contrary to libera-tion. The imagined aspect is utterly nonexistent, like the horns of a rab-bit.538 The Consummate [Characteristic], the Pervader [c''][The consummate is] the unconditioned, empty of the object of negation: imputed existence.It is nonconceptual cognition, empty of duality, ultimately existent.The consummate539 (pariniṣhpanna, yongs grub) is what is unconditioned, and is empty of imagined [characteristics], which are the objects of nega-tion and [only] imputedly existent. It is consummate in that it is noth-ing other than nonconceptual cognition (shes pa) empty of the duality of percept and perceiver, and it is the observed objects of [the path of] purification. [An Overview of the Three Characteristics]Imagined [characteristics] exist simply as imputations, because they do not exist as [functional] entities. Dependent [characteristics] exist sub-stantially, because they are able to perform functions. The consummate"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 1\u00181[characteristic] exists ultimately, because it is the object of nonconceptual [cognition]. Consequently, in the sūtras, teachings that list nonexistents540 are pre-sentations of imagined [characteristics]. Teachings on illusions, dreams, mirages, and the like are about the dependent [characteristic]. The presen-tations of nonconceptuality and the unconditioned teach the consummate [characteristic]. Masters have given various accounts of the categorizations [of the three characteristics], of which the following are the most well-known for the majority of Tibetans.541 The imagined [characteristic] is twofold:(1) Im agined [characteristics] devoid of any characteristics (mtshan nyid chad pa’i kun brtags) are what in fact do not exist, but are conceptu-ally imputed, such as the belief in a self (bdag lta) or something being substantially established. (2) No minal imagined [characteristics] (rnam grangs pa’i kun brtags) are object-universals (artha-sāmānya, don spyi), which appear to thoughts, and the appearance of the dualism of perceived objects and perceiving subjects for the nonconceptual sense consciousnesses.542 The dependent [characteristic] has two aspects:543(1) The impure dependent [characteristic] (ma dag gzhan dbang) is the mind and mental events of [beings in] the three realms, which, [though] not dual, are what appear as a duality because of their habitual tendencies.544(2) The pure dependent [characteristic] (dag pa gzhan dbang) is the cog-nition [of noble beings during meditative equipoise,] which has no dualistic experience; and it is the cognition of noble beings during the subsequent state,545 which does not fixate on appearances.The consummate [characteristic] is also twofold:546(1) The unchanging consummate [characteristic] (nirvikārapariniṣhpanna, ’gyur med yongs grub) is dharmatā, which is empty of both the depen-dent (the basis for delusion) and the imagined (the delusion). It is a nonimplicative negation, thusness, and what is unconditioned.(2) The u nerring consummate [characteristic] (aviparyāsapariniṣhpanna,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"1\u00182 C the treasury of knowledgephyin ci ma log pa’i yongs grub) is nondual cognition, which is what remains when [cognition] is empty of the duality of percept and perceiver. It is reflexive awareness, real (satya, bden pa), and sub-stantially established. The path and its observed objects are con-sidered part of this [unerring consummate] in the sense that they accompany it.547 In terms of conventions (vyavahāra, tha snyad), imagined [characteristics] are the actual conventions; dependent [characteristics] are the basis for conventions; and the consummate [characteristic] is without conven-tions. In terms of the use of conventions, the imagined [characteristic] refers to the delusion of dualistic appearances. The dependent [characteristic] is used for the referent that is free from that [imagined nature]. The consum-mate [characteristic] refers to thusness. It is clearly taught that a magical illusion serves as an analogy for these [three characteristics]. The mantras that create a phantom and the small piece of wood that serves as the basis for a phantom [equate, respectively, to] the fundamental mind and thusness. From those [manifests] the image (ākāra, rnam pa) that appears to be an elephant, which is the dependent [characteristic]. The elephant is the imagined [characteristic]. The nonex-istence of that [elephant] in that [image of an elephant] is the consummate [characteristic].548[How] to Engage the Import of Those [3'']The practical engagement of those [three characteristics involves] three [determinations] free from discouragement; four abandonments;devoted interest; knowing the absence of any reference; abandoning imagination; and seeing correctly. In this way, [bodhisattvas] enter the bhūmis of engagement through belief, seeing, meditation, and completion. As for engaging those characteristics [of knowable objects], four [criteria must be present] in order for their import to be realized.549"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 1\u00183(1) who are the individuals that engage these? They are [bodhisat-tvas] who have amassed the two stores [of merit and wisdom] of the Mahāyāna. (2) what causes this engagement? • The strengths generated by roots of virtue.• The three types of determination free from discouragement: having the determination that all sentient beings will achieve buddhahood; having the determination to engage in the pāramitās; and having the determination, “I will not be impeded by anything.” • The four abandonments: abandoning the mental engagements of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; abandoning doubts about the Mahāyāna; giving up partiality with regard to dharma; and casting aside conceptuality. • Engaging in shamatha and vipashyanā with devoted interest. (3) How do we engage [these three characteristics as a path]? By means of the habitual tendencies of studying, we investigate the classifications of names, entities, natures, and specifics, and thereby come to understand that the three characteristics are not observable reference points. we do this in three stages: (1) by knowing that all those are merely imputedly existent; (2) by understanding them to be mere cognition; (3) and by reversing the idea that they are mere cognition. In brief, we enter the path by recognizing delusion, which is the imag-ined [characteristic]; by abandoning the imagination, which is the depen-dent [nature]; and by directly seeing the consummate. (4) what are the periods or phases of engagement? we engage gradually: first we [enter] the paths of accumulation and junction with engagement through belief; then we [proceed] on the paths of seeing, meditation, and completion. The Cause and Result [of That Engagement] [4'']The cause and result of that [engagement] are contained within the conduct of the six pāramitās.The graduated path of that engagement [proceeds] by means of the conduct"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"1\u00184 C the treasury of knowledgeof the six pāramitās: such conduct is the cause that initially gives rise to the path, and it is also the culminating result [of the path]. The Unfolding [5'']The gradual progression is the unfolding of the modes of the ten bhūmis. The six pāramitās bring about the unfolding of the modes of the ten bhūmis (Very Joyful and the others) [according to] the ways of engaging cognition (rnam par rig pa la ’jug pa’i tshul). [The modes of the bhūmis] are included within [the discussions of] the way the bhūmis are traversed by means of the pāramitās, the way the bhūmis are attained, and the length of time it takes to progress through them. The Three Trainings [6'']The trainings are the three types of higher trainings.As stated above,550 the six pāramitās are included within the three train-ings, which are the foundations for bodhisattvas’ trainings. The training in higher ethical conduct is of three types: the ethical con-duct of restraint and the others.551 The term “higher” is used to indicate that these [trainings] are distinguished from those of the Hīnayāna by the arousing of bodhichitta and so forth. The training in higher concentration552 is to practice the bodhisattvas’ heroic stride samādhi and the others553 in order to meditate on the pāra-mitās, mature sentient beings, and achieve all the qualities of a buddha. As for the training in higher wisdom:554 once all concepts and character-istics have been relinquished, nonconceptuality is spontaneously present and the states subsequent [to meditative equipoise] are experienced as illusionlike. This is the pāramitā of wisdom. In general, the trainings of bodhisattvas are immeasurable, but if they are abbreviated, they are contained within these [three trainings]. The Results of Purification [7'']The results are the excellences of relinquishment and primordial wisdom."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 1\u00185The results555 that develop from those [trainings] are (1) the excellence of relinquishment, which is the conquering of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations; and (2) the excellence of primordial wisdom, which is the three kāyas—svabhāvakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya—and their essence or characteristic—the dharmakāya. [The dharmakāya] is endowed with five attributes: it is a transformation; the basis for positive qualities; nondual; permanent; and inconceivable.556 It is the source that radiates the immeasurable and inconceivable qualities of a buddha.I will explain some topics related to the bhūmis, paths, and so forth later.557 Those who wish to understand these in detail should refer to earlier Tibetan works, such as Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen’s [Jeweled] Tree. I have taken the assertions of earlier Tibetan [masters] as the basis for this presentation, and [followed] traditions that assert that Maitreya’s Dharma Treatises558 and the texts of Asaṅga559 and his brother [Vasu-bandhu]560 are Chittamātra.561The Explanation of the Classifications [of the Chittamātra System] [iii']In this section, there are two parts: the general explanation; and the actual classifications [of the Chittamātra system].The General Explanation [aa']The root of their assertions is that other than being mere cognition, external referents do not have even the slightest existence, like dreams. The root of the Chittamātras’ general assertion is that external referents (bā hyārtha, phyi don) do not have even the slightest existence other than being mere cognition, like appearances in dreams. Their reasons are as follows:• Referents, such as forms, and everything such as the arising and ceas-ing of those [objects] are only mental appearances, like floaters or the appearance of two moons [when you press on your closed eyelids].• If external referents were to exist in reality (bden par yod), it would fol-low that they would exist for the nonconceptual primordial wisdom of noble beings abiding in meditative equipoise; and yet they do not exist for [noble beings in that state]."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"1\u00186 C the treasury of knowledge• What appears to the six kinds of beings seems to be distinctly different even though [their perception] is not affected by superficial causes for [perceptual] error. To take one example: a river is seen as nectar by gods, as water by humans, as pus and blood by hungry ghosts, and as molten metal by beings in the hot hells, because of the positive or nega-tive karma [of these beings].Furthermore, the Chittamātras use many scriptural references and reason-ings to refute external referents and prove that [all phenomena] are mere cognition.The Actual Classifications [of the Chittamātra System] [bb']This is discussed in two sections: the actual [classifications]; and ancillary points.The Actual [Classifications] [1'']This has two divisions: Proponents of Real Images; and Proponents of False Images.Proponents of Real Images [a'']This discussion has two parts: the assertions of the Proponents of Real Images; and a description of their specific classifications.The Assertions of the Proponents of Real Images [i'']They hold [one of] two positions: [first,] Proponents of Real Imagesassert that appearances are real in being the mind, which is the perceived object.As their principal philosophical tenets, Chittamātra Proponents hold [one of] two positions: that images are real (satyākāra, rnam bden pa) or that images are false (alīkākāra, rnam rdzun pa).562As for the first, Proponents of Real Images assert that external referents do not exist as real entities and yet, owing to the habitual tendencies for conceiving [of appearances] as objects, cognition itself arises as the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 1\u00187image of a referent, as in the analogy of a crystal with a color.563 Thus, everything that appears as forms is simply the mind itself, which is the agent for appearances (snang mkhan) manifesting as distant cut-off objects (rgyangs chad kyi don) owing to the power of the deluded habitual tenden-cies. Moreover, [appearances,] in fact, are real in being the mind, which is the perceived object.564 Therefore, the aggregates, constituents, sense spheres, and even true cessation (which is considered to be mind free from the factors to be abandoned), all of which are taught in the sūtras, are real in being mental phenomena, which is to say, they are [only] the mind itself. Owing to taking this position, they are known as Proponents of Real Images (Satyākāravādin, rNam bden pa).565 A Description of Their Specific Classifications [ii'']This section has three parts: Split-Eggists; Proponents of Perceptual Parity; and Non-Pluralists.566Split-Eggists [aa''][Some state that both] cognition and [its] images are real in being reflexive parts (rang cha).[Split-Eggists]567 are those who assert that perceived objects (which are cognitive images) and the perceiving cognition are [matching] halves, like an egg split [in half]. They also say that images are real in being the per-ceived parts, and cognition is real in being the perceiving part. The master Jetāri reports [their position]:568 The consciousness appearing internally is other than this [exter-nal object], and what appears externally is also simply other than [the consciousness]. These two, however, are not a duality, because they are [both] simply reflexive awareness. Conceptual-ity, which arises through the force of those two, exaggeratedly considers them to be the two entities of percept and perceiver.Proponents of Perceptual Parity [bb''] [Others say that] the number of perceiving cognizers corresponds to the number of perceived images."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"1\u0018\u0018 C the treasury of knowledge[Proponents of Perceptual Parity]569 assert that the number of perceiving cognizers, which are discrete substances, equals the number of perceived images, which are discrete substances, such as white or red. In terms of appearances, many varieties of white or red manifest; in terms of what is real, those various570 [appearances] are real in being individual sub-stances. In the same way, the sense consciousnesses, which are the agents for appearances, are real in being multiple substantial entities. The Auto-Commentary for the “[Ornament of] the Middle Way” states:571 Some say that like pleasure and so forth, images such as blue and so forth are only of an experiential character. Those cognitions are multiple, and they are always of similar types. They arise in the same way that multiple dissimilar-type cognitions arise simultaneously.572 Non-Pluralists [cc''][Some] say that even though there are various appearances, the entity [of cognition] is not a plurality.[Non-Pluralists]573 assert that it is just a single cognition that appears as white, red, and so forth. Therefore, even though the various appearances manifest as multiple, they are real in being the entities of [a single,] part-less consciousness. Thus there is no plurality [of cognition]. This accords with the description [of their position] in the Auto-Commentary for the “[Ornament of] the Middle Way”:574They state that the entities of the varieties [of appearances] man-ifest from just a single consciousness, in the same way that [the various colors of] an onyx [appear].575Proponents of False Images [b'']This is discussed in two parts: a general explanation of their assertions; and their specific classifications."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 1\u00189A General Explanation of Their Assertions [i'']Proponents of False Images assert that, like [the floaters seen] by the visually impaired,appearances are nonexistents vividly appearing, unreal and false;only cognition empty of duality is real.Chittamātra Proponents of False Images (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa) state that all appearances of white, black, and so forth are nonexistents vividly appearing (med pa gsal snang), meaning that they appear while not existing, like the two moons seen when you press your eyes or the floaters seen by the visually impaired. In fact, they are not real but are false, like dreams and illusions; because, if [appearances] were real as cognition, objects (such as forms) would have to be cognizers (rig pa), which they are not. They assert that cognition empty of the duality of percept and per-ceiver is reflexively aware and self-illuminating (rang rig rang gsal), like a flawless crystal globe. It is not governed by referents and is not tainted by the stains of appearances. Only that [cognition empty of duality] is real.To summarize [their view], they say that cognition is untainted by the stains of appearances; [it is pure,] like a pure crystal globe.576 Appear-ances, like floaters, are false: even though they do not exist, they appear. Thus those who hold this position are known as Proponents of Nonexis-tent Images (Nirākāravādin, rNam med pa) or Proponents of False Images (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa).577Their Specific Classifications [ii'']Since [some] assert that appearances taint cognition and [some] do not,and [some] say that there are dualistic appearances on the bhūmi of buddhahood and [others] say there are not,there are the two divisions of Staining and Non-Staining. Some say that although consciousnesses are, in fact, the perceiving aspect of pleasure, pain, and so forth, the force of ignorance causes them to appear as outer perceived images, and thus the entity of consciousness is tainted by those false images. Therefore, they are called Proponents of Staining"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190 C the treasury of knowledgeFalse Images (Samala-alīkākāra, rNam rdzun dri bcas).578 Others state that ultimately the entity of consciousness is not tainted by outer images, that it is [pure,] like a pure crystal globe. Ordinary beings, however, do not realize this; it is realized only by buddhas. They are called Proponents of Non-Staining False Images (Nirmala-alīkākāra, rNam rdzun dri med).579There is another explanation for the two divisions of Staining [False Images] and Non-Staining [False Images]. • [Proponents of Staining False Images] say that what appears as white or red is present at the bhūmi of buddhahood; nevertheless, [buddhas] are not deluded because they realize what is false to be false. Therefore, the y say, “we do not state that referents and cognition are identical nor do we say that they are different.” [Proponents of Staining False Images] assert that there are dualistic appearances at the bhūmi of bud-dhahood. • [Proponents of Non-Staining False Images] say that if what appears as white or red were real in being the entity of cognition, it would appear also to buddhas, but it does not. They say, therefore, “Even though there is no connection between a cognition and a referent, [there are] appear-ances.” [Proponents of Non-Staining False Images] assert that there are no dualistic appearances at the bhūmi of buddhahood.580A Summary [of the Two Chittama ̄tra Subschools]Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images assert that everything that appears to the five sense consciousnesses as external referents is real in being the substance of the internal cognizer. Proponents of False Images say that everything that appears to the five sense consciousnesses as referents is not real in being the substance of the internal mind; rather, all is false and [only] imputedly existent. We should know that this accords with the explanations given by many scholars, such as Lakṣhmī.581 Karma Tinlé582 comments: Both Chittamātra [subschools] must be called Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins), or Chittamātras, because they assert each momentary, partless consciousness, which is free from percept and perceiver, to be ultimate reality.

Both [Chittamātra subschools] assert that reflexively aware, self-illuminat-ing cognition, which is without the duality of percept and perceiver, is ulti-mate. [In the ordinary state] it is covered by the obscurations of dualistic appearances; thus when the qualities of a noble being are attained, that [cognition] is simply free from dualistic appearances. Some Tibetans cite the teachings of the master Vasubandhu as a scrip-tural [source] for these [Chittamātra views]. This is simply the mistake of those who speak deviously by not distinguishing between [Vasubandhu’s] assertion that primordial wisdom is truly existent and [the Chittamātra system’s] statement that consciousness is truly existent. Ancillary Points [2'']This has two sections: the masters who assert those [Chittamātra posi-tions]; and the way this [Chittamātra view] is refuted.The Masters Who Assert Those [Chittamātra Positions] [a'']This is the system of five hundred past masters and others. There are Tibetans who say unanimously that with the exception of the Ornament of Clear Realization, all the other Dharma Treatises of Maitreya583 teach Chittamātra.584 Some assert that the Highest Continuum keeps to the meaning of the Madhyamaka. Others assert that the final wheel of dharma presents only Chittamātra, not Madhyamaka. They say, “Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu] were the co-founders of this chariot-system, and all their texts are Chittamātra. The Proponents of Real Images and of False Images and other [subdivisions] appeared among their followers. Dignāga585 and his son [Dharmakīrti]586 asserted the positions of both the Proponents of Real Images and the Proponents of False Images.”587 Some say, “The noble Nāgārjuna588 also asserted both those positions.” And oth-ers state, “Although Asaṅga was a Mādhyamika master, that does not con-flict with his having composed Chittamātra treatises, like Vasubandhu’s composition589 of the Treasury of Abhidharma.” There are many such state-ments expressing individual points of view."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"192 C the treasury of knowledgeThe great omniscient dharma lord of Jonang [Dolpopa]590 states:The final wheel of dharma and the middle [texts]591 of Maitreya’s Dharma Treatises do not present the Madhyamaka that Tibet-ans assert. These [texts] do, however, teach the Madhyamaka expounded by the Victor and his heirs. Tibetan assertions con-cerning the thought of the major texts of the noble [Nāgārjuna], such as his Collection of Reasonings,592 and similar works, are quite limited and by no means final. The great exalted one of Jonang and his followers maintain that Asaṅga and his brother were Madhyamaka masters and that their system of philo-sophical tenets is the Great Madhyamaka (dBu ma chen po). You may wonder, in that case, who were the founding masters of the Chittamātra system? [The founders and promulgators of the Chittamātra system] were five hundred Mahāyāna masters, great exalted ones of earlier times, such as Avitarka, and others.593 “Others” means some of their fol-lowers and some later Proponents of Mere Cognition (Vijñaptimātra).594 The Way This [Chittamātra View] Is Refuted [b'']All the flawed [assertions] of Realists are refuted by the texts of the noble [Nāgārjuna]. [Proponents of] False Images and [followers of the philosophical systems] below them assert that appearances are pervaded by delusion. Their posi-tions concerning delusion and actions and agents are such that they cannot comprehend that there is no truly existing substratum.595 They are, there-fore, referred to as Realists.596 Proponents of these lower [philosophical tenet systems] do—in relationship to a specific basis for negation [that they consider to be] truly existent—refute a specific object of negation that followers of a philosophical system lower than themselves imagine [to be truly existent]. Nevertheless, ultimately, all the flawed assertions in the Realists’ philosophical tenets are thoroughly refuted by the noble [Nāgārjuna’s] major texts, called the Collection of Reasonings,597 and [the works of] of his followers. [Those texts] elucidate a special feature of Madhyamaka: knowing how to posit actions and agents despite the nonex-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"chittama ̄tra c 193istence of a substratum for delusion.

The Differences Between Chittama ̄tra and Madhyamaka Some say that there are major differences between the Chittamātra and Madhyamaka [systems] in terms of ground, path, and result and in other ways. However, the principal distinction between these two Mahāyāna schools is that [Chittamātras] assert that reflexively aware, self-illumi-nating cognition, empty of the duality of percept and perceiver, exists ultimately and Mādhyamikas do not. When explaining the Chittamātra philosophical tenet system, the Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wis-dom599 and other texts say:600 Consciousness free from percept and perceiverexists ultimately.when explaining the Madhyamaka philosophical tenet system, these texts say:601 The wise do not assert that consciousness exists ultimately."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"7.

Thus they are called “Mādhyamikas.”604 In the Stacks of Jewels, [the Kāshyapa Chapter Sūtra] says:605 Do not think that phenomena are permanent. Do not think that they are impermanent. “Permanence” is one extreme and “impermanence” is a second extreme. The middle between two extremes cannot be analyzed and cannot be shown. It is not a support. It is devoid of appearance, devoid of cognition, and devoid of location.

They know that unexamined and unanalyzed appearances, regardless of how they seem to be, do not truly exist as entities. Simply as interdependent connections [appearing] on the conventional level, [Mādhyamikas] undertake exten-sive virtuous actions (such as generosity) and avoid unvirtuous actions—all the while [maintaining] their motivation of bodhichitta and an awareness that things are illusionlike. In this way they train themselves in the scrupu-lous observance of what is to be adopted and what is to be rejected.They encounter ultimate reality by knowing that actually there is noth-ing to adopt or reject, block or encourage, abandon or accept in any phe-nomenon.

Mādhyamikas, however, do not assert that the mere cessa-tion of the mental afflictions and the aggregates is nirvāṇa. They state that [nirvāṇa] is the unmistaken realization of the suchness (tattva, de kho na nyid) of all phenomena, both pure and impure, by means of the pacifica-tion of all conceptual elaborations. The Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way says:608 what is without abandonment, without attainment, without annihilation, without permanence,without cessation, and without arisingis said to be nirvāṇa. Praises of the Incomparable One says:609You know that afflictive phenomena and purified phenomena are of the same taste.Thus, you are inseparable from the dharmadhātu,and you are utterly and completely pure.There are many such statements.Nirvāṇa is presented as being twofold: with remainder and without remain-der.

Despite these many styles of classification, succinctly put, Madhyamaka is definitely of two types: Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Mantra-Madhyamaka.An Extensive Explanation [bb']This is discussed in two sections: the common Madhyamaka of the Sūtra system; and the profound Madhyamaka of Secret Mantra.The Common Madhyamaka of the Sūtra System [1'']This has two divisions: an overview: the names [of Madhyamaka schools]; and an extensive explanation: the characteristics [of Madhyamaka schools]."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"an overview of madhyamaka c 201An Overview: The Names [of Madhyamaka Schools] [a'']The Sūtra system comprises [the teachings of] the Proponents of the Absence of a Nature and the Yogāchāras,which correspond [respectively] to such terms as “ordinary” and “preeminent,” or “broad” and “subtle.”In Tibet, they are known as Rangtong and Shentong.Because of the slightly different systems, or styles, of commenting on the thought of the Mahāyāna sūtras, it is clear that there are two types [of Sūtra-Mādhyamikas]: (1) Mādhyamika Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāva-vādins),627 and(2) Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas.Some use the terms “ordinary Madhyamaka” and “preeminent Madhya-maka” for these systems.

The followers of Bhāvaviveka are called Svātantrikas because they assert, as a convention that is part of their own system, that all phenomena are without arising, are empty, and so forth. As proofs [of those assertions], they primarily use independently [verifiable] reasons632 in which the three modes633 are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.634The followers of Chandrakīrti are called Prāsaṅgikas, because they accept that [phenomena] are without arising, are empty, and so forth only from the perspective of others, which means that they commit to this only to refute others’ mistaken ideas. [For Prāsaṅgikas] there are no independently [verifiable] reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.

The reason of dependent origination, [used in] the analysis of mere appearances, eliminates both extremes.Thus [Svātantrikas and Prāsaṅgikas] do not disagree about the ultimate.SubjectFirst, the subject (dharmin, chos can) is the basis for debate.641 It is not something established by the valid cognitions642 of both the challenger and the opponent, and it can be something coarse, such as an entity, or something small, such as a sprout. In these systems, the subject belongs to the set heterologous643 to the probandum (sādhya, bsgrub bya), [and as such] is that which gives rise to reification."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"206 C the treasury of knowledgeObject of NegationWhen a subject is analyzed, the object to be negated (pratiṣhedhya, dgag bya) is determined to be either an appearance or something imagined (brtags pa). It is not logical, [however,] to negate momentary appearances (re zhig snang ba), because reasonings cannot negate them. To take an example: for people with eye diseases, the appearances of floaters,644 double moons, and the like do not stop as long as their eyesight is impaired. Similarly, as long as beings are not free from unafflicted ignorance,645 illusionlike appear-ances [manifesting] to the six modes of consciousness do not stop. It is not necessary to negate [appearances], because our mistakes646 do not come from appearances: they arise from fixating on those [appear-ances]. This is the case because if we do not fixate on appearances, we are not bound—we are like a magician who, having conjured up a young woman, has no attachment towards her. [On the other hand, if,] like naïve beings attached to an illusory young woman, we fixate intensely [on appearances], our karma and mental afflictions will increase. To intentionally negate appearances would be wrong because, if they were negated, emptiness would come to mean the [absolute] nonexistence of things. Another reason this would be a mistake is that yogins and yoginīs meditating on emptiness would fall into the extreme of nihilism since they would be applying their minds to a negation that [equals] the [absolute] nonexistence of everything. Thus, [Mādhyamikas] set out to negate only what is imagined (pari-kalpita, kun brtags pa), because that is what can be negated. Like a rope [mistaken] for a snake, what is imagined does not conform to facts: it is simply the mind’s fixations. [Dharmakīrti’s] Commentary on Valid Cognition provides a further reason:647 This [attachment] cannot be relinquishedwithout the object’s being invalidated. The characteristic of things is that the perceiving mind cannot be negated unless its object is negated; therefore, we will not be able to negate the intense fixation of our perceiving mind unless its imagined object is negated. Without negating that intense fixation, we will not reverse afflic-tive phenomena,648 because that [fixation] is their root.Therefore, the object of negation for Mādhyamikas is only something imagined. It is of two types:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"rangtong-madhyamaka c 207(1) objects whose existence even as a convention (tha snyad tsam du grub pa) is negated; and (2) objects whose existence as ultimate (don la grub pa) is negated but whose existence as a convention is not.The first type of object negated is a self either [of persons] or phenomena as imagined by proponents of our own [Buddhist] philosophical tenet sys-tems or by proponents of other philosophical tenet systems. These do not exist even in terms of conventional reality (as was explained above).649The second type of objects negated are the conventions of worldly consensus (’jig rten grags pa’i tha snyad), which are simply dependently originated according to their causes and conditions. These include things of immediate common consensus (such as [saying,] “I am going,” “I am staying,” or “I am eating”); and conventions that are suitable for common consensus, even though they may not be of things of immediate common consensus [now]. [The latter] are things about which there is common consensus in the [Buddhist] scriptures: causes and their results, the bhūmis and paths, factors to be abandoned and their remedies, and so forth.Things commonly accepted as worldly conventions are not to be refuted as mere conventions. The reason this is not done is the same as what was said above about eliminating [or refuting] appearances.650ProbandaThere are two kinds of probanda (sādhya, bsgrub bya): (1) proofs of facts (don sgrub pa); and(2) proofs of conventions (tha snyad sgrub pa).651Proofs of facts are of two types since debaters have different issues in question:(a) nonimplicative negations652 that [demonstrate that] the nature of a thing does not exist; and(b) nonimplicative negations that [demonstrate that] the object of nega-tion, just a nature, does not exist.653In these systems, the probandum is a nonimplicative negation that is sim-ply the refutation that a subject inherently exists, is real, and the like. It includes such nonimplicative negations as, “These appearances do not exist with a true nature,” or “They do not exist in the way that they are imag-"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"20\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeined to be.” [For Svātantrikas and Prāsaṅgikas, the probandum] is only an exclusion (viccheda, rnam gcod), merely the elimination of the object to be negated, and simply free from conceptual elaborations; they have no probandum that is something [positively] determined.654 Since they do not set forth any [affirmative probanda], there is also noth-ing that others could object to. In his Rebuttal of Objections, [Nāgārjuna] says:655 If I were to have a proposition,I would have that fault.Since I have no proposition,I am without fault.If [I] were to observe something throughdirect perception or any other [means of valid cognition],[I] would either affirm it or deny it.Since there are no such things, I am beyond censure.For these [systems,] the import of a nonimplicative negation is that it refers to nothing at all. It is said in the sūtras:whoever understands that phenomena do not exist at allwill not be attached to phenomena.This shows that once the power of terms and concepts has been exhausted, [one’s experience] will be like that of someone feeling rested after their hard work is over.The point of negations and affirmations is summed up by the following [example]: When sound is proven to be impermanent by [the reason that] it is something produced, the actual object negated is the consciousness that ascribes (sgro ’dogs pa) permanence to sounds, and the actual object affirmed is the consciousness that ascribes impermanence to sound. This is the intention of Nāgārjuna’s statement:656 [Such statements] make us understand that no nature exists; they do not, however, eliminate arising."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"rangtong-madhyamaka c 209ReasonsThe means of proof are the reasons (hetu, gtan tshigs). In Madhyamaka reasonings, generally speaking, the evidence (liṅga, rtags) is presented in two ways:(1) by setting up negations (pratiṣheda, dgag pa), or(2) by setting up affirmations (viddhi, sgrub pa).First: Negations(1) Ne gation through the analysis of causes is called the “vajra sliver [reasoning].”657(2) Negation by means of analyzing results refutes the arising of [a result] existent [at the time of its cause] and the arising of [a result that is] nonexistent [at the time of its cause].658 (3) Negation that employs the analysis of both causes and their results refutes arising from the four possibilities.659(4) Negation that analyzes a nature [demonstrates that a phenom-enon] is neither a single unit nor a plurality.660The first type of negation is taught in the Rice Seedling Sūtra661 and the last kind is presented in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra. The two middle ones appear in certain sūtras.662 These four eliminate the Realists’663 inflated ascription of inherent existence to things, thereby removing [their belief in] the extreme of existence. Now we will look at these four in order.664 (1) The analysis of causeswhen a sprout comes into being (skye ba), does it arise from itself? From something other than itself? From both? Or from no cause at all? This kind of analysis proves that, from a rational perspective, a sprout has no arising since it does not arise from anything at all.665 (2) The analysis of results when a sprout arises, is this the arising of something that exists at the time of the seed? Or is this the arising of something that did not exist [at the time of its cause]? If it were the arising of something that existed at the time of the seed, a sprout would not arise from the seed: its cause would serve no purpose,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210 C the treasury of knowledgesince the sprout already exists without depending on a cause. If it were the arising of something that did not exist [at the time of its cause], then it would be like the horns of a rabbit and its cause would have no potency (nus pa) at all.666 These reasonings refute [the possibility] that a combination of both is the case. It also is impossible [that a sprout arises] from neither being the case. [This analysis], therefore, proves that, in actuality, a sprout does not come into being.(3) The analysis of both causes and resultsFrom a mistaken perspective, it is not contradictory to make statements such as the following: “One sprout develops from one seed.” “A single eye consciousness arises from the three conditions.”667 “One father produces many children.” “A variety of crops grow from the combination of seeds, water, and manure.” Nevertheless, from a rational perspective, the follow-ing four possibilities [for arising] are not feasible: (a) that only one result manifests from just a single cause;(b) that numerous results are produced by only one cause;(c) that a single result comes from many causes; and(d) that many results could arise from many causes. Thus, from a rational perspective, a unity is untenable, and that also negates that a plurality could truly exist; thus it is proven that there is no arising. (4) The analysis of a natureReasons stating that a sprout and other things are devoid of both real unity and real plurality prove that such things have no reality (bden med). This reasoning that something is neither a single unit nor a plurality is the root of all reasonings that negate true existence, which all four Buddhist philosophical systems [consider] to be the object of negation. It is taught that the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way is summarized by its refu-tation of eight points: arising and cessation, permanence and annihilation, going and coming, sameness and discreteness. The negations of the first six points depend upon the negation of sameness and discreteness (gcig dang tha dad), and the refutation of sameness and discreteness is simply [the argument] that no thing is a single unit or a plurality.668"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"rangtong-madhyamaka c 211[Second: Affirmations]Affirmations are set up as evidence in the following way. The reasoning of dependent origination669 is an analysis of mere appearances, and it is found in the Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta Sūtra.670 The reasoning that something is dependently originated proves that [the thing in question,] such as a sprout, has no reality. Its manner of presentation causes it to be categorized as an affirming reason; but, in fact, since it refutes reality, which is the object to be negated, it is a negating reason. This is the king of the reasonings used by Mādhyamikas to prove that things are empty of reality (bden stong), because it eliminates both the extreme of permanence and that of nihilism. Since [phenomena] are dependently originated, they are not nonexistent as conventions; and thus the extreme of nihilism is avoided. [Phenomena also] are not objects that are permanent nor do they exist in terms of their own essence, because they depend on other causes and conditions. This establishes that [phenomena] have no nature and eliminates the extreme of permanence.Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta Sūtra says:The wise realize that all phenomena are dependently originated.They do not adhere to views involving extremes. In the context of these [reasonings], it is impossible that a nature of things is a knowable object; and, therefore, there is no negative entailment,671 since there is no link between what is to be pervaded and a pervader.672 Nevertheless, in general, [Mādhyamikas may make statements] such as, “If a pot were to exist, it would follow that it must be either a unitary pot or a plurality.” They also may use illusions, reflections, and so forth as concor-dant examples (mthun dpe). The object of comprehension (prameya, gzhal bya) for an inferential [cognition] based on such reasons is the probandum of these reasons [i.e., that all things have no nature].Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas do not disagree about these modes or the state of ultimate reality."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 C the treasury of knowledgeThe Explanation of Their Differences [(2)]They differ over many issues: conventional [reality], statements in debate, and other points.Both Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas discuss the two truths. They do not dis-agree in the slightest way about ultimate reality (as was just mentioned), because if they were to, it would follow that one of them would not be Mādhyamikas, since the abiding nature of things is not multiple. Differences Concerning Conventional RealityThey do disagree, however, about the presentation of conventional real-ity. Svātantrikas think that this should not be done according to the con-ventions of worldly people, because that would involve the possibility of error, as worldly people use conventions in a casual way without any rational analysis. Instead, they posit conventional [reality] in keeping with those who know how to apply reasonings, such as Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) or Sautrāntikas. They maintain that even though Propo-nents of Cognition and the others have deviated from [a correct under-standing of] ultimate reality, they have not done so with conventional reality. Prāsaṅgikas say that someone who lacks the natural ability to climb trees and yet persists in doing so in a peculiar way—by letting go of a lower branch before grabbing hold of a higher one—will get nowhere, but will instead fall into the space between the branches. Similarly, Real-ists who, in their quest for suchness, put aside worldly conventions when they have not yet realized the true reality (yang dag pa’i don), will fall in between: into either the extreme of permanence or that of nihilism. Prāsaṅgikas state that Realists have deviated from [a correct understand-ing of] both truths, citing as their reason [Chandrakīrti’s] statement in his Entrance to the Middle Way:673Those outside the path of the master Nāgārjunalack the means for [achieving] peace.They have strayed from the conventional truth and that of suchness.Having strayed from those two truths, they will not attain liberation."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"rangtong-madhyamaka c 213Prāsaṅgika masters, therefore, think that conventional reality should be posited according to the conventions of worldly people, not according to the proponents of other philosophical systems. This is because, in the same way that noble beings are the only valid authorities (pramāṇa, tshad ma) for ultimate reality, worldly people are the only valid authorities for the positing of conventional reality. In sum, worldly people say, “A result comes from a cause,” and under-stand it in just those [terms], without trying to analyze [whether the result arises] from itself, something other than itself, and so forth. Prāsaṅgikas’ presentation of conventional [reality] accords with that [kind of general worldly understanding].Differences Concerning the Acceptance of ConventionsPrāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas differ regarding the acceptance of conven-tions (vyavahāra, tha snyad). Svātantrikas accept conventional reality as a [pragmatic] convention within their own system. Prāsaṅgikas, however, do not present anything as their own system either on the ultimate level or as a convention. Nevertheless, if it is called for, they will accept conven-tional reality—but only on the terms of worldly people. They do not accept it as part of their own system even as a mere [pragmatic] convention, cit-ing the same text as their reason:674We do not accept conventional [reality]in the way you [Chittamātras] assert dependent entities. Nevertheless, we say, “Things exist,” even though they do not,[deferring] to the world’s perspective for the sake of the results.Differences in DebateWhen engaged in debate, Svātantrika masters assert that not presenting a system of one’s own and only refuting others’ systems is [sheer] sophistry675 and, therefore, unacceptable. They say that if one does not establish one’s own positions—emptiness, nonarising, and so forth—through valid forms of cognition,676 one will be unable, simply by setting up consequences, to refute others’ assertions that entities inherently arise. For these two reasons, they say that, as a convention, one should assert some points of one’s own system that are established through valid forms of cognition; and such points would include the reasons and examples that prove one’s own thesis (pratijñā, dam"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214 C the treasury of knowledgebca’) that there is no arising. This must be done because one cannot prove the thesis of one’s own system using the reasons asserted by others. Prāsaṅgikas say, “Those who have a thesis but do not posit it out of the fear that they will be subjected to others’ criticism, and those who refute another’s system with aggressive intentions using only [absurd] consequences are involved in a deceptive practice of sophistry. However, given that the Madhyamaka [system] does not have even the smallest position of its own to posit, what would be the point of troubling ourselves to search for a means to prove it? Actually, [the Madhyamaka approach] is not about refuting things. If we could observe a phenomenon to be negated, no matter how insignifi-cant, it would be reasonable to refute it; but if we cannot observe a thing to be negated—not even the fragment left from splitting a hair’s end a hundred times—how can we talk about negating it?” This accords with the opening statement in the Entrance to the Wisdom [of the Middle Way]:677 It is only negation and affirmation that are negated.In fact, there is nothing to be negated or affirmed. Prāsaṅgikas say that they present others’ assertions in their treatises and analyze them rationally in numerous ways, not because they despise these other systems or take pleasure in debating, but for the sake of others: to overturn the reification of people trapped in conceptual nets. The Entrance to the Middle Way says:678 The analyses in the Treatise are not presented out of fondness for debate.Suchness is taught for the sake of liberation.If others’ scriptural systems collapsewhen suchness is presented, we are not to blame.Each and every rational analysis found in the Madhyamaka treatises has the same objective: to overturn the concepts of superimposition or denial held by other parties.679 But once their superimpositions and denials are elimi-nated, realization of the reality of the abiding nature will not arise through the force of analysis, because the abiding nature is not an object that can be analyzed by means of study or reflection. The same text states:680"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"rangtong-madhyamaka c 215Ordinary beings are bound by their concepts.Yogins and yoginīs without concepts are liberated.The wise, therefore, teach that the overturning of conceptsis the fruit of analysis.Not only is there nothing for others to challenge in the Prāsaṅgika sys-tem, this system can invalidate everyone else’s positions (prakṣha, phyogs), because, in their attempts to dispel their faults, all the answers they give to the Prāsaṅgika’s reasonings are ineffective since [their answers are proofs that] are equivalent to their probandum.681 In brief, Prāsaṅgikas do not assert that there are independently verifi-able reasons that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things, because [for them] there are no forms of valid cognition that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things that could prove such [reasons]. When, for the sake of others, they engage in negations and affirmations as one of two parties in debate, they employ four types of reasons and four valid means of cognition that are commonly acknowledged in the world.682 Svātantrikas accept that there are reasons and forms of valid cognition that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things, which [means that they are] independently verifiable.683 Thus, the former [i.e., Prāsaṅgikas] have no probandum that is something [positively] determined;684 they simply refute what others assert. Svātantrikas refute others’ assertions by employing reasonings capable of cutting through conceptual elaborations, which are reasonings whose three modes are established by valid forms of cognition.Further DifferencesThe phrase “other points” in this root verse refers to the numerous minor differences between these two systems.• In the context of the ground, some points of difference are that Prāsaṅgikas do not assert that conventional [reality] is classified as either correct or mistaken, true or false, whereas Svātantrikas do.685 Prāsaṅgikas assert that all objects are false and all states of minds (blo) are deluded, whereas Svātantrikas do not. • In terms of the path, some of their minor differences include that dur-ing periods of study or reflection, Prāsaṅgikas do not prove a proban-dum that remains after an object of negation has been refuted, whereas"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"216 C the treasury of knowledgeSvātantrikas do. Prāsaṅgikas do not state that they accept a view, Svātantrikas do.• As for the result, some Svātantrikas believe that tathāgatas possess an illusionlike primordial wisdom that is a complete transformation (gnas gyur pa), and that conventional [reality] appears to them as illusionlike, but they are not deluded because they do not take [such appearances] to be real. Thus they say that impure karmic appearances exist for buddhas. Prāsaṅgikas assert that since appearances manifest from the habitual tendencies of unafflicted ignorance, they are delusive.

Chandrakīrti’s system is exceptional and preeminent for eradicating the conceptual elaborations associated with characteristics (mtshan ma’i spros pa), and he is a prime example of the Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamika. This system does not formulate independently [verifiable] probative reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things. In order to refute the mistaken views of others, it accepts nonarising, emptiness, and so forth from the perspective of others, and it simply uses consequences to demonstrate to Realists their internal contradictions.

Those three consequences (b-d) will prove the subject property and the entailment (which are commonly acknowledged by oth-ers) for your opponents’ minds. Now you can use reasons based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a) to generate an inferential valid cognition in your opponents’ minds.As we can see, it is explained that these four reasonings, which are unique to Prāsaṅgikas, are related to the negation of arising from each of the four extremes.722 Since they are the main reasonings, I will discuss them now in some detail. [The Vajra Sliver Argument and the Four Reasons][Refutation of arising from self]First, we will look at the Sāṃkhyas’723 belief that things arise from them-selves. They assert that their statement, “Things arise from themselves,” means that only things that exist at the time of their cause arise and that things that do not exist [at the time of their cause] do not arise. Sesame oil, they say, serves as an illustration: the reason sesame oil appears is that it already exists within sesame seeds, and the reason sesame oil does not appear from sand is that it does not already exist within sand. Prāsaṅgikas use the four reasonings to negate their position as follows. • Prāsaṅgikas begin by saying, “It follows that for things, the subject, aris-ing is pointless, because they already exist at the time of their causes.” That is a consequence that exposes [the opponents’] contradictions (b).• Sāṃkhyas then may say, “The entailment is not definite.”724 Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “It follows that things would arise endlessly, because even though something is already present, it can arise.” That is a comparable application of [the opponents’] reason (c).• Next, Sāṃkhyas may say, “Those two [cases] are not comparable for the following reason.725 It is the pot that [is present] during the phase of the lump of clay that arises; [an already] manifestly perceptible pot does not arise [again]. These two are different: one is something manifestly perceptible and the other is not.” Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “Referring to"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 227the existence of ‘the pot not manifestly perceptible during the clay-lump phase’ is equivalent to your original probandum.”726 That is [a demon-stration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “All outer and inner things, the subject, do not arise from themselves, because they [already] exist.” That is [the employment of] inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).727[Refutation of arising from other]In our [Buddhist] schools, there are Realists728 who accept that phenomena arise from something other than themselves.729 • Prāsaṅgikas start with, “It follows that a seed and its sprout are not inherently different from each other, because a sprout arises from a seed.” That is a consequence that exposes [the opponents’] contradictions (b).• Realists may say, “The entailment is not definite.”730 Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “In that case, it follows that pitch-darkness could arise from flames, because even though something is inherently different from something else, it can arise [from that other thing].” That is a compa-rable application of [the opponents’] reason (c).• Realists may counter with, “There is a difference between something that has the potential to produce [a result] and something that does not.” Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “This is equivalent to your original pro-bandum.”731 That is [a demonstration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “A sprout does not arise from a seed, because a seed and a sprout are inherently different from each other.” That is [the employment of] inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).[Refutation of arising from both]Nirgranthas [that is, Jains]732 assert that phenomena arise from both them-selves and things other than themselves. They say that a clay pot’s arising from the essential character of the clay is the sense in which it arises from itself. Its arising from the potter, a rope, water, and other factors is the sense in which it arises from something other than itself.

Prāsaṅgikas reply, “This is equivalent to your original probandum.” That is [a demonstration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “This world, the subject, does not arise without causes, because it arises sometimes.”737 That is [the employment of] infer-ences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).[The Two Truths]A mind that discerns conventions is necessarily a mistaken cognition.Correct and mistaken conventional [realities] are equal in their performance and nonperformance of functions. The presentation of the two truths is determined by the presence of delusion and its absence. In sum, this is the final exegesis of the Collection of Reasonings.In this system, a mind that discerns conventions is necessarily a mistaken cognition. The Commentary on Bodhichitta says:738"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 229when we awaken from a dream [we see thatdream objects and waking objects] do not differ in their performance of functions. As is said, horses and elephants in dreams or illusions and actual horses and elephants, as well as cows in drawings and actual cows, are equiva-lent in the way that they perform functions from a mistaken perspective. They are also equivalent in not performing [functions] from a rational perspective. In terms of the things of worldly conventionality and yogic conventionality, [things are said] to be mistaken or correct; however, that is not [Chandrakīrti’s] system.739 His system asserts that there is nothing correct or mistaken in terms of yogic conventionality and, therefore, [yogic conventionality] is mere [conventionality].740The criteria for positing the two truths is as follows. • The essence of conventionality is the false appearances that [manifest] to a mind involved with delusion. • The essence of the ultimate is what appears to an undeluded mind. The first [conventional reality] is defined as the object found (rnyed don) by false seeing. The bases for this definition (mtshan gzhi) are, broadly, ignorance; specifically, taking [things] to be real; and, more particularly, the ignorance present in the mindstreams of ordinary beings. The latter [ultimate reality] is defined as the object found by correct seeing. The basis for this definition is the opposite of ignorance: it is pri-mordial wisdom, which directly realizes the absence of reality. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:741 All entities found bear two natures,owing to being seen correctly or falsely.It is taught that the object of correct seeing is suchness;[the object of] false seeing is conventional reality.The same [text] says:742 Those afflicted by eye diseases discernmistaken entities, such as floaters and so forth."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"230 C the treasury of knowledgePerfect vision sees their nature.This is the way to understand suchness here.The meaning [of these verses] is as follows. • Conventional reality is defined as what appears as the diversity of dependently originated [phenomena] through the power of ignorance. • The ultimate is defined as the expanse of the noble ones’ primordial wisdom, in which such appearances are not seen. These are illustrated as follows: the appearance of floaters is an analogy for conventionality; that beings without eye diseases do not see those [float-ers] in any way is an analogy for the ultimate.To sum this up, most Tibetan scholars assert that this system is the final exegesis of the thought expressed in the Collection of Madhyamaka Rea-sonings.743A General Description of the Model Texts’ Exposition of Madhyamaka [(ii)]This is discussed in two parts: a general statement; and the specific expla-nation.A General Statement [(aa)]Scholars say, “In the system of the noble father and son, which serves as the model for all [Madhyamaka] texts,the fundamental topic of profound emptiness is explained in terms of the three phases.”Tak-tsang Lotsāwa744 and most scholars after him agree in saying, “The heart of the tathāgatas’ dharma is the unerring fundamental topic of pro-found emptiness. when this is explained in the system of the noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva], which serves as the model (phyi mo) for the Madhyamaka textual tradition, it is related to three phases: (1) the phase of no examination or analysis; (2) the phase when rational minds745 analyze slightly; and(3) the phase of superb analysis, which goes beyond verbal expression."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 231Since this makes the explanation and practice [of emptiness] quite easy, it is a genuine key instruction.” The Specific Explanation [(bb)]The ground, the sphere of conduct, and the result are presentedin accord with conventional expressions from a perspective of no analysis.The absence of self-entity and the ultimate are presented from the perspective of slight analysis.Superb analysis is the pacification of all conceptual elaborations. [Three perspectives can be distinguished] in the teachings of the middle wheel of dharma generally and in the texts of the father Nāgārjuna and his son specifically. [First: No Analysis]The ground (the aggregates, constituents, and sense spheres), the path (the sphere of conduct and methods), and the result (the kāyas, awak-ened activities, and so forth) are presented according to the expressions of worldly conventionality, that is, in terms of what is commonly understood from a perspective of no examination or analysis. Most of these topics accord with worldly conventionalities, either as things that are part of worldly consensus or as things that are suitable to become so.746 Some topics, however, [only] accord with yogic conventionalities, such as the way things appear during meditative equipoise and the subsequent state of attainment.747 [Second: Slight Analysis]The sections of teachings that refute the two self-entities (the objects to be negated) and then expound nonarising, emptiness, and ultimate real-ity are presented from the perspective of a rational mind that analyzes slightly. [Third: Superb Analysis]Many teachings, such as the majority of explicit statements in the Mother [Sūtras],748 say that nothing exists in any way: not as something existent, nonexistent, permanent, impermanent, empty, not empty, or the like. They"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"232 C the treasury of knowledgealso say that nothing is suitable to be apprehended as anything at all. [This perspective is also expressed] in the first three lines of the following quota-tion from the Fundamental Treatise [on the Middle Way, Called] Wisdom:749Do not say “it is empty”;do not state “it is not empty.”Also do not say that it is both nor neither.[Such terms] should [only] be used as [conventional] designations.By explaining these and the many similar passages in relationship to the phase of superb analysis, [the teachings] do not contradict each other in any way. The Entrance to the Wisdom of the Middle Way says:750 In the primordial, unborn state,there is nothing to be negated and nothing to be affirmed.Transcending misery (nirvāṇa) and not are undifferentiated in the unborn state.Even nonarising itself is not so,because arising things do not exist.Conventionality does not exist, nor does the ultimate.Buddhas do not exist, nor do sentient beings.There is no view and no meditation;no conduct and no result.The import of that is what is to be meditated upon.Let the nonconceptual mind remain in its own peace.without identifying anything or being distracted, meditate with clarity, free from characteristics.[T hat expresses] the phase of thorough analysis, which is the final position of Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamikas. It is necessary to relate [the teachings on emptiness] to three phases for the following reasons. To begin with, we counteract nonmeritorious acts and proceed on the path to the higher states by taking up what is virtuous and"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 233turning away from what is negative. This does not require examination or analysis. In the middle, we reverse our belief in the two types of self-entity and progress on the path to liberation through practice that involves slight analysis. Finally, we eliminate all conceptual elaborations associated with a view and reach the end of the path to omniscience through the practice of superb analysis. Thus it is explained. The Specific Explanation of Ground, Path, and Result [in Madhyamaka] [(iii)]This is discussed in three sections: ground Madhyamaka: the unity of the two truths; path Madhyamaka: the unity of method and wisdom; and resul-tant Madhyamaka: the unity of the two kāyas.Ground Madhyamaka: The Unity of the Two Truths [(aa)]In this section, there are two parts: the actual [presentation of the two truths]; and the explanation of the way [the two truths] are established.The Actual [Presentation of the Two Truths] [(1')] It is taught that worldly conventional [reality] is the methodand ultimate reality is what develops from that method.It is taught that conventional reality—which is whatever is commonly accepted as a convention in the world and talked about during the phase of no analysis using conceptual designations—is the method for realizing the ultimate. Ultimate reality is what develops from that method.751 For Mādhyamikas, [the two truths] are the ground for [understanding] know-able objects. The way of unifying [an understanding of] the two truths is described in the words of the early Tibetan [masters]: Since there are appearances, we do not disregard the path of karma.Since they are empty, fixations do not arise.The unification of the two truths is the middle path.Heed this unerring, supreme [approach]."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"234 C the treasury of knowledgeThe Explanation of the Way [the Two Truths] Are Established [(2')]For conventionality, [Prāsaṅgikas] cite what is commonly acknowledged by others in the world.As a general presentation of conventional [reality], which is the phenom-ena ascertained [in the world], [Prāsaṅgikas] simply cite that which is com-monly accepted by others, such as valid and invalid means of cognition, or what is true and false in terms of correct and mistaken [conventionalities], all of which are part of worldly consensus. [Prāsaṅgikas] do not cite flawed philosophical tenet systems, such as those that assert permanence, nihilism, partless particles, or a truly existent cognition empty of duality.In terms of the ultimate, [Prāsaṅgikas] use five types of reasons to prove the absence of a self-entity of phenomenaand a sevenfold reasoning to prove the absence of a self of persons. The first type of valid cognizer to ascertain ultimate reality is an inferen-tial [valid cognizer], which is a rational mind that is a special outcome of reflection. [Inferential valid cognition] is based on reasons,752 of which there are many divisions. If we summarize these, [in this context,] they are, in fact, definitely only negating reasons: refutations of reality, which is the object to be negated. It is not possible that [Prāsaṅgikas] use affirming reasons as they are used in the field of logic (rtog ge). Even when they say, “[Phenomena] are illusionlike because they are dependently originated,” [it is a negating reason]. The manner of presentation may make it seem that that is an affirming reason, but [if it were used in that way,] it would not result in the ascertainment of the ultimate. What [this reason] proves, in actuality, is the emptiness of reality (bden stong nyid), [and, therefore, it is a negating reason]. Negating ReasonsThere are two types of negating reasons (dgag rtags): (1) reasons of the imperception of something connected [to the predi-cate of the negandum],753 and"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 235(2) reasons of the perception of something contradictory [to the predi-cate of the negandum].754 The reason of dependent origination is the second kind of reason, and the other [four reasons] are the first type. The five great reasons are common to both the Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika systems.755 Here [in the Prāsaṅgika system], only these five (which include the reason that a phenomenon is neither a single unit nor plurality by analyzing its nature) are used to prove the nonexistence of a self-entity of phenomena. There is one reason that proves the absence of a self of persons and brings ascertainment of the ultimate: the sevenfold reasoning that uses the analogy of a chariot. This is the king of reasonings that prove the nonexistence of a self of persons. The Five Great ReasonsFirst we will look at the five reasons in detail. (1) The analysis of a nature: the reason of being neither a unity nor a pluralityThe analysis of a phenomenon’s nature, which proves that it is neither a single unit nor a plurality, demonstrates emptiness as [one of three] doors to liberation.756[First:] The formulation of the reason All phenomena (such as sprouts), the subject, do not really exist, because they are devoid of real unity or plurality. An example of this is a reflection in a mirror. [Second: The modes of the proof]• The subject of this reason is a mere appearance that is neither examined nor analyzed. • The subject property that applies to this [subject]: [a mere appearance] is not a real unity because it has parts. It is not a real plurality because there are no real single units that are the building blocks [of a plurality]. • The entailment: if something were real, it would necessarily be either a single unit or a plurality. This [entailment] is established because those two [possibilities] are mutually exclusive, something that is accepted by [all Realists].757"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236 C the treasury of knowledge(2) The analysis of causes: the vajra sliver reasoningThe analysis of a phenomenon’s cause [employs] the vajra-sliver-like rea-son,758 which shatters the Realists’ rocky mountain of wrong views. It dem-onstrates the absence of characteristics (animitta, mtshan ma med pa) as a door to liberation.First: The formulation of the reasonA sprout, the subject, does not really arise, because it does not arise from itself, from something other than itself, from both, or from neither. An example of this is a reflection.Second: The modes of the proofThe entailment will always pertain to one of the four extremes [for arising, regardless of whether the assertion being refuted states that a thing] arises owing to the power of [real] things (dngos stobs), arises from the side of the object, or arises from the perspective of analysis.759 Since [Nāgārjuna] considered this easy to understand, [he] did not discuss it in great detail in his [Fundamental] Treatise [on the Middle Way].760The proof of the subject property has four parts:(a) Establishing the reason that things do not arise from themselves Sāṃkhyas assert that a sprout is simply a manifestation of the principal substance (pradhāna, gtso bo), and that the principal substance is the pri-mal matter (prakṛiti, rang bzhin).761 Therefore, a sprout arises from its own primal matter, an already existing permanent entity. [Prāsaṅgikas refute this, saying that] if that were the case a seed would arise endlessly, since it would not be feasible that the force of a sprout’s arising should cause a seed to cease. If [Sāṃkhyas] were to assert that a seed (the cause) does not cease, its result, that is, a sprout’s arising and its own colors and shapes, could never materialize. If something were to arise from itself, agents and their effects would be the same. (b) Establishing the reason that phenomena do not arise from something other than themselvesRe alist scholars say, “The way the Sāṃkhya’s assertion that things arise from themselves is refuted is fine, but it is established by valid forms of"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 237cognition that phenomena arise from things other than themselves. This is because object-consistent consciousnesses arise from the four conditions,762 and because most [other] entities arise from their causal and dominant conditions.763 Causes and their results are not simply conceptual designa-tions, they exist from their own sides. [Results are seen] to arise [from causes even] when they are thoroughly examined and analyzed.” Although there are many reasonings that negate this position, they come down to the following two points:(i) It is impossible for things to arise from something other than themselves. (ii) Otherness is impossible in [the framework of] arising.764(i) [It is impossible for things to arise from something other than themselves] [If phenomena were to arise from something other than themselves, it would follow that] from all things that are not causes of something, phe-nomena that are not their results would arise, because, [for example,] a barley seed and a rice seed are equivalent in being other than a rice sprout, [and this otherness] is established through their own natures (rang gi ngo bo nas grub pa).765 [The reason] entails [the consequence,] because for things to be other, they [must] be present concurrently without depending upon each other, like [an animal’s] left and right horns; and if such things were in a cause and result [relationship]—even while being [different from each other] in that way—there would be no reason why a rice seed, which is a substantial [cause],766 should not produce a barley sprout.(ii) Otherness is impossible in the framework of arisingThose who assert that a sprout arises from a seed cannot possibly also assert that those two are different, discrete substances, for the following [reasons]. The otherness of substances is established from the objects’ own side, which is not possible when [two things] are not simultaneous; and the simultaneity of a cause and its result is logically refuted. The cessation of a cause and the arising of its result cannot possibly occur simultaneously, like the rising and falling of a scale’s beam.767 Furthermore, the simultaneity of a cause and its result is refuted by examining whether the result produced is existent [at the time of its cause] or not existent [at that time].768"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"23\u0018 C the treasury of knowledge(c) Establishing the reason that phenomena do not arise from both [themselves and things other than themselves]Since the refutation [of arising from both self and other] is implicit in the [previous] two refutations, [the texts generally] do not present this in detail.(d) The refutation of causeless [arising][The assertion that phenomena] arise without causes elicits the absurd consequences that entities would arise all the time, or that they would never arise. Like [other causeless phenomena, such as] lotuses [growing] in the sky, [which do not appear, all phenomena] would not be suitable to appear—but that contradicts our perception of causes and their effects as being clearly evident. Certain flawed philosophical systems maintain that the nonexistence of past and future lives has been proven, and thus they regard [both] body and mind to be of the nature of the elements. It is taught extensively that [such notions] are [merely] the product of mis-taken direct perception that apprehends the elements.(3) The analysis of results: the negation of the arising of an existent or a nonexistentThe analysis of results (which is an extension of the refutation of arising from something other) refutes the arising of [a result that is] existent [at the time of its cause] and the arising of [a result that is] nonexistent [at the time of its cause]. It demonstrates the absence of expectancy (apraṇihita, smon pa med pa) as a door to liberation. Some may ask, “what is the result that arises: is it something that exists at the time of its cause or something that does not exist at such time?” Although Svātantrikas purportedly accept the latter [position] as a con-vention, [the refutations of these positions] are well established for the following reasons. If a result were to exist at the time of its cause, since it already exists in dependence on something else, what would its cause do? If [a result] were something completely nonexistent, again its cause would do nothing, as in the case of the horns of a rabbit. A combination of both [possibilities] is also not tenable."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 239(4) The analysis of both causes and results: the negation of arising from the four possibilities The analysis of both a cause and its result refutes arising from the four possibilities.769 As was stated above,770 from a mistaken perspective, it is not contradictory to make statements such as, “One sprout develops from one seed.” However, from a rational perspective, arising from any of the four possibilities—such as only one result manifesting from just a single cause—is untenable, since, in rational terms, a unity is not feasible, and that negates that a plurality could truly exist.(5) The king of reasonings: the reason of dependent origination The great reason of dependent origination is the king of reasonings used by Mādhyamikas to prove the absence of any reality. The Fundamental Treatise [on the Middle Way] says:771 whatever arises dependentlyis in its very nature a state of peace.[An example of such reasoning is] the statement, “A sprout, the subject, does not truly exist, because it arises dependently.” This [reasoning is applied] in two ways: (1) to eliminate the extreme of permanence, and (2) to eliminate the extreme of nihilism. (1) Ou ter and inner entities, the subject, do not exist ultimately, because they are dependently originated.(2) Th ose [entities], the subject, are not nonexistent conventionally, because they are dependently originated. Prāsaṅgikas assert that these five reasonings are commonly acknowledged by others, whereas Svātantrikas state that they are independently [verifi-able] reasonings. To state this briefly: in the [Prāsaṅgika] system, arising from any of the four ways (self, other, and so forth) does not exist in the slightest, but since it is commonly understood in the world that arising exists, [Prāsaṅgikas] explain it accordingly. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:772 Having simply sown a seed,worldly beings say, “I produced this boy,”"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"240 C the treasury of knowledgeor think, “I planted a tree.”Therefore, even in the world, arising from something other does not exist.The Reasoning that Proves the Absence of a Self of PersonsThe sevenfold reasoning [that uses the analogy of] a chariot proves the absence of a self of persons.773 The Entrance [to the Middle Way] states:774 A chariot is not considered to be other than its parts.It is not identical [with them,] nor does it possess them. It is not in its parts, nor are the parts within it.It is not the mere assembly nor the overall shape.In addition to the fivefold [analysis775 that begins with seeing that] a char-iot is not something other than its parts (such as the nails), [Chandrakīrti] examines the collection [of parts] and the overall shape [of the chariot]. If we investigate [a chariot] using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is the parts themselves nor will we find that it is something other than those [parts]. Similarly, if we look for a self using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is something other than the aggregates nor will we find that it is the aggregates themselves. In this [analysis of the chariot], the overall shape and the collection are refuted implicitly, since they cannot be found apart from that which has the shape (dbyibs can) or that which is the collection (tshogs pa can).[The Actual Ultimate]The actual ultimate is beyond the intellect; elaborations do not apply to it.Cutting through elaborations, such as eliminating the eight extremes, is [itself] simply a convention. What is proven by these reasons is not, for example, an affirmation of the ultimate through the process of other-exclusion776 on a conventional level. This is because mental elaborations do not apply to the actual ultimate (don dam pa dngos nyid), since it is far beyond being an object of the intellect (blo), or an object of terms and concepts. Therefore, techniques777 such as"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 241eliminating the elaborations of the eight extremes—arising and cessation, permanence and annihilation, going and coming, sameness and discrete-ness—are [themselves] elaborations. In order to cut through the elabora-tions of conventionality, they are used simply as conventional expressions in keeping with what is commonly acknowledged by others. A thesis is [the creation of] the intellect; the intellect is conventional.Therefore, there are no independently [verifiable] theses or assertions.Even nonarising and so forth are not a thesis,because they [simply] banish fixation to never-existent entities.It is taught that once [reification] is overturned, clinging to nonentities must be renounced.A thesis, whatever it may be, is the creation of the intellect, and the intel-lect is a conventional, mistaken cognition. Therefore, for Prāsaṅgikas, there are no independently [verifiable] theses or assertions. Even nonaris-ing, freedom from elaborations, and so forth are not put forth as indepen-dently [verifiable] theses for the following [two] reasons. (1) Although phenomena, persons, and so forth (which are verbally stated) have never existed, non-Buddhist and Buddhist Realists fixate upon them as [real] entities, because they have fallen into the extremes of superimposition or denial.778 [Reasonings that demonstrate nonarising and so forth are stated only] to banish such [unwarranted] reification. (2) Once that reification is overturned, the intellect that clings to nonentities also must be renounced; and thus it is taught that [the ultimate] is beyond the intellect and without any clinging. This corresponds to Shāntideva’s statement [in his Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life]:779Once neither entities nor nonentitiesare present for the intellect,there are no other possibilities.This is complete peace, free from referents.The [Prāsaṅgika] philosophical system emphasizes abiding in unborn peace, free from elaborations;this involves no mode of apprehension."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242 C the treasury of knowledgeAll [who follow] the noble father [Nāgārjuna] and his son [Āryadeva] emphasize that the rationally analyzed philosophical system of this tradi-tion teaches that [the actual ultimate] is to abide in peace, which is unborn and free from all elaborations, and that this involves no mode of perceiving reference points.Path Madhyamaka: The Unity of Method and Wisdom [(bb)]The unification of method and wisdom is gradually developed during the ten bhūmis[when] primordial wisdom directly realizes [dharmatā]. [Primordial wisdom] is divided during subsequent attainment in that it is the support.The master Chandrakīrti explains [the path] by bringing together the method (upāya, thabs) taught in the Sūtra on the Ten Bhūmis780 and the wis-dom (prajñā, shes rab) presented in the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way. He describes the way [method and wisdom] are unified through the gradual cultivation of the ten pāramitās during the ten bhūmis.781 The essence of the ultimate is primordial wisdom that directly realizes dharmatā, which is free from all elaborations. As for the way in which dharmatā is realized: the primordial wisdom of noble beings does not see an essence of phenomena in any way. This is referred to with the conven-tional expression “realizing dharmatā.” As [Atīsha] says [in his Entrance to the Two Truths]:782The most profound sūtras sayit is the seeing of the unseen.In the context of the subsequent states of attainment, primordial wisdom is divided slightly in that it is the support for the virtues of generosity and so forth.783 The essence of primordial wisdom itself, however, has no divi-sions, because primordial wisdom and dharmatā are inseparable and the essence of dharmatā has no divisions.Resultant Madhyamaka: The Unity of the Two Kāyas [(cc)][The result] is asserted to be the unity of the two kāyas."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 243I will discuss the dharmakāya and the form kāyas without differentiating them in terms of their actual and nominal types.784 As for the identification of the first, the dharmakāya is the space-like expanse free from the two obscurations and their habitual tendencies. This accords with the state-ment in the Entrance to the Middle Way:785When the dry wood of knowable objects is fully consumed,there is peace: the dharmakāya of the victorious ones.At that point, there is neither arising nor cessation.With the cessation of mind, the [sambhoga]kāya makes this [the dharmakāya] manifest.786Given that, does primordial wisdom, in this system, exist at the bhūmi of a buddha or not? Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen787 commented on this, saying:The assertion that, in the tradition of the master Chandrakīrti, primordial wisdom does not exist on a buddha’s bhūmi deni-grates both the master and the buddhas. The dharma lord Sakya Paṇḍita788 states:If you assert that, ultimately, on the bhūmi of a buddha, primor-dial wisdom is beyond existence and nonexistence and, conven-tionally, it is mind and mental events, then on the bhūmi of a buddha [primordial wisdom] does not exist, because a buddha has exhausted delusion.The exalted Mikyö Dorjé, Silung Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden],789 and others assert that, ultimately, on the bhūmi of a buddha, primordial wisdom is beyond existence or nonexistence, and, conventionally, primordial wisdom exists, because [the Entrance to the Middle Way] says:790with your excellent omniscience, you comprehend all knowable objects in a single moment. In that case, if buddha[hood] is identified as being space-like dharmatā, does it mean that buddhas do not benefit others? [No, it does not, because] the power of the buddhas’ previous aspirations and the merit of the beings"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"244 C the treasury of knowledgeto be trained cause [the buddhas’ activities] to appear uninterruptedly with their two form kāyas, [which manifest] for the sake of others. This is like the way wish-fulfilling gems and wish-granting trees791 can fulfill the needs and desires of those who pray to them even though they do not have the idea of doing so. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:792 The kāya of peace is evident, like wish-granting trees,and, like wish-fulfilling gems, it is nonconceptual.Until all beings are liberated, it remains constant for the sake of enriching the world.It appears to those free from conceptual elaborations.A Synopsis of the Main Points of the [Prāsaṅgika] Philosophical Tenet System [(iv)]What is logically imputed is rejected: entities are simply names.Conditioned phenomena are deceptive; nirvāṇa is not.Taking things to be real and what that produces is the afflictive obscuration, the root of cyclic existence.Because the three yānas’ ways of seeing are similar, their paths of seeing are the same.Since [from the perspective of buddhas] knowable objects have subsided, buddhas are simply appearances for others. These are the main features of this philosophical tenet system.This philosophical tenet system has many distinctive features, but the fol-lowing five are the main ones.First: [Phenomena Exist Only Nominally][Prāsaṅgikas] reject all discussions of valid forms of cognition and invalid forms of cognition, which are the logical imputations (rtog ges btags pa) of [the other philosophical systems] up through the Svātantrika system. [Prāsaṅgikas] reject these for their own Madhyamaka system and as worldly systems, even as mere conventional expressions, without even con-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"pra ̄san.gika c 245sidering that such things [could be established] from a rational perspec-tive. All phenomena (inner and outer, as well as causes and their results) are what is imagined (blos brtags), which [means that], from their own side as objects, they do not exist even as conventions: they are simply names and are [only] imputedly existent (ming rkyang btags yod). [Prāsaṅgikas] state that horses and elephants in dreams and the waking state are equiva-lent in terms of being real or false.793Second: [Conditioned Phenomena Are Deceptive]whatever is conditioned is necessarily a false and deceptive phenomenon, since it does not remain for a second instant beyond its single instant of existence, and no agent and its object exist in that single instant. Not only are [conditioned phenomena] not able to withstand rational analysis, there is not even a trace of something that is established from a rational perspec-tive. [Prāsaṅgikas,] therefore, maintain that there is no common locus (gzhi mthun) between conditioned phenomena and something established through valid forms of cognition. Although it is the case that when prop-erly analyzed, nirvāṇa and any [hypothetically] superior phenomenon do not exist from their own side, [Prāsaṅgikas] assert that, from the perspec-tive of slight analysis, the only thing that is undeceiving is nirvāṇa. This is stated in [the Sixty Verses on Reasoning]:794The victors teach thatnirvāṇa alone is true.Third: [The Afflictive Obscuration Is Taking Things to Be Real]The root of cyclic existence is taking things to be real (satyagrāha, bden ’dzin). That [notion] and what it produces—the mental afflictions (such as attachment) and all their associated factors—are simply the afflictive obscuration (kleṣhāvaraṇa, nyon sgrib). whereas [the cognitive obscuration (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya’i sgrib pa) is as the Highest Continuum says]:795All concepts of the three spheres796are asserted to be the cognitive obscuration."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"246 C the treasury of knowledgeIt is also said:The cognitive obscuration is the one hundred [and eight] con-cepts concerned with percepts and perceivers.797[Prāsaṅgikas] do not assert that there is a common locus between taking things to be real and the cognitive obscuration. Their assertion accords with statements such as [Nāgārjuna’s in his Precious Garland]:798As long as one clings to the aggregates,[one will cling to a self.]And: It is definite that the root of saṃsāra is taking things to be real.Thi s also establishes that it is impossible that shrāvakas and pratyeka-buddhas do not realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena.799Fourth: [The Realization of Dharmata ̄ Is the Same in the Three Ya ̄nas]The three yānas’ paths of seeing do not consist of many moments, such as sixteen, fifteen, twelve, or four. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:800 The intelligence that perceives suchness as its object is also not differentiated. [Prāsaṅgikas] assert that the way dharmatā is seen is the same in all three yānas.Fifth: [Buddhas’ Manifestations Are Simply Appearances for Others]The buddhas’ unfathomable and indescribable form kāyas and activities are nonconceptual, just as are the achievements of wish-fulfilling gems and garuda stūpas.801 Moreover, they are displays of appearances for others (gzhan snang) that do not require even the arousing of bodhichitta. Instead, their [manifestation] is attributable to the power of [the buddhas’] previ-ous aspirations and the positive karma of those to be trained.

[The Eight Uncommon Theses]A later generation of Tibetans explains that this system has eight great, uncommon theses: four theses associated with refutation and four theses associated with affirmation.803 [The four associated with refutation](A1) Th e existence of things by way of their own specific characteristics (svalakṣhaṇasiddha, rang mtshan kyis grub pa) is not accepted even as a convention.(A2) Independently [verifiable] reasons are not accepted even as con-ventions.(A3) Reflexive awareness is not accepted even as a convention.(A4) An ālaya is not accepted even as a convention.[The four associated with affirmation](B1) External objects (bāhyārtha, phyi don) are accepted.(B2) Taking things to be real is necessarily the afflictive obscuration.(B3) Disintegration (zhig pa) is asserted to be a [functioning] thing (dngos po).(B4) No ble shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena.804Regarding these [eight points], Serdok Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden] and his sons say, “[We can agree] only with the words of the statement ‘Noble shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phe-nomena.’ As for the other seven points, they are philosophical tenets that Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamikas would not consider even in their dreams.” The assertions of the eighth lord [Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé] are for the most part similar to that.805"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"11.

In Tibet, this [uncommon explanation] was trans-mitted by the lotsāwas Zu Gawé Dorjé810 and Tsen Kawoché811 and was first established as a system of standard texts (yig cha’i srol) by the mahāsiddha Yumo [Mikyö Dorjé]812 and others. The uncommon key points of this view were elucidated in the teachings of the lord of victors Rangjung Dorjé,813 the omniscient [Longchen] Drimé Özer,814 and others, who also clearly main-tained that this [view] was the final definitive meaning. In particular, the omniscient dharma lord Dolpopa the Great815 proclaimed the lion’s roar of “Shentong-Madhyamaka.” Later, Serdok Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden],816 the exalted Tāranātha,817 and others clarified the uncommon key points of this system of philosophical tenets. [These are the masters who] appeared as the founders and promulgators of this great chariot-system. The exegetical systems associated with those [treatises] differ in such a variety of ways that they could be [categorized] into subtler and broader subschools. Silung Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden]’s explanation is that princi-pally there are two exegetical styles found in [Maitreya’s Treatises]:818 (1) the exegetical style of the first three Dharma Treatises of Maitreya, which may be referred to as that of the Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas, or(2) the exegetical style of the Highest Continuum, which belongs to the Mādhyamikas with Certainty about the Ultimate (don dam rnam par nges pa’i dbu ma pa)."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 251These two systems do not differ greatly in terms of the essence of their views, however, they do differ in the following specific ways: (1) The system of the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya explains that ultimately there are three yānas, and it does not make some points that are part of the presentation819 found in the Highest Continuum. (2) The thought of the Highest Continuum is expressed in the explana-tions that ultimately there is one yāna, that there is a bhūmi on which the habitual tendency of ignorance is present, and that birth can take place through undefiled karma.820We should understand that these [two systems] are exegetical styles that are respectively (1) the means for common disciples to cut through con-ceptual elaborations by means of study and reflection;821 and (2) the way for uncommon disciples to become definitively certain about the ultimate by means of meditation. The majority of Tibetans say that [the first Dharma Treatises of Mai-treya] are not Madhyamaka texts because they teach that ultimately there are three yānas. However, the masters who hold the positions [of the first Dharma Treatises] say that the explanation that shrāvakas and pratyeka-buddhas do not enter the Mahāyāna path after having attained nirvāṇa without remainder is itself not enough justification to say that [these texts] are not to be considered Madhyamaka: being considered Madhyamaka is [determined] on the basis of the view. Their point is that [the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya are Madhyamaka] because [they teach] the following special features of the Madhyamaka, as specified by the lord of scholars Kamalashīla and others:(1) all knowable objects are of one taste, emptiness;(2) all sentient beings are pervaded by the element of sugatagarbha;822 and(3) all beings are capable of the awakening [of a buddha].The great omniscient one of Jonang [Dolpopa] states:823 The five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya do not contain differ-ent views. The Ornament of Clear Realization does not explain the Rangtong view. None of these [texts] explain that ultimately there are three yānas and a cut-off potential."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 C the treasury of knowledgeThus he does not subdivide Shentong-Madhyamaka into higher and lower [schools].There are Tibetans who say that the Madhyamaka system of three of the Treatises of Maitreya is [in fact] the False Image system of the Chittamātra.824 However, in general Tibetans make free use of the conven-tions “Real Images” and “False Images,”825 which [they always consider] to belong to the Chittamātra [system]. [They make their categorization] simply [because] there are two types [of statements] that appear in these treatises: the images appearing as objects for cognition (which is [itself] appearing as referents) are real or they are false; [however, neither state-ment constitutes grounds for these texts to be considered as belonging to either Chittamātra subschool].The following passage from [Serdok] Paṇchen Shākya Chokden is of particular relevance:826 Those who assert that the view of the Highest Continuum is the Chittamātra view have no scriptures or reasonings to prove that, for the following reasons: In [the Highest Continuum’s] own sys-tem there are no scriptural quotations or reasonings that validate [such a categorization]. If they [instead] draw on scriptures and reasonings from other systems to prove [their point] and confute [other positions], they will never find a Mādhyamika who main-tains the flawless Madhyamaka view. If [the fact that] the exalted Maitreya and Asaṅga have explained that [the Highest Continuum] is Madhyamaka is not enough proof [for them], they will never find a valid authority for these teachings. Bhāvaviveka and Kamalashīla prove that Nāgārjuna’s scrip-tural tradition is Madhyamaka by using the argument that he was a noble being and was prophesied by the Sugata. Such [argu-ments] apply in this [case since both Maitreya and Asaṅga were noble beings and were prophesied by the Buddha]. If [the Highest Continuum] is not considered Madhyamaka because it explains that the consummate [nature] is ultimate reality, how could the many earlier and later Tibetans827 who assert that ultimate reality is emptiness in its aspect of a nonim-plicative negation be considered Mādhyamikas?"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 253Thus, Maitreya’s and Asaṅga’s own system does not explain that there are teachings [of the Buddha] or treatises that reveal a Madhyamaka view that is not found in the Madhyamaka taught in the last Dharma Treatise of Maitreya [the Highest Continuum]. This can be understood by reading not only the root texts of Mai-treya but also the four Synopses828 and the two Compendia,829 because this system states:It is explained clearly that sūtras teaching that all phe-nomena have no inherent nature (niḥsvabhāva, ngo bo nyid med pa) are not to be taken literally. Anyone who accepts such [statements] as literal is a propounder of nihilism. A Detailed Explanation of [the Shentong] System [bb''] This discussion has three parts: the way the two truths are ascertained;830 the way [Shentong] is free from the Chittamātras’ defects; and an explana-tion of the ways that Rangtong and Shentong differ and other points.The Way the Two Truths Are Ascertained [(1)]First, imagination of what is unreal exists conventionally.Percept and perceiver are simply imputed by mind and do not exist. Primordial wisdom, free from conceptual elaborations, [exists] in the sense that it is the dharmatā of that [consciousness];and within that [dharmatā], adventitious, removable stains exist.The Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes states:831 Imagination of what is unreal exists;within it, duality does not exist.Emptiness exists within it,and it exists within that [emptiness].Thus all is explainedas not empty and not non-empty."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"254 C the treasury of knowledgeSince [imagination] exists, [duality] does not exist, and [imagination of what is unreal] exists [within emptiness, and emptiness within it],this is the middle path.832First, [the following is presented] from the perspective of cutting through conceptual elaborations concerning conventional [reality].833 The mere imagination of what is unreal—cognition, which manifests as the variety of appearances—exists on a conventional [level]. The percepts and per-ceivers appearing to that [cognition] do not exist even conventionally, because they are simply imputed by the mind. Thus, conventional reality is free from the two extremes:• It is free from the extreme of nonexistence, or nihilism, because the mere existence of imagination is accepted on the conventional level.• It is free from the extreme of permanence, or existence, because it tran-scends superimposed, mutually dependent phenomena, such as percepts and perceivers.834Primordial wisdom, emptiness free from conceptual elaborations, really exists (bden par yod) within that consciousness—i.e., within the imagina-tion of what is unreal—in the sense that it is its dharmatā [its reality]. In the phase with stains, consciousness, “that which bears reality,”835 exists within dharmatā as adventitious, removable stains; it is stains, [or] factors to be abandoned, which are of an unreal nature. Thus, ultimate reality is free from the two extremes: • It transcends the extreme of nonexistence, or nihilism, because empti-ness truly exists (bden grub).• It transcends the extreme of existence, or permanence, because all phe-nomena comprising the duality of percept and perceiver (such as imagi-nation) do not truly exist (bden med).Conventional [phenomena] are simply delusive appearances, empty of any nature.Dharmatā is unchanging, not empty of a nature.That being the case, the conventional [phenomena of] percepts and per-ceivers are simply the manifestations of delusive appearances—they are not things that exist by way of their own natures. Thus, they are empty of"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 255any nature of their own. [Looking at this in the context of] a dichotomy between self and other, it is also not possible that a knowable object exists with a nature that is other [than its own]. Thus, since [conventional phe-nomena] are empty in all regards, they are not non-empty. Primordial wisdom, which is dharmatā, exists originally by way of its own nature and never changes; therefore, it is not empty of a nature of its own, and it always exists. [The Three Characteristics] The imagined is nonexistent; the dependent exists conventionally.The consummate does not exist conventionally but does exist ultimately. You might wonder, did the sūtras not teach that even the dharmadhātu is empty? Generally speaking, it is empty, or emptiness, but that does not necessitate that it is empty of its own nature. Primordial wisdom [the dharmadhātu] is called “emptiness” because it is empty of all characteris-tics that are other than itself, that is, it is empty of all conceptual elabora-tions of percepts and perceivers. Now [I will discuss] the three characteristics (trilakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid gsum): the imagined (parikalpita, kun brtags), dependent (paratantra, gzhan dbang), and consummate (pariniṣhpanna, yongs grub). Imagined [characteristics] are• all non-entities (such as space); • what appears as an object, such as a form manifesting to thought;• the linking of names and their referents, where a name is taken to be its referent or a referent is mistakenly taken to be its name; and• all perceived objects that are superimposed conceptually: outer and inner; end and middle; large and small; good and bad; directions; time; and so forth.The dependent [characteristic] is mere consciousness that manifests as the entities of percept and perceiver, because it is an appearance that is governed by something other than itself, i.e., the habitual tendencies of ignorance."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"256 C the treasury of knowledgeThe consummate [characteristic] is reflexive awareness, self-illuminat-ing and free from conceptual elaborations. Synonyms for it are dharmatā, dharmadhātu, thusness, and the ultimate. The dependent and imagined [characteristics] are equal in that they do not really exist (bden par med); equal in being delusive appearances; and equal in being conventionalities and false. It is necessary, however, to distinguish them in terms of their respective characteristics: imagined [characteristics] do not exist even on a conventional [level], whereas the dependent do exist conventionally. The consummate [characteristic] does not exist conventionally and does exist ultimately (don dam du yod pa), thus it really exists.These three [characteristics] are imputedly existent, substan-tially existent, and existent without conceptual elaborations.They are the emptiness of the nonexistent, the emptiness of the existent, and the ultimate emptiness.They are the inherent absence of characteristics, the inherent absence of arising, and the ultimate inherent absence.The three characteristics [are discussed in the following three ways]. [Three Modes of Existence]Imagined [characteristics] are imputedly existent (btags pas yod pa). Depen-dent [characteristics] are substantially existent (rdzas su yod pa). The con-summate [characteristic] does not exist in [either of] those two [ways]—it exists without conceptual elaborations (spros med du yod pa). [Three Modes of Emptiness]Imagined [characteristics] are “the emptiness of the nonexistent” (med pa’i stong nyid). Dependent [characteristics] are “the emptiness of the existent” (yod pa’i stong nyid). The consummate [characteristic] is “ultimate empti-ness” (don dam stong nyid).836 The exalted [Maitreya in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:837 Those who know the emptiness of the nonexistent,the emptiness of the existent,and natural emptinessare said to “know emptiness.”"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 257[Three Modes of Inherent Absence]Imagined [characteristics] are the inherent absence of characteristics (mtshan nyid ngo bo nyid med pa).838 Dependent [characteristics] are the inherent absence of arising (skye ba ngo bo nyid med pa).839 The consum-mate [nature] is the ultimate inherent absence (don dam ngo bo nyid med pa).840 [Vasubandhu’s Thirty Verses] says:841Thinking of the three types of inherent absenceof the three kinds of natures, it is taught that all phenomena have no nature.[The Consummate Nature]Consequently, [Shentong Proponents] assert that all knowable objects are pervaded by emptiness.They state that the consummate, in terms of its own nature, is not connected to conventional phenomena;it precludes the triad of definition, definiendum, and illustration;it is free from conceptual elaborations, permanent, partless, and omnipresent.Their presentations of all other [topics] accord with the Chittamātra. Consequently, this system asserts that all knowable objects are pervaded by emptiness and inherent absence. You may ask, “If the consummate [nature] is truly existent, does it exist as something that arises, abides, and ceases? Does it come or go? Change or disappear? Does it have spatial or temporal dimensions? Is it singular or is it a plurality?” It is none of those. If something were to have those [characteristics], it would follow that it does not really exist. This [consummate nature] has no connection to any such conventional phenomena: it is not something that arises, abides, and ceases, comes or goes. It is not singular nor is it a plurality; it is neither a cause nor a result. In terms of its own nature, it precludes the triad of defi-nition, definiendum, and illustration. Since it is free from all conceptual elaborations, such as being something with spatial or temporal dimensions, [the consummate nature] is inherently permanent. Because it cannot be divided into discrete pieces, it is partless. Since it is the dharmatā of all phenomena, it is said to be omnipresent and all-pervading.842"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"25\u0018 C the treasury of knowledge[Shentong Proponents’] presentations of other [topics related to] ground, path, and result843 are said for the most part to be in accord with the Chittamātra [system].The Way [Shentong] Is Free from the Chittamātras’ Defects [(2)]The Proponents of False Images state that the entity of consciousness truly exists andthat it is an object of mind. This [Shentong system] asserts that primordial wisdom truly exists; and yet, because it is not a conditioned phenomenon,[their assertions about] the ultimate are free from the mistakes of the Realists.The system known in Tibet as False Image Chittamātra states that the entity of the ālaya consciousness is truly existent; and consciousness, there-fore, is an object of the intellect. Thus, they are [considered by others to be] Realists.

However, because this primordial wisdom beyond conceptual elaborations is not a conditioned phenomenon, they say that [their assertions about] ultimate reality are free from all the mis-takes of the Realists.An Explanation of the Ways that Rangtong and Shentong Differ and Other Points [(3)]The Rangtong and Shentong [systems] do not differ overthe way that conventional [phenomena] are empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaborations cease during meditative equipoise.They differ over whether, as a convention, dharmatā exists during subsequent attainment or not,and over whether primordial wisdom is truly established at the end of analysis or not."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 259[The Shentong system] asserts that [if] ultimate realitywere simply a nonimplicative negation, whereby its nature is not established, it would be an inanimate emptiness.[Shentong Proponents] present [ultimate reality] as being primordial wisdom empty of dualism, as being reflexive awareness.This is asserted to be the profound view linking the Sūtra and Mantra [systems].The two Madhyamaka [systems] renowned as Shentong and Rangtong do not differ in the way they determine all conventional phenomena to be empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaborations cease during meditative equipoise. Nevertheless, they do differ in terms of the way they use conventional cognitive and verbal expressions during the subsequent state of attainment,844 which is when philosophical tenet systems are distinguished. Simply as a conventional position, [Shentong Proponents] say that dharmatā or thusness exists, and [Rangtong Propo-nents] say that it does not exist. They also differ in their views of whether nondual primordial wisdom is truly established or not at the time of final analysis by means of reasonings that analyze for ultimacy. Shentong Proponents, therefore, assert that imagined and dependent [characteristics] are conventionalities, and the consummate [characteris-tic] is ultimate reality. They also maintain that to view [ultimate reality] as being simply a nonimplicative negation, whereby its reality is not estab-lished, is [to regard ultimate reality as] an inanimate emptiness.845 That is the way conventionalities are empty, but it is not the abiding nature of ulti-mate emptiness. Concisely put, that [ultimate] is primordial wisdom empty of the duality of percept and perceiver; it is intuitive reflexive awareness (so so rang rig pa). They state that since this way of presenting [the ulti-mate] is in complete harmony with the thought of the great tantras, it is the profound view linking the Sūtra and Mantra [systems], the pinnacle of Madhyamaka systems. Now [we will look at] the summary of the essential points in the elimina-tion of the extremes imputed by others [to the Shentong system] as pre-sented by the exalted Tāranātha [in his Essence of Shentong]:846"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260 C the treasury of knowledgeThere are those who quote the following passage from the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra:847[Mahāmati] asked, “If sugatagarbha were to exist with its major and minor marks, would it not be similar to the self of [non-Buddhist] tīrthikas?”848 [The Buddha] replied, “It is not similar because it is emptiness.”They say, “Sugatagarbha, therefore, does not really exist. If it had the major and minor marks and the like, this would be a tīrthika’s system. The space-like complete absence of any exis-tence is called sugatagarbha.”Such claims [limit] emptiness to mean the absence of reality and identify it as just the complete and utter absence of any exis-tence. [Such ideas] belong to a flawed intellect that is attached to its inferior philosophical tenets. The sūtra states, as the reason why [sugatagarbha] is not similar to the tīrthikas’ [self], that [sugatagarbha] is emptiness, but it does not say that [the reason it is not similar to the tīrthikas’ self] is that it lacks the major and minor marks. Those who claim that sugatagarbha with its clearly evident and perfect major and minor marks is explained to be the provisional meaning are simply deceiving the world with their lies.The statement that the assertion of [sugata]garbha as perma-nent belongs to the tīrthikas’ systems again amounts to noth-ing more than a refutation of the sūtras on [sugata]garbha. It is not feasible to assert that the meaning of permanence [here] is the permanence of being continuous, because saṃsāra and all percepts and perceivers are the mere permanence of being continuous. Also, if the mere permanence of being continuous were sufficient [to qualify as] permanence, all conditioned phe-nomena would be permanent. Some think, “[Sugatagarbha] is impermanent since first it has stains and later it becomes stainless.” From the perspective of the dharmadhātu, it does not have stains at first, nor does it later become stainless. Nevertheless, the mode of having stains and becoming stainless is [simply something that appears] in"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 261relationship to the mindstreams of individuals. Thus, it is not the case that changes in the state of a sentient being result in changes to the state of dharmatā.Others think, “It is not logical that the primordial wisdom of buddha[hood] exists within the mindstreams of sentient beings.” This, however, contradicts the explicit statement [in the Highest Continuum]:849Because the primordial wisdom of buddha[hood] is present in all sentient beings . . .Some say, “It is not feasible that the excellent qualities of buddha[hood] exist within the mindstreams of sentient beings. For example, if the strength of knowing what is the case and what is not the case850 were to exist within the mindstreams of sentient beings, it would follow [absurdly] that sentient beings know what is the case and what is not the case.” This state-men t is incorrect, because we do not say “whatever is part of the mindstreams of sentient beings is buddha[hood].” If that were the consequence of saying that buddha[hood] and its excellent qualities reside in the mindstreams of sentient beings, would it also follow that when a buddha resides on a throne, the throne cognizes all knowable objects? Therefore, how could the mind-streams of sentient beings—that is, the eight modes of conscious-ness—be buddha[hood]? The buddha[hood] that resides [in the mindstreams of sentient beings] does not do so in the manner of a conventional support and something supported, [where bud-dhahood would be what is supported by a sentient being’s mind-stream]. It abides in the manner of being ultimate dharmatā.Additional Topics: Recommendations [cc\"]Most Tibetan teachers say, “This system is Chittamātra,”and regard Maitreya’s texts and Asaṅga and his brother as inferior.

Many of them go further by conceitedly claiming to have fathomed the thought of the scholars [of this system], when [in fact] all they are doing is [simply] repeating [their own] exegetical system. By stating, “The exalted Maitreya’s scriptural tradition and the noble Asaṅga and his brother are Chittamātra,” they take them to be greatly inferior and the noble Nāgārjuna and others to be greatly superior. On the basis of that, they amass an infinite amount of the [bad] karma of rejecting the dharma. what equal the sun and moon—which alone ornament the sky of the Sage’s teachings—are none other than the scriptural traditions of the two great chariot[-systems].851 Therefore, if we align ourselves with those, we will avoid repeatedly echoing the constellation-like minor texts of ordinary paṇḍitas, which involves devoting ourselves to the elaborations of refuta-tions and proofs that rely on many spurious scriptures and reasonings. we will also avoid fixating on biased positions and providing limited explana-tions, the results of which will only bring ourselves and others into a pit of numerous faults.

The sources for this are [Maitreya’s five Trea-tises:] the two Ornaments, two Differentiations, and Highest Con-tinuum Shāstra. The Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes Shāstra establishes this view as the Madhyamaka path, and the Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature Shāstra presents the stages by which the mind engages that [view and path]. (2) [The ultimate definitive meaning in Nāgārjuna’s teachings] is a mere nonimplicative negation, which refutes all conceptu-ally elaborated extremes. The sources for this are [Nāgārjuna’s] Collection of Reasonings.855 what is found in his Collection of Praises856 is in keeping with Maitreya’s Dharma Treatises.Who were the establishing founders of these [systems]? The two: the venerable Nāgārjuna and the venerable Asaṅga. In what way were these established? As twofold: as the Rangtong system, which determines that both [conventional and ultimate] real-ity are empty of an essence; and as the Shentong system, which determines that only the nature of conventional [phenomena] is intrinsically empty (rang stong), and thereby eliminates conceptual elaborations concerning the ultimate. Further, there are two [other systems]:(1) the system of Āryavimuktisena857 and Haribhadra,858 which explains the thought of the Ornament of Clear Realization according to the Rangtong [perspective]; and"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"264 C the treasury of knowledge(2) the system of Abhayākaragupta859 and Dharmapāla,860 which explains the thought of [Nāgārjuna’s] Collection of Rea-sonings according to the Shentong.In sum, all four of these pioneering systems are equal in being Madhyamaka paths, because they are clearly stated to be Madhya-maka systems in the authentic scriptural traditions. The Rangtong mode is explained to be the Madhyamaka path by masters who are Prāsaṅgika or Svātantrika proponents, because they explain emptiness in terms of the Rangtong-Madhya-maka, [following Nāgārjuna’s] statement:861whatever is dependently arisenis explained to be empty.It is a dependent designationand is itself the middle way.The Shentong mode is asserted to be the Madhyamaka path by Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu], because they assert emp-tiness in the Shentong style, [following the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes]:862 Since [imagination] exists, [duality] does not exist, and [imagination of what is unreal] exists [within emptiness, and emptiness within it],this is the middle path.In this regard, some in the Land of Snows [i.e., Tibet] think, “Madhyamaka, which is one of the four philosophical tenet systems, generally [consists of] the Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika systems. [A system] superior to those could only be a path that is classified as Prāsaṅgika, since [the Entrance to the Middle Way] says:863 This profound and frightening suchness will definitely be realized by those who have previously familiarized them-selves with it;"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 265but others, even with their vast learning, will not be able to comprehend it.[I will answer] that [by showing] the comparable application of [the opponent’s reason] (mgo mtshungs) and the actual state of things (rnal ma). First, [the comparable application of the opponent’s reason]:In that case, it would be [equally] reasonable to explain that the supreme type of Madhyamaka is only found in the Shentong mode, because the venerable Asaṅga explained it in that [way], and because he explained that the view of the Rangtong mode is a view of denial (skur ba ’debs pa) and a view for those of lesser acu-men.864 In this context of identifying the definitive meaning,865 the venerable Asaṅga’s scriptures are equally capable of negating or proving the same points that Chandrakīrti’s scriptures are capable of negating or proving, because [the Buddha] prophesied that [Asaṅga] would be the master who would distinguish the provi-sional and definitive meanings in the sūtras. In brief, it is a matter of dispute who represents the Madhyamaka that is the pinnacle of the four systems of philosophical tenets propounded in the noble land [of India], because the Mahāyāna master Chandrakīrti did not explain the Shentong mode as Madhyamaka, and the noble Asaṅga—whose [stature] as a Mahāyāna master of the [Buddhist] doctrine is undisputed and unrivaled—explained that the Rang-tong mode is not the scriptural tradition of the Madhyamaka. Second, [the actual state of things]:For explaining the thought of Nāgārjuna, the Rangtong exegetical system is superior; and for elucidating the thought of the exalted Maitreya, the Shentong mode is most profound. The scriptures and reasonings of one, therefore, are not able to negate the other. If we do not look at it that way, we have [to regard] the vener-able Asaṅga’s scriptures and reasonings as predominant (dbang btsan pa), because he was prophesied as one who would attain the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266 C the treasury of knowledgelevel of a noble being and delineate the definitive meaning, and he was [one of] the first founders of a system of the Mahāyāna. Chandrakīrti did explain that the venerable Asaṅga’s exegetical style was not [in keeping with] the thought of Nāgārjuna, but he did not explain that the venerable Asaṅga had not internalized the meaning of Madhyamaka. These masters [that is, Tāranātha and Shākya Chokden] make a distinction between Chittamātras and Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins), as is discussed in [Distinguishing the] Two Modes [and] Establishing the Unity [of the Definitive Meaning].866 [The latter] states this in detail: The explanation that Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) and Chittamātras are the same is derived from: (1) the confusion of the many Tibetans who accept that all [forms of] awareness and primordial wisdom are necessarily mind and mental events; (2) their mistake of not distinguishing primordial wisdom from consciousness; and (3) their failure to train properly in dharma terminology of the final teachings [of the Buddha, that is, the teachings of the third dharma wheel]. You who assert that Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) and Chittamātras are the same can understand that your position is not logical by simply reflecting on the meaning of passages that you chant, such as the following: From scriptures, [such as the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes]:867No phenomenon existsapart from the dharmadhātu.From sūtras, [such as the Abhidharma Sūtra]:868The expanse of beginningless timeis the source of all phenomena."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"shentong-madhyamaka c 267From tantras, [the Hevajra Tantra]:869I pervade all these.[I] do not see another nature in beings.Also from tantras:870Outside of the precious mind there are no buddhas or sentient beings.[When you reflect on] these sources, the expressions “dharma-dhātu” and so on found in such scriptures must be explained as nondual primordial wisdom and the natural dharmakāya, because the scriptural traditions [of those texts] clearly state that. This system of philosophical tenets is also called by the name “Madhya-maka” in the sūtras. The Sūtra on Ultimate Emptiness says:871 The absence of one thing in something else is [that latter thing’s] emptiness of that [first thing]. What remains there [i.e., empti-ness] exists there. This is the middle path, the correct, unerring view about emptiness. There are many such statements [in the sūtras].

This is because [Secret"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270 C the treasury of knowledgeMantra] primarily ascertains and takes as its practice the nature of mind as it is taught extensively in the final wheel [of dharma], which is as follows: The nature of mind is natural luminosity, empty of all conceptual elabora-tions and characteristics. Its essence is that it is dharmatā-awareness, with the quality of being reflexive awareness. From the start, it is spontaneously present as the basic state of all phenomena.This natural luminosity is distinguished by great bliss. It is emptiness (the letter e) and great compassion (the letter vam.).875 It is primordial wis-dom, which is the unification of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and so forth. Since this subject is explained clearly and extensively in the Five Stages,876 the Three Commentaries by Bodhisattvas,877 and other texts, those texts should be consulted.Here I will summarize [the key points of] a shared style of explanation. There are two points: Madhyamaka as it relates to the generation stage and Madhyamaka as it relates to the completion stage.878 Madhyamaka as It Relates to the Generation StageThis has two modes: (1) the mode [relating to] the ground for the creation of the deities; and (2) the mode for the created deity to arise without conceptual elabora-tions.(1) The Shentong mode of explanation [applies to how the deities] are created within nondual primordial wisdom, because [it clarifies how] the seed syllables and emblems that arise within emptiness are not beyond the primordial wisdom of the dharmadhātu.(2) The way those created deities arise without conceptual elaborations is first ascertained by [being aware of the deities’] clarity and emptiness. Their clarity is the vivid appearance of the characteristics and attributes of the maṇḍalas of deities (the support and supported).879 Their emptiness is that we do not cling to them in any way nor do we conceptualize them as anything, because if we fixate on the characteristics of those vivid appear-ances we will not transcend saṃsāra. The mere cessation of concepts may be considered nirvāṇa, but it is not the transcendence of all flaws, because one has not reached the state of unification.880 Therefore, we practice by unifying [clarity and emptiness]:"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"secret mantra-madhyamaka c 271while the appearances of the deities are vivid, they are empty; while they are empty, they appear clearly. This is the unification of clarity and empti-ness. In the key instructions, it is called “the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.” In this context, objects manifest as the unification of appearances and emptiness, and cognition as the unification of clarity and emptiness. During the subsequent state of attainment,881 which occurs when we arise from that [samādhi], we maintain the pride of being the deity and, there-fore, we are engaged in a yoga with characteristics. Madhyamaka as It Relates to the Completion StageThis has two aspects: (1) abandoning all fixations to the generation stage; and(2) the actual completion-stage primordial wisdom.(1) [The first aspect of the completion stage is] to gather [i.e., dissolve] the entire maṇḍala, both support and supported, using either a process of “grasping the whole” or “successive destruction,”882 and then rest in a state without any reference points. [During] this [phase], the Rangtong mode883 is the best for stopping the elaborations of thoughts. However, because it is not taught that [resting without reference points] is what is experienced by reflexively aware primordial wisdom, [simply resting without refer-ence points] is not [the practice of] the actual completion-stage primordial wisdom. (2) The actual primordial wisdom of the completion stage [is discussed] in terms of what is to be experienced in practice, the methods that bring about that experience, and the process by which [primordial wisdom] becomes fully manifest. • what is to be experienced is the primordial wisdom of connate great bliss, which is reflexive awareness.884• The means of experience are the stages of self-blessing885 and reflexively aware primordial wisdom.• [The actual completion-stage primordial wisdom] is nonconceptual, unmistaken primordial wisdom, and thus it is the view free from flaws. Nevertheless, at first when [primordial wisdom] simply manifests, one has not arrived at the bhūmis of noble beings, because [wisdom at this point] is simply illustrative primordial wisdom, which points [to the actual wisdom]. This is also called the “primordial wisdom of unified"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272 C the treasury of knowledgebliss and emptiness” and the “connate primordial wisdom of melting bliss.”886I have presented this topic from the perspective of the shared abridged tantras (laghu-tantra, bsdus rgyud). For the distinctive and profound key points that correlate to the unique view of the Kālachakra Tantra, one must look elsewhere. It is taught that the distinction between Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Mantra-Madhyamaka is based on their differences with regard to the subjective agent, that is, the qualities of their realizations; they do not differ in terms of the object [of their realization]: freedom from conceptual elabora-tions.887A Synopsis of What Is Taught in All Madhyamaka [Systems]: Its Ground, Path, and Fruition888 [vii']As its ground, [Madhyamaka] does not denigrate conventionalities just as they appear,and it is free from conceptually elaborated extremes regarding the abiding nature. Its path is to relinquish the apprehension of characteristics through profound wisdom,and to amass merit for the sake of others out of compassion.Its result is the perfection of the dharmakāya, a state of peace, and that the form kāyas nonconceptually benefit others.These [three points] contain all that is taught in Madhyamaka.Everything that is taught in all the Madhyamaka systems is summarized by the following: Since [all Madhyamaka systems] do not denigrate con-ventionalities (saṃvṛiti, kun rdzob) just as they appear, they are free from the extreme of nihilism. Since they are free from any conceptually elabo-rated extremes regarding the ultimate abiding nature (don dam pa’i gnas lugs), they are liberated from the extreme of permanence.

The threefold enumeration of utter purity links the three primary mental afflictions (desire, aggression, and bewilderment) to 108 phenomena, which encompass all phenomena in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. The twelvefold enumeration of complete purity links the complete purity of the twelve synonyms for the self to a similar list of 108 phenomena. In recent years Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche has presented these topics as a succinct means to gain understanding of the profound view of both the Sūtrayāna and the Vajrayāna. He explains that the terms “utter purity” and “complete purity” are syn-onyms, but if one wants to differentiate them, utter purity indicates that the essence of a phenomenon is pure, and complete purity conveys that the phenomenon, as well as everything connected to it, is pure."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"endnotes c 303 2 The four common preliminaries (thun mong sngon ’gro) are the contemplations on the precious human existence, death and impermanence, karmic causes and results, and the faults of saṃsāra. The four uncommon preliminaries (thun mong ma yin pa’i sngon ’gro) are refuge and bodhichitta, Vajrasattva meditation, maṇḍala offering, and guru yoga. See Mahāmudrā: The Ocean of the Definitive Meaning (Phyag chen nges don rgya mtsho) by the ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorjé (Callahan 2001, 9–82). 3 Mahāmudrā: The Ocean of the Definitive Meaning lists five types of conduct: always-excellent conduct (kun bzang gi spyod pa); secret conduct (gsang spyod); the [yogic] discipline of awareness (rig pa brtul zhugs kyi spyod pa); conduct in a crowd (tshogs spyod); and conduct that is victorious-in-all-directions (phyogs las rnam rgyal gyi spyod pa). (See Callahan 2001, 267–8.) These types of conduct are discussed in Book Nine, Part Three, in the section on the conduct taught in the anuttara tantras (The Treasury of Knowledge, hereafter cited as TOK, III:533–66). 4 Many teachers combine these four approaches in various ways; they need not be practiced in isolation from each other. 5 Jamgön (The Protector Mañjushrī) (’Jam mgon) is a title indicating great learning and wisdom. Kongtrul (Kong sprul) is an abbreviation of his tulku name, “KONGpo Bamteng TRULku, the ‘incarnation from Bamteng in Kongpo province’ (in the south of Tibet).” (See Barron 2003, 306n184 and 23–4.)

The doctrine of Asaṅga is not indicative of the path of the Mādhyamika.

He follows this by saying that the four philosophical tenet systems were set out by those who appeared after the Buddha. See Chapter 1, p. 84. 131 It is well accepted that Vasubandhu wrote his Treasury of Abhidharma as an exposi-tion of the Vaibhāṣhika abhidharma system, which he did not agree with as is clear from his criticism of some of their tenets in his Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhi-dharma.” 132 Although there were several people called Vasumitra, Ghoṣhaka, and Dharmatrāta, the ones Jamgön Kongtrul refers to are presumably those cited in Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma and listed by Tāranātha (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970, 103) as Vaibhāṣhika teachers. The dating of them as ca. first century ce is based on Tāranātha’s work, but it is conjectural. More accurately, it is probably best said that they lived some time between the second and fourth centuries. 133 All chapters are divisions introduced by the translator and are not part of Jamgön Kongtrul’s outline (sa bcad). 134 Hirakawa observes (1990, 256): “The original meaning of the element hīna in the term ‘Hīnayāna’ is ‘discarded’; it also denotes ‘inferior’ or ‘base.’ The appellation ‘Hīnayāna’ thus was a deprecatory term used by Mahāyāna practitioners to refer to Nikāya (Sectarian) Buddhism . . . It is unclear whether Mahāyānists referred to the whole of Nikāya Buddhism as Hīnayāna or only to a specific group.” 135 Dzogchen Ponlop 2003, 11–13. 136 In this presentation, the second and third yānas are the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna. 137 Philosophical tenet or tenet system (siddhānta, grub mtha’): literally, “established conclusion” or “limit of the established.” 138 Mahāyāna-saṃgraha, Theg pa chen po bsdus pa. 139 It seems that, in fact, both Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas were branches or factions within the followers of Sarvāstivāda abhidharma.

He also says that Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka is Shentong-Madhyamaka. 151 Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche often uses the example of a dream to illustrate the three characteristics. Our dreaming mind—which is mere cognition that is sim-ply clear and aware—and the mere images in the dream are dependent characteris-tics (paratantra, gzhan dbang). Our ideas about what we experience in our dreams, such as thinking that those “lions and tigers and bears” are enjoyable, or that they are frightening, or that they are real external objects, are the imagined character-istics (parikalpita, kun brtags). The actual nature of our dreaming mind—cognition empty of the duality of perceived object and perceiving mind—is the consummate characteristic (pariniṣhpanna, yongs grub). 152 Proponents of Real Images (or True Aspectarians) (Satyākāravādin, rNam bden pa), and Proponents of False Images (or False Aspectarians) (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa). 153 Sugatamatavibhaṅgabhāṣhya, bDe bar gshegs pa’i gzhung rnam par ’byed pa’i bshad pa. 154 Tāranātha’s Presentation of the Scriptures for the “Ornament of the Shentong-Madhya-maka” (gZhan stong dbu ma’i rgyan gyi lung sbyor ba) and History of Buddhism in India (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970).

This can be under-stood as meaning (1) those who are part of, or inside, the Buddhist teachings, i.e., anyone who has taken refuge in the Buddha, dharma (his teachings), and saṅgha (the community of practitioners); and (2) that followers of the Buddha are primarily concerned with what is inner, that is, the mind. 171 The three yānas (vehicles or approaches) (th eg pa) are Shrāvakayāna, Pratyeka-buddhayāna, and Mahāyāna. The first two are included in the Hīnayāna. Readers should note that although Vajrayāna is sometimes listed as the third yāna (the first two being the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna), Jamgön Kongtrul is following the presenta-tion in which Vajrayāna is one of two divisions of the Mahāyāna, the other being the Pāramitāyāna (see p. 165). See p. 158 for Jamgön Kongtrul’s remarks on his reasons for presenting the Pratyekabuddhayāna as the second of three yānas. 172 Katz remarks (1983, 111–2), “Etymologically, the term [yāna] derives from the Sanskrit root yā-, ‘to go,’ and gives the sense of going or proceeding, as well as the means of carriage or vehicle, and is very close in many connotations to mārga, the pat h . . . Thus the term, derived from ‘to go,’ carries a range of meanings from a spiritual career, to a path or way, to a conveyance or vehicle.” 173 This is a distinction that is applied, for example, to the two forms of Mahāyāna: Pāramitāyāna and Vajrayāna. In the cause-based yāna, we practice what takes us to the result, whereas in the result-based yāna, the result is practiced as the path. See also n. 487. The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche explains (2003, 9–10) these two as follows: Yāna . . . means “the vehicle that brings us to our destination.” Our destination here is enlightenment, liberation from saṃsāra . . . According to Shākyamuni Buddha, we can understand yāna in two different ways. We can understand the term to mean “the yāna that brings us to our destination” or “the yāna that brought us here”—in other words, to where we are right now. The first meaning of yāna, “the yāna that brings us to our destination,” orients us to the future. The yāna, or vehicle, is the cause that brings us to our result: we are brought to the fruition stage, which is our destination. when we define yāna in this way, it is known as the causal yāna. The second meaning of yāna, “the yāna that brought us here,” refers to the result or fruition. It is called the resultant yāna, or fruition yāna, because we have already been conveyed to our destination. we are already there. 174 As Jamgön Kongtrul states clearly, the distinction between the Hīnayāna, “Lesser Vehicle,” and the Mahāyāna, “Greater Vehicle,” is based on the scope of the inten-tion of the individual practitioners. For more discussion of three yānas and the terms Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna, see the Introduction, p. 30. 175 Secret Mantra (gS ang sngags) is another name for the Vajrayāna (rDo rje theg pa).

It means that the word in question is analyzed in terms of its component parts in order to come to a precise understanding of the term. Such etymologies are not what is gen-erally understood by this word in the west, i.e., the tracing of the phonetic, graphic, and semantic development of a word, identifying its cognates in other languages, and the like. 183 TOK, II:444.7: shra ba ka should be shra’ ba ka."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"314 C the treasury of knowledge 184 This is generally glossed as “to cause [others] to hear” (thos par byed pa).

Beijing 80:6): As for [the meaning of the word] “buddha”: Because his intelligence has blos-somed, buddha means “to blossom” (vi-buddha, rgyas pa), as with a lotus flower that has blossomed. Another sense is that because he is free from the duality that is the sleep of ignorance, buddha means “to awaken” (pra-buddha, sad pa), as with a person who has awakened from sleep. sang rgyas zhes bya ba ni blo rgyas pa’i phyir sangs rgyas te dper na padma kha bye ba zhes bya ltar rnam par rgyas zhes bya ba’i tha tshig go/ rnam pa gcig tu na ma rig pa’i gnyid gnyis dang bral ba’i phyir sangs rgyas te/ dper na skyes bu gnyis sad pa zhes bya ba ltar rab tu sad pa zhes bya ba’i tha tshig go. Su bsequently, the Tibetan sangs rgyas (pronounced sang-jay) is explained as meaning “one who has awakened from the darkness of the two obscurations and who has fully developed (or ‘blossomed’ with) the brilliance of twofold knowledge” (sgrib gnyis kyi mun pa sangs shing/ mkhyen gnyis kyi snang ba rgyas pa) (Great Tibetan-Chi-nese Dictionary, hereafter cited as GTCD). See also the Nighaṇṭu (sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa) (Toh. 4347; Dg.T. Beijing 115:316). 187 Hopkins discusses (1983, 840n495) the topic of two etymologies for shrāvaka: Shrāvaka (Nyan thos) is translated as ‘Hearers’ because they hear (nyan) the doctrine, practice it, and then cause others to hear (thos par byed pa) that they have actualized their goal (see Hopkins’ Compassion in Tibetan Buddhism [Lon-don: Hutchinson, 1980], pp. 102–3). This etymology is built around active and causative uses of the verbal root for hearing, shru; one hears and then causes others to hear, in this case not what one has heard but what one has achieved aft er putting into practice the doctrines one has heard . . . [840] However, though there are two etymologies of shrāvaka, they are built not around differ-ent verbal roots but around the single root shru treated in active and passive mod es with different interpretations of both what is heard . . . and what is proclaimed . . . [844] 188 These are discussed in the section Approachers to the Result of a Stream Enterer, p. 142. 189 Fo ur truths of noble beings (ch aturāryasatya, ’phags pa’i bden pa bzhi): Since the Sanskrit term satya (Tib. bden pa) means what is experienced as true or real, here “truth” (satya, bden pa) is used in the sense of an empirical truth or actual truth, not in the sense of a formal truth or logical truth. “Truth” is used throughout this translation for the familiar categories of “the four truths” or “two truths,” and “real-ity” in most other cases. For more on the expression “four truths of noble beings,” see n. 195. 190 According to the GTCD, the term “appropriated aggregates” (upādāna-skandha, nyer len gyi phung po) means that the defiled aggregates arose because of the appropriat-ing action [or substantial cause] of previous karma and mental afflictions, and that"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"endnotes c 315[these aggregates] create the appropriating action [or are the substantial cause] for future karma and mental afflictions (nyer len gyi phung po/ las nyon snga ma’i nyer len las skyes pa dang/ las nyon phyi ma’i nyer len du ’gro ba’i zag bcas kyi phung po).

As even this brief explanation reveals, the term means “truths (or realities) for noble beings.” Readers should be aware that these “truths” themselves are not noble as is evident from the following citations. Vasubandhu discusses the term in his Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 6, commentary for verse 2cd (Dg. T. Beijing 79:683–4): The [phrase] “truths for noble ones” occurs in the sūtras. What does it mean? Because they are what is true for noble ones, the sūtras refer to them only as “truths for noble ones.” Does that mean that they are false for those who are not noble ones? [No.] Because they [i.e., the truths] are not incorrect, they are true for everyone. However, noble ones see them just as they are, whereas others do not. Therefore, they are called “the truths of noble ones,” and they are not [truths] for those who are not noble ones, because [such beings] see incorrectly . . . There are others who say that two are truths [only] for noble ones and two are truths for [both] those who are not noble ones and for noble ones.mdo las ’phags pa’i bden pa rnams zhes ’byung ba de’i don ci zhe na/ ’di dag ni ’phags pa rnams la bden pas/ de lta bas na mdo kho na las/ ’phags pa’i bden pa rnams zhes bshad do/ ci ’di dag gzhan rnams la brdzun nam zhe na/ ’di dag ni phyin ci ma log pa’i phyir thams cad la bden na ’phags pa rnams kyis ni ’di dag ji lta ba de kho na bzhin du gzigs kyi gzhan dag gis ni ma yin pas de’i phyir ’di dag ni ’phags pa rnams kyi bden pa zhes bya ba’i phyin ci log tu mthong ba’i phyir ’phags pa ma yin pa rnams kyi ni ma yin te/ . . . gzhan dag na re gnyis ni ’phags pa rnams kyi bden pa yin la/ gnyis ni ’phags pa yang [reading ma instead of yang] yin ’phags pa rnams kyi bden pa yang yin no zhes zer ro."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"316 C the treasury of knowledge As indicated in the Tibetan, I am reading ’phags pa yang yin in the last sentence as ’phags pa ma yin, following Pruden’s translation of La Vallée Poussin, who notes that “others” are “according to P’u-kuang (TD 41, p. 333c2), the Sautrāntikas and the Sthaviras.” See also Pruden 1989, 898.

Vasubandhu explains in his Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhi-dharma” that latent mental afflictions are called “subtle proliferators” (nyon mongs pa nyal ba la ni phra rgyas zhes bya) (Dg.T. Beijing 79:558). See Pruden 1989, where the term is translated as “latent defilements,” particularly 767, 770, 828–35, and 884n140. 209 The six root mental afflictions (klesha, nyon mongs) are (1) desire (rāga, ’dod chags); (2) anger (pratigha, khong khro); (3) pride (māna, nga rgyal); (4) ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa); (5) doubt (vichikitsā, the tshom); and (6) views (dṛiṣhṭi, lta ba). See TOK, II:378–9; and Hopkins 1983, 255–8. 210 The five views (dṛiṣhṭi, lta ba) are (1) the view, or belief, in the perishing collection [i.e., the aggregates, as being a self] (satkāyadṛiṣhṭi, ’jig tshogs la lta ba); (2) wrong views (mithyādṛiṣhṭi, log lta); (3) a view holding to an extreme (antagrahādṛiṣhṭi, mthar ’dzin gyi lta ba); (4) holding a view to be supreme (dṛiṣhṭiparāmarsha, lta ba mchog ’dzin); and (5) holding an ethical conduct or a discipline to be supreme (shīlavrataparāmarsha, tshul khrims brtul zhugs mchog ’dzin bcas). See TOK, II:379; and Hopkins 1983, 258–61. 211 The twenty secondary mental afflictions (nyer ba nyon mongs pa) are wrath (krodha, khro ba); resentment (upanāha, ’khon ’dzin); concealment (mrakṣha, ’chab pa); spite (pradāsha, ’tshig pa); envy (irṣhyā, phrag dog); avarice (mātsarya, ser sna); hypoc-risy (māyā, sgyu); deceit (shāṭhya, g.yo); self-satisfaction (mada, rgyags pa); violence (vihiṃsā, rnam pa ’tshe ba); non-shame (āhrīkya, ngo tsha med pa); non-embarrass-ment (anapatrāpya, khrel med pa); lethargy (styāna, rmugs pa); agitation (auddhatya, rgod pa); non-faith (āshraddhya, ma dad pa); laziness (kausīdya, le lo); non-conscien-tiousness (pramāda, bag med pa); forgetfulness (mushitasmṛtitā, brjed nges pa); distrac-tion (vikṣhepa, rnam par g.yeng ba); and non-introspection (asaṃprajanya, shes bzhin ma yin pa).

The Dergé redaction: Although lack of awareness is the cause of existence, that is not stated; it is craving that is named because it impels the continuum. Karma [is also not stated as the cause] because it is what comes next. 215 “Karma” (las) means action, but the term can be used to mean the process of causes leading to their corresponding results. Readers should bear in mind that whenever “karma” is used, both meanings may be applicable. 216 This is the explanation found in the Co mpendium of Abhidharma, Chapter 2. See Dg.T. Beijing 76:215; and Boin-Webb 2001, 112. It may be compared to the Expla-nation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 4, commentary for verse 1, which states that intended karma is either a physical action or verbal one (and not mental). See Dg.T. Beijing 79:409; and Pruden 1988, 551–2. 217 Karmic paths (karma-mārga, las kyi lam): Saṃsāra has three paths: the mental afflic-tions, karma, and suffering. On the basis of the mental afflictions, karma is created. On the basis of karma, suffering occurs. On the basis of suffering, mental afflictions arise again. These three constitute an uninterrupted cycle: the path, or modality, of saṃsāra (’khor ba’i lam gsum/ nyon mongs pa’i lam dang/ las kyi lam/ sdug bsngal gyi lam gsum ste nyon mongs par brten nas las byed pa dang/ las byas par brten nas sdug bsngal ’byung ba/ sdug bsngal la brten nas nyon mongs pa skye zhing rgyun mi ’chad par ’khor ba’i rim pa’o) (GTCD).

Beijing 79:509; and Pruden 1988, 509. 218 Degenerative samādhis (za g bcas kyi ting nge ’dzin): The term “degenerative” (sāsrava, zag bcas) denotes that these states of meditation are tainted by ignorance, and thus cannot bring about liberation. 219 See also the Tr easury of Abhidharma, Chapter 4, verses 68d–78; Compendium of Abhidharma (Chapter 2); and Gampopa’s Ornament of Liberation (Thar pa rin po che’i rgyan). 220 Magic spells (or awareness-mantras) (vi dyāmantra, rig sngags): In Buddhist practices, awareness-mantras are used only in positive ways, but in other traditions these powerful mantras are used to harm others, hence the translation “magic spells” in such contexts. 221 The Treasury of Abhidharma (Chapter 4, verse 72ab) says, “If one dies before or at the same time, the actual [karmic path of killing] has not occurred, because [the killer] has been reborn in another body” (snga dang mnyam du shi ba la/ dngos med lus gzhan skyes phyir ro). Dg.T. Beijing 79:30. 222 Lay precepts (po ṣhadha, gso sbyong) (lit. “purification-renewal”) are eight vows, which include celibacy, taken for one day. See Kongtrul 1998, 100–1. In other con-texts poṣhadha is the monastic confession ceremony. See Kongtrul 1998, 131–3. 223 Something cognizable (vi jñapti, rnam pa rig byed) is a technical term found in Sarvāstivādin (or Vaibhāṣhika) abhidharma’s discussions on karma. It means an act that causes someone to know something, an act that is manifest to another"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"endnotes c 319consciousness; it is contrasted with incognizable, or incommunicable, acts (avijñapti-karma). See the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 4, verses 2–3. 224 Lying about spiritual attainments (mi chos bla ma’i rdzun) (lit. “a lie in which [one claims to have achieved] a state or qualities higher [than those of] human beings”): This type of lie constitutes a “defeat” (pham pa) in that it defeats or destroys one, and it specifically defeats or destroys a monastic’s vow not to lie.

Analytical cessations, or cessations resulting from knowledge, are the state of freedom from defiled phenomena, that is, mental afflictions. This cessation is attained through the power of the analysis of, or the wisdom (prajñā, shes rab) engaging, the four truths of noble ones. Nonanalytical cessations, or cessations not resulting from knowledge, are temporary absences of mental afflictions owing to the incompleteness of the necessary conditions. For example, when one concentrates intently on a specific task, one does not feel tired, but feelings of tiredness will return. See Pruden 1988, 59; and Hopkins 1983, 218. 280 Thub pa dgongs gsal.

The paths of release are the condi-tioned results, and the abandonment of eighty-nine types of mental afflictions are the unconditioned results. This is discussed in Chapter 6, verse 51 of the Treasury of Abhidharma; see Pruden 1988, 992–3. 283 The four results of shrāmaṇas (dge sbyong gi ’bras bu bzhi) are stream enterer (srota-āpanna, rgyun zhugs pa), once returner (sakṛid-āgāmin, lan cig phyir ’ong ba), non-returner (anāgāmin, phyir mi ’ong ba), and arhat (dgra bcom pa). See A Detailed Explanation of the Gradual Type, pp. 142–149. 284 In Tibetan scholarship there are different views on the relationship between the Vai bhāṣhika and Sautrāntika philosophical tenet systems and the eighteen orders (nikāya, sde pa). The following is based on the excellent overview by willemen and Dessein (Willemen et al. 1998, xi–xiii, 47, and 123–5). It seems that Sarvāstivādins developed from the Sthaviras (who with the Mahāsāṅghikas form the first divi-sion in the Shrāvakayāna followers) and mainly lived in Kashmir, Bactria, and Gandhāra. During the second century ce, Kashmiri Sarvāstivāda abhidharma schol-ars organized their literature into seven texts and wrote a compendium called the Great Exposition (*Mahāvibhāṣha). Owing to doctrinal differences, they became known as Vaibhāṣhikas, “Proponents of the Exposition.” During this period, the old Sarvāstivādins in Bactria and Gandhāra were called Sautrāntikas, meaning simply that they were non-Vaibhāṣhika Sarvāstivādins and, as such, distinguished them-selves, but they were not themselves a homogenous group. Kumāralāta (second century ce) is considered an important opponent of the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣhikas and a root teacher of the Sautrāntikas. During the seventh century, the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣhikas declined in power (attributable to the loss of patronage), and the original Sarvāstivādins became the dominant Sarvāstivāda group through the ninth century. By the end of that cen-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"324 C the treasury of knowledgetury, some of them were calling themselves Mūlasarvāstivādins, reflecting their view that they represented the original Sarvāstivāda perspective. Willemen states (1998, xiii) that as they “are basically the continuation of old non-Vaibhāṣhika Sarvāstivādins, their views can be found in many older Chinese texts, and in many Indian Sarvāstivāda manuscripts.” He concludes (ibid., xiii), “Actually, in the history of the Sarvāstivāda school, the Vaibhāṣhika ‘orthodoxy’ was a phenomenon limited in time and space. The mainstream [i.e., the non-Vaibhāṣhika Sarvāstivādins, also known as Sautrāntikas] temporarily lost ground, but after a few centuries regained it as Mūlasarvāstivāda.” 285 Bodhibhadra (By ang chub bzang po) (ca. 1000) was a master at Nālandā and one of Atīsha’s teachers. His Commentary on the “Compendium on the Heart of Wisdom” (Jñānasārasamuchchaya-nāma-nibandhana, Ye shes snying po kun las btus pa zhes bya ba’i bshad sbyar) (Toh. 3852; Dg.T. Beijing 57:891) is an explanation of Āryadeva’s Compendium on the Heart of Wisdom (Jñānasārasamuchchaya, Ye shes snying po kun las btus pa) (Toh. 3851; Dg.T. Beijing 57:851). 286 Vasubandhu discusses the Vaibhāṣhikas’ assertion that phenomena exist in the three ti mes in his Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 5, verses 25–26 (see Dg.T. Beijing 79:586–97; and Pruden 1998, 806–20). They are said to hold this view on the basis of the Buddha’s teachings and reasoning. Willemen summarizes (1998, 20) this as follows: (1) The past and future exist because the Bhagavat said that the knowledge-able, holy Śrāvaka does not take past matter (rūpa) into consideration and does not delight in future matter. (2) The Buddha also said that: “Consciousness arises because of two things: 1. the faculty of sight (cakṣurindriya) and the visible (rūpa), 2. the mind (manas) and factors (dharma).” As mental consciousness immediately follows visual perception, it is so that if the visible, perceived before by the organ of sight and therefore past, were no longer to exist, mental consciousness could not arise because of it. (3) If the object perceived, in the past, by the organ of sight were no longer to exist at the moment of consciousness, the latter would not arise, since there is no consciousness without an object. (4) If the past does not exist, how can a good or a bad action, in the future, yield its fruition? In fact, at the moment when the fruition is produced, the cause of maturation (vipākahetu)—i.e. the action—is past. 287 Great Detailed Exposition (Mahāvibhāṣha, Bye brag tu bshad pa chen mo, or Bye brag bshad mdzod [or mtsho] chen mo) (or Treasury/Ocean of Great Detailed Exposition), was translated into Tibetan from the Chinese by Fa Zun (bLo bzang chos ’phags) in 1949 but is yet unpublished. According to Buswell and Jaini (1996, 79 and 100), the Mahāvibhāṣha (Great Exposition) was written (or compiled) during the third council held in Kashmir (first century ce), when the Sarvāstivādin canon was codified. For a summary of the Mahāvibhāṣha, see Ichimura et al. 1996, 511–68; and Cox 1998, 229–39. (Note that the term Mahāvibhāṣha is not attested in Sanskrit; see Kritzer 2005, xxi.) 288 If the use of the name Mūlasarvāstivādin dates from the seventh century (as st ated by willemen in willemen et al. 1998, xiii), this remark would be better as “[Vaibhāṣhikas] are a particular instance of the Sarvāstivādins.” It could also apply to Sautrāntikas, who are also considered by some to be a subdivision of the Sarvāstivādins.

This name is derived from the word dṛṣṭānta (“example”), and it appears to refer to the group’s propensity for using examples or similes from the ordinary world to justify its doctrinal positions. It is not clear whether the terms Sautrāntika and Dārṣṭāntika are, respectively, positive and negative designations for the same group, different names for the same group at different periods, or terms for two different groups. However, . . . the commentators on the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya [Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma”] tend to view Sautrāntika and Dārṣṭāntika as essentially synonymous (Cox Disputed Dharmas 37–41). See also Cox 1988, 70n4; and Cox 1998, 106–10. 292 The four principles of the dharma (chos kyi sdom bzhi) are as follows. (1) All con-ditioned things are impermanent (’dus byas thams cad mi rtag pa). (2) Everything defiled involves suffering (zag bcas thams cad sdug bsngal ba). (3) All phenomena are empty and devoid of self-entity (chos thams cad stong zhing bdag med pa). (4) Nirvāṇa is a state of peace (mya ngan las ’das pa zhi ba). These are also known as the four seals of the Buddha’s teachings (lta bkar btags kyi phyag rgya bzhi). 293 The two types of absence of self-entity are the absence of a self of persons (pu dgalanairātmya, gang zag gi bdag med) and the absence of a self-entity of phe-nomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). The two obscurations (sgrib gnyis) are the afflictive obscurations (kleṣhāvaraṇa, nyon sgrib) and the cognitive obscurations (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya’i sgrib pa). 294 Ālaya (kun gzhi) is translated in many ways, some of which are “all-basis,” “univer-sal ground,” “all-ground,” “basis-of-all,” and “storehouse.” For in-depth studies of ālayavijñāna, see Schmithausen 1987; and Waldron 2003. 295 Ten bhūmis (sa bcu; ten levels or grounds): (1) Very Joyful (rab tu dga’ ba); (2) Stain-less (dri ma med pa); (3) Illuminating (’od byed pa); (4) Radiant (’od ’phro ba); (5) Difficult to Overcome (sbyang dka’ ba); (6) Manifest (mngon du gyur pa); (7) Gone Afar (ring du song ba); (8) Immovable (mi g.yo ba); (9) Excellent Intelligence (legs pa’i blo gros); and (10) Cloud of Dharma (chos kyi sprin). These are discussed in Book Nine, Part One (TOK, III:492–5). 296 This point is related to the statement on p. 129: “They assert that the truth of su ffering is [experienced] on the bhūmi of a buddha, meaning that the Buddha had matured aggregates that were impelled by previous karma and that he had a remainder of defiled karma.” Although Jamgön Kongtrul says that Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas agree about not asserting a transformation (gnas gyur), it is one of the issues Vasubandhu pres-ents as a point of disagreement between Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas in his Expla-nation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” (Chapter 2, commentary for verse 36) (Dg.T. Beijing 79:177; see Pruden 1988, 209). It has been noted by Davidson (1985, 168) and King (1998) that Sautrāntikas do assert a “transformation of a basis” (āshraya-parāvṛitta, rten ’gyur ba). King states (1998):"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326 C the treasury of knowledgeIn the critique of ‘possession’ (prapti) . . . Vasubandhu qua Sautrantika seems to utilise a notion which becomes of crucial importance in the subsequent Yoga-cara elaboration of the path to liberation, viz. asraya-paravrtti, the conversion of the basis. He states that verily, the physical basis of the Noble One has under-gone transformation by virtue of the path of vision and the path of cultivation such that those defilements that are allayed no longer have the ability to shoot forth. As rice seeds that are in a non-germinal (or impotent) state, just so one is called a ‘destroyer of the defilements’ with reference to the defilements of the physical basis (bhutasaraydh). 297 The four primordial wisdoms (jñāna, ye shes) are mirrorlike wisdom (me long lta bu’i ye shes), discriminating wisdom (sor rtogs ye shes), the wisdom of equality (mnyam nyid ye shes), and the wisdom that accomplishes activities (bya grub ye shes). when five wisdoms are listed, the fifth is the wisdom of the dharmadhatu (chos dbyings ye shes). 298 Cha (Ch va): the creator god of Bön, the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet.

The eighteen constituents (dhātus, khams bco brgyad) are the six objects of perception (visual forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, and phenomena), the six sense faculties, and six consciousnesses. The twelve sense spheres (āyatanas, skye mched bcu gnyis) are the six objects of the sense consciousnesses and the six sense faculties. The four modes of birth (skye gnas bzhi) are birth from a womb, birth from an egg, birth from heat and moisture, and spontaneous birth. The five kinds of beings (’gro ba lnga) are hell-beings, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, and gods (demigods are included with gods). GTCD: Among the four kinds of food (zas bzhi), coarse food (or “morsels”) is for the growth of the sense faculties of this body; food of contact nourishes the con-sciousnesses; mental food is what propels one towards future existences; and food of consciousness is what finalizes the next existence (zas bzhi/ kham gyi zas dang/ reg pa’i zas dang/ sems pa’i zas dang/ rnam shes kyi zas te bzhi ste/ tshe ’di la gnas dbang po rgyas pa’i don du kham zas dang/ brten pa rnam shes rgyas pa’i don du reg pa’i zas te gnyis dang/ phyi mar srid pa gzhan ’phen pa’i don du sems pa’i zas dang/ srid pa gzhan ’grub pa’i don du rnam shes kyi zas dang gnyis te bsdoms na bzhi’o).

The same list is found in the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 2, verse 34bd; see Pruden 1988, 205–6. 303 In this book Jamgön Kongtrul presents the Vaibhāṣhikas’ and Sautrāntikas’ posi-tions on the two truths as a shared assertion. In Book Seven, Part Two, he presents the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika views on the two truths separately and as differ-ent. One thing this reflects is the different Tibetan views regarding which teach-ers represent the Sautrāntika system. In this section, Jamgön Kongtrul says that Sautrāntika teachers include Saṅgharakṣhita and Shrīlāta, and he makes no men-tion of Dignāga or Dharmakīrti in the Sautrāntika presentation. However, in Book Seven, Part Two (TOK, III:35), he quotes Dharmakīrti’s Commentary on Valid Cogni-tion (Pramāṇavārttikakārikā, Tshad ma rnam ’grel) as the source of the Sautrāntika definition of the two truths. 304 Chapter 6, verse 4. Toh. 4089; Dg.T. Beijing 79:43. See Pruden 1989, 910. 305 “To halt the perceiving mind” (blo ’dor ba) means that the mind no longer identi-fies the object. For example, when a table is broken up, the mind no longer thinks “table” when looking at the broken bits. 306 In his Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” (Chapter 6, commentary for verse 4), Vasubandhu explains ultimate reality as follows:Ultimate reality is that which, even when broken up, is engaged by the mind; and it is that which, even [if] the mind eliminates other qualities from it, is [still] engaged by the mind. An example is form. It is possible to reduce that to minute particles, and it is even possible for the mind to eliminate its qualities of taste, [but] there will [still] be the mind that engages the nature of form. The same is the case with feelings and so forth. gang la bcom yang de’i blo ’jug pa kho na yin la/ blos chos gzhan bsal yang de’i blo ’jug pa de ni don dam par yod pa yin te/ dper na gzugs lta bu’o/ de la rdul phra bar tu bcom yang rung/ blos ro la sogs pa’i chos bsal kyang rung gzugs kyi rang bzhin gyi blo ’jug pa nyid de/ tshor ba la sogs pa yang de bzhin du blta bar bya’o. Dg.T. Beijing 79:695–6. Buescher demonstrates (2005, 74) that Shrīlāta (a Sautrāntika) provides a similar definition: Saṃghabhadra, in the Samaya-pradīpika, quoted the Sthavira sectarian Śrīlāta’s definition of the two truths, which also relied upon the idea of substance:That which exists in many substances is conventional; that which exists in a single substance is ultimate. Moreover, if, when one divides it, the thing (dharma) in question loses its original name, it is conventional; if it does not lose it, it is ultimate. Co x explains (1995, 138) the position of Saṅghabhadra (a Vaibhāṣhika) as follows:Saṅghabhadra . . . distinguishes two types of existence: existence as a real entity (dravyasat), which is equated with absolute existence (paramārthasat), and existence as a provisional entity (prajñāptisat), equated with conventional existence (saṃvṛtisat). The former category of real entities includes the ultimate constituent factors such as visible form or feelings, which produce cognition"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"32\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgewithout depending on anything else. The latter category of provisional entities includes entities such as a pot or an army, which can produce cognition only in dependence upon a real entity that serves as its basis. This dependence upon real entities may be either direct, as in the case of a pot, which depends directly upon the fundamental material elements (mahābhūta) of which it is made, or indirect, as in the case of an army, which depends first upon other provisional entities—that is, its human members—and secondarily upon real entities—that is, the ultimate factors of which these humans are composed. Her e, by “dependence,” Saṅghabhadra does not understand causal depen-dence; all conditioned factors, real entities and provisional entities alike, are causally dependent or are related through conditioning interaction. Rather, “dependence” in the case of a provisional entity refers to the possibility of fur-ther analysis; any entity that can be analyzed further into constituent elements is considered “dependent” upon those elements. The possibility of further analysis then becomes the criterion by which conventional (saṃvṛtisatya) and absolute truth (paramārthasatya) are distinguished. If the notion of a particular entity disappears when that entity is broken (e.g., a pot) or can be resolved by cognition into its components (e.g., water), that entity exists only conven-tionally. Entities that are not subject either to this further material or mental analysis exist absolutely. Thus, actual existence as a real entity (dravyasat) is attributed only to the ultimate constituent factors, which are not subject to further analysis. Buescher (2005, 75) sums up the difference between the views of the Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas regarding what is ultimate as follows:The Vaibhāṣikas, as the Abhidharmakośa made clear, regarded the aggregates, the sources, and the constituents (or “types”) as ultimates, and held that even one atom of “form,” for example, qualified as a “form aggregate” (rūpaskandha). On the other hand, the Sautrāntikas as described in the Abhidharmakośa (and by Śrīlāta) held that, of these three categories, only the constituents (dhātu) were ultimates. For more on the Vaibhāṣhikas’ explanations of what is ultimate, see Pruden 1988, 77–80 and 1989, 910–1; Buescher 2005, 66–83; Cox 1995, 133–58; Matilal 1986, 240–50; Newland 1999, 18–22; and williams 1981. 307 Capable of performing a function (arthakriyāsamartham, don byed nus pa): An entity (dngos po) performs the function of producing its own specific result, such as later moments of its own continuum or a consciousness perceiving that specific phenom-enon. (See Dreyfus 1997, 66.) Since here Jamgön Kongtrul presents ultimate reality from a perspective that is both Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika, this paragraph combines positions that in Book Seven, Part Two (TOK, III:35), he attributes separately. There he says that Vaibhāṣhikas consider the partless moments of cognition and partless minute par-ticles to be ultimate reality, and that the Sautrāntikas’ presentation of the two truths is that whatever is ultimately able to perform a function is ultimately existent, and whatever is not ultimately able to perform a function is conventionally existent. 308 Element-derivatives (’b yung ’gyur) are the five sense objects: visible forms (rūpa, gzugs), sounds (shabda, sgra), smells (gandha, dri), tastes (rasa, ro), and tangible objects (spraṣhṭavya, reg bya). 309 See n. 302."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"endnotes c 329 310 The formative forces not associated [with forms or mind] (viprayuktasaṃskāra, ldan min ’du byed)—often shortened in translation to “non-associated formative forces” (and also translated as “non-associated compositional factors” or “non-associated formations”)—are a category of conditioned phenomena and the third of the five bases (the other four being forms, mind, mental events, and unconditioned phenom-ena). The Treasury of Abhidharma (Chapter 2, verses 35bcd–36ab) lists fourteen types of formative forces not associated [with forms or mind] (viprayuktasaṃskāra, ldan min ’du byed): (1) obtainment (or possession) (prāpti, thob pa); (2) non-obtainment (or non-possession) (aprāpti, ma thob pa); (3) homogeneous character (or equal status) (sabhāgatā, skal mnyam); (4) a state of non-discrimination (asaṃjñika, ’du shes med pa); (5) absorption (or equipoise) without discrimination (asaṃjñisamāpatti, ’du shes med pa’i snyoms ’jug); (6) absorption (or equipoise) of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti, ’gog pa’i snyoms ’jug); (7) life-force (or vitality) (jīvita, srog); (8–11) the four char-acteristics (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid) of arising (or of birth) (jāti, skye ba), aging (jarā, rga ba), duration (sthiti, gnas pa), and impermanence (anityatā, mi rtag pa); (12) the group of names (nāmakāya, ming gi tshogs); (13) the group of phrases (padakāya, tshig gi tshogs); and (14) the group of letters (or of syllables) (vyañjanakāya, yi ge’i tshogs).

They explain those by saying that the Buddha, like an arhat with remainder, had a remainder of karma. 320 See pp. 132–133 for a list of these seven treatises. 321 Udānavarga, Ched du brjod pa’i tshoms, compiled by Dharmatrāta, who lived some-time between 75 BCE and 200 CE (according to Sparham 1986, 19). According to the notes in the Dergé Kangyur, Vaibhāṣhikas considered this to be a sūtra (i.e., the words of the Buddha Shākyamuni), whereas Sautrāntikas considered it a shāstra (i.e., composed by followers of the Buddha). See Catalogue of the Nyingma Edition of the sDe-dge bKa’-’gyur/bsTan-’gyur, 1:498. As said there, this is “the Northern Buddhist version of the Pāli and Prakṛit Dhammapāda.” See also the translation by Sparham 1986. 322 Among the non-associated formative forces, three are related to this point: the group of names (nāmakāya, ming gi tshogs), the group of phrases (padakāya, tshig gi tshogs), and the group of letters (vyañjanakāya, yi ge’i tshogs). See Pruden 1988, 250–4; Hopkins 1983, 269; and Cox 1995, 160–3. 323 This is the position of the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣhikas and is discussed in the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 1, commentary for verse 43. See Pruden 1989, 120–2. 324 This is in contrast to the Sautrāntika position that a sense consciousness apprehends an object through the intermediary of its image (or representation; aspect) (ākāra, rnam pa), and does not apprehend the object itself. See Dreyfus 1997, 335–9; and Klein 1998, 100–113. 325 The five bases (mū la, gzhi) are forms (rūpa, gzugs); mind (chitta, sems); mental events (chaitta, sems byung); formative forces not associated [with forms or mind] (viprayuktasaṃskāra, ldan min ’du byed); and unconditioned phenomena (asaṃskṛita, ’dus ma byas). Vaibhāṣhikas state that these five are entities (dngos po), phenomena (chos), existents (yod pa), and knowable objects (shes bya). They then divide entities into conditioned phenomena (’dus byas) and unconditioned phenomena (’dus ma byas). Sautrāntikas differ in that they state that phenomena, existents, and know-able objects are equivalent, and then divide phenomena into entities and nonentities (dngos med). 326 It seems that Jamgön Kongtrul is drawing on a definition of non-associated forma-tive forces, which can be found in Vasubandhu’s Delineation of the Five Aggregates (Pañchaskandha-prakaraṇa, Phung po lnga’i rab tu byed pa; Toh. 4059; Dg.T. 77:42).

In Jamgön Kongtrul’s remark “that which bear a state” (gnas skabs can) are forms, mind, and mental events to which states (gnas skabs)—that is, the non-associated formative forces—are designated. The point here is that Vaibhāṣhikas state that non-associated formative forces are substantially existent and that they have the same status as forms, minds, and mental events (both of which are positions that the Sautrāntikas do not agree with). I am grateful to Artemus Engle for help with this passage and directing me to this source. 327 Vaibhāṣhikas consider whatever is substantially existent (dr avyasat, rdzas yod) to be ultimate reality (paramārthasatya, don dam bden pa). See also n. 306. 328 Space, analytical cessations, and nonanalytical cessations. See n. 279. 329 A determination (pariccheda, yongs gcod) is the result of a negation, which may be either an implicative negation or a nonimplicative negation, and thus a determina-tion (or conclusion) may be either an affirmation or a complete negation. Generally, this term is used to indicate the result of an implicative negation, and as such it refers to the ascertainment of something that remains after the exclusion of other features. For example, if you mistakenly take a striped rope to be a snake, but upon closer inspection see that it is not a snake, you have eliminated, or negated, the rope being a snake, and you have determined the object to be a rope. Note that this term is also translated as “positive determination” or “positive inclusion.” 330 Jamgön Kongtrul’s wording is precise: unconditioned phenomena are not co ndi-tioned entities which perform functions. Other Tibetan commentators explain that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that unconditioned phenomena do perform functions although their function is not as defined for conditioned entities (see n. 307). For example, the Geluk commentator Ngawang Palden explains (Hopkins 2003, 242):Among the four Buddhist tenet systems, only this system asserts that a perma-nent phenomenon such as uncompounded space is able to perform a function and thus is an effective thing. For instance, the lack of obstructive contact that space affords performs the function of allowing movement to take place. Since both permanent and impermanent phenomena are asserted to be effective things in this system, functionality is not limited to producing causal sequences as it is in the higher Buddhist schools; instead, as with uncompounded space, function-ality can refer to allowing or opening the way for something to occur. Jamyang Shepa (’Jam dbyangs bzhad pa) says (Buescher 2005, 105):Vaibhāṣikas assert that the entity of an analytical cessation is a substantially existent, permanent, and virtuous, unconditioned thing. For they assert it as unconditioned in the sense of lacking causes and conditions, a thing (bhāva) in that it performs the function of causing an affliction to cease . . . 331 Chapter 2, verse 55d.

The views of these four masters are often cited by Vasubandhu in his Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” and they are said to be particularly important within the Vaibhāṣhika abhidharma tradition in that they represent four different interpretations of how phenomena exist in the three time periods. Of the four, only Vasumitra’s works are found in the Tengyur.

See n. 310. 353 This is a case where a determination (or what is determined) (pariccheda, yongs gcod) is the outcome of a nonimplicative negation.

The other two are the meditation aimed at acquiring good qualities (yon tan sgrub pa’i bsam gtan), and the meditation of working for the welfare of others (sems can gyi don la dmigs pa’i bsam gtan). 355 The Treasury of Abhidharma (Chapter 6, verse 56a) states that there are six types of arhats, one of which is called “those who regress” (parihāṇadharman, yongs su nyams pa’i chos can). The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” contains a lengthy discussion of these types and whether they can regress or not. Sautrāntikas argue their point by saying, “If it is possible for one to regress from the state of an arhat, why did the Bhagavat say an arhat could only regress from the higher mental state [i.e., meditative concentration] that abides in the ease, or bliss, of this life? Therefore, the liberation of all arhats is to be considered unwavering” (gal te yang dgra bcom pa nyid las yongs su nyams pa srid pa zhig tu gyur na/ ci’i phyir bcom ldan ’das kyis thong ba’i chos la bde bar gnas par lhag pa’i sems las byung ba dag kho na las yongs su nyams par ’gyur bar gsungs par gyur te/ de’i phyir dgra bcom pa thams cad kyi rnam par grol ba ni mi g.yo ba yin par khong du chud do) (Dg.T.

This statement is in contrast to his point about Vaibhāṣhikas in the previous section: “. . . they are not able to posit that the nonimplicative negation that is the simple negation of the self of persons is thusness (tathātā, de bzhin nyid)” (TOK, II:472.15). (This reading was confirmed by altg.) 358 Saṅgharakṣhita (dGe ’dun srung ba) (early sixth century): According to Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India, Saṅgharakṣhita was a student of Nāgamitra and a teacher of Buddhapālita and Vimuktasena.

Vasubandhu’s Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhi-dharma” and its commentaries were, and still are, Tibetan scholars’ main source for the Sautrāntika view. 361 Shākyaprabha says in his Luminous (Prabhāvatī, ’Od ldan) (Toh. 4125; Dg.T. Beijing 93:415) that the Sarvāstivādins were the single original order from which the other orders split. Bhāvaviveka says in Chapter 4 of his Blaze of Reasoning (Tarkajvālā, rTog ge ’bar ba) (Toh. 3856; Dg.T. Beijing 58:361) that the two root orders were the Sthaviras and Mahāsāṅghikas. In the same text, Bhāvaviveka says (Dg.T. Beijing 58:364) that another presentation is that there were three root orders: Sthaviras, Mahāsāṅghikas, and Vibhajyavādins. See also Bareau 1989; Dutt 1978; Hopkins 2003, 210–18; and Obermiller 1932, 94–7. 362 This is the presentation of Vinītadeva in his Compendium on the Different Orders (Samayabhedoparachanachakre Nikāyabhedopadeshanasaṃgraha, gZhung tha dad pa rim par bklag pa’i ’khor lo las sde pa tha dad pa bstan pa bsdus pa) (Toh. 4140; Dg.T. Beijing 93:1166–71). In his History of Buddhism (Chos ’byung), Butön says (Ober-miller 1932, 95) that “Vinītadeva and the master of Varṣhāgra-pṛichchhā assert that there were four root orders.” In Hopkins 2003, 210, the latter master is identified as Padma (not to be confused with Padmasambhava from Oḍiyāna), and Hopkins (2003, 1028) identifies the text as dGe tshul gyi dang po’i lo dri ba (P5634, vol. 127) and dGe slong gi dang po’i lo dri ba (P5649, vol. 127). For the subdivisions of the four orders according to Padma, see Hopkins 1983, 718. 363 In this section I believe that Jamgön Kongtrul has abbreviated Mūlasarvāstivādins twice to Sarvāstivādins (as is often done in Tibetan histories and is done by Butön, upon whom Jamgön Kongtrul draws heavily); however, this should not give the impression that these terms are necessarily to be used interchangeably. Dessein says (Willemen et al. 1998, 88) that “the Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda communi-ties seem to have been two independent monastic communities.” Cox notes (1995, 45n38) that Schmithausen “argues that even though no consensus has yet been reached about the relationship between the Sarvāstivādins and Mūlasarvāstivādins, the simplest explanation for systematic differences and similarities in their litera-ture is to assume that they were separate but interacting groups with their own progressively revised and mutually influenced collections.” Yamabe (2003, 225–6) says, “Concerning the exact relationship between the appellations ‘Sarvāstivāda’ and ‘Mūlasarvāstivāda,’ Enomoto Fumio has recently suggested that the word ‘Mūlasarvāstivāda’ represents the Sarvāstivādin claim that the Sarvāstivāda was the root (mūla) of the other sects; thus, according to him, ‘Mūlasarvāstivāda’ does not refer to a subsect of the Sarvāstivāda tradition.” See above n. 284. For more on these schools, see willemen et al. 1998, xi–xiii; and Cox 1995, 23–9. 364 The following presentation draws on Butön’s History of Buddhism (Obermiller 1932, 96–7) and Pawo Tsuk-lak Trengwa’s Feast for Scholars: A History of the Dharma (Chos ’byung mkhas pa’i dga’ ston; 1:62–7) but not exclusively (e.g., some of the informa-tion on patch numbers, symbols, and name endings is different, for which Jamgön Kongtrul says he followed “Atīsha’s exegesis (gsung sgros),” a source I have not been able to identify). 365 The Sanskrit for the name endings is based on MVP. 366 The presentation of tenets for this order and the other three is derived from Vinītadeva’s Compendium on the Different Orders (Dg.T.

This was not, however, a universally accepted explanation.

Most of its translations are meant to convey the idea of being incapable of being spoken about or described. Nowhere, I believe, do the Pudgalavādins [Proponents of Persons] define the term in this way. The meaning of the term is “inexplicable,” i.e., incapable of being explained as either other than or the same in existence as the phenomena in dependence upon which it is conceived. williams and Tribe sum up (2000, 126) the position advocated by this school regarding an inexplicable self of persons:Adherents of the pudgala [person] claim that it is neither the same as nor differ-ent from the aggregates. If it were the same as the aggregates then the pudgala would be conditioned, and when the aggregates were destroyed the person would be destroyed. This would be annihilationist, . . . On the other hand if the pudgala were different from the aggregates it would be unconditioned, in fact a Self like the ātman, and subject to all the Buddhist criticisms of the concept of a"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"336 C the treasury of knowledgeSelf. This would be to fall into the great mistake of eternalism. Thus the pudgala is neither identical to nor different from the aggregates, and neither condi-tioned nor unconditioned. In fact, it is said to be ‘indefinable’ (avaktavya). Most of our understanding of the Saṃmitīyas’ views of an inexplicable self [or per-son] come from the ninth chapter of Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma, where he devotes one section of his refutation of a self to refuting the Vātsīputrīyas’ asser-tions of an inexplicable person. Vātsīputrīyas, who are one of the five Saṃmitīya orders, are referred to by Vasubandhu as Pudgalavādins, Proponents of Persons. See Pruden 1990, 1314–42.

See Pruden 1988, 581. These are also listed in Kongtrul 1998, 88–9; and TOK, II:38. 410 The nine scriptural categories (navāṅga pravachana, gsung rab yan lag dgu) are (1) sūtras (or discourse) section (sūtra, mdo’i sde); (2) section of discourses in mixed verse and prose (geya, dbyangs kyis bsnyad pa’i sde); (3) section of prophecies (vyākaraṇa, lung du bstan pa’i sde); (4) section of verses (gāthā, tshigs su bcad pa’i sde); (5) section of meaningful expressions (udāna, ched du brjod pa’i sde); (6) section of introductory remarks (nidāna, gleng gzhi’i sde); (7) section of extensive teachings (vaipulya, shin tu rgyas pa’i sde); (8) section on marvels (abdhutadharma, rmad du byung ba’i sde); (9) and section presenting ascertainments (gtan la phab pa’i sde) (GTCD). See TOK, I:348–50. 411 The sixteen aspects of the four truths (each truth has four aspects) are discussed in Chapter 2: The Presentation Summarizing the General Characteristics [of the Four Truths], pp. 115–119. 412 The progression from stream enterer to arhat has two aspects: relinquishment and realization. The process of relinquishment is described in terms of abandoning the mental afflictions associated with the nine levels of the three realms (desire, form, and formless), where the first level is the desire realm, levels two through five are the four concentrations of the form realm, and levels six through nine are the four spheres of the formless realm. Since each level has nine afflictions associated with it—three degrees of large afflictions (i.e., strong large, middling large, and weak large), three degrees of medium afflictions, and three degrees of small afflic-tions—there are eighty-one afflictions that are the factors to be abandoned. This is discussed in the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 6, commentary for verses 33–49. See Pruden 1989, 956–86. See also Cox 1992; and Hopkins 1983, 96–109. 413 See the Treasury of Abhidharma (Chapter 6, verse 30a); and Pruden 1989, 953. Wangchuk Dorjé (Youthful Play, p. 427) clarifies that they have abandoned up to and including five factors: “the term ‘up through,’ [which could also mean ‘up to’ in other contexts, here] means ‘[from] one up through two, three, four, or five’” (bar du’i sgras ni gcig gam gnyis gsum bzhi dang lnga’i bar bzung ngo)."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"endnotes c 339 414 Once they abandon the sixth factor, they are a once returner. 415 In this context, “moments” (skad cig) do not mean the smallest unit of time but rather the time it takes to complete the investigation of each of the sixteen aspects of the four truths. According to the Treasury of Abhidharma, the first fifteen moments belong to the path of seeing and the sixteenth moment is the path of meditation. According to the Compendium of Abhidharma, all sixteen moments are the path of seeing. See n. 422. 416 The translation “acceptance of phenomena” for chos bzod (dharmakṣhānti) is based on GTCD, which says: “Acceptance of phenomena [means] acceptance of the real-ization of phenomena. This refers to the uninterrupted path that is the antidote for the factors to be abandoned by the path of seeing. This occurs following the end of supreme qualities, when the phenomena (dharma, chos) comprising the desire realm are seen just as they are in terms of the four truths” (chos bzod/ chos la rtogs pa’i bzod pa ste/ chos mchog gi mjug tu ’dod khams kyis bsdus pa’i chos la bden bzhi ji lta mthong bas mthong spang spangs te bral ’bras nyams su myong ba rnam grol lam mo). This term (dharmakṣhānti, chos bzod) is also translated as “doctrinal forbearance,” “dharma endurance,” and “patient acceptance of the dharma,” and is explained as such. Levinson states (1994, 190–191), “The ‘doctrine’ endured by uninterrupted paths and known by paths of release is selflessness.” See also the reference from Cox 1992 in the next note. 417 Again, the translation of “knowledge of phenomena” for chos shes (dharmajñāna) is based on GTCD, which says: “Knowledge of phenomena [refers to] the path of release that is actualization of the result of separation, and the relinquishment of the factors to be abandoned by the path of seeing. This occurs when the phenomena (dharma, chos) comprising the desire realm are seen just as they are in terms of the four truths” (chos shes/ ’dod khams kyis bsdus pa’i chos la bden bzhi ji lta mthong bas mthong spang spangs te bral ’bras nyams su myong ba rnam grol lam mo). Note that this term is also translated as “doctrinal knowledge” and so on. Cox explains (1992, 99n56): “The term dharmajñāna is ambiguous: ‘dharma’ can refer to the doctrine, as possibly in the Mahāvibhāṣha . . . or, ‘dharma’ can refer to those fac-tors belonging to the realm of desire specifically, as in the Saṅgītiparyāya, in which case anvayajñāna [subsequent knowledge] would refer to the subsequent knowledge of those factors belonging to the realm of form and the formless realm . . .” 418 Acceptance of phenomena (dharmakṣhānti, chos bzod), knowledge of phenomena (dharmajñāna, chos shes), subsequent acceptance (anvayakṣhānti, rjes bzod), and sub-sequent knowledge (anvayajñāna, rjes shes) form two pairs: acceptance of phenomena and subsequent acceptance, which are called uninterrupted paths (ānantaryamārga, bar chad med pa’i lam); and knowledge of phenomena and subsequent knowledge, which are paths of release (vimuktimārga, rnam par grol ba’i lam). Uninterrupted paths are when the mental afflictions are abandoned, and paths of release are the state when the abandonment of a particular affliction is experienced. These are likened to throwing out a thief and locking the door. See the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 6, commentary for verse 28ab, and Chapter 7, verse 1; Book Nine, Part One (TOK, III:482); Cox 1992, particularly 82–91; and Hopkins 1983, 96–9. 419 In this sequence of four moments, the first two moments relate to the desire realm and the last two to the form and formless realms.

See Dg.T. Beijing 79:222; and Pruden 1989, 950–2. The Compendium of Abhidharma (Chapter 2) states that the sixteen moments are the path of seeing. See Dg.T.

See the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 6, verse 34ab; and Pruden 1989, 958–60. 426 This might seem to contradict the earlier comment that “the relinquishments of those who abide in the result of a stream enterer are the same as those on the previous level,” since those approaching the result of a stream enterer “may have abandoned the fourth or fifth” affliction of the desire realm. However, it seems to be a particular feature of “those born into the same class” that they have not aban-doned the fifth factor. See the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 6, commentary for verse 34cd; and Pruden 1989, 963. 427 Note that verse 34cd of the Treasury of Abhidharma (Chapter 6) says that those born into the same class will take two or three more rebirths (tshe gnyis gsum du rigs nas rigs). Also the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma,” Chapter 6, commentary for verse 34cd, states that there are two types of “those born into the same class”: those who will be reborn two or three times as a god and those who will be reborn"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"endnotes c 341two or three times as a human, depending on whether they attained abiding in the result of a stream enterer as a god or as a human. See Pruden 1989, 963. 428 It is said that there are two types of abiders in the result of a once returner: the seeming abider in the result of a once returner (phyir ’ong ’bras gnas tsam po ba) and the special abider in the result of a once returner, who has one interruption for one life (phyir ’ong ’bras gnas khyad par can tshe gcig bar chad gcig pa bcas) (GTCD). I have not located any reference to a seeming abider in the Treasury of Abhidharma; it is, however, a term used in Maitreya’s Ornament of Clear Realization (Abhisamayālaṃkāra, mNgon rtogs rgyan); see Brunnhölzl 2001. 429 The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” (Chapter 6, commentary for verse 36ac) explains the meaning of the name “those interrupted for one life” (ekavīchika, tshe gcig bar chad pa): “‘interruption,’ meaning what creates an interruption or inter-val, is used because the nirvāṇa of this person is interrupted by one lifetime, or because the result of a nonreturner is interrupted by one factor of the mental afflic-tions” (bar chad ces bya ba ni bar chad byed pa’o/ de’i mya ngan las ’da’ ba la tshe gcig gis chod pa’i phyir ram/ phyir mi ’ong ba’i ’bras bu la nyon mongs pa’i rnam pa gcig gis chod pa’i phyir). See Dg.T. Beijing 79:731; and Pruden 1989: 965. 430 Since the ninth affliction is the last affliction of the desire realm, an abider in the result of a nonreturner does not take rebirth in the desire realm, which is the mean-ing of “nonreturner”: one who does not return to the desire realm. See Pruden 1989, 965. 431 The form realm has seventeen levels, which are grouped according to the four concentrations (dhyāna, bsam gtan). Great Brahmā (Mahābrahmāṇa, Tshangs chen) is the third level of the first concentration. The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhi-dharma” states (Chapter 6, commentary for verse 38ab): “A noble being will not take birth in Great Brahmā. Why? Because it is a place of beliefs and where there is only one leader” (’phags pa ni tshangs chen pa dag gi nang du mi skye ste/ ci’i phyir zhe na/ lta ba’i gnas yin pa’i phyir dang/ gtso bo gcig tu zad pa’i phyir dang). Dg.T. Beijing 79:733. Pruden’s translation (1989, 968) elaborates: “An Āryan is never reborn among the Mahābrahmas, because this heaven is a place of heresy: one considers Mahābrahma as the creator there; and because only one leader can be found there: an Āryan would be superior to Mahābrahma there.” 432 The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” (Chapter 6, commentary for verse 37ac) specifies that the term ’du byed here means “application” or “to fully engage”: “Those who fully pass beyond misery through application are those who, after they are born [in one of the formless states,] do not put aside their application and con-tinue to fully engage [the path,] and thus fully pass beyond misery” (mngon par ’du byed pa dang bcas pas yongs su mya ngan las ’da’ ba ni skyes nas sbyor ba ma btang zhing mngon par ’du byed pa dang bcas pas yongs su mya ngan las ’da’ ba gang yin pa).

Also called the sphere of Neither Discrimination nor Nondiscrimina-tion (’du shes med min gyi skye mched)."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"342 C the treasury of knowledge 435 Brahmā Type (Brahmakāyika, Tshangs ris) is the first level of the first concentration of the form realm. 436 The four pure states (gtsang gnas bzhi) are the first four of the last five levels of the fourth concentration of the form realm (the last being Akaniṣhṭha). Only noble beings are born in these last five levels, hence the name “pure states.” 437 I have not been able to locate the source of this quotation and thus am not certain of its meaning. It may be a corruption of verse 38c, Chapter 6, of the Treasury of Abhidharma: “Others who go through the formless are of four types” (gzhan ni gzugs med ’gro rnam bzhi). See Pruden 1989, 969. 438 There is no bardo, or intermediate state, for those who take birth in the formless realm; they are born there directly. See Wangchuk Dorjé’s Youthful Play, p. 436. 439 The Treasury of Abhidharma says (Chapter 6, verse 38c) that there are four types who go to the formless realm and pass beyond misery. Although the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” only says that these four are “those who pass beyond misery after birth and the others” (skyes nas yongs su mya ngan las ’da’ ba la sogs pa’i bye brag gis rnam pa bzhi), Pruden (1989, 966 and 969–70) provides a list of these four: those who pass beyond misery after birth (upapadyaparinirvāyin), those who pass beyond misery through application (sābhisaṃskāraparinirvāyin), those who pass beyond misery without application (anabhisaṃskāraparinirvāyin), and those who rise to a higher state (ūrdhvasrotas). This accords with Jamgön Kongtrul’s remark, the only difference being that he refers to “those who rise to a higher state” as “three types of leapers” (’phar gsum). 440 See the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 6, verse 43cd.

The first classification is presented in the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 6, verses 63–64b (see Dg.T.

See n. 252. 444 The Treasury of Abhidharma states (Chapter 7, verse 44a) that the supercognitive abilities can only operate on the level (or realm) in which the being who possesses them dwells or on a lower level, but not on a higher level. For example, if an arhat dwells in the form realm, his or her supercognitive abilities will operate in the form and desire realms but not in the formless realm. See Pruden 1990, 1161. 445 The Compendium of Abhidharma explains (Chapter 2) that ornamented cessation is attained by those with twofold liberation, and unornamented cessation is attained by those liberated by means of wisdom.

The realization of the absence of a self-entity of phenomena has two aspects: that the perceived object (gzung ba) has no self-entity and that the perceiver (’dzin pa) has no self-entity. Pratyekabuddhas are said to only realize the former, thus they only realize half the absence of self-entity of phenomena. 454 Akṣhayamati-nirdesha-ṭīkā, bLo gros mi zad pas bstan pa’i mdo ’grel.

This fact has been offered (Norman 1983) in support of the theory that the original term for such buddhas was pratyaya-buddha, “enlightened by an external cause,” and that the term pratyeka-buddha, “solitarily enlightened,” results from a later and historically inaccurate San-skritization.” See Norman 1983. Jamyang Shepa (in Hopkins 2003, 355–6) provides a detailed (Tibetan) presenta-tion of the etymology of pratyekabuddha: “In the Sanskrit original of Solitary Realizer (rang sangs rgyas) pratyekabuddha, eka is used for ‘one’ [or ‘alone’]; buddha is used for ‘realize’ (rtogs pa) or ‘understand’ (khong du chud pa). Hence, they are Solitary Realizers because of becoming buddhafied alone—that is to say, they ‘realize such-ness’—without scripture. [In another etymology] they are Realizers (buddha) of Con-ditionality (prati, that is, prayaya) through understanding the reverse process and so forth [of the twelve links] of dependent-arising within observing a skeleton in a cem etery . . .” Hopkins notes (2003, 356nb), “Thus the term ‘buddha’ that is part of their name does not mean that they are Buddhas; rather, it means ‘realizer.’” For a detailed overview of the descriptions of pratyekabuddhas and their path, see Ray 1994, 213–50."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"344 C the treasury of knowledge 457 This and the following quotations are found in Haribhadra’s [Revised Edition of the] “Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in Twenty-five Thousand Lines” (Pañchaviṃshatisāhasrikā- pra jñāpāramitā, Shes rab kyi pha rol ru phyin pa stong phrag nyi shu lnga pa).

The quotation is not found in that text; however, it similar enough to verse 27 of Nāgārjuna’s Praises of the Transcendent One (Lokātītastava, ’Jig rten las ’das par bstod pa) (Toh. 1120; Dg.T. Beijing 1:197) to consider it to be a quotation from that text. The differences in the wording between Nāgārjuna’s Praises of the Transcendent One and TOK do not change the meaning. Dg.T.

The four fearlessnesses (mi ’jigs pa) of a buddha are fearlessness regarding (1) realization, (2) relinquishment, (3) teaching the dharma to overcome obstacles, and (4) teaching the path of renunciation. The eighteen unique qualities of a buddha (sangs rgyas kyi chos ma ’dres pa) are buddhas (1) do not have confusion; (2) are not noisy; (3) are not forgetful; (4) always abide in equipoise; (5) do not have the perception [of things] as discrete; (6) do not have equanimity lacking in analysis; (7) do not have intentions that decline; (8) do not have diligence that diminishes; (9) do not have mindfulness that decreases; (10) do not have wisdom that degenerates; (11) do not have samādhi that declines; (12) do not have a liberation that regresses; (13) have physical activ-"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"346 C the treasury of knowledgeity that is preceded by and followed through with primordial wisdom; (14) have verbal activity that is preceded by and followed through with primordial wisdom; (15) have mental activity that is preceded by and followed through with primordial wisdom; (16) see the past through dispassionate, unobstructed primordial wisdom; (17) see the future through dispassionate, unobstructed primordial wisdom; and (18) see the present through dispassionate, unobstructed primordial wisdom.

See Chapter 6, pp. 177–185. 482 Vajrayāna is the subject of Part Four of Book Six (Systems of Buddhist Tantra, Kong-trul 2005). Jamgön Kongtrul lists it here to show that the Mahāyāna has two modes (even though he only discusses one of them in this part). This heading is the first root verse in Book Six, Part Four (Kongtrul 2005, 72): “[Here is presented] the resultant indestructible way of secret mantra.” 483 The outline heading here is slightly different from when the section is presented (see p. 166). 484 Elevated states (abhyudaya, mngon mtho): the god and human realms in which hap-piness is experienced. 485 Definitive excellence (niḥshreyasa, nges legs): states of lasting happiness, in other words, the states of liberation (thar pa) and omniscience (thams cad mkhyen pa). 486 See also the Introduction, p. 17, for a brief discussion of the meaning of “philosophi-cal” (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid) in this context. 487 The Pāramitāyāna is called the cause-based portion of the Mahāyāna path (in contrast to the Vajrayāna, called the result-based part of the path), because the Pāramitāyāna takes the causes of awakening (the six pāramitās and so forth) as the path, whereas the Vajrayāna takes the results of awakening (the kāyas and primor-dial wisdoms) as the path. Jamgön Kongtrul’s comment that the cause-based part of the Mahāyāna alone serves as the path to nonabiding nirvāṇa is in keeping with the position of the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorjé (see Chariot of the Dakpo Kagyu Siddhas, pp. 17–50), but is not held universally. For Tsongkhapa’s view that bud-dhahood cannot be attained through the practice of the Pāramitāyāna alone, that only through practicing the Vajrayāna can it be attained, see Dalai Lama et al. 1977, 60–70; Cozort 1986, 26; and Hopkins 2003, 687–92 (which includes Tak-tsang Lotsāwa’s objection to this view) and 1009–10. Jamgön Kongtrul adds the comment here that “the instrumental case [in the root verse, translated as “through” (yis),] connects these lines with the next ones.” Although it is part of the main text, I place this comment in the endnotes because it is relevant only to those reading the Tibetan text. Also note that the addition of “practitioners” in the root verse is in keeping with Jamgön Kongtrul’s point."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"endnotes c 347 488 The outline heading here is slightly different from when the section is first men-tioned (see p. 165). For the sake of consistency, I am using the first form, “A Detailed Account of the Systematic Presentation [of the Pāramitāyāna],” rnam gzhag rgyas par smos pa (TOK, II:491.11), as opposed to what is here, “The Actual Systematic Presentation,” rnam gzhag dngos (TOK, II:492.2). 489 “The two types of bodhichitta” means either conventional (or relative) bodhichitta (kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems) and ultimate bodhichitta (don dam byang chub kyi sems), or the two types of conventional bodhichitta, aspirational bodhichitta and engaged bodhichitta (smon ’jug byang chub sems). 490 Reading drang nges as grangs nges (TOK, II:492.18), which is the spelling used for this topic (TOK, II:496.8). 491 See Kongtrul 1998, 200–204. 492 Chapter 5, verses 436–437b.

The three of generosity are to give mate-rial aid (zang zin), to give the dharma (chos), and to protect others from their fears (mi ’jigs pa). The three of ethical conduct are to restrain one’s unwholesome behav-ior (nyes spyod sdom pa), to acquire good qualities (dge ba chos sdud pa), and to work for the benefit of others (sems can don byed pa). The three of patience are to withstand harm (gnod pa), to accept hardships (dka’ ba), and to fathom emptiness (stong nyid). The three of diligence are armor-like (go cha) diligence, the application (sbyor ba) of diligence, and insatiable (chog mi shes pa) diligence. The three of medi-tative concentration are to rest at ease in the present life (mthong chos bder gnas), to achieve good qualities (yon tan sgrub pa), and to focus on the welfare of others (sems can gyi don la dmigs pa). The three of wisdom are mundane (’jig rten) wisdom, lower transmundane (’jig rten ’das dman) wisdom, and higher transmundane (’jig rten ’das mchog) wisdom; or they are the wisdoms that arise through study (thos pa), critical reflection (bsam pa), and meditation (sgom pa).

In Tibet, however, it became a common term for the philosophical tenet system of those known in India as Yogāchāras (rNal ’byor spyod pa, Yoga Practitioners) and Proponents of Consciousness (Vijñānavādin, rNam shes smra ba). For an overview of the use of the term in Indian Buddhism, see Lindtner 1997. 520 Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādin or Vijñaptika, rNam rig smra ba). The use of this term to denote a school of thought probably evolved from the expression “cog-nition only” (vijñaptimātra, rnam rig tsam), which is found, for example, in the Sūtra Unraveling the Intention (Chapter 8); see Powers 1995, 155. Although it seems that “Proponents of Cognition” is used interchangeably with Proponents of Conscious-ness (Vijñānavādin, rNam shes smra ba), the latter is more common in Indian Bud-dhist texts. For example, the Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary (Negi 2001; vol. 7, pp. 3165 and 3175) lists four instances of Vijñānavādin (rNam par shes par smra ba) but only one for the form Vijñaptimātravādin (rNam par rig pa tsam du smra ba, Proponents of Mere Cognition), and none for Vijñaptivādin; and Vijñānavādin is found in the MVP, whereas Vijñaptivādin or Vijñaptimātravādin are not. I am grateful to Karl Brunnhölzl for help with this information. For more references relating to this term, see below n. 533.

Early uses of this term des-ignated Buddhist practitioners in general, but it later came to be associated with the works attributed to Maitreya, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu, possibly having been derived from the title of Asaṅga’s Yogāchārabhūmi (rNal ’byor spyod pa’i sa, Bhūmis of Yogic Practice). The first, or at least an early, use of “Yogāchāra” as referring to a school of thought is found in Bhāvaviveka’s Lamp of Wisdom (Prajñāpradīpa, Shes rab sgron ma), and his Heart of the Middle Way (Madhyamakahṛidayakārikā, dBu ma’i snying po’i tshig le’ur byas pa) and its auto-commentary, Blaze of Reasoning (Tarkajvālā, rTog ge ’bar ba). This became the most common term in India for follow-ers of the thought of Maitreya, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu, followed by “Proponents of Consciousness” (Vijñānavādin, rNam shes smra ba). See Hanson 1998, 3–11; and Davidson 1985, 51. 523 Although here Jamgön Kongtrul attributes this verse to the Abhidharma Sūtra (Chos mngon pa’i mdo), it is in fact one of the summarizing verses of the Compendium of the Mahāyāna.

In his Compendium of the Mahāyāna, Asaṅga says, “All phenomena arise in dependence upon the ālaya.

For verse 8, see below n. 534; verses 1 and 2 are quoted in Chapter 11, p. 253.

See Dg.T. Beijing 70:902–3. Simply put, the imagination of what is unreal is the aspect of the dependent nature that creates the sense of duality (gnyis snang). It could also be said that it is a term used for the dependent nature in its impure state. (See p. 181 for the two divisions of the dependent nature.) “Imagination” (parikalpa, kun rtog) includes both conceptual and nonconceptual cognition (rnam rig) or perception (blo) and the perceived referents, thus “imagination” is not identical with “thought” or “concept” (vikalpa, rnam rtog). As Urban and Griffiths say (1994, 14): “Parikalpa [imagination] . . . has the potential to be pure and error-free; vikalpa [thought] does not: it is what produces defilement and error in the flow of concepts and percepts.” Urban and Griffiths (1994, 12) also quote Sthiramati’s explanation in his Sub-Com-mentary on the “Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes” (Madhyāntavibhaṅga-ṭīkā, dBus dang mtha’ rnam par ’byed pa’i ’grel bshad) of Chapter 1, verse, 1:The compound ‘unreal comprehensive construction’ [or the imagination of what is unreal] may be understood to indicate that the duality comprehen-sively constructed either by it or in it is unreal. The term ‘unreal’ indicates that the extent to which something is comprehensively constructed in terms of a dichotomy between subject and object is the extent to which it does not exist. The term ‘comprehensive construction’ indicates that the extent to which an object is comprehensively constructed is the extent to which it is not found. They observe (12–3): “There is . . . an especially close relationship between abhūtaparikalpa [imagination of the unreal] and the relative (paratantra) aspect of experience . . . and this in turn suggests that when . . . parikalpa or parikalpana . . . [are used] it may sometimes denote, descriptively, the simple fact of the flow of experience, with all its finally illusory phenomenal properties of division between subject and object, ‘appearances,’ as MV-ṭ [Sthiramati’s Sub-Commentary] puts it, ‘that consist in objects, living beings, and selves and representations’ . . . Such locu-tions leave open the possibility that the phenomenally rich series of mental images that usually constitutes the flow of experience may occur without being accompa-nied by a sharp phenomenological distinction between subject and object . . . We might say that parikalpa[na] [imagination] and abhūtaparikalpa [imagination of the unreal] have a dual use: they can be used to denote both an undefiled nonerroneous flow of experience, and a defiled and mistaken set of percepts and concepts that results from constructive action upon that flow.” Nagao says (1991, 53): “The actualities of daily life are here [in the Madhyāntavibhaṅga I.1] summed up as ‘unreal notions,’ which are a discrimina-tion between, and attachment to, two things—the subject grasping and the object grasped (grāhaka, grāhya). This two-ness, though indispensable for discrimination or conceptualization, does not have any reality at all; here, emptiness is found to belong to the ‘unreal notion’ or ‘imagination.’ (The adjective ‘unreal’ is used to qualify the notions or imagination that singles out as existent things that are ‘non-reals,’ that is, ‘empty.’)” Boquist states (1993, 69): “To account for the fact of illusion, Maitreya intro-duces the concept of ‘the imagination of the unreal’ (abhūtaparikalpa). Ignorance and illusion require a mind and this mind constitutes the imagination of the unreal subject (grāhaka) and object (grāhya) expressed as a duality (dvaya). This very act of cognition is the dependent being (paratantrasvabhāva), which is real while the cog-nitive images reflecting the bifurcation into duality make up the imagined nature"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"352 C the treasury of knowledge(parikalpitasvabhāva), which is unreal. The imagination’s sole reality is the pure and unified awareness expressed as emptiness, suchness, or pure mind, which is within it and in which it resides. This absence of discriminative thinking is the consummated nature (pariniṣhpannasvabhāva).” For more discussion of this term, see Kochumuttom 1982, 29–72 and 222–4; Nagao 1991; Boquist 1993; Urban and Griffiths 1994; Hopkins 1999, 305–10; Mathes 2000; and Brunnhölzl 2004, 464–5. Note that this term is translated in vari-ous ways, including “unreal ideation,” and “unreal comprehensive construction.” 533 For a useful article on the term vijñapti (rnam rig; “cognition”) see Hall 1986. For a list of nine ways that this term has been translated by western and Asian scholars, see Hopkins 2003, 309–10nb. 534 This is related to the statement in the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes, Chapter 1, verse 8ab: “The imagination of what is unreal is mind as well as mental events belonging to the three realms” (yang dag ma yin kun rtog ni/ sems dang sems byung khams gsum pa). See Dg.T. Beijing 70:903; Anacker 1984/1998, 214; and Kochumuttom 1982, 238–9. 535 “Substantially established” (dravyasiddha, rdzas su grub pa) and “substantially exis-tent” (dravyasat, rdzas su yod pa) are synonyms in the Chittamātra system presented here by Jamgön Kongtrul. “Substantially established” is used to describe both the dependent characteristic and the consummate characteristic, and, therefore, neither term is necessarily synonymous with “truly existent” (bden par grup pa). (altg) 536 Imagined [characteristics] (parikalpita, kun brtag) are everything that is imputed on the basis of the dependent nature: all conceptual labels, universals (or generally characterized phenomena) (spyi mtshan), the idea of a self or of true existence. This term is also translated as “imputational character” and “imaginary nature.” 537 Floaters (kesha/ keshoṇḍuka, skra shad [’dzag pa]; “falling hairs”): In the West, float-ers, or muscae volitantes, are not considered the result of an eye disease (timira, rab rib) as they are said to be in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist texts. Nevertheless, the definitions of floaters and muscae volitantes seem to fit the traditional descriptions. Floaters: “a bit of optical debris (as a dead cell or a cell fragment) in the vitreous humor or lens that may be perceived as a spot before the eye”; muscae volitantes (“flying flies”): “spots before the eyes, usually in the form of dots, threads, beads, or circles, due to cells and cell fragments in the vitreous humor and lens” (Webster’s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged). For a more complete account, see Brunnhölzl 2004, 871n273. 538 The horns of a rabbit are a traditional example of something that simply does not exist. 539 “The consummate” (pariniṣhpanna, yongs grub) is also translated as “perfected,” “per-fectly existent,” “thoroughly established,” and so on. 540 An example of such teachings is found in the He art Sūtra: “There are no forms, no feelings, no discriminations, no formative forces, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, . . .” 541 The same divisions and, for the most part, similar explanations are found in Longchen Rabjam’s (kLong chen rab ’byams) The Precious Treasury of Philosophical Systems (Grub mtha’ mdzod) (forthcoming translation by Richard Barron), and Ke-drup Jé’s (mKhas grub rje) Great Digest (sTong thun chen mo) (see Cabezón 1992a, 67–8). Jamyang Shepa’s Great Exposition of Tenets (Grub mtha’ chen mo) (see Hopkins"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"endnotes c 3532003, 374–8) and Chang-kya Rolpé Dorjé’s Beautiful Ornament of Philosophical Tenet Systems (Grub mtha’ mdzes rgyan, 122–4) present the same divisions and similar explanation for the imagined and the dependent. In Book Six, Part Two, Jamgön Kongtrul provides these and other categorizations; see TOK, II:413–5. 542 “The appearance of the dualism of perceived objects and perceiving subject for the nonconceptual sense consciousnesses” (rtog med dbang shes la gzung ’dzin gnyis snang) means that the perceiving subject and its object appear to the sense consciousnesses as two discrete, separate things (tha dad du snang ba). The sense object is not the imagined, nor is the perceiving subject (the sense consciousness), but their appear-ance as a dualistic subject and object, separate and cut off from each other, is a nominal imagined characteristic (altg). See n. 544. 543 The description of the dependent nature as pure and impure is found in a number of Yogāchāra texts, for example, the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes, Chapter 1, verse 21: “If that [i.e., the dependent nature] were not defiled, all beings would be liberated. If it were not pure, efforts would yield no results” (gal te nyon mongs de ma gyur/ lus can thams cad grol bar gyur/ gal te rnam dag de ma gyur/ ’bad pa ’bras bu med par ’gyur). See Dg.T. Beijing 70:904; Anacker 1984/1998, 221; and Kochumuttom 1982, 245–6. See also the Compendium of the Mahāyāna, Chapter 2 (Dg.T. Beijing 76:40; and Keenan 1992, 47). 544 The implication of Jamgön Kongtrul’s statements (see also n. 542) is that there is a difference between “the appearance of the dualism of perceived object and perceiv-ing subject” (gzung ’dzin gnyis snang) and “dualistic appearance” (gnyis snang). Not all dualistic appearance is the dualistic appearance of an object and a subject. The dependent nature (cognition, or mind and mental events) appears as a duality (gnyis su snang ba) in that it has an externally oriented aspect and an internally oriented aspect (kha phyi bltas dang nang bltas). Putting this another way, in the Chittamātra system, all cognitions are both other-awareness (gzhan rig) and reflexive awareness (rang rig), but such cognition does not involve an ascertainment of a duality or split. The ascertainment (nges pa) of a duality of perceiver and percept, that is as split into two discrete, separate things, is considered the imagined characteristic. (altg) 545 Cognition during the subsequent state (rjes shes) is the mental state following a period of meditative equipoise, which technically is called a “subsequent state of attainment” (pṛiṣhṭhalabdha, rjes thob). See n. 747. 546 The division of the consummate into unchanging and unerring is specified in the Dif-ferentiation of the Middle and the Extremes, Chapter 3, verse 11bc: “The consummate has two aspects: its unchanging [aspect] and its unerring [aspect]” (’gyur med phyin ci ma log pa/ yongs su grub pa rnam pa gnyis). See Dg.T. Beijing 70:907; and Anacker 1984/1998, 237. 547 For a discussion of the path (mārga, lam) and its observed objects (ālambana, dmigs pa) as part of the consummate nature, see Brunnhölzl 2004, 465–9. 548 The analogy of an illusion (māyā, sgyu ma) is widely used in Buddhist texts; one frequently quoted source is Vasubandhu’s Exposition of the Three Natures, verses 27–30. Jamgön Kongtrul is clearly drawing from these verses:Through the power of [the magician’s] mantra, a magical creationappears like an elephant, [but] only an image appears—there is no elephant that exists. (27)"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"354 C the treasury of knowledgeThe imagined nature is like the elephant.The dependent is like that image.The nonexistence of the elephant thereis the consummate [nature].

Dg.T. Beijing 77:31–2. (Vasubandhu did not write an auto-commentary and no one else wrote a commen-tary.) Note that “fundamental mind” (rtsa ba’i sems) is the ālaya consciousness. Nagao (1991, 71-72) observes, “It should be clear from the magic show simile that the difference between the other-dependent nature and the imagined nature is very subtle and delicate; the former is compared to an elephant form and the latter to an attachment to that form. The difference is established on the basis of whether ‘attachment’ is operative or not. The difference between the other-dependent and consummated natures is likewise subtle. when the other-dependent nature ceases to be the cause for the delusory imagination to appear, it is identified with the consummated nature, the difference being whether such a cause is operative or not. The three natures, then, are neither different from each other nor identical to each other; or, rather, they are both different and identical at one and the same time.” See Nagao 1991, 69–72; Boquist 1993, 126–8; Garfield 2002, 128–51; and Tola and Dragonetti 2004, 226–7. This example is also used in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras, Chapter 12, verse 15; see Jamspal et al. 2004, 122. 549 This section is drawn from the Compendium of the Mahāyāna, Chapter 3, and Vasu-bandhu’s Commentary on the “Compendium of the Mahāyāna” (Mahāyāna-saṃgraha-bhāṣhya, Theg bsdus ’grel pa bshad pa).

Traditional accounts state that he was Vasubandhu’s older half-brother, and that after many years of retreat he received teachings directly from the future buddha Maitreya, which include the Five Treatises of Maitreya. Additionally he is credited with having composed a number of other major treatises, such as the Compendium of Abhidharma, Compendium of the Mahāyāna, and the Treatises on the Bhūmis (see n. 458). For bibliographic details, see willis 2002, 4–12. 560 Vasubandhu (dByig gnyen) (late fourth century to early fifth century) was an Indian master born in Gandhāra. Traditional accounts state that he was Asaṅga’s half-brother, and that he first studied the abhidharma in Gandhāra and later in Kash-mir, after which he wrote the Treasury of Abhidharma and its auto-commentary, Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma.” Following this he is said to have been “converted” to the Mahāyāna teachings by Asaṅga and to have written a num-ber of famous treatises considered part of the Yogāchāra tradition, some of which are included in the collection known as the Eight Prakaraṇa Treatises: (1) Expla-nation of the “Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras” (Sūtrālaṁkārāvyākhyā, mDo sde rgyan gyi bshad pa); (2) Commentary on the “Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes” (Madhyāntavibhaṅgaṭīkā, dBus dang mtha’ rnam par ’byed pa’i ’grel pa; (3) Commentary on the “Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature” (Dharmadharmatā-vi bhaṅgavṛitti, Chos dang chos nyid rnam par ’byed pa’i ’grel pa); (4) Principles of Explanation (Vyākhyayukti, rNam par bshad pa’i rig pa); (5) Delineation of Achiev-ing Actions (Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa, Las grub pa’i rab tu ’byed pa); (6) Delineation of the Five Aggregates (Pañchaskandhaprakaraṇa, Phung po lnga’i rab tu ’byed pa); (7) Twenty Verses (Viṃshakākārikā, Nyi shu pa’i tshig le’ur byas pa); and (8) Thirty Verses (Triṃshikākārikā, Sum cu pa’i tshig le’ur byas pa). See Anacker 1984/1998 for a detailed biography of Vasubandhu and translations of five of these eight texts.

See Kritzer 2003b and 2005. 561 For other perspectives on whose views are represented by the Chittamātra system, see The Masters Who Assert Those [Chittamātra Positions], p. 191. 562 Dreyfus (1997, 433) makes the following remarks about Proponents of Real Images (or True Aspectarians) (Satyākāravādin, rNam bden pa), and Proponents of False Images (or False Aspectarians) (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa):Concerning the notion of aspect, Dharmakīrti’s Indian and Tibetan follow-ers can be divided into two categories: those who hold that aspects are real entities, the True Aspectarians (satyākāravādin, rnam bden pa), and those who deny it, the False Aspectarians (alīkārāvādin, rnam par rdzun par smra ba). The former view is compatible with a so-called Sautrāntika view that perception provides undistorted access to the external world. Since external objects exist, the cognition that validates them, perception, must be undistorted. And so must the aspects that provide the basis for the conceptual interpretation of reality brought about by perception. Consequently, the adoption of a Sautrāntika view commits one to a True Aspectarian view of perception. The converse, however, is not true. The adoption of a True Aspectarian view does not commit one to the Sautrāntika acceptance of the reality of external objects. Thinkers who deny the reality of the external world hold that perception is mistaken, since objects appear to us as existing independent of their percep-tion. These thinkers differ, however, on the degree of distortion. Among these thinkers the True Aspectarians, who take a Mind-Only view, hold that perception is mistaken with respect to the externality of its objects. According to their view, this distortion does not affect the nature of perception itself. The objective aspect held by a mental state is substantially identical with consciousness and hence real. The False Aspectarians reject this distinction and hold that the representa-tion of objects in consciousness is itself a deluded construct. For them, aspects do not really exist, but are superimposed on the luminous nature of consciousness. Such a nature is ineffable, utterly beyond the duality of subject and object. Thus this view is described by Śākya Chok-den as Yogācāra but not as Mind-Only. See Dreyfus 1997, 433–6. Tillemans comments (1990, 41–2 and 42n92): Satyākāravādins [Proponents of Real Images] (viz. Dignāga and Dharmakīrti) who, as their name implies, maintained the reality of these images, held that the raw sense-data which present themselves to perception, such as impres-sions of blue, etc., are real and possess dependent natures (paratantrasvabhāva) in that they are inseparable from consciousness, which is itself real. These ākāra [images] are then misinterpreted as external entities by conceptual-ization and thus subsequently, through the influence of a cognition different from simple perception, they acquire false or “thoroughly imagined natures” (parikalpitasvabhāva). The opposite Vijñānavāda position is that of the Alīkākāravādins [Proponents of False Images] who profess that the given data, or ākāra, while conventionally existent, are themselves deceptive in that they are falsely of two sorts, subjec-tive (i.e. grāhakākāra) and objective (grāhyākāra). Only the pure non-dual con-sci ousness is real . . . To take Bodhibhadra’s explanation, the Alīkākāravādin maintains that the ākāra [images] themselves are not paratantra [dependent] but parikalpitasvabhāva [the imagined nature]: the raw given which one sees is itself unreal; it is only the self-awareness, or svadaṃvedana, which is fully real.

Both Proponents of Real Images and Proponents of False Images assert that what appears is not other than mind, but they differ as to whether those appearances are mind (i.e., are an intrinsic part of mind) or not (altg). See Āchārya Sherab Gyaltsen 2003, Chapter 7. See also n. 562 above. 565 The doxographical categories of Proponents of Real Images (Sa tyākāravādin, rNam bden pa) and Proponents of False Images (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa) are found in later Indian Buddhist works, where, in the context of Yogāchāra, the term “Proponents of Images” (Sākāravādin, rNam pa dang bcas pa) is sometimes used for Proponents of Real Images, and “Proponents of Nonexistent Images” (Nirākāravādin, rNam pa med pa) for Proponents of False Images (Jamgön Kong-trul states the latter on p. 189). Note that in a pan-Buddhist context “Propo-nents of Images” is used for both Sautrāntika and Yogāchāra Proponents of Real Images, and “Proponents of Nonexistent Images” are either Vaibhāṣhikas, because they do not posit “images” (in which case the term is better translated as"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"35\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeProponents of No Images), or Yogāchāra Proponents of False Images, because they do not accept that images are real. (Also note that the categories of Proponents of Images and Proponents of No Images are used in non-Buddhist Indian philosophi-cal circles.) Bodhibhadra in his Commentary on the “Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wisdom” (Jñānasārasamuchchaya-nāma-nibandhana, Ye shes snying po kun las btus pa zhes bya ba’i bshad sbyar) (Dg.T. Beijing 57:895) states: There are two types of Yogāchāras: Proponents of Images and Proponents of Nonexistent Images. The master Dignāga and others assert the positions of Proponents of Images. They teach that the image is the dependent (paratantra, gzhan dbang), as is said [in Dignāga’s Examination of Objects of Observation (Ālambanaparīkṣhā, dMigs pa brtags pa), verse 6ac]: “The entity of the inner knowable object, which appears as if it were external, is the referent.” They discuss [only] six modes of consciousness. Pro ponents of Nonexistent Images include the master Asaṅga and others. They state that images are the imagined (parikalpita, kun brtags) [and] are like the floaters seen by the visually impaired, since it is said [in the Compendium of the Mahāyāna, Chapter 8]: “If referents were to exist as referents, there could be no nonconceptual wisdom. If that [wisdom] does not exist, the attainment of buddhahood is not feasible.” And [in the same text]: “Where nonconceptual wisdom occurs, no object appears. One must comprehend that there are no referents.

Readers should be aware that the views on classifying the thought of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti are very varied and complicated, ranging from the above to that they were Mādhyamikas. For a discussion of different doxographical categorizations of Dharmakīrti’s thought, see Dreyfus 1997, 20–21 and 428–42. Mokṣhākaragupta in his Discourse on Logic (Tarkabhāṣhā, rTog ge’i skad) also divides Yogāchāras into Proponents of Images and Proponents of Nonexistent Images. See Kajiyama 1965 and 1998, 148 and 154–8. Maitrīpa in his Precious Garland of Suchness (Tattvaratnāvalī, De kho na nyid kyi rin chen phreng ba) (Dg.T. Beijing 26:340–2) divides Yogāchāras into Proponents of Images and Proponents of Nonexistent Images. Tillemans says (1990, 41n91), “Note that amongst later Vijñānavādins, Ratnā-karaśānti becomes the principal representative of Alīkākāravāda [Proponents of"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"endnotes c 359False Images], whereas Jñānaśrīmitra is probably the principal Satyākāravādin [Pro-ponent of Real Images].” (Ratnākarashānti refers in the colophon to his Instructions that Ornament the Middle Way (Madhyamakālaṃkāropadesha, dBu ma rgyan gyi man ngag) to his teachings as being that of the “Mahāyāna Mādhyamika [Proponents of] Cognition” (Mahāyāna vijñapti madhyamaka, Theg chen rnam rig dbu ma). Although it seems clear from a number of his works that Ratnākarashānti was a Proponent of False Images, he may not have considered himself a Chittamātra as distinct from a Mādhyamika. Nevertheless most of his writings are included in the Chittamātra (sems tsam) section of the Tengyur. See Ruegg 1981, 122–4.) According to Ruegg (1981, 110), Dharmapāla and his students Ratnakīrti and Jñānashrīmitra were Proponents of Real Images. Dreyfus says (1997, 364) that Dharmottara was a Proponent of False Images. See also n. 562 above for remarks concerning the views of Proponents of Real Images and Proponents of False Images. 566 In his Ornament of the Middle Way (Mādhyamakālaṃkāra, dBu ma rgyan), Shāntarakṣhita presents Yogāchāra views (verses 44 and 52) and then refutes them (verses 45–51 and 53–60). Although he does not identify proponents of these views either in his root text or in his auto-commentary (nor does Kamalashīla in his Commentary on the Difficult Points of the “Ornament of the Middle Way”), later commentators identify the three Real Image subschools (Split-Eggists, Proponents of Perceptual Parity, and Non-Pluralists) and the Proponents of False Images as the ones refuted by these verses. Thus Shāntarakṣhita’s text and its commentaries are sources for understanding these positions. See Blumenthal 2004, 120–34 and 268–74; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 236–61. 567 Split-Eggists (sGo nga phyed tshal pa) (more literally, “Egg-Split-in-Half-ists”) is also translated as “Half-Eggists.” The Geluk commentator Ngawang Palden says (Hop-kins 2003, 420) that Brahmin Shaṃkarānanda (bram ze bDe byed dga’ ba) is a propo-nent of this system. See Shāntarakṣhita’s Ornament of the Middle Way, verses 46–47; Blumenthal 2004, 120–4; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 240–2. 568 The Explanation of “Differentiating the Sugata’s Texts” (Sugatamatavibhaṅgabhāṣhya, bDe bar gshegs pa’i gzhung rnam par ’byed pa’i bshad pa) (Toh. 3900; Dg.T. Beijing 63:995–6) is by Jetāri (or Jitāri) (dGra las rgyal ba) (ca. eleventh century). His root text, Differentiating the Sugata’s Texts (Sugatamatavibhaṅgakārikā, bDe bar gshegs pa’i gzhung rnam par ’byed pa’i tshig le’ur byas pa) (Toh. 3899), contains only eight verses, all of which are almost identical to verses 21–28 of Āryadeva’s Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wisdom (Jñānasārasamuchchaya, Ye shes snying po kun las btus pa). See Mimaki 2000, 234–5. Ruegg states (1981, 100) that Jetāri “was counted by doxographers as a Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka (Samala-Alīkākāra branch [Proponents of Staining False Images]). His Sugatamatavibhaṅga-kārikās and Bhāṣya deal with the four main schools of Buddhist thought . . . In the Bhāṣya Jitāri endeavours in particular to demonstrate that Dharmakīrti was in agreement with Nāgārjuna and that he taught the Madhyamaka.” The translation follows Dg.T.

Conceptuality, which arises through the force of those two, exaggeratedly considers them to be the two entities of percept and perceiver.” 569 Proponents of Perceptual Parity (or Proponents of Equal Numbers of Percepts and Perceivers) (gZung ’dzin grangs mnyam pa). Ngawang Palden says (Hopkins 2003, 420) that Shākyabuddhi [in his commentary on Dharmakīrti’s Commentary on (Dignāga’s) “Compilation of Prime Cognition”] is a proponent of this system. See Shāntarakṣhita’s Ornament of the Middle Way, verse 49; Blumenthal 2004, 124–5; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 243–5. Mipham states that perceptual parity is the view favored by Shāntarakṣhita on a conventional level, though not as these Chittamātras express it. See n. 572. 570 TOK, II:505.19: snang tshogs should be sna tshogs. (TN) 571 dBu ma rang ’grel, that is, Madhyamakālaṃkāra-vṛitti, dBu ma’i rgyan gyi ’grel pa, by Shāntarakṣhita. Toh. 3885; Dg.T.

TOK, II:506.1: rigs mi mthun pa’i shes pa du ma cig car ’byung ba bzhin du ’byung ngo zhes smra. Compare with Dg.T. Beijing: rigs mi mthun pa’i shes pa bzhin du ’byung ngo zhes smra, “They arise in the same way that dissimilar-type cognitions do.” 572 As said above (n. 569), Mipham states that Shāntarakṣhita holds the view of percep-tual parity on a conventional level or as an imputation, but not in the way these Chittamātras do. (Although Shāntarakṣhita does not identify them and Kamalashīla calls them “some Yogāchāras,” later commentators call them Proponents of Per-ceptual Parity). Thus in this statement Shāntarakṣhita presents their position and its weakness, which he says is that they assert that multiple consciousnesses of the same type (for example, cognitions of the color blue) can occur simultaneously. Shāntarakṣhita points out that this contradicts the Buddha’s statements that it is impossible for two minds to occur simultaneously and that every being has only one mindstream. Mipham comments, “In our system, cognitions arise in numbers corresponding to the [cognized] images, but these are not [cognitions of] similar types. Thus it is not a case of many [cognitions of] similar types arising simultane-ously” (rang lugs la rnam pa’i grangs bzhin shes pa du ma skye yang rigs mthun du mi ’gyur bas rigs mthun du ma lhan cig mi skye ba’i tshul) (Tibetan in Doctor 2004, 368; my translation). For Mipham’s full analysis of this topic based on Shāntarakṣhita’s Auto-Commentary for the “Ornament of the Middle Way,” see Mipham in Doctor 2004, 258–67 and 368–71; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 197–201 and 243–5. 573 Non-Pluralists (or Proponents of Varieties without [Cognitive] Plurality) (sNa tshogs gnyis med). “Varieties” are the diverse appearances that manifest, and “without plurality” means that the perceiving consciousness is singular (altg). Ngawang Palden states (Hopkins 2003, 420) that Dharmakīrti is a proponent of this system; however, Dreyfus points out (1997, 434) that even in the Geluk tradi-tion there are different views on this matter: “Kay-drup asserts that Dharmakīrti is a T rue Aspectarian . . . Gyel-tsap . . . claims that Dharmakīrti is a False Aspectar-ian.” See Shāntarakṣhita’s Ornament of the Middle Way, verses 50–51; Mipham in Doctor 2004, 372–4; Blumenthal 2004, 125–7; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 245–6."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"endnotes c 361 574 See Dg.T. Beijing 62:931. 575 Mipham restates Shāntarakṣhita’s remark as: “They state that the entities of the varieties [of appearances] are apprehended by just a single consciousness, in the same way that [a single consciousness apprehends the various colors of] an onyx” (gang dag nor bu gzi bzhin tu rnam par shes pa gcig kho nas sna tshogs gyi ngo bo bzung ngo zhes).

See Mipham in Doctor 2004, 374; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 246. 576 This general statement of the assertion of the Proponents of False Images specifi-cally expresses the view of the Proponents of Non-Staining False Images, not the Proponents of Staining False Images, possibly because most scholars say that the view of the Proponents of Staining False Images is not really in keeping with the positions of Proponents of False Images (altg). In support of this, see Chang-kya Rolpé Dorjé in Hopkins 2003, 425. 577 “Proponents of False Images” (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa) is also translated as “False Aspectarians.” As stated above (n. 565), Ratnākarashānti and Dharmottara are considered to be Proponents of False Images. See also n. 562; and Ratnākarashānti in Kajiyama 1998, 148 and 154–8. In his Ornament of the Middle Way, Shāntarakṣhita presents the positions of Propo-nents of False Images in verse 52 and refutes them in verses 53–60; see Blumenthal 2004, 127–34; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 247–61. In his commentary on the Ornament of the Middle Way, Mipham says, “The authen-tic Chittamātras are the Proponents of Real Images, and thus they [may be consid-ered to] have a sound approach. [Nevertheless,] since Proponents of False Images assert that outer referents are not real as mind, they are slightly closer [to under-standing that things are] empty of reality, and thus they provide, as it were, a link to Madhyamaka. For that reason they are ranked higher [than Proponents of Real Images]. However, since their [position] is quite illogical on a conventional level, the conventional level of things should be asserted only according to [the positions of] Proponents of Real Images” (de ltar na sems tsam mtshan nyid pa ni rnam bden pa yin pas rnam bden pa ’di gzhung brling zhing/ rnam brdzun pa phyi don sems su’ang mi bden par ’dod pas bden stong la cung nye bas dbu ma dang/ mtshams sbyor lta bu yin pas go rim gyis ’di gong mar bzhag kyang/ tha snyad la mi ’thad pa chen po ’ong bas tha snyad rnam bden pa kho na ltar khas blang bar bya ba yin ni). See Mipham in Doctor 2004, 380–2; and Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 249–50. Dreyfus notes that Shākya Chokden considers Proponents of False Images to be Yogāchāras, not Chittamātras, and that Gorampa considers Proponents of False Images to hold the best view of Chittamātras. See Dreyfus 1997, 433 and 557n14. 578 This statement is almost identical to one Jamyang Shepa makes in his Great Exposi-tion of Tenets (Grub mtha’ chen mo) (579.2–3), which suggests that there is a common source for this statement (which I have not been able to locate): dri bcas ni rnam shes di rnams sim gdung sogs kyi ’dzin rnam du don dam par gnas kyang/ ma rig pa’i mthus phyi rol gyi gzung ba’i rnam par snang bas rnam shes rang gi ngo bo rdzun pa’am ’khrul pa des gos par smra bas dri bcas su ’dod de, “Some say that although consciousnesses are, ultimately, the perceiving aspect of pleasure, pain, and so forth, the force of ignorance causes them to appear as outer perceived images, and thus the entity of consciousness is tainted by falsity or confusion.

See Great Exposi-tion of Tenets, 579.1; and Hopkins 2003, 424–5. 580 According to Jamyang Shepa (Great Exposition of Tenets, 577–9), it is “reputed” in Tibet that the divisions into Proponents of Staining False Images and Proponents of Non-Staining False Images rest on their assertions regarding whether buddhas experience the stains of dualistic appearances or not; however the scholar-siddhas of India explain that these divisions are based upon whether they assert that the entity of mind is tainted by dualistic appearances or not. Jamyang Shepa says he regards the Tibetan explanation as incorrect since the second presentation accords with texts such as Dignāga’s Compendium on Valid Cognition (Pramāṇasamuchchaya, Tshad ma kun btus) and Dharmakīrti’s Commentary on Valid Cognition. See Hopkins 2003, 424. Compare this with Kajiyama 1998, 154–5: According to Ratnākaraśānti . . . all the Yogācārins must be sākārvādins [Pro-ponents of Images] so far as the cognition of common people is concerned. A problem, however, appears in regard to an emancipated person, who is sup-posed to have acquired nirvikalpakajñāna or non-conceptual, supermundane knowledge. Some Yogācārins thought that knowledge of an emancipated person is free from the fetter of cognitum and cognizer and accordingly is clear like a pure crystal without specks. And they thought this clear, image-less knowledge is the essence of cognition, regarding images as false, unreal specks born from our vāsanā [habitual tendencies]. This is the essential of the nirākārajñānavāda [that is, of stating that there is cognition without images] held by some of the Yogācārins. But others from the same school criticized this theory saying that what is not real can be never manifested, since otherwise a sort of the unfavourable doctrine of asatkhyāti [what is nonexistent appearing] would follow. Every cognition, so long as it is knowledge, must have an image, and there is no harm in that an emancipated person’s knowledge is with an image, if he is freed from conceptual thinking. This is the essential point of the sākārajñānavāda [Proponents of Images]. 581 I am unable to verify whether Lakṣhmī is the Kashmiri scholar Lakṣhmī[kara] referred to on p. 200. 582 Karma Tinlé Choklé Namgyal (Karma phrin las phyogs las rnam rgyal) (1456–1539) was a student of the seventh Karmapa, Chödrak Gyamtso (Chos grags rgya mtsho) (1454–1506), and teacher of the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorjé (Mi bskyod rdo rje) (1507–1554).

Although not a direct student of Dignāga (traditionally Dharmakīrti is said to have been a student of Ishvarasena, Dignāga’s student), Dharmakīrti is considered Dignāga’s son in that he was the one to clarify and elaborate Dignāga’s teachings and is considered to have been the master of them. His works include the Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition (tshad ma sde bdun): (1) Analysis of Relations (Sambhandhaparīkṣhā, ’Brel pa brtag pa); (2) Ascertainment of Valid Cognition (Pramāṇavinishchaya, Tshad ma rnam par nges pa); (3) Commentary on Valid Cognition (Pramāṇavārttikakārikā, Tshad ma rnam ’grel gyi tshig le’ur byas pa); (4) Drop of Reasoning (Nyāyabinduprakaraṇa, Rigs pa’i thigs pa zhes bya ba’i rab tu byed pa); (5) Drop of Reasons (Hetubindunāmaprakaraṇa, gTan tshigs kyi thigs pa zhes bya ba rab tu byed pa); (6) Principles of Debate (Vādanyāya, rTsod pa’i rigs pa); and (7) Proof of Other Continua (Saṃtānāntarasiddhināmaprakaraṇa, rGyud gzhan grub pa zhes bya ba’i rab tu byed pa).

The works traditionally attributed to him are classified in three groups: Collection of Reasonings (Rigs tshogs), Collection of Praises (bsTod tshogs), and Collection of Advice (gTam tshogs). It would be the texts found in the Collection of Praises that some would consider as reflecting the views of both the Proponents of Real Images and the Proponents of False Images. For a list of some of the texts included in the Collection of Praises see n. 856. For a list of the texts in the Collection of Reasonings see n. 592. For more information on Nāgārjuna’s life and works, see Walser 2005, particularly 60–79; Mabbett 1998; and Ruegg 1981, 4–9. 589 Vasubandhu wrote the Treasury of Abhidharma as an explication of the Kashmiri-Vaibhāṣhika abhidharma system (as stated in Chapter 8, verse 40), but he did not always agree with their positions, which he demonstrated in his auto-commentary, The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma.” Thus he serves as an illustration of the fact that teachers sometimes compose texts on philosophical systems that do not reflect their own positions. 590 The great omniscient dharma lord of Jonang (Jo nang chos rje kun mkhyen chen po) is one of many ways that Jamgön Kongtrul refers to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan) (1292–1361).

In his History of Buddhism in India, Tāranātha makes a similar statement (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970, 98–100): “There were about five hundred preachers of the Doctrine like mahābhaṭṭāraka Avitarka, Vigatarāgadvaja, Divyākaragupta, Rāhulamitra, Jñānatala, mahā-upāsaka Saṇgatala and others . . . All [those] Mahāyānī-s [sic] were followers of the path of yogacaryā [that is, they were Yogāchāra-Chittamātras (rnal ’byor spyod pa sems tsam pa)].” Tāranātha also states (ibid., 102) that Rāhulabhadra (who, as Nāgārjuna’s teacher, is considered first to second century ce) studied with Avitarka, so we may conclude that these Yogāchāra teachers lived during the first century ce. See also Book Four, Part One (TOK, I:401–3). For some other thoughts on this matter, see Kapstein 2000a, 118. 594 For a comprehensive overview of which masters have been considered Chittamātra or Yogāchāra and who was criticized by the Mādhyamikas, see Brunnhölzl 2004, 491–5. 595 For Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas, the truly existing substratum (gzhi rten bden grub) is the irreducible partless particles and instants of consciousness; for Chittamātras, it is reflexively aware, self-illuminating cognition, empty of the duality of percept and perceiver. 596 Realists (or Proponents of [Truly] Existing Entities; “Substantialists”) (Vastusat- padārthavādin, dNgos por smra ba or dNgos po yod par smra ba): In Buddhist philoso-phy, the term “Realists” is used for those who assert the true existence of entities (what the entities are differs according to the school). It should be understood that these schools, of course, do not use the term for themselves: Chittamātras do not consider themselves Realists.

However, the term madhyamaka can also mean “not even a middle.” There is a difference between a “middle path” and a path that is “not even a middle” . . . within this tradition, we typically refer to the four extremes, [which can be summarized] into the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism. If we totally refute both of these extremes through the intellectual path of reasoning and reflecting, then how can we say, “This is the middle”? For example, if we were to knock down all four walls of a room and entirely take away the ground, then we would not be able to point to a spot as the middle of the room since there would no longer be a room. The concept of “the middle” is dependent on the existence of sides. Thus, we cannot continue to cling to a “middle path” because Nāgārjuna’s philosophy precludes clinging to any side or extreme. There is no middle whatsoever at this point. Accordingly, there is no reference point at all. Brunnhölzl remarks (2004, 32):In the west, Madhyamaka is usually translated as “middle way,” but the word “way” does not have any correlate in either the Sanskrit term nor its Tibetan equivalent uma. Madhya means “middle or center,” -ma is an emphasizing affix, and -ka refers to anything that deals with or expresses this middle, be it texts, philosophical systems, or persons. (The latter are mostly called “Mādhyamika,” though.) Thus, Madhyamaka means “that which deals with (or proclaims) the very middle/center.” The corresponding Tibetan term Uma usually also refers to “the very middle.” Some masters, such as the Eighth Karmapa Mikyö Dorje, interpret the syllable ma as a negative and thus take the whole term to mean that there is not (ma) even a middle (u) between the extremes. As for the use of the term to denote a philosophical school, according to Huntington (2003, 74), “So far as we know at present Bhāvaviveka is responsible for first appro-priating the word madhyamaka as the name of a philosophical system or school that advocated specific tenets.”"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"366 C the treasury of knowledge 605 Ratnakūṭa, dKon mchog brtsegs pa.

The master Bhāvaviveka and others are Sautrāntika-Mādhyamikas. Jñānagarbha, Shrīgupta, Shāntarakṣhita, Kamalashīla, Haribhadra, and others are Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas (sangs rgyas bskyang dang zla grags dbu ma thal ’gyur ’jig rten grags sde spyod pa’i dbu ma/ slob dpon bha bya la sogs mdo sde spyod pa’i dbu ma/ yes shes snying po/ dpal sbas/ zhi ba ’tsho/ padma’i ngang tshul/ seng ge bzang po la sogs pa rnal ’byor spyod pa’i dbu ma).

According to Mimaki (1983, 161–2), the fourteenth-century Kadampa master Upa Lo-sel (dBus pa blo gsal) also employed this threefold classification with the following two differences from Butön: Upa Lo-sel does not refer to Mādhyamikas"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"endnotes c 367Who Employ Worldly Consensus as Prāsaṅgikas, and he lists Jñānagarbha as a Mādhyamika Who Employs Worldly Consensus. (Upa Lo-sel also gives the twofold classification of Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika.) Yeshé Dé (Ye shes sde), who lived in the early ninth century, is credited with writing the first Tibetan doxography, Distinctions of the View (lTa ba’i khyad pa), in which he refers to Sautrāntika-Madhyamaka and Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka, with Bhāvaviveka and Shāntarakṣhita being the representatives of those respectively. 613 *Sautrāntika-Mādhyamikas (mDo sde spyod pa’i dbu ma), *Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas (rNal ’byor spyod pa’i dbu ma), and Mādhyamikas Who Employ Worldly Consensus (Lokaprasiddhi, ’Jig rten grags sde spyod pa’i dbu ma pa) are distinguished on the basis of how they present conventional reality. It became normative in Tibet after the time of Tsongkhapa to treat Sautrāntika-Madhyamaka and Yogāchāra-Madhya-maka as divisions of Svātantrika-Madhyamaka (see Chapter 9 in general, and spe-cifically n. 705), and to consider Mādhyamikas Who Employ Worldly Consensus as Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka, which is discussed most specifically in Chapter 10 under the heading A Brief Account of Chandrakīrti’s Exegetical System, pp. 224–230. 614 I use the form “Bhāvaviveka” for both the Tibetan Legs ldan ’byed and Bhavya (Bha bya) because it is the most commonly used one in North American scholarship. However, as Eckel says (2003, 196n10), “There has been a great deal of discussion about the proper form of this important philosopher’s name. ‘Bhāvaviveka’ has come down to us from La Vallée Poussin’s edition of Candrakīrti’s PPMV [Mūla-madhyamakavṛittiprasannapadā]. There also is good evidence, however, for the forms Bhavya and Bhāviveka. A useful summary of the complex and contradictory evidence for the name of Bhāvaviveka or Bhavya can be found in Lindtner (1995): 37–65. Recent manuscript discoveries suggest that the proper form of the name is almost certainly Bhāviveka. See Yonezawa (2001a): 26 [in Facsimile Edition of a Collection of Sanskrit Palm-Leaf Manuscripts in Tibetan dBu med Script. Tokyo: The Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism, Taishō University].” See also Ruegg 1990, 69n1; and below, nn. 628 and 694. 615 Shāntarakṣhita (Zhi ba ’tsho) (eighth century) was the Bengali master invited to Tibet by King Trisong De-tsen (Khri srong sde btsan) in 763. He was the first major teacher of philosophy in Tibet and wrote the Ornament of the Middle Way, Commen-tary on the “Ornament of the Middle Way,” Compendium on Suchness (Tattvasaṃgraha, De kho na nyid bsdus pa), and other works. See Padmakara Translation Group 2005, especially 2–5; and Blumenthal 2004, 25–30. 616 Chandrakīrti (Zla ba grags pa) (sixth to seventh century) is credited in Tibet with delineating the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka system (dbu ma thal ’gyur), which he did by clarifying the thought of Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, dBu ma rtsa ba shes rab) in two well-known commentaries, Lucid Words (Mūlamadhyamakavṛittiprasannapadā, dBu ma’i rtsa ba’i ’grel pa tshig gsal ba) and Entrance to the Middle Way (Madhyamakāvatāra, dBu ma la ’jug pa). Put very simply, in these texts he upheld the use of consequences (prasaṅga, thal ’gyur) by Buddhapālita and refuted the use of independently [verifiable] reasonings (svatan-tra, rang rgyud pa’i gtan tshig) as put forth by Bhāvaviveka.

Some, such as Tak-tsang Lotsāwa (sTag tshang lo tsā ba), equate the first with Svātantrikas and the latter with Prāsaṅgikas (see Phuntsho 2005, 239n38). Others, such as Ngok Loden Sherab (rNgog blo ldan shes rab) and Do-drup Dam-chö (rDo grub dam chos), reject the classification altogether (see Iaroslav 2000, 50; Phuntsho 2005, 238n38; and Ruegg 2000, 33n60). Tsongkhapa concurs with Ngok Loden Sherab on the unsuitability of these divisions in relation to ultimate reality, calling them “not a good approach.” For Tsongkhapa’s explanation, see The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Cutler and Newman 2002, 115–6. (There is, however, controversy concerning the exact meaning of Tsongkhapa’s statement; see Hopkins 2003, 800na.) For Ke-drup Jé’s views, see Cabezón 1992, 89—90. Longchen Rabjam in his Precious Treasury of the Supreme Yāna (Theg pa’i mchog rin po che’i mdzod) applies both subcategories to Svātantrikas. He states that “Those who Logically Establish Illusion” (sgyu ma rigs grub tu ’dod pa) is one of many names used for the lower Svātantrika (rang rgyud ’og ma), and “[Proponents of] Complete Nonabiding” is one of many names used for the higher Svātantrika (rang rgyud gong ma). For Shākya Chokden’s comments on these divisions, see Iaroslav 2000, 84n197. It seems that in Tibet the terms used here, “Those who Logically Establish Illu-sion” and “Proponents of Complete Nonabiding,” are used interchangeably with “Proponents of Illusionlike Nonduality” (Māyopamādvayavādin, sGyu ma ltar gnyis med du smra ba) and “Proponents of the Complete Nonabiding of All Phenomena” (Sarvadharmāpratiṣhṭhānavādin, Chos thams cad rab tu mi gnas par smra ba), which Jamgön Kongtrul lists separately. See Cabezón 2003, 307n2. 618 Kamalashīla (Padma’i nang tshul) (740–795) was a student of Shāntarakṣhita. He was invited to Tibet during the reign of King Trisong De-tsen, where he is famous for successfully debating with Heshang Moheyan (Hā shang Mahāyāna) at Samyé mon-astery, which established the gradual approach of Indian Buddhism as predominant in Tibet. Among his many works are the three-part text on meditation called the Stages of Meditation of the Middle Way (Bhāvanākrama, dBu ma’i sgom rim gsum) and commentaries on Shāntarakṣhita’s works, such as Commentary on the Difficult Points of the “Ornament of the Middle Way” (Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā, dBu ma rgyan gyi dka’ ’grel). 619 Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche explains that illusion (sgyu ma) refers to the union of appearances and emptiness. These masters use reasonings to establish that the ultimate truth is the unity, or combination (tshogs pa), of phenomena and their absence of existence, their emptiness. 620 Buddhapālita (Sangs rgyas bkyangs) (early sixth century) was a student of Saṅgharakṣhita, with whom he studied Nāgārjuna’s works. He is most well-known for his commentary on Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way, called Buddhapālita’s Commentary on the “Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way” (Buddhapālita-mūlamadhyamakavṛitti, dBu ma rtsa ba’i ’grel pa Buddhapālita), which is preserved only in Tibetan translation. Chandrakīrti’s defense of Buddhapālita’s work against Bhāvaviveka’s criticism led to the later distinctions and classifications of Svātantrika-Madhyamaka and Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka. See Chapter 9, p. 218; Ruegg 1981, 60–1; and Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970,186–8. 621 Ratnākarashānti (Rin chen ’byung gnas zhi ba) (early eleventh century) was a great Mahāyāna master who resided as the eastern gate-keeper at Vikramashīla. Over"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"endnotes c 369thirty of his works on tantras, prajñāpāramitā, philosophy, and epistemology (pramāṇa, tshad ma) are included in the Tengyur. He was also one of the eighty-four mahāsiddhas, in which context he is referred to simply as Shāntipa (see J. Robinson 1979, 60–4). Ratnākarashānti was a contemporary of Jñānashrīmitra and Ratnakīrti, and one of Atīsha’s teachers, and, according to Tāranātha’s History of Buddhism in India, a student of Nāropa. See Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970, 295 and 299–300. 622 According to Ruegg (1981, 123), Ratnākarashānti divides Mādhyamikas into those who state that conventional [reality] is an image of cognition (kun rdzob shes pa’i rnam par smra ba) and those who state that conventional [reality] is habitual ten-dencies (kun rdzob bag chags su smra ba) in his Presentation of the Three Vehicles (Triyānavyavasthāna, Theg pa gsum gyi rnam bzhag) (Toh. 3712; P4535, f. 114a). 623 Maitrīpa (also known as Avadhūta Advayavajra, gNyis med rdo rje) discusses these classifications in his Precious Garland of Suchness (Toh. 2240; Dg.T. Beijing 26:336). Maitrīpa (1007-1085) studied with Nāropa, Ratnākarashānti, and Jñānashrīmitra before seeking out the siddha Shavari (or Shabara), from whom he heard mahāmudrā teachings. Maitrīpa was one of Marpa Lotsāwa’s two principal teachers, and one of Kyungpo Naljor’s (Khyung po rnal ’byor) teachers (see Nālandā Translation Commit-tee 1982, 26–32 and 58; and Zangpo 2003, 50–6 and 241–4). His teachings and set of twenty-five texts known as Teachings on the Absence of Mental Fabrications (Amanasikāroddesha, Yid la mi byed pa ston pa) (Toh. 2229–52) are the source of the sūtra mahāmudrā teachings taught by Gampopa and passed down through the Kagyu lineage. See Tatz 1987. Maitrīpa also recovered two of Maitreya’s texts, High-est Continuum and Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature; see Roerich 1949, 347; and n. 811 below. 624 According to Ruegg (2000, 34–5) and Brunnhölzl (2004, 335), this twofold division of Proponents of Illusionlike Nonduality (Māyopamādvayavādin, sGyu ma ltar gnyis med du smra ba) and Proponents of the Complete Nonabiding of All Phenomena (Sarvadharmāpratiṣhṭhānavādin, Chos thams cad rab tu mi gnas par smra ba) is also found in Chandrahari’s Jewel Garland (Ratnamālā, Rin po che’i phreng ba), “alluded to” in Ashvagoṣha’s Stages of Meditation on the Ultimate Mind of Enlightenment (Paramārtha-bodhichittabhāvanākrama, Don dam byang sems sgom pa’i rim pa), and listed in the Kagyu master Gampopa’s Beauty of Community Dharma (Tshogs chos legs mdzes ma). For Padma Karpo’s explanation of these categories, see Brunnhölzl 2004, 337. For an overview of these categories as used by Tibetan masters in the eleventh through thirteenth centuries, see Tauscher 2003, 209–11. See also n. 617. 625 Lakṣhmīkara uses these terms in Illuminating the Meaning of “The Five Stages” (Pañchakrama-vṛittārthavirochana, Rim pa lnga’i don gsal bar byed pa). Toh. 1842; Dg.T. Beijing 19. 626 Mother of the Victors (rgyal ba’i yum) is a name for the Prajñāpāramitā scriptures based on the reference to Prajñāpāramitā (the perfection of wisdom) as the mother of all buddhas. 627 Mādhyamika Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāvavādin, Ngo bo nyid med par smra ba’i dbu ma [pa]).

Beijing 57:1539). The"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"370 C the treasury of knowledgeTibetan tradition attributes the authorship of this text to the famous sixth-century Bhāvaviveka, rather than an eighth-century master of the same name.

See also Chapter 7, n. 614. 629 The terms “broad” (rags pa) and “subtle” (phra ba) may be interpreted not as com-ments on the merits of the individual systems but as descriptions of how easy or difficult it is to understand these systems (altg). Here Jamgön Kongtrul uses these descriptive categories to refer to Rangtong and Shentong. In Chapter 9, p. 219, he uses them to refer to the two subdivisions of Svātantrika-Madhyamaka, the so-called Sautrāntika-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas and Yogāchāra-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas, calling the first “the broad, outer Mādhyamikas,” and the latter “the subtle, inner Mādhyamikas.” 630 Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan) (1292–1361), is con-sidered to be the first to widely employ the terms Rangtong (Intrinsic Emptiness, Empty-of-Self, or Self-Empty) (Rang stong) and Shentong (Extrinsic Emptiness, Empty-of-Other, Other-Emptiness) (gZhan stong). See also n. 815. Jamgön Kongtrul’s statements are similar to those made by Tāranātha in his Essence of Shentong (gZhan stong snying po): “There are two [kinds] of Mādhyamikas: ordinary Mādhyamikas and great Mādhyamikas. The ordinary [Madhyamaka] is known in this land of Tibet as Rangtong and [its followers] are known in both India and Tibet as Proponents of the Absence of a Nature . . . Great Madhyamaka is known in Tibet as Shentong, and is the Vijñapti-Madhyamaka (Madhyamaka of [the Proponents of] Cognition)” ([178.3:] dbu ma pa la dbu ma phal pa dang/ dbu ma chen po gnyis kyi phal po ni bod yul ’dir rang stong du grags shing rgya bod gnyis kar du ngo bo nyid med par smra ba zhes grags pa ste/ . . .

Pa-tsap Lotsāwa Nyima Drak (Pa tshab lo tsā ba Nyi ma grags) (eleventh cen-tury) is said to be the first to use these two terms, but since his works are no longer available, the earliest source for distinctions between Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika is the Sakya master Sonam Tsemo’s (bSod nams rtse mo) (1142–1182) Commentary on the “Entrance to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life” (Byang chub sems dpa’i spyod pa la ’jug pa’i ’grel pa). By the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries these had become accepted and were the commonly used divisions for Madhyamaka in Tibet. Nevertheless, there has been much disagreement regarding their validity as clas-sifications and their meaning. Butön, for example, considered them “an artificial Tibetan conceptual creation (bod kyi rang bzo) without much merit” (Dreyfus and McClintock 2003, 1–5), whereas Tsongkhapa argues that they are founded upon distinctions made in Chandrakīrti’s Lucid Words and are not Tibetans’ own fabrica-tions (Cutler and Newland 2002, 116).

For Mipham’s per-spective, see Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 6–20. The two known uses of Svātantrika in Indian works are as follows: The terms Svātantrika (rang rgyud pa) and Svātantrika-Madhyamaka (dbu ma rang rgyud pa) are found in the eleventh-century Kashmiri Jayānanda’s Commentary on the “Entrance to the Middle Way” (Madhyamakāvatāraṭīkā, dBu ma la ’jug pa’i ’grel bshad) as the iden-tification of Chandrakīrti’s opponents, but he does not use the term Prāsaṅgika (thal ’gyur pa). (Jayānanda simply refers to Chandrakīrti’s own doctrine as Madhyamaka.) See Ruegg 2000, 20n38. Yoshimizu says (2003, 276n3) that the other reported use is “that the *Lakṣaṇaṭīkā gives Bhāviveka the appellation svatantrasādhanavādin. This text is supposed to have been composed earlier than the last quarter of the eleventh century . . .” (See Yoshimizu reference for more information.)

In this regard, overall it seems that his views are in keeping with those expressed by Mikyö Dorjé and the Sakya scholars Rongtön Sheja Kunrik (Rong ston shes bya kun rig) (1367–1449) and Gorampa Sonam Seng-gé (Go rams pa bsod nams seng ge) (1429–1489).

A brief account of the historical aspects of the Svātantrika-Prāsaṅgika split is given in Chapter 9, p. 218. 637 Views (dṛiṣhṭi, lta ba) and mental afflictions (klesha, nyon mongs pa) are of five kinds each. The five views are (1) the view, or belief, in the perishing collection [i.e., the aggregates, as being a self] (satkāyadṛiṣhṭi, ’jig tshogs la lta ba); (2) a view holding to an extreme (antagrahādṛiṣhṭi, mthar ’dzin gyi lta ba); (3) wrong views (mithyādṛiṣhṭi, log lta); (4) holding a view to be supreme (dṛiṣhṭiparāmarsha, lta ba mchog ’dzin); and (5) holding an ethical conduct or a discipline to be supreme (shīlavrataparāmarsha, tshul khrims brtul zhugs mchog ’dzin bcas). The five mental afflictions are (1) desire (rāga, ’dod chags); (2) anger (pratigha, khong khro); (3) pride (māna, nga rgyal); (4) ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa); and (5) doubt (vichikitsā, the tshom).

The refutation of a self-entity of phenomena employs the four, or five, great Madhyamaka reasons (dbu ma’i rigs chen bzhi’am lnga), and the refutation of a self of persons uses the sevenfold reasoning [using the analogy of] a chariot (shing rta rnam bdun gyi rigs pa) (altg notes). Thus, although Jamgön Kongtrul says that the way the two types of self-entity are refuted is explained extensively in the section on reflection, in fact he explains the refutation of a self-entity of phenomena in more detail here: in this chapter’s presentation of the reasons (see pp. 209–211), and in Chapter 10’s even more detailed presentation of the five great reasons (see pp. 235–240). Refutation of a self of persons is discussed in some detail in Chapter 10 (see p. 240), but in more detail in Book Seven, Part Three (TOK, III:69–77). See also Book Seven’s entire section on The Analysis of the Absence of Self-Entity (bdag med dngos dpyad pa) (TOK, III:65–80). The vipashyanā section of Book Eight, Part One, discusses meditation on the twofold absence of self-entity (TOK, III:126–9). 641 Useful and readable presentations of Madhyamaka debate and reasoning (as prac-ticed in Tibet) are found in Brunnhölzl 2004, 172–272 (which includes many sections from this book), and Dreyfus 2003, 195–228.

The other main type of negation used in Indo-Tibetan debate is an implicative negation (paryudāsapratiṣhedha, ma yin dgag), which implies or affirms something in place of the object of negation. 653 The first type of nonimplicative negation negates the existence of a nature of things, such as the aggregates, constituents, and sense spheres. The second type of nonim-plicative negation negates, for example, the mere existence of imagined things, such as a permanent self, or it negates just “nature” (which is separate from an object).

Often a fourth condition is listed, which is, simply put, prior moments of eye consciousness (the causal condition). 668 The analysis of a nature is presented somewhat more fully in Chapter 10, p. 235. 669 The reasoning of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanyāya, rten ’brel gyi rigs pa) is also discussed in Chapter 10, p. 239, as the fifth of the five great reasons."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"endnotes c 375 670 Anavataptanāgarāja-paripṛicchā-sūtra, kLu’i rgyal po ma dros pas zhus pa’i mdo.

(It is also translated as “negative concomitance,” “reverse entailment,” or “reverse pervasion.”) Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso’s Classifications of Reasons (rTags rigs) (86) defines it as “A reason that has been determined not to be present in a single instance of the heterologous set” (mi mthun pa’i phyogs kho na la yod par nges pa’i gtan tshigs). Het-erologous set (or non-concordant class) (vipakṣha, mi mthun phyogs) is that which does not correspond to the predicate. In the case of the five Madhyamaka reasonings, from the perspective of their meaning, the predicate is the absence of any nature (rang bzhin med pa); thus the heterologous set would be an existent nature. Since there is no such thing as an existent nature, it is not possible to say that the reason employed (such as that of dependent origination) is not present in a single instance of the heterologous set. See also Brunnhölzl 2004, 885n582. 672 what is to be pervaded (khyab par bya ba) means a specific item, and its pervader (khyab par byed pa) is a larger, general set that includes it. In this case, “no link” (’brel pa med pa) between those two means that since there is no inherent nature of things in general, there is no specific instance of an inherent nature that can be discussed either.

There are also two modes of valid cognition for the Svātantrikas according to the object: conventional and ultimate. Their assertions about conventional valid cogni-tion conform with their views of conventional reality, which are aligned with either the Sautrāntikas or Yogāchāras. Ultimate valid cognition is the ultimate inferential valid cognition that arises from the investigation of the ultimate (which occurs on the path of junction) and ultimate direct valid cognition, which is yogic direct valid cognition (altg).

It is worth noting that Brunnhölzl points out (2004, 897n817): According to Rongtön’s commentary on The Entrance into Centrism (Nges don rnam nges), Consequentialists employ, for example, “inferences acknowledged by others” (Tib. gzhan grags kyi rjes dpag), which can be seen as the Consequen-tialist equivalent of autonomous reasoning (Rong ston shes bya kun rig, n.d., pp. 77-78). He further explains: “What is the difference between ‘inferences acknowledged by others’ and autonomous inferences? In a probative argument that establishes an autonomous thesis, the three modes are ascertained. [In inferences] acknowledged by others, it is for the sake of eliminating the wrong ideas of opponents that one states as the reason what these others accept, without however establishing any thesis in an independent way (rang dbang du).” (pp. 83-84). “Au tonomous reasons are rejected, but we do not deny ‘what is to be proven’ and ‘the means to prove’ as mere imputations. . . . Thus, a reason (which is like [the reflection of] the moon in water) makes an opponent (who is like an illu-sion) realize what is to be proven (which is like a dream).” (pp. 74-75). As for the difference between autonomous reasonings and mere absurd con-sequences . . . the latter do not have to involve the correct three modes. This means that they are just unwanted consequences that follow from another position that was wrong in the first place. Thus, they are logically correct, but their explicit meaning must be false, since it is just an absurd outgrowth of a previous false statement. If these consequences (such as “if things arose from themselves, then it would follow that they arise endlessly and pointlessly”) are supplemented with a reason that is the opponent’s explicit or implicit position (such as “because these things exist already”), the second and third modes usu-ally do apply (at least for the opponent). 683 Valid forms of cognition that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things (vastubalapravṛittānumāna, dngos po stobs zhugs kyi tshad ma): see n. 707.

Two are preserved in Chinese: Chung-lun by the Indian master known as Ch’ing-mu and Ta-sheng chung-kuan shih-lun by Sthiramati. The earliest commentary on Nāgārjuna’s work by a commonly accepted known author is Buddhapālita’s Buddhapālita’s Commentary on the “Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way.” The Fearless Commentary (Akutobhayā) is the earliest known com-mentary, but the traditional attribution of authorship to Nāgārjuna is not accepted by followers of Tsongkhapa, by many in the Sakya tradition, and by some modern scholars. There is mention of other (no longer extant) commentaries by Yogāchāra masters (indicating the importance of Nāgārjuna’s work for them): Guṇamati, Dharmapāla, and his student Devasharman.

For a summary of this text, see Potter 2003, 286–305. 690 Bhāvaviveka criticized Buddhapālita in his Lamp of Wisdom. The root statements (rtsa ba’i sbyor ba) are Nāgārjuna’s statements that things do not arise (1) from themselves, (2) from a thing other than themselves, (3) from both themselves and something other than themselves, and (4) without any cause. For an analysis of Bhāvaviveka’s critique of Buddhapālita, see Ames 2003, 46–8. 691 Independently [verifiable] (svatantra, rang rgyud/ rang dbang): There are two aspects to examine to understand the issues and ensuing controversies surrounding this term: the meaning of “independently [verifiable]” (or, as it is often translated “autonomous”), and how—that is, on what level—proof statements, inference, and valid cognition are independently [verifiable]. For a useful analysis of the positions of Bhāvaviveka, Chandrakīrti, and Tsongkhapa, see Yotsuya 1999, 47–72, where he states (72 and 65): In the PMV [Lamp of Wisdom] Bhāvaviveka uses the term svatantra (rang dbang) [independent] variously to describe the reasoning (or inference) of Nāgārjuna, of Bhāvaviveka himself or of his opponent, viz. the Vātsīputrīya. The term svatantra seems to connote 1) that Nāgārjuna demonstrates his own doctrinal position by means of a reasoning, 2) that the argument his opponent presents"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"37\u0018 C the treasury of knowledgeis based upon Bhāvaviveka’s own position, and 3) that the reasoning is valid or correct. Although Candrakīrti does not give a definition of the term svatantra (rang rgyud), his usage can be more clearly elucidated. In Candrakīrti’s critique of svatantra-reasoning (in its wider sense) the term svatantra connotes that a rea-soning which demonstrates one’s own position is employed on the basis of a subject, etc., established in common for both parties in a debate. And the term svatantra is considered to be used especially to emphasize that the subject, etc., are accepted by the proponent, viz. the Mādhyamika himself. According to Tsongkhapa, in contrast, the term svatantra (rang rgyud) con-notes that the subject, etc., are established by virtue of self-character, that is, ultimately. In [one] . . . passage [of Chandrakīrti’s Lucid Words] an important aspect of a svatantra-reasoning is clearly explained: namely, a svatantra-reasoning is a reasoning which is fully equipped with a proposition, a logical reasoning and a logical example. More precisely, it is a reasoning whose elements are established for both parties. By means of it, one proves the content of the the-sis, such as non-origination from self, or refutes the thesis of one’s opponent. This contrasts with refutation by means of a reasoning whose elements are established for the opponent alone, i.e. the pure prasaṅga-method [that is, consequences]. Generally speaking, anything that is “independently verifiable,” “autonomous,” or simply “independent” exists by virtue of its own nature (bhāva, svabhāva); that is, it is “real” in some sense. In the case of so-called independently verifiable proof statements, the question is whether the term means that the elements involved—the subject, evidence, and examples—are real, i.e., have independent existence. (As just shown, Yotsuya’s analysis is that Bhāvaviveka did not intend such acceptance.) Another issue of contention for Mādhyamikas is whether the use of such reasonings implies their acceptance of this “independent reality” as their opponents accept it, in accordance with the Indian debate rule for inferences or probative arguments (prayoga[vākya], sbyor ba[’i ngag]) whereby the subject must be acknowledged in common by both opponents (mthun snang du grub pa). As Yotsuya says (1999, 73), “within the milieu of Indian Buddhist logic, it was generally considered impossible for a person to demonstrate his doctrinal position or refute that of his opponent by means of an inferential statement whose subject, etc., were not accepted in common by both parties.” Bhāvaviveka’s use of independently [verifiable] proof statements has given rise to much commentary, extrapolation of other positions, and disagreement, since, of course, anyone who is a Mādhyamika does not agree with a Realist on the matter of whether subjects and so forth exist in reality. Thus, independently [verifiable] reasonings (and independently [verifiable] theses, rang rgyud kyi dam bca’) and what is or is not implied by their use is a pivotal difference between the approach of Bhāvaviveka and that of Chandrakīrti; and these are explained and understood differently by the various Tibetan scholars and traditions. Readers should refer to Brunnhölzl 2004, 373–92, Eckel 2003, McClintock 2003, Yoshimizu 2003, and Yotsuya 1999, for explanations and citations that support that, for Bhāvaviveka, Shāntarakṣhita, and Kamalashīla, the use of independently [verifi-able] reasoning or valid cognition when debating with Realists does not entail the acceptance of the Realists’ views regarding the reality of the subjects for the debate. For example, McClintock says (2003, 145, 150):"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"endnotes c 379My contention is that Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla have a different understand-ing of autonomous inference, one that dispenses with the metalogical require-ment that all elements in the inference be established as appearing similarly (mthun snang du grub pa) as mKhas grub [or Ke-drup] understands this require-men t . . . Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla understand agreement concerning the subject of a debate to come about through a shared participation in some form of error . . . Thus, even when his realist opponents have a different intellectual understanding of the elements involved in an inference—including, most sig-nificantly, the manner in which these elements are established to appear—a Mādhyamika can still, due to a primordial ignorance shared with others, find some common ground from which to begin the dialectical process of demon-strating that unassailably real natures do not exist . . . Yet as a Mādhyamika, one will always be keenly aware that no autonomous inference at any level is ever anything more than provisional. Dr awing from the Kagyu system, Brunnhölzl (2004, 347) presents Mikyö Dorjé’s view as follows: For a reasoning to be an autonomous reasoning, the Eighth Karmapa says, it does not matter whether others accept the three modes or not. when a debater generates an inferential cognition in another debater in such a way that the first debater himself or herself pronounces the three modes, then these three modes are autonomously or independently pronounced as such by the first debater and not in dependence on others. Brunnhölzl notes here (2004, 897n815): This is obviously an interpretation of the term “autonomous” (svatantra/rang rgyud) that is different from the Gelukpa understanding (the latter requiring the three modes in relation to phenomena that are established through their own specific characteristics and a corresponding valid cognition). Mikyö Dor-je’s explanation of the term “autonomous” seems furthermore to hinge on the double meaning of svatantra/rang rgyud, since this can also mean “one’s own continuum.” Inasmuch as all reasonings employed by Consequentialists arise and are pronounced within their own personal continua, such reasonings are “autonomous” in this sense, since they clearly do not arise or are pronounced within the continua of others. Thus, the above passage could also be read, “. . . these three modes are stated as such by the first debater’s own continuum (rang rgyud) and not by the continuum of others (gzhan rgyud).” Fo r analyses of the perspectives of Tsongkhapa and his followers, see Cabezón 2003; Eckel 2003; Ruegg 2000, 233–304; Yoshimizu 2003; and Yotsuya 1999.

He excelled in debate and was the first to use the dialectical methods developed by Dignāga in a Madhyamaka context, which are found in his Lamp of Wisdom. He is also considered the first to make the distinction between a “nominal ultimate” (paryāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs pa’i don dam) and “non-nominal ulti-mate” (aparyāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs ma yin pa’i don dam), as found in his Sum-mary of the Meaning of the Middle Way (Madhyamakārthasaṃgraha, dBu ma’i don bsdus pa). Bhāvaviveka criticizes the view of the three natures in Chapter 25 of his Lamp of Wisdom (Prajñāpradīpa, Shes rab sgron ma). His Heart of the Middle Way (with its auto-commentary, Blaze of Reasoning) is noted for its refutation of Yogāchāra (fifth chapter) and for being the first Buddhist compendium of both Buddhist and non-Buddhist Indian philosophical systems (it may be the first of this type of text in all of Indian philosophical writing). His works are only preserved in Tibetan translation. See Eckel 1992, 2–15; and Ruegg 1981, 61–7. For information on the form of his name and authorship of texts, see also nn. 614 and 628. 695 Shrīgupta (dPal sbas) (seventh century) was a contemporary of Dharmakīrti and teacher of Jñānagarbha. He wrote the Commentary on Entering Suchness (Tattvāvatāravṛitti, De kho na la ’jug pa’i ’grel pa), which uses the reasoning of being neither a unity nor a plurality to demonstrate that the suchness of all things is their absence of any nature (see Ruegg 1981, 67–8). Butön considers Shrīgupta to be a Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka (see Obermiller 1932, 134). 696 Jñānagarbha (Ye shes snying po) (eighth century) was a master at Nālandā, student of Shrīgupta, and the ordaining abbot and teacher of Shāntarakṣhita. He wrote the Differentiation of the Two Truths (Satyadvaya-vibhaṇga, bDen gnyis rnam ’byed). See Eckel 1987.

He went to Tibet in 1042, where he taught widely and worked closely with a number of translators, including Rinchen Zangpo (Rin chen bzang po), on the translation of treatises by Bhāvaviveka, Chandrakīrti, Dharmapāla, Vasubandhu, and others.

This distinction is based upon their presentations of conventional reality. The division of Svātantrikas into Sautrāntika-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas and Yogāchāra-Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas became well established in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Tibet with Tsongkhapa’s Essence of Eloquence (Legs bshad snying po) and his student Ke-drup Jé’s Introduction to the Buddhist Tantric Systems (rGyud sde spyi’i rnam par gzhag pa rgyas par brjod). See respectively Thurman 1984, 266–77; and Lessing and wayman, 1968, 90. It is not known whether these were models accepted at the time, though a prece-dence is evident in a late thirteenth- to mid-fourteenth-century Bön work, Clarifying the Doors of Bön (Bon sgo gsal byed), by Tretön Gyaltsen Pal (Tre ston rgyal mtshan dpal). This being a Bön work, of course, implies that the subdivisions were made in Buddhist works of that time; see Mimaki 1983, 164–7. Longchenpa in his Precious Treasury of the Supreme Yāna divides Svātantrika into lower Svātantrika (rang rgyud ’og ma) and higher Svātantrika (rang rgyud gong ma), which Mipham follows in his Compendium of Philosophical Tenet Systems (Yid bzhin mdzod kyi grub mtha’ bsdus pa) (see Phuntsho 2005, 238n38). 706 Bhāvaviveka makes this distinction in his Precious Lamp of Madhyamaka (Dg.T. Beijing 57:1539). See also nn. 628 and 629. Note that in Chapter 7, p. 201, Jamgön Kongtrul uses these descriptive categories to refer to Rangtong and Shentong. 707 Established through the power of [their relationship to real] things (also tr anslated as “operating by the power of facts”) (dngos stobs kyis grub pa; and *vastubalapravṛitta, dngos po stobs zhugs): On this technical phrase, Tillemans com-ments (1999a, 28–9):The usual types of inferences which we associate with Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, such as those of sound’s impermanence and the like, are said to be vastubalapravṛittānumāna [inferences functioning through the force of real"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"3\u00182 C the treasury of knowledgeentities] in that they derive their truth from the fact that the reason—being a product (kṛtakatva)—is in reality, or objectively, related with the property—impermanence—and qualifies the subject, sound . . . (Often, for convenience, we will adopt a less literal translation for this technical term, i.e., “objective inference.” The point here, very briefly, is that the usual or paradigmatic type of inference in Dharmakīrti is one which functions objectively, or “by the force of real entities,” in that it can and should be evaluated purely on the basis of facts and states of affairs, and not in any way because of belief, acceptance or faith in someone or his words.) Si nce the use of reasons established through the power of [their relationship to real] things is one of the key issues said to separate Svātantrikas and Prāsaṅgikas, the Svātantrika view on the ontological status of “things” (vastu, dngos po) is important. To understand their position, we must look at their presentation of conventional reality, which distinguishes between correct and mistaken conventional reality, and their presentation of ultimate reality (see pp. 220–222), and identify the context in which “reasons are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.” It is the view of Mikyö Dorjé, as stated in Brunnhölzl 2004 (361–2), that Svātantrikas only accept “established through the power of [their relationship to real] things” on a conventional level, and that these “real” things are illusionlike, dependently originated entities.

(TN) 708 Longchenpa discusses these four positions regarding the two truths in the Svātantrika section of his Precious Treasury of Philosophical Systems (Grub mtha’ mdzod); see forthcoming translation by Richard Barron. Longchenpa’s analysis is such that the third alternative in Jamgön Kongtrul’s list (the fourth in Longchenpa’s)—that the two truths are discrete simply as a negation of their sameness—is considered to be the inevitable conclusion reached by Svātantrikas. For further discussion of whether the two truths are one or different, see Brunnhölzl 2004, 88-94. For a succinct comparison of the views of Chapa Chökyi Seng-gé (Phya pa chos kyi seng ge), Tsongkhapa, and others on the differences between the two truths, see Tauscher 2003, 235 and 253n100. 709 An isolate (or reverse; distinguisher) (vyatireka, ldog pa) is a conceptual object and refers to the conceptual process of isolation or elimination, which operates when-ever we think of something. For example, when we think “impermanent phenom-ena,” we conceptually exclude or eliminate everything that is not an impermanent phenomenon, and we isolate the notion of “impermanent phenomena.” The point here is that the truths are simply synonyms in the same way that “Fourteenth Dalai Lama” and “Tenzin Gyatso” are simply different names for the same person. 710 Capable of performing a function (arthakriyāsamartham, don byed nus pa): see n. 307. 711 “To appear [to its cognizing subject] in a way that is consistent with its respec-tive class [of phenomena]” (rang rang gi rigs pa mthun par snang ba) means that objects—i.e., particulars, or specifically characterized phenomena (svalakṣhaṇa, rang mtshan)—that are misperceived, such as snow mountains appearing to be yellow for someone with jaundice, do not qualify as correct conventional reality.

It is formulated by excluding the possibility that phenomena do not possess the “quality” of emptiness. Although this does mean that phenomena possess the quality of emptiness (and this form of negation does explicitly emphasize that all phenomena are empty), from the point of view of the way the negation is stated, it means that they do not really possess any quality. (I am grateful to both Āchārya Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen and Karl Brunnhölzl for help on this point.) 714 Satyadvaya-vibhaṅga, bDen gnyis rnam ’byed, by Jñānagarbha. Toh. 3881; Dg.T. Bei-jing 62. Jñānagarbha uses the terms “approximate ultimate” (don dam dang mthun pa’i don dam) and “non-nominal ultimate” (rnam grangs ma yin pa’i don dam). See Eckel 1992, 71–2 and 112n9. The primary source for the twofold presentation of the ultimate seems to be Bhāvaviveka’s Summary of the Meaning of Madhyamaka (Madhyamakārthasaṃgraha, dBu ma’i don bsdus pa) and the third chapter of his Blaze of Reasoning, in which texts he uses the terms “nominal ultimate” (paryāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs pa’i don dam) and “non-nominal ultimate” (aparyāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs ma yin pa’i don dam). See Lindtner 1981, 200n14; and Eckel 2003, 202n48. These divisions are presented in Shāntarakṣhita’s Ornament of the Middle Way (see Padmakara Translation Group 2005, 108–9 and 294–311) and Longchenpa’s The Precious Treasury of Philosophical Systems (see Barron forthcoming). 715 For another statement of the position of some Svātantrikas regarding fruition, see Chapter 8, p. 216. 716 The outline heading here is slightly different from when the section is presented (see Chapter 10, p. 233). For the sake of consistency, I am using the second form, “The Specific Explanation of Ground, Path, and Result [in Madhyamaka],” gzhi lam ’bras gsum bye brag tu bshad (TOK, II:533.15), as opposed to what appears here, “The Specific Classifications of Ground, Path, and Result [in Madhyamaka],” gzhi lam ’bras gsum bye brag tu dbye (TOK, II:527.8). 717 The four valid means of cognition (pramāṇa, tshad ma) were propounded by the Nyāyas (Logicians) and became widely accepted in Indian philosophical circles (see Dreyfus 1997, 293–4). Of these four, Buddhists, as followers of the epistemological treatises of Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, only accept direct perception and inference as valid forms of cognition. Broadly speaking, Chandrakīrti and his followers were the exception and accepted the use of all four in debate with others. Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso (1996b/2000) says, “the general definition of valid cognition is ‘a new and undeceiving awareness’” (gsar du mi bslu ba’i rig pa tha snyad tshad ma spyi’i mtshan nyid); and “the definition from the point of view of dispelling wrong ideas is ‘an awareness which clarifies what was not known [previously]’” (ma shes don gsal gyi rig pa log rtog bsal ba’i dbang du byas pa’i mtshan nyid). (In the follow-ing paragraphs, the definitions for direct perceptual valid cognition and inferential valid cognition are from Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso 1996b/2000.)(1) Direct perceptual valid cognition (pratyakṣhapramāṇa, mngon sum tshad ma) is defined as “a nonconceptual and nonmistaken awareness” (rtog pa dang bral zhing ma ’khrul pa’i rig pa). It is of four types: sense direct percep-tion (indriya pratyakṣha, dbang po’i mngon sum), mental direct perception (mānasapratyakṣha, yid kyi mngon sum), reflexively aware direct perception (rang rig mngon sum), and yogic direct perception (yogi pratyakṣha, rnal ’byor mngon sum). For definitions of these subcategories, see the Classifications of Mind and Book Six, Part One (TOK, II:233–4)."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"3\u00184 C the treasury of knowledge Generally, Tibetan commentators agree that on a conventional level Prāsaṅgikas accept sense, mental, and yogic direct perceptions, but they disagree about whether Prāsaṅgikas accept reflexively aware direct percep-tion. Tsongkhapa, for example, states that Prāsaṅgikas do not accept reflex-ive awareness, not even conventionally (this is one of the “eight difficult points”; see p. 247 and n. 803 for related sources); whereas Mipham states that Prāsaṅgikas do accept reflexively aware direct perception convention-ally (see Pettit 1999, 129 and 497n451). According to Āchārya Lama Tenpa Gyaltsen (altg), Mikyö Dorjé often criticizes reflexive awareness, but he does not make a clear statement on whether the Prāsaṅgikas accept it con-ventionally or reject it completely. It is generally understood that Mikyö Dorjé’s refutations of reflexive awareness are only refutations on the level of slight analysis. (2) Inferential valid cognition (anumāṇapramāṇa, rjes dpag tshad ma) is of two types: inference for oneself (rang don rjes dpag) and inference for oth-ers (gzhan don rjes dpag). Inference for oneself is defined as “an awareness newly realizing that which is to be proven by a reason having the three modes” (tshul gsum pa can gyi rtags las bsgrub bya gsar du rtogs pa’i rig pa). It arises in dependence upon the three basic types of reasons: reasons of nature (’bras bu’i gtan tshigs), reasons of results (rang bzhin gyi gtan tshigs), and reasons of imperception (ma dmigs pa’i gtan tshig). Inference for others is defined as “A sentence construction fully clarifying for others the fact seen by the disputant himself, [i.e.,] a reason having the three modes” (rgol ba rang nyid kyi mthong pa’i don tshul gsum pa can gyi gtan tshigs gzhan la rab tu gsal bar byed pa’i tshig sbyor).

Dreyfus says (1997, 294), “Nyāya-sūtra I.1.7 explains the epistemological status of testimony: ‘Verbal testimony (śabda) is the com-munication (upadeśa) from a trustworthy person (āpta).’” For Buddhists, the status of scriptural authority as a form of valid cognition is a topic of much discussion. Some consider it a form of inference, others do not. It is gen-erally said to be the means for cognizing that which is extremely hidden (atyantaparokṣha, shin tu lkog gyur). See Tillemans 1999a, 28-32 and 37–51; Tillemans 1999b, 395–404; and Dunne 2004, 230–45.(4) Analogy (or analogical induction) (upamāṇa, nye bar ’jal ba) is the use of examples to bring about cognition of something formerly unknown. Dreyfus says (1997, 529n41) that Buddhist epistemologists consider this to be a form of inference.

He was a Sakya master and student of the seventh Kar-mapa, Chödrak Gyamtso. As we can see from Jamgön Kongtrul’s liberal quoting of Shākya Chokden’s works in Chapter 11, he is one of the major sources for Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation of Shentong. It also seems that much of Chapters 9 and 10 are drawn from Shākya Chokden’s The Dharma Treasury of an Ocean of Scriptures and Reasonings Ascertaining the Middle Way (dBu ma rnam par nges pa’i chos kyi bang mdzod lung dang rigs pa’i rgya mtsho). See also Dreyfus 1997, 27–9; Iaroslav 2000; and Mathes 2004. 722 In his Entrance to the Middle Way, Chandrakīrti devotes a large section of Chapter 6 to refuting the four possible causes for arising as a demonstration that phenomena have no self-entity (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). The Sāṃkhyas’ position that things arise from themselves is refuted in verses 8c–13. The refutation of the idea held by some Buddhists that things arise from something other than themselves is presented in verses 14–21 (further discussions and ramifications of this refutation are found in verses 22–97). The Jains’ view that things arise from both themselves and from things other than themselves is refuted in verse 98. The Chārvākas’ asser-tion that things arise without cause is refuted in verses 99–103. See Huntington 1989, 158–69; Padmakara Translation Group 2002, 183–266; and Goldfield et al. 2005, 35–305. The vajra sliver reasoning is also discussed later in this chapter. See The Explana-tion of the Way [the Two Truths] Are Established, pp. 236–238. 723 Sāṃkhyas (Calculators or Enumerators) (Grangs can pa) are followers of the old-est of the “orthodox” philosophical schools, that is, schools that take the Vedas as authoritative. The Vedic sage Kapila is traditionally said to be the founder of the Sāṃkhya school (though this is not verified), which also serves as the philosophical system for Patañjali’s system of Yoga. Sāṃkhyas posit a metaphysical dualism between the ultimates of prakṛiti (primal matter) (rang bzhin) and puruṣha (person or ātman) (skyes bu). They believe that, with the exception of puruṣha, everything is a manifestation of, or transformation within, prakṛiti, the primal matter. In that way, all results can be said to be funda-mentally identical with their causes, and Sāṃkhyas are said to hold the position that things arise from themselves. See Hiriyanna 1932, 267–97; Hiriyanna 1948, 106–28; Hopkins 1983, 321–6; and Brunnhölzl 2004, 795–6. 724 “The entailment is not definite” (or “[the reason’s] entailment [of the consequence] is not ascertained”) (de la khyab pa ma nges pa) means that Sāṃkhyas do not accept that their statement (used here as the reason) entails the consequence Prāsaṅgikas have stated. In other words, they do not accept that a result being present at the time of its cause necessarily means that its arising is pointless. 725 When Sāṃkhyas say, “Those two [cases] are not comparable (de gnyis mi mtshungs),” they are objecting to the way Prāsaṅgikas apply their thesis (things arise from them-selves) to both unmanifest results (e.g., sesame oil present within a sesame seed prior to its extraction) and manifest results (e.g., the extracted sesame oil). 726 The Prāsaṅgikas’ point is that the consequences they already stated, which show the absurdity of saying that something already existent arises again, would apply to"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"3\u00186 C the treasury of knowledgea vase as a lump of clay. The Sāṃkhyas’ attempt to clarify their position and avoid accepting the Prāsaṅgikas’ consequences amounts to nothing more than a restate-ment of their original position albeit with qualifications. In short, the Sāṃkhyas have not brought anything new to their argument. 727 Inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others refer to the every-day experience and understanding of people in the world, such as that planting seeds and tending crops will produce a harvest. Sāṃkhyas do not want, for example, to accept the consequence that if things arise from themselves, they will arise in a meaningless fashion, because then any work, like farming, would be useless and unjustified. Sāṃkhyas are now left with no argument to support their view that things arise from themselves. 728 Mādhyamikas consider the Buddhist Realists to be Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas, who believe, as is described in their abhidharma texts, that discrete results arise from existent, discrete causes. Mādhyamikas also regard Chittamātras who consider the ālaya consciousness to be truly existent to be Realists. See also n. 596. 729 The refutation of arising from other comes down to the fact that for two things to be inherently different from each other (rang bzhin gyis gzhan) they have to exist at the same time. (“Other” here does not mean simply a notion of otherness that we impute to objects.) If they exist at the same time, they cannot be in a cause and result relationship with each other. For a more detailed refutation of production from other, see pp. 236–237. 730 By saying that the entailment is not definite, Realists mean that even though they say one thing arises from something entirely different from itself, they do not accept the consequence the Prāsaṅgikas have stated. In other words, for these Realists, a sprout arising from a seed and a sprout and a seed being inherently other are not mutually exclusive (’gal ba). 731 Here Realists are simply adding a qualification to their position that things arise from something other than themselves and as such, it is merely a restatement of their original position. The Prāsaṅgikas’ reply means that the previous consequences would apply to something that has the potential to produce a result. 732 Nirgranthas (“Those Freed from Bondage”) (Tib. gCer bu pa, Naked Ones) is a com-mon name in Buddhist works for Jains (Followers of the Victor) (rGyal ba pa), specifically for the Digambaras (Sky-Clad Ones), who were the naked ascetics (all other Jains are known as Shvetāmbaras, white Clad Ones). The founder of Jainism was Vardhamāna Mahāvīra, also known as Jina (the Victor), a contemporary of the Buddha. Jains observe a strict ethical code of five vows—nonviolence (ahiṃsā), truth (satya), not stealing (asteya), chastity (brahmacharya), and renunciation (or non-possessiveness) (aparigraha).

Chārvākas only accept direct perception as a valid means of cognition or knowledge. Thus they do not accept any causality that is not directly perceptible, or the existence of past and future lives. They were denounced by all other philosophi-cal traditions of their time for what were considered immoral views.

If things had no causes, they would either always arise or never at all, that is, there would be no reason for them to appear or not appear. we can see, however, that this is not the case: things appear when their specific causes and conditions are present.

Yogic conventionality (rnal ’byor kun rdzob) is what is experienced by Buddhist yogic practitioners, beginning with their initial stage of slight analysis and conceptual understanding of emptiness, through the appearances and realizations they experience as noble beings. These divisions of conventional reality are discussed in Book Seven, Part Two (TOK, III:31–2). For the Svātantrikas’ division of conventional reality into correct and mistaken, see Chapter 9, p. 221.

Although often translated as “post-meditation,” it refers to the level of realization of emptiness that is attained when emerging from meditative equipoise. Bodhisattvas then apply this realization to seeing the illusionlike nature of all appearances and experiences while they engage in the six pāramitās.

See Huntington 1989, 162; Padmakara Translation Group 2002, 79 and 80–1; and Goldfield et al. 2005, 237. This explanation of the two truths as method and the outcome of method should be understood in terms of the perceiving subject, our minds, not in terms of objects, such as appearances and their emptiness. The designation of the conventional real-ity as method and ultimate reality as the outcome indicates the way an understand-ing of the two truths develops in our minds—it is not that conventional reality is the cause of the ultimate nor is it that the ultimate is the result of the conventional reality.

An example of a reason of the imperception of a result connected to the predicate is: “In this smoke-free room, there is no fire, because no smoke is perceived through any form of valid cognition.” The predicate of the negandum is “there is a fire.” The fact that a result (smoke) connected to the phenomenon in question (fire) is not perceived in this room serves as the reason that negates the existence of this phenomenon (fire). See Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso 1996a/1999; and Brunnhölzl 2004, 180–1. 754 Reasons of the perception of something contradictory [to the predicate of the negan-dum] (viruddhopalabdhihetu, ’gal zla dmigs pa’i gtan tshigs): Something that is contra-dictory to the predicate of the negandum may be (1) its nature (rang bzhin), (2) its result (’bras bu), or (3) a subset of it (khyab bya). An example of using a reason of the perception of something whose nature is con-tradictory to the predicate is: “Right next to a hot fire, there is no lasting sensation of coldness, because a hot fire is perceived there.” The predicate of the negandum is “a lasting feeling of coldness.” The fact that something whose nature is contradic-tory (a hot fire) to the phenomenon in question (an ongoing sensation of cold) is"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"endnotes c 3\u00189perceived serves as the reason that negates the existence of this phenomenon (an ongoing sensation of cold). Or to use the reasoning of dependent origination: “Outer and inner phenomena do not come into being, because they are dependently originated.” The predicate is “come into being.” The perception of something contradictory (phenomena being dependently originated) to the predicate serves as the reason to negate it. 755 The five reasons are also presented in Chapter 8; see pp. 209–211. 756 The three doors to liberation (vimokṣhamukhatraya, rnam thar sgo gsum) are avenues, or ways, to liberation presented in the Prajñāpāramitā literature. Here these three doors are demonstrated through the first three forms of analysis: By analyzing the nature of phenomena, we understand it to be emptiness (shūnyatā, stong pa nyid); that is emptiness as a door to liberation. By analyzing phenomena in terms of their causes, we see that they actually have no defining characteristics, and this absence of characteristics (animitta, mtshan ma med pa) serves as a door to liberation. By analyzing phenomena in terms of their results, we recognize that they do not really come into being, and this leads us to the absence of expectancy (apraṇihita, smon pa med pa) as a door to liberation. 757 In Buddhist logic, three modes (or criteria) (trairūpya/ trirūpa, tshul gsum) are exam-ined to determine whether a reason is valid or not: the subject property, the positive entailment, and the negative entailment. These are concerned with the reason’s rela-tionship to the subject and to the predicate. If they are determined to be correct, the reason is a valid means to establish what is to be proven. The following definitions are from Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso’s Classifications of Reasons (86).1. The subject property (pakṣhadharmatā/-tva, phyogs chos) is defined as “a rea-son that valid cognition has determined to be present in all instances of the flawless subject in question in a corresponding formulation” (shes ’dod chos can skyon med kyi steng du ’god tshul dang mthun par yod pa nyid du tshad mas nges pa’i gtan tshigs). Simply put, it means that the reason is a property, or quality, of the subject (that is, the subject is either equivalent to the reason or a subset of it).2. Positive entailment (anvayavyāpti, rjes khyab) is defined as “a reason that has been determined to be present only in the homologous set [of the predicate]” (mthun pa’i phyogs kho na la yod par nges pa’i gtan tshigs). Simply put, the reason is equivalent to the predicate or a subset of it.3. Negative entailment (vyatirekavyāpti, ldog khyab) is defined as “a reason that has been determined not to be present in a single instance of the heterolo-gous set” (mi mthun pa’i phyogs kho na la yod par nges pa’i gtan tshigs). (See also n. 671.) Fo r more discussion of the three modes, see Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso 1996a/1999; Brunnhölzl 2004, 177–9; Dreyfus 1997; Dunne 2004; Matilal 1998, 6–7 and 90–94; and Perdue 1993. 758 The vajra sliver reasoning is presented at some length earlier in this chapter. See A Brief Account of Chandrakīrti’s Exegetical System, pp. 226–228. 759 This means that if something actually arises it will do so through one of these four ways (from itself, from something other than itself, from both, or causelessly)—there is no fifth possibility.

Chandrakīrti, however, refutes aris-ing from the four extremes in great detail in Chapter 6 of his Entrance to the Middle Way. See Huntington 1989, 158–69; Padmakara Translation Group 2002, 183–266; and Goldfield et al. 2005, 35–305. 761 See also n. 723. 762 Object-consistent consciousnesses (or factually concordant types of consciousness) (shes rig don mthun) are the six consciousnesses, which always arise in keeping with their respective objects (that is, an eye consciousness will arise only with a physical form as its object, never a sound). Vaibhāṣhikas explain that the six conscious-nesses arise from their four conditions (pratyaya, rkyen): object condition (dmigs rkyen); dominant condition (bdag rkyen); proximate condition (de ma thag rkyen); and causal condition (rgyu’i rkyen). For example, an eye consciousness arises from visual forms (its object condition), the eye sense faculty (its dominant condition), the just-ceased preceding moment of eye consciousness (its proximate condition), and, simply put, prior moments of eye consciousness (its causal condition). The scriptural source for this is the Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 2, verse 64a: “Mind and mental events arise from the four [conditions].” See Pruden 1988, 305. Note that at TOK, II:536.1 shes rigs don mthun should be shes rig don mthun. 763 “Most [other] entities” mean non-associated formative forces (ldan min ’du byed) and forms (gzugs), which are the phenomena other than the consciousnesses, men-tal events, and unconditioned phenomena. The Treasury of Abhidharma, Chapter 2, verse 64c says, “Other [phenomena] arise from the two.” Vasubandhu explains that “other” phenomena are non-associ-ated [formative forces] and forms, and that “the two” are causal conditions and dominant conditions. See Pruden 1988, 306. For information on non-associated formative forces, see n. 310. Jamgön Kongtrul says, “Most [other] entities arise from their causal and domi-nant conditions,” to exclude the Vaibhāṣhikas’ category of permanent entities (rtag pa’i dngos po), which are unconditioned phenomena (altg). See Chapter 3, p. 131. 764 For a synopsis of the key point in the refutation of arising from other, see n. 729. 765 This is a terse statement of an absurd consequence that Prāsaṅgikas deduce from th e assertion that phenomena actually arise from something other than themselves. To state this in a fuller way: If it were the case that phenomena arise from things that are other than them-selves, anything could arise from anything, because both the causes of a specific thing and what are not its causes are equal in being “other” than the particular result. For example, a rice sprout could arise as easily from a barley seed as from a rice seed, because a barley seed and a rice seed are equally other than the rice sprout. Another frequently stated absurd consequence is that flames would arise from darkness. For a thorough presentation of this line of refutation, see Chapter 6 of Chandrakīrti’s Entrance to the Middle Way, specifically verses 14–21, in Huntington 1989; Padmakara Translation Group 2002; and Goldfield et al. 2005. 766 Here, a substantial [cause] (up ādāna[hetu], nyer len [gyi rgyu]) is a direct cause (dngos rgyu), which produces its own particular result. For example, a sunflower"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"endnotes c 391seed is the substantial cause for a sunflower sprout. Substantial causes by defini-tion must precede their results. This is an important clarification because, of the six causes and four conditions (all of which contribute to the arising of a result and some of which may exist at the same time as the result), it is the substantial cause that is the focus of this debate (altg). (Note that substantial cause is also translated as “primary cause” or “perpetuating cause.”) 767 In his Entrance to the Middle Way, Chandrakīrti refutes the idea that a cause and its result are simultaneous; see verses 18–20 of Chapter 6. 768 This is a reference to the third of the five great reasons. See p. 238. 769 The four possibilities (chatuṣhkoṭi, mu bzhi) are (1) that only one result manifests from just a single cause; (2) that numerous results are produced by only one cause; (3) that a single result comes from many causes; and (4) that many results could arise from many causes. 770 See Chapter 8, p. 210. 771 Chapter 7, verse 16ab.

It is also used by Nāgasena in The Questions of King Milinda (see Rhys Davids 1890, 43–5). Nāgārjuna in his Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way (Chapter 22, verses 1–8) presents a fivefold analysis. Chandrakīrti also presents this fivefold analysis in his Entrance to the Middle Way, Chapter 6, verses 121–136, and then he adds two more points in verses 150d–162. 776 Other-exclusion (or elimination; elimination of other) (an yāpoha, gzhan sel): Gener-ally speaking and put very simply, the term “other-exclusion” indicates that the conceptual mind apprehends its object by way of exclusion. For example, when we think “rose,” our minds eliminate all that is not rose to arrive at the general object “rose.” This theory of exclusion, apoha, was first introduced in Buddhist works by Dignāga in his Compendium on Valid Cognition, and discussed by Dharmakīrti and later Shāntarakṣhita and Kamalashīla. For more on apoha theory in the works of Dharmakīrti, Shāntarakṣhita, and the Tibetan traditions, see Dreyfus 1997, particu-larly Chapters 11–13.

Because primordial wisdom is the basis, or ground, for the pāramitās of the bhūmis, the primordial wisdom of the first bhūmi is equivalent to the pāramitā of generosity, the primordial wisdom of the second bhūmi to the pāramitā of ethical conduct, and so on.

The conventional expression “cessation” simply refers to such dissolution. He makes the point that any other position would involve the extremes of permanence or nihilism, e.g., it would be the extreme of nihilism to state that the mind and mental events exist up through the tenth bhūmi and then cease with the attainment of buddhahood. It should be noted that the term cessation (’gags pa) has two senses: (1) cessation as elimination (spangs pa’i ’gags pa), which is also called cessation that is the inter-ruption of continuity (rgyun chad pa’i ’gag pa), and (2) cessation as a transformation (gnas gyur ba’i ’gags pa).

Nevertheless, the elements in his list match those in Tsongkhapa’s Illumination of the Thought with just one exception: whereas Tsongkhapa’s list includes “an uncommon way of positing the three times due to [disintegration being a functioning thing]” (de’i rgyu mtshan gyis dus gsum gyi ’jog tshul thun mong ma yin pa), Jamgön Kongtrul’s does not. Instead, Jamgön Kong-trul has “the existence of things by way of their own characteristics is not accepted even as a convention” (tha snyad du’ang rang gi mtshan nyid kyis grub par khas mi len pa) (A1), which is found in both texts by Gyaltsap Jé (see ACIP S5426). Jamgön Kongtrul’s presentation of these as “four theses associated with refutation and four theses associated with affirmation” (dgag phyogs kyi dam bca’ bzhi/ sgrub phyogs kyi dam bca’ bzhi) is similar to Gyaltsap Jé’s comment that these constitute “four theses involving acceptance and four positions involving non-acceptance” (khas len pa’i dam bca’ bzhi dang mi len pa’i dam bca’ bzhi) (see ACIP S5426; and Ruegg 2002, 158). These points have been the subject of much discussion and, of course, refutation. Numerous Geluk teachers have written on these, ranging from Chang-kya Rolpé Dorjé in his Beautiful Ornament of Philosophical Tenet Systems (see Cozort 1998, 429–78) to Jamyang Shepa, who presents a list of sixteen points in eight pairs in his Great Exposition of Tenets (see Hopkins 2003, 927–47; and Cozort and Preston 2003, 258–71). Brunnhölzl presents (2004, 557–62) Mikyö Dorjé’s assessment of these. Mipham’s views are discussed in Pettit 1998, 128–33; and Dreyfus and McClintock 2003, 324–8. 804 For the sake of comparison, the following is a list of Tsongkhapa’s enumeration of the eight uncommon theses in his Illumination of the Thought (ACIP S5408@124B): (1-2) [The Prāsaṅgika system] has an uncommon way of refuting an ālaya consciousness that is separate in essence from the six modes of consciousness"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"endnotes c 395and reflexive awareness (tshogs drug las ngo bo tha dad pa’i kun gzhi rnam shes dang rang rig ’gog lugs thun mong ma yin pa).(3) It does not accept the use of independently [verifiable] probative arguments to generate [an understanding of] the view of suchness in the mindstream of opponents (rang rgyud kyi sbyor bas phyir rgol gyi rgyud la de kho na nyid kyi lta ba skyed pa khas mi len pa).(4) It is necessary to accept external objects in the same way that cognition is accepted (shes pa khas len pa bzhin du phyi rol gyi don yang khas blang dgos pa).(5) Shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize that entities have no nature (nyan rang la dngos po rang bzhin med par rtogs pa yod pa).(6) Clinging to a self-entity of phenomena is posited as an affliction (chos kyi bdag ’dzin nyon mongs su ’jog pa).(7) Disintegration is a [functioning] thing (zhig pa dngos po yin pa).(8) Therefore, [this system] has an uncommon way of positing the three times (de’i rgyu mtshan gyis dus gsum gyi ’jog tshul thun mong ma yin pa). 805 Although it seems that Jamgön Kongtrul regards Mikyö Dorjé’s position on these ei ght points to be mostly the same as Shākya Chokden’s (that is, that he rejects seven of the eight points), many present-day Kagyu scholars say that as pedagogi-cal conventions, Mikyö Dorjé agrees with four or five of Tsongkhapa’s eight points. Brunnhölzl states (2004, 559):There is no question that Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé denies that Consequentialists [Prāsaṅgikas] have a philosophical system of their own, let alone unique dis-tinctive features of such a system. However, his explanations so far also clearly show that, when the points in Tsongkhapa’s above lists are understood as mere pedagogic and expedient conventionalities to counteract wrong views from the perspective of others, contrary to what one might expect, the Karmapa in fact agrees with more of these points . . . than he denies. The four or five points that Mikyö Dorjé agrees with (as conventions) are A1, possi-bly A3, A4, B2, and B4. Regarding A2, Mikyö Dorjé agrees that independently verifi-able reasons are not accepted even as conventions from one’s own perspective (i.e., as a Prāsaṅgika), but he does accept their use for others. In his Chariot of the Dakpo Kagyu Siddhas, Mikyö Dorjé refutes that B1 (the acceptance of external objects) is an assertion of the Prāsaṅgika system, and refutes the idea of B3 (disintegration is a functioning thing) completely. (altg) Some Kagyu scholars feel that Mikyö Dorjé does not make a clear statement about A3 (to them, it seems that he accepts reflexive awareness on the level of no analysis), while others say that since he is a Prāsaṅgika he does not accept reflexive awareness even as a convention (because Prāsaṅgikas only cite what is commonly acknowledged in the world as their presentation of conventional reality, and reflex-ive awareness is only posited by philosophical systems). 806 This section is drawn in part from Tāranātha’s Essence of Shentong (gZhan stong sny-ing po), 182.1–.6.

Vasubandhu wrote An Explanation of the “Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras” (Sūtrālaṃkāra-vyākhyā, mDo sde’i rgyan gyi bshad pa); A Commentary on the “Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes” (Madhyāntavibhaṅga-ṭīkā, dBus dang mtha’ rnam par ’byed pa’i ’grel pa); and A Commentary on the “Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature” (Dharmadharmatāvibhaṅga-vṛitti, Chos dang chos nyid rnam par ’byed pa’i ’grel pa). 809 Jamgön Kongtrul makes a similar statement in his Irrepressible Lion’s Roar (8): “The general philosophical tenet system of the definitive-meaning Madhyamaka and three Dharma Treatises of Maitreya were spread widely by many excellent disciple lineages, such as [those originating with] Dignāga and Sthiramati. Because it was difficult for others to fathom, the uncommon [philosophical tenet system of] these [texts of Maitreya] was transmitted orally to supreme disciples, and the texts of the Highest Continuum and Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature were hidden as treasures. Thus, the two Ornaments and the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes were translated and explained by Lotsāwa Pal-tsek (Lo tsā ba dPal brtsegs) and Shang Yeshé Dé (Zhang ye shes sde) during the period of the early spreading [of the dharma].” See also Hookham 1991, 269–70. Sthiramati (Blo gros brtan pa) (ca. 470–550) was one of Vasubandhu’s main stu-dents, who wrote ten texts that are included in the Tengyur, including commentar-ies on the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras, Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature, and works by Vasubandhu. 810 Zu Gawé Dorjé (gZus dga’ ba’i rdo rje) was an eleventh-century translator who stud-ied with the great Kashmiri paṇḍita Sajjana (or Sañjana). He wrote a commentary on the Highest Continuum according to the teachings of Sajjana and an explanation of the Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature. See Irrepressible Lion’s Roar, pp. 8–9; and see also n. 811. 811 Tsen Kawoché (bTsan kha bo che) (b. 1021) was a translator who studied the five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya with the Kashmiri paṇḍita Sajjana (or Sañjana). According to Jamgön Kongtrul’s Irrepressible Lion’s Roar (8–10), Maitrīpa recovered the Highest Continuum and Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature and trans-mitted all five treatises to the paṇḍita Ānandakīrti, who taught them to the Kashmiri paṇḍita Sajjana. When Tsen Kawoché received these teachings from Sajjana, Zu Gawé Dorjé served as the translator. The line of transmission that ensued from Tsen Kawoché and Zu Gawé Dorjé is known as “the meditative tradition of Maitreya’s Dharma Treatises,” and is differentiated from the line of transmission that passed from the paṇḍita Sajjana to Ngok Lotsāwa Loden Sherab (rNgog lo tsā ba blo ldan shes rab), known as “the tradition of hearing and reflection.” The Kagyu and Nyingma traditions have relied more on the meditative tradition of Tsen Kawoché and Zu Gawé Dorjé, whereas the exegetical tradition of Ngok Lotsāwa has been maintained in the Geluk system."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"endnotes c 397 Some of Tsen Kawoché’s teachings were preserved by the Jonang master Kunga Drolchok (Kun dga’ grol mchog) (1507–1566) in his Instructions on the Shentong View (gZhan stong gi lta khrid). Stearns (1999, 88) says, “Tsen Kawoché . . . is often thought to be the first Tibetan to have taught what later came to be known as the Zhentong view.” See Stearns 1999, 42–3 and 88–9; and Roerich 1949, 347–8. 812 Yumo Mikyö Dorjé (Yu mo mi bskyod rdo rje) (b. 1027) was a Kālachakra master and student of the Kashmiri paṇḍita Somanātha (Zla ba mgon po). He is considered a forefather of the Jonang tradition. He wrote a recently recovered set of four texts called The Four Bright Lamps (gSal sgron skor bzhi), which discuss the completion stage practices of the Kālachakra system (the six branches of union). According to Stearns (1999, 44) these texts discuss “some of the same themes that Dolpopa later elaborated,” without using the key terms, such as “empty of other” (gzhan stong). Nevertheless, Tāranātha states that Yumo Mikyö Dorjé “was the founder of the Mantra-Shentong philosophical tenet system” (sngags kyi gzhan stong grub mtha’i srol ka phye) (Requisite Sources for the Dharma Cycle of the Glorious Kālachakra, dPal dus kyi ’khor lo’i chos bskor gyi byung khungs nyer mkho, II:8.2). Stearns also points out (1999, 44) that “the Geluk master Thukan Lozang Chögyi Nyima (1737–1802) much later states in A Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems (Grub mtha’ shel gyi me long) that Yumowa was the originator of the Shentong teach-ings, which he so named, and that they were passed down orally until the time of Dolpopa as a hidden doctrine (lkog pa’i chos) without any written texts.” 813 Rangjung Dorjé (Rang byung rdo rje) (1284–1339) was the third Karmapa and author of many famous works on tathāgatagarbha, Kālachakra Tantra, Dzogchen, and Vajrayāna, including The Profound Inner Reality (Zab mo nang don). For some discus-sion of the differences between Rangjung Dorjé’s Shentong view and Dolpopa’s, see Mathes 2004, 288–94. It is clear from Rangjung Dorjé’s writings that he regarded the systems that developed from Nāgārjuna and Maitreya (which are now being called Rangtong-Madhyamaka and Shentong-Madhyamaka, respectively) to be equal. See a quotation from Rangjung Dorjé in Book Seven, Part Two (TOK, III:24) and Brunnhölzl’s (2007) work on Rangjung Dorjé. 814 Omniscient Drimé Özer (Kun mkhyen dri med ’od zer), also known as Longchen Rabjam (kLong chen rab ’byams) (1308–1364), was one of the greatest Nyingma masters and author of many works, including the Seven Treasuries (mDzod bdun).

For some points on the relationship of Longchenpa’s teachings to Shentong, see Stearns 1999, 51–2. 815 Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (Dol po pa shes rab rgyal mtshan) (1292–1361) is generally considered to be the first to use the terms “Shentong” (gzhan stong) and “Rangtong” (rang stong) extensively.

Additionally, Taranatha was a Kālachakra master, one of the last major Tibetan translators of Vajrayāna texts from Sanskrit, and he wrote a well-known history of Buddhism (History of Buddhism in India, Chimpa and Chat-topadhyaya 1970). For further material relating to Tāranātha’s Shentong views, see Mathes 2000 and 2004; and Hopkins 2007. 818 Shākya Chokden states this perspective in his Great Path of the Nectar of Emptiness (sTong nyid bdud rtsi’i lam po che, hereafter cited as Nectar of Emptiness) (179.2) as follows: To summarize, the view expressed by Asaṅga does not differ in terms of its essence; there are, however, two contexts in which the philosophical tenets [found in the Treatises of Maitreya] are incompatible. The expositions of the thought of the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya state that ultimately there are three yānas, and they do not make any mention of a bhūmi on which the habitual tendency of ignorance is present or that birth can take place through undefiled karma. The expositions of the thought of the Highest Continuum are the opposite.mdor na thogs med zhabs kyis bzhad ba’i lta ba rang gi ngo bo la khyad par med kyang/ grub mtha’i mi mthun pa’i skags gnyis byung ste/ byams pa’i chos dang po rnams kyi dgongs pa ’grel ba na mthar thug gi theg pa gsum yin pa dang/ ma rig bag chags kyi sa dang zag med kyi las kyis skye ba len pa zhes bya ba’i bshad pa mi mdzad la/ rgyud bla ma’i dgongs pa ’grel ba na ni/ snga ma las zlog ste bshad pas so. Note that Shākya Chokden says “the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya,” not “the first three” (byams chos dang po gsum) as Jamgön Kongtrul does. This may indi-cate that Jamgön Kongtrul bases his statement of Shākya Chokden’s position on Tāranātha’s Twenty-one Differences. There Tāranātha says (211.5–212.3) that the second difference between Shākya Chokden and Dolpopa is that Shākya Chokden considers the Ornament of Clear Realization to teach both Rangtong and Shentong tenet systems, and that the remaining four Dharma Treatises of Maitreya teach only Shentong. These four have two [exegetical] modes: (1) The Highest Continuum teaches that ultimately there is one yāna and that a cut-off potential (rigs chad) is refuted. (2) The other three treatises [Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras, Differentia-tion of the Middle and the Extremes, and Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature] teach that ultimately there are three yānas and that there is a cut-off potential. See Mathes 2004, 297; and Hopkins 2007, 121. This is in contrast to Dolpopa’s view that all five Dharma Treatises teach only Shentong (see p. 251 and n. 823). 819 The translation follows PKTC reading ’chad tshul; TOK, II:544.14 has ’char tshul. 820 The Highest Continuum teaches that arhats who have attained nirvāṇa without remainder still have the potential (nus pa) for ignorance, even though they have abandoned ignorance. They are said to dwell on the bhūmi with the habitual ten-dencies of ignorance (ma rig bag chags kyi sa), since they have only abandoned afflicted ignorance but not unafflicted ignorance (see n. 645). The Highest Continuum explains that arhats will enter the Mahāyāna path, and that they do so by taking birth in a mental body through the force of undefiled karma (zag med las kyi skye ba"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"endnotes c 399len pa). This is stated in the Fifth Vajra Point, verse 225. See Fuchs 2000, 209 and Khenpo Tsültrim’s explanation in annotation 26, 344. The Highest Continuum also teaches that bodhisattvas on the impure bhūmis (the first bhūmi through the seventh) dwell on the bhūmi with the habitual tendencies of ignorance and take birth through undefiled karma. The main support (gzhi) for their taking rebirth is their habitual tendencies of ignorance, but that is not the impetus (nus pa) for taking rebirth; they take rebirth through the strength of their previous aspiration prayers (smon lam) and their samādhi. When bodhisattvas reach the three pure bhūmis (the eighth bhūmi through the tenth), they continue to take rebirth through undefiled karma. 821 Reading thos bsam gyis spros pa gcod pa, instead of TOK, II:544.18: thos bsam gyi spros pa gcod pa. 822 Sugatagarbha (“heart of those gone to bliss”) (bde bar gshegs pa’i snying po) is also translated as “buddha nature.” On the meaning of garbha (heart; essence; or seed), Tāranātha says (Essence of Shentong, 187.3) that garbha (snying po) means “what resides within and is hidden” (khong na gnas pa dang sbas pa) and is “unchanging” (mi ’gyur ba). Brunnhölzl says (2004, 865n189), “In its original meaning, the San-skrit term garbha signifies the space within some enclosure or sheath (it also came to mean “embryo,” “seed,” and, later, “essence”). Ruegg states (1995, 167 and 170) that garbha is interpreted in the Indian and Tibetan traditions as seed or embryo, whereas the Sino-Japanese tradition understands it as womb (tsang). 823 This is a paraphrase of Tāranātha’s statement concerning Dolpopa’s view. It is the second point of difference in the Twenty-one Differences (212.2): “The five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya do not contain different tenets at all. The tenets of what is known as Rangtong are not explained even in The Ornament of Clear Realization. The Ornament of the Sūtras and the others do not explain that there is an eternal cut-off potential or that ultimately there are three yānas” (byams chos sde lnga la grub mtha’ so so ba ye med/ rang stong par grags pa’i grub mtha’ mngon rgyan nas kyang ma bshad/ mdo rgyan sogs nas kyang/ gtan nas rigs chad pa dang mthar thug theg gsum ma bshad).

Imagined characteristics do not exist by way of their own characteristics. The nature that they do not have is to be existent by way of their own characteristics. 839 Dependent characteristics do not arise on their own. Thus, the nature they do not have is to come into being in and of themselves, because they arise in dependence on numerous causes and conditions. 840 The consummate nature is the ultimate because it is transmundane primordial wis-dom (’jig rten las ’das pa’i ye shes). It is inherent absence, or non-nature, in that it is the nature that is devoid of percepts and perceivers (yongs su grub pa’i ngo bo nyid de/ de bas na gzung ba dang ’dzin pa med pa’i ngo bo nyid yin pa’i phyir ngo bo nyid med pa’o).

In this last section there are a number of small but sometimes significant differences. I have followed Jamgön Kongtrul because all his changes seem quite deliberate. Note the following differences: TOK, II:549.8: After ngo bo nyid med pas khyab par bzhed cing, three lines of Essence of Shentong (185.4–.7) are omitted. See Hopkins 2007, 89–92. TOK, II:549.11: After ’di ni the following is added: kun rdzob kyi chos de rnams gang dang yang ma ’brel ba ste, “ . . . has no connection to any such conventional phenomena.” TOK, II:549.14: phyogs dus sogs spros pa thams cad dang bral ba’i phyir rang bzhin gyis rtag pa (“ since . . .

Essence of Shentong, 186.2: phyogs dus thams cad dang bral ba/ rang gi ngo bos kun rdzob kyi chos nyid dang ma ’brel ba yin no, “In terms of its very nature, [the consummate nature] does not involve the dharmatā of conventionality.” TOK, II:549.16: chos thams cad kyi chos nyid yin pa’i phyir (“Since it is the dha rmatā of all phenomena . . .”). Essence of Shentong, 186.2: chos nyid kyi chos nyid yin pa’i phyir, “Since it is the dharmatā of dharmatā . . .” Hopkins (2007, 92nc) no tes that the Smanrtsis Shes rig Dpemzod edition reads the same as TOK: chos thams cad kyi chos nyid. 843 The topics connected to the ground are the two truths; those relating to the path are the six pāramitās, five paths, and ten bhūmis; and those related to the result are buddhahood with its three kāyas. The two truths are presented in Book Seven, Part Two; the pāramitās are presented in Chapter 5 of this book; the paths and bhūmis are the topics of Book Nine, Part One; and fruition of Book Ten, Part One. 844 Subsequent state of attainment (pṛiṣhṭhalabdha, rjes thob): see n. 747. 845 Inanimate emptiness (kanthāshūnya, bem stong) means the emptiness or nonexis-tence of matter, a nothingness (ci yang med pa) with no sentience. 846 190.6–192.4. See Hopkins 2007, 102–10. 847 This seems to be a paraphrase of the passage in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra. See ACIP KL0107@136A; and Suzuki 1932, 69. 848 Tīrthikas (“forders”) (mu stegs pa) is a term used for non-Buddhist spiritual practitio-ners in India. Jamgön Kongtrul explains that it means that they remain at the edge (mu) of, or on a rung (stegs) to, liberation; that is, they approach liberation, but they are not on the path to the true nirvāṇa (Book Six, Part One; TOK, II:335). 849 The Fourth Vajra Point, verse 28. The full verse reads: Because the primordial wisdom of buddha[hood] is present in all sentient beings,[because] the stainless nature is nondual,and because the buddha-potential is named after its result,all beings are said to possess the buddha-garbha (heart). sangs rgyas ye shes sems can tshogs zhugs phyir/ rang bzhin dri med de ni gnyis med de/sangs rgyas rigs la de ’bras nyer brtags phyir/ ’gro kun sangs rgyas snying po can du gsungs."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"endnotes c 403 850 “The strength of knowing what is the case and what is not the case” (gnas dang gnas ma yin pa mkhyen pa’i stobs) is one of the ten strengths (stobs bcu), which are part of the dharmakāya’s thirty-two excellent qualities of separation (bral ba’i yon tan). See n. 479. 851 The scriptural traditions of the two great chariot[-systems] (shing rta’i chen po gnyis kyi gzhung lugs) are those of Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga. 852 Nāgārjuna’s system emphasizes from the “outer,” or objective, side, that the ulti-mate nature is emptiness, whereas Maitreya and Asaṅga’s system emphasizes from the “inner,” or subjective, side, that the ultimate nature is nondual primordial wis-dom.

See also n. 700. 859 Abhayākaragupta (’Jigs med ’byung gnas sbas pa) (late eleventh to early twelfth cen-tury) resided at Vikramashīla. His Ornament of Clear Realization commentary is called Moonlight of Key Points (Marmakaumudī, gNad kyi zla ’od). He also wrote over thirty works that are included in the Tengyur and collaborated on the trans-lation of over one hundred texts. Some of his more well-known writings are Ker-nels of Key Instructions (Upadesha-mañjarī, Man ngag snye ma), a commentary on the Sampuṭa-mahātantra (a shared explanatory tantra), and Ornament of the Sage’s Thought (Munimatālaṃkāra, Thub pa’i dgongs pa’i rgyan), an encyclopedic work on Mahāyāna Buddhism. See Ruegg 1981, 114-5. 860 Dharmapāla (Chos skyong) (530–561) was a Yogāchāra master who resided at Nālandā. Tāranātha states (Chimpa and Chattopadhyaya 1970, 213) that he was a student of Dignāga, whereas modern scholars believe “he may have been a grand-pupil of Dignāga” (see Tillemans 1990, 8). In addition to his commentaries on the works of Vasubandhu and Dignāga, his major contributions are his defense of the Yogāchāra positions in his commentary on Āryadeva’s Four Hundred Verses (Chap-ter 10), written in response to Bhāvaviveka’s Lamp of Wisdom, and his influence on the Chinese scholar Hsüan-Tsang’s work on Yogāchāra, Chéng wéi shí lùn. None of Dharmapāla’s works were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan but they are preserved in Chinese translations (however his commentary on Ornament of Clear Realization does not seem to have been translated into Chinese). See Tillemans 1990, 8–13; and Brunnhölzl 2004, 492–4."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"404 C the treasury of knowledge 861 Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way, Chapter 24, verse 18. Note the following differences: Dg.T. Beijing is: de ni brten nas gdags pa ste/ de nyid dbu ma’i lam yin no; TOK, II:554.16: de ni brten nas brtags pa ste/ de ni dbu ma’i lam yin no. 862 Chapter 1, verse 2cd. See above n. 832. 863 Chapter 11, verse 55ab. 864 The translation follows TOK, II:555.6 reading dbang tha ma’i lta bar bshad pa’i phyir (“a view for those of lesser acumen”); Nectar of Emptiness (174.4) has dbang za ba’i lta bar bshad pa’i phyir (“a pretentious view”). This is probably a deliberate change by Jamgön Kongtrul, not a spelling mistake. (altg) 865 TOK, II:555.7: des don should be nges don. (See Nectar of Emptiness, 174.5.) 866 Jamgön Kongtrul refers to the source of this quotation as Establishing the Unity of the Two Modes (Tshul gnyis gcig sgrub). Since this citation is found verbatim in Shākya Chokden’s Establishing the Unity of the Definitive Meaning (585.4–589.1), obviously “Establishing the Unity” (gcig sgrub) refers to that text. Tāranātha wrote a text called Entry to the Definitive Meaning: Distinguishing the Two Modes (Tshul gnyis rnam par ’byed pa nges pa’i don gyi ’jug ngogs), which sets out the differences between the Rangtong and Shentong systems. The text begins by distinguishing how Rangtong and Shentong proponents regard the Yogāchāra scriptural system. There Tāranātha refers to the Yogāchāra scriptural system as that of the Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins), which for Shentong proponents is not synonymous with Chittamātras (as Tāranātha explains). Thus, I take “Two Modes” (tshul gnyis) as referring to this work by Tāranātha. (For another citation where Tāranātha uses the term Vijñapti[vādins] in connection with Shentong and Madhyamaka, see n. 630.) On the other hand, it could be that Establishing the Unity of the Two Modes should be Establishing the Unity of the Two Traditions (Srol gnyis gcig bsgrub), which may be an alternative short title for Shākya Chokden’s work derived from its full title: An Extensive Commentary on the Treatise Establishing the Unity of the Definitive Meaning Through the Explanation of the Distinction Between the Two Traditions of the Great Charioteers (Shing rta chen po’i srol gnyis kyi rnam par dbye ba bshad nas nges don gcig tu bsgrub pa’i bstan bcos kyi rgyas ’grel). In that case, the translation should read, “. . . as is discussed in detail in the Establishing the Unity of the Two Modes.” 867 Chapter 5, verse 19ab. Note that the first line should read chos kyi dbyings ni ma gtogs pa’i; TOK, II:556.10: chos kyi dbyings las ma gtogs pa’i. 868 This quotation is found in the Compendium of the Mahāyāna. See Dg.T. Beijing 76:7; and Keenan 1992, 15. See n. 527. 869 Part One, Chapter 8, verse 41cd. 870 This quotation is almost identical to lines in the Vajrapañjarā (rDo rje gur), Chapter 6: “Outside of the precious mind, there are no buddhas and no persons” (rin chen sems las phyir gyur pa’i/ sang rgyas med cing gang zag med) (Dg.K. 419, f. 44.4). TOK, II:556.13: rin chen sems las phyir gyur pa’i/ sang rgyas med cing sems can med. 871 The Sūtra on Ultimate Emptiness (Paramārthashūnyatā-sūtra, Don dam pa stong nyid kyi mdo) is not found in the Kangyur, but there are two sūtras with similar names: Great Sūtra on Emptiness (Shūnyatā-nāma-mahāsūtra, mDo chen po stong pa nyid) (Toh. 290) and Great Sūtra on Great Emptiness (Mahāshūnyatā-nāma-mahāsūtra, mDo chen po stong pa nyid chen po) (Toh. 291).

These practices are discussed in other sections of the Treasury of Knowledge, for example, Kongtrul 2005, 98, 240–2, and passim; and Book Eight, Part Three (TOK, III:275–464).
