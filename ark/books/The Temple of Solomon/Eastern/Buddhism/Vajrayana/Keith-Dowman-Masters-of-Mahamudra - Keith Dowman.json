The eighty-four masters of Mahamudra were the original founding fathers of the Mahamudra tradition who formulated its techniques of meditation, and also the founders' lineal successors who practiced those tech-niques. They all attained the realization of Buddhahood. These masters were called mahasiddhas-Great Attainers-and they lived in India between the eighth and twelfth centuries. At the core of this work on the masters of Mahamudra is an adap-tation of the Tibetan text called Legends of the Eightyjour Mahasiddhas (Grub thob brgyad bcu tsa bzhz''z' lo rgyus), and this text can be appreciated on three levels. Firstly, the legends of the historically pre-eminent siddhas-Nagarjuna, Saraha, Liiipa, Viriipa, to name a few-are stories of magical power and knowledge. These exemplify the astonishing and entertaining didac-tic stories belonging to the Buddhist lineages of Indian Tantra transmitted by Guru to disciple down the centuries. Secondly, most of the legends can be perceived as allegories in which every anecdote is an analogy and every act a metaphor composed to instruct the tantric initiate in his or her life-praxis and meditation. Some of the short lesser known siddhas' legends consist only of basic biographical information and meditation instruction shorn of the hermetical sheath of allegory. Thirdly, since the legends were written down shortly after the death of the last of the eighty-four, there is history to be sieved from them, despite the orthographical depredations of scribes and wood-block carvers. Thus we have eighty-four authentic tantric legends, eighty-four paradigms of tantric meditation tech-nique, and eighty-four personalities, some historical, some ar-chetypal, who lived in India between the eighth and twelfth cen-turies."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii Masters of Mahiimudrii The eighty-four chapter headings are the names of the siddhas of the legends. The first component of the material under each title is one or two stanzas of the italicized \"song of realization\" translated from a short Tibetan text called Vajra Songs: The Heart Realiza-tions of the Eightyjour Mahiist\"ddhas (Grub thob brgyad bcu rtogs pa 't\" snying po rdo rje 'i glu) compiled by a scholar named Vira Prakasa. These songs reveal the nature of the siddhas' realization and the path that they traversed to reach it, all couched in the for-mal imagery and technical terminology of the Mahamudra tradi-tion. Beneath this verse, in twelve point type, is the legend itself. The legends have been adapted from the stilted mnemonic style of the Tibetan manuscript to give a fluent idiomatic rendering into English while maintaining fidelity to the original meaning. At the heart of the legend is the siddha's meditation instruction (upade§a) in verse. These italicized verses are free translations rendered with the special care and attention given them in the oral transmission that the lineage-Lamas insisted upon. The legends were narrated by an Indian scholar, or paru;Uta, Abhayadatta Sri, to a Tibetan monk, Mondup Sherab, probably in the twelfth century. The identity of these principals and the editions of their texts are discussed in Ap-pendix I. The introduction to this work is also an introduction to the Bud-dhist Tantra, which reaches its climax in Mahiimudra. This background should give the reader insight into the context and tech-niques of Mahamudra meditation and also into the concepts and terminology of the meditation instruction in the legends. The first part of the commentary that fo1lows each legend, like the introduc-tion, is written primarily for those readers interested in the legends as paradigms of meditation technique, and accordingly it has been entitled Sadhana, which means \"the endeavour and method of in-tentional existential praxis\" (see Glossary). The material for this section, which dwells mainly upon the definitions of words and on the meanings in the instruction, was compiled from a variety of sources: from the oral transmission of the Tibetan texts of The Legends by the Nyingma scholar Bhaga Tulku, the incarnate Lama of a monastery in Arunachal Pradesh, India; from elucidation of the text by Taklung Tsetul Rimpoche, and by the lay scholar Se Kusho Chomphel Namgyel; from the oral transmission of similar medita-tion practices, specifically Mahamudra instruction from the late Gyelwa Karmapa and other Kahgyu Lamas, the creative and fulfill-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Preface xiii ment stages of meditation taught within the Nyingma school, and Dzokchen instruction (the Nyingma equivalent of Mahamudra); from reading the root-tantras of the siddhas' lineages-particularly the Sa1Jtvara, Guhysamiija, Hevajra and Cap,(lamahiiro~ap,a tantras, the meditation liturgies (siidhanas) of Vajra Yogini in many of her forms, and the dohii songs of the siddhas. But no amount of oral and literary transmission, academic study and analysis, can simulate the effects of meditation practice, least of all tantric meditation that is taught eliptically and on many levels simultaneously. Authority to practice (T. lung), initiation into the map,(lala (dbang bskur), and transmission of practical techniques of meditation (khrid), are only the initial stages of learning the essential preliminaries, wherein a vision is developed. The work of identifying and actuating the psychic realities that are indicated by the complex inter-related sym-bolism of the iconography of a deity, for example, and realizing ex-perientially the various states of awareness evoked in the poetry of the tantras and their sadhanas, can only be done through medita-tion in the laboratory of the mind under optimal conditions-ideally a mountain hermitage. Thus the commentary reflects experience in a tradition of meditation similar to the siddhas' tradition gained by the commentator during twelve years of practice. Western initiates seeking an understanding of the nature of mind through the medium of Tantra are not usually hampered by prob-lems of motivation or capacity to meditate. Rather, misinterpreta-tion of symbological meaning and iconography and failure to penetrate the true significance of terminology, ideas and con-cepts-problems in the realm of hermeneutics-probably form their biggest obstacle. Thus study of literal translations of tantric texts without commentaries in a language that has personal meaning for the student, or without oral transmission from a teacher who has gained realization of the goal of the Tantra through the techniques described, is counter-productive if not a real danger to sanity. Justification for interpretive commentary, and indeed interpretive translation, is found in Tibet and China during the early periods of transmission of the doctrine, when the essential formulae of Tantra were re-stated in the cultural idioms of those countries. With such successful precedents in mind, the language of the introduction to this work, and of the commentary, sometimes introduces western concepts quite alien to traditionalist Tibetan scholars. For example, readers familiar with homeopathy can gain insight into the methods"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv Masters of Mahamudra of Tantra through the theory epitomized in the Latin dictum sz'milz'a st'milz'bus curantor, with its connotations of \"the poison is the panacea\" and \"the smaller the dose the higher the potency.\" Again the phrase cot'tus interruptus is effective insofar as it is familiar to the western ear, its experientially assimilated connotations evoking a notion very close to that intended in the relevant tantric meditation. As a final example, the images of adepts walking through walls, fly-ing in the sky and eating rock, and so on, so familiar to the eastern mind, but ridiculed by western rationalists, are best discussed in the context of \"mind over matter\" {when they are not understood analogically). Although in eastern Buddhist thought mind is not conventionally opposed to matter, the efficacy of such a concept justifies its use. Further, why should the western aspirant become burdened by eastern concepts and thought patterns when he already possesses adequate conceptual baggage, which anyway he must detach himself from, if not eradicate, along the path? Thus, although the basic doctrinal formulae in the commentaries are those transmitted for twelve hundred years and more, the commentary herein reflects personal experience in a language comprehensible to the intelligent lay reader. After Sadhana, under the heading Historiography, all the material relevant to the task of establishing the historical identity of the siddha, his place in a lineage, and the period of his existence, has been gathered together. Concerning the more prominent sid-dhas, legends and anecdotes from other sources have been included to elucidate these identity problems, but limitations of space have kept legends from other sources and discussion of conflicting arguments and alternative theories to a minimum. Where no reference to a siddha exists outside our legend the only point of discussion is his or her name. The siddhas' names used throughout are those Sanskrit forms confirmed by etymological analysis, and these have replaced Apabhratp~a and Tibetan forms together with numerous corrupt forms found in the various editions of The Legends and other Tibetan sources, but these have been selectively listed in this commentary. In general, despite the multiplicity of names, paucity of historiographically valid material has allowed only partial success in solving the multitude of historical problems relating to the siddhas and their times. Discovery of new sources, besides an exhaustive scrutiny and re-evaluation of known Tibetan sources, is essential before the lineage tree (p. 390-1) can be a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preface xv definitive indicator of the siddhas' lifetimes and their lineal relation-ships. The Tibetan sources that have provided the lineal informa-tion are discussed in Appendix I. The siddhas' epithets given in the eighty-four chapter headings as a mnemonic aid are translations of their names, or descriptive epithets sometimes based on a false etymology found in the legend itself, or they have been borrowed from other Tibetan sources. The suffix pa in the siddhas' names is at once the contraction of Sanskrit piida (T. zhabs), an honorific form applied to saints and siddhas, and the Tibetan masculine denominator. To indicate that a siddha's status is derived mainly from the exemplary sadhana at-tached to his name and not from his place in a lineage, the title Mahasiddha becomes merely Siddha. The feminine form of mahiisiddha is mahiisiddhii, of siddha siddhii, details that were not rendered into Tibetan. The Glossary of Sanskrit Terms defines the italicized Sanskrit words found throughout the text. Words used only once in paren-thesis have not been glossed. Since the siddhas spoke sanskritic languages-Prakrit or an Apabhraip~a dialect-Sanskrit has been the preferred language of technical terminology. But since Tibetan is the language in which the legends have come down to us, while Sanskrit forms have been used in the text, in the notes both Sanskrit and Tibetan, or sometimes only Tibetan forms, are given according to their relevance. To locate the definitions of Sanskrit and Tibetan words omitted from the glossary, the index will direct the enquirer to the note where the principal definition is found, or through the note to the place in the text to which the note refers. The transliteration of Tibetan words rendered phonetically in the text can be found in the index. Wherever they occur, transliterated Tibetan words are indicated by T. in a single entry, and in the first instance of a series of Tibetan definitions. The numbers in italics in parenthesis after a siddha's name refer to the number of his legend. To assist in easy reference a Glossary of Numeral Terms, the irksome mnemonical phrases that appear so frequently in Buddhist literature-which do, however, carry a numerological value-has been included with Tibetan and Sanskrit equivalents where ap-propriate. Line-drawings of twenty of the siddhas have been provided by Hugh R. Downs. The inspiration for these original drawings was derived from examples and descriptions in his private collection of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi Masters of Mahamudra traditional art and related literature. There are standard iconographies in Tibetan art representing the various styles of enlightened human beings-yogins, scholars, monks, (bhik~us) and so forth. Traditionally, when searching for models, an artist would consult his iconographic examples, literary descriptions and his own notes, and then his creation though based on a traditional model would none the less be an original expression to fulfill a specific pur· pose. Since far greater latitude is permitted in rendering historical figures than in representing precise metaphysical principles in iconography, a subtle progressive modification of siddha images has occurred. For this reason, and due to the conscious alteration of par· ticular images to suit the needs of specific lineages, and, of course, simple error, we possess a wide variety of depictions of the eighty· four mahasiddhas. It is the responsibility of the artist to sift through this material and find the ideal for the moment and the need. Hugh R. Downs undertook a traditional apprenticeship in Tibetan draw· ing and painting under the guidance of his Guru, the Sherpa yogin Au Leshe, an experience he describes in his photographic and Jiterary essay Rhythms of a Himalayan Village.1 His representations show most vividly the power and force of the siddhas' manner of be-ing, while stressing both the ascetic element in their paths to enlightenment and the esthetic and sensual refinement of their life-styles. The captions below the illustrations are derived from a series of Tibetan line-drawings of unknown provenance that were amongst those used by the artist as models.

At the beginning of the eighth century, when Arab power was supreme from Morocco to Sindh, in India the numerous inheritors of imperial Gupta glory were engaged in internecine conflicts, and Indian culture was in a state of decay. The old dispensation was vitiated, society taking refuge in inflexible caste rules and regulations; and as form and pro-cedure governed social life, so ritual dominated religion and scholasticism the academies. There was no vital, united society to meet the threat of the fanatical Islamic armies who wreaked burn-ing, pillage and massacre, and who were a new kind of enemy, com-pelling Islam or the sword. As a stream of Buddhist refugees brought tales of the destruction of Buddhist Central Asia to India, Tantra was increasing its influence, particularly in O<;l<;liya\\).a, the front-line state, and also in eastern India, where a new power, the Buddhist Pala Dynasty, was emerging. Was it coincidence that In-dia took refuge in Tantra with its uncompromising non-dualist metaphysics, its school of spontaneous liberation, and its fierce flesh-eating, blood-drinking deities, during a period of incipient doom? Is it a further coincidence that, after rejecting Tantra for centuries, the West finds it increasingly acceptable as the notion of mankind's extinction become credible? Nearly four centuries passed between AD 711, when Sindh (S. Pakistan) was conquered, ·and the end of the twelfth century when the Buddha's Tree of Enlightenment was finally desecrated by Turkish soldiers. Some critics maintain that the final blossoming of pure Hindu civilization between the eighth and twelfth century was the most magnificent achievement of India's cultural history. Dur-ing that period Tibet embraced Buddhist Tantra and the main part"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2 Masters of Mahii.mudrii. of the Buddhist tantric canon was translated into the Tibetan language, thus saving it from incineration in the great Indian libraries. Java was colonized and the great stupa at Borobodur was built. Although most of the artistic achievement at home was destroyed by the Muslims, the scripture of the Pala Empire (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam), the ruins of the great academies built by the Pala Emperors, and the temples of Khajuraho, bear witness to the genius of tantric art. \"Tantra\" describes the ethos of Indian culture of this time;2 the men who embodied that ethos and the aims and ideals of the culture, the generators and directors of the creative energy that converted the people and transformed society, the guides and exemplars on the path of Tantra, these men were called siddhas. The eighty-four siddhas, whose lives and practices are described in these legends, were the siddhas who practiced the Bud-dhist Tantra, as opposed to the Tantra of devotees of Siva (sazvas) or the Tantra of the worshippers of the Great Mother (siiktas). The number eighty-four is a \"whole\" or \"perfect\" number. Thus the eighty-four siddhas can be seen as archetypes representing the thousands of exemplars and adepts of the tantric way. The siddhas were remarkable for the diversity of their family backgrounds and the dissimilarity of their social roles. They were found in every reach of the social structure: kings and ministers, priests and yogins, poets and musicians, craftsmen and farmers, housewives and whores. However, the greatest names amongst the eighty-four-Tilopa, Naropa, Saraha, Luipa, GhaJ).~apa, I;>ombipa, etc., -were sadhu siddhas, mendicant yogins living with the people on a grass-roots level of society, teaching more by psychic vibration, posture and at-titude-mantra, mudrii and tantra8-than by sermonizing. Some of these siddhas were iconoclasts, dissenters and anti-establishment rebels fulfilling the necessary function of destroying the rigidity of old and intractable customs and habits, so that spontaneity and new vitality could flourish. Obsessive caste rules and regulations in socie-ty, and religious ritual as an end in itself, were undermined by the siddhas' exemplary free-living. The irrelevance of scholastic hair-splitting in an academic language, together with a host of social and religious evils, were exposed in the poets' wonderful mystical songs written in the vernacular tongues. They taught existential involve-ment rather than metaphysical speculation, and they taught the ideal of living in the world but not of it rather than ascetic self-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 mutilation or monastic renunciation. The siddhas are characterized by a lack of external uniformity and formal discipline. Under the generous patronage of the Pala Emperors in the eastern Indian empire, where the majority of the siddhas lived, the revolution became the establishment. The great academies of VikramaSila and Somapuri were built, and the ancient monastic establishment at Nalanda was extensively enlarged. The militancy of the siddha-poets decrying empty ritualism, charlatanism, specious philosophizing, scholasticism, hypocrisy and the caste system, 4 is less apparent during Naropa's period in the eleventh cen-tury. The attitudes and precepts ofTantra became more socially ac-ceptable after generations of siddhas in positions of temporal power had influenced people and events on many levels. From the begin-ning, Tantra's flexibility permitted initiates like Lilapa to retain their secular status, wealth and pleasure, and this principle of tolerance and inclusiveness was a significant factor in the appeal of the doctrine; as the millennium approached the increasing hedonism could be used as a path to spiritual liberation. However, the ideal of spiritual anarchism, the attitude that precluded attachment to religious forms, prevailed, and in its esoteric, yogic form, Tantra re-mained the preserve of initiates into the lineage, and no institu-tionalism compromised their spirit of existential freedom. Tantra took centuries to come out if its closet. Its history up to the era of the siddhas ca~ only be conjecture, but it appears that originally, in the guise of fertility cults, it belonged to the pre-Aryan, tribal worshippers of the Mother Goddess, and later, also, to the low castes and out-castes of Hindu society. A corpus of sym-pathetic and imitative magic for a variety of mundane purposes such as healing became part of the various tantric cults. Then over the centuries, as they became \"sanskritized\" and more sophisticated, these cults assimilated brahmanical deities, their rituals and the principles of mantra. Later still, Upanishadic philosophy, Patafijali's Yoga-sutras and principles of mahayana Buddhist philosophy were assimilated, and a crucial transformation was ac-complished-a body of ritual magic became a soteriological system with liberation from human suffering as its aim. Whether the KiipiiHkas, or a similar sect of primitive saz'va Tantra, or heretical Buddhist monks, formed the first lineage of Tantra as we know it, is not known, but in the fourth or fifth century, a need arose for order"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4 Masters of Mahamudra and consistency in the system, and this could only be achieved by committing to palm leaf manuscript what until then had been pure-ly oral transmission. The Maiijusrimillakalpa5 contained a body of mahayana lore and also the basic father-tantra ma~c;lala of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; but the Guhyasamiija-tantra6 is considered to be the first of the root-tantras describing yoga techniques as well as the ma~c;lalas, mantras and rites associated with the propitiation of a particular deity and his retinue, in this case Guhyasamaja. This tantra was probably compiled in the sixth or seventh century, not reaching its final form until Indrabhuti \"revealed\" it in the eighth century. The eighth and ninth centuries saw the revelation of most of the major tantras, particularly the mother-tantras, incorporating many elements from the siikta, Goddess-worshipping cults. When the scriptural tantras were written down, Tantra could no longer be kept secret. There were many reasons for secrecy, perhaps the most important being the need to avoid the hostile propaganda of brahmin orthodoxy. One of Tantra's appeals was its catholic tolerance in initiating members of all castes and both sexes, a prac-tice that militated against the priestly supremacy of the brahmins. Practices such as meat-eating, drinking liquor, and in some siikta-influenced tantras, sexual intercourse between untouchables and twice-born initiates, were abhorrent to the brahmins. One of the achievements of the siddhas was to make Buddhist Tantra socially acceptable, but although the exoteric forms of Tantra comprised the religion of the masses, the orthodox have retained their hostility until this day. In the same way that Buddhism had attracted India's greatest minds to its past forms, amongst the siddhas were men with the ability to write great commentaries on the tantras, in the process interpreting ambiguity in terms consistent with mahayana ethics and principles, excising all traces of gross practices that carried a stigma. Before describing the yogas and the teaching of these spiritual adventurers and multi-facetted adepts called siddhas, it will be helpful to define several Sanskrit words that remain untranslated throughout the work, words that have no English equivalents. The first word is siddha itself. Literally a siddha is a practitioner of Tan-tra who is successful in attaining the goal of his meditation. This achievement is known as siddht'. Siddht' is two-fold: magical power (mundane), and the Buddha's enlightenment (ultimate).7 Thus sid-dha could be rendered \"saint,\" \"magus,\" \"magician,\" \"adept;\" but"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 these words are feeble, failing to evoke the originality of the siddhas' tantric life-style. For the uninitiated Indian the word siddha evokes magical power above all; if a yogin can walk through walls, fly in the sky, heal the sick, turn water into wine, or even levitate and read minds, he deserves the title siddha. If that same yogin has a crazy glint in his eye, smears himself with ashes, moves himself or others to tears with his song, calms street mongrels by his presence, tears a faithful woman from her family, wears a vajra-a symbol of im-mutability-in his yard-long hair-knot, eats from a skull-bowl, talks with the birds, sleeps with lepers, upbraids demagogues for moral laxity, or performs with conviction any act contrary to convention while demonstrating a \"higher\" reality, then he is doubly a siddha. Common people impressed by appearances have no conception of the siddha's esoteric aim-Mahamudra-and cannot know that a siddha may also be an inconspicuous peasant, an office worker, a king, a monk, a servant or a tramp. The Sanskrit word sadhana can be translated as \"spiritual discipline.\" It can also be rendered \"psycho-experimental tech-niques of personality transcendence and ecstasy,\" or \"the activity of an integrated body, speech and mind motivated by the Bodhisattva Vow.\" More specifically, sadhana is \"the yogin's practice of his Guru's precepts,\" or \"an initiate's meditation liturgy.\" Obviously, then, sadhana is a vital concept for a tantrika (a practitioner of Tan-tra). In fact, sadhana is his whole life, and to the degree that his life is not integrated into his sadhana he breaks the pledge he swore at the time of his initiation, which was based on his intention to selflessly devote his entire being to the non-dual, gnostic enlighten-ment experience and to others. The Tibetan form of the word sadhana (T. sgrub thabs) simply means \"the method of ac-complishing [success).\" The forms of the mahasiddhas' sadhanas are as varied as their personalities, although in the limited sense of sadhana most of their meditation techniques belong to what is known as the creative and fulfillment modes of meditation. 8 The invariable goal of these siddhas' sadhanas is mahiimudrii-siddhi. Siddhz'has already been defined as \"power,\" and power is of two types: mundane and ultimate, ordinary and supreme. The lat-ter is synonymous with mahiimudrii-sz'ddhi, which is nothing less than the Buddha's enlightenment. The easiest way of dealing with the vague and overworked word \"enlightenment\" is to define it as the attainment of the ultimate mystical experience of the oneness of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6 Masters of Mahamudra all things, the non-dual cognition of ultimate reality, clear light, gnostic awareness-the dissolution of the individuated personality in the universal mind. The Buddha's enlightenment is specifically defined as coincident with a vast, empathetic, self-sacrificial, social sensibility-love, in fact. That is mahiimudrii-st'ddht'. The mahayana explains \"Buddha\" in terms of three \"bodies\" or rather three modes of being: being as empty space and awareness, being as instructive visionary enjoyment, and being as compassionate appari-tion; a fourth mode of being is spontaneous being, integrating the other three, and this can be called Mahamudra-the Great Seal, Magnificent Symbol, Sublime Stance, Absolute Reality. While the term Mahamudra is usually found embedded in highly abstruse metaphysical jargon, in the mother-tantra it is synonymous with an essential symbol for ultimate reality, the vulva, and it is useful to bear that meaning in mind. Mahiimudrii-siddhiis invariably accom-panied by mundane siddhi, though not vice versa, and mundane siddhi is conventionally defined as attainment of the eight great sid-dhis, the six extra-sensory powers and the four transformative modes of action.9 The great powers, are enumerated differently in the various traditions, sometimes as seven, sometimes as eight. The siddhis that Nagabodhi attained from Nagarjuna in these legends were the power to pass through matter, power to wield the enchanted sword of awareness, the powers of creation and annihilation (materializa-tion and de-materialization), the powers to dispense the pill of third-eye vision and the eye-salve of omniscience, the power of speed-walking, and power to perform the alchemy of immortality. The language of this list may be interpreted literally or figuratively, ac-cording to faith and understanding. Thus the power to walk through walls can be explained literally as a siddha's magical feat to induce faith in the credulous, or figuratively to demonstrate, £orin-stance, the nature of reality as a dream, an illusion, an hallucina-tion, where all things are experienced as light and space. All these sz'ddhis must be understood in the light of the basic precept \"all is mind;\" for the siddha there is no body/mind, matter/spirit duality. Lastly, what makes these sz'ddht's great is their use as technical aids to mahiimudrii-siddhz' in sadhana, though it is stretching a point to include the Lama's vaunted power of speed-walking in the above list."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 The six extra-sensory powers are mental powers of the same order as the great siddhis but they are couched in psychological ter-minology. Thought reading and memory of past lives need no ex-planation; clairaudience is \"the divine ear\" by which all languages including those of birds and animals can be understood, from near and far; clairvoyance, \"the divine eye,\" as astral vision, especially implying intuition of another's suffering; ability to perform miracles includes manipulation of the elements, flight, and walking on water, and so on; finally, ability to arrest and extinguish emotivity, which leads to nirvana. These, again, are all powers that can be us-ed to expedite mahiimudrii-siddhi for oneself or others. Fleeting knowledge of such powers as clairaudience and thought-reading is accessible to beginners in concentration meditation, for instance; but to evoke such powers at will during post-meditation experience, however, is an actual sign of success in sadhana. The transformative modes of action-pacification, enrichment, control and destruction-employ the eight great siddhis, the extrasensory powers and every possible skillful means to calm the mind, one's own or another's, endow it with enriching qualities, control or manipulate it for beneficial purpose, or eliminate it. The means of effecting these four techniques of altering consciousness should arise spontaneously out of a siddha's realization, for he is powerless if action depends upon discursive thought. The im-mediate intuition and accomplishment of these four modes are represented by four I;>akinis, who must be propitiated. Sa1]'tsiira has herein usually been left untranslated. \"Wheel of life,\" \"round of rebirth,\" \"cycle of confusion,\" \"transmigratory ex-istence,\" are succinct phrases that are adequate, but poor in con-notation. Exoterically, saiJlsara is the frustrating cycle of rebirth through the human realm, heaven and hell, and the animal and spirit realms, determined by one's own previous actions, or karma. Esoterically, saiJlsara is the whirligig of mind, toned by various and successive complex emotional states, conditioned by thought, described in terms of the penetrating psychology of the six realms. In psychological terms, saiJlsara is \"anxiety,\" which all will admit to more or less, although only acute anxiety is recognized as a state that should be treated-by a priest, a psychiatrist, or an analyst.

Whether viewed in terms of transmigration, the unsatisfactory human condition, anxiety or neurosis, sa1psara is what all people sometimes, and some people always, wish to escape. Buddhism is primarily concerned with techniques of escape from sa1psara to nirva:Q.a; where the word \"release\" or \"liberation\" is used in a Bud· dhist context, it always refers to release from sa1psara. The siddhas developed their own methods of release, which can be characterized as quick, democratic, demanding and dangerous. And nirva'{la.'l Nirva~a is a continuum of emptiness.10 The literal meaning of the word Tantra is rarely implied in com· mon usage. It means \"thread,\" \"continuity\" or \"warp and woof.\" It refers to the one essential, immutable and continuous element in life, and that is emptiness or \"such-ness,\"11 the ultimate, indeter-minate, existential reality inherent in ordinary consciousness. \"Tan-tra\" is used herein to indicate the ethos of a way of life determined by a body of practices described in a canon of texts which themselves are called tantras. Since only the self-evident and sensational elements of Tantra-ritualism, sex and magic-are widely known, the common associations of the term are unbalanced . and misleading. Of the four classes of Buddhist Tantra (there is no space here to deal with the similar but different Hindu Tantra), 12 the two lower levels are predominantly ritualistic and to a large extent con-cerned with attainment of temporal goals and magical powers. The higher levels of Tantra do involve ritual meditation, but in the supreme Tantra (anuttarayoga-tantra,) which leads to mahamudra-siddht', ritualism per se is rejected. The eighty-four paradigms of tantric practice given in these legends describe non· ritualistic meditation. Although sex is renounced in orthodox Bud-dhism, in Tantra it is accepted as a valid means by which Mahamudra can be attained. The delusion that all tantric yoga is sexual yoga is fostered by the tantras' frequent use of sexual analogy, metaphor and symbol to describe psychic processes. To understand the metaphysical content of the siddhas' teaching it is useful to look at the scriptural tantras. All tantric literature is based upon what are known as the root-tantras. Each of these texts deals with practices associated with a particular deity. Thus the deities Guhyasamaja, Cakrasa1pvara, Hevajra, Mahamaya and Yamari, as the most important deities associated with the siddhas,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"IntroducUon 9 each pertain to a root-tantra that describes a maQ.gala in terms of a divine entourage of psychic powers that comprise the Guru's mind, the creative and ·fulfillment modes of meditation, subsidiary rites (fire sacrifice, extensive feasts and offerings), detailed description of symbology and ingredients for symbolic offerings, and other sections specific to the individual tantra.13 Lack of definitions and explana-tions necessitated the vast commentarial literature that grew up subsequently. But the root~tantras and their commentaries are prac-tical manuals, and nowhere do we find a structured metaphysical model of mind and the universe, or an analysis of the soteriological functions of tantra-yoga. Metaphysical definitions must be deduced from the tantras' symbology and maQ.galas, and so on. In a non-dual philosophy absolute reality is everydayexperience, which is unutterable: thus the siddhas' disdain of speculative metaphysics. Nevertheless, this ineffable absolute, represented as yantras, mart{lalas and deities, was their obsession, and the dynamo generating superhuman power, energy and realization. They had no concept of it and no knowledge of it; it cannot be conceived and the temporal mind cannot comprehend it. It is indefinable, indeter-minable and without location.14 Tathatii is perhaps the most evocative word for it. It means \"that-ness\" or \"such-ness,\" \"the ab-solute specific,\" the universe in a grain of sand. It is the ungraspable essence that our poets and musicians have sought, and their intui-tion of it makes them western tantrikas. It has no cause and no root, and is therefore said to be \"unborn\" or \"pure potential. \"15 It is the cosmic totality and a sesame seed; a seed or an egg is often used to symbolize it.16 But anything that is said about it is simply poetry-with a connotation of self-indulgence-or it is for didactic purposes, calculated to make an aspirant recognize it. Most people . only experience a flash of it or a vague intimation. Since reality is ut-terly indeterminable, there is no truth in any concept of absolute truth whatsoever, 17 and the relative ph~nomena that are inseparable from it are a lie, until they are recognized as reality (see 19). Paradoxes appear constantly in the tantras. They function as Zen koans, concepts used to destroy all conceptual thought. Conceptual knowledge is one of the twin veils that occlude reality; whereas paradox is the most apposite expression of it. One statement of the paradox that is only resolved existentially appears constantly in the siddhas' songs of realization (at the head of each legend). If the sid-dhas' experience is a continuum of space, if all things are emptiness"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"10 Masters of Mahamudra (Sunyatti), if there is only clear light, where are sensual objects, the material universe? This paradox is answered by the single most im-portant formula in mahayana metaphysics, \"emptiness is form and form is emptiness.\"18 Emptiness is nothing if not form, and the ab· solute specific is certainly not nothing; when all things dissolve into space and are seen as space, substance remains as a rainbow, or bet-ter, as a hologram. The very attractive mahayana proposition that nothing exists outside the sensual and mental realms, affirms that absolute reality is to be found within the common light of day, that emptiness t's form. Constant peak experience of the absolute specific implies non-dual perception, union of subject/object, knower/known, self/other. This ultimate tantric mystery is Mahamudra, and the sexual analogy of lovers achieving a sense of complete oneness while still in their own separate bodies is probably the best, if not the only, image capable of expressing this paradox-ical mystery. Attainment of this union in Mahamudra, entails elimination of the barriers between oneself and other people. Suddenly the social field opens up as the siddha empathizes totally with his fellow be· ings, and since he has attained the powers of mind-reading and pre-science (as a direct result of uniting self and other) he is capable of guiding them in their sadhanas. And also, simultaneously with the attainment of the ultimate mystical experience, the siddha is im-bued with compassion (\"suffering together\"), and automatically he acts spontaneously to fulfill the Bodhisattva Vow, which is the com· mitment to serve others without prejudice in whatever way necessary. Loving kindness, sympathetic joy, compassion and equanimity, the four boundless states of mind, constitute a preparatory meditation that cultivates the feeling of oneness with all beings; the Mahamudra union generates these social virtues, and feelings such as love induce that union. The siddhas of the legends were renowned for their spontaneous effusion of emotion, whether it was for a beautiful woman or a starving puppy, and the songs19 of the siddhtictiryas are full of profound sentiments of love for woman. The dual elements of the Mahamudra union are skillful means and perfect insight, 20 the first being the male co-ordinate and the second the female. Thus the Guru embodies the skillful means necessary to achieve the pure pleasure of enlightenment, and the J)akini brings perfect insight and wisdom, the pure awareness and the ecstasy. Contrary to Hindu Tantra, as a rule these poles are not"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Introductt\"on 11 characterized as passive and active; stasis lies in separation and alienation (failure to recognize union), while dynamic energy (\"be-ing in love\") is the result of union. Means and insight, comprising the radical duality, are interpreted differently in different sadhanas, and also at different levels of progress and for different ends. In general, however, skillful means is designated \"compassion\" and perfect insight \"emptiness.\" Compassion in this context is not to be defined as pity, or even as divine love; compassion here is the Bodhisattva's sensibility responding spontaneously to the demands of the outer world with an immense variety of skillful means. These means are expressed by the entire pantheon of tantric deities, par-ticularly the wrathful deities that represent conformations of psychic forces transmuting negative energies into the elixir of pure pleasure. These deities' faces are represented as masks in the Tibetans' painted scrolls to indicate that there is no attachment to the violent emotions that the faces depict. Acting out of compassion the siddha emanates a fierce form of anger, for example, to destroy fear; and detachment from that emotion makes him invulnerable-a vajra siddha, or vojriiciirya as they say in Nepal. The co-ordinate of male compassion is female emptiness. The complete definition of perfect insight, to repeat a vital definition, is \"penetrating insight into the nature of all things as emptiness,\" and, therefore, perfect insight and emptiness relate as similar aspects of the one indeterminate absolute, or to rephrase it, emptiness has the cognitive capacity of pure, non-dual awarenessU spontaneously self-aware of its \"unborn\" manifestations. When compassion and emp-tiness unite, whatever the specific manifest form of the siddha's skillful means, it is rendered self-aware, empty and absolutely specific: this is the l)akini's blessing. These metaphysical concepts must be understood with Saraha's maxim in mind: there is no truth in any concept of truth. Yet as functional thought-forms they are fine tools by which the siddhas' legends and precepts can be interpreted. Compositions of them can also be enjoyed as finely spun webs of metaphysical speculation, for their complexity, internal logic, refinement of definition, and prox-imity to existential reality, has rarely been equalled elsewhere. These tantric formulae embody the accumulated wisdom of two millennia of Indian experiment in the laboratory of the mind. Tantra was the final blossoming of the yoga of knowledge (jiiiina-yoga); since the twelfth century most Indian spiritual movements, influ-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12 Masters of Mahiimudrii enced by Islam, have been cults offaith and devotion ( bhakti-yoga). The Muslims' iconoclastic zeal, horror at finding sex and god con-founded, and their militant intent to eradicate Buddhist centers of learning-the monastic academies-resulted in the annihilation of the higher Buddhist Tantra in India, although the Tibetans in-herited much of it; the lower tantra lived on in folk tradition and Hindu Tantra. ' Even from this· metaphysical analysis it should be clear that the siddhas enjoyed their sadhana. The psychological types who needed a simple life took to the road, but they lacked the radical ascetic in-tent that led some of their contemporaries, the paiupata saiva yogins, for example, to torment their bodies or minds in destructive self-abnegation (tapasya). The siddhas practiced purification, of course, but guilt was eradicated by initiation, and sin was only failure to practice meditation and any tendency to take an extreme view. Life was an audio-visual spectacular, a dance of ephemeral energy configurations that some called Mahamaya, the female per-sonification of Magnificent Illusion. \"Live as a child lives,\" \"the world is full of natural happiness. Dance, sing and enjoy it!\" \"Enjoy the pleasures of your senses, but\" and here was the crunch which distinguished the siddha from the neurotic sensualist, \"don't be at-tached to them. While drawing water, don't get wet!\" Thus enjoyment was both the result of sadhana and also the · means. Amongst the eighty-four siddhas there were many in-dividuals whose object of meditation was sensually delightful, like flowers, bird-song, music, and also sexual intercourse. The result of sadhana is pure pleasure, 22 and this, as its adjective implies, is quan-titatively different from the heightened sensation of sensual ex-perience. Pure pleasure is the feeling tone of the Buddha's mode of being as empty space, and it is essential to grasp the nature of this ultimate plane of being and its relation to the two relative planes. The ultimate existential mode of experience that is emptiness, the dharmakiiya is all-inclusive, and the words which characterize it are expressive of the inexpressible, an inconceivable non-duality: pure awareness, emptiness, pure pleasure, all-pervasive space, 28 and clear light. The relative modes of visionary enjoyment, the sa1]tbhogakiiya and apparitional incarnation, the nirmiittakiiya, are the duality that unites as the ultimate Mahamudra mode. The male co-ordinate of skillful means corresponds to the mode of visionary enjoyment and discriminating esthetic delight, where guidance is found in the form"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introduction 13 of ubiquitous, divine archetypes and symbolic indications; the essen· tial nature of this mode of being is radiant light. The female co· ordinate of perfect insight corresponds to the mode of apparitional incarnation in which the I;:>akini dances her magical display with tantalizing brilliance; in her essential nature she is manifest compas-sion. These three modes may also be visualized as interpenetrating spheres, or as the center, the radius and the circumference of a ma:pc;lala. That is the doctrine of the Buddha's three modes of be-ing, and it is essential to an understanding of the siddhas' metaphysics. Now, possessing the equipment necessary to read and understand the instruction and gain more than superficial pleasure from the legends as mystical fables, we will look at the legends' structure and at the actual meditation practice of the siddhas. In general, the structural pattern of the legends is diagnosis, prescription and cure. We find a sick man aware of his sickness, disgusted with his life. He is contrite and willing to do whatever is necessary to effect a cure. A Guru inevitably appears, and after the disciple requests instruction, the Guru grants initiation and precepts; the meditation guidance is usually given in terms of the creative and fulfillment modes of meditation. The disciple performs his sadhana and attains mahiimudrii-siddhi, and in the process the original disease is cured. The siddha achieves Buddhahood in his lifetime, and in his own body he attains the I;:>akini's Paradise. Without exception the legends stress the importance of the Guru. The Guru should not be viewed simply as an extraordinary human being with certain special knowledge to be transmitted, although this will be the preconception that the supplicant brings with him. It is essential, incidentally, that the disciple approaches the Guru as a supplicant; for, bound by his own tantric commitment, the Guru can only give precepts to those who approach him with respect, and who request initiation and instruction at a propitious moment and an appropriate juncture. But initiation radically alters the Guru/ disciple relationship, destroying all the initiate's preconcep· tions. The heart of the initiation is the Guru's revelation of himself as the Buddha and the initiate's experience of identity with this Guru/Buddha. Thereafter, the initiate's basic practice is to reproduce this ultimate experience of oneness and to assimilate it fully into his everyday life. Identifying the Guru/Buddha's body with all human beings and all appearances whatsoever, and his"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14 Masters of Mahamudra speech with all human speech and all sound whatsoever, and his mind with all-pervasive, pure, non-dual awareness, he effectively identifies himself with the Guru. So, although the initiate will always retain respect for the human individual in whom the Buddha manifested at initiation, gradually his notion of the Guru expands to include all beings without exception, including himself. The siddha is a man with such a vision. Many siddhas had incarnate J)akini Gurus, and many more had no human Guru at all. The root-tantras can be classified as father, mother or non-dual tantras: father-tantras stress the creative mode of meditation and skillful means; mother-tantras emphasize fulfill-ment meditation and perfect insight; and non-dual tantras treat both equally. Mother-or yogini-tantra was very popular amongst the siddhas-the names of Cakrasa1pvara and Hevajra appear most often in the legends-and thus the J)akini, generally in the form of Vajra Varahi, Cakrasaipvara's consort, appears frequently in their mindscape. Sometimes a Wisdom J)akiniu appears in the realm of visionary enjoyment (sa1]'tbhogakiiya) to initiate a yogin at the pro-pitious moment. If his capacity for creative imagination is sufficient-ly developed he sees her in a vision before him, otherwise he may hear a voice or simply see her and hear her in his mind's eye-the result is the same. Sometimes the J)akini is embodied; the mundane or worldly 1)akini25 often appears as a whore or a dancing girl to the itinerant yogin-in Tibet and Nepal, and perhaps India; drinking establishments and brothels were identical, and the hostess would be the madam. This identification of woman with the J)akini shows the thorough-going non-duality of Tantra-every woman is the J)akini; even though she may lack experiential recognition of it and never have heard the name, still she is the tantrika's I;>akini: even without beauty and intelligence, every woman is an immaculate, entrancing J)akini, the embodiment of wisdom. For one siddha the I;>akini was his mother, and for another she was a young girl. The l)akini Guru is clearly most capable of empowering a yogin to practice the fulfill-ment mode of meditation by uniting with him as insight to his skillful means, and this happens frequently. Other siddhas were in-itiated by Bodhisattvas-Mafijusri, Lokesvara or Tara-some ap-pearing in divine form in the sphere of visionary enjoyment (saf]1,bhogakiiya) and others as incarnate emanations ( nirmiittakiiya)."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction 15 Very frequently in the legends the Guru meets his disciple in a cremation ground. 26 Cremation grounds are replete with all kinds of symbolic meaning. First, it is the death-bed of the ego; unconscious-ly we make our way there walking the streets in a pall of angst, loneliness and self-hatred. It is the obvious place to meet one's Guru. The tantric yogin celebrates the cremation ground as an ideal place to meditate upon the precious human body, the transitory nature of existence, upon death and karmic retribution, and upon emptiness itself. It is also a good place to keep warm on bitter winter nights. Thus Guru and disciple meet in empathy. And here the initiate dies to the world of confusion and is reborn into the world of light. Jackals and hyenas lurk in the shadows, shrieking and howling, crows and vultures wheel overhead hoping, like the jackals, to taste human flesh. While the funeral pyres crackle and flame as the sparks fly upwards, the Dakin! in the gut cakra ignites' and melts concrete thought-patterns and all the rigidity of the head center which, in the form of the elixir of immortality, drips down into the I;>akinl's skull-cup. All phenomenal appearances take on an ethereal radiance, and sentient beings seem like apparitional phantoms in ecstasies of delight in the fertile ambience of sepulchral scenery. Further, here in the cremation ground the initiate can find the ap-purtenances of the yogin's life-style: a skull to use as a cup, a femur for a thigh-bone trumpet, human bones for a necklace, ·coronet, bracelets, and so forth. Just as bones are the infrastructure of the human body, so emptiness pervades reality. Thus the siddhas of the legends were initiated and instructed in the cremation ground. It is clear that the initiation is not merely a formal rite showing the disciple a carrot and welcoming him into the club. The initia-tion, which is also an empowerment, should ideally reveal the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind, the indeterminate absolute; and the specific qualities of the deity into whose mal).<;lala the in-itiate is led must also be disclosed. This implies an extremely sen-sitive recipient, and a very perspicacious and powerful transmitter. Most of the siddhas who had no previous meditation experience before they met their Gurus were experiencing an acute sense of loss, a spiritual vacuum brought about by extreme pain, mental or physical, and they were thus ripe for a radical change in mind (Greek: metanoia). At the bottom of the pit of samsaric suffering there is a point of recognition of one's own limitations and delusions"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"16 Masters of Mahamudrii that previously were such an integral part of the mind that they could not be viewed objectively and accepted for what they were, and coincident with this humbling recognition is a new sense of fresh potential and high expectation of the precious human body. Thus a rebound out of the pit is incipient in hell itself, and it is the Guru's function to deflect the rebound away from the trap of rebirth into another realm and off the wheel of life altogether. In The Tibetan Book of the Dead27 such \"traps\" are described as different colored lights that attract the consciousness of beings, according to their karmic propensities, in between death and rebirth. Further, remorse and contrition are essential elements in the pre-initiation syndrome, as they are in the Christian experience of \"meeting Christ\" and \"rebirth.\" The greater the sense of revulsion, shame, self-hatred and nihilistic distress, the more receptive the initiate is likely to be, and the more radical the \"turning around in the seat of consciousness.\" The Guru must always arrive on the scene at the propitious moment, and if he is indeed the Guru he will. Following initiation comes instruction, which may have only a tenuous connection to the specific content of the initiation. But the Guru's instruction is more than conveyance of concepts to be put into practice. First, in the flush of the mystical experience of initia-tion the Guru/Buddha's word is essentially empty sound and pure pleasure; pure awareness of this constitutes the most important aspect of \"secret teaching. \"28 Second, listening to the Guru's instruc· tion with an open mind, symbolic overtones can usually be heard, and this level of guidance, transcending concepts, is direct and penetrating. Danger, however, lies in interpreting these symbolic in-dications through the filter of a deluded mind, rather than allowing intuition to assimilate them immediately. Third, the precepts en-shrining specific meditation instruction is what is to be practiced as sadhana. Most of the siddhas' practices can be subsumed under the heads of creative and fulfillment modes, but Tantra, defined in contra-distinction to hinayana and mahayana is \"the path of mul· tiple means,\"29 and in this phrase lies an ocean of possibilities. Interpreting \"multiple means\" broadly, Tantra or vajrayiina (the path of practice where the vajra, or thunderbolt, is symbolic of ultimate, empty reality) includes the practices of hinayana (the Jesser path), such as one pointed concentration (samatha), guarding the doors of the senses (uipasyanii), a strict personal discipline, and much more; the practices of mahayana, the Bodhisattva's path,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introduction 17 such as meditation on emptiness, contemplation of the four boundless states of mind, arousal of the bodhicitta of compassion, and so forth, together with the vast variety of tantric practices. These tantric practices primarily include, for example, visualization of deities and recitation of mantra, physical yoga and manipulation of priitta (breath), complex alchemical rites, formless meditation, and pilgrimage. But Tantra is also the path of multiple means because it employs the entire gamut of human activity as the basis of meditation, as the siddhas' sadhanas demonstrate. The king meditates on his throne, the farmer in his fields, the lecher meditates in bed, and the widower in the cremation ground. Fur-ther, the yogin sitting in contemplation may be confronted by hor-rible neurotic confusion and startlingly perverse concepts: any and every mind-state whatsoever is the means to its own transformation. Thus the infinite variety of imperfect human personalities is also the multiplicity of means to attain mahiimudrii-siddht'. It is useful here to introduce the metaphor of alchemy to explain the mechanics of tantric meditation. The yogin is an alchemist who must transmute the base metal of a confused mind into the gold of pure awareness. The quality of the base metal in the yogin's posses-sion is irrelevant. His philosopher's stone that turns all into gold is full awareness of a homeopathic dose of the poison that caused the original confusion. If lust is the dominant mind-poison, then meditation upon a controlled experience of desire, in the light of the Guru's initiation and instruction, shows him the emptiness of all desire, and realizing the ultimate nature of his mind he realizes the ultimate nature of the entire universe, and thus attains mahiimudrii-siddhi. The panacea, then, is the nature of neurotic personality, and the principle of the cure is \"like cures like\" (similia similibus curan-tor-the axiom of homeopathy). This innovative and considerably dangerous technique was justified by the Buddha's prophecy that his doctrine would endure for five hundred years in its pure form, five hundred in a modified form, and that thereafter, in the kalz'yuga, the age of strife, the black or iron age, man would be unable to follow the discipline, or find the compassion, to practice the ways of either the hinayana arhat or the mahayana Bodhisattva, and the way of the siddha would be revealed. In the kali'yuga the im-patient disciple wants results immediately, unwilling to wait for literally aeons of successive rebirths before attaining nirviiJ).a. The"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"18 Masters of Mahamudra time-consuming practice on the lesser paths is the process of purify-ing the mind, eradicating vice and passion and cultivating virtue and clarity. One basic principle of Tantra is that good and evil, vir-tue and vice, and pleasure and pain, are equally delusive when there is still clinging to the good and pleasant and rejection of the vicious and ugly; but everything is of equal value as raw material in the pro-cess of transmutation. The danger that an initiate will abuse this precept, asserting in justification of hedonism and immorality the rationale that vice and passion have the same ultimate quality as vir-tue and clarity, is minimized by the initiate's sworn obedience to his Guru and by the commitments he pledges to his Guru at initiation. These commitments are called samayas, and for the initiate to break his samayas is to throw himself, with his Guru, into hell. Risking the danger of the tantric path is justified by the proven efficacy of tan-tric techniques. Proof enough is the existence of a pure lineage that today is still transmitting the precepts which transform ordinary consciousness into a siddha's awareness. In this alchemical meditation-rasayana-what in other systems of meditation are treated as obstacles are friendly helpers on the path. Neurotic attitudes and frustrating features of the environment are the means by which such conditions are transcended. Lusts, at-tachments, deceits, fascinations and fixations are the meat of meditation, and the uninvited guest, irritating impingement of sound, paranoid delusion and mental chatter, all assist the yogin in becoming a siddha. Still, those siddhas who became most renowned-Liiipa, Saraha, Tilopa, Naropa, Viriipa and Nagar-juna-who initiated lineages that, through Tibet, are still alive to-day, were renunciate yogins who abandoned home and family ties, their palaces and academies, security and comfort, fame and wealth, and the institutional fabric of existence, to practice in con-ditions of deprivation. All eighty-four performed the same alchemical meditations, but those who removed the principal and proximate causes of gross and acute fascination and attachment, and the strongest agencies of the mind's structuring and condition-ing, achieved most. The value of renunciation is manifold, but with regard to the friendly helpers mentioned above, they are most helpful if they come one at a time allowing sufficient attention to be given to each.

The meaning of \"the path of multiple means\" becomes clear, and the terminology of the creative and fulfillment techniques, which most siddhas practiced, is defined. In creative meditation the yogin begins by identifying with the field of emptiness; out of emptiness arises a seed-syllable30 that is the quintessential euphonic corollary of the form of the principal deity of the maQ.c;lala to be created. Employing the faculty of creative visualization, out of the seed-syllable arises the deity and his en-tourage of divine beings and their consorts visualized within a palace surrounded by symmetrical walls and gates. Then, by means of mudrii, mantra and samiidhi, these three, the deities of the maQ.c;lala are realized; through symbolic gestures of the hands, recitation of the creative mantra of the deity and visualization of the deities' forms, in a samadhi of identification with the Guru's mind, the yogin vitalizes the psychic functions that the deities, their crowns, ornaments and emblems, etc., represent. Further, this basic process of visualization and recitation culminates in the emanation of lights from the yogin's head, throat and heart centers to the cor-responding centers in the Guru-Buddha in the sky above, to be re-absorbed with the vitalizing power of the Buddha's three modes of being. In this way the yogin is identified with the deity; and insofar as the deity, replete with symbolic representations of the Buddha's awareness and qualities, is a statement of non-dual absolute reality, at this point there is no distinction between the maQ.c;lala, the Guru's Body, Speech and Mind, and the yogin's experienceY Further elaboration of the visualization includes offerings to the deity, rites of confession, restoration of the samaya pledges, praise and adora-tion, and other similar functions. Finally, the vision is dissolved back into the emptiness out of which it arose. Creative meditation induces realization of the nature of relative truth:32 all phenomenal ap-pearances are illusion; what appear to be concrete isolates are func-tions of our sensory apparatus; there is no essential soul or ens that persists independent of the psycho-physical conglomerate; the universe is a system of interdependent relationships. Fulfillment meditation includes \"higher\" techniques of medita-tion, which result in understanding of ultimate truth. 33 But since relative and ultimate truth are two sides of the same coin, creative and fulfillment stages both lead to the same goal. Fundamentally,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20 Masters of Mahamudra fulfillment meditation techniques entail the perception of emptiness in form, or the dissolution of form into emptiness: the dissolution of the creative stage vision into emptiness is technically a fulfillment stage practice. Examples of fulfillment mode yogas are dream yoga, the yoga of the mystic heat, Mahamudra meditation, the yoga of the apparitional body, the yoga of resurrection, clear light meditation, and the yoga of uniting skillful means and perfect insight to create the seed-essence of pure pleasure. 34 The system of visualization vital in fulfillment meditation is that of the subtle body. This imaginary subtle body consists of psychic nerves-nii{ii; their focal points or energy centers-cakras; the energy that runs in the nerves-priitta; and the essence of priitta, known as \"seed-essence\" or bindu. A cen-tral channel, or nerve, runs from the sexual center to the fontanelle, and the left, rasanii, and right, lalanii, channels run para11el joining the central channel, the avadhuti, at the gut center. Converging from all parts of the body like physical veins, subsidiary nerves enter the central channel at the five focal points of psychic energy35-the sexual, gut, heart, throat and head centers. Visualization of this system allows the yogin to manipulate the energies relating to the various centers for different mundane purposes, but the highest aim is to inject all energy into the central channel and up to the-head center where ultimate liberation is achieved. The key to this system relates right and left channels to skillful means (male) and perfect insight (female) respectively, and the central channel to their union-Mahamudra. 36 In an important sexual yoga, with or without a sexual partner, red and white seed-essence, bodMdttas, are mixed in the sexual center to rise up the central channel as kutt{ialini. This is the yoga of uniting pure pleasure and emptiness. 87 Many legends state that the Guru's precepts instruct in both creative and fulfillment modes of meditation, but in the verse of in-struction, which is like a jewel in the plain narrative setting of the legend, it is unclear how the instruction relates to the different modes. In such cases assume that \"creative\" and \"fulfillment\" modes indicate principles of meditation, the first that \"emptiness is form\" and the second that \"all things are emptiness.\" For example, the skull-cup symbolizes the first principle, and its emptiness the sec-ond. Since creative meditation employs the extroversive energy of desire and procreation and relates to the father-tantra, while fulfill-ment employs the introversive energy of aversion and the death-wish and relates to the mother-tantra, the \"creative mode\" indicates"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction 21 radial ener.gy, and the \"fulfillment mode\" focal energy. Further, in-sofar as virtually all Buddhist meditation is derived from the two fundamental techniques that the Buddha Sakyamuni taught-ex-troversive insight meditation, and introversive concentration meditation38-the \"creative mode\" signifies predominant use of the former principle and the \"fulfillment mode\" of the latter. Mahamudra is attained by uniting creative and fulfillment modes: by practicing simultaneous meditation upon form and emptiness; by practicing insight and concentration techniques simultaneously; by fusing centripetal and centrifugal energies; by uniting skillful means and perfect insight. Thus male and female principles, realized by creative and fulfillment modes respectively, are united. To complete this practical exposition of the anuttarayoga-tantra by means of the triadic structure of vision, meditation and action, 39 something more should be said of action, the siddha's existential praxis. The nature of this praxis is rarely analyzed because it has no specific form. Generally, in legend and song, it is described in terms of the eight great siddhis and through metaphor and symbol, but only to motivate and inspire the neophyte. When the Guru does in-clude it as a subject of instruction, as in the siddhas' dohiis, the sid-dha's behavior is characterized as unlimited and spontaneous, selfless and compassionate. After the initiate's experiential realiza-tion of pure awareness and emptiness in a mystical experience of union has determined constant, involuntary emanation of compas-sionate action, there are no restraints whatsoever upon the scope of the siddha's activity. With the experientially based conviction that the relative world is all vanity, and that any mundane ambition is a futile waste of the opportunity afforded by this precious human body to attain spiritual liberation, together with a realization of the unity of self and others and the resultant benign empathy, the sid-dha cannot but act for the benefit of himself and others simultaneously. Thus insofar as the Bodhisattva Vow permeates his being, the siddha is driven to action uninhibited by any social or moral norm. The effusion of selfless love and the constant awareness of what is necessary override, and eventually eliminate, the condi-tioned restraints that inhibit manifestation of the full potential of human activity. The Bodhisattva Vow, or rather the experience of oneness with all sentient beings that determines the quality of a siddha's action, is not to be considered the cause of his activity, nor are his actions to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"22 Masters of Mahamudra be seen as a function of ordinary karmic cause and effect. On the contrary, stressing the siddha's freedom from the effects of past kar· ma his behavior is characterized as \"spontaneous\" (free of any con-notation of impulsiveness). \"Spontaneous action\"•o can be conceived as a mode of the integrated physical, verbal and mental capacities of the psycho-organism operating in total responsiveness to the situa-tion of which it is the central and principal part. Metaphorically, it is a case of the tail wagging the dog; the Guru/siddha responds im-mediately to the ultimate needs of his circle (his mav<;lala) despite the obfuscations of self-interest, desire or ambition uppermost in his disciples' consciousness. The siddha has no choice but to respond selflessly to the stimulus provided by the highest function of interac-tion with his disciples, the function of release from human limita-tions. Thus he acts to liberate the people he encounters from the confines of their emotional and mental prisons. Since the siddha's personal karma has no place in determining the nature of his action, and because his action is a reflex of beings seeking their own salva-tion, it is styled \"no-action,\"•1 a concept that the Taoist expresses as wu wei. Further, insofar as the siddha acts spontaneously, free of thought or effort, totally absorbed in awareness of the moment., his action is said to be unmotivated and aimless. 42 As the siddha' con-templates the river's flow with an intrinsic but detached awareness, his actions make no ripples-that is the Buddha's Karma. Ego-motivated action is an attempt to divert the river's flow for personal or social advantage, and such action creates a concatenation of cause and effect that eventually returns to impinge positively or negatively upon its perpetrator-that is karma.48 The siddha's ac-tion is in such harmony with the natural flow that he may appear to be the agent of a supernatural authority, or he himself may be iden· tified as that authority with the elements at his command. He may be perceived as a magician who can order the stars and set the planets in their courses, or at the very least he may be seen as the conductor of nature's symphony. It is pertinent at this point to stress that the siddha's vision does not itself induce a siddha's actions. Intuition that the phenomenal world as we perceive it is a lie, that moral and social values are mind-created and therefore purely utilitarian, that \"truth\" is relative to hypothetical, metaphysical criteria, are insights that must be based in perpetual experiential identification with empty awareness through a twenty-four-hour-a-day meditation practice."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction 23 Only then does \"action\" become \"non-action\". Meditation is the bridge between vision and action. If the siddha's action is concomitant with Mahamudra, what then of his craziness, his . flaunting of social convention and his uninhibited emotivity? To a large extent those very prejudices, preconceptions and other limitations of his critic's blinkered vision which the siddha rejoices to see eradicated, determine the percep-tion of him as crazy. For instance, when the critic interprets the sid-dha's act, or gesture, as a crazy irrelevancy, as the non-sequitur of a madman, it is probable that he is failing to intuit the level of response upon which the siddha is operating, and that his discursive analysis is precluding the soteriological effect in his own mind through which those open to the siddha's transmission of meaning by symbolical action or gesture benefit. Similarly, when a moralist of the Confucian type castigates a siddha for violating social conven · tions such as the rules of pure eating, or for immoral behavior such as sexual transgression, from the Buddha's point of view there is less virtue in the moralist's inflexible social and moral prescriptions than in the siddha's \"sinful\" attempts to induce awareness, with all the social and moral benefits that accrue, wherein enlightenment is the ultimate goal. Thus on the short-cut path of Tantra, disregard of social and moral discipline is the corollary of the compassionate skillful means employed by the adept to eradicate obstacles to liberation. Although the siddha's activity should not, therefore, be perceived as \"crazy\" on account of transgression of moral and social parameters, according to Maitripa uncontrolled emotivity as a result of inadequate training is authentic divine madness. The thought-free yogin is like a chz\"ld, Like a bee z'n a flower garden tasting every bloom, Like a lion roaring in the jungle, And like the wind blowing where it listeth. If his mind is trained in attention and discretz\"on His behavior zs immaculate; If there are no checks upon his mind's effusion The yogin behaves lz\"ke a divine madman. 44 Certainly, after the siddha's enlightening experience of ego-loss and the irrevocable identification with empty awareness, there is no"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"24 Masters of Mahamudra possibility of modifying his behavior patterns: spontaneity is the sid-dha's mode. But from Maitripa's experience, if the neophyte is trained to discipline the emotions, and discretion and prudence are cultivated before Mahamudra meditation bears fruit, then the effu-sion of emotion can be utilized rather than the yogin being a creature of it. While the dance, or persona, of the crazy, thought-free yogin should be part of every siddha's repertoire, as it was in the case of the famous Tibetan siddha Drukpa Kunley45 for example, exdusive reliance upon this didactic style with its social limitations and lack of flexibility, would appear to be the mode of a siddha of lesser attainment. But within the tradition there is no distinction made between the Mahamudra attainment of a Nagarjuna (16) and a Mekopa ( 43). Finally, tangential to this topic, Maitripa's verses in-dicate the fine line, or the lack of any boundary at all, between Mahamudra and madness. But for Maitripa and all the siddhas on Tantra's short-cut path to the Buddha's enlightenment, commit-ment was so complete, doubt in the efficacy of the path and access to the goal so inconceivable, that the dangers involved were con-sidered in much the same way as we approach the danger to life when crossing a busy highway. All the siddhas who attained mahdmudrii-st\"ddht\", the active ex-pression of which has been discussed above, \"finally attained ultimate liberation in the J)akini's Paradise.\"46 In some legends however, the final line stating that the siddha attained the J)akini's Paradise \"in his own body\" introduces some ambiguity. It can be in-ferred that his body dissolved into light and his demise (part\"nt\"rviipa) was a magicalspiralling into the empyreum. Alternatively, the state-ment could be a recapitulation of his life since his enlightenment; in his ultimate mystical experience he attained the pure land where his existence was felt to be a constant dance with the J)akinis, who represent the empty awareness of his pleasure. Further, the phrase rendered as \"J)akini's Paradise\"47 is ambiguous in itself and could be translated simply as \"sky\" or \"space.\" For the Mahasiddha Pad-masambhava, the J)akini's Paradise was his homeland of Orgyen (O<;l<;liyava. the Swat Valley), which was also conceived as a Dhar-makaya Buddhafield. The majority of the siddhas who did not at-tain the Oakini's Paradise were those who only accomplished mun-dane st\"ddhis and, attaining immortality, or extraordinary longevi-ty, remained on earth working for humanity. These were the niith siddhas, who were to become recognized as the progenitors of the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction 25 great hathayoga tradition of saiva-tantra. The belief that they are still alive today is shared by millions of contemporary Hindus, who will probably direct the enquirer to the Kumaon district in the Himalayas to find Gorak~a (9), Cauratigi (10) and the other immor-tals, still meditating in secluded caves. The legends convey the lore of eighth-twelfth century India and also the timeless ethos of Hindu spirituality. But their psychological core has a universal appeal and application that transcends culture, religion and race. Aspects of Tantra can be found in the mysticism of every culture, and the systematic formulation of mysticism (in-sofar as mysticism can be systematized) that is Tantra is touching responsive chords in contemporary western society. The western mystical mind that is potentially responsive to the tantric message of the siddhas is likely to show a strong repugnance to materialistic at-titudes, the social and professional rat-race, and the tedium of repetitive routine. As to a suitable predisposition, he or she may be suffering nervous anxiety, about to undergo a psychological breakdown or to enter analysis, or may be a perfectly healthy poet, craftsman or contemplative; but the mind should already be free of emotional and conceptual constraints that hinder faith in the irra-tional and trust in the Guru. The potential initiate should be in-telligent enough to grasp simple metaphysical concepts and suffi-ciently introverted and self-disciplined to sit in contemplation. If he has no knowledge of the sanctity of sex he should at least be free of prudish or prurient attitudes; and also, if he has contempt for scholasticism and pedantry, and a healthy disrespect for intellectual analysis, and if he has some disdain for secular authority, institu-tional discipline, social convention and sacred cows, his attitude is congruous with that of the progenitors of the lineage. The image of the empty bucket, right-end up, free of leaks, demonstrates the nature of mind that is then ready for the Guru's teaching. A major obstacle on the path of Tantra (which is viewed by its adherents as a middle path) that particularly afflicts the western mind deeply conditioned by a rational and scientific education, is a rooted belief in the law of the excluded middle. This law of reason-ing that insists upon a categorical positive or negative answer to any question, ignoring the middle ground, is of crucial importance in the technological world, but it is a radical impediment to develop-ment of gnostic vision. It entails taking an \"extreme\" stance, when according to madhyamz'ka metaphysics mahiimudrii-sz'ddhz' is only"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26 Masters of Mahamudni accessible when all extreme thought patterns have been eradicated, or to be less extreme, when such thought patterns have become dominated by a vision that experientially reflects reality never as this or that, never as the negation of this or that, never as a synthesis of this and that, and never as an absence of this and that. Reality, in fact, is the excluded middle: it is indeterminable. In Europe it was heresy to think in these terms during the political domination of the Church, when many thousands of men and women were martyred for daring to conceive non-dualistic metaphysical doctrines that ex-pedited union with the divine. However, what is lacking in conventional education and Carte-sian, mainstream cultural thought patterns in the West, can be more than outweighed by actual gnostic experience achieved for-tuitously, or by use of psychedelic substances. Many religious cultures, including the Indian but excluding the Tibetan, 48 use psychotropic drugs as initiatory keys and as aids in psycho· experimental techniques of release from sarpsara and alleviation of neural disorders, and in the West psychedelics have played an im· portant part in fomenting interest in the tantric path. Social accep-tance of human sexuality as a means to an end besides reproduction is another contemporary phenomenon conducive to a mind-set receptive to Tantra. However the fact that only one of the siddhas made a chemical preparation his sadhana (Vyiili, 84) and only one used sexuality as the principal means to his enlightenment (Babhaha, 39), places psychedelic chemicals and sex in clear perspective in the Buddhist Tantra. Even casual association with Tibetan Lamas, the contemporary bearers of the siddha tradition, makes it difficult to avoid the inference that although psychedelics and sexual freedom may be important indicators of our liberation from the anti-mystical, and therefore anti-tantric, straight-jacket of Judao-Christian thought and ethics, they are not passports to the Buddha's enlightenment. Although a Westerner may possess the requisite receptivity, at-titudes and experience conducive to optimal potentiation of tantric precepts, he must find a Guru to instruct him. He may find that a divine Bodhisattva or a divine I;>iikini appears to him propitiously, but the instruction received from such an agency can only be very simple and direct unless much preliminary work on the mind has been completed and unless a very strong working relationship is"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction 27 established with the divine agency. A mundane I;>akini may grant informal initiation and succinct, sensitive advice, but where is the Western I;>akini who can give practical guidance based upon a thorough understanding of the tantras and experiential knowledge of techniques? The principal bearers of the siddhas' tradition today are Tibetan Lamas, who through our good fortune are now seeking refuge in hospitable countries around the globe, due to the destruc-tion of their theocracy in Tibet, and because they find they can fulfill a need where they settle. The Tibetan school that has retained the siddhas' ethos as well as the transmission of an uncorrupted though modified teaching tradition, is the Kahgyu school. To this school belongs the Tibetan classic The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, 49 which expresses the siddhas' teaching as interpreted by Milarepa and his Guru Marpa who received instruction from N aropa and Kukkuripa in· the eleventh century. There are several competent Lamas in the West today who have received Milarepa's transmission through the lineage of the late Sixteenth Gyelwa Kar-mapa. The Sakya school has transmitted the Mahamudra teaching of the siddha Virupa, in particular. The Nyingma school bases its doctrines upon the Mahasiddha Padmasambhava's precepts. There is hardly an Indian-originated Tibetan lineage that does not include a name found amongst the eighty-four mahasiddhas. Although the cultural impact of Tibet over a thousand years must have altered the tenor of the Indian tradition, since in general the Tibetan schools are characterized by an overwhelming reluctance to question Indian doctrines, departure from the Tantra of the siddhas has been minimal. The Lamas will teach the siddhas' sadhanas, but very few will in-· itiate an untutored western aspirant and grant him precepts spon-taneously. Very few can jump the cultural chasm, diagnose an in-dividual's problem and prescribe the cure. Most will insist upon a lengthy period of preparation in the disciplines of hinayana and mahayana, and, also, essential preparatory tantric meditation prac-tice. 50 However, the siddhas' tradition is by no means dead, and the next generation in the West can enjoy the fruit of this generation of Lamas' work. Since need, ability and aspiration are present in a favorable environment, there is no reason why countless American and European siddhas should not flourish in a latter-day blossoming of the tantric tradition transposed to the West."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Notes to the Introductz\"on 1.

The image that gives insight into this concept is of the siddha so totally relaxed, so removed, detached from his \"per-formance\" (T. spyod pa), that he can passively watch the functions of his body, speech and mind as we would watch a movie: that is the Bud-dha's detachment. In another sense, since in Mahamudra there is no beginning, middle or end of any dharma, no creation or cessation, there is no manifestation and therefore \"no-action;\" there is only \"pure poten-tial'' in an ineffable union of ultimate and relative.

The Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit karma that is applied to Buddhas and sentient beings alike, is las for sentient beings and 'phrin las for Buddhas. Las means \"action\" or \"work,\" while 'phrin is an honorific prefix. Different schools perceive the Buddha's karma in dif-ferent ways. Gautama's final action, his death, was, according to some scriptures, effected by his thoughtless killing of an insect in a past life, but upon his parinirvaQ.a his karmic depths were exhausted. The spon-taneous action of Mahamudra leaves no trace. Thought, voice and ac-tion patterns (sarp,skiira) determined by moral or immoral actions of body, speech and mind in this lifetime have been eradicated, allowing the siddha free, spontaneous responsiveness in the immediate situation, but racial and genetic karma, karma from past lives-and intra-uterine karma?-may still be functional. 44.

In his palace, where the walls were plated with gold and silver and studded with pearls and precious stones, the young king ruled his two brothers and all the people of Sri Lanka. However, possessing nothing but contempt for wealth and power, his only desire was to escape his situation.

Wandering the length of In-dia, eventually he arrived in Vajrasana, where the Buddha Sakyamuni had achieved enlightenment, and there he attached himself to hospitable I)akinis, who transmitted to him their feminine insight. From Vajrasana he travelled to Pataliputra, the king's capital on the River Ganges, where he subsisted on the alms he begged and slept in a cremation ground. Begging in the bazaar one market day, he paused at a house of pleasure, and his karma ef-fected this fateful encounter with a courtesan, who was an incar-nate, worldly I)akini. Gazing through him at the nature of his mind, the I)akini said, \"Your four psychic centers and their energies are quite pure, but there is a pea-sized obscuration of royal pride in your heart.\" And with that she poured some putrid food into his clay' bowl and told him to be on his way. He threw the inedible slop into the gutter, whereupon the I)akini, who had been watching him go, shouted after him angrily, \"How can you attain nirvapa if you're still concerned about the purity of your food?\" The yogin was mortified. He realized that his critical and judgemental mind was still subtly active; he still perceived some things as intrinsically more desirable than others. He also understood that this propensity was the chief obstacle in his progress to Buddhahood. With this realization he went down to the River Ganges and began a twelve year slidhana to destroy his discursive thought-patterns and his prejudices and preconceptions. His prac-tice was to eat the entrails of the fish that the fishermen disem-boweled, to transform the fish-guts into the nectar of pure awareness by insight into the nature of things as emptiness. The fisherwomen gave him his name, Liiipa, which means Eater of Fish-guts. The practice which gave him his name also brought him power and realization. Liiipa became a renowned Guru, and in the legends of Darikapa and I)eti.gipa there is further mention of him. Siidhana It is appropriate that the first of the eighty-four legends should repeat the elements of the story of the first Buddha, Sakyamuni, in a tantric guise.

Deer-skins indicate renunciate status; the Bodhisattva Avalokite5vara wears one around his torso. But Liiipa was born into the kaliyuga when it was no longer possible to practice the fierce discipline and simple practices that Siikyamuni taught. In order to eradicate the subtle defilement that the I;>iikini indicated and to resolve the dualistic mental constructs that are the root cause of satpsiira, to attain freedom from satpsiira in this lifetime a radical short-cut method was required, and in Liiipa's case, as with many of the siddhas, a I;>akini was at hand to provide it. Liiipa was a master of the mother-tantra, and his Gurus were . I;>iikini Gurus, mundane I;>akinis, embodiments of the female prin-ciple of awareness. 1 The I;>iikini who indicated his siidhana was a publican and whore-mistress, for liquor shops doubled as brothels. The \"royal pride\" she discerned in his heart can be rendered more precisely as \"racial, caste and social discrimination,\"2 and with her putrid food she pointed at a method which can best be described as the path of dung eating. Cultivate what is most foul and abhorrent, and consciousness is thereby stimulated to the point of transcendence; familiarize yourself with what is most disgusting and eventually it tastes no different from bread and butter. The result of this method is attainment of the awareness of sameness3 that is at the heart of all pride, all discrimination and prejudice, and transmutes these moral qualities, that are the mental equivalent of fishcguts, in-to emptiness. To elaborate the l;>iikini's parting sally: so long as you fail to perceive the inherent reality of emptiness in every sensual stimulus, every state of mind, and every thought, you will remain in dualistic satpsara, judging, criticizing and discriminating. To attain the non-duality of nirviil).a find the awareness of sameness in what is most revolting, and realize the one taste of all, 4 which is pure pleasure. More light is shed on Liiipa's practice by considering what fish meant in his society. First, fish is the flesh of a sentient being and therefore anathema to the orthodox brahmin; but left-over fish-guts is fit only for dogs, the lowest life-form on the totem pole. Such a practice, if indeed Liiipa performed a literal interpretation, would have made him unclean in the eyes of his former peers, untouchable and unapproachable.

Second, fish is a symbol of spirituality and sense control, and Liiipa's Saqwara sadhana, which is not described here, involves transformation of his universe into that of a god in his paradise, and attainment of control of his energies (pratta) and thus of his senses. Hz'storiography Our legend is the only source to assert that Luipa was born in Sri Lanka, to which the text's Sitighaladvipa must refer. But there were several kingdoms in the sub-continent called Sh\\ghaladvipa, one contiguous to OQ.Q.iya~a which other sources give as Luipa's birth-place. In Bu ston's account, 5 Luipa was son of King Lalitacandra of OQ.Q.iya~a. When the prince encountered Savaripa, Saraha's dis-ciple, he was immensely impressed by this siddha and begged him for instruction. He received initiation into the Sa'l]lvara-tantra. The initial part of his sadhana was completed when he joined a circle of twenty-four l;>akas and l;>akinis in a rite of offering in a cremation ground which climaxed in consumption of the corpse of a sage. With a final blessing from his Guru he left OQ.Q.iya~a and began a mendicant sadhu existence. That period ended when, feeling the need for sustained one-pointed meditation practice, he sat down to meditate beside a pile of fish-guts by the banks of the River Ganges in Bengal (Batigala), where he remained until he had attained mahamudra-siddhi. His subsequent encounter with the king and minister who became Darikapa and l;>etigipa portray Liiipa as an outrageously honest and fearless exploiter of personal power, and also an adept wielder of the apt phrase bearing tantric truth. Consis-tent with this facility with words, the Sakya school's account of Luipa's life6 asserts that he was a scribe (kayastha) at the court of the Maharaja of Bharendra, Dharmapala. Begging alms at Dhar-mapala's palace Savaripa recognized the scribe Luipa as a suitable recipient of .his Sarp.vara lineage; his extraordinary talent was evi-dent in the versified letters he wrote to the king's correspondents, a task requiring acute, one-pointed concentration. Taranatha's ac-count7 differs significantly from Bu ston's in that Luipa was a scribe to the King of OQ.Q.iya~a. and was initiated into Vajra Varahi's ma~Q.ala."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Mahasiddha Lutpa 37 The most significant piece of information in these legends is that Liiipa worked at the court of the Maharaja of Bharendra, Dhar-mapala. The only king who had the right to call himself Maharaja of this kingdom was the great Pala Emperor Dharmapala, who gained it by right of conquest. Since the Sakya legends have been given the greatest historiographical credence of all the siddhas' legends, it is tempting to accept this crucial identification and place Liiipa as a younger contemporary of Dharmapala (AD 770-810). If Liiipa was initiated in his youth at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth, his Guru Savaripa's lifetime can be calculated, together with the dates of Darikapa and l)engipa, and also I;>ombi Heruka (4) who Liiipa taught.8 Kilapa (73) may also have been his disciple.9 But if Liiipa was born in the eighth century he cannot be identified with Minapa/Macchendranath, an iden-tification that has been attempted due to several coincidences: 10 the stem of both their names means \"fish;\" they are both associated with Sri Lanka and Bengal; they both conceived yogini-tantra lineages (Liiipa-Sa:rpvara, Minapa-Yogini-kaula), and they are both known as adi-guru. Whereas Minapa was the originator of niith saz'va lineages, from which he gained his adi-guru status, Liiipa has no Hindu associations, although his sadhana has a siikta ethos. Liiipa's first place in the eighty-four legends could reflect the belief of the narrator, or the translator, that Liiipa was First Guru (adi-guru) of the Mahamudra-siddhas in either time or status. The other claimant to this title is Saraha.11 Regarding time, Liiipa was born after Saraha, but although Liiipa's Guru was Saraha's disciple, their lifetimes probably overlapped. Regarding status and personal power, whereas Saraha's reputation lies to a large extent in his literary genius, Liiipa's name evokes a sense of the siddha's tremen-dous integrity and commitment, the samaya that creates the per-sonal power demonstrated in his legends. Both Saraha and Liiipa were originators of Sarp,vara-tantra lineages, but it was Liiipa who received the title of Guhyapati, Master of Secrets, to add to his status of adi-guru in the lineage .that practiced the Sarp,vara-tantra according to the method of Liiipa; he received direct transmission from the I;>akini Vajra Varahi.12 If Liiipa obtained his original Sa:rpvara revelation in O<f<fiyal)a, the home of several of the mother-tantras, he would have been one of the siddhas responsible for prop-agating this tantra in Eastern India.

Marpa Dopa transmitted the tantra to Tibet, where it has remained the principal yidam practice of the Kahgyu school until today. Although the Tibetan translator rendered \"Luipa\" as The Fish-gut Eater (Nya lto zhabs), the root of the word is probably Old Bengali lohita, a type of fish, and Luipa is thus synonymous with Minapa and Macchendra/Matsyendra.

Thereafter the king meditated upon his lion-throne, reclining upon cushions of silk, surrounded by his queens and ministers and entertained by the court musicians playing various kinds of in-struments. He became famous as Lilapa due to his evident fondness for sensual pleasure and his fascination with beautiful form. Lilapa's meditation instruction was to concentrate unwaveringly upon the ring he wore on his right hand. After his concentration had become fixed, he was instructed to visualize Hevajra surround-ed by his retinue of divinities within the ring. When he had succeed-ed in transfixing that vision, by uniting creative and fulfillment modes of meditation realization spontaneously unfolded. With the dawning of this understanding he attained the power and realiza · tion of Mahamudra together with many other qualities, such as ex-trasensory perception. Lilapa's story demonstrates that when the Guru's instruction and the disciple's highly motivated aspiration and karmic propensities coincide, there is no need to renounce the enjoyment of sensual pleasure to attain liberation. Lilapa became known throughout the world for his wonderful acts of selflessness. Finally, he attained ultimate liberation into the J;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana There were many reasons for the success of vajrayana in India. Social trends assisted: the decline in power of the brahmins and in-creasing popularity of the lower castes' deities, and the decline of ascetic monasticism and a tendency towards hedonistic pleasure, were both causes and effects. In this social climate vajrayana was in-herently attractive, and not least in its attraction was the marriage of sensual pleasure and the prestige of religious ordination. In va-jrayana the monistic trend of Indian philosophy reached its in-evitable end, where the nature of all human activity was accepted as divine, the same in quality and quantity as the supreme essence itself. But as the legend points out, in order for the aspirant to realize himself as a god, and his environment as paradise, certain conditions must obtain. He must first find a Guru with whom he has rapport and who can prescribe a relevant practice; his motivation must be correct, which means directed towards gnostic realization"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Lilapa 41 and selfless service rather than pleasure oriented; and his karma must be sufficiently mature, meaning that his disgust with his pre-· sent situation must be intense. Evidently Lilapa was fortunate in the coincidence of propitious conditions, for immediately after his in-itiation he became absorbed in a one-pointed samadhi, 13 which is very difficult when life has been spent in frivolous distraction or worldly preoccupation. In order to achieve one-pointed concentration, even for most tan-trikas, it is necessary to retreat to a cave, to physical solitude and silence. But with a successful initiation and a perceptive Guru's in-struction, together with the other conditions mentioned above, renunciation can become a state of mind, and \"the cave\" can become a retreat from worldly attachment into the cave of emp-tiness. This cave of emptiness is not a hole deep in th~ mind from which the siidhaka can look out at the world going by, fb~r emptiness is not separate from form, as the Hrdaya-siitra says, im lying that the one-pointed samadhi is absorption in the object, t . e ring in Lilapa's case. \\ Fixation of concentration is the initial stage in Lilapa's creative mode practice, fixed concentration indicates attainment of the center of the ma:p<).ala out of which the deities and their retinue emanate. Further, when the vision of the deities of the ma:p<).ala is transfixed, when every detail is in place and in focus, when the two central deities in union, and the sixteen yoginis of the retinue, shine radiantly in their own colors, this is an indication that the aim of the creative stage is achieved. The creative mode of meditation teaches the insubstantiality of form, that form is emptiness. The legend does not clarify the nature of Lilapa's fulfillment meditation, but if it is the simplest form of that mode, meditation upon emptiness itself, then the converse realization of \"form is emptiness\" arises-which is \"emptiness is form.\" With the union of creative and fulfillment modes, reality is the play of miiyii, the dance of the I;>akini in all her various moods and guises, the variety of divine-human potential, and the ideal expression of this vision is the Hevajra ma:p<).ala.

Her refusal angered Virupa, and with a harsh command he parted her waters and crossed to the other bank. In the town of Kanasata, Virupa entered a tavern. His hostess served him a flagon of alcohol and a plate of rice, which he vastly enjoyed. Then he demanded more to drink, then more and more until the tavern was dry. When the hostess asked him to settle his bill he pledged her the sun, thrusting his magical dagger, his phurba, between light and shade, transfixing the sun in the sky. For the next two and a half days Virupa continued drinking, consuming five hundred elephant-loads of spirits. By this time the King of Kanasata, unaware of Virupa's presence, was terrified; his ministers were helpless, unable to discover the cause of this disaster to their country. Finally the sun goddess herself appeared to the king in a dream, revealing that it was Virupa's debt to a woman in a tavern that bound her. The king paid the debt, and Virupa vanished. Virupa travelled on to the country of Indra, a land inhabited by brahmin extremists. Here he happened upon a monolithic image of Mahadeva, the Great God Siva, which stood six hundred and eighty feet high. The brahmin custodians demanded that Virupa bow down to this image. \"It is not proper for an elder brother to bow down to his junior,\" the master told them. The King of lndra, who by chance had come to worship at that time, supported his priests. \"You will be killed if you refuse,\" the King threatened."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Mahiisz'ddha Vz'rupa 47 \"It would be a sin for me to prostrate to this deity,\" Virupa in-sisted. \"Let the sin be upon mel\" said the King. Virupa placed his palms together in homage and the great stone image cracked down the middle, and a voice from heaven resound-ed, \"Master, I hear and obey!\" \"Swear your allegiance to the Buddha!\" commanded the master. Swearing an oath to protect the Word of Buddha, the fractured image became whole again. The offerings which Siva's devotees had brought him were then offered to Virupa, who gave them to the local devotees of Buddha, and it is said that those offerings have sus-tained the Buddhists to this day. From Indra Vinlpa wandered on to Devikotta in Eastern India. The people in the vicinity of Devikotta had all become flesh-eating witches. It was their practice to station one of their number on the road outside the town to cast spells upon unwary travellers, so that they could easily be captured come nightfall. Vinlpa, and also a brahmin boy who had passed by earlier, were bewitched on the road into town, where they both hoped to find food and lodging. The boy found food, and then he was directed by a helpful Buddhist to a temple at the end of town where he could sleep. \"All the people around here are witches,\" the Buddhist warned him. \"There are no human beings left. They all make trouble, but you can sleep in that temple over there.\" Virupa found the boy in the temple and blessed him with a pro-tective mantra before going to sleep. Meanwhile the witches had gathered to perform their rite of blood sacrifice. They had obtained animal flesh but none of the \"great meat\" of human beings. The sorcerer who had bewitched the two travellers on the road informed the assembly of his success, and immediately two of their number were sent to fetch the victims. Despite their persistent efforts the brahmin boy under the protection of Vinlpa's spell could not be moved, but Viriipa had laid down to sleep on a wooden plank and he was transported to the witches' circle upon it. Plying him with alcohol, they prepared their feast and then, inciting themselves to kill him, clasping their knives in readiness they began laughing with increasingly hysterical abandon. At this Viriipa himself began to laugh, but he laughed the terrible twelve-toned laugh of Heruka, a sound that made the witches' laughter seem like that of children at play, and they all lost consciousness in mortal fright. When they"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48 Masters of Mahamudra regained their senses the yogin extorted a vow from them that they take refuge in the Buddha and henceforth follow his teaching. \"If you retain the faith that I have instilled in you,\" Viriipa told them, \"you will come to no harm. But if you fail to renew your pledge daily, and if you neglect your practice of the Bodhisattva Vow, you will lose a cup of blood from your veins without damage to your body. And if you revert to any other god for refuge, turning away from the Buddha's law, this discus will sever your heads from your bodies, and the Demon of the North will suck your veins dry.\" It is said that even today the Discus and the Demon are visible as constellations of stars in the sky. With the witches of Devikona con-verted into oath-bound protectors of the Buddha's Word, Viriipa moved on to another country, but it was on a return visit to Deviko~~a some years later that Mahadeva, the Great God Siva, and Umadevi, his consort, created an illusion of a city of four and a half million households with which to honor Virupa and worship him with offerings. The food for the feast to celebrate his coming was brought from the Thirty-three Sensual Paradises and all the palaces of the gods. Vin1pa left behind him these autobiographical verses: In the great monastic academy of Somapurf I was ordained, and Uved a life of quz'et di'sdplz'ne.

Siidhana There. is nothing esoteric or obscure about Vin1pa's meditation practice. He practiced the ordinary creative mode of meditation upon the I;Jakini Vajra Varahi, the common form of the Guru's spiritual consort, who is also the consort of the deity Hevajra; he visualized her form while reciting her mantra. The obstacles he en-countered afflict every beginner in tantric meditation. It appears that his meditation was impeded by the tension of his striving, by thought-fonns19 intruding upon his concentration, and by his preconceptions as to the nature of the J)akini, the nature of reality in general and the results of his meditation. The instructive vision that broke the vicious circle20 in which he was trapped for twelve years was of the J)akini as an indetenninate21 inner reality; this vi-sion detached him from the thoughts that occluded his mind and led to his achievement of a thought-free state. This second occasion of the J)akini's appearance was brought about through Viriipa break-ing the pattern of his conscious striving and his conditioned thought-patterns by throwing away his rosary and giving up, simply relaxing into the nature of his mind22 which is nothing but the I;Jakini herself. The pure nature of mind is called a wish-fulfilling gem because mind's nature is the emptiness out of which all things arise merely by the conception of them, through the functions of sense perception or by thought. Historz\"ography The monastery in which Virii.pa spent twenty-five years as a monk, Somapuri, was one of the great monastic academies"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50 Masters of Mahamudra established in Eastern India by the Pala dynasty of Bangala (Bengal and Bihar). The Palas were munificent patrons of the Buddhist Tantra in general and of the siddhas in particular. Taranatha claims that King Devapiila (810-840) built Somapuri,u but it was probably built earlier by Dharmapala (770-810), who was a contem-porary of Viriipa. The monastery's exact location is uncertain; Om-pur in Bengal is a possible site. The mahiisiinghika order, to which most of the monastic followers of the mahayana belonged, was the order that Santarak~ita established in Tibet. Viriipa seems to have wandered extensively in eastern India. His birthplace Tripura (Radhakisorapura, the old capital of Tripura District, Assam,24 and Devikoga (Bangarh, Dinajpur District, Bengal)25 were names of Mother Goddess shrines (siikta-p~thas) in the inaccessible jungles of eastern India, where local tribal devotees of the Mother performed human sacrifice, as in Kamariipa.26 Viriipa is credited in this legend with converting these tribals to Buddhism; it was in Viriipa's era that Devikona became one of Cakrasarp.vara's twenty-four principal power-places.27 The story of Viriipa in Devikona is, perhaps, a confused report of the Thugs28 practice of waylaying travellers and sacrificing them to Kali (with the garrotte, not the knife) and the human sacrifice of the Mother's tribal devotees. 'Witch' is a translation of the Tibetan phra men (vetiila) that is more correctly a ghoul, a resurrected flesh-eating corpse, but in Tibetan literature such figures are more often low forms of J;>akini, powerful, negatively-charged female beings skilled in black magic and particularly in casting spells. In Taranatha's story of Viriipa in Devikotta, 29 (iiikin'i and phra men are used interchangeably. In that legend Viriipa is given a lotus and a cowrie (both sexual symbols), which mark him as the (iiikinis' prize. With the help of a Buddhist he flees to Sri Parvata mountain where Nagabodhi teaches him the psycho-experimental techniques of the deity Yamari (Yamantaka), the principal of many classes of minor spirits and a dominant ar-chetype that controls neurotic and disordered powers of the psyche through an awareness of the ultimate insubstantiality of apparently discrete entities. Viriipa returns to Devikoga armed with Yamari's powers and thwarts the r;liikin'is' attempts to consume him, binding them to the Buddha-dharma. No mention is made in our legend of Viriipa's undoubted interest in Yamari. To Viriipa is ascribed"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Virupa 51 discovery of the Rakta-yamiiri-tantra, and also authorship of a liturgical ritual sadhana associated with the same tantra. The manner in which Virftpa converts the inhabitants of Devikoga and also Mahadeva in Indra, and the phraseology employed, is reminiscent of the legends of Virftpa's contemporary siddha, Padmasambhava, converting the Bonpos and the gods of Tibet. Such power to bind the mind to the Buddha's truth is demonstrated only by Buddha emanations (nirmii:tJakiiya). The psychological assumptions are that first the master's threat has suffi-cient force to deter the convert from breaking his vows to practice refuge in Buddha and the Bodhisattva Vow; and secondly, that once such basic exercises have born fruit, realization of the nature of all things as void automatically fulfills the vow, rendering any conscious formula superfluous. A clear impression of Viriipa's travels, and the variety and number of his magical exploits, can be gained from Taranatha's Seven Lineages. 30 But the historiographical inadequacy of this text with its contradictions of the older sources, and evident mixture of sources, becomes abundantly apparent. However the following pieces of information are relevant to our legends: Viriipa is de-scribed within the context of the lineage of the Yoginl Ca\\}Q.ika (T. gTu mo, \"The Mystic Heat\"); he is also known as Sridharmapala; the monastery from which he was expelled is given as Nalanda; the land of his excessive drinking scenario was Orissa; and there are similarities between the story of the split image of Siva in our legend . and Viriipa's activity at Somanath, the internationally famed monolithic statue of Mahadeva in Saura~tra, which was destroyed in AD 1015 by Muslim invaders. According to Tiiranatha, after J;)ombi Heruka his chief disciple was OQ.Q.iyii\\}a-born Kala Viriipa, who earned his epithet Black (Kala) because he was fated to kill a brahmin and a cow, and like Oedipus to have sexual intercourse with his mother. There is no space here to describe and compare all the legends and anecdotes concerning Viriipa. He is one of the sid-dhas for whom there is no lack of legendary material. Viriipa's principal Guru was certainly Nagabodhi, Niigarjuna's disciple, from whom he received the Yamari mantra on Sri Parvata. 81 A survey of Tibetan sources, 32 however, lists these Gurus of Viriipa: Aryadeva, the disciple of Niigarjuna; Asanga, while Viriipa's disciple is Siintarak~ita; Dharmamitra, Viriipa's preceptor"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"52 Masters of Mahamudra at Nalanda; and Dharmapala, a Niilanda siddha-but there were several Dharmapalas, none of whom achieved pre-eminence. We know that I;>ombi Heruka was Vinipa's chief disciple, and if Virupa, therefore, lived during the latter part of the eighth century and the first part of the ninth, besides Nagabodhi both Aryadeva and Dhar-map~ila could have taught him. The lineage of Viiriihi's Six Topics (Phag mo gzhung drug) tells us that a Virupa took instruction from Lak~minkara and taught Maitripa. 88 At the end of the ninth century a Virupa was taught by Anangavajra84 and received the Mahiikarut;tika-tantra from Kam-bala, and this Virupa II could have been taught by Lak~minkara, Indrabhuti's sister. However, Maitripa, a contemporary of Naropa, was taught by Virupa, and it could have been this Virupa the Younger who received Viiriihi's Six Topics from Lak~mi the Great of Kashmir. This eleventh century Virupa also taught Vyac;lhalipa (see p. 59) and Marpa the Translator; he could also have been a niith, whose Guru Nangopa was taught by Vain'iginath, a name of Aryadeva. 35 Vinipa is revered as. the First Lama, or adi-guru, of the \"path as goal\"36 school and lineage, which is the Sakya sect's summum bonum, their equivalent of Mahamudra. During the latter part of the Sakya ascendancy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, beautifully crafted bronze sculptures of Vin1pa were cast in Sakya in Western Tibet; with the exception of statues of Nagarjuna three dimensional representations of the siddhas are quite rare. There is no etymology to explain why Virftpa, \"He of manifold forms,\" was called such. The name was not translated into Tibetan, and since the Tibetans do not pronounce the letter v, he is known to them as Birupa, Bi ru byed pa(?), Birwapa, Bhirbapa; etc. The epithet \"Master of I;>akinis\" is taken from the caption of a Tibetan line-drawing."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"4 THE MAHASIDDHA DOMBIPA . THE TIGER-RIDER The philosopher's stone Turns z'ron z'nto gold; The innate power of the Great Jewel Converts passion into pure awareness. Dombipa was a king of Magadha. He was initiated by the Guru Virupa into the ma~~ala of the Buddha-deity Hevajra. Through practice of the meditation rites of Hevajra he experienced the deity's reality and attained his realization and magical power. The enlightened king regarded his subjects as a father treats his only son, but his people had no idea that their king was an initiate of the mysteries. However, they all agreed that he was an honest man with an innate propensity to treat his subjects kindly. The king conceived a scheme to drive fear and want from his kingdom. He summoned his minister, charging him in this way: \"Our country is plagued by thieves and bandits, and due to past neglect our karma has burdened us with much poverty. To protect us from fear and want, cast a great bronze bell and hang it from the branch of a strong tree. Whenever you see danger or poverty, strike the bell.\" The minister fulfilled the king's command, and while the king reigned, Magadha was free of crime, famine, plague and poverty. Some time later a wandering band of minstrels arrived in the city to sing and dance for the king. One of the minstrels had a twelve year-old daughter, an innocent virgin untainted by the sordid world about her.

We are low-caste wretches, reviled and shunned by all. How could you even think of such a thing?\" The king insisted. He gave the minstrel the girl's weight in gold and took her to serve as his mystic consort. For many years he kept her hidden, but in the twelfth year her existence became known. \"The king is consorting with an outcast woman,\" was the rumor that spread like wild-fire across the kingdom, and despite his previous benevolence the king's conduct was not tolerated by the establishment. He was forced to abdicate. Entrusting his kingdom to his son and ministers he departed for the jungle with his low-caste mistress, and in an idyllic hermitage in solitude they continued practicing their tantric yoga for a further twelve years. Meanwhile the kingdom was misgoverned. The quality of life diminished as virtue ebbed to a low level. A council agreed to re-quest the old king to return to govern, and a delegation was sent into the jungle to find him. When they eventually found the hermitage, from a distance they saw the king sitting under a tree while his con-sort walked upon lotus leaves to the middle of a pond, where she drew cool nectar from a depth of fifteen fathoms before returning to offer it to her lord. The watchers were amazed, and returned im-mediately to the city to report what they had seen. Then another delegation was sent with the people's invitation, and the king ac-cepted it, agreeing to return. The king, in union with his consort, came riding out of the jungle on the back of a pregnant tigress, brandishing a deadly snake as a whip. After the people had overcome their fear and astonishment they begged him to take up the reigns of government again. \"I have lost my own caste status by consorting with an outcast woman,\" the king told them. \"It is not proper for me to resume my original position.

At this point the last vestiges of doubt were remov-ed from the minds of the men of Magadha, and they began to call their king the master J;>ombipa, which means Lord of the J;>ombi. Stepping out of the fire the king addressed the ministers and all of his people of the four castes. \"If you emulate me, 1 shall stay to govern you. If you will not help yourselves, 1 shall not remain to govern you.\" The people were shocked, and remonstrated, saying, \"How is that possible?\" \"How can we give up our homes and families?\" \"We are not yoginsl\" Then the king addressed them again. \"Political power is of little benefit and the retribution is great. Those who wield authority can do little good, and more often than not the damage that flows from their actions leads to misery for all in the long run.

After this initial anecdote illustrating the king's benevolence, the bulk of J;>ombipa's legend concerns his sex-ual sadhana and caste problems. Inter-caste miscegenation was forbidden for the twice-born castes, and the penalty for breaking this taboo was loss of caste, which meant social ostracism.

Rather, for the tantrika, the mind-set, preconceptions and pre-judices of caste-consciousness, comprise a paradigm of the social conditioning that must be eradicated if Buddhahood is to be achieved. Just as we can lose our racial prejudice by marrying a partner belonging to another race, the siddhas took consorts from outcast communities to cultivate the awareness of non-discrimination. Further, in the same way that pride is destroyed by entering into the essence of humiliation, passion dissolves by cultivating sexual desire in the framework of a fulfillment yoga and penetrating its essence. It should be said that the popularity of I;>om-bi, Sahara and Ca:vc;lala consorts depended to some extent upon availability. No matter what the original caste status of a bone-garlanded yogin, few women of high caste would be associated with him. The I;>ombis were wandering minstrels and musicians. 37 The age of I;>ombipa's consort, twelve, signifies maturity, or perfection; sixteen is the actual age when a girl is ripe according to the Kiimasiitra, which places padmini at the top of a fourfold classifica-tion of the ideal girl's physical attributes. Mudrii38 is the term used to describe I;>ombipa's \"mystic consort.\" On the sensual plane she is the \"other body, \"89 the karma-mudrii, employed in sexual yoga. On the non-dual, ultimate level she is the jiiiina-mudrii, the \"seal of awareness\" stamped upon every experience of body, speech and mind. I;>ombipa's consort was Vajra Varahi to his own Hevajra (although another source calls her Cinta, 40 the sahaja-yoginf of Hevajra's retinue). The precise nature of their jungle meditation is omitted, but probably it was the yoga of uniting pleasure and emp-tiness. Practicing a form of coitus interruptus and retention of semen, the energy generated is sublimated, vitalizing the psycho-organism's focal points of energy, raising the level of sensual pleasure to the point where dualistic functions of mind are over-whelmed and the non-dual pure awareness of the Buddha shines through. The kup,{ialinf rises from the sexual cakra, through the four levels of joy and the four higher cakras, to consummate Bud-dhahood in the fontanelle center (see p. 217).

The \"cow-head\" sandalwood41 of the pyre upon which they were burnt is a highly scented, sacred wood usually employed for carving images and anointing saints. It is interesting to consider the implications of I;>ombipa's final judgement upon political involvement. In his early years as an enlightened king like Lilapa, he used his situation to fulfill the Bodhisattva Vow of selfless service, and, like the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, he took upon himself the misfortunes of beings and the negative karma of wielding authority and power. Finally, however, when his people plead incapacity to emulate the master he refuses to rule them and dissolves into the I;>akini's Paradise. We may infer from this that the renunciate yogin's path is ultimately superior to living in the world-if the choice is possible. In the same key, I;>ombipa could have claimed that he never indulged in sexual pleasure, his practice with his consort being a highly ascetic practice in which transcendence of sexual involvement was the path to mahamudra-sz'ddht'.

His account is substantially the same as our legend until I;>ombi returns to his kingdom at the insistence of his people. After teaching his own people he wandered afar with his consort, demonstrating his magical power for the benefit of others. In Rac;lha48 he flew across the city mounted on his tiger, threatening the king and citizens with venomous snakes, forcing them to take refuge in the Buddha (thus the descriptive epithet Tiger-Rider). In Karnataka, in South· India, he taught five hundred yogins and yoginis in a cremation ground, and all except one, who violated the samaya, gained siddht'. Also in the South, he coerced a people who built sacrifical mounds of animals' hearts as offering to renounce animal sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Mahasiddha J)ombz\"pa 59 Taranatha lists l)ombipa's ten disciples:•• amongst them are Alalavajra, Garbaripa, Jayasri, and Rahulavajra.

On the slopes of the Vikrama Peak in the rugged Mantra moun· tain chain, lived a hunter called Savaripa. Savaripa's karma was cursed. The hunter's survival depends on taking life, and killing animals and eating their flesh for sustenance results in a rebirth such as that of a hunter; he kills to survive and survives to kill. Seeing his plight, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Lokesvara, took pity on Savaripa, and in order to release him from the vicious circle of his karma he emanated an apparitional hunter similar to Savaripa. The Bodhisattva met the hunter on the road. \"Who are you?\" asked the hunter suspiciously. \"I am a hunter like you,\" the Bodhisattva told him. \"Where are you from?\" asked Savaripa. \"Oh, very far away,\" was the evasive reply. \"How many deer can you shoot with a single arrow?\" Savaripa was very proud of his extraordinary ability with a bow and arrow. \"Three hundred or so,\" said the Bodhisattva.

So the Bodhisattva shot one hundred deer with a single arrow, and then he asked the hunter to carry one home for him. When Savaripa could not lift the weight, his pride suddenly broke. When they reached home Savaripa begged the Bodhisattva to teach him how to shoot as he did. Lokesvara promised to do so, but he stipulated that Savaripa should not eat meat for a month. The hunter and his wife became vegetarians, abandoning their life-long habit of killing animals. The Bodhisattva returned after only a week, and discovering that they were obeying his injunction, he told Savaripa that if he wanted archery instruction he should con-template loving kindness and compassion for all living creatures in addition to renouncing meat-eating. The Bodhisattva's inducement was sufficient to make the hunter agree unhesitatingly. When the month had passed and the Bodhisattva returned Savaripa greeted him eagerly. But Loke5vara first drew a ma:vc;lala for the hunter and his wife, and after strewing flowers upon it he in-vited them to gaze into it. \"What do you see?\" he asked them. Looking into the magic circle they saw themselves burning in the eight great hells, and paralyzed with horror they could not speak. \"What do you see? What do you see?\" repeated the Bodhisattva. \"Ourselves, burning in hell!\" Savaripa finally exclaimed. \"Aren't you afraid?\" he asked. \"Yes, afraid,\" whispered Savaripa. \"Do you want to know how to avoid it?\" \"Surely,\" replied the hunter. \"But are you able to do what is necessary?\" Receiving a final affirmation, the Bodhisattva began to explain the basic tenets of the Buddha's doctrine. \"The inevitable long-term effect of taking life is rebirth in a human hell.

In that way Lokesvara taught them the karmic effects of virtue and vice, the ten virtuous actions and their antitheses, showing them the inevitable retribution that results from unpropitious acts and the benefits of a meritorious mode of existence. Gaining insight into the state of pain inherent in the wheel of life, and feeling remorse and disgust for the way he had lived, Savaripa was inspired to irre-versible faith in the path of the Buddhas. Lokesvara gave him a full-time sadhana to practice, and sent him to the Danti Mountain to meditate. For twelve years Savaripa meditated upon undirected and unstructured sublime compassion in a thought-free state,and he at-tained the supreme realization of Mahamudra. Then one day, awakening out of his samadhi of sublime compas-sion, he sought his Guru, the Bodhisattva Lokesvara. When he found him the Guru praised his achievement profusely, and then he gave him further instruction. \"0 lucky man! Your supreme nirvii1;1a is not the nirvaJ).a of those who with single-minded purpose ex-tinguish root passion and, finally, life itself, like shepherds putting out a grass fire. You must stay on the wheel of life for the sake of all those bound to it. Your aim should be to release an infinite number of people.\" Savaripa returned to his own country and stayed there. He was called by three different names: Savaripa (\"A man of the Savara tribe\"), Mapjigochen (\"He arrayed in peacock feathers\"), and Ritro Gompo (\"Guardian of the mountain hermitage\"). He transmits his meaning to those with propitious karma through song and dance, sound and symbol, and he will stay on earth until Maitreya, the Buddha of Love, the next Buddha, appears and teaches the gospel of the new age.

Savaripa's explanation details four technical forms of kar-mic effect: maturation of the act, conditioned reaction propensity, conditioned rebound potential, and social effect.49 Several other types of causal relationship are elucidated in the doctrine of karma, but they are omitted here. Loke8vara's precepts that induce a thoughtless trance of sublime compassion50 belong to the non-dual Tantra, and the result is the transcendent nirvana (mahiinirviitta) not the hinayana nirva:pa of extinction. After he had attained this supreme nirva:pa, Savaripa's sadhana was to emulate Lokesvara, who emanated his eleven-headed thousand-armed form, called Sublime Compassion, Mahakarii:pika,51 to aid innumerable beings simultaneously, vowing not to enter the nirva:pa of extinction until all creatures could ac-company him.

The Sabaras were a wild, aboriginal, outcast, hunting and gathering tribe from the Vindhya Hills and perhaps also from the Deccan: thus \"Savaripa, The Hunter.\" As the Sabaras were well-known to the eastern Indian siddhas, it is reasonable to assume that the Man-tra (or Ma:.;H;la) Range and the Vikrama Peak are in the eastern Vin-dhyas, which stretch across India south of the Ganges plains. Bu ston took Mantra Vikrama as a corruption of manavikrama, \"restoration of mind, \"52 but Savaripa's birthplace would still be in the eastern Vindhya hills. The Sabaras were an untouchable people even lower than the J;>ombis and Ca:pc,lalas on the social ladder. \"The most archaic level of tantric worship is represented in the Kiidambart by the wild Sahara tribe of the Vindhya forest whose 'one religion is offering human flesh' to· Ca:pc,lika and whose chief had shoulders that 'were rough with scars from keen weapons often used to make an offering of blood to Ca:pc,lika.' \"58 The Sabaras were also \"corpse-workers\" in Bengal, but this may have been later.

She has peacock feathers on her head and a garland of gafija around her neck. Her dear Sahara is mad, intoxicated by love for her. \"54 Sahara should not be identified with Savaripa. The jungle Sabaras wear peacock feathers as their emblem, and gafija (marijuana) has special significance for them. Associated with the Sabaras is the im-age of a yogin crazed with sexual passion for his Saban consort, in-toxicated from smoking gafija, covered in ashes and drinking alcohol from a skull-cup. For Saraha this image is a metaphor for Buddhist tantric practice. The emanation of A valokite§vara in the text should be considered as Saraha. Saraha was Savaripa's principal, Sarpvara Guru and Savaripa was known as Saraha the Younger. But another Sarpvara lineage has: Saraha, Nagarjupa, Savaripa, and then Luipa, who was Savaripa's principal disciple.55 Jogipa (53), Sarvabhak~a (75) and (Bhava) Bhadrapa (see 24), were also taught by him. Sakara (74) should be considered as a disciple of the second Savaripa, a contem-porary of Naropa, who taught Maitripa. This second Savaripa is still rather amorphous; it is easy to envision a succession of yogins born in the Sahara tribe. Vibhuticandra, and even fifteenth century Van;mratna, were taught by \"Savaripa.\" Both Savaripas are known to the Tibetans as Savari dBang phyug (Savaresvara).

Although tutored in brahmin law he followed the path of the Bud-dhas, and he received instruction in the tantric mysteries from many Buddhist masters. He observed the laws of the brahmins by day and maintained his Buddhist vows at night. Also, he was a drinker, and eventually he ran foul of his fellow brahmins' rigorous orthodoxy. They accused him of drinking, and before their king, Ratnapala, they demanded that he should be outcast. \"You are a great king,\" the brahmins told their king, \"and you are responsible for the purity of religion in your country. This Saraha, lord of the fifteen thousand households of Roli, dishonors his caste by drinking alcohol. We entreat you to exile him.\" \"I cannot exile the lord of fifteen thousand households,\" replied the king. Later the king visited Saraha privately and upbraided him, telling him that his drinking habit was unacceptable. \"I do not drink,\" Saraha told him, \"and if you doubt it, assemble the brahmins and the people and I will prove it.\" When the people were assembled Saraha subjected himself to trial to prove his innocence. \"If I am guilty may my hand burn!\" he declared, plunging his hand into a vat of boiling oil.

Still protesting his innocence, Saraha took up a bowl of molten copper and drank it at one gulp. His throat was unburned. \"We know he drinks!\" shouted the brahmins. \"Let one of you jump into this tank of water with me,\" Saraha challenged. \"Whoever sinks is guilty.\" A brahmin volunteer jumped into the tank with Saraha, and it was the brahmin who sank to the bottom immediately. \"I do not drink!\" Saraha stated categorically. \"Weigh the two of us, and whoever is the lighter is guilty.\" The scale showed that Saraha was heavier. \"If he has this kind of power, let him drink,\" the king ordained, and together with the brahmins he bowed down before Saraha, beg-ging him to impart the secret of his power. Saraha than sang three series of didactic songs, one to the king, one to the queen and one to the people. These songs became famous as The Three Cycles of Dohiis. The Roli brahmins abandoned their traditional practices and entered the path of the Buddhas; the king and his court eventually attained Buddhahood. Saraha married a fifteen year old girl and, leaving his home, he took her to another country. There they settled in an isolated place, and while the master practiced his sadhana the girl fulfilled his needs and went out begging. One day he asked her to cook him radish curry. With care she prepared it with buffalo milk-curd and then brought it to him, but as he was sitting in meditation she quiet-ly withdrew. Saraha was to remain in samadhi for twelve years, but as soon as he awakened to the outside world he shouted to his wife for the radish curry. \"You sit in samadhi for twelve years and the first thing you ask for is radish curry?\" retorted his consort incredulously. \"It is now sum-mertime and radishes are out of season.\" Saraha was abashed by her words. He decided to move to the mountains to continue his meditation. \"Physical isolation is not real solitude,\" his consort instructed him. \"The best kind of solitude is complete escape from the preconceptions and prejudices of an inflexible and narrow mind, and, moreover, from all labels and concepts. If you awaken from a twelve year samadhi and are still clinging to a desire for your twelve year old curry, what is the point of going to the mountains?\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Saraha 69 Saraha listened to his wife. Thereafter he devoted himself to rid-ding his mind of conceptual thought and belief in the substantiality of objective reality, cultivating the experience of all things as their original, primal purity. Achieving the mystic experience of all things as space he attained the supreme realization of Mahamudra. Saraha lived a life of boundless seJfless service to others, until, finally, with his consort, he attained the I;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana It is possible to infer from the first part of this legend of Saraha that the master is teaching transcendence of both truth and falsehood, and that in his self-ordained ordeal he is demonstrating that all phenomena are delusory and that there is no truth anywhere (see Thaganapa, p. 138). If Saraha is not demonstrating magical power in order to convert the king and his court, what purpose can there be in proving that black is white and that he does not drink, except to humiliate his enemies? Whatever his purpose The Great Brahmin, a I;>aka-wizard, shows his control over the elements, par-ticularly fire (heat) and earth (weight). In other words the siddha's consciousness penetrated the seeds of karmic manifestation and altered the usual process of illusory emanation at will. In the West this phenomenon is described in terms of \"mind over matter\" rather than as an example of creative awareness influencing mental phenomena. The notion of a discrete, subjective mind affecting a substantial, discrete object by will is, naturally, very hard to credit; tantric metaphysics make extrasensory phenomena immediately credible. The \"laws of nature\" should be considered as habits of mentation and modes of illusory manifestation conditioned in man from the beginning. When a yogin enters the sphere of his uncondi-tioned being and reprograms the elemental, materiality-producing forces (solidity, fluidity, heat and motion; \"earth, water, fire and air\"), which reside in potential in the vital energy (priitta) of the body, he can create illusions \"contrary to nature.\" Thus Saraha's manipulation of temperature and weight are small effects produced by a profound siddht', the mundane siddhi called magical power. The Three Cycles of Dohiis are Saraha's best known works. 56 Each cycle consists of more than one hundred stanzas in the Apabhrmp~a language, in the dohii metrical form. In natural and humanistic simile and metaphor the poet indicates the nature of Mahamudrii and the manner of attaining it by means of sahojayiina, \"the vehicle"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"70 Masters of Mahamudrii of the inborn absolute.\" Bengali scholars believe that Saraha in-itiated a separate school of yoga employing sahaja as the means and thb end; but no such separate school existed in Tibet. He uses the term sahaja in his Three Cycles of Dohiis and in many of his other Dohiis (the metrical form has given its name to a genre of verse not always composed in the dohii meter) when he is not treating the fulfillment process of meditation in twilight language; it is always used within the context of Mahamudra. In Hindu tantric schools sahajayiina has come to imply a way of attaining siddhiwithout real· ly trying, a way of attaining god-realization through indulgence in sensual pleasure with the certainty that coincident with every instant of perception is the empty, ultimate ingredient of ecstacy that is sahaja. Saraha taught the most pure, uncompromising and formless precepts of the Highest Tantra (anuttarayoga·tantra), rejecting most orthodox forms of religious practice and many tantric forms too. It takes a very subtle mind to grasp his meaning and method, and oral and mind transmission is imperative-\"Seek for sahaja nowhere but on the lips of the Guru,\" he sings. It is easy (sahaja) to fall prey to the glib precept declaring that we need not meditate nor perform any yoga practice at all because the starting point is the goal, and that we are, in reality, Buddhas as we stand; but it is im-mensely difficult to sustain the belief in oneself as a Buddha in the presence of the Guru. Sahaja is only one of the original notions that Saraha sings of in his dohiis, and it is as much for the content of his songs as for the beauty of imagery and style that he is recognized as one of India's great poets. With his status as poet and as adi-guru, or First Guru of the Sa:rp.vara according to Saraha's method, Saraha lays claim to being the pre-eminent mahasiddha. The second part of the legend, the anecdote of the radish curry, introduces Saraha's I;>akini-guru. It was his wife, the I;>akini, who indicated to Saraha the state of being called Mahamudra that is a quantum dimension superior to ordinary trance states. The radish curry is a metaphor for the naive, dualistic concepts and preconceptions57 that we project upon inchoate, non-dual reality, and which cannot be eradicated by passive samadhis. No matter how high a level of consciousness is achieved in the formless realm, and regardless of the intensity or duration of bliss, meditations which take the yogin into the oasis of a pure-land, into a temporary respite from sa:rp.sara (such as samatha, certain forms of za-zen, Transcendental Meditation, and so many more), are red herrings if"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Mahiis£ddha Saraha 71 the goal is Mahamudra. It is not explicitly stated how Saraha arrived at the de-conditioned state of experiencing all things as space, but with some imagination we can see Saraha's remarkable J)akini-consort putting her Guru through the mill of tantric brain-washing. One extraordinary example of a non-meditational mode of erasing beliefs about reality from the mind is the method of self-denial imposed by Tilopa upon Naropa (20). Each Guru-disciple couple works to discover the most effective skillful devices to ac-complish the same end. Ego defenses inevitably make the process painful. But if it is successful, after complete disorientation, and after the concepts which compose our common-sense view of reality have been eradicated, the mystical experience of primally pure reality should dominate continuously. Hzstorz'ography Other versions of Saraha's legend feature an arrowsmith's daughter who becomes the master's I;>akini-Guru and Consort. The potential scope for didactic symbolism· in the arrowsmith's craft makes the omission herein of Saraha's initial encounter with his l;)akini all the more unaccountable. The arrow that Saraha is usual-ly depicted as holding represents the gnostic awareness that pierces the heart of duality (belief in the ultimate existence of discrete sub-ject and object). \"Saraha\" translates as \"The Archer\" (sara= arrow, ha(n) =to have shot; T. mDa' bsnun). If the more popular versions of Saraha's legend are to be believed, then the two parts of our story should be reversed in order, for in other sources King Ratnapala was provoked into prosecuting Saraha for cohabiting with a low-caste woman, the arrowsmith's daughter. With such a reversal Saraha would deliver his Cycles of Dohiis after his ultimate enlightenment. · The historical stature of the Great Brahmin Saraha is reduced by the lack of any substantial biographical data concerning him. As First Guru of the Mahamudra and Satp.vara lineages he is the cor· nerstone of the siddha tradition; but we have no evidence that con-firms his dates. However, by establishing that his lineal successors were contemporaries of King Devap~la (AD 810-850), and associating him with the start of the renaissance of Buddhism in the Pal a Empire, particularly at Nalanda, during the lifetime of the sec-ond great Pala Emperor, Dharmapala (AD 770-810), we can agree with the conclusion of the great Bihari Tibetologist Rahula Satikrtyayana and place Saraha in the second half of the eighth cen-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"72 Masters of Mahamudni tury and the beginning of the ninth. 58 His birthplace, Rajfti accord-ing to the legend, was probably in Orissa and not in the South; the Saraha, or Rahulabhadra (see p. 255), who was Guru of the first Nagarjuna, was probably born in the South. King Ratnapala of our legend can only have been a petty Orian raja. Finally, Saraha was probably educated at Nalanda and became abbot there, teaching the greatest of the latter-day Nagarjunas. \"The Great Brahmin Saraha was the first to introduce Mahamudra as the chief of all paths, \"59 although it had existed as part of the praxis of other tantras, and he initiated the Satp,vara-tantra; but other than his eternal Mahamudra dohiis and the rather obscure Buddha-kapala-tantra, he wrote, or revealed, little. There is no work relating to the Satp,vara-tantra above Saraha's name in the Tenjur. Saraha's relationship with the South may be a clue to the provenance of the Satp,vara-tantra: his Guru in the GuhyasamiiJa-tantra, Visukalpa, lived there; Saraha's disciple Savaripa stayed on Sri Parvata; and Saraha himself is associated with the tantric Pithasthiina of Sri Parvata. This sacred mountain is the Srisailam power place (not Nagarjunako~da where the early Saraha could have lived), a haunt of alchemists, Nagarjuna amongst them. If he did not obtain the Satp,vara-tantra in the South, it is also possible that Vajrayogini revealed it to him in eastern India, in which case his inspiration could have been eastern siikta tantrikas. Liiipa, the initiator of the other principal Sarpvara tradition a generation later, could have had the same sources (but seep. 37). It is significant that Saraha's Dzokchen contemporaries in the North-west did not take a Satp,vara-tantra to Tibet, although Mahamudra was part of their vocabularies. Whatever the Satp,vara-tantra's origin, Saraha's famous lineage-Savaripa, Liiipa, 1)e:tigipa, Vajragha~~a, Kambala, Jalandhara, Kr~~acarya, Vi-jayapada, Tilopa, N aropa-provided the tradition that Marpa the Translator took to Tibet, and that Milarepa and a host of Tibetan siddhas used as their means to obtain siddhi. Apart from Visukalpa, Saraha's Guhyasamaja preceptor, and his consort, the Arrow-making 1)akini, we know that Acarya Haribhadra taught Saraha the miidhyamika tradition of San-tarak~ita and the prafiiiipiiramitii at Nalanda, and also that Bud-dhajii.ana taught him the mahayana.60 His principal disciples were Nagarjuna and Savaripa; Sarvabhak~a (7.5), and perhaps Bhavabhadra, were also taught by him."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"7 THE SIDDHA KANKARIPA THE LOVELORN WIDOWER My .{Jakz'nf-woman, my queen, my lady!

Thus he entered into meditation, and after six years had passed all thought of his dead wife as a woman of flesh and blood had become a state of pleasure and emptiness. The clouds in his mind dissolved, and the experience of the clear light of pure pleasure arose within him. Just like the poison dhatura leaving the mind and taking with it all hallucination and delusion, the poison of bewilderment and unknowing left his being, and he saw the reality of unalterable truth.

In-deed, Fish-lord (Minanath or its linguistic variants Macchendranath or Matsyendranath) may have been an epithet of realized yogins employed like Avadhuti or Aciiitapa. 69 Hz'storz'ography The historical Minapa is difficult to identify. But since Mina, Macchendra and Matsyendra are the same name in different languages and dialects, we assume that we are dealing with only one siddha. This was a Bengali, a fisherman, an adt'-guru who received tantric revelation directly from Siva; he taught principally in Kamariipa, and was Gorak~a's Guru. Further, this one siddha, Minapa, is found in the lineages of Buddhists, saz'vas and siiktas alike. During this period there was little or no sectarianism, and a siddha could accept initiation and practice the instruction of Bud-dhist, saz'va and siikta Gurus concurrently or consecutively. Although this may have led to some exchange of metaphysics and techniques between lineages, doctrines and yogas remained separate.

Macchendra received the instruction on the Kaulajiiiina-m\"rnaya in the manner related in our legend, except that it was Uma in the form of Gauri who requested it; or, according to a different story, the brahmin fisherman Minanath recovered it from the sea after Siva's son Karttikeya, in the form of a mouse, had stolen it and thrown it away. The goal of kaula-miirga, the path of saki£, is the union of Kula (Sakti) with Akula (Siva); this is attained with the ritual assistance of a circle of yoginis (yogini-kaula). ?o Taranatha introduces the following variations in his legend of Minapa:11 Mahadeva was teaching Uma on the hill known as Umagiri on the banks of the Brahmaputra when Minapa in his fish lay in the river close by; the teaching consisted of instruction on the movement of psychic energy (priirta). Then, with material evidently taken from a different source, Taranatha describes how the fisher-man, released from the fish's belly, obtains a \"son\" and how they go together to the Guru Carpati ( 64) for further instruction and become known as Minapa and Macchendrapa respectively. Minapa becomes the Guru of Halipa, Malipa and Tibolipa, and the son, Macchendrapa is the Guru of Gorak~a and Caurangi. It is probable that the introduction of Minapa's disciple, Macchendra, was Taranatha's device to explain away the two names, and to give the saz'va and Buddhist lineages separate adz'-gurus. In later, Nepali legends, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara Pad-mapa:J.li taught Siva the science of yoga, and then in human form as Macchendra, listened to Siva teaching Parvati (Uma) while in the fish. Then later while Macchendra disported himself with the yoginis in Kamariipa (or Sri Lanka), a famine occurred in Nepal, and since Macchendra was the only siddha capable of bringing rain, King Narendradeva sent his minister, a siddha, to fetch the Guru. Macchendra granted the minister a boon and promised to go to Nepal. Upon his arrival he told Narendradeva that he would return soon as a bumble bee. In due course, one night a bee appeared, and after its capture it rained immediately. The minister created an im-age of the Guru by mantra, and this image became the protecting deity of Nepal.

The father-son relation-ship that exists between Macchendra and Mina in Nepal (the reverse of Taranatha's names), is probably that of an older image and younger tradition of worship rather than of a lineal Guru-disciple relationship. Minapa's chief disciple was Gorak~a (Gorakhnath), who was the founding Guru of the niith yogi sampradiiya, and thus Minapa is worshipped as the original human Guru of the niith lineages. Since Gorak~a probably lived in the tenth century, Minapa can be placed in the same period.

When he was old enough he was hired out. as a cowherd by his father. One day he was lying down with some other cowherd boys as the cows grazed amongst the trees when the mahasiddha Minapa, also known as Acititapa, approached. \"Do you see the vultures circling over there?\" the Guru asked the boys. \"A young prince who has had all his arms and legs cut off is lying against a tree, dying. Who will care for him and save his life?\" \"I will!\" responded Gorak~a immediately. \"But while I go now to see for myself, doing your work for you, you stay here and do mine.\" So Minapa watched the herd, and the boy ran to find the prince, using the vultures as a guide. The prince was lying against the trunk of a tree as the Guru had described. \"It is as you say,\" said Gorak~a, after he had returned. \"How will you feed him?\" asked the Guru. \"The . owner of my herd gives me food and drink morning and evening,\" the boy replied. \"I'll give the prince half of my food.\" \"Very good!\" the Guru praised him. \"Take care of him so that he"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"82 Masters of Mahamudra can perform the four basic functions of life (caturii1igz)-eating, drinking, sleeping and excreting.\" He then left. The boy constructed a leaf-covered shelter around the tree. He went daily to take food and to feed the prince, to remove with his own hands his accumulated excrement, and to wash his body. For twelve years he performed these services for the prince, assisting him in every way. One day, Gorak~a, now a young man, arrived at the prince's tree as usual and was dumbfounded to see the prince standing upright on his own two legs. He learned that the prince had been practicing a yoga that Minapa had taught him, and that the fruit of that prac-tice had now given him regenerated limbs. Levitating into the air the prince offered to teach Gorak~a how to meditate. \"I do not need your instruction,\" Gorak~a told him. \"I already have a Guru. It was he who told me to serve you, and I have simply obeyed his instructions.\" And he returned to mind his herd and to await Minapa. When his Guru appeared, Gorak~a told him how he had served the prince and what he had seen when he last attended him. The Guru was delighted. He gave Gorak~a initiation and empowerment and explained the precepts he should practice. Then he moved on to another country. Through his meditation according to Minapa's in-struction, Gorak~a attained ordinary, mundane mahiimudrii-siddhi. As soon as the signs of achievement appeared he went in search of his Guru, but when he found Minapa his Guru told him that he would not attain complete awakening and the purity of Bud-dhahood until he had liberated one hundred million beings. Gorak~a began by initiating and instructing everyone who would listen to him, but Mahadeva reproved him. \"Instruct only those who request it,\" the god ordained. \"And do not initiate those who lack faith and understanding.\" Thereafter Gorak~a taught only those people whose karma had prepared them for initiation, but even so he liberated multitudes of people. Until this day those who are ready can receive initiation, and at propitious times those who are pure in mind can hear his drum, though to others he remains silent and in-visible. His name, Gorak~a, means Protector of the Herd. Siidhana Minapa believed that his karma in previous lives created the"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Niith Siddha Gorak~a 83 enlightenment-situation through which he gained mahiimudrii-siddhi. In his song of realization Gorak~a expresses his credo that no matter what our spiritual and social status, regardless of the hand life deals us, it is possible to use the situation to attain our ultimate end, and by so doing to transform even seemingly negative situations into elements of a positive karmic flow that culminates in enlighten-ment. Of course, the one factor that must be karmically effected is the intuitive realization, or the encounter with the Guru who pro-vokes the realization, that no set of social or personal circumstances holds less potential for attaining a vision of non-duality than any other. No matter who we are, says Gorak~a in effect, if we extract the full potential from our situation the disciple becomes the Guru. Rather than act to change our condition, he implies that we should change the way we look at the world. Nourishment is derived from the notion that what we are doing is a divinely self-appointed task or is consistent with the Guru's injunction. The Buddhist ethos of \"ac-ceptance,\" and the man who prefers \"to suffer the slings and arrows of misfortune\" rather than to oppose them, receives a bad press from the Westerner conditioned never to lie down; but insofar as kar-mic effect is inevitable, opposition to the karmic flow constrains the activist to view the world in a negative light and to miss the miracles that can provide \"the nectar of immortality\" and \"insight into non-dual reality.\" Gorak~a accepted the imposition that Minapa laid upon him with implicit faith that this initial, preparatory sadhana73 would be rewarded. To handle another man's excrement is the most demeaning and defiling act a Hindu can perform; and it appears that Caurangi was a most ungracious fellow, unlikely to be free with praise and thanks. But, if an acolyte knows that he is doing his Guru's bidding and that the karmic result will be initiation into an exclusive esoteric community possessing the nectar of immortality, and into the maQ.gala of the gods' Gods (the anuttarayoga-tantra Deities) capable of bestowing both mundane and supreme sz\"ddhis, twelve years ofmenial work may seem like heaven itself. Like his Guru, Minapa, Gorak~a did not attain Buddhahood im-mediately, as one version of the text erroneously states;74 he was re-quired to perform selfless service for aeons. One possible reason is that Minapa, Gorak~a and Caurangi, in particular, practiced saiva or siikta sadhanas, which omitted some essential Buddhist element, perhaps commitment to the Bodhisattva Vow-their sadhanas are"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84 Masters of Mahamudra not described. However, since these siddhas were considered to be Buddhist by authorities who lived close to them in time, even if they practiced Buddhist sadhanas separately, their non-Buddhist theory and practice was probably so similar in content and technique, lack· ing for instance all taint of dualism and the iitman hypothesis, that the chief distinguishing factor was their terminology. It is quite possible that the tantric ambience that exists in Nepal today has its roots in the non-sectarian Tantra of the siddhas' India: faiva and bauddha tantrikas worship the same god, by different names, in the same temple, and the indigenous Newari people see no substantial difference between faiva and bauddha paths. A valokitesvara and Siva are confounded in the lay mind, both deities being known as Loknath, Lord of the World. Gorakhnath's status, however, has altered from that of a great bauddha/ saiva yogin to the confusing role of a staunch faiva since the arrival in Kathmandu of strictly pro· hindu rulers, the Gorkhalis, with their patron saint Gorakhnath. The catholic view is that non-dual vision cannot be qualified, that a faiva's vision is equal to a bauddha's if duality has been resolved. The orthodox (Tibetan) doctrine is that the saiva path cannot lead to tathatii and bodhisattvic enlightened action. This view cannot be accepted as the opinion that prevailed amongst Gorakhnath's con-temporaries and peers. Hz'storz'ography Gorak~a has the distinction of founding the largest sect of yogins in India. His followers, known as niiths, yogt's (jogt's), gorakhniithz's, and kiinphatas, outnumber other tantric lineages by far. They are distinguished by the large ear-rings, usually of bone, that give them the name Split-ears (kiinphata). They are monastic by vow and practice, and their soteriological aim is to unite with Brahmiit;l through tantra-yoga, a heterogenous corpus of yoga techniques derived from Pataiijali, and tantric techniques, many shared with the Buddhists. Hathayoga is their forte. The niiths believe that the doctrines taught by Saga-Siva to Uma and to Mina/Macchen· dranath on the ocean bottom are the origin of their scriptures, the tantras treating \"left-handed\" worship of Sakti. The garr-acakra rite including the paiicamiikara offering is a central part of their ritual.

Minanath would have performed the same process on the yogz'ni-kaula, an unreformed sakta sect, by the assimilation of Buddhist doctrines and methods. Briggs and Lorenzen leave ample room for visionary conjecture. 75 Gorak~a or Gorakhnath (T.

The King Devapala of the legend must have been a minor potentate. One last word from Taranatha, who clearly believes that Gorak~a was a Buddhist and taught Buddhist disciples: in the 13th century \"most of the yogin followers of Gorak~a were fools, and driven by greed for money and honor became the followers of ISvara.

Even if your life is at stake avoid doing evil.\" So saying, she died. The king was induced by his courtiers to take another wife, but from a foreign country. A few days after his marriage he escaped the palace and went into the thick jungle to dispel a secret grief. One day after he had left, the queen climbed to the palace roof for the view, and there she caught sight of her stepson below and im-mediately became deeply infatuated with him. She sent a messenger to invite him to come to her side, but he refused her invitation. She felt mortally humiliated. \"He despises mel\" she thought. \"He is my worst enemy. I must eliminate him.\" And she ordered her atten-dants to murder him.

He appointed two executioners immediately. \"Take the prince deep into the jungle, cut off his arms and legs and abandon him,\" he commanded. The palace attendants ordered to execute the prince loved him more than their own sons, and rather than kill the innocent prince they decided to sacrifice one of their own sons. But when they told the prince of their plan he adamantly rejected it. \"That is impos-sible,\" he told them. \"I promised my dying mother that I would commit no sin even if my life was at stake. You must obey my father's command.\" So they took the prince into the jungle, cut off his arms and legs from his body and left him to die propped against a tree. At once the yogin Minapa, also known as Achitapa and greatly renowned in Devapala's kingdom, appeared before the prince. In response to the dying boy's plea for help Minapa gave him initiation and empower-ment and then instructed him in the yoga of pot-bellied breathing. \"With the successful conclusion of this practice your body will once again become whole,\" the Guru told him. He then left the boy under the tree. Minapa walked the distance a human shout carries and found a group of cowherd boys resting while their cows grazed. How one of them offered to serve the prince Caurailgi, and the manner of his service, which became a sadhana, is related in the legend of Gorak~a. The prince remained in meditation for twelve years. One evening at the end of this period, a party of king's merchants laden with gold, silver and precious stones happened to pitch their tent close to his tree. Fearing the ravages of robbers and bandits, at nightfall they took their treasure to hide it deeper in the forest, and as they passed close to the prince's tree he heard their footfall and called out to them, \"Who's there?\" The merchants were afraid that they had camped near a robbers' den. \"We are charcoal-makers,\" they replied apprehensively. \"So be it!\" said the prince."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88 Masters of Mahiimudra Th~ merchants returned to their camp with their treasure, but when they opened it up, in fear and amazement they found that it had changed to charcoal. \"How can this be?\" they asked one another in astonishment.

Let's go and see if he really is such a man.\" So they retraced their steps and found a limbless man lying under a tree, and telling him what had happened they asked him to reverse his former statement. \"I can't say whether I am responsible or not,\" Caurangi told them. \"But if I am, then let the charcoal return to its original state.\" Back at the camp the merchants found that their treasure was in its original form; amazed, they again returned to Caurangi, this time with gifts to worship him. Then Caurangi remembered his Guru's prophetic words that once his disciple's practice was finished his body would become whole again. He prayed that his limbs be restored, and it was so. On the following morning Gorak~a found the prince standing on his own two feet. In explanation he sang to Gorak~a: My wise and holy Guru Introduced me to space and knowledge, And I realz'zed the one value of all thz'ngs. What joy to be free of pleasure and pain! \"As earth is the mother of everything that grows, all-pervasive emp-tiness is the ground of my re-membered limbs.\" Caurangipada, the Immortal, gained every mundane sz'ddht' and performed many miracles, but he had an irascible temperament and would teach no one his secret.

Caurangi appears to have attained the one taste of all things 78 through the pot-bellied breathing technique, 79 which is not elaborated in the text. Identify-ing with the empty space of the dharmakiiya a pure apparitional body can be achieved;80 simulating the experience of death, the elements are telescoped one into the next until \"air\" dissolves into the clear light. Then, at least in theory, the yogin is able to manifest whatever form he conceives, and it should be an elementary practice to visualize a complete human body. Although it is not explicitly stated, Caurangi's body must have been an apparitional body. The apparitional body is immortal, impervious to the vagaries of time and decay, because it is knowledge and pure awareness81 in-separable from the self-manifest appearances of the mind's nature. In the same way that the body's form is determined by a mental con-ception, \"external\" objects are also projections of the mind, and if a yogin's mind is identified with the plenum of all-pervasive inner space ( dharmadhiitu) objects must conform to mental images. In-sofar as the plane of sound and vibration is the interface between thought and appearances, sound is the creative medium; the \"true word, \"82 an absolutely specific sound, is the sound that is necessarily reflected in the realm of three-dimensional appearances. Thus a yogin with mahiimudrii-sz'ddhz' cannot lie-his thoughts are automatically translated into phenomenal reality. The creative power of mantra, which is nothing if not \"true word,\" is described in many stories about the siddhas. The siddha Bm;u;ladatta, the Nepali King Narendradeva's minister, for instance, who induced Minapa to grant him a boon by mantra-sz'ddhz' (the creative power of mantra), later created the image of Karii\\}amaya/Matsyendranath, that now sits in Ka:bahal in the Kathmandu Valley, through the power of mantra. The many stories of great Indian masters of vi'rtii or st'tar who could make rain by the perfect rendering of a \"water\" riiga, or whose instruments burst into flame when they played a fire riiga to perfection, illustrate the relationship between sound and the elements. Belief in such metaphysical phenomena is no less credible than, say, the belief that war is caused by the collective belligerent intention and thought of a nation, or an army and its leaders. The universe is a collective delusion of all mankind; by identifying with the ground out of which that delusion grows, a single powerful mind can alter part of that great delusion.

His Guru was Buddhapa, and he gained his sz\"ddht\" from Hevajra. The King of GauQ.a had an only son, who was dearly beloved by his parents and the court. Eight nurses indulged his every whim, and musicians were sent to soothe him. As he grew older he became obsessed with the drone of the tambura, and as soon as he was able he learned to play the vit7.a and became absorbed in it to the exclu-sion of everything else. His parents and the court became anxious. \"The prince is heir-apparent and should learn the business of government,\" they com-plained. \"He must be cured of this obsession with the vit7.a.\" They hoped that the appearance of a highly trained yogin called Buddhapa would wean the prince from music. The prince was in-deed struck by the qualities of this holy man, and at their first en-counter he prostrated to him and circumambulated him, and they sat down together to talk frankly about life's problems. Very soon Buddhapa realized that the prince was ready for spiritual training, and he asked him how he felt about practicing a sadhana, a method of disciplining the mind on the path to Buddhahood. \"My sadhana is my music, venerable yogin,\" replied the prince. \"I am totally preoccupied with iny vit7.a and fascinated by the sound of the tambura. But if there is a Buddhist sadhana that I could learn without abandoning music I would certainly practice it.\""},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"92 Masters of Mahamudrii \"If you have the motivation and faith necessary to practice, I will teach you a musical sadhana,\" the Guru promised him. The Guru Buddhapa initiated the prince with the initiation that mellows the immature mind-stream. His meditation instruction was this: meditate upon the sound of your instrument free of all distinc-tion between the sound struck and the mental impression; cease all mental interference with the sound, all conceptualization and all critical and judgemental thought, so that you contemplate only pure sound. The prince practiced these precepts for nine years, and all mental obscuration obstructing pure cognition was eradicated from his mind. After experiencing the clear light shining within like a butter-lamp, he attained Mahamudra. Various suprasensory capabilities such as prescience spontaneously arose in his mind-stream and he became universally renowned as the yogin Vi:l;1apa. He taught the multitudes of people of Magadha innumerable methods of achiev-ing release from the bonds of existence. At the end he expressed his realization, gave his last testament, and in his very body he passed into the J;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana The vi~a is a seven-stringed, plectrum-plucked instrument with a second gourd at its upper end, and the tambura is a four-stringed, finger-plucked monochordophonic accompanying instrument. In the legend either the translator was confused by the instruments' names, using them synonymously, or, as I have assumed, Vi:papa played the vi~a himself while retaining his early fascination for the tambura. In Indian classical music the non-technical ear hears the drone of the tambura as a cosmic OM out of which rise and fall the melodious vowels of the feminine vi~a and the rythmic consonants of the masculine tabla drums. Thus the sound of the tambura is analogous to the unstruck sound83 out of which all sound rises and which is inherent in all sound; and the sounds of the vi~a and tabla are analogous to perfect insight and compassionate skillful means, which in consummate union create the unstruck sound. When masters of vi~a. or sz'tar, and tabla play together in perfect accord and are of one mind, the unstruck sound sometimes suddenly re-sounds in the ear, and the essential purpose of the music, and why it is called sacred music, becomes clear.

The unstruck sound is the sound of silence and is the auditory equivalent of phenomenal emptiness. It is absolute sound; it is the potential sound of everything composed and waiting to be composed. Lost in this non-sound, the sense of self becomes infinite-ly diffused in emptiness. Musicians are lost in space through the in-finite powers of dissolution of the unstruck sound, and their sense of self is reinforced by vestiges of magical power adhering to the mind after hearing the unstruck sound only indistinctly.

The messenger arrived at VikramaSila and presented the gifts of the king and the people of Sri Lanka-gold, silver, pearls, fine silk and valuables-to Santipa, prostrating before him and then deliver-ing this message. \"The king and people of Sri Lanka send their most profound respect.

Take pity on us and come to spread the liberating message of the Mahayana-the Great Approach to Buddhahood-amongst us.

Passing through Nalanda, O<lantapuri, Rajagrha, Va-jrasana (Bodh Gaya) and many other towns, they finally arrived at the ·shore of the Singhalese Ocean. The Sri Lankan messenger crossed in advance to inform King Kapina of their imminent arrival. The people of Sri Lanka were as happy as Bodhisattvas on the first level of the ten-fold path, and one by one they left their work to gather on the beach. After seven days they caught sight of the canopies and oxen in the boats on the horizon and were intoxicated with joy. When their guests disembarked they covered the ground with silk for the great preceptor to walk upon, bowing low in homage. They offered him vast quantities of incense and flowers and hurried to prepare their guests' every need. Provided with a place to sleep and the necessities of life Santipa stayed three years in Sri Lanka teaching the many doctrines and techniques of the Trzpt]aka. When it was time to return to his own land, Santipa received thousands of horses and oxen, gold, silver, coral and other precious things from King Kapina and his people. He took the longer, alter-native route home, and after passing through the kingdom of Riimesvaram, where King Ramana had built a great temple to Mahiideva after the recovery of his wife from Lankiipuri in Sri Lanka, Santipa prepared for a seven day crossing of a deserted country. On the fourth day of that crossing he encountered Kotalipa (Tog tse pa), whose story is recounted elsewhere ( 44). After his return to VikramaSila, Santipa grew old and infirm. His students drove him about in a buffalo cart, giving him sweetmeats to eat and serving him soft food, since he had lost his teeth. When he was one hundred years old he entered a twelve year contemplative retreat. During those same twelve years the peasant Kotalipa was also in retreat.

Kotalipa's blessings bestowed every divine happiness upon them. \"Until I received my Guru's instruction I plowed the mountainside,\" said the yogin. \"Through instruction on the technique of plowing the mind I at-tained siddhz'.\" Indra and his hosts invited him to the Thirty-three Sensual Paradises, but he refused to go. \"It is imperative to pay homage to the Guru because the Guru is a source of grace greater than the Buddha,\" he told them. \"As it is said in the scriptures 'the Guru is the Buddha; the Guru is the Teaching; and the Guru is the Community.' I take refuge in the Guru who embodies The Three Jewels, and I pray for his sacred blessings.\" With his eye of wisdom Kotalipa saw that the journey to VikramaSila would take six months on foot, so in his awareness-body he transported himself there in an instant. He prostrated before the Guru and his entourage and circumambulated them, until he realiz-ed that they could not see his invisible awareness-body, and then he materialized his physical body and repeated his homage. \"Who is this?\" Santipa enquired. \"I am your disciple,\" Ko~alipa replied. \"I cannot remember all my innumerable disciples,\" said the Guru. \"I am the peasant you found digging the mountainside,\" Kotalipa reminded him. After these formalities the two masters began to talk casually about their mutual interests. Later Santipa asked his disciple, \"And what results have you ob-tained from your meditation?\" \"Following your instruction I gained mahiimudrii-sz'ddhz' and the existential mode of pure awareness and emptiness-the dhar-makiiya,\" replied Kotalipa. \"Teaching has been my priority and I have neglected spiritual discipline,\" Santipa confessed in reply. \"I have never experienced the perfect reality that I teach, while you have rejected teaching in favor of your sadhana, discovering ultimate truth.

Santipa spent twelve more years in meditation before he attained mahiimudrii-siddhi, and then he served others faithfully before attaining the I;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana This legend of Santipa is free of explicit criticism of the great preceptor's life and mind; but in the light of Saraha's dohiis, which reduce to worthlessness all scholastic endeavor, discursive medita-tion, unrealized preaching and so on, it is difficult to avoid a sense of disdain when reading the description of pomp and glory, the great entourages, the lavish gifts, the buffalo cart and the sweetmeats, and the Guru's complacency and condescension. The peasant-siddha Kotalipa is the real hero of the story, the siddha whose reward for sustaining a thought-free state of mind88 was am-brosia poured into his \"gate of purity, \"89 the fontanelle entrance to the central channel. But there was no disdain for learning in the five arts and sciences90-logic, grammar, medicine, mechanical arts and metaphysics and meta psychology-in the ethos of the siddhas; it was the arrogant confusion of existential realization with mere knowledge that was despised in their songs. The yogin with real ex-istential knowledge was known as a Vajrasattva in India, though not in Tibet: the Guru as the Buddha at the center of the ma:pQ.ala em-bodying the three modes of being and the Five Dhyani Buddhas. Iconographically Vajrasattva (T.rDo rje sems dpa') carries the scep-ter (vajra)-adamantine empty compassion-at his heart center and the bell (gharttii)-the dance of the ~akini's awareness~ on his left knee. Vajrasattva was a popular subject for Pala sculptors. The story of Santipa belies the jealous opinion that a teacher must be enlightened in order to instruct and bestow precepts. It is suffi-cient to be familiar with the territory of the mind through personal experience, and to have gained through meditative experience in-tuitive insight that permits a decisive diagnosis of a disciple's needs, to be able to prescribe a sadhana. A doctor does not have to ex-perience an illness to cure it, and nor does a scientist need to go to the moon to predict the situation a visitor will find and the necessary"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"98 Masters of Mahiimudra procedure he must follow to combat hostile conditions.

But with fair knowledge of their traditions and some knowledge of techniques, they are quite capable of transmitting the knowledge necessary to practice a sadhana, though not to give effective initia-tion and empowerment. Hz'storz'ography As history of Sri Lanka the legend is incomprehensible. There is no King Kapina in the lists of Siilghala kings. The Emperor Asoka's son is said to have introduced hinayana doctrines into Sri Lanka in the third century BC. The growth of mahayana and the va#ulyavada sect from the first century AD was halted occasionally by sometimes quite fierce repression of the so-called heretics by kings sympathetic to the Theravadin order. By the sixth or seventh centuries the hinayana and mahayana were flourishing alongside the Theravada order, and in the ninth century vajrayana was in-troduced, receiving royal sanction and spreading. Nil-sadhana, in-volving \"indulgence in women, wine and love,\" may have been the cause of a general decline in interest in pure Buddhist doctrines; by the turn of the twelfth century preceptors were invited from Burma to re-establish a hinayana line of ordination. Indian missionaries were responsible for every innovation in Sri Lanka. Sanghamitra, for example, a monk from southern India versed in \"exorcism and magical formulae,\" stimulated a mahayana revival in the third cen-tury. The monks Gu~avarman, a scion of Kashmiri royalty, and Va-jrabodhi, taught mahayana on their way to the Far East in the seventh century. 91 The Singhal a chronicles do not mention the names of any siddha missionaries. Luipa and Aryadeva are said to have been born in Sri Lanka, and Matsyendranath is associated with the island in some accounts. Thus Santipa's claim to fame cannot rest upon his conversion of the Singhalese; he could only have been one of many Indian monks who taught in Sri Lanka. The Santipa, or Ratnakarasanti, known to Tibet, flourished dur-ing the golden era of VikramaSila as Keeper of the Southern Gate92 when Naropa was Northern Gatekeeper.

Another of San-tipa's Gurus was Thaganapa (19). Amongst his very many disciples, Atisa, to whom he is alleged to have given permission to go to Tibet, is prominent, and another of his disciples who took the Dharma to Tibet was Sraddhakaravarman who was destined to become the most prolific and efficient of the great translator Rinchen Zangpo's collaborators, at Tho ling in Western Tibet. Maitripa was a disciple of his who gained the distinction .of defeating his Guru in public debate.96 Kotalipa must be mentioned as both disciple and Guru. The bulk of Ratnakarasanti's literary output deals with the Prajfiiipiiramz\"tii. Santipa, the VikramaSila Gatekeeper, lived in the eleventh cen-tury. If he gave Atisa permission to leave the monastery he was in of-fice in AD 1040. If he studied with Naiopa it would have been after AD 1049. We can believe that he led a very long life, so he may have been born in the latter part of the tenth century and died in the sec-ond half of the eleventh. There is no evidence of a Santipa contem-porary with the Pala Emperor Devapala (AD 810-850)."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"13 THE MAHASIDDHA T ANTIPA THE SENILE WEAVER The worldly weaver weaves warp and woof, Whz'le I, guided by the Guru's precepts, I weave the strands of my experz'ence: My thread is the emptiness of ft'vefold awareness, My combing stick is the Guru's z'nstructz'on, My loom is perfect insight into empUness, And the Jinz\"shed fabric is the dharmakaya-The unity of all-embradng space and the play of knowledge. In Sendhonagar there lived a weaver with many sons who worked all his life to accumulate wealth. His sons took wives of similar caste, and the tribe of weavers increased in that land. The weaver's wife died when he was eighty-nine years old and becoming increas-ingly decrepid and infirm, he was fed by his daughters-in-law in turn. But senile, he became an object of scorn and ridicule, and his soris' wives, believing that visitors' revulsion was creating disrepute for the family and a negative karmic situation, decided to build a grass hut for him in the garden. The old man duly retired to the hut, where he was fed as before, and his family was protected from his abuse and their public shame. Time passed, and it happened that the Guru Jalandhara came to Sendhonagar and approached the weaver's eldest son to ask him for food. The son complied, requesting that the Guru wait outside while food was prepared. When all was ready, the Guru went inside and ate what was offered.

How hollow are life's promises!\" \"Everything we do is a passing show; everyone entering existence enters suffering; everything whatsoever is insubstantial, hollow illu-sion. But nirva~a is peace and happiness,\" quoth jalandhara. \"Do you want instruction that prepares you for death?\" \"I do,\" replied the weaver. And his Guru gave him initiation into the maJ,l\\fala of Hevajra, gave him instruction in meditation, and then went away. The old man began to practice his meditation precepts. His life proceeded as before except that he maintained complete silence, no longer complaining to his daughters-in-law and their families. After twelve years of practice, unknown to anyone, he had attained various powers. His accomplishment would have remained secret had not his eldest son forgotten to carry food to him due to a celebration upon the completion of a particularly good carpet, and had not the wife taken his meal to him instead at an unusual hour. Inside his hut she saw a great lamp-like effulgence surrounded by fif-teen girls holding dishes of fine food and wearing ornaments unknown in the human realm. She ran to her husband and told him to go quickly to his father, but assuming that the old man was dying he began to weep. His friends hurried into the garden, and seeing the same vision as the wife they were astonished. \"No human being is capable of such things!\" they said. \"The old man must be pos-sessed by a demon.\" By morning the whole city of Se:ildhonagar had heard the news, and people came to stare, some prostrating themselves.

He became known as Guru Tantipa, and after performing marvelous selfless acts for the people, finally he went to the J;>akini's Paradise in his own body together with a vast host from Sendhonagar. It is said that, even today, if you practice the Guru's instructions with faith and devotion it is possible to rejuvenate this very body, in this very lifetime, obtaining supreme mahiimudrii-siddht'. Siidhana The form of Tantipa's song of realization is to be found frequent-ly amongst the siddhas' songs; the craftsman describes his realiza-tion, or the metaphysics of his meditation practice, in terms of his craft, or he describes how this craft, which is his practice, can be seen as yoga. The entire framework of this siddha's existence, the loom, is the Awareness J;>akini (prajfiii); the substance of his ex-perience, the thread, are the forms of the J;>akini (paficajfiiina: mirror-like awareness, spontaneous fulfillment of purpose, and awareness of the plenum of emptiness). His Guru's instruction, the combing stick, is the means of keeping all experience whatsoever within the framework of empty awareness. And when there is un-broken continuity of spontaneous pure awareness, his being alive, the finished fabric, is the unity of the ubiquitous space of the dhar-madhiitu and the clear light of knowledge96-the dharmakiiya. Jalandhara promised Tantipa instruction on the way to die, and Tantipa attained a rejuvenated body as the fruit of his practice. The only indications of the nature of his practice are that he maintained silence for twelve years, that he visualized a ma:J;lgala, presumably of Hevajra, in which Vajrayogini was his J;>akini, and a retinue of fif-teen yoginis actually manifested to worship him. Thus he probably practiced the creative process of Hevajra's sadhana to achieve realization of the dharmakiiya. Through such attainment the body is automatically transformed into a body of light, since the dhar-makiiya is a union of space and light;97 and at death when the clear light appears at the end of the tunnel, in which the propensities of karma tempt the mind to take rebirth in any of the six realms, there is only an ecstatic dissolution of light into light, and then· an unselfish choice as to where re-incarnation should occur."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Mahasiddha Tantipa 103 In Taranatha's similar story of Tantipa98 the weaver lives in Avanti in Malava; and the old man receives his mahiimudrii-siddht\" directly from bhattarika Vajrayogini when she lays her hands upon his head. After his rejuvenation he returns to weaving, singing all the time, and then meets Kr~1;1acarya (17) to whom he gives practical instruction in non-discrimination-how to eat excrement like bread and butter and how to devour human flesh like a wolf. Tantipa is credited with the accomplishment of prohibiting animal sacrifice to Durga (in Avanti?) by transforming thousands of sacrificial goats in-to jackals, thus introducing doubt and fear into the worshippers' minds, and then commanding the Goddess to refrain from accep-ting blood offerings. H'istor'iography The evidence supports a north-western or western domicile for Tantipa. Avanti was the ancient Buddhist kingdom, familiar from the]ataka Tales, with Ujain as its capital, forming part of Malava, now Malwa. Sendhonagar is probably a corruption of Sindhunagar, \"Indus-ville,\" which could have been Ta~ila (see p. 364).

But Kr~J;ladirya's legend herein gives Saliputra as Tan-tipa's home-town, and our identifications are thrown into doubt. If Jalandhara was born in the middle of the ninth century we can assume .that Tantipa was born in the first half of the ninth and that he was an old man by the start of the tenth. Some disciples ofJalan-dhara were saiva oriented; there is no evidence of faiva influence in Tantipa's legend except that rejuvenation of the body is a practice associated with the niiths-kiiya-kalpa is their generic name for re-juvenation therapies.

But Camaripa constantly sought to escape from his work. He felt that he was not made to be a cobbler and dreamt of other things. One day a monk passed by his shop and, stopping work, the cob-bler spontaneously threw down his tools, ran to the monk and pros-trated in the dust before him. \"I am sick and tired of this life of endless toil, passion and stupidity,\" he blurted. \"I want to follow the Buddha's path, but I have never encountered a spiritual {riend, so I've never begun.

The cobbler abandoned his old home and went to a solitary place to meditate. Signs of accomplishment arose as his Guru had for-seen.

The people of Vi~v.unagar were ignorant of his practice as well as the degree of his achievement, until one day a man came to inspect the cobbler's shoes and found him composed in meditation while Visvakarman worked at the bench. Astonished, he spread the news, and one by one the people came to see for themselves. They begged him to teach them, so he taught them the indispensable benefits of a Guru's instruction and then explained many different doctrines and techniques to them. They called him Camaripada, the Siddha Cobbler, and he became famous by that name. He performed marvellous deeds for all the people until he went to the J;)akini's Paradise in his own body. Sadhana Doubt remains as to whether Camaripa meditated at his work bench or in the jungle. If the latter, he must have returned to his cobbling at the end of his twelve years for the episode of Visvakarman's visitation and the people's discovery of his achieve-ment. If the former, then \"his old home\" was his pre-initiation state of mind, and \"a solitary place\" was a cave in the mind free from preconceptions and mundane obsession in accordance with Saraha's J;)akini's definition. Thus Camaripa would have sat at his work for twelve years using his activity as the Guru's precepts until finally it was \"Visvakarman\" who worked while he watched, utterly detached from his own activity, and at that point of development, free of any mental interference in the work that his fingers performed without defect, he had achieved \"his dharmakaya shoes.\" With this inter-pretation he renounced nothing but the eight mundaue obsessions: praise and blame, loss and gain, pleasure and pain, ignominy and fame.

Passion or ~motivityl02 is the motive energy of thought; and lust, hatred, pride, envy, fear and sloth, the six basic passions, are all dependent upon ignorance.103 Ignorance is the inability to \"see\" a holistic, non-dual reality, accompanied by the all-penetrating conviction that we are all islands, that man, woman, god, and the subjective and objec-tive factors in a perceptual situation, are all discrete isolates, that \"I\" and \"mine\" define bottom line realities, and enlightenment is the recognition of such facts. The thread that binds this \"leather\" into \"dharmakaya shoes\" is the thread of existence (tantra, T.rgyud), the constant, the only constant, in the six realms, and that is emptiness (sunyatii). If we can perceive the thread in our discursive thought, in the current obsessive mental chatter about profit and loss, pleasure, pain and so forth, then we have the thread that leads out of the Minotaur's maze. To intuit this thread of emp-tiness is to gain freedom from the eight obsessions, to become indif-ferent to joy and sorrow, to attain the impartial equanimity and clarity of pure pleasure. And how is this to be achieved? Camaripa's Guru says through the peak experience of (non-dual) meditation, through intuitive insight (prafiiii), through the Guru's introduction to it at initiation and through practice of his precepts. Practicing Mahamudra meditation in solitude, physical or figurative, peak ex-periences of emptiness will increase in a process of auto-acceleration, so that conscious effort is counter-productive; \"relax into the essential nature of your being\" is the salient precept, and your dharmakaya shoes are spontaneously accomplished. Camaripa taught the indispensable need for a Guru; until he encountered his first and only spiritual friend, he was without the initial induction into the ultimate nature of reality that is the essential, unfailing point of reference.

After twenty-one days a large black snake slid out from underneath Avalokitesvara's foot, and he seized it by the head. The snake turned into a sword, and he found himself holding the radiant sword of awareness.

The sword of awareness is carried by Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of Intelligence, and by several protectors ofthe Dhar-ma. In Manjusri's hand it cuts away the veils of emotivity and objec-tive knowledge that obscure the clear light of the dharmakiiya. The sword of awareness is also known as \"the sword of the wisdom of un-bounded knowledge, \"104 which does not signify that the siddha is omniscient but that he knows the element of knowledge that transcends its content, the knowledge of emptiness. Perfect insight has as its object compassion, the Guru's skillful means, whereas pure awareness is the union of perfect insight and compassion, which is the clear light. The sword of awareness is one of the eight great sid-dhis. The \"large, black snake\" which KhaQ:gapa seizes firmly by its head represents the moral and conceptual defilements that he brings into clear focus. The three weeks of constant application to his sadhana has given KhaQ:gapa one week for the purification of each of his \"three doors\"-body, speech and mind. The snake also represents aversion, anger and hatred; this snake, the cock of desire and greed, and the pig of sloth and stupidity, represent the three basic poisons of the mind. . Historiography If Carpati (Carpatri in the Tibetan texts) was one of the original naths (see 64), it may be significant that KhaQ:gapa attained only a mundane siddhi, and that mahiimudra-siddhi is not mentioned amongst his attainments, signifying that he belonged amongst the saz'va siddhas.

The brahmin Nagarjuna began his career in the district of Kahora in the eastern kingdom of Kafici. In his wild youth he intimidated the twenty-five thousand households of Kahora, reckless· ly plundering property and invading privacy. His depredations were so severe that the brahmins in council decided to leave the district permanently, abandoning it to its nemesis. When Nagarjuna heard this he sent a messenger to inform the brahmins that rather than deprive the people of their priests he himself would move to another place, and that he would divide his property and possessions amongst them all. Giving away all that he owned, he entered a self· imposed exile. Nagarjuna left Kahora for Nalanda, taking ordination on the far side of the Cool Garden Cremation Ground (at Vajrasana?). At Nalanda he studied the five arts and sciences, eventually achieving the pinnacle of academic achievement. But he soon tired of discoursing and began .to practice meditation, propitiating the God· dess Tara, the Savioress. When he saw her face in reality, he left the security and the sustenance of the great monastic academy of Nalanda, which housed seven hundred monks, and took to a mendi-cant life, travelling to other lands and begging in the towns and villages.

I must gain the capacity to help others.\" So he went to Ra-jagrha intent upon entering retreat to propitiate the Elemental Con-sorts (yak~is). In Rajagrha he began by propitiating the Twelve Consorts of the Supreme Elemental with mantra. On the first day there was an: earthquake; on the second day a vast flood; on the third day a holocaust of fire descended; on the fourth, violent gales blew; on the fifth, a shower of weapons fell from the sky; on the sixth, vajra thunderbolts rained down; and on the seventh, Elemental Consorts gathered to attack but failed to distract him from his inviolable heart-commitment. Then, invoked by his samadhi, all the female elementals came to him. \"What do you need? We will give you whatever you want,\" they told him humbly. \"I need only a daily supply of food to sustain me throughout my retreat,\" Nagarjuna ordered. And for twelve years they brought him four handfuls of rice and five handfuls of vegetables every day. At the end of his twelve years of sadhana he had under his control one hundred and eight Elemental Consorts, and went forth with the intention of serving all sentient beings. His initial plan was to transform the GandhaSila Mountain into gold. First he changed it into iron and then to copper, but just as he was about to turn the copper into gold, the voice of the Bodhisattva Mafijusri spoke to him .. \"This action will only cause conflict and strife amongst the people. You will not help human beings like this; you will only suc-ceed in provoking greater evil and sin.\" The master abandoned his plan and continued on his way, but today the GandhaSila Mountain still has a copper-colored, purplish hue. Then travelling south to Sri Parvata Mountain, Nagarjuna came to the banks of a broad river and asked some herdsmen to direct him to a ford. They showed him to a dangerous part of the river bound-ed by high banks and infested with crocodiles. Just then .another herdsman appeared and warned him of the river's danger at that spot. He led Nagarjuna to a ford, and taking the master on his back he began to wade across the river. In the middle of the current Nagarjuna created an illusion of crocodiles threatening to attack them. \"Do not fear so long as I am alive,\" shouted the herdsman. Nagar-juna dissolved the forms he had created and they reached the other shore safely."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Niigiirjuna 115 \"I am Arya Nagarjuna,\" the master told the man. \"Do you recognize me?\" \"I have heard of you,\" replied the herdsman, \"but I have never seen you before.\" \"For carrying me safely across the river I will give you whatever you wish,\" Nagarjuna promised him. \"Then please make me a king,\" said the herdsman immediately. The master splashed some water upon a siil tree and the tree turned into an elephant upon which the king mounted. \"Do I need an army?\" asked the king. \"When the elephant trumpets the army will appear,\" Nagarjuna assured him. And it was so. The king was called Salabandha (or Salawahan), and he was to rule over eight million four hundred thousand tax-paying households in the magnificent land called after the city of Bhahitan. He married a queen called Sindhi, and he reigned over his people with benevolence. Nagarjuna continued on his way to Sri Parvata, and upon his ar-rival he found a cave and settled down to practice his meditation. After some years King Salabandha became dissatisfied with his life as a king, and remembering his Guru he went to Sri Parvata to seek solace. He prostrated to Nagarjuna, circumambulated him and then opened his heart. \"The business of government gives little satisfaction and creates much frustration. I want to renounce my kingdom and stay here always in your presence,\" the king told him. \"Do not desert your kingdom,\" advised Nagarjuna. \"Take this Precious Rosary (Ratniivali) as your preceptor, and it will protect your kingdom. Further, it will give you the nectar of immortality and fearlessness in the face of death.\" \"If a time comes when I can stay with you, my teacher, I will keep the kingdom and the nectar. If not I want neither,\" the king responded. Although Salabandha did not want to return to his king-dom, Nagarjuna insisted, instructing him on the practice of the alchemy that produces the nectar of immortality, the nectar that would prolong his life for one hundred years, during which period he would rule his kingdom. Finally the king did as his Guru had ordained, and for one hun-dred years his kingdom prospered. The birds and creatures of the mountains lived happily, and the master spread the creed of the Buddha.

King Salabandha interpreted these omens to mean that his Guru was irt danger, and abdicating his throne in favor of his son, Cin-dhakumara, he went with a small retinue to sit at the feet of his Guru on Sri Parvata. \"Why have you come, my son?\" asked the Guru.

Here that tradition is seen to have Indian antecedents, for in this Indian legend of Nagar-juna, as in most Tibetan accounts, the two principal bearers of that name, besides lesser Nagarjunas, have been confounded. The original Arya Nagarjuna, born in South India in the second century, sometimes called the Second Buddha, the great philosopher who founded the madhyamika system of dialectics, and who revealed and wrote some of the prajfiiipiiramitii siitras ahd commentaries, is confounded with the chief of the siddhiiciirya Nagarjunas, the ninth century master of the Guhyasamiija-tantra, the disciple of Saraha. Several of the anecdotes that comprise our legend are to be found in the biography of the early Nagarjuna that was translated into (or written in) Chinese by the Indian missionary Kumarajlva in AD 405. The fo11owing is an essential precis of Kumarajiva's work.106 From the beginning Nagarjuna showed an amazing intellect and capacity for memorization. By age twenty he had achieved academic fame in traditional brahmin studies. He then abandoned learning and threw himself into a search for sensual pleasure. With the help of a wizard's gift of invisibility, with three friends he would invade the king's palace and molest the palace women. In a tragic denouement his friends were killed while he escaped by standing in-visibly next to the king. Self-disgust and guilt prompted his renun-ciation and ordination as a Buddhist monk. He quickly absorbed"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"118 Masters of Mahamudra the Trijn{aka and Mahiiyana-siitras, the latter from a mountain hermit, but dissatisfied he wandered throughout India searching for the \"missing sutras,\" perceiving a lack of consistency and order in the extant texts. Able to defeat all-comers in debate, he grew ar-rogant and, composing his own doctrines, he founded his own school with a basic doctrine of \"non-rejection\" and \"equanimity in the face of all experience.\" At this point a mahiiniiga took pity on him and invited him into his subterranean library of siitras that the Buddha Sakyamuni had entrusted to the niigas fqr Nagarjuna himself. He mastered them all in ninety days, but discovering a fur-ther, inexhaustible store, he realized that experiential realization of the siitras' contents was required rather than greater breadth of learning. He entered a samadhi of \"the patience of non-being.\" Awakening from this samadhi he propagated the siitras, defeated all brahmin opposition, and composed the madhyamika siistra and detailed mahayana commentaries. His life ended after a brahmin challenged him to a magical contest; he created an elephant that seized and injured the brahmin, who sat on a lotus in a magical lake. When the brahmin revealed his disdain for Nagarjuna the master locked himself in a room, and when a disciple hewed down the door only a cicada flew out past him. Other early Chinese sources107 mention the episode of the Gan-dhaSila Mountain; that he wrote alchemical works including tomes on \"the preparation of jewels and herbal medicines;\" and that his friend, the Satavahana king, was associated with his death. The \"standard\" Tibetan version of Nagarjuna's biography is contained in Bu ston's History of the Dharma, 108 the version expanded upon by Taranatha.109 It is full of information absent in Chinese sources, but little of it can be given historiographical credence. For instance, Nagarjuna's early life is centered in Nalanda; it is reasonable to assume that since Kumarajiva fails to mention Nalanda it was the siddha Nagarjuna who was related to that academy. A brilliant brahmin youth was sent to Nalanda to pray for an extension to his life that brahmin astrologers had given up for lost unless extensive offerings were made to brahmin priests. At the renowned monastic academy he was released from the astrologers' curse by the Great Brahmin Saraha, who ordained him, initiated him into the ma\\}c;lala of Amitayus, the Buddha of Long life, and taught him how to recite the mantra of the Conqueror of the Lord of Death.

His career at Nalanda was curtailed by expulsion for \"wrong livelihood\" after he had procured a gold-producing elixir to feed the com-munity during a famine while he was refectory servitor (see 84}. However, Bu ston's story of the master's death does shed some light upon obscurities in our legend. Nagarjuna had taken an elixir of immortality together with the King Antivahana, or U~ayanabhadra, names as obscure as Salabandha (text: Salabhan-dha), and he had said that they would die together. The king's son, eager to ascend the throne, attempted to decapitate Nagarjuna, and the master, fulfilling his vow to serve all beings, took a stalk of ku§a grass and beheaded himself. Ku§a grass was the only means by which he could die because he had killed an insect with a stalk of that grass in a previous life. \"I go to Sukhavati, but I will return to this body,\" were Nagarjuna's last words. The prince took the head two and half miles away from the body, and neither head nor body decaying, each year they drew closer until they eventually met, and again Nagarjuna worked for the benefit of all beings. There is little doubt as to the identity of Nagarjuna's royal dis-ciple. Insofar as the master raised a cowherd (Abhira) to kingship, even our legend supports the contention that this cowherd king was the founder of the Satavahana dynasty, King Satakan;ti, whose per-sonal name was Gautamiputra. A letter written by Nagarjuna to King Gautamiputra has come down to us; it is the famous Suhrllekha,110 a basic discourse on mahayana doctrine. In another letter to Gautamiputra, the Ratniivalf, Nagarjuna explains the theory and practice of the mahayana as it applies to kings. The Satavahana dynasty ruled the western, and parts of the cent~al, Dec-can. Satakan;ti lived in the last quarter of the first century through the first quarter of the second century. Accordingly the putative dates of Nagarjuna are AD 60-150. The decline of Buddhism re-ferred to in the king's song of lament in the legend may indicate a change for the worse at the end of Satakarl).i's life when brahmanical kings succeeded him; it could also refer to the Saka invasions from the north, to the an\"ti-Buddhist pogroms mentioned by Taranatha,m or, if much later, to the saz\"va renaissance after Saftkaradirya. The peculiar circumstances of Nagarjuna's death require some thought. Suicide is quite beyond the Buddhist pale except when a Bodhisattva is giving up his life in fulfillment of his Vow, as in the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"120 Masters of Mahiimudrii case of Sakyamuni's previous incarnation who gave his body to a starving tigress. A vediinta story focuses the practical ethical quan-dary that an uncompromising interpretation of the Bodhisattva Vow produces, and which Nagarjuna resolved by taking his own life. Satikaracarya taught the impeccable doctrine of living only for others and never refusing a request that could be granted; a doc-trine acquired, no doubt, from his Buddhist Guru. A kiipiilt\"ka yogin called Ugra-bhairava, whose Great Vow (mahiivrata) was not com-pleted until he had eaten and drunk from the skull of an anointed king or enlightened sage, found an opportunity to ask for Sankara's skull. The Guru could not deny the kiipiilz'ka's request, and it was only his disciples' constant vigilance that prevented him from killing himself as Nagarjuna had done.112 The conclusion of this story demonstrates vediinta 's more accommodating attitude to humanism, while Nagarjuna, in the immoderate self-sacrificial tradition of the Bodhisattva of the]ataka Tales, represents the true idealism that was Buddhism's popular strength as well as its weakness. Probably the most important of the siddha Nagarjunas was the disciple of Saraha who was one of Nalanda's crowning jewels during the vajrayana epoch. He is best known as an adept of the Guhyasamiija-tantra and for his principal work known as the Paiicakrama, ·which is a commentary on the five stages of yoga derived from Patanjali's system and synthesized with the Guhyasamiija. 113 He taught in the latter part of the eighth and the early ninth centuries. It may have been this Nagarjuna who visited Kashmir and lived near the site of the Mogul Shalimar Gardens.tl4 This is the one Nagarjuna of the Tibetan lineages, to whom his Guru, Saraha, gave both father-tantra and mother-tantra, Guhyasamaja and Sa:rpvara, initiations. His Guhyasamaja disciples were Aryadeva and Nagabodhi who were to become his regents, Sakyamitra and the tantric Candrakirti. He gave Savaripa Sa:rpvara precepts. In our legends Aryadeva (18), Nagabodhi (70), Kucipa (35), Patikajapa (51), and Vyali (84) were a Nagarjuna's disciples. Lilapa (2), Rahula ( 47), and Bhadrapa (24) may also have been taught by one of the Nagarjunas. It is not clear whether the Guhyasamaja adept was an alchemist, a rasiiyana-siddha like his great predecessor and like the tenth century Nagarjuna who Al-buruni, the Muslim traveller and journalist, recorded: \"A famous representative of the science (of"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Mahiisz'ddha Niigiirjuna 121 rasiiyana-rasa meaning gold) was Nagarjuna, born at Fort Daihak, close to Somnath (in Sindh). He used to excel at that art and compil-ed a book which contains the essence of all literature on that subject and is very rare. He lived a hundred years before our epoch (the eleventh century).\" It is possible to identify this rasiiyana-sz'ddha with the Nagarjuna who was one of the founding fathers of the niith lineage along with Gorak~a. Jalandhara, Caurailgi and Carpati, all of whom lived in the tenth century. Rasiiyana is an integral part of the hathayoga sadhana of the niiths. Further it is possible that it was the same Nagarjuna who learned the Tibetan language and col-. laborated with a Tibetan translator to render the Ekajatii (T;Ral gcig ma)-siidhana into Sanskrit. There is no mention of this mother goddess with one hair-knot, one eye, one tooth and one breast as an indigenous Indian deity. Many goddesses of the Indian tribes had been incorporated into the tantric pantheon as yoginis of the psychic channels' focal points in the Cakrasarp.vara ma~gala, for instance, or in the siikta tradition as forms of Durga, Siva's consort. The main reason for identifying the translator of the Ekajata sadhana with the rasiiyana-st'ddha Nagarjuna is that only after the late tenth century would many Tibetans have come to the Pala Empire where Nagar-juna lived. There may have been more than this minimal count of three Nagarjunas. There may have been another siddha Nagarjuna called Kaficannara, since he was born in Kafici. m The task of identifying these saints and siddhas of the same name requires knowledge of Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese sources. However, analyzing the composite Nagarjuna, one important fact emerges: no later emana-tion reaches the heights of realization attained by the second century propounder of the madhyamt'ka tradition. Finally, the mention of Sundarananda (Sunandesvara in the text) raises many questions. Sundarananda, who casts an evil shadow over Nagarjuna's royal disciple's kingdom, is Siva's Bhairava form, his wrathful tantric form, and Sundari is a form of Kali. Sundarananda and Sundari are worshipped at Sri Parvata (Srisailam),116 and it is probable that the early Nagarjuna's place of meditation was at SriSailam. The Vijayapuri Sri Parvata of the Ik~vakus,now drowned under the Nagarjunakonga Lake in Andhra Pradesh, was not built during Nagarjuna's lifetime, although there may have been a vihiira on the site.

He refused to listen to his I;>akini advisor; he committed the cardinal sin of disobeying his Guru, the weaver; he was conceited and hasty; he was governed by anger and pride: he came to a nasty end. The weaver attributed his failings to his incomplete meditation; he had not united insight and skillful means. In practical terms, although he may have attained prolonged periods of insight into emptiness in the controlled situa-tion of trance, during his application of skillful means in an uncon· trolled situation, when impediments such as inflated discursive thought and strong emotion arose, he lacked the perception of emp-tiness that would dissolve these obstacles. Thus, when he was pro-voked by the I;>akini under the lichee tree, instead of donning a wrathful mask while maintaining the inner equilibrium and detach-ment that accompanies an understanding of all phenomena as emp· ty colored space, he was overcome by anger, and his belated contri-tion, which he could have reserved for a meditation of atonement, led to his death. Insight and skillful means are said to be like the wings of a bird; with only one wing, a bird cannot fly. As to emo-tion, so to thought; if his arrogant thoughts dissolved immediately they arose due to his perception of their emptiness, he would not have fallen. If he had been able to experience the sensual feast of the gartacakra as emptiness, his appetite would have been limitless. If he had really eradicated his conditioned prejudice and preconceptions and gained the awareness of sameness, he could have eaten his Guru's excrement. If he had been free of a sense of ego, he could have transformed himself into a wolf and eaten human flesh.

The first l)akini, who KaJ;lhapa chose eventually to ignore, may have been a human embodiment or a sarrtbhogakiiya emanation. The J;>akini under the fruit tree was a mundane J;>akini whose positive potential Ka\\}hapa never discovered because she touched his ego, provoking him to compete and, fatally attached, he stirred in her a wrath that soon killed him. Clearly it is very difficult to penetrate to the emptiness of a mundane J;>akini when she shows the heavy and black side of her ambiguous nature; but if that is achieved she becomes a most loyal ally, guide and savioress. The third I;>akini, Bhande (or Bandhe), is his trustworthy friend who performed superhuman feats out of her devotion to him. Her name could mean \"Buddhist Nun\" ( bandhii) or \"Skull\" (bhandha), which would associate her with the kiipali'kas. Ka\\}hapa had a male disciple called Bhandepada {32), but it was a Bhadrapada (24) who sought the murderous Bahuri, found her in a tree in Devikona and slew her, according to Taranatha.117 Only in this legend are the practices of flesh-eating, dung-eating and (by implication) a literally performed gattacakra-puja men-tioned. In these so-called left-handed (viimiiciira) practices there is an element of William Blake's \"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\" but more than that, it is in the basest impurity, in depravity and the lowest forms of life, and in tamasic food and drink, in the outcaste whore, the kiipiilika ascetic, excrement, corpses, alcohol, drugs, fish and meat, that the ultimate truth118 becomes accessible. Finding purity in impurity through the ex-perience of the one taste of all things, 119 the ultimate sameness of all phenomena, 12° which is emptiness, is realized. At the heart of depravity and corruption is the seed of innocence, unconditioned mind, 121 which turns the wheel full circle and unites polarities. The seed grows into the flower of liberated bodhisattvic activities like a lotus growing out of the slime of a lake bottom: no slime, no lotus. The image ofthe lotus is basic and ubiquitous in tantric sadhana.

It is said that he was the son of the fisherman Kinwar, who caught Minapa's leviathan.

But apart from the niith siddha mentioned above, we are concerned principal-ly with the two Kr~t;t.acaryas of the tenth century who were probably Guru and disciple, and who are confounded in our legend. Jalan-dhara was the Guru of the Father, Son and niith Ka:phapas. The Father-Guru was an iiciirya, and it is likely that this Kr~t;t.iicarya was responsible for most of the hundred and fifty works under this name, or variants, found in the Tenjur. It is uncertain whether the Father or the Son composed and sung the caryiipada songs. The Son, who may have been the niith, could have sung \"I am a Kapali free from aversion.\" But certainly the Son is associated with dance and small ritual drums known as {lamarus. Taranatha126 tells the story of the Son practicing the Satp,vara-tantra at Nalanda being in-duced by a goddess to go to Kaman1pa in Assam to gain the power of wealth (vasu-siddhz). In Kamariipa he found a chest containing an ornamented {lamaru, and the moment he picked it up his feet left the ground in dance. Whenever he played loudly five hundred siddha yogins and yoginis appeared and danced with him. This Kiit;t.hapa was an adept in the mother-tantra, and chronologically he was a contemporary of the niith founders. But was there another mahasiddha Kat;t.ha of this period? In Nepal a Lord Krg1a taught Dza-Hiim, and a brahmin Kr~t;t.a taught Marpa Dopa. A later Kr~t;t.a, also called Balin (Balinacarya), a disciple of Naropa, taught the Tibetans the Guhyasamiija-tantra. As Father and Son Kat;t.hapa are confounded in the Tibetan lineages it is almost impossible to relate the many disciples to their respective Gurus. Mekhala and Kanakhala (66 and 67), Kan-tali (69), Bhadrapa (24), and Kapalapa (72) received Hevajra initia-tion from a Kat;t.hapa. Kusalibhadra and Vijayapada with their con-temporary Guhyapada (Bhadrapa, who also received Kalacakra from a Kr~t;t.a,) were links in Kat;t.hapa's Saip.vara lineage.127 Bhandepa (J2) received the Guhyasamaja.

He was then the preceptor of one thousand monks and the instructor of numerous scholars, but he had not realized his own perfect poten-tial. In order to gain ultimate knowledge he resolved to find the Great Guru Nagarjuna, whose extraordinary powers and virtue had inspired his profound respect. He left Nalanda and set off for the South. On the way, on the banks of a broad lake, he met the Bodhisattva Maiijusri in the guise of a fisherman, and after bowing down to him and presenting offer-ings he asked him where Nagarjuna could be found. The fisherman told him that the master was living in a nearby jungle, preparing an alchemical potion that vouchsafed immortality. Aryadeva followed his directions and discovered Nagarjuna collecting the ingredients for his elixir. He prostrated before the master and begged for in-struction. Nagarjuna gave him initiation into the ma:pQ.ala of Guhyasamaja, precepts to practice and permission to stay with him and practice his sadhana. It became these two masters' habit to go to the town near their jungle hermitage to beg for food. Now while Nagarjuna found great difficulty in begging anything at all, Aryadeva would return to the hermitage laden with all kinds of good things."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Aryadeva (Kar1,1-arzpa) 133 \"You are being provided for by lustful women,\" Nagarjuna told his disciple. \"Your food is therefore unwholesome. In the future you will eat only what you can lift on the end of a pin. Enough of these feasts on banana-leaf dishes!\" Aryadeva obeyed his Guru, eating only the single grains of rice that he could lift with a pin. But the women of the town prepared barley-cakes covered with sweetmeat for him, so that he could eat well without breaking the prohibition. He took the cakes to his Guru, who ate them hungrily. When he reported how he had ob-tained them, he was ordered to remain in the hut in the jungle. Aryadeva obeyed, but this time a tree-nymph brought him delicacies, and she even neglected to cover up her resplendent naked form while she sat and talked. The food she gave him he took to his Guru, along with descriptions of the tree-nymph. Nagarjuna went to the tree in which the nymph lived and called to her; the nymph appeared, showing her head, but modestly refusing to expose herself fully. \"Why do you show yourself to my disciple but not to me?\" he asked her with chagrin. \"Your disciple is utterly free from passion,\" replied the nymph, \"but in you there is still a trace of lust to be eradicated.\" It was at this time that Nagarjuna gave Aryadeva his name, Sublime God. When Nagarjuna's elixir of eternal youth was prepared, he anointed his tongue with a few drops and gave Aryadeva the bowl to do the same. Aryadeva threw the entire bowl against a tree, which immediately broke into leaf. \"If you waste my elixir like that,\" Nagarjuna protested, \"then you must replace it.\" Aryadeva took a bucket of water, urinated into it, stirred it with a twig and gave it to his Guru. \"This is too much,\" said Nagarjuna. His disciple splashed half the bucket's contents over another tree, which also came into bloom. Nagarjuna then said, \"Now you know that your realization is mature, do not stay in sa~p.saral\" At these words Aryadeva floated up into the sky in exaltation. But at that moment Aryadeva was approached by a woman who had been following him from place to place for some time. She pros-trated before him, giving him honor and worship. \"What do you want, woman?\" Aryadeva asked her. \"Why have VOU hPPn fnllnur1n,.. ....,.,:>\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134 Masters of Mahamudra \"I need one of your eyes,\" the woman replied. \"I have been following you because I must have one of your eyes.\" .Aryadeva plucked out his right eye and gave it to her. Thereafter he was known as .Aryadeva the One-Eyed (Kan;1aripa) . .Aryadeva had followed the instructions of his Guru implicitly and the obscurations of his mind had been eradicated, so that merely by hearing his Guru say that he was liberated he was so, and he levitated to the height of seven palm trees. Thereafter, floating in the sky, he taught the Buddha's message to all beings, bringing their minds to maturity. Finally, turning himself upside down, showing the soles of his feet to the sky, he placed his palms together in adora-tion and prostrated to his Guru. As he reversed himself the gods showered flowers down upon him, and he vanished. Siidhana The thread running through this legend is a sense of .Aryadeva's humility and modesty. \"Lotus-born\" Bodhisattvas are born enlightened and they need only go through the motions of learning, both mundane and spiritual, before they recognize their status as Buddhas. There seems to be no other point to the rather obscure anecdote concerning the distribution of Nagarjuna's elixir than to demonstrate .Aryadeva's enlightenment and his ignorance of this fact. The unawareness of his spiritual status, which Aryadeva showed even in Nalanda, is evidence of maturity on the path. \"He who calls himself a Buddha is certainly an imperfect student,\" says Viriipa in one of his dohiis . .Aryadeva's stream of non-dual percep-tion seems to have been free even of the occasional hiccough that allows an objective thought about oneself to slip in and undermine one's power. Insofar as evolution on the path implies a progressive loss of the ego identity that poses questions such as \"Who am I?\" and \"Am I enlightened yet?\" the initial diligent striving and fervent aspiration necessary to enter the path gradually dissolves and with it the notion that there is any such attainable state as \"liberation,\" \"enlightenment\" and \"Buddhahood.\" Thus .Aryadeva needed a Guru to tell him that he had achieved all that there was to achieve, which is to say, the recognition of his original condition as nirvaJ;la. The metaphysics of sadhana can be conceived as a sacred dream that derives its validity from the power to take the initiate out of his samsaric condition only to return him to his starting point free of all mental obscurations and emotional defilements."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Aryadeva (Karrtarzpa) 135 · Aryadeva's state of innocence and purity was an irresistible attrac-tion to women. This must have arisen from his inability to conceive of women as external objects, particularly as sexual objects. Nagar-juna, still not entirely free of lust, had spent twelve years pro-pitiating female elementals; Aryadeva attracted female spirits to serve him without any effort whatsoever. His disinterest in the tree-nymph129 induced her to display herself to him unsolicited. The woman who followed him may also have intuited Aryadeva's condi-tion, but she wanted to exploit it. In another Tibetan account of this episode the woman was a saiva tantrika who needed the eye for a reason similar to the brahmin's need for Nagarjuna's head; she re-quired the eye of a learned monk to complete the prerequisites for attainment of siddhi. She may have been a kiipiilika. · Nagarjuna's alchemical sadhana is called \"the alchemy of mer-cury.\"130 Nagarjuna was one of the foremost rasiiyana siddhas (see p. 120), and greatness in this yoga can be defined as the initiate's ability to apply the alchemical process at every level of his being. Thus in the alchemy of mercury, on the physical plane a material substance, a herbal or mineral panacea, is produced that will bestow immortality (or transmute base metal to gold, according to the alchemist's precepts). On the level of the subtle body, by a hafhayoga technique analogous to the process of creating the actual alchemical substance, that is to say, through control of the psychic energies that correspond to the \"mica\" (abhra) in the \"seed\" of the divine woman, and control of the creative seed (bodhidtta) of the divine man, an immortal, subtle body is created that is capable of the sensual pleasure and mental abilities of the gross physical body. Finally, on the absolute level, \"a body of light\" identical to the dhar-makiiya is realized, and this is immortal in the sense that it is beyond creation and destruction and beyond birth and death. To attain this final level is to attain mahiimudrii-siddhi. To attain the immortal subtle body, as do the niiths of the legends, is to attain mundane st\"d-dhz' or magical powers. By such a crude delineation of the metaphysics of rasiiyana it can be seen how the alchemy of mercury is compatible with other siddha-yogas, such as the techniques of the creative and fulfillment processes of meditation.

As to the eighth-ninth century Aryadeva, it is notable that he wrote nothing on rasayana; it was the tenth century Nagarjuna who was the rasayana-st'ddha; the Catu;Pitha-tantra ap-pears to have been his sphere of practice and commentary. Taranatha's following story of Aryadeva concerns the second cen-. tury mahayana philosopher, but has added, tantric elements.m Aryadeva was born from a lotus in the pleasure garden of the King of Sri Lanka. He abdicated after reaching the throne and took or-dination. He completed study of the Trt'fn'taka, and on pilgrimage to India he met Nagarjuna and sat at his feet on Sri Parvata Moun-tain (at Srisailam), receiving mahayana teaching besides rasayana instruction, and he attained magical powers. After Nagarjuna's death Aryadeva built many monasteriesin the South. He remained there until he was called by a message attached to the neck of a crow that had emanated from the heart of a self-manifest image of Mahakala at Nalanda, begging him to go North and defeat a brahmin tantrika called \"The Evil One Difficult to Subdue\". (Ac-cording to Bu ston this brahmin was the great poet Matrceta-ca. AD 160-who composed many beautiful Buddhist verses after his conversion.) On the journey he was waylaid by a woman who re-quired his eye for use in her sadhana. Then \"with the help of a shameless layman, a cat, and a jar of black oil, he subdued a sister-pav-(it'ta, a parrot, and chalk of the brahmins. He encircled the place of contest with the brahmin with mantra, and tattered rags, etc., so that Mahadeva could not enter into the heart of his oppo-nent.\" Aryadeva defeated this brahmin, arrested him and imprison-ed him in a temple where in a sutra he read a prediction of his own conversion and accordingly converted to Buddhism.

But the monk did not need an answer to his question. \"Do not tell lies,\" he said. \"If you speak falsely, when your karma matures you will be reborn in hell.

I lie to everybody without exception.

He gave him the in-itiation which completely matures the immature mind-stream, and then taught him these precepts. \"All elements of perceptual ex-perience whatsoever are deceiving from the beginning. Since all that you see, all that you hear, all that you perceive with the six senses, indeed all that you experience, is deceiving, contemplate all things as a lie.\" Ignorant of phenomena's delusz'veness You say you lie; But if knowledge and the knower are deceptive And the six sense-fields and sense objects deceive you, Where can truth be found.?

So contemplate all experience As inherently deceptive: See all form as inherently deceptive; Hear all sound as z'nherently deceptive; And fi'nally, regard your belief in deception as a lie. Thaganapa meditated for seven years upon perceptual knowledge · as deception, gaining the understanding that all experience of phenomena is delusive fiction. Through this realization he gained perfect detachment. He went to his Guru thinking that he had at-tained the ultimate goal, but his Guru gave him further instruction. \"The elements of experience can never be established as either deception or truth. Reality is uncreated and indeterminate.

Then able to accept conflicting thoughts and feelings as the path, he gained siddhi. He became known everywhere as the Guru Thaganapa, and taught those with good karma the means of \"releasing water in the ear by means of water.\" Finally, he rose into the J;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana Thaganapa's sadhana in the initial, creative phase is an excellent paradigm of the \"like cures like\" technique of tantric meditation. Releasing water in the ear by means of water134 is analogous to detaching oneself from phenomena by visualizing the rope of ex-perience as a snake. Detached, he saw phenomena as a dream, an hallucination, a fairy castle in the sky, the reflection of the moon in water, the image in a mirror, an echo, and so forth, achieving detachment's associated qualities of clarity, control and equanimity. His perception of phenomena as a distortion of reality unworthy of credence, as a lie, was modified in the second part of his practice, the fulfillment stage, so that he came to the understanding that reality was neither truth nor deception, neither this nor that, nothing that could be pinned down and labelled; it was tathatii, the ineffable immediacy of the here and now that is best described as emptiness. Completing this practice, even when passion and its ac-companying greedy or bitter thoughts, for example, arose in his mind, phenomena would all be emptiness, and the question as to whether it was deceptive or true was irrelevant. Contemplation of appearances as a lie is a highly efficacious technique using pre-conditioned reflexes to cut the clinging to, and identification with, phenomena. There are many examples of the like cures like method in later legends, most of them showing the siddha meditating upon the particular sensual sphere or object with which he is obsessed. Thaganapa's compulsion was in the mental sphere, and his initial practice would have been discursive, as it is not immediately apparent why \"it's all a lie,\" why phenomena are deceptive. Phenomena are analyzed in terms of the six sense-fields, which consist of the eighteen elements of perception: the six sensory stimuli, the six sense organs and the six types of consciousness (ear, eye, nose, tongue, body and mental consciousnesses). The six sense-fields are the media through which the mind projects its precon-ceived images of phenomena, and so long as mind is \"ignorant,\" its projections are delusive. Ignorance originally arises through a lack"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Siddha Thaganapa 141 of mindfulness and attention, causing insecurity and fear, and alienation from phenomena and other people, that results in dualistic perception and the conceptualizing and labelling process that concretes such a reality. To the extent that the universe consists of labelled concepts, it is a lie; it is a fictional world distorted by the mind, and the. conditioned conviction of our society that it is the only reality is an enormous hurdle on the path to an alternative, greater perspective. \"Insanity,\" in part, is the dominance of subjec-tive realities that have frightened unfortunate individuals who have been de-conditioned fortuitously; and western psychology's answer, particularly the Behaviorists' answer, to this kind of problem is to re· establish the delusory, objective reality.

The host was most generous, giving the mendicant yogin eighty-four different types of curry, amongst which was a rare delicacy. He carried them back to Tilopa, who was delighted with the delicacy. \"Where did you find this, my son?\" he asked. \"Please bring some more.\" Naropa was as happy as a Bodhisattva on the first level of the path. \"I have sat at my Guru's feet for twelve years without so much as a 'Who are you?' \" he thought to himself, \"and today he calls me his son.\" He was ecstatic. He returned to the wedding feast four more times to satisfy his Guru's desire for the delicacy, and each time it was given ungrudgingly. But returning a fifth time he thought, \"I am ashamed to beg for the same curry again, yet if I do not I will incur my Guru's displeasure. I will steal it.\" So when the wedding guests were preoccupied, he stole a pot of the curry and walked off with it. Tilopa was delighted with his disciple's perseverence, calling him \"my diligent son.\" He then bestowed the initiation and blessing of Vajra Varahi upon him and instructed him in meditation. It took Naropa six months of practice to gain mahiimudrii-sz'ddhi. Thereafter he became known throughout the world, and devotees came to worship him from the four quarters of the earth. The light that emanated from his body could be seen at a distance of one month's journey from his hermitage. After working tirelessly for countless disciples he rose bodily into the l)akini's Paradise. Siidhana This synopsis of Naropa's famous story hardly does the Guru justice. It is not that he is characterized as a mixed-caste son of a liq-uor dealer, a wood gatherer himself, and a man of little intellect, rather than the scion of a royal Bengali brahmin family, of stagger-ing intellectual brilliance, Abbot of Nalanda; it is that after having stolen the curry at the wedding feast the narrator allows him to walk off with it to receive Tilopa's praise, rather than to be pursued by irate guests, roasted in an iron box, and beaten to an inch of his life. \"Thrashed like rice and like sesame seed crushed,\" moaned Naropa. \"This twisted copper kettle of sarp.sara deserves to be smashed,\" replied his Guru.138 In the wonderful biography of Naropa, available in English, the seemingly well-balanced, wise and suc-cessful Abbot of Nalanda comes to a mid-life crisis, caused"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Niiropa 145 perhaps by the schizoid stress of continuous absorption in the mere academic theory of a non-dual philosophy wherein simple sensual perception is elevated to divine enjoyment, and a state of beatitude is reached through cessation of metaphysical objectification and logical discursiveness.

On the road, eleven more visions, mostly of a repulsive nature, gradually undermine Naropa's conventional pre-judices and humanistic values such as honesty, humanity and pur-ity. His Guru is the embodiment of a mind quite free of concep-tualization and conflicting thought, 140 and Naropa can encounter him only when he is as Tilopa is. Even after their meeting, before he can obtain teaching he must suffer twelve further acts of self-denial, twelve acts like the story of his begging at the wedding party, with the death of Naropa's ego indicated at its conclusion either by the final moral indignity of theft or by a physical beating to the point of death. Destruction of belief in an \"I\" is the aim of Naropa's ascetic acts. For instance, in order to obtain instruction in eternal delight141 Naropa is ordered to find a girl, who he proceeds to live with for some time in health and fidelity, happiness and love. Later they drift apart, and Naropa is left demeaning himself as a miserable smith, where Tilopa finds him. Then, in order to gain instruction in the sameness of the one flavor of the six modes of cognition, 142 Naropa suffers his Guru's chastisement for living with a girl, and beats his penis in anguish. Before Naropa can attain Mahamudra precepts, Tilopa demands the girl for himself and beats her for turning her back on him and smiling at Naropa. \"Bliss is to offer the mudrii as fee to the guru,\" said Naropa. \"You are worthy of bliss eternal, Naropa,\" replies his Guru. Naropa's sadhana is his life with his Guru; his twelve acts are real initiations, and success in practic-ing his precepts manifests after only six months. Tilopa disappears, finally, after giving Naropa the most incisive precept in Mahamudra: \"Do not imagine, think, deliberate, meditate, act, but be at rest.

One day a monk came to his hovel to beg food, and he fell at the monk's feet in obeisance; Then he brought food and drink and spoke of the latest news.

Build a hut in the cremation ground and live there with the jackals,\" the monk instructed. Syalipa obeyed, and gradually he came to realize all sound as the union of sound and emptiness. He lost his fear of the jackals' howl-ing and experienced self-liberating terror as fearless pleasure. After nine years of meditation, the defilements of his body and mind had vanished, and he attained mahiimudrii-siddhi. Thereafter he wore a jackal skin to signify his attainment of the one flavor of all things, and he became known as The jackal-Yogin, Syalipa. He taught his disciples many different practices concerning the indivisibility of ap-pearances and emptiness, and finally he rose bodily into the l;>akini's Paradise. Sadhana Fear was the mind-poison confronting Syalipa, and rather than run away from it, or apply an antidote such as music or love, he ac-cepted the advice of the monk, his Guru, who advised him to abolish it by discovering its nature. Then in the process of conquering the little fear, he could overcome the chief fear in life, the suffering of birth, existence, death and rebirth. Meditating on his fear of the jackals' howl he eradicated the basic fear that arises in a split mind conceiving the ego and phenomena, self and others, the knower and the known, as alienated, discrete entities. Through a homeopathic tantric technique he destroyed his fear with fear.147 First, like Thaganapa visualizing all phenomena as a lie, Syalipa identified all sound as the jackals' howl, thus detaching himself from the specific cause of his fear and cultivating all sound as an echo-like illusion. When all mental interference is removed from the sensory percep-tion of sound, then awareness of the subtle nuances of sound, of the meaning of modulated tone and pitch, of vibration outside the fre-quency of the ear, and of the entire rich and rewarding universe of sound, is heightened incredibly; just as Vi:J;Iapa mastered the vitzii when he stopped thinking about it, Syalipa was likewise rewarded as an auditor of speech and natural sound. But that was a by-product of his sadhana; the principal effect was that his terror became self-liberating in an experience of pure pleasure as he intuited the empty sound of silence in the jackals' howls and eventually in all sound.

To unite sound and emptiness is to unite appearance and emptiness, thought and emptiness, and all things whatsoever with emptiness; if emptiness is perceived in one medium it is perceived simultaneously in all media. Thus Syalipa attained mahiimudrii-siddhi. In his song of realization Syalipa uses the metaphor of a painting to show the foolishness of our fears. Examine the source of fear when moved to terror by a painting and what we find is mere shape and color; examine the origin of fear provoked by a terrible sound, and after removing the mental associations, preconceptions and accom-panying emotional response, what remains is an empty echo of a particular timbre and pitch. Second, in the same way that the mind creates an horrific image out of the artist's clever manipulation of color and shape in two dimensions, the mind creates appearances out of an inchoate plentitude of energy and vibration. Finite time and spaciallimitaiton are productions of the mind, and phenomena are formed as projections of their own limited conceptual images. Insofar as races, tribes and societies have developed differently, there are variations in their visions of the universe. The Tibetan reality, for instance, animistic and spiritualistic, where everything is conceived as a god or a demon in planes of spiritual extension from the mind, is quite different from our scientific, materialistic vision. When European man believed in a flat earth, for him the earth was flat; now that we believe in a global earth, the earth is round; when Einstein's theory of relativity is a popular notion, curved space will be as ordinary as baked beans; when we believe that phenomena conform to our concepts of them we will identify with the founda· tion of all things ( iilaya) that is emptiness and clear light and watch all possibilities manifest as the I)akini's dance, and time and space wilJ have been conquered.

He changed his monastic robes for tat-tered rags, and left this note in his room: \"I will never return. Do not attempt to follow me.\" Then he fled into the night.

A tabula rasa to be defined according to our need, Tilopa appeared not to suffer fools lightly, to have cared nothing for either moral or social convention, and to have practiced what he preached uncompromisingly. Almost contemptuous of humanistic values, he seems to have demanded from his disciples an utterly unbiased and impartial mind, above all capable of the vision of indeterminate, ultimate reality. In his song of realization the key phrase that indicates the substance of such a vision is \"pure potential, \"148 he sees all· things as pure potential, and what begins as pure potential cannot become anything other than that, and this is experientialJy confirmed in the vision of all things as kinetic space, a ceaseless panorama of transforming illusion devoid of any substantiality whatsoever.

Meru (the protrusive axis mundt), naturally partake of the nature of space. To his lineage, Tilopa personifies a one-pointed, unswerving fidelity to that end and to the induction of others into that vision. The nearest Naropa comes to substantiating or humanizing his Guru is to describe Tilopa as \"a dark man dressed in cotton trousers, his hair knotted in a tuft, and with protruding, blood-shot eyes. \"lU The Tibetans like to depict Tilopa as a yogin-siddha with a hair-knot, carrying the fish that identifies him.

Although Naropa took a long time to realize it, from the beginning his Guru was a state of mind, specifically non-discrimination, and in general a pure awareness of all phenomena and noumena. Thus in his remarks about his Guru, Naropa tells us more about himself than the human being Tilopa. Naropa was the pre-eminent disciple who was capable of visualizing his Guru as a metaphysical plane of experience, and Tilopa was the utterly selfless Guru who was able to demand that vision from a disciple.

As Naropa was Tilopa's only known disciple, and our only source of information about the Guru, it is clear why we know so lit-tle of him. Hz'storz'ography Our uninformative legend does not mention how Tilopa was in-itiated; he certainly had no major siddha-Guru. In his History, Taranatha does not mention Tilopa at all. The Tibetan lineages show that he took the Guhyasamiija initiation from Nagarjuna's disciple Nagabodhi; this must have been an initiation through vi-sion. He received his Sa1)'tvara initiations from Vijayapada and/ or Vinayapada, and/ or Vlpapada, and from Kusalapa. Bhadrapa gave him the Hevajra initiation. The mother-tantras were certainly Tilopa's path. The Kiilacakra-tantra also came through Vi-jayapada. But it has been suggested that Tilopa is Kalacakrapada in the Kiilacakra-tantra lineage;150 this dubious proposition is based upon the arbitrary identification of Tilopa with Tsilupa (seep. 171 ). Could the pre-eminent renunciate Tilopa, who taught only one disciple and wrote nothing of great importance, have been the academic commentator with many disciples who was Kalacakrapada Senior? It is only possible if Tilopa was a Nalanda paru}ita before his renunciation. A final deficiency in our Naropa/Tilopa legends is the implication that Tilopa did not attain mahiimudrii-sz'ddhi until the end of Naropa's twelve year waiting sadhana. It is improbable that Tilopa's irascible treatment of his disciple was a defense against the impor-tunate Naropa begging precepts before his Guru had realized the meaning of his own sadhana. Certainly Naropa's biography implies that Tilopa was a realized siddha at the start of Naropa's quest. If Naropa lived AD 1016-1100, Tilopa would have been born during the second half of the tenth century, living through the first half of the eleventh.

Since all pleasure and pain is caused by mental conditions, insofar as you are not now besieged by attachments, your present attitude is determining a happy future disposition. Constant meditation means a continuous, undistracted effort to attend to your mind. In this way mental delusion will be reduced and the goal of Buddhahood will be reached in this lifetime.\" Catrapa stayed in Seti.dhonagar practicing his meditation, and after six years he attained mahiimudrii-sz'ddhz'. He became famous as the yogin Catrapa, and after seven hundred years he entered the l)akini's Paradise. Sadhana Catrapa's practice began with the cathartic therapy of confession. Confession empties the mind of all guilt and brings to the surface, and exorcises, actions, words, thoughts and feelings that have condi-tioned the mind in perverse attitudes that perpetuate negative kar-ma. But after confession has purified the mind, eradicating negative conditioning (the principal result of psychoanalysis), the function of bringing every action to the attention of an absolving awareness is the function of the meditation that is Catrapa's central sadhana. The precept \"attend to the nature of your mind\" sounds simple, but is actually the most difficult of practices. If achieved, the phenomena that are the mind's skillfully created means of percep-tion 151 are a stream of compassionate emanation in an indivisible union with perfect insight into its emptiness, 152 and the feeling tone is pure pleasure. This cognitive non-duality is depicted iconographically as Hevajra in union with his l)akini Nairatma, into whose ma:v<]ala Catrapa was initiated. This union is experienced as Mahamudra and the powers of which the mind is capable at this moment are called mahiimudrii-sz'ddhz'. With Mahamudra achieved there is no need of a human Guru; the non-dual awareness of all things as pure space provides inspira-tion and blessing, and whatever is perceived instructs the yogin on his course.

The concepts of virtue and vice and the moral laws of cause and effect govern a conditioned mind structured to function effectively within society; past lives' karma has set seeds of passion and conceptualization that are best controlled by moral constraint and practice of virtue. Tantra introduces a more efficient way of handling passion and thought, and, further, puts the yogin in touch with the source of the Bodhisattva's aspiration. Innocence defined as the absence of moral, and all other conceptual, functions of the mind, is a characteristic of Mahamudra; thus, when like a child the yogin does not sin and has no perception of sin, cultivating innocence he induces the non-dual perception of Mahamudra.

However, uncleanliness incurred lightly can be purified with ease; a bath in a sacred river washes away all ritual impurity, besides personal sin and misdoing. A bath in Mother Ganga, India's holy river, guarantees rebirth in Siva's paradise-Svarga. The notion of ritual impurity is as old as Aryan India. As a system of occupation-related clans out-side of which a man could not marry, the caste system probably ex-isted before the white Aryan tribes arrived in India, but the Aryans imposed a race-based class system upon the already existing hierar-chy. Their fourfold apartheid was described by color (var~a or caste literally means \"color\")-white Aryans, brown Dravidians and black tribals (adivasz's). The racial bigotry of the caste system was opposed by the Buddha himself on the grounds that all equally possess the Buddha-nature, and the siddhas made ritual equality a central issue in their beliefs, not only because so many of them were outcastes and subject to prejudice, but also on compassionate grounds. Thus, although the siddhas were not social activists, their compassion was manifest in personal communication and an insistence that their in-itiates forsook all notions of caste. Herein \"caste\" is used as a symbol of all prejudice and preconception168 and karmic proclivity.164 The brahmin abandoning his \"caste\" is ridding his mind of all concep-tual obstacles to Buddhahood, and a very painful sadhana it must have been, although that aspect is not stressed in Bhadrapa's legend. With a little imagination the bare bones of Bhadrapa's rela-tion with his Guru can be fleshed out to present a picture of wretched humiliation and mortification of the proud brahmin (see also J;>engipa 31). Hypersensitively and hypocritically concerned with the opinions of his peers, he was forced to clean away excre-ment just like the Living Buddhas (tulkus) and theocrats \"re-educated\" by the Red Guards in Tibet in the 1960s. A common, skillful device of the tantric Guru bent on enlightening his disciple on the \"fast\" path, is to concentrate upon the disciple's weaknesses, often publicly highlightitig them, until the disciple's emotional at-tachments are destroyed. Since a blinding negative emotional response in the disciple is virtually inevitable, a very profound faith cemented by the commitments of initiation are essential. The structure of Bhadrapa's precepts accords with the four"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"162 Masters of Mahamudra goal. Although simple, concise, discursive precepts can be given under these heads with decisive results, Bhadrapa's Guru gives him precepts as symbols. The meaning of the first is self-evident; the sec-ond, the plastering of the yogin's hut, symbolic of the Bodhisattva-siddha's action, gains its significance from the brahmin's ritual scruples and from his aversion to the low-caste laborer's job of mix-ing plaster from excrement and mud and painting it with lime. The third, the color white, is symbolic of the sameness of all things, ubi-quitous in the same way that color is inherent in paint. Lastly, vi· sion, meditation and action are one in the omnipresent, all-embracing foundation of the universe156 that is emptiness. Historz'ography From the Tibetan Sa1J'tvara and Kiilacakra initiation lineages, 1117 we learn that Bhadrapa is the disciple of KaJ;thapa168 and the Guru of Vijayapada, Vinayapada and ViJ;tapada (although these three near homophones suggest error in a Tibetan scribe or block-carver's work). This identification would place Bhadrapa in the tenth cen· tury. But Savaripa also had a disciple named Bhadrapa, 159 and there is record of a Bhavabhadrapa of VikramaSila who wrote a commentary upon the Hevajra-tantra (the tantra of our legend's Bhadrapa) during King Dharmapala's reign, 160 and who would have been a: contemporary of Savaripa, which would place him in the lat· ter eighth and early ninth centuries. Bhadra (T. bZang po) means \"good\" or \"auspicious,\" and often forms the second part of a compound name as in Bhavabhadrapa, Kusalibhadra, Dipatikarabhadra, Sakyasribhadra and Buddhasribhadra, and as Ratnakarasanti is contracted to Santipa, Kr~J;tacarya to Caryapa, so compound names with -bhadra are reduced to Bhadrapa; thus there is much room for misidentification."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"25 THE SIDDHA DUKHANDHI THE SCAVENGER Uniting the relative, creative process Wz'th the ultimate, fulfillment mode, The result of my Mahamudra meditation A rose as pure awareness of the Buddha's Three Bodies. In the city of Gandhapur there lived a scavenger of rags, a sweeper by caste, called Dukhandhi. He gained his livelihood by scaveng-ing pieces of cloth and patching them together to make passable garments. One day he met an accomplished yogin, who pointed out to him the fatuity of his almost inhuman existence, suggesting that it would be more profitable for him to practice a tantric Buddhist sadhana. The scavenger was doubtful that anyone would teach him, but the yogin immediately offered to give him initiation and instruc-tion. So it was that Dukhaildhi received the initiation and empower-ment of the deity Sarpvara and instruction in the unity of creative and fulfillment meditation. He attempted to meditate in the con-ventional manner, but he was hindered by his preoccupation with stitching rags. He returned to his Guru and told him that his mind was full of thought, and that he found it impossible to visualize the deity or concentrate upon recitation of the mantra. The yogin gave him instruction in the transformation of mental activity into the path itself. The intrinsz'c nature of all things is infinz'te space So in realz'ty there are no stz'tches and no stitching. The intrinsic nature of deity and mantra is TA THA TA; Realz'ze dez'ty, mantra, and all thought forms, as infinite space."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"164 Masters of Mahamudra Dukhandhi followed these instructions, and gradually his thoughts of stitches and stitching, together with the deity and the mantra, dissolved into the space that is the nature of all things. Thereby he understood the meaning of uniting creative and fulfill-ment modes of meditation. After twelve years he gained mahiimudrii-siddht', and he served untold beings before attaining the I;>akini's Paradise. Sadhana This Dukhandhi, born into the most unfortunate body a human being could possess, has a remarkable name meaning \"He who makes two into one\" (Dvikhandi, T.gNyis gcig tu byed pa), or \"He who unites duality.\" His legend and song clarify several vital con-cepts in the technique of Mahamudra meditation. The duality he unites is expressed as the creative and fulfillment processes of meditation, 161 the former being the clearly perceived forms of phenomena, the relative world, and the latter being the ultimate, reality of emptiness or such-ness (tathatii). The thought of his work162 is given the same ontological status as his visualization of the deity and recitation of the mantra in the instruction called \"transforming. mental activity into the path itself. \"168 Meditating upon the intrinsic nature of deity (body), mantra (speech) and thought (mind) the relative and the absolute are united, or their union is focused in awareness since they have never been divided in reality. \"Thought of stitches and stitching\" can also be interpreted as thought about the technique and practice of one's meditation, which is one of the meditator's major obstacles. He can become as preoccupied in pondering the metaphysical theory of his medita-tion, the degree of his progress and the nature of the result, as in his meditation itself. It is then that the precepts on transforming thought into the path are so valuable. Such precepts are what gives tantric meditation its reputation as a \"fast\" and \"direct\" method, for every obstruction becomes an ally on the path. In these epitomes of the siddhas' sadhanas, obviously much detail is omitted. Dukhandhi's meditation took twelve years to evolve. The principles of his meditation are very clearly described, but detailed practical instruction is lacking. For instance: in order to meditate upon the intrinsic nature of deity and mantra, the deity, perfectly visualized, must have become the realm of the Buddha's appari-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Siddha Dukharidhi 165 tional form; and mantra, recited with perfect concentration, must have become a constant stream of sound. With the deity a living symbol of apparitional being (nirmiittakiiya), and mantra the epitome of the entire spectrum of vibration, they become objects of meditation, which the elusive, patchy, beginner's visualization, and the mantric stream only intermittently attended to, can never be. But there is no instruction upon perfecting visualization and man-tra. The result of this meditation is expressed both as the dissolution of all things into infinite space and attainment of the Buddha's three modes of being, which are apparitional being, instructive visionary being, and absolute empty being. These three are the \"subjective\" equivalents of the \"objective\" deity, mantra and thought: deity is the apparitional form of Buddha's compassion; mantra or vibration is the medium of enjoyable visionary instruction; and all thought is non-dual empty awareness with a feeling-tone of pure pleasure. Historiography The variants of Dukhatidhi's name are Dokhatidi, Debanta, Dhosanti, Dvakanti, Khatidhipa (but see Kantali, 69) and also the Tibetan rDo khan do.

In the great city of Pataliputra a wealthy householder was blessed with a son. But this son was a mixed blessing. As he grew up he became so fat that he was unable to walk, eat, defecate or sit up by himself. His parents and family were helpless, for neither en-couragement nor threat was of any avail, and finally, thoroughly abusing him, they carried him down to the cremation ground and abandoned him. He had not been there long before a yogin noticed his abject condition, took pity on him, and brought him food. But the boy was unable to sit up to put it in his mouth. \"If you can't get up to eat, how can you possibly do anything at all?\" the yogin said. \"I'm completely useless,\" whined the lad. \"That is why my parents left me here to die.\" \"I wonder if you could practice a sadhana lying down like that,\" pondered the yogin. \"I think I could,\" said the boy. \"But who would teach someone like me?\" The yogin offered to instruct him. He initiated the wastrel into the ma:J).~ala of Hevajra and instructed him in a profound fulfill-ment process of meditation. \"Visualize a sphere no larger than a mustard seed on the tip of your nose, your \"upper door,\" and then visualize a hundred million worlds within that seed,\" the yogin taught him."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Siddha Ajogi 167 \"What signs will occur?\" asked the boy. \"Meditate as I have instructed you, and you'll find out soon enough,\" the yogin replied. The boy meditated, and the hundred million worlds within worlds together with the seed dissolved into a sphere of emptiness, and realization of the emptiness of Mahamuddi arose in his every moment of experience. After nine years he obtained mahiimudrii-siddhi and became famous as the yogin Ajogi, The Wastrel. Then working selflessly for others eventually he attained the l)akini's Paradise. Siidhana Ajogi is the ultimate example of the despised and rejected, freakish yogin. Physically and mentally incapacitated, with nothing to do but practice the simplest of yogas lying on his back, never-theless he became a siddha. The possibilities of transferring such tan-tric practices into contemporary hospitals and asylums are immense and exciting; modifying the language and application to suit the situation, the least effect of such rehabilitation therapy would be to destroy inertia and enlarge mental capacity, with the possible result of inducing mahiimudrii-siddht\". What is lacking in the western asylum environment, however, is aspiration and stimulus to prac-tice. Ajogi was provoked to act by his need for the food and affection provided by his Guru, and by the fear of death as he lay in the cremation ground. There is no fulfillment meditation technique more simple than that taught to Ajogi. The hundred million worlds within the mustard seed consist of the three successive dimensions of increas-ingly diminutive microcosmic universes, analogous to the atomic and sub-atomic worlds.164 A moment's attempt to visualize this mustard seed and its contents will demonstrate the effectiveness of this method of dissolving thought into emptiness. It has an effect similar to imagining non-existence. This technique also demonstrates the principle that once emptiness has been established in any one corner of the mind it becomes constant in the entire mind-stream.

Soon after he had settled down in his new environment, he began talking with a yogin who sympathized with his predicament and offered to instruct him in a sadhana.

Thereafter he became famous as the yogin Kalapa, and ultimately he reached the l;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana The meaning of creative and fulfillment meditations, in short, is to create a vision of phenomenal appearances that is quite free of mental interferences such as preconception, prejudice, interpreta· tion, dualistic conception, so that the yogin in his environment becomes a god in his heaven; then all experience is fulfilled by penetrating the illusion of appearances to realize the nature of all things as emptiness, and thereby the yogin is released from the wheel of existence. When appearances are understood as a function of mind, all things can be reduced to thought, and thought to \"a retinue of gods.\" The basic letter A: is defined linguistically as the explosive opening of the glottis necessary to allow air to pass through to the vocal chords so that sound can issue, and in that way it is the sound inherent in all sounds. Thus, symbolically, it represents the sound of silence, the unborn sound, 166 and the emptiness into which thought as deities can dissolve. The people of Rajapur, without ex· perience of the doors of perception thrown open, of reality ex· perienced directly, unfiltered by the conditioned mind, called Kalapa's uninhibited action \"madness.\" His thought-free samadhi (nirvz'kalpa-samadhz), the non-dual samadhi that had destroyed the delusion of alienation between himself and people and phenomena, unleashed an effusion of spontaneous action unhindered by any moral constraint, social convention or notion of personal advance· ment.

The social situation that drove Kalapa to the cremation ground effects women far more than men in our society, producing neurosis and sometimes psychosis. Like Kalapa, attractive women are viewed as objects of sexual desire, or at least as esthetic feasts for the senses, and they become painfully alienated from people. A certain kind of woman can manipulate the situation to her own advantage, gaining power over her fascinated admirers, but at the cost of all empathy. Other women are hypersensitive to \"objectification,\" and, feeling insulted, become aggressive; others retreat into themselves and pre-tend, sometimes successfully, to ignore the attention. Either way is painful, creating anxiety that leads to neurosis of the various types found amongst emotionally-involved feminists. Kalapa's initial reac-tion was a disgusted retreat from society, followed by physical renunciation of the society from which he felt divided. The am-brosial nectar of the Guru's precepts was the cure of his neurosis. Historz'ography Nothing in this legend but the name suggests the identification of Kalapa with Kalacakrapada (Kala~pada). But since Kala-pada is one of the great siddhas, scholars have assumed that he is counted amongst the eighty-four and that Kalapa is he. Kala-pada Senior is identified with Celuka (Tsi lu pa, 54); Celuka's principal disciple, PiQQOpa, or PiQQa Acarya, was called Kala-pada Junior, and it is the latter who is identified with our Kalapa.167 These siddhas belong to the transmission lineages of the Kiilacakra-tantra. Celuka taught Pi:vQopa at Pulahari, so some pundits have presumed to identify Kala-pada Junior with Naropa.168 Pi:vQopa is said to have memor-ized the Kiilacakra-tantra after hearing it only once. This great fac-ulty of memory was obtained in a strange way. In his past life he was dim-witted, and he performed a sadhana to improve his intellect. A deva appeared to him in a dream, instructing him to sculpt a statue of Kurukulla I;>akini out of coral, to insert it in the mouth of a dead woman's corpse, and to meditate sitting upon the corpse. He meditated for seven years according to this instruction, and then the woman gazed up at him and asked him what he wanted. Instead of asking her for the ability to remember everything he read, he asked her for memory of everything he wrote.

However, even the identification of Kala-pada Junior with Pip.c;lopa is disputable. The Tibetan translators Rwa-lo and 'Bro received the Kiilacakra-tantra a generation after the transmission of Kala-pada Father and Son; the Rwa-lo tradition, followed by 'Gos Lotsawa, favors the above lineage: Celuka, Pip.c;lopa, Mahapufiya. But the 'Bro tradition reverses Celuka and Pip.c;lopa, calling Pip.c;lopa the Kala-pada Senior who went to Sambhala to obtain the Kiilacakra-tantra. As a further complication, Bu ston identifies Kala-pada Junior as Bodhibhadra, otherwise known as Nalendrapa,170 the disciple of both Celuka and Pip.c;lopa, and also of Naropa; he could also have been Upa~aka Bodhi (seep. 282). To summarize: in the latter half of the eleventh century and early twelfth, there were at least five great masters of the Kiilacakra-tantra in Eastern India, particularly at Nalanda: Celuka, Pip.c;lopa, Bodhibhadra, Somanath and Mahapufiya. Two of these were known as Kala-pada Father and Son, Senior and Junior, and they were responsible for establishing the Kiilacakra-tantra lineage that was transmitted to Tibet. Kalapa is reckoned as the last of the eighty-four siddhas. If Celuka lived well into the twelfth century it is reasonable to expect that his son out-lived him and it is conceivable that Kala-pada Junior saw the downfall of the Sena Empire when the Senas succeed-ed the Piilas in the year AD 1162."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"28 THE SIDDHA DHOBIPA THE WISE WASHERMAN From tz'me z'mmemorz\"al I have washed out staz'ns, But I cannot make charcoal whz'te.

Siidhana The stress on cleanliness and purity in many legends may appear contrived unless the Hindu obsession with ritual purity is recalled. The twice daily sniin, the ritual bath, and successive changes of clothes, are accepted routines of life for the twice-born. Thus Bhadrapa, the brahmin, was left alone to talk about the real nature of cleanliness while his friends went to bathe; and here the dhobis work is washing clothes, and the yogin's secret is the ultimate bath, a cleansing in the water of immortality that makes the ritual conven-tion, the relative or symbolic truth, dispensable. The Guru's three secrets are no hidden precepts; they are the principal means of purification and propitiation, the means of transforming sa:rpsiira into nirviiQ.a. Mudra, mantra, and samadhi, can be considered as physical, auditory and mental pegs upon which to hang aids to awareness along the path; first aids to concentration (samatha), then to heighten vision (vz'pasyanii), and finally to ultimate insight into reality (prajfiii).

Before he had gone far his mother appeared in the sky before him, and he recognized her as a J;>akini for the first time. She gave him the SaiJlvara initiation and taught him how to meditate. Then she vanished, and he continued on his way. He wandered for twelve years from town to town, sleeping in cremation grounds and practicing his sadhana. When he eventually gained mahiimudrii-st'ddhz' he levitated into the sky, and suddenly he was faced with his mother and her retinue of I;>akinis. \"Why are you indulging your power in this way,\" she chided. \"It would be better if you worked for the benefit of people below.\" The master came down to earth, and intent upon selfless service he traveled west to the land of 0QQiyaJ;la, to Mailgalapur, a city of two hundred and fifty thousand households.

With Saroruha (seep. 345) he is credited with bringing the mother-tantras, particularly the Hevajra-tantra, from Oc;lr,liya~a, the Land of the l;>akinis, to eastern India, though such an assertion raises chronological problems;173 and his reputation as a master of the mantrayana was so high that some considered him the original authority on the tantras.

What would appear to be the correct version, 177 translated herein, has Kambala offer one torma to Heruka's I)akini consort. Heruka is a form of SaiJlVara, and his consort, Vajra Varahi, is the ultimate female archetype, emptiness devoid of ego, who controls all ramifications of anz'ma energy. Thus the earth goddess, a female elemental power (yak#), immediately did Kambala's bidding.

One journey Kambala undertook to O~~iya~a is remembered for his contest in magic with Lalitavajra, who had just gained mundane siddhz'. Arriving before the Muru~c;laka Mountain Lalitavajra took the form of Yamari (Yamantaka) and cleft the mountain with a sword to make a passage. On the return journey they approached the mountain at night, and Kambala caused it to disappear, surpris· ing Lalitavajra in the morning when he found the mountain behind him.I79 In Oc;l~iya~a Kambala and Lalitavajra had visited King In· drabhiiti (42), the brother of Lak~mitikara (82), and the king who was hassled by the witches that Kambala subjugated. Further, Kam· bala honored this king by sleeping outside his palace for three (or twelve) years. Whoever neglected to make obeisance to the siddha would become rigid in the calf, while those who bowed down could pass on.180 This gained him the sobriquet The Sleeping Bhik~u, although he is best known in Tibet as Lwa wa pa (Lwa ba pa, Ba wa pa) because he habitually wore only one piece of cloth. He is also known as Kamaripa and Sri Prabhata. The inevitable problem of identification concerning Kambala arises with those Tibetan· historians who identify Kambala, or Lwa wa pa, with Indrabhiiti the Younger, son of King Dza/Indrabhiiti II.181 The basis of this identification is a statement made by Kam· bala himself in his own commentary on the Sri-sahaja·siddht' of I)ombi Heruka.182 Another lineage that places Lwa wa pa in the eighth century is the rDzogs chen anuyoga lineage, which makes"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Mahiisiddha Kambala (Lwawapa) 185 him a Guru-bhai of a Kukkuripa, and Indrabhiiti's disciple.

Liiipa and the brahmin journeyed seven days to reach J ayantipur, a country with a Buddhist king,, and there they went straight to a brothel, where Liiipa asked for an audience with the chief courtesan. \"Is your mistress interested in buying a male slave?\" he asked the door-keeper. \"I will buy!\" came a voice from within. \"What is your price?\" \"One hundred ounces of gold,\" Liiipa told her.

One day when his work was finished, the courtesan forgot to send him his evening meal. He went out into the garden, where it was his custom to retire, but later his mistress remembered him and sent out servants with food, and to their amazement they found him served by fifteen girls, his body radiating light. When the courtesan was informed she was ashamed that she had not recognized her slave's holiness. \"I have done wrong in treating you as a slave for twelve years,\" she said con-tritely. \"Now let me serve you as my priest.\" J;:>eilgipa refused her offer, but taught the Buddha's message to her and to the people of Jayantipur.

Sadhana J;>engipa's song of realization introduces images that could be dream omens, analogies of four states of mind, or metaphors. A horse is wild and free; an elephant is all-powerful and immovable; and the ocean is all-embracing: the ecstasies of release create a mind that manifests in uninhibited freedom, that cannot be altered by ex-ternal pressures, and that embraces every situation. A monkey steals what it wants; a child's innocence is without discrimination; and writing in water vanishes as soon as it is written: a realized mind is like a wish-fulfilling gem; perceiving the one taste in all things there is no virtue or vice; and whatever arises as thought dissolves without trace. A river is a symbol of eternal change; the sun is its own light source; medicine cures disease: in a mind where the knower and known are one there is only the here and now of an instant of the river's flow; all appearances are self-illuminating; and the disease of attachment is cured by equanimity. A hair-knot is the yogin's sym-bol of unbroken samaya; a single eye is the third eye of non-dual awareness; and a wheel is a symbol of eternity: the goal attained is symbolized by the hair-knot; the realized yogin has attained the divine eye; and he lives according to the eight-fold path (an eight-spoked wheel) in a timeless continuum. I;>engipa's obstacles to liberation were very similar to those of his Guru Ltiipa. Ltiipa ate fish-guts to find the one taste of all things and to eradicate a seed of royal pride and racial discrimination; I;>engipa served a prostitute, and although a courtesan had a certain status in society, to a brahmin, \"a high-minded vedic priest,\" she was \"unclean.\" The situation served to destroy his prejudices and allowed him to discover the sameness in all phenomena. Another virtue of the situation for him was that he could \"ignore other peo-ple's work\" and retreat into an introspective state of absorption in his samadhi. The only obscurity in his verses describing his sadhana is the allusion to the grains of rice as the sun and moon: the pestle, the long heavy stick that husks the rice in a mortar trough, is likened to the avadhutt', the central channel, into which the left and right channels, the rasana and lalana, the moon and the sun, are forced to empty.

Pure pleasure (mahiisukha) is the feeling-tone inherent in all experience. Hz'storiography I;>engipa figures prominently in the early SaiJlvara lineage that was initiated by his Guru Luipa. The lineage Luipa, Darikapa and I;>etigipa, and GhaQ.tapa, comprises a series of anecdotes repeated in various forms by several commentators. Bu ston relates how Luipa went to the city of Kumarak~etra in Orissa to convert King Vimalacandra, and assuming the throne at a ceremony at which the king was to preside, shaming the guards and the brahmins sent to remove him, he commanded the king's attention, and by outrageous behavior and verbal gamesmanship converted the worldly king and his brahmin minister. I;>etigipa received his name when Luipa was inquiring of his converts about their preoccupations, and the brahmin revealed that his mind was fascinated by the sound ¢eng, which seems to be the sound of a hammer on an anvil. The disciples' first meditation was to discover the reality of this sound, and in its lack of any substantial existence and its dependence upon a number of interdependent causes the Guru demonstrated the nature of Mahamudra. Then I;>engipa was sent to a liquor-seller in the city to dispense liquor, to serve unclean food, to wipe up vomit, and generally to demean himself, and by discovering the one taste of all things to attain siddhi. Eventually he attained the I;>akini's Paradise with five hundred barmaids.186 The Sakya version of this story reverses the identity of Darikapa and I;>etigipa. The king is sent to Tsaritrapa in Orissa to hire himself out as a rice thresher, after admitting his chief pleasure was alcohol. In his rice threshing samadhi he visualized his work as a creative and fulfillment yoga, until he gained siddhi in a body of light.

From the mahayana standpoint, technically, an arhat187 is he who observes impeccable manners, restraining himself from any reaction when reviled, angered, beaten or irritated, possessing few desires, practicing scrupulous modest behavior, eating moderately, and keeping from sleep in the first and last parts of the night. He has meditated upon all phenomena as essentially free of both positive and negative at-tributes, and as impermanent, sign-less, wish-less, and empty, then analyzing them into the five psycho-physical constituents, the five elements and the five sense-fields; and he has pondered the four no-ble truths in every way possible. To neutralize the three poisons he has contemplated their antidotes, such as the ugly and repulsive as the antidote to desire. He practices the thirty-seven topics conducive to enlightenment, and contemplates the twelve-fold chain of in-terdependent origination. He has achieved deliverance from the three realms of sa:tp.sara, his nirva:pa is extinction and he will never return to the round of rebirth. If he is a theraviidz'n he will attempt to refute the mahayana path and he stolidly maintains that the Bud-dha was merely a human being.188 Hinayana was the dominant form of Buddhism in India for about a thousand years.

It would appear that the usual Tibetan practice, the vajrayana ideal of three yiinas in one, was not given much credence in siddha-Bengal. This doctrine taught that the tantrika should practice the hinayana externally, following the strict moral and personal discipline of the bhz~u; internally he should cultivate the mahayana attitude of compassion; and in secret he should prac-tice tantric meditation. Amongst the siddhas Santipa, Dharmapa, and this Bhandepa, may have followed this system, but Viriipa, for example, is notable for his renunciation of the robe, and both Aryadeva and Nagarjuna probably wore yogin's dress in their later incarnations. The four boundless states of mind, or the four stations of purity, taught by Sakyamuni in his discourses, take a central place in all Buddhist sadhana, including Tantra. In Bhandepa's song they are given a mahayana interpretation; he does not negate the outer, social virtues, but points at the deeper functions that provoke them. Thus compassion can degenerate into worthless pity, unless it is in-spired by an insight that involves empathy; sympathetic joy can become the forced mark of the do-gooder, unless there is an underlying delight in all perceptual situations; while equanimity can become the flat response of an anesthetized mind, 189 rather than awareness of the all-embracing emptiness that is the common denominator of all experience. Thus to reconstruct Bhandepa's practice: through contemplation of all things as emptiness, and realization of an insubstantial vision, he attained compassion; through constant meditation upon that vision with its inherent pleasure, he attained sympathetic joy; through the resulting activity of treating all beings like his own sons, with a detachment arising from meditation on emptiness, he attained loving kindness; and perceiving all things as a union of space and awareness, knowing the one taste, he attained his goal of perfect equanimity.

In order for such a practice to be effective, so that the practice is not immediately strangled by distractions and mundane preoccupations, the practitioner must have a very strong intuition of emptiness to start with. In other words his Guru must have given him an intense, durable vision of ultimate reality in his initiation. No doubt his contrition laid an ex-cellent foundation, and his trust expedited the empowerment; but such a simple meditation is the most difficult to perform because there are no aids to keep the attention fixed. It is the barest form of Mahamudrii meditation.

He would leave her behind in the cave while he went out begging. After twelve years of continuous practice of mantra he attained magical power-prescience and divine insight-and the gods of the Thirty-three Sensual Heavens invited him to their paradise. He ac-cepted their invitation, and set out on a ceaseless round of self-indulgent feasting and pleasure provided by the gods. Meanwhile the dog fended for herself in the cave, rooting around for whatever she could find to sustain life. But she was not forgotten. Even while the yogin feasted on the gods' offerings, he told them of his dog, saying that he must return to guard her. \"How can you think about a dog in a dank cave while you are en-joying this kind ofluxury and comfort. Don't be so foolish! Please re-main with us here.\" This kind of divine remark persuaded the yogin to postpone his return, but eventually his love for the dog won, and he returned to her."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"200 Masters of Mahamudra He found her in the cave where he had left her, and he patted her on the head in greeting.

Sadhana To perceive the full significance of Kukkuripa's association with his dog, it is necessary to remember that in India the dog is con-sidered an extremely lowly form of life, unclean to the extent that a brahmin will not touch one, and Kukkuripa was born a brahmin. In Taranatha's narrative of Kukkuripa's story193 the dog is a metaphor, and also in our legend there is some ambiguity. The dog signifies a very low caste woman, like a J;>ombi or Savari, the emanation of a J;>akini who could give Kukkuripa initiation through the sexual sym· bolism of two-in-one union (yuganaddha). In this context ... sexual union\" indicates spiritual integration of skillful means, which Kuk-kuripa had cultivated by mantra in his practice of the lower tantras, with emptiness and awareness, which in his case seems to have been underdeveloped-the feminine aspect of his being was externalized as a dog. Whether projecting his \"anima\" upon a dog or woman, the yogin's practice is to achieve spiritual symbiosis by integrating his feminine principle, his awareness of emptiness, with his masculine principle of compassion, and with it to attain supreme success (parama-sz'ddhz)."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"!I il } 'f r-' i ' ) ( 0 Mahiisiddha K ukkuripa 201 0 Kukkuripa returns to saipsara for the sake of all beings."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"202 Masters of Mahamudra Kukkuripa's song expresses one of the revolutionary concepts that set the siddhas apart and made them anathema in the eyes of the brahmins and even certain orthodox mahayana Buddhists: \"Ritual worship is futile, concealing the truth.\" Since vedic times the brahmins have taught that proper performance of their rites leads to salvation, and to certain fulfillment of the ritualist's temporal aims. Temporizing to satisfy some critics who practice ritual with success, Kukkuripa's stance could be modified to exclude from futility ritual performed, for example, in a state of non-action,19' or as a celebra-tion or a healing technique, for he was referring to the futility of ritual as a means of attaining Mahamudra. But the anti-ritualist principle is vital insofar as it takes sadhana back to human interac-tion, back to existential praxis, and back to the internal search. It was the fortuitous appearance of a J;>akini that induced Kukkuripa's peak experience of the Buddha-nature. Spurning ritual, he attained enlightenment without even a human Guru. Hz'storz'ography Kukkuripa's name is well known in the Tibetan tradition, and the story of him and his dog is often repeated. But there is very little biographical detail concerning him extant. An exception is Marpa The Translator's remarkable portrayal of him in his biography: 195 Naropa sends his disciple Marpa to the mother-tantra master to receive the Mahamiiyii-tantra, which he, Naropa, had given to Kuk-kuripa in exchange for the Guhyasamiija. Kukkuripa lives in a swamp of poisonous water in the South. \"He has a body covered in hair. His face is like a monkey's. His color is unpleasant, and he can transform himself into anything.\" Marpa's trip south was an-guished, but overcoming his fear of death he finally encountered the Guru: \"Under a tree was a human figure covered with the feathers of a bird. His face was tucked into the crook of his arm.\" The Guru was most generous to Marpa and gave him the precepts of the three yogas of illusion besides the Mahamiiyii. These were Naropa's remarks to Marpa after his return: \"Since he has no virtue he lives on an unpeopled island in a lake of poison. As he has the face of a monkey on a human body he has to resort to bitches, for he could find no human consort.\" Taranatha evokes the same feeling about Kukkuripa: \"He taught a thousand J;>akas and J;>akinis during the day in the guise of a dog, and at night he would perform gapacakra"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Mahiisz\"ddha Kukkuripa 203 with them in the cremation ground.\" He attained siddhi by means of the Sri Candraguhyatilaka-tantra (The Moon's Secret Spot).196 Kukkuripa's name appears in at least four contexts in the lineal history of the siddhas. First he appears in the Nyingmapa anuyoga lineage, particularly as transmitter of the Dupaido, a text that he received from Indrabhiiti I and taught to Garab Dorje; this would have been in the eighth century. Then he is identified as the Guru of King Dza of Zahor (8th c.), a disciple of Lilavajra and a Guru of Kambala and Indrabhiiti the Younger (late 9th c.), the guru of Minapa (early lOth c.), and the mother-tantra teacher of Marpa (11th c.). Those who believe that mahasiddhas like Kukkuripa at-tained immortality early in their careers and retained an illusory body of light on earth for hundreds of years, could hardly have a better example of this phenomenon. One source identifies Kuk-kuripa with JiHinagarbha from whom Marpa received the Guhyas(lmiija-tantra. 191 Marpa also refers to Kukkuripa as San-tibhadra. Jiianagarbha lived at Talak~etra in Western India, and most of the contexts in which we find Kukkuripa relate to western India, and to the North-west and OQ.Q.iyaQ.a in particular. Our legend is an exception, making him a brahmin of the Sakya kings' ancient capital where Sakyamuni grew up; Kapilavastu is eight miles from Lumbini, where Sakyamuni was born. Associated in this way with the Buddha, the Dog King is given a universality that elevates him above any of the specific lineal relationships. He is indeed the eternal Buddha of the down-trodden and oppressed. The root of his name is kukkura, which means \"dog;\" Kukkuraja (King of the Dogs), is a common alternative form (also Kutaraja, Kukuripa)."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"35 THE SIDDHA KUCIPA THE GOITRE-NECKED YOGIN Sahaja, the z'nborn absolute, brz'ngs pat'n When the yogt'n reacts exdtedly, Quz'ck and t'rrz'table, Uke an elephant's eye; But relaxed, he enters a subUme trance, Detached and free of desz're.

Imagine it growing larger,\" the Guru told him. Kucipa meditated as he was instructed, and the goitre grew larger than before and his pain increased. When Nagarjuna returned and asked him if he was happy, he was assured that his medicine had worked, so he gave him the fulfillment stage visualization: \"Visualize the whole world gathered into your tumor.\" Kucipa meditated accordingly and the goitre diminished in size and disappeared, and with health came happiness. When his Guru returned, again assured that his medicine was effective, he gave these further precepts. Pleasure and pain come from assertion and negation. Free yourself from these extreme concepts And what z's the dijference between pleasure and pain? Experience the emptiness of every separate situatt'on. The yogin-farmer understood the meaning of these precepts perfectly. He attained the realization of imageless Mahamudra and served the people of Kahari for seven years. He was called Kucipa, The Goitre-Necked Yogin. Finally, with seven hundred disciples, he attained release in the l;>akini's Paradise. Sadhana It was most fortunate for Kucipa that his intuition served him well when Nagarjuna passed by. In desperate straits it is not easy to chose one's own doctor, and a bad choice can result in the healer's abuse of the patient's dependency, while in the worst case a quack can tum neuroses into psychoses. Nagarjuna prescribed visualization techniques in both stages of Kucipa's practice: to visualize the goitre engorging was to focus the form and demonstrate control over it by proving its illusory insubstantial nature; and then in the second part, visualiziJ!g the universe in the goitre was to envisage its emp-tiness (seep. 167). This sadhana thus shows the central importance of the power of positive thinking in tantric technique. Starting with the premise that the ·body and matter are gross forms of \"mind-stuff, \"198 and that the whole universe is mind-created insofar as we only know it through the \"creative\" functions of sense percep-tion, it is an easy step to believing that it can be altered by eliminating conditioned mental functions and by concentrated at-"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"206 Masters of Mahamudra body and mind, and consequently western medicine is slow to apply psychosomatics in both diagnosis and prescription.

The technique called \"employing suffering as the path\"199 takes the first noble truth Sakyamuni taught at Sarnath, suffering itself, as the object of meditation. The creative stage focuses it and the fulfillment stage turns it into emptiness; thus it is the path to its own demise. Kucipa's visualizations illustrate the first line of Nagarjuna's final precept: pleasure and pain come from assertion and negation (no causal relation between pleasure and assertion and pain and negation is implied). One of the great achievements of Nagarjuna the madhyamika philosopher was to produce a logical formula that places the mind outside the extremes of affirmation, denial, both, and neither, the place that Kucipa sees as the extreme of no ex-treme. This place is reached by experientially realizing the elusive, indeterminate nature of every situation (dharma), because the elements of every situation are empty in their own nature.200 Kucipa's meditation achievement is qualified by the word \"im-ageless. \"201 \"Image\" is the word used to describe an object of meditation. Kucipa's meditation on elusive empty space has no im-age, for all specific characteristics of his existential situation dissolve into the continuum of space. \"Imageless Mahamudra\" has another connotation: the successful adept is ignorant of his attainment because his \"self,\" the observer, has vanished.

He set innumerable converts on the path to liberation, and finally at-tained ultimate release in the J;>akini's Paradise in his own body. Siidhana The Buddhist student is urged to cultivate three types of wisdom: the wisdom of learning, the wisdom of critical analysis and meditative wisdom. The first consists of intelligent methods of study such as listening attentively, reading closely, and obeying the teacher. The second, critical analysis, is an intellectual discipline in-volving sifting information received, relating it to the student himself, evaluating, comparing, analyzing form and content; students are encouraged to think for themselves, not accepting the teacher's doctrines blindly except when secret precepts are transmit-ted. The third is application in meditation and in daily life of what has been learnt and analyzed. The principal danger inherent in scholarship lies in the second of these functions, where the intellect can become fascinated by the material, its form, its logical nicety and the power of its content, and where it is easy for the intellect to deceive itself into thinking that analytic understanding is realiza-tion: arrogance results. Further, the intellectual function of dualistic analysis can become a veritable disease of the mind, an in-superable obstacle to gnostic realization. But Dharmapa lacked even analytic insight. He was stuck with fragments of information that he was unable to assimilate, and it appears that he hardly deserved the title of scholar. The Guru's blessing enabled him to see the nature of his mind, and to realize that knowledge was not different from mind-in-itself-a continuum of empty space. Immediately achiev-ing the effect of the third type of wisdom he could teach directly out of experiential realization, guided by extra-sensory perception of his disciples' needs.

In this way he gained the realization that is like the unlimited expanse of the sky.

Finally he attained the l)akini's Paradise in his body with two hundred and fifty disciples.

But to bind the object of meditation, in this case Mahipa's physical strength, to emptiness, or rather to the plenum of infinite space, is a skillful device both self-defeating and self-fulfilling, because the ob-ject of meditation is emptiness and is realized to be so when it dissolves in a meditator's relaxed and attentive mind. The same ap-plies to energies (priitza) and consciousness (citta), where \"energies\" are both breath and subtle psychic forces that energize and control the psycho-organism, and consciousness is the cognitive element in the six sensory processes.

The same result can be achieved with or without a partner, using someone else's body or using one's own body.209 The practice for the celibate yogin is de-scribed in Nalinapa's legend (40), and such use of sexual energy is considered more desirable in the Tibetan tradition. But the well known axiom \"No mahiimudrii without karma-mudrii,\" where the female consort is the karma-mudrii, a.nd the central place that this yoga holds amongst the fulfillment stage topics, indicates its significance. The tradition defines \"the superior consort\" in physical terms, employing the criteria of the Indian science of erotics as ex-plained in texts such as the Kiimasutra: the padminiis the best part-ner. Regarding the yoga itself, psychic channels carry the vital energies that consist of seed-essence; and the essence of the yoga is the skill in controlling the subtle energies. First, energy is sent downward to the sexual center; second, with perfect control, male and female energy is intermingled under the power of retention; third, the elixir of pleasure and emptiness united is raised, like a goose drawing water out of milk, up the central channel; and fourth, it is diffused throughout the psycho-organism by the con-stantly bifurcating \"capillary\" channels. 210 With the withdrawal of \"pleasure and emptiness indivisible\"211 up the central channel, the four levels of joy are experienced at the four main cakras, and by saturation of the body-mind, eternal delight212 is achieved, and ultimately rainbow body is possible. The technical description of the technique should not obscure the sine qua non of a \"spiritual rela-tionship\" between the yogin and his consort.

The samaya he mentions can be interpreted in several ways, all of them equally vital: it may be maintaining the relative vows and commitments of the vajrayana, or of this specific practice; it may be the samaya, the body, speech and mind union, of Guru and J;>akini where Vajrayogini is the J;>akini; or it may be the fully empathetic responsiveness of yogin and yogini in their sex-ual encounter.

Siidhana Nalinapa's instruction of reliance upon one's own body218 is the celibate's practice corresponding to Babhaha's fulfillment yoga with a consort. Most beneficial in a person with strong sexual desire, the essence of the practice is to sublimate lust into fierce un-discriminating awareness that overwhelms or \"burns out\" the func-tions of the relative mind that create a sense of ego, that create the conceptual filter through which we normally perceive sensory stimuJi, and, in a word, that create sarpsara. The monosyllabic, euphonic equivalent of the nature of the navel or gut cakra (nirmiina-cakra) varies according to the tantra. Nalinapa is told to visualize the seed syllable BAM; this could be a corruption of RAM, the euphonic nature of fire.214 In the siddhas' caryiig'it'i and !dohiis the deity arising from this seed-syllable is a yogini -J;>ombi, Cat;u;lali, Nainltma or Prajfia-whose nature is the emptiness of divine passion (mahiiriiga). Thus the fire of the yogini in the gut center blazes up to melt the HAM in the head center, which is the seed syllable of the Five Dhyani Buddhas, representing the five psycho-physical constituents. The HAM \"melts\" and \"drips down\" as the ambrosia of the male principle, the white ambrosia that the yogini is represented as carrying in her skull-cup. With the interfu-sion of the red (female) and white (male), the four levels of joy arise successively, each level associated with a cakra. Joy, in the head center, is described as the highest physical pleasure attainable through the senses. Supreme joy, in the throat cakra, is the pure spiritual joy of supra -sensual, esthetic· pleasure. The joy of the heart cakra, the focal point of the dharmakiiya, and the essential nature of mind, is detached or desire less joy, literally \"freedom from joy\" or \"beyond joy;\" this joy has no object, either sensual or mental, associated with it-it is the joy of emptiness.

During this period a prince of pious disposi· tion was ordained in the mahiisii:lighika order, the largest of the four orders represented at Nalanda. The Abbot was satisfied with the progress of all his three hundred students in their study of the five arts and sciences except the prince. While his fellow monks were studying, the prince kept to his bed, warming his stomach so that he might better digest his morning meal of five measures of rice. The king, informed of the prince's behavior, called him The Idler, Bhusuku, the monk who did nothing but eat, sleep and stroll for the sake of his digestion. Now it was the custom at Nalanda to maintain constant recitation of the scriptures. Each monk would take his turn in the rota, reciting a siitra that he had learned by heart. Bhusuku memorized nothing, so he missed his turn on the rota. This was resented by his fellow monks, and the Abbot warned him that unless he did his duty he would be expelled from the monastery. \"I have broken no vow,\" Bhusuku protested. \"It would be unjust of you to expel me.

The monks awaited for that event, eager for Bhusuku's humiliation, and they spread the word of his impending shame. The night before the prince's turn on the rota came about, the Abbot came to Bhusuku's ceil intent upon giving him some sav· ing advice. \"You have been eating and sleeping while you should have been studying,\" he said. \"You are certainly incapable of reciting a sutra. You will be expelled if you fail, you know,\" the Abbot continued when Bhusuku demurred. \"Tonight you should recite the mantra of Mafijusri, the Bodhisattva of Intellect. Repeat the ARAPACANA mantra throughout the night.\" He gave Bhusuku the secret precepts of Mafijusri's sadhana and the blessing of the mantra, and Bhusuku tied his collar to the ceiling to prevent himself from falling over and falling asleep, and he began to recite the mantra that he had been taught. Towards morning his cell was suddenly filled with light and the Bodhisattva himself ap· peared. \"What is your purpose?\" asked Mafijusri. \"Tomorrow I must recite a sutra and I am invoking Mafijusri to aid me,\" Bhusuku replied. \"Do you not recognize me?\" Mafijusri exclaimed. \"I have no idea who you are,\" Bhusuku replied. \"I am Mafijusri himselfl\" \"Then I beg you to grant me the power and realization of every quality of perfect insight,\" Bhusuku implored. \"Consider it granted,\" the Bodhisattva said. \"Recite your sutra in the morning!\" and he vanished. The next day at the time of Bhusuku's recitation, the king, his court, the people and the pundits gathered together with flower of· ferings and incense to await his arrival, everyone expecting to laugh at his expense. When Bhusuku appeared he requested the monks' canopy, and most confidently he mounted the temple throne. At once he rose, levitating above the cushions, his body glowing and pulsating with light. Those who had come to mock became ap· prehensive. The temple door was closed. \"Shall I recite a traditional sutra or my own composition?\" he asked the king.

The five hundred pundits, King Devapala and all the people were amazed, inspired to great heights of faith. They strewed flowers up to his knees, saying, \"This is not Bhusuku, The Idler, this man is surely a sage.\" And they renamed him Santideva, Divine Peace, for he had reduced their pride. Afterwards, the pundits requested a commentary, which Santideva gave them, but when they entreated him to become their abbot he refused. Offering his robes, his begging bowl and all his sacred artefacts to the altar in the temple, unknown to the Abbot and the monks he left for another country. Slowly he made his way to Dhokiri, a town of some two hundred and fifty thousand households. In Dhokiri he made himself a sword out of a piece of wood and painted it gold, and then presenting himself before the king he asked for a position as swordsman in the palace guard. The king agreed to employ him at the handsome rate of ten tolas of gold per day. Living comfortably on this wage Santideva remained in the palace guard for twelve years, constantly attentive to the ultimate nature of reality. During the great autumn festival of the Great Mother Goddess, Umadevi, he accompanied the guards to the temple as though he too were a devotee. But on one occasion, when the guards were cleaning their swords, one of them noticed that Santideva's weapons appeared to be made of wood, and he reported this to the king. Santideva was called to the throne. \"Show me your sword, guard!\" ordered the king. \"It will do you harm if I unsheathe it,\" Santideva warned. \"Do as I say!\" the king commanded. \"I will take responsibility for whatever happens.\" \"Then please cover one eye,\" Santideva pleaded, finally. When the king and his attendants had done as he asked he unsheathed his sword, an<l its brilliant glare blinded their uncovered eyes, and they fell upon their knees, entreating his forgiveness and mercy.

It you have that kind of power, why do you harm living beings?\" the king asked aggressively. \"I am no butcher,\" replied Santideva. \"I am a healer.\" And open· ing the door of his walled-in cave, animals streamed out into the sunshine, seeming to multiply as they ran, covering the hills and valleys, until finally they vanished into nothing. \"You fortunate peo· pie should realize that all elements of experience are merely dream and illusion,\" he taught them. \"The reality of phenomena can never be established.

He learned the method of propitiating Maiijusri from a kusulu tantrika and attained a vision of the Bodhisattva, who told him not to ascend the throne. Santideva fled to Nalanda where he was ordained by the Abbot Jayadeva (T.rGyal ba'i lha). We have knowledge of two jayadevas: the first was the preceptor of Vitiipa, early ninth cen· tury,216 and the Guru of Atisa in the eleventh century. The former could well have been the tantric siddha an,d caryiipada singer's preceptor. At Nalanda Santideva angered his fellow monks with his slothful exterior manner, and redeemed himself in their eyes by reciting the BodMciiryiivatiira. It was during his recitation of the ninth chapter on the praiiiiipiiramitii, at verse thirty-five-\"neither being nor non-being is true reality\" -that he levitated and dissolved into the sky, only his voice remaining. The ninth chapter is still con-sidered to be the finest exposition of the difficult topic of perfect wisdom. When he left Nalanda three monks followed him and asked for commentaries on his great work. He directed them to a Nalanda storeroom where he had deposited the Sikja-samuccaya and the Siitra-samuccaya, both practical works on the Bodhisattva Path, written on birch bark. Santideva was then elected head of a pii~ar,ujika community, where he perfortned the miracle of feeding all with a single bowl of rice. King Arivisana's kingdom, where he became a palace guard, was probably in Orissa, or south of Orissa in Kaliilga with Triliilga as its capital (Dhokiri is otherwise Dekira, or rOo kiri in the legend). A final revealing anecdote, probably referring to the siddha Siin· tideva, takes him to Sri Parvata where he took the guise of a Bud-dhist sadhu devoted to Ucchii~man (Mahiideva), going naked and living on washing-up water. Here an anti-Buddhist teacher with the name of Sailkaradeva threatened to destroy all Buddhist books and edifices if a Siva ma:pQ.ala that he created out of colored powders in the sky could not be destroyed. Santideva destroyed the ma:pc;lala with a mighty wind that also killed the heretics and created chaos in the land, although he saved the king and queen. This last tale makes a connection between Buddhist and Hindu Tantra at Sri Parvata, Srisailam (see p. 121).

Bhusuku or Rauta(?) says: this is the nature of all things-nothing comes or goes, and there is neither existence nor non-existence in sahaja. \"217 In another song Bhusuku sings: \"I have steered the thunder-boat through the canal of the lotus and cast off all afflic-tions after reaching non-dual Bengal. Today Bhusuku has indeed become a Bengali, for he has taken a CaQ.~ali as his wife.\"218 This song seems to indicate that Bhusuku was originally from outside Bengal; but although there is no reason why the writer of the ethically immaculate Bodht'caryiivatiira should not also write songs about his CaQ.~ali consort, the principle that induced him to write his songs in the vernacular should also have been applied to his popular discourse on the Bodhisattva's path, which was written in Sanskrit. Other lines of Bhusuku that stick in the mind are, \"Dark is the night and the play of the rat begins .... When the rat's activity ceases all fetters are destroyed. \"219 And also, \"On seeing and hearing sahaja all the senses are destroyed, and the mind within revels in solitude. \"220 The early Santideva wrote only the Bodhiciiryavatara and its two commentaries. There is only conjecture as to when he lived. A Singhalese authority gives AD 690-730 precisely, but without evidence;221 other scholars, however, tend to agree with this seventh to eighth century dating. If the source that makes Bhusukupada the disciple of Nagabodhi and the Guru of Sarvabhak~a is correct,222 then it is confirmed that the siddha lived during the first half of the ninth century, contemporary with King Devapala of our legend and the mahasiddha Viriipa. In Tibet, Santideva is also known as K~itigarbha, the name of a disciple of Atisa who accompanied his master to Tibet in 1042. It is of course conceivable that both San-tidevas were given the epithet Bhusuku due to their incorrigible laziness. One Tibetan source explains the epithet as descriptive of one who is only concerned about the four basic functions of ex-istence: eating and drinking, sleeping and defecation and urination. An etymological attempt makes bhu (bhuJ) pleasure and su (svap) sleep, but ku?

Then from the highest level of attainment she commenced teaching latrine-sweepers and other outcastes, finally attaining the J;>akini's Paradise. Indrabhiiti received word from King Jalendra about his sister's behavior, and he was highly impressed by her example. \"While my sister has been attaining Buddhahood I have been leading a compla · cent life of ease and comfort,\" he thought. \"She has fathomed the mystery of existence, and I, too, should strive on that same path. I will relinquish the burden of government, a punishment inflicted by my karma, an unworthy task, and practice a sadhana.\" So Indrabhiiti abdicated in favor of his son and retreated to a small palace, where he practiced his sadhana for twelve years. He gained mahamudrii-sz'ddhz', but no one knew of his accomplishment. One day his son and some courtiers came to visit him, and about to open the door, his son heard a voice from above, \"Do not go in! I am up here!\" Looking up they saw their king enthroned in the sky. Overjoyed as if they had reached the first level of the Bodhisattva's path, they paid homage to him.

Indra is King of the Gods, and bhuti or bodhz' means \"wisdom\" or \"enlightenment;\" thus Indrabhiiti or Indrabodhi is The Enlightened Divine King.

The identification of the various King Indrabhiitis presents the most intractable problem in the history of the siddhas. The two principal early Indrabhiitis are both known as King Dza (or sons of King Dza); the syllable dza (San-skrit ja) has no esoteric significance, and may indeed be a corrup-tion of raja. Indrabhiiti the Great, the first Indrabhiiti, King of O~~iyaQ.a, sometimes called King Dza or the son of King Dza, is called the first tantrika, and he was the initiator of several important tantric lineages. At his birth the hinayana was still dominant in north-west India, and it is quite possible that he was the Indrabhiiti that the scrupulous Chinese recorded in the T'ang Annals as King of O~~iyaQ.a in AD 642, although a later date is more credible. In the legends of the Guhyasamiija-tantra's origin it is related that from the thirteenth floor of his palace King Indrabhiiti watched a strange flight of radiant creatures flying across the sky, and informed that these beings were arhats he invited the five hundred saints to enjoy his hospitality. He asked them for instruction, but was disappointed when he was urged to abandon sensual pleasure. He wanted a way to obtain Buddhahood without renouncing the senses, a way that in· volved women, he insisted. The arhats were disobliging, but he eventually obtained such precepts, instruction on the Guhyasamiija· tantra, the first tantra to be revealed, a father-tantra, from a divine agency, either the Buddha himsel£,224 or VajrapiiQ.i.225 The king converted and emptied O~~iyaQ.a, and then taught the niigas and niiginis; a niigz'ni-yogini taught it to the \"southern king\" Visukalpa,"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Mahasiddha Indrabhiiti 233 who taught it to Saraha, the Great Brahmin of Bangala.

A rain of anuttarayoga-tantra texts fell upon his palace roof and Kukkuripa explained the texts to him. One of the texts, the Karatt{iavyilha, was blown to Tibet, where King Lhathothori found it upon his palace roof.229 This last fiction is one of several that seek to inflate Zahor's importance and associate it with Tibet; the fifth Dalai Lama, reputedly of Zahor royalty, was probably responsible for contriving the relationship of Indrabhiiti II with the Abbot Santarak~ita of Zahor (or Sahor, in Bengal, near VikramaSt:la); with Mandarava, Padmasambhava's consort, whose father was an early eighth century Indrabhuti of Zahor; and thus with Padmasambhava himself, whose adoptive father was an early eighth century Indrabhuti of Oc.lc.liyaJ)a, sometimes confounded with Indrabhuti the Great.230 The eighth century bLon po bka' thang, rediscovered in the 14th century, that makes Santara~ita the grandson of Indrabhuti II, renders the salad even less savory; but the great Longchenpa himself asserts the basic fact that Indrabhiiti II of Zahor received tantric texts and gained realization.m King Indrabhuti III, the Younger, of Oc.lc;liyaJ)a, is Lak~mitikara's brother, the Indrabhuti of our legend, who lived in the late ninth century.

People called him Guru Dread-stare, but he became renowned as Mekopa. He trained many disciples with his profound teaching, and finally expressing his realization he bodily attained the .J)akini's Paradise. Sadhana Expecting to find a rational metaphysical basis for the siddhas' experiences implies misunderstanding of the nature of Tantra. Tan-tra is not a philosophy seeking a logical model of the macro/ micro cosmos; rather it is a pragmatically-gathered assortment of soteriological techniques where the proof of the pudding is in the one taste. Thus the statement that the mind's nature is \"a non-dual space without any substance,\" and that all entities of experience (dharmas) are illusion because no-thing can arise out of nothing, is less a premise and a deduction to be proved experientially than a personal statement about the nature of a mystical experience that cannot be proved or disproved, even if the tantrika could be in-terested in proof. The common and shared experience of yogins meditating upon the nature of their minds is the discovery of emp-tiness as the root, and illusory, insubstantial appearances as the branches. It is only for the few to make this discovery, those kar-mically destined and capable of gazing at the sun without blinking. If the preparation for this experience has not been complete, then naturally enough, when the full force of reality impinges, the yogin can lose his balance slightly. Mekopa was able to teach in the stream of full awareness, but he seems still to have been overwhelmed by the nature of his sense perception, since he wandered about with a crazy gaze, his eyes bulging out of his head, frightening people.

The change has been to improve the course of preparation so that what happened to Mekopa is less likely to happen to the initiates of the Tibetan Kahgyupa sect. Mekopa was thrust immediately to the center of the maQ.c;lala with the precept \"Realize the nature of mind,\" and then, with the instruction against discrimination in an ultimate sense, he was equipped to act. The very similar tradition which has retained these very direct and efficacious precepts in the way that they are expressed here in a Mahamudra context is the Dzokchen or Mahasatidhi school. Again, the instructions from Mekopa's Guru express a fundamental Dzokchen view in similar ter-minology: unconditioned space is the nature of all things, but the mind is capable of imposing an ignorant dualistic structure upon this inchoate space, or alternatively, of dissolving itself in the attain-ment of gnostic awareness. Although the origin of Mahamudra is not clear, it is most likely that it originated in Oc;lc;liyaQ.a and was transmitted with the mother-tantras by the early siddhas travelling from Oc;lc;liyaJ,la to eastern India, siddhas who would also have had knowledge of Dzokchen.

Likewise, non-violence (aht'-qt~a), one of the basics of Sakyamuni's teaching, is meaningless unless it is a spontaneous expression of a joyful mind arising out of non-referential awareness. There is no virtue in prac-ticing any meditation that does not work, and if meditation causes suffering instead of curing it, give it up, says Siintipa. The repeated statement that pleasure and pain, virtue and vice, all arise from the mind, implies that virtue and pleasure are also a part of the ignorance and delusion of satp.siira. Virtue must be ac-companied by insight, otherwise it is little different from vice. Vir-tue and insight are the two wings of the Garfi.Qa, which lives in space and is an insubstantial illusion-a mythical Buddha-bird. Siintipa also stresses the importance of the Guru by indicating that Ko~iilipa's misguided practice has led to his debilitation, and proved to be worse than no dharma at all. A Guru who has mastered skillful means-diagnosis and prescription-was Kotiili's great need, and also, as Indrabhuti said, no matter how conscientiously the yogin practices external or internal techniques, without the Guru's bless-ing nothing is gained. We assume that Santipa showed his disciple. the nature of his own mind (no formal initiation is mentioned), and thereafter he is able to practice the creative mode as the work of dig-ging the fields, using the six perverse karmas as friendly helpers, and the fulfillment mode as absorption in the nature of mind.

But no amount of breathing will \"ignite the coals\" until the transfer of grace at initiation has induced recognition of the nature of mind and brought pure awareness into consciousness. However, once lustful and acrimonious thought is burnt up in that flame, passion becomes' malleable, and the blacksmith watches the iron soften before he beats it on the anvil. The three poisons are desire, aversion and ignorance, and the five passions are lust, hatred, pride, envy and sloth. Clearly there is sympathetic magic operative in these meditations, where the meditative process can be watched and experienced in an external analogy. Actually seet'ng thought go up in smoke, as the lalanii and rasanii empty into the avadhiitt', can empty the mind of all distracting thought and concepts, besides providing an effective object of concentration. Likewise, physically beating the passion out of iron, after its reinforcing thought has been eliminated and one step towards detachment has been achieved, the sublimated energy of passion is used to destroy itself. If visualization is considered to be a high form of sympathetic magic, then the entire creative stage could be given that label; and insofar as man is only what he thinks he is, our every day reality can be defined by the anthropologist's \"sympathetic magic.\" Only the Buddha is free from such magic; the process of transforming illusion would be better described as divine magic.

Sadhana Repetition of a precept does not necessarily clarify it, as Jalan-dhara's instruction proves. The basic idea of emptying the psycho-organism of its concepts and preconceptions of the universe is evi-dent, but the details of the meditation are omitted. Three successive sets of three concepts are given: the three realms, the three gates, and the three psychic channels. These three planes are increasingly subtle forms of what must be purified, and a quantitative transfor-mation of \"mindstuff' occurs from one level to the next. In reverse, evolution from one plane to the next describes the process of manifestation of our delusory universe. The first stage clarifies the mind and sets the world in harmony as all experience is analyzed ac-cording to the three realms: the sensual, esthetic and formless realms-all entities of experience can be subsumed under these three heads. Phenomena and noumena having been classified accordingly, the universe is seen as an extension of the psycho-organism as body, speech and mind. \"Body\" indicates the plane of visual appearances; \"speech\" the plane of sound, vibration, vision . and pure form; and \"mind\" indicates thought and degrees and modes of consciousness. Body, speech and mind also compose the entire universe.

Jalandhara is one of the nine original niiths, five of whom are counted amongst the eighty-four siddhas: Kal)ha, Mina, Gorak~a. Caurangi andjalandhara (Hagipa). He is one of the twelve apostles of the kiipiilikas' founders, and he is one of the nine niith incarna-tions of the nine nariiyii?tas. 244 In the niith lineage he is guru-bhai of Matsyendra, and disciple of Adi-nath, and he founded one of the two major niith lineages including the Pha and Aughari sects. His principal disciples are Kr~l)acarya, Gopidii)Q and Bhatrhari (Bairaga or Bhatrnath). In the earliest niith texts, like the Gorakh-bodh,245 Jalandhara and the other Buddhist siddhas can be discerned as the personalities of Buddhist legends, but in the later oral tradition they become practitioners of ha.thayoga intent upon mundane siddhi, and their stories are full of magical display.

But whereas the same term, mahiijfiiina, is used by both Buddhists and faivas, in Mahamudra it means pure awareness of space while in the niiths' stories it has been debased to mean the faculty of divining solutions to practical and spiritual problems. This anecdote247 illustrates another distinction between the Buddhist and faiva traditions: in-itially the Five Naths practiced ascetic yoga successfully, but after Adi-nath, Siva, had taken Gauri as his consort, and Gauri had failed to persuade Siva that the life of a married householder tantrika was the superior mode, she stooped to low levels of seduction to prove to her Lord that his disciples were still capable of lust.

He took his name, Ha4ipa, from hii{ii, \"sweeper,\" in this story; or, at the time of the creation of the world when each of the Five Naths was born out of a part of the Primal Lord's body, Ha4ipa was born from the Lord's bone (hiifl,a).

Riihu belongs to the tantric trinity of sun, moon and riihu, which are directly analogous to the lalanii, rasanii and avadhiltt'. Thus riihu as the dragon planet that eclipses sun and moon symbolizes the union of sun and moon. The creative energy of pure awareness dissolves the polarized, karmic energies of sun and moon;251 non-dual awareness eclipses the dualistic constructs of mind.

It may be melted by the fire of the yogini in the gut center, or it may be activated by ku'(l-(ialini rising from the sexual cakra, or by the white seed syllable OM. One way to understand the release of the flow of nectar is to conceive of the moon as fixed ideas and preconceptions, constructs and con-cepts, dissolving and flowing down into the psycho-organism. The nectar is pleasure and emptiness coincident, the nature of ex-perience in the head cakra after the dissolution of mental rubbish. As the nectar floods the body four hostile powers are destroyed. These powers are functions of karmic, genetic, racial and cultural conditioning. The first is the psycho-physical aggregate-form, sen-sation, perception, motivation and consciousness; these five psychosomatic components define the ego's \"island.\" The second of these powers is passion-desire, hatred, pride, envy and sloth; it is an unreliable but powerful ally to the tantrika. The third is death, which implies constant fear of cessation. The fourth is cupidity, the basic desire for sensual and sexual satisfaction that cannot be assuaged. These four are conceived as devils: the first two bedevil thought, and the other two are \"non-human devils\" or \"spirits\" -fear and lust are instinctual impulses outside, or basic to, the normal neurotic confusion of the mind. 252 When these four hostile powers have been destroyed the qualities of the Buddhas spontaneously arise.

The first Buddhist Rahula was Sakyamuni's son, a monk, who was born at the time of an eclipse. The great mahayana Rahulabhadra was also called the Great BrahmaQ.a Saraha, who taught the first Nagar-juna, and to whom that Second Buddha may have been indebted for the principles of his madhyamz'ka philosophy and the ethos of his en-tire vision. This Rahula wrote one great piece of philosophical verse, Praise to The Goddess of Wisdom (Prajiiiipiiramitii-stotra), which alone brought him immortality.2113 He was alive in AD 119 during the reign of Kani~ka II.254 Another Rahulabhadra has been ideil· tified with the mahasiddha Saraha; he ordained the siddha Nagar-juna while he was Abbot of Nalanda. But Saraha himself had a preceptor called Rahulabhadra. During the same period Buddha-srijiiana, the founder of a Guhyasamaja lineage, had a k~etriya pm;u;lita Rahulabhadra as disciple;265 and Aryadeva had a sudra disciple of the same name whom he taught at Nalanda, and who later received his blessing as the lineage holder. 256 Finally, the last abbot of Nalanda was called Rahulasribhadra. The Tibetan monk Dharmaswamin found him hiding from Turkish soldiers in the ruins of the monastery in the thirteenth century. Rahu (T.sGra-gcan) was an asura (anti-god) who disguised himself as a god and joined the line of gods waiting to receive a por-tion of nectar (amrta) after the great churning of the ocean. The Sun and Moon revealed the fraud to Vi~:pu who cut off the demon's head; but immortal he lives in the sky, intermittently wreaking vengeance on the sun and moon by swallowing them. He is a dragon's head, the ascending node of the moon, the eighth planet, an important luminary in the demonic sky. Rahula (T.sGra-gcan 'dzin) js the destroyer of Rahu; it is an appellation of Buddhist monks. Rahula's song has Riihu(la)bhadra in the first line, and Rahula in the third; there is no evident explanation for the discrepancy. Kamariipa, where our Rahula was born, is one of the four great l)akini pithasthiinas, and an ancient center of siikta worship, located in Assam near Gauhati. It is said to be the only power-place in India where the original Buddhist tantric rites are still performed.

Liiipa met his embodied I;>akini while begging at a brothel, and she taught him with a symbolic act; Jalandhara's Awareness I;>akini appeared as a result of involuntary contemplation. Dharmapa's I;>akini came to him in a dream due to his deeply felt need for a Guru. Perhaps the Awareness I;>akini can be conceived as a female archetype, a selfless anima, arising out of Jung's collective unconscious. In the case of Dharmapa's dream, since dream belongs to the plane of visionary enjoyment where vibration takes instructive form, the I;>akini is a satp,bhogakiiya emanation, the principle of perfect insight into emptiness in an-thropomorphic form. Although the pat~{lita had spent his life engaged in intellectual pursuits, he had accumulated sufficient kar-· mic impetus in the direction of perfect insight for that ideal to ap-pear to him as the I;>akini when he needed her and when he prayed to her. He had also achieved a sufficiently responsive mind so that when he named the object of his desire and visualized her, his prayer was answered. The mind in its deluded state is always a wish-fulfilling gem in potential, otherwise prayer would never work. The yeshe-norbu (cintiimattt) is a state of being that always and im-mediately responds to a conceptual wish, or prayer, by manifesting that actuality (see p. 89).

In either case the principle is the same: absorption in the emptiness of either gross material or subtle mental, poison, using sound as the medium, transforms the poison into mind's nature. According to some, the specific resonance of combinations of vowels and con· sonants has an effect independent of the samadhi of the yogin or healer who recites the mantra. In theory this hypothesis is valid; in practice it is unproven. There is an important discrepancy between the Guru's meditation instruction and Dharmapa's song of realization. In the first case the \"oil\" is conceptualization and mental constructs, and in the second it is responsive sensibility. 257 Thought is the raw material for the novice; thought is the path; thought is the object of concentration; thought is what must be penetrated by insight and transformed into empty awareness.258 After mental constructs dissolve, the concep· tual wish to obtain Buddhahood becomes the responsive sensibility that reacts to fulfill the Bodhisattva Vow. Thus the \"oil\" is whatever arises to do, say or think for the sake of others. Virtually every sid· dha spent years, sometimes decades, using selfless service as the oil to keep his butter-lamp lit. The siddhas who performed this kind of meditation never abandoned their sensual pleasure while practicing their sadhanas or performing their selfless service; the other con-stant, besides the oil, is the wick, which is the six sense-fields, or in full, \"cognition of the six sets of three elements of percep· tion-stimulus, sense organ and consciousness. \"259 Hzstorz\"ography If indeed an error lies behind the inclusion of two siddhas of the same name, Dharmapa, there is no way to discover when it was made, although it certainly came before the various texts of the legends now available were put into their final form.

Siidhana Pankajapa's story is one of the several legends that illustrate the non-sectarian ethos that characterized the siddhas' praxis. Although the Tibetans' traditional antagonism towards the brahmins, and their brahmanic philosophy, has no doubt slipped in to color some of the legends in anti-brahmin shades, that does not explain away the mutual antipathy of brahmin and Buddhist implicit in Viriipa's encounter with the King of Indra (p. 46) or the feeling of vast superiority that the Buddhists felt for. the ancient devi cults whose ~iikz'nf-witches harassed Viriipa, Kambala, Kn:vacarya and others. But generally it is reasonable to assume that within the tantrika community Buddhists and saz'vas lived in non-sectarian harmony, sharing each other's shrines, symbols, lineages and also teachers A valokitesvara and Mahadeva are still . worshiped as om. god-Triloknath, Lord of the Three Worlds-in Nepal. Mahadeva, Siva, is not then The Destroyer, but the Great God in whom birth, life and death combine, and Avalokitesvara is not just the Bodhisat-tva of Compassion but the beginning and end of creation as he is depicted in the Karap,~avyiiha-sutra. Just as Buddhist and saz'va Tantra still co-exist in Nepal with mutual respect and with no disparity in the minds of the secular, Newari devotees, so it must have been in the era of the siddhas in India.

As an alternative to the debasement that accom-panied the kiipiiUka's undiscriminating activity, Nagarjuna's precepts make compassion the liberating factor. Compassion, an undiscriminating empathetic feeling of love and a sensitive respon-siveness to the needs of all beings, must be united with the activity that leads to sensual fulfillment, and the emptiness of our original indeterminate nature perceived in compassionate vision is then perceived in every action whatsoever. In other words, do whatever you will, provided that you are responding with love and see the emptiness in it. Pankajapa's seven day sadhana, something of a record in the legends, had as path and goal the unity of compas-sionate vision and sensual activity. The legend implies that it was merely the recognition of the deity as the Bodhisattva of Compassion that made all the difference to Pankajapa; it could also be inferred that he had been practicing undiscriminating sensual saiva Tantra, and that could be the significance of his name.

We could replace his lamp with the sparkle of jewels and offer him every pleasure that the kingdom can afford.\" The king agreed to his wife's proposal, and the following morning he sent his servant to invite Gha~tapa, for it was none other than he, to the palace. But the master declined the invitation, and the ser-vant returned alone. The next day the king himself, with a great retinue, went to the master's tree. He prostrated before Gha~tapa and then submitted many reasons why the saint should accompany him to the palace. \"You should not have bothered to come here,\" Gha~tapa answered. \"With great faith I have come to offer you my charity,\" the king responded. \"Your kingdom is full of vice,\" Gha~tapa told him. \"I shall not come.\" \"Please stay with us for just one year,\" the king insisted.

On the appointed day the king gathered the people of Pataliputra and set out to visit Gha:r;ttapa. The master consulted his wife on the appropriate course of action. \"Should we stay here or go to another country?\" he asked her. The girl wanted to go elsewhere, as she was afraid of the people's scorn and abuse. So Ghavtapa hid their child in his robe, took a pitcher of liquor under his arm and set out with his wife. On the road they met the king on his elephant. \"What is that under your robe?\" demanded the king balefully. \"And who is this girl?\" \"I am carrying a jug of liquor, there is a child under my robe, and this is my consort,\" replied Gha:r;ttapa, looking the king in the eye. \"When I invited you to my palace you refused to come,\" said the king. \"You told me that I was a sinful man.

They called the master Ghavtapa, Holder of the Bell, and his fame reached the corners of the earth. In six previous incarnations the girl had caused the monk to break his vow, but in this lifetime all the monk's dualistic mental con-structs dissolved in the infinite expanse of emptiness inherent in all things, and by virtue of a fully developed mindstream he gained the true path.

In the Orissan jungle he offended the king by refusing to accompany him to the city, his Mahamudra practice being his justification. The whore's daughter sent to seduce him was the ele-ment lacking in his sadhana and he initiated her and took her as his J;>akini. Although the king intended to ridicule the yogin, it was Gha:Q.~apa who himself went to the city to convert the people. He emanated a boy and girl, took a ladle himself to take liquor from his consort's pot to give to the children who filled the pitchers of every family in town. Finally, he threw the ladle on the ground, water gushed forth, the boy and girl became thunderbolt and bell, and the master and his consort became Sarp.vara and consort in union. Thereby Orissa was established in the vajrayana. Our legend has as its dominant theme the stupidity of the sort of self-righteous mind that insists upon its own limited moral virtue and condemns others for practicing a life-style that transcends moral discipline. The J;>akini-girl had seduced Gha:p.tapa in previous lives, but each time, as a monk, he had been bound by the moral imperative. In this lifetime his mind was sufficiently mature to ac-cept the J;>akini's teaching and to attain liberation after progressing through the four stages of joy. Thereafter his purity was sealed in Mahamudra, but the king, who failed to understand that \"the soul of sweet delight can never be defiled,\" rejected Gha:p.~apa's claim of faultlessness. The kind of self-righteous mind that condemns a man and woman for \"living in sin\" cannot accept the possibility of a dominant streak of purity in all other people. If our legend had made it clear that Mahamudra meditation prevented Gha:Q.tiipa from accepting the king's invitation, it would appear less like karmic retribution when the king tried to humiliate him. In his teaching to the king and people, Gha:p.~apa taught them what he had learnt: \"Do not cultivate virtue and renounce vice, but accepting everything as it arises, penetrate the essence of the experience to obtain the one taste.\" After the vision that he had shown them, perhaps they were ready for such instruction; but he had failed to understand it in his six previous lives, and the two sets of moral standards that he demonstrated first as a monk and then as a yogin showed two separate and valid paths.

Celuka was born of low caste in Mangalapur. He was forever listless, idle and overpowered by lethargy. Oppressed by the nightmare of samsaric existence, he was sitting beneath a tree one day when the yogin Maitripa passed by and asked him what he was doing. \"I am thinking how I could obtain a sadhana so that I can escape from this abject condition,\" he replied. \"My problem is that I have met no master who could teach me an appropriate method. I am so lazy that I could not even begin to search for a teacher. Can you teach me how to overcome inertia?\" \"If you take initiation you will sleep less and eventually gain release from sa1p.sara,\" Maitripa told him.

By keeping your psychic energies in the avadhuti you will overcome fatigue in a state of thoughtlessness and mental quiescence.\" Celuka meditated like this for nine years, and dispelling the defilements of his mind he attained mahiimudrii-siddhi.

Siidhana One of the immediate and self-evident effects of release from satp.sara, an effect that can be sampled in even a short course of meditation, is a rise in the energy level of the psycho-organism. Lethargy is swept away and diligence and perseverance need no longer be wilfully and conscientiously applied. The yogin becomes capable of superhuman tasks, calling upon an unending supply of energy; in retreat he can sustain months of practice without sleep. Technically this effect is described as \"uniting the lalanii and rasanii in the avadhiiti,\" or uniting the objective and subjective poles of mentality. When this union has been achieved, an introspective mind is thrown out into the sensual realm wherein the deeper layers of being are experienced in ordinary sensual perception. The avadhiiti (the central channel) is then the etherialized psycho-organism (see Celuka's song) and its phenomenal awareness, and it is likened to a placid lake; in mental terms the avadhuti is a thoughtless state of mental quiescence,282 and the stream of awareness of sensual perception of the empty space of \"material,\" or rather \"immaterial,\" phenomena is likened to a swan floating calm-ly upon the lake. This vision of reality as a swan on a lake became a constant mode of being and perception for Celuka; there was no dif-ference between his life and his practice. The adjective descriptive of this level of fulfillment meditation, \"profound,\" is a translation of the Tibetan word literally rendered as \"superficial\" or \"elementary.\" It would appear that the Tibetan translator rendered the Sanskrit word too literally.288 Such is an ex-ample of the fallacy of linguistic translation.

Further, it is tempting to identify Indrabhiiti's land of Sambhola ( 42) a near homophone of Sambhala, with the origin of the Kalacakra tradition.

Siidhana Godhuripa's practice of uniting birdsong with its mental image is identical in principle to Vi:papa's practice (11) of uniting the image of the notes struck on the vi?til with the actual sounds themselves. Vi:papa's instruction to listen to the unstruck sound translates in Godhuripa's meditation as visualization of the sound and its hearer as an undifferentiated field of emptiness, 287 which is what occurs when subject and object are united in a gnostic experience of reality. The first part is creative meditation and the second part is fulfill-ment meditation. First the auditory sense-field is purified by ridding it of preconceived images of sounds; residual echoes of sound, like visual images and ideas, are stored to be projected upon similar forms that arise in perception. It was the memory of the koil's song (koi'l or kokt'lii, the nightingale of the cuckoo family, seep. 366) that Godhuripa forgot by absorbing himself totally in the bird's song. Gaining a direct perception of sound, the sound of silence was heard in every sound. Discovering the one taste, it was an easy step for Godhuripa to universalize that insight and visualize it in every entity of experience, and visualization is the preliminary step to recogni· tion of what is there in reality. In his song of realization Godhuripa explains it differently. Tak-ing external objects and their internal counterparts as equally unreal entities, he detaches himself from them by conceiving them as projections of mind's nature, and then realizes the nature of both inner and outer phenomena as light.

The hearts of men are surely hardened to fear for they feel quite at ease while traveling along the road to the next life. Turn back the chariot! This is no time or place for pleasure excursions! How could an intelligent per-son pay no heed at a time of disaster, when he knows of his impend-ing destruction?\"293 For some, like Lucika, this is the only possible reaction to the fact of death, and the principal function of all sadhana has been called \"preparation for death motivated by the fear of death.\" Certainly if death is understood as a metaphor for life, all tantric sadhana can be described in that way. In his verse of realization, indirectly Lucika gives two important indicators about Tantra. First he indicates the unstated mahiintrvap,a, where both sa:rp.sara and nirviiJ).a are states of mind, sa:rp.slira the state where desire is rife, and nirvaJ).a the hinayana goal of cessation of desire. Satp.siira and nirvaJ).a are not different because they are both states of pure pleasure and emptiness indivisible. Secondly, he implies that in Tantra the Buddha's being with its feel-ing tone of pure pleasure, experienced in initiation and at peak ex-perience of meditation, should be assumed to exist even though it is temporarily occluded by the veils of emotional or conceptual ig-norance. Only by visualizing and assuming the highest is the highest made possible. Accepting any lesser state as \"reality,\" condemns the yogin to that lower level of achievement.

The terms he uses are all words representing aspects of the unitary gnostic experience: \"in-nate, spontaneously arising, pure awareness\"298 describes the ex-perience as awareness alone, awareness graphically represented as a I;>akini performing an endless dance, passing effortlessly from one mudrii to another. \"Pure pleasure\"299 is not only the feeling tone of the experience but the content of it-the paradise of Sukhavati is an extension of a mind that is nothing but pure pleasure. \"The natural-ly radiant nature of being\"500 is not only the inherent nature of all being, but also its manifestation; what is clear light in its nature, cannot be anything but clear light in its manifestation. At the center of offering rites, and also the gar-acakra-puja, sacrificial cakes are tasted by the participants to attain transfigura· tion in a process very similar to the Christian eucharistic sacrament; the cakes are then thrown out for the benefit of lower life forms-dogs, birds, pretas and spirits of various kinds. These tor-mas are composed of numerous symbolic ingredients, the basis be-ing roasted and ground grain; modelled as yantras, they are con-secrated as the deity itself.

Clothed only in a loincloth, for he was very poor, he would take chapatis from a businessman and hawk them in the streets. In this way he could make a small profit and support himself. One day after he had been unable to sell any of his wares, bitten by hunger, he began to eat a chapati, but before he had eaten half of it a monk, who was an emanation of Avalokitesvara, ap· peared in front ofhim. Pacaripa's faith was aroused by this appari· tion, and after prostrating before the monk he offered him the re-maining half of his chapati. Then responding honestly to the monk's enquiry, Pacaripa told him to whom the bread belonged. \"Then we are priest and patron,\" the monk said. \"I should give you instruction in return.1' Pacaripa prepared a ma~~ala of thanksgiving and offered flowers to the monk.

So he set off for the Potala Mountain where the Bodhisattva lives. On the way he passed through a thick forest of thorns, which pierced his feet and hurt him. He let out a great cry to Avalokitesvara, who appeared to him in his reality. \"I am indeed your Guru,\" the Bodhisattva told him. \"Now give up your intention to go to the Potala and return to Campa to lead your disciples.\" Pacaripa was overjoyed, and floating in the sky he returned to his own country. The people there were overcome with astonishment and begged instruction from him. He taught them the indivisibility of appearances and emptiness. Thereafter he was known as Guru Pacaripa, and finally he rose bodily into the l)akinl's Paradise. Siidhana Pacaripa was a simple man and he received a simple Mahayana sadhana to practice. Refuge in the Triple Gem-the Buddha, Dhar-ma and Sangha: enlightened being, vibration and em-bodiment-formulated liturgically as \"I take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, \"303 recited thrice at the beginning of each and every devotional occasion, is the essence of the Buddhist creed, common to all vehicles, sects and schools. Exegesis upon the Refuge encompasses the whole of the Buddhist doctrine. The Bodhisattva Vow, or more strictly, the aspiration towards an enlightened mind, has been formulated quite differently by various schools. In the basic mahayana form it is a pledge to renounce nirva:J).a and serve others at any cost; in atiyoga it is an assertion of the yogin's essential identity with the Buddha-nature and recognition of the inalienable process of emanation of a compassionate, apparitional sensual level of being.

In his innocence, Pacaripa attempted to reach the Bodhisattva's physical abode, a mythical island mountain in the south-western Indian Ocean, or the Dalai Lama's residence in Lhasa, both named Potala. Previously the Bodhisattva had appeared to him in the guise of a monk; to instruct him to return to his town of Campa, answering his cry of pain, he must have appeared in his visionary form, sa'f!lbhogakiiya.

No longer living in an environment of discrete entities, solid and seemingly immutable, the siddha finds himself in a metamorphosing phantasmagoria of vivid color and form -light-form. Recognition of the emptiness (sunyatii) that is the nature of all things, all-penetrating and all-encompassing, the essence that is inseparable from the manifest apparitional manifestation, transforms the environment into a fairy castle in the sky, a reflection of the moon in water, an hallucination, a visionary world where the siddha can fly through the sky, walk through walls and manipulate the elemental balance. This experience is shared only if people close by are highly susceptible to the vibration, and gain a \"contact high.\" Unbelievers are still trapped in a delusive world of concrete things.

To walk the path of Tantra is to risk falling off into the adamantine hell, the vajra naraka, and safety checks do not exist. Like a tight-rope walker performing without a thought in his head, fully concentrated upon the present moment, the siddha concentrates totally on the ultimate samaya, the absolute specific; acting without inhibition, thoughtlessly and spontaneously he sustains the unity of intuitive knowledge of emptiness and the ap-propriate skillful means. He falls when he forgets his samaya, when objective thought arises, when one selfish thought destroys the union of means and insight. To employ a sexual analogy: this balance is like sustaining a sexual relationship so finely tuned that both part-ners are on the verge of the consummation that is always denied yet constantly experienced in the pure pleasure of expectation and con-tinuous creative peak energy.

After many years, with a vast retinue, he attained the 1;>akini's Paradise. Sadhana Sesame seed ts sometimes used as a metaphor for \"seed-essence,\"808 the empty, sub-atomic building block of ap-pearances, and thus it is the substance of pure awareness; it has the same relation to bodhz'dtta as spermatoza has to seminal fluid. In the context of this legend the crushing of sesame seed is a metaphor for extracting subtle dualistic concepts from the delusion of substan-tial materiality that is sustained by them, or for extracting the con-cepts of name and form that give substance to differentiated entities of reality, in particular the body. Dhilipa is instructed to visualize the oil as these mental constructs that are to be dissolved in mind's empty nature, 809 a process otherwise described as emptying the lalanii and rasanii into the avadhuti; then from the union of ap-pearances and emptiness, the interfusion of lalanii and rasanii, the gnostic flame of pure awareness and knowledge is ignited.

Such is tantric doctrine and such is the experience of siddhas who have gained control over the elements after accomplishing their magnum opus; and the analogy of Dhilipa's instruction demonstrates how it is done. Hz'storz'ography The name Dhilipa (Delipa, Teli, Telopa, Tailopa, Bhalipa) is derived from the Sanskrit taz'la, \"sesame seed oil,\" and Tailopada. Thus it has the same root as Tilopa (22), Naropa's Guru. Taranatha identifies the oil-pressing siddha as Naropa's Guru. Born in Catigharo in the East, educated as a brahmin, attaining renown as a scholar, he became a wandering mendicant. Attracted by the Bud-dha's teaching he was ordained; only to be unfrocked for associating with a mundane :Oakini whose work was extracting oil from sesame seed. Later he moved in with her. Finally he flew up into the sky in union with his consort, still pressing sesame seed.

Sadhana There is an immediate hostile reaction to the statement that all life is suffering, that we are never happy. Happiness, however, must be understood as the Buddha's eternal, pure pleasure (mahiisukha). All our temporal, human joys and pleasures, and the gods' long-lasting but passing ecstacies, are suffering simply because they are temporal and passing. Only Buddhahood deserves effort; ephemeral sensual pleasure is not worth the candle. Although all temporal ex-istence is suffering, since nirviit;1a is found only in sal}lsiira, eternal pure pleasure is to be found within suffering, even if it is only an ephemeral flash. Kumbharipa's instruction is on recognition of thought, 313 thought being defined as all objects of the sixth sense-the mind. Evolution of the conditioned mind is described according to the doctrine of conditioned co-production (pratitya-samutpiida). Ignorance, or the inability to perceive the emptiness of phenomena, is the root of sal}lsara; out of ignorance arises passionate reaction and conflicting dualistic thought, mental chatter interpretive ofother people's ac-tions, for example, all toned by emotion. The six types of mental syndrome, each characterized by a different emotion and thought-pattern, are represented by the six realms of sal}lsiira (the realms of gods, men, antigods, hungry ghosts, beasts and denizens of hell). After his initiation into the nature of thought from his Guru, the potter's practice was to remain attentive to thought, constantly penetrating its form to its empty essence-\"firing the pots in the flame of gnostic awareness.\" Six months of practice indicate one month for each of the six kinds of mental syndrome. Although there is no attempt to avoid the mind's creation, or to change it or eliminate it, as the practice continues the mind empties by itself, or rather it ceases to produce the thought and emotion that is the meat of the meditation, and finally the mind is a Buddhafield.

Shortly after the yogin departed, the mother-in-law returned, and seeing the remains of a meal and little food remaining in the house, she began to berate her. The young wife in her turn became angry, and she fled to Carbaripa's hermitage with her child. \"Well done!\" said the yogin in welcome.

The king had great faith in him and built a temple for him and his parents, and a larger temple for the three hundred smaller images. He became known as Dumapa. This temple became a popular power place for the practice of sadhana, and it is said that when the minds of the yogins meditating there became bedeviled by intractable evil thoughts, they were beaten or otherwise chastised by the images.

The description of the boy's attainment is in the terminology of the niith tradition, although the relation between the st'ddhis and their anatomical places of origin is not clear. Khecari-mudrii, which produces khecari-siddhi, 815 involves turning the tongue up and back into the hollow above the throat (where a channel that brings soma or amrta from the moon at the sahasriiha-cakra on the crown of the head has its exit) and fixing concentration of sight at the space be-tween the eyebrows (where the \"third eye\" has it location in the sub· tle body).816 In this most confused of legends, it is clear that the boy attained the st'ddhis, but it is not clear who is named Dumapa (or Dhu rna pa). If it is not the boy, Dumapa could be Carbaripa who brought the petrified people together under one roof: one edition of The Legends has Du rna pa, The Gatherer. Dhu rna with Dha rna are two disciples of KiiQ.hapa, while Carbaripa is KaQ.hapa's disciple.817 Further, it may have been either Carbaripa or Dumapa who was to await Maitreya before practicing the Bodhisattva Vow. The st'ddht' of \"petrification,\" which allows a Guru to transform a previously worldly person into a yogin sitting as still as a rock for long periods of time, is particularly relevant in the niith tradition where hathayoga demands such practice, but Tibetan Lamas also certainly have this power to \"freeze\" their devotees in meditation. Thus meditation in the Guru's presence is sought after eagerly. One text explains the metaphor by the statement: \"he entered the Buddha's self-existent vajra mode of being. \"318 Hz'storz'ography Siddha number sixty-four is variously called Carbaripa, Javari, Caparipa, Cavaripa, Capalipa, Carpati. If he can be identified with Carpati. his Guru was Jalandhara and his disciples Minapa, Kuk-kuripa, and Khac;lgapa. If Carbaripa was Javari, the only informa· tion we have is that he was a disciple of one of KiiQ.hapa's disciples819 or of KaQ.hapa himself. In the first case he would have lived at the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth century; in the second case he would have lived in the ninth or tenth century. The root of carbaripa is probably carpata, meaning \"ear;\" thus the case for Car-pati being the correct form of the name is strengthened."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"65 THE YOGINI SIDDHA MA~IBHADRA THE HAPPY HOUSEWIFE When my mind was enshrouded in ignorance Crt\"tical thought attended every sound; When realt'ty was revealed as my own nature The nature of whatever appeared was reality itself In the town of Agarce there lived a wealthy householder, who had a thirteen year old daughter. She was betrothed to a man of her own caste, and as was the custom the young woman lived in her parents' house until she was old enough to be her husband's wife. During this period the Guru Kukkuripa came to her house begging food. \"What a fine handsome man you are!\" the girl told him. \"Why do you wear patched robes and beg your food when you could take a wife and live comfortably?\" \"I am terrified of the wheel of rebirth, and I am trying to find the great joy of liberation from it,\" Kukkuripa told her. \"If I do not take this opportunity, in my next life I may not be so lucky.

Thereafter she re-mained in solitude for seven days, establishing herself in the practice of her sadhana. But when she returned home her parents beat her and reviled her. Mat;tibhadra defended herself, \"There is no one in the universe who has not been either father or mother to me,\" she said. \"Besides, a pure blood line and a good family upbringing does not free a girl from the grip of sarpsara. So relying upon a Guru I have decided to practice a sadhana that can bring me liberation.

After a year, when her betrothed came to take her to his own house, she accompanied him without demur. In her new home she performed everything that was expected of her cheerfully and uncomplainingly, always speaking modestly and sweetly, thus con· trolling both her body and speech.

When he asked her what was the matter, she continued to stare, evidently not having heard him.

If you desire happiness, rely on him. So saying, MaQ.ibhadra floated into the sky and taught the people of Agarce for twenty one days. Thereafter she attained the l;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana The moral of MaQ.ibhadra's tale is that a woman can practice a sadhana while performing her duty as a model wife and mother. Throughout their history, the Hindus have never relaxed their view that the woman belongs in the home. Ramacandra's wife Sita, who burned herself rather than suffer the disgrace of even slight suspi-cion that she betrayed her husband, is the Hindu woman's paragon. The third and fourth stages oflife, withdrawal and complete renun-ciation, apply to a woman as much as a man, but until the children are mature a woman is bound by tradition to fulfill domestic roles. Female bhi~u1Jis and tantrikas certainly existed from the time of the Buddha, but in tiny numbers; perhaps the proportion of male siddhas to female siddhas (four) and siddhas' consorts (four) amongst the eighty-four reflects the actual ratio of male to female tantrikas in siddha India (10: 1 ), although in Taranatha's tales of the siddhas there is a higher proportion of yoginis, involved either as teachers or consorts. 320 Anyhow, just as a king can practice his sadhana while sitting on a throne, and craftsmen can attain siddhi while performing their craft, a housewife can attain mahiimudrii-siddhi while doing her daily round. She need not be a sexually pro-miscuous outcaste to attain siddhz'. The metaphor of the broken pot is most apposite. Crushing sesame seed or breaking a pot, the meaning is the same; except that with a broken pot the space inside immediately joins the space out-side, like a river running into the sea-thus MaQ.ibhadra's im-mediate nz'rvz\"kalpa-samiidhi. Fear of the indeterminate nature of being is what induces beings to return to their homes, to sarp.sara, again and again, at death and also when a moment of revelation destroys the sense of finite identity and habitual dualistic modes of perception.

The Guru spoke to them kindly, but he did not recognize them, and asked them who they were. They reminded him of their previous meeting. \"Then you should have brought me offerings,\" the Guru told them. \"What can we give you?\" the sisters asked. \"Give me your heads!\" demanded the Guru. \"We give what the Guru asks,\" they replied. Then with the keen-edged sword of pure awareness, which they drew from their mouths, they severed their own heads and offered them to their Guru. They sang: Through the grace of the Guru's z'nstructz'on, Unz'tz'ng creatz've and fulfz'llment medz'tatz'on, We destroy the dz'stz'nctz'on between satpsiira and nz'rviiva; Vz'sz'on and actz'on unz'ted z'n co-z'ncz'dent harmony We destroy the dz's#nctz'on between acceptance and rejectz'on; In the unz'on of vast space and pure awareness We destroy the dz'stz'nctz'on between self and others.

The Guru's failure to recognize the girls upon their second visit, and his demand that they give him their heads, may have been skillful devices to allow them to prove that their previous self-centered conceit had now vanished, that they understood the unity of all things and, even more significantly, the oneness of all things. The kind of mental chatter that creates and reinforces the view that \"Due to my superiority I can manipulate others to my own advantage\" defines the girls' head-centered per-sonality deficiency, a syndrome dominated by vanity belonging to the female stereotype that the girls represent. The yoginis' demonstration of egolessness, the proof that subject/ object, self/ other dichotomy had been resolved, was performed with verbal acuity showing their non-dual awareness. Further, the head is \"crowned\" by the moon which is the source of the I;>akinl's am-brosia, and this constitutes a suitable offering to the Guru. The Guru's failure to recognize the girls may have been a ploy to examine their realization, but as Santipa's failure to recognize Kotiilipa indicates, in the Indo-Tibetan tradition proximity to the Guru is no prerequisite for successful siidhana, and after the im-perative initiation encounter the disciple may vanish to his retreat and the Guru may forget all about him. One of the many invaluable functions of intuition of the First Noble Truth, the truth of suffer-ing, is a confession of spiritual insufficiency, if not sickness. The en-counter with the doctor-Guru should be profoundly intimate, but thereafter, with medicine in hand, the disciple-patient need have no further recourse to the Guru to achieve the cure of Mahamudra. Clinging to the doctor indicates either a continuing failure on the doctor's part, or hypochondria, or some similar neurotic attach-ment, or a misunderstanding of the doctor's role, on the part of the patient.

Chinnamasta(ka) means Severed-headed, or Severed-headed Mother (T.dBu bead rna).

Renowned as The Quarreler, he worked selflessly for his followers, before proclaiming his realization, and with three hun-dred disciples attaining the J;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana Kilakila's meditation was eminently practical; he was seeking clear light in emotional darkness. Meditating upon another person's words as the echo of emptiness, the mind-created image projected upon the sound by a paranoid mind dissolves, and the ego, no longer feeling threatened by its own projections, ceases to react with competitiveness, aggression, argumentation and fighting, the overt forms of anger. In order to penetrate the sound, and to perceive its nature rather than its ephemeral form, the method concentrates upon the sameness of sound, its empty identity. First discovering the emptiness of external sound, and then the hollowness of one's own sound, all phenomena are seen as insubstantial, self-less, lacking an ens, 824 lacking any pantheistic or personal soul. When Avalokitesvara was asked by the Buddha what object of meditation he preferred, he chose sound and the ear as most suitable to this age; his mantra OM MAJ':'oll PADMA HOM became the most popular of all tantric practices in Tibet. To seat consciousness at the door of the auditory sense, and to listen to the sound of silence, is a medita-tion that can be practiced anywhere, and its rewards are immediate and amazing. Kilakila's goal achieved, the personality problem that had ruined his life was resolved, and he was left with the pure pleasure of listening to all sound as the goddess Sarasvati herself, a lady of infinite sensuous beauty,. intelligence and compassion. Every perception arose spontaneously as the liberated goddess. Such an unpretentious meditation technique can be transposed easily from its Tibetan cultural milieu to the West. Some tantric forms are conspicuous and some tantrikas immediately identifiable as such.

Siidhana The verse of Vetali's instruction to Kantalipa has been edited to make metaphysical sense and to accord with the song of realization; the verse originally identified the needle as compassion and the thread as mindfulness. 325 Kantali's sadhana is to unite skillful means with perfect insight. When his rags have been visualized as emp· tiness they become a unity of form and emptiness. The needle of mindfulness and knowledgem is the means by which the apparently concrete appearance of the rags is perceived as emptiness. The thread of compassion is the skil1ful means by which the rags of emp· tiness are given meaning and purpose. Perfect insight into emptiness is analogous to the rags, and compassionate skillful means is analogous to the thread. The needle of mindfulness and knowledge, referred to as the True Guru827 in the song, is the means of intuiting the emptiness of appearances and of uniting \"objective\" perfect in· sight and \"subjective\" skillful means. Any defectiveness in this analogy lies in the corrupt text. Kantali's J;)akini Guru, Vetali, is one of the fifteen yoginis of the Hevajra ma~<;iala.

In the town of Dhokara lived a low-caste rope maker called Dha-huli. He sold his products in the market-place. One day hard at work, rolling the ku§a grass into a rope, great blisters erupted on the palms of his hands. In great pain he ran weeping to a lonely place, and there a yogin found him and asked him what was the matter. Dhahuli told him the truth. \"If you break down over such a trifling pain, what will happen when you suffer the intolerable agony of the lower realms?\" the yogin asked him. \"Please show me how I can avoid that pain,\" Dhahuli begged.

Then meditate w#h incessant energy Upon the one, origz'nal, insubstantial essence. Persevering in meditation on the meaning of these words of in-struction for twelve years, the rope-maker understood that the con-ventional, nominal concept of \"rope'' had no substantial basis; that the relative, sensorily perceived phenomenon of rope was a consti-tuent part of a field of relativity comprising the totality of the universe; and that the absolute verity of his experience of the rope"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"330 Masters of Mahamudrii was a vast expanse of pure space without boundary or center.

He became well-known as Dhahulipa, and for seven hundred years he wandered through India working selflessly for other people, before proclaiming his realiza-tion and attaining the I;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana Dhahuli's Guru taught him a simple meditation using the categories of the yogiiciira school of practical metaphysics. The yogiiciira \"idealists\" recognized three principles of reality, three \"ab-solutely specific constitutive principles of reality. \"882 The first, name and concept, or \"the notional-conceptual,\" is considered unreal and redundant; it is the conceptual filter that detracts from the possibil-ity of gnostic awareness; figuratively it is the snake into which men-tal functions transform the rope. The second principle is \"the relative,\" which indicates the sensually perceived phenomenon as a union of consciousness, sense organ and sense object; it is an \"illu-sionary reality\" because although it certainly exists it has no substan-tial basis, and it is part of a field of relativity in which all consti-tuents are inter-related. Finally, \"the absolute principle\" is synonymous with emptiness, ultimate reality, the dharmadhiitu. Thus the essence of Dhahuli's rope is the absolute constitutive prin-ciple of reality, the dharmadhiitu, which is his object of meditation. Since the concept of the rope and the rope's conventional, relative form are both insubstantial and baseless, by assuming the absolute, visualizing it and cultivating the intuition that penetrates illusory, concrete appearances, the absolute soon becomes the customary mode of perception-particularly when meditation upon it is unceasing! The warning in Dhahuli's song of realization is very im-portant: knowledge of the absolute rises by a process of relaxation into it, and not by forced concentration of any kind. Whatever can be forced is a dualistic mental function that obstructs gnostic awareness. When the rope has become an hallucination, or like the reflection of the moon in water, all appearances will have become the same, and all things arise as Mahamudra.

Siidhana The precise relationship between the Buddhist tantrikas, the niiths and the kiipaUkas has yet to be defined, but what is clear is that the Buddhist kapiihs and the kapiiUkas shared outer forms, although metaphysical interpretation may have differed. The kiipaUkas were one of four saiva sects (with the pasupatas, sai'vas, and kiiliimukhas) that had evolved parallel to Buddhist Tantra. The kiipiilt\"kas' ethos was derived from their antecedents, upper-caste brahmin-slayers called kapiilins. The kapiiUns were compelled to take the Great Vow (mahiivrata), a twelve year vow of renunciation to absolve their sin. They lived in the jungle naked, begging accord-ing to strict rules, subjecting themselves to ascetic behavior that had a purificatory effect despite themselves. What inspired the kiipiilikas, yogins who gave the Great Vow a soteriological twist, was the knowledge that refuge in this most shameful of human states, where they discovered the essential nature of filth, physical and moral, was the path to the non-dual, one taste of all experience, pure pleasure, and the heights of Siva's Paradise. The kiipiilt\"kas, like the kapiilt'ns before them, gained their name from the skulls they carried. The kapiiUns often carried the skull of the brahmin they had killed; the kiipiilt\"kas sometimes carried skulls of saints or siddhas to extract the virtue of the previous user while maintaining the kapiilt'n guise. The symbology of the skull for the Buddhist tantrika is described in the legend (see also 49). In the kiipiilika tradition, \"He who knows the six insignia, who is proficient in the highest mudra, and who meditates on the Self in the vulva at-"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"338 Masters of Mahamudra tains nirvava. \"338 The six insignia (mudrz'kii ~atka) are necklace, neck ornament, ear-ring, crest-jewel, ashes and sacred thread. The Hevajra-tantra prescribes these six insignia, and its commentaries explain their significance to the wearer, the yogin who takes the vow to Siva. \"He . . . who meditates on the Self in the vulva attains nirvava,\" on the contrary, is a Buddhist statement. The Hevajra-tantra's six bone ornaments are crown, ear-rings, necklace, bracelets (armlets, wristlets and anklets), a belt and the sacred thread. The bone ornaments symbolize the Five Dhyani Buddhas. 839 Kha,tviiriga (trident), symbolizing the I;>akini and kapiila are also ob-jects carried by both Hevajra tantrika and kiipiilt'ka; the ear-rings, common to all, are the principal insignia ofthe niiths, the kiin (ear) pha,ta (split) yogins. There is a tendency to paint the kiipiilikas as ghoulish exotericists, as their contemporary brahmin detractors portrayed them in their anti-tantrika literature, but assuredly they practiced an esoteric in-terpretation of their vows. This is Kavhapa (the Father?): \"It is only the Kapali who can realize Nairatma.\" \"I have become a Kapali without aversion.\" \"The yogin Kavha has become a Kapali, enter-ing the practice of yoga, sporting in the city of the body in a non-dual form. \"840 It cannot be said to whom precisely Kavha referred with his \"Kapali,\" but indubitably our Kapalapa was embraced by that term. One obvious formal distinction between Kapalapa and the kiipiilikas is that the former worshipped Hevajra while the latter worshipped Bhairava and Bhairavi, the wrathful Siva and Consort. While the pasupatas, for instance, took only the male deity as their ~tadevatii, the kiipiilz'kas could worship the Devi, like the siiktas. Finally, the highest definition of The Skull-Bearer (Kapali) is given in a Hevajra-tantra commentary: \"He who cherishes pure pleasure is a Kapali.\"941 Hz'storiography Kapalapa (or Kapalipa, T.Thod pa can) is every skull-bearing tantrika; the name is too general to find a Guru for him.

Arya Avalokitesvara, in the guise of another monk, tested Saroruha's honesty and then offered to reveal to him the Buddha's mode of con-summate enjoyment, the sarJtbhogakiiya, but first the disciple should show his faith and devotion to the Guru and admit his in-capacity to manifest the sarJtbhogakiiya himself.

He moved into an empty cave and tended Saroruha's needs for the duration of his twelve year sadhana. At the beginning of Saroruha's retreat a famine struck the land, and many people died of hunger.

Knowledge of the master's power spread throughout the country and many people were inspired with faith. Then the master gave his servitor, whose name was Rama, initiation and empowerment, and Rama obtained magical powers.

Padmasambhava, Tibet's Great Guru, was the son of a King In-drabhiiti, but he had no connection with any of the events of this legend. Further, he was virtually unknown outside of Tibet, and he had no influence on the eastern Indian mahasiddha lineage. Mahapadmavajra (8th-9th century) was initiated by the Great King Indrabhuti (Hevajra-tantra) and also by the .l)akini Sukhalalita (Guhyasamiija-tantra), and he taught the Swine-herd .l)akini and Anatigavajra. Born a brahmin in Maru (Rajasthan), he worked in O~~iya~a. He is sometimes called Saroruha the Elder. But we can-not identify him with our mahasiddha. 344 Padmavajra, Saroruha the Younger, who was adopted by the king of Kaiici, 845 is our most likely candidate. His main sphere of activity was O~~iya~a. where he learnt the tantras and became royal priest. He gained his experience of the mysteries from the Swine-herd .l)akini; but the king was so offended by this alliance that he had them burnt together, although when they emerged from the flames unharmed the king was converted. The subsequent appearance of Turkish troops in this version of Saroruha's legend is consistent with a lifetime lived in the middle to late ninth century.346 Taranatha specifically identifies Tsokye as The Middle Padmavajra, and also as Saroruha, and in the same passage is found the statement, \"the two iiciiryas Lwa wa pa and Saroruha brought the Hevajra-tantra.\"347 The word \"brought\" has been translated with the sense of \"brought forth\" or \"revealed,\" but it is possible that these two yogins could ac-tually have brought the tantra from O~~iya~a. where Indrabhuti had revealed it, to Batigala, during the reign of Devapala, whose patronage stimulated intense interest in the tantras.

Lacking a sense of humor, the skeptical king had the Guru buried in a pit underneath the royal stables. K~v.a came to his rescue somewhat tardily, and when the king found the Guru still alive after twenty years of interment he gained faith, renounced his kingdom and became the renowned siddha Sangari. 352 But Jalandhara could not have lived to meet Maitripa's contemporary, Sakara, and Gopicav.<;l probably lived earlier than Maitripa.

In support of the more literal interpretation there is the case of the old and apprehen-sive woman in Banares who visualized herself a tigress to such effect that she emptied the city, the inhabitants fleeing from her transmogrified form. But for the yogin to effect change in his vision is one thing; it is quite another for him to alter the \"objective\" real-ity of people around him who have no faith. An example of the ef-ficacy of \"spell\" (mantra) to effect the kind of alteration that led to the evacuation of the city of Banares is demonstrated, for instance, by the power of the Nazi's black magic that created the mass hallucination permitting the holocaust; their \"spell\" altered an entire nation's perception of reality so that genocide could occur in its midst. With the Allied conquest of Germany the democratic spell effected another alteration of illusion, a change to the liberal norm. Christian cults' creation of \"the Kingdom on earth\" is no more a fool's paradise than any self-serving ideal illusion, like \"the American Dream.\" Life is very literally what we make it, and no one individual's vision has any greater ontological validity than any other. Some visions however, have greater efficacy in producing happiness, or liberation from the hold of all relative visions, than others. The Tantra's creative stage visions have built into them a factor that destroys attachment to them, and that ingredient is emp-tiness. Sarvabhalq;a's attachment to form caused the power of his visualization to \"destroy the universe;\" visualizing all things as emp-tiness they became mere illusory light-form and Sarvabhak~a lost all attachment to them.

Abiding in meditative absorption for six months he realized the indivisibility of sarp.sara and nirva:pa, and. reached his goal. He was called Nagabodhi. Nagarjuna appointed Nagabodhi to succeed him as master of the lineage and empowered him to give his disciples the eight great sz'd· dhis as they were required. The eight magical powers were passing through the earth beneath, wielding the sword of awareness, destroying and annihilating, creating and enriching, dispensing the treasures of the pill of divine vision and the eye salve of omniscience, speedwalking, and performing the alchemy of deathlessness. The master commanded him to remain on Sri Parvata, working selflessly for others until he received the revelation of Maitreya, The Buddha of Loving Kindness. It is said that he will remain there for twenty thousand years. Sadhana The premise underlying Nagarjuna's instruction to Nagabodhi is that greed, avarice and attachment857 are a function of the notional· conceptional358 mind. First, conceptual thought separates \"the knower\" from \"the known,\" and with this initial alienation of the ego from the environment a subtle craving for desirable objects"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Mahiisz'ddha Niigabodhz' 353 develops to compensate for feelings of doubt, hesitancy and insecur-ity. This craving reinforces and focuses the notional-conceptional function of isolating the specific sensory stimulus belonging to a desirable object, naming it, conceiving of it as a discrete entity with a substantial essence that can be grasped and possessed. Since desirable objects are delusory, being merely concepts, mental pic-tures arbitrarily composed out of various sensual stimuli, they can never be possessed in a way that brings satisfaction, but the con-stantly reinforced karma of avarice results in the compulsive ac-quisitiveness of the miser and the repetitive crimes of the petty thief or kleptomaniac (not the professional thie£).359 Nagabodhi's ruby horn, the horn of avarice and lust, is explained as reified names and concepts, and this is what causes suffering to the thief as it does to all mankind. A thief differs from the upright citizen in that his moral conditioning has been ineffective or that it has been thrown off by some emotional or intellectual force. Nagabodhi's horn, like all desirable objects, is a reification of a name and concept, here manifested under the controlled conditions of meditation. The horn vanishes when delusions of desirable ob-jects dissolve, when subject and object are realized as essentially empty and when the nature of being360 is realized as emptiness; Sar-vabhak~a's actualized visualization dissolved for the same reasons. With this realization the fear that arose from original alienation, the dualization that is vajrayiina's original sin, is dissolved, and with the confidence that nothing whatsoever can touch one's essential nature of being, just as the sky remains unaffected by the black or white clouds that gather in it, sat:psara and nirval}.a are unified, and mahiimudrii-siddhz' results.

Then they accompanied their Guru to the land of Orissa, where they remained for some time, begging their food. From Orissa they went on to the country of Bhirapuri, to Jantipur, a city of three hundred thousand families. In that city was a great temple wherein seven hundred dancing girls performed wor-ship, and Luipa sought their mistress,· Darima. He was stopped by the three hundred guards protecting her chamber. \"Will your mistress buy a male slave?\" he asked them. \"If I like what I see, I will buy him,\" came a voice from within.

Luipa received payment and departed with the brahmin minister. The king served Darima for twelve years. He washed. her feet, massaged her body, and served her in every way.

When the time was propitious Luipa sought the king, who was expecting a lesser potentate to come to pay tribute the day after Luipa arrived in his town.

Then Luipa performed an abhisamaya siidhana and anointed them, before sending the king to Tsaritrapa in Orissa, where he became known as J;>etigipa (seep. 189), and the minister, admitting a fondness for betel nut, was sent to Kafici City in J;>akinaba in the South, where he was to serve a beautiful whore. His duties consisted in attending to the lady's clients, young bloods and travellers, all of whom would provide for his betel addiction.

Like visualizing all phenomena in a sesame seed at the tip of the nose (26), to find the emptiness in form, to visualize all sound as identical, is to realize the sound of silence, the emptiness in sound. Then sound and emptiness are indivisible, and when attachment to one sense-field is destroyed, attachment to all sense-fields dissolves. So long as intuitive insight into objects of attachment perceives the emptiness, attachment is the path to liberation. 371 The emphasis lies on the subjective element rather than the object of sensual attach-ment; the conceptual mind is the villain of the piece, not any in-herent quality of the object. Mahamudra precepts always return to \"What is mind?\" and \"How can it be returned to its primordial, pristine state of emptiness and clear light?\" Regarding Upanaha's song of realization, the siddha's mind is an instrument upon which he can play existential symphonies, or it is a stage upon which players dance and sing according to his direction.

Meditating upon the empty essence of these emotions, the five modes or aspects of a siddha's awareness are discovered: the awareness of sameness, discriminating awareness, mirror-like awareness, all-accomplishing awareness and awareness like the sky. The key element in virtually all the legends is the initia-tion that first introduces the man eaten up by disgust with himself, or the world, to the essential nature of being, or sahaja, the inborn absolute, that arises co-incident with every moment of perception. Thereafter, by practicing the meditation that induces that same state of knowledge, whatever constructs. arise in the mind are im-mediately liberated, 872 which is to say that they dissolve without pro-ducing any karma of body, speech or mind; they are like bursting bubbles. Historiography Kokilipa (Kokila, Kokala) was king of Camparl).a (Camparana, Campara), which must be Campa (see 60), famous for its pools and flower groves in ancient times. It should be made clear that the Tibetan word translated as \"king\" ( rgyal po) renders the Sanskrit k~etrz'ya, a member of the second caste, the ruling, warrior caste. Thus this \"king\" Kokilipa could have been only a local land owner, \"squire,\" or \"lord of the manor.\" Since Kokila is such an unusual name, it is possible that our Kokilipa is Vidhyakokila (Rig pa'i khyu byug), who was a disciple of Candrakirti and the Guru of Kusulu the Younger in a Guhyasamaja lineage.373 He also appears in the list of Atisa Sri Dipatikara's \"fourteen other teachers,\" so we cannot be certain of his dates. 374"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"81 THE MAHASIDDHA ANANGAPA THE HANDSOME FOOL Sarrtsiira is z'nsubstantz'al Nke a dream, Tht's body iridescent Nke a raz'nbow; But poisoned by nescience, desire and vanity, We cling to z'llusion, believz'ng z't to be real.

There was a low-caste man of Gauga, who due to his practice of patience and tolerance in past lives, was endowed with a par· ticularly beautiful body. Comparing himself with others, he became very conceited. One day a gentle and courteous monk accosted him and graciously begged alms. Anailga, the handsome youth, invited him to his house, asking him to accept his hospitality for a few days. The monk accepted, and Ananga washed his feet, prepared a couch for him, and offered him good food. \"Why do you beg and mortify yourself like this?\" he asked the monk. \"To free myself from the fear that the wheel of existence has in· stilled in me,\" the monk replied. \"What is the difference between the basis of your character and mine?\" Anailga asked him. \"There's a great deal of difference,\" replied the monk. \"Conceit is the basis of your character and pride is devoid of creative potential. The basis of my character is faith, and faith creates immense capacities.\" \"What kind of capacities?\" Anailga asked. \"In this lifetime the capacity to practice Dharma, so that the problems of men and gods are resolved,\" the monk told him. \"But ultimately the capacity to obtain the Body of a Buddha, which"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Mahasiddha Anangapa 369 depends on faith.\" The monk elaborated upon the various mundane and supra-mundane qualities and powers. \"Is it possible for me to obtain this capacity?\" Anatiga asked him. \"Have you any skill at craft or trade?\" enquired the monk. \"I can do nothing of that sort,\" Anatiga replied. \"Then can you sit still and meditate?\" asked the monk. \"That I can do,\" Anatiga asserted. The monk bestowed upon him the initiation and empowerment of Sarpvara and instructed him in the inherent lucency of the six sense· fields. All the multiplicity of appearance Exists as nothing but the nature of your mind. Let the objects of your six sensejields alone And abz'de in a state of freedom and non-attachment. Anatiga meditated accordingly, and within six months he had reached his goal. As Guru Anatigapada he worked selflessly for others, and finally in his very body he attained the J;>akini's Paradise. Siidhana The faith of a Bodhisattva is not the faith of evangelical Chris· tianity, for example. It is \"confidence\" rather than blind faith. The Buddhist is taught to examine, question, and take nothing on trust in doctrinal matters. The Buddhist cannot believe in a Creator-Father God in the sky until he has direct experience of him; all the gods of the Buddhist pantheon are meta-psychic realities of whom he has intimate knowledge through meditation. Faith to Anatiga's Guru was divine confidence in the truth of his own insights, the power of his attainments, th.e efficacy of his practice, and knowledge375 of the meta-psychic realities of Guru, Deva and J;>akini substan-tiated and reinforced by every instant of intuition into the nature of experience as empty space. Such faith is inviolable, indestructible vajra-faith. 876 The instruction the monk gave Anatiga is a modified form of the basic vipasyanii meditation technique. Vtpasyanii, \"heightened perception,\" is otherwise known as \"guarding the doors of the senses.\" Lodging consciousness at the doors of perception, in the sense organs themselves, whatev-et· objects arise are watched without"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"370 Masters of Mahiimudrii interference. Such a technique can be practiced throughout one's waking hours, and the immediate effect is a heightening in the in-tensity, vividness and clarity of perception. With practice, insight into the emptiness of the sense-fields should arise, and then \"freedom and non-attachment\" occurs. \"Freeedom\" is space free of obstructions-prejudices, preconceptions, emotional at-tachments-that tie up, construct and block the free-flow of energies. \"Non-attachment\" is the result of intuition of emptiness. 877 When sense objects are perceived to be nothing but space they cease to be desirable, and the one flavor of pure awareness replaces the variety of positive and negative feelings that are the result of attach-ment. Historiography Anangapada can be identified with Anangavajra, an important link in the Hevajra lineage, the disciple of Padmavajra and the Guru of Saroruha (74). He was born in Gau~a (Gahura, Ghahuri),878 a city-state on the Ganges in eastern Bihar and western Bengal, and he travelled to the North-west to receive his training, like several of his contemporaries from eastern India. Padmavajra sent him to the Kotamba Mountain {?), and after twelve years he attained st'ddhi. To cap his training he then sent Anailga to the Swine-herd J;>akini, who also taught Saroruha, and keeping pigs he became identical to Vajrasattva. Still in O~~iya:pa, he performed Bodhisattva service.879 The Swine-herd J;>akini gives us intimation of Vajra Varahi, the Sow-headed Consort of Sarp.vara; but there is also significance in her untouchable caste and the uncleanliness of her work. One tradition makes Ananga a son of the founder of the Pala dynasty, Gopala (AD 735-761).380 The Palas were of low caste like Anailga, a sudra, and Dharmapala and Devapala, Gopala's suc-cessors, were known as Gau~isvara, Lord of Gau~a. Gau~a was Anailga's birthplace, but his royal ancestry is not confirmed. Besides Padmavajra, Kambala and a disciple of J;>ombi Heruka are men-tioned as his Gurus, and Viriipa, Lilavajra and the last Indrabhiiti as his disciples. These siddhas place him in the middle of the ninth century. Sarp.vara and Hevajra were his principal absorption, but he was also an initiate of the Guhyasamiija-tantra.

Her despondence turned to sickness of heart when some time later a prince and his party cantered by, obviously having returned from the chase, as many animals' carcasses hung over their saddles.

She then locked herself in the chamber that her husband had provided, refusing to admit anyone for ten days. She tore off her clothes, covered herself with oil and coal dust, mussed her hair and feigned insanity, all the while unswervingly concen-trating upon the essential truth in her heart. In despair the prince sent doctors to treat her, but she attacked them and threw things about whenever they approached. A messenger was sent to In-drabhuti, but her brother was untroubled, realizing that his sister was demonstrating her revulsion for sarpsara. Henceforth Lak~mitikara was to all appearances insane. Escaping from the palace she scavenged food thrown out for dogs, and slept in the cremation ground, but all the while she was deepening her ex-perience of the essential nirval).a. After seven years she attained sid-dhi. Then she instructed a sweeper of the king's latrines, who had served her, and this man quickly gained the capacity of a Buddha, without anyone's knowledge. At about this time King Jalendra went hunting with his court. He became separated from the party and dismounted to rest. He fell asleep, and awakening when evening was upon him he could not find his way. When he stumbled upon Lak~mitikara's cave his curiosity was aroused, and approaching quietly, peering inside he saw the yogini, her body radiating light, surrounded by numerous goddesses worshiping her. Perfect faith arising in his heart, he re-mained there the night, and although he found his way back to the city the next day he could not keep from returning to the cave. He prostrated before La~mitikara, and in response to her doubtful en-quiry as to his motives he affirmed his faith in her as a Buddha and asked her for instruction. Lak~miilkara taught him these verses: All beings on the wheel of rebirth suffer, For in sa1]'tsiira there is not a moment of bliss. Even superior beings, men and gods, are tormented, Whz\"le the lower realms are pain itself, Where ravenous beasts constantly devour each other, Some beings ceaselessly tormented by heat and cold.

He invited him to his throne room, sat him upon the throne, prostrated before him; and requested instruction. He received initiation by transfer of the Guru's grace, and he was taught the creative and fulfillment stages of Vajra Varahi's sadhana. Lak~minkara and the sweeper performed many miracles in the town of Latikapuri before she bodily attained the J;>akini's Paradise; Siidhana Unlike Ma:l).ibhadra (6.5), who married after she had received in-itiation, becoming a model wife, Lak~mitikara took the hard path, although she was quite unprepared for it by her upbringing. No doubt the approaching trauma of the nuptials of an otherworldly and delicate sixteen-year-old with a mature warrior prince, whom she had not met since she was a child of seven, was a strong factor in favor of her renunciation. Still today in India both men and women, but more frequently men, opt out of the horror of the first night of an arranged marriage and take brahmiiciirt'n vows of celibacy in an iiSram. Such individuals have fine potential for sublimating their sexual energy in an internalku11-¢alz'niyoga, and the price they pay, which is some degree of social ostracism, and in Lak~mitikara's case complete rejection as an idiot, assists in providing a totally undemanding environment. This is a harsh path, and after seven years Lak~mitikara's associates and converts were of the lowest social caste; no doubt many who take this path do not attain their goal. But those women who do make it through are certainly of a most ex-traordinary type and, more than their male counterparts, deserve every respect for their success.

In this way the discrepancy in the lineages, some of which begin with La~mi and others with Kambala, is explained. 381 But there is another problem stemming from the lineages: her disciple was Virupa, who taught Avadhutipa (Maitripa) and Pai:pQ.apatika, younger contemporaries of Naropa. The great Virupa, born in the eighth century, could hardly have taken initiation from a yogini at the end of the ninth, when In-drabhuti, his sister and Kambala were still alive; that must have been another Virupa, probably the disciple of Anatigavajra who received the Mahiikariirtika-tantra from Kambala. Otherwise, if it was Virupa III at the beginning of the eleventh century who receiv-ed the Six Topics, it could have been Sri Lak~mi the Great of Kashmir (who could also have been the Lak~mi who taught the anuttarayoga-tantra to Karopa, a disciple of Maitripa) who initiated the tradition. Kashmiri Lak~mi's Guru was the brahmin scholar Bhadra (Suryaketu) who taught her in Kashmir during Naropa's lifetime.882 This problem is yet to be resolved. Indrabhuti and Lak~minkara, brother and sister, were also Guru and disciple. Lak~mi received the Guhyasamaja from Cittavajra (also described as her brother), and taught it to Indrabhuti.383 Here the identification of Indrabhiiti with Kambala is important (seep. 184), as Lak~mi's Sa:rp.vara and Hevajra Guru would have been her brother. Anatigavajra is another of her Gurus. Finally, another Lak~mi should be mentioned. The nun Sri Lak~mi, also of Kashmir, initiated the tradition of fasting to pro-pitiate Avalokitesvara (T.smyung gnas).384 This lineage has no recorded Indian succession, and it is probable that from Sri Lak~mi the teaching was transmitted directly to Tibet. Sri Lak~mi lived in the eleventh century, when Kashmir was on the point of destruction by the Muslims. In Tibetan La~minkara, Provider of Fortune, is sometimes rendered as the Well-matured (T.Legs smin kara), or as Glorious Creatrix (T.dPal mdzad rna) or Glorious Goddess (T.dPallha mo), confounded with the epitome of beauty and bounteousness that is the Goddess Lakt~mi, consort of Vi~:pu. ."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"83 THE SIDDHA SAMUDRA THE PEARL DIVER Wlth realz'zatz'on of the unborn, but wz'thout med#atz'on traz'nz\"ng, The yogz'n z's lz'ke a cannz'bal wz'th a baby z'n hz's arms.

After expressing his realization and work-ing selflessly for others, he attained the 1)akini's Paradise with eight hundred disciples. Siidhana Again in Samudra's story we are overwhelmed by the assertion of universal and unmitigated misery. There is no moment of real hap-piness in satp.sara; man has created a mental prison that is unalleviated pain. Such statements, from an ultimate standpoint, are no more true than their opposite, but like all tantric doctrine they are skillful means with a definite purpose. In order to gain the siddhas' freedom it is first necessary to confirm the prison from which escape is to be made. So long as our beliefs about the human condition are equivocal and uncertain, permitting callow notions like, \"It's really not so bad, is it?\" and \"There are compensations!\" and \"Love is happiness,\" then aspiration will not be sufficiently in-tense, or focused, to achieve release. Thus it is at times of profound despond that the Guru's message is met with acceptance, and then confirming the prison by thinking of the key the prison is destroyed once and for all. · The way to destroy the prison is to destroy the mental constructs, the conceptions and discursive thought derived from those con-structs-the notion of an ego, the division into subject and object, the belief in external, discrete entities and an objective, concrete reality-that are created by knotted channels and contaminated energies originating in the head center. The 1)akini's fire in the gut center melts the moon in the head center and the nectar flowing down the central channel creates the four levels of joy-joy, superior joy, detached joy, innate joy-in the head, throat, heart and gut centers respectively.

He became a wandering beggar. One day he found himself in a village on the banks of the Ganges near a Ramacandra temple, and there he met a courtesan, who showed him a book that she had found while bathing.

When she informed Vyali, his only con-cern was whether she had told anyone else, and he remained anxious until he confirmed that nobody else knew. That evening the courtesan sprinkled some cht'riiitii upon Vyali's food. Previously he had been unable to taste this most astringent of herbs, but riow he could taste it, and the courtesan interpreted this as a sign of success. \"The principal sign of success is a circle of the eight auspicious symbols turning clockwise in the sky-a precious canopy, two golden fishes, the pot of treasure, a kamala flower, a white conch, an eter-nal knot, a victory banner, and an eight-spoked wheel,\" he told her. \"Certainly we have been blessed with extraordinary fortune.\" The brahmin Vyali, the courtesan, and a mare, partook of the potion, and all of them attained the siddhi of deathlessness. But out of jealousy, Vyali decided to deny the fruits of their labor to everyone else, keeping the recipe to themselves. When they went to the heavens they were, therefore, spurned by the gods, so they went to live in the land of Kilampara. They made their home in the shade of a tree on the top of a rock that was one mile high, ten times the distance sound will travel in width, and surrounded by a swamp. Arya Nagarjuna, who had accomplished the power of flight, vowed to recover the secret of immortality that had been lost to In· dia. He flew to the top of the rock, and after hiding one of his shoes he prostrated before the brahmin. Admitting that it was by the power of his shoe that he had gained the top of the rock, Nagarjuna agreed to give Vyali the shoe in return for the recipe, and after Vyali had given him instruction he returned to India with the remaining magical shoe. On the mountain Sri Parvata he continued his prac· tice for the sake of all beings. The moral of this story is that it is very difficult to obtain the Guru's secret instruction if the mindstream is possessed by a com· pulsive attachment to gold and material wealth. Emotional attach· ment precludes evolution of positive talents and qualities and the ultimate capacity of Buddhahood.

The element that has been repetitively stressed in most of the legends, and which is lack-ing in this story, is the aspirant's world sickness, contrition, and a turning around in the seat of consciousness that purifies the mind-stream and opens it to the Guru's initiation and instruction. Thus the legends' final message is that without purification of the mind the path to Buddhahood is blocked. The brahmin's missing ingredient, emblic myrobalan, is highly extolled in India. by ayurvedic, homeopathic and naturopathic materz'a medz'cas alike. Myrobalans are dried plum-like fruits, their kernels of diverse species all known by their excessive astringency. They have been exported from India since Roman times for dying cloth and for their curative properties. European pharmacopeias of the middle ages attest to their miraculous properties. In both India and Tibet emblic myrobalail is combined with cherubic myrobalan and beleric myrobalan to form the highly regarded panacea and giver of longevity and potency called The Three Fruits. 887 Synonyms of emblic myrobalan in Tibetan indicate the attributes of the drug: Source of Youth, Sustainer of Youthfulness, The Glorious. 888 It is an important ingredient in the magical substance called \"ambrosia-medicine\"889 distributed during long-life empowerments by the Lamas. We have no information concerning the specific red variety of the drug mentioned in the text; perhaps the adjective has a purely symbolic connotation. The ground stalks of chz'raftii are also known for their excessive astringency;890 perhaps the obscurity of the func-tion of cht\"riiitii in the legend can be clarified if cht\"riiita is understood as a generic term for astringents, and the bitter potion of immortality as the more bitter condiment that Vyali's jaded palate could taste.

A disciple of Naropa, Kalapada junior and Bodhibhadra, he taught and .col-laborated in translation with many Tibetans including gNyan, sGrwa, 'Gos, rMa, and Se Lotsawas (Translators). He wrote com-mentaries on all the major tantras. The N¥pannayogiivali, 599 his best known work in the West, is not an iconographical textbook but a compendium of creative stage sadhanas in quintessential form. Abhayakara and the Tibetan Sanskritist and scholar Tsa mi Sangs rgyas grags pa, both disciples of Bodhibhadra, collaborated in a translation of the Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi'i rtogs pa gur du bzhengs pa. 400 If Abhayakara translated one part of the siddha cycle it ,is quite possible that he translated it all, and is, therefore, Abhayadatta Sri. However, can Sangs rgyas grags pa be identified with sMon grub shes rab? sMon grub shes rab and Abhayadatta Sri also translated the Songs of Realt'zatt\"on (Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzht\"'i rtogs pa snying po rdo rje'i glu) and its commentary (Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi'i rtogs rjod do ha 'grel bcas), both of which belong to The Cycle of Blesst'ngs. The \"compiler\" of the songs was Acarya Vira Prakasa (sLob dpon dPa' bo 'od gsal). Although some of the songs refer directly to the siddha's sadhana in the legend, many others have no bearing whatsoever on the legend, and since the style and vocabulary of the songs is consistent it is conceivable that having im-mersed himself thoroughly in the siddhas' sadhanas both in theory and practice, Vira Prakasa himself \"discovered\" the songs as revela-tions of the siddhas' spirit. The significance of the songs as inspired gnostic poetry of an adept in Mahamudra is in no way diminished thereby. The translator Mi nyag Tsa mi sMon grub shes rab bzang po lotsawa, or Mi nyag pa, belonged to the Mi nyag tribe. Before their diaspora effected by Genghis Khan in the 11th c., the Mi nyag pas formed a strong kingdom in the Tibetan marches east and south-east of Kokonor.

As for Vira Prakasa, there is a case for identifying him with the narrator of The Legends, and here the. word narrator is used advisedly as nowhere is it said that Abhayadat· ta \"wrote\" (T. mdzad) the legends-he \"speaks\" or \"narrates~· (gsung). In the sGrub thabs kun btus (see above) there is a reference to \"comprehensive biographies of the mahasiddhas, writ-ten by the pm;u;b'ta Vira Prakasa, included in the sNar thang bsTan 'gyur. Since our legends are the only comprehensive legends in the bsTan 'gyur, this reference appears to identify Vira Prakasa as the author, if not the narrator of The Legends. No other data on Vira Prakasa has come to light, although he did write a Niimiivali, a short synopsis giving name, location, Guru and siddhz' of the eighty· four mahasiddhas of the legends.401 If the evidence of the Grub thabs kun btus is found inadmissible due to the collection's late date (19th c.), then the most that can be said concerning the authorship of The Legends is that in the late eleventh or early twelfth century Abhayadatta Sri, possibly Abhayakaragupta, narrated the oral tradition to the monk Mi nyag Tsa mi sMon grub shes rab, who may be Tsa mi Sangs rgyas grags pa, who wrote it down in Tibetan. Only one Indian source of historical information on the siddhas has been discovered. Prof. Tucci found a fragment of a Guru· paramparii, a lineage text, in Nepal. 402 In Tibetan there are six works written between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries with some claim to historiographical notice. Bu ston (AD 1290-1354), the bKa' gdams pa compiler of the bsTan 'gyur, wrote a History of the Dharma in India (rGya gar chos 'byung) including several lives of siddhas,408 and in his Collected Works (gSung 'bum) he gives fur-ther biographical clues in legends of his lineage's Indian"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Appendix I: Texts and Sources 387 antecedents.404 The Blue Annals (sDeb ther sngon po), 405 written by 'Gos Lotsawa (AD 1392-1481), is a lineal history including most of the important Indian lineages, with anecdotes upon important per-sonalities; despite inconsistencies and inaccuracies this constitutes our most valuable comprehensive source. The Collected Works of the great, founding Sa skya hierarchs (Sa skya bka 'bum), who lived AD 1092-1280, including 'Phags pa's biographical notes on Indian lineage holders, is accorded greatest respect by historians. 406 Last and least is the Tibetan historiap.Taranatha (b.1575), who wrote a History of the Dharma t'n India and the Seven Lineages ( bKa' 'bab bdun ldan), a history of seven Indian lineages.4°7 All these Tibetan works suffer from the same faults-or virtues. The religious didactic imperative intrudes everywhere, as it does at every level of Tibetan culture, and wherever historical fact existed invariably it has been subjected to a philosophical or moral argu-ment. Thus historical anecdote has become legend, and history a means to a soteriological end. When considering lineal history, from the Guru's point of view, time is an illusion and human progress a delusion; personality is the detritus of existence and an anonymous embodiment of Buddha nature the reality upon which to focus and which to underscore. Disdain for history is reflected in the lineages' failure to record an exact record of lineal succession, despite the respect for their founders who are worshiped as Buddhas. To establish the original lineages from the Tibetan material is fraught with difficulty. A plurality of names for each siddha and a plurality of siddhas with the same name are the chief problems. Siddhas who were monks received a name at ordination and again at their tantric initiation; then at each successive initiation they would acquire new initiatory names to be used within that community and lineage. Fur-ther, many siddhas received sobriquets or nicknames, or were known by an epithet such as Acititapa or Avadhiitipa. Sometimes the Tibetan translators translated the siddhas' Indian names, but generally they transliterated them, and in the process of copying the Sanskrit transliteration generation after generation it became cor-rupted, sometimes out of all recognition. This corruption coupled with the Apabhra:rp.~a dialects' variant forms explains the many variations of the siddhas' names found in different sources and edi-tions of the legends: many are noted in the commentary. James Robinson's work in Buddha's Lions4°8 has assisted in an attempt to reconstruct the original names by etymological means. But the"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"388 Masters of Mahamudra lineages' greatest historiographical sin was to confound yogins of the same name. During the siddha period it became customary for ld,~ itiates to take the names of their great mahayana forebears (lik:~ Nagarjuna and Aryadeva), and also for a disciple to take the natri~ of his Guru (Ka1;1ha and Kala-pada); further, there was failure t~ distinguish between siddhas with the same caste name (Vya~i, Kum} bhari), with names referring to their tribe or color (Savari, KaQ.ha), and with identical sobriquets-a Dog-siddha (Kukkuripa) was active throughout the siddha period. Much work remains to be done on the identification of the siddhas, reconstructing their lineages and. placing their lifetimes exactly. The chief chronological problem lies in creating a genealogical tree that takes into consideration the possibility of the extraordinary longevity, if not immortality, attain-ed by those siddhas whose yoga gave them control over their lifespan. The accumulation of our conclusions as to the siddhas' lineages and dates is presented in Appendix II, although this genealogy is only tentative and awaits adjustment and repair by other scholars. Whatever the identities of Abhayadatta Sri and Mi nyag pa, their work originated in the late eleventh or early twelfth century, and is, therefore, the earliest extant source of information relating to the siddhas. The narrator and translator could even have known some of the eleventh century siddhas-Kalapa (Pi1;1~opa), Celuka, Kar-maripa, Megopa, Santipa and Naropa. Why, then, are some legends not historiographically credible? For example, it is our opi-nion that Darikapa and J;>etigipa, king and minister in our legends, were actually minister and king respectively; Naropa, who died in AD llOO, was a great pattr;lita at Nalanda before his renunciation according to his biography, yet his legend makes him a woodcutter; and was Nagabodhi really a thief? The answer must be that the legends were related as legend with total disregard for historical ac-curacy; they must be appreciated primarily as instruction in the Tantra. It is a telling commentary on the nature of the material at our disposal relating to the siddhas that The Legends constitute a major source of historical information."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Appendzx II The Sz\"ddhas' Genealogy The identification and putative dates of the siddhas given in the commentary represents the most obvious conclusions to be drawn from the Tibetan sources-legends and lineages. Few ofthese asser-tions, however, are incontrovertible; to make such simple statements, ignoring frequent credible alternatives and intricate supporting arguments, involved highly selective editing. The basic assumption of our chronology is that the eighty-four siddhas, with the exception of Indrabhfrti the Great and an early Kukkuripa, lived within the Pala and Sena period (AD 750-1200). Tantra had flourished for centuries before Gopala came to power in Bangala; the Guhyasamaja-tantra may have been written down as early as the fifth century. But it is our contention that Tantra did not become publicly acceptable until the kings of our legends adopted it, the siddha-scholars rewrote and classified the tantras, and the sadhu-siddhas taught it in the villages. Thus, although the Guhyasamaja existed before Indrabhfrti's time, this great tantric king was respons-ible for \"discovering\" it in its final form and boosting Tantra's ac-ceptability by adopting it as his sadhana. Although the identifica-tion of Indrabhfrti is the most intractable problem in the genealogy, he probably lived in the seventh century and into the eighth. The siddhas of the legends belong to the mother-tantra tradition. Nearly forty of the eighty-four siddhas received initiation into the Hevajra or Sa1Jlvara-tantra, while only seven entered the Guhyasamaja ma~~ala, a father-tantra. These seven were Nagar-juna and his three disciples-Aryadeva, Nagabodhi and Kucipa-plus Bhande, Nalina and Kilakila.

Throughout the legends the accent is on Mahamudra, which is associated with the fulfillment stage yoga of the Sa1]tvara-tantra, and specifically with Naropa's practices and ·Lak~minkara's Six Topz'cs of Viiriihi. The concept of Mahamudra is to be found in rDzogs chen works presumably pre-dating Saraha, written in north-west India, but Saraha formulated it as the ultimate path and goal and initiated a lineage that flourish-ed in the monastic academies of Bangala, such as Nalanda, VikramaSila and Somapuri. If the origins of the Sa1]tvara-tantra were known, the history of Mahamudra would be clearer; but it is only conjecture that both the Hevajra and Sa1]tvara-tantras originated in OQ.Q.iya:pa, to be transmitted by pilgrims, and later by refugees, to Aryavarta, the Holy Land of the Buddhists with Va-jrasana (Bodh Gaya) at its center. Further, before OQ.Q.iya:pa was overrun and destroyed by the Muslims in the ninth century, students from all over India went to this Land of the I;>akinis for training, Saroruha, Kambala, Anangavajra, Lilavajra, Luipa and Saraha himself, amongst them, and the siddhas could have brought back these tantras with them. Finally, if rDzogs chen was taught in Va-jrasana, Mahamudra may have been the result of rDzogs chen's in-fluence.409 Whatever the antecedents of Mahamudra, it is to be assumed that the siddhas who practiced a Mahamudra-sadhana lived after its great proponent Saraha. Saraha is the cornerstone of the siddhas' genealogical tree. If it is accepted that Saraha was a contemporary of the Pala Emperor Dharmapala, that he was both a product and an instrument of the Buddhist renaissance in Aryavarta and Bangala, that he was active in the last part of the eighth century and into the ninth, then the foundation of the genealogy is established, and only the precise dates of the siddhas remain in dispute. It should be emphasized that these assertions cannot be shared by those who accept Taranatha's chronology as sacrosanct. According to the great Tibetan historian's notions the eighty-four mahasiddhas' lives were spread out over eight centuries rather than bunched together in a closely knit lineal family, all the siddhas born within a few generations of each other. However, it is probably incorrect to give overwhelming primacy to the Palas and Bangala to the exclusion of other Buddhist tantric kings and principalities.

In Sn Lanka, where nil-siidhana was also practiced, vajiraviida was responsible for the virtual eradication of the hinayana (see p. 98). Tantra was known throughout the Hindu world, and undoubtedly siddhas arose outside the Pala Empire, and no doubt academies like VikramaSila, on a smaller scale, were founded elsewhere. However, forty-seven of the siddhas are associated with the Pala Empire, com-pared to nine with the South and the two born in the North-west. Kalapa has been identified as the last of the eighty-four siddhas. On the assumption that Kalapa is KalacakrapadaJunior, Pit;1<;lopa, the disciple of Kala-pada Senior, Celuka (whose Guru Maitripa lived AD 1010-1089), he was born in the middle of the eleventh century and survived well into the twelfth. However, Jayananda, the Kashmiri Pat;1<;lita, who travelled extensively in Tibet in the twelfth century, was probably born a generation after Pit;1c;lopa; and there is no greater difficulty in identifying the Kashmiri Pat;1c;lita with Jayananda than Pit;1<;lopa with Kalapa. Supporting the assertion of an early date of composition of The Legends is the omission of several of the last great siddhas from the eighty-four. Vajrapat;1i, Vajrasana, Abhayakaragupta and Mitra yogi, amongst many others who achieved as much as their lineal predecessors, sustained the tradition until the end of the twelfth century. In 1199 AD Mohammed bin Bukhtiar, taking VikramaSila for a fort, destroyed the academy and its invaluable library, massacring the monks; thus the Sena dynasty that had replaced the Palas in 1162 AD was destroyed, and Buddhism in Bailgala died. Many tantrikas fled north, to Nepal and Tibet, where their salutary influence promoted the Tantra, par-ticularly in the Sa skya monasteries in gTsang. Those who remained, together with the laymen of the conquered Buddhist states, are assumed to have converted to Islam hoping to sustain their internal practice behind a mask of the foreign religion, or they died for their beliefs. Where the decision of Islam or the sword was not forced upon them, without the monasteries that had always been the focal point of Buddhist culture, and deprived of the support of monks, iiciiryas and yogins, they were reabsorbed into the heterogenous brahmanical religion.

When the sadhaka has identified himself with the deity through mantra, all his speech is mantra unerringly reflecting or actualizing reality. Thus the Guru's word has the power to transmit the meaning of the goal-path to the mind of the disciple, and it is this function that gives the term \"secret mantra,\" guhyamantra (T.gsang sngags) its significance as a synonym of vajrayana.

The bauddha-tantra, Buddhist Tantra, is divided into four classes (q.v.), and the highest of the four (anuttarayoga-tantra) include the siddhas' tantras and Mahamudra. In another division of \"higher\" and \"lower\" the higher Tantra's goal is Buddhahood and the lower Tantra's goals are mundane, such as health, wealth, divination or success in any endeavor. In its esoteric sense Tantra is the continuity of union between the male and female principles, skillful means and perfect insight, which is perceived by the realized siddha as a dance of his l)akini, at one with him though separate. Tantra with an initial capital letter indicates Tantra as a vehicle to a soteriological aim, a spiritual path, a corpus of yoga techniques and the ethos of religion; tantra in its limited, technical sense refers to the original scriptural compilations of meditation techniques and rites assodated with the propitiation of a particular deity such as Sarpvara in the Sa't]'tvara-tantra, and Hevajra in the Hevajra-tantra.

Vedanta: the school of non-dual (advaita) metaphysics, originating from a madhyamika lineage of Nagarjuna, adapted by Satikaracarya, a saiva reformer, who founded the Ten Orders (dasnamz) of saz'va renunciates, and gave Hinduism an esoteric, non· dual metaphysic commensurate to Mahamudra.
