These texts have been selected in consultation with the preeminent lineage holders of all the schools and other senior Tibetan scholars to rep­resent the Tibetan literary tradition as a whole. The works included in the series span more than a millennium and cover the vast expanse of classical Tibetan knowledge— from the core teaching's of the specific schools to such diverse fields as ethics, philoso­phy, psychology, Buddhist teachings and meditative practices, civic and social responsibilities, linguistics, medicine, astronomy and astrology, folklore, and histori­ography.Ornament o f Stainless Light: A n Exposition o f the Kalacakra Tantra Khedrup Norsang Gyatso (1423-1513)The Kalacakra, literally “wheel of time,” likely evolved into a full-fledged system of theory and praxis within Indian Mahayana Buddhism around the tenth century. In expounding the root text of this important Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, Indian mas­ter Pundarlka, who according to legend was one of the Kalkl kings of the mythic land of Shambhala, wrote the influential work Stainless Light. Our volume is an authorita­tive Tibetan exposition of this important Buddhist text. The transmission of the Kalacakra teachings came to Tibet in the eleventh century when Gyijo Oser translated the key texts of this system into Tibetan.One of the central themes of the Kalacakra literature is a detailed understanding of a correlation between the human body and the external universe. A s part of work­ing out this complex correspondence, the Kalacakra texts present an amazingly detailed theory of cosmology and astronomy, especially about the movements of the various celestial bodies. They also present a highly complex system of Buddhist theory and practice that involve, among others, the employment of vital bodily energies, deep med­itative mental states, and a penetrative focus on subtle points within the body’s key energy conduits known as “channels.”The Kalacakra teachings attracted commentarial works from many great Tibetan authors. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso’s O rnament o f Stainless Light, which has been selected specially by His Holiness the Dalai Lama for inclusion in The Library o f Tibetan Clas­sics, ranks among the most authoritative works on the theory and practice of this impor­tant Buddhist system."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T H E LIBRARY OF TIBETAN CLASSICS • VOLUME 14 Thupten Jinpa, General EditorOr n a m e n t o f St a i n l e s s Li g h tAn Exposition o f the Kalacakra TantraKhedrup Norsang GyatsoTranslated by Gavin KiltyWi s d o m Pu b l i c a t i o n s • Bo s t o n in association with the Institute of Tibetan Classics"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Wisdom Publications 199 Elm Street Somerville MA 02144 USA www.wisdompubs.org©2004 Institute of Tibetan Classics All rights reserved.First Edition 09 08 07 06 05 04 6 54321No part of this book may be reproduced in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photography, recording, or by any information storage or retrieval system or technologies now known or later developed, without permission in writing from the publisher.Library o f Congress Cataloging-in-Publication D ata Nor-bzan-rgya-mtsho, Mkhas-grub, 1423-1513.Ornament of stainless light: an exposition of the kalacakra tantra / Khedrup Norsang Gyatso ; translated by Gavin Kilty, p. cm.\"Author2: Jinpa, Thupten\"— Cip, data sheet.Includes bibliographical references and index.ISBN 0-86171-452-0 (hd. : alk. paper)1.

As evidenced from the historical writings, this flowering of Buddhist tradition in the country brought about the fulfillment of the deep spiritual aspirations of countless sentient beings. In particular, it con­tributed to the inner peace and tranquillity of the peoples of Tibet, Outer Mongolia— a country historically suffused with Tibetan Buddhism and its culture— the Tuva and Kalmuk regions in present-day Russia, the outer regions of mainland China, and the entire trans-Himalayan areas on the southern side, including Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, Kinnaur, and Spiti. Today this tradition of Buddhism has the potential to make significant contributions to the welfare of the entire human family. I have no doubt that, when combined with the methods and insights of modern science, the Tibetan Buddhist cultural heritage and knowledge will help foster a more enlightened and compassionate human society, a humanity that is at peace with itself, with fellow sentient beings, and with the natural world at large.It is for this reason I am delighted that the Institute of Tibetan Classics in Montreal, Canada, is compiling a thirty-volume series containing the works of many great Tibetan teachers, philosophers, scholars, and practi­tioners representing all major Tibetan schools and traditions.

This work, ably trans­lated by Gavin Kilty, is the debut volume in English from The Library o f T ibetan Classics, although it is volume fourteen in the series.Two primary objectives have guided the creation and development of The Library o f Tibetan Classics. The first is to help revitalize the appreciation and study of the important texts of the Tibetan classical cultural heritage within Tibetan-speaking communities all over the world, especially among the younger generation, whose lives represent the challenge of coexistence between traditional Tibetan culture and the realities of modern industrial existence. To this end, efforts have been made to develop a comprehensive yet manageable body of texts that feature the works of Tibet’s best-known authors and span the entire gamut of classical Tibetan knowledge. The sec­ond objective for The Library o f Tibetan Classics is to help make these clas­sical Tibetan texts part of global literary and intellectual heritage through translation into contemporary European and other languages. In this regard we have made extensive efforts to make the English text of the Classics series reader-friendly. As much as possible, efforts have been made to ensure the main body of the text is free of unnecessary scholarly apparatus, which often intimidates the general reader. For those specialists who wish to compare the translation with the Tibetan original, the page references to the critical edi­tion of the Tibetan text have been embedded within the translation.Several other important considerations underlie the development of this series. The texts in the series span more than a millennium, beginning from the development of the current Tibetan script in the seventh century to the first part of the twentieth century, when Tibetan society and its culture were abruptly confronted with the modern industrial age. The volumes are"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"thematically organized and cover the following sixteen broad categories of classical Tibetan knowledge: (i) specific teachings of the Tibetan schools, (2) the bodhisattva’s altruistic ideal, (3) presentation of the three codes, (4) the generation and completion stages of highest yoga tantra, (5) the Per­fection of Wisdom studies, (6) the theory of buddha-nature, (7) the Mid­dle Way philosophy of emptiness, (8) logic and epistemology, (9) Abhidharma psychology and phenomenology, (10) the tenets of classical Indian philosophies, (11) advice on worldly wisdom and civility, (12) gate­way for the learned, which includes such diverse fields as linguistics, poetry, and literature, (13) medicine, (14) astronomy and astrology, (15) tales from Tibetan opera, and (16) historical writings.The first of these sixteen categories covers the teachings of Kadam, Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyii, Geluk, Jonang, miscellaneous Buddhist schools, and the Bon school. Texts featured in these volumes have been, on the whole, selected by senior lineage holders of the individual schools. As for other categories, selection of the texts has been based primarily on recog­nition of the historical reality of the development of the individual disci­plines. For example, in the field of epistemology, the works of the Sakya and Geluk schools have been selected, while on the topic of buddha-nature, the writings of Buton Rinchen Drup and Kagyii masters feature with greater prominence. Where there are fields of common interest, such as the presentation of the three codes or the bodhisattva’s altruistic ideal, efforts have been made to include the perspectives of all four major Tibetan Buddhist schools. It is hoped that with the creation of The Library o f Tibetan Classics, a manageable reference library of key classical Tibetan works covering the entire expanse of classical Tibetan knowledge will become available to many libraries, educational and cultural institutions, and interested individuals.This inaugural volume of The Library o f Tibetan Classics expounds on a system of Buddhist thought and practice that exerted great influence in many key areas of classical Tibetan knowledge. Though belonging to the class of Vajrayana Buddhist teaching, the Kalacakra genre of texts also cov­ers such diverse fields as cosmology, astronomy, and astrology, classical numerical system, and medicine and human physiology. Since the princi­pal theme of this volume is the exposition of Kalacakra system of medita­tive practice, many of the practices presented presuppose that the reader has received initiation into the highest yoga tantra.

He was a student of, among others, the First Dalai Lama Gendlin Drup and Taktsang Lotsáwa Sherap Gyaltsen, and later became a principal teacher of the Sec­ond Dalai Lama Gendiin Gyatso. Though belonging to the Geluk school of Tibetan Buddhism, Norsang Gyatso is recognized as a seminal figure in the promotion of a syncretic approach, between the Geluk and Kagyli schools, to the teachings and practices of the Buddhist tradition of mahamudra. Along with Phukpa Lhundrup Gyatso, Norsang Gyatso is also credited with the founding of the highly influential Phuk school of Tibetan astronomy and astrology. Most importandy in the present context, because of his dedication to intensive meditative practice for more than four decades as a “wandering hermit,” moving from one solitary place of retreat to another, Norsang Gyatso came to be revered in Tibet as a great meditator and teacher. Today he is included among the lineage masters of many important practice traditions, including of course the lineage of Kalacakra. Norsang Gyatso died in 1513 at the age of ninety-one.It has truly been a great privilege to be part of this important translation project. I would like first of all to thank His Holiness the Dalai Lama for selecting this important text for inclusion in The Library o f Tibetan Clas­sics. I thank Gavin Kilty for doing such a superb job in translating this monumental text, and to the following individuals and organizations I also owe my sincere thanks: to David Kittelstrom at Wisdom for being such an incisive and dedicated editor; to Gene Smith and the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center for lending crucial Tibetan texts, including a copy of Norsang Gyatso’s text on astrology; to the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath, India, for providing full access to its library to the Tibetan editors who have sourced the numerous citations in Norsang Gyatso’s text; and of course to my wife, Sophie Boyer-Langri, for shouldering the numberless invisible administrative chores that are entailed in a collaborative project such as this. Finally, without the indis­pensable fuel of funding, no amount of dedicated energy could have accomplished a project such as the translation of this volume.

It is tantra because its methodology involves the utilization of the transforma­tive power of the mind focused upon attainable forms of enlightenment to initiate an alchemical process of transmutation. Forms of physical and men­tal enlightenment are mentally imposed upon ordinary external and inter­nal forms to such an extent that, through the power of faith, understanding, and concentration, these visualized enlightened forms are held to actually replace the ordinary phenomena that act as their bases. This practice, when fully developed in the yogi’s mind, is combined with the physiological manipulation of the vajra body2 that will eventually transform the mind, and all that is created by that mind, into the “real thing”— the enlightened mind and form of a buddha.The practice of the Buddhist tantric yogi is built on deep faith and con­viction in those practices and their authenticity. In the eyes of such a prac­titioner, the Kalacakra tantra was first taught by the Buddha himself in the form of the deity Kalacakra. The initial teaching was given in south India in the sacred place of Dhanyakataka from within an initiation mandala formed from the constellations, in which the sun, moon, and the two shadow planets, Rahu and Kalagni,3 were uniquely positioned in the four directions. Prime among the audience of thousands of bodhisattvas and celestial beings was King Sucandra of Shambhala, a fabulous kingdom some­where on this earth where the Kalacakra teachings were held and propa­gated until their appearance in India in the tenth or eleventh century C.E.Sucandra, a manifestation of the bodhisattva Vajrapani, returned to Shambhala and wrote down the teachings in twelve thousand verses. This was the Root Kalacakra Tantra and was known as the Suprem e O riginal"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2 Ornament o f Stainless LightB uddha. From then on he taught the tantra to the inhabitants of Sham- bhala until his death. The lineage was taken up by his descendants and royal successors, who continued his work of spreading the R oot Tantra. About six hundred years after the death of Sucandra, the Shambhala king Manjusrl Yasas compiled an abridgement of the Root Tantra for the bene­fit of the many non-Buddhist adherents in Shambhala. This abridgement is known as the Condensed Kdlacakra Tantra and is the work referred to when the textual term Kdlacakratantra is mentioned. Its commentary, com­posed by Pundarlka, the son and royal heir of Manjus'ri Yasas, is called the Vimalaprabhd or Stainless Light. It is often referred to as the Great Com­mentary. The Root Tantra itself did not survive in its entirety.The “stainless light” in Khedrup Norsang Gyatso’s tide refers to Pundarlka s commentary. O rnament o f Stainless Light is an overview of the five chapters of the tantra and seeks to explain the major points and clarify areas of doubt rather than being an exhaustive commentary. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso was a teacher of Gendlin Gyatso, the Second Dalai Lama (1476-1542), and a dis­ciple of Gendlin Drup, the First Dalai Lama (1391-1474). After extensive study and a four-year retreat, he became well known as a Kalacakra scholar and a proficient astrologer. Gendlin Gyatso praised him as being inseparable from the Shambhala king Manjusrl Yas'as. He was also learned in Sanskrit, poetry, and composition. He composed, in collaboration with Phukpa Lhiindrup Gyatso, the Rundarika Transmission: A Treatise on Astronomy and founded the Phuk tradition upon which Desi Sangyd Gyatso’s W hite Beryl was based. Apart from astronomy he also composed works on the Guhyasamaja tantra and on dependent origination.When the tantra found its way to India in the tenth or eleventh century, it was not always enthusiastically received. This tantra was one of the last tantras to appear in India, and it seemed to contain concepts that were more akin to the non-Buddhist Samkhya and Jain philosophies than that of the Buddhists. Nevertheless it eventually found acceptance and took its place among the other great tantras of India. A succession of great masters, such as Naropa, Kalacakrapada (who some identify with Naropa), Avadhutipa, Abhayakaragupta, and many others, wrote supplementary works to the tantra and succeeded in transmitting the lineage to future generations.4Not long after the tantra arrived in India, it was brought to Tibet by the eleventh-century translator Gyijo Oser, who is widely credited with mak­ing the first Tibetan translation of the Kalacakra. It was eventually translated"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Translator's Introduction 3into Tibetan at least fourteen times, and two main traditions emerged. The Dro tradition was founded upon the translation by Dro Lotsawa, who worked with the Kashmiri Pandit Somanatha in Tibet, and the Ra tradi­tion was begun by Ra Lotsawa (1016-98), who worked with the Indian master Samanthas'ri in Nepal or Kashmir. It seems that the Ra lineage became influential within the dominant Sakya tradition that flourished at those times and thereafter within the Geluk tradition founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), whereas the Dro lineage was predominant in the Jonang tradition that was made prominent by Dolpopa (Sherap Gyaltsen 1292-1361) and others.5The fourteenth century saw the Kalacakra become especially important to both Dolpopa and another highly influential figure, Buton Rinpoche (Rinchen Drup 1290-1364). These two great masters were responsible for popularizing the Kalacakra and cementing its reputation in Tibet. Buton Rinpoche annotated and wrote extensively on the Kalacakra tantra, while Dolpopa ordered a revised translation of the tantra and its commentary, the V im alaprabhal It has been said that Dolpopa was the first master to con­ceive of the idea of giving the Kalacakra initiation as a public event.7 From then on the Kalacakra lineage has not only survived but flourished in Tibet, mainly in the Geluk tradition but also in the Sakya, Kagyli, and Jonang tra­ditions. Although these days there is a tradition of giving, the Kalacakra as a public and unrestricted initiation, this probably wasn’t always the case. There is, however, a record of the Panchen Lama giving the initiation in China in 1932 in a huge thirty-two-foot sand mandala.8The Practice and Philosophy of TantraThe state of mind most suitable for the transformative processes of tantra is a very subtle level of mind called the m in d o f clear light. This is a subtle level of consciousness and not a newborn state of mind developed by prac­tice. It exists therefore within the mental continuum ofevery sentient being but is rarely evident or manifest. It may surface infrequently during life and will appear naturally during the process of dying. The yogi employs completion-stage tantric methods to make manifest this mind of clear light. This involves the manipulation of the vajra body, which mainly involves bringing into the central channel the winds that normally would flow through the left and right channels of the vajra body. The subtle mind of clear light is the best state of mind in which to focus on an understanding"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4 Ornament o f Stainless Lightof emptiness, the ultimate and true nature of all phenomena. This mind of clear light is then developed into the nature of bliss. This bliss is not a heightened form of worldly happiness, nor is it the bliss brought on by sustained meditative concentration alone, but is developed generally from penetrative focusing upon points within the cakras9 of the vajra body and specifically from what are called th z fo u r joys. These four joys arise from the elemental drops, which normally are stationary within the vajra body, mov­ing up and down the central channel. This movement in turn is brought about by practices of union involving a real or imagined consort or from the practice of generating the inner fire.10 Eventually the subtle wind that accompanies the subtle mind is developed into a form resembling the enlightened form that is the goal of practice. This is known as the illusory body. The clear-light mind of bliss and emptiness and the illusory body are a union that develops into the dharmakaya and rupakaya—the mind and form of an enlightened being.In tantra a student must work closely with his or her guru— much closer than in the Perfection or Sutra vehicles. Nowhere is this more true than at the outset of tantric practice during the process of initiation. One can only enter the tantric path through the doorway of such a transmission. The term tantra is often etymologized as “continuum,” and while this contin­uum refers to the unbroken continuum of the primordial or clear-light mind, it may also refer to transmission in the form of an initiation. Dur­ing the initiation ceremony transmission is from the guru to disciple, and it is the guru, therefore, who holds the key to the door of the celestial man­sion housing the deities of the tantra. The disciple needs to request some­one else to confer the initiation ceremony because the nature of the spiritual phenomena to be transmitted is such that an ordinary unenlightened per­son could not do it. For example, because of its nature, the fourth or word initiation can be successfully transmitted by Buddha Vajradhara and no one else. The vajra master conducting the ceremony is therefore under­stood to be Vajradhara in the form of a guru. In the yogic pure view, one­self and one’s immediate environment are viewed through celestial eyes, thus it would be inconsistent if the guru who is responsible for setting the practitioner on the tantric path were not also regarded with the same pure perception. Therefore all the guru’s actions and behavior are understood as being solely for the guidance of the practitioner, regardless of how they might appear. Because of this it is said that there is no act of devotion too great to be performed for the vajra master."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introduction 5W ith initiation the practitioner enters the generation stage, which involves preparing or ripening the mind for the completion stage that fol­lows. The generation stage is essentially a process of pure-view develop­ment powered by meditative concentration, which overrides all habitual and ordinary pretantric perception. Its center of focus is the celestial man­sion and the deities and mandalas housed within it. These are regarded as purifiers or transformers of ordinary existence, which takes the form of our perceived world. In this way the generation stage prepares the mind for the radical procedures of the completion stage.The completion-stage practices make use of the vajra body. The purified and powerfully concentrated mind developed by the generation stage focuses on and penetrates the vajra body at the locations of elemental drops and cakras, thereby causing the winds to travel there. The primary pur­pose of this practice is to bring the winds into the blocked central channel and so make manifest the subtle mind of clear light. This clear-light mind is focused upon emptiness, while the accompanying subtle wind eventually arises in the form of the illusory body.Distinctive Features of the Kalacakra TantraThe Kalacakra follows this general methodology of tantra, although it is unique in some aspects. The Condensed T antra or K alacakratantra has around 1,030 verses arranged in five chapters. These chapters are Realms or External World, Inner, Initiations, Methods of Accomplishment, and Gno­sis. The first chapter discusses the external world— its creation, features, and dimensions. According to the Kalacakra tantra, the external world is cen­tered on Mount Meru surrounded by various lands or continents, with the four elemental mandalas below as a foundation and the planetary and stel­lar systems above. The purpose of this first chapter is an esoteric one in which this external world is regarded as a product of the karma of sentient beings, and its features, therefore, are regarded as suitable phenomena for purification by the practices of the generation and completion stages. The dimensions of this Kalacakra universe correspond perfectly to the enlight­ened phenomena of deity and celestial mandalas that become the purifier or transformer of the world. This is a karmicly created correspondence that is exclusive to those destined to be Kalacakra practitioners. The human body in its dimensions also corresponds to this external environment.The size, shape, color, and general description of a world realm as found"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6 Ornament o f Stainless Lightin Kalacakra differs gready from that described in Abhidharma-based litera­ture. Scholars might say that the reason for these discrepancies is that the Kalacakra literature was probably composed in the latter half of the first mil­lennium somewhere in central Asia and had therefore lost touch with fun­damental tenets of Buddhist cosmology. This could also explain the amount of non-Buddhist Samkhya terminology employed throughout the text. Some Indian scholars of the past attempted a compromise in which some parts of the tantra were deemed to be provisional and other parts definitive.11 Never­theless, the dimensions of the Kalacakra world realm correspond perfectly to the dimensions of the human body and the mandalas of the celestial mansion, and such a correspondence is essential for the Kalacakra practitioner.The Kalacakra is also at great pains to point out that neither the Abhi- dharma nor the Kalacakra presentation of cosmology constitutes the sole truth on the matter to the exclusion of all other presentations, and that it is not necessary to establish such a truth because each presentation suits its own purpose. For this reason, those who try to marry or harmonize Bud­dhist ideas of the cosmos with present-day scientific knowledge could well be pursuing a fruitless task. The differences need not be resolved. The gen- eration-stage practices of corresponding enlightened phenomena to ordi­nary phenomena with a view to transformation indicates a system in which mind developed to its full potential takes precedence over objectively viewed “real” phenomena. This important pillar of Vajrayana thought may explain its emphasis on phenomena being mind-created, particularly its assertion that all things in samsara and nirvana are generally created by the mind, or by the everpresent subtle mind and subtle wind.The purpose of the second or Inner chapter is to present the “person composed of the six elements,” the elements being earth, water, fire, air, gnosis, and space. This person’s ordinary body and vajra body are pre­sented as objects for purification by the corresponding enlightened phe­nomena of the generation-stage mandalas. One of the assertions of the Kalacakra is that there are no phenomena beyond the six elements. This is applicable to bodily phenomena and is also true of the resultant enlightened phenomena, such as the five buddha families. Therefore, an ordinary or “obscured” phenomenon included within the continuum of an ordinary being is transformed into its corresponding enlightened state by the com­pletion stage without ever going beyond its essential elemental identity.It is not only the major constituents of the body that have corresponding enlightened phenomena in the celestial mansion. The process that is the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Translator's Introduction 7very creation and development of a human form is also linked to medita­tive processes occurring in the generation stage. Conception, pregnancy, and birth are therefore described in detail in the Inner chapter.Unique to Kalacakra is its assertion that enlightenment is not attained on the basis of an illusory body developed in the intermediate state, or bardo. According to Khedrup Norsang Gyatso this is because in Kalacakra the primary and substantial basis of an enlightened body is the body of empty fo rm, 12 and this is not achievable in the ordinary state, whereas in other tantras the subtle wind is manifest during death clear light and used as.a basis for the creation of an illusory body. Others say that the Kalacakra completion stage needs a coarse material body for its accomplishment and that such a body is not found in the intermediate state.The bulk of the Inner chapter discusses the channels, winds, and drops of the vajra body. Although the vajra body exists in a subtle state, it is nev­ertheless what is called an obscured phenomenon and is therefore suitable for transformation. Presentations in some parts of the Inner chapter are at odds with those of other tantras. For example, the Guhyasamaja asserts that the crown cakra has thirty-two channel petals and the throat cakra sixteen, while the Kalacakra presents the crown cakra with four petals, the forehead with sixteen, and the throat with thirty-two. However such contradictions are resolved using the same reasoning found in the Realms chapter to explain the discrepancies in the dimensions of a world realm of the Kalacakra and of the Abhidharma. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso points out that ] 6 Tsong- khapa stated that every tantra stands on its own and that its assertions and presentations are definitive and verified as such by those yogis with medi­tative experience. Other differences include the colors, functions, and path­ways of the channels below the navel; the locations, colors, and flow of the winds; the Kalacakra assertion that wind flows through the central channel during the ordinary state; and the functions of the four drops.The third chapter, called Initiations, deals primarily with the seven or eleven initiations conferred on the Kalacakra initiate. It begins with an assessment of the qualities of suitable tantric gurus— vajra masters— and their disciples, followed by stipulations for the type of mandala to be con­structed for the ceremony.The seven childhood initiations are analogous to stages of childhood and by themselves empower the disciple to practice the generation stage and to work for the attainment of worldly powers (siddhi). There is much dis­agreement among Tibetan masters on the functions of the four higher and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8 Ornament o f Stainless Lightfour higher-than-high initiations.13 All agree that they empower the disci­ple to enter the practices of the completion stage and to work for the supreme siddhi of enlightenment. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso argues that the higher-than-high, or nonworldly, fourth initiation must be conferred after the worldly, or higher wisdom-knowledge, third initiation in order to empower the disciple to complete the six-branch yoga that makes up the completion stage, and that the remaining three higher-than-high initia­tions are conferred subsequently.The generation stageThe fourth chapter, called Methods of Accomplishment (Skt. sàdhana:), covers the generation-stage practices of Kalacakra. As with tantras generally, the purpose of the transformative practices of the generation stage in Kalacakra is to ripen or prepare the mind for the advanced practices of the completion stage. This involves the practice of changing ordinary percep­tion into pure view and developing the pride of being the meditational deity, often referred to as d ivine pride. It is not mere visualization of the mandala and the deities. Pure view and divine pride require complete mas­tery over the mind for their full implementation, and so the meditative state known as peaceful abiding (samatha) is necessary. The Kalacakra celes­tial mansion, consisting of body, speech, and mind mandalas and over seven hundred celestial figures, and the corresponding phenomena of the inner and outer worlds are described in this chapter.In the development of pure view, one’s environment is seen as the celes­tial mansion, one’s body as enlightened form, one’s possessions and enjoy­ments as pure bliss, one’s circle as buddhas and bodhisattvas, and one’s activities as enlightened deeds. These are known as the fiv e perfections, and they appear to the mental consciousness and not to the senses. These five perfections are found in actuality in the enlightened state that is the result of Vajrayana practice. Hence, the generation stage is a practice of the result as a cause.Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen14 explains divine pride in the following way. Representations of the self or person that is the subject of the thought “I” can be found in one’s mindstream from beginningless time up to one’s attainment of the state of Buddha Vajradhara. This future-self Vajradhara, the goal of one’s practice, is taken as the subject of divine pride and posited as existing now. Divine pride does not mean thinking “I am a buddha, and that buddha is me as an ordinary being.” Such a perception is distorted in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introduction 9the same way that the perception of a piece of rope as a snake is distorted. W ith this distortion ordinary or habitual perception cannot be trans­formed. Therefore the “I” of the divine pride that thinks “I am the deity” is the “I” of our future enlightened form.Kalacakra generation-stage practice begins from the creation of the protec­tion wheel to guard against interference and moves on to practices corre­sponding to the ordinary processes of dying and being reborn. A meditation on emptiness called the fo u r gateways to freedom corresponds to actual death. Following this is a practice known as the emanation of the sovereign m an- dala, which corresponds to the formation of the body in the womb. This involves creating the external elemental mandalas, on top of which is placed the celestial mansion. This corresponds to the formation of the external world and to the mother’s womb. This is followed by the formation of the Kalacakra deities within the mansion, corresponding to the month-by- month development in the womb. O f the four branches of the generation stage, this initial practice is known as the branch of approximation and cor­responds to a resultant state of enlightenment known as body vajra.The second branch of the generation stage corresponds to ordinary birth and is known as the branch of near accomplishment or as the m editation on the sovereign activities, corresponding to the resultant state of enlightenment known as speech vajra. This involves a meditation called arousing by song, in which Kalacakra and consort are aroused from their blissful state by the songs of four goddesses. This process corresponds to the movement of the four winds within the mother’s womb that encourage the child to move into the outside world. After the deity and consort have awoken into the world, the mandalas are emanated again. Deities known as wisdom b e in g are sum­moned and merge with mandala and assembly to become the samaya m an- dala. These activities correspond to the child’s first engagement with the outside world through the medium of the senses, which is brought on by the movement of the winds. The second branch of the generation stage concludes with the meditations known as sealing, in which the principal deities of the mandala are sealed or marked with various syllables to indi­cate their family or clan. This is followed by meditations involving blessings of body, speech, and mind and a purity meditation in which each enlight­ened feature of the mandala is identified with an ordinary phenomenon.The third branch of the generation stage is that of accomplishment or drop yoga and corresponds to the resultant m in d vajra and to the ordinary process of the development of seminal fluid up to the age of sixteen. The"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"io Ornament o f Stainless Lightfourth branch is that of great accomplishment or subtle yoga and corresponds to the resultant gnosis vajra and to the halt in the growth of seminal fluid at the age of sixteen. These two practices involve the simulation of the completion-stage practice of moving the elemental drops of the vajra body through the central channel to induce the four joys. These require the use of an imagined or actual consort and are ripening processes for similar prac­tices performed during the completion stage.The com pletion stageThe Kalacakra generation stage is also known as contrived yoga and concep­tually created yoga. Its practices involve the development of mentally con­trived creations together with the recitation of mantras. This is the meaning of conceptual in this context. The completion stage is nonconceptual in the sense that such mental construction is no longer necessary. Empty-form deities and signs arise naturally within the clear-light mind of their own volition, like the images seen in a clairvoyant’s mirror.15The completion stage of highest yoga tantra is usually defined by its accomplishment of having induced the winds that normally flow through the two side channels to enter the central channel. According to Khedrup Norsang Gyatso all six yogas of the six-branched yoga that make up the completion stage fulfill that definition. However some commentators say that the practices of the first two yogas, withdrawal and meditative absorp­tion, merely prepare the winds of the left and right channels for entry into the central channel by making them more pliable, and that they do not properly enter the central channel until the third yoga.The Kalacakra completion stage is taught in the Condensed Tantra in the fifth chapter, called Gnosis (Skt. jn a n d ). The six-branched yoga already mentioned is not die same as the six yogas of Naropa nor is it identical to the similarly named six-branched yoga taught in the Later Guhyasamaja. Like the generation stage before it, the practices of the completion stage are divided among the four branches of approximation, near accomplishment, accomplishment, and great accomplishment. The first four yogas are grouped in pairs, so that withdrawal and meditative absorption comprise approximation, and the third and fourth yogas, pranayama and retention, make up near accomplishment. The fifth yoga, recollection, is accomplish­ment, and the last yoga, meditative concentration, is great accomplishment. These four categories also correspond to the four vajras mentioned above, the body, speech, mind, and gnosis vajras. There are no intervening stages"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introduction nor practices between the complete accomplishment of the six yogas of the completion stage and the enlightenment that is the state of Vajradhara.In the first yoga, withdrawal, the winds of the left and right channels are initially induced into the central channel. This purifies the central channel and prepares it for the subsequent yogas. Withdrawal is practiced by fol­lowing a strict and ascetic meditational procedure in a blacked-out room without a trace of light for the night yoga and under the open skies for the day yoga. The discipline of this yoga includes a strict and carefully posi­tioned bodily posture, a particular gaze of the eyes, and a mental placement focused on the central channel’s upper opening, which is situated between the eyebrows. These practices bring the winds into the central channel for the first time, and the clear-light mind is made manifest. This activation of the clear-light mind is indicated by the empty-form appearance of ten signs, including such things as smoke and a mirage, which themselves are reflec­tions or images of the clear-light mind. These empty-form appearances are held and stabilized by the second yoga, meditative absorption.The term w ithdraw al refers to the withdrawal of the five senses from their external objects to be replaced by celestial senses developed by the mental consciousness. This differs from the withdrawal yoga of the Guhyasamaja tradition, where the senses withdraw into their objects to be enjoyed as expressions of bliss and emptiness.In the first two yogas, the clear-light mind is made manifest and merges indivisibly with the empty forms, particularly the empty-form appearance of Kalacakra and his consort. These two yogas are known as body vajra meditations and bear some resemblance to the completion-stage practice of the Guhyasamaja tradition known as body isolation, in which phenomena are isolated from ordinary perception and appear as expressions of bliss and emptiness. In the first two yogas of Kalacakra completion stage, phe­nomena are severed from the senses and are perceived by celestial and clair­voyant senses.The function of the third yoga, pranayama,16 is to bring the winds fully into the central channel and to block off the left and right channels. The implementation of pranayama consists essentially of two practices known as vajra recitation and vase yoga. Vajra recitation involves a process where the innate tones of the incoming and outgoing breaths traveling through the central channel are identified with mantra syllables. In the practice of vase yoga, the upper and lower winds of the vajra body are brought to a point at the navel where they unite as a vase-shaped sphere. Due to this"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12 Ornament o f Stainless Lightconcentration of mind and winds at the navel, the empty form figure of Kalacakra appears effortlessly at the navel. The yogi focuses on this empty- form deity with a clear-light mind and merges with it to generate the divine pride of being Kalacakra. The vase-yoga concentration of the winds at the navel is the inner cause for the blazing of the inner fire, which melts the ele­mental drops, also known as bodhicitta, which fall and rise again through the central channel to create the four joys. The bliss of the four joys is used to meditate on the emptiness that is the ultimate truth of phenomena, known in Kalacakra as nonaspected emptiness.The fourth yoga, retention, retains the winds in the central channel and brings them into the drops that reside at the cakras along the central chan­nel. Pranayama and retention are speech vajra meditations, and in the Guhyasamaja tradition vase yoga and vajra recitation are identified as speech isolation practices.The fifth yoga of the six-branched yoga, recollection, is so called because the empty-form Kalacakra with consort Visvamata that arose during the appearance of the signs in withdrawal yoga is now recalled and develops into an actual phenomenon rather than a mere appearance. The yogi ignites the inner fire and generates the bliss of the four joys by way of vase yoga or by relying on two types of consort. The clear-light mind develops into that bliss, and the yogi focuses on and merges with this empty-form Kalacakra as an actual phenomenon. This is known as the recollection body, and the empty-form consort Visvamata is the m aham udra consort. Desire for this mahamudra consort leads to the final yoga and the creation of the highest form of bliss in Kalacakra, unchanging bliss.The sixth yoga is meditative concentration. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso describes meditative concentration as:A gnosis that is the indivisibility of an unchanging great-bliss consciousness and the object of that consciousness, an empty form endowed with supreme characteristics that has the power to transform all aggregates, sources, and elements into nonobscured phenomena, as quicksilver transforms base metal into gold.17This describes a union with the mahamudra consort that brings about a stacked arrangement of 21,600 bodhicitta drops in the central channel. These create a similar number of instances of unchanging bliss, which in"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Translator’s Introduction 13turn consume proportionate parts of the material body and gradually trans­form it into the empty-form body of Kalacakra. At the same time, each of the 21,600 instances of bliss destroys its share of the perception that holds to the true existence of phenomena. The result is the enlightened union of an unchanging bliss consciousness one-pointedly focused upon ultimate truth, emptiness, and united inseparably with an empty-form, rainbow­like, and obscuration-free Kalacakra and consort known as Kalacakra in m other-and-father embrace. No other tantra employs this methodology for its final transformation into enlightenment.A major difference between the Kalacakra and other tantras involves the creation of two bases or foundations that through meditational develop­ment will transform into the enlightened mind and enlightened form. All Buddhist paths of sutra and tantra are paths of cause and effect in the sense that attainments along these paths are reached by creating their proper causes within the mindstream of the practitioner. Although tantra udlizes the result as the path, it is still subject to the law of cause and effect. Therefore the completion stage must generate causal phenomena that will develop into enlightened results. For the enlightened mind or dharmakaya, this comple­tion-stage causal phenomenon is the subtle clear-light mind developed into the nature of bliss and focused single-pointedly upon emptiness. This sub­tle state of mind exists unmanifest in all sentient beings, and therefore all beings possess the innate cause of the dharmakaya. The Kalacakra, in agree­ment with other tantras, accepts this subtle mind as the cause of the dhar­makaya. However it differs from other tantras on the causes that develop into the rupakaya, or enlightened form in the aspect of the deity of the tantra. It is the yogi’s identification with an empty-form Kalacakra that is the basis and cause for his future enlightened form in the aspect of Kalacakra. Other highest yoga tantras present an illusory body developed from the sub- de or primordial wind that acts as a mount for the primordial clear-light mind as the basis for the future enlightened form of the yogi. In Kalacakra, therefore, empty form as a product or reflection of the subde clear-light mind is the basis for the development of both dharmakaya and rupakaya. In Kalacakra literature the subtle or primordial wind is not mentioned at all.The Jonang TraditionThe practice and philosophical interpretation of Kalacakra will normally fol­low the philosophical tenets of the tradition or lineage into which it has been"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14 Ornament o f Stainless Lighttransmitted. The Geluk tradition founded by Jé Tsongkhapa, for example, will interpret Kalacakra philosophy, especially as regards emptiness or ulti­mate truth, in the light of the Middle Way philosophy of the great Indian masters Nàgàrjuna and Candraklrti. However, in the case of the Jonang tra­dition, the Kalacakra literature itself informed this particular tradition’s tenets.18 Under the leadership of Dôlpopa Sherap Gyaltsen, Jonang Monastery in the Jonang region of Tsang in central Tibet became the cen­ter of a new and radical philosophy conceived from the Kalacakra literature.Many sutras, tantras, and Indian treatises talk of a phenomenon existing innately in all beings that is pure of all defilement, untouched by desire, anger, and ignorance, and that is the very essence of our being. Sutra descrip­tions of this phenomenon are found, for example, in the Lankâvatârasütra, which belongs to the Buddha’s third turning of the wheel of the teachings. In Indian commentaries such as the Uttaratantra by Maitreya, it is referred to the as buddha nature or buddha essence (tathâgatâgarbha) and is likened to a gold statue covered in filthy rags, and to gold lying hidden in a poor man’s garden. Highest yoga tantras such as the Hevajra tantra talk of the innate and the primordial existing within. The Kalacakra literature talks of empty-form images, which arise of their own volition, uncreated by mind, like images arising in a clairvoyant’s mirror. The highest of these images is the empty-form Kalacakra and consort that arise in the completion stage.Dôlpopa asserted that this Kalacakra mahâmudrà empty form is the tantric form of the buddha essence taught in the third turning of the wheel of the teachings and that the path of revealing and developing it is the path to enlightenment as taught in the Kalacakra. This buddha essence was held to be ultimate reality, and became known as shentong, “emptiness of other” or “extrinsic emptiness.” This was in direct opposition to the ultimate truth referred to as rangtong, “emptiness of self’ or “intrinsic emptiness,” that was propagated by the Geluk and Sakya traditions. According to the Jonang tra­dition, ultimate-truth emptiness is shentong because it is empty of all other conventional and false phenomena. It is not rangtong because it truly exists and is not empty of itself. All phenomena other than shentong must be rangtong because they are false and only imputed by mind. Even the empti­ness taught in the perfection of wisdom sutras of the second turning, which was propagated by Indian masters such as Nàgàruna as being the definitive Middle Way philosophy, is not the ultimate emptiness because it is devoid of characteristics or features and is therefore without essence, whereas shen­tong itself is known as the Great M id d le Way. Therefore, in sutra the third"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Translator's Introduction 15turning of the wheel was the definitive turning, and the second provisional and in need of interpretation. In tantra, shentong is apotheosized as the meditational deities, in particular Kalacakra and his consort.Much of the rangtong-shentong debate centers on the meaning of the Kalacakra term empty fo rm or emptiness fo r m, which is linguistically close to the term emptiness, and used as a synonym of ultimate truth. Khedrup Nor- sang Gyatso, and the Geluk rangtong tantra tradition in general, say that in Kalacakra literature the term emptiness sometimes refers to conventional- truth empty form and not always to ultimate-truth emptiness. U nited w ith emptiness or embracing emptiness may at times refer to the conventional phenomenon of union with the empty-form mahamudra consort rather than ultimate-truth emptiness. Therefore, they discern two kinds of empti­ness in the Kalacakra: ultimate-truth emptiness, or nonaspected emptiness, and empty-form emptiness, or aspected emptiness. Some commentators say therefore that the emptiness in the term bliss a n d emptiness, when found in Kalacakra literature, refers to the empty-form mahamudra consort. This is because union in Kalacakra, both on the path and in the enlightened state, refers to the clear-light mind in the nature of bliss merged with empty form. However, this does not mean the ultimate-truth emptiness as taught in the sutras by the second turning and by Nágárjuna has no place in Kalacakra, because the focus of the bliss in bliss a n d emptiness is on ultimate truth or nonaspected emptiness. Therefore Khedrup Norsang Gyatso explains aspected emptiness as a conventional-truth empty form, such as the mahamudra consort endowed with every feature of enlightenment, and nonaspected emptiness as being the ultimate truth arrived at through ana­lytical investigation of the aggregates.Opponents of the shentong view also say that shentong philosophy is redolent of early Indian Vedanta and Samkhya non-Buddhist philosophies, with their concepts of an all-pervading, indivisible, and causeless phe­nomenon that represents a final and truly existent reality and that exists as a findable phenomenon separate from conventional appearance. This is the same charge that had been leveled at the Kalacakra tantra itself by its Indian and Tibetan opponents. Kalacakra s rather radical approach to the path of mantra, its leanings toward Samkhya terminology, its presentation of empty form, the attainment of enlightenment by way of the 21,600 instances of bliss, the omission of any reference to an illusory body formed from the subde winds, and differences with the Abhidharma on dimensions of the universe, all contribute to make the Kalacakra a unique tantra. Masters"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"i6 Ornament o f Stainless Lightsuch as Chomden Rikral (thirteenth century) and even the great Rendawa (1349-1412), teacher of ]€ Tsongkhapa, claimed that the Kalacakra was not a pure tantra. Rendawa wrote a series of letters setting out his criticisms, which in turn provoked replies from adherents of the tantra. Many of these points of criticism are dealt with in Khedrup Norsang Gyatso’s work.19The Astronomy of the KalacakraAstronomy as employed exoterically in the Kalacakra is the science of cal­culating planetary and stellar movement in order to provide a measurement of time through the medium of calendars. It is not to be confused with astrology as the term is used these days. Predictive systems that relied upon the movements of the planets or an examination of the elements do exist in Tibetan astrology, but these were not the prime concern of the Kalacakra. A famous maxim of the Kalacakra runs, “as without so within.” This means that the outside world is mirrored within the inner world of sentient beings. It also means that the practices of the two stages make dynamic use of this outer world mirrored within. The esoteric purpose, therefore, of the Kalacakra practitioner becoming well versed in astronomy is to be able to correspond external planetary and stellar movement with internal processes in his own vajra body as part of completion-stage practices.Tibetan masters of Kalacakra posit two systems of astronomy— siddhanta and karana. The former is said to be the true system of the Kalacakra Root Tantra and the latter a system in accord with general non- Buddhist astronomy that was adopted by King Manjus'ri Yas'as when con­verting the Brahmin sages (rsi) and compiling the Condensed T a n tra T According to tradition the “barbarians” who arrived eight hundred years after the compilation of the Condensed Tantra hid the true or siddhanta astronomy and replaced it with a flawed karana system. It wasn’t until the eleventh Kalkl king of Shambhala, Aja, reformed the karana system in 806 c.e. that it became acceptable.When the Kalacakra tantra arrived in Tibet, its astronomy, like the rest of its cosmology, was not immediately popular because of the suspicion that Kalacakra was not a true Buddhist tantra. Astronomy and astrology had been present in Tibet for many years, some of it indigenous, some of it from China. Moreover, astronomy had been taught in other sutras and tantras such as the Vajra D aka Tantra and the Sutra o f the Twelve Eyes. However, when Buton Rinpoche and Dolpopa popularized Kalacakra,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"TransLator’s Introduction 17they popularized its system of astronomy as well. The Third Karmarpa, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339), gave the Kalacakra initiation to the king of Hor and composed the Compendium o f 'Astronomy in 1312. This became the first Tibetan astronomy manual. Buton Rinpoche composed his Treatise on Astronomy: A D elight fo r Scholars, and Khedrup ]€ wrote his voluminous Illu m in a tin g Reality. Since those times Kalacakra astronomy has formed the basis for all subsequent development in the calculations of the sixty-year cycle, lunar months, years, equinoxes, eclipses, and so on of the Tibetan calendar.Even though Tibetan systems of astronomy were independent enough to have individual identities, their root reference was always the Kdlacakratantra. Two main traditions of astronomy flourished for many years in Tibet. Tsurphu Jamyang Chenpo Dondrup was a follower of Rangjung Dorj£ and established a scriptural tradition of astronomy that was commentated on by Trinlepa Chokld Namgyal and Tsuklak Trengwa (1504-65). This became the Tsur tradition. Khedrup Norsang Gyatso and Phukpa Lhiindrup Gyatso compiled the P undarika Transmission: A Trea­tise on Astronomy, which was taken up by Samgyal and others to become the Phuk tradition. In 1681 Minling Lochen Dharma Sri (1651-1718) composed his L ig h t o f the Sun: A Treatise on Astronom y, and Desi Sangye Gyatso (1653-1704) composed his W hite Beryl in 1687. These two works consoli­dated the Phuk tradition as the major system in Tibet. In the eighteenth century Sumpa Yeshe Paljor (1709-88) founded the New Geden tradition, which superceded the Phuk tradition.21AcknowledgmentsNot being well versed in Kalacakra and in tantra in general, I needed help in many areas of the text.

How the Buddha taught the Kalacakra Root Tantra2. Compilation of the Tantra3. How the Root Tantra and the Condensed Tantra were taught by the dharma kings and the Kalki1 kings of ShambhalaHow the Buddha taught the Kalacakra Root TantraOur teacher, Sakyamuni Buddha, actualized complete enlightenment in the noble country of India under the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya and turned the wheels of dharma by teaching the perfections, particularly the perfec­tion of wisdom, upon Vulture’s Peak. He traveled to the great stupa of Dhanyakataka near Srlparvata in southern India. Inside the stupa he emanated the mighty dharmadhatu speech mandala below and the glori­ous constellation mandala above.In this perfect place, a place of great bliss, he sat upon a vajra lion throne in the great Vajradhatu mandala. There this perfect teacher, the lion of the Sakya, entered the meditative concentration upon Kalacakra and became the master of the mandala. Surrounding him was the perfect mandala entourage of buddhas, [5] bodhisattvas, wrathful protectors, gods, nagas, and goddesses, as well as the entourage of the tantra requestor, King Sucandra, an emanation of Vajrapani, who had traveled by miraculous powers from the kingdom of Shambhala. By requesting the tantra an audience gathered, consisting of the ninety-six kings of the ninety-six lands of Shambhala, many bodhisattvas, and countless fortu­nate gods and asura. There the perfect dharma of worldly and nonworldly initiations, followed by prophecies of enlightenment and the Twelve T housand Kalacakra Root Tantra was taught. Here “twelve thousand”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 27refers to the number of verses. In the Realms chapter of the Great Com­mentary, in the second summary it says:“Twelve thousand” refers to a collection of 384,000 syllables, which comprise 12,000 thirty-two-syllable anustubh verses, and this is the Twelve Thousand Tantra.1As this quote explains, a verse in anustubh meter consists of lines of eight syllables. Although the tantra taught in the Dhanyakataka stupa was the Kalacakra Root Tantra, it is the assertion of the Kalacakra and its com­mentaries that every highest yoga tantra was being taught. The Later Kalacakra Tantra says:By the teaching of the Twelve Thousand in the dharmadhatu of Dhanyakataka, all tantras of the Buddha were taught.3This can also be known from the Suryas'ri’s Drops o f Nectar:In the great and regal stupa of Dhanyakataka, the conquering Buddha, the lion of the Sakya, was supplicated by those who wished to hear various tantras. There on the full moon of the middle spring month, in the form of the primordial buddha, he emanated the dharmadhatu speech mandala and the glorious constellation mandala above. There on that very day gods and others were initiated by the Buddha and taught extensively and in condensed form all the systems of secret mantra.4But when did our teacher teach the Root Tantra, and what are the dates of the Buddha? [6] This should be explained in detail. The words of the Root Tantra, “Six hundred years from this year” are explained by the Great Com­m entary in the ninth summary from the Realms chapter:This is the year the Tathagata taught the dharma. It was proph- esized that six hundred years after that year the great Manjus'ri Yas'as would surely appear in the land known as Shambhala, north of the Slta River.5Therefore, approximately six hundred years after the Buddha taught the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28 IntroductionRoot Tantra, the Kalkl king Manjus'ri Yas'as appeared. The Great Com ­mentary in the third summary from the Realms chapter says:Manjus'ri became King Yas'as and from the bodhisattva lion throne he taught the dharma for a hundred years.6Therefore, adding the hundred years of Manjusrl Yasas to the previous six hundred since the time of the Buddha totals seven hundred years. The Great Commentary in the ninth summary from the Realms chapter states:“Naga hundred years from then” means that “naga, or eight, hundred years from the time of Ya^as’s” passing, “definitely,” meaning without doubt, the dharma of the barbarians will enter the land of Makha.7Adding the above seven hundred years to these eight hundred years between death of Manjusrl Yas'as and the coming of the barbarians totals one thousand five hundred years. Adding fire, sky, and ocean8 years to the above makes 1,903 years. Therefore, from the time of the Buddha teaching the Root Tantra, up to the end of the 221 years of astronomy,91,903 years elapsed.The Condensed Tantra states, “The past years of prabhava10 and so forth are to be added.” The last of the 1,903 years, or the last year of the 221 years of astronomy, is established as the ksaya Fire Tiger year.11 Dividing 1,903 by sixty and working backward from Fire Tiger year in sixty-year cycles leaves a partial cycle of forty-three years. The first year of that forty-three, count­ing backward from the Fire Tiger year is the tarana male W ood Monkey year. Therefore, that year is the first year of the 1,903, working backward from the last year [7] of the two 221 years of astronomy. It is also the first year of the six hundred years mentioned in the prophecy, “After six hun­dred years Manjus'ri Yas'as will appear.” Six hundred years is an approxi­mation because between the teaching of the Root Tantra and the beginning of the six hundred years, King Sucandra compiled the Root Tantra and composed a commentary. This would have involved one or two years. Flow many years exactly? The Great Commentary, in the third summary, says:With the ascertainment of the tathagata, the twelve-thousand- verse king of tantras and the extensive commentary of sixty"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 29thousand verses were written down in the languages of Sham­bhala and other lands and were taught by King Sucandra to those who lived in the many towns of the ninety-six lands. This teaching was heard and read by those with faith. They com­mitted it to memory and taught it extensively to others. In the second year of teaching of the tantra, in order to create the causes for powerful attainments in others, he displayed the man- dalas and magical creations, then entered the sambhogakaya enjoyment body, source of the nirmanakaya emanated body.12This quote explains that in the second year of his teaching the Root Tantra and the extensive commentary Sucandra passed away. This year counts as the year of his passing. Before that, compiling the Root Tantra, composing the sixty-thousand-verse Extensive Com m entary, and so forth took two years. Therefore, from the time of Sucandra first teaching the Root Tantra and commentary until he passed away, three years must have elapsed. In the “easy to understand” verses from the Realms chapter, it says:In Kalapa, of the land known as Shambhala, glorious king, for some days you were the lord of men, supreme among gods, before returning to your abode.13“Some days” is often explained as meaning three years and three fort­nights,14 and the phrase “some days” in this quote is no exception. The three years of Sucandra are not included in the six hundred years because in the Great Commentary, immediately after the words “he entered into the sambhogakaya enjoyment body, source of the nirmanakaya emanated body,” it says:Then Sures'vara taught the tantra for a hundred years, as did Tejl, Somadatta, [8] Suresvara, Visvamurti, and Sures'ana.15Thus, the six kings each taught for a hundred years. Therefore, the three years of Sucandra and the year the Buddha taught the Root Tantra account for four years not included in the six hundred, and so in the quote that states that Manjusrl Yas'as will appear six hundred years after the teaching of the Tantra, the six hundred years are an approximation. Therefore, the actual first year of the six hundred years mentioned in the prophecy of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30 IntroductionKing Manjus'ri Yasas would be four years before W ood Monkey year.16 This is Iron Dragon year and in this year on the full moon of the Caitra month the Buddha taught the Root Tantra. In the Gnosis chapter of the Great Commentary, in the Supreme Unchanging Gnosis summary, it says:Six hundred years after I have passed away, in the land of Sham- bhala, from the womb of VijayadevI of Sakya lineage, Manjus'ri as Kalkl Mafijus'rl Yas'as, son of Suresana will appear.17The passage also states that Manjus'ri Yas'as will appear six hundred years after our teacher taught the Root Tantra. Therefore, the Root T antra was taught in the year of Buddha’s passing.18 This means that the vikram a Iron Dragon year was the year in which our teacher taught the Root Tantra and was also the year in which he passed away. From his birth our teacher stayed for eighty years and in his eighty-first year on the full moon of Vaisakha, he passed away. His eightieth year was p ra m a th i Earth Rabbit year and, counting backward from that year, the forty-sixth year is ja ya Wood Horse year, and that is the year of our teacher’s enlightenment. Using the same method, counting back from p ra m a th i Earth Rabbit year, the eightieth year is rudra Iron Monkey year, which establishes it as the year of our teacher’s birth. Moreover, in the Abhiniskram anasutra it says:The bodhisattva turned twenty-nine, left the palace, and for six years practiced austerity. After that, it is known that he came to actualize the nectar of immortality.19Counting forward from Iron Monkey year, the twenty-ninth year is sar- vadhara male Earth Rat and that is the year of leaving the palace. Six years on from that year is ja ya Wood Horse year, and that year is the forty-sixth year counting back from p ra m a th i Earth Rabbit year. Therefore, in the Vais'akha of Wood Horse year, the last of the spring months, on the full moon, in the last period of the night, at the onset of dawn, close to the beat­ing of the drum, he became a complete and perfect buddha. [9] The Lalita- vistarasutra says:Monks, in that way, the bodhisattva in the third part of the night, as dawn approached, close to the time of the beating of the drum ...20"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 31In the first summary of the Initiation chapter from the Great Commentary it also explains that he became a buddha during Vais'akha at the approach of dawn:As dawn approached on the full moon of the vaisdkha month, the conqueror, the mighty one of the Sákya, became a complete buddha. He turned the wheels of dharma and taught the three vehicles. Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon in Sri Dhányakataka...21This Vais'akha full moon corresponds perfectly to the Vais'akha full moon of the ja y a Wood Horse year, fifty years22 before the Water Sheep year, which is the year preceding the Wood Monkey year, the first year of the prophesied six hundred years, because of the following reasons. On the basis of the k a r a n ď epoch data24 that appeared at the end of the 221 years of astronomy and accepted as correct by all astrologers except for those of the Pundarika Transmission and the E lim ination o f Error Tradition,25 cal­culating backward shows that on the full moon of that Vaisákha, the plan­etary day was day one26 and was forty hours old. The moon’s lunar mansion was sixteen and one hour.27 The lunar mansion position of the face of Ráhu was sixteen and twenty-nine hours.Using siddhanta astronomy epoch data from the P undarika Transmis­sion, the planetary day was day one and thirty-eight hours. The moon’s lunar mansion was sixteen exactly, and the face of Rahu was also sixteen and twenty-nine hours.Therefore, the claim that on the day the conqueror became a Buddha, at dawn the moon was held by Ráhu28 is confirmed. How is such a claim made? A Vinaya passage states:When the Conqueror attained the highest wisdom, Yas'odhara gave birth to a son, and the moon was held by Ráhu.Also:When he was born the moon was held by Ráhu. Therefore, the child’s name was also Ráhula.29In the Abhiniskram anasutra it says:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"32 IntroductionTo King Suddhodana, his people said, “Please the gods! The prince has attained the highest wisdom!” When that was heard, and on that very day, a son was born to Yas'odhara and a son was born to Amrtodana. O n that day also, the moon was held by Rahu.30[10] If our teacher taught the Root Tantra when he was close to passing away, doesn’t this contradict the quote “Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon...?” Doesn’t this line from the commentary explain that our teacher attained complete enlightenment on the Vais'akha full moon and on the Caitra full moon of the following year he taught the Root Tantra? To avoid any contradiction that might arise on this point, the omniscient dharma master Buton and his followers hold that the quote “Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon” and the prophecy that six hundred years after the Buddha passed away Manjus'rl Yas'as would appear are both valid, and assert that our teacher taught the Root Tantra in the second year of his enlightenment. They present many reasons why the two commentary quotes are not contradictory. The Jonang dharma master Chogl£ Namgyal31 and his followers say that the quote beginning “Six hun­dred years after I have passed away...” is merely a note in the margins of the Indian text and therefore is invalid. The Jonang followers assert that our teacher taught the Root Tantra in the second year of his enlightenment.Such claims can be understood as being wrong. If they were correct, then consider diis. When our Teacher attained complete enlightenment it was the full moon night of Vais'akha, and the moon was held by Rahu, the sutra ref­erence of which has been explained previously. According to the above claims, the first year of the six hundred years mentioned in the prophecy concerning the coming of Manjus'rl Ya£as would have been the male tarana Wood Monkey year.32 Therefore, the preceding years would have been Water Sheep, Water Horse, Iron Snake, Iron Dragon, Earth Rabbit, and Earth Tiger. The following years would have been Wood Bird and so forth. If the above assertions were correct, then in one of those years, on the full moon of Vais'akha there would have been an eclipse. However, the charts establish that there was no eclipse on the full moon of Vais'akha of any of those years. This is because if a reverse calculation is made using karana epoch data that arose after the 221 years of astronomy and accepted as being authentic during the dme of karana astronomy by all astrologers (except the E lim ination o f Error Tradition), then for none of those years is it possible"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 33to construct a chart in which Rahu eclipses the full moon night of Vais'akha. However, the Great Commentary says:As dawn approached on the full moon of Vaisakha, the Con­queror, the mighty one of the Sakya, became a complete bud- dha. He turned the wheels of dharma and [11] taught the three vehicles. Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon in Sri Dhanyakataka.. .33Doesn’t this indicate that the Root Tantra was taught in the second com­plete year of his enlightenment on the full moon of Caitra? Such a con­clusion arises from holding Caitra always to be the first month in the Kalacakra tradition and Phalguna as always being the twelfth. The reality is that, in Kalacakra thinking, months are formed by being either “waxing- led” or “waning-led.”34 O n the basis of being waxing-led, Caitra is the first of the months and Phalguna is the twelfth. On the basis of being waning- led, Vais'akha is the first of the months and Caitra is the twelfth. The rea­sons for designating months in this way is as follows. In Kalacakra thinking the beginning of the seasons is established by the sun entering Aries at the spring equinox during either the waxing or waning phases of the moon. The mean sun entering Aries will appear between the first lunar day and the empty-sky lunar day35 of a waxing-led Caitra. When this mean sun appears between the first and the fifteenth of the month, Aries, as the beginning of the seasons, is assigned to waxing-led Caitra. When the mean sun entering Aries appears between the sixteenth lunar day and the empty-sky lunar day, Aries as the beginning of the season is assigned to a waning-led Vais'akha month. In this case Vais'akha is the first month and Caitra is the twelfth. In the Realms chapter, in the ninth summary, it says:In this continent, south of Meru, when the sun dwells in Aries, it is Vais'akha in the season of spring.36Generally, months were designated this way. Therefore, “Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon,” from the quote above, is made on the basis of a waning-led Vais'akha as the first month and Caitra as the twelfth month. The line “Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full .moon” and so on is commentary to “The end of Caitra is at the time of waxing,” and so forth. “The end of Caitra” and so forth explains the full"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"34 Introductionmoon of Caitra as being the end of the Caitra month. Immediately before the quote “Then in the twelfth month on the Caitra full moon” is the passage: [12]Here in India after the last of the fifteen days of the bright side begins the first day of the dark side. Therefore, as dawn approached on the full moon of Vais'akha, the Conqueror, the mighty one of the Sakya, became a complete buddha.”This indicates that the end of the full moon of Caitra, which begins the days of waning, is the beginning of Vaisakha and is the first month of the year. The quote beginning “Manjus'rl also, six hundred years after I have passed away” can therefore be left as it is, and the above commentary quotes are freed of contradiction.37 Therefore, as asserted by those of the earlier tra­ditions of Ra and Dro, by Palden Lama Dampa,38 and as explained by the Pundarika Transmission, the explanation that the Conqueror taught the Root Tantra on the full moon of Caitra as he approached his passing away can be seen to be correct.To summarize, the focus of the doubts is whether our teacher taught the Root Tantra in the year in which he passed away or in the year following his enlightenment. If the second year of his enlightenment is posited as the year he taught the Root Tantra., an eclipse of the moon on the night of the full moon of Vaisakha at the time of his enlightenment cannot in any way be constructed in the charts. Some (such as Jamyang Chogon)39 have con­structed a chart showing an eclipse on the full moon of Vais'akha of the visva Water Horse year just before the beginning of the prophesied six hun­dred years. This is a reverse calculation using karana astronomy, but within this particular method of calculation there are many quantitative faults regarding the sun and the planets in the 1,682 years,40 and so it is not valid.Some (such as Chogyal Jangpa)41 have formulated an eclipse of the full moon in Vais'akha of the vyaya Iron Snake year occurring in daytime. The way the chart was constructed is correct, but there is no terminology for Rahu grasping the moon in the daytime. Moreover, the quote from the Abhiniskram anasutra says:To King Suddhodana, his people said, “Please the gods! The prince has attained the highest wisdom!” When that was heard, and on that very day, a son was born to Yas'odhara and a son was"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 35born to Amrtodana. On that day also, the moon was held by Ràhu.42This passage speaks as if the moon being held by Râhu was actually seen by those around King Suddhodana. Concerning the phrase, “on that day,” the calculation of one complete day is referred to as the “calculation of a day.” Similarly, it is the complete day within which the eclipse occurred that is spoken of in the phrase “on that day.” [13]Therefore, our teacher taught the Root Tantra on the full moon of Caitra just before he passed away. The time of his passing is established as being the final part of the Vais'âkha full moon of vikram a Iron Dragon year. Eighty-one years back from that year is the Iron Monkey year and is estab­lished as the year of our teacher’s birth. The month, the date, and plane­tary positions can be known by a thorough study of the P undarika Transmission.Compilation of the TantraThis has two outlines:1. Compilation of the Root Tantra2.

King Sucandra memorized the text and returned to Sham­bhala. After our teacher passed away, he wrote down the Root Tantra as well as his own composition, the sixty-thousand-verse Extensive Commentary, in the language of Shambhala.

Having com­pleted his teachings in the Water Horse year, in the following Water Sheep year he created the Kalacakra mandala in order to bring about the causes of siddhi in others. There he displayed magical powers and passed away.Where was this mandala created, and how was it created? South of the city of Kalapa is the park of Malaya, twelve yojana across and of the same size as Kalapa. There in its the center, built entirely of the five precious stones whose nature was that of gods and goddesses, stood the body man­dala with four sides and four entrances. It was four hundred cubits wide, adorned by four portals and the eight cemeteries, enclosed by five walls, sur­rounded by the four mandala environments of earth and so forth and encir­cled by the vajra garland. [14]Within the body mandala and of half its size was the speech mandala with four sides and four entrances, adorned by four portals and enclosed by five walls. In the center of the speech mandala and of half its size again was the mind mandala with four sides and four entrances, adorned by four por­tals and enclosed by three walls. In the center of the mind mandala and of half its size was the mandala of gnosis, beautified by sixteen pillars. In its center and of half its size was a lotus of eight petals. This mandala, with every feature complete, was created by the power of mind.That Sucandra compiled the Kalacakra Root Tantra after our teacher had passed away is verified by the Great Commentary:In this noble country the Tathagata attained complete enlight­enment. When the Conqueror passed away, the compilers wrote down the three vehicles.44Compilation of the Condensed TantraAfter King Sucandra passed away, SuresVara and the other five dharma kings taught the Root Tantra for the next six hundred years beginning from the W ood Monkey year, the first of the prophesied six hundred years.

Then, with the power of the blessings of the Tathagata’s prophecy as a cause, and knowing with his five kinds of clairvoyance that the minds of Suryaratha and the other rsi were fully ripened and would move to the perfect path, on the Phalguna full moon of the hundredth year, the rudhirodgarin Water Pig year, he gathered his intended disciples, Suryaratha and the other thirty- five million Brahmin rsi, in the mansion of the Kalacakra mandala created by King Sucandra. There he announced:Suryaratha and you other Brahmin rsi, my words will produce the perfection of omniscience. Listen! Next month on the full moon of Caitra I will give you the teachings of the Vajra Vehicle.[15] As soon as he had spoken these words, the rsi fainted from fear. See­ing that this teaching and the thoughts of the rsi were in conflict, King Manjus'rl Yaias said:I will lead you into this mansion of the conqueror Kalacakra and give both worldly and nonworldly initiations. Furthermore, by my command, you should eat, drink, and create relation­ships through marriage in accord with the vajra caste. If you choose not to do this, then leave my nine hundred and sixty million towns and go where you will. Otherwise, after eight hundred years the descendants of your castes will spread the barbarian dharma...And so on until:Therefore, do as I say.These words of King Manjusri Yas'as with his admonishment struck the Brahmin rsi like thunderbolts, and they called to Suryaratha:Suryaratha, tell King Manjus'rl Yas'as that we will not enter the initiation of the vajra caste and that therefore, by his command, it would be better to go to the noble land of India."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"38 IntroductionSuryaratha addressed the mighty ManjusrI Yasas with words of praise for his qualities, beginning “O great king, supreme king,” and so on. He continued:Show kindness to those who live within their own castes. If we must do as you say without question, we will not enter the ini­tiation of the vajra caste, but by your command, it would be best for us to go south of the Sita River to the noble land of India, which lies between the snow mountains and the island of Lanka.King Manjus'rl Yas'as replied:Then quickly leave the land of Shambhala.On the command of King Manjus'rl Yas'as, the Brahmin rsi all rose and left the city of Kalapa. On the tenth day they entered a forest. With his clairvoyant powers King Manjus'rl Yas'as was aware of this, and with many reasons in mind he entered the [16] meditative concentration known as deluding the castes o fV isn u, Brahm a, a n d Rudra to temporarily bewitch the rsi and to bring them back. By the power of that meditative concentration and the blessings of the gods, the rsi were so spellbound that local hunters and others were able to capture them and carry them back to place them at the feet of mighty Mahjus'ri Yaias. Once the rsi were freed from the spell and saw the king, the mandala, and Malaya Park, they were amazed, and as they uttered words of astonishment, Sagaramati, the king’s minister and an emanation, praised King Manjus'rl Yaias and urged the rsi to petition the king for initiation into Kalacakra. By the power of these words and by the blessings of the buddhas, the dharma minds of Suryaratha and the other rsi were truly awakened. The rsi urged Suryaratha to make the request. In response, and together with all the rsi, he prostrated to the feet of King Mafijus'ri Yaias, offered a mandala made of jewels and gold flowers, and made his petition:Bestow the worldly and nonworldly initiations, abridge the king of tantras within the Supreme O riginal B u ddha46 with a shorter version of the twelve thousand verses of the O riginal Buddha as taught to King Sucandra by the Tathagata, and teach it to the rsi.47"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 39Manjus'ri Yasas listened to Suryaratha’s plea, and because of the incli­nation of the Brahmin rsi and the power of the Tathagata’s blessings, he compiled the Condensed Tantra.In what style was that accomplished? Suryaratha and the others were adherents to good grammar, and to wean them away from their attach­ment to that the king employed “reliance upon meanings,”48 whereupon some verses had bad grammar, some had poor line and word separation, some had no grammatical cases, while in others vowels and consonants were omitted. In some verses short vowels were long while [17] long vow­els were short. Some that should have been in the fifth case were in die sev­enth, and some of the fourth case were in the sixth.Therefore, encased in the sragdhara meter and consisting of 86,520 syl­lables, with each verse possessing eighty-four syllables, the twelve thousand verses of the O riginal B u d d h a w z tz condensed into 1,030 verses and taught to the rsi. This is mentioned in the Root Tantra, quoted in the Realms chapter, in the third summary:Therefore this condensed essential meaning is asserted by myself the omniscient one.In sragdhara verses of thirty more than ten hundred, in five chapters, the glorious tantra complete, will be taught by the king of orators.He too will be the compiler.49However, in the current Jonang translations there are 1,042 verses, while in the Gyijo50 and Ma51 translations there are 1,043. On top of that, there are two verses from the Gnosis chapter, quoted in the Great Commentary in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary, that are not found in these root translations.52 These are the 170th verse that begins, “Karma arises from disturbed states of minds, and from that comes suffering. Disturbed states of mind arise from one’s suffering,” and verse 182. Together these make up 1,045 verses. How is this to be explained? Thirteen verses, com­prising ten verses beginning with verse 252 of the Gnosis chapter that begins, “The glorious dharma,” plus the last verse of the Inner chapter beginning, “You are the mother, you are the father,” as well as the ninety- fourth verse of the Realms chapter beginning, “Glorious Kalacakra,” and verse 149 of the Realms chapter beginning, “On the pure supreme foun­dation,” are the words of King Manjus'ri Yas'as and Suryaratha, and are not"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"40 Introductioncompiled from the Root Tantra.

The main explanation2. The duration of these teachings and the duration of the Buddha’s teachings in generalThe dharma king Sucandra taught the Root Tantra for three years. After he passed away, six dharma kings each taught the Root Tantra for a hundred years. These six kings are spoken of in the Root Tantra, which is quoted in the Realms chapter in third summary:Sucandra, Suresvara, Tejl,Somatta, Suresvara,Visvamurti, and Suresana53The text continues to explain who these kings were emanations of:Vajrapani is you Sucandra, then Ksitigarbha, Yamantaka,Viskambhl, Jambhaka,Manaka, Khagarbha.54Suresana taught the Root Tantra for a hundred years. After him his son, Kalki Manjusri Yasas, taught the R oot Tantra for a hundred years. In the hundredth year in the male Wood Rat year on the Caitra full moon, he gave initiation to Suryaratha and the other rsi, compiled the Condensed Tantray and passed away. In that male Wood Rat year, his son Pundarlka composed the V im alaprabha or Great Commentary.

In the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary, in the ninth sum­mary, it says:“Naga hundred years from then”: naga (meaning eight) hun­dred years from the time of Yasas’s passing, definitely (meaning without doubt) the dharma of the barbarians will enter the land of Makha.55This teaches that eight hundred years after the passing of King ManjusrI Yaias, the barbarians would enter the land of Makha. In the “easy to under­stand” verses of the Realms chapter it says:Among the Kalkls, sons and grandsonsof time multiplied by hands, will have passed away,and at that time and without doubt,[19] the barbarian dharma will enter the land of Makha.56“Hands” here means two and “time” means four. After eight Kalkis com­prising Manjus'rl Yas'as, his son Pundarlka, his grandson Bhadra, and the others have passed away, the barbarians will enter the land of Makha. Therefore, eight hundred years after the passing of ManjusrI Yasas, the bar­barians entered the land of Makha, and from his passing until that time, Pundarlka and seven others appeared. This establishes that the eight Kalkls from Pundarlka to Subhadra each taught the dharma for a hundred years.The nine Kalkls from ManjusrI Yas'as to Subhadra are spoken of in the Root Tantra quoted in the third summary of the Realms chapter:Yas'as of Kalkl line,then Kalkl Pundarlka,and Kalkl Bhadra, these three.Likewise, the fourth, Vijaya, then Sumitrabhadra, Ratnapani, the seventh, Visnugupta,Suryaklrti, and Subhadra.57As soon as Subhadra passed away, the barbarians arrived, and Kalkl Samudravijaya ascended to the throne. Samudravijaya taught the dharma for 182 years. After him came Kalkl Aja, who taught the dharma for 221"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"42 Introductionyears. Therefore, the six dharma kings and twenty-three Kalkis are similar in that they each taught for a hundred years. The reigns of Samudravijaya and Aja, however, lasted more than a hundred years. This can be known as follows. In the ninth summary it says:Six hundred years after the Tathagata is the time of Manjus'ri.53This establishes the time of King Manjus'ri Yas'as.Similarly eight hundred years from then is the time of the bar­barians.This establishes the time of the arrival of the barbarians. Similarly:Less 182 years from the time of the barbarians is the time of Kalkl Aja, who reformed the abridged karana astronomy.The years from the time of the barbarians arriving in Makha until the last of the 221 years of astronomy are the fire, sky, and ocean years. Sub­tracting 182 years from the fire, sky, and ocean years is to arrive at the first year of the 221 years of astronomy. That year is the time that Kalkl Aja appears. Establishing the fire, sky, and ocean years is primarily for the pur­pose of knowing the number of years that have passed since the barbarians arrived, but it is also for knowing the dates of these two kings.It is incorrect to assert, as those of the past have done, that every Kalkl ruled for a hundred years. This is because from the time the barbarians first arrived in Makha until they are destroyed by Kalkl Rudra, their bar­barian dharma will have been in existence for 1,800 years, and from the time of Kalkl Samudravijaya ascending to the throne simultaneous with the arrival of the barbarians until the coming of Kalkl Rudracakrl, the number of Kalkis does not exceed sixteen. Therefore, positing the reigns of Samudravijaya and Aja as totaling 403 years accords perfectly with the dura­tion of the barbarians, because each of the hundred years of the fourteen Kalkis from Surya to Rudra, added to the 403 years of Samudravijaya and Durjaya totals 1,803 years. The Later Kalacakra Tantra establishes the bar­barian duration as eighteen hundred years:For eighteen years times a hundred in Makha, and elsewhere in"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 43noble lands, are those renowned as barbarians, those of the dark­ness. These I will destroy.59In the “easy to understand” verses of the Realms chapter from the new Jonang translations it says:In every continent, during the four ages, the barbarians will enter, remaining there for a hundred of eight and one years.Then their dharma will decline.60“A hundred of eight and one years” is written using another system of enu­meration. Putting eight last and one first and multiplying that by a hun­dred totals one thousand eight hundred. The sum of the reigns of the Kalki kings from Samudravijaya onward must tally with the duration of the bar­barians, and because of the differences found in the'reigns of Samudravi­jaya and Aja, [21] it can be established that the remaining fourteen Kalkls each reigned for a hundred years.The sixteen Kalkls beginning from Samudravijaya are stated in the Root Tantra:Samudravijaya, Aja, Kalki Surya is the twelfth,Vis'varupa, Sas'iprabha, Ananta, and Mahipala,Sripala, Hari, Vikrama, Mahabala, and Aniruddha,Narasimha, Mahe^vara, Kalki Anantavijaya, then his son, again the Kalki Yas'as, as Kalki Rudra, possessed of the great wheel, who by skillful speech, the best o f horses s a m a d h if will put an end to the barbarian dharma.For the skillful teacher of Suryaratha and the others,Sucandra, you will compile the Root Tantra and be the composer of an extensive commentary, and here sentient beings will be ripened.For the condensed tantra of Vajra Manjus'rl,Padmapani62 will compose the commentary.63Therefore, from King Sucandra to Kalki Rudracakri, thirty-two kings will have reigned. Rudracakri also reigns for a hundred years. In the “easy to understand” verses in the Realms chapter it says:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"44 IntroductionFor a hundred years on the final throne of the thirty-two will sit the enemy of the asura, possessor of the wheel.64Also:Vajra Manjus'rl, Kalkl of the vajra caste,bowed to by the king of the gods, the supreme god.65This states that Manjus'rl Yas'as was an emanation of Manjus'rl. Because he amalgamated the four castes into the vajra lineage, he is spoken of as a Kalkl. The verses continue:At the end of the ages, from the succession of twenty-five reigns, the caste of Kalkl bowed to by the greatest of gods, the wrathful Kalkl will appear.66This teaches that the number of Kalkls from Mafitjus'ri Yas'as to Rudra- cakrl is ascertained at twenty-five, and that of the four ages of our teacher’s doctrine,67 [22] the Kalkl Rudra will appear at the end of the age of troubles.Therefore, RudracakrI appears when our teacher Sakyamuni’s doctrine of tantra has reached the end of the age of troubles, and eighteen hundred years will have passed since the arrival of the barbarians in Makha. In the ninety-seventh year of his reign, aided by the armies of the twelve great gods and others, Kalkl Rudra will leave Shambhala to journey to the noble land south of the Slta River, and there, in lesser Jambudvipa, they will defeat in battle the armies of the barbarians with their asura allies and bring them and others dwelling in the barbarian dharma to the Vajra Vehicle. Then, clockwise from lesser Jambudvipa, they will enter the other eleven sectors68 one by one, and where the Vajra Vehicle of our teacher Sakya- muni has declined at the end of the era of troubles, they will restore it. In all twelve sectors, thereby, the teachings of the victorious Vajra Vehicle will bring about an era of completeness.With such an accomplishment and his hundred-year life at an end, his two sons, Brahma, an emanation of MafijusrI, and Indra, an emanation of Avalokites'vara, will be appointed teachers of the Vajra Vehicle, and Rudra will pass away. Brahma will be the dharma teacher in Shambhala north of the Slta River for eight hundred years, while Indra will be the teacher of dharma in the noble country and other lands."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 45In this way, RudracakrI brings the Vajra Vehicle of the Conqueror at the end of the age of troubles into an age of completeness. How long will that doctrine last? In each continent it will last for eighteen hundred years. In the “easy to understand” verses in the Realms chapter it says:The ages of completeness, of three, of two, and of troubles is ascertained by the measurements of None Higher.69As this quote states, the total duration of the four ages of the restoration of the doctrine by RudracakrI in the twelve continents is the length of one day in the realm of None Higher,70 or in the human realm, 21,600 years. That divided by twelve is eighteen hundred and that is the duration of the four ages in each of the twelve sectors. Moreover, concerning the length of each of the [23] four ages of completeness, three, two and troubles, the tantra says:As to the length of each, a hundred human years multiplied by time and arrow.71Therefore, the sum of each of the ages’ duration in the twelve sectors is 5,400 years. That divided by twelve is 450 and is the duration of each age in each of the twelve sectors.Therefore, the duration of the doctrine known as the four ages is of two kinds: the earlier four ages of the Buddha’s doctrine and the later four ages of RudracakrI’s restoration of the doctrine. The four ages of the Conqueror’s doctrine run from his passing until RudracakrI has com­pleted ninety-seven years. This is a total of 3,304 years. These years are made up of the four years from our Teacher delivering the Root Tantra until the passing of Sucandra, seven hundred years from King Sures'vara until the passing of Manjus'ri Yas'as, eight hundred years from Pundarlka until the passing of Subhadra, the 403 years of Samudravijaya and Aja, the 1,300 years of the thirteen Kalkis from Surya to Anantavijaya and the ninety-seven years of RudracakrI.However, if RudracakrI defeats the barbarians at the age of ninety-seven, in the “easy to understand” verses in the Realms chapter of the Tantra it says:The barbarian hordes destroyed with allies, at half one hundred human years,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"4 6 Introductionthe accomplishment of the Kalkiin the great celestially designed palace behind Kailash.72Doesn’t this quote say that Rudracakri will destroy the barbarians and their allies at the age of fifty and then pass away in Shambhala behind the mountain of Kailash? There is no contradiction. This quote explains that Kalki Rudra, from his ninety-eighth year until the completion of his hun­dred years, will thoroughly destroy the barbarian hordes and their allies who have accepted [24] the barbarian dharma. Having weakened the non- dharma flourishing at the end of the age of troubles in the twelve sectors, he will appoint his sons Brahma and Indra as dharma teachers at the end of his hundred years. Half one hundred, or fifty human years, after his passing into great bliss, the barbarians that he defeated and their allies will accomplish the path of the Kalki. Where will this occur? In Shambhala, in the great celestially designed palace behind Kailash. If it were otherwise, and Kalki Rudra defeats the barbarians at the age of fifty, then the barbarian duration of eighteen hundred years would be fifty years short. Further­more, the Tantra says:For a hundred years on the final throne of the thirty-two, will sit the enemy of the asura, possessor of the wheel.73This states that Kalki Rudra reigns for a hundred years. Also:In the age of completeness every dharma of the barbarians will be destroyed by the master of the three worlds.Appointing Brahma for eight hundred years, he will travel to the place of bliss.74This explains that immediately after destroying the barbarian dharma, Brahma will be appointed dharma teacher for eight hundred years, and Rudra will travel to the place of bliss, meaning that he will pass away.It was previously explained that our teacher became a buddha and passed away on vaisakha full moons.

Furthermore, in the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary, in the sev­enth summary, in the part where it explains how the profound meaning of the Kalacakra is not for the attachment-free listeners,77 [25] it begins, “Those free of attachment, the noble Ananda and others,”78 and goes on to explain how the profound meaning is not for the noble Ananda and others. These statements and others are made in accordance with the views of the com­mon vehicle in which disciples take the deeds of the Buddha and the ema­nations of bodhisattvas and s'râvakas as being factually true in the way they were performed. However, the final thinking of the Root Tantra, the Con­densed Tantra, and the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries is expressed in the Great Commentary:The conquering Buddha in countless, countless emanated illu­sory and nonobscured forms in the great thousand world realms engages in the languages of every sentient being when various supplicants request the Buddha in the limitless tongues of lim­itless sentient beings. W ith omniscient speech he teaches worldly and nonworldly dharma. Yet the omniscient one is not more than one. Therefore, in order to teach worldly and non­worldly dharma to all sentient beings, the conquering Buddha first became the powerful one of the twelve levels, then with skilful and great magic, with great visual illusion, he took birth from the womb of Màyàdevi, wife of Suddhodana, king of the Sàkya clan, to become the youth Siddàrtha.79As this quote indicates, Sakyainuni had already attained complete enlight­enment in the past, and in the course of working for the benefit of count­less sentient beings with countless emanations, in this world he manifested enlightenment and passing away. Similarly, Vajrapàni, Manjus'rl, Avalo- kites'vara, and others had already attained complete enlightenment when they took the form of tenth-level bodhisattvas and worked for the benefit of others. These and other examples are beyond the scope of thought. In the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary, in the third,summary, it says:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48 IntroductionThe great one of the world dwelt in the hells for the sake of sen­tient beings. There the messengers of death and the lords of death spoke these words of praise, “Although free from the chains of existence, he holds to existence for the sake of sentient beings.

The taints of the mind have been burned off by the fire of wisdom, a mind always moist [26] with flawless compassion, whose deeds, without conception, are joy­fully done for the benefit of sentient beings. To the Buddha we prostrate.80More specifically in B right Lam p it says:Why in this world are the venerable Ananda and others renowned as compilers of scripture? Ananda is the great bodhi­sattva Samantabhadra. He is Vajrapani, undifferentiated from the great Vajradhara. Otherwise, how could Vajrapani, having heard from the Tathagata the eighty-four thousand volumes of sutra, memorize them on a single hearing without omission or addition?81As scriptural support for the above, a passage from a highest yoga tantra called Special Secrets is quoted:Furthermore, I will explain the perfect entourage of the omnis­cient one. It is like this: Manjus'ri was the great king Suddho- dana.82Therefore, when the Conqueror taught the highest tantras, the teacher, compilers, and entourage of listeners were emanations of the Buddha and of the same continuum as the Teacher himself. Even those of the com­monly accepted entourage such as Ananda and King Suddhodana were emanations of the Teacher and of the same continuum as the compilers of the tantras. Similarly, it should be known that it is the final thinking of the Kalacakra Root Tantra and its commentaries that King Sucandra and oth­ers, who were at the special gathering for the teaching of the Root Tantra, were also emanations of the Teacher. The H evajra Tantra says:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 49The teacher is me, the dharma too is me.The gathering and the listeners are me.The teacher of the world and the practices are me.The worldly and the nonworldly are me.83In the commentary to the above by Vajragarbha it says:“The worldly and the nonworldly are me” means that all that is held with certainty by infantile beings— the Buddha and his queens, the sensual pleasure, the entourage, the teachings of the dharma, the teacher, the listeners, and teaching by desire84— are to be refuted. These are for developing the insights of sentient beings in the future. They are the play of the buddhas. [27] In reality, the form of a buddha is as a vajra, immovable as an ox.85The duration of these teachings and the duration of the Buddha s teachings in generalIn the sutra tradition the duration of the teachings has been variously put at one thousand years, two thousand years, and so on. In some volumes of the Sutra o f the Good Eon86 the duration is said to be five thousand years. In Destroying H arm to the Three M others it says, “It is taught that the Tathagatas teaching will last for five thousand years.”87 Acharya Manjukirti also says that the teachings would remain for five thousand years. There­fore, these claims can be taken literally, while other estimates found in the sutras, such as one thousand years, were taught, as the commentary Illu ­m in a tin g Reality says,88 for specific reasons. This position is accepted by many masters, including those of the Sakya tradition, and therefore the five-thousand-year duration will be explained here.The five thousand years are divided into ten sets of five hundred years. In the first three sets many arhats, nonreturners, and stream-enterers89 appeared. These first three periods are known, therefore, as the period of the arhat, the period of the nonreturner, and the period of the stream- enterer respectively. Collectively they will be known as the three periods o f realization. In the following three sets of five hundred years, many beings endowed with special insight, meditative concentration, and morality appeared. These three periods are known individually as the periods of spe­cial insight and so forth and collectively as the three periods o f practice. In"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50 Introductionthe next three sets of five hundred years many teachers of Abhidharma, Sutra, and Vinaya will appear. Individually these periods will be known as the periods of Abhidharma and so forth. Collectively they will be called the three periods o f transmission. In the last five hundred years there will be no pure views or practice and only the outward signs of monasticism will be adhered to. This period will be known, therefore, as the perio d o f adherence to mere signs. These are the five thousand years from the passing of the Buddha until the completion of the period of adherence to mere signs. This is the duration of the Perfection Vehicle teachings.However, this is not duration of the teachings based upon the Vajra Vehicle. As there is no presentation of the special path of mantra within the canon of the Perfection Vehicle, [28] there is no reason for it to state the duration of the teachings of the Vajra Vehicle. Therefore, the duration of the teachings of the Vajra Vehicle is as taught in the Kalacakra Tantra and its commentaries. The four ages of Sakyamuni’s mantra teachings begin from the time of his teaching the Root Tantra and his passing until the time Kalkl RudracakrI first defeats the barbarians. This has been explained as totaling 3,304 years. To this is added the four ages that make up the eighteen hundred years of Rudracakrl’s restoration in Greater Jambudvipa. This comes to 5,104 years.Therefore, the duration as explained here and the duration as explained in the sutras differ by about a hundred years. This, however, is no error because the duration of the Perfection Vehicle teachings and of the Vajra Vehicle teachings are separate presentations from separate canons. For example, in the glorious Kalacakra and its commentaries, it is explained that in the northern continent of Uttarakuru, both sets of the four ages of the teachings will arise after each other, whereas in the Perfection Vehicle canon it is stated that the beings of Uttarakuru are unsuitable vessels for the Con­queror’s teachings.How much time has already passed and how much remains? Those of the past would have calculated, to quote one set of figures, that from the time of the Buddha’s passing to this sobhana female Water Rabbit year,90 3,615 years have passed. Many differing calculations exist. Using the ¿ ri Kalacakra Tantra and commentaries as a basis, four years elapsed from the time of the Buddha’s passing until the passing of King Sucandra. From then until the death of ManjusrI Yas'as, seven hundred years passed. After Yasas came the eight hundred years from Pundarlka to the arrival of the barbarians. Then came the fire, sky, and ocean years. Therefore, from the"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Compilation o f the Root and Condensed Tantra 51passing of our teacher up to die last year of the 221 years of astronomy, I>9°7 years elapsed. These figures have been sequentially quoted in the Tantra and commentaries. To this total is added the number of years of die teachings of past Kalacakra masters, such as Pandita Sakyas'ri up to the end of this sobhana Water Rabbit year. This comes to seven sixty-year cycles and thirty-seven years.91 As a total this comes to 2,364 years. Therefore, accord­ing to the Perfection Vehicle, [29] 364 years of the period of meditative con­centration have passed, and 2,636 years of the teachings remain. According to the general duration of the teachings of the Vajra Vehicle, 2,740 years are still to pass.Moreover, up until this sobhana Female Water Rabbit year, fifteen Kalkis up to King Ananta have passed, and since Kalkl Mahlpala began teaching the dharma, fifty-seven years will have passed by the end of the year. Nine hundred and forty years from the end of this Water Rabbit year, Kalkl RudracakrI will appear, and the Vajra Vehicle teachings of the con­quering lion of the Sakya, such as the transmission and practice of the Sri Kalacakra, will enter the age of completeness.The introduction on how the Buddha taught the Root Tantra and so forth is complete."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"e Primordial ;nd and BodyThe primordial mind and body:Principal themes o f the highest yoga class oftantraThis has two main outlines:1.

It does not become good or bad by the force of circumstance.The rays of the sun spread themselves equally upon the beautiful, such as jewels, and upon the ugly, such as filth, and yet it remains unaffected, either adversely or beneficially. Likewise, the mind of clear light is very subtle, and though it enters good states of existence such as those of the gods or bad such as those of hell, it remains unaffected by them, either adversely or beneficially. This is because, like the sun, it is pure by nature.2. As an entity it never develops into the impurities of the mind.Gold even when tarnished never becomes the tarnish. Water when dirtied never becomes the dirt. Likewise, the mind of clear light is very subtle, yet when dwelling with the impurities of deluded states of mind, conceptual­ity, and so forth, it never develops into the actual entities of these states of mind. If it did, it would not be possible to eradicate, with appropriate opponent forces, the conceptuality and deluded states of mind within the clear-light mind. Alternatively, if these impurities were eradicated, the con­tinuum of the clear-light mind would also come to an end. The mind of clear light therefore is pure by nature. [32]The transience of the impuritiesIn a mixture of water and dirt, the water has been created from its own sub­stantial cause into its own clear and transparent nature, and its dirtiness has come about from its own causes, such as dust and so forth, which are dis­tinct from the water’s substantial cause. The dirt therefore can be sepa­rated from the water and is a temporary phenomenon.Similarly, the mind of clear light and the impurities of the two kinds of obscuration have been linked since time without beginning. Nevertheless, the mind of clear light is developed from its own substantial similar-type cause into its own entity of purity. The impurities, on the other hand, develop from their causes of improper mental activity and arise from the clear-light mind like fish jumping from water. They are therefore temporary"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 57phenomena, capable of being removed from a mind whose nature is clear light.Furthermore, when water is not in contact with conditions such as dirt and dust, it is clear and transparent. Similarly, if the natural mind of clear light were separated from the causes and conditions that bring about the impurities, it would reveal its clarity in its separation from the entangle­ments of duality. As long as the mind of clear light dwells with impurities, such as desire generated by improper mental activity, it will not become manifest to ordinary beings even though it is everpresent. This is because it is obscured by these impurities and remains unseen.Its path of practiceFirstly, the central channel is purified and empty forms appear to the med­itator. These forms are created by the practices of the yogas of withdrawal and meditative absorption which make up the branch of fo rm accomplish­ment. Then the winds from the left and right channels are brought into the central channel by the yogas of pranayama and retention, which make up the branch of w in d accomplishment. This manifests the mind of clear light, and the appearance of that mind as empty form becomes progressively purer. The generation of the four joys of descent and ascent develops the mind of clear light into innate bliss, which is applied to emptiness, and the gnosis of bliss and emptiness is developed.After the completion of the yoga of retention comes the yoga of recol­lection, in which an actual empty form in the aspect of father-mother union is meditated upon. Also, during recollection, the mind of clear light devel­ops into bliss and, as a consciousness, is applied to its object of emptiness. [33] The resulting bliss-and-emptiness gnosis is meditated upon many times, which will eventually produce the mahamudra consort. Reliance on this consort will develop the ability to induce unchanging bliss. From that point onward the clear-light mind develops into the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss on the yoga of meditative concentration. This unchang­ing bliss is applied to emptiness, and the resulting bliss-and-emptiness gno­sis is meditated upon. One by one the twelve levels are attained, and the21,600 karmic winds are halted. Impurities, such as the predispositions for emission,103 are gradually eradicated, and the mind of clear light in the form of unchanging bliss becomes the body of great bliss."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58 IntroductionTimes when clear light manifestsThere are two kinds of manifestation: natural or effortless manifestation and manifestation through the power of meditative concentration. The first occurs when sentient beings die. On the basis of the Kalacakratantra and its commentaries, when someone possessed of the six elements dies, first the water element weakens the fire element, then the earth element enters the water and disappears. The water element is subsequently dried by the air element, which in turn absorbs into the space element and dis­appears. At this time the knots of the central channel loosen, the flow of wind in the right and left channels is halted, and wind enters and dissolves into the central channel. When this happens, all conceptualization of tran­sient objects ceases. The natural clear-light mind becomes separated from all limiting conceptual elaboration and takes on the aspect of a spacelike emptiness. Within that emptiness various empty forms arise of their own volition like images in a clairvoyant’s mirror. This is known as the mani- festation-of-death clear light. The Great Commentary, commenting in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter on the line beginning “Water weak­ens fire,” says:“Water” and so forth means that in this human realm, at the time of death of those born from wombs, water weakens fire. Therefore, through the power of this meditative con­centration, the process of fire is weakened by water, and this is the meditator’s first practice within the body. Then, because of there being no fire, earth loses its solidity and dis­solves like salt to become liquid, dwelling within the water element. Then the element of air [34] dries up every drop of water and disappears into space. In this way the elements quickly weaken. Then “the mind is the fire at the end of darkness,”104 which means that the foundation conscious­ness is placed in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms empty of all objects, dwelling in the middle.105Foundation consciousness in this quote refers to the mind of clear light, and in the line “The mind is the fire at the end of darkness,” darkness is the near attainment at the time of death, while fire is the death clear light, which arises from near attainment."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 59This death clear light is experienced by ordinary beings but cannot be ascertained by them. Therefore, once the bardo state of one of the six kinds of existence has been formed, ordinary beings will move on power- lessly to another existence. However the yogi meditating on the comple­tion stage during his lifetime develops the ability to manifest the mind of clear light and sets a powerful intention106 for the ascertainment of death clear light. When he actually ascertains death clear light, he applies the clear light to emptiness and meditates on bliss and emptiness gnosis. Like­wise, when the bardo existence arrives, the power of his meditation will ensure that he takes a special form of existence in his next life for the prac­tice of tantra where the remainder of the path will be practiced and enlight­enment realized.However, in the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries, there is no presenta­tion of attaining enlightenment during bardo existence. There is a reason for this. Attaining enlightenment in the bardo means that death clear light is transformed into the path of the ultimate-mind isolation clear light. The clear-light mind rides upon the very subtle wind, from which arises the illusory body instead of the bardo existence. The remainder of the path is practiced in that form, and enlightenment is attained. The Three Bodhi­sattva Commentaries do not present such a path but assert that the empty form that appears during the meditative equipoise of the six-branched yoga is a similar-type cause of the empty-form father-and-mother union of enlightenment, and there is no basis for the accomplishment of the form body existing in the ordinary state. This is the reason why there is no such presentation. However some scholars (such as Kumaramati)107 [35] say that the reason there is no presentation of attaining buddhahood in the bardo within the tenets of the K dlacakratantra and its commentaries is that a coarse body is necessary for the development of unchanging bliss and, therefore, supreme unchanging bliss cannot be accomplished in the bardo mental body.108 This is not correct. If that were the case, then similar con­sequences could be applied to the Guhyasamaja and other tantras that do assert the attaining of enlightenment in the bardo.Manifesting the mind of clear light by the power of meditative concentrationWithdrawal and meditative absorption are the methods by which the winds enter the central channel to purify it, while vase yoga and the vajra"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"6o Introductionrecitation in the branch of pranayama cause the flow of the winds in the right and left channels to be cut and so enter the central channel, where the mind of clear light is made manifest. Such a process of manifesting clear light arises from cutting the flow of the winds, or mounts of conceptual­ity, of the left and right channel by targeting the channels, drops, and winds of the vajra body and bringing those winds into the central channel. The Great Commentary, in the Realms chapter, in the first summary says:Although fire dwells constantly within wood, by cutting and separation it is not seen.Yet, when the fire-stick is worked with the hands, it is seen to dwell within.Similarly, by habitual conceptuality, the mind of clear light is not seen.But when the right and left channel are united as one, it will be manifest.109As long as the mind to which objects of a transient nature appear is not halted, it is not possible to manifest the mind of clear light. To halt such a mind, the winds must enter the dhutl,110 and as long as the winds flow within the left and right channel, it is not possible to halt such a mind.Some (such as Kumaramati and Kumarafri)111 have said that the pri­mordial mind of clear light that is the subject of the previous quotes from the tantras and commentaries is identical to the buddha essence, or impure suchness, as taught in the Uttaratantra, one of the five treatises of the pro­tector Maitreya. They also claim that this buddha essence taught in the Uttaratantra and in the In Praise o fD harm adhatu is the causal tantra taught by the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra when it says:Tantra it is known means continuum, and that continuum is of three kinds.[36] The basis, the nature of suchness, and the invincible: is it thus divided.112Their assertion cannot be seen to be correct because that would mean the path of practice as taught in the U ttaratantra also would have to be the method tantra taught in the line “the basis, that of the nature of suchness” because the reasoning is the same.113 Furthermore it would also mean that"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 61to manifest buddha essence as taught in the Uttaratantra, it would be nec­essary to halt the flow of winds in the right and left channel and bring them to the central channel. This is because in order to make manifest the primordial inborn mind of clear light as it is taught in the tantras and com­mentaries, it is necessary to halt the flow of winds in the left and right channels and to have them enter the central channel. As the Great Com­m entary says in the Realms chapter, in the first summary:Similarly, by habitual conceptuality,the mind of clear light is not seen.But when the right and left channelare united as one, it will be manifest.114Some (such as the Jonang tradition) assert the existence of a buddha essence adorned with the features and signs of enlightenment, endowed with the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, and every other excellent qual­ity of abandonment. They assert this essence to be unchanging and per­manent, of ultimate existence, and dwelling inside every sentient being since beginningless time but hidden within the temporary impurities. This they maintain is what is meant by the quotes from the tantra, such as the verses beginning “Pervading space, the vajra of space,” “Sentient beings are buddhas,” and so forth, as well as by the quotes from the commentaries quoted previously. They also maintain that this is the meaning of quotes such as that beginning “A statue of buddha wrapped in rags”115 from the U ttaratantra and similar quotes from In Praise o f D harm adhatu. Further­more they claim that the P rajnaparam itd and other sutras in which the Buddha spoke of all phenomena being empty of any true existence are actu­ally teaching an “emptiness of other,” in which the above-mentioned bud­dha essence is empty of “other” transient impurities. Because this buddha essence is empty of the impurities or objects of negation and because it is truly existing, it is not an “emptiness of self.” They also claim that this is the thinking of the [37] Kalacakra and its commentaries.116To this, firstly I say the following. O f the ten powers, there is the power of the wisdom that knows what is and what is not the basis.117 Does this power know what is and what is not the basis of a hairy old dog? If it does not know, it could not be a wisdom that knows what is and what is not the basis. If it does know, it could not be a wisdom covered by the obscuring impurities. Furthermore, if the meaning of statements that all phenomena"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62 Introductionare empty as found in the Prajndparam ita and other sutras was that the buddha essence was empty of “other” impurities, empty of the impurities to be negated, and was itself truly existing, then you would have to agree that the emptiness spoken of in these sutras as being empty of the objects to be negated would also be truly existing. Even if you do actually assert this, it could not be correct, because in F undam ental Treatise on the M id ­dle Way it says:The conquerors have saidthat emptiness uproots all views,and that those who have a view of emptinesswill have no accomplishment.118And from its commentary, Clear Words:Were someone to say, “I will not give you anything at all,” and if I were to reply, “Then give me that which does not exist!” how would it be possible to hold that as not existing? Likewise, for those who even cling to emptiness as a reality, how will they negate their clinging to reality?119Similarly the Heap o f Jewels Sutra, quoted at this point in Clear Words, says:Kasyapa, those who focus upon emptiness and have thoughts of emptiness fall far from my words. Kas'yapa, to have views on self the size of Mount Meru is tolerable, but with strong pride to have views on emptiness is not. Why is that? Kasyapa, if emptiness is that which uproots every view, then Kas'yapa, I say that those who have a view on emptiness alone are beyond all cure.120These quotes state that it is wrong to have a view on any phenomenon as truly existing, and to view emptiness as truly existing is said to be an especially incurable view. Such statements do great damage to the previous assertions.(38] Furthermore to assert that the buddha essence is adorned by the features and signs of enlightenment, is endowed with the ten powers, the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 63four kinds of fearlessness, and every other excellent quality of the buddha, that it is unchanging and permanent, of ultimate existence, and dwells inside every sentient being since beginningless time is completely wrong because the words of the Buddha in sutras that teach this way are not to be taken literally, and such teachings are intended for interpretation. This is explained in Candrakirti’s commentary to his own M adhyam akdvatdra, where he quotes from the Lankdvatarasutra:“In the teachings on the buddha essence, the Conqueror spoke of that whose nature was pure and of clear light, pure since beginningless time, endowed with the thirty-two features of enlightenment, and existing within the bodies of every sentient being. The Conqueror taught that like a very precious jewel wrapped in dirty cloth, it lies permanent and unchanging, wrapped in the cloths of the aggregates, sensory spheres, and sense sources, eclipsed by anger, desire, and ignorance, tainted by the impurities of conceptuality.121This passage describing a buddha essence accords with your assertions as taught by a sutra requiring interpretation. The sutra continues:“Conqueror, Tathagata, if that is so, how is one who teaches on tathagata essence unlike the outsiders who teach on self? Conqueror, the outsiders are also teachers of a self that is per­manent, a nondoer, devoid of qualities, pervasive, and imper­ishable.”This passage states that a buddha essence described in this way is similar to the permanent self propounded by non-Buddhists and asks how it could be any different. The sutra continues with the reply:The Conqueror replied, “Mahamati, my teaching of the buddha essence is not similar to the Tirthankara teachings on self. Mahamati, the tathagatas, conquerors of the enemy, perfectly complete buddhas, have taught the meanings of terms such as[39] emptiness, perfect reality, nirvana, the unborn, the sign­less, the wishless, and so forth as buddha essence.

By doing so the nonconcep- tual state, the nonappearing object, is taught. Mahamati, those great beings, those bodhisattvas of the future and of the present, should not hold fast to a self.”122The sentence beginning “Mahamati, my teaching o f’ expresses the asser­tion that the teaching of the buddha essence as held by you is not similar to non-Buddhists’ teachings of a permanent self. The list of terms begin­ning with “emptiness” reveals the thinking behind the teachings on bud­dha essence. The words “Mahamati, the tathagatas, conquerors of the enemy, perfectly complete buddhas, have taught the meanings of terms,” and including the phrase “as buddha essence,” reveal the ways in which the essence was taught. The purpose of the sentence beginning “Children” up to “remove that fear” is to reveal what is to be excluded, and the pur­pose of the sentence beginning “By doing so” reveals what is to be included. The last sentence, beginning “Mahamati, those great beings,” teaches that if the words of sutras that speak of this kind of buddha essence are held as literal, this leads to a clinging to a permanent self. Therefore the quote ends “should not hold fast to a self,” which illustrates the actual damage done to the previous assertion. The text immediately following the above passage beginning “Mahamati, for example” up to “Mahamati, in this way the tathagatas taught and are teaching the tathagata essence in order to guide those who hold to the outsiders’ assertion of self” explain that texts propounding a buddha essence within every sentient being, adorned with features of an enlightened being, endowed with qualities such as the ten powers and the four kinds of fearlessness, permanent and unchanging, are not to be adhered to literally but are for a particular purpose and are to be interpreted. Therefore, it can be understood that it is incorrect to explain the tantra and the Great Commentary by way of such a buddha essence.[40] This has been just a brief explanation.Primordial bodyThe very subtle primordial mind explained above is inseparable from the very subtle wind.

All phe­nomena of samsara are manifestations of the indivisible entity of primor­dial body and mind. In the Vajra Garland explanatory tantra it says:Be it birth, abiding, or destruction,life or the intermediate state,as long as it is bound by the world,it is a manifestation of the winds of the mind.123The Sandhivyakarana Tantra says:All that is tied to sentient beings,be it with consciousness or without,arises from the winds, is ended by the winds.The unknowing mind dwells in the ocean of samsara, where, by going wayward, it migrates into dogs, jackals, cows, and horses.124The winds and the mind migrate into different living forms, and at death the aggregates, sensory spheres, sense sources, and the coarse winds and minds withdraw into the very subtle wind and mind. In this process the ele­ments of earth, water, fire, and air dissolve in turn, and the minds of appearance, increase, and attainment arise in succession. When death clear light appears, there are no minds or winds of that person’s continuum pres­ent except for the very subtle wind and mind. However, because this very subtle wind and mind is the primordial wind and mind, the continuum of that person’s mind and body is not broken. W ith the wind of the very sub­tle wind and mind of death clear light acting as a substantial cause,125 the bardo body will arise, and with the mind of the death clear light as a sub­stantial cause, the coarse and subtle bardo minds will arise. [41] This is the thinking behind the two quotes above.The yogi practicing on the path focuses on and penetrates the channels, drops, and winds and induces successively the minds of appearance, increase, attainment, and clear light. Then the final mind isolation, with its manifest subtle mind and wind, or the path of a suitable alternative, is actualized, and from this very subtle wind and mind arises the illusory body. This illusory body is a similar-type cause of the illusory body of the enlightenment union, while the subtle mind is a similar-type cause of the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"66 Introductiondharmakaya. This is just an introduction. The process can be known exten­sively from the peerless Lantern Illu m in a tin g the Five Stages.On individual presentations of primordial mind and primordial body in the context of Kalacakra, the Three'Bodhisattva Commentaries and other commentaries concentrate primarily on subtle mind in their explanations of the winds and mind of the clear light and do not concentrate on the winds. The protector Nagarjuna and other mahasiddhas who wrote com­mentaries on the Guhyasamaja and other hidden tantras focused on the clear-light mind and wind equally in their explanations. The reason for these differing and individual explanations is as follows. According to Three Bodhisattva Commentaries, a similar-type cause of both bodies of a buddha can be fashioned from the clear-light mind itself, and a similar-type cause of the form body of a buddha is not created from the subtle wind. Another reason is that in the sense of being the creator of all phenomena of samsara and nirvana, the innate mind of clear light pervades everything.According to commentaries on the S ri G uhyasam djatantra and other hidden tantras composed by mahasiddhas such as the protector Nagarjuna, the mind of clear light is formed into a similar-type cause of the dhar­makaya and the subtle wind becomes a similar-type cause of the form body. These two differing explanations have come about because of differing types of disciples. This will be explained later.This has been a brief explanation of the primordial body and mind, the basis for the accomplishment of the two bodies of a buddha. [42]Explanations of the intentions of the highest yoga tantrasThe skillful transformation of the primordial body and mind, the two spe­cial themes of highest mantra, into similar-type causes of the two bodies of a buddha is the path of the completion stage, which is the main topic of highest mantra. The root tantras that describe this path are of two types: those that explain the stages of generation and completion in a concealed way and those that do so clearly and in an unconcealed manner. Examples of hidden tantras would be the short condensed tantras of Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, and Guhyasamaja. There are two ways in which the hidden meanings of these tantras are brought out. The first is to explain each root tantra by relying upon individual explanatory tantras. This was the method employed by Nagarjuna and the other mahasiddhas of India. The second way is to explain the tantra in accordance with the thinking of Kalacakra"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 67and its commentaries. This is the method used by the Vajragarbha Com­mentary, the Vajrapdni Commentary, and others.Concerning the first method, the Guhyasamdja Root Tantra is explained by six explanatory tantras, such as the Vajra Garland, and these in turn have been explained by Nagarjuna and his disciples, who taught them as the five stages of the path, beginning with the isolation of speech. The Short Cakrasamvara Root Tantra is explained by six explanatory tantras, such as the Samvaraudbhava, and they in turn have been explained by mahasiddhas such as Vajraghanta in the format of the five stages, such as blessing of self and so forth. The Short H evajra Root Tantra is explained by its explanatory tantras, such as the Vajra Tent, Samputa, Caturyoganisamputa, and so forth. These have been taught by the venerable Virupa in his presentation of the paths and results, which condense the actual completion stage into the paths of the three initiations.The way that texts such as the Vajragarbha Commentary and the Vajra­p d n i Com m entary explain the tantras as conforming to the thinking of Kalacakra and its commentary can be known by looking at these two com­mentaries, which explain, the Inner and Outer, the six-branched yoga, and so forth, in light of the Kalacakra and its commentary.Therefore it is necessary to classify commentaries into those of the mahasiddhas of India [43] who explained the hidden tantras of Guhyasamdja and so forth and those such as the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries. Accord­ing to the Vajragarbha Commentary, the definitive meanings of the Cakra­samvara and Four Seats tantras should be understood from the Five H undred Thousand Hevajra Tantra. The definitive meanings of the hidden tantras of the Hevajra and the Short Cakrasamvara should be understood from the Four Seats Tantra. The definitive meanings of all of them should be under­stood from the root tantra of the O riginal B uddha Kalacakra and from the H u n d red Thousand Cakrasamvara. The Vajragarbha Commentary says:From Hevajra will Cakrasamvara and the Four Seats Tantra be understood. Hevajra 2nd, the Short CakrasamvaraW\\]\\ be under­stood from the Four Seats Tantra. From the words of the Supreme Original Buddha and from the Great Cakrasamvara will definitive meanings be understood.126In this way, the verses on the six-branched yoga taught in the Later Guhyasamdja has led to two different interpretations. One accords with"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"68 Introductionthe six-branched yoga of Kalacakra, and the other accords with the six- branched yoga as taught by Nagarjuna, Candraklrti, and others. In his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, Naropa explains these pas­sages of the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra in accord with the six-branched yoga of Kalacakra, while in his commentary on the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra he explains them in accord with B right Lamp.How does the six-branched yoga taught in the Kalacakra differ from the six-branched yoga as explained by the B right Lam p, where it is explained according to the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra? The meaning of withdrawal in Kalacakra is that the sensory powers are withdrawn inward and do not engage their respective objects. According to B right Lam p, withdrawal means that the sensory powers withdraw or gather into their objects, such as visual form, to be individually enjoyed in the manner of “taxes gather­ing unto a tax collector.” Moreover the Great Com m entary says in the Realms chapter in the second summary:The intermediate sign is that by 1,800 supreme and unchanginginstances, the first level is attained.127[44] This explains that the achievement of 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss by the branch of meditative concentration is the attainment of the level of an arya, while the branch of recollection and below is at the level of an ordinary being. Bright Lam p explains the branch of retention as being the actual clear light, the branch of recollection as the arising of the actual clear-light reversal, the branch of meditative concentration as being union, and that once the actual clear light is attained, the practitioner becomes an arya direcdy cognizing emptiness. This can be understood from the twelfth chapter of B right Lamp, where it comments on the branch of retention:The sinking of all apprehending is explained as being retention.How is that?“It is called perfect reality.The mind becomes the cessation vajraand the signs of near attainment arise.”Here vajra cessation is clear light, and the mind becomes that clear light.128"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 69In this way, B right Lam p establishes the branch of retention as being the actual clear light. The branch of recollection is established as being the time of the actual clear-light reversal, and this can be known from the same chapter in the section on the branch of recollection:Therefore, having meditated upon and actualized that whose nature is clear light, the forms of miragelike appearances and so forth are recollected as they were in the attainment of perfect reality. These emanate and are created in sequence. This should be known and understood as recollection.129Therefore clear light is actualized in the branch of retention. Arising from this clear light, those previous forms of miragelike appearances that arose during the entering into clear light are here recollected, and they arise like those in the “attainment of perfect reality \"clear light. “These emanate and are created in sequence” in a reverse sequence. This is to be understood as being the branch of recollection. B right Lam p also asserts the branch of[45] meditative concentration as being the state of union.If it is B right Lam p s assertion that the branch of retention corresponds to actual clear light, then it is true that someone who has attained the stages of recollection and meditative concentration must be an arya. However, doesn’t the clear light explained as being the branch of retention refer to the similitude clear light? This is not so. In the section explaining the recol­lection of the “unborn,” B right L am p says:The verse beginning “Within that” and so on teaches the aris­ing of the state of union. The unborn is the branch of retention.And so on until:After the branch of retention comes entity clear light. “Entity” refers to conventional truth. “Clear light” is ultimate truth.Clear light possessing entity is known as entity clear light. What is that? It is the body of the great Vajradhara, whose nature is nondual gnosis.130Therefore, when arising from the clear light, which is explained as being the branch of retention, one arises in the body of union."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"70 IntroductionThe thinking of the hidden tantras has been explained by the commen­taries of the mahasiddhas of India and by the Three Bodhisattva C om m en­taries, and you should not use one to refute the other, nor make the mistake of thinking that similar terms in their respective presentations have simi­lar meanings. Tantras that teach the paths of the generation and comple­tion stages in an open and unconcealed way include the Root Kalacakra Tantra and Condensed Kalacakra Tantra. The Great Commentary says in the second summary of the Realms chapter:The Vajra Vehicle, in accord with the mentality of sentient beings, lies hidden within the vajra words in the K ing o f Tantras.The Tathagata said, “The fourth also is likewise.”131 The fourth is not the third and therefore is called the fourth. “Also is like­wise” means that the wisdom-knowledge132 itself becomes the fourth. Because of these words of the Conqueror, it lies hidden within the vajra words. In the King o f Tantras the vajra words are not clear. They will be understood through the transmission of masters, and tantras will be understood from other tantras. This the Tathagata has said.133[46] This passage says that in hidden tantras such as the Guhyasamaja, pro­found meanings, as illustrated by the fourth initiation, are explained in a concealed fashion. The quote continues:Here in the O riginal Buddha, the Conqueror, has clarified those very vajra words by very clearly teaching, explaining, and well explaining. As proof of that, the signs of smoke and so forth on the path of mahamudra meditation are clarified.“Focus single pointedly upon the emptiness, and meditate for a whole day.”134Because of these words of the Conqueror, vajra words within the Supreme O riginal Buddha, such as those which teach the signs of smoke on the path of the mahamudra meditation, are very clear and arise neither through the transmission of masters nor by the blessing of the masters.135"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Primordial M ind and Body 71Therefore the profound meanings concealed in the hidden tantras are explained clearly in the O riginal B uddha Root T antra and Condensed Tantra, and it is not necessary to rely upon the explanations of masters that apply explanatory tantra to root tantra.This has been just a brief chapter on how the thinking of the highest yoga tantras is explained.

Three necessary conditions for the practice of such a path can be ascertained. They are: a basis for the path of practice, the actual path of practice, and the result of practice.The basis for the path to be practiced is ascertained as the external world and the sentient beings of the world. The actual path of practice is ascer­tained as the bestowing of initiation in order [48] to create suitable vessels for that path, followed secondly by the generation stage, which suppresses the manifest impurity of the basis for practice and ripens the mind for the creation of the completion stage that will totally uproot this impurity. Thirdly, the completion stage eradicates forever the impurities of the basis for practice. The paths of these initiations and of the generation and com­pletion stages along with the results of their practices fall under the head­ing of “other” within the three topics of Outer, Inner, and Other.The necessary conditions for the path of the intended disciples of the Sri Kalacakra are therefore ascertained as being the Outer, Inner, and Other, and with these in mind the chapters of the tantra are set at five. The Realms chapter mainly establishes the basis for practice in its form of the external world, while the Inner chapter mainly establishes the basis for practice in its form of the individual person. The Other, alongside its ancillary topics, comprises the conferring of initiations, the two paths of generation and completion, and the final goal. O f these, the conferring of initiations is mainly taught in the Initiation chapter. The Methods of Accomplishment chapter mainly establishes the generation stage as well as some aspects of the completion stage. The Gnosis chapter mainly establishes the completion stage and the stage of the final fruits of practice.The order of the themesThis has two outlines:1. A natural order2.

This is because the destruction of a previ­ous world brought about these subtle particles, which are known as empty particles and which exist as isolated fragments. Their coming together cre­ates a physical world from the air mandala up to Meru. This is the inter­mediate stage of creation. Sentient beings must be preceded by a previously created world realm, because a place for inhabitation is created first and is followed by the sentient beings who become its inhabitants. [49]The chapters that make up the Other are ascertained as those that teach initiations, the generation and completion stages, and the final result. The bestowing of worldly and nonworldly initiations must be preceded by sen­tient beings, because there must be disciples on whom the initiations are bestowed and masters who bestow them. The Other is primarily a similar- type cause of the form body of a buddha, and within it the generation stage is necessarily preceded by the bestowal of initiation, because those who enter the mandala without proper initiation will not become suitable ves­sels for the meditations of the generation stage.The completion stage, which results in the attainment of the siddhi of mahamudra gnosis freed from all conceptual meditation, has to be pre­ceded by the accomplishment of the generation stage, because the com­pleted generation stage ripens the mindstream, and without the path of ripening, the path of freedom— of a complete and proper completion stage—will not be developed.Therefore, as this is the natural order of things, this king of tantras in its five chapters sets out the outer, inner, and other in that order.An order arising from the mode of practiceBefore practicing the paths of generation and completion, the intended disciples of this tantra must know the external and internal bases of prac­tice. These, therefore, are ascertained first. The world external to oneself should be understood from an extensive explanation, and then the corre­sponding inner world of sentient beings should be understood. As the Tantra says: “As without, so within.”3 With these two bases of practice as prerequisites, one must become a suitable vessel for the two Other paths of the generation and completion stages through the process of proper initi­ation.

During this time the earth element is possessed of five qualities, namely smell, form, taste, tangibility, and sound. The water element has the above qualities, minus that of smell. The fire element has the above qual­ities, minus smell and form. The air element has the two qualities of tan­gibility and sound, while the space element possesses only the quality of sound. [51]During this time of emptiness the subtle particles of these five elements exist as isolated fragments and are not in any conventional sense objects of the sensory powers of the eye and so forth. They are known as empty p a r­ticles and remain isolated in empty space. When the potential of the col­lective karma of sentient beings is ripened, the subtle air particles come together to form air whose nature is light and moving. It is said that by this process we can come to know of extremely subtle and hidden airs. Similarly the subtle fire particles come together to become forms of fire, such as lightning possessed of air. The subtle water particles also amass to become forms of water, such as rain possessed of air and fire. The earth particles amass to become forms of earth, such as a rainbow possessed of air, fire, and water. The particles of the “taste” or space element pervade the other four source elements. This particular element of space is not unformed space but a formed space, whose presence separates forms from one another.These four elements gradually expand to form the four foundation mán­dalas— of air, fire, water, and earth—whose individual thicknesses are fifty thousand yojana and which are stacked as air surmounted by fire, water, and then earth.

Standing in the center of the earth mandala, Meru rises to a height of one hundred thousand yojana. Above its summit, in empty space and in the aspect of “mental form,” are Meru’s so-called neck, face, and crown. The height of the neck is twenty-five thousand yojana, the face fifty thousand yojana, and the crown twenty-five thousand yojana, making a distance of one hundred thousand yojana from the base of the throat to the top of the crown. Therefore the base of Meru to the top of the crown is two hundred thousand yojana. The distance from the center of the earth mandala on which Meru stands to any of the four cardinal points of the base of Meru, such as the eastern edge for example, is eight thousand yojana. Therefore, at its base, Meru is sixteen thousand yojana across.Surrounding Meru is a circular area extending outward for a distance of a thousand yojana. Beyond this circular area is an area stretching out to the edge of the Sita Mountains for a distance of sixteen thousand yojana. This distance is the limit of the overhang of the summit of Meru.5 This partic­ular area on the earth-mandala surface is divided into eighteen regions. Six continents, six seas, and six mountain ranges make up these regions. From the inner to the outer, the six continents are Candra, Sitabha, Kus'a, Kimnara, Kraunca, and Rudra. The six seas, from the inner to the outer, are known as Honey, Butter, Curd, Milk, Water, and Wine. The six moun­tain ranges, from the inner to the outer, are known as Nilabha, Mandara, Nisatha, Manikara, Drona, and Sita. The continent of Candra borders the terraces or immediate environs of Meru. Bordering the continent is the Honey Sea, and bordering the sea are the Nilabha Mountains. [53] Like­wise, the other continents, seas, and mountains are similarly arranged.The five inner mountains are of the same height as the Sita Mountains, and all six continents, seas, and mountains are of the same width. From the inner edge of the continent of Candra to the outer edge of the Sita Moun­tains is a distance of sixteen thousand yojana. As there are six mountain"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Formation o f the External World 81ranges, six continents, and six seas, this distance is to be divided by eight­een. This gives a figure of 888 yojana, three krosa, m i armspans, and ten fingerwidths. (To be even more detailed, 5 1/30 barley seeds should be added.) That is the width of each mountain range, continent, and sea.From the outer limit of the Sita Mountains to the inner rim of the water mandala is a distance of twenty-five thousand yojana. This area of the earth mandala is the seventh continent known as Greater Jambudvipa, the realm of karma. Directionally from Meru it is divided into twelve parts, known as the twelve sectors or continents.6 Outside of this, on the water mandala, is the seventh sea known as the Salt Ocean. Outside of this sea and on the fire mandala is the seventh mountain range, known as the Vajra Moun­tains, and the Fire of the Wild Mare’s Face.7The area of the twelve sectors stretches from the Sita Mountains to the water mandala for a distance of twenty-five thousand yojana. Its 12,500- yojana inner half is divided into six regions. In Lesser Jamb udvipa these are the lands of Himalaya, Kailash, China, Khotan, Tibet, and India. Regions of similar size also exist on the other eleven sectors.The mountains, continents, seas, and so forth that stretch out from the terraces or environs of Meru as far as the air mandala are in the forms of discs encircling Meru. Each is bound by a circumference that is three times its diameter.8 Therefore, three times the 400,000-yojana diameter of the air mandala is 1,200,000 yojana. This is the circumference of the air mandala. Three times the 300,000-yojana diameter fire mandala is 900,000 yojana. By using the same calculations for the other mandalas, the circumference of each can be known. [54]Between the air mandala and the crown of Meru are found the thirty- one existences. In the lower half of the 50,000-yojana-deep air mandala are the Vajra Flames hell and the Crying hell. In the upper half lies the Great Darkness hell. The air mandala, therefore, is home to three hell realms. Similarly, in the lower half of the fire mandala is found the Fire hell, and in the upper half is the Endless Smoke hell. These are hot hells, and they each plunge to a depth of twenty-five thousand yojana. Within the water mandala, the lower half contains the Swamps hell while the upper makes up the Sandy Water hell. These two are cold hells and also fall to a depth of twenty-five thousand yojana. The lower half of the earth mandala contains the Gravel Water hell. The upper half is the home of the asuras and the nagas. Both these realms are twenty-five thousand yojana from top to bottom, while their widths are coterminus with the earth mandala itself."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"82 Part i : The External WorldThe twelve sectors can be home for any of the realms of humans, ani­mals, and ghosts. This tantra and its commentaries do not speak of any spe­cial abodes for animals and ghosts. Greater Jambudvipa on the earth mandala is known as the realm of karma, while the six inner continents are known as realms of enjoyment.The Great Commentary says:“The thousands of yojana upon the earth are of mountains, nagas, planets, and directions.” This means that the size in yojana of these four mandalas of earth are “mountains,” mean­ing seven thousand, “nagas,” meaning eight thousand, “plan­ets,” meaning nine thousand, and “directions,” meaning ten thousand.9Again:“The air in the east is very round.” This means that a charac­teristic of the air mandala in the east is that it is very round, having the shape of the full moon.10There are many ways of explaining the meaning of these and other pas­sages, but the correct way is as follows. East, south, north, and west are respectively the realms of [55] air, fire, water, and earth. Because of this correspondence, the diameter of the eastern continent of Purvavideha is about seven thousand yojana, and its shape is circular like the full moon. (It is also described as having the shape of a half moon.)11 The central mass of the southern continent of Lesser Jambudvipa has a size of about eight thousand yojana and is triangular in shape. The central mass of the north­ern continent of Uttarakuru is about nine thousand yojana and is the shape of a half moon. (It is also described as being circular.) The central mass of the western continent of Aparagodanlya is about ten thousand yojana and is square-shaped. These shapes refer to their outline shapes and not to their shapes protruding from the earth.Concerning the gods of the desire realm, the Great Commentary says that “On Meru the gatherings of Indra, Brahma, and so forth,”12 thereby merely indicating the abodes of some of the gods of the desire realm, but these are not taught definitively. However Indra, king of the gods, and his"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Formation o f the External World 83retinue must live on Meru, and gods of the desire realm in their entirety must be posited as being spread throughout Meru and the lower third of the throat of Meru. Therefore it must be that of the six realms of the gods of desire, the four known as Using at Will Creations of Others, Magical Creations at Will, Joyful, and Free of Conflict are stacked upon the lower third of the throat of Meru. How high is each of these four realms? A third of the 25,000-yojana throat of Meru divided by four is 2,083 yojana, one kros'a, 6 6 6 armspans, two cubits, one finger and thumbspan, and four fin­gerwidths.W hat is the color and shape of Meru, home of some of the gods of desire? In the Gnosis chapter it says:This emperor of mountains, on the east is pure indranlla, on the south ruby, the west is yellow, the north, like the moon, is white crystal, the center is green.13As this quote indicates, the center, east, south, west, and north are green, blue, red, yellow, and white respectively. The shape of Meru is circular, and it has five horns that are slender at the base but with large tips. There are many differing assertions about these horns, but I will write of something approaching the truth. [56] The four lower circular horns girdle Meru like belts. The lowest horn hangs down like a platform as far as the outer rim of the immediate environs. The distance from the girdle of this lower horn to the peak of Meru is divided into four equal parts, and from the cusp of each of the first three parts a horn arches down. The girdling of these horns becomes progressively larger, like small bowls mounted by successively larger bowls. The topmost horn is at the level of the summit of Meru, spreading out into all directions and reaching down to touch the peaks of the Sita Mountains. Included within the covering of the four upper horns are the six continents, six seas, and five mountain ranges.The diameter across the summit of Meru is fifty thousand yojana. In the Great Commentary it says:The size of the upper surface of Meru is fifty thousand between the east and west, north and south.14"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84 Part 1: The External WorldAnd:Above, five points15 reach out to the surfaces and in all directions to the environs also. “Outside of that the continents, moun­tains,” means that outside the environs of Meru, within the cov­ering of the four tips, are the six continents.16These quotes also explain the point well.The throat of Meru, from the top of its lower third to the upper limit of the throat, is divided into four parts. These are known as the realms o f the w hite eon and are the form realms Sphere of Brahma, Chanting in the Presence of Brahma, Great Realm of Brahma, and Little Light. Similarly the 50,000-yojana face of Meru is divided into three parts, and each part is 16,666 yojana, two krosa, 1,333 armspans, one cubit, and eight finger­widths. These three parts are known as the chin, nose, and forehead of Meru. The bottom of the chin to the nose is divided into four parts. These four are known as the glorious eon and comprise the form realms Limitless Light, Illuminating Light, Little Virtue, and Limidess Virtue. The lower limit of [57] the nose to the lower limit of the forehead, known as beyond the world o f Brahma, is in four parts comprising the realms Vast Virtue, Without Cloud, Creation of Merit, and Great Fruition. Similarly the area from the lower limit of the forehead to the base of the crown is divided into four parts known as the eon o f Brahma, comprising the realms Lesser, Untroubled, Farsighted, and None Higher.The base of the crown to its tip is also divided into four parts. These are known as the eon o f p u re dharm a and comprise the formless realms, namely Source of Limitless Space, Source of Limitless Consciousness, Source of Nothingness, and Source of No Recognition Yet No Nonrecognition. On the formless realms the Great Commentary says:“Pure dharma” refers to the formless existence. “Eon” refers to the length of time the gods remain there.17The form realms can be understood similarly.Each of the formless realms, therefore, measures 6,250 yojana from top to bottom. Each of the sixteen form realms, from its upper to its lower limit, measures 4,166 yojana, two kroia, 1,333 armspans, one cubit, and eight fingerwidths."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Formation o f the External World 85If the four formless realms are actually positioned above the form realm of None Higher, and if these four are also arranged above and below each other, then migration from an existence such as the desire realm to the formless realm would require a bardo existence. This is because, between the state of death in the desire realm and the taking of birth in realms above None Higher, which begin at 175,000 yojana above the earth, there must be a continuation between death in one state and birth in another in the form of an intermediate state, “like the growth of corn.”18 However this cannot be accepted. The Abhidharma teachings and commentaries state that birth in the formless realms requires no bardo. So what is the think­ing behind the statement that the four formless realms are positioned above the form realm of None Higher and are also arranged on top of one another? [58] These doubts do occur. However I will write a little in order to dispel them.“The formless is at the place of death.”19 This quote from the A b h i- dhamakosa explains that when migrating from the two lower realms to the formless realms, rebirth occurs at the very place of death. Therefore, to take birth in the formless realm, an intermediate continuum of a bardo between the state of birth and the previous death state is not necessary. Because of this the Abhidharma teachings say that for birth in the formless realms, there is no bardo. It is true that if the formless realms were actually above the realm of None Higher and were stacked on top of one another, then taking birth in a formless realm would necessarily require a bardo existence. However the reason for the assertion in this tantra and its com­mentaries that the four formless realms are above None Higher and are stacked on top of each other is that, just as there are levels of birth for the sentient beings of the three realms, so there are levels of birthplaces. On that basis to say, “I will attain this level” is to give these realms their own meas­urable status by positing them in space above the form realms, which is then used for the practice of outer and inner correspondence. However, in actuality, and as it is stated in the Abhidharm akosa, four formless realms divided into higher and lower and positioned above and beyond None Higher are not accepted.There is, however, an alternative explanation. The teachings of the Abhidharma and so forth, which state that birth in the formless realms has no preceding intermediate state, rest upon the premise that a being of the formless realm is without form. As it says, “Because there is no form, there is formlessness.”20 Therefore, in the thinking of the Perfection Vehicle,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"86 Part i: The External Worldsentient beings of the formless realms are without form. However the posi­tion of highest tantra is that beings of the formless realms do have form, because according to the tantras and commentaries of Guhyasamaja and others, every sentient being possesses the very subtle mind and the very sub- de wind. Moreover, this subde wind is explained as being of five-colored light rays. Therefore, not only do beings of the formless realms possess the aggregate of form, they also possess source forms such as blue, yellow, and so forth.Moreover, in the Kdlacakra Tantra and its commentaries, [59] it is explained that these beings also possess the subde particles of the five ele­ments. In the Gnosis chapter, in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary, it says:The bodies of those of the formless realms are of the element of emptiness, as mere potentials within the mind and of the qual­ity of sound.21This says that the bodies of formless beings possess sound alone as their primary quality and are of the nature of the space element. The quote continues:Moreover fluid is without earth, water, fire, air, smell, form, taste, and tangibility.22This states that the fluid of beings of the formless realms does not possess in primary form the elements of earth, water, fire, and air, as well as the four element-derived forms. The quote continues:The primary qualities of these four, earth and so forth, exist as mere general qualities. W ithout a collection of qualities, the potentialities of samsara would not arise from one quality alone.23This explains that earth, water, fire, and air together with their qualities of form and so forth are present in the fluid drop of formless beings as qual­ities in general form only. This means that the four elements, their sense forms, and the subtle particle of fluid are to be understood as being in minuscule form. Also, in the explanations of tantras such as the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Formation o f the External World 87Guhyasamaja, the indestructible red and white elements of the very subtle mind and wind exist together as a single unit, which has been present in the mindstreams of all beings without a moment of interruption since begin- ningless time. “Indestructible” means nothing can destroy it.Therefore, although beings of formless realms are said to be without form by the sutra tradition, it is the position of this tantra, the Great Com­mentary, as well as other highest tantras, that they do possess form. Simi­larly it is correct to accept as literal the statement that the four formless realms are above None Higher and are stacked one on top of another. O th­erwise I would have to wonder how it could not be contradictory to accept as literal the other glaring differences with the Abhidharma tradition, such as the general size and shape of the world as being four hundred thousand yojana, the length of time spent in the hells, and so on. [60] Which of the two above explanations is the more valid is something to be examined.Having explained in detail the size, divisions, and so forth of our four- continent world realm, a little of the situation outside of that world will be explained. The Great Commentary says:“Outside of that, only emptiness, no three worlds, no qualities, lacking all these.” This means that outside the air mandala, at the bottom and the crown at the top, is only emptiness. This emptiness is solely an entity of individual particles of the five elements.24Therefore, below the lower limit of the air mandala and above the upper limit of the crown, the subtle particles of the five elements of earth and so forth exist as individual and disconnected particles undetectable to the senses of ordinary beings. This is known as mere emptiness and appears as empty space. On the strength of this explanation, we can understand that beyond this four-continent world in the eight directions also lies the empty space of the disconnected particles of the five elements known as total emptiness. (Some scholars maintain the size of this emptiness of uncon­nected particles outside this world realm to be a hundred thousand yojana. They base this measurement on the Gnosis chapter, where it mentions the size of the world to be five hundred thousand yojana. They assert that the purpose is to include the one-cubit part of the body not grasped by con­sciousness, such as the nails and hair, as part of the basis of purification.) Existence outside of this total emptiness of disconnected and individual"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88 Part i: The External Worldparticles is spoken of in the Gnosis chapter in the Supreme and Unchang­ing Gnosis summary:“One thousand” means that above and below the center of this sahiz25 world realm are a thousand each. As above and below, so it is in the east, west, north, south, the unreal, the powerful, the air, and fire.26 It is the same with the two and three thousand. Therefore, the great thousand refers to these countless world realms.27[61] Therefore, with this saha world of ours as the center, there are a thou­sand four-continent worlds in each of the ten directions, and these worlds make up the thousand-world realm. Two thousand worlds at each of the ten directions, including the worlds of the thousand-world realm, make up the two thousand, or intermediate, world realm. Three thousand worlds at each of the ten directions, including the previous world realms, make up the three-thousand-world realm. The great thousand-world realm includes all these worlds and encompasses countless world realms. Therefore, although there are those (such as the great scholar Chomden Rikral)28 who state that the Kdlacakra Tantra and its commentaries omit mention of the three thousands, they have not investigated this.It is said that a world realm is four hundred thousand yojana across. But what is the length of a yojana? In the Condensed Tantra it says:Eight most subtle make one subtle.Eight of the subtle make up the fine tip of a hair.29Therefore, according to this and further quotes, the ultimate diminution of form is the very subtle particle, and eight of them strung together is the linear measurement of one subde particle. A string of eight subtle particles is the width of a hair at its tip. Eight hairbreadths are one black mustard seed, eight mustard seeds are one louse, eight lice make one barley grain, and eight such grains are one fingerwidth. Twenty-four fingerwidths are one cubit, four cubits are one armspan, two thousand armspans are one kro&t, and four kros'a make one yojana.30This tantra and its commentaries do not deal a lot with other worlds but concentrate on the presentation of the dimensions of this world. The rea­son for this is spoken of in the Great Commentary:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Formation o f the External World 89And so, with omniscient knowledge, in order to ripen the rsi, the Conqueror spoke of the dimensions of the world and the dimensions of the body for the purpose of the mandala.31[62] The reasons, therefore, are firstly to bring about correspondence between the inner world of the practitioners body and the outer world, which form the two bases for purification in the deity mandala medita­tion, and secondly to bring about correspondence between these two bases of purification and the mandala itself, which is the actual purifier.The dimensions of the outer world, therefore, are given to correspond with the dimensions of the body. From the lower limit that is the base of the air mandala to the tip of the crown of Meru is a distance of four hun­dred thousand yojana. This corresponds to the distance of four cubits from the soles of the feet to the crown of the head of a person. The distance across the air mandala from rim to rim is four hundred thousand yojana. This corresponds to the distance of four cubits between the fingertips of the right hand and the fingertips of the left. From the lower limit of the air mandala to the base of Meru is a distance of two hundred thousand yojana, corresponding to the two-cubit distance between the soles of the feet and the hips.The lower limit of the air mandala to the base of Meru is divided into seven hell locations32 and one naga realm, each realm occupying a quarter of a hundred thousand, or twenty-five thousand, yojana. This corresponds to the distance of two cubits between the hips and the soles of the feet, which is divided into eight sections, each section being a quarter of a cubit or six fingerwidths. Meru itself is one hundred thousand yojana. This cor­responds to the spine, which stretches the distance of one cubit from the hips to the base of the throat.The four desire realms, Free of Conflict and so forth, and the first four form realms of Sphere of Brahma and so forth stretch for twenty-five thou­sand yojana up the throat of Meru. This corresponds to the measurement of the throat, which is a quarter of a cubit or six fingerwidths. From Lim- idess Light to None Higher upon the face of Meru is a distance of half of one hundred thousand yojana, corresponding to the distance of half a cubit, or twelve fingerwidths, from the base of the chin to the upper limit of the forehead.

This corresponds to the measurement of half a cubit, or twelve finger­widths, from the center of the chest to the edge of the right shoulder. The thickness of the water mandala on the right of Meru is half one hundred thousand, or fifty thousand, yojana. This corresponds to the half cubit, or twelve-fingerwidth, length of the right upper arm. Similarly the thickness of the fire mandala on the right side of Meru is fifty thousand yojana, cor­responding to the half cubit, or twelve fingerwidth, length of the right fore­arm from the wrist to the elbow. The thickness of the air mandala on the right of Meru is half one hundred thousand, or fifty thousand, yojana.

My opinion is that the eons used to measure the life spans of the four arya abodes from the Lesser to None Higher must be supreme eons, and those used to meas­ure the life spans of the other form realms must be intermediate eons.But aren’t the terms “supreme eon” and “great eon” synonyms?

In this section on the life spans of gods and so forth, the tantra is not clear on this ques­tion. However, when explaining how the very subtle breath is used for cal­culating the length of days, the Great Commentary says:“Subtle” means that one inhalation and one exhalation of a human breath divided into six hundred more than 21,000 is one subtle breath.37"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94 Part I: The External WorldThis and further quotes reveal the answers to this question. This is because one breath of a human is divided into 21,600 parts. One such part is the length of one breath of a fully formed insect. 21,600 of such insect breaths is one of its days, thirty of such days are a month, twelve such months are one year, and one hundred of its years is the life span of a tiny insect.Similarly thirty human breaths are equal to one breath of a ghost, and 21,600 of such breaths is one ghost day. Thirty of its days are a month, twelve months are a year, and one hundred of its years is the life span of a ghost. One human day is the length of one asura breath. 21,600 such breaths are one asura day, thirty days one month, twelve months one year, and one hundred such years the life span of the asura. 21,600 human breaths make up one human day, and one hundred human years is the human life span. Generally these life spans are those of a complete life and depict maximum life span, but they are not fixed. The Great Commentary says:Likewise 777,600,000 breaths are one hundred days38 and one hundred years. Depending on karma, this complete life span could be more or could be less. For the yogis, by the power of their yoga and by the power of the meditative concentration of their asceticism, it will be more, and one breath will become hours. For those of nonvirtue, [67] by the force of their non­virtue, it will become less.39One human year is equal to one breath of the s'akti40 of None Higher, and the 21,600 human years, which is the length of RudracakrI’s establishment of the four ages in the twelve sectors, are equal to one breath of those in the formless realm Source of No Recognition Yet No Nonrecognition, who are referred to here by the name prakrti. If that is so, it may be assumed that 21,600 of such breaths equal one day in each of these realms and so on, thereby arriving, as in previous examples, at the hundred-year life span of None Higher and Peak of Existence.

The lives of the gods of None Higher, Peak of Existence, and the desire realm are far longer than a hundred of their own years, as has been previously explained. In the Great Commentary it says:From these measurements, the measurements of the sakti, which are the measurements of the gods of None Higher, correspond to the four ages of Rudracakri on the earth.47The measurements of a breath and a day in None Higher are taught in order to know the length of the four ages of Rudracakri and therefore are mentioned here for a different purpose.The life spans of the hells and other realms are measured in different types of eons. But how long are these eons? The Great Commentary says:Concerning the divisions of a short eon, a pit one yojana wide and one deep is completely filled with tiny tips of hair. In a hundred years a hair tip is taken out. The time taken for the pit to be emptied is one day of one short eon. Thirty of those days are a month, twelve of those months are a year, and one hun­dred years is said to be one eon. [68] Likewise, a group of those eons is one intermediate eon, and a group of those is one supreme eon.48Therefore a four-sided pit with length, width, and depth of one yojana is filled with round tips of hair. Every one hundred years one hair is removed until there are no more. The time taken for the pit to be emptied is one day of one short eon. 360 of those days make a year, and one hundred such years is the measurement of one short eon. A group of such eons forms one intermediate eon, and a group of intermediate eons forms one supreme eon. A group of supreme eons makes up one great eon.But what amount of hair is in this pit, and how many human years make up a short eon? That, too, can be explained. The number of hairwidths lined up to make one yojana has been expressed as follows:"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"96 Part i: The External WorldSpace, emptiness, space, naga, eyes, mountain, sense organ, mind, and fire.49This number multiplied by itself will give the number of hairs making up a single hairwidth layer of hair in the pit.

This is expressed as:From the position of nine drops, eyes, arrows, fire, naga, taste, naga, ocean, naga, fire, conqueror, taste, and space, naga, naga, naga, sun, moon, fire.52This is the number of hairs, which multiplied by a hundred gives the num­ber of human years that make up one day of a short eon. This is expressed as:From the position of eleven drops, eyes, arrows, fire, naga, taste, naga, ocean, naga, fire, conqueror, taste, and space, naga, naga, naga, sun, moon, fire.This figure multiplied by 360 gives, in human years, the length of one year of a short eon, and one hundred short-eon years is the length of one short eon.

There are two schools of thought on this. According to the new Jonang translation and the Shong55 transla­tion as quoted above, “Likewise, a group of those eons is one intermediate eon, and a group of those is one supreme eon.” Here group means a math­ematical grouping, and in the fourth summary of the Gnosis chapter it says “a two group is four” and “a three group is nine,” and so on, until “a nine group is eighty-one and a ten group is one hundred.”56 Therefore each number is multiplied by itself to form a “group.” In this way the hundred years of a short eon is multiplied by a hundred to make ten thousand short- eon years. This is the length of an intermediate eon. These ten thousand years are multiplied by ten thousand to make a hundred million. This is the number of short-eon years in a supreme eon. That one hundred million multiplied by one hundred million gives, in short-eon years and by using another numeration system, the seventeenth numeric unit57 or m ahd­kamkara. This is the length of one great eon.Concerning the second school of thought, in many translations it says:Similarly, to replicate using the measurements of that category is to arrive at the length of an intermediate eon. Similarly, to replicate using the measurements of an intermediate eon is to arrive at the length of a supreme eon.The Ra translations also state:A multiplication of that group will form an intermediate eon. A multiplication of a group of intermediate eons will form a supreme eon.In this way of thinking, every hundred short-eon years a single hair is pulled from a pit filled with hairs as previously detailed, until the pit is emptied. This would be the length of one day of an intermediate eon.

If every hundred intermediate-eon years one hair was pulled from the pit, one day of a supreme eon would have passed. A hun­dred such years is the duration of a supreme eon. [70] This is spoken of in the commentary Illu m in a tin g Reality.If these measurements of eons are to be understood by using systems of enumeration, then what are the numerical units? Such knowledge will be necessary in other contexts and so will be explained. There are two tradi­tions of enumeration. The first is from the Abhidharma commentaries and is explained by the scholar Sàntipa58 in his Commentary on the Compendium o f Sütra. In it he says:The different names of the numbers are taught in the Abhi­dharma. Numerical units are solitary and coupled. Solitary numerical units are, eka, dasa, satam , sahasram, prabhedah, laksam, atilaksam , koti, m adhyaP These are the nine solitary numerical units. There are three divisions of coupled numerical units. They are ayuta, nayuta, prasuta, kam kara, bim bara, aksobhya, viva., utsamgah, and vdhana. These nine together with their nine “greater” units make up the first division of coupled units. Titibha, hetu, karabha, indra, samdpta, gati, nimbaraja, mudra, and balam, together with their “greater” units make up the nine numerical units of the second division of coupled units. Samjñd, vibhüta, and baldksam make up, together with their respective “greater” units, the third division of coupled units. Therefore, the nine solitary and the forty-two numerical units that make up the three divisions of the coupled units together total fifty-one. These appear in the Abhidharma. The remain­ing eight numerical units do not appear in the text. However adding them to the category of coupled units makes fifty-nine. These fifty-nine have been given the name “numbers.” The six­tieth is said to be apart from these names and is known as asamkhydm. This has been taught by the master Vasubandhu.60As this quote explains, there are sixty numerical units. Each unit has its own name, and the sixtieth is known as asam khydm P Moreover each cou­pled unit consists of the unit and its greater unit, as in ayuta and mahdyutah, for example. This doubling up is repeated for the others."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Inhabitants o f This World 99The second tradition is that taken from the sutras62 [71] and is also explained by the scholar Sántipa in his Commentary on the Compendium o f Sutra.

Virtuous throwing karma together with the pow­erful completing karma of giving are causes for birth as an asura.65 Virtu­ous throwing karma alongside either virtuous or nonvirtuous completing karma results in birth as a human. Virtuous throwing karma coupled with the completing karma of powerful acts of giving together with the force of mantra recitation results in birth as a god of the desire realm.

Simi­larly, for birth in the formless realms, the preparatory meditative equipoise for each realm becomes the throwing karma, and the actual absorption is the completing karma. However, if this is true, the Great Commentary says:By the force of morality and by the meditative concentration ofextinction by air69 and so forth, the sixteen form realms, such asNone Higher, will come to be.70This and further quotes explain that from the meditation of extinction by earth comes birth in the Sphere of Brahma and the following three form realms. From the meditation of extinction by water arises birth in Limit­less Light and the next three form realms. From the meditation of extinc­tion by fire comes birth in Vast Virtue and the following three form realms. From the meditation of extinction by air comes birth in the Lesser and the following three form realms. And from the meditation of extinction by space arises the four formless realms. Does this not contradict the previous explanation? There is no contradiction here, for although extinction by earth and so forth are used as terminology for the causal meditative equipoises of the form and formless realms, it is not the thinking of the Great Commentary that the meditative equipoises of the ten extinctions,71 such as extinction by earth and so forth, are necessary causes for birth in the form and formless realms. If this were the Great Commentary s thinking, then it would mistakenly follow that it was also the Great Commentary s thinking that birth in these two higher realms would necessarily entail entering the teachings of the Buddha and the paths of the Buddha, and that without casting aside non-Buddhist philosophy it would impossible to gain birth in these higher realms.How are the terms extinction by earth and so forth used for the causal meditative equipoise of the absorptions and the formless realms?

Similarly the throwing and completing meditative equipoises for birth in Limitless Light, Illuminating Light, Little Virtue, and Limitless Virtue extinguish the desires found in their respective lower levels and are there­fore extinctions. The element is water, and they are therefore extinctions by water.The throwing and completing meditative equipoises for the four realms beginning with Vast Virtue, the four realms commencing with the Lesser, and for the four formless realms commencing with Source of Limitless Space also extinguish the desires of their respective lower levels and are known as extinctions. Because their elements are, respectively, fire, air, and space, they are therefore known as extinctions by fire, air, and space.W hat is the purpose of referring to these preparatory meditative equipoises, or throwing karmas, and actual meditative equipoises, or com­pleting karmas, not by their own names but as extinctions by earth and so forth? There is a special purpose in this. In Kalacakra thinking all phe­nomena are ascertained by their being in the nature of the five elements. With this in mind the causal meditative equipoise absorptions that produce the sixteen form realms categorized in sets of four are to be understood as being primarily of the elements of earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, while the causal equipoises that produce the formless realms are to be understood as being of the element of space. Furthermore the reason that these causal equipoises are not mentioned by name, but are taught using terms such as extinction by earth and so forth, is to make it clear that in order to migrate to the form and formless realms, the manifest desires lack­ing in each destination must first be extinguished.The seed syllables that produce the thirty-one realms are mentioned in the Realms chapter:The four formless are a and so forth,separate from the two of ha.71i and so forth are the sixteen of form.ha and so forth are clear as being the ten of desiretogether with the one consonant ksa.Therefore, the seeds of the formless realms are, a., a, am, and dh.

Therefore this will be explained. In the Gnosis chap­ter of the Great Commentary, in the fourth summary, it says:Now the birth houses are spoken of as Aries and so forth. The moon, Venus, and the sun arose in Aries, Gemini, and Cancer respectively. Mars was born in Leo, Jupiter in Virgo, Rahu in Libra, Mercury in Scorpio, Saturn at the beginning of Sagittar­ius, and Ketu in the last.74Therefore, in the beginning, the lunar mansions, houses, and the other stars were formed. Then the sun was born in the beginning of the house of Cancer. This marked the first actual year, and the sun became the ruler of the solar days.The sun then moved counterclockwise, occupying the different lunar mansions, until it arrived at the beginning of the lunar mansion of asvini. In asvini the sun arrived direcdy in line with the meridian of the central sec­tor of the east, and there, simultaneously, the moon was born in asvini. Therefore it is explained that the moon was born in Aries.75 At the same"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"io6 Part i: The External Worldtime, the first lunar day began,76 the first light of the moon was born, and it was the beginning of that particular solar day. The moon became the ruler of that day, and the first karana year77 began. Because of this, Aries is posited [76] as the first of the houses, asvini as the first of the lunar man­sions, the waxing is posited as the first of the two halves of the month, and because the lunar mansion on the fifteenth day of that moon was citra, the month of that name78 was posited as the first of the months.From then on until Mars was born, the sun and the moon alternated in their rule over the days. The sun then arrived at the beginning of the lunar mansion magha within Leo. In magha the sun arrived directly in line with the meridian of the central eastern sector. At the same time Mars was born in the lunar mansion magha and became ruler of that day. The following day was ruled by the sun, and until Mercury was born, the sun, moon, and Mars rotated their lordship over the days.The sun continued in its counterclockwise occupation of the lunar man­sions and arrived at the halfway point of the lunar mansion anuradha within Scorpio. There, in anuradha, it arrived directly in line with the meridian of the central eastern sector. Simultaneously Mercury was born in anuradha to become ruler of that day. The following day the sun ruled, and in this way, until Jupiter was born, these four planets79 rotated in their ruling of the days.As it had done previously, the sun continued to occupy the lunar man­sions until it arrived at the beginning of the lunar mansion hasta in Virgo. In hasta it arrived directly in line with the meridian of the central eastern sector. Simultaneously Jupiter was born in hasta and became ruler of the day on which it was born. The following day the sun ruled, and until the birth of Venus, these five ruled the days by rotation.The sun then reached the beginning of the lunar mansion punarvasu in Gemini. Together with punarvasu the sun arrived directly in line with the center of the central eastern sector, and at the same time Venus was born in punarvasu, where it became ruler of the day in which it was born. The following day was ruled by the sun, and until Saturn was born, these six planets ruled, in order, successive days. [77]Likewise Saturn was born at the beginning of the lunar mansion mula within Sagittarius. Therefore, when the sun together with mula arrived directly in line with the center of the central eastern sector, Saturn was born, and the ensuing process was as described above.The reason why the planets must have been born in this order is that,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 107firstly, they could not have been born at the same time, because it is taught that they each had different birth houses and birth lunar mansions, and all seven alternating planets were born directly in line with the center of the central eastern sector. They were, therefore, born successively.The order of the planets is taught as beginning with the sun and ending with Saturn. This is the order of birth, and is not the order found in the explanations from the chapters on the Other Kalacakra or in the order of practice. Furthermore the term alternating planets refers to their alternat­ing lordship of successive days, which in turn is decided by order of plan­etary birth, hence the term alternating planets.Moreover the birthplace of the planets is directly above the center of the central eastern sector, and it can be known that they were born while the sun was there also by the fact that the changeover time for the alter­nating planets directly at the center of the central eastern sector is at dawn from the standpoint of the direct center of the central southern sector.80These planets are enemies to each to other. The Great Commentary says:Similarly, to clarify once more: “They fight with each other and are enemies.” This means that there are the peaceful and the wrathful. Mercury and Mangala,81 Jupiter and Venus, Saturn and Ketu— these fight each other and are enemies.82The houses of Aries and Scorpio are the dominion of Mars, and if Mercury occupies these houses when he is dwelling in them, Mars and Mercury will fight. Similarly Mercury has dominion over Gemini and Virgo, and if Mars enters while he dwells there, Mars and Mercury will fight. The houses of Sagittarius and Pisces are the dominion of Jupiter, and if Venus enters while Jupiter is dwelling there, [78] then Venus and Jupiter will fight. The dominions of Venus are the houses of Taurus and Libra, and if Jupiter should enter, these two planets will fight. Saturn has dominion over Capri­corn and Aquarius, and if Ketu enters, Saturn and Ketu83 will fight. Moon’s dominion is Cancer, and when Saturn enters, the moon and Ketu combine to cause trouble for Saturn.Similarly trouble not only occurs when an enemy enters the dominion of another. Should an enemy appear in the birth lunar mansion of another, then those two will fight. This occurs when the planets gather as friends and enemies in each other’s birth lunar mansions. In other houses and lunar mansions, mutual enemies will gather but will not fight."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"io8 Part i: The External WorldConcerning the way the planets orbit and occupy the twelve houses, all the stars, lunar mansions, and planets are themselves propelled by the power of the gola84 winds. This movement is known as gola w in d movement and is solely a clockwise motion around Meru, at no time varying in its reg­ularity. Concerning the individual movements of the planets, all planets except Râhu and Kâlâgni occupy the houses and lunar mansions in a coun­terclockwise motion by incremental steps. Concerning how they occupy the houses and lunar mansions, the progressive early steps and regressive later steps of the slow stages of the five planets and the sun are décrémen­tai, and the regressive early steps and progressive later steps are incremen­tal.85 When the five planets arrive in their own birth sign, all increment and decrement in the slow stages is canceled out. The progressive early steps and the regressive later steps of the fast stages of the five planets are incremental, while the regressive early steps and progressive later steps are décrémentai. When the step index is at zero, all increment and decrement in the fast steps are canceled out, and any of the five planets whose index is zero has disappeared into the sun and is conjunct with the sun.When any of the five planets gather at their individual birth signs con­junct [79] with the sun, any increment and decrement in both fast and slow stages is canceled out. Therefore, within the period of time from the birth of a planet until it again becomes conjunct with the sun in its own birth sign can be found the imprint86 of its fixed or mean motion. There­fore fixed motion is the averaged-out planetary orbit through the complete circle of lunar mansions. The fixed motion of the three kinds of days for each of the planets is found by dividing a planetary orbit in terms of its three kinds of days among the 1,620 hours of the lunar mansions.87The appearance and disappearance of the five planets is to be under­stood in terms of the sun, because a planet separate from the sun is visible to the eye, while a planet conjunct with the sun is not. The Great Com­mentary says:Now the text speaks of the appearance and disappearance of planets. “Whatever planets dwell within the tenancy of the sun will definitely disappear.” By the rays of the sun it will not be seen, and is said to have disappeared. However such a planet has not completely disappeared.88"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 109Also:“Abandoning the sun, it will rise.” By the power of its own movement, the planet that has set will leave the sun and rise, because it has left the rays of the sun.89Similarly, when the peaceful planets Venus, Ketu, and Mercury set into the sun, they set from the left of the sun, and when they rise they do so also from the left. The wrathful planets— Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn— rise and set from the right of the sun. Similarly, when peaceful and wrathful plan­ets meet, the wrathful will pass to the right of the peaceful, and the peace­ful will pass to the left of the wrathful.Rahu was born in Libra in the lunar mansion of citra while Kalagni was born in the lunar mansion revati, and from the time of their birth they occupy the houses or lunar mansions in clockwise motion. The Rahu head to his Kalagni tail covers half the house and lunar-mansion circle in a coun­terclockwise direction. The number of lunar mansions [80] and degree hours to appear in the chart of the body of Rahu are counted backward from the lunar mansion revati, while the numbers that appear in the charts of the head and tail are counted forward from the lunar mansion aivinl.The Condensed Tantra and the commentary talk in general terms about how Rahu engages the moon at the times of full moon and no moon, but these are not discussed in depth.90 In order to understand how Rahu engages with the sun and moon, it is important to know how Rahu orbits. The Great Commentary states:“Moving to the left and not to the right.” This means that Rahu moves to the left and not to the right, and that it grasps the moon from its left.And:“To the right,” means moving to the right and grasping the moon from its right.91This, and Rahu’s self-orbiting around Meru and through the lunar man­sions, is all the Great Commentary mentions on this topic, and it does not"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"n o Part i: The External Worldexpound on any left and right movements. These are explained by reference to the Root Tantra and to karana astronomy. The Great Commentary states:Know that this is due to Rahus orbits.

The Great Commentary says:In the circle of houses, every planet travels south and north. The sun, for example, occupies the lunar mansions and the six houses.94Therefore every planet has its northward and southward passages. [81]How the stars and planets orbit the skiesThis is under two outlines:1. Examination of the assertions of others2. Presentation of our own positionExamination of the assertions of others The Great Commentary says:“South from the center of the gola, the bow-shaped houses of time,95 dwelling in the fire mandala.” This means that from thecenter of the gola chart drawn at the time of equal day andnight, the bow-shaped formation of six houses, half of the circle"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets inof stars, dwell in the south. “In the north, the Sita Mountains and, like fine lotus petals, Aries in the east, Libra, and so forth.”This means that just as in the south the six houses dwell within half the circle of stars, similarly, north from the center of the gola chart, there dwell, by division, six houses. “Aries in the east,Libra, and so forth” means that it stretches as far as Virgo. Sim­ilarly Libra and the others reach as far as Pisces.96According to most scholars, the meaning of this passage from the Great Commentary, which incorporates citations from the Condensed Tantra, is the following. From here in the central southern sector on the morning of the spring equinox, the sun is in Aries above the skies of the eastern sector. These skies are divided into northern and southern parts. This division stretches across to the western sector, where the skies are also divided north and south. From this dividing line and above Meru, a chart is projected with the mind. In the northern part of the chart, in the eastern section97 of the east, is Aries. In the northeast is Taurus. The north is in two parts. To the west of the north is Gemini, and in the half of the north to the east dwells Cancer. In the northwest is Leo. The west is also in two parts. In its west­ern half lies Virgo. These are the six houses of the north. Similarly, in the eastern half of the west is Libra. In the southwest is Scorpio. The south is in two parts. In the western part is Sagittarius and in the eastern part, Capri­corn. In the southeast is Aquarius, and in the western half of the east lies Pisces. The houses from the Libra to Pisces are the six houses of the south.Furthermore, in this mentally constructed chart projected from the skies above Meru, [82] which is the midway point between the skies directly above the eastern sector and the skies directly above the western sector, the six northern houses from Aries to Virgo are said to be in the shape of fine lotus petals, and the six southern houses from the Libra to Pisces are said to be arranged in the shape of a bow. This is explained as being the mean­ing of the phrases “like fine lotus petals” and “the bow-shaped houses of time,” as found in the tantra and its commentary.This explanation is incorrect. When the sun is in Aries directly above the central meridian of the central eastern sector on the morning of the spring equinox at the central meridian of the central southern sector, and the houses are arranged upon their paths over the twelve sectors, it is true that the six houses of the north are of the shape of lotus petals.

At that time the six houses of the south are in the formation of a bow. Therefore the thinking behind the passage from the tantra and commentary is that it should be applied to both the beginning and the end of the day. However I cannot see this as being valid, because the statement from the Great Commentary that the six houses of the north are arranged as lotus petals and the six of the south are in the formation of a bow refers to an event happening at one particular time.Furthermore, all those who follow the above traditions say that in the chart (mentioned in the phrase “from the center of the gola chart drawn at the time of equal day and night”) that is projected in the skies above Meru from the eastern sector across to the western sector, the six houses arranged in the north of that chart are north of Meru, and the six houses placed in the south of the chart are south of Meru. To posit this as the meaning of the commentary and tantra passage beginning “South from the center of the gola, the bow-shaped houses of time” is completely incorrect. What the commentary is saying is that a circular gola chart of the twelve houses is to be bisected, and six houses placed in the northern section. This depic­tion reaches the Sita Mountains, as in the phrase “In the north the Sita Mountains.” [83] Sue houses are placed in the south, and these are depicted as reaching the Mountains of Fire, as in the sentence, “South from the cen­ter of the gola, the bow-shaped houses of time, dwelling in the fire man­dala.” If the arrangement were as you have stated above, the outer edge of petal-shaped formation in the north would reach to the Mountains of Fire, and the northern part of the bow-shaped formation would reach to the regions of the Šita Mountains. This would be completely outside the mean­ing of quotes from the tantra and commentary, such as those beginning “South from the center of the gola, the bow-shaped houses of time.”Therefore it must be that the depiction of the six houses of the north meets the depiction of Sita Mountains directly in line with our central south­ern sector, and the depiction of the six houses of the south meets the depic­tion of the Mountains of Fire also directly in line with our central southern sector.

An explanation of the term gola as a way of understanding the path of the twelve houses above our Lesser Jambudvipa2. By understanding the above, how it is possible to understand the orbiting of the gola over each of twelve sectorsAn explanation of the term golaGola is a transliteration of a Sanskrit word. If it were translated into Tibetan, it could be rendered as cylindrical, interior, round, and uneven in height. Here it means round,103 and the spherical orbiting by the circle of lunar mansions over the twelve sectors is known as the gola o f the houses. The way to understand this gola is from the circular charts drawn on paper and described in the tantra and its commentary with quotes such as:In the center, from asvini up to to half of citrd,104 the gola chart of the equinox of day and night.[85] These charts, therefore, are also known as gola."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 115The meaning of such quotes beginning “South from the center of the gola, the bow-shaped houses of time” is expressed in charts drawn on paper, and through them the path of the houses over our Lesser Jambudvipa can be understood. First a diagram105 is drawn to depict the water mandala and the twelve sectors between the Šita Mountains and the Mountains of Fire, as previously described. Then, from the midway point between the Sita Mountains that directly face the central point of the depiction of Lesser Jambudvipa, the central sector of the south, to the depiction of the fire mandala, a circle is drawn to illustrate the circular skies above this central point. This is the meaning of the term gola chart. Then this circle is bisected directly along its east-west diameter to illustrate the path of the sun on the equinox at the central meridian of this sector. This diagram is the “chart” in the quote, “from the center of the gola chart drawn at the time of equal day and night.”Within that circle, east, south, west, and north are each divided into two parts. Together with the four intermediate directions, this makes twelve parts in all. In the northern part of the east is Aries, in the northeast is Taurus, in the eastern part of the north is Gemini, in the western part of the north is Cancer, in the northwest is Leo, and in the northern part of the west is Virgo. This illustrates the path of the six northern houses. In the southern part of the west is Libra, in the southwest is Scorpio, in the west­ern part of the south is Sagittarius, in the eastern part of the south is Capri­corn, in the southeast is Aquarius, and in the southern part of the east is Pisces. This illustrates the path of the six southern houses. This is the think­ing behind the passage in the Great Commentary beginning “in one half of the east is Aries” up to “in one half of the east is Pisces is an explanation of the houses in the gola.”In this way, as soon as the mean sun arrives in any of the twelve houses, the path of the sun of that solar day at the central meridian of the central southern sector is also the path of the first stars of that particular house. For example, on the day on which the mean sun enters Aries, the sun together with Aries travels the path of the equinox over the central meridian of the central southern sector. Therefore the text from the tantra and commen­tary from “In the center, from asvini up to half of citra to “Aries in the east and Libra” [86] is explaining particularly the gola of Lesser Jambudvipa at the center of the southern sector.But what is the meaning of “bow-shaped” and “like fine lotus petals”? It is this. In the depiction of the path of the houses directly over the central"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"ii6 Part i: The External Worldsouthern sector, the six houses of the south and the six of the north are bisected by a line representing the equinox path. The six houses of the south are then in the shape of a bamboo bow and are depicted in the regions of the Mountains of Fire in the south. The six houses of the north are in the shape of the petals of half a lotus and are depicted in the regions of the Sita Mountains in the north. If it were otherwise, as those men­tioned above have maintained, then the bow formation in the regions of the Mountains of Fire and the lotus formation in the regions of the Sita Moun­tains could not be explained. Also, the shapes of both sets of six houses may be similar in that they are both semicircular, but in order to put these shapes into sragdhara meter,106 the words “fine lotus petals” were used.By understanding the above, how it is possible to understand the orbiting of the gola over each of the twelve sectorsThe Great Commentary says:Now the gola of the world is spoken of in detail. “From the fire to the borders of the Sita Mountains is a distance of space, space, space, arrows, and mountains, as thousands of yojana.” This means that from the southern fire mandala to the borders of the great snows of the north is a distance of 75,000 yojana.107This and subsequent passages clearly reveal that when charts are drawn depicting meridians running from above the Sita Mountains directly in line with each of the twelve sectors stretching to a similar point above the Mountains of Fire, and when these meridians are bisected midway by lines illustrating the path of the equinox sun over each of the sectors, then the northern parts of these intersections would stretch for a distance of half of75,000 yojana, or 37,500 yojana, to the edge of the Sita Mountains. Simi­larly, south of the intersection, the distance to the edge of the Mountains of Fire would also be 37,500 yojana. From this the pathway of the twelve houses over the other eleven sectors can be known and is illustrated by the chart of the central southern sector. [87]What is the pathway of the twelve houses over the other eleven sectors? A circle is drawn from the Sita Mountains directly facing each of the sec­tors to a similar point directly above the Mountains of Fire, and its east- west diameter is bisected. This illustrates the path of the houses and lunar"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 117mansions in which the sun has arrived at the time of the equinox for each of the sectors. Therefore, from the central meridian at the east-west center of the eastern sector of the south, the sun is in Pisces at the spring equinox. In the western sector of the east, it is in Aquarius, and in the central east­ern sector it is in Capricorn. Moving to the left, this continues from Sagit­tarius in the eastern sector of the east up to Taurus in the western sector of the south.To illustrate the pathway of all twelve houses above each of the eleven sectors, the four directions of east, south, west, and north within the charts are divided into two parts each. Together with the four intermediate direc­tions, this makes twelve sectors. Applying this to the eastern southern sec­tor, in the northern section of the east lies Pisces, in the northeast is Aries, in the eastern section of the north is Taurus, in the western part is Gem­ini, in the northwest is Cancer, and in the northern section of the west is Leo.

This is an illustration of the profound point “If one corner is held, the whole can be moved” and is the definitive position of the commentary. You who assert the above should look on this as new advice. [90]The explanation that the path of the houses runs above a region stretch­ing from the Sita Mountains to the Mountains of Fire is based upon the path of the lunar mansions and houses together with the other stars. How­ever, the actual path of the houses with the lunar mansions, sun, moon, and other planets is within an area that covers 12,500 yojana of the earth man­dala and reaches outward up to three quarters of the water mandala to make an area of 50,000 yojana. This has been correctly taught by scholars (such as those of the Elim ination o f Error Oral Tradition). The reason for their assertion is as follows. If a gnomon is planted in the ground at mid­day here in our land of Tibet on the day the sun has traveled its farthest north, its shadow will still face slightly to the north. Therefore, this estab­lishes that the sun, as well as the house and lunar mansion that the sun occupies, dwells to the south of our land of Tibet. Tibet is the fifth land of the six lands, which in order from the north are Himalaya, Kailash, China, Khotan, Tibet, and India. Therefore, in the sixth land, at the southern limit of India, one’s shadow would simply surround oneself.While it can be accepted that even at the time of the northernmost point of its travels the sun does not come up beyond the southern limit of India,108 how is it established that the path109 of the sun along with the houses and lunar mansions stretches for 50,000 yojana up to three quar­ters of the water mandala, 12,500 yojana inward from its edge? The Great Commentary says:Here the measurement of the gola is 75,000 yojana from the fire mandala of the south to the snows of the north. “Similarly orbit­ing east and west,” this is taught clearly in the fifth chapter.110Therefore a circular chart is drawn from the center of an equinox path and stretches to depictions of the Sita Mountains and the Mountains of Fire in order to illustrate the path of the twelve houses above each of the twelve sec­tors. [91] However this illustration of the pathway of the houses, lunar mansions, and sun is a generalized and rough depiction. The specific path should be known from explanations found in the Gnosis chapter. The text of these explanations is missing from some translations, including the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 121Shong and new Jonang translations. However, after verse 190 from the Gyijo and Ma translations, there is this verse:The limits of the sun’s travels north and south stretch three quarters of the Salt Ocean and up to Kailash for a distance of 50,000 yojana.In a halved chart, day and night are of space fire111 hours.50,000 is completed in eyes, naga, and moon,112 traveling from day to day.113This verse is the reference for the previous commentary quote, and so those previously mentioned scholars who have taught this are correct.An explanation of how the length of day and night are formed by the sun's occupation of the housesThe houses and the lunar mansions orbit Meru in a clockwise direction to the right, and by the force of the wind carrying the houses, the sun and the planets that occupy the houses also orbit Meru to the right. However, in terms of their individual movements, the sun and the other planets, with the exception of Rahu, enter and occupy the lunar mansions by orbiting Meru in a counterclockwise direction to the left.The planets make both southward and northward journeys, while the houses and the lunar mansions have no southward or northward path and no individual movements. They move over the same path they have always followed, regardless of the sector they are traversing. The Great Commen­tary says:Therefore this orbiting force is that of the houses but not that of the sun that dwells in the houses. The circle of the houses orbits to the right, the planets move into the houses to the left.Just as the circle of houses orbit, likewise Rahu, facing west, travels to the right. The east-facing planets travel around Meru to the left and move through the circle of houses.114[92] It is in this way that the sun is the main indicator of the differences in time and so forth. Therefore it is necessary to know, among other things, which house the sun is occupying in the regions of the twelve sectors at the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"122 Part i: The External Worldtimes of the limits of sun’s northward and southward passages and of the equinoxes. This will be explained.First let us explain the spring equinox. The lunar mansion position of the mean sun is set at zero in all places.115 As soon as the mean sun arrives at Aries, it marks the beginning of the seasons and of the spring equinox at the central meridian of the central sector of the south. Likewise the spring equi­nox occurring at the direct center of the other eleven sectors clockwise from the south, such as the western sector of the south, can be matched to the immediate arrival of the mean sun in the other houses, such as Taurus. Therefore, by the arrival of the mean sun in Taurus, a spring equinox occurs at the direct center of the western sector of the south. Similarly, moving clockwise, when the spring equinox occurs at the third sector, the mean sun will appear in the charts in Gemini, at the fourth in Cancer, at the fifth in Leo, at the sixth in Virgo, at the seventh in Libra, at the eighth in Scor­pio, at the ninth in Sagittarius, at the tenth in Capricorn, at the eleventh in Aquarius, and when spring equinox occurs at the direct center of the twelfth, or the eastern, sector of the south, the mean sun arrives in Pisces.The above are the equinoxes over the direct center of the sectors, but to be more precise, within each sector more than thirty equinoxes can occur. From the moment the mean sun enters Aries until it enters Taurus, the area of land from the center of the central southern sector to the center of the western sector of the south can be divided into thirty parts that constitute thirty solar days, and on each day a spring equinox will occur. Similarly, from the arrival of the mean sun in Taurus until the moment of its arrival in Gemini, the area from the center of the western sector of the south to the center of the eastern sector of the west is divided into thirty parts, each covering a solar day, and on each day a spring equinox will occur.The same applies to the other areas. The exceptions are the area from the center of the eastern sector of the west to the center of the central sector of the west, the area from the center of the eastern sector of the north to the center of the central sector of the north, and the area from the center of the eastern sector of the east to the center of the central sector of the east: all these are divided into thirty-one. [93] The area from the center of the east­ern sector of the south to the center of the central sector of the south is divided into thirty-two. The spring equinox occurs on each of these solar days. These are exceptions to the above.The months, named according to their full-moon lunar mansions116 and designated as early, middle, and later,117 are linked to particular houses in"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 123which the sun dwells. The half-month in which the mean sun enters Aries will be one of the two halves of a waxing-led Caitra. If the mean sun enter­ing Aries appears in the chart on any date from the first to the fifteenth of the waxing, Aries is assigned to Caitra. When the mean sun entering Aries appears in the chart on any date from the first to the fifteenth of the wan­ing, Aries is assigned to a waning-led Vais'akha, which is then designated as the beginning of the year. The Great Commentary says:In this Lesser Jambudvipa, south of Meru, the houses of Aries and so forth, the times of spring and so forth, the months of Caitra and so forth, and the halves are all well known.118This shows Aries assigned to a waxing-led Caitra. Again the Great Com­mentary states:In this continent south of Meru, the sun dwells in Aries, and Vaisakha is the spring.119This illustrates the house of Aries assigned to a waning-led Vais'akha. In this way, the month assigned to Aries when that month is waxing-led will be Caitra in all of the twelve sectors, and when waning-led, the month assigned to Aries will be Vaisakha in all twelve sectors. When the month of the sun entering Aries is designated a waxing-led month, here in our central sector of the south, middle spring is the month of Caitra. Proceed­ing counterclockwise, in the second sector, or the eastern sector of the south, later spring is Caitra. In the third sector counterclockwise, early summer is Caitra. In the fourth, middle summer is Caitra. In the fifth, later summer is Caitra. In the sixth, Caitra is in early autumn; in the sev­enth, Caitra is middle autumn; and in the eighth, it is later autumn. [94] In the ninth sector Caitra occurs in early winter, in the tenth in middle win­ter, and in the eleventh in later winter. In the twelfth sector, the western sector of the south, Caitra is in early spring.When the month of the sun’s residence in Aries is designated a waning- led month, in this central sector of the south, later spring is the month of Vais'akha. Similarly, moving counterclockwise, in the second sector, early summer is Vaisakha. In the third, middle summer is Vais'akha, and so on, until the twelfth sector, the western sector of the south, where middle spring would be Vaisakha."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"124 Fart i: The External WorldWhen the sun, on its journey from Aries, arrives in Cancer, it has reached the limit of its northward journey from the standpoint of the cen­ter of this central sector of the south. Similarly, proceeding clockwise, the northern limit of the sun’s journey from the standpoint of the direct cen­ter of each of the remaining eleven sectors can be applied to the moment the mean sun arrives in Leo and the other eleven houses. For example, at the direct center of the western sector of the south, it is the moment of the sun’s arrival in Leo that marks the limit of the sun’s northward journey. Similarly, moving clockwise, the moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Virgo marks the limit of the sun’s northward journey at the direct center of the third sector, or the eastern sector of the west. Similarly it is Libra at the fourth clockwise, Scorpio at the fifth, Sagittarius at the sixth, Capricorn at the seventh, Aquarius at the eighth, Pisces at the ninth, Aries at the tenth, Taurus at the eleventh. And the moment of the mean sun’s arrival at Gem­ini marks the limit of the sun’s northward journey at the direct center of the eastern sector of the south.This can be looked at in more detail. Between the sun’s journey from Cancer and the moment of its arrival in Leo, the area from the direct cen­ter of the central sector of the south to the center of the western sector of the south can be divided into thirty parts. In each part the sun will travel to its northern limit, which means a summer solstice,120 occurring each time. A summer solstice, therefore, occurs thirty times. Likewise, between the sun’s journey from Leo and the moment of its arrival in Virgo, the area from the direct center of the western sector of the south to the center of the eastern sector of the west can be divided into thirty parts. In each part the sun will travel to its northern limit, bringing about a summer solstice each time. Here, too, a summer solstice occurs thirty times. This process can be applied to the other sectors. [95] The exceptions can be known from the section above on the equinoxes.The moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Libra is the autumn equinox at the direct center of our central sector of the south. Similarly, the moments of the mean sun’s arrivals at Scorpio and the other eleven houses, and, clockwise, the corresponding autumn equinoxes at the direct center of the western sector of the south and the other eleven sectors, can be known in the same way that the spring equinoxes were known.The moment of the sun’s arrival in Capricorn marks the limit of the sun’s southward passage at the direct center of the central sector of the south, and is the winter solstice. Similarly the moment of arrival of the"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 125mean sun in Aquarius and the other eleven houses marks the limits of the sun’s southward passages and winter solstices at, clockwise, the western sector of the south and the other eleven sectors respectively. For example, the moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Aquarius marks the limit of the sun’s southward passage as well as the winter solstice at the direct center of the western sector of the south. Similarly, as soon as the mean sun arrives in Pisces, the sun’s southward journey is at its limit for the direct center of the eastern sector of the west, and that moment marks its winter solstice. This continues until the moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Sagittarius, which marks the winter solstice and limit of the sun’s southward journey at the direct center of the eastern sector of the south.If this is looked at in more detail, between the moment of the sun’s arrival in Capricorn and the moment of its arrival in Aquarius, the area from the center of the central sector of the south to the center of the west­ern sector of the south is divided into thirty parts. At each part the sun reaches the limit of its southward passage, and therefore the winter solstice also occurs. Correspondence between the remaining eleven houses and eleven sectors can be understood in the same way.In this way, during the course of a year illustrated by the mean sun cir­cling from Aries to Aries, the sun makes a little over 365 clockwise orbits of Meru. Therefore the area of the twelve sectors can be divided into three 365 parts, and at each part the sun will reach the limit of its southward passage, and at each limit a winter solstice will occur. In the same way the limits of the northward summer journeys as well as the spring and autumn equinoxes can also be known. [96]Now I will discuss the scriptural references and reasonings that sub­stantiate the above. The Great Commentary says:How are the additions and omissions to be known? Before the first month of the northward passage, ten days are to be studied by the shadow of the gnomon. As soon as the shadow of the sun stick turns from north, that day, that date, that yoga, that karana is the solar day on which the sun changes its movement. On that solar day the sun is at twenty in the lunar mansion place121 and at fifteen in the hours place.

The sun on that day is twenty lunar mansions and fifteen hours. This is explained as being the moment the sun leaves Sagittarius and enters Capricorn. The region where this occurs is the direct center of this central sector of the south. The country or region where the karana astronomy taught in the tantra was mainly practiced is the noble country of India at the center of this central sector of the south. It is with this region in mind that it was taught that the sun’s position of twenty lunar mansions and fifteen hours corresponds to the winter solstice at the moment the sun enters Capricorn. In the section from the Great Commentary explaining increment and decrement in the sun’s stages according to karana it says:“Because of its travels there is increment and decrement con­cerning the sun. Others have no accurate positions.” These words are definitive.122Explaining this line, the commentary continues:The result obtained by that fraction is a number of hours, and in the place of hours it is an increment. Because of its travels there is decrement. Because of its travels, there is also an incre­ment in Capricorn and so forth and a decrement in Cancer and so forth.123According to karana methodology, the moment of the sun’s arrival in Capricorn is the start of the northward journey, and the moment of the sun’s arrival in Cancer is the start of the southward passage. [97] Therefore those scholars (such as Chogyal Jangpa)124 are not correct when they main­tain that the statement asserting twenty in the position of the lunar man­sions and fifteen in the position of hours to be the winter solstice refers to the western edge of the central sector of the south. Here’s why. It would fol­low that the statement positing the moment of the sun’s arrival in Aries as being the spring equinox on the central sector of the south also refers to the western edge of the central sector of the south. This cannot be, because if that were the case, the statement that the sun in Aries at the direct center of the central sector of the east corresponds to the beginning of the day at the central sector of the south would also have to refer to the western edge of the central sector of the south. It cannot mean that, because it would contradict the quote beginning “For half the path of 300,000.”125"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 127Therefore, as explained above, the moment of the sun’s arrival in Sagit­tarius marks the limit of the sun’s southward passage for the eastern sector of the south at its the direct center. Then, for each of a little over thirty days, the area from the center of the eastern sector of the south to the cen­ter of the central sector of the south is divided into thirty parts, and it is established that the limit of the sun’s southward passage occurs at each part, with a winter solstice occurring each time. This can be established. The master Abhaya126 says in his Kdlacakrdvatara:Therefore I will speak on the path of siddhanta. These are the stages. On level ground in the middle of a circle of one cubit diameter, plant a stick in the ground that measures the length from the tip of your thumb to the tip of your middle finger.The line of the stick’s morning shadow gradually shortens from outside the mandala. When it reaches the edge of the mandala, at that time and in that place, make the mark of the crowfoot.127 That is the west. In the afternoon the shadow gradually length­ens from the center of the mandala. Repeat the process as before, and the mark will indicate the east. Anchoring thread at one of the marks, and beginning directly in front of the other mark, draw a circle with chalk. Anchor thread at the other mark and do the same, thereby creating the shape of a fish. In the middle of the two circles, the center of the mouth of the fish is the south, and the center of the tail is the north.128 Having ascer­tained the directions rub out the circles. [98] Starting from the tenth day before the sun makes its northward journey, make observations at midday. When the shadow begins to move inside from the northern edge of the original circle, that is the day the sun changes to its northward journey.129In an experiment similar to this, seven sixty-year cycles after Fire Rabbit year, the first of the past years, plus twenty single years, in the unfinished year of the male Fire Dog130 (in the company of bright and intelligent schol­ars and in accordance with the words of the omniscient Paldrak131), I carried out observations using the gnomon at the time of the winter solstice. On the fifth day of the twelfth month of the Hor calendar,132 the shadow was seen to turn from heading northward. Therefore on the fourth, the previous day, the winter solstice was established for the place where we had been standing."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"128 Part i: The External WorldIt was also at the point where 4/13 of the fourth calendar day had passed. Using siddhanta astronomy, the mean sun of 3/13 of the fourth day was cal­culated to be at the position of eighteen lunar mansions and thirty-one hours, thirty minutes exacdy.133 A position of twenty lunar mansions and fif­teen hours134 is reached by adding twenty-three days plus 3/13 of one day of the sun’s fixed motion.135 Therefore the winter solstice is established for the direct center of the central sector of the south at the point of the comple­tion of 3/13 of the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth Hor month. This estab­lished that the region we were occupying was the twenty-third region east of the center of the central sector of the south from among the division of thirty separate regions ranging from the center of the central sector of the south to the center of the eastern sector of the south, and in that region the winter solstice occurred on the fourth day of the twelfth Hor month of that year. Using the same reasoning, it is possible to know the winter solstice for each of the 365 regions divided among the twelve sectors.The omniscient Buton calculated the sun’s southern limit and winter solstice in our particular region as being the sun’s occupation of nineteen lunar mansions and fifteen hours.136 [99] However, the Great Commentary says:In the Icing of tantras, definitions137 are not fixed. At the end ofsixty years, the definitions are to be done again.138Therefore, from the prabhava Fire Rabbit first year of the past years until this present Water Rabbit year,139 457 years have passed. Over that time in karana astronomy, the middle place multiplied by Siva140 has accumulated an excess of about twenty-three hours for the sun. If those twenty-three hours are subtracted from nineteen lunar mansions and fifteen hours, which is asserted these days as being the position of the winter sun’s solstice, the result is eighteen lunar mansions and fifty-two hours. Therefore this establishes that even according to those who use karana astronomy these days, and who maintain the same mansion position as the omniscient Buton, at the time of the winter solstice in this land of ours, about nine­teen days of the sun’s coursing still has to be added before it arrives at the position of twenty lunar mansions and fifteen hours. Therefore, by this reasoning, even according those who assert the above would have to agree that our land was the nineteenth land eastward from the center of the cen­tral sector of the south among the thirty separate lands apportioned from"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 129the eastern sector of the south to the central sector of the south, and that there would be a winter solstice on that nineteenth land counted eastward from the central sector of the south.Contrary to the above, the presentations of those (such as Kumara) who adhere to general karana astronomy (which maintains that at the time of the winter solstice the sun is at a position of twenty lunar mansions and fif­teen hours, and that that position is the winter solstice each year at each of the twelve sectors) can be known from their extensive refutation else­where.141Furthermore, the Great Commentary says:“Orbiting the circle of houses in all regions of Meru, when the sun reaches the Fire in the region of the seventh, it touches the peak142 of Meru and journeys above the mountains of snow.”By this reasoning, the lengths of time and so forth of the sun dwelling in each house can be known in all.143This passage indicates that the time of the winter solstice is ascertained generally at each of the sectors each year, and from that it can be under­stood that thirty winter solstices occur on each of these sectors. [100] How is this understood? Using the central sector of the south as an illustration, the passage explains that the moment the sun arrives in Cancer, the peak or horns of Meru direcdy facing the direct center of the central sector of the south are touched by the rays of the sun. On the same solar day the rays of the sun will also reach the regions above the inner limit of the Mountains of Fire that directly face the central sector of the north, which is the sev­enth sector counting from the central southern sector.144 When the mean sun is at nineteen lunar mansions and seven hours and thirty minutes, which is the sun’s arrival at the halfway point of Sagittarius, the rays of the sun touch the peak or horns of Meru facing the land of the eastern edge of the central sector of the south divided into thirty separate parts. O n that day also on the seventh sector from the central sector of the south, the cen­tral sector of the north, on the land at the eastern edge, the rays of the sun will reach the regions above the inner limit of the Mountains of Fire. This can be inferred by the phrase “Orbiting the circle of houses in all regions of Meru.”Assertions contrary to the above say that there is only one limit to the sun’s northward and southward passages on each sector each year. Other"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"130 Part i: The External Worldscholars (such as Kumara) maintain that there is only one winter and sum­mer solstice each year in each sector. If these were correct, consider the fol­lowing. When the sun arrives in Capricorn, the length of the day of the direct center of the east-west meridian of Kailash is twenty-five hours. According to the above, it would follow that the day must be twenty-five hours long also at the eastern edge of Kailash, because these two regions share the same time of winter solstice. If that is asserted, then consider this. As soon as the sun enters Capricorn, one zodiacal m onth145 has passed since the winter solstice in the eastern sector of the south in the center of a region corresponding to Kailash, and the length of the day in that region is twenty- six hours and forty minutes. Similarly, in the eastern sector of the south, at the western edge of a region corresponding to Kailash, it would follow that a day would also have to be twenty-six hours and forty minutes, [101] because the winter solstice at the center of the eastern sector of the south and at the western edge of that sector occurs at the same time. If that is so, then it would be incorrect to hold that the length of a day at the eastern edge of Kailash of the central sector of the south was twenty-five hours, and on that very day the length of a day on the western edge of a region corre­sponding to Kailash on the eastern sector of the south was twenty-six hours and forty minutes, because the eastern edge of Kailash of the central sector of the south and the western edge of a corresponding region on the east­ern sector of the south border each other. This matter can also be discussed by looking at the extent of the sun’s rays, but that is enough for now.Some say that the Great Commentary passage “Orbiting the circle of houses in all regions of Meru \" and so on may indeed teach that at the time of the limits of the two passages of the sun, the rays of the sun reach the peak or horns of Meru and the regions above the inner limit of the Mountains of Fire. However, if this means that the disk of the sun itself does not travel to these two places, then consider this quote from the Great Commentary:“Having covered the Salt Ocean, the sun travels as far as the fire in the south.” This means that the sun, having covered the Salt Ocean by way of the houses over each of the sectors divided by the twelve spokes, it travels to dwell in the south as far as the beginning of the fire mandala at the end of the oceans. From that point of the fire mandala, it travels to the north of Kailash, to Himalaya, moving north on its northward journey.146"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 131Doesn’t this quote preclude such an assertion? It does not, because these words from the Great Commentary teach that it is the rays147 of the sun that travel to the regions above the inner rim of the Mountains of Fire and as far as the peak or horns of Meru. The Condensed Tantra says:Above at six and naga, the rays of the sun at the northward limit.Then, in clockwise direction, lord of men, ceasing at 11,000.From the center at 81,000, less arrows hundred, the gola chart, increasing and decreasing space, space, arrows, and arrows, to the north and south.Having covered the Salt Ocean, the sun travels as far as the fire in the south.148This quote shows that the phrase “rays of the sun” is to be applied as clar­ification to the subsequent lines beginning, “Having covered the Salt Ocean.” Similarly:“Together with a half, eyes, naga, moon, day after day is spent.”[102] This means a total of i82Vi.149 These are the individual solar days of one direction of the 75,000 yojana traveled by the sun.150“Spent”151 in this passage means spent by the rays of the sun. This is not a presentation that excludes the area covered by the “spender” but one that includes it, and so the line ending “the 75,000 yojana spent by the sun” is also talking of the area spent by the rays of the sun. If the “spender’s” reach were not included in the portion spent, then the following consequence would occur. The circumference of the sun’s disk is not clearly taught in this tantra and its commentaries, but in the Abhidharmakos'a it says, “of fifty-one yojana,”152 thereby explaining the measurement of the disk of the sun to be fifty-one yojana. Therefore you would have to accept that the sun travels for “Together with a half, eyes, naga, moon-’ or 182V2 days over75,000 minus a third of fifty-one, or seventeen, yojana.153 In that case, ask yourself how, even for you, that does not contradict the quote ending, “75,000 yojana traveled by the sun.”The Abhidharma assertion is a rough estimate made on the basis of com­monly accepted views. This can be examined in more detail. A chain of sun discs arranged in a lunar mansion would not exceed sixty in number, and"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"132 Part i: The External Worldin each lunar mansion there are sixty hours of distance. Therefore it must be that the distance between the northern and southern edge of the sun’s disk is at least one hour of distance, and one hour of distance is a little over 231 yojana. To believe that at the time of the sun’s northern limit, the sun’s disk actually reaches the peak or horns of Meru would contradict our actual experience that here in this land of Tibet, the shadow of the gnomon still shows north on the day of the sun’s northern limit, as previously described.How far does the sun travel on each day of its northward journey? 182 Vi days are divided among 50,000 yojana. That results in a little over 273 yojana, three krosa, and 1,780 armspans. [103] (To be precise, it is over by three cubits, six fingerwidths, seven barley grains, and 85/365 of a barley grain.)The height above the earth mandala that the sun travels is explained as follows. Whichever region the sun may be over at the time of its northern limit of that sector, its rays are at a height of 86,000 yojana. Above the area of the seventh sector from that particular region, which would be a region of the sun’s southern limit, the rays are at a height of 86,000 yojana less 11,000, or 75,000 yojana. The sun therefore travels clockwise around Meru in an undulating154 fashion. Therefore it is taught that in any region the dis­tance between the ground and the rays of the sun is explained as being86.000 yojana at the sun’s northern limit and 75,000 yojana at its south­ern limit. It can be understood, therefore, that from the area of its north­ern limit until its southward journey is completed, the sun and its rays drop each day by sixty yojana, one krosa, 191 armspans, three cubits, two fingerwidths, and 350/365 of a fingerwidth. Similarly it can be understood that from the time of the sun’s southern limit until its northward journey is completed, each day it gains in height by the same distance.What is the reach of the sun’s rays? Some say that it is 14,000 yojana, and others say 12,500 yojana. If the previous quote is to be translated, “touches the peak of Meru,” then the rays of the lower regions of sun extend for14.000 yojana, because at the time of its northern limit the disk of the sun is level with the peak of Meru.155 The length of the directional rays, such as those from its southern side, for example, must be 12,500 yojana, because at the time of its northern limit the tip of the sun’s rays must be posited as reaching the peak of Meru, and at such a time the distance between the disk of the sun and Meru is not more than 12,500 yojana. If we read the quote according to the Shong translation as “touches the horns of Meru,”156 [104] the rays from the lower regions of the sun disk also travel for 12,500 yojana."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 133The circumference of the sun’s undulating daily motion, the sun’s eclip­tic, and the distance from the lunar mansion of asvini to the lunar man­sion of re v a tP1 is 375,000 yojana. In hours that is equal to 1,620 hours of distance.During the sun’s undulating revolution around Meru, there are six places in each sector where night and day are of different lengths. These six places are explained as follows. O f the 25,000 yojana of the earth mandala that stretches from the outer edge of the Slta Mountains to the inner rim of the water mandala, the northern half is divided into six separate parts. O f these the northernmost part of Himalaya borders the Slta Mountains. The southern edge of the noble land of India directly faces the disk of the sun on the day of the sun’s northern limit.158 This is established by the shadow of a gnomon on that day. In this way, from the southern edge of the Slta Mountains on the earth mandala of the central sector of the south to the inner rim of the water mandala, the northern half of the 25,000 yojana is divided into six regions comprising, from the north, Himalaya, Kailash, China, Khotan, Tibet, and India. Likewise the remaining eleven sectors can be presented as having six regions of similar proportions. At the direct center of the six regions of this central sector of the south, night and day can be of different lengths due to the sun’s passages. Similarly, on the six regions of the other sectors, it should be understood that differences in the lengths of day and night will also occur.The way night and day differ in length in the central sector of the south is as follows. At the time of equal day and night on the central meridian of the central sector of the south, daytime is thirty hours and nighttime is thirty hours in each of the six regions. Each day on from this time of a common equinox, the time of day increases and the length of night decreases by the following times on the six regions as the sun moves north. [105] At Himalaya it increases by three minutes,159 five breaths, 3/5 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. At Kailash it is three minutes, one breath, 2/3 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. In China it is two minutes, four breaths, 6/7 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. In Khotan it is two min­utes, two breaths, 3/4 of a breath, and one 130/365 of that again. In Tibet it is two minutes, one breath, 1/9 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. In India it is one minute, five breaths, 4/5 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again.When the sun reaches the limit of its northward journey at the central meridian of the central sector of the south, the length of the daytime is thirty-six hours; thirty-five hours; thirty-four hours, seventeen minutes,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134 P&rt i: The External Worldand 6/7 of a breath; thirty-three hours and forty-five minutes; thirty-three hours and twenty minutes; and thirty-three hours, respectively, in the six regions from Himalaya to India. The nighttime also decreases to twenty- four hours; twenty-five hours; twenty-five hours, forty-two minutes, five breaths, and 1/7 of a breath; twenty-six hours and fifteen minutes; twenty- six hours, forty minutes; and finally twenty-seven hours from Himalaya to India, respectively. Similarly, when the sun moves south from the equi­nox, the length of night increases and daytime decreases each day at each of the six regions by the same amounts as above. At the southern limit of the sun’s travels, the lengths of day and night are the reverse of the above and can be known accordingly.To match all this with supporting references from the tantra and com­mentaries, and to look at points of doubt, the Great Commentary says, on the thirty-eighth verse of the Realms chapter:Concerning this measurement, on the day of moving south, thirty-six hours are of daytime and twenty-four are of night. Similarly, when traveling north, the length of day and night can be known by reversing this.160This explains that in Himalaya, daytime increases by twelve hours and nighttime decreases by twelve hours between the time of the sun’s south­ern limit and the time of the sun’s northern limit. In Kailash, from the southern limit to the northern limit, a fifth of a sixty-hour day and night is established as being the increase and decrease. The Great Commentary says on the fifty-fourth verse of the Realms chapter: [106]Here increase and decrease is by one sixth. By a sixth part of sixty, or ten hours, nighttime decreases and daytime increases from Capricorn to the end of Gemini. From Cancer to the end of Sagi ttarius, daytime decreases and nighttime increases. “Def­initely sun and moon decrease and increase” means by one sixth.On the continent of Kailash, the ascertainment of the shadow is not that of India. In India, on the sun’s journey from the north to its southern limit and from the south to the northern limit, the increase and decrease, as ascertained by the shadow, is by a tenth. Likewise, in the lands of Tibet, Khotan, China, and"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 135so forth, it is by a ninth, an eighth, a seventh, and so on. In this way, as far as the land of Shambhala, increase and decrease can be known by the reading of the shadow.161Thus, in Kailash, from the limit of the southward passage to the limit of the northward passage, daytime increases and nighttime decreases by a sixth of sixty hours, or ten hours. In the lands of India, Tibet, Khotan, and China, daytime increases and nighttime decreases respectively by a tenth of sixty hours, or six hours; by a ninth, or six hours and forty minutes; by an eighth, or seven hours and thirty minutes; and by a seventh, or eight hours, thirty-four minutes, one breath, and 5/7 of a breath.Therefore the increase and decrease of day and night found from one limit to the other in the six lands is twelve hours in Himalaya; ten hours in Kailash; eight hours, thirty-four minutes, one breath, and 5/7 of a breath in China; seven hours and thirty minutes in Khotan; six hours and forty minutes in Tibet; and six hours in India. These figures are halved, and one half is added to the thirty hours of equinox daytime, and one half is sub­tracted from the thirty hours of equinox nighttime, to arrive at the above figures for the length of daytime and nighttime on the day of the limit of the sun’s northward journey at each of the six lands.It is the thinking of the commentary that these increases and decreases in the length of a day as explained here refer to solar days. [107] The Great Commentary says on the thirty-eighth verse of the Realms chapter:The stages of the journey are 82 Vi solar days more than a hun­dred. In the south on these solar days, on the stages of the jour­ney, nighttime increases, while in its north it is the daytime.162Therefore the final increase and decrease at the limits of the travels is counted in solar days. Moreover any decrease and increase has to be noted from day to day.Some might say, “According to you, the change each day in Himalaya is three minutes, five breaths, 3/5 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. This contradicts the Great Commentary where it says:North of Kailash as far as Himalaya, each day the stages of the travel increase and decrease by four breaths and three minutes.163"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"136 Part 1: The External World“Also for you, in Kailash the increase and decrease for each day is three minutes, one breath, 2/3 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. In India, according to you, the increase and decrease for each day is one minute, five breaths, 4/5 of a breath, and 130/365 of that again. In the Great Com- mentary it says:Each day, daytime and nighttime increases or decreases by two breaths and three minutes. This is the measurement for Kailash.164“Also:In India, it should be known that on each day and night there is an increase or decrease of two minutes.“Your assertions, therefore, contradict these quotes.”There is no contradiction. The increases and decreases of the solar days in the six lands that we have stated above are divisions of increase and decrease in daytime and nighttime between the limit of one passage and the limit of the other, whose times in hours and so forth are correct figures obtained by dividing by the 1821/2 solar days that exist between one limit and the other. Therefore they are correct as measurements of daily increase and decrease. The increase and decrease of three minutes and four breaths for each day in Himalaya as mentioned in the Great Commentary is an approximation. Concerning the three minutes and two breaths in Kailash and the two minutes in India, [108] these increases have been calculated by dividing by the 180 zodiacal days165 that exist between one limit and the other. This results in three minutes and two breaths in Kailash and two minutes in India. These were taught, therefore, with convenience in mind. Therefore the calculations of those that have led to a chart difference of two breaths each day from India to Himalaya cannot possibly be correct.That has been a general explanation. If it is explained astronomically, then at the moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Aries, the days of the six lands at their direct centers are thirty hours long, and the nights are thirty hours long. All six lands thereby share the equinox. From then on indi­vidual daytimes in each of the six lands increase in length daily until the mean sun arrives in Taurus, when in India the length of daytime is thirty- one hours. In Tibet it is thirty-one hours, six minutes, and four breaths. In"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets \\y jKhotan it is thirty-one hours and fifteen minutes. In China it is thirty-one hours, twenty-five minutes, four breaths, and 2/7 of a breath. In Kailash daytime is thirty-one hours and forty minutes, and in Himalaya it is thirty- two hours.Likewise, at the moment of the mean sun’s arrival in Gemini, daytime in India is thirty-two hours. In Tibet it is thirty-two hours, thirteen min­utes, and two breaths; in Khotan it is thirty-two hours and thirty minutes; in China it is thirty-two hours, fifty-one minutes, two breaths, and 4/7 of a breath. In Kailash it is thirty-three hours and twenty minutes, and in Himalaya it is thirty-four hours. The arrival of the sun in Cancer is the day of its northern limit at the direct center of the six lands, and the length of daytime has been explained previously.The reasons why, on the same day in each of the six lands, the duration of the sun varies can be explained using the day on which the sun has reached its northern limit as an example. When the sun arrives above the meridian of the central sector of the east at the time of the mean sun arriv­ing in Aries, it is the beginning of morning at the center of the six lands in the central southern sector, and when it arrives above the meridian of the central sector of the west, it is the end of the afternoon. This is true for all six lands. Then the sun moves steadily north until it reaches its northern limit. When the sun on that day arrives at a point one hour and thirty minutes east of the meridian of the central sector of the east, it is the begin­ning of morning in the center of India. [109] When the sun arrives at a point one hour thirty minutes west of the meridian of the central sector of the west, it is the end of the afternoon in India. Therefore the time from its rising in the east until it arrives at the direct center of India is sixteen hours and thirty minutes of morning. From then until the sun sets is six­teen hours and thirty minutes of afternoon. This makes thirty-three hours total.At the center of Tibet, when the sun arrives at a point one hour and forty minutes east of the meridian of the central sector of the east, morn­ing begins. When it arrives at a similar point west of the central sector of the west, afternoon ends. Therefore, from the moment of its appearance until the sun reaches the direct center of Tibet, it is morning, and a total of sixteen hours and forty minutes passes. From then until sunset is after­noon, and a total of sixteen hours and forty minutes also passes. Putting these two sums together, daytime in Tibet becomes thirty-three hours and twenty minutes."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"138 Part 1: The External WorldIn the center of Khotan, when the sun arrives at a point one hour, fifty- two minutes, and three breaths east of the meridian of the central sector of the east, morning begins, and when the sun arrives at a similar point west of the meridian of central sector of the west, afternoon ends. Therefore, from the point of its rising until the sun reaches the direct center of Khotan, it is morning, and sixteen hours, fifty-two minutes, and three breaths will have passed. From then until sunset is afternoon, and the same number of hours will pass. Morning and afternoon added together make daytime in Khotan, at that particular time, thirty-two hours and forty-five minutes long.In the center of China, when the sun arrives at a point two hours, eight minutes, three breaths, and 3/7 of a breath east of the meridian of the cen­tral sector of the east, morning begins, and when it arrives at a similar point west of the central sector of the west, afternoon ends. Therefore, from the moment of the sun’s rising until it reaches the direct center of China, it is morning, and seventeen hours, eight minutes, three breaths, and 3/7 of a breath will pass. From then until sunset is afternoon, and that same num­ber of hours will pass. Adding together the times of morning and after­noon produces a total of thirty-four hours, seventeen minutes, and 6/7 of a breath, [no] This is the length of daytime in China at that time.In the center of Kailash, when the sun arrives at a point two hours and thirty minutes east of the meridian of the central sector of the east, morn­ing begins, and its arrival at a similar point west of the meridian of the cen­tral sector of the west marks the end of afternoon. Therefore, from the moment of the sun’s rising in the east until its arrival at the direct center of Kailash, it is morning, and seventeen hours and thirty minutes will pass. From there until it sets, it is afternoon, and seventeen hours and thirty minutes will have passed. The times of morning and afternoon added together come to thirty-five hours, which is the length of daytime when the sun reaches its northern limit at the direct center of Kailash.At the center of Himalaya, when the sun arrives at a point three hours east of the meridian of the central sector of the east, morning begins, and when the sun arrives at a point three hours west of the central sector of the west, afternoon ends. Applying the same calculations as above, and total­ing morning and afternoon times, produces a figure of thirty-six hours, which is the length of daytime at the center of Himalaya on the day of the sun’s northern limit.Therefore the reasons for the individual and differing lengths of daytime"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 139on the day of the sun’s northern limit at the direct centers of the six lands are the differing positions of sunrise and sunset, as explained. If the times or positions of rising and the times or positions of setting were all the same, and none were earlier or later, then the reason for the differing lengths of daytime would have to be put down to the speed of the sun over the six lands. This would not be a suitable reason, because on a single base, the centers of the six lands, for a time that is the duration of a whole day, a sin­gle sun disk cannot be validly perceived166 as moving quickly over one land and slowly over another land.There is an excellent presentation of this in the Pundarika Transmission., where it explains that, as the mean sun arrives at [in] each of the twelve houses in turn, the length of daytime differs at the center of Kailash because of the different positions of rising and setting, thereby producing earlier and later sunrises and sunsets. With this and our rather brief explanation, one can know how to apply it to the times of the mean sun arriving in the other houses at the remaining five lands.Most scholars of the past (such as those of the Jonang tradition) main­tained that at any of the centers of the six lands of the central sector of the south, regardless of the mean sun’s position in any of the houses, morning begins when the disk of the sun arrives at the direct center of the central sec­tor of the east. Therefore morning at the direct center of India, for exam­ple, on the central sector of the south corresponds exactly with noon at the direct center of the central sector of the east. Similarly noon at the center of the central sector of the south and morning at the center of the central sector of the west occur at the same time. The same processes are applied to the other sectors. Also, while they accept that six lagnam occur during the day and six occur at night, they assert that three will always occur in the morning and three in the afternoon. Others (such as Donkiin)168 take these assertions as a basis, and by doing so come to the conclusion that a clock­wise movement of the four seasons is wrong. They assert, therefore, a coun­terclockwise movement. However this is refuted in the Lamp Illum inating Clockwise Occurence,169 as a study of this text will reveal.They all maintain that whenever the sun arrives at the meridian of the central sector of the east, it will always be the beginning of morning at the direct center of the central southern sector, and that whenever it arrives at the meridian of the central western sector, it will be the end of afternoon. They also assert that afternoon on the meridian of the central eastern sec­tor and morning on the meridian of the central southern sector are at all"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"140 Part i: The External Worldtimes of the same duration. These assertions contradict logic, because it would follow that at the time of the mean sun’s arrival in the house of Aries, which corresponds to the spring equinox at the meridian of the cen­tral southern sector, afternoon on the meridian of the central eastern sec­tor at a point corresponding to Kailash and afternoon on the meridian of the central eastern sector at a point corresponding to India would be of the same length. This is because, firstly, at that time afternoon on the meridian of the central eastern sector at a point corresponding to Kailash and morning on the meridian of Kailash would be of the same duration. Secondly, at that particular time, morning on the central meridian of [112] Kailash and morning on the meridian of India are of the same length, and thirdly, morning on the central meridian of India and afternoon on the meridian of the central eastern sector at a point corresponding to India would also be of the same length. The first and third of these reasons you must evidendy accept.170 The middle reason is consistent with the facts and must be accepted, because when the disk of the sun arrives above the merid­ian of the central eastern sector at the time of the spring equinox of the meridian of the central southern sector, it is the simultaneous beginning of morning at the meridians of Kailash and India. Moreover, when the disk of the sun arrives over the meridian of the central southern sector, you accept that it is noon at the meridians of both Kailash and India.If it asserted that the original consequence is correct, that these two places would indeed have afternoons of the same length, then it would fur­ther follow that at the time of the spring equinox on the meridian of the central southern sector, a point on the meridian of the central eastern sec­tor corresponding to Kailash and a point on the meridian of the central eastern sector corresponding to India would have daytime of equal length, because at the time of the spring equinox on the meridian of the central southern sector, it must be accepted that these two points would have mornings of equal length, and it is accepted that afternoons are also of equal length. This consequence cannot be correct, because at the time of the spring equinox on the meridian of the central southern sector, the sun has reached its northern limit on the meridian of the central eastern sector. Therefore, at a point on the meridian of the central eastern sector corre­sponding to Kailash, daytime is thirty-five hours, and at a point on the meridian of the central eastern sector corresponding to India, daytime is thirty-three hours. That was the point made by the previous explanations.Therefore it should be known that within the six lands of Himalaya and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 141so forth, and the corresponding regions in the twelve sectors, the varying lengths of day and night throughout the sun’s northward and southward passages are due solely to the different positions of sunrise and sunset. Because of the same reason, it should be known that the appearance times of the houses also vary. To explain that briefly, the Great Commentary says on the sixty-third verse:Now by dividing the continent of Kailash, the appearance times of the twelve houses are discussed: [113] wThe house of Aries is in minutes.” This means that concerning the house of Aries, from the time of its arising to the end of its arising, the number of minutes is space, nine, hands, which means ninety more than two hundred.171This and further quotes speak of the appearance times of the houses. Using the direct center of Kailash at the meridian of the central southern sector as a basis, the appearance times of the houses, as the Great Commentary says, are 290 minutes172 for Aries, 260 minutes for Taurus, 200 minutes for Gem­ini, 300 for Cancer, 360 for Leo, and 390 for Virgo. The appearance times for the remaining six, Libra and so forth, are in reverse order, as this dia­gram will show:173Aries290PiscesTaurus260AquariusGemini200CapricornCancer300SagittariusLeo360ScorpioVirgo390LibraThe durations of six houses at night and the durations of six in daytime align perfectly with the length of day and night at any time of year. How­ever, you might wonder, “This is true when the sun is at the cusps of the signs, but how would they align when the sun is halfway through the house of Aries, for example?” This will be explained. First calculate how many zodiacal days have passed since the mean sun arrived in that particular house. [114] Then divide the appearance time of that house by thirty and multiply the result by the number of zodiac days that have passed since the mean sun arrived in that house. Subtract that figure from the appearance"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"142 Part i: The External Worldtime of the particular house the mean sun inhabits and begin the counting from the remainder. Include the appearance times of the next six houses, and add this to the result obtained by dividing by thirty the appearance time of the seventh house on from the house inhabited by the mean sun, and, as before, multiplying it by the number of zodiac days passed since the sun occupied that house. This is the length of daytime at that particular time.Similarly divide by thirty the appearance time of the seventh house on from the house occupied by the mean sun, multiply it as before, subtract that figure from the appearance time of this seventh house, and, counting from the remainder, include the appearance time of the other six houses, plus the result obtained by dividing the appearance time of the house occu­pied by the mean sun by thirty and multiplying it as before. This is the length of the nighttime at that particular time.In the tantra and commentary these appearance times are taught using the direct center of Kailash of the central southern sector as a basis. By the same reasoning used there, appearance times on the other sectors can also be shown. As depicted above, the appearance times of the house on Kailash are set as 290 minutes, 260, 200, 300, 360, and 390. On the basis of each sector being at the beginning of its own spring equinox, the order of the above appearance times on the second sector clockwise from the central southern sector, which is the western sector of the south, at the direct cen­ter of a region corresponding to Kailash, begins with Taurus for the first six houses, and then proceeds in reverse order for the six houses beginning with Scorpio.174 Likewise, on the remaining ten sectors at the center of a point corresponding to Kailash, when the mean sun has just entered the house for that sector’s spring equinox, the house that heralds the spring equinox is the first of the six houses of forward order, and the house of the autumn equinox is the first of the six houses of reverse order. From the cor­responding figures the lengths of day and night can be known.In this way the differing appearance times for the house in each of the six lands and twelve sectors account for the lengths of day and night. [115] This can be illustrated using the center of Kailash as an example. The begin­ning of Aries appears over the meridian of the central sector of the east. If the tail end of Aries appeared there also, then the Aries house would last for 300 minutes. The tail end of Aries borders Taurus, and therefore the place for Taurus to rise is from a point east of the meridian of the central east­ern sector representing the time the sun would take to travel for fifty min­utes.175 This means that the appearance time of Aries’s house is 290 minutes."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Stars and the Planets 143Similarly, the beginning of Taurus rises in the east at the place where the tail end of Aries rises. If the tail end of Taurus rose in the same place, then its appearance time would be 300 minutes. By rising east of the rising posi­tion of the beginning of Taurus, which is of a larger area than the end, its duration is 260 minutes. In this way the different rising places of the begin­nings and ends of the houses account for the different appearance times of the house. The sun lying within the stars of a particular house will also rise from the rising place of those stars. Therefore the different durations of the house account for the different rising and setting positions of the sun in the east and west. In the sixty-third verse of the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary it says:The appearance times of the house lessen and lengthen day and night, due to the sun’s position.176This requires a more detailed explanation, but because it would entail far too much explanation, this will have to do.The gola o f the earth: Emergence of the seasonsThe Great Commentary says in the sixth verse of the Realms chapter:[116] The sun dwells in one of the houses, Aries and so on, and on the twelve sectors the six seasons, the twelve months, and the twenty-four sides177 are formed from the orbiting of the wheel of houses.178As this and further quotations explain, when the sun dwells in the house of Aries, it is spring in both the eastern and central sectors of the south. At the same time, proceeding counterclockwise, in the western and central sectors of the east, it is the hot season. In the eastern sector of the east and in the western sector of the north, it is summer. In the central and eastern sector of the north, it is autumn. In the western and central sector of the west, it is early winter, and in the eastern sector of the west and western sec­tor of the south, it is late winter. This is how six seasons are formed upon the twelve sectors with the sun inhabiting the house of Aries.Similarly, when the sun dwells in Taurus, it is spring in the western and central southern sectors.

This formula should be similarly applied to the sun dwelling in the other houses.179The way in which the seasons are divided into four is as follows. When the sun dwells in Aiies, it is spring in the three southern sectors, summer in the three eastern sectors, autumn in the three northern sectors, and win­ter in the three western sectors. Similarly, when the sun dwells in Taurus, it is spring in the eastern sector of the west, in the western sector of the south, and in the central sector of the south. Then, proceeding counter­clockwise, it is summer in the next three sectors, autumn in the following three, and winter in the last three. This formula should be applied to the times of the sun dwelling in the other houses.Furthermore the formation, from the sun dwelling in a particular house, of the twelve smaller divisions of the seasons on the twelve sectors, such as middle spring and so forth, is as previously explained."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Abhidharma CosmologyRefuting any contradictions between the presentation of the world in the Kdlacakra and that o f the Abhidharma textsThis has three headings: [117]1.

Here the differences in the presentation of the world will be briefly set out. The relevant presentations in the tantra and the Great Commentary are as previously explained. The way it is presented in the Abhidharma is as follows:In the physical world below the realms of desire,the measurements of the air mandala:one million, six hundred thousand, and beyond number.The water and so forth, a hundred thousand times eleven, and a thousand times twenty.Outside the measurements are eight hundred thousand.The remainder is of gold.Across the mandalas of water and goldis a hundred thousand times twelve,three thousand, and four hundred and fifty.180"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"146 Part 1: The External WorldTherefore, according to this and other quotes from the Abhidharmakosa> the basic foundation of the billion four-continent worlds is the air mandala. It extends to yojana “beyond number,”181 and its depth is 1,600,000 yojana. Upon that air mandala, as foundations of each of the four-continent worlds, are individual water and gold mandalas.The water mandala is 800,000 yojana deep, and the gold mandala is320,000 yojana deep. Both the water and the gold mandala are 1,203,450 yojana in diameter, while the circumference of each is three times that number. The measurements of the foundations, therefore, are very differ­ent from those of the Kalacakra.On the differences regarding Meru and the continents upon that man­dala foundation, the Abhidharmakosa states:Meru is of four precious gems; eighty thousand under water, and as much as it is submerged, so above for eighty thousand yojana.182Thus Meru has four sides and is made of four precious gems. The east is of silver, the south of lapis lazuli, the west of red crystal, and the north of gold. Each side is also the color of these gems. Meru sinks eighty thousand yojana into the sea, while eighty thousand yojana are above sea level. That is the Abhidharma explanation. Here, however, [118] Meru is taught as being circular, black in the east, red in the south, golden in the west, and white in the north, and while its height is taught as being one hundred thousand yojana.183Again, the Abhidharmakosa says, “Yugandhara, Isadhara, and Khadira- ka,”184 and so on. Also, “In between them, at each of the seven, an ocean,”185 and so on lists the seven golden mountains and the seven bountiful lakes. Among them no continents are found. The shapes of the golden mountains and bountiful lakes are also said to be square. Here in the Kalacakra, a con­tinent is located between each mountain range and lake to form the seven continents, whose shapes are all circular.The Abhidharmakosa continues:The remainder is the outer ocean, of 322,000 yojana.Within that, Jambudvlpa of three sides.186"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Resolving Contradictions between Kalacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 147The outer Black Iron Mountains surround the the outer ocean, which con­tains the four continents and the eight lesser continents located at the four cardinal directions and in the eight intermediate directions, and which are piled into the ocean depths like heaps of rice. In the Kalacakra there are no seas between the Slta Mountains and the water mandala, and the area of the circular earth mandala is divided into twelve connecting continents or sectors. Furthermore the Abhidharmakosa says:Under this, at twenty thousand,the Hell of No Respite, and then no more,and above that, the seven hells.187This states that the lowest hell begins twenty thousand yojana beneath Jambudvlpa. Moreover, the hot hells, cold hells, and neighboring hells are spoken of as being directly below this continent of Jambudvlpa. The A b h i­dharmakosa continues:On life span within the hells,one day in Reviving Hell, and so forth,is a lifetime of the desire gods.Life spans, therefore, mirror those of the gods.Those of Blazing and of Hell of no Respite are an intermediate eon.188This is the Abhidharma explanation of the life spans within the hells. Also:From a store of sesame seeds,every hundred years one seed is taken until empty.Such time is the life span in the Hell of Blisters.The others are this times twenty.189[119] That is the explanation of life span within the cold hells. Here in the Kalacakra, the lowest hell is at a depth of 200,000 yojana from Greater Jambudvlpa, while the hot and cold hells are beneath Meru and the moun­tains, continents, and oceans of the earth mandala. Similarly, concerning the life spans of those within the hell realms, the first hell has a life span of one small eon, the second and third of an intermediate eon, the fourth and fifth of a supreme eon, the sixth and seventh of a great eon, while the eighth"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"148 Part 1: The External Worldis taught as having the life span the length of a world realm’s existence. As for the number of hells, no more than eight are mentioned, while the Abhidharmakosa and other texts talk of eighteen hells.In this way the Abhidharma and the Kálacakra presentations of the inner and outer worlds do not agree at all on shape, size, number, and so forth. Also the Kálacakra presentation of channels, winds, and their movements within the human body differ from those of other tantras. These are the points of doubt.How such doubts are expressedSome Indian scholars and even some Tibetan scholars maintain that the Kálacakra is not a perfect tantra, citing its contradiction with the Abhi­dharma and other tantras as their reason, and assert that the compilers and composers of its commentaries were not manifestations of Manjus'rl, Avalo- kitesvara, Vajragarbha, Vajrapáni, and so forth. In the Sheaves o f Oral Transmission it says:The knowledgeable and others have said that in the Kálacakra and those commentaries that follow it, there are many presenta­tions in contradiction with the Three Vehicles, and that those responsible for these texts, possessing the names Yaias, Pundarika, Vajragarbha, and Avalokitesvara, are not bodhisattvas at all.190In this quote, “the knowledgeable” refers to the master Sántipa, and “oth­ers” refers to other Indians. Tibetans who maintain this position include Chomden Rikral and Diipa Chenpo Ngok. [120]The venerable Rendawa said, “Like straightening a crooked tree,”191 and produced many consequences for the apparent contradictions with other tantras.Abhayákaragupta and some others maintain that the tantra and com­mentaries of Kálacakra are valid texts but that their presentations on the world and its inhabitants that contradict other tantras require interpreta­tion. Sheaves o f Oral Transmission says:Those parts taught in the Kálacakra that do not contradict other tantras, I follow as texts of our own scripture. Some, which are"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Resolving Contradictions between Kalacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 149contradictory because they follow the inclinations of certain dis­ciples, have been resolved. As to the rest, although the contra­dictions have not been resolved, there are no faults in them at all. This has been explained at great length and so they are per­fectly acceptable.192This means that whatever is taught in the tantra and commentaries and does not contradict the Guhyasamâja and others can be taken literally. Some topics, which do not actually contradict other tantras but which may appear as contradictory to the minds of some disciples, have been resolved. The rest, such as the presentations of the world, its inhabitants, and so forth, may contain unresolved contradictions, but because they have been explained previously in great detail as topics in need of interpretation, they are perfectly acceptable.When is something explained as being in need of interpretation? Sheaves o f Oral Transmission,, prior to the previous quote, says:In Kalacakra the space mandala is spoken of separately, and is there to lead disciples such as Süryaratha and others who cling to tirthika views to the definitive meaning. It is solely in need of interpretation and intentionally equivocal, like the teaching on the arrangement of the three world realms in the upper regions of Meru, asserted by those who follow Varâha,193 and so forth.194Therefore, in the Kalacakra, the assertion that the space element wind195 is separate from the other wind mandalas, such as the life-sustaining wind and so forth, and flows through the nostrils during normal existence requires interpretation. This indicates that the teachings on the presentation of the world also require interpretation. W ith this in mind they have “been explained at great length, and so they are perfectly acceptable.”[121] Some Tibetan lamas maintain that the teachings from the Kalacakra are definitive, while those from the Abhidharma tradition were taught to accord with the minds of the lower vehicles and are therefore provisional and not to be taken literally. To those who do not accept the Kalacakra as being valid at all, who talk of contradictions in the tantra and commentary and put forward proofs to dismiss it as an impure tantra, countless counterarguments dispelling their contradictions and refuting such proofs, as well as presentations that diverge from descriptions of world"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"150 Part i: The External Worldrealms in the Abhidharma, in the Five Categories, and in the sutras, can be found in Illum inating Reality, an extensive explanation of the tantra and commentary. Moreover commentary passages clearly show that the descrip­tion of a world realm in the Kalacakra and in the Abhidharma tradition can both be accepted literally. This will be explained.It may be wondered if those, such as Santipa, who state that the tantra and commentaries of Kalacakra are flawed texts accrue the heavy nonvirtue of abandoning the dharma? They do not. In the Great Commentary, in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary of the Gnosis chapter, it says:If the worldly go to hell through disparagement, then as all hold­ers of views disparage each other, all holders of views will go to hell because of their disparagement. If that is so, this contra­dicts all valid scripture and tenets, and some might think that all ethics and all morality are meaningless.196This doubt is raised, and the text continues with an answer:Therefore I will explain. The claim by the foolish that valid scripture and so forth would be contradicted is not so. Why? Because the intentions of holders of views are to examine mean­ings. Holders of views who express their views to one another are not at fault in their views, because these are states of mind that arise from examination of meaning, [122] and there are no thoughts of harming sentient beings but only thoughts of help­ing them.197As this quote explains, Santipa, Chomden Rikral, and others are only exam­ining the meanings of scripture, and their thoughts are totally focused on the benefit of the doctrine and sentient beings.Commentary on the text that dispels such doubtsThe passage to be explained runs from “Here worldly convention” up to “The Conqueror spoke of the dimensions of the world and the dimensions of the body for the purpose of the ma<ndala.” This passage dispels any notion that the teachings on the measurements and shape of this four- continent world contradict the presentation of this four-continent world as"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"found in the Abhidharma tradition.The Great Commentary s; ays:The Conqueror said tJ nat the size of a world realm was more than3,600,000 yojana and L that the size of a world realm was 400,000 yojana. Some will as] x, “Does the Conqueror speak the truth?”198In the Abhidharmakosa it : says:Across the mandak is of water and goldis a hundred thous .and times twelve,three thousand, ar id four hundred and fifty.199This means that multiplying by three200 the distance directly across the water and gold mandalas that act as the foundation of this four-continent world results in a circ umference of 10,350 more than 3,600,000. If this fig­ure and the figure of four hundred thousand yojana were both spoken by the Conqueror, a dou tbt could arise as to whether the Conqueror was speak­ing the truth. Thereffore the text from this part of the commentary sets out to dispel any contra diction between these two differing descriptions of the size and shape of this one four-continent world. [123]The text at this point can be explained in detail. “Ultimately,” or in real­ity, it is not possil tie to conclusively measure this four-continent world exclusively accordii ig to the measurements found in either the Abhidharma or the Kálacakra. ' The descriptions here of the four-continent world are “mere worldly co nventions.”201 The differing types of karma of sentienit beings of differing; dispositions have brought into existence differing shapes and sizes for this Ífour-continent world, and as they exist, so the Conqueror taught sentient brings the measurements of this world realm in accord with their differing d ispositions, and as he taught them, so they appeared in accord with thei r variety of karma.How do the differing shapes and sizes of this four-continent world arise from the differ'ing types of karma of sentient beings? “By the pov/er of virtue” within virtuous sentient beings, some parts of this four-con tinent world are bles.sed with all things pleasant, and “by the power of de.merit” in those of nonvirtue, other parts of the world are devoid of ha’ppiness and well-bein g.It may be t'hat the personal results202 of those with meritorious ka rma andResolving Contradictions bet, ween Kálacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 151"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"152 Part i: The External Worldof those whose karma lacks such merit manift ’st as individual environments for the experience of happiness and suffering, b »ut for this one four-continent world, there are two completely different pre¿ mentations of shape and size. One is according to Abhidharma, and the otht ir is according to Kalacakra. How do these two contrasting presentations ari se from the differing karma of sentient beings? This is explained by an exa imple, beginning with the words “In a cave of five cubits.” In a cave five cu bits in height, length, and width lives “one without attachment,” i.e., an airhat or a powerful bodhi- sattva. In that cave this person is devoted to acci umulating merit and wis­dom, and by the power of such devotion and by th e force of magical powers, a universal emperor arrives with his vast army and 1 enters the small cave. At that time no one enlarged the cave, nor were the u niversal emperor and his armies squashed together in the cave. [124] This ii > a phenomenon validly perceived as existing, and although such an accomp dishment seems impos­sible, in actuality it is not, because it is brought aboi it by the inconceivable power of the mighty bodhisattva’s or arhat’s merit ai id wisdom.In the same way, on the one Meru of this four-ct ontinent world realm, two completely different sets of shape and size measui rements, one from the Abhidharma and one from the Kalacakra, can be valit ily perceived to exist. When the universal emperor and his armies entered the five-cubit cave, they were not crowded together nor did the cave grow larger. Such a non­contradictory occurrence was due to the might of th e bodhisattva’s or arhat’s merit and wisdom. Similarly, on this one four-cc mtinent world, one set of measurements of shape and size as taught in the Abhidharma and a completely different set as taught in the Kalacakra cam exist on the one Meru. This congruent and noncontradictory occurrence is due to the sep­arate types of karma of the intended disciples of the Abhidharma and tamtras such as Guhyasamája on the one hand and the 1 intended disciples of the Kalacakra on the other.Just as the merit and wisdom of that bodhisattva or arhat are incon­ceivable, so too are the powers or capabilities of the commion karma of sen­tient beings. In the Abhidharmasamuccaya it says:The karma that produces various external phenomen.a is incon­ceivable. The karma connected with jewels, mantra, * medicine, a nd secret lore is inconceivable. The karma of the powers of every yogi is inconceivable. The karma of the might o f bodhi- sa.ttvas is inconceivable.203"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Resolving Contradictions between Kâlacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 153However, if the world taught in the Abhidharma and the world taught in the Kalacakra are equal in the sense that they both exist, then it should be perfectly acceptable for the world with the Abhidharma measurements to be taught here in the Kalacakra. [125] So what special reason is there for teaching a world system contradictory to the Abhidharma? The purpose of the teaching of a four-continent world realm of four hundred thousand yojana as found in the Kâlacakra and yet in contradiction to the Abhi­dharma is found in the words of the Great Commentary, “As without, so within the body.”204 This means that this external four-continent world realm is a base to be purified by meditating upon the mandalas that corre­spond to this world realm. The body, whose measurements correspond to the measurements of the world, is also to be purified by meditating on the mandala circles that correspond to the measurements of the body. In the Great Commentary it says, “The body is said to be the mandala.”205 There­fore external Meru, in measurements that are mere worldly convention, is one hundred thousand yojana high. The height of the human spine is one cubit. This makes the height of the body four cubits. The height of Meru is one hundred thousand yojana. This makes the height of a four-continent world realm four hundred thousand yojana. If this four-continent world were to be explained in the Kâlacakra as being other than four hundred thousand yojana, as taught in the Abhidharma tradition, then the corre­spondence indicated by the quote, “As without, so within the body,” as pre­viously explained, would not hold. This is because Meru as explained in the Abhidharma tradition is not a hundred thousand yojana, and this would not correspond to the one cubit height of the spine. Because of this, the measurements of a four-continent world realm here in the Kâlacakra are taught conventionally to be four hundred thousand yojana, and as they are taught, so they exist.However, it has been stated:As gold is burned and rubbed,my word is to be accepted by examining well,not out of respect.206Good gold when burned turns red, when cut it shows white, and when rubbed it turns yellow; in these ways it should be tested. Similarly the words of the Buddha should undergo three tests, and when a teaching is seen to be pure, it should be accepted as valid, not merely out of respect or because"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"154 Part i: The External Worldof bias. [126] However it is not the case here that we can say with valid and deep analysis that the Conqueror saw and ascertained this four-continent world realm to be solely four hundred thousand yojana and therefore spoke and declared this measurement in the Kálacakra. This is because, as previ­ously explained, there are many differing measurements and shapes of this four-continent world due to the power of the various types of karma of sentient beings.The measurements of this four-continent world are not exclusively as taught here in the Kálacakra. However the teaching and assertion of a 400,000-yojana world here plays a special role in the creation of merit and wisdom for entering the generation stage and dien the completion stage. This explains the affirming purpose for teaching a four-continent world realm of four hundred thousand yojana in the Kálacakra. The negating purpose is to refute the notion held by Suryaratha and others that this sin­gle dominion of Brahmá covers an area of ten million yojana.In the Kálacakra the presentations of the measurements of a world realm together with descriptions of the movements of its five planets, its astron­omy, and its zodiac of the houses and so forth, are not only for the purposes of inner and outer application, but they have another purpose. The think­ing of the Abhidharmakosa and that of the Veda tenets are not in agreement on various features of this four-continent world realm. One of those dis­agreements is the false assertion made by followers of the Vedas that the dominion of Brahmá, this sole four-continent world, is of an area of ten million yojana. Suryaratha and others cling to this assertion, and by revers­ing that, and in order to fully ripen them, this measurement of the domin­ion of Brahmá is destroyed.Therefore, “having seen the Buddhist Abhidharma” teachings on the four-continent world, [127] do not think that the Kálacakra explanation is mistaken, with its measurements of four hundred thousand yojana, because the movements of the planets, the astronomy, and the zodiac of the houses as they are explained here can be actually confirmed by the charts.However207 the Conqueror taught in the Abhidharmakosa that the meas­urements of this four-continent world realm were “across the mandalas of water and gold a hundred thousand times twelve,”208 which, as previously explained, results in a circumference of over 3,600,00 yojana. Similarly, in the Kálacakra, he taught this four-continent world realm to have a meas­urement of four hundred thousand yojana. If that is so, does not the Con­queror speak falsely, as some assert? The Conqueror did teach different"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Resolving Contradictions between Kâlacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 155and individual measurements and shapes in the Abhidharma sutras and in the Kalacakra, but the wise who hold to the law of cause and effect should not believe in utterances such as “The Conqueror speaks falsely,” because, as explained previously, on this one four-continent world realm there are intended disciples of the Abhidharma, Guhyasamâja, and so forth, and intended disciples of the Kalacakra. These disciples have different kinds of karma, and with these types of karma as dominant conditions,209 different measurements and shapes appear, and the Buddha taught in accord with such appearances as they appeared to the minds of sentient beings.It might be wondered to what particular text the Abhidharma men­tioned here210 refers? Lamas of the past say that the Abhidharma composed by the master Vasubandhu was written about three hundred years after the Great Commentary, and therefore it is not the Abhidharma referred to here. So which is it then? They maintain that it either refers to the Seven Great Texts o f the Abhidharm a or to the Great Abhidharm a o f Specific Explanation, which is an extensive and detailed exposition of the meanings of the Seven Great Texts o f the Abhidharm a and is also known as Abhidharma. However the phrase from the Great Commentary “having seen the Buddhist Abhi­dharma” looks like a prophecy. [128] Also the Abhidharma of the master Vasubandhu is well established throughout Tibet and other lands, and I wonder if the noble Avalokitesvara211 was not thinking of a text known as the “Abhidharma” to be written in the future by Acârya Vasubandhu?It might also be wondered if, in order to destroy or reverse the wrong view, held by Süryaratha and others, that this four-continent world covers an area of ten million yojana, it would surely have been sufficient to teach the measurements as found in the Seven Great Texts o f the Abhidharma. What need was there to categorically state the measurements found in the Kalacakra? In order to destroy this wrong view, it was necessary to state the measurements of this world realm together with its planets, its calculations, and its zodiac, because the movements of the five planets, their calcula­tions, the way the circle of houses revolves, and the way the sun and moon move within it are taught in the Kalacakra and are ascertained by an earth- drawn chart. When this happens a conviction is born that these teachings can be held as being literally true, which in turn produces a conviction in the measurements of this world, and so the wrong view will be reversed. Otherwise, by just teaching the presentation of the world as explained in the Abhidharma, it would be difficult to destroy such wrong views as those held by Süryaratha and others. The Root Tantra says212 that “dispositions of"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"156 Part n The External Worldsentient beings are varied / they know of various tenets” such as ours and others. “They follow various paths” and doctrines taught by others. “Proud of their knowledge” of phenomena, “the conceited will never come / under the might of the omniscient one / unless presented with reasons” that prove and disprove and that create conviction regarding our tenets and those of others.But surely it is wrong to teach something that does not validly exist instead of teaching the validly established truth? [129] That is not neces­sarily so. A butcher searching for animals that he will definitely kill may ask someone if he has seen the animal he is going to kill. Moved by compas­sion for those to be killed, the person will reply that they have not seen it even though they have. By such a lie the animals he is seeking to kill and the would-be killer himself are both benefited, and this lie becomes a cause for great merit. If emptiness is truthfully taught to someone unfit for teach­ings on profound emptiness, such a teaching would harm that person, and those truthful words would become a cause for the Hell of No Respite and so forth. One of the root downfalls of a bodhisattva is “Teaching emptiness to those who have not prepared their minds.”213The verse beginning “Miserly hungry ghosts”214 expresses the incon­ceivable potential of the karma of sentient beings. By the force of their miserly nongiving, sentient beings are born as hungry ghosts. If they were to enter a house fully stocked with food and drink, by the force of that karma they would see it as a mountain totally bare of food and drink. For those wrongdoers born into hell, a beautiful house assumes the form of sharp weapons and sharp leaves and so forth. Similarly the verse beginning “Having gained the siddhi of the world below”215 teaches the inconceiv­able power of the yogis who have gained the powers to make use of the worlds below the earth. They possess the power to travel to the cities of the goddesses and clearly see this solid and firm earth as hollow. These verses are from the Root Tantra.The following passage beginning “Therefore the measurements of the world” gives a summary of the above explanation. “Therefore,” in keeping with the previous reasons, “the words that the Conqueror spoke on the measurements of the world” were spoken because sentient beings have gath­ered various types of karma, and in tune with that karma, “each sentient being has predispositions in their minds by whose power” the world appears in many differing aspects. [130] In keeping with those appearances the Tathagata likewise taught the measurements of the world, but “nowhere"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Resolving Contradictions between Kálacakra and Abhidharma Cosmology 157did the Tathàgata look at the measurements of the world under the power of attachment and speak on them from” a false and dual appearance of “internal subject and external object,” without regard to the way the world appears to sentient beings.This has been a detailed explanation of this part of the commentary. To summarize: it is not right to use one set of measurements of the world found in the Abhidharma or in the Kálacakra to refute the other. The Abhi­dharma explanation is used by Acârya Nàgàrjuna and others when explain­ing the outside world as a purification base for the generation and completion stages of Guhyasamàja. If there were no outside world with no such measurements, the path of purification would also be invalid. Simi­larly, if there were no outside world with measurements as explained in the Kálacakra, it would not be valid as the purification base for the path, as expressed in the quote, “As without, so within the body.”"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Pa r t 2T h e Inner W o rld o f Sentient Beings"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Development of the BodyA presentation o f the inner world o f sentient beings[131] This has two main headings:1.

The Great Commentary, in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary, says:“At the time of death, the seed possessing the characteristics of the five5 will definitely arise. Like a body of a dream, the empty body of imprints abandons the composite of subtle particles but does not cease.” The body of imprints formed from the imprints"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"i62 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsof karma does not cease. Once again it will take hold of a body composed of subtle particles.6[132] Thus it is stated that the bardo body has left behind the composite of subtle particles. Great scholars (such as Kumara) have also said that the batdo body has the form of a mental phenomena source.7Taken literally, the above quotes contradict each other. Whether this is due to individual traditions8 or whether the Kalacakra passage is referring to the absence of the kind of subtle particles of the body of the prior-state existence is something to be examined.How consciousness enters the blood and fluid after bardo has ceasedThis is under two headings:1. Defining the entering consciousness2. How the consciousness entersDefining the entering consciousnessA s the bardo is coming to an end, the mind at that time is the very subtle mind of clear light. That mind and the mind that crosses over into the womb are of preceding and succeeding instants. In this way the mind that has just entered the womb is also the very subtle mind of clear light. Such a mind exists alongside innate bliss and is known as the foundation con­sciousness9 and as innate mind. The Great Commentary, on the fifteenth verse of the Inner chapter, says:While the consciousness is in the womb, it is the foundation consciousness, a gnosis of the highest bliss.10And farther on:Mother, father, and foundation consciousness are one at the time of bliss.11W hat is the difference between the foundation consciousness assigned to the mind that has just entered the womb and the foundation conscious­ness explained as the “foundation of all” by those who assert eight types"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 163of consciousnesses? Generally there are many differing assertions concern­ing the mind that has just entered the womb. The Abhidharmakosa says, “Birth existence is with delusion,”12 thereby declaring that the mental con­sciousness is one of mental affliction. In the Abhidharmasamuccaya and similar texts, those who assert the collection of eight types of conscious­nesses describe it as a foundation consciousness, which is an untaught,13 unobstructed phenomenon and associated with neutral feelings.Highest tantras, such as the Kalacakra, are in agreement that the clear- light nature of mind is the basis of all things in samsara and nirvana. [133] This is the clear light of a bardo death, and in the Great Commentary this is referred to as “the foundation.” Death clear light is also referred to as the “foundation” in the Great Commentary on the seventh verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:Like this the elements quickly weaken. Then “the mind is the fire at the end of darkness,” which means that the foundation consciousness is placed in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms empty of all objects, dwelling in the middle.14Therefore, in this tantra and its commentary, the mind that has just crossed over to the womb and the mind of the clear light of death are spoken of as a foundation consciousness. However this is not a foundation conscious­ness that is distinct from the mental consciousnesses, as is taught by those who assert the eight kinds of consciousness. That type of foundation con­sciousness is distinguished by many characteristics, such as being at all times an untaught, unobstructed phenomenon, associated only with neu­tral feelings, of unclear focus and apprehension. Moreover the conscious­ness at the cessation of the bardo and the mind of the clear light of death can become virtuous minds, can become associated with feelings of bliss, and are consciousnesses of a clear focus and apprehension arising from a clarity15 “in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms empty of all objects, dwelling in the middle.” Therefore the thinking behind calling this mind “the foundation” is that it is the foundation for the arising of all things in samsara and nirvana. As an entity, however, it is a mental consciousness. The Great Commentary says in the Gnosis chapter:How does it grasp the womb? Solely as a mental consciousness with the support of bodhicitta.16"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"164 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsThis clearly states that the mental consciousness alone, supported by a base of red and white bodhicitta, is the consciousness of conception.How the consciousness enters[134] Generally four places of conception for sentient beings can be ascer­tained. They are the womb, heat and moisture, the egg, and miraculous birth. On miraculous birth the Abhidharmakosa says:Hell beings, gods, and those between existences are born miraculously.17Hell, god realms, and the bardo are characterized by taking miraculous birth. The text continues:Hungry ghosts can also be born from the womb.18This means that hungry ghosts may be of miraculous birth or womb birth.For humans and animals, four kinds.19This states that all four kinds of birth can be found within the human and animal realm.When describing the four kinds of birth found in the animal realm, the Great Commentary, on the fourth verse of the Realms chapter, says:“Animals are of four kinds of birth.” Birth from an egg would be for the garuda hawk and others. It is an air-element birthplace.Birth from a womb includes the mighty elephant and others. It is a fire-element birthplace. Birth from heat and moisture is for some insects, butterflies, ants, and so forth. It is a water-element birthplace. Miraculous birth is for trees and is an earth-element birthplace. Similarly great miraculous birth is a taste birthplace.20Regarding this quote the noble Kumaramati says:Including trees as animal birth is a tenet of the Jains.21"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 165Although he is refuting the Great Commentary here, this passage is not actually classifying trees, mountains, and so forth as animal births. So what is the explanation? In Kalacakra all existent phenomena are assigned to the five or six elements. Here, in order to assign the four kinds of birth to five elements, miraculous birth is divided into two types, namely, mere and great. Mere miraculous birth is assigned to the earth element. “Great mirac­ulous birth” refers to well-known miraculous births, and “taste” refers to the space element.22 Therefore trees and so forth, which mainly grow from earth, are explained as being of miraculous birth, but this does not teach that trees are animal births.O f the four kinds of birth found in the human realm, birth from egg would be, for example, that of the Sthaviraklrti and Upaklrti. An example of birth from heat and moisture would be that of King Murdhata. A mirac­ulous birth would be that of Aryadeva.[135] There are four kinds of birth, and sentient beings are classified into six types, five types, etc. However here in the Inner chapter, which deter­mines the inner world, the primary ascertainment is that of a sentient being possessed of a womb-born human body of the six elements23 who will med­itate in two stages in order to attain the supreme siddhi of enlightenment in this life. What is the purpose of such an ascertainment? It is to know and understand the bases of purification for the generation and completion stages as well as the locations for the practice of penetrative focusing in the completion stage. Therefore the development of a womb-born human body of the six elements is explained.Amid the blood and fluid of mother and father in union arises the men­tal consciousness of the previous bardo being. This is a very subtle mind of clear light, known as the “foundation.” The consciousness, fluid, and blood are united within the mother’s womb, from which will develop the body of a sentient being. This agglomeration of fluid, blood, and consciousness dwelling in the mother’s secret lotus24 is supported by the element of earth of the mother’s secret lotus, gathered together by her element of water, matured by her element of fire, made larger by her element of air, and given the room to grow by her element of space in its aspect of empty space within the womb. The five elements that make up this union of fluid, blood, and consciousness within the womb also perform individual func­tions. The earth element gives it weight and solidity, the water element gives it moisture, and it is matured by the fire element. The element of air agglomeration, which is the seed of the element-originated25 ten winds that will develop in the future, enlarges this agglomeration of fluid, blood, and"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"i66 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsconsciousness. The element of space provides the room for growth. Con­cerning the developmental role of the winds, the Great Commentary says at this point:The ten great winds, such as the life-sustaining wind, etc.,enlarge the form of this seed.26“W ind” here must refer to the seeds of the ten winds, as mentioned above, because at this particular time the channels for the ten winds have not developed, and if that is so, then of course neither have the winds them­selves. To say that “the ten winds” in the above passage refers to the inter­nal winds of the mother s body contradicts the Great Commentary in this section when it says, “This speaks of the activity of the seed’s own ele­ments,”27 thereby confirming that this passage is referring to the air ele­ment of the seed of fluid and blood itself.Development in the womb[136] The time from conception in the womb until death is taught in cor­respondence with the ten avatara, or incarnations, of Visnu. These ten, beginning with the fish, are tales of Visnu and can be related in chrono­logical order.Once when the four Vedas had sunk into the ocean, Visnu manifested as a fish and recited them. In the form of a turtle he hoisted up the world and held it there. In the form of a wild pig he crushed the worlds as far as the realms of Brahma. W ith his lower half in the form of a man and his upper in the form of a lion, he killed Hiranyakafipu, the king of the asura demons, by tearing out his stomach. Manifesting as a midget he deceived the demon Bali by taking three steps. Manifesting as Rama of the axe, the son of the Brahmin Jamadagni, he murdered those of the royal ksatriya caste, such as Arjuna, and put an end to their rule. In his manifestation as Rama, son of King Das'aratha, his wife was snatched by Ravana, the ten-throated raksas of Lanka, and so accompanied by the monkey Hanu- man he defeated the raksas. As Krsna he worked for sentient beings in the age of troubles.28 He manifested as Buddha Sakyamuni and purified him­self of the former murder of kings. As Klrti,29 the son of a Kalkl Brahmin, he will appear in the future and, having tamed many beings, a new era will begin."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 167Concerning the last two avatara, the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary from the Gnosis chapter says the following:The ninth avatara of Visnu, the god of wealth, is the Buddha.Visnu will manifest as Buddha Sakyamuni. His purpose will be as follows. In the past, in the realms of the asura, those who were not killed or defeated by the god of wealth will be born as low castes at the time of the Buddha. In order to send them to hell, he will deceptively refute the doctrine of rituals, and by doing so the extensive words of Bharata, the words of Gita,30 and the words of the Veda will be refuted. Having refuted them, he will then teach the lower castes perverted doctrine and expound the ten perfections by saying, “practice the perfection of giving,” and so forth, up to “do not practice the paths of the ten nonvirtuous deeds.” [137] He will teach the four immeasur- ables, the abandonment of the ten nonvirtues, and other per­verted doctrine. By such teaching, the latent'dispositions of the lower castes will be awakened. They will shave their heads and put on the yellow robes to become monks. These lower castes, who in former times in the land of the asura were not defeated and killed by the wealth god Visnu, will refute the Brahmins. By doing so they will go to hell. Therefore, at the time Visnu man­ifests as the Buddha, the ordinary lower castes are formerly inhabitants of the land of the asura. In order to send them to hell, Visnu enacts this deception of manifesting as the Buddha.The tenth avatara is the lineage bearer. In the land of Sham- bhala the wealth god Visnu will incarnate as the Brahmin Klrti, and he will ride a stone horse and with spears of kusa31 will kill the barbarians and perform the fire offering of “plentiful gold.”Once again the land will become Brahmin.32According to the Great Commentary these last two incarnations as detailedhere are not found in early Vedic texts:In this way, many false words were written by malicious Brah­mins at the time of the Buddha. These are not in early Vedic literature.33"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"i68 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsThese ten avatâra of Visnu, then, are taught as:Fish, turtle, and pig, man-lion and midget, the two Ram as and Krsna, the Buddha and Klrti, to make up the ten.34The accounts of the ten avatâra of Visnu are spoken of in the Great Com­mentary:On the outside, the narratives such as that of the fish and oth­ers, were written by malicious Brahmin sages to deceive the fool­ish. Such works are causes that result in hell. These are explained in greater detail in the later section on the supreme and unchanging gnosis.35[138] Thus the accounts of the ten avatâra as related above are taught to be lies. Although these stories, which are well known to outsiders, are fabri­cations, the terminology of the ten avatâra is used to explain the corre­sponding times from the first moment of conception to death.These are explained in order. The agglomeration of blood, fluid, and consciousness within the lotus of the mother’s womb is the bodhicitta vajradhara, or mind vajradhara.36 Using Visnu terminology the first two months in the womb are designated the time of the fish, because the form of this agglomeration is like the red rohita fish. In the first of these two months, the blood and fluid exists devoid of any channels. In the second month the heart develops, and within it the ten very subtle channels of the heart are formed. These become the supports of the winds, such as the life wind and so forth. The navel is created, and within it develops the twelve very subtle channels that become the supports for the sixty-four channels of the navel cakra.The third and fourth month of pregnancy is the time of the turtle. The turtle has four limbs and a head in the forms of protrusions. Similarly, from the beginning of the third month, the body within the womb devel­ops, and mere indications of limbs and face start to protrude. At the end of the third month the limbs and throat are roughly formed, hence the resemblance to a turtle. From the beginning of the fourth month until its"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 169completion the protrusions of the hands, feet, face, throat, etc., develop steadily, and the very subtle innate and sambhoga channels are formed in the areas of the six major limb joints and of the face and throat.From the fifth month until birth is the time of the wild pig. The fifth month sees the beginnings of the 360 bones formed in dependence on the flesh, joints other than the six major joints, as well as the sense sources. In the sixth month blood and flesh separate, and feelings of suffering and hap­piness are experienced. In the seventh month it is said that the being inside the womb remembers its previous existence. [139] Concerning this the Great Commentary says:By the power of clairvoyance the former existence is remem­bered. Divorced from imprints in the mind, the sufferings of existence are held in contempt, while the path of the buddhas is praised.37Concerning the 360 bones, the Womb States o fN a n d a Sutra is quoted in the commentary Illu m in a tin g Reality:Nine bones joined at the skull, two connected bones of the cheek, the teeth possess thirty-two, and similarly, their roots.The base of the ears, bones of the nape, palate bones, bones of the nose, those of the throat, and of the chest; in total, twenty bones.Four bones in the eyes, two pairs in the shoulders; the two hands and fingers; in total, fifty bones.The upper back has eight bones, the spine thirty-two, all of which have channels, they are therefore of four parts."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"170 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsThe bones of the right rib cage are thirteen interconnected.Those connected of the left are also thirteen.Within this succession of bones three sets are interconnected, two sets have joints, the remainder are unconnected.The right and left thighs in short have fifty bones.The bones within the body in total number 360.38The meaning of the quote beginning “By the power of clairvoyance the for­mer existence is remembered” is understood differently by different com­mentators. Some scholars (such as Palden Lama Dampa) explain such clairvoyance in the womb as a natural occurrence and quote the A dorn­m ent to the Sky Sutra quoted by Khenpo Paltsek39 in his Compendium o f Sutra:In the thirtieth week the limbs, blood, skin, and pores are all completely developed. From then on it dwells in the mother’s womb amid blood and fetid smell. [140] At that time it remem­bers past lives and in great despair thinks, “When I emerge from my mother, I will not take birth in another mother’s womb, and I will strive toward virtue with constant effort.” However the process of birth, being squeezed by the mother’s body, the touch of the earth, the touch of hands, the pain of being washed, all dqminate the mind and body, and past lives are forgotten.40On this the omniscient Buton says:The meaning of the quote is that during pregnancy, wind dwells within the central channel like a stick, without inhalation or exhalation, and because of this, a quasi-clairvoyance arises that remembers the past.41"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 171Other scholars (such as Choje Chok)42 say that although such experiences may arise during the time in the womb, they are like dreams and, therefore, are not certain to accumulate karma.According to the commentary Illu m in a tin g Reality:Those of the past have applied this to womb births in general, but these are qualities whose particular causes have preceded them. Therefore it seems that these qualities, such as clairvoy­ance, must be special phenomena made manifest in the womb by the power of particular causes created in previous lives. This my omniscient master has said. Even though the being in the womb possesses that particular quality, for six months it will reside in the womb in a kind of unconsciousness and with no memory. Then at this particular time it remembers in this way.It was in order to make this point that this was spoken of.43By the end of the seventh month, the eyebrows, hair, and the five inner sense sources, which began to develop in the fifth month, are now com­plete.From the time of conception to the end of the first month no channels have developed. From the beginning of the second month, two hundred channels develop each day for the next twelve months. Therefore thirteen months from conception and twelve months from the growth of the first channel, 72,000 channels are complete. [141] From the actual text it is not clear which of the three types of days is being used in these calculations.44 However, if “day” is taken to be a solar day, then a month also must be taken to mean thirty solar days. Alternatively, if a month is taken to mean a lunar month, then a day too must be read as a lunar day. This is because thirty times twelve multiplied by two hundred gives a figure of 72,000.After the inner sense sources have developed, marrow forms inside the bones in the eighth month. The eye and other inner sense sources expand to create the organ of the tongue with its ability to taste. After the sense organ of the tongue has developed its ability to taste, urine and feces are formed.Concerning the emergence from the mother’s womb, some beings emerge as soon as nine months are completed, some are born in the tenth month, some in the eleventh, while others may be born in the twelfth month. For all of them, the fifth month in the womb until birth is designated the time"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"172 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsof the wild pig. The reason for this being that just as a pig lives on the filth of excrement and so forth, the being in the womb lives only .on the foul­ness that is the essence of the mother’s digested food and drink.The time of emergence from the mother’s womb is designated the time of the man-lion. This is because at the time of birth the being inside its mother opens up the womb. This correlates with the time when Visnu, in the form of a man-lion with his upper half a lion and his lower a man, killed Hiranyakasipu by tearing out his stomach. The time from birth until the growth of teeth is known as the time of the midget, because that is the form of the child.Thirteen months after conception, the expansion of the channels is complete. The beginning of the fourteenth month marks the beginning of the expansion of the red and white elements, as well as loss of two chan­nels each day from the 72,000 channels. In girls, the red menstrual ele­ment increases until the time of menstruation at the age of twelve. [142] After that the increase is halted. In boys, the white fluid element increases until the time of semen emission at the age of sixteen. From then on the increase is halted.After birth the teeth appear. Eight years later they fall out and are replaced. This is the period of Rama of the Axe. From the time the teeth are replaced up to the age of sixteen is the time of Ramana. From sixteen until the onset of gray hair is the period of Krsna. From the growth of gray hair until the day of death is designated as the time of the Buddha. This is because, just as the Buddha has a mind at peace and is of stable behavior, so the aged are of peaceful minds and, because they lack the sexual com­pany of women, are of stable behavior.Death itself is designated the time of the lineage bearer. This is because the term kalkin means to make all as one caste. Similarly, at the time of death, all the elements come together as one.That concludes the formation of the body.Phenomena supported by such a bodyThis is under two headings:1. A general explanation of such phenomena2. A particular explanation of channels, winds, and drops"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Development o f the Body 173There are many phenomena supported by the body of a being endowed with the six elements. They include the six elements, namely, space, air, fire, water, earth, and gnosis; the six aggregates, consisting of consciousness, mental formations, feelings, recognition, form, and gnosis; the six organs of ear, nose, eyes, tongue, body, and mind; the six sensory source objects, namely, sound, smell, form, taste, contact, and mental phenomena; the six faculties, made up of the secret place, the voice, the hands, the legs, the anus, and the supreme organ; [143] the six activities of these faculties, namely, urinating, speaking, taking, moving, excreting, and emitting fluid; the six winds, namely, life-sustaining, coexisting, upwardly moving, per­vading, naga, downwardly expelling; another classification of winds, namely, joyful wind, turtle, lizard, devadatta, dhanamjaya, and the inborn joyful wind; the six cakras, consisting of the crown, heart, throat, forehead, navel, and secret place. Also included are the 21,600 winds, the 72,000 channels and, as mentioned in the Womb States o fN a n d a Sutra, the 360 bones and 360 joints.None of the above phenomena are beyond the nature of the six ele­ments. The six aggregates from consciousness to gnosis are respectively phenomena of space, air, fire, earth, water, and gnosis. Moreover the six aggregates and the six elements are classified as method and wisdom, with the six aggregates as method and the six elements as wisdom. If they are individually matched up, the aggregate of gnosis is method and the ele­ment of space is wisdom. The aggregate of form is method and the element of air is wisdom. The aggregate of discernment is method and the element of fire is wisdom. The aggregate of feelings is method and the element of water is wisdom. The aggregate of mental formations is method and the ele­ment of earth is wisdom.

Furthermore the faculties are method and the activities they control are wisdom. In this way each can be paired up with its respective counterpart.The life-sustaining, coexisting, upwardly moving, pervading, ndga, and downwardly expelling winds are phenomena of the space, air, fire, water, earth, and gnosis elements. Similarly, joyful, turtle, lizard, devadatta, dhamnajaya, and the innate joyful wind are phenomena of the space, air, fire, water, earth, and gnosis elements, respectively.

The upper tips of all three are located between the eyebrows. The lower tips are found at the bhaga or male organ and at the tip of the anus. At the cakras the left and right chan­nels entwine themselves around the central channel to form a channel knot."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"178 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsAbove the navel the three channels are known by various names. [146] Sun channel, pingala, rasana, path of the sun, and so forth are terms used to denote the right channel. Moon channel, igasa? 7 lalana, path of the moon, and so forth are names given to the left channel. The Rahu chan­nel, supreme channel, and so forth are names of the central channel. The left and right channels below the navel are known as the excrement and urine channels. Similarly the central channel below the navel is known as sankhini, the Kalagni channel, the channel of descending fluid, and the supreme channel. The sankhini and the central channel are also referred to as dhiiti.At points on the avadhutl48 are cakras entwined by the left and right channels. O f these there are six: the cakra of the secret place with its thirty- two channel petals, the cakra of the navel with sixty-four channel petals, the cakra of the heart with its eight channel petals, the cakra of the throat with thirty-two channel petals, the cakra of the forehead with sixteen channel petals, and the cakra of the crown with its four channel petals.Concerning the makeup of the thirty-two channel petals of the secret- place cakra, six petals branch off from the hub of the cakra. These are the six inner channel petals. Four of these split into two to make eight, and together with the remaining undivided petals make up the ten intermedi­ate channel petals. O f these ten, six split into two to make twelve petals, and with the remaining four make up the sixteen outer petals. The formation of the thirty-two channel petals of the secret-place cakra then is in three lay­ers. The inner layer has six petals, the intermediate has ten, and the outer sixteen. The Great Commentary, on the forty-sixth verse of the Inner chap­ter, clearly describes the thirty-two petals:The secret place has thirty-two petals. O n the sixteen outer petals are the vowel channels. On the ten inner petals are the channels of the aggregates and the channels of the elements. O n the innermost petals are the six empty49 channels.50The formation of the sixty-four petals of the navel cakra is as follows. Four channel petals branch out from the center of the cakra. Each of these petals branches off into two to make eight petals. [147] These eight again split up to make sixteen petals. Except for the four petals located at the four inter­mediate points among these sixteen, each of the other twelve divide into"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 179five to make sixty petals, making a total of sixty-four. However on the forty-first verse of the Inner chapter of the Great Commentary it says:The heart of the navel wheel possesses four petals. Outside of that there are eight. Beyond that are twelve.51Doesn’t this say that eight petals branch off into twelve? How, then, could it divide into sixteen? O f the sixteen petals that branch off from the eight, four are empty channels and twelve are the wind-movement channels.52 Therefore the quote “Beyond that are twelve” refers to these twelve wind- movement channels. If this were not the case and the eight channels divided only into twelve, then the four empty channels would not exist and the sixty-four channel petals would be incomplete.Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the center of the navel cakra is the center of the heart cakra. It has eight channel petals, each of which is named. The eastern petal is named rohini, the southeastern petal is hasti- jihva, the southern is pingala, the southwestern petal is pusya, the western isjaya, the northwestern is alamhusa, the northern is mesa, and the north­eastern is kuha.Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the center of the heart cakra lies the center of the throat cakra. This cakra has thirty-two channel petals. Eight petals branch out from its center, each of which splits into, two to make sixteen channel petals. Each of these sixteen in turn divides into two to make thirty-two. Four of those are empty channels, in which coarse wind does not flow.Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the center of the throat cakra at the forehead is a cakra of sixteen petals. From its center eight petals branch out, each of which divides into two to make sixteen. Two of them are empty channels, in which coarse wind does not flow. [148] The cakra of the crown has four channel petals.In total, then, there are 156 channel petals within the six cakras. The descriptions here of six cakras are for the purpose of assigning channel petals to deities and so forth, but the cakras are not limited to six. In A Short Teaching on Initiations it says:To the lotuses of navel, secret, and jewel, body, speech, and mind descend.53"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"i8o Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsThis quote indicates that at the center of the jewel also there is a cakra. The Great Commentary, on the forty-fifth verse of the Inner chapter, says:“By there being numerous joints, these glorious cakras take many forms.” This means that because there are 360 joints in this body, there are 360 cakras, and a similar number of wind activ­ities, such as those of the life-sustaining wind, and so forth.54This states that at each of the locations of the 360 joints there is a cakra, and wherever there is a cakra there are the activities of the winds.In the Great Commentary it says:Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the navel wheel in the region of the heart is a cakra of eight spokes.And, further on:Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the lotus of the heart is the throat cakra.And:Twelve and a half fingerwidths above the lotus of the throat lies the lotus of the forehead with sixteen petals.55Concerning the above quotes, scholars such as the omniscient Buton say:The measurement of twelve and a half fingerwidths from the navel to the heart, from the heart to the center of the throat cakra, and from there to the center of the forehead cakra does not refer to the fingerwidths of an ordinary human but to the twelve and half fingerwidths that make up half the length of a buddha’s forearm.However the commentary Illu m in a tin g Reality is correct when comment­ing on this assertion:These words of commentary are from the section that speaks of the cakras acting as supports for the regular movement of wind"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Channels, W inds, Drops 181at the heart of an ordinary being during ordinary existence. Therefore I do not see the relevance of that particular way of dis­pelling the contradiction.56[149] The commentary goes on to explain:There are not twelve and a half of a particular being’s finger- widths between his or her actual navel and heart. However either the navel cakra is a little lower than the actual navel, or alternatively the heart cakra also is not to be found at the bot­tommost point of a heart of a size proportionate to the dimen­sions of beings such as gods and so forth, but is found halfway along the heart’s vertical axis. I think the contradiction has to be resolved in this way, and that this is what the commentary is saying.It seems that both the above passages have tried to resolve the contradic­tion on the basis of there not being twelve and a half fingerwidths of an ordinary being between the central point of the navel and the heart at a point midway between the two nipples. However the distance from the central point of the navel to throat is twenty-four fingerwidths. The height of the throat is six fingerwidths, as in the line “the throat of Meru is six fin­gerwidths on the body.” There are twelve fingerwidths between the upper edge of the throat and the upper edge of the forehead, as stated by the line “from the throat to the edge of the forehead is twelve fingerwidths on the body.” O f these, there are four fingerwidths from the upper edge of the throat to the nose, and from the tip of the nose to the point between the eyebrows there are also four fingerwidths. In total, therefore, the distance between the navel and the point between the eyebrows is thirty-eight fin­gerwidths. The Great Commentary states that from the navel to the heart, from the heart to the throat, and from the throat to the forehead are each twelve and a half fingerwidths, which gives a total of thirty-seven and a half fingerwidths. Therefore, although the distance between each of these points is given as twelve and a half fingerwidths, the distance from the navel to the lower edge of the forehead is thirty-eight fingerwidths. There­fore the previous measurement falls short of the forehead by half a finger­width. In this way, when the distance between the actual navel and the point between the eyebrows is divided into three sections of equal length,"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"i82 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsthere is no mistake in each part not coming out at twelve and a half fin- gerwidths. Therefore, although each part is given as twelve and a half fin- gerwidths, the half a fingerwidth distance of the forehead is to be divided into three, giving a distance of one barley seed and one thirtieth of a bar­ley seed, and this measurement has to be added to each distance of twelve and a half fingerwidths from the navel to the heart, and so forth. [150]This section of the Great Commentary explaining the location of the cakras is taught for the purpose of knowing where the centers of the cakras to be penetrated are located and, therefore, is to be taken literally. The measurements of twelve and a half fingerwidths given for the distances between the navel and the heart, etc., are to be understood as being on the basis of equal allotment and as an approximate calculation.WindsThere are ten winds. The life-sustaining wind is of the element of space. The coexisting wind is of the element of wind. The upwardly moving wind is of the element of fire. The pervading wind is of the element of water. The naga wind is of the element of earth. The turtle wind is of the element of air. The lizard wind is of the element of fire. The devadatta wind is of the element of water. The dhanamjaya wind is of the element of earth. The downwardly expelling wind is of the element of gnosis.The life-sustaining wind in terms of its pathways can be divided into three— the wind that moves through the left channel, the wind that moves through the right channel, and the wind that moves through the central channel. In terms of its function, the downwardly expelling wind can be divided into three— two that push excrement and urine through the two lower orifices and one that carries fluid through the sankhini, or supreme channel.Concerning the locations of the winds, eight winds beginning with the coexisting wind are to be found in the eight petals of the heart cakra. The coexisting wind is located in the eastern rohini channel petal. The upwardly moving wind is in the southeastern hastijihva channel petal. The pervad­ing wind is located in the southern pihgald petal. The naga wind is found in the southwestern pusya petal. The turtle wind is found within the west­ern jaya petal. The lizard wind is within the northwestern alambusa petal. The devadatta wind is within the northern mesa channel petal. The dhanamjaya wind is within the northeastern kuha petal. These channels"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 183are the primary birthplaces of these winds, although these winds also per­vade and inhabit all the 72,000 channels. [151] With this in mind the Great Commentary says on the forty-second verse of the Inner chapter:The life-sustaining wind and others pervade the 72,000 chan­nels. However the eight winds are created within the eight places.57The guardians of the winds are as follows. The life-sustaining wind is the wind of Aksobhya. The downwardly expelling is the wind of Vajrasattva. The coexisting is the wind of Amoghasiddhi. The upwardly moving is the wind of Ratnasambhava. The pervading is the wind of Amitabha. The ndga is the wind of Vairocana. The turtle wind is the wind of Amoghasiddhi. The lizard wind is the wind of Ratnasambhava. The devadatta is the wind of Amitabha. The dhanamjaya is the wind of Vairocana.DropsAs previously explained, the end of the thirteenth month after conception marks the first growth in the red and white drops. These drops continue to grow in the case of a boy until the age of sixteen and in a girl until the age of twelve. When a girl reaches the age of twelve, menstrual blood emerges from the secret place, and the growth of menstrual blood, or the red drop, is complete. When a boy reaches the age of sixteen, fluid emerges from the organ, and the growth in the drop, or fluid, is complete.In general, red and white drops are to be found in every part of the body, like sesame oil in a sesame seed. The white is primarily situated in the cakra of great bliss in the crown of the head, while the red is primarily to be found in the cakras of the secret place and the navel. In its form of fluid, or white bodhicitta, the white drop dwells in and emerges from the left channel. In its form of menstrual blood, or red bodhicitta, the red drop dwells in and emerges from the right channel. The sankhini, or supreme channel, one of the three channels below the navel, carries both red and white drops.At the center of the forehead cakra is found the drop that creates the waking state. In the center of the throat cakra is the drop that creates dream states. In the center of the heart cakra is the drop that creates the state of deep sleep. [152] In the center of the navel cakra is the drop that creates the fourth state.58"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"184 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsSimilarly locations of drops that create the four states are also found from the navel downward. The one drop at the navel has the potential to create the fourth state as well as the waking state, and so it is said that both states share a common basis on that one drop. Therefore at the navel is found the drop that creates the waking state. At the secret place is the drop that creates dream states. In the center of the jewel lies the drop that cre­ates deep sleep. At the tip of the jewel lies the drop that creates the fourth state.In the drops at the forehead and at the navel, which create the waking state, resides the potential to create the endless conceptions of the waking state in ordinary beings as well as the potential to create limitless emanated bodies at the time of becoming a buddha. Similarly, in the drops contained at the throat and secret place can be found the potential to create dreams in ordinary beings and sambhogakâya speech59 in all its aspects in the enlightened state. In the drops at the heart and in the center of the jewel that create the state of deep sleep is found the potential to create the uncon­sciousness of sleep in ordinary beings as well as the nonconceptual dhar- makâya freed of all fabrication at the time of enlightenment. In the drops at the navel and at the tip of the jewel responsible for creating the fourth state can be found the potential to create contaminated pleasure in ordinary beings as well as the body of bliss that is the supreme and unchanging bliss of a buddha.Therefore, on the paths of the generation and completion stage six- branched yoga, the potential of these eight drops to create the faults that arise in ordinary beings is purified, and the potential to create the qualities of the four bodies is developed in terms of ever-increasing quality until the ultimate result is actualized.[153] To summarize: the red and white drops explained above are indis­pensable causes for the creation of a womb-born body. From beginningless time the imprints of the emission of the red and white elements have been planted again and again, and it is by these imprints of emission alone that the wandering in samsara continues. By meditative familiarization with the vajra yoga of penetrative focusing on the channels and winds of the vajra body, the red and white elements do not fall, and their movement is restrained. This alone will bring about the actualization of the indivisible union of the form body of empty form and the dharmakiya of supreme and unchanging bliss60 inseparable from emptiness. This is how the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries explain the tantra. Therefore those who wish for"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 185the supreme siddhi by following this particular path of practice should value the bodhicitta elements. In the first summary from the Realms chap­ter of the Great Commentary it says:Those whose white fluid fallsduring their companionship with wisdom,61by what will their bliss increase?62And:Occasionally, at the appropriate time of year, the deer-eating lion seeks the bliss of mating, while the gravel-eating pigeon does so constantly.Because their fluid falls once or many times, neither finds supreme bliss.Similarly the ascetic and the lustful lose their fluid in dreams and while awake.Bitten by a snake while asleep, one will not live;Similarly the ascetic weakened by not keeping his fluid is ruined by a woman’s womb.63How the winds move within the channelsThis is dealt with under two headings1. The flow of wind through the petals of the four cakras2. Movement of wind through the nostrilsThe flow of wind through the petals of the four cakrasThe Great Commentary says on the sixty-second verse of the Inner chapter:For those born from a womb, the month of conception is Capri­corn. From there the seventh, the month of Cancer, is the month of the creation of the life-sustaining wind.64If this quote meant that every womb birth was conceived only in the actual month of Capricorn,65 the consequences would be absurd. [154] It means that whatever the month of conception, it is to be known as the month of"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"i86 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient BeingsCapricorn, and that the seventh month on from conception is known as the month of Cancer. In this way the passage means that seven months on from the month of conception, labeled Capricorn, in the month labeled Cancer, the first life-sustaining wind is formed.From that time onward, and for as long as the being remains in the womb, the wind stays within the central channel as rigid as a stick, with­out moving through exhalation and inhalation. However, immediately after birth, fifty-six and a quarter winds flow from the central channel. From then on wind moves through either the left or right zodiac channels.It is incorrect to understand the above line “For those born from a womb, the month of conception is Capricorn” as referring to the time of the flow of wind within the mothers Capricorn channel, and that con­ception for womb-born beings will always occur at that time. If that were the case, it would have to mean that the time when wind flows through the mother’s Cancer channel, which is the seventh channel on from the chan­nel of Capricorn, would be the time of the formation of the life-sustaining wind of the being in the womb. It would then follow that this wind would be created on the very day that the being entered the womb, and this can­not be so, because on the day of entering the womb not even the beginnings of the channels that carry the winds are present. Therefore “month of Capricorn” and “month of Cancer” must refer to external months.Some have said that as well as referring to an external month, the quote beginning “For those born from womb, the month of conception is Capri­corn” is made on the basis of those womb-born human beings conceived in the actual month of Capricorn and does not refer to every womb-born human. However the Great Commentary says on the thirty-eighth verse of the Inner chapter:“Lord of men, from the lagna66 of Cancer” refers to the fact that in the external world, the birthplace of the sun was the house of Cancer. Similarly, in whatever lagna every birth takes place, that house is known by the name of Cancer and is the birthplace of the life-sustaining wind.67“Every birth” includes every womb-born human, and so the previous expla­nation is correct. [155]Having established this, as soon as a being emerges from the womb, fifty-six and a quarter breaths of wind move through the central channel"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 187and flow equally through both nostrils. Each unit of breath is one exhala­tion and one inhalation. Immediately afterward, the space mandala wind flows through the Aries channel, or Aries lagna channel, on the left. This process continues until finally the earth mandala wind flows through the Pisces lagna channel on the right, at which time 21,600 winds will have flowed and one day will have passed.The house, or lagna, channels are explained as follows. The intermedi­ate circle of the navel cakra has twelve channel petals. Those at the front of the body are in the east. Those on the left are in the north, those on the right in the south, and those at the back in the west. In the same way that other phenomena of the four directions are enumerated by beginning with the east, here too they are counted from east at the front of the body. There­fore the first channel petal at the front left of the body is the house of Aries. Moving counterclockwise around the body, the second is Gemini, third Leo, fourth Libra, fifth Sagittarius, and the house of Aquarius is the sixth channel petal of the left. Likewise the first channel petal at the front of the body on its right is the house of Taurus. The second is Cancer, the third Virgo, the fourth Scorpio, the fifth Capricorn, and the sixth channel petal at the back on the right is the house of Pisces.Having established these channels, the movement of wind through them can be explained. Immediately after birth, fifty-six and a quarter winds68 flow from the central channel. After that, 1,800 breaths of the space-man- dala wind, less fifty-six and a quarter, each breath consisting of one unit of inhalation and exhalation, flow through the Aries channel petal, the first petal of the left. Then fifty-six and a quarter of gnosis-mandala winds flow from the central channel at the point of the changeover of wind movement from the Aries channel petal, the first petal of the left, to the Taurus chan­nel petal, the first petal of the right. After that, 1,800 breaths minus fifty- six and a quarter flow from the house of the Taurus petal, the first petal of the right. Similarly, at the times of the other house channel petals’ changeover of wind movement, fifty-six and a quarter gnosis winds will flow from the central channel. [156]After earth wind has flowed from the Taurus petal, the first channel petal of the right, the air-mandala wind flows from the second petal of the left. After that the water-mandala wind flows from the second petal of the right, followed by the fire-mandala wind from the third on the left. The fire wind also flows from the third on the right, the water-mandala wind from the fourth on the left, the air-mandala wind from the fourth on the right,"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"i88 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsthe earth-mandala wind from the fifth on the left, the space-mandala wind from the fifth on the right, the space wind also from the sixth on the left, and, finally, 1,800 breaths less fifty-six and a quarter of the earth-mandala wind flow from the house of Pisces, the sixth petal on the right.In this way, in each of the channel petals of the twelve houses where these twelve major wind movements69 occur, 1,800 winds of the five man­dalas of space and so forth, less fifty-six and a quarter winds, to make 1,743 3/4 breaths, flow within each period. Also, at the changeover point of each of the twelve wind movements, fifty-six and a quarter winds flow from the central channel, making a total of 675 winds flowing from the central chan­nel each day. 1,743 3/4 breaths in each of the twelve major movements totals 20,925. To this is added the 675 winds, making a total of 21,600 breaths. This is the way the wind moves in one solar day of twelve wind movements at the navel cakra.At the beginning of the second solar day, air-mandala wind flows in the first channel petal on the left, which is the Aries wind-movement channel. Then in the first petal on the right, water-mandala wind flows in the Tau­rus channel. Similarly, from the second on the left to the sixth on the left, fire-mandala wind, water-mandala wind, earth-mandala wind, space-man- dala wind, and air-mandala wind flow, respectively. Similarly, from the second on the right to the sixth on the right, fire-mandala wind, air-man­dala wind, space-mandala wind, earth-mandala wind, and water-mandala wind flow, respectively. This is how the wind moves on the second day.At the beginning of the third day, fire-mandala wind flows in the first channel petal on the left. Similarly, from the second petal to the sixth, water-mandala wind, earth-mandala wind, space-mandala wind, air-man­dala wind, and fire-mandala wind flow, respectively. [157] After fire-man­dala wind flows in the first petal of the left, fire-mandala wind flows in the first channel petal of the right, air-mandala wind in the second, space-man­dala wind in the third, earth-mandala wind in the fourth, water-mandala wind in the fifth, and fire-mandala wind in the sixth petal. This is how the winds move on the third day.At the beginning of the fourth day, water-mandala wind flows in the first channel petal on the left. After that air-mandala wind flows in the first petal on the right. In the same way earth-mandala wind flows in the sec­ond petal on the left, space-mandala wind in the third, air-mandala wind in the fourth, fire-mandala wind in the fifth, and water-mandala wind in the sixth. Similarly, on the right, space-mandala wind flows through the"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 189second, earth-mandala air through the third, water-mandala wind through the fourth, fire-mandala wind through the fifth, and air-mandala wind through the sixth. This is how the winds flow on the fourth day.At the beginning of the fifth day, earth-mandala wind flows through the first channel petal on the left. After that space-mandala wind moves through the first petal on the right. Similarly space-mandala wind moves through the second petal on the left, air-mandala wind through the third, fire-mandala wind through the fourth, water-mandala wind through the fifth, and earth-mandala wind through the sixth. Likewise earth-mandala wind moves through the second petal on the right, water-mandala wind through the third, fire-mandala wind through the fourth, air-mandala wind through the fifth, and space-mandala wind through the sixth on the right. This is the movement of the winds on the fifth day.At the beginning of the sixth day, space-wind moves through the first channel petal on the left, and earth wind moves through the first channel petal of the right, as on the first day. The process is repeated every five days, with the winds flowing and circulating as before. The process has to be this way. The Great Commentary says on the sixty-fifth verse of the Inner chapter:In the six uneven petals of Aries and so forth, the emptiness70 mandala flows, expelled by wind. In the right there are six days of flow, and with six days of changeover, the earth mandala flows in the even houses of Taurus and so forth expelled by the life wind.71This says that the winds of the five mandalas of space and so forth flow within each of the twelve channel petals, and the way that each of the five mandalas flows through the petals has to be as explained above. [158] Fur­thermore, when the space-mandala wind has flowed through the first chan­nel petal on the left, it will again flow through the sixth channel petal on the left. After that, when winds flow again through the left channels, they begin from the first petal on the left, and that wind will be the air-mandala wind, which comes after the space-mandala wind. In this way, the left and right major changeovers in the flow of the winds must occur, as previously explained, alternately left and right.When wind flows through each of the house channels, the channel tubes are divided into five sections— four in the four directions and one in the"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"190 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsaenter. The minor-element space mandala flows through the center, the air mandala through the east, the fire mandala through the south, the water mandala through the north, and the earth mandala through the west. For each of these there are 360 breaths less eleven and a quarter.72There are twenty-five mandalas of the minor elements. They are the space mandala of space, the air mandala of space, the fire mandala of space, the water mandala of space, and the earth mandala of space; the space, air, fire, water, and earth mandalas of air; the five mandalas from the space mandala of fire to the earth mandala of fire; the five from the space man­dala of water to the earth mandala of water; and the five from the space mandala of earth to the earth mandala of earth. This makes twenty-five.The flow of the five mandalas of the minor elements is as follows. W hat­ever wind of the major elements is flowing in the one of the major wind movements of the twelve channel petals, the five minor elements also flow in that wind. Such a flow, moreover, is strictly ordeted. To illustrate this, when the mandala of the major element of space flows through the first channel petal of the left, the minor mandalas from the space mandala of space to the earth mandala of space also flow. When the mandala of the major element of earth flows through the first channel petal on the right, the mandalas from the earth mandala of earth to the space mandala of earth also flow.The order in which they flow is as follows. When flowing through the left channel petals, the minor elements also flow in the order of space, air, fire, water, and earth. Similarly, when wind flows through the right chan­nel petals, they flow in the order earth, water, fire, air, and space. [159] In this way, when the major wind movements change from the left to the right, the minor elements move from earth to earth,73 and when moving from right to left, from space to space. This movement is fixed.Each of the twelve channel petals of the major wind movements splits up into five petals of these five minor wind movements. The channel tubes of the major wind movements are divided east, west, south, north, and center, and the space, air, fire, water, and earth minor elements flow along these five directions. The five channel petals of the minor elements are also arranged east, west, south, north, and center, and the flow of winds within them mirrors the directional flow of the major wind elements. In each petal of minor wind movement, the flow is 360 breaths minus eleven and a quar­ter, or 348 3/4.This is how winds flow within the petals of the navel. The flow in the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, and Drops 191channel petals of the heart is mentioned in the Great Commentary on the forty-first verse of the Inner chapter:It should be known that within the eight petals of the lotus of the heart are channels of periodic wind movement. The five mandalas flow to the nostrils from these channels. The winds flow because of the channels, and the inhalations and exhala­tions of each channel number 2,700, or seven and a half hours.74This quote says that in each of the eight petals of the heart, 21,600 divided by eight, or 2,700, breaths flow. This in hours comes to seven and a half.75 This quote is made on the basis of not excluding the 675 breaths that flow in one day through the central channel. The actual measurement is explained as follows. At the changeover times of the twelve major wind movements of the navel channel, fifty-six and a quarter breaths flow from the central channel. These breaths flow in the central channel from the navel cakra to the upper opening of the central channel. Therefore they do not flow into the channel petals of the heart, the throat, and the forehead. 21,600 breaths less 675 leaves 20,925 breaths. This divided by eight comes to 2,615 5/8, and this is the actual number of breaths that flow within each petal of the heart cakra each day.This is not the amount of wind that flows during each period of flow. [160] On the basis of the flow within each period, whatever quantity of wind flows during the period of each major wind movement at the navel, that much has to flow at each period within the petals of the heart, throat, and forehead. This is because, in one major wind movement on the left at the navel, 1,800 breaths minus fifty-six and a quarter will flow. That amount of wind will also flow through the left nostril. Moving to the right, 1,800 breaths minus fifty-six and a quarter will flow from one channel petal on the right. At the same time, the flow moves from the left nostril to the right, and a similar number of breaths will flow. Likewise, during each period of flow, the number of breaths at the left and right channel petals of the heart, throat, and forehead must be the same as the flow at the nos­trils and at each of the wind movements at the navel-channel petals.This process can be explained using the first flow of wind through the first navel-channel petal on the left while wind flows simultaneously through the first heart-channel petal on the left. Firstly, one set of 1,800 breaths flows through the first heart-channel petal on the left. Then one set"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"192 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingsof 1,800 breaths flow through the first channel petal on the right. After that 900 breaths flow again through the first petal on the left. Then 900 breaths flow through the second petal on the left. After that 900 breaths flow through the first petal on the right, and then 900 breaths flow through the second petal on the right. Then 1,800 breaths flow through the second petal on the left, and after that 1,800 breaths flow through the second petal on the right. This process continues in similar fashion through the other petals. This has been calculated without separating out the flow of wind from the central channel, and so the number of breaths flowing through each petal of the heart should be known in this way as being 2,700.The throat cakra has thirty-two petals, of which four are empty channels through which no wind flows. The way in which wind flows through the other twenty-eight is spoken of in the Great Commentary:In the twenty-eight petals flows the wind day and night. Through a division of sixty hours, the wind flows in each petal.76This means that sixty hours or 21,600 breaths is divided among the twenty- eight wind-carrying petals. [161] This comes to 770 3/7 breaths. This is the number of breaths or winds that flow within each petal of the throat cakra each day. Similarly, the Great Commentary says:O f the sixteen petals of the forehead lotus two are ignored, and in the remaining fourteen flows the wind day and night. For a fourteenth of sixty hours, it flows through each channel.77This means that for sixty hours, or 21,600 breaths, apart from the two empty petals, wind flows through the sixteen-petal forehead cakra. This number of breaths divided by fourteen gives a figure of 1,542 6/7 breaths, and this is the number of breaths that flow through each channel petal of the forehead each day.These are all calculated on the basis of not separating out the flow of wind from the central channel..If they were, then the 675 breaths that flow through the central channel each day are to be subtracted from the 21,600 breaths to leave 20,925, and how this is to be divided up can be known from the above."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Channels, Winds, ¿z«¿/ Drops 193Upon birth from the mother’s womb, fifty-six and a quarter winds flow from the central channel through both nostrils equally. Then the same number of winds that are flowing in the major wind movement at the navel on the left will flow only through the left nostril. At the changeover period from left to right, the number of breaths flowing through the central chan­nel will be the number of breaths that flow through both nostrils equally. Similarly the number of winds that flow in each major wind movement of the channel petals on the right is the number of breaths that move solely through the right nostril.The wind of each major wind movement is divided into the wind of the five minor elements. The space-element wind flows through the cen­ter of the nostrils. The air-element wind flows through the upper part of the nostril. The fire-element wind flows through the sides of the nostrils that border the cheeks. The water-element wind flows through the center of the nostrils close to the bone. [162] The earth-element wind flows through the nostrils close to the base and toward the upper lip.How far the breath travels outside the nostrils and inside is explained as follows. The earth-mandala wind travels twelve fingerwidths outside the nostrils. The water-mandala wind travels thirteen fingerwidths outside the nostril. The fire-mandala wind travels fourteen fingerwidths, the air-man­dala wind travels fifteen, and the space-mandala wind travels sixteen fin­gerwidths. Each breath then returns, and the farther it travels outside, the shorter it travels inside, and the shorter it travels outside, the farther it trav­els inside. Therefore the space-mandala wind reaches the center of the navel. The air-mandala wind reaches one fingerwidth below the navel. The fire-mandala wind reaches two fingerwidths below the navel, the water- mandala wind three fingerwidths below, and the earth-mandala wind four fingerwidths below.The wind in its five parts must travel at least as far as the navel, because at the times of a wind-movement changeover, wind enters the central chan­nel, and it has to enter from the center of the navel cakra. Moreover the gnosis wind that enters the central channel after the flow of the five winds will travel the same distance inward or outward as the particular wind that precedes the gnosis wind.

This is just a brief explanation of the inconsistencies in the presentation of the channels.The inconsistencies in the presentations of the winds are as follows. The presentations of the ten winds are similar. However, concerning the loca­tions and the guardians of the five root winds, the Vajra G arland Explana­tory Tantra says:The life-sustaining wind abides in the heart, born from the family of Aksobhya.The downwardly expelling, dwelling in the secret area, is born from Ratnasambhava.The upwardly moving dwells in the throat, in the nature of Amitabha.The coexisting is in the lotus of the navel, in the nature of Amoghasiddhi.The pervading dwells in every limb, in the nature of Vairocana.80[164] Therefore the life-sustaining wind abides in the heart and is the wind of Aksobhya. The downwardly expelling wind is found in the secret place and is the wind of Ratnasambhava. The upwardly moving wind dwells in the cakra of the throat and is the wind of Amitabha. The coexisting wind dwells within the navel cakra and is the wind of Amoghasiddhi. The per­vading wind is found in all joints, such as those of the limbs, and is the wind of Vairocana.Furthermore the life-sustaining wind dwelling at the heart is also explained as being of two kinds— coarse and subde. The coarse wind brings about inhalation and exhalation at the nostrils, and although this coarse wind is in the heart cakra, it does not enter the dhuti of the heart channel knot. The subde life-sustaining wind is inseparable from the very subtle mind of clear light and is known as its indestructible mount. It dwells within the dhuti of the channel knot at the very center of the heart cakra.

The Vajra M andala O rnam ent Tantra says:In the center of the heart, the indestructible, clear and like a lamp, unchanging and extremely subtle, the syllable “a” supreme.84This, too, teaches the very subtle indestructible wind. Illu m in a tin g Reality talks of “emptiness perceived when the innate wind returns to its place after the other winds have dissolved.” This innate wind is the very subde life-sustaining wind. This very subtle wind and its very subtle mind of clear light form the foundation of all phenomena of samsara and are the special meditative foundations of the two forms of a buddha, with this wind being the special meditative foundation of the enjoyment body of a buddha. The above is the thinking behind hidden tantras as explained by their intended disciples. [165]The Great Commentary says that the mind of clear light is the founda­tion of all phenomena of samsara and nirvana but does not even mention the very subtle wind. Furthermore the main seat of the winds is said to be the heart-channel petals, which is at variance with the locations of the four winds, from coexisting wind to pervading wind, as taught in the other tantras.

The way they flow is as follows. Only the coexisting wind flows freely through the left nostril, its color is a mixture of green and yellow, and it is of the ele­ment of air. The upwardly moving wind flows freely only through the right nostril, is red in color, and is of the element of fire. The downwardly expelling wind moves freely through both nostrils, flowing forcefully through both. It is yellow and of the earth element. The life-sustaining wind flows gently and freely through both nostrils. It is white and of the water element. The pervading wind does not flow freely through the nos­trils during normal existence except at the time of death. It is pale blue in color and of the element of space.The Great Commentary speaks of the life-sustaining wind being of the ele­ment of space and green in color. The downwardly expelling wind is of the element of gnosis and blue in color. The coexisting wind is taught as being of the element of air and black in color. The pervading wind is of the water element and white. There are, therefore, discrepancies in the colors of four winds and in the elements of three of the above winds. Similarly the Great Commentary speaks of the winds divided into the five elements flowing in sequence and of their own accord through left, right, and both nostrils. There is, therefore, disagreement in the way wind flows through the nostrils.Hidden tantras and their commentaries, including the Sandhivyakarana Tantra.,86 speak only of four winds— fire, water, earth, and air— flowing of their own accord through the nostrils during normal existence, and that each flow is 900 breaths. In this way, with flows following each other, each of the four winds flows 900 times multiplied by six in a single day. More­over each set of 900 breaths is divided into four sets of 225 winds— one for each of the four goddesses.

This is in conflict with the Great Commentary, which talks of the flow of the space-element wind. The hidden tantras talk of 900 breaths flowing during each period of the four winds, each of which moves to other element mandalas six times, making in total twenty-four wind movements. The Great Commentary talks of 1,743 3/4 breaths flowing during each period of the winds of the five elements, each period changing from element to element twelve times to form the twelve major wind movements. These, therefore, are discrepancies in the number of breaths within each flow and in the number of wind move­ments. The hidden tantras say that except for the moment of death and while on the path, the winds do not flow in the central channel. The Great Commentary says that even during normal existence wind flows in the cen­tral channel. These are the discrepancies.An explanation of the thinking behind presentations as given here and in other tantrasThis has two outlines:1. Abhayakaragupta’s explanation2. A presentation of statements by other scholars and their meanings200 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beings"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Discrepancies between Kälacakra and Other Tantras 201Abhayakaragupta s explanation[168] Explanations from the hidden tantras are definitive, while those from the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries that comment on Kalacakra and oth­ers are interpretive and not to be taken literally. In the twenty-first chap­ter of the Sheaves o f O ral Transmission, he explains that the space-mandala wind flows only as a secondary accompaniment to the other four winds, thereby rejecting that it flows of its own accord separately from the four other winds. This he does by quoting from A Lantern o f Condensed Prac­tice and backing that up with scriptural reference from the Vajra Garland Tantra, Sandhivyakarana Tantra, and the Trium ph o f N onduality Tantra. The teachings in the Kalacakra are interpretive, as they are based upon the views of Suryaratha and other disciples. How are they to be interpreted? The twenty-first chapter of Sheaves o f Oral Transmission says:The fifth element of space is pervasive, and so only flows at the times of the four mandalas flowing at the four places. It was therefore not taught as being separate. This was spoken of by the venerable Aryadeva: “From the openings of the vajra and lotus, rays of light rise and travel upward to flow from the tip of the nose. Within them the four mandalas of the elements of earth, water, fire, and air are exhaled. The pervading wind does not emerge, it is together with the pervading rays of light”89This quote of Aryadeva continues until “One element mandala pervades four elements.”90 Abhayakaragupta validates this position by quoting from the Sandhivyakarana Tantra:In the Sandhivyakarana it says:“The recitations of Pandara.and so forth,225 multiplied by four,are the four yogas— 900 in each.”Also:“That taught as 900, by twenty-four similar kinds, totals 2i,6oo.”91This speaks of the number of breaths in the wind movements."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Concerning the validating quote from the Vajra G arland, the text con­tinues:By including them in space, the Vajra Garland speaks only of the flow of four mandalas.“For the ‘mustard seed at the tip of the nose,’92 focus on pranayama, dwell within pranayama, meditate as buddhas, the five rays of light arising through the nose.”The Vajra Garland quote is continued until ‘ doms.”93 [169]Concerning the validating quote from the text says:Similarly, in the Trium ph o f N onduality “That which the letter y a symbolizes is practiced by those who desire siddhis.With the three letters ra and so forth, engage in the welfare of others.“In mandalas of fire, air, earth, and water, two activities in half a session at a time.”94These quotes establish that within the flows of wind of the four element mandalas, the space-mandala wind does not flow independently or pre­dominantly during normal existence. It can be inferred from the above that Abhayakaragupta would also not accept as literal the presentations of the channels and winds as found in the Condensed Tantra and the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries where they disagreed with the root and explana­tory hidden tantras. Presentations, therefore, found in the Bodhisattva Com­mentaries on the KdlacakratantraznA so forth are explained as being subject to interpretation.

It is wholly in need of interpretation and intentionally equivocal, like the teaching on the arrangement of the three world realms in the upper regions of Meru asserted by those who follow Varaha.95 However the wise and others have said that in the Kalacakra and the com­mentaries that follow it, there are many presentations that con­tradict the three vehicles, and that those responsible for these texts, possessing the names of Yas'as, Pundarlka, Vajragarbha, and Vajrapani, are not bodhisattvas at all. Therefore, as all con­tradictions have not been resolved, you may ask what is the point in trying to resolve part of the contradictions? Those parts of the Kalacakra that do not contradict other tantras of the doc­trine, I follow as I would my own. Some contradictions I have resolved because they are adapted to the minds of certain disci­ples. [170] As to the rest, although the contradictions are not resolved, it has been explained at great length that there are no faults in these at all and so therefore they are acceptable.96“The wise” mentioned in the above quote refers to Acârya Sântipa, and “others” refers to other Indians. The questio, “Therefore, as all contradic­tions have not been resolved, you may ask what is the point in trying to resolve part of the contradictions” expresses the following doubt. The Kalacakra and those texts known as the Bodhisattva Commentaries have been refuted by Sântipa and other scholars. Therefore all contradictions have not been resolved, and so what is the point in you, Abhayâkaragupta, persevering in resolving contradictions in parts of the text? This doubt is cleared up by the lines that follow, beginning with “Those parts of the Kalacakra.”A presentation of statements by other scholars and their meaningsScholars (such as Kumâramati97) say that it is not right to posit as inter­pretive those presentations from the Kalacakra on the formation of the world realms and on channels and winds and so forth that conflict with the Abhidharma tradition and the hidden tantras.

In the Inner chapter also, many presentations on channels, winds, etc., would not be literal. Therefore, in the remaining chapters, it also becomes very difficult to setde almost anything as being lit­erally true. They go on to say that although the explanations from the Kalacakra and from the hidden tantras disagree, they should both be accepted as being definitive and should be explained as such. How is that to be explained? Lantern Illu m in a tin g the Five Stages says:However, according to the explanatory tantra of the Guhya­samaja, in half the breaths of a day there are twelve wind move­ments at the nostrils. According to the Samvaraudbhava there are eight, [171] and according to the Kalacakra, except for 675 breaths, there are twelve wind movements at the nostrils in a whole day. Are these statements contradictory? Although the tradition of Guhyasamaja has been explained by the O ral Tra­dition o f M a hjusri and by Nagarjuna and his disciples, it has been done so in its own context. The Sam varaudbhava, too, exists for the purpose of its own tantra. Therefore it is inappro­priate to explain the meanings of those statements together. Concerning the flow of breath through the nostrils, it seems dif­ficult to say that one tradition can be verified and that another cannot. They are taught, therefore, according to the needs of disciples and should not be held as being contradictory.98This is how it should be understood. Moreover the validity as expressed in the explanatory tantras of the Guhyasamaja, such as the Vajra G arlandznA Sandhivyakarana is as explained in the Lantern Illu m in a tin g the Five Stages. A s for the Kalacakra, put aside all assertions that the Kdlacakratantra and the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries are not valid. From the perspective that they are indeed valid texts, Abhayakaragupta is not correct when he presents the winds, etc., as taught in the Kalacakra as interpretive and not to be taken literally. The second summary from the Realms chapter states:The Vajra Vehicle, in accord with the mentality of sentient beings, lies hidden as vajra words in the K ing o f Tantras.”Thus in the root hidden tantras, the meanings are taught in an unclear or hidden style. Further on it says:"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Discrepancies between Kälacakra and Other Tantras 205In this the Kalacakra O riginal Buddha.,100 the Conqueror has clarified the vajra words by very clearly teaching, explaining, and well explaining.101 As proof of that, the process of the signs of smoke, etc., in the mahamudra meditation is very clear.102These and further quotes establish that the profound meanings, which are obscured in other hidden tantras, are taught clearly in the Original Buddha and are to be understood literally. Therefore the teachings on the winds and so forth must also be accepted literally. But how can both of these con­flicting presentations be taken literally? In the two types of tantras the pre­sentations on normal-existence channels, winds, and so forth and the practices on the paths of generation and completion are taught differently, [172] and this is because they were taught on the basis of the primary intended disciples of each tantra.There are, therefore, two distinct presentations. Firsdy, the four-conti­nent world realm with its measurements, colors, and so forth, explained dif­ferently from the Abhidharma tradition and other tantras, arises as the dominant result103 of the common karma of the primary intended disciples of the S ri Kdlacakratantra. How it arises is taught in the Great Commentary and was explained earlier. Similarly the dimensions of the body and the individual colors of its constituents correlating with the outside world, plus the channels and winds within the body and the way the winds move through the individual cakras and through the nostrils, all arise as the results of the ripening karma of those same disciples. These phenomena exist, therefore, as actual situations. This external world and the inner world of sentient beings with body, speech, and mind are the bases of purification practice. The presentations of the path correlating with those phenomena, and the winds, channels, and drops of these primary disciples existing as they are taught in the tantra and its commentaries, form a basis upon which the penetrating activities of the completion stage are practiced. From such practices, the winds of the left and right channels enter the central chan­nel, thereby inducing the empty forms and unchanging bliss. As these processes are taught in the S ri Kdlacakratantra, so they actually exist. The fifty-ninth verse of the Inner chapter says:Therefore the 156 are channels that dwell in the nature of the Kalacakra gods and goddesses and that bring death to ordinary beings. Together with the channels of the six families, the 162"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"2o6 Part 2: The Inner World o f Sentient Beingschannels, in the nature of the six Kalacakra wheels, bring bliss to the yogi when meditated upon.104This passage teaches that the 156 channels comprise the thirty-two channel petals of the secret place, sixty-four of the navel, eight of the heart, thirty- two of the throat, sixteen of the forehead, and four of the crown. These are visualized as 156 lotus-seated gods and goddesses and meditated upon. [173] Likewise the three upper channels of the left, right, and middle plus the three lower channels of fluid, excrement, and urine are visualized and med­itated upon as the six families. This generation-stage practice ripens the continuum and the meditations of the six-branched yoga of the completion stage, which penetrates the channels, winds, and drops and brings the yogi to ultimate happiness.The Great Commentary says on the fifty-eighth verse of the Inner chapter:The six channels are the tim e channels. When meditated upon in accord with the guru’s instruction, the fear of death will be destroyed. To the yogi this is nothing special.105The “instruction” refers to the six-branched yoga. Regarding the sixtieth verse the Great Commentary says:Above, the moon, sun, and Râhu dwell in the paths of the left, right, and center. Below, divided into moon, sun, and Agni, they dwell in the paths of excrement, urine, and fluid. These the yogi protects in the body. How? “By the precepts of the guru.” The precepts of the guru are the six-branched yoga, which will bring protection from death. “They bring death to living creatures” because these six are entered by the winds. If the winds enter the six, at that time and at all times men will definitely be destroyed by death. Among the six is “the subtle” or the central avadhütï. If the winds do not enter “the subtle,”“how will the yogis destroy the realm of death?” Definitely they will not destroy the realm of death.106Therefore, if the yogi does not induce the winds into the central chan­nel byway of the six-branched yoga, the ultimate result of deathlessness is unobtainable."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Secondly, the presentation of the channels and winds of normal exis­tence, plus the stages along the paths of generation and completion, as found in the root and explanatory hidden tantras, exist on the basis of their intended disciples and therefore are to be taken literally. This is done as fol­lows. [174] For the primary disciples that the root and explanatory hidden tantras are intended for, the dominant result of their common karma is this four-continent world with its measurements and shape as taught in the Abhidharma tradition and in the root and explanatory hidden tantras, together with commentaries on their meanings unraveled by the great mas­ters. That this world exists as a reality is clearly the thinking of the tantras and sutras. That it is also the thinking of the Kalacakra is taught by the words of the commentary that begin “In a cave of five cubits,” which was explained earlier. Likewise, as taught in the hidden tantras and commen­taries, the aggregates, realms, and sensory sources, and particularly the channels and winds, together with the way the winds move through the channel petals and the nostrils, all exist in reality as the ripening results of the common karma of the primary disciples intended for the root and explanatory hidden tantras. Celestial palaces are meditated upon as corre­lating with the external world as it exists; the aggregates, realms, and sen­sory sources are meditated upon as being of the nature of gods and goddesses; and in particular, the channels, winds, and drops are meditated upon as being of the nature of male and female heroes. These generation- stage meditations ripen the continuum of the mind. The channels, winds, and drops, existing exactly as they are taught, are penetrated by the medi­tations of the completion stage, whose ultimate development results in the two bodies of a buddha. Conversely, if one correlates with and focuses upon an external world and an inner world of channels and so forth that do not actually exist, it will be difficult to attain any kind of result.Therefore, because of the separate and different types of karma of the two kinds of intended disciples, differences arose in the external worlds and the internal worlds of channels, winds, and so forth. Because of these differences, two ways of traveling the path arose— the method of the mas­ters of India who explained the meanings of the hidden tantras, and the method of the followers of the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries.This has been a brief explanation of the presentation of the inner world.Discrepancies between Kalacakra and Other Tantras 207"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"P a r t 3 Initiations"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"alifications of Master and DiscipleInitiations[175] This has three outlines:1.

His qualities will be briefly explained. To request an initiation, one must first rely upon a guru. [176] What kind of guru should one rely on? One who keeps both interpretive and definitive samaya3 and one who dwells within the path of the Vajra Vehicle, the highest secret mantra. This means to possess the mantra vows from the initiation of Kalacakra. “Meditates upon the reality” means one who meditates upon the Kalacakra completion stage preceded by the gen­eration stage. “Unattached” means to have no attachment for wife, chil­dren, and so forth, and no regard for his own body. “Untainted” means to be untainted by desire, anger, ignorance, pride, jealousy, and miserliness. “O f a patient nature” means to have no regard for the fruits of fame and wealth but to be occupied instead by the welfare of the disciples. “Has entered the path” means that he has entered the general Mahayana path. “Shows the path to the disciples, and takes away the fear of hell” means that by showing the perfect path to those disciples who rely upon him as a guru, it becomes possible to remove the fears of hell. “From reality he is of the brahmacarya”4 means that from meditating upon emptiness he has attained the unmoving brahmacarya, the supreme unchanging bliss. “For mara he is the vajra club” means that in destroying the four types of maras he is like the vajra club. The four kinds of maras are the aggregates, the delusions, death, and the devaputra.5 One who possesses these qualities is famed as a heroic vajra mind upon the earth. These are the characteristics of a vajra master to be relied upon.Furthermore the Great Commentary, commenting on the second verse of the Initiations chapter of the Condensed Tantra, quotes a text that says:Stable, disciplined, and of intelligence, patient, honest, free from deception, knows mantra and the yogas of tantra, is compassionate, wise in the commentaries, knows well the ten activities,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Qualifications o f Master and Disciple 213is wise in mandala drawing, a master skilled in teaching tantra, of great faith and with senses tamed.6This quote also teaches the characteristics of a vajra master. These are not difficult to understand. The ten activities mentioned in the line “knows well the ten activities” taught in the last chapter of A n A dornm ent to the Vajra Essence Tantra [177]:The two rituals for repelling,the secret and wisdom-knowledge,the ritual of separating, the ritual food,vajra recitation, the ritual of wrathful expression,consecration, mandala meditation,these are the ten secret activities.Mandala, meditative concentration, mudra, standing posture, seated posture, recitation, the fire ritual, activity yoga, concluding.These are the ten outer activities.7The detailed meanings of these can be known from A Commentary on the Fifty Verses on the Guru, composed by the Omniscient Master.8 Such a per­son, therefore, endowed with such characteristics is suitable to be a guru and is capable of bestowing initiations and so forth.These characteristics may be further divided into those possessed by a fully ordained monk, those possessed by a novice monk, and those pos­sessed by a layperson. Among these three types of persons worthy of being a vajra master, a fully ordained monk is the best, a novice monk is second best, and a layman the lowest of the three. Therefore, when all three are present, it is the fully ordained monk that one should rely upon as one’s guru. Moreover kings should rely upon fully ordained monks as gurus, because if they rely upon laymen, it will bring harm to the teachings. How will this happen? If a layman is taken as a guru even though a fully ordained monk worthy of being a vajra master is accessible, the people will lose respect for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, which in turn will lead to the disappearance of the doctrine. The Great Commentary, on the second verse of the Initiations chapter, quotes passages that say:"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"214 Part 3: Initiations“O f the three who know well the ten activities, the full monk is the best, the novice is second best, the householder the lowest.”Similarly:“Except for those on arya levels, kings should not take householders as gurus.O f those whose learning is complete,who perform deeds of those possessing the signs,except for those upon arya levels,venerating vajra masterswhile they live as householderswill bring disrespect for Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.”Also:“For consecrating temples and so forth, from among those possessing the signs, if all three are in one place, the white-clothed householder is not the one.”Therefore, by examining the master in many ways, disciples should devote themselves to a master as taught by the buddha.9Therefore, knowing the characteristics of a guru worthy of devotion, one should seek out the proper guru. [178]Characteristics of those unsuitable to be gurus The third verse of the Initiations chapter says:Proud, ruled by anger, and lacking vows,greedy, without knowledge, working to deceive disciples,a mind that has fallen from great bliss,without initiation, totally attached to wealth,unaware, of harsh and coarse words, filled with carnal desire,the wise disciples should abandon taking such people"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Qualifications o f Master and Disciple 215as causes of complete enlightenment as they would abandon hell.10People with such faults are not fit to be relied upon as gurus in the Vajra Vehicle. Even if one takes such a person as a guru and requests initiations and so forth, there can be no meaningful receiving of the initiation. More­over one will become infected by a measure of his faults and fall from all elevated status in this and future lives. Most of the above verse is easy to understand. “Without knowledge” means to be without the essential teach­ings on the six-branched yoga, for example. “Working to deceive his dis­ciple” means to delude disciples by telling lies. “A mind that has fallen from the great bliss, without initiation” means that without having received the initiation he is bestowing, he nevertheless teaches it to others. “Filled with carnal desire” means working only for the pleasure gained from the sexual union of the two organs.Therefore the way to rely upon a guru is firstly to know the character­istics worthy and unworthy of devotion and then to examine thoroughly who is and who is not fit to be a guru. The Great Commentary says on the second verse of the Initiations chapter:Disciples who wish to gain worldly and nonworldly powers by way of mantra should first devote themselves to a guru. Fur­thermore one should examine the vajra master thoroughly. One should thoroughly examine his words. Otherwise, relying upon a guru unexamined, the disciples’ dharma will be perverse, and perverse dharma will send them to hell.11 [179]Also the Paramarthaseva says:He, omniscient in the complete Vajra Vehicle, has said that very wished-for siddhi follows the master.If perfect disciples examine the master, therefore, as they would gold, they will not accrue even the tiniest of faults.12However what should one do if one already regards as a guru someone endowed with those unworthy characteristics? The Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"2i 6 Part y. InitiationsIn mantra, even though one has taken as a guru a person with the faults of pride and so forth, wise disciples, meaning those of intelligence, will abandon him as a cause of complete enlight­enment as they would abandon hell.13Also:Because of these words, even though he has been taken as a guru, if he does these wrong deeds, disciples who strive for free­dom should leave him.14A passage quoted in the Great Commentary says:W ithout compassion, angry and malicious,arrogant, grasping, uncontrolled, and boastful,the intelligent disciple will not take such a one as guru.15Therefore, if one has taken someone with these faults as a guru, then the disciple who is seeking freedom should part company with him and not associate with him again. These quotes from the Great Commentary teach just this point and this point only. They do not teach that one should lose one’s faith due to seeing faults because, as it is so righdy said:Once that is used as a reason and one casts off the undertaking of holding him as a guru and as a field of reverence, one opens up the opportunity for a root downfall to occur. One must learn, therefore, to distinguish what is to be developed from what is to be discarded.16Some explain the two instances of the phrase “taken as a guru” in the two Great Commentary passages above as applying to gurus taken by others.What should one do if a qualified lama with all characteristics cannot be found?

Ways of devoting oneself to a guru2. Exceptional circumstancesWays of devoting oneself to a guru The Great Commentary says:Monks who wear the saffron robes should prostrate to the vajra master at all times.18Fifty Verses on the Guru also states:W ith great faith and at all times,with flower mandalas, and with palms pressed togetherdevote yourself to the teacher guru,bowing your head to his feet.19As these quotes state, at all times, morning, noon, and night, devote yourself to the guru by bowing your head to the feet of one who has shown you the path of the Vajra Vehicle by bestowing upon you initia­tions and so forth. Is this then a partial prostration? It is not, because the mandala decorated with flowers is offered before pressing the palms together and prostrating.W hat exactly is meant by devotion? The Great Commentary says:“Firstly, the guru to devote oneself to” means devoting yourself by pleasing him with your children, wife, and so forth.20Fifty Verses on the Guru also says:"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"2i8 Part 5: InitiationsIf to one’s samaya master one devotes oneself constantly by giving that which is not to be given— one’s children, one’s wife, and one’s life— what need to mention fleeting wealth.21In the first chapter of the second section of the Sam puta Tantra it says:Prostrate and offeryour wife, your daughter,your maids, and manservants.Pledge, “All that I own,with a mind of faith, I offer to the guru.From this day on I offer myself to you as servant.”22As the quotes indicate, you should serve the lama with offerings ranging from your possessions to your own life. [181] The way to accomplish that and the benefits of doing so are taught in F ifty Verses on the G uru:Whatever is in the smallest way beautiful, whatever is extraordinarily special, offer it all to the guru.Such giving becomes constant giving to every enlightened being.Such giving is the accumulation of merit,from which comes the supreme accomplishment.23Furthermore the reason why one should please the guru by offering even one’s own body is stated in the same text:Because the state of a buddha, so hard to reach even over millions of eons, is given in this very life to those who strive.24Therefore you should please the guru in many ways with wealth and devotion."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Qualifications o f Master and Disciple 219Exceptional circumstances The Great Commentary says:Monks who wear the saffron robes should prostrate to the vajra master at all times. To householders and to novices, except at times of teaching, they should not. As it is said:“To avoid criticism from the worldly, place the holy dharma in front of one, and to householders and to novices, holders of vows should mentally prostrate.”Similarly:“Avoiding lowly tasks and prostration, holders of vows should make their devotions by arranging his seat, rising in his presence, and helping with his needs.”25Therefore, if one is a householder or novice of the same status as a fully ordained vajra master, how should one act? One should avoid lowly acts, such as washing his feet, and one should not perform the five-limbed prostration,26 but when the guru visits, one should perform devotions of offering gems, money, and so forth. At times of teaching, in order to avoid criticism from the worldly, prostrate to the holy dharma and so forth in front of one.27The two verses beginning, “To avoid criticism from the worldly” and “Avoiding lowly tasks and prostration” appear in Fifty Verses on the Guru as they are quoted here in the Great Commentary. Therefore they must both have been taken from the same tantra.The above are exceptions to the previously taught ways of devotion. When one is a monk and one’s vajra master is a householder, or when one is a fully ordained monk and one’s vajra master, although a monk, is not fully ordained and thus a novice, one should arrange his seat, rise in his presence, cater to his needs, and perform other such devotions, but one"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"220 Part y Initiationsshould not prostrate or perform lowly tasks such as washing his feet. Also, when one’s guru is a householder or novice and is teaching, [182] one places a volume of the holy dharma or a statue in front of oneself and physically prostrates to it while in one’s mind prostrating to the guru.The Great Commentary explains that the reason why a fully ordained monk should not prostrate to a householder or to a new monk who is not fully ordained is to prevent the people from losing faith in the doctrine. On this point the omniscient master [Jé Tsongkhapa] says that the teaching on not prostrating was taught to prevent a loss of faith in the doctrine, and there­fore, on occasions where the possibility of such a loss does not exist, a fully ordained monk should always prostrate to his householder or novice-monk vajra master.28 However, in the Cakrasamvara Commentary, when describing the food and drink ritual of the thirty-six kinds of maidservants, it says:If a householder or a novice monk becomes one’s guru, during teachings the fully ordained holder of vows places the holy dharma and so forth in front and prostrates. However, at times other than teaching, that is not the case. At these other times, lowly tasks and prostrations should be avoided, while every other devotion, such as rising before he enters, arranging his seat, and so forth, should be performed. Lowly tasks, such as washing his feet as well as verbal and mental prostrations, are to be avoided, and devotions are to be made with offerings of wealth. This is to be done by the fully ordained for the house­holder and novice monk.29This passage says that at times other than at teachings the fully ordained should not prostrate, even verbally and mentally, to his householder or novice-monk vajra master. I think this needs some investigation.Furthermore “novice” refers only to being a novice monk, because the Cakrasamvara Commentary explains that a fully ordained monk should pros­trate to his fully ordained vajra master, even though the master be younger in learning and so forth. [183] This can be known from the Cakrasamvara Commentary further on from the previous quote, where it says:The fully ordained monk who has received the initiation of a vajra master and become the vajra-holder guru is to be pros­trated to by fully ordained monks at all times.30"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Qualifications o f Master and Disciple 221Upon whom initiations are bestowed: A definition of the discipleDisciples to be gathered by a completely qualified vajra master are of three kinds— lowest, middling, and best. O f the first kind, the Great Commen­tary says:The lowest are not to be brought together by initiation but by lay disciplines.31Similarly the Hevajra Tantra states:First they are given purification practice,32 then the ten areas of practice.They are taught the Vaibhasika tenets, then the Sautrantika, followed by Yogacara, and finally the Madhyamaka.33O f low intelligence are those whose minds are yet to be ripened by any of the three vehicles. Initially they are gathered by lay disciplines and gradu­ally led to the Madhyamaka view. Middling disciples have minds ripened by the path of the common vehicle. They are also attracted by the Vajra Vehicle, but they have no desire for the supreme siddhi of mahamudra in this life and strive only for various siddhis such as those of “peaceful activ­ity” and common siddhis such as the eight siddhis. They are of middling intelligence, and in order to lead them into the meditations of the genera­tion stage, they are gathered only by the seven initiations of childhood.34 The Great Commentary says:Those who strive for the accomplishment of worldly powers are to be gathered by the seven initiations in order to bring them to the meditations upon mantra, mudra, and mandala. This is the merit of the middling disciple.35On the best disciple the Great Commentary says:Those who strive for the mahamudra are to be gathered by the initiations of the vase, the secret, and so forth, in order to bring them to the meditations of the path of emptiness.36"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"222 Part y. Initiations[184] Therefore those possessed of characteristics such as determination to attain the mahamudra siddhi and other characteristics taught in the tantra are gathered by the bestowal of the eleven initiations followed by the higher initiations of the vase, the secret, and so forth. What are the characteristics of this disciple as taught in the tantra? The fourth verse of the Initiations chapter of the Condensed Tantra says:A disciple with a mind for the profound and the vast, taking joy in the certainties of the guru, with the spirit of renunciation, a knowledge of the qualities, striving for freedom, respect for the tantras, of an undistracted mind, of that received well hidden, whose friends of the wicked become weaker.37This verse teaches the characteristics of the disciple. The following lines teach how such a disciple is gathered by a guru:Such a one is gathered by the very wise gurus, with the wisdom initiation and so forth as the cause.38To explain roughly these characteristics: in the line “a mind for the pro­found and the vast,” profound refers to compassion without apprehension, or the gnosis of unchanging bliss and emptiness. Vast refers to aspected emptiness, or empty form endowed with every supreme aspect. These two, the vast and the profound, are indivisible. The disciple has “a mind for” and strives for the profound and vast.“Taking joy in the certainties of the guru” means to be free of the four­teen root downfalls and to take joy in the ten virtues. “W ith the spirit of renunciation” means to have left behind the busy life and to have no regard for wealth and possessions. “A knowledge of the qualities” means to have an unshakable faith in the Three Jewels. “Striving for freedom” means to have no regard for the attainment of worldly siddhis, such as those of peace, and to strive only for nonworldly siddhis. “Respect for the tantras” means guarding the vows taught in the tantras. “O f an undistracted mind” means not to be distracted by or content with the worldly paths of the generation stage and so forth.“O f that received well hidden” means that for as long as it falls outside"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Qualifications o f Master and Disciple 223the realm of one’s experience, all profound instruction received on the completion stage is kept well hidden. The “wicked” in the line “whose friends of the wicked become weaker” refers to those who live lives of non­virtue, such as householders, and who work for material gain. Their “friends” are the paths of the ten nonvirtues, and in the disciple these become “weaker.” [185]To summarize, the best disciple is one whose mind has been purified by the Mahayana mind39 along with other practices of the common path, and who has completed the generation stage. Alternatively, if the generation stage has not been completed, the best disciple is one who has received the seven initiations of childhood to ripen the mind for the generation stage and who has no desire to attain the common powers but strives from the depths of his heart to achieve the supreme siddhi of mahamudra."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"'escription of the MandalaW h ere th e i n i t i a t i o n is bestow ed: A d e sc rip tio n o f th e m a n d a ta Ghantâpàda said:Before the initiation, the mandala, these are the words of Vajradhara.40The seven initiations taught here and the vase and other initiations taught elsewhere are bestowed in mandalas of colored powder and other sub­stances, whereas the vase initiation and the other higher initiations taught here are to be conferred in mandalas constructed from the body of the mudrà consort, the female organ, or bhaga, and the bodhi mind. The Great Commentary says:For the accomplishment of gnosis, the Buddha spoke of three other mandalas:“The body, bhaga, and mind, by vajras of body, speech, and mind, become three kinds of mandala, the other of five colors is not used.”Therefore, to attain the great bliss, and for the supreme initiation, the mandala of colored powder is not used.41Generally, for the initiations of the five tathàgatas, many kinds of man­dalas have been described. These include those of colored powder, those drawn on cloth, body mandalas, and mandalas of meditative concentration."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"226 Part 3: InitiationsConcerning the mandala for the bestowal of the seven initiations as described here, some lamas say that the disciple of middling intelligence is first initiated or ripened by the seven initiations of water, crown, and so forth, in external mandalas of colored powder, drawn on cloth, cast in metal, or in three dimensions, and so forth. [186] However this should be understood in terms of normal and exceptional circumstances. Usually the seven initiations as taught here are only to be bestowed in mandalas of col­ored powder. A Short Teaching on Initiations says:These seven initiations are given with mandala constructed.42And Naropa’s commentary states:These seven initiations are only to be given in mandalas of col­ored powder and not in those drawn on cloth and so forth.43Sadhuputra’s commentary to the same text says:The seven initiations are bestowed only in mandalas of colored powder and not in mandalas drawn on cloth and so forth, because these were not taught by the Buddha in the tantras.44There are exceptions. In the Great Commentary, regarding verse 200 of the Initiations chapter of the Condensed Tantra, it says:“Lacking the material” refers to bestowing initiations upon asce­tic disciples. In such cases, if there is no material for these dis­ciples, the guru “bestows the initiations without material, and by the words of the victorious master they are given to ascetics.”This means that the seven initiations are given in order, and then the three, beginning with the vase, are given. “Similarly the fourth, with the paths of smoke and so forth” is to be given.Thus it is written.45For ascetic disciples,46 even when there are no materials for the drawing of the colored-powder mandala, it is taught that the master bestows the eleven initiations in their entirety.

These are exceptions.Also it says in the third summary from the Realms chapter:I will lead you into this mandala palace of the conqueror Kalacakra and bestow upon you worldly and nonworldly initi­ations.47Thus Suryaratha and the other rsi were lead into and initiated inside a mind-created mandala of the five precious substances. [187] This too was an exception.It may be wondered if the mention of ascetic disciples in the commen­tary refers to the bestowing of initiation on ascetic disciples who lack the necessary wealth to be used as an offering for the initiation, and that even for these ascetic disciples the seven initiations must be conferred in a man­dala of colored powder. However the meaning of the commentary passage is that the above procedure must be followed when an ascetic disciple lacks the material wealth for constructing a powder mandala. This is so because, as Kalacakrapada says regarding the above lines in his commentary to A Short Teaching on Initiations:Now the seven initiations, in a mandala of colored powder pre­viously built by those with wealth, are taken from a guru. As it is said:“These seven initiations are given with mandala constructed.”48This says that the mandala of colored powder is constructed on the assump­tion of the presence of wealth, and that special provision must be made for ascetic disciples. If this were not so, then the insistence on a mandala of col­ored powder as found in the two commentaries to A Short Teaching on I n i­tiations would be incorrect.A further point on this topic of using a colored-powder mandala in the seven initiations is that if the body, speech, and mind mandalas are not complete, it is acceptable to bestow the initiations using the mind mandala. The twenty-fifth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the Condensed Tantra says:"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"228 Part y InitiationsO f the types of mandalas for initiation, the outer are inferior.49This teaches that the initiations can be bestowed using the mind mandala, without the body and speech mandalas.

Therefore the teaching that such practice is acceptable is correct. [188]How are the deity approximation practices to be performed for a com­plete mandala of body, speech, and mind? The Great Commentary says, on the thirty-fifth verse of the Initiations chapter:The sixteen-line mantra of the Conqueror recited ten million times accomplishes all tasks. Ten times 100,000 fire rituals will achieve all of the eight great siddhis, but before that, the approx­imation practices are required.53A similar point is made for the seventy-two-line mantra. Approximation practice, therefore, is necessary. Great scholars have said, however, that if it were necessary to recite as many approximation practice mantras as there are deities, these days it would be difficult to complete even the approximation practices. Therefore one should use a skillful approach to the practice of approximation. How is that to be done? The Great Commentary, on the thirty-eighth verse of the Gnosis chapter of the Condensed Tantra, begins:The text speaks of reciting mantras in order to achieve worldly siddhis.and continues until:In this way, the mantra chains are recited each day as complete circles of breath.

Likewise the speech is purified and similarly the mind.55Each line of the seventy-two-line mantra chain lies between the three syl­lables om ah hum, which are the seeds of enlightened body, speech, and mind. The lines are also intertwined with the syllables of the dakinl and daka name mantras and finalized with the syllable phat. The seventy-two lines of this mantra chain are joined to the winds of the sixty minor move­ments of wind, as well as the gnosis wind that flows at the changeover point of the twelve major movements of wind. The count of corresponding in- and out-breaths are taken as the count of mantras. In this way, the count of the approximation practices also becomes the count of the breaths at the time of the mantra count. This is the assertion of a lama and great scholar (dharma master Sherinpa), but I wonder if it is correct.56 It would be right for the discriminating to investigate."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"e InitiationsA presentation o f the initiations to be bestowed[189] This is under three headings:1. The number of initiations2.. The order of initiations3. An explanation of each initiationThe number o f initiationsThe Vajrapdni Commentary of the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries states: ’’7Similarly, in the D d k in i Vajra T en t Tantra, the Conqueror taught the fourth initiation apart from the third:“The vase initiation is the first, the second is stated to be the secret.Wisdom-knowledge is the third, the fourth is not like that.”Also in the fifteenth chapter:“The water initiation is the first, the crown initiation the second, third is the ribbon empowerment, fourth the vajra and bell, the fifth is one’s own conduct, name is the sixth,the Buddha’s permission, the seventh, the eighth is the vase initiation,"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"232 Part y Initiationsthe secret initiation the ninth, the wisdom initiation is the tenth, reality is by the vajra yoga.”58Here passages from the D a k in i Vajra T ent Tantra are quoted. Immediately after this, the text continues:“Reality is by the vajra yoga.” Clearly the eleventh was taught by the Conqueror principally so that the wise should understand the fourth or the eleventh initiation as separate.This ascertains the number of initiations to be conferred. There are seven initiations, beginning with the water initiation, which proceed in accor­dance with the stages of childhood. These are followed by the three higher worldly initiations of the vase, secret, and wisdom-knowledge, and finally the nonworldly higher-than-high ultimate fourth initiation.There is a reason for determining the number of initiations. This con­cerns the type of person to be gathered by the vajra master giving initiation.[190] There are those who for the time being seek only worldly siddhis and, therefore, wish to practice only the generation stage. Then there are those who seek only the supreme siddhi and, therefore, seek the practices of the completion stage. For the first of these types, only the seven child­hoodlike initiations are conferred. The second type of person starts their meditations on the generation stage and, when that is perfected, practices the meditations of the completion stage in their entirety. For such a per­son all eleven initiations are bestowed. Just these eleven and no more are required to create suitable vessels for the meditation paths of these two types of persons.The number of initiations is also ascertained as eleven in A Short Teach­ing on Initiations:First, the seven initiations for the children to enter by: three by worldly convention, the fourth by ultimate reality.59Also, farther on, when explaining their meanings:"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Initiations 233The initiations of the vase and the secret, that known as wisdom-knowledge, and again the gnosis of that great wisdom: change, change, and fall, and then no farther fall.60Thus the eleventh, or the fourth counting from the vase initiation, is explained as being the ultimate nonworldly initiation.However four higher initiations and four higher-than-high initiations have been taught, making fifteen altogether. How is this explained? There is no error here, because the higher vase initiation and the higher-than- high vase initiation are similar insofar as they are both vase initiations. Likewise the two secret initiations are both secret initiations. The wisdom- knowledge initiations are both wisdom-knowledge initiations. That which is explained as the worldly fourth initiation is actually the third, or wisdom- knowledge initiation, and is given the name “fourth initiation.” [191]The order of initiationsThe eleven initiations begin with the water initiation and end with the ultimate fourth initiation. As Acarya Nagarjuna says in his Five Stages:Well established within the generation stage, they yearn for the stage of completion.This method, like the steps of a ladder, the fully enlightened Buddha has taught.61As this verse says, one moves to the completion stage having trained well in the generation stage. This is the defined order. Similarly one must first be made into a suitable vessel for the generation-stage meditations with the seven initiations and then turned into suitable vessels for the medita­tions of the completion stage by means of the higher initiations.The order of the seven initiations is also clearly defined. When a child is born, it is washed in order to help it grow. Later its hair is tied to the top of its head. Its ears are pierced and so forth. The child is encouraged to laugh and talk, it discovers pleasures, it is given a name,62 and finally it is"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"234 Part 3: Initiationstaught to read and write. The seven initiations are conferred in correlation with this sequence. The Vajragarbha Commentary says:At birth women wash the child, and the water initiation is given.Its hair is tied upon its head, this is known as the crown.The ears are pierced, and so forth, explained as being the ribbon initiation.The child laughs and speaks,the bell and vajra initiation is conferred.The fifth, childhood pleasures, is the conduct initiation.The name is the name initiation.Reading and so forth is the permission.These are given by mother and father, of which there are seven, known as the seven initiations.63Therefore, because they follow in the footsteps of a child, they are taught as the seven childhood initiations. The order of the four higher initiations is defined by the significance of a preceding initiation that necessarily leads into the following initiation. [192]Some say that there is no clearly defined order to the seven childhood initiations and the four higher initiations because the seven initiations must be conferred within an external colored-powder mandala, and in the higher initiations the colored-powder mandalas are rejected. The Great Commen­tary says, on the first verse of the Initiations chapter:For the ultimate truth, the colored-powder mandala is not drawn, because it was rejected by the Conqueror. This is stated in the O riginal Buddha by the Conqueror:“Construction of vajra lines, construction by colored powder also, are not to be done within mantra reality.If they are, enlightenment is difficult.”And so on until:"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The Initiations 235Therefore, for the achievement of great bliss and for the giving of supreme initiation, the colored-powder mandala is not used.64This, they say, clearly states that for the higher initiations, the colored- powder mandala is not necessary, whereas it is necessary for the seven ini­tiations. They think, therefore, that it is acceptable to practice the six-branched yoga with just the four higher initiations and without the pre­ceding seven initiations. This, they believe, is the intention of the tantra and its commentaries, and it seems that some past and present practitioners of the six-branched yoga practiced and continue to practice that way. This, however, is not correct. Naropa’s commentary to the line “these seven ini­tiations” in A Short Teaching on Initiations says:Within the eleven initiations mentioned in A Short Teaching art the steps to the palace of the nonworldly siddhis. These are explained as the seven lower and conventional initiations with form.65This teaches that in the achievement of the nonworldly siddhis, which are the fruits of the higher initiations, the seven initiations are compared to steps leading to a palace. Therefore the seven initiations must precede the higher initiations. Furthermore, at the time of taking the secrecy pledges, it is commanded:Do not speak of this to those who have not entered the mandala, or your pledges will weaken.The mandala mentioned here has to be a colored-powder mandala. It makes no sense for the bhaga mandala and so forth to be the first mandala that the disciple enters. [193] Moreover the secrets, which if revealed result in a weakening of one’s pledges, are secrets of mantra, and there are no greater secrets to be revealed than those of the higher initiations. Telling them, therefore, to those not ripened constitutes a root downfall.There are also a number of different assertions concerning the order of the higher initiations. Some great scholars (such as the noble Rendawa), maintain that by just the initiations of the vase and the other three higher worldly initiations, one becomes a fit vessel to listen to the tantra and to meditate upon the six-branched yoga, and that the higher-than-high"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"236 Part y Initiationsinitiations, including the ultimate fourth initiation, are the initiations of the vajra-master great lord,66 enabling one to teach the entire tantra.One scholar (Rendawa) says that the method of bestowing the non- worldly fourth initiation is not explained here, and therefore the secret ini­tiation and the nonultimate wisdom-knowledge initiation renders one a fit vessel for the meditations on the path of the fourth initiation. O n these points the Great Commentary, discussing verse 119 of the Initiations chap­ter, says:The higher initiations are of two kinds. One kind is for leading sentient beings,67 for complete knowledge of the path, and for listening to the tantra. The other confers the status of great vajra master and creates the teacher.And so on until:For the purpose of leading sentient beings, there are four nonul­timate initiations.68The above passage contains explanations of the four worldly initiations and a description of the fourth as “the bliss of embrace.” The quote continues:Then, if they have studied and know every tantra and its exten­sive commentary, the initiation of the great lord is conferred.Until:In the fifth chapter on the ultimate, the mahâmudrâ gnosis will be explained extensively. Therefore it is not taught in detail here.69The above passages explain the four higher-than-high initiations as being the initiations of the vajra-master great lord, and that is the literal mean­ing of the text. However, to become a fit vessel to listen to the tantras and so forth, the ultimate fourth initiation, in the form of a word initiation, must be bestowed. [194] The reason for this will be explained later.The common assertion (of the Jonang followers) is that for the vajra- master lord initiation, the four higher-than-high initiations do not have to"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The Initiations 237be conferred, and some (such as the dharma master Tsalmin)70 maintain that at the end of the first four higher initiations, just the nonworldly fourth is conferred, and for the lord initiation, the four higher-than-high initia­tions are not conferred. That, however, contradicts the previous quote that runs:The other confers the status of great vajra master and creates the teacher.Here the word “other” refers to initiations, and is the commentary to “The disciple who is a householder offers the ten consorts to the guru” and so forth. This commentary explains that for the vajra-master lord, the higher- than-high initiations of the vase and so forth, in which one sits in union with the ten mudrâs, are conferred.They would reply that there is no fault, because for the vajra-master ini­tiation there is the vajra-master lord initiation and vajra-master great lord initiation. Concerning the first, the Great Commentary says:Then the disciple who knows all tantras and dwells in the pledges is initiated by the guru into vajra lord.The passage continues up to:This is the initiation ceremony of the vajra-master lord.71At this point the ceremonies for the higher-than-high initiations have not been taught. The second initiation, the vajra-master great lord, is explained by the Great Commentary in the passage:Then, if they have heard and learned every tantra and its com­mentaries, the initiation of the great lord in its proper order is taught, and the disciple who is a householder offers the ten con­sorts to the guru.72Thus they maintain that the vajra-master great lord initiation can be accepted as being the initiation ceremony of the vase and other higher- than-high initiations that include the union of the ten consorts.

If it were, then there would be three kinds of higher initiations— one for listening to the tantras, one for the vajra-master lord, and one for the vajra-master great lord. [195] The Great Commentary, however, divides them into two:The higher initiations are of two kinds. One kind is for leading sentient beings, for complete knowledge of the path, and for listening to the tantra. The other confers the status of great vajra master and creates the teacher.73Therefore the higher initiations are for listening to the tantra and so forth, and the higher-than-high initiations of the vajra-master great lord are for teaching the tantra to disciples and so forth. Furthermore, in the earlier commentary passage, there are descriptions of the disciple on whom the vajra-master lord initiation is bestowed:Then the disciple who knows all tantras and dwells in the pledges.And:Ah! Wonderful guru! Because of your kindness I now know all the paths of those who have traveled to bliss.Also:He sees the disciple endowed with every good quality dwelling in the pledges.74Descriptions of such a disciple also occur in the later passage:Then, if they have studied and know every tantra and its com­mentaries...And:Ah!

There are also no differences between the passages on the reason for conferring the vajra-master initiation. To explain the need for the initiation, the former passage says:The vajra-master initiation is conferred upon the monks, novice monks, and laymen, and speech permission to teach the tantra is given.And:The monk who is initiated into the teacher initiation.76In the later passage also:To become a lord, those who wish for the level of the vajra mas­ter of the great mandala should offer the ten mudras.77[196] Therefore the earlier and later passages are similar in that they both teach the purpose of the initiation to be the achievement of the status of vajra master of the great mandala— a bestower of initiations and a teacher of tantra.Whatever the reason may be, in the earlier passage just the word “lord” appears and in the later passage the words “great lord” appear, and if these assertions arise because the word “great” might or might not appear, they are damaged by the quote in the later passage beginning “To become a lord,” which only mentions the word “lord.”So what is the difference between the two passages? At the beginning of this fifth summary from the Great Commentary, it says:The rituals of consecration from the gloriously supreme Origi­n a l Buddha.nThis section then is to be an explanation of consecration rituals. These include the consecration of human beings to initiate them as great lords and the consecration, or initiation, of the gods as taught by the words “Nagas and so forth.” In this way, by explaining parts of the initiation ceremony of the great lord, the earlier passage, as well as the root tantra, is giving a"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"240 Part y.

This contradicts the above assertion. Furthermore such an assertion would mean that the eleven initiations, comprising the four higher initiations and the seven childhood initiations plus the nonworldly fourth illustrated by the worldly fourth, would be unable to create vessels suitable for listening to the entire tantra and to practice the stages of generation and completion in their entirety, for to create such suitable vessels, separate initiations into the four higher-than-high initiations would be required.An explanation of each initiationThis is under two headings:1.

All seven are rounded off by a water ritual and are therefore known as “the seven water initiations,” but the term vase in itia tio rf' is not used. These seven initiations are bestowed upon the disciple, who is placed opposite the four entrances to the colored-powder mandala. In front of the northern entrance, facing the white northern form-face of the main deity, the disciple stands in the form of the body vajra. The initiation deities then confer initiation. This is performed in a way that differs from other tantras. The five mothers within the colored-powder mandala bestow the water initiation, and the five tathagatas bestow the crown initiation.The disciple is then led to the southern entrance to be in front of the red speech-face of the south. There he generates himself in the form of the speech vajra and is empowered with the ribbon initiation by the ten s'akti, and with the vajra and bell initiation by the main deity and consort.

The water of the vases, which is the initiation substance, and the five elements of the disciple are generated into the five mothers. These deities melt, and the resultant vase water, in the nature of bodhicitta, is held aloft by the five mothers, who confer the water initiation. This purifies the five ele­ments of all defilements and grants the disciple the fortune to achieve the powers of the five mothers.Likewise the crown and the five aggregates of the disciple are generated into the five tathagatas. The crown initiation purifies the aggregates of defilements and grants the disciple the fortune to achieve the powers of the five tathagatas. Phenomena of the body are purified by these two ini­tiations, and the purifier of these phenomena is the white body-face of the main deity. The disciple, therefore, is placed at the mandala entrance oppo­site this face, where, in the form of body vajra, he receives the initiation.[199] In the ribbon initiation the ten ribbons and the ten winds of the disciple are generated as the ten sakti. The initiation purifies the ten winds so they become workable and capable of being brought into the central channel. In the vajra and bell initiation, the vajra and bell and left and right channel are each generated as the main deity and consort. The initi­ation renders the winds of the left and right channel capable of being gath­ered into the central channel. The ten winds and the left and right channel are phenomena of speech. Therefore the disciple is placed at the southern entrance facing the red speech-face, the purifier of these phenomena. There, in the form of speech vajra, the initiation is conferred on the disciple.In the conduct initiation, the thumb vajra, the six sense powers, and the six sense objects of the disciple’s continuum are generated as male and female bodhisattvas. The initiation is bestowed, creating the potential to remove the defilements of sense power moving to sense object. In the name initiation, the initiation bracelet and the action faculties and their activities85 are generated into the male and female wrathful deities. The name initia­tion is conferred, and seeds for the removal of the defilements of the six action faculties and their six activities are planted. The bracelet used as ini­tiation substance is said by Sadhuputra to be “a bracelet or garland of flow­ers tied around the arms and legs.”86 Phenomena purified by the conduct and name initiation are those of the mind.

The purifiers are the three pairs of initiations. A Short Teaching on Initiations says:Body, speech, and mind well purified by pairs of initiations.87Regarding the aggregate and element of gnosis to be purified by the per­mission initiation, the same tantra says:The permission purifies gnosis.88[200] Concerning the seven initiations purifying the elements, aggregates, and so forth, as explained above, the same tantra states:Water is the purification of the elements, the crown purifies the aggregates, the ribbon purifies the perfections.89 By the vajra and bell, the great unchanging, and the unbroken voice of the Buddha, the sun and moon are purified as one.Purification of object and sense is by the unmoving vajra of conduct.Name purifies love and so forth,90 permission purifies the very Buddha.91 These are the seven initiations.92The meaning of “by the vajra and bell, the great unchanging,” is that the great unchanging bliss is symbolized by the vajra.

One kind is for leading sentient beings, for complete knowledge of the path, and for listening to the tantra. The other confers the status of great vajra master and creates the teacher.93As this quote states, these initiations are determined as being of two kinds— the higher and those that are higher than high. The reason for this division is as follows. The primary intended disciple of the tantra, who is of the highest intelligence, listens to the complete tantra and is made into a suitable vessel for comprehensive practice of the completion stage. That is one kind of person. Having become such a suitable vessel, and whether or not the completion stage has been consummated within his mind, he comprehensively understands the meanings of the tantra and is worthy of teaching it to others. That is another type of person. The presentation of just the higher initiations is made on the basis of conferring initiation upon the first type of person, while the presentation of the higher-than-high ini­tiations is made on the basis of conferring initiation upon the second. Individually, the four higher initiations are the vase initiation, the secret"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"248 Part 3: Initiationsinitiation, the wisdom-knowledge initiation, which includes the worldly fourth initiation, and lastly the nonworldly fourth initiation. These are determined as follows. The disciple has listened to the tantra and has become a suitable vessel for all the meditations of completion stage, which consists of the six-branch yoga. The vase, secret, and wisdom-knowledge initiations will empower the disciple to practice the first five of the six- branched yoga. The nonworldly fourth initiation is the word initiation, and therefore empowers the disciple to practice the sixth branch of medi­tative concentration. The thinking of the previous passage from the Vajrapani Commentary, which quotes the D a k in i Vajra Tent Tantra and then determines the number of initiations to be eleven, is also that these ini­tiations are conferred in order to create suitable vessels for listening to the complete tantra and so forth. It is the thinking of the Vajrapani Com m en­tary that the meaning of the D a k in i Vajra T ent Tantra verse is that, of these eleven, the eleventh is the nonworldly fourth initiation, [202] which is the definitive fourth initiation of the hidden tantras as taught by the line “the fourth is likewise.” A Short Teaching on Initiations also says:Initiations of vase and secret, that known as wisdom-knowledge, again the knowledge of great wisdom.94Here the three higher initiations and the eleventh, or nonworldly fourth, are listed as topics to be explained. Then, as an explanation, the text con­tinues:Change, change, and fall, and then no farther fall.Purification of body, speech, and mind, the three initiations leading respectively to the fourth, the pure gnosis.Purifying body, speech, and mind,first a child, then a youth, and finally old,the fourth is the master of sentient beings.95These quotes teach the initiations that create suitable vessels for listening to and meditating on the tantra.

This is so because, in earlier commentary on the lines beginning “Initiations of vase and secret,” Naropa says:For those yogis to develop the conventional worldly powers, three initiations of the vase and so forth are taught as semblances of the ultimate.97In later commentary on these lines, Naropa quotes passages from the Con­densed Tantra in its explanation of the higher initiations of vase and so forth. These run from:Up to “direction” years, the one with ten aspects,98 look, and touch.[203] And up to:The first touch of the breasts of glorious wisdom is the initiation of the vase.Experiencing and looking at the “moon”99 in its secret place is the secret initiation.Within the wisdom-knowledge initiation, all are purified by the families of the conquerors, and the guru, having bestowed initiation, gives the mudra to the disciple.100The text of the Great Commentary on this passage is quoted and explained in Naropa s commentary. The Great Commentary runs from “For the vase and the other initiations, do not leave the young mudra for ten years” up to “The air element, being devoid of particles,101 is not to be held. This is thereby ascertained.”102Moreover, when Naropa quotes the Great Commentary from “The"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"250 Parí y Initiationshigher initiations are of two kinds” up to “In order to lead sentient beings, four kinds of conventional and worldly initiations are ascertained,”103 he does this as commentary to “Initiations of vase and secret, that known as gnosis.” Similarly it is the position of Nàropa’s commentary that the lines beginning “Initiations of vase and secret” also teach the four higher-than- high initiations.After explaining the vase, secret, and wisdom-knowledge initiations, Naropa’s commentary continues:Having briefly explained the three kinds of initiations for the accomplishment of worldly powers, the special eleventh initia­tion for the nonworldly powers is spoken of beginning with the words104 “and again.”105This explains that the line “and again the gnosis of great insight” teaches the nonworldly fourth initiation. On this line Naropas commentary says:“Great insight” is the mahâmudrâ, which will be explained, where nothing is posited by thought. Its gnosis is the great unchanging bliss produced by meditating upon it. This is the eleventh.And later:The Vajra D â k in ï T ent Tantra also speaks of the eleven initia­tions.106[204] This leads into:The Tent Tantra is quoted in Vajrapani’s commentary: “The vase initiation is the first.”And so on. Naropa’s commentary continues:“Reality is by the vajra yoga.” Primarily, the eleventh was clearly taught by the Conqueror so that the wise should understand the fourth or the eleventh initiation as being separate.107"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"The Four Higher Initiations 251The fourth, or the eleventh, as mentioned in the above line “should under­stand the fourth or the eleventh initiation as being separate,” is the non­worldly and ultimate fourth initiation. Moreover the decisive “the” from the phrase “also speaks of the eleven initiations” is a word that determines the number of initiations to be eleven. Therefore, to become a fit vessel for listening to the whole tantra and for meditating on the generation and completion stages in their entirety, at the end of the three higher initiations of the vase and so forth, the nonworldly fourth must be given verbally. This is the thinking of the Kdlacakratantra, of its commentary, and of mahâsiddha Naropa.Sadhuputra says the same in his M andala Ritual:Slowly taken by the tongue from the lotus, the mind of suchness drinks of the bodhicitta in the nature of samaya.108 This is the purification of mind, the ritual of the initiation of the wisdom knowledge. “Then the precious word initiation is given.” After the special bliss, the bodhicitta is meditated upon and is devel­oped after the three drops. It is totally free from all deluded thought, with no concept of any phenomena, in the nature of the great Vajradhara. This is the fourth initiation.109This passage explains that after the three higher initiations of the vase and so forth, which are conferred to create suitable vessels for listening to the tantra and so forth, the fourth, or nonworldly, ultimate initiation is bestowed. Therefore the words “Then the precious word initiation is given” teach that the fourth initiation is expressed in words and that the disciples’ actual understanding of the initiation is the meaning of the fourth initia­tion. Therefore those (such as the dharma master Tsalmin) are incorrect who maintain that after the instruction, “to place the mind in total non­conceptuality in a state in which there is no fabrication of the actual way phenomena exist,” the disciple places his mind a little in nonconceptual­ity and that this is the bestowal of the fourth initiation. [205]Others ask if Sâdhuputra’s description of the nonworldly fourth bestowed after the wisdom-knowledge third initiation actually refers to the higher-than-high wisdom-knowledge third initiation. This is not so, because the lines “Then the precious word initiation is given. After the spe­cial bliss” up to “This is the ritual of the conduct of the mind”110 teach that after the three higher initiations, the nonworldly fourth together with its"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"252 Part 3: Initiationsappendages is given.

Immediately after these lines, the M andala R itu a l says: “The remaining are as the previous.”112 This line is pointing for reference to the preceding explanation given when the nonworldly fourth initiation was conferred for the purposes of creating suitable vessels. There­fore the three higher-than-high initiations, which consist of the vase initia­tion in which the nine consorts are embraced, the secret initiation in which the nine consorts are relied upon, and the wisdom-knowledge initiation in which one enters union with the ten consorts, are conferred after the non­worldly fourth, which comes at the end of the three suitable-vessel-creating initiations of the vase, and so forth.Some (such as the noble Rendawa) say that if the nonworldly fourth was necessary to create suitable vessels for the complete hearing of the tantra, then what does the following quote from the Great Commentary mean?For the purpose of leading sentient beings, there are four nonul- timate initiations. Then, when they have heard and learned every tantra and its commentary.. ,113Does this quote not teach that in order to become fit vessels for a complete hearing of the tantra, [206] initiations up to the worldly fourth, in which the wisdom-knowledge initiation itself is given the name of the fourth, are sufficient? As far as what the words of the Great Commentary actually say, such a claim is true. However, in the Cakrasamvara Commentary it says:First the vase initiation,the second is said to be the secret,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The Four Higher Initiations 253gnosis the third,the fourth also is likewise.114In the H evajra Tantra also:“The vajra master, secret, and wisdom, the fourth also is likewise.”115In two other tantras, therefore, there are four initiations.In this commentary the fourth initiation as taught in the Later Guhya- samaja and the Hevajra Tantra are presented as topics for explanation. The Cakrasamvara Commentary continues:Here the worldly nonultimate vase initiation is the master initia­tion. By looking upon the secret place, nectar is experienced, and that is the secret initiation. The activity mudra consort116 is given, and from the two organs arises bliss. Knowledge of this is the wis­dom-knowledge initiation. The bodhicitta enters the jewel. Knowledge of its bliss is the gnosis fourth. By worldly truths, therefore, these are the four rituals of the interpretive initiations.117Therefore it is the thinking of the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries that this quote describes how the hidden tantras literally teach the four initia­tions, and that the tantra line “the fourth also is likewise” literally teaches the wisdom-knowledge initiation to be the fourth while actually teaching the ultimate nonworldly fourth initiation in a concealed way. The Great Commentary also, when explaining the four higher initiations, literally teaches an actual fourth initiation, as in the line “the fourth also is likewise,” and it has to be the thinking of the Great Commentary that the nonworldly fourth initiation, which is illustrated by this worldly fourth, is also conferred at this time in order to create fit vessels for hearing the tantra in its entirety. If this were not the case, it would contradict Sadhuputra’s explanation. Moreover it cannot be correct to say that the first three initiations are necessary for cre­ating fit vessels for the practice of the six-branched yoga up to the yoga of rec­ollection but that the nonworldly fourth is not necessary for creating fit vessels for the meditation upon the sixth yoga of meditative concentration.

The worldly fourthThe higher initiation of the vase“The first touch of the breasts of glorious wisdom is the initiation of the vase.” 118 As this line indicates, the guru leads the disciple to embrace and touch the breasts of a suitably qualified mudrà consort. By embracing her body and touching her breasts, the elemental bodhicitta stirs within the body. From this bliss arises, which is applied to emptiness to become the bliss and emptiness that is the nature of the vase initiation. Because it is received from the vases of the mudrà’s breasts, it is known as the vase ini­tiation. It is also known as the initiation of the master, as the H evajra Tantra says:By laughing, joy is attained.Pure laughing is the master.119Also, because it is obtained by relying upon the body of a wisdom woman,120 the initiation is taken within the body mandala.The secret initiation“Experiencing and looking at the ‘moon’ in its secret place is the secret ini­tiation.”121 The guru sits in union with a fully qualified mudra consort. The white element at the crown melts and falls along the path of his dhütï, where this basis of bliss is revealed at the tip of his jewel as symbolizing the"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The Four Higher Initiations 255inborn bliss. All the gods gather at the guru’s body, Nand with thumb and ring finger they place those drops in their molten state upon the tongue of the disciple for his experience. [208] W ith the blindfold removed, the dis­ciple looks upon the large lotus of the wisdom woman, and moved by great desire, the drops move within his body to create bliss. This bliss is applied to emptiness to become bliss and emptiness. This is the nature of the secret initiation. It is called a secret initiation because it is gained by the experi­ence of secret substance and taken within the secret bhaga mandala. As it is said:By looking, joy is attained; looking is similarly the secret.122The wisdom-knowledge initiationThe disciple is presented with a fully qualified wisdom woman by the guru. In accordance with his guru’s instruction, the disciple searches for her chan­nel, and when the indications are that it has been found, he sits in union with the wisdom lady in accord with instruction. During union the element melts and arrives at the secret-place cakra. The resulting bliss is applied to emptiness to form bliss-and-emptiness gnosis. This is the third initiation of wisdom-knowledge. Because it is gained by relying upon a wisdom woman, it is known as the wisdom-knowledge initiation, and because it is gained from the melting of the jasminelike123 bodhicitta, it is taken within the nonultimate bodhicitta mandala.When this initiation and the fourth worldly initiation are conferred using a wisdom woman, it is necessary to seek the channel of the wisdom woman. Sadhuputra mentions this in his M andala R itu a l when he says:W ith the finger visualized as a red hri, the left of the consort’s channel is moved, the si on the tongue is uttered.124The worldly fourthFrom sitting in union with the wisdom woman, the element moves to the vajra tip, and for as long as the state of retention can be maintained, innate bliss arises. This bliss applied to emptiness creates the gnosis of bliss and emptiness. This is the worldly fourth initiation. The line “the fourth also"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"256 Part y Initiationsis likewise” literally teaches this interpretive fourth initiation, and it is labeled the fourth within the wisdom-knowledge third. In this connection the Cakrasamvara Commentary says:The bodhicitta enters the jewel. Knowledge of its bliss is the gnosis fourth.125"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"e Higher-than-High Initiations[209] This is under two headings:1. The first three initiations2. The nonworldly fourthThe first three initiationsTaken literally, the Great Commentary talks of the four higher-than-high initiations as being solely for the creation of the vajra-master lord.1“ How­ever, in order to create suitable vessels for hearing the tantra in its entirety and so forth, the nonworldly fourth has to be conferred after the three worldly higher initiations. This has to be performed as explained by Sádhuputra and is the intention of the tantra and commentary as already explained.The rituals and their order can be known from the texts on mandala rituals, so here I will just mention a few of the special characteristics of the first three initiations. In this vase initiation the disciple embraces the wis­dom woman as encouraged by the guru and touches her breasts. From this action the nectar stream of the bodhicitta fluid descends from the crown to the sixteen petals of the forehead cakra. The resulting bliss divides into the joys of body, speech, mind, and gnosis. This is applied to emptiness to create the gnosis of bliss and emptiness.In the secret initiation the disciple’s vajra slightly penetrates the secret place of the wisdom woman he has embraced and whose breasts he has touched. This causes the bodhicitta to descend from the thirty-two petals of the throat cakra to the eight petals of the heart cakra. The resultant bliss divides into the supreme joys of body, speech, mind, and gnosis, which is applied to emptiness to create the gnosis of bliss and emptiness.In the wisdom-knowledge initiation the vajra enters the secret place of the wisdom woman. From its vigorous movement bodhicitta moves down"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"258 Part y Initiationsfrom the sixty-four petals of the navel cakra to the thirty-two petals of the secret-place cakra. [210] The very clear semen is liquid and moves to the opening of the vajra jewel. The resulting bliss divides into the special joys of body, speech, mind, and gnosis, which is applied to emptiness to create the gnosis of bliss and emptiness. This is one way of describing the first three higher-than-high initiations. A Short Teaching on Initiations states:By touching the breasts of wisdom comes the bliss of moving bodhicitta.Initiation is by the breasts,127 from its bliss it is conferred.This is the child.From moving to the secret place, the bliss of moving bodhicitta and the initiation of the secret.From its bliss is it conferred.This is the youth.From moving to the secret place, the moving bliss at the vajra tip, the initiation of wisdom-knowledge, from which comes movement and travel.This is the adult.128I have presented above the meaning of these lines according to the vener­able Näropa’s commentary, which says:The “wisdom” is a woman from the age of twelve to twenty. By conferring initiation she is the giver of the mind’s joy. By touch­ing her breasts, “comes the bliss of moving bodhicitta.” This means that the stream of molten nectar moves from the four petals of the crown lotus to the sixteen petals of the forehead lotus. This produces the experience of bliss whose nature is bod­ily joy, the joy of speech, the joy of the mind, and the joy of gno­sis. This is the child. Initiation is bestowed by the breasts of the yoginl. This is the first initiation and so is known as the child. Then the vajra slightly penetrates her secret place to produce"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Higher-than-High Initiations 259“the bliss of moving bodhicitta.” This means that it moves from the throat lotus of thirty-two petals to the center of the heart lotus of eight petals to create the experience of bliss whose nature is supreme bodily joy, supreme joy of speech, supreme joy of the mind, and supreme joy of gnosis. This, because it is higher than the previous joy, is known as the “youth,” and is the secret initiation.Then vigorous motion produces “movement and travel,” which means traveling from the navel cakra of sixty-four petals to the secret cakra of thirty-two petals. [211] The molten drops of fluid, in fifteen parts whose tips are very clear, travel to the very opening of the vajra jewel, producing the experience of bliss whose nature is the special bodily joy, special joy of speech, spe­cial joy of the mind, and special joy of gnosis. This is the “adult” and the initiation of wisdom-knowledge129Nevertheless to explain the secret initiation as being the supreme-joy gno­sis produced from bodhicitta falling from the throat cakra to the heart cakra, the wisdom-knowledge initiation as being the special joy produced by the descent from the heart cakra to the secret cakra, and the actual wis­dom-knowledge initiation as being the innate bliss applied to emptiness formed from the fluid arriving at the tip of the vajra jewel, is a good expla­nation130 of the lines beginning “By touching the breasts of wisdom comes the bliss of moving bodhicitta.”131Náropa’s explanation of these lines from the tantra is also that of the Cakrasamvara Commentary, whose explanation is also made on the basis of these initiations being higher-than-high initiations. This is so because after its explanation of the higher worldly fourth initiation, this commentary, referring to these initiations, says “The ultimate is to come; these are deluded and not ultimate.”132 The Cakrasamvara Commentary continues:Here, using different language from other tantras and with a meaning that is definitive, it is taught again using the name “vase.” The changing bliss that arises from touching is the initi­ation of the vase. The changing bliss arising from the vajra approaching the secret is the initiation of the secret. When the two organs dwell together to produce the bliss of the descending fluid, this is the initiation of wisdom-knowledge. The unchanging"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"z6o Part y Initiationsbliss formed by desire for the mahamudra is the initiation described in the line “the fourth also is likewise.” Therefore the four initiations are differentiated as “changing, changing, falling, and unchanging.”133 [212] In this way initiation is conferred.These are the initiations.As reference for the above, the commentary quotes A Short Teaching on Initiations:As spoken of in the Supreme O riginal Buddha, “First, the seven initiations.”134And:“The initiations of the vase and the secret,” up to “Purification of body, speech, and mind.”135Actual initiations of secret and wisdom-knowledge as described here are not suitable for the ordained. W ith this in mind the glorious Atis'a says in his Light on the Path:Because it is forcefully forbiddenin the great tantra of the O riginal Buddha,the secret and wisdom-knowledge initiationshould not be taken by those of brahma conduct.136If such initiations are takenwithin the asceticism of the brahmacarya,it becomes forbidden conduct.The vows of asceticism will weaken,becoming a downfall for those of disciplined behavior,they fall certainly to lower realms,with never a chance of attainment.137By merely experiencing the secret substances of the secret initiation, the downfall mentioned in the line “becoming a downfall for those of disci­plined behavior” will not occur.Furthermore the vase initiation consists of bliss arising from embracing the nine mudras and from touching the breasts, which is then applied to emptiness to produce the gnosis of bliss and emptiness. The secret initiation"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Higher-than-High Initiations 261consists of the guru sitting in sexual union with the nine mudrás, whose ages range from twelve to twenty, and sucking the naramsika,™ or lower tip of the wisdom woman s central channel. The vajra containing the ele­mental bodhicitta drops is placed in the mouth of the disciple, whose mind- stream of practice has been purified. The bodhicitta is ejected, and the bliss arising from the experience of the ejected bodhicitta is applied to emptiness, producing bliss-and-emptiness gnosis. The wisdom-knowledge initiation consists of first sitting in sexual union with one’s wife and then with those mudrás from among the nine twelve- to twenty-year-olds with whom one is able to perform the act of union, from the middle watch of the night for two hours until the sun rises.139 [213] The bliss of this union is applied to emptiness to produce bliss-and-emptiness gnosis.This explanation of the ways to confer the higher and higher-than-high initiations is made on the basis that these are actual initiations to be given to laypeople. For fully ordained monks and other monastics, however, these initiations are to be conferred by using just the imagination to introduce them to the real significance of the initiation. Vajradhara said again and again that the fully ordained monk is the best of mantra practitioners, and if a fully ordained or novice monk were to actually take the particular secret and wisdom-knowledge initiations as described above, they would fall from their precepts.The nonworldly fourthThis is under three headings:1. The fourth as taught in the Kálacakra2. The fourth initiation in the hidden tantras as taught by the mahásiddhas3. How these two are interchangeableThe fourth as taught in the KálacakraThe Great Commentary on verse 112 of the Gnosis chapter says:Laughing, looking, holding hands, and joining together: these four kinds of initiation do not become suchness. Here suchness is not found within the embrace. That resulting from an activ­ity mudrá, if examined, does not become nondual gnosis.140"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"262 Part 3: InitiationsIn this passage suchness, or the nonworldly fourth, is referred to as nondual gnosis. The duality that becomes nondual in the term nonduality refers to emptiness and bliss, and this is explained again and again by the tantra and the commentary. Emptiness does not only refer to an emptiness of true exis­tence but to “empty form endowed with every supreme aspect.”141 Bliss also refers to a special bliss known as great unchanging bliss. [214] Empty form in its aspect of father and mother in union indivisibly united with the gno­sis of supreme unchanging bliss and emptiness is the fourth initiation. This bliss has to be unchanging bliss, because the Great Commentary says on verse 114 of the Gnosis chapter:From that arises the bliss beyond sorrow, unmoving, innate, unchanging.This is the fourth.142Concerning the emptiness also, the commentary states:The emptiness not produced by activity mudra and wisdom mudra is one clearly endowed with every aspect.143This clearly talks of empty form endowed with every supreme aspect. Fur­thermore, in the first summary of the Realms chapter, the Great Commen­tary says:The supreme and unchanging fourth is the gnosis of the bud- dhas.144This explains that “the fourth” from the line “The fourth also is likewise” refers to the supreme and unchanging bliss. The Great Commentary con­tinues:That which again is likewise, was taught by the Buddha to be one’s mahamudra.145This teaches that the term likewise refers to empty form endowed with every supreme aspect, and that the inseparability of empty form with unchanging bliss and emptiness is the fourth initiation. Furthermore, in Naropa’s Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, he says:"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The Higher-than-High Initiations 263The mahámudrá is of a form arising from space. From one’s meditational experience arising from the subsequent desire for this form comes the “unmoving.” This means that emission is prevented and does not move beyond the vajra jewel. The bliss of nonemission of the moon nectar in the form of the innate bodily joy, the innate joy of speech, the innate joy of mind, and the innate joy of gnosis is the great wisdom-knowledge and is the conferring of the fourth initiation as taught by the words “The fourth also is likewise.” This is the unobstructed and non­worldly gnosis of great insight, whose taste changes the obstructed aggregates, the Five spheres and so forth, into the five tathagatas, the five goddesses, and so forth as copper is changed into gold. This is the completed development of a sentient being and is, therefore, known as the master of sentient beings.146[215] The above is commentary to the verses:From desire for the great mudrá arises the unmoving bliss, the initiation of the great wisdom, from which comes the unmoving insight known as the master of sentient beings.147This root text and commentary explains that in the branch of recollection, “form arising from space” refers to an actual mother-and-father empty form, for the mother of which, in her form of Visvamátá, the yogi devel­ops desire. From his meditation experience arises the unchanging bliss of the moon-nectar bodhicitta not being emitted from the vajra jewel. This is divided into the four joys of body and so forth, and this initial unchang­ing bliss is the nonworldly fourth initiation. From this explanation it can be understood that the initial attainment of the first of the 21,600 instances of bliss, from the beginning of the branch of meditative concentration, is the lower limit of the fourth initiation.From sustained meditative development of this unchanging bliss there arises an unobstructed and nonworldly gnosis of great insight. The taste of this development completes the transformation of the five obscured aggre­gates, the five spheres, and so forth into sentient beings who are the nature of the five male and five female tathágatas and so forth, as copper is changed"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"264 Part 3: Initiationsinto gold. The fourth initiation, therefore, is known as the master of sen­tient beings.But is the nonworldly fourth identified solely with unchanging bliss? It is part of the fourth initiation and therefore is called the fourth, but the complete fourth initiation is, as explained above, the gnosis of unchanging bliss and emptiness indivisibly united with the empty form endowed with every supreme aspect. This is also the thinking of Naropa’s commentary. The previous quote continues:A presentation of the body and the yoga of the supreme and unchanging gnosis is spoken of in the Glorious Kdlacakra:“The body is of clarity, devoid of atoms, like the sky, well completed by the signs and so forth.The three worlds are free of obscuration, like appearances in a dream.“Speech is completely unbroken, in languages of many, entering the hearts of others.Mind is full of the highest bliss, unmoving, at all times embraced by the innate.”148[216] Having explained the “yoga of the supreme and unchanging gnosis” and the “body,” or enlightened form, to be the fourth initiation, Naropa states that this body and this mind of bliss, together with the way they are united, are explained in the tantra. He then quotes verse 164 of the Gno­sis chapter of the Condensed Tantra beginning, “The body is of clarity.”149 These verses are saying that when the resultant body, speech, and mind of a buddha is identified, the clear empty form, obstruction-free like space, devoid of atoms, adorned with the signs and features,150 is the body of a buddha and the unchanging bliss is the mind of a buddha. W ith this in mind Naropa quotes the above verses, beginning “The body is of clarity, devoid of atoms,” to show that the “body,” which is an empty-form gno­sis body indivisibly united with the mind of unchanging bliss inseparably absorbed into emptiness, is the fourth initiation.To summarize, the nonworldly fourth initiation begins from the achieve­ment of empty form in the aspect of mother and father in embrace indi­visibly united with the unchanging bliss-and-emptiness gnosis gained from"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The Higher-than-High Initiations 265the first moment of the branch of meditative concentration and continues up to the union of buddhahood. In this way every instance of unchanging bliss and emptiness indivisibly united with empty form can be posited as the fourth initiation. This is the thinking of the Three Bodhisattva Com­mentaries and other commentaries.The fourth initiation in the hidden tantras as explained by the mahásiddhasThe ultimate meaning of the fourth initiation is the union at the stage of no further practice where the pure illusory body is indivisibly united with the ultimate clear-light bliss-and-emptiness gnosis. This is the seven-limbed embrace. Vagisvaraklrti explains the seven limbs as follows:The complete enjoyment body, the embrace, great bliss, of no nature, filled with compassion, unending, and unceasing.151[217] These seven characteristics of the enjoyment body are: being adorned with the signs and features of enlightenment; being in the aspect of father- and-mother embrace; a great bliss that is unsullied, vast, of the highest qual­ity, and in existence for as long as samsara exists; not truly existing and therefore of no nature; filled with compassion because it is a great compas­sion that pervades all sentient beings; unending, in that its continuity is never broken; and unceasing, because although emanated bodies are unend­ing also, their appearance is transitory, whereas the appearance of the enjoy­ment body cannot possibly vanish until the destruction of space itself.This explanation of the union at the level of no further practice as being the fourth initiation is made on the basis of the primary or highest level of fourth initiation. Other than that, indivisible unions of the pure illusory body and the actual clear light at the level of the practitioner in which the clear light of the fourth stage152 arises in the form of the pure illusory body, are also nonworldly fourth initiations.It may be that the body of the union at the level of no further practice is complete with all seven features, but how is it known that this is the fourth initiation? This is established from Vagisvaraklrti’s Seven Features:Because it contains the words “like that,” because it contains the words “also,”"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"266 Part y Initiationsbecause it contains the words “likewise,”I assert the fourth to be likewise.153In some tantras this is rendered as “The fourth also is likewise”154 and bysome as “Like that, likewise the fourth also.”155 Therefore, when the fourth/ )...............initiation is taught, it is done by taking the third initiation of wisdom- knowledge as an example. In the phrase, “Like that, likewise the fourth also,” when the meanings of the individual words “like that,” “likewise,” and “also” are explained, the fourth initiation is established as possessing the seven features. Therefore “I,” Vagisvarakirti, “assert the fourth to be like­wise,” meaning “as previously explained.”This section has been a mere illustration. A more extensive explanation can be known from the Great Path o f M a n tra .{%How these two are interchangeable[218] The masters who have written on the thinking of the hidden tantras explain the fourth initiation as being the indivisibility of the pure illusory body and the actual innate bliss. The illusory body is formed from the five lights of the winds that act as the mount of the clear-light mind, while the bliss is described merely as being innate and not as unchanging bliss. In the Kalacakra the branches of withdrawal and meditative absorption produce empty forms, whose appearances continue to develop until, on the branch of recollection, an actual mother and father in embrace is created. This empty form continues to develop, and from the sixth branch of meditative concentration onward, it is produced merely within the yogi’s mind. The basis for the accomplishment of this empty form is not found in ordinary existence. Concerning the bliss, it is not sufficient for it to be merely innate, it is also explained as being “unchanging.” Therefore there are some dif­ferences in the understanding of “union” in these two systems. Never­theless, in their defining of the ultimate fourth initiation as being the indivisibility of the two bodies endowed with the seven features, there is agreement.Moreover the empty form in the aspect of the mother and father in embrace gained from the branch of meditative concentration onward can substitute for the pure illusory body in the aspect of mother and father in embrace, and the explanation of bliss-and emptiness gnosis is similar in both traditions. However, in the explanations of those masters who have"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The Higher-than-High Initiations 267commentated on the meanings of the hidden tantras, there is no mention of the 21,600 levels of unchanging bliss, nor is there any actual presentation of the mudrâ consorts that induce these levels. This is something to be investigated.Therefore the way of conferring the fourth initiation in both systems is that the meaning of the fourth initiation is communicated by words, and merely by gaining an understanding of them, the disciple is conferred with and receives the fourth initiation verbally. Furthermore the fourth initia­tion is received within the mandala of ultimate bodhicitta, subtle contam­ination of body, speech, and mind is removed, one is blessed with the great fortune to develop the body of the three indivisible vajras, and one is empowered to meditate upon the union of the completion stage.This has been just a brief and condensed presentation of the initiations."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Part 4Sadhana: M ethods o f Accom plishm ent"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Stages o f generation and completion and the results o f their practice[219] This section is under three headings:1.

Ascertaining the correct orderAscertaining the two stagesIn the glorious Kalacakra the special path to be developed is ascertained as consisting of the two stages of generation and completion. This is because those who are made into suitable vessels by the Kalacakra initiation for meditation on the paths are of two types. One type of person will aim only for the lower and middling worldly siddhis, and one type will strive for the highest siddhi of unsurpassed enlightenment. The path of practice for the first type of practitioner is ascertained to be the generation stage. For the second type, the generation stage is ascertained as being the path that ripens the practitioner for completion-stage practice. Once the mindstream has been ripened, the completion stage is ascertained as being the main cause for the attainment of the highest siddhi."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"272 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentAscertaining the correct orderIn his Five Stages, composed upon the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the master Nagarjuna said:Dwelling well within the stage of generation, wishing for the stage of completion, this method, the Buddha has said, is like the steps of a ladder.1Therefore, assuming that one is traveling by the highest path of mantra from its very beginning, there is a definite order in which one first com­pletes the generation stage, from which will arise a full completion stage. This is a definite sequence, because without ripening one’s continuum with the generation stage in order to remove the coarse outer and inner faults, a full completion stage, which brings about cessations beginning from sub­tle outer and inner faults, will not arise. [220] Particularly at the time of the completion stage, various empty forms appear, and in order to transform them into empty forms in the aspect of father and mother in embrace adorned with the signs and features, one must have first completed a gen­eration stage with attributes, which involves seeing and coming into con­tact with deities with their particular forms, numbers of hands, and faces.Some say that even on the basis of traveling by the highest path of mantra from its very beginning, it is not the case that the generation stage necessarily precedes the completion stage. If it were the case that when traveling by the highest path of mantra from its very beginning, the gen­eration stage had necessarily to precede the completion stage, then to reach enlightenment by the highest path of mantra, generation-stage meditation would definitely have to precede the completion stage. However, they say, this is not the case, because the completion of the generation stage only ensures the attainment of worldly siddhis and is not a cause for the great siddhi of enlightenment. This is so, they say, because the first summary from the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary says:By meditating on the mandalas with thoughts of form and so forth, one will attain worldly siddhis, but where is the great desired siddhi?2"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The Two Stages 273This is true, but this quote does not prove that when one enters the high­est path of mantra from the beginning of its practice, it is not necessary to meditate on the generation stage in order to attain enlightenment. These words from the commentary merely teach that fulfillment of the generation stage alone will result only in the accomplishment of worldly siddhis and not in the achievement of the highest siddhi.To this the others reply, if that is so, then it follows that having entered the highest path of mantra from its beginning, the attainment of enlight­enment is not possible by the completion stage alone without the prereq­uisite of the generation stage, because to attain enlightenment having entered the highest path of mantra from the beginning, the meditations of the generation stage are a necessary prerequisite. However it is not possi­ble, they continue, for you to agree with this, because in the first summary from the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary it says:The yoga of the completion stage,freed from the concepts of hüm , p h a t, and others,as spoken of in the generation stage,is the method for accomplishment.There is no other.3[221] Therefore, they ask, does this not mean that the yoga of the comple­tion stage, devoid of the thoughts of the conceptual meditation upon deities and of the speech of hüm , p h a t, and so forth spoken of during the genera­tion stage, is the one and only method of attaining the final goal? In reply to this, it can be said that if your explanation represents the meaning of the above passage, then you must accept the serious consequence that there is no other cause of enlightenment than the completion stage. Those who speak such things maintain that the generation stage is not a cause of the highest siddhi. This is refuted in Illum ination o f Reality, where it states that such a position is in direct contradiction to the sequence of the five chap­ters of the Kalacakra.So what do these words from the commentary mean? The verse pre­ceding the one beginning “The yoga of the completion stage” runs:The path of various concepts lacks the path of the sixteen and the four and will not arrive at the suchness spoken of by the Tathàgata.4"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"274 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment“The suchness spoken of by the Tathagata” refers to the highest siddhi, and such a goal will not be reached by the generation stage alone, for it is a “path of various concepts” of hands, faces, and so forth of the deities, and it lacks the divisions of the sixteen aspects and the four joys. So what is the primary cause of the accomplishment of the highest siddhi that can­not be attained by a path lacking the sixteen aspects and so forth? The main cause is “the yoga of the completion stage” of the six-branched yoga, divorced from spoken words such as hum and p h a t and from the concep­tual meditations taught in the generation stage. This is because the pri­mary method for the accomplishment of the highest siddhi is the completion stage, and “there is no other.”Therefore the generation stage ripens the mind for the creation of a full and complete completion stage. In this way the generation stage is a cause of buddhahood, and this is the thinking of the Three Bodhisattva Com­mentaries. The Great Commentary states on the forty-eighth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:In this way, to lead the foolish and to purify their minds, lord of men, Sucandra, teach the methods of accomplishment. Ulti­mately phenomena that are of “the essence of permanence or impermanence are not to be practiced here.” Therefore, for the accomplishment of buddhahood, “the methods to be practiced” are ascertained. Here those practices that are conceptually cre­ated methods of accomplishment are “false.” This is for all Vajradhara methods of accomplishment.5[222] The phrase “In this way, to lead the foolish and to purify their minds” refers to the practice of the generation stage as a cause of purifying the mind. The phrase “for the accomplishment of buddhahood” refers to the practices of a conceptually created method of accomplishment,6 or gener­ation stage, as causes of buddhahood, and these practices are necessary as ripening agents for the creation of the completion stage.Moreover the second chapter of the second part of the H evajra Root Tantra says:Floating like gourds upon the ocean, amid phenomena vast as space, how do sentient beings reach attainment through the forms of desired deities?"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Two Stages 275This question, asked by Vajragarbha, is answered:The Conqueror said,“Either by the yoga of no-self or by effort in glorious Heruka, wishing for siddhis, do not remain with other minds, even for an instant.”7Regarding this verse, the Vajragarbha Commentary says:Vajragarbha, it is like this. Furthermore the yogi who dwells in the beginning stages has been led into the mandala as previously taught. This is the time for the pride of deity generation. When that has been accomplished, the yogi dwells in the yoga of no­self,8 where he will without doubt become Hevajra. Therefore those who wish for siddhis should rely only upon the two stages and should not remain with other minds even for an instant.9In the beginning stages, the yogi first dwells in the apprehension of shape and color. “When that has been accomplished” or completed, “the yogi dwells in” or practices “the yoga of no-self.” These words teach that when the generation stage of the pride of deity generation has been accomplished or completed, the yogi dwells in the completion stage of no-self yoga, “where he will without doubt become Hevajra.” Therefore those who wish for the supreme siddhi of becoming Hevajra should practice only the two stages [223] “and not remain with other minds even for an instant.” Concerning the way to practice the generation stage, the commentary says:The beginner first dwells with the apprehension of the genera­tion-stage practices of deity shape and color. When the genera­tion stage has been accomplished or completed, he practices the completion stage of no-self yoga.These words teach the generation stage as a ripening agent for the creation of a fully endowed completion stage, thereby clearly illustrating the order of these two stages. Immediately following the above passage, the Vajra­garbha Commentary continues:"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"2 y6 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentFrom that the fortunate one completes the yoga of generation and develops the withdrawal process of the first of the six branches of perfect wisdom, known as withdrawal. From this will arise the signs.10This passage explains that the fortunate meditator completes the generation stage and practices the branch of withdrawal, the first yoga of the six- branched yoga, from which will arise the signs of smoke and so forth. Therefore this passage also clearly lays out the order of the generation and completion stages.These teachings on the order of the two stages are mainly given on the basis of someone who enters the highest path of tantra right from its begin­ning. A practitioner who has become a “last-existence,” tenth-level bodhi- sattva by the path of sutra and then enters tantra does not need to travel through the generation stage before embarking on the completion stage for enlightenment. Such examples are exceptions.It may be asked if a “last-existence,” tenth-level bodhisattva has to enter the highest path of tantra in order to reach buddhahood, is enlightenment through the sutra path alone not possible? Such a thought is not only the opinion of the Guhyasamaja and others but also of the Kalacakra and its commentaries. The Great Commentary in the sixth summary of the Realms chapter says [224]:Therefore those who do not know the Supreme Original Buddha do not know the Sam gltiP Those not knowing the Sam glti will not know the gnosis body of Vajradhara. Those who do not know the gnosis body of Vajradhara do know the Vajra Vehi­cle. All those not knowing the Vajra Vehicle are of samsara, bereft of the path of the conqueror Vajradhara.12"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"e Generation StagePresentations of each stageThis is under two main outlines:1.

These include pleasant groves for the feats of gaining power and of summoning; mountains for the feats of stupefying, paralyzing, and stabbing; shrines blessed by the Conqueror for the eight siddhis; empty temples and the sides of the ocean for the feats of expelling and separating; the places of great practitioners for the siddhis of activity mudra consorts; cemeteries for the secret practices; by lakes and places of beauty, meaning rich and expansive, for the two siddhis of peace and increase; and hidden places, meaning caves or mud huts, for the feat of ruling over the three worlds. [225] These places are mentioned on the basis of being conducive to the attainment of tantric powers.14 These places all have common requirements, which are mentioned in a verse from the Great Commentary:A place of dharma, where inhabitants live in peace, a place free of strife, there the yogi practices.15In such a place, seated on soft bedding, one should practice the yoga of the generation stage, which will be explained later.The meditatorThe meditator should be one who has received the seven childhood initi­ations, as previously explained and who abides by the vows and samaya pledges.The purpose of the meditationThe common disciples of the Kalacakra meditate in order to attain the worldly siddhis, such as those of peace and increase, as well as the eight great siddhi. The primary disciples of the Kalacakra meditate in order to attain the highest siddhi of enlightenment by suppressing the coarse impu­rity of the inner and outer bases of purification with generation-stage prac­tices and by regarding this stage as a ripening agent for the creation of a fully endowed completion stage, which has the power of complete and total purification."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The Generation Stage 279“One first recites the protection.” As this line says, the yogi performs a pre­liminary meditation on the protection wheel, as taught in the Realms chap­ter, then engages in practices that begin from the merit-field visualization as taught in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, and finishes with the final requests at the end of the session.The main features of Mantra Vehicle that distinguish it from the Sutra Vehicle are the practices of the five perfections,16 whose aspects are repli­cated and meditated upon, from the time of practice onward, to produce similar-type causes of an enlightened form body. These five, which will be present at the final result of practice, are one's environment as a celestial palace, one’s body as a form adorned with the signs and features of enlight­enment, one’s enjoyments as undefiled bliss, one’s entourage as buddhas and bodhisattvas in the forms of gods and goddesses, and one’s deeds and actions performed by light rays emitting from one’s body to bring all sen­tient beings to buddhahood. [226] This “path of the result” is present in all four classes of tantra, but deity yoga correlating to the birth and destruc­tion bases of purification within samsara together with a generation stage that becomes a ripening process for the creation of a completion stage is only found in highest yoga tantra. Therefore the generation stage discussed here must be one endowed with these two characteristics.This tantra talks of the correlation of the Inner, Outer, and Other, as well as giving a very extensive presentation of deity yoga. The main reason for this is that the Inner and Outer are the bases of purification while the Other is the purifier. By meditating on the Other in its aspect of the gen­eration stage and correlating it to inner and outer bases of purification, one’s mindstream is ripened, and by accomplishing and completing the meditations on the Other in its aspect of the completion stage, every imprint that arises in the form of the impure appearances of the Outer and Inner is removed, and the yogi becomes the Other, or resultant Kalacakra, whose nature is the four bodies. Furthermore the more extensive a presen­tation of deity yoga, the more fruitful will be the purification of the Outer and Inner, and the more fruitful will be the development of a generation stage as a ripening agent for the creation of a completion stage. It is with this in mind that the deity yoga of the generation stage in this tantra is so extensive. If that were not the case, then what other reason would there be for such an extensive presentation of the deities and mandalas?The way to meditate"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"280 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThe way that such a generation stage simulates the processes of birth and destruction within samsara is as follows. The primary disciples of high­est mantra in general and the primary disciples of this tantra specifically, are those of the highest intelligence who, as human beings of this world of Jambudvlpa, are endowed with the six elements and possess a form for the attainment of enlightenment within one life by the practices of the gener­ation stage and the six-branched yoga of the completion stage, the main topics of this tantra. This is stated very clearly in the tantra and in the Great Commentary. Therefore, when determining the Inner, one is primarily determining the birth and death of a womb-born human being of this world. Similarly the generation stage is a meditation simulating the processes of birth and destruction of such a human being. [227]Therefore the way of meditating upon the generation stage is under two main headings:1. Gathering the two kinds of accumulations, which correlates with the death process that occurs at the end of gathering of merit2.

The merit field of the Kalacakra mandalas and deities are invited, and the seven-limbed practice and other rites as taught in the commentaries are performed. This correlates with the gathering of good karma as a cause for birth in the future life.Accumulation of wisdom by meditating upon the four gateways to freedom, correlating with deathThis practice, which correlates with death, is the accumulation of wisdom by meditating upon the four gateways to freedom. The meditations upon the four gateways to freedom are deity yoga meditations involving the dependent deities and supporting mandalas, which will be explained later, arising as the play of meditative concentration of bliss and emptiness. This is a meditation that correlates with the death process for a human endowed with the six elements. The death process of a human endowed with the six"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"282 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentelements is the actual object of correlation and is described in the Great Commentary:At the time of death of those born from a womb in this human world, water weakens fire.17And further:Then, because of there being no fire, earth loses its solidity and dissolves like salt to become liquid, dwelling within the water element. Then the element of air dries up every drop of water and disappears into space. Like this the elements quickly weaken. Then “the mind is the fire at the end of darkness,”18 which means that the foundation consciousness is placed in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms empty of all objects, dwelling in the middle.19These quotes are referring to the dying process in which first the water ele­ment of the body weakens the fire element. Then water dissolves earth, air dries up water, and air itself disappears. [228] “The mind is the fire at the end of darkness \"refers to the end of the process of near-attainment,20 when a clear light in its state of clear vacuity arises, and in which various aspected empty forms appear. This is death clear light and is an object of correlation with the above meditation.This explanation differs from the explanation given by the Guhyasamaja tradition of Nagarjuna and his disciples on the order of dissolution and on the objects appearing within the death clear light. Such a difference must be attributed to a difference in the stages of the death process of the pri­mary disciples of the tantras. This has already been dealt with in the Inner chapter.The meditations of the four gateways to freedom correlating with this death process are taught in the Great Commentary, beginning, “Therefore, through the power of this meditative concentration, the process of fire is weakened by water, and this is the meditator’s21 first practice within the body.” As quoted above, the passage continues from “Then because of there being no fire” up to “empty of all objects.” Therefore, in the vacuity that is the indivisibility of the great-bliss gnosis and the emptiness of the four gateways, an empty form like an image in a prognostic mirror is to be"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The Two Accumulations 283visualized. The necessity of visualizing this empty form in the aspect of an image in a prognostic mirror can be found in the line “the foundation con­sciousness is placed in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms empty of all objects, dwelling in the middle.” This means a fully aspected empty form devoid of all objects of materiality is visualized as indivisible from the four-gateway emptiness “dwelling in the middle,” meaning divorced from the extremes of existence and nonexistence, and this visualization is a med­itative equipoise in conjunction with the death clear light and goes under the name foundation consciousness.If those words of the Great Commentary meant that the gnosis indivisi­ble from the emptiness of the four gateways to freedom was itself to be visualized in the aspect of empty form, it would follow that this meditation could not become a path that takes on the aspect of the dharmakâya, and neither could it be a means for the practice of accumulating wisdom.But doesn’t this contradict the two phrases “meditate upon them as empty forms beyond the reality of matter” and “in the realm of space, in fully aspected forms”? [229] They do not because of the following reason. “Form” in Sanskrit is rüpa, which has the meaning of both “form” and “nature.” Here it should have been translated as “nature.” “Form” is a mis­translation. This is a query and resolution that has been spoken of before.22 It should be discussed a little. It is perfectly acceptable to translate rüpa in this way,23 but that meaning is not to be applied to the phrases “devoid of all aspects” and “emptiness beyond the nature of matter,” when used many times as synonyms of empty form in other places. Therefore, in the Shong and other translations, rüpa is often translated as “form.”24However it is not contradictory here to also practice taking on the aspects of the dharmakâya, and so forth, because the teaching here on med­itations of the four gateways to freedom must teach a correlation with the basic death process of a womb-born human as well as with the resultant dharmakâya. The former has been explained. Correlation with the latter is that unchanging bliss in the aspect of a prognostic-mirror-image empty form, and indivisible from the emptiness in which not even an atom of existence exists from in its own side, is the ultimate gnosis of the dharma­kâya. On this subject of correlation the Great Commentary says:The three realms of animate and inanimate are to be examinedwith this verse: “There is no meditation upon no phenomena.. .”25"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"284 Part 4: Sddhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThis and the remaining lines of the verse mean that all phenomena, com­prising the three realms of animate sentient beings and the inanimate world, are examined using ultimate reasoning, which determines that phe­nomena, although functioning under the process of cause and effect, have no nature. This is expressed as the four gateways to freedom— namely, being empty, without attributes, without aspiration, without engage­ment— and is single-pointedly concentrated upon. From within this state great bliss arises, and while this bliss is perceiving emptiness, one medi­tates on various visualized prognostic-mirror-like empty forms."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"e Body VajraThe yoga o f four branches, correlating with the after-death process o f linking up to a new birth and taking a body[zjo] This is under four headings:I.

The med­itation on the stacking of the mandalas of air and so forth within the source triangle correlates with the four mandalas from air up to earth. [231] The meditation on Meru as mentioned in the line “Upon the earth mandala, Meru, the nature of the vajra” correlates with the external Meru. The med­itation on a variegated lotus upon Meru correlates with the center of Meru. The meditation on the sun, moon, and Rahu in the center of the lotus cor­relates with the sun, moon, and Rahu gathering externally at the end of the day of the empty sky.27All phenomena from the source triangle up to Rahu are visualized as blending into one and meditated upon as the seed syllables ham ksa ma la wa raya. Although the objects of both outer and inner correlation of this stacked meditative arrangement are separate from each other, this blending into one is to show that the one gnosis of Kalacakra manifests as the stacked arrangements of the foundation below the celestial mansion.

These preceding and succeeding med­itations on space, air, fire, water, earth, Meru, lotus, moon, sun, and Rahu are taught by the Great Commentary.

However it is still ascertained as being a four-cubit mansion of the mandalas themselves. The mandalas or celestial mansion of complete body, speech, and mind mandalas to be meditated upon can be visualized as being of any size, but they still represent a four-cubit mandala system of the celestial mansion. The body mandala, therefore, is four cubits square. This corre­lates with the outer air mandala, which has a diameter of 400,000 yojana. [232] The speech mandala, which is half the size of the body mandala at two cubits, correlates with the water mandala, which has a diameter of 200,000 yojana from rim to rim. The mind mandala, which at one cubit square is half the size of the speech mandala, correlates with the 100,00 yojana of the earth mandala’s diameter. The wheel of great bliss is twelve fingerwidths and half the size of the mind mandala, correlating with the 50,000-yojana diameter of the summit of Meru. The six-fingerwidth diameter of the lotus seat of the main deities is half the diameter of the wheel of great bliss and correlates with the 25,000-yojana diameter of the center of Meru.31 The stacked arrangement of the moon, sun, and Rahu upon the lotus, forming the seat of the main deities, correlates with the moon, sun, and Rahu stacked at the end of the day of the empty sky.Correlation with the mother's body where womb conception takes placeThe two meditations explained above, involving the phenomena of the source triangle of limitless space up to Rahu, correlate simultaneously with phenomena within the mothers body.

The sun mandaia visualized beneath the moon and marked with the eighty consonants correlates with the mother’s blood at conception. The meditation on the syllable hum resting in the center of the moon, like the sign of a rabbit, from which arises a vajra marked by the syllable hum, cor­relates with the bardo consciousness entering the blood and fluid. The syl­lable h i visualized at the same time correlates with the wind acting as the mount of the bardo consciousness. The meditation involving the vowels, consonants, moon, sun, vajra, merging together as one into the syllables hum and ham, from which arises the complete form endowed with the syl­lable ham, correlates with the fluid, blood, consciousness, and its mount of wind blending together to produce the first signs of a body in the womb.Correlation with the practitioner's bodyThe body mandaia correlates with the area of the body stretching from the heart down to the secret area and from the heart up to the crown. The speech mandaia correlates with a body area ranging from the navel to the throat. The mind mandaia reaches down from the heart halfway to the navel and up halfway to the throat.Alternatively the mind mandaia, speech mandaia, and body mandaia correlate respectively with the area from the heart out to both shoulders, the area from the heart out to the elbows, and the area from the heart to the left and right fingertips.How the generation of the dependent deities correlates with the ordinary base[234] This has two outlines:1.

The male and female tathagatas and so forth correlating with the remaining period of growth in the wombThe generation of the main mother-and-father deity, the sakti, and the direction vases correlating with the first three months in the wombThe moon marked by the thirty-two vowels, which have the nature of the thirty-two physical signs, is the manifest enlightenment of the mirrorlike gnosis. The sun marked by the eighty consonants, which have the nature of the eighty physical marks, is the manifest enlightenment of the gnosis of equality. The vajra marked by hum, arising from a hum syllable upon the moon disk, is the manifest enlightenment of the gnosis of analysis. The syllable hi, coexisting with the hum, is the manifest enlightenment of the wisdom of accomplishment. The fusion of these to produce the compete form endowed with the syllable ham is the manifest enlightenment of the wisdom of reality. These are the five manifest enlightenments from which the main deity, the conqueror Kalacakra, is formed. That moment until the generation of the emblems is a time correlating with the first three months of development in the womb, known as the months of ignorance, volition, and consciousness.The ways that various parts of the body of the main deity correlate with outer and inner phenomena are as follows. The single body correlates with a single inner solar day of twelve lagna32 wind movements and outwardly to a single year. The two feet of Kalacakra correlate inwardly with the two sets of six lagna wind movements and outwardly to the passing of the two sets of six months. Three throats correlate inwardly with three sets of four lagna wind movements and outwardly with the three sets of four months in a year. Four faces correlate inwardly with four sets of three lagna wind move­ments and outwardly with the four sets of three months in a year. The six shoulders that stretch from the east to the west correlate inwardly with the six sets of two lagna wind movements and outwardly with the six sets of two months in a year. The twelve upper arms correlate inwardly with the twelve lagna wind movements and outwardly with the twelve months of a year. Twenty-four lower arms correlate inwardly with twenty-four half lagna wind movements and outwardly with twenty-four half months in a year. The 360 joints of the fingers correlate internally with the 360 breaths that make up 1/60 of the 21,600 breaths of one day. Externally they correlate with the"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"290 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment360 days of a year.33 [235] There are 360 joints because each of the twenty- four hands has five fingers and each of the fingers has three joints.By meditating upon the correlation of the parts of the Kalacakra body with inner and outer phenomena, the mind becomes ripe for the creation of a completion-stage practice that will actually render these two bases free of obscuration. The completion-stage practice produces the resultant Kalacakra body, which is meditated upon at this point of practice and whose divisions or parts are the purified aspects of the inner and outer years, months, days, and their constituent parts as mentioned above. There­fore the feet of Kalacakra that are meditated upon at this point of practice, and that stand in a position of sport or play upon the terrified forms of Mara and Rudra, are the feet of resultant Kalacakra. One foot stands upon the four maras— the aggregates, afflictions, death, and the desire god Kama— and the other upon the attachment, resentment, ignorance, pride, and jealousy symbolized by Rudra. The two feet symbolize the actualiza­tion of nondwelling nirvana, in which samsara and nirvana are as one.These features of the body also illustrate how the yoga of the completion stage is produced from this ripening of the mindstream. The deity seats comprising the moon, sun, and Kalagni illustrate the right, left, and central channels, which are areas of penetrative focusing within the completion stage. The conch and Rudra on the Kalagni seat illustrate the breath flow­ing from the left and right channels. The right leg extended in a position of sport and standing upon the moon, sun, and Kalagni, with its conch and Rudra, illustrates the winds of the right and left channels and the red and white bodhicitta flowing into and held in the central channel. The winds and red and white bodhicitta held in the central channel causes the white bod­hicitta to stabilize at the crown, which is symbolized by the white and bent left leg. The red bodhicitta stabilized at the tip of the jewel is illustrated by the extended red right leg. W ith the white and red bodhicitta stabilizing at the crown and the jewel, the consciousness transforms into supreme and unchanging bliss, and this is symbolized by the body of Kalacakra being blue from the top of the thighs upward. The supreme and unchanging bliss is actually induced by the yoga of recollection, where an empty form in the aspect of father-and-mother embrace arises. [236] This is illustrated by the conqueror Kalacakra embraced by Vis'vamata in father-and-mother union.From the perfection of these completion-stage yogas comes the resultant Kalacakra body, and the purified phenomena, as illustrated by the different parts of this body, will be the inner and outer time divisions explained above."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The Body Vajra 291The male and female tathagatas and so forth correlating with the remaining period of growth in the wombThis has four points:1. The male and female tathagatas and the five wrathful guardians correlate with the increase in the womb during the fourth, or name-and-form, month of growthAfter the generation of the s'akti goddesses, vases, and emblems, the princi­pal deity emanates Aksobhya and consort, which then enter the principal deity’s body. Then Vajradhatvlsvarl embraced by Vajrasattva is emanated and enters the consort Visvamata’s body. Then the four male and four female tathagatas and the five wrathful guardians are generated. This process correlates with the growth of the body within the womb during the time of the fourth month, known as name-and-form month.2. The generation of the male and female bodhisattvas correlates with the expansion of the womb during the fifth and sixth, or six sources and contact, monthsAfter the five wrathful guardians have been generated, Khagarbha and the other five male bodhisattvas with consorts are generated. Spars'avajra and the other female bodhisattvas with their consorts are also generated. This process correlates with the expansion of the body in the womb during the fifth, or six sources, month and the sixth, or contact, month. The six sources begin their development in the fifth month and are completed in the sixth.This does not mean that a particular generation of a celestial figure cor­relates only with a particular development within the womb.

From the six purified inner sources of con­sciousness arise these six male bodhisattvas. Similarly Sabdavajra, Spars'avajra, Rasavajra, Rupavajra, Gandhavajra, and Dharmadhatuvajra correlate with and purify the six basic outer sources of sound, tangibles, taste, form, smell, and mental phenomena. From the six purified outer sources will come the above six female bodhisattvas.3. The generation of the speech-mandala yoginis correlates with the growth in the womb during the seventh, or feeling, monthAfter the figures of the mind mandala have been generated, the seventy-two yoginis of the speech mandala, such as Carcika and so forth, are generated. This process correlates with the growth in the womb seven months after conception during the feelings month. Furthermore the seventy-two god­desses of the speech mandala correlate with the sixty-four channel petals of the navel channel plus the eight channel petals on the second rim of the throat cakra, which have split off and doubled from the first four petals of that cakra. These seventy-two channel petals and seventy-two goddesses are phenomena to be purified and purifiers respectively. From the purified channel petals come the seventy-two goddesses. [238] This correlation is due to the speech mandala itself correlating with the square area formed between the throat and the navel.4. The generation of the 360 lunar-day deities correlates with growth in the womb during the eighth, or grasping, monthAfter the emanation of the speech-mandala yoginis, the 360 deities of the lunar days are generated within the body mandala. They correlate with the growth of the body within the womb during the period of the eighth month after conception. These 360 deities of the days also correlate with the channels of the action-faculty cakras, as opposed to the activity wheels, found within the hands and feet. O n each of the twelve major limb joints, there are thirty channels. O f these, twenty-eight channels correlate with the twenty-eight entourage deities of the days. The two remaining channel"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The Body Vajra 293petals correlate with the main deities in father-and-mother aspect in the center of the lotus. The 360 deities also correlate with the 360 lunar days34 of an external year. The inner and outer phenomena of the channels and lunar days are the basic phenomena to be purified. The deities of the lunar days are the purifiers. From the purified outer and inner lunar days and from the purified channels come the 360 deities of the days.The major joints of arm and leg comprise one joint between shoulder and upper arm, one between upper and lower arm, and one between lower arm and hand, making six joints on the arms. O n the legs there is a joint between the hip and the thigh, between the thigh and the lower leg, and between the lower leg and the foot, making six joints on the legs. These twelve major joints are known as action-faculty cakras. The reason is that these major joints are action faculties that initiate activities. Similarly the sixty joints of the twenty digits of hands and feet are known as activity cakras, because the joints of hands and feet engage in the activities of taking, going, and so forth. Each of twenty digits of the hands and legs has three joints, and each joint has six channels, to make a total of 360. These channels correlate with the deities of the days and are the basic phenomena to be purified by them. The deities of the lunar days are the purified channels.The correlation between purifier and phenomena to be purified can be broken down in more detail. [239] The thirty deities of the lunar month Caitra correlate with the thirty channels of the cakra on the joint between the left upper arm and lower arm. The five joints from the middle joint of the little finger of the left hand to the middle joint of the left thumb each contain six channels, and the thirty deities of Caitra also correlate with these thirty channels.There is a similar correlation between the lunar-day deities of the month of Vaisakha and the thirty channels of the cakra between the right lower arm and right hand, as well as the thirty channels comprising the six chan­nels on each of the joints from the upper joint of the right thumb to the upper joint of the right little finger. The lunar-day deities of the month of Jyestha correlate with the thirty channels of the cakra on the joint between the left lower arm and the left hand, as well as with the thirty channels of the five upper joints from the left little finger to the left thumb. The lunar- day deities of the month of Asadha correlate with the thirty channels of the cakra on the joint between the right hip and right thigh, as well as with the thirty channels of the lower joints from the big toe to the little toe of the right foot.

The lunar-day deities of the month of Bhadra correlate with the channels of the joint between the thigh and the calf of the right leg, as well as with the thirty channels of the middle toe joints that run from the big toe to the little toe of the right foot. The lunar deities of the month of AsvinI correlate with the channels of the joint between the thigh and the calf of the left leg, and with the channels that run across the left foot from the middle joint of the little toe to the middle joint of the big toe. The lunar-day deities of the month of Karttika correlate with the channels of the joint between the calf and foot of the right leg, and with the channels of the upper joints of the toes of the right foot from the big toe to the little. The lunar-day deities of the month of Mrigas'ira correlate with the chan­nels of the joint that lies between the calf and the foot of the left leg, and with those that run across the left foot from the upper joint of the little toe to the upper joint of the big toe. The lunar-day deities of Pusya correlate with the channels of the joint between the right shoulder and right upper arm, and with those of the lower joints that stretch from the thumb to the little finger of the right hand. The lunar-day deities of Magha correlate with the channels of the joint between the left shoulder and left upper arm, and with the channels of the bottom joints of the fingers of the left hand running from the little finger to the thumb. [240] The lunar-day deities of Phalguna correlate with the channels of the joint between the right upper and lower arm, and with the channels of the middle finger joints that run from the thumb to the little finger of the right hand.As explained previously, the correlation between the deities and channels above is one of purifier and phenomenon to be purified, and the above lunar-day deities are the purified forms of the channels. The following doubt can arise here. Surely there is agreement on the channels to be puri­fied and the lunar-day deities that purify them, as well as which deities are of which months? However the Methods of Accomplishment chapter explains that the ca consonant group with short vowels enter and emerge from the winds in reverse order to create the lunar-day deities of Caitra and that the Vais'akha lunar-day deities emerge from the winds in forward order from the ca group of consonants with the five long vowels plus the visarga?'* This contrasts with the Great Commentary on the sixty-seventh verse of the Inner chapter, which says:"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Body Vajra 295Similarly on the joint of the right lower arm are the channels of Caitra, and on the joint of the left lower arm are the channels of Vais'akha.36This quote, which continues with extensive explanation, says that the lunar days of Caitra are to be applied to the channels of the right upper and lower arm joint, and that the lunar days of Vais'akha are to be applied to the chan­nels of the joint between the left upper and lower arm. It also states that the Caitra lunar-day seed syllables are of the ca consonant group, with five long vowels plus the visarga, and that they enter the winds in forward order, and that the Vaisakha lunar-day seed syllables are of the ca consonant group with five short vowels plus the anusvdra,37 and that they enter the winds in reverse order. How can these two not be contradictory? This is a very valid doubt, and the reason why it is not contradictory will be well explained.First of all, understand this. The thirty zodiacal days from when the mean sun enters the house of Aries until it enters the house of Taurus are to be applied to the thirty channels of the left elbow joint. Similarly the days of Taurus are applied to the channels of the right wrist joint. The days of Gem­ini are applied to the channels of the left wrist joint. [241] The days of Can­cer are applied to the channels of the right hip joint. The days of Leo are applied to the channels of the left hip joint. The days of Virgo are applied to the channels of the right knee joint. The days of Libra are applied to the channels of the left knee joint. The days of Scorpio are applied to the chan­nels of the right ankle joint. The days of Sagittarius are applied to the chan­nels of the left ankle joint. The days of Capricorn are applied to the channels of the right shoulder joint. The days of Aquarius are applied to the channels of the left shoulder joint. The thirty zodiacal days of the mean sun entering the house of Pisces are applied to the thirty channels of the right elbow joint.How that is taught in the Great Commentary can be found in its text on the sixty-seventh verse of the Inner chapter of the Condensed Tantra:Among them, on the joint of the right shoulder and upper arm, are the thirty channels of the thirty-day division of Capricorn.38This teaches that the thirty zodiacal days of Capricorn are to be applied to the channels of the right shoulder joint. The Great Commentary continues on the sixty-eighth verse:"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"296 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThe divisions of days of Magha and the passage of Capri­corn...39Thus the house of Capricorn and Magha are linked. On the same verse, the Great Commentary continues:Here Phalguna and the passage of Aquarius are the thirty chan­nels of the faculty cakra of the joint between the left shoulder and upper arm.40Thus the house of Aquarius and the month Phalguna are paired, and both are applied to the left shoulder joint. Similarly the house of Pisces is paired with Caitra, Ajries with Vais'akha, Taurus with Jyestha, Gemini with Asadha, Cancer with Sravana, Leo with Bhadra, Virgo with Asvini, Libra with Karttika, Scorpio with Mriga&ra, and Sagittarius with Pusya. More­over the Great Commentary continues on the sixty-seventh verse:On the joint of the left shoulder and upper arm are the thirty channels of the thirty-day division of Phalguna.41The text continues, “Caitra is on the right upper arm joint,” “Vais'akha is on the joint of the left upper arm,” [242] “Jyestha is on the joint of the right lower arm and hand,” “Asadha is on the joint of the left lower arm and hand,” “Sravana is on the joint of the right hip and thigh,” “Bhadra is on the joint of the left hip and thigh,” “Asvini is on the joint of the right thigh and calf,” “Karttika is on the joint of the left thigh and calf,” “Mrigas'ira is on the joint of the right calf and foot,” and “on the joint of the left foot and calf are thirty channels of the nature of the thirty days of Pusya.”If the earlier and later passages from the Great Commentary on the pair­ing of zodiacal months and lunar months42 are compared, it can be seen that they verify the way the houses linked with the channels of the twelve major joints of the arms and legs have been explained here. This can be taken as a basis. Lunar months are either waxing or waning-led.43 On the basis of being waning-led, the way that lunar months and zodiac months are paired is that the house of Aries is paired with Vais'akha and so forth, as taught by the Great Commentary above. When that occurs, it is taught that the ca consonant group with the five short vowels plus the anusvdra enter the winds in reverse order as the seed syllables of the zodiacal days of Aries, and"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The Body Vajra 297that these same seed syllables are those of the lunar-day deities of Vais'akha. Similarly the seed syllables of the zodiacal days of Pisces are explained as those of the ca consonant group with the five long vowels plus the visarga entering the winds in forward order, while the same syllables are those of the lunar-day deities of Caitra.But isn’t it possible to ascertain definitive sets of seed syllables for the lunar days and zodiacal days? There are no fixed seed syllables. The expla­nations from the sixty-seventh verse of the Inner chapter describe the seed syllables of the days belonging to the period of the gradual disintegration of the channels that begins three years and three months before the timely end of a hundred-year life. As this channel disintegration is a sign of oncoming death, it is a disintegration brought on by the elements gradu­ally withdrawing. The consonants disappear beginning with the ka group, and from the major joints of the arms and legs, [243] the channels of the right shoulder and upper arm joint are the first to die, followed by those of the left shoulder joint, those of the right elbow joint, and so on, alter­nating right and left as far as the channels of the left ankle.The channels of the joints on the right arm and leg are those of wis­dom. In the process of dying, their seed-syllable consonants are therefore stacked, the consonant groups are in forward order, and they enter the winds with the long vowels plus visarga in reverse order. The channels of the left arm and leg are method channels, and the consonant groups there­fore are single, in reverse order, and they enter the winds with the short vowels plus anusvdra in forward order.This can be illustrated with an example. The stacked syllables k k d h , k k l i h k k d y k k i y k k d y k k r i , k k i , k k o , together with the same vowels on each the con­sonants kha, ga, gha, and ha to make thirty syllables in total, are applied to the thirty channels of the right shoulder joint. Likewise, on the channels of the left shoulder joint are the single syllables ha, h i , h r i , hu, h l i , and ham plus similar groups made up of the consonants gha, ga, kha, and ka, to make thirty in total. On the channels of the right elbow joint are the long-vowel stacked consonants of the ca group. On those of the left elbow joint are the short-vowel single syllables of the ca group. On the channels of the right wrist joint are the long stacked ta group syllables. On the channels of the left wrist joint are short single syllables of the ta group. On the channels of the right hip joint are the long stacked syllables of the pa group. On those of the left hip joint are the short single p a group syllables. On the channels of the right knee joint are the long stacked syllables of the ta group. On those of"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"298 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentthe left knee joint are the short single ta group syllables. On the channels of the right ankle joint are the long stacked syllables of the sa group, while on those of the left ankle joint are the short single sa group syllables.The commentary from the sixty-seventh verse of the Inner chapter is in the context of channel dissolution at the end of a completed life44 and also in the context of the houses being applied to a waning-led month. There­fore the lunar deities of Vais'akha are assigned to the ca group of consonants entering the winds in reverse order and with short vowels plus anusvara in forward order. [244] The lunar deities of Caitra are assigned to the ca group of consonants entering the winds in forward order with long vowels plus visarga in reverse order.The first channels of the action-faculty cakras to die at the end of a com­pleted life are those of the right shoulder joint. O f the consonant groups the first is the ka group. Death is a withdrawal process, and so the conso­nants of the elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space are of the ka group in forward order, while the five vowels of those elements beginning with li are in reverse order. Finally the visarga of the gnosis element sinks into the winds. When the houses are assigned to a waning-led lunar month, the syllables of the channels, house days, and lunar months are as explained above. However the explanation of the lunar-day deity emanation taught in this section of the text is different. So what is the difference? The lunar- day deity emanation as taught in this part of the text begins with the ema­nation of the lunar-day deities of Caitra. They emanate in the creation order of the elements, which are in a state of inactive absorption, as space, air, fire, water, and earth, respectively. The houses also are assigned to a waxing-led month. Those are the differences.The thirty days of the house of Aries, the thirty lunar days of a waxing- led Caitra, the thirty channels of the left upper and lower arm joint, and the thirty channels in five groups of six from the middle joint of the left lit­tle finger to the middle joint of the left thumb are those of the air element. Its syllable group, therefore, is ca. Because this process begins with the cre­ation of the elements, the ca group is in reverse order. Between method and wisdom it belongs to the method sphere, and its vowels—a, i, ri, u, li, am— therefore are short and in forward order.Similarly the thirty house days of Taurus, the thirty lunar days of the waxing-led Vaisakha, the thirty channels of the action-faculty cakra of the joint between right lower arm and hand, the thirty activity-wheel chan­nels in five groups of six on the upper joints of the right hand running"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The Body Vajra 299from the thumb to the little finger, are also of the air element and are assigned to the ca syllable group. [245] The elements on the right of the body, of the wisdom sphere, begin from the withdrawal process, and the ca consonant group, therefore, is in forward order. The vowels, plus visarga, are long and in reverse order.From this example, therefore, one can know that the zodiacal days, the lunar days of a waxing-led month, the channels of action-faculty cakra and activity-cakra joints, and the consonant groups assigned to the left are all in reverse order, whereas those assigned to the right are in forward order. On the consonants in reverse order, the vowels are short, while the conso­nants in forward order have long vowels.O f the houses in this section, Aries is first. O f the lunar months Caitra is first. O f the consonant groups the ca group is first. O f the withdrawal and creation of the elements, creation comes first. O f the vowels the short vow­els come first. O f the channels of the action faculty cakras situated at the joints, the channels of the left upper and lower arm joint are first. O f the activity-cakra channels, those spread across the middle joints of the left hand from the little finger to the thumb are first. After this group comes Taurus and the other houses and Vais'akha and the other lunar months.The lunar months and zodiacal months are assigned to the consonant groups from ca to ka. On the odd-numbered houses and months, the con­sonants enter the winds in reverse order with short vowels in forward order. On the even-numbered houses and months, the consonants enter the winds in forward order with long vowels in reverse order. This is not difficult to understand.Concerning the sequence of the channels for the various correlations, those of the left elbow joint are followed by those of the right wrist joint. Then come those of the left wrist joint, followed by the right hip joint, the left hip joint, the right knee joint, the left knee joint, [246] the right ankle joint, the left ankle joint, the right shoulder joint, the left shoulder joint, and the right elbow joint.When correlation is made in this order, the channels on the left, start­ing from those of the left shoulder joint to those of the left ankle joint, are assigned the odd-numbered houses of Aquarius, Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, and Sagittarius, respectively, as well the odd-numbered lunar months of Magha, Caitra, Jyestha, Sravana, As'vini, and Mrigasira. The consonant groups on the left run from ka to sa and enter the winds in reverse order with short vowels in forward order."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"300 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThe joint channels on the right run from those of the right elbow joint, down to those of the ankle and up to the channels of the right shoulder joint. They host the even-numbered houses of Pisces, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, and Capricorn, as well as the even-numbered lunar months of Phalguna, Vaisakha, Asadha, Bhadra, Karttika, and Pusya. The conso­nant groups run from ka to sa and enter the winds in forward order with long vowels in reverse order.Also, when the lunar-day deities emanate, the order of emanation is from Caitra to Phalguna. The lunar-day deities of the odd-numbered months emanate from their respective consonant groups that have entered the winds in reverse order with short vowels in forward order. Those of the even- numbered months emanate from their respective consonant groups that have entered the winds in forward order with long vowels in reverse order.The reasons for the above are as follows. The left channel is the chan­nel of seminal fluid and of the moon. Similarly the channels of the action- faculty cakras and activity cakras on the left, the odd-numbered houses, the odd-numbered months, and the lunar-day deities of the odd-num­bered months are all moon and seminal fluid phenomena. Between method and wisdom they belong to the realm of method, and so their individual seed-syllable consonant groups enter the winds in reverse order with short vowels in forward order. [247] Also the elements correlating with these channels and other phenomena through to the lunar-day deities are in their creation order of space, air, fire, water, and earth. In terms of the major ele­ments, ka is space, ca is air, ta is fire, p a is water, ta is earth, and sa is gno­sis. In terms of the minor elements, ha is the space of space, gha is the air of space, ga is the fire of space, kha is the water of space, and ka is the earth of space. Likewise the sequence runs from ha as the space of air to ca as the earth of air. N a is the space of fire, and so on, to ta being the earth of fire. M a is the space of water, continuing on to p a as the earth of water. N a is the space of earth, continuing on to ta as the earth of earth. Ksa is the space of gnosis, continuing in sequence to sa as the earth of gnosis.In terms of the major elements, the channels of the action-faculty cakras on the left elbow joint and those on the right wrist joint, the channels of the activity cakras on the middle joints of the left fingers and those on the upper joints of the right fingers, the two houses Aries and Taurus, the lunar months Caitra and Vais'akha, and the lunar deities Raksa plus entourage and Vayu plus entourage, are all of the element air.

Therefore the consonant groups enter the winds in reverse order, while the vowels are in the order of space, air, fire, water, earth, and gnosis, entering in forward order.The houses, lunar months, and lunar-day deities applied to the channels on the right are the phenomena of blood and sun, and therefore are of the sphere of wisdom. [248] The arrangement of the seed syllables, the with­drawal order of the major and minor elements, and the length of the vow­els, which are long because wisdom is twice that of method, can all be known by referring to the above explanations.In the Inner chapter and Realms chapter it is explained that because wisdom is twice the length of method, the consonants are also written as stacked doubles. However, here in this section, the generation of the lunar- day deities is assigned to the bright half of the month and their growth to the dark half. Therefore the lunar days compared to the house days are of the sphere of method and are phenomena of the moon. Therefore, even when the consonants enter the winds with long vowels, they are not stacked but are single."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"alysis of the Colors of the Lunar-Day DeitiesAt this point the colors of the lunar-day deities need to be examined. This has two outlines:1. Its presentation in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter2. How that presentation has produced two different explanationsIts presentation in the Methods of Accomplishment chapterThe Great Commentary on the thirty-third verse of the Methods of Accom­plishment chapter says:“Outside of that, the sun lotuses,” means that outside of that are the twelve lotuses of the body mandala. To the right of the east­ern gate and so forth on the walls of the fence, like Khagarbha and the others, Nairtya and so on are numbered.85This establishes the directions and how the deities are placed on the walls of the fence. The text continues:“Asura” means Nairtya, placed to the right of the eastern gate.86 “Cala” refers to Vayu, who is in the southeast. Yama is to the left of the southern gate. On the right is Agni. In the southwest is Sanmukha. To the left of the western gate is Yaksa and to the right is Sakra.87 In the northwest is Brahma. To the left of the northern gate is Rudra, to the right Samudra. In the northeast is Ganapati. To the left of the eastern gate is Visnu. All have four hands.88This passage teaches very clearly the positions of the lunar-day deities. The text continues with commentary on the thirty-fourth verse:"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"304 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentIn the two right hands of each of these twelve are implements.In the first of Nairtya, a sword and a curved knife.49And so on until:In the first of Visnu a wheel, and in the second a club.[249] Up to this point the passage is teaching the implements in the right hands. The text continues:Then on the left, in the first hand of Nairtya a shield, and in the second a skull.And so on until:In the first of Vasudeva50 a lotus, and in the second a conch of five lives. These are, in order, the implements held in the two left hands.51This passage teaches the symbols held in the left hands. In the same section, the text states:The lunar days of Caitra are on the petals of the Nairtya lotus.And so on until:The lunar days of Phalguna are on Yama.52This passage explains which lunar-day deities of which month are the entourage of which of the twelve great gods. The text continues:The colors, implements, and forms of the goddesses are similar.53The colors and so forth of the female deity entourage54 are those of the central deity. On the eighty-fourth verse of the Condensed Tantra, the Great Commentary says:This teaches the seed syllables of Sakra and the others of the body mandala. The syllable tarn is Sakra."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Analysis o f the Colors o f the Lunar-Day Deities 305And so on until:These are the seed syllables of the lunar-day deities.55This passage numbers the lunar-day deities as 360, gives the seed syllables from which they emanate, the names of each of the deities, which lunar- day goddess sits on which petal of the lotus, and how these deities ema­nating from their individual syllables correlate with particular months.How that presentation has produced two different explanationsAbhayakaragupta has the lunar-day deities of the east and southeast56 as black, those of the south and southwest red, those of the north and north­east white, and those of the west and northwest as yellow. Specifically he says that Rudra and entourage, who are the lunar-day deities of Mrigasira to the left of the northern door, are white. Kubera57 and entourage, the lunar-day deities of Pusya to the left of the western gate, are yellow. Visnu and entourage, the lunar-day deities of Magha sitting to the left of the east­ern gate, are black. [250] Yama and entourage, the lunar-day deities of Phalguna to the left of the southern gate, are red.According to the tradition of Sherap Seng£, the great Kalacakrapada of Rong,58 and others, these groupings of deity colors are wrong. They refute the above presentation because in their words, the fifty-eight lunar-day deities59 of Mrigas'ira and Pusya are of the gnosis element, are created from the sa consonant group, and are blue in color. The fifty-eight lunar-day deities of Magha and Phalguna are of the space element, develop from the ka consonant group, and are green. This assertion they back up with scrip­ture and logic. The scripture comes from the Great Commentary on the seventeenth verse of the Gnosis chapter:Now the generation of the Aksobhya class is taught. “From the emptiness of the pure crown” means that from the pure aggre­gate of consciousness and the pure element of space within the crown cakra arises the great Vajradhara Aksobhya sealed by gno­sis and green in color. Similarly Vajradhatvls'varl, Usnlsa, Vajrahumkara, RaudraksI, KhrodinI, Vajrapani, Dharmadhatu- vajra, Visnu, Yama, and the naga Jaya, emanate from the upper"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"306 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentface. They are of many qualities, granting siddhis of every activ­ity, marked by the sign of the vajra, sealed by Aksobhya, arising as green from the color of space.60Therefore because Visnu and Yama are of the major element of space, their color is “the color of space,” or green. The passage continues:From the purified aggregate of gnosis and the purified element of gnosis within the secret cakra arises a blue Vajrasattva marked by a three-pointed vajra sealed by consciousness. Similarly Prajfianila, Sumbha, Vajravega, Atinlla, KhrodinI, Isvari, Rudra, Jambhala, Samantabhadra, Sabdavajra, and the naga Vijaya, all of the gnosis element, these benefactors, causes of the liberation of sentient beings, emanate from the phenomena of gnosis in the lower foundation, arising in the color blue from the dhar­madhatu gnosis and sealed by Vajrasattva in the form of a blue Aksobhya in order to accomplish every activity.61[251] This says that Rudra and Jambhala, or Kubera, are blue in color. Moreover the previous passage from the Methods of Accomplishment chapter clearly lays out the twelve great deities with their number of hands, faces, hand implements, and where and in what direction of the wall they are placed. W ith the words “like Khagarbha and the others, Nairtya and so on are numbered,” the colors of these twelve deities in their respective places are clearly stated as being similar to the colors of the twelve male and female bodhisattvas in their respective places in the mind mandala. There­fore the deities Visnu, Yama, Rudra, and Kubera positioned on the left of the four gates are green and blue, as explained above, in the same way that the male and female bodhisattvas Vajrapani, Dharmadhatuvajra, Samanta­bhadra, and Sabdavajra in the mind mandala are also green and blue. If that is not the meaning of the above passages, then the line “like Khagarbha and the others,” which teaches a similarity to Khagarbha and other bodhisattvas, and which is not taught elsewhere in this section, would become mean­ingless, because except for the colors of the lunar-day deities, all other fea­tures such as their positions in the wall being similar to those of Khagarbha and so forth are dealt with and clearly taught in this section of text.Furthermore the Great Commentary says on the forty-second verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Analysis o f the Colors o f the Lunar-Day Deities 307In the colored-powder mandala all the goddesses who dwell in space and below, whoever they may be, are below the portals of the east and west gates. The direction protectors and so forth are meditated upon as dwelling in the places as taught. The four, Samantabhadra and others, on the left of the gate are similar.62Therefore when the powder mandala is drawn, [252] the green and blue space-element and gnosis-element goddesses dwelling above in space and in the lower regions are all placed under the east and west portals. To resolve a doubt as to whether the green and blue space-element and gno- sis-element deities among the upper and lower direction protectors Visnu, Rudra, Yama, and Kubera, and the male and female bodhisattvas Samanta­bhadra and so forth, should be visualized as being above and below like the upper and lower goddesses, the passage continues, “The direction protec­tors and so forth are meditated upon as dwelling in the places as taught. The four, Samantabhadra and others, on the left of the gate are similar.” This illustrates that although Samantabhadra and so forth and Visnu and so forth have been taught as being upper and lower gods, when meditating on the sadhana, one should meditate on their positions as taught in the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter. Therefore explaining Visnu and the oth­ers as being upper and lower gods establishes these four as being green and blue as previously explained. This is because the space-element upper deities of Kalacakra are green and the lower gnosis-element goddesses are blue. The sadhana composed by Sadhuputra states:These are in the south. Left of the east on a red garuda and lotus the letter kam and a wheel, from which arises a green Visnu in embrace with LaksmI, who is similar to Yaksa.63Also:From the letter sam and a trident arises a blue Hari with a tri­dent, arrow, and a khatvanga64 staff.65This text therefore states that Visnu is green and Hari, or Rudra, is blue. In the same text, where one would expect Yaksa to be similar to Rudra, the sadhana states, “Yaksa holds a jewel, club, mongoose, and lotus and is like Visnu,” thereby explaining that Kubera, or Yaksa, is of a color similar to Visnu. Where one would expect Yama to be similar to Visnu, the text has,"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"308 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment“Yama, similar to Hari,” thereby explaining that Yama is similar in color to Rudra. These must be misprints or mistranslation. [253] For example, in what should read, “From vajras and from the letter a arises Sabdavajra, of the nature of sound, together with Vajrapani,” the sadhana reads, “similar to Vajrapani,”66 thereby stating that Sabdavajra is similar to Vajrapani.67Therefore Sadhuputra also explains Visnu as green and Rudra as blue, whereas in this section on the lunar-day deities, there is no mention at all of Visnu as black, Rudra as white, Kubera as yellow, and Yama as red. This damages the former assertion. They may reply that it may not be men­tioned in this section on the lunar-day deities but it is taught elsewhere, and so cannot we infer, in this section on lunar-day deities, that also Visnu is black and so forth and that is the reason it was not taught in this particu­lar section? In the Initiation chapter, in the section on the protection wheel, the Great Commentary says:From gha and gha arise Brahma and Visnu, green and blue. Brahma is above the fence area and Visnu below.68This describes Visnu as being blue and says that Visnu is placed below. Therefore this accords with the gnosis element below being blue and with the lunar deity emanating from the gnosis sa consonant series as being blue. The Great Commentary continues:Similarly, in the south and southwest from dhr and dhfu Yama and Agni.69This describes Yama as being red, which agrees with your70 description of the lunar-day deity Yama and entourage as being red. However the pro- tection-wheel Yama, which emanates from the syllable dhri, is of the fire element and is in the south. The lunar-day Yama and entourage is pro­duced from the ka consonant series, is of the space element, and is a deity of the upper direction. Therefore they are similar in name only.Furthermore the Great Commentary says:In the north and northeast from bhu and bhu come Samudra and Sankara71This passage talks of a white Rudra, which agrees with your assertion of a"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Analysis o f the Colors o f the Lunar-Day Deities 309white lunar-deity Rudra. However the Rudra, or Sankara, of the protection wheel is produced from the syllable bhu, is of the water element, and is in the north. The lunar-day Rudra and his entourage emerges from the sa consonant group, is of the gnosis element, and is a god of the lower direc­tions. They are, therefore, similar in name only. The same is true of Kubera. [254] They all arise in the colors of the element of their syllables.Moreover Sadhuputra s sadhana says, “From the syllable hah and from a club arises a red Varahl and a white Sankara,”72 explaining that red Varahl is embraced by white Rudra. Similarly it is explained that white Rudrl is embraced by red Yama, and yellow BrahmanI is embraced by a black Hari,73 or Visnu. The white Rudra who embraces the feelings-aggregate Varahl is of the recognition aggregate, of the water element, and is therefore white. The Visnu embracing the form-aggregate BrahmanI is of the volition aggre­gate, of the air element, and is therefore black. The Yama who embraces the recognition-aggregate Rudrl is of the feeling aggregate, of the fire element, and is therefore red. The Great Commentary says on the eighty-third verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:Varahl and Kaumarl are of the feeling aggregate. Those facing them are of the recognition aggregate and arise from the letter u. Aindrl and BrahmanI are goddesses of the form aggregate. Facing them are those of the volition aggregate, who arise from the syllable e. Rudrl and LaksmI are of the recognition aggregate, and those facing them are of the feeling aggregate, arising from the letter r.1ATherefore, in the protection wheel, Visnu is a protector of the lower direc­tions and is therefore blue. Likewise the Rudra and the other figures of the protection wheel and the Rudra and other deities embracing the main female deities of the speech mandala are of elemental and directional col­ors determined by their individual syllables and major elements. In the same way, here in this section, the lunar-day deities must necessarily be of elemental and directional colors determined by their individual syllables and major elements. For example, in the Initiation chapter, the Great Com­mentary says, “Similarly, in the south and southwest from dhr and dhri, Yama and Agni.”75 On the basis of the minor elements, the syllable dha as the root of dhr is air, but the ta consonant group is predominant and deter­"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"3io Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentmined as being of the major element of fire, thereby creating in that sec­tion a red Yama and Agni. Similarly, the text continues, “In the north and northeast from b h u z n d b h u c o m t Samudra and Sankara.”76 [255] The bha of the syllable bhu is space on the basis of the minor elements, but the pa consonant group predominates and is determined to be of the major water element, and so Samudra and Sankara are posited as white.Therefore, with the exception of the individual consorts of the main lunar-day deities, the thirty lunar deities are put in five groups. On the basis of the minor elements, the syllables of these five groups will produce varying elements. However, on the basis of the major elements, every syl­lable of the twenty-nine deities is the same, and apart from the consort of each lunar-day main deity, the colors of the twenty-nine are the same.Using Abhayakaragupta’s assertion, it is not much of a reason to say that Visnu is black because when meditating on the sadhana and placing deities in the mandala he is in the east,77 for the same would have to apply to the male and female bodhisattvas placed on the left of the gates of the mind mandala also. Therefore the main reason for his position must be that in the speech mandala there is a black Visnu, a white Rudra, and a red Yama, all embracing the main female deities. Visnu and the others who emanate embracing the main female deities of the speech mandala also emanate as the main deities of Phalguna and the other lunar months in the body man­dala. Therefore Visnu and the others as lunar-day deities, and Visnu and the others embracing the main female deities of the speech mandala, must be similar in being black and so forth. This I think is the best reason.Again, these two assertions are (1) that the colors of the lunar-day deities of Mrigaiira, Pusya, Magha, and Phalguna are definitely green and blue or (2) that they are definitely black and so forth in accord with the colors of the directions. Our wise gurus (such as the great Sherap Rinchen) maintain that either position is acceptable. Nevertheless this is a topic to be thor­oughly and honesdy examined.After the emanation of the lunar-day deities, [256] the wrathful male and female guardians are generated to correlate with the eighth “grasping” month of pregnancy, during which the channels of the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the crown, and the anus are completed. After that, the nagas and the fierce females generated in correlation with the ninth or “tak­ing” month of pregnancy, when the twenty finger and toe channels are completed. The ten nagas are the purified forms of the channels of the ten toes, and the ten ferocious females represent the purified forms of the chan­"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"nels of the ten fingers. The thirty-five million elemental spirits inhabiting the far regions of the air mandaia correlate with the period in the ninth month of pregnancy when hair and body hair has grown.This generation process, up to the emanation of the thirty-five million elemental spirits, correlates with the completion of a human body endowed with the six elements after nine months in the womb. It also represents the completion of the deity generation within the body, speech, and mind mandalas of the sovereign mandaia as applied to the bases of purification. The Great Commentary, on the thirty-eighth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, states:Likewise the purified hair on head and body represented by the thirty-five million elemental spirits are born at the “far edges of movement,” which means at the farther reaches of the air man­daia. They are generated outside because hair is known to be on the skin at the far reaches of the body. In this way the body at the end of nine months and the collection of deities is complete.78The offering goddesses of the mind mandaia and the goddesses of desire and nondesire are generated here in the sovereign mandaia, and it may be wondered if they are generated as deities of the body, speech, and mind mandalas correlating to particular bases of purification. It would appear that they are not applied to bases of purification in the same way that the terraced offering goddesses are in other mandalas, such as those of Guhyasamaja. This is because the emanation of the thirty-five million ele­mental spirits represents the completion of deity manifestation applied to the duration of pregnancy, and the mind-mandala offering goddess and the desire and nondesire goddesses are not mentioned in the Great Com­mentary as correlating with a period of pregnancy. [257] Moreover, if the deities generated within the sovereign mandaia are to be applied to partic­ular bases, they must be applied to the periods of pregnancy.However the Great Commentary says on the forty-second verse:Then, in the nature of the ten channels of the heart, on terraces to the left and right of the four doors of the mind mandaia, offering goddesses emanate. In the east the goddesses of scent and of garlands.79Analysis o f the Colors o f the Lunar-Day Deities 311"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"312 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThis passage says that ten mind-mandala offering goddesses are purified forms of the ten channels at the heart cakra. However they cannot be cor­related with the ten channels of the heart, because when the deities in the sovereign mandala are applied to various bases, each group of deities cor­relates with a particular month of pregnancy and to a stage of development in the womb. The ten channels at the heart develop before the sixty-four channels at the navel and eight channels at the throat, which correlate with the speech-mandala yoginls. These offering goddesses, on the other hand, are generated after the elementals, as is stated by the words “Then, in the nature o f’ above.Therefore the sum total of deities actually described in terms of their number of faces and hands in this section on the sovereign mandala is as follows. The main father and mother plus the eight s'akti are ten. Four male tathagatas are embraced by four female tathagatas, and those four females are separately embraced by four male tathagatas to make sixteen tathagatas. This totals twenty-six deities. Six male bodhisattvas are embraced by six female bodhisattvas, and those six female bodhisattvas are embraced by six male bodhisattvas, to make twenty-four bodhisattvas,80 which together with the ten father-and-mother wrathful guardians from the mind mandala makes thirty-four and brings the total to sixty. With the ten mind-mandala offering goddesses, this makes seventy mother-and-father deity figures. This is the number of deities in the mind mandala.In the speech mandala each of the eight main goddesses is embraced by a god, making sixteen mother-and-father deities. Each of the main god­desses has an entourage of eight goddesses, making sixty-four and bringing the total to eighty. This totals 150 deities so far. The thirty-six desire god­desses make 186 deities up to and including the speech mandala.There are the 360 lunar-day deities and twelve body-mandala wrathful guardians comprising six father-and-mother pairs, which makes 372 and 558 in total. [258] There are ten nagas in mother-and-father union and ten fierce females also in mother-and-father union. This makes 598 deities. The thirty-six nondesire goddesses make 634. These are figures whose colors, numbers of hands, and faces are all clearly taught. The emanations of the thirty-five million elemental spirits are taught in a way that does not clar­ify the numbers of hand and faces. These are clearly described in the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter in the section on the sovereign mandala. Furthermore it is taught that there are eleven deities in each of the eight cemeteries, to make eighty-eight figures in the cemeteries. This makes a"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"total of 722. Apart from the thirty-five million elemental spirits, these are the total number of deities in the complete body, speech, and mind mán­dalas of Kalacakra.In terms of mind and body, “body” deities are generally green in the upper regions, blue in the lower regions, black in the east and southeast, red in the south and southwest, white in the north and northeast, and yellow in the west and northwest. “M ind” deities are the reverse. “Body” upper-region fathers embrace “mind” lower-region mothers, and “body” upper-region mothers embrace “mind” lower-region fathers. Those of the east and southeast and those of the west and northwest are method and wisdom respectively. Likewise those of the south and southwest and those of the north and northeast are method and wisdom respectively. Because of this, the green upper male and female deities are embraced by the blue lower female and male deities, and the blue lower male and female deities are embraced by the green upper female and male deities. Similarly the black male and female deities of the east and southeast are embraced by the yellow female and male deities of the west and northwest. The yellow deities of the west and northwest are embraced by the black deities of the east and southeast. The red deities of the south and southwest are embraced by the white deities of the north and northeast. The white deities of the north and northeast are embraced by the red deities of the south and southwest.This is only a general explanation. More specifically the Great Com­mentary, on the seventy-fifth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:Similarly the great one, the master, the aggregate of gnosis and Visvamátá, the element of gnosis, are body and mind for each other.81[259] This means that the gnosis-aggregate Vajrasattva and the gnosis-ele- ment Visvamátá Prajñápáramitá are method and wisdom. The text con­tinues, “Consciousness and the element of space,” which means that the consciousness-aggregate Aksobhya and the space-element Vajradhátvís'vari are method and wisdom. Likewise the Great Commentary, on the fifty- fourth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, states when explaining how the samaya beings and gnosis beings become of one taste:Analysis o f the Colors o f the Lunar-Day Deities 313"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"314 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentHere, in the generation yoga, in the stages of generation, “con­sciousness is together with space,” meaning together with Vajradhatvlsvarl, “within the central lotus,” meaning the great bliss, and upon fire, moon, sun, Râhu, and Kàlàgni, the samaya being and the gnosis being come to be of one taste.82The phrase “fire, moon, sun, Râhu, and Kàlàgni” is taken from the Shong translation. Other translations can be somewhat different.It is taught that the consciousness-aggregate Aksobhya, whose nature is the main deity, and the space-element VajradhàtvIsVari are mother-and- father method and wisdom. Such a statement is made in terms of pervad­ing consciousness and gnosis being fused together within the being of the main deity and are not statements made on the basis of individual method and wisdom where, for example, consciousness-aggregate Aksobhya in the form of method embraces one of his family, such as space-element Vajradhât- visvarl, in the form of wisdom. This is so because in the thinking of the hid­den tantras, such as Guhyasamâja, Vairocana and Locanà, for example, embrace each other as same-family method and wisdom, whereas in Kàlacakra thinking, method and wisdom involves mutual embracing between different families, while union within the same family is rejected. As the Great Commentary says:“From the mandaia, for the sake of the highest bliss.” This refers to union between different families.83O f the 634 figures whose colors, hands, and faces are actually mentioned in this section from the tantra and commentary on the sovereign mandaia, apart from the desire and nondesire goddesses, the colors, implements, positions, seats, and so forth of all of them are clearly described, [260] and they can be known in the same way as the colors of the lunar-day deities described in the discussion above.The colors of the desire and nondesire goddesses84 are the colors of the directions. Determining their hand implements in line with the implement symbols from which they are individually created, as the Pundarïka Trans­mission Sadhana has done85 is in tune with the thinking of the tantra and commentary. The Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Therefore Vajra Srrikhalâ and the others go to their facing posi­tions in families of the east and so forth. Because of the family, in the first right hand of Srrikhalâ is a sword.86This quote explains that the reason why the implements of the first hands of the wrathful goddesses are swords, for instance, is because they belong to that particular family. Similarly, although the hand implements of the desire and nondesire goddesses are not clearly taught, they can be known from the implements of the first hand of the families from which they are born. So from which families are they born? This is clearly set out in the Great Commentary beginning from the line, “In the east born from Târâ, dividing into desire goddesses.” Wherever a particular desire goddess is born, so the corresponding nondesire goddess is also born. How can the number of faces and hands be determined? If they are to be determined by whoever creates each goddess, then the numbers of hands and faces would vary. Therefore I think that Sâdhuputra’s assertion that they all have one face and two hands is correct. His sâdhana says:In the offering substances to the left of the southern door are ka., kha, ga, gha, na together with visarga. From these syllables, and from individual implements, arise five desire goddesses with two hands and rabbit87 face.88He also applies these descriptions to the nondesire goddesses.In the Great Commentary it says:From Vajradhâtvïs'varï comes the goddess Tribhavàprànàpahà- rinecchâ. From Visvamâtâ comes the goddess Utpâdanaecchâ.89If these two were counted separately, as is quoted here, there would have to be thirty-eight desire goddesses. Therefore they should be counted as one. As the Great Commentary states:The thirty-seven desire goddesses are in the speech mandala, divided into their families, in their respective positions.90[261] This states the number of desire goddesses to be thirty-seven.

From a completely formed red dh arises a sun mandaia whose nature is the gnosis of equality.53Thus the moon and sun, which are the bases for the placement of the vow­els and consonants whose natures are the physical signs and marks of an enlightened being, arise from am and dh respectively. Later scholars (such as the dharma master Kumara) maintain that the moon arises from the thirty-two vowels and the sun from the consonants. Their sources come from the Vajragarbha Commentary:From the causes of a buddha’s signs, the moon on which are thirty-two vowels.Also:From a and so forth, from ka and so forth,the three realms made pure will arise, lord of men.54"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"318 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment[262] Also the Supreme and Unchanging Bliss summary says:On top of that, from the chain of vowels and chain of conso­nants the moon and the sun.95Thus they assert their positions with scriptural authority. Rongpa Kala- cakrapada and his followers, as well as the Pundarika Transmission Sadhana?* maintain as actually taught in the Great Commentary that the moon and sun are not created from seed syllables. So who is right? Schol­ars have presented as scriptural authority the teaching that the phenomena of the three realms are produced from the letters a and ka and so forth, while the Supreme and Unchanging Bliss quote above teaches that the moon and sun seat of the main deity arises from the vowels and conso­nants. Therefore there is common ground in the scriptural authority. Moreover the Supreme and Unchanging Bliss summary also says:From a and so forth and ka and so forth, the moon and sun are produced by ha and ksa? 7The moon is created from ha and the sun from ksa, thereby explaining that the sun and moon arise from individual letters. The text continues:The moon mandala is of the nature of the letter a or the letter ha, and the sun mandala is of the nature of the letter ra or the letter ksa?*This quote explains that the moon and sun as seats of the main deity also arise from the letter a and ra. The visarga can be a development of either the letter ra or the letter sa, and therefore Sadhuputra’s assertion that the sun is created from ah is correct. The syllable am is a development of ah, and therefore his statement that the moon is created from am is correct. The letter am exists within the thirty-two vowels that are the causes of the thirty-two signs of a buddha, and therefore this conforms with the scrip­tural authority of the quote, “From the causes of a buddha’s signs, the thirty-two vowels as the moon.”99In general, the sun and moon at this particular time should definitely arise from seed syllables, because at other times when the sun, moon, and so forth are created, they are created from seed syllables, and it is no"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 319different here. Because of this Sàdhuputra says that the moon and sun at this point arise from the letters am and ah.At the time of the main deity generation from the five enlightenments, Rongpa Kâlacakrapàda and the Pundarika Transmission Sddhana do not develop the hand implement100 out of hüm. [263] This accords with the lit­eral meaning of the Great Commentary. The thinking of the Pundarika Transmission masters, however, is that the gnosis of analysis arises in the form of a vajra from the hüm in the center of the sun and moon marked with the consonants and vowels. Illum inating Reality, when explaining the “generation stage devoid of generation stage,”101 expressed by verses such as the one beginning “Vowels and consonants in union”102 in the section on making prostrations to the definitive Kâlacakra, states:Prostration is to whom? To resultant Kâlacakra. How does it differ? The union of moon and sun, meaning in embrace and marked by vowels and consonants, the placement of the seed syllable hum and the letter p h a t blocking the flow of the ele­ments at the tip of the vajra, and the meditations of the hand implement formed from the syllable as taught by the phrase “and so forth,” are all “abandoned.”103This passage speaks of a meditation in which the five enlightenments are created by the moon and sun in embrace, marked by the vowels and con­sonants, in the center of which a hand implement arises from the hüm seed syllable. This is also the thinking of the tantra because the tenth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the Condensed Tantra states:On moon and sun, the vowels a and so forth, the consonants ka and so forth, together with the vajra, and from the five, such as the mirrorlike, five light rays spread, pure light radiates.Meditate upon Kâlacakra.104Thus a meditation is taught in which moon and sun in embrace are marked with the vowels and consonants, and in their center is the vajra hand imple­ment. Similarly the Great Commentary, on the seventy-third verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"320 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThe seed syllable creates the implement, the implement creates the deity, and this is understood at all times by the yogi.

Immediately after this line the sâdhana continues:Then meditate that in their center is a blue letter h üm , from which arises a crossed vajra marked by hüm and which is of the nature of gnosis of analysis. Then meditate on all three blend­ing as one, adorned with the letter h i of the nature of gnosis of accomplishment. Then every part of the body is complete, and the nature of the letter ham is the very pure gnosis of reality.This is the glorious Kalacakra explained below in the section on prostration. However the twenty-six armed one....107[264] “Crossed vajra” and “twenty-six armed one” refer to Vajravega. The rest applies to the creation of the main deity at this particular time.At this time the following occurs. Sun and moon marked with conso­nants and vowels are the manifest enlightenments arising from the mirror­like gnosis and the equality gnosis. In the center is a hüm from which arises a vajra marked with a hüm at its center. This is the enlightenment arising from the gnosis of analysis. The heart of this vajra together with the other previously mentioned manifest enlightenments, or alternatively, the heart of a vajra and hüm that has arisen from these manifest enlightenments blending into one, is “possessed of the letter hi,” meaning marked by the letter hi. This is the enlightenment of the gnosis of accomplishment. From that comes the conqueror Kalacakra, all body parts complete, together with the letter ham. This is enlightenment of the reality gnosis.The above should be explained in connection with the tantra and com­mentary. The tantra states, “On moon and sun, the vowels a and so forth, the consonants ka and so forth, together with the vajra,” to which the com­mentary remarks, “Moon and seminal fluid are with the vowels” and fur­ther, “Sun and blood are with the consonants.”108 This explains that the vowels and consonants are held on moon and sun bases. “Together with a vajra” indicates the vajra as a base.

This vajra is that which “pos­sesses,” and the letter h i is that which is “possessed.” On this the com­mentary says, “They become one together with the wind letter h i.” Just as the moon and sun “possess” the vowels and consonants, the letter hi must have a base, and that has to be the vajra. [265] With this in mind Sadhu­putra writes, “All three blend as one, adorned with the letter h i of the nature of the gnosis of accomplishment. \"From the vajra, the letter hum, and the letter hi arises Kalacakra, every part of his body complete and marked by the letter ham.

This is the glorious Kalacakra explained below in the section on prostration. How­ever the twenty-six armed one...How the main deity is actually created from the five enlightenments is sub­ject to much disagreement. However it has been settled by the strength of the explanations of the material from the tantra and commentary.111The main deity Kalacakra that has been generated this way is meditated on as having the nature of Vajrasattva, the purified gnosis aggregate whose hands and faces, etc., are in the form of the main deity. In the section on the withdrawal of the main mother-and-father deities and the eight s'akti, the Great Commentary says, “Together with mudra, the complete Vajra­sattva.”112 This indicates that the complete generation of the main deity is the complete Vajrasattva. This also teaches that the eight s'akti are consorts of the main deity.Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 321"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"322 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThe generation of the entourage deitiesMost Tibetan scholars say that Aksobhya and so forth in the form of the mandala assembly enter the body of the main deity and are melted by the fire of great desire into the form of bodhicitta, which then flows from the vajra to fall into the lotus of the mother. There individual drops become the seed syllables of deities, which in turn transform into hand implements and finally into deities who emanate from the mother's lotus to take their places on their seats within the external mandalas. [266] Some scholars maintain that when generating the deities of the sovereign mandala, first the base mandala is created again within the lotus of the consort, and then the dependent deities are generated in this lotus mandala and not to an out­side mandala. If they were emanated to an outside mandala, “this would mean that the samaya mandala would be complete, and the instruction to emanate a samaya mandala in the section on the sovereign activity would be incorrect.” As verification of this assertion they quote, “Here in the lotus of one's consort” and so on. Moreover the Great Commentary says on the nineteenth verse of the Condensed Tantra:The melted moon emerges from one’s vajra into the lotus of one's consort to transform into the mandala assembly of gods and goddesses, the full and complete base and dependents.113They apparently think that “base and dependents” indicates that the man­dala base, too, has to be created within the mother’s lotus, and that the line “emerges from one's vajra into the lotus of one's consort” teaches that the dependent deities and the base mandalas are only created within the lotus and are not emanated to an outside mandala. To conclude from this that the meaning of the commentary is that from the drops falling into the mother’s lotus, both mandala base and dependent deities must be created within the lotus seems like a good explanation, but great masters of the past have explained “base” as meaning “seed.” Therefore who is correct needs to be investigated.However to assert that the whole deity assembly of the sovereign man­dala is completed by their creation within the mother’s lotus and that they do not emanate from the mother’s lotus to an outside mandala is not cor­rect. If it were, there would have to be an explanation on how the mother and father of the sovereign mandala along with the sakti are created within"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"the lotus of the mother, but no such explanation is found in the tantra and commentary, nor can any such understanding be inferred. Furthermore, if the sovereign mandala were complete merely by the creation of the base mandala and the dependent deities within the mother’s lotus, consider this quote from the Great Commentary on the fiftieth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:“Then the vajra holder also dissolves into the ‘moon.’” The word also ’ means that the wisdom also dwells with mind vajra and gnosis vajra inside the avadhütï and the sa n kh in V 14[267] This says that when the main deity dissolves, the mother also dis­solves. Therefore, when the mother dissolves, it must be accepted that the deities within the lotus of the mother also dissolve. If that is the case, you must ask how it could be possible for the four goddesses to perform the arousal by song.115Furthermore to assert that during the meditation of the sovereign man­dala the deities do not emanate from the mother’s lotus to an outside man­dala contradicts the tantra and commentary. The Great Commentary from “The melted moon emerges from one’s vajra into the lotus” until “the full and complete base and dependents ’’teaches the formation of the base man­dala and dependent deities within the mother’s lotus from the drops that have traveled there. The Great Commentary continues:Meditate upon Aksobhya as the great lord who enters the body of the primordial buddha.116This shows that Aksobhya travels from the mother’s lotus to enter the body of the main deity. The text continues:Then on the direction lotuses are emanated “ocean” buddhas, meaning four buddhas, of nine eyes, with “fire” faces, meaning three faces, and “time” hands, meaning six hands.This emanation must be an emanation from the mother’s lotus, because the emanation from the father’s vajra into the lotus is taught immediately prior to this passage. Therefore these passages from the Great Commentary teach that the deities emanate from the mother’s lotus and are placed in theirResolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 323"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"324 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentcardinal and intermediate positions within the celestial mansion, and that means being placed within an external base mandala.Furthermore the Great Commentary, on the fifty-first verse of the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter, in the section on deity emanation during the sovereign activities says:For the sake of the samaya mandala, they enter one’s body and arrive at the wisdom lotus, on which stand the individual letters in the form of a mantra. Then from the lotus, as before, char­acterized by their faces, hands, hand symbols, and forms, they emanate to the gnosis, mind, speech, and body mandalas. In the phrase “again the mandalas are manifested,” the word again means “as before.”117This means that in the section on the sovereign activity, the deities mani­fest with faces, hands, hand symbols, and forms and emanate to the gno­sis, mind, speech, and body mandalas from the mother’s lotus, and all this is done in the same way that the previous emanation of the sovereign man­dala was performed. [268] Therefore the above assertion contradicts this tantra and commentary passage also.However the previous consequence, “this would mean that the samaya mandala would be complete, and the instruction to emanate a samaya man­dala in the section on the sovereign activity would be incorrect,” still does not follow. The purpose of initially visualizing an outside base mandala is to purify the mother’s womb into which one is conceived. Creating the deities in the mother’s lotus during the sovereign-mandala meditation and sending them out from the lotus to take their place within the base man­dala is for the purpose of purifying the aggregates, elements, and sources of the being inside the womb. Emanating the deities and placing them within the base mandala during the sovereign-activity meditation is for the pur­pose of purifying the aggregates at birth. Therefore it does not follow that when the deity emanation of the sovereign-mandala meditation is com­plete, the creation of the samaya deities is also complete, because in terms of its base of purification, the samaya mandala emanation is not complete.When the male and female tathagatas are first emanated, Aksobhya is meditated upon as the great lord embracing the consort Prajnaparamita and sent from the mother’s lotus to enter the body of the main deity. This is taught by the previous quotes, beginning “Meditate upon Aksobhya as"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 325the great lord and Aksobhya enters.” However Vajrasattva embraced by consort and entering the main deity is not taught by the Great Commen­tary, nor is it implicit. This is because the nature of the main deity is Vajra­sattva, as has been made clear in the Great Commentary in a previous quote.118The ten s'akti are explained as being consorts of the main deity. Eight of them, excluding Prajñápáramitá and Jñánapáramitá, are of the nature of the other eight perfections, beginning with the perfection of giving and so forth, and these are the eight goddesses, Krsnadiptá and so forth, placed upon the petals of the central lotus. The two sakti in the east and south­east are of the air element. Those of the south and southwest are of the fire element. Those of the west and northwest are of the earth element, and those of the north and northeast the water element. Prajñápáramitá is of the element of gnosis, and Jñánapáramitá is of the element of space. Visvamátá is of the nature of both Prajñápáramitá and Jñánapáramitá while being generated in the aspect of Visvamátá. [269] This is because the consorts of the main deity are ascertained as being the ten s'akti, and at this part of the generation stage, Visvamátá also has to be established as being of the nature of a sakti. The Great Commentary, on the sixteenth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:Jñánapáramitá is included within Visvamátá. The other eight paramitas of giving and so forth are the eight goddesses on the petals.119Similarly, after Aksobhya has been sent forth and has merged into one’s body, Vajradhátvls'varí embraced by Vajrasattva is sent forth from the mother’s lotus and enters Visvamátá. The reason for this will be explained in the section dealing with doubts concerning the numbers of deities on lotus seats. There is no need for Prajñápáramitá embraced by Aksobhya to enter the mother because Visvamátá is of the nature of Prajñápáramitá.If the nature of the main deity is Vajrasattva, then the following doubt might occur. The Great Commentary says “with the crown of Vajrasattva,”120 thereby affirming that at this stage, the main deity has Vajrasattva as his crown. However, in the Gnosis chapter, it says that gnosis is sealed by consciousness, and consciousness is sealed by gnosis. Moreover the Great Commentary, on the sixtieth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chap­ter, says:"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"32 6 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment“Now the crown” and so forth talks of the deities being sealed by their families. Here in the mandala of the supreme original bud­dha, on the crown is a vajra in the manner of two vajras crossed.Why? Because consciousness and gnosis are perfectly united. Therefore gnosis is applied to consciousness, and consciousness is applied to gnosis.121Therefore gnosis Vajrasattva and consciousness Aksobhya are sealed by each other. Is this not contradictory? There is no fault here. The quote that the main deity, who has the nature of Vajrasattva, is adorned with the crown of Vajrasattva illustrates that here in the sovereign-mandala meditation, the main deity in the form of Kalacakra has the nature of Vajrasattva, and is a statement made on the basis of the main deity being generated in that way during the process of deity creation. During the process of sealing, the state­ment that gnosis and consciousness are sealed by each other is made on the basis of Vajrasattva and Aksobhya being of distinct forms [270] and being sealed by their family lord after the initiation meditation.122The seats of the dietiesIn the meditation on the celestial mansion foundation in its stacked arrangement, Rahu is visualized on top of the moon and sun, but it is not the thinking of the tantra and commentary that Kalagni is visualized on top of Rahu. The Great Commentary says:On that is the letter ham, from which arises a moon mandala the size of the lotus center. O n that is a visarga, from which arises a sun mandala. On that there is a drop, from which arises “fire,” meaning the mandala of Rahu, dark blue in color. These all fuse into one to become ham ksa ma la wa r a y a. Meditate on this as the seed syllable and think that from this the realms of the world are created.123This teaches that Rahu is visualized on top of a moon and sun, but it does not teach that Kalagni is to be visualized on top of Rahu. Moreover, in ascending order, the ten letters of the powerful ten-syllable stack, such as the life-giving a and so forth, are the seed syllables of space, air, fire, water, earth, and Meru, in whose center is a lotus, moon, sun, and Rahu. There"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 327is no letter for Kalagni separate from Rahu. On the meditation of this stacked arrangement as it is applied to the inner world, the Great Com­mentary says:The three channels of excrement, urine, and fluid are the man­dalas of the moon, sun, and Rahu coming together at the cen­ter of the secret lotus.124Thus no inner application is taught for Kalagni separate from Rahu. Some may wonder if the nadane> of the drop is the seed syllable of Kalagni? If that were so, the powerful ten-syllable stack would not add up, because it would have to contain eleven seed syllables. Furthermore, in this section on the meditation upon the stacked arrangement of the foundation mandalas, there is no mention of nada visualization in the commentary on the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter, as the previous quote reveals. [271] Also the Great Commentary on the Realms chapter, in the section on the for­mation of the mantra, says:H am ksa ma la tua ra ya is the assembly of the worlds and the vajra body. In space the le tte r^ , the mandala of air. On top of that the ra fire mandala. On top of that the wa water mandala.O n top of that the la earth mandala. On top of that the ma Meru. That is the fifth. Above that the ksa lotus of animate beings. On top of that the formless worlds ha. From the ha the visarga is the sun, the drop is the moon, and the nada is the sign of the one-pointed vajra.126The nada, therefore, is drawn on top of the drop. However it is not a seed syllable letter but symbolizes a one-pointed vajra, which in turn illustrates indestructibility. Nowhere is it spoken of as being the seed syllable of Rahu or Kalagni.Furthermore ham ksa ma la wa r a y a is the mantra of the ten seed sylla­bles, and there are ten corresponding phenomena that they illustrate. With this in mind, the Great Commentary quotes a passage from the Samgiti.Ten parts of ten meanings, the mighty one of ten powers, the all-pervading master, accomplishing the wishes of all, the great and powerful in ten aspects.127"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"328 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentHowever the Great Commentary says:The secret lotus is like the lotus of the Conqueror. The three channels of excrement, urine, and fluid are the mandalas of the moon, sun, and Ráhu coming together at the center of the secret lotus.128Concerning this quote the question might arise, “In the secret lotus are found the moon and sun channels, and isn’t the central channel the ia n kh in i channel of Kálágni?” Generally there are many instances in the tantra and commentary of the three channels of excrement, urine, and fluid being termed the channels of the moon, sun, and Kálágni. However here the line “The three channels of excrement, urine, and fluid are the mandalas of the moon, sun, and Ráhu” does not teach the three channels to be those of the moon, sun, and Kálágni but teaches that these three channels corre­late with the outer phenomena of the moon, sun, and Ráhu. Likewise “The secret lotus is like the lotus of the Conqueror” explains that the mother’s secret lotus and the visualized lotus are correlated phenomena.[272] Similarly it is also correct to say that the seat of the main deity is either Ráhu or Kálágni upon a moon disk, but to posit both Ráhu and Kálágni is not the intention of the tantra and commentary. Again and again the tantra and commentary talk of the three seats of moon, sun, and Ráhu or Kálágni, and that arrangement perfecdy fits the outer-inner correlation, whereas four seats does not. How is this taught in the tantra and com­mentary? In the first summary from the Realms chapter it says:Mandalas of air, fire, water, and earth,Meru> lotus, moon, sun, and Kálágni,on top of these, upon Kvara and the head of Mára,his feet with those of the mother of existence.129Similarly, from the second summary from the Realms chapter:“Sitting on the vajra lion throne.” The vajra lion throne is of moon, sun, and Agni mandalas, indestructible and indivisible. Alternatively the letter ¿of the element of space is the vajra-lion throne.130"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 329In the fourth summary from the Realms chapter it says:“The Buddha sat upon the lion throne.” The lion throne is of the element of space. Alternatively, sitting upon the lion throne of moon, sun, and Agni mandalas, he “sat upon the lion throne.”131These quotes show that the teacher of the tantra in the form of the main deity of the mandala sat in the center of the mandala on a seat of moon, sun, and Agni, and the seat of the visualized mandala should be similar. The second verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:Feet on moon, sun, and Agni mandalas, upon Mara and Rudra.132The Great Commentary on the ninth verse of Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:Half that size is the lotus of the Conqueror. Its center takes up one third of the lotus, as does the moon, sun, and Râhu man­dalas.133On the tenth verse also:In the center of the mandala, the mandalas of the moon, sun, and Râhu, and on the moon mandala are thirty vowels.134On the eleventh verse:“O n the central lotus, on moon, sun, and Agni,” means upon the lalanâ, rasanâ, and avadhütï.135[273] The Great Commentary on the fifty-seventh verse of the Initiation chapter, in the section on the placing of the deity symbols, says:“The color of the variegated lotus of the conquering lord” refers to the color green.136 “On a moon, sun, and Agni is the letter hüm .”At the end of the empty sky, the moon, sun, and Râhu join, and the seat of the mandala is well endowed with the moon, sun, and Agni.

On top of that the moon, sun, and Rahu, on top of that the letter hum to be drawn using blue powder. 137In some of these passages the name “Rahu” is used and in others “Kalagni” is used. Sometimes when the term “Kalagni” is used in the tantra, it is commented upon using the name “Rahu.” This is done to indicate that either name can be understood as Rahu or Kalagni. Likewise the Great Commentary on the sixty-first verse of the Initiation chapter, when explain­ing the seed syllables of the seat of the main deity, says:In the center the letters am, ah, and a. These are the individual seats of the moon, sun, and Rahu.138Here only the three syllables of moon, sun, and Rahu are taught. In the Shong translation of the Great Commentary, on the fifty-fourth verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, it says:“In the great bliss and upon fire,” meaning on moon, sun, Rahu, and Kalagni, the samaya being and the gnosis being come to be of one taste.139However other translations say, “‘on fire,’ meaning on moon, sun, Rahu, or Kalagni mandalas,” thereby positing either Rahu or Kalagni. Therefore, using an accurate translation, there are no passages teaching a stacking of both Rahu and Kalagni as seats of the main deity.Furthermore the way that these three stacked seats of the main deity are applied to inner and outer phenomena is as taught in the previous quote from the Initiation chapter, where Kalagni is used in the line “on a moon, sun, and Agni,” which is from the tantra, and Rahu is used in the com­mentary in the line “At the end of the empty sky, the moon, sun, and Rahu join.”140 In the external world, in the empty sky, the sun and moon are sometimes eclipsed by Kalagni and sometimes by Rahu, and the thinking behind the above quote is that just as eclipses can be caused by either Rahu or Kalagni, [274] so the seat of the main deity can have either Rahu or Kalagni on top of the moon and sun. If this were not the case, the exter­nal world would not correlate with either the Other or the Inner, because it is impossible for the sun or the moon to be eclipsed simultaneously by Rahu and Kalagni. As the Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Inside, well endowed with lalana, rasand, and avadhuti, is the heart lotus. On top of that the moon, sun, and Rahu.141Therefore, when meditating on the stacked arrangement with Rahu on top of moon and sun, the three seats correlate with the left, right, and central channel at the heart. When meditating on the stacked arrangement with Kalagni, the three seats correlate with the channels of excrement, urine, and fluid gathered at the secret area.This assertion of three seats consisting of moon, sun, and Rahu or Kalagni is in accord with the thinking of venerable Gyaltsap’s Six Yogas and with the J£ Tsongkhapa’s Notes on Kdlacakra.The number of deities on lotus seatsAlthough it is not actually taught in the Methods of Accomplishment chap­ter that the eight nagas and the eight fierce females are on lotus seats, such an assertion, as taught in the Kalacakrapada Transmission, is valid, because in the Inner chapter, 156 lotus-seated deities are mentioned, and the eight nagas and eight fierce females are included among them. So how are these lotus-seated deities counted?This is under two headings:1. The tantra and commentary passages to be explained2. Determining the number of deities by explaining the above passagesThe tantra and commentary passages to be explained The Great Commentary says:The ten perfections are the ten s'akti. Usnlsa and so forth are the ten wrathful ones. Thus there are ten of each.142Also:“Five are the buddhas and goddesses” refers to the five buddhas Aksobhya and so forth and the five goddesses Vajradhatvlsvari and so forth. Thus there are five of each.143Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 331[275] Also:"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Rupavajra and others making six, arid Ksitigarbha and the oth­ers to make six. Thus there are six of each.144Also:O f Indra and so forth there are twelve.145Also:Carcika and others make eight, Ananta and others make eight, and Svanavaktra and others make eight.146Therefore the ¿akti and the wrathful protectors make twenty. The ten male and female tathagatas and the twelve male and female bodhisattvas bring the total to forty-two. Twelve main lunar-day deities and the twenty-four deities consisting of eight yoginls, eight wrathful females, and eight female nagas make thirty-six, bringing the total to seventy-eight. The Great Com­mentary states:Again these are divided into wisdom and method. Therefore, multiplied by two, there are 104 Kalacakras. Half of that comes to fifty-two deities.147Also:Again, individually, 156 deities should be known within the Kalacakra.148These quotes talks of deities individually and in union. Therefore in union they number seventy-eight and individually 156. After the above quote the text continues: “These are determined as being the assembly of deities within the center of lotuses,” thereby ascertaining that each of these deities is posi­tioned within the center of a lotus. These are the principal deities of the mandala as presented in the Condensed Tantra. This can be understood from the text following “Svanavaktra and others to make eight,” which says:All these deities are each differentiated by name in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter.149By counting the deities and consorts individually, how does one arrive at 156? It is like this. The four tathagatas, Amoghasiddhi and so forth, the332 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 333four female tathagatas, Tara and so forth, the twelve male and female bodhisattvas, the eight yoginis, the twelve deities of the lunar months, the eight nagas and the eight wrathful females are clearly enumerated both individually and with consort in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter. The ten s'akti can be counted individually and with consort as follows. As quoted above, “Jnanaparamita is included within Visvamata,” which means that Jnanaparamita is combined within Visvamata, who has the nature of Prajnaparamita. [276] Visvamata being of the nature of two s'akti and embracing the main deity thus forms two mother-and-father pairs. The eight s'akti arranged upon the lotus petals one by one embrace the main deity in the center, thereby forming eight mother-and-father pairs. This is how the ten s'akti become the ten mother-and-father pairs.Aksobhya embraced by Prajnaparamita enters the main deity, and Vajradhatvis'vari embraced by Vajrasattva enters the mother to form two mother-and-father pairs in union and also to stand in the main mother- and-father lotus center. Vajradhatvis'vari embraced by Vajrasattva and entering the mother is not explicitly taught in the Methods of Accom­plishment chapter, but it has to be this way because Vajradhatvisvarl embraced by a father deity is explained as being a lotus-seated deity in the Condensed Tantra, but no separate lotus seat is mentioned for them.The ten mother-and-father wrathful-protector pairs comprise five from the mind mandala and, excluding Usnlsacakrl, five of the body mandala. Usnlsacakrl of the body mandala is one with Usnlsacakrl of the mind man­dala and is therefore not counted separately. If it were, the wrathful pro­tectors would number eleven, which would directly contradict the Great Commentary. Moreover those who do not count the ten s'akti as being ten consort pairs, those who count Vajrasattva mother and father apart from the main deity, and those who do not count Vajradhatvis'vari embraced by consort also contradict the Great Commentary. Furthermore to use the quote “in the lap of method, wisdom is not the main deity, and in the lap of wisdom, method is not the main deity” as the reason for not including Vajradhatvis'vari who enters the mother embraced by the father is just wrong, because when Vajradhatvis'vari is embraced by the father, it is a case of the father being in the lap of wisdom.150 The mother, therefore, becomes the main deity. That will be discussed later, and this will suffice for the time being.Concerning the 156 lotus-seated deities plus the six sealing deities, the Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"334 Part 4 : $a dhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentNow it is taught how the Condensed Tantra arose from the Supreme a n d O riginal Buddha. The twenty more than 1,600 supreme and original buddhas were divided by thirty to become fifty-four deities. This again was multiplied by the three man­dalas of body, speech, and mind to become sixty-two more than a hundred.151[277] The principal deides were compiled and condensed from the 1,620 deities of the Root Tantra mandala. The mandala of the Root Tantra is known as the glorious constellation mandala. On this the Great Commentary says:The Buddha has said that the assembly of deities in the Supreme a n d O rig n a l Buddha mandala of constellations are of the num­ber of hours in the constellations.152162 lotus-seated deities, including the six sealing deities, were compiled and taught from the assembled deities of the glorious constellation mandala. The thinking behind this is that after meditating upon the Kalacakra deities, the bases are to be purified, and these are the 156 main channels of the six cakras plus the channels of the six families. The channels of the six families are, “laland, rasand, and avadhütï, and the flow of excrement, urine, and fluid.” Thus 162 channels are taught. The 156 channels are mentioned in the Great Commentary in a passage that runs from “Likewise the channels of Kalacakra are taught. There are four at the crown” until “encircled by thirty- two”153 These are the four channel petals at the crown, eight at the heart, six­teen at the forehead, thirty-two at the throat, sixty-four at the navel, and thirty-two in the secret place. O f these, six inner petals and ten intermedi­ate petals of the secret-area channels act as bases for the creation of illnesses caused by a combination of wind, bile, and phlegm. The four petals of the crown and the sixteen of the forehead are bases for phlegm illnesses. The thirty-two petals of the throat and the eight of the heart are bases for bile- related illnesses. The sixty-four petals of the navel and the sixteen outer petals of the secret area are bases for wind-related problems. [278] O f the 156 channels in these particular aspects, the Great Commentary says:Therefore the 156 are channels that dwell in the nature of the Kalacakra gods and goddesses and that bring death to ordinary beings.154"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 335Therefore the 156 channels in purified form are in essence the male and female deities. Those same channels bring death to ordinary beings who lack the skilful means. When possessed of these means, they enjoy not only long life and health but also the achievement of supreme enlightenment. The Great Commentary says:Within the six cakras the 156 channels are to be understood as channels of Kalacakra. These death-bringing channels, by the power of the gurus teaching, also bring long life and health.The Kalacakra channels are said to dwell within the six channel wheels, and when meditated upon in accord with the guru’s instruction, the fear of death will be destroyed. To the yogi this is nothing special.155Therefore the 156 channels are to be meditated upon as being Kalacakra lotus-seated deities or are to be perceived as channels for purification. If they are meditated upon as the 156 lotus-seated deities, long life and health will follow. For the yogi this alone is nothing special, for far greater is the attainment of the supreme siddhi of enlightenment that will follow.Will such attainments come about by meditating only upon the gener­ation stage as a purifier of the channels? From this practice alone they will not, but generation-stage meditations ripen the mind for the creation of the completion stage, and then with “certainty from the guru,” meaning instructions of the guru, if one meditates upon the six-branched yoga of the completion stage, the temporary achievements of long life and good health, as well as the permanent attainment of the supreme siddhi, will come about.The Great Commentary states:Again, in each of the 162 channels flow the ten winds and forms in the nature of the ten elements and aggregates. These in total multiplied by ten become twenty more than 1,600, the number of hours within the twenty-seven constellations. Similarly there are that number of main deities of wisdom and method within the glorious constellation mandala of the Supreme and Original Buddha. From this vast constellation mandala the deities of the nonultimate mundane flowing elements of phlegm and so forth bring about the accomplishments of physical or worldly siddhis."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"336 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentFor these attainments Manju&I taught the six main cakras and ascertained the number of Kalacakra channels.156[279] This passage explains that ten winds together with the five aggre­gates and five elements flow within each of the 162 channels. Therefore externally there are 1,620 Root Tantra gods and goddesses divided into method and wisdom within the glorious mandala of constellations, and that by 1,620 generation-stage meditations, worldly siddhis such as the sid- dhi of peace, are directly achieved, while indirecdy the temporary achieve­ments of health and extended life and the permanent attainment of the supreme siddhi will be attained.The part of the passage beginning “From this vast constellation man­dala” teaches that in the nonultimate worldly generation stage, one medi­tates upon the deities that nourish the element channels of phlegm and so forth, as mentioned above, and directly attain worldly siddhi or, indirectly, health and long life, as well as the supreme siddhi. To this end the con­queror Manjus'rl compiled the Condensed Tantra deities from the Root Tantra, and these deities are the lotus-seated deities that purify the 156 channels of the six main cakras.Immediately after the sentence ending “ascertained the number of Kalacakra channels,” the Great Commentary continues:“Six” and so forth talks of guarding the channels of the six fam­ilies. It is said that in the body, the cakras of these six channels are to be halted. They are in three pathways. Above, the moon, sun, and Rahu dwell in the paths of the left, right, and center. Below, divided into moon, sun, and Agni, they dwell in the paths of excrement, urine, and fluid. These the yogi protects in the body. How? “By the instruction of the guru.” The instruc­tion of the guru is the six-branched yoga, and that will bring protection from death. “They bring death to living creatures,” because the winds flow within these six. If the winds flow in the six, at that time and at all times, men will definitely be destroyed by death. Among the six is “the subtle,” or the central avadhutl.If the winds do not enter “the subtle,” “how will the yogis destroy the realm of death?” Definitely they will not destroy the realm of death.157"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 337[280] In this passage the text beginning from the sentence, “They bring death to living creatures” up to the last sentence, “Definitely, they will not destroy the realm of death,” teaches that the winds of karma enter the six channels— the three upper left, right, and central channels and the three lower channels of excrement, urine, and fluid. And as long as their flow is not halted and the winds do not flow solely in the central avadhutl, then for so long will death continue to destroy. The text from “In the body” until “These the yogi protects in the body” teaches that the life-sustaining wind and downwardly expelling wind, which flow and dwell in the three upper and three lower channels, are halted and brought to the central chan­nel, and that the yogi will accomplish the temporary fruits of protection from physical death and illness as well as the permanent attainment of the supreme siddhi. How is this accomplished? The 156 lotus-seated deities together with the six sealing deities are focused on as being the purifiers of 162 channels comprising the 156 channel petals of the six main cakras together with the right, left, and central channel and the three channels of excrement, urine, and fluid, known collectively as the channels of the six families. This generation-stage practice ripens the continuum, after which the six-branched yoga, as instructed by the guru, is meditated upon. The winds of each channel then enter the central channel to induce the unchanging bliss. The yogi is protected from illness and death and accom­plishes the supreme siddhi. This process is taught in the lines, “How? ‘By the instruction of the guru.’” The instruction of the guru is the six- branched yoga and that will bring protection from death.”To summarize: from the fifty-third verse through to half of the sixtieth verse of the Inner chapter of the Condensed Tantra, the tantra and com­mentary teach the application of the deities of the Root Tantra and Con­densed Tantra to the channels of the body, as illustrated by the quote:“Sakti” and so forth teach the number of Kalacakra gods and goddesses. The assembly of deities is in the nature of the vari­ous channels of the six cakras.158[281] This meditative application teaches a generation stage in which the channels are visualized as being deities or concentrated on as purifiers. The purpose of these meditations is taught by three quotes:The yogi, who is “the glorious Manjuvajra, destroys the fears of"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"samsara, and this alone creates a buddha.” This determines thearising of deities of the Root Tantra and Condensed Tantra,159Two previous quotes run, “the fear of death will be destroyed. To the yogi this is nothing special” and “These the yogi protects in the body.” The attainments taught in these quotes depend upon the winds being held in the central channel. This actually occurs during the six-branched yoga of the completion stage. However, to create such a completion stage, the mind must definitely be ripened by the generation stage. Therefore the main purpose of the generation stage is to ripen the mind, which then becomes the main cause of the creation of the special completion stage in which the winds are held within the central channel. Therefore, if the words of these quotes from the tantra and commentary are correctly understood, the maligning of the generation stage as not being a cause of enlightenment is easily refuted. A complete generation stage acting as a ripening agent of the mind in order to create the special completion stage must come first in the sequence of generation and completion stages, and it is in order to make this very clear that the meaning of these quotes has been explained. This has been just a brief explanation of how certain doubts arising at this point can be cleared up.The meditations that follow the previously explained emanations of the desire and nondesire goddesses are discussed in the Great Commentary by the lines “In the nature of the five kinds of gnosis” until “are initiated for compassion.”160 [282] From the heart of oneself as the conqueror Kalacakra, who has the nature of the five kinds of gnosis, light rays emanate to bring into the mandala every sentient being of the six types. Light rays again emanate from one’s heart to summon Vairocana and the other mother- and-father tathagatas and to place them in one’s heart. There the fire of desire arising from oneself in mother-and-father embrace melts the mother- and-father tathagatas into bodhicitta, which then flows to the secret area and from one’s vajra to initiate the sentient beings. Every sentient being touched by these bodhicitta light rays is transformed into a deity having three or a varying number of faces. Their essence is method and wisdom, and they are filled with the happiness of the supreme joy. W ith a brief glance these sentient beings become of the nature of the body-mandala assembly. Then they are focused upon in sequence, which involves the fol­lowing. To their seed syllable ksa is added the vowels a, i, r, u, /in both long338 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Resolving Doubts Concerning the Process o f Generation 339and short form, the Five guna letters plus am, the five vrddhi'G1 letters plus ah, and the five semivowels in short and long form.162 These thirty-two syl­lables merge into their winds and reemerge as thirty-two deities. The five aggregates of these sentient beings become the five tathagatas, their five elements become the five mothers, the twelve inner and outer sources become the twelve male and female bodhisattvas, their five action faculties become the five wrathful guardians, and the activities of the five action faculties become the fierce females. These deities then travel to their respec­tive buddha realms. This meditation is a compassion initiation and corre­lates with one’s deeds as a buddha and not to normal existence. On this meditation the Great Commentary says:The letter of the whole consonant group is ksa. Therefore what­ever the first consonant of the name, this covers all.163This means that the letter ksa is a combination of the first consonant ka and the last consonant sa, which is changed to the retroflex /. This conjunct cov­ers the whole range of consonants, and therefore, when all sentient beings are visualized and initiated as one, ksa becomes the seed syllable, and the first consonant of the name of the deities also becomes a seed syllable. [283] When individual beings are being initiated, the first consonant of that indi­vidual’s name becomes the seed syllable.How does the letter sa develop into retroflex sa?. The grammar texts say: “From the letter ka the following sa becomes sa.” Therefore sa is changed to sa. The letter ka, without its life-giving vowel a, is placed on top of the letter sa to become ksa.If this meditation is to be performed more extensively, every sentient being enters one’s heart, where they are melted into bodhicitta. They are brought into the mother’s womb, where the first consonant of every sen­tient being’s name becomes a seed syllable to be transformed into the deity. The rest of the meditation proceeds as before.This has been an explanation of the branch of the body-vajra approach, a meditation on the sovereign mandala, correlating with the formation of a body inside the womb."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"\"he Speech VajraThe branch of the speech vajra near accomplishment: A meditation on sovereign activities, correlating with birth and the engaging in the activities of the action facultiesThis has six outlines:1.

Purity meditationArousing by songAt the end of the nine months in the womb, the development of the body is complete, but the winds of the five mandalas, or the ten winds such as the life-sustaining wind, downwardly expelling wind, [284] and so forth are still rigidly bound inside the central channel, not entering or leaving through the upper and lower openings. However, in the tenth or “becom­ing” month, the winds operate through the upper openings, which results in the development of vocal capacity and in the engaging of consciousness with outer objects through the individual senses. At the end of the six­teenth year for males and the twelfth year for females, these beings will be able to engage in the joys of the movements of their elements. It is for these purposes that the winds of the four inner elements stir and encourage birth into the outside world. In correlation with that process, the mother-and- father main deities, who have dissolved and transformed into a drop, are encouraged to emerge by the four goddesses of the four elements.On the dissolution of mother and father, the Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"342. Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentOn the deity the letter ho is inscribed in the avadhutl path at the navel and crown. At the forehead is the body-vajra om, at the throat the speech-vajra ah, and at the heart the mind-vajra h u m.This arising of body, speech, and mind are of the characteristics of the moon, sun, and Rahu.164With oneself as the main deity, om appears at the forehead, ah at the throat, hum. at the heart, and hoti63 appears in the avadhutl at the navel and crown. This arising of the enlightened body, speech, and mind correlates with the left, right, and center channels of moon, sun, and Rahu in the womb. The Great Commentary continues:By the lights of gnosis of the letter hoh at the navel, dissolution and bliss is experienced. On the lotuses the body, speech, and mind vajras are melted by the passion for Prajna. In the line, “As well as the all-pervading vajra master,” the words “as well as” mean becoming like the moon together with Prajna.166The great passion of the embrace of the wisdom mother causes the candall fire of the navel letter hoh to blaze. Its rays of gnosis bring about great bliss in the main deity, the all-pervading Vajradhara of the three vajras, who then dissolves into a moonlike bodhicitta drop. This involves not only the main deity, because the words “as well as” indicate that the wisdom woman Visvamata and the eight s'akti also dissolve with the main deity.The arousing by song from this dissolution is performed as follows.[285] The four goddesses who perform the song arousal correlate with the winds of the four mandalas that encourage the unborn child’s birth into the outside world. The four goddesses are the mandala goddesses Locana, Mamakl, Pandara, and Tara. They are of the essence of earth, water, fire, and air and of equanimity, joy, compassion, and love. The objects to be aroused by their songs are the mother-and-father deities, who have dis­solved into a drop. This correlates with the point of birth, up to when the consciousness has been in a dream state since the seventh month. The Great Commentary says:Like consciousness in a dream being urged into the waking state, the goddesses, Locana and the others, urge for the sake of sen­tient beings.167"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 343The actual arousing from dissolution is found in Root Tantra verses quoted in the commentary. Locana arouses the gnosis vajra of the main conqueror with these words:I, Locana, mother of sentient beings,dwell in the “similar to cause” effect within the yogi168by the nature of my mandala.Arise, Kalacakra, fulfill my desire.169The meaning of these words is that I, Locana, the purified form of the ele­ment of earth, am the mother that produces the gnosis of the arya in sen­tient beings. My winds of the earth element are held unmoving in the avadhutl at the yogi’s navel. This brings about an effect similar to the cause, which means that the fluid travels from the jewel to the navel to produce the dwelling in great bliss. Therefore Kalacakra, gnosis vajra, arise from the fluid and fulfill my desires by emanating the deities of the gno­sis mandala.Mamakl arouses the body vajra with these words:I, Mamaki, the sister,dwell in the ripening within the yogiby the nature of my mandala.Arise, Kalacakra, fulfill my desire. 170[286] This means that I, Mamakl, the purified form of the element of water, am the sister showing the yogi the fortune of great bliss. I dwell within the ripened result that occurs during the yogi’s path of practice— the great bliss of the fluid reaching the water-element heart center. This bliss arises by my element of water holding the winds unmoving at the heart. Therefore Kalacakra, body vajra, arise from the fluid and fulfill my desires by ema­nating the deities of the water-element family.Pandara arouses the speech vajra:I, Pandara, the daughter,dwell in the personally created result within the yogi by the nature of my mandala.Arise, Kalacakra, fulfill my desire.171"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"344 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentI, Pandara, the purified form of the fire element, am the daughter, the granter of good qualities, who dwells in the personally created result172 that is the great bliss arising during the yogi’s path of practice when the fluid travels to the fire-element throat center. This arises because my element of fire holds the winds unmoving at the throat. Therefore, Kalacakra, in the nature of the speech vajra, arise from the fluid and fulfill my desires by emanating the deities of the fire-element family.Tara arouses the mind vajra:I, Tara, the niece,dwell in the eradication result within the yogiby the nature of my mandala.Arise, Kalacakra and fulfill my desire.173I, Tara, the purified form of the element of air, am the niece born from the sister that is the fluid held at the heart. I dwell in the eradication result that is the great bliss of the fluid having traveled from the throat to the crown during the yogi’s path of practice. This arises because my element of air holds the airs unmoving at the crown. Therefore Kalacakra, in the nature of the mind vajra, arise from the fluid and fulfill my desires by ema­nating the deities of the air-element family.How can the great bliss arising from the bodhicitta arriving at the crown be an eradication result? This differs from the other three and is similar to the unchanging bliss of the Buddha being equated with the nature body. Therefore there is no fault here.174 In unison all four goddesses sing:From the experiences of the emptiness mandala,with the thought to save sentient beings,great protector of sentient beings,emanate the mandalas of body, speech, and mind.175[287] This means that “You, mighty protector who shields sentient beings from suffering, with the greatly compassionate thought of bringing sen­tient beings out of samsara, emanate the deity assembly of the body, speech, and mind mandalas from your accomplishment and experience of the emptiness, or space, mandala that is the bliss of dissolution into fluid.” On this section of arousal by song, the Great Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 345The arousing is of two kinds. The first is to complete the winds; the second is for the completion of the joy at the end of the six­teenth year.176On the meaning of this quote, scholars (such as Kumâra)177 have said:Two kinds of arousal are taught: one for the completion of the winds, one for the completion of joy. Therefore it is evident that there also has to be a song arousal at the end of the drop yoga, but the lamas of the past only posited it once.The meaning, however, of the quote beginning “The arousing is of two kinds” is that there are two ordinary bases to which the arousal is directed. The first is the sentient being inside the womb being aroused to emerge into the outside world in order to complete the development of the winds flow­ing externally. The second is the fluid, which is aroused to travel to the opening of the organ in order to complete the development of the joy of element emission at the end of the sixteenth year of life. The dissolution song arousal correlates with the first. The subtle and drop yoga medita­tions that focus on joy correlate with the second kind of arousal, during which there is no dissolution of the main deity, and so arousal from disso­lution by song is not necessary. It is with this in mind that lamas of the past only posited it once.Arising and mandala generation[288] This is under two headings:1. Arising from the fluid into the forms of the main mother and father2. Emanation of the mandalasArising from the fluid into the forms of the main mother and fatherThe conqueror, well immersed in emptiness, is awoken by the four goddesses’ melodic arousal and sees all beings as like illu­sions. From the melted moon fluid arises a blue hüm, from that a five-pointed blue vajra, and from that arises the main deity in the form of Kalacakra, in essence Aksobhya. To indicate that, he"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"346 Part 4:. Sa dhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentwears the crown of Aksobhya and is embraced by Vajradhat- vlsvari Visvamata.As this passage from the Great Commentary indicates, the main deity embraced by Visvamata, who is in essence Vajradhatvisvarl, is generated together with the eight ¿akti and is followed by the other deities. Some assert the causal Vajradhara main deity of the sovereign mandala to be in essence Aksobhya and the Vajradhara of the sovereign activities to be of the nature of Vajrasattva. However, as evidenced by a previous quote, the tantra and commentary assert the causal Vajradhara to be of the nature of Vajra­sattva.178 Moreover that resultant Vajradhara is in the nature of Aksobhya, and that his consort is in the nature of Vajradhatvisvarl can be understood from the Great Commentary when it explains that the main deity mother- and-father samaya beings are of one taste with the gnosis beings:Here, in the generation yoga, in the stages of generation, “con­sciousness is together with space,” meaning together with Vajradhatvisvarl, “within the central lotus,” meaning the great bliss, and upon fire, moon, sun, Rahu or Kalagni, the samaya beings and the gnosis beings come to be of one taste.179In this passage, “consciousness” refers to Aksobhya, who is in the nature of consciousness. Any contradiction arising from the statement that this embrace has to be with different families can be resolved as previously explained.180 [289]Arising from the arousal by song into the forms of the main mother and father correlates with birth from the womb as a basis of purification.Emanation of the mandalasSome say, “Visualize that they enter their respective deities of the emanated gnosis, mind, speech, and body mandalas.” They maintain that the deities are emanated from the mother’s lotus and visualized as entering the deities dwelling on the base mandala who were emanated during the sovereign- mandala practice. That contradicts the Great Commentary quote begin­ning, “For the sake of the samaya mandala,”181 which states that the deity emanation in the sovereign activities is to the samaya mandala. Further­more the Great Commentary states:"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 347In the phrase “again the mandalas are manifested,” the word again means “as before.”182This quote also damages the above assertion, because it says that the deity emanation here is similar to that of the sovereign mandala. Therefore, after the main deity father and mother plus the sakti have been created during the sovereign-mandala meditations:By the power of method-and-wisdom union, the five mandala buddhas come to the space above and enter one’s body for the sake of the samaya mandala possessing the nature of the aggre­gates, elements, sources, and so forth. They come to the lotus of Prajna as mantras in the form of individual letters.183As this passage indicates, the sound of bliss that emanates from the main deity mother and father in union calls the male and female tathagatas of the nature of the five mandalas, and all the other deities placed in the previously emanated mandala up to the desire and nondesire goddesses, into the space above, and for the purpose of a samaya mandala, which is in the nature of the aggregates, elements, and sources, they enter one’s body, where they are melted by the fire of great bliss and sent to the mother’s lotus. There in the form of the individual letters of the deities, they transform into the sym­bols of the different deities and then to the deities themselves, and are sent from the mother’s lotus to the base mandala. In the quote beginning, “Then in the lotus, as before,”184 the Great Commentary confirms that this has to be done as it was during the sovereign-mandala practice [290].Therefore deity emanation within the sovereign activities correlates with the moment immediately after birth when the fully developed body, still wrapped in the “clothes of the placenta,” clearly exists in the outside world. It starts to cry, and the ten winds, or winds of its five elements, engage with the outside. This is confirmed by the Great Commentary.As before, again the mandalas of mind, speech, and form, in the nature of method and wisdom, are emanated, and the new­born child awakens and cries.185Also:In the phrase “again the mandalas are manifested” the word"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"again means “as before.” W hen the child emerges from the womb, the ten winds, such as the life-sustaining and so forth, are born. When the disciples enter the mandala, flowers are scat­tered. The purification of “the naked child in the clothes of the placenta” is the completion of the mandala of the samaya deities.186Furthermore the lines beginning “Inside, the five mandalas flow \"also teach the objects of correlation and the bases for purification.Summoning the wisdom beings to enterAfter the desire and nondesire goddesses have been emanated, the wisdom beings are summoned. This is done by Vajravega, who is in essence the purified gnosis wind, as indicated by the line “The pure winds of the cen­tral channel, Vajravega.” His color and number of faces and hands are as described in the lines “of blue light” and so forth in the Methods of Accom­plishment chapter of the Great Commentary. He emerges in that form from a vajra, which in turn has emerged from hum, as indicated by the line “an emanation of hum and vajra.”187 “Arising from wisdom and method”188 indicates that he arises from the wisdom mother and the method father in embrace and is emanated from the lotus of the mother. On this the Great Commentary says:Here the winds of the central channel within the newborn child arise. They are of blue light. Their arising awakens the sense organs, and the six consciousnesses engage with external phe­nomena. This is the inner.189[291] Therefore the emanation of Vajravega correlates with the time when the fifty-six and a quarter gnosis winds in the central channel of the new­born child begin to flow. This awakens the sense organs, and the six con­sciousnesses engage with external objects. Concerning the emanation of Vajravega the Great Commentary says:Then from the lotus of the navel the winds emerge, summon external phenomena, and then return. Therefore the pure, stain­less light goes forth and decisively pierces with vajra hook the348 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 349navel of the mighty one of the wisdom assembly and binds his twenty-four arms with a vajra-serpent190 lasso. He frightens him with his weapons, gathers the wisdom assembly, moves the entire assembly of various phenomena, and then returns home.191As this passage says, this is a meditation in which the manifested Vajravega pierces with his vajra hook the navel of Kalacakra, the mighty one of the wisdom assembly and the principal deity of the wisdom beings. He binds Kalacakras twenty-four arms with his vajra-serpent lasso, summons the mighty one of the wisdom assembly by terrifying him with his other weapons, invokes the various deities of the mandala, and then returns to absorb into his abode within the heart of the main deity. This correlates with the time of birth when the life-sustaining wind emerges from the lotus of the navel cakra to summon the consciousnesses to their respective objects and then returns to the lotus of the navel cakra.The Great Commentary says, “The wisdom assembly is well served,”192 meaning that offerings are made to the invited assembly of wisdom beings. It continues:Concerning the absorption, the consciousness of sight born from the foundation consciousness and the sense organ of sight is Jambhaka.And so on until:Meditate upon them as being of one taste.193[292] This states that after Vajravega has summoned the wisdom beings, one meditates that the wrathful protectors, Jambhaka, Stambhaka, Manaka, and Atibala, correlating respectively with the eye, body, tongue, and nose consciousnesses of the newborn, bring about the absorption, bind­ing, delight, and one-taste union, respectively, of the wisdom and samaya beings. At the same time, when summoning one utters ja h , when absorb­ing one utters hum, when binding one utters bam, when delighting one utters hoh, and when becoming of one taste one utters the syllable hi. These are to be said forcefully. The mudras are vajra hook, vajra, vajra noose, vajra and bell, and vajra staff respectively.Concerning the individual wisdom beings and samaya beings becoming"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"350 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentof one taste, the Great Commentary explains the one-taste merging as it occurs in the mind mandala from the line beginning “Here, in the yoga of generation” until “on the central lotus.”194 The merging of the body-man- dala wrathful protectors is described incidentally. The explanation of the merging of the remaining deities of the body and speech mandalas is left uncommented on as found in the Condensed Tantra, because it is deemed “easy to understand.” Those merging processes that are actually taught in the commentary can be understood by reading them, but the one-taste process as described in the “easy to understand” sections of the Condensed Tantra will be explained very briefly. The text from “The mandala born from speech” until “meditate also on the moon and sun on the earth man­dala”195 describes the one-taste merging from the remaining speech-mandala goddesses up to the wisdom and samaya merging of the sun and moon that rise over the land surrounding the mandala. Within this, of the main mother speech yoginls, Camundi196 in the east is embraced by Indra; Vaisnavi in the northeast is embraced by Brahma; Varahl in the south is embraced by Rudra, or I^vara; Sanmukhi in the southwest is embraced by Ganapati; Aindri in the west embraced by Nairtya, or Raksa; Brahman! in the northwest is embraced by Visnu; RudrI, or Isvari, in the north is embraced by Yama; and Laksmi in the northeast is embraced by Sanmukha.[293] Together with their entourage deities, they all undergo the one-taste merging of samaya and wisdom beings.A similar process occurs with the main mother-and-father lunar-day deities. To the right of the east gate in the center of the lotus, Raksa the asura king is embraced by Raksl. In the southeast Vayu is embraced by Pracandi. To the right of the south gate, Agni is embraced by Varunl. In the southwest Sanmukha is embraced by Laksmi. To the right of the west­ern gate, Devendra197 is embraced by Vayudevi. In the northwest Brahma is embraced by Vidyuti. To the right of the northern gate, Samudra, or Varuna, is embraced by Varahl. In the northeast Ganapati is embraced by Sanmukhi. To the left of the north gate, Rudra, or Isvara, is embraced by Gauri. To the left of the south gate, Yama is embraced by Yamari. To the left of the east gate, Visnu is embraced by Laksmi. To the left of the west gate, Yaksa is embraced by Yaksinl. Wisdom beings merge into these deities and their entourage and become of one taste.Outside the walls of the body mandala, on platforms in the four direc­tions, are the nagas. On the eastern platform, on air mandalas, stand Padma and Karkotaka. In the south, on fire mandalas, stand Vasuki and"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 351Sankhapala. In the north, on water mandalas, stand Kulika and Ananta. In the west on earth mandalas stand Taksaka and Mahapadma.Similarly the fierce females are in the grounds of the cemeteries. In the eastern cemetery called Pierced lives dog-faced Svanavaktra. In the southern cemetery called Blazing lives the pig-faced Sukarasya. In the northern ceme­tery called Putrid lives the tiger-faced Vyaghravaktra. In the western cemetery called W olf lives the wolf-faced Jambukasya. In the southeast­ern cemetery called Remainder lives the crow-faced Kakavaktra. In the southwestern cemetery called Unending War lives the vulture-faced Gridhavaktra. In the northwestern cemetery called Magical Food lives the hawk-faced Khagapativadana. In the northeastern cemetery called Death of the Foolish lives the owl-faced Ulukavaktra.The nagas are embraced by fierce females, and the fierce female moth­ers are embraced by nagas. [294] The embracing has to involve different families, and so those of the east and west mutually embrace, as do those of the north and south, southeast and northwest, southwest and northeast. This is the meaning of quotes from the Condensed Tantra that state:Similarly, on the earth mandala, in families, stand Taksaka and Mahapadma in the cemeteries with Svanavaktra and other fierce females as their wisdom consorts,who in turn stand with Padma and the others as their method consorts.Therefore it is with other families that they are paired for the highest bliss.198Therefore one should meditate on the nagas and fierce female mother-and- father samaya beings as being of one taste with the wisdom beings, and the samaya moon and sun as being of one taste with the wisdom moon and sun. This is a brief explanation of text from the Condensed Tantra deemed “easy to understand.”Sealing by familyThe Great Commentary says:Now “the crown” and so forth talks of the deities being sealed"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"352 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentby their families. Here in the mandala of the supreme original buddha, on the crown, “a vajra in the manner of two vajras crossed.” Why? Because consciousness and gnosis are perfectly united. Therefore gnosis is on consciousness and consciousness is on gnosis. On the heads of both is the mind vajra in robes and with crown protrusion, in lotus posture, with earth-touching mudra, giving the breath of the tathagatas. It is rejected that the essence family is sealed by the five families. This is because it is the creator of buddhas. Alternatively, because of the phenomena of gnosis and consciousness, the crown, in essence the five bud­dhas, sometimes seals. Thus it is ascertained.199[295] This passage has produced many differing explanations. Some schol­ars say that the phrase “On the heads of both” refers to the heads of the mother-and-father main deities. Some say it refers to Vajrasattva and Aksobhya. Concerning “the essence family,” some explain it as referring to the form of a monk. Some say it refers to Vajrasattva. Others say it means that the five families do not crown-seal themselves. However it will be explained as follows. When the six families are explained as those of the vajra family and so forth, Amoghasiddhi is of the sword family, Ratna­sambhava is of the jewel family, Amitabha is of the lotus family, Vairocana is of the wheel family, and Vajrasattva and Aksobhya are both of the vajra family. Therefore the commentary to the Condensed Tantra text, “a vajra in the manner of two vajras crossed” says, “Therefore gnosis is on con­sciousness” and so on. This teaches that Vajrasattva of the gnosis family and Aksobhya of the consciousness family are similar in that they both belong to the vajra family. Therefore they are crown-sealed by each other, and the heads of both Vajrasattva and Aksobhya are crown-sealed by mind-vajra Aksobhya in robes with crown protrusion and so on.The meaning of the lines beginning “It is rejected that the essence fam­ily” is that Vajrasattva is of the essence family, or gnosis-aggregate family, and he is not crown-sealed by the five families with crowns of tied-up hair, because the gnosis aggregate, or the subde clear-light mind, is the creator of all things in samsara and nirvana and, similarly, its purification in the form of Vajrasattva is the creator of buddhas.Concerning the line beginning “Alternatively, because of the phenom­ena,” in many translations “alternatively” is rendered as “however,” and in keeping with that translation, this line means that “However, because"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 353gnosis and consciousness are crown-sealed by each other, it is fitting that sometimes green Aksobhya, who is in essence the five buddhas, crown- seals a blue Vajrasattva.” “Thus” indicates that this is an exception.Having explained the way Vajrasattva and Aksobhya are crown-sealed, the Great Commentary continues:“On form is Aksobhya,” teaches enlightened mind in its aspect of enlightened form. “Becoming Vairocana holding a lotus” talks of the body, which expresses individual speech. “Holder of a mighty jeweled lotus” refers to blood. “In the crown of Amoghasiddhi the supreme jewel” teaches that from the blood arises flesh.200[296] This explains that the other four families are crown-sealed in the manner of the cause crown-sealing the result. Enlightened form arises from enlightened mind, and this body, or enlightened form, expresses speech. From water, which has the nature of Amitabha, arises blood. From blood arises flesh. Therefore, in order, Aksobhya seals Vairocana, Vairocana seals Amitabha, Amitabha seals Ratnasambhava, and Ratnasambhava seals Amoghasiddhi.The Great Commentary continues:“Vairocana and the deity to the left,” or Amitabha; Avinas'a, or Ratnasambhava; his son, or Amoghasiddhi; Vasin, or Aksobhya; Kalagni, or Vajrasattva: these in the nature of earth, water, fire, air, space, and gnosis, the ordinary aggregates are sealed by the pure aggregates with robes and crown protrusion. These six have crowns of tied-up hair.201Some just explain this passage as meaning that the six families with crowns of tied-up hair are sealed by the six families with crown protrusion and robes, but which family is sealed by which is not clear. Other scholars say that it is acceptable for the crown-sealing to be performed by any of them, because “The crown sealing is performed on the heads by the mind vajra as the emanation body in the form of a monk. This is done on the basis of being of identical nature, because the main deity, the five families, and all the others in the mandala are of one nature with Sakyamuni.” It appears that, according to this statement, the sealer with crown protrusion and"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"robes who seals the six families with crowns of tied-up hair is Sakyamuni. This contradicts the teaching that those with crown protrusion and robes who perform the sealing are of the same nature as the purified aggregates, as evidenced by the line [297] “the ordinary aggregates are sealed by the pure aggregates with robes and crown protrusion.”The Pundarika Transmission Sadhana states that Vairocana, Amitabha, Ratnasambhava, Amoghasiddhi, Aksobhya, and Vajrasattva with crowns of tied-up hair are crown-sealed respectively by Vairocana and the others with crown protrusion and robes.202 If this interpretation is followed, then to say that the line “It is rejected that the essence family” means that that the five families do not crown-seal themselves would be contradictory. There­fore the meaning of this line has to be as I have explained it above.The Great Commentary lines from “Alternatively, because of the phe­nomena of gnosis and consciousness” up to “In the crown of Amoghasid­dhi the supreme jewel” explains who crown-seals whom in the six families. Concerning the bodily form of those who seal and the bodily form of those who are sealed, an explanation is given in the lines that run from “The six have crowns of tied-up hair” up to “the ordinary aggregates with crowns of tied-up hair are sealed by the pure aggregates with robes and crown pro­trusion.” This passage teaches that the six pure aggregates or elements, sym­bolized by the six families with crown protrusion and robes, crown-seal the six bases of purification in the form of impure aggregates or elements, symbolized by the six families with crowns of tied-up hair. The passage should be explained in this way. Thus, for example, Aksobhya in the form of a monk crown-seals Vairocana in the form of one possessing a crown of tied-up hair.Concerning the crown-sealing of the remaining deities, the Great Com­mentary says:The head ornaments of the remaining gods and goddesses arecrowned by various jewels and by their respective families.203Therefore those belonging to one of the six families are sealed by the six families in enjoyment-body emanation. Furthermore, except for the sakti, black gods and goddesses who belong to a family are sealed by Amoghasid­dhi, red deities by Ratnasambhava, white by Amitabha, yellow by Vairo­cana, and green by Aksobhya. [298] The sakti and blue gods and goddesses are sealed by Vajrasattva.354 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 355Blessings o f body, speech, and mind The Great Commentary says:Here the body, speech, and mind of the newborn child are blessed to become the waking state, dreams, and sleep.204The blessing by enlightened body, speech, and mind is performed in cor­relation with the body, speech, and mind of the newborn child in the three states of waking, dreams, and deep sleep. Concerning the procedure the Great Commentary says:On the brow, throat, heart, navel, secret, and crown are om, ah, hum, hoh, sva, and ha. These are the stages of the blessings. As a mother washes her child, so the supreme lord is washed by the “goddesses,” or yoginls.205On the brow, throat, and heart center of the mother-and-father deities are om, ah, and hum respectively. At the navel of the mother is hoh, at her secret area sva, and on her crown hd. This is a synopsis of the blessing procedure. The explanation of the actual blessing starts from the next line in the Great Commentary, which begins “Here the blessing. First one meditates that the yoginls wash the main deity and supreme lord with vases of water. This cor­relates with the child being washed by its mother. Now the body, speech, and mind blessing begins. From an ah at the brow of both mother-and- father deities arise moon disks on which stand the syllable om. They trans­form into eight-spoked wheels, which in turn change into the white body-vajra deity in union with his wisdom consort. Their faces and hand implements are clearly described in the Great Commentary. [299] One med­itates that the body vajra emerges from the brow center to produce count­less replicas. They fill the realms of space, teaching the dharma to the sentient beings to be tamed by body vajra deities, and then return to merge into a sin­gle deity that stands before the meditator. One then makes the request, “Holder of the body vajra, grant me initiation.” Goddesses of the body fam­ily perform the actual initiation with vases of nectar. The body-blessing ini­tiation occurs when the visualized body vajra enters the moon disk at one’s brow and one recites the two verses beginning “Glorious holder of the body vajra.” The meaning of the first verse206 is as follows: “Glorious indivisible"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"gnosis held in the immutable body drop, holder of the body vajra.” This is an address to the deity. “By meditating on the indivisibility of the body, speech, and mind vajras during the practices of the path, you have actual­ized the body vajra. Bless me in the place upon the brow, grant me now the attainment of the body vajra.”207 The second verse follows the same pattern.In the speech blessing one visualizes the letter ra at the throats of mother- and-father main deity. This changes into a sun disk, on top of which is the syllable ah. That becomes a red lotus of eight petals, which in turn becomes the speech vajra, whose color, faces, hands, and hand symbols are clearly described in the Great Commentary and who is in union with his wisdom consort. He emanates to fill the realms of space and teaches those to be tamed by speech-vajra emanations, before returning as a single deity in front of oneself. One requests, “Holder of the vajra, grant me initiation,” and as before one visualizes that goddesses of the speech family come to bestow initiation. The speech vajra returns to the sun mandala at the throat, and one recites the two verses beginning “Glorious holder of the speech vajra.” The meaning of the verses is “Glorious indivisible gnosis held in and arising from the immutable speech drop, holder of the speech vajra.”208[300] This is an address to the deity. The remaining lines are similar to the previous verse except that “speech” is substituted for “body” and the place of blessing is the throat.In the mind blessing one visualizes a drop at the heart of both mother and father. This becomes a dark blue Ráhu mandala on top of which is the syllable hum. This transforms into a five-pointed vajra, which in turns becomes a black mind vajra in union with his wisdom consort and whose faces, hands, and implements are clearly taught in the Great Commentary. He emanates to fill the realms of space, where the emanations teach dharma to those who are to be tamed by mind-vajra emanations, and then returns to become a single deity in front of the meditator, who requests, “Holder of the mind vajra, grant me initiation.” Goddesses of the mind family bestow initiation. The mind blessing occurs when the mind vajra returns to the Ráhu mandala and one recites the two verses of request that begin, “Glorious holder of the mind vajra.” The meaning of the verses is “Glori­ous indivisible gnosis held in and arising from the immutable speech drop, holder of the mind vajra.”209 This is an address to the deity. The remain­ing lines are similar to the previous verse except that “mind” is substituted for “body” and the place of blessing is the heart.After the mind blessing one recites the mantra om sarva tathdgata kdya356 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishment"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 357vaka citta svabhdva dtmako ham. The meaning of this mantra is “I the yogi hold the pride of being of the nature of the body, speech, and mind of all the tathagatas.” This is because om at the beginning heads the mantra; sarva means all; kdya means body; vaka means speech; citta means mind; svabhdva means nature; atm akah means self; ah am means I. In the mantra, ko ham is a product of amalgamation.210 The Kalapasutra says:Between the letters a it becomes u; between a and voiced letters also.211[301] Thus the visarga between the life-giving letter a of the letter ka and the voiced letter ha becomes the letter u.On the letter u it becomes the letter 0.Thus the life-giving a of ka becomes 0.

Concerning the individual blessings from the mother, the Great Commentary says:Similarly the letter hoh at the navel of the wisdom consort.213The blessings from the wisdom consort are granted by the letter hoh at her navel, sva in her secret area, and ha at her crown. The reason why there are three blessings from the father and six from the mother is mentioned in the Great Commentary:From the fluid phenomena there are three of method. From the blood and fluid phenomena there are six of wisdom.214Purity meditationThis is under two headings:1. Meditating on the purity of the celestial mansion2. Meditating on the purity of the resident deities"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"358 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentMediating on the purity of the celestial mansionThere are two types of celestial mansion purity. Purity as applied to the body is taught in the first summary of the Gnosis chapter and can be ascer­tained there. Here in the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, the purity of phenomena without obscuration is taught. When the celestial palace was described, the explanation was purely descriptive, but here the pur­pose is meditation, and so the meanings of that description need to be explained. The purity of the celestial mansion is taught in order to reverse the perception that the deities and the celestial mansion are separate enti­ties, like the ordinary world and its inhabitants. The purity of the deities is taught in order to reverse the perception that because the main deities, their entourage— males and females and so on— have different forms, they must be different beings. [302] Therefore here meditation is important.On the purity of the celestial mansion, the Great Commentary quotes from the Root Tantra:Mind, speech, and body mandalas of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; four vajra lines of the four places of Brahma; the perfect squares of the four foundations of mindfulness; twelve gates of the twelve limbs; similarly the beautiful portals of the twelve levels; cremation grounds of the eight directions of the eight limbs of the noble path; pillars of the sixteen kinds of emptiness; the walls of the elements; the eight porch walls of the eight freedoms; the facing and side-door walls of the eight material qualitiesdivided among mind, speech, and body;five pure colors of the five aggregates of morality, etc.;three surrounding walls of the three vehicles,five surrounding walls of the forces of faith and so on,five surrounding walls of the powers of faith and so on,of the mandalas of mind, speech, and body;mandala terraces of concentrations and dharani;beautiful jeweled friezes of the ten perfections completed;"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 359double and single crystal garlands of the eighteen exclusive dharmas; the baguli of the powers; the kramasirasa of the virtues, filled with the chimes of freedoms such as emptiness, filled with victory banners of magical power concentrations, shining with mirrors of the eradications; the moving yaktail fans of the limbs of enlightenment; decorated by the garlands of the nine branches; adorned by the corner crossed vajras of the four ways of gathering; decorated by the jewels of the four truths on the gates and porch walls; encircled constantly by the five great circles of the fivefold clairvoyance; surrounded by the vajra garland of omniscient enlightenment; the iron fence of the one bliss; similarly the vajra flames of gnosis; the constant moon and sun of wisdom and method; the dharma wheel, great vase, great drum, and bodhi tree mind of mind, speech, body, and purity; likewise the wish-fulfilling jewel, and so on.This is the glorious Kalacakra dharmadhâtu.215[303] The Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are the mind, speech, and body mandalas respectively.

The eight material qualities devoid of obscuration, which are the pure forms of earth, water, fire, air, smell, form, taste, and touch, are the eight facing door walls of the three mandalas. The pure forms of the three sun qualities of activity, dark­ness, and lightness,219 and the five moon qualities of sound, smell, taste, touch, and form, are the eight side-door walls of die three mandalas. The five pure aggregates of morality, meditative concentration, wisdom, free­dom, and the gnosis of freedom are the five colors. The three pure vehicles of Hearer, Solitary Realizer, and Mahayana are the three surrounding walls of the mind mandala. The pure forms of the five forces of faith, effort, memory, meditative concentration, and wisdom are the five surrounding walls of the speech mandala. The pure forms of the five powers of faith, effort, memory, meditative concentration, and wisdom are the five sur­rounding walls of the body mandala.

The ten pure perfections are the jeweled friezes stud­ded and beautifully decorated with precious stones. The eighteen pure and exclusive qualities of a buddha are represented by the single and double hanging jeweled net garlands. The ten pure powers: namely, power over life, karma, necessities, wishes, prayers, dharma, mind, birth, magical cre­ation, and gnosis, are the p h akuli,220 or ornamented guttering.

The purification of the seven limbs of enlightenment, namely, memory, analysis, effort, joy, pliancy, medita­tive concentration, and equanimity, are the yaktail fans.

The puri­fied forms of the four ways of gathering disciples, namely, giving, kind words, according with disciples’ behavior, and according with disciples’ wishes, are the decorative crossed vajras in the corners of the celestial man­sion. The purified forms of the four truths of suffering, source, path, and cessation are the four jewels that decorate the gates and porch walls. The purified forms of the fivefold clairvoyance, namely, celestial sight, celestial hearing, knowing the minds of others, remembering past lives, and knowl­edge of magical powers, are the five great surrounding circles, such as the earth circle and so on. The pure omniscient enlightenment is the outer encirclement by the vajra garland. [305] The vajra-garlanded iron fence is in essence the uncontaminated great bliss. Similarly the vajra flames are in essence the five kinds of gnosis. The pure form of wisdom is the moon constantly shining in the northeast, and the pure form of method is the sun constantly shining in the southwest. The pure forms of the mind, speech, body, and gnosis vajras are respectively the wheel of dharma, the great vase, the great drum, and the Bodhi tree that stand on ledges within the body mandala. The pure forms of the four vajras are also the wish-fulfilling jewel, wish-fulfilling tree, dharma gong, and dharma conch that stand within the great bliss mandala.Therefore this is a meditation to reveal these various aspects of the base mandala as the definitive and pure dharmadhatu mandala of glorious Kalacakra, endowed to perfection with every possible obscuration-free excellence.Meditating on the purity of the resident deitiesThis is in two sections:1. Channel purity2. Aggregate and sphere purityChannel purityThis is taught in verse 101 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the Condensed Tantra, from the line beginning “The vases and the eight, such as Dhuma, are the dharma wheel at the heart” until “the finger joints.”223 This is explained as follows. The purified forms of the eight channel petals"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"362 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentof the heart are the eight vases and the eight s'akti. The purified forms of the sixteen channel petals at the brow are the four male tathagatas with consorts and the four female tathagatas with consorts. The purified forms of die four channel petals at the crown are the dharma conch, the jewel, the dharma gong, and the wish-fulfilling tree. The purified forms of the thirty- two channel petals of the throat are the six male bodhisattvas with consorts, the six female bodhisattvas with consorts, and the four wrathful protectors with consorts. The purified forms of the sixty-four channel petals of the navel are the sixty-four goddesses, such as Bhlma and so on, of the speech mandala. The purified forms of the thirty-two channel petals of the secret area are the eight main goddesses, Camundi and so on, of the speech man­dala and the eight offering goddesses, Lasya and so on, each in method and wisdom aspect to make thirty-two. The purified forms of the 360 chan­nel petals arrived at by totaling the thirty petals on each of the twelve cakras of the twelve major arms and leg joints, are the 360 lunar-day deities. [306] The purified forms of the two sets of thirty cakras on the finger and toe joints plus the two sets of two pervading channels are the sixteen figures of the eight nagas and eight fierce females divided up twice into method and wisdom to make two sets of thirty-two.Aggregate and sphere purityThis is taught in the second half of verse 102 of the Methods of Accom­plishment chapter of the Condensed Tantray from the line beginning “Time in its pure form is the vajra holder” up to “The body hairs are the host of spirits in the cemeteries.”224 This is explained as follows. External time is the sun moving through the twelve houses, while internal time is the cause- and-effect phenomena of the twelve links of dependent origination. In their purified form these become the vajra holder Kalacakra, the main deity of the mandala. The way the twelve links of dependent origination are causes and effects is explained by the Great Commentary:Internally the twelve links of the cycles of houses, Capricorn and so forth, are of the nature of cause and effect. Five are causes, seven are effects. The causes have the nature of afflictions and karma. The effects have the nature of suffering. This is taught in the Realms chapter.225"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 363Thus ignorance, compositional karma, grasping, taking, and becoming are causes. Consciousness, name and form, the six sources, contact, feeling, birth, and aging and death are all effects. The way that one circles in sam- sara within these causes and effects is as follows. Affliction and karma drive the cycle of samsara. From the twelve links, ignorance, grasping, and tak­ing are afflictions, while compositional karma and becoming are karma. The link of becoming is the point when the seeds of karma gain in strength to develop the capacity to create a new birth and, therefore, is not actually karma but is merely labeled as such.The way these effects are produced from these causes is as follows. Because of ignorance, virtuous and nonvirtuous compositional karma is accumulated. [307] This compositional karma, which is capable of creat­ing the links from consciousness to feeling through the process of impelling,226 plants seeds on the mindstream. These seeds, nourished by the link of grasping and then by the link of taking, both of which have the nature of attachment, grow in strength and form the link of becoming, which has the capacity to create a future birth. From the link of becoming comes the link of consciousness that has just linked to a mother’s womb. From consciousness arises name and form, the six sources, contact, and feeling, all arising from preceding links. The moment of the consciousness linking to a mother’s womb is known as birth, and the process of moving from name and form to feeling is labeled aging. Death is posited as the cessation of life.The above is the thinking of the tantra and commentary and therefore is at one with the thinking of Master Nagarjuna when he says in his Verses on the Essence o f Dependent Origination:Two come from three, seven come from two, and three come from seven;this wheel of existence turns again and again.227During the deity emanations of the sovereign-mandala deity, when a cor­relation is made with the ordinary base, the passage beginning “Ignorance, compositional karma, and consciousness” teaches that the length of time in the womb is applied to the links of dependent origination, in which the"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"364 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentnames of the links are given to the months of pregnancy. The reason for this is as follows. As previously explained, the month of conception, regard­less of what the actual month might be, is known as the month of Capri­corn. Seven months on from then, the winds are created in the navel channel petals, and therefore that month is known as the month of Can­cer. Because of this the month of conception is known as the month of ignorance, and the following months of pregnancy are named composi­tional karma, consciousness, and so on. The reason why Capricorn is the month of ignorance is that when the twelve links of dependent origination and the twelve zodiacal months are assigned to each other as an internal and external correlation, the first of the twelve links and the first zodiacal month of pregnancy have to be assigned to each other, [308] and in this part of the generation stage, the Great Commentary co m m en ts, “Internally, the zodiac cycle of Capricorn and so on are the twelve links,” while in verse 112 of the Realms chapter of the Condensed Tantra it says, “Ignorance is in the month of Pusya when the sun enters Capricorn.”228The cessation of the twelve links of dependent origination is Vis'vamata. The Great Commentary states:Similarly the cessation of the twelve links is the pure Prajna.229The purified forms of the eight channels at the heart, which are the sup­ports for the equalizing wind and so on, are the eight s'akti, Dhuma and so forth. The purified forms of the two parts of the central channel, avadhutl above and sankhini below, are the two other ¿akti, Jnanaparamita of the gnosis element, symbolized by the visarga, and Prajnaparamita of the space element, symbolized by the drop.The ending of pride and the three poisons is Rudra under the left foot. The ending of the four kinds of maras, namely mental afflictions, lord of death, the aggregates, and Devaputra, is Mara under the right foot. The ending of obstructions to the body is the conch. The ending of obstructions to speech is the gong. The ending of obstructions to mind is the jewel. The ending of obstructions to gnosis is the wish-fulfilling tree. The cessa­tion of the right and left bone marrow is represented by the two vases in the east. Assigning left and right to the following also, the cessation of blood is symbolized by the two vases of the south.

The purified forms of the 360 breaths of one hour and the 360 days of one year are the 336 entourage deities of the lunar-day deities plus the twelve consorts of the lunar-day deities and the twelve goddesses of the mind mandala, Lasya and so forth. The pure forms of the thirty-two chan­nel petals of the secret area are the eight nagas and eight fierce females, each in method and wisdom aspect, to make thirty-two.In terms of their qualities, the purified and unobstructed forms of bod­ily actions, such as digging in the earth, are the thirty-six desire goddesses"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"3 66 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentand the thirty-six nondesire goddesses. Hairs in their purified forms are the siddhas. The purified forms of the thirty-five million pores are the thirty-five million elementals in the cemeteries.[310] In the purity of the base mandalas and dependent deities as explained here, the purified and untainted forms of the aggregates and so on appear in the forms of these mandalas and deities. On this point, there are those phenomena that actually exist as the base mandalas and depend­ent deities and those that, while not actually existing that way, are medi­tated on as being so. The first type is illustrated by Sakyamuni in the form of the Kalacakra, lord of the mandala, manifesting the body, speech, and mind mandalas of the Kalacakra mandala. For the second type, the gener- ation-stage meditator dwells in the pride of being Kalacakra, lord of the mandala, visualizing and meditating upon the bases of purification, such as the aggregates, channels, and so forth, appearing as the pure and untainted phenomena of the base mandalas and dependent deities. This is the mean­ing of the meditation upon the purity of the base mandalas and depend­ent deities. Therefore, when the Great Commentary says, “W ith the cessation of the elements, the pure other elements arise”230 and “The other forms and so forth, the other eyes and so forth,”231 the term other in this context must refer to the aspects of the base mandalas and dependent deities that appear to the mind of the generation-stage practitioner. In particular the Great Commentary says:W hen conventional phenomena have ceased, there are other compositional factors and so forth. Therefore the pure compo­sitional factors are Amoghasiddhi, the end of obscuration to compositional factors.232“Other compositional factors” of this passage indicates the generation-stage deity that the aggregate of compositional factors is to be visualized as. The phrase “and so forth” refers to “other feelings” and “other recognition,” which indicate the generation-stage deities that the aggregates of feeling and recognition are to be visualized as. The reason why this has to be the explanation of the term other is stated in the part of the quote beginning “Therefore the pure compositional factors are Amoghasiddhi.” The Amoghasiddhi mentioned here must be the generation-stage deity Amoghasiddhi, because this part of the tantra and commentary deals with"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"The Speech Vajra 367the purity meditation of the generation stage. This reasoning can be applied to the other phenomena of the purity meditation also.Furthermore the Great Commentary, on the forty-seventh verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:Here the emanation and withdrawal of the world-realm outer, the bodily inner, and imputed other mandalas.233[311] The “other” mandalas mentioned here clearly refer to the base man­dalas and dependent deities imputed or mentally conceived during the gen­eration stage.

A brief description of the assertions of others and examination of their validity2. Our own assertionsA brief description o f the assertions o f others and examination of their validitySome scholars (such as the master Kumara233) assert the subtle and drop yogas as taught here to be both generation-stage and completion-stage med­itations. They maintain that the generation stage involves relying upon an activity mudra consort to move the drop to the jewel and then to draw it up by the power of the winds. This “waterwheel” descent and ascent is practiced again and again until the worldly innate bliss becomes stable. This, they maintain, is the drop yoga of the generation stage, while drop yoga and subtle yoga using a mahamudra consort are yogas of the com­pletion stage. They also explain the Root Tantra line “A qualified consort aged sixteen” as teaching the six-branched yoga.It is not correct to say that the practice of relying on an activicy mudra consort to move the drop down to the jewel and then through the force of the winds to draw it up again to produce innate bliss is a generation-stage meditation, because the development of such an innate bliss requires the ability through yoga to move the winds into the central channel, and the innate bliss produced from the winds entering the central channel cannot be a generation-stage practice. This is because a method for moving the"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"370 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmentwinds into the central channel is not taught in the generation stage, [312] and the yoga in which the bodhicitta element ascends and descends again and again like a waterwheel using the power of the winds must be within the completion stage.Furthermore it is hard to understand how the line “A qualified consort aged sixteen”236 teaches the six-branched yoga. The Great Commentary says:In the generation stages the completion of the enlightened body is within the sovereign mandala. The completion of enlightened speech is within the sovereign activities, because the action fac­ulties engage in activity. The completion of the drops of bod­hicitta is within the drop yoga. Bliss arising from the movement of the fluid is within the subtle yoga.237This passage explains that the subtle and drop yogas as taught here are gen­eration-stage practices, and the Root Tantra line “A qualified consort aged sixteen”238 is quoted here as scriptural authority for this way of meditating on the subtle and drop yoga at this time.Our own assertionsThis is under two headings:1. Correlation with bases of purification2. An explanation of the practice based upon Root Tantra quotes Correlation with bases of purificationWhen a child reaches the age of sixteen, the power of his white element is complete. Seeking the bliss that comes from emission offhe drop, he takes a bride and leads her by the hand and so forth. In correlation with this the vajra master gives a wisdom mudra consort to the student during the ini­tiation. Yogis meditating on the subtle and drop yogas will rely upon an activity or wisdom mudra consort as appropriate. In normal existence, from the age of sixteen onward, a man sits in union with a mudra, and the com­mon candall fire blazes from the secret area. The drop melts and gradually descends from the crown to the tip of the organ, thereby increasing the bliss. In correlation with this the bodhicitta element descends from the crown to the tip of the vajra through reliance on one of the two types of"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The M ind Vajra 371mudras and produces the four joys, which are applied to meditation upon emptiness. This is drop yoga meditation.An explanation of the practice based upon Root Tantra quotesThe teachings from the tantra and commentary on the meditations of the subtle and drop yogas of the generation stage in this part of the text are intended for the primary disciples of the tantra. [313] These are jewellike persons destined in one life to actualize the state of Vajradhara. They com­plete the deity yoga of the coarse generation stage and then meditate on the subtle and drop yogas. The explanation from the tantra, therefore, is given on this basis. Such a person enters the practice of drop yoga by relying upon one of the two types of consort. If he uses an activity consort, the Root Tantra says:A qualified consort aged sixteen, adorned with youth and beauty; teach her well,then initiate and begin the practice.239A mudra consort should be sought. She should have all the right charac­teristics of youth and beauty and be between the ages of twelve and twenty, as indicated by the phrase “aged sixteen.” She should be taught thoroughly the fundamental points of practice, receive initiation, be given tantric vows, and be instructed in the deity-yoga meditation. Then the practice of drop yoga can begin. What is the procedure of practice?Body, speech, mind, and desire, placed at the brow and so forth, svd, ha, at the secret and crown.240Oneself is clearly visualized as main-deity Kalacakra, and the activity con­sort or wisdom consort as Vis'vamata. At the brow, heart, throat, and navel of both mother and father are placed the om body vajra, the ah speech vajra, the hum mind vajra, and the hoh gnosis vajra. The syllable svd is placed in the secret area and ha at the crown. Next is the purification of the secret space:"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"372 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentThen the lotus is purified.241This is an introduction. The next lines teach the actual purification:From the syllable ah, an eight-petal lotus; by the syllable hum , it is with vajra; the cause of movement of the wisdom lotus with vajra, one’s vajra by the syllable hum visualized with five points; in its center an eight-petal lotus conceived with the syllable dh.2A1From the nonapprehension of the secret area of the consort arises the let­ter dh. This becomes a lotus of eight petals. Its center is “with vajra,” which means marked with a vajra that arises from or “by the syllable b u m ? Then “by the syllable hum or from a hum within the nonapprehension of one’s secret area while clearly visualizing oneself as the main deity, a vajra “visu­alized with five points,” which is “the cause of movement of the wisdom lotus with vajra.” [314] In the center of this vajra is an eight-petal lotus “conceived with the syllable a h f meaning visualized as arising from the syllable dh. That is the purification of the secret organs. Now the practice:W ith the pride of vajra holder, the vajra with lotus enters the lotus.With lingam placed into the bhaga, the yogi performs hum phat; the bodhicitta is not emitted.243One’s own secret-area five-pointed vajra marked with a lotus enters the consort’s lotus. Within that state the yogi holds the pride of being the vajra holder main-deity Kalacakra, he utters the syllables hum phat, and dwells within the activity of union arising from placing the father’s lihgam into the mother’s bhaga. This brings the elemental bodhicitta drop down to the tip of the jewel, where it is not to be emitted.The way the bodhicitta travels down from the crown to the tip of the jewel during this union and how the four joys are created from that process is taught in the next lines:"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"The M ind Vajra 3 7 3At the navel the candall fire blazes, the five tathagatas are burnt,Locana, eyes, etc., are burnt,the ham moon syllable fallswith the characteristics of nectar fluid,in the form of a drop it descends.This is drop yoga.244These lines can be explained in accord with the Condensed Tantra and com­mentary. W hen meditating on the coarse generation stage, seventy-two channel petals, consisting of the twelve zodiac channel petals of the navel cakra and the sixty channel petals that carry the sixty mandala winds, are purified and blessed by meditation upon seventy-two yoginls of the speech mandala. From these and from mother and father in union, the candall fire blazes, and at the emanation navel cakra, the mandala winds of the five tathagatas, Vairocana and so forth, on the left, the five mandala winds of- Locana and so forth on the right, the five sense organs of the eyes arid so forth, the five objects of form and so forth, are all “burnt,” [315] meaning that they are temporarily halted from performing their individual func­tions. The moon bodhicitta arises from the syllable ham at the crown and falls. The nectar fluid in the form of a drop descends from the crown to the tip of the jewel. It descends from the crown to the throat to produce joy. Falling from the throat to the heart, it produces supreme joy. Falling from the heart to the navel, it produces special joy. Falling from the navel to the secret area or tip of the jewel, it produces innate joy. These four joys of descent are applied to emptiness to create bliss-and-emptiness yoga.

Another reason why this must be so is that if the candali that melts the bodhicitta were the inner candali of the sankhinichannel, the four joys at this juncture would have to be the four joys of the bodhicitta descending within the central channel, and those four joys are only found in comple- tion-stage practice and not in the generation stage."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"e Gnosis VajraThe branch of gnosis-vajra great accomplishment: A meditation on the subtle yoga correlating with the completion of bliss at the age of sixteenSixteen, half and half“7 holding the drop, partless beyond parts,held at the peak of the four meditative absorptions.“8 This is the subtle yoga.“’[316] The meaning of these Root Tantra lines is explained by the Great Commentary in the lines beginning:“Dwelling in the pure wisdom250 the bodhicitta again,” means, as it arrives so it returns.251The commentary states that the drop descends to the tip of the jewel and travels back up again in the manner of its descent. Traveling from the secret area to the navel as a similar-to-cause result, the meditative absorption of joy is experienced. Traveling from the navel to the heart as a ripening result, the meditative absorption of supreme joy is experienced. Traveling from the heart to the throat as a personally created result, the meditative absorption of special joy is experienced. Traveling from the throat to the brow as an eradication result, the meditative absorption of innate joy is experienced. The four joys are mixed with emptiness, and the resulting bliss-and-empti- ness yoga is the “subtle yoga great accomplishment.”The root text from “A wisdom consort aged sixteen” until “This is the subtle yoga” teaches mainly the generation-stage subtle and drop yogas.252 The lines from “moving up, similar to the cause, etc.” up to “yoga, medita­"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"376 Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f Accomplishmenttive absorptions, and so on”253 teach the completion stage. On this point, some people, imagining it to be the position of the Pundarika Transmission Sadhana, say:The drop-yoga simulation practice of the generation-stage prac­titioner can be understood from the actual teaching of the com- pletion-stage drop yoga found in the lines beginning “At the navel the candall fire blazes.”254Such statements contradict the Pundarika Transmission Sadhana. A pas­sage of the Sadhana that runs from “Urged by the downwardly expelling wind of the candall” to “The moonlike melted drop form arrives at the throat from the crown to create joy”255 [317] comments on the root text from “At the navel the candall fire blazes” until “in the form of a drop, it descends,” in accord with its the literal meaning. After that it goes on to say:Even during the generation stage the candall blazes, causing the element to actually melt. From this arises the generation-stage four joys applied to emptiness to produce a true bliss and empti­ness. This causes the element mandalas and the entire three realms to arise vividly before the mind as the sport of bliss and emptiness in the form of the deities and mandalas.256This is stated in the Sadhana, and the above assertion, therefore, would contradict it.257The reason why the lines beginning “At the navel the candall fire blazes” express such a literal meaning during the subtle and drop yoga practices of the generation stage is as follows. When the primary and jewellike disciple of the tantra and commentary has completed the coarse generation stage, whatever he visualizes will vividly appear as if it were the actual object. Divine pride will transfer to wherever it is placed, the mind will not wan­der from whatever object it is placed upon, and will remain with a real or contrived peaceful abiding. In such circumstances the activity mudra con­sort is visualized as Vi^vamata. If a wisdom mudra consort is used, she is visualized as an actual person, real enough to touch. The visualized sexual union also appears as real, and the bodhicitta is able to travel from the crown to the tip of the jewel. W ith a vivid meditation of the syllable p h a t at the opening of the jewel, the bodhicitta emission is stopped. W ith a"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"The Gnosis Vajra 377clear and firm visualization of the stopped bodhicitta being drawn upward, the meditator is able to draw it back to the crown.These particular subtle and drop yogas are special ripening practices that develop into an actual completion stage in which the special candall fire inside the central channel stops the winds of the left and right channels and is itself fanned by the winds that enter the central channel. The bodhicitta arisen from the syllable ham at the crown moves through the central chan­nel to create the four or sixteen joys of descent and ascent. [318] With this in mind the Great Commentary says:It is taught that the undeveloped accomplish that bliss through the activity mudra consort. The middling practitioner relies upon a wisdom consort. The supreme yogi uses a mahamudra consort.258Therefore, having explained the kinds of mudra consort that can induce the four joys of generation-stage subtle and drop yogas, the commentary says “the undeveloped accomplish that bliss through the activity mudra consort. The middling practitioner relies upon a wisdom consort.” Immediately after this line, it says, “The supreme yogi uses a mahamudra consort,” thereby teaching the exclusive mahamudra consort that induces completion-stage supreme unchanging bliss. In the Root Tantra also, immediately after the line “This is the subtle yoga,” the texts talks of the completion stage.If this yogi uses an activity mudra and wisdom mudra to bring the bod­hicitta to the tip of the jewel for the four joys of descent and then to draw it up to the crown for the four joys of stable ascent, what is the meaning of the following lines from the Great Commentary*The activity mudra is she who grants the falling bliss. The wis­dom mudra is she who grants the moving bliss.259A ctivity mudra here refers to the power of a mudra consort lacking skillful means who grants the bliss of emission. A wisdom mudra merely grants the bliss of the bodhicitta element moving throughout the parts of the body. Therefore there is no contradiction here. Those who have not completed the coarse generation stage do not have the abilities of those who have, and they should practice by way of simulation."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"37B Part 4: Sadhana: Methods o f AccomplishmentMantra RecitationAfter the meditations of the subtle yoga come the mantra recitations, offer­ings, tasting the nectar, and the requests to return.

An enemy vowel brings death. An enemy consonant brings illness.261This means that if the vowel of the first letter of the name of the deity of practice and the vowel of the first letter of the name of the practitioner are enemies, there is the danger that the practitioner will die. If the two first consonants of practitioner and deity are enemies, there will be a risk of ill­ness. If the first letters of the names of deity and practitioner are friends, regardless of whether they are vowels or consonants, the practitioner will become the deity of that practice.

Concerning piercing, the text continues:Emptiness with visarga added before the mantra, pierced by the king of weapons, and attained while unconscious.278“Emptiness with visarga,” meaning the element of space-letter ha with a visarga, is added “before the mantra,” meaning on top of the first letter of the mantra, and recited.

Then fire offerings of one tenth of the recitations are offered. After that ten million speech vajra recitations of the deity’s whole name mantra are performed, and fire offerings of one tenth of the recitations are performed.

If these conditions are not met, the activities will not be accomplished. The text continues:All activities of other families, other rituals, other times, mantra families, places, directions, and seats, will produce no result.290On this point, the Great Commentary, on verse 168 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, clearly explains how the six activities and the mind-vajra, speech-vajra, and body-vajra mantra recitations are to be per­formed in application to the mantra of Tara before moving on to other families:Concerning the mantras, piercing, etc., is as follows. First it is taught using the mantra of Tara. W ith this one can know the others. The mantra om hatalf*' p h a t accomplishes the piercing and is to be recited one hundred thousand times.

Then the body vajra om tare tutare ture svaha is recited ten million times, at the end of which one mil­lion fire offerings are made. In this way the yogi is granted the supreme deity of the mantra, but in other ways not.293[326] Therefore the mind-vajra recitations and the six activities followed by speech-vajra and body-vajra meditations, each with the requisite number of recitations, must be learned before the practice of each deity.

It is green in color and belongs to the element space. [328] The right channel above the navel is known as rasanâ and as the sun channel. It is red, of the fire element, and mainly car­ries blood. The left channel above the navel is known as laland and as the moon channel. It is white, of the water element, and mainly carries semi­nal fluid. These three channels above the navel are dominated by the life- sustaining wind, which flows within them.Below the navel the central and right channels continue to the tip of the genital organ. The continuation of the central channel below the navel is known variously as sankhini, the all-pervading channel, and the Kàlàgni channel. It is blue, of the gnosis element, and mainly carries seminal fluid. The right channel below the navel is known as mesa? and as the urine chan­nel. It is black, of the wind element, and mainly carries urine. The contin­uation of the left channel below the navel reaches to the anus. It is known as pingah? and as the excrement channel.

At the loca­tions of these six cakras, the right channel and its continuation below the navel is coiled around the central channel, and the left channel and its con­tinuation is also coiled around the central channel, thereby producing a series of double channel knots. At each of these channel knots the channel petals on their immediate right reach into the entwined central and right channels, and the channel petals on the immediate left reach into the joined left and central channels.Between cakras, from the crown cakra to the brow cakra, brow to the throat, throat to the heart, heart to the navel, and navel to the secret place, [329] the central channel is in the center, while rasanâ and lalana and their two urine and excrement continuations are on the right and left"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 393respectively. Therefore between each cakra there are three pathways. From the secret area onward, the excrement channel is in the center and travels to the anus. The urine channel is on the left, and the sahkhini is on the right, and they both travel to the tip of the sex organ. The authority for this explanation comes from the Great Commentary on verse 120 of the Gnosis chapter:“Arriving at the place of nectar, channels are knotted in series.”The place of nectar is the brow. “Arriving at the place of nectar” refers to lalana, rasand, and avadhutl. They are knotted in series, and so between the navel and the heart there are three path­ways. The avadhuti is central, traveling from the center of the navel. The lalana and rasand flow into the left and right petals.Then, between the heart and the throat, there are three path­ways. Similarly there are three pathways between the throat and the brow and three between the brow and the crown. In this way there are four lots of three paths. The lalana travels from the left nostril to other locations for a distance of twelve and “part.”4 This is taught in the Inner chapter. The rasand travels from the right. The avadhutl travels from between the two nostrils. Between the navel and the secret area are the three pathways.The excrement and urine channels travel from the left and right.The sahkhini in the center travels to the secret lotus. Below the secret lotus the excrement channel travels from the center. The urine channel travels from the left to the male or female organ.The seminal fluid channel travels from the right.5Other descriptions state that below the navel, the central channel bends to a position on the right, the continuation of the lalana left channel bends to the center, and the continuation of the rasand right channel bends to the left. This description is in contradiction to the above commentary text.The numbers of channel petals, the elements they belong to, and their descriptions are clearly taught in the Inner chapter of the tantra and com­mentary and have been explained in the section on the Inner chapter. The source for those descriptions is the Inner chapter, whereas the sources for the descriptions of the [330] six great channels in this section are in the Gnosis chapter.The channel petals penetrate the entwined left, right, and center channels."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"394 Rart 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageIn the channel petals on the left, the winds of the elements flow in the order of space, air, fire, water, and earth before flowing through the left channel and through the left nostril. In the right channel petals they flow earth, water, fire, air, and space into the right channel and through the right nostril. As for the inward flow of wind, the earth wind flows as far as the navel, the water- element wind reaches one fingerwidth below the navel, the fire wind reaches two fingerwidths below the navel, the air-element wind reaches three finger- widths, and the space-element wind reaches four fingerwidths below the navel. Fifty-six and a quarter breaths flow through the upper opening of the central channel during each of the twelve great wind movements. Moreover, at the locations of each of the cakras, there are entrances for the winds to flow into the central channel. These tenets are particular to this system.The channels as sites of penetrative focusingPenetrative focusing6 means that mental focus is fixed on points of the body, such as the cakras, and major points of the body are pierced or pen­etrated to produce gnosis. This is penetrative focusing on the body. These major points are inside the central channel, at locations in the middle of the cakras, and also at the central channel’s upper and lower openings. The experiences arising from piercing these points and meditating upon them are different for each point.Which channels are to be penetrated during which of the six yogasDuring the yogas of withdrawal and meditative absorption, the focus is on the upper opening of the central channel. During pranayama and recol­lection it is the point at the center of the navel cakra. During the yoga of retention the focus for penetration is inside the central channel at the cen­ters of the six cakras. During meditative-concentration yoga, focus is from the lower opening of the central channel to the upper opening.The windsAs explained previously during the section on the Inner chapter, there are ten winds. [331] They are: life-sustaining, downwardly expelling, coex­isting, upwardly moving, pervading, ndga, turtle, lizard, devadatta, and"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 395dhanamjaya. The places where these winds are first created and where they reside in the meantime7 are the ten channel petals of the heart cakra.8 The inside of the dhütï above the upper channel knot of the heart cakra is where the life-sustaining wind is first produced and where it resides. Inside the lower dhütï, the downwardly expelling wind is first created and resides. The currents of the life-sustaining wind are in the three great upper chan­nels, and the downwardly expelling winds are in the three lower great chan­nels. The eight channel petals from the one at the east, or front, of the body clockwise around to the northeastern petal are the birthplaces and locations of the equalizing, turtle, upwardly moving, lizard, nâga, dhanamjaya, pervading, and devadatta winds. The pathways of these winds are like the waters of large irrigation canals, which divide up and flow into many more smaller canals. Each of the ten winds that dwells within the ten channel petals divides off into many other smaller channels, thereby spread­ing through all the channels of the body.The placed bodhicitta dropsA general description of the red and white drops was given in the Inner chapter. Here the focus will be on the drops that produce the four periods.The body, speech, mind, and gnosis drops, the four enlightened body, speech, mind, and gnosis drops, and the drops of the four periods are syn­onymous. Their locations are as follows. In the center of the brow cakra is the body or enlightened body drop, which creates the waking period. In the cen­ter of the throat cakra is the speech or enlightened speech drop, which creates the dream period. In the center of the heart cakra is the mind or enlightened mind drop, which creates the deep sleep period. In the center of the navel cakra is the gnosis drop, [332] which creates the fourth or bliss period.The four drops that create the four periods are also found, in the above order, at the center of the navel, secret, and jewel cakras, and at the tip of the jewel, the lower opening of the central channel. The reason for posit­ing the fourth period at the navel and at the tip of the jewel is as follows. In ordinary existence, when the element melts and falls— for instance, dur­ing sexual desire— the bliss experienced is greater when it arrives at these two places than at other places. This is because the drop that creates the fourth period is located in these two places.Concerning the locations of the red and white elements, a predomi­nance of the white element with a little of the red is found in the center of"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"3S>6 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagethe brow and jewel cakras and also at the tip of the jewel at the lower end of the central channel. However the actual basic white element that is responsible for its own increase is found at the brow cakra. A predomi­nance of the red element with a little white is found at the centers of the navel, throat, and secret cakras. At the heart cakra the red and white ele­ments dwell in equal quantities.As for the nature of these drops located in these places, previous lamas of this tradition of the six yogas have said that we can understand them as taught in the Vajra Garland Explanatory Tantra, namely, droplike mix­tures of the red and white elements the size of mustard seeds.According to the tradition of this tantra and its commentary, the root of all obscuration is the obscuration of the four periods. How then are the drops that create the waking period and so forth explained as obscurations? The great scholars have asserted these drops to be matter.9 Moreover, con­sidering that it would be unsuitable to posit matter, particularly matter that is newly produced in this life, as actual obscurations present since beginningless time, these scholars have said that very subtle mind and wind are hidden [333] within each of these drops, and on these winds is imprinted the potential for obscurations. From these potencies, the obscurations of mental afflictions arise, from which arise phenomena obscurations.The way these four drops exist in the four places is spoken of in the Great Commentary on verse 120 of the Gnosis chapter:“Nada” refers to the enlightened mind drop at the heart that cre­ates the periods of very deep sleep. “Drop” refers to the enlight­ened body drop at the brow that creates the waking periods.“Part” refers to the enlightened speech drop at the throat that creates dreams. “Gnosis” refers to the gnosis drop that creates the fourth period.10The reasons why these four drops are said to create deep sleep and so forth are as follows. In ordinary existence coarse winds gather at the center of the jewel and at the heart. When this happens, mostly dreamless sleep occurs. The winds spread out from those places, and when they arrive at the secret place and at the throat, mostly long dreams occur. Spreading out from these two places, the winds arrive at the navel and the brow, where sleep ceases and the appearance of various objects occurs. The reason the other drop is said to create the fourth period has already been explained."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 397Generally highest yoga tantra asserts that we possess within us some­thing that, by skillful means, can be transformed into the qualities of enlightenment. In particular the Great Commentary talks of the four drops as being drops of enlightened body, speech, mind, and gnosis. Such pas­sages teach that the body drop possesses the capacity to create various enlightened forms, such as the nirmanakaya, the speech drop has the capac­ity to produce the sambhogakaya of fully aspected speech, the mind drop has the capacity to produce the nonconceptual dharmakaya mind, and the gnosis drop has the capacity to produce the svabhavikakaya, the nature body, of great bliss. Within these four drops, which produce the periods of waking, dream, deep sleep, and the fourth state of bliss, is found the capac­ity to produce during ordinary existence, respectively, various appearances, faulty utterances such as lies, unclear nonconceptual minds such as deep sleep, and the bliss of emission. [334] These capacities are purified by prac­tice on the path. This means that their capabilities to merely produce var­ious forms, sounds, nonconceptual states, and bliss are brought into the path and these are transformed into various empty forms, indestructible sound, nonconceptual gnosis, and unchanging bliss. These in turn are fur­ther purified and developed by the path to produce the final results of prac­tice, the various nirmanakaya forms, the fully aspected sambhogakaya of speech, the nonconceptual dharmakaya mind, and the svabhavikakaya of great unchanging bliss.One should learn this general description of the vajra body, and specif­ically the descriptions of the channels, winds, and drops, because the whole path of the completion stage is a piercing of the channels, winds, and drops.Penetrative focusing: A common presentation of the six-branched yogaThis is under three headings:1. General structure of the six-branched completion-stage yoga2. Determining the number and order of the yogas3. Texts to rely on for explanations of the six-branched yogaGeneral structure of the six-branched completion-stage yogaThe six yogas can be condensed into three—virtue at the beginning, virtue in the middle, and virtue at the end. These are known as the three purities."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"398 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageThey may also be condensed into the four vajras, the four yogas, the four branches of approximation and accomplishment, and the four branches of accomplishment of form, accomplishment of wind, accomplishing bliss, and accomplished bliss. How do the six yogas fit into these structures? [335] The first two yogas, withdrawal and meditative absorption, make up the purity of virtue in the beginning, the body vajra of the four vajras, shape yoga of the four yogas, approximation from the four branches of approxi­mation and accomplishment, and the branch of accomplishment of form. The next two yogas, prânâyâma and retention, make up the purity of virtue in the middle, the speech vajra, mantra yoga, the branch of near accom­plishment, and the branch of wind accomplishment. The last two yogas, recollection and meditative concentration, make up the purity of virtue at the end. The yoga of recollection is the mind vajra, the dharma yoga, the branch of accomplishment, and the branch of accomplishing bliss. The yoga of meditative concentration is the gnosis vajra, the purity yoga, the branch of great accomplishment, and the branch of accomplished bliss.Determining the number and order of the yogasThe number and order of the yogas are determined by the nature of the final attainment. In this practice the final attainment is the nondual gno­sis of enlightenment, which is a method-and-wisdom indivisible union of unchanging great bliss and empty form. The immediate cause of such an attainment must be the yoga of meditative concentration, because there is no need to train on any path higher than the branch of meditative con­centration. The Five Stages says:Dwelling in meditative concentration of union,there is no training again in any other.11In Kâlacakra practice, likewise, when dwelling in the branch of meditative concentration, “there is no training again in any other.” For the yoga of meditative concentration to induce the great unchanging bliss, it must be preceded by the yoga of recollection, which consists of an experience of great innate bliss induced by relying upon the three kinds of mudrà con­sorts. This includes the creation of an actual empty-form mahàmudrâ con­sort, because if an actual empty-form mother and father in union is not created, the basis for the creation of the great unchanging bliss is missing."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 399While relying on the three kinds of mudra consorts, the bodhicitta ele­ment is not emitted but held at the cakras to produce the great bliss of the yoga of recollection. This must be preceded by the yoga of retention, in which the winds and drops are held unmoving at the very center of the cakras. This yoga of retention must be preceded by the yoga of pranayama, in which the flow of wind [336] in the left and right channels is halted and made to flow only in the central channel. Before the winds of the right and left channels are halted and made to flow only in the central channel, they must first enter the central channel and purify it. Before an actual empty-form body can be created for use in the yoga of recollection, a sambhogakaya within a “black line emitting pure light rays”12 must be developed. These attainments are achieved by the yoga of withdrawal. The yoga of meditative absorption stabilizes the signs attained by the yoga of withdrawal. These two yogas, therefore, precede the others.In this way the attainment of the final goal, wherein unchanging bliss and the empty-form body of enlightenment are indivisibly united, must be preceded by the six yogas. Moreover, because the completion stage requires no more yogas than these six, the number of the yogas is determined as six, while the order of the yogas is determined as above. W ith this in mind the Later Guhyasamdja Tantra says:With the branches of meditation at six, practice to accomplish the supreme.Practices using other meansdo not become the supreme siddhi.13This verse states explicitly that if these six branches are not completed in their entirety, there will be no supreme accomplishment, which means con­versely that a complete practice of the six branches on the completion stage will bring the supreme accomplishment. Therefore the practices are enu­merated as six, and the sequence of practice is similar to the above expla­nation. W hat are these six branches?

The way to meditate4. Valid cognition5. Purification divisions6. Results"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"402 Part $: Gnosis: The Completion StageThe meaning of the term withdrawalVerse n6 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:In withdrawal within the body, the ten subjects and objects are not engaged.19The Great Commentary on this verse says:Now the definition of withdrawal and so forth is taught. W ith ­draw al means that within the body, consciousness is not engaged in the conjunction of the ten subjects and objects. The five others, eyes and so forth, are engaged in empty-form objects.20These two passages teach the etymology of the term withdrawal. The five sense organs of the eyes and so forth are halted from engaging with their individual objects of external form and so forth and are withdrawn inside. Therefore this branch is called withdrawal. Because the connections between individual sense organs and individual objects are abandoned or cut, this yoga is also known as in d ivid u a l abandonm ent and in d iv id u a l severing.How are connections to the sense objects severed, and how are the senses prevented from engaging their objects? Stopping the sense consciousnesses from engaging their objects by the power of mindfulness and awareness21 and by one-pointedly fixing the mind upon an object is not sufficient here. In those cases, the sense consciousnesses do not engage their objects sim­ply because the immediate preceding cause is missing or because the mind is dwelling firmly in common peaceful abiding.22 The Compendium o f Valid Cognition says:Consciousness absorbed by something has no power to engage anything else.23So where is the mind placed in this context? By focusing on and penetrat­ing the points on the body the winds will enter the dhutl. Because the winds are vehicles of the sense consciousnesses, the sense consciousnesses themselves are turned away from their objects, [339] and the connection"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 403between sense and object is broken. This is a severing of the connection between the five senses and the five objects and not a break between men­tal consciousness and its objects.Severing the connection between sense and sense object is an explanation of the term w ithdrawal in terms of what is negated. As an explanation of its etymology in terms of what is accomplished, the Great Commentary says:The five others, eyes and so forth, are engaged in empty-form objects.24The other five senses, such as the fleshly eye25 and so forth, are engaged in five other objects, such as empty form and so forth, with each withdraw­ing into its own individual object. This is also why this yoga is called w ith ­draw al This explanation of the meaning of this term has certain similarities to the etymology of withdrawal found in Bright Lamp. One difference is that in the Bright Lamp explanation, the ripened sense organs26 engage in external form and so forth, while here the fleshly eye, rather than the ripened eye, engages with empty forms and so forth. Concerning these empty sounds and empty forms, such as smoke and mirages, the Great Commentary says on verse 115 of the Gnosis chapter:W ith the yoga of forms one hears all manner of indestructible sound. From the appearance of form comes the nirmánakáya, and from the appearance of sound comes the sambhogakaya.27From the above, we must also infer empty form, smells, tastes, and touch. Therefore four “other” senses, in addition to the “other” eye, or fleshly eye, can be asserted.The Great Commentary, on verse 103 of the Methods of Accomplish­ment chapter, says:Now near accomplishment is taught. “Individual” and so on refers to withdrawal. The withdrawal of the surroundings refers to the sense organs of the eyes and so forth apprehending their objects of form and so forth, and the abandoning of that is called withdrawal. Concerning empty forms, other eyes such as eyes of flesh, apprehend other forms as their objects. This is near accomplishment.28"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"404 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageThis passage mirrors the explanation of withdrawal as described above. But isn’t this section [340] the branch of approximation consisting of with­drawal and meditative absorption? What does near accomplishment refer to here? When the completion stage is divided into its four branches of approximation and accomplishment, withdrawal and meditative absorption do comprise the branch of approximation. But the quote above is based on the inner and outer samaya and so forth being posited as the branch of approximation, and so there is no fault.29The time for meditationSome say that the time for meditation is when the earth wind flows from the right nostril onto the right side of the lips. However this is not con­clusive, because the earth wind that flows onto the lips is to the earth wind of the minor elements, and the instruction that one should begin the med­itation of withdrawal when earth wind flows from the right nostril is given for purposes of illustration only. Therefore the Great Commentary on verse 122 of the Gnosis chapter says:“Earth” is an illustration. If the yogi meditates when it flows through the right channel, this is the time for the ritual, but not when it flows through the left channel, because that is in the order of space and so forth.30This passage teaches the time for beginning withdrawal meditation. Illus­trating this with the earth wind passing through the right nostril means that when any kind of wind passes through the right nostril, it will be in the dis­solution order,31 and therefore withdrawal is easier. This is the reason for beginning withdrawal meditation at that time. When the winds flow through the left nostril, they flow in the creation order of space, air, fire, water, and earth. This makes withdrawal harder, and therefore it is not taught as the time for withdrawal meditation.The way to meditateThis has five outlines: [341]1.

Division of withdrawal into two parts, plus reasons for the division3. The meditations of the two parts4. Ritual of enhancement at times of nonaccomplishment5. Even if one dies with the remainder of the meditations unfinished, the power of the yoga ensures continuationSources for the assertion that during withdrawal, winds must enter the central channel by the force of meditationThe Root Tantra, quoted in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis sum­mary of the Gnosis chapter, says:Meditating on smoke and so forthmind is made immovable,the central channel is purified.32And in the same summary:Meditating on the signs of smoke and so forth, the beginner purifies the central channel.33These quotes teach that during withdrawal, the central channel is purified. O n how this is done, Notes on Kalacakra says:Using the comparison of an irrigation canal that must be cleaned before feeding water into it, the cleaner or purifier of the central channel is the wind. W ithout entering the central chan­nel, how could the winds clean the inside of the channel from the outside? To say that one could clean the inside of an irriga­tion channel from the outside would be strange indeed!34As this quote makes clear, it is necessary for the winds to enter the central channel in order to clean the inside of it. Also the Great Commentary on verse 120 of the Gnosis chapter says:“Wind in the central channel” and so forth speaks of the yoga of withdrawal. Here initially the yogi places the winds in the cen­tral channel, by which he will see the signs within the avadhuti.35"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"4o6 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageThese quotes clearly state that the winds must enter the central channel during the process of withdrawal. But one may wonder if this quote refers to the branch of prânâyâma. That cannot be, because the quote continues, “Glorious guru, body vajra of the Buddha,”36 [342] thereby placing it in the approximation and body vajra section. After this sentence the text contin­ues, “Prânâyâma is the second, the speech vajra,” thereby placing prànâ- yàma within the speech vajra section. Furthermore the Great Commentary, on verse 115 of the Gnosis chapter, says:Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness the signs of smoke and so forth are seen. Therefore,“with the mind fixed into space, the eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered. From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage, a clear, uncontaminated light in the sky, a butter-lamp flame.”These are seen in the night yoga.37This clearly states that during the night yoga of the withdrawal process, the winds enter the central channel, causing empty forms to arise. The Great Commentary states on verse 118 of the Gnosis chapter:Like an illusory town they have colors, such as white and so forth, but because they are immaterial there are no colors. Although they are endowed with many features, they are never seen by ordinary beings. Why is that? “It is by the power of the màra of mental affliction,” whereby the winds flow in the left and right channels.38From this quote too we can understand that for the empty forms of the withdrawal yoga to appear, winds must enter the central channel, because while winds are flowing in the right and left channel, empty forms as part of the yogas of withdrawal and so forth are not seen. In the commentary called Filled w ith Good Qualities by Süryas'rï, it says:These appearances to the mind are seen when the left and right channel join as one.39This means that seeing the appearances of smoke and so forth is due to the right and left channel joining as one in the central channel. Savaripa also says:"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 407By the three unmoving, the ten winds enter the dhuti, outer and inner conceiving is halted, and the signs arise;this the branch of individual cutting.40This also means that for the ten signs of withdrawal to arise, the ten winds must move into the central channel. The Kalacakrapada Transmission also states:Meditate on withdrawal this way:meditate on emptiness, the object of meditation,and halt the winds that are to be stopped.41Therefore, by meditating on the practices of withdrawal, the winds of the right and left channel are halted and moved to the central channel. These and other quotes are from the tantra, its commentary, and other Indian texts. Earlier scholars of the Kalacakra tradition, [343] such as those of the Jonang, also accepted this explanation.However the Great Commentary says:During withdrawal and so forth, when forms are seen but instances of the unchanging have not been generated, because the winds have not been bound, at that time meditate on the nada, which will be explained, and by wrathful means bring them to the central channel.42Doesn’t this teach a scenario where the empty forms of withdrawal are seen but the winds have not entered the central channel? These words do teach a time during the meditations of withdrawal where the signs of smoke and so forth can be seen without the winds having entered the central channel. However such an experience is not on the actual path of withdrawal, because before the definitive empty forms on the path of withdrawal are seen, the winds must have entered the central channel, and if that is not the case, one should perform the above-mentioned enhancement ritual to accomplish it.If the winds have to enter the central channel during withdrawal, how is that achieved? To this some reply by quoting the Kalacakrapada Transmission:"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"4o8 Part $: Gnosis: The Completion StageOn a comfortable seat, guard the body in vajra position, tongue turned back, clasped to stomach, eyes turned upward, in the manner of Usnisacakri,43 hands vajra-bound.This will bind the winds.44Therefore, they maintain, by adopting a sitting posture and gazing in a certain way, the winds will be bound within the central channel. This can­not be correct. Why? Because it would mean that the meditations of with­drawal would not involve practices of mental placement. This follows because the primary effect of the withdrawal meditations is that the power of the winds in the central channel causes the signs of smoke and so forth to appear, and, according to you, adopting a seated posture and placing the eyes in a certain way by themselves halt the winds of the right and left channel and send them into the central channel, and moreover, in the yoga of withdrawal, the process of winds entering the central channel to bring about the resultant appearance of empty-form signs is a natural cause-and- effect occurrence. You must accept the reasons for this consequence, but you cannot accept the consequence itself,45 because there are explanations of mental placement in the Great Commentary. [344]The Jonang tradition and most Tibetan practitioners of the six yogas assert a positioning of the eyes that takes place in a darkened room. They say the eyes are fixed on a point in space outside the body directly in front of the point midway between the eyebrows. The mental placement involves focusing the mind one-pointedly on that very point in the space of a dark­ened room on which the eyes have focused. There it is held without the slightest wandering, in a relaxed manner, and without any mental activity.46 This, they maintain, ensures that the winds enter the central channel and that the signs will appear. If this were the case, they must assert, and do assert, that a mental placement determined by the position of the eyes and body is sufficient to bring the winds into the central channel. If so, then it must be accepted that when an arya traveling the path by the Perfection Vehicle is in the sevenfold position of Vairocana47 in meditative equipoise and focused single-pointedly upon emptiness, he has necessarily halted the flow of winds in the left and right channels. Alternatively, if that is not accepted, then you would have to differentiate between this situation, where the winds have not entered the central channel, and the situation"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"The Six-Branched Yoga 409where the winds have entered the central channel through placing the mind one-pointedly on a point in space in a darkened room. However it is dif­ficult to make a distinction between these two situations.Our position is that it is the mental placement itself that brings the winds into the central channel. This and the sources will be explained below.Division of withdrawal into two parts, plus reasons for the divisionThis is under two headings:1. Dividing withdrawal into night yoga and day yoga2. Reasons for this divisionDividing withdrawal into night yoga and day yogaThe Great Commentary, on verse 115 of the Gnosis chapter, says: [345]Yoga meditations of the Perfection Vehicle and the Mantra Vehicle are of two kinds, namely those in space and those with­out cover.48Yoga meditations are of two kinds: those “in space” are night yogas, and those “without cover” are day yogas. The way yoga meditations of the Perfection Vehicle are divided in two is found in the Cakrasamvara Com­mentary:Therefore, in the meditations of withdrawal, the Buddha has said that conceptual meditation is not seen. This meditation the Buddha has taught in the perfection of wisdom scriptures:“Then Indra, Lord of the gods, said to Subhuti, ‘Noble Subhuti, how does one practice yoga in the perfection of wis­dom?’ Subhuti replied, ‘Kaus'ika, one who practices yoga in space practices yoga in the perfection of wisdom. Kaufika, one who practices yoga without cover practices yoga in the per­fection of wisdom.’”"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"4io Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageTherefore the Buddha taught die mahamudra meditation by which the prognostic imagelike and the illusionlike appear in the cloudless sky.49The passage quoted from a perfection of wisdom sutra teaching the yoga practices “in space” and “without cover” shows similarities with the Bud­dha’s teachings from the highest yoga tantras that explain the night yogas and day yogas of the withdrawal practice, wherein various illusionlike and prognostic imagelike empty forms are seen. This is indicated by the sen­tence of the commentary beginning, “Therefore the Buddha.” However do not take this commentary to mean that the day and night yogas of with­drawal are taught in the perfection of wisdom sutras. If that were the case, it would mean that becoming a suitable vessel for receiving the perfection of wisdom sutras would entail receiving all four initiations.Reasons for this divisionPrevious lamas have said that a year consists of the sun’s northward and southward passages, [346] a month consists of two periods of waxing and waning, and a day consists of daytime and nighttime, and that those are rea­sons for the division into day and night yogas. Our own position is that both day and night yogas are necessary to ensure that whenever the medi­tation is performed, in daytime or in darkness, all desired signs are made manifest. In nighttime meditation the empty-form signs are easier to man­ifest and to ascertain than in daytime meditation. Therefore it is taught that the night yoga is performed first and followed by the day yoga. The reason for the difference in the degree of difficulty in manifesting the signs is explained as follows. When the eyes are positioned and the meditation object is held during the day, the winds of the eyes are not rigid, and it is not possible to banish an everpresent grayish appearance. This makes it difficult for empty forms to arise. In darkness this grayish appearance is not there, and this makes it easier for empty forms to appear."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"oWithdrawal: N ight YogaThe meditations o f the two sectionsThis has two outlines:1.

The signs of meditative accomplishment and their appearance The place o f meditationThe Great Commentary, on verse 115 of the Gnosis chapter, says:Those who practice the yoga in space are in the night, in the darkness of a room with no holes.50[347) Manjus'rildrti, a manifestation ofManjus'ri, states in the Essence o f the Three Yogas:In a house with no break in the darkness.51In Cilupa’s S ix Yogas also:"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"412 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageFirst is withdrawal;begin at night then in the dayin a tall house with no holes.52The meditations should be performed in the kind of darkened room that matches the description taught in these and other quotes. What should that room be like? Those who have the means should meditate in the middle story of a three-story house. The reason is that such a room avoids the harms of vapors from the earth below and the dripping of water from above. If that is not possible, the room should be built on dry ground, not damp under­foot, with a high ceiling. The windows should be narrow on the outside and wide on the inside and be easy to cover, with a blanket, for example. Apart from those openings, there should not even be a hole the size of a hair tip in the room. Everywhere should be smoothly plastered, and the entrance should have three turns in it to cut out all light. If that is not possible, hang a curtain over any cracks or openings in the door, and make the room very dark. The reason for this is that if any light enters the room, it will damage the eyes, thoughts will appear, and deluding appearances will be seen.Posture and binding Essence o f the Three Yogas says:In a house with no break in the darkness,the practitioner in deep equipoiseperforms the five actionsand the two bindings,which can be known from the guru.53The five actions are the actions of parts of the body. The two bindings refer to the holding of mind and winds within the central channel. The way these can be known is by the guru’s demonstration. They are described in the Kalacakrapada Transmission:On a comfortable seat,the body straight, in vajra position,tongue turned back, clasped to stomach,"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 413eyes turned upward, in the manner of Usnisacakri, hands vajra-bound.This will bind the winds.54Cilupa says:Mount Meru is straight, four continents gathered in, sun and moon spread above, the tongue is moved, vajra binding subdues the oceans, the great winds of the heart flow: these are the actions of the body; they will hold the winds inside. [348]Look with the look of great Usnlsa.55The two passages teach five postures as the actions and also that these actions are instrumental in binding the winds and mind. The explanation of these two passages is as follows. “The body straight” and “Mount Meru is straight” mean that the spine is straight and erect. O f the two phrases “in vajra position” and “four continents gathered in,” the former teaches the vajra position itselP6 and the latter that the four limbs are gathered in. Therefore the feet are in the vajra position. The line “vajra binding subdues the oceans” teaches that the two hands are bound as overlapping vajra fists and clasped to the abdomen. The phrases “clasped to stomach” and “hands vajra-bound” from the first passage teach the same. The phrases “tongue turned back” and “eyes turned upward” from the first passage and “the sun and moon spread above, the tongue is moved” from the second teach that the tongue is touching the palette and that both eyes look upward. How they gaze upward is also clearly taught by the lines “in the manner of Usnisacakri” and “Look with the look of great Usnlsa.”To summarize, the spine is straight and erect, the feet are in the vajra position, and the hands are bound as vajra fists crossed over the abdomen. Alternatively the right hand is placed upon the upturned left with the thumbs touching in the equipoise mudra, or both hands bound as vajra fists are placed upon the thighs in the Vajrasattva mudra.57 Any of these posi­tions is acceptable. The Great Commentary states:"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"414 P&rt 5• Gnosis: The Completion StageHands are bound as vajra fists, thumbs held by fists, on the right and left thighs, resting on the vajra seat to become the vajra mudra.58Together with the tongue against the palette and the eyes looking upward, this five-part posture constitutes the five actions. The winds and the mind held in the central channel by these five constitute the two bindings. This is the explanation of the line “performs the five actions and the two bind­ings.” But wasn’t the assertion that the winds could be bound into the central channel by positioning the body and the eyes refuted? [349] That was a refutation of the assertion that positioning alone could bring the winds into the central channel. The intention of the passages quoted from these Indian texts is that it is primarily the placement of the mind that brings the winds into the central channel. However here they are describ­ing the positioning of the body and the eyes as conducive conditions for the binding of the winds into the central channel. Therefore there is no contradiction.Positioning the eyesThe Great Commentary, on verse 120 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, states:“W ith the wrathful look of Usnisa,” with eyes not closed and looking above, the signs will appear.59This quote speaks of the eyes not being closed and looking with the wrath­ful look of Usnlsa. “Looking above” means looking upward. “Eyes not closed” means half shut and not moving. The position of the eyes is also taught in the R ig iA ra li Tantra when it states, “Half eyes turned upward.”60 Therefore the eyes are half covered by the eyelids and look toward the object of the mind’s focus. The Great Commentary, on verse 115 of the Gno­sis chapter, says, “W ith the mind fixed into space, the eyes unclosed,”61 which teaches that wherever the mind is fixed, there the eyes are positioned also, and that the eyes are slightly open and unmoving. These explanations are mirrored by the Kalacakrapada Transmission, when it says “eyes turned upward, in the manner of Usnlsacakri”62 and by Cilupa, “Look with the look of great Usnlsa.”63"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 415If the eyes are positioned wherever the mind is placed, then what is the placement of the mind? This topic is under two headings:1. Refuting that mental placement is a state of no thought2. The validity of mental placement by mental application to an objectRefuting that mental placement is a state of no thoughtThe Hevajra Tantra says:Abandon all thoughts, meditate thoroughly for a day.64Also the Great Commentary begins, on verse 114 of the Methods of Accom­plishment chapter:“First the emptiness enlightenment” means that in the darkness, do not think at all.65[350] Some think that the meaning of these and other quotes is that the mental placement for the yoga of withdrawal is to halt all mental activity and to place the mind in a state of no thought. This is clearly refuted by the Great Commentary in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary. It begins with a presentation of the above assertion:In the perfection of wisdom sutras, the Buddha has taught the no-thought gnosis of the tathagatas to be the way to the attain­ment of the perfect and complete enlightenment of a buddha.The passage continues up to:The accomplishment of enlightenment is by the no-thought gnosis of the tathagatas and not by conceptual meditative con­centration.66Mental placementThis is the assertion. The text continues with the refutation:"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"416 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageIn this way the ignorant assert no thought to be gnosis. They are falling to a great extreme. Some assert this, and therefore it is dis­cussed.67This passage continues up to:If at such a time there was no thought or appearance of a pre­cious lamp, how could it come to be known as the m editative concentration o f the precious lam p7.68 It is the same with other meditative concentrations: they are not without thought because they possess the characteristics of self-perception and are not examples of inanimate emptiness.69This passage also includes a refutation by logical consequence, which states that in a deep sleep, a state of no thought and no mental activity naturally occurs, and therefore all living beings must be buddhas.W ouldn’t the above passage also refute the meditation tradition of mahamudra handed down through the oral transmission? If this system of meditation has become a tradition not unlike that of Hoshang70 in which nothing is brought to mind, then we must say that it does. I concur with the words of the great masters who say that the yoga of the mahamudra is well known to involve looking at the mind, but that ’’mind” refers not to the various transient states of mind but to the primordial mind of clear light.So what are the meanings of lines such as “abandon all thoughts” and[351] “in the darkness do not think at all?”71 They mean that during with­drawal, “abandon all thoughts” apart from mental application to the objects of meditation, and “do not think at all.” In his commentary on the lines beginning “meditative absorption destroys the afflictions”72 from the sec­ond chapter of the second part of the Hevajra Tantra, Vajragarbha says:The first of the six yogas is withdrawal, and by withdrawing and meditating, these signs will appear. Even if there is no wish to enter the perfect path, simply for the sake of a spectacle, focus your mind one-pointedly on the objects for half a month or even for a day and a night.73Even those who have no wish to enter the perfect path, meaning those who"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 417do not strive for such a path, should apply their minds to the objects of meditation for half a month or, if that is not possible, for a day and a night, in order to see the spectacles of empty forms, such as smoke and so forth. This passage talks of a single-pointed mental application to objects during the withdrawal yoga. The next verse of the Hevajra Tantra says:Having abandoned all thoughts, the mind in deity form unceasingly for a day, complete the meditation.74On this verse Vajragarbha says:If those who lack the fortune to be able to strive in this yoga of no-self for half a month can place their minds one-pointedly on emptiness for even a day, abandoning all other objects of mind, trustworthy signs of the path will appear. These are signs of the withdrawal achieved by withdrawal yoga. Anything other than that is the foolish, in their deluded wisdom, slandering the teaching of the Tathagata.75Therefore this passage states that if the mind is placed one-pointedly on the meditation objects of withdrawal, trustworthy signs of the path, such as the empty forms of smoke and so forth, will arise. “Abandon all thoughts” is explained by the line “abandoning all other objects of mind,” which means to abandon meditation objects other than those of withdrawal yoga. The Vajragarbha Commentary continues: [352]Therefore abandoning all thoughts by using meditative con­centrations other than those of the concentrations of withdrawal yoga and meditating for a day and night will not produce the trustworthy signs.76This clearly teaches that abandoning all other thoughts and meditating on the concentrations of withdrawal yoga for a day and a night will produce trustworthy signs.

Presenting sources to show its validity2. The actual placement of mindPresenting sources to show its validityVerse 115 of the Gnosis chapter, quoted in the Great Commentary, says:W ith mind fixed into space, eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered. From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage, a clear, uncontaminated light in the sky, and a butter-lamp flame.77The commentary to this says:Those who practice the yoga in space are in the night, in the darkness of a room with no holes. “W ith mind fixed into space, eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered.” Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness, the signs of smoke and so forth are seen. Therefore:“W ith mind fixed into space, eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered. From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage, a clear, uncontaminated light in the sky, and a butter-lamp flame.”These are seen by the night yoga.78This passage clearly teaches the objects of meditation during withdrawal yoga, as well as the placement of the mind on those objects in conjunction with the positioning of the eyes. It also teaches that the winds enter the cen­tral channel from that placement of mind and eye position, and that from the winds [353] entering the central channel, the signs of smoke and so forth appear. How are these taught? The lines beginning “the vajra path is entered. From the emptiness arises smoke” and the ensuing commentary,"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 419“Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness, the signs of smoke and so forth are seen,” teach that as a result of the vajra activity of the winds entering the central channel, the definitive signs of withdrawal yoga, smoke and so forth, will be seen. However they will not be seen without the winds entering the central channel. What is the method for bringing the winds into the central channel in this meditation? The lines from the Condensed Tantra and the Great Commentary, “W ith mind fixed into space, eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered” teach the object of meditation to be “space” and that a single-pointed placement of the mind onto that object is the mental placement. Wherever the mind is placed, there the unclosed eyes are focused. From this the winds will enter the central channel.Furthermore Naropa in his Commentary to a Short Teaching on In itia ­tions says:Those who practice the yoga in space are in the night, in the darkness of a room with no holes, with the mind fixed into space, and all thoughts abandoned. There with the mind one- pointedly on emptiness, meditate for a day. “The eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered. Here the winds enter the central chan­nel, and from the total emptiness, the signs of smoke and so forth are seen.”79Cilupa also says:Focusing on space, look into space;the five signs, smoke and so forth, will appear.80The Kalacakrapada Transmission states:At night and without cover,focus on space, meditate on the emptiness.81These and other Indian texts on the same topic and their commentaries have explained the object of withdrawal meditation as taught in the phrase “the mind fixed into space” from the tantra and commentary as being an “empty space.” This emptiness is mentioned in the second summary of the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary:"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"420 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageTo accomplish this, the meditation on mahamudra, the path of the signs of smoke and so forth are clearly taught:“The mind one-pointedly into emptiness, meditate thoroughly for a day.”82This explains that an emptiness is the object of meditation. Similarly, in the Cakrasamvara Commentary, it says:Therefore, abandoning thoughts of existence and nonexistence, with no grasping, meditate on the deep nonapprehended emptiness. [354] The yogi will then see the arising of the signs of smoke and so forth.83Acarya Anupamaraksita’s commentary is similar to this:Therefore, abandoning thoughts of existence and nonexistence, with no support, meditate on the deep nonapprehended emptiness.84The meaning of these quotes on emptiness will be explained later.When explaining the meaning of the lines beginning “the mind fixed into space,” the commentary on Anupamaraksita’s six yogas says:“Night” means darkness. “The mind fixed into space” means that the mind draws toward space and becomes of one taste with it. Entering into the vajra path, the winds reach the avadhutl.85This explains that space is the object of meditation. In that case, space and emptiness, both explained as being the objects of meditation during with­drawal yoga, must be synonymous. Therefore a space that is the mere lack of any obstruction and obscuration, an emptiness with no material support, is the meditation object of withdrawal yoga. How is the mind to be placed in such a state?"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 421This is under two headings:1. The assertions of previous Tibetan masters2. The assertion of ]6 Tsongkhapa and the proof of its validityThe assertions of previous Tibetan mastersThe omniscient Buton asserts that the eyes are focused into the space of a darkened room directly in front of the point midway between the eye­brows. The mind also is one-pointedly focused on the emptiness that is the space of the darkened room upon which the eyes are positioned. W ithout wandering to anything else, and without any other thoughts whatsoever, the mind is released into this state.86 The Jonang and their followers men­tion many ways in which the mind is held still by the “three nonmove­ments.” However, in each method, the mind is one-pointedly focused onto the external place where the eyes have been positioned in the space of a darkened room. These two assertions seem to take the meaning of “empty space” as taught by the phrase “the mind fixed into space,” [355] and other phrases from the tantra and its commentaries, to refer to an external empti­ness within a darkened room.Those who hold these positions must differentiate between the prac­tices here in Kalacakra, with their ability to bring the winds into the cen­tral channel by mental placement on various points of the body, and the practices in the Perfection Vehicle and three lower tantras, where no amount of mental placement will bring the winds into the central channel.The assertion ofje Tsongkhapa and the proof of its validityAs explained previously, withdrawal yoga is a practice in which the winds must enter the central channel. For beginners there are three methods of bringing the winds into the central channel: using an external mudra con­sort to awaken the practice of pranayama, the wind yoga practices of high­est tantra, and thirdly, penetrative focusing upon the points of the vajra body. The last method involves the centers of the six cakras and the upper and lower openings of the central channel, which are entrances through which the winds enter the dhutl and are therefore locations of penetrative focusing. This practice is accomplished by the mind being placed single-The actual placement of mind"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"422 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagepointedly on those places and held there without distraction. W ith the mind placed on these points, the winds will also gather there, because mind and wind engage similarly.Which method is used here to bring the winds into the central channel? The emptiness and space explained as being the object of mental focus by the tantra, the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries, and the above Indian texts and commentaries refers to the empty space of the cylindrical hole that is the upper opening of the central channel located internally between the eye­brows. The mind is placed one-pointedly on this space, and all other thoughts on all other objects are abandoned. This placement of mind is what the lines “Having abandoned all thoughts” and “the mind one-point­edly into emptiness, meditate totally for a day” are referring to.How can we know that the emptiness and space spoken of in the tantra and commentaries in this section refer to the space that is the cylindrical hole of the upper opening of the central channel? I will explain. [356] In keeping with the Great Commentary statem ent “Tantras will be understood from other tantras,”87 the Rigi A rd li Tantra says:The eyes are not open, not closed, mind is placed between the eyebrows; in the medium of total darkness, initially the yogi sees.88The first line describes the position of the eyes. The second teaches how the mind is placed upon an object, and the last two lines explain how the signs will arise. Between the eyebrows, or in the center of the eyebrows, is where the upper opening of the central channel is found, and the placement of the mind described in this verse means that the mind is held there. Further­more the Root Tantra, quoted in the Great Commentary on verse n o of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:The great mudra of withdrawal has the characteristics of empty space.At that tip the mind is solely placed.In the black line, last of the signs, meditate on inanimate and animate in all their variety.89"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 423This clearly teaches that the mind is to be placed in the space of the empty interior of the central channel. How? The mind meditating on withdrawal yoga, which is characterized by the mind being single-pointedly placed into empty space, is single-pointedly and exclusively placed in the empty space “at that tip.” This produces the signs of smoke and so forth, the last of which is a hair-sized black line, in which the yogi meditates vividly on all the various prognostic mirrorlike animate and inanimate phenomena. The verse says that the mind is to be placed in the empty space at a “tip.”90 On that tip the Root Tantra says:This sankhini is the great mudrâ, spoken of as candâlï.Above the navel Laksmi, the avadhütï, the human tip.91Here the ava d h ü tï is referred to as a “tip.” Therefore the first quote teaches that during withdrawal yoga, the mind is to be focused upon a tip, and the second quote explains that tip to be the dhütï. This clearly indicates that the mind is to be focused on the dhütï. That this tip refers to the upper tip will be explained later.Furthermore the Condensed Tantra says:W ith the mind fixed into space, the eyes unclosed, the vajra path is enteredAnd the commentary on this says:Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness, the signs of smoke and so forth are seen.[357] This teaches the necessity of the winds entering the central channel as the immediate cause of seeing the signs of smoke and so forth. The com­mentary continues:Therefore, with the mind fixed into space, the eyes unclosed, the vajra path is entered. From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage...92"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"424 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageThis clearly teaches that both the mind fixed into space and the unclosed eyes bring the winds into the avadhuti, or vajra path, through which the signs of smoke and so forth will arise from the emptiness. Therefore it also explains that “space” in the phrase “the mind fixed into space” is the space of the emptiness that is the inside of the central channel and that the mind is placed one-pointedly in it.Assuming that the space and emptiness spoken of in this section on mental placement in withdrawal yoga do refer to the emptiness that is the inside of the central channel, how is it proven that this refers to the upper opening of the central channel? The verse quoted above that runs “The eyes are not open, not closed, / mind is placed between the eyebrows”93 refers to the space that is the emptiness of the central channel’s inner hol­low, whose upper opening lies directly at the point midway between the eyebrows. Moreover the Great Commentary says on verse 120 of the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter:In the phrase “The look of Vighnantaka,”94 Vighnantaka means amrtavartaP5 His look “reaches the place of nectar,” which means reaching the brow. The look of Vighnantaka reaches the place of nectar, and by this, near accomplishment of the six branches will be achieved. The word “also” refers to pranayama and retention. “Having seen the forms of the winds” refers to near accomplishment.96This passage clearly refers to the upper opening of the central channel. How? The commentary says that the Vighnantaka of the root text quote, “The look of Vighnantaka,” refers to amrtavarta, and that “the place of nectar” refers to the brow. “His look” means “his reach.” In other words the look of Vighnantaka reaches the brow or place of nectar. Withdrawal and meditative absorption have already been explained as being the branch of approximation, and the words “by this” mean that by the accomplishment of the branch of approximation, which involves the mind being placed at or reaching the upper opening of the dhutl within the brow, or place of nectar, meditate “also” upon the [358] practices of pranayama and retention in the branch of near accomplishment. Seeing the images of the winds refers to near accomplishment.This passage from the Great Commentary talks of a mental placement,"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 425which involves the place of nectar, or the brow. This particular mental placement is not that of pranayama and retention, which means it can be none other than that of withdrawal and absorption. The yoga of medita­tive absorption is a stabilizing of withdrawal, and therefore this passage is an establishment of withdrawal mental placement.Therefore the line from the root text and commentary, “Approxima­tion is the first yoga, of ten aspects, with the look of wrathful Cakrl,” describes the positioning of the eyes during the yoga of withdrawal. The line “The look of Vighnantaka reaches the path of nectar” refers to the positioning of the eyes during withdrawal yoga as well as the focus of the mind. The word “also” indicates that with the attainment of the with­drawal and absorption branch of approximation, the near-accomplishment branch of the six yogas, pranayama and retention, is also to be practiced.Some say that the term am rtavarta as mentioned here does not refer to the branch of approximation, because a verse from the Later Guhyasamaja in the Cakrasamvara Commentary 2nd in Naropas Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations links the appearance of amrtavarta with the practice of near accomplishment:During near accomplishment, the image of am rtavarta,97There is no contradiction here. The am rtavarta that has been described as “The look of Vighnantaka” and so forth has been explained as referring to the brow. The am rtavarta mentioned in the Later Guhyasamaja verse, “During near accomplishment, the image of amrtavarta?™ which appears in the Cakrasamvara Commentary 2nd is quoted by Naropa, is explained by both these commentaries as provisional language referring to the winds. Therefore this verse is referring to the winds as being the meditative object during the pranayama and retention yogas, the near-accomplishment branch of the six yogas. The Cakrasamvara Commentary, when explaining the lines “during near accomplishment,” says:“The image of amrtavarta refers to the winds by way of provi­sional language. Furthermore the Buddha spoke similarly of the “five aspects” in the Later Guhyasamaja, where he says, “Breath, the nature of the five jewels.”"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"426 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage[359] Nâropa also reproduces these words from the Cakrasamvara Com­mentary, and when explaining the line “The look of Vighnantaka” in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, he mirrors the words of the Great Commentary:Vighnantaka in the line “The look of Vighnantaka” refers to amrtavarta. His “look” reaches the place of nectar, which means reaching the brow. By this the near accomplishment of the six branches will be achieved. The word “also” refers to prânâyâma and retention.\"Likewise the Kâlacakrapâda Transmission clearly states that the brow is the location of penetrative focusing:Life wind is brought to the drop at the brow; meditate when the wind on the right flows.100Furthermore, in Avadhütipas Opening the Eyes to W hat Is H idden, it says:The manner is as follows: the eyes are not closed, the mouth is open, breath is natural, there is no holding to phenomena, noth­ing that grasps and nothing to be grasped, the breath entering and dwelling within the deep channel between the eyebrows.This is the stance of that wrathful one. Similarly those who prac­tice to accomplish the yoga must adopt a similar stance, and the five signs of the night yoga will arise.101“The deep channel between the eyebrows” mentioned during the posi­tioning of the eyes in withdrawal yoga refers to the dhütï between the eye­brows, and this passage teaches that the practitioner of the nighttime yoga must meditate on the breath entering at that point. This establishes that the focus of the mind, which brings the winds with it, must also be at this point.To summarize: The eyes half covered by the eyelids look upward to the point midway between the eyebrows, to the opening of die upper tip of the central channel in the space of its empty aperture. The eyeballs are rolled up toward the inner corners of the eyes. Together with the mind these half­closed eyes are one-pointedly focused, and they do not move at all from this"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 427position. This is the placement of the eyes. Likewise the mind dwells within the emptiness that is the space of the empty aperture of the upper tip of the central channel and is held there in single-pointed equipoise. [360] This is the placement of the mind. This validates the placement of the eyes and mind and the way the winds enter the central channel in dependence on that placement, as taught by J£ Tsongkhapa:Know that withdrawal and meditative absorption gather winds into the upper opening of avadhuti.102However, in his Six Yogas, the great dharma master Buton says:Holding the previous position of the eyes, with eyeballs unmov- ing, eyelashes not fluttering, and the eyes looking at one place, the entrances of the right and left channels that carry the flow of conceptual winds are blocked. By this restriction the winds, which rise and flow through the eyes, together with the eye con­sciousness, are halted. By this restriction the mind is held, which in turn halts the other senses.103The meaning of this passage seems to be that by positioning the eyes, the winds, which act as mounts for the five sense consciousnesses, will enter the central channel, and the signs will arise. This also appears to be his under­standing of the following verse from Anupamaraksita:When the half eyes are firmly placed upon the pure space,smoke and so forth will nonconceptually appear from the nonconceptual consciousness of great bliss and emptiness.104Furthermore, regarding placement of the mind in the same S ix Yogas, dharma master Buton said:Within the state of this previous positioning of the eyes and physical posture, all grasping to existence, nonexistence, and so forth will be destroyed. One relaxes into an uncontrived state and dwells within nonapprehension.105"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"428 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageAs a source for this assertion, he quotes the Vajrapani Commentary:Therefore, abandoning all perception of existence and nonexis­tence, not grasping, meditate on the profound nonapprehended emptiness.106Therefore he also asserts this meditation to be one on actual emptiness. The Vajragarbha Commentary also talks of “this yoga of nonself ’ and “placing the mind one-pointedly in emptiness,”107 and although he seems to think that this is the meaning of these quotes and of “meditate on the profound nonapprehended emptiness” from the Vajrapani Commentary,I cannot see this assertion as being correct. For a mental placement in which all grasping to existence, nonexistence, and so forth is eliminated, [361] the mind released into an uncontrived state, is not a meditation on the nature of reality.108 Even assuming that it were, it could not be a nonaspected emptiness meditation at this time in the practice of with­drawal. Practitioners of this path need a mere understanding of empti­ness produced by listening and contemplating, even at the time of requesting initiation, but the time for its primary meditation is during the two yogas of prânâyâma and retention, when mastery is gained over the winds, and the candâlï fire blazes within the dhütï to melt the ele­ments and produce the great bliss. This bliss takes nonaspected emptiness as its object of meditation to develop a similar-in-type cause of dhar- makâya. However, here in the yogas of withdrawal and absorption, the meditations are on empty forms, either by creating them anew or stabi­lizing those already produced in order to develop similar-in-type causes of the enlightened form body.In that case, it may be wondered what the meaning of this passage from the Vajrapani Commentary is?Therefore, abandoning all perception of existence and nonexis­tence, not grasping, meditate on the profound, nonapprehended emptiness, and the yogi will see the signs of smoke and so forth arise.109The meaning of this passage is similar to that given previously on the line, “Having abandoned all thoughts.” Having abandoned all perception of objects existing and nonexisting, except for those of withdrawal meditation,"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 429there will be no grasping to those existing and nonexisting objects. Focus­ing and meditating on the [362] previously described meditation objects of withdrawal will bring about the profound nature of the path of withdrawal, which is the “nonapprehended emptiness,” endowed with every supreme aspect. How does this occur? “The yogi will see the signs of smoke and so forth arise.”Moreover Naropa, in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, with an explanation of the meaning of these Great Commentary words in mind, clearly says:Therefore, abandoning perception of existence and nonexis­tence, with no support, the signs of the profound, nonappre­hended emptiness will arise. The yogi meditates for the arising of the signs of smoke and so forth.110The meaning of this passage is similar to others quoted previously. “W ith no support” means no material or objective support but having instead a focus of empty space, as previously described. Similarly Anupamaraksita says in his S ix Yogas:Therefore, abandoning thoughts of existence and nonexistence, with no support, meditate on the deep nonapprehended empti­ness, and signs of verification will occur. The signs of verifica­tion are those of smoke and so forth, and the yogi meditates upon these.111Also Suryas'ri in Filled w ith Good Qualities says:The meditation on emptiness is a perception of fully aspected emptiness. “Night” refers to darkness. “Day” refers to light.112Therefore “profound, nonapprehended emptiness” and so on should be understood as referring to an emptiness endowed with every supreme aspect developed during the actualization of the path of withdrawal. Likewise the lines “this yoga of nonself’ and “placing the mind one-pointedly in empti­ness” from the Vajragarbha C om m entary13 are also referring to an empty form that is the very path of withdrawal. This is so because the empty form endowed with every supreme aspect belongs to the wisdom category of"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"430 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagemethod and wisdom, and so it is referred to as “this yoga of nonself’ and so forth.This explanation of the above topics is the definitive meaning of these words from the Great Commentary, and those whose explanations are to accord with the thinking of Tsongkhapa should definitely explain them in this way.The signs o f meditative accomplishment and their appearanceThis is under two headings:1. Descriptions in the tantra and commentary and in Indian texts2. Summarized description of how the signs ariseDescriptions in the tantra and commentary and in Indian texts A Short Teaching on Initiations states:W ith all conceptuality abandoned,smoke, mirage, fireflies,and the flame of a butter lamp arise.114The Condensed Tantra says:From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage, a clear uncontaminated appearance within space, and a butter-lamp flame.115On this the Great Commentary says:“From the emptiness arises smoke, mirage, a clear uncontami­nated appearance within space, a butter-lamp flame.” These are seen by the night yoga.116[363] These four signs, therefore, are described as being night signs. As for their scriptural source, the Great Commentary says:O f the ten signs, those of the night are found in the Guhya- samaja and others.117"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 431“Others” refers to the Vajra T ent Tantra. Therefore the Great Commentary teaches that the night signs are spoken of in these two tantras. The Cakra- samvara Commentary also speaks of the night signs as coming from the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Vajra Tent Tantra:Smoke is the first sign, mirage the second, lights in the sky the third, a lamp the fourth, and the clarity of a cloudless sky is the fifth. These are spoken of by the Buddha in the Later Guhya- samaja and the D a k in i Vajra Tent. 118In the Later Guhyasamaja Tantra itself, these signs are taught as follows:To the mind of vajra cessation, signs, closely held, will appear.These signs are of five kinds,Bodhivajra119 has explained.The first is the form of a mirage, the second that of smoke, third is light in the sky, fourth is a burning lamp, and fifth is a constant clarity, like a cloudless sky.120In accord with the Later Guhyasamaja, A Short Teaching on the Views o f M afijusri also states:Meditate on signs of reliability: the first the form of a mirage, the second is like smoke, the third, fireflies, the fourth, like a lamp, the fifth is a constant clarity, like a cloudless sky.121These lines list the signs as they are spoken of in the Guhyasamaja. The text continues with the lines “Arising from space, self-arising,”122 and so on, which is a description of the signs taken from the Sam giti.m After these lines the order of signs as listed in the Kalacakra are quoted:"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"432 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageSmoke, mirage, fireflies, lamp alit, moon and sun, darkness, great drops, various forms, and clear light; with eyes closed and unclosed, in the emptiness, not imputed, dreamlike forms are seen.Meditate constandy on these forms.[364] In the Guhyasamaja the miragelike sign comes first. Here in the Kalacakra the smokelike sign is said to be the first. Is this not a contradic­tion? In order to resolve this, some say that there is no contradiction, because the Guhyasamaja quote is taught with its deep meaning hidden and is, therefore interpretative, whereas here the meaning is taught clearly and openly and is therefore definitive. It appears they think this is the meaning of a passage from Nâropas Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, which is their authority for their assertion:“Signs, closely held, will appear” means that the signs of smoke and so on closely held will appear very clearly. The reversal of the first and second signs is due to the teachings of the gurus.124However this is not a correct resolution of the contradiction. Meditative practices that follow such texts as the Five Stages and the Oral Tradition o f M anjusri,125 which teach according to the thinking of Guhyasamaja, will produce the miragelike sign first. This has been verified by the experiences of the great siddhas, such as Nàgàrjuna, who have recorded them literally in the great Indian texts. Naropa also, while commenting on the Later Guhyasamaja, is writing literally when he says that the miragelike sign is the first. The smokelike sign arising first, as described in the Kalacakra with­drawal, is also established by the actual experience of Kalacakra withdrawal practitioners and is presented in the tantra and commentary accordingly. To summarize: different traditions of practice mean that signs arise in dif­ferent orders. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:From the instructions of the guru, the yogi who practices in the space of night first sees smoke, not a mirage. This will be known from his experience. After that comes the mirage.126"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 433This passage explicitly teaches that when the six yogas of the Short Guhya­samdja are practiced according to Kalacakra, the instructions of the guru are given in accordance with Kalacakra, from which “the yogi who prac­tices in the space of night first sees smoke, [365] not a mirage.” Further­more “this will be known from his own experience.” Implicitly it teaches that when the six yogas of the Short Guhyasamdja are practiced accord­ing to the O ral Tradition o fM a n ju sri and B right Lamp, the yogi, by fol­lowing the instructions of the guru, will know from his own experience that “first comes the mirage, not the smoke,” after which comes the smoke. This has to be the way to understand it, because the above com­mentary passages refer to the verses of the Later Guhyasamdja and the Vajra T en t in order to dispel any doubts concerning the sources for the night signs. If it were not the case that different signs appear first depend­ing on the tradition of practice, and if the teaching of the mirage appear­ing first was solely a provisional teaching, then that fact would have been mentioned in the commentary. Instead it says, “This will be known from his experience.”Furthermore, SuryasrI in his Filled w ith Good Qualities says:Other tantras say “first the miragelike.” It should be understood therefore that the order is reversed.127Therefore the description in the Guhyasamdja of the mirage as the first sign reverses the order of the tradition that begins with the smokelike sign. He goes on to explain the reasons for this reversal:This can be understood from the instructions of the holy guru, the extensive commentary of the bodhisattva, and from one’s own experience.128This means the teaching that the first sign is the mirage followed by smoke has to be reversed here. This is due to the instructions of the holy gurus on the six yogas being taught according to the Kalacakra. By practicing these instructions as taught by the gurus, the smokelike sign arising first followed by the miragelike sign will be known from one’s own experience. This can also be known from Stainless Light, “the extensive commentary of the bodhisattva” Pundarlka. Therefore, when the six yogas of the Later Guhya­samdja are practiced according to a guru’s teachings in keeping with the"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"434 Tart y Gnosis: The Completion StageKalacakra, [366] the first sign will be smoke followed by the mirage. The commentary continues with an explanation of the arising of the signs in accord with their actual presentation in the Later Guhyasamaja:Primarily the five signs, of the nature of the five pure elements, are to be understood as being those of the Guhyasamaja Tantra and others. This is so because the text also talks of the element of space.129Therefore, beginning with the mirage, the five signs are explained as being the signs of the elements dissolving into each other. Applying that to the Guhyasamaja, the commentary continues:In the eighteenth chapter it states, “Water, fire, air, earth, and space, all of these.” These are similar in form and aspect to those of the bodhisattva.130This is the topic to be explained. The explanation follows:Earth absorbs into water from which arises the mirage. Water sinks into fire from which arises the smoke. Fire is absorbed into air from which arise' lights in the sky. The appearance of the three subde elements is like the appearance of a lamp in space and is therefore known as the sign of the lamp. From the sinking of that appearance arises a constant appearance like the cloud-free sky, known as the cloudless sky-like sign. These are the five signs.131The commentary then provides the source for this explanation:First earth goes into water.Water goes into fire, fire sinks into air, air enters consciousness, consciousness, the apprehending, enters the clear light.132Therefore it is acceptable to explain the Guhyasamaja s assertion of the mirage as being the first sign as a literal explanation and, moreover, they are"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Night Yoga 435the signs of the elements progressively dissolving. Similarly, the commen­tary continues:The N e t o f Illusion Tantra says that by the daytime yoga, the six signs having the nature of the six pure aggregates arise from the element of space. The glorious M aharaja Prim ordial Buddha Tantra primarily speaks of ten signs having the nature of the purified method and wisdom of the senses and their objects.133This means that the four signs of the progressive dissolution of the ele­ments as found in [367] the Guhyasamaja are similar to the four night signs of the Kalacakra and therefore are explained as night signs. The six signs of the six purified aggregates as spoken of in the N e t o f Illusion Tantra are similar to the six daytime signs of the Kalacakra and are therefore explained as daytime signs. However the nature of the ten signs from Kalacakra is that of purified method and wisdom: the five sense objects, form and so forth, are wisdom, and the five sense organs, eyes and so forth, are method.These ten types of purified method and wisdom arise from the ten winds entering the central channel. These ten winds consist of apprehending winds and apprehended winds. At the heart are located the five winds that move the five sense consciousnesses to the five sense objects. These engage objects in dependence upon the five sense organs. Also at the heart are the five enhancing and clarifying winds of the five sense objects of form and so forth. These winds clarify and enhance forms, sound, and so forth. These ten winds are stopped from flowing into the right and left channels and to the sense-organ entrances and instead enter the dhutl. This halts the activ­ity between the five senses and five sense objects, thereby bringing about the appearance of the ten signs. Verse 116 of the Methods of Accomplish­ment chapter also conveys this meaning:In withdrawal within the body,the ten subjects and objects are not engaged.134The Great Commentary on this verse says:W ithdraw al means that within the body, consciousness is not engaged in the connection between the ten subjects and objects.The five, eyes and so forth, are engaged in empty-form objects.135"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"These apprehending and apprehended winds are spoken of in the Vajra Garland Explanatory Tantra:Within the heart, the light of bliss, the illuminating light of the Buddha sun, the apprehending and apprehension of form: these the ten rays of light.Expanding light, rays of light, brilliance, the illuminating and shining, the shining light: they apprehend external form by way of the eyes and so forth.Light, luminosity,illuminatingly beautiful, illuminating light, illuminating sun:these in aspects of external form.136The first five winds are called expanding light and so forth. The second five are called light and so forth and are in the aspect of “objects.” [368]Summarized description of how the signs ariseWhen the yogi has developed some concentration from a correct practice of mental placement, posture, and eye positioning as previously explained, the position of the eyes will cause the winds that move the eye conscious­ness to its objects to stiffen and withdraw. The winds that move the other sense consciousnesses to their objects will do the same. At this time the connection between sense and sense object is broken, and various signs will appear. However these are not the actual signs of withdrawal. Then the apprehending and apprehended winds along with other winds that flow though the nostrils will enter the central channel. At that time various appearances arise, and the way they arise can be understood from the instruction texts composed by the masters.The winds flowing equally though both nostrils indicates that the winds are flowing in the central channel. This ensures the appearance of defini­tive signs. However, in ordinary existence, 675 breaths flow through the central channel every day, and therefore the winds merely entering the cen­436 Part y.

However, when the winds are definitely flowing equally through both nostrils through the force of practice, with the body, eyes, and mind positioned and placed, the winds will have entered the central channel through the power of meditation. From the ten winds entering the dhutl, the night signs will arise. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:“Signs” refers to the appearances that are like clouds, smoke, and so forth. Those ending with the lamp are seen first.137The commentary Filled w ith Qualities also says:Concerning “smoke” and so forth: pervading everything inside and out, a smokelike empty-aspect appearance arises. Here too a cloudlike appearance arises without hindrance. As it is taught, first comes the cloudlike appearance, then the smokelike.138In the above passages the first sign is the cloud-like, the second is the smoke-like, followed by the mirage-like, firefly-like, lamp-like, and a vacu­ity like a clear sky. Although the signs are presented this way, here in the section on night signs the [369] cloud-like sign and the cloudless sky-like sign are not included.The above quote states, “everything inside and out is pervaded by a smoke-like appearance,” meaning that when the four signs first appear, they seem to pervade everything inside and outside the body. Later, as one’s meditational development becomes more stable, the signs appear within the dhutl. The Great Commentary on verse 121 of the Gnosis chap­ter clearly says:Here, initially, the yogi places the winds in the central channel, by which he will see the signs within the avadhuti.139The first sign gradually appears in the form of blue wisps of smoke. N oth­ing else is seen. After that a bluish shimmering miragelike appearance occurs. When that has cleared, the fireflies sign arises. After that the form of a flame appears.

This is not the position of Jé Tsongkhapa. Notes taken by discerning disciples on Jé Tsongkhapa’s actual words on the six yogas reveal that the night signs arise from the winds merely entering the dhütï. The day signs do not appear from the winds merely entering the dhütï but arise from a special way of entering. Savaripa also says:By the ten winds entering the dhütï, the day and night signs will be seen, this is the branch of withdrawal.140These lines say that the signs arise from the winds entering the central channel but say nothing about the winds abiding and dissolving there. The tantra and commentary says:“The vajra path is entered.” Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness the signs of smoke and so forth are seen.141[370] Many similar quotes state that the signs of smoke and so on arise from the winds entering the central channel, but nowhere is there a passage that talks of the winds having to abide and dissolve. Reliable Indian texts also talk of the signs arising from the winds entering the dhütï but say nothing of the winds having to abide and dissolve.

In night­time yoga you have described the positioning of the eyes as being on the space that is the opening at the upper tip of the central channel. For such a positioning it would make no sense to talk of clouds or lack of clouds.” There is no contradiction. The positioning of the eyes for both day and night yogas must be the same. The Great Commentary, on verse 119 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:“Cakri” means Usnlsa. “W ith his wrathful look” means the yogi sits with eyes not closed, looking upward, and the signs will appear. These are the four of the night yoga and the six of the day yoga.146This teaches that “eyes not closed and looking upward” is the common position of the eyes for both day and night yogas. I have explained and established by scripture and reason the positioning of the eyes for the night yoga. The line “look with eyes wide open” will be explained later.In his writings the omniscient dharma master Buton says:The way of looking, the actions, the bindings, and the mental placement on the object of meditation is similar to the previous."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 441One difference is that the mind is projected [372] into the sphere of cloud-free space, not traveling to or distracted by surround­ing objects but one-pointedly held in meditation.147As a source for this assertion the passage beginning “This is the daytime yoga. Into pure cloudless space” is quoted. He is asserting that the posi­tioning of the eyes is similar to that of the night yoga but that there is a dif­ference in the mental placement, as taught by the commentary words “pure cloudless space.” It appears he asserts this “space” to be external cloudless space. Moreover many Tibetan lamas teach that this “space” refers to the positioning of the eyes and is external space. This appears to be an impor­tant subject for discussion, and I will explain the thinking of the tantra and commentary as I understand it.When entering the day yoga, meditation is first performed with the eye positioning, posture, and mental placement of the night yoga. This will produce the signs of smoke and so forth, which ensures a continuation into the quick appearance of the day signs. The way this happens is as fol­lows. At the end of the four nighttime signs, a totally pure and cloudless space—like appearance arises and appears to the yogi, who looks into it with wide-open celestial eyes or with fleshly eyes. From such a totally pure and cloudless space-like appearance come the six day signs of the blazing and so forth. Therefore, in the quote, “Into pure cloudless space the yogi should look with eyes wide open,” “space” must refer to the cloudless space-like appearance that occurs after the four signs of smoke and so forth have arisen, and the “eyes” that are wide open must refer to either celestial eyes or fleshly eyes. This is so because when meditating on the day yoga, the first appearance is that of the cloudless space that follows on from the last of the four nighttime signs. Immediately after that comes the appearance of the daytime signs. Moreover, during that spacelike appearance, it would make no sense to say that we look at it with the ordinary ripened eyes we possess now, because from the moment the first of the four night signs of smoke and so forth arise, the subject and object connection necessary for [373] engaging in external form is broken.Some might reply: “If it could be established that in the practice of day­time yoga meditation, the four signs of smoke and so forth arise first, fol­lowed by the cloudless space-like appearance, and then finally the day signs, then it would be as you assert. But where is the scriptural evidence to prove that in the daytime yoga meditation, first the four signs of smoke"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"442- Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stageand so forth arise, followed by the cloudless space-like appearance, and then immediately by the day signs?”This scriptural evidence is very important and will be explained exten­sively. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:Here “self-blessing” refers to withdrawal, wherein conventional emptiness is seen. “Signs” refers to the appearances that are like clouds, smoke, and so forth. Those ending with the lamp are seen first. Then comes a totally pure cloudless space. In other tantras are [374] found other signs, such as blazing and so forth, ending with drops. These six signs are spoken of by the Buddha in the Net of Meditative Concentration chapter of the N e t o f Illusion Tantra:“Self-created, created from space, the great fire of wisdom knowledge, the great light illuminating, the brilliance of gnosis,“a lamp for beings, a lamp of wisdom, great radiance and clear light, greatest of knowledge, mighty secret,the king of secret mantra, accomplisher of great purpose.”148With these two verses in the N e t o f Illusion Tantra, the Buddha speaks of the signs using provisional language. The appearances that arise from the previously mentioned cloudless space arise from a mind totally devoid of conceptuality and therefore is “Self-created, created from space.” Here the great fire of wisdom knowledge is the appearance of “blazing.”149Scriptural evidence is clearly presented in this passage. How? The passage from “Here, ‘self-blessing’” up to “Then comes a totally pure cloudless space” describes how the night signs are presented in the Vajra T ent Tantra. From “In other tantras are found other signs” up to “using a provisional language” describes how the day signs are taught in the Net of Meditative Concentration chapter of the N e t o f Illusion Tantra. The phrase “the pre­"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 443viously mentioned cloudless space” in the next sentence refers to the cloud­less space of “a totally pure cloudless space” mentioned in the description of the night signs. The “appearances” in the line “the appearances that arise from the previously mentioned cloudless space” are the day signs of blaz­ing and so forth. The appearance of the day signs of blazing and so forth arise from “a mind totally devoid of conceptuality” in its cloudless space-like aspect, hence the line, “Self-created, created from space.” To what does this line refer? This is answered by the lines “the great fire of gno­sis” and so forth, which are lines spoken “using provisional language,” and therefore “Here, the great fire of wisdom knowledge is the appearance of ‘blazing.’” This is the meaning of the passage.The “cloudless space” explained in this passage on the night signs, “‘The fourth a burning lamp, the fifth a constant clarity, like a cloudless sky.’ Then the form of fire, preceded by an appearance similar to that of cloud­less space” is a cloudless space determined as arising after smoke, mirage, fireflies, and lamp have appeared in that order. On top of that “The pre­viously mentioned cloudless space” refers to the space in the line “Then comes a totally pure cloudless space,” and immediately after the spacelike appearance of “The previously mentioned cloudless space,” the day signs of blazing and so forth appear. This therefore establishes that in the med­itation on the day yoga, the day signs will appear immediately after the four preceding night signs and after the cloudless space, which itself is like a night sign.Furthermore Naropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on In itia ­tions says: [375]In the glorious Guhyasamaja and others, the first and second are taught in reverse order:“To the mind of vajra cessation signs, closely held, will appear.The first is the form of a mirage, the second that of smoke, the third is light in the sky, the fourth a burning lamp, the fifth a constant clarity, like a cloudless sky.”"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"444 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageThen the form of fire, preceded by an appearance similar to that of cloudless space, blazes in the form of an empty appearance.This continues up to “Appearing in the form of a moon mandala,” and immediately after that the commentary states:These six signs arise from cloudless space-like appearance. Therefore this is the day yoga and the yoga “without cover.”150This passage also clearly teaches that by meditating on the day yoga, the signs of smoke and so on up to the cloudless space-like appearance are deliberately produced initially, after which the day signs of blazing and so forth arise from that very cloudless space-like appearance.Similarly Filled w ith Good Qualities says:After the Guhyasamaja has explained the signs beginning with the mirage up to the cloudless space-like appearance, it talks of an empty form-like fire blazing out of the cloudless space-like appearance.151This is similar to Naropa’s descriptions. The Great Commentary also says:Then the yogi looks into the cloudless space, and from that space, the “self-created, created from space” of the yoga of day­time.152“Space” in the above line “Then the yogi looks into the cloudless space” has to be the cloudless space-like appearance that arises [376] after the four signs of smoke and so forth have appeared, because “from that space, the ‘self-created, created from space’ of the yoga of daytime” explains that this “space” is the space of “self-created, created from space,” and the space of “self-created, created from space” is spoken of in the Cakrasamvara Com­mentary as being the cloudless space-like appearance that arises after the appearance of the four signs of smoke and so forth.W hat are these celestial eyes and fleshly eyes that look upon the cloud­less space-like appearance that arises in day-yoga meditation following the appearance of the four signs from smokelike to lamplike?

The Great Commentary says:With tathagata fleshly eyes one first sees the appearances within one’s own mind.153On verse 116 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, the Great Com­mentary says:“Withdrawal” means that within the body, consciousness is unengaged in the connection between the ten subjects and objects. Five other eyes and so forth are engaged in empty-form objects.154Here “other eyes” refers to fleshly eyes. The Cakrasamvara Commentary also states:Here in withdrawal the five sense organs do not engage the five sense consciousnesses in the external objects, such as form. The celestial sense organs engage the celestial sense consciousnesses in inner objects.155The fleshly eyes also will arise from the withdrawal meditations. The Great Commentary, on verse 125 of the Gnosis chapter, says:In order, the fleshly eyes, celestial eyes, buddha eyes, wisdom eyes, and eyes of gnosis will arise from meditation.156Therefore the passage beginning with the phrase “Into pure cloudless space”157 teaches the place for day yoga meditation and explains the space of the cloudless space-like appearance [377] from which the day signs arise. Both the tantra and its commentary agree on this.Furthermore, even if the passage beginning “Into pure cloudless space” were applied to the eye positioning in the day yoga, as some lamas have asserted, the line “eyes not closed, looking upward” would still teach the common eye position for both night and day yogas. The way of looking"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"446 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stageupward in the night yoga would be as explained previously, whereas in the day yoga, both eyes would be wide open and look into external cloud-free space. This procedure would still not prevent the winds from entering the central channel, because during the night-yoga meditations, with the posi­tioning of the eyes and the placement of mind as explained previously, the winds would enter the central channel, and the night signs would appear. With the night yoga completed, the day yoga would begin, and at that time the winds in the central channel would have become well established. Because of this the mental placement is the same as the night yoga— the eyes are wide open and look into external cloud-free space. After the night signs have quickly arisen, the day signs of the blazing firelike appearance and so forth arise in the cloudless space-like appearance that occurs at the end of the night signs. Concerning the positioning of the eyes, the winds that operate through the entrances of the sense organ become stiff, the eyes do not blink, the eyeballs do not move but stare wide open into external space. This method also will accomplish the practice.To explain withdrawal according to the thinking of Tsongkhapa, an explanation of this passage from the tantra and commentary is very impor­tant, and yet other commentators have said nothing on this topic. Now I may be of little intelligence and weak in practice, but I would request the intelligent to examine well my rough explanation.The development of the signs Verse 115 of the Gnosis chapter says:[378] Blazing, moon, sun, vajras, the supreme part and the drop are seen.In the center the form of the Buddha, the nonobject, manifold sambhogakaya; in cloudless space the yogi looks with wide-open eyes, until a black line emitting rays of pure light is seen in the channel of time.158The commentary on this says:Then the yogi looks into cloudless space, and from that space comes the yoga of daytime, “self-created, created from space.”"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 447“The great fire of wisdom knowledge” is the blazing within the cloudless space. Likewise “the great light illuminating, the bril­liance of gnosis” is the moonlike appearance. [379} “A lamp for beings” is the sun. “The lamp of wisdom” is the vajra or Rahu.“The great radiance and clear light” is lightning, or the supreme part. “Greatest of knowledge, mighty secret” is the drop. These are the ten signs. The Buddha taught the night signs in the Guhyasamaja and others and the day signs in the Samgiti. “The king of secret mantra, accomplisher of great purpose” refers to seeing the fully aspected forms of the vase, friezes, and so forth.“In the center” means in the center of the drop, where is seen “the form of the Buddha.” Because it is nonsubstantial and unimputed, it is “the nonobject manifold sambhogakaya.”159Also:Look each day until, in the center of the drop, “a black line” the width of [380] a hair “emitting rays of stainless light is seen in the channel of time,” or avadhuti.160The above commentary describes the six signs and other signs arising after the completion of the ten signs.Similarly the Cakrasamvara Commentary says:Here “the great fire of wisdom knowledge” is the appearance of “blazing.” “The great light illuminating” is the moonlike appear­ance, which is also “the brilliance of gnosis.” “A lamp for beings” is the sunlike appearance. “The lamp of wisdom” is the Rahu- like appearance. “Great radiance and clear light” is the light­ninglike appearance. “Greatest of knowledge, mighty secret” is the droplike appearance. It is blue in color and shaped like the moon. “The king of secret mantra, accomplisher of great pur­pose” means that with the eyes created by withdrawal, the yogi sees all appearance within the three realms as being like illusions, like dreams, and like forms within a prognostic mirror.161These two commentaries clearly decode the “other language” used by the Sam giti to describe the six signs and the signs that arise after them.Therefore, after the completion of the night yoga, in a place for day-yoga"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"448 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagemeditation, as previously described, the posture and mental placement are the same as was described for the night yoga. Either of the two eye positions can be practiced. From the meditation the signs, from smoke to the cloud- free spacelike appearance, arise quickly. After that, in the very space of that spacelike appearance, the blazing firelike appearance occurs first, followed by the moonlike and the sunlike appearances. Then comes the Râhu-like appearance, like many sparks glittering in the dark. After that comes the “supreme” or lightning-flash appearance, followed by an appearance sim­ilar to a blue drop in the circular shape of a moon disk. After that various forms, such as those resembling a vase and so on, are seen. At the same time, in the center of the blue circular drop, a black line appears. It is the width of a hair and emits rays of stainless light. W ithin that line is the sambhogakaya in the form of Vajrasattva and consort in embrace as well as the three worlds in various forms, all of which are the nature of that sambhogakaya. The drop and the black line are seen in the ’’channel of time,” meaning the avadhütï central channel.Filled w ith Good Qualities also states:“Usnïsa form” is the form of the Buddha. “The three realms” means that in the center of the great drop is a black line in which various forms of the three worlds individually appear, all of which are of the nature of the sambhogakaya.162This passage appears to be the explanation of the above quote, “In the cen­ter of the drop, ‘a black line’ the width of a hair ‘emitting rays of stainless light is seen in the channel of time,’ or avadhütï.”W hat sees these phenomena? Nâropa, in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, says:The fleshly eye consciousnesses and so forth of the fleshly sense organs engage in the inner forms and focus on the inner empti­ness. Like forms seen by a clairvoyant maiden looking into her mirror, all imputed phenomena are seen within an unimputed emptiness. This is spoken of as the branch of withdrawal.163This passage states that by meditating on the objects of withdrawal yoga, the organ of the fleshly sight is developed. This is an organ other than the normal sight organ. The fleshly eye consciousness that arises from that"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 449organ of sight is what “sees” in withdrawal. The kinds of objects that the fleshly eye consciousness can generally apprehend are spoken of in Filled w ith Good Qualities:The fleshly eye sees phenomena up to one hundred yojana.164So how does it differ from the celestial eye? The same text says:The celestial eye sees the subtle and individual forms of limit­less world realms.165There is this difference, and although the Cakrasamvara Commentary talks of “celestial organs of the eyes,” it should be understood as referring to fleshly eyes.The nature of these empty forms is that they are images or reflections of the primordial clear-light mind, which itself appears as an object in the form of a cloudless space-like vacuity. These empty forms lack the substantiality of subtle particles, are not imputed by the mind, but are self-arising forms of smoke and so forth. The tantra and commentary say, “From the empti­ness, smoke and mirage.”166 The “emptiness” in this phrase refers to a vacu­ity that is an aspect of the clear-light mind, and the phrase itself means that from this vacuity arises its empty form images. The Cakrasamvara Com­mentary, which shares the thinking of the tantra and commentary, says:Inwardly, focusing on the emptiness, all unimputed phenomena are seen. These are like forms .seen in a mirror by a prognostic maiden, reflections of the three-world [381] forms of the Bud­dha. This is spoken of as the branch of withdrawal.167This passage speaks of focusing inwardly on the clear-light mind vacuity from which the empty forms are seen.

This pro­fundity is without apprehension, and within this nonapprehended state, smoke and the other signs of reliability will arise. The yogi, therefore, should meditate on this nonapprehended state.Likewise Naropa, in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, clearly says:The mind of emptiness, devoid of perceiver and perceived, is a wisdom consciousness. Its images appear directly to the yogi.169The first summary from the Realms chapter also says:Similarly the clear-light mind is not seen by the methods of conceptual meditation.In its actuality, with left channeland right channel as one, it will be seen.170This explains that the clear-light mind will not be seen by the methods of the conceptual meditations of the generation stage. How is it seen? It is seen in its actuality when the winds that flow within the left and right channels combine as one in the central channel. That is the meaning of this passage and others from the commentary that explain how the clear-light mind is seen as a result of the winds entering the central channel. It is the meaning also of many commentary passages previously quoted that talk of empty forms being seen as a result of the winds entering the central channel.The way smoke and the other empty forms arise as images of the clear- light mind is as follows. During the yoga of withdrawal the meditations upon the methods for bringing the winds into the central channel, as described previously, cause the winds to enter the central channel for the first time. [382] A little of the clear-light mind is experienced, from which arises the smokelike clear-light mind image. Then as the amount of wind entering the central channel gradually increases, so the clear-light mind becomes clearer, and the mirage, firefly, and lamplike signs arise as images of that mind until, finally, just a cloud-free spacelike vacuity appears. With the signs of the night yoga completed, the day yoga meditations begin. The signs from smoke up to the spacelike vacuity again arise quickly, and by looking at and meditating single-pointedly within this spacelike vacuity,"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 451the day signs arise. The preceding explanation is the definitive meaning of the following two passages from the Great Commentary:Here the winds enter the central channel, and from the total emptiness the signs of smoke and so forth are seen.171Also:Then the yogi looks into the cloudless space, and from that space, the “self-created, created from space” of the yoga of day­time.172That the meaning of “Then the yogi looks into the cloudless space” and so on is as it has just been explained is clearly supported by the Cakrasamvara Commentary as previously quoted.Lamas of the past have explained the “space” as external or actual space and the “emptiness” of “From the emptiness, smoke and mirage” as refer­ring to nonaspected emptiness or as a totally nonapprehended source. This position also needs deliberation.When this natural clear-light mind is manifest, empty forms such as smoke appear as images of this mind, like forms appearing in a prognostic mirror. When the death clear-light mind is manifest at the time of death, the empty forms are as described in the Inner chapter. When the primor­dial clear-light mind is made manifest on the path by the ten winds enter­ing the central channel, images of this clear-light mind are formed, like the sun and its rays. These appear as various empty forms, like forms in a clair­voyant’s mirror. [383] These empty forms become clearer until finally their characteristics are that they become limitless and obscuration-free phe­nomena of the three worlds. This is the wheel (cakra) of Kalacakra and is the wisdom of method and wisdom. The clear-light mind itself, in depend­ence on other factors, become the cause for the supreme and unchanging consciousness freed from all obscuration. This is time (kdla) and is the method of method and wisdom. Such phenomena and consciousness, or wisdom and method, become the inseparable and unified wheel of time. The Great Commentary, in the Supreme and Unchanging Consciousness summary in the fifth chapter, states:The conqueror Kalacakra is of the nature of method and wis­dom. This is taught as a relationship between consciousness and"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"452 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagephenomena. Here the supreme and unchanging consciousness is the cause that puts an end to all obstruction. This is said to be “time” and method. The limitless phenomena of the three worlds are the “wheel” and the wisdom. That consciousness and those phenomena as one, is the wheel of time.173By focusing on these empty forms of smoke and so forth that are unified with the clear-light mind and meditating single-pointedly, they become the limitless and obscuration-free phenomena of the three worlds. The clear-light mind itself, developed into unchanging bliss and placed in sin­gle-pointed meditative equipoise upon emptiness, will create the dhar- makaya indivisibility of emptiness and unchanging great bliss, which is in an inseparable union with the limitless and obscuration-free phenomena.The empty forms of smoke and so forth, especially the enjoyment body in the form of Vajrasattva and consort in embrace that appears in the cen­ter of the black hairwidth line, are similar-type causes and bases for the accomplishment of the resultant empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and- father embrace. The empty forms of smoke and so forth, especially those of the three realms such as the vase that appear like the forms in a clair­voyant’s mirror after the ten signs have appeared, are bases for the accom­plishment of the various obscuration-free empty forms. Therefore these have to be the primary objects of single-pointed meditation. [384]During the yogas of withdrawal, meditative absorption, and so forth, the features of the individual empty forms clearly appear to the mind, but beyond that these forms cannot perform their individual functions. How­ever every empty form at its resultant stage is capable of performing its own function of form, fire, and so forth. This is a great difference. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:Therefore the Buddha has said that the initial signs of smoke and so forth are signs at the time of meditation. All those who say “at the time of accomplishment” are finding fault with the assertions of the Buddha. They are dismissing teachings of the Buddha, such as, “All thoughts abandoned, meditate for a day.”At the time of accomplishment, the illusionlike and dreamlike worldly smoke and so forth are no longer signs. Here is actual smoke and fire, capable of performing the function of burning.It is the same with the rain of saffron, flowers, jewels, and gold."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 453Therefore the signs of smoke and so forth appear within the six- branched yoga.174The word “here” from the phrase “Here is actual smoke” means “here at the time of accomplishment,” and the passage therefore makes the point clearly. This passage also refutes the assertion that the signs of smoke and so forth are ultimate truths and that to see them is to see the dharmakâya. This is so because this passage teaches that the empty forms of withdrawal yoga transform into perfected resultant empty forms, and that which is an ultimate truth cannot be perfected. Moreover it is contradictory to assert that the dharmakâya can perform functions of burning and so forth. Fur­thermore the Cakrasamvara Commentary says:Here “self-blessing” refers to withdrawal, wherein conventional emptiness is seen. “Signs” refers to the appearances that are like clouds, smoke, and so forth. Those ending with the lamp are seen first.175This passage states that the signs of smoke and so forth are conventional truths. Nâropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations says the same.176 It should be understood [385] that these passages refute empty forms as ultimate truths.177Common meditative concentrations by themselves that do not focus on bringing winds into the dhütï can bring about the appearance of moonlike, sunlike, and vajralike signs. This is stated in the Lankdvatdrosütra.m Med­itations that do focus on bringing the winds into the dhütï can also bring about the signs of smoke and so forth before the winds enter the dhütï. Therefore it is important not to confuse these two with the definitive signs of withdrawal. If the former is confused with definitive withdrawal signs, the practitioner will go astray by holding non-Buddhist meditative con­centrations and some common meditative concentrations as being com- pletion-stage paths. If the latter is confused with definitive withdrawal signs, the practitioner will wrongly assume the accomplishment of with­drawal before the winds have entered the dhütï. You will look to see if you possess the benefits that accrue from attaining withdrawal as taught in the tantra and commentary, and realizing you do not, you will create the karma and obstruction of thinking that what has been taught in the tantras is not true. So how can we differentiate between the signs of smoke and so forth"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"454 Fart 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stagethat appear before the winds enter the central channel and those that appear afterward? The Later Guhyasamdja Tantra says, “From the stable vajra path,”179 and its commentary Bright Lamp says:“From the stable vajra path” means the progression of the five signs, not transgressed.180Therefore, when the signs of smoke and so forth appear in the proper order and are focused on and meditated upon in this order, it is an indication that the winds have entered the dhutl.Ritual of enhancement at times of nonaccomplishment Verse 119 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:If by withdrawal and so forththe wishes of the mantra practitioner are not m et.. ,181This and following lines in the tantra and commentary teach the enhance­ment rituals of the withdrawal and pranayama yogas. Pranayama is included in the phrase “and so forth” [386] and will be discussed in its own section. Concerning the enhancement necessary here for the withdrawal yoga, Opening the Eye to W hat Is H idden says:The forceful practice of the yogis should be known. When the yogas of withdrawal and so forth bring about the appearance of various form bodies in the body of emptiness, and yet the yogi has not bound the winds and therefore not developed an instance of the bliss of nonemission, at that time the yogi should practice the wrathful method and the nada meditation, which will be explained later. The yogi straightens the body, sits in vajra position, with breath natural and mind undistracted. With the right hand gradually press the veins of the neck or the two sleep-countering veins, and remain unmoving. Do this gently again and again, many times, for as long as the upper body and the head remain without pain. If this is done, the winds will flow into the central channel, and the four drops of bodhicitta that have entered the vajra jewel placed inside the lotus of wis­"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 455dom are prevented from leaving, thereby creating bliss. This bliss, not approaching a hundredth part of that nonfalling, sim- ilar-to-cause bliss, has nevertheless accomplished the significance of the body comprising instances of innate bliss. Therefore it will be seen in this life. This is the first wrathful method.182As this passage explains, some people may meditate on the objects of with­drawal, causing the signs of smoke and so forth to arise, but the winds will not have entered the central channel. If that happens, the ritual for enhancement is as follows. How it is actually performed is described in the lines from “The yogi straightens the body” until “and the head remain without pain.” Straightening the body and so forth means to adopt the body and eye positions of withdrawal. The thumb and ring finger of the right hand gradually press the right and left neck veins or the right and left sleep-countering veins. The mind remains single-pointedly placed and unmoving in its focus. This is to be practiced quite gently again and again. How many times? For as long as the upper body and the head are without pain. If this is done, the winds will flow in the central channel. The winds, flowing in the central channel will prevent the bodhicitta [387] drops falling from the opening of the jewel. When in union with a mudra consort, the four drops of bodhicitta that create the four periods of waking, dream, sleep, and sexual bliss, and which have entered the yogi’s vajra jewel placed inside the lotus of the wisdom consort, are stopped and do not emerge from the opening of the jewel. This creates the ascending innate bliss. “This bliss, not approaching,” or not standing comparison with, “a hundredth part of that nonfalling,” or unchanging, “similar-to-cause bliss, has never­theless accomplished,” or created, “the significance,” or cause, of the body comprising instances of innate bliss. Therefore this body of great innate bliss will be seen and accomplished in this life. The lines from “If this is done, the winds will flow into the central channel” onward teach the func­tion and benefits of this enhancement ritual.At the completion of withdrawal yoga, one can choose to use a mudra consort or not. If a consort is used, the ability to prevent the bodhicitta from leaving the jewel will have been achieved.If this ritual is performed and the winds have still not entered the cen­tral channel, Opening the Eye to W hat Is H idden describes a method for inducing bliss:"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"456 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageNow the second forceful method will be described. When in meditative union with wisdom, who is the nature of emptiness, and there arises a hot sensation on the body or the sensation of tingling at the opening of the downwardly expelling wind chan­nel in the secret place of the method, who is the nature of com­passion, press the base of the vajra jewel with the right hand.W ith the body unmoving concentrate the mind in bliss and draw it up. Push the flesh of the lower stomach against the joint.183 Stare with eyes wide open. Bend the toes in and stretch out the heel. W ith both wisdom and method unmoving and mind placed on bliss, this is the second forceful practice.184The phrase “wisdom, who is the nature of emptiness” refers to the consort. “Method, who is the nature of compassion” refers to the yogi. The rest is not difficult to understand. [388] This practice must be learned from a lama. The above explanation from Opening the Eye to W hat Is H idden has been reproduced here because it is necessary for practice, but in the think­ing of the tantra it is to be explained in the section on pranayama.In the writings of the dharma master Buton it states:In the Kalacakrapada Transmission it is said:“The enhancement of withdrawal forcefully completes binding and activities.”185When the body and eyes are not in their positions, attempt to position them in the daylight, and check if this has been been accomplished. If not, then as before, enter into meditation according to this excellent instruction.186Therefore both the dharma master Buton and the Kalacakrapada Trans- mission maintain that this particular enhancement practice is for correcting the posture and eye position. This is not correct because this enhancement ritual is to be performed when, having implemented the posture and eye position as described previously, the meditation does not bring the winds into the central channel. Therefore the words of Je Tsongkhapa, “instruc­tion on the initial meditation is not suitable to be an enhancement rit­ual”187 are very true."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 457Some practitioners of the past have advised, “Stare blankly into a cop­per vessel full of water. Look at that blankness and into space, and empty forms will arise.” This and many other rituals described as being the enhancement ritual of this section seem mostly to be rituals for producing the appearance of empty forms, whereas the teachings on the enhancement ritual taught in the tantra and commentary at this juncture are for occasions during withdrawal yoga when the empty forms have appeared but the winds have not entered the central channel.Even dying with the remainder of the meditations unfinished, the power of the yoga ensures continuationVerse 97 of the Inner chapter states:W ith the mighty yogas unachieved, should the migration of the mind bring death, the yogi will be born into a great and powerful family in a glorious human world possessed of the yoga.By past familiarity, once again the yogi will hold the pure and vast gnosis yoga.The yogi, achieving gnosis,travels to a place supreme and eternal,never to take birth anywhere again.188[389] If a practitioner practicing a yoga such as withdrawal dies before attaining the higher yogas, in his next life he will be born in buddha and bodhisattva families endowed with the foundation for the practice of mantra. On that foundation he will meditate on the remainder of the path and attain the highest state of the unity of unchanging great bliss and the empty form endowed with every supreme aspect.Valid cognitionThe fleshly eye sensory consciousness arises in dependence upon the fleshly eye sense organ. It sees clearly the empty forms of smoke and so forth, it is undeceiving, and therefore it is a sensory and direct valid cognition. This is in keeping with the Vajragarbha Commentary, which describes with­drawal as a sensory and direct valid cognition.189 Likewise Opening the Eye to W hat Is H idden says:"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"458 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageHere, concerning the objects that appear to the mind, the tathâ- gata fleshly eye sees for a thousand yojana. Similarly the pure celestial eye sees for two thousand yojarta. The pure eye of the Buddha sees the minds and consciousnesses of others. The Bud­dha taught the five sights in the Dharmasamgïtisütra. They are, in order, the fleshly eye, celestial eye, eye of the Buddha, eye of wisdom, and eye of gnosis, and they will arise by the power of the yogi placing the mind in the avadhütl and meditating. Then there is nothing that the omniscient mind does not see or does not understand.190The first sentence of this passage describes how empty forms of withdrawal are seen by the fleshly eye consciousness. The next three sentences from “Similarly” up to “Dharmasamgïtisütra”describe how empty forms are seen by the remaining four sights on the progressively higher paths, as well as indicating the sutra source for the five sights. The next sentence, beginning “They are, in order” teaches that the five sights arise from the winds and the mind being brought inside the central channel. The last sentence teaches [390] that there is nothing the perfection of the five sights or enlightened gnosis does not see or understand.This passage from Opening the Eye to W hat Is Hidden is similar to the pas­sage in the Great Commentary on verse 119 of the Gnosis chapter, which says:With tathàgata fleshly eyes one first sees the appearances within one’s own mind. With the celestial and other eyes, the minds and consciousnesses of others are seen. In the D harm asam ­gïtisütra the Conqueror taught the five sights. They are, in order, fleshly eyes, celestial eyes, Buddha eyes, wisdom eyes, and eyes of gnosis. These will arise from meditation.191The descriptions of these sights in Naropa’s Commentary on a Short Teach­ing on Initiations and the Cakrasamvara Commentary can be seen in previ­ous quotations from these texts.Purification divisionsThe gnosis aggregate, gnosis element, and so forth of the gnosis-aggregate group are the six phenomena to be purified in withdrawal yoga. Withdrawal"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Withdrawal: Day Yoga 459is the purifier and is of the Vajrasattva family. The divisions are the ten signs of smoke and so forth. Verse 115 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:Withdrawal is Vajrasattva and the ten forms.On this the Great Commentary says:The first practice is withdrawal. This is Vajrasattva, the gnosis aggregate. Because that is divided into ten signs, there are “ten forms” that appear. They are smoke, mirage, fireflies, lamp, blazing, moon, sun, Rahu, part, and drop. These form the unimputed gnosis aggregate.What are the six phenomena of the gnosis aggregate group? They are gno­sis aggregate, gnosis element, mind, sound, the supreme organ, and the emission of urine. These six are the bases of purification for the paths of the Vajrasattva family. When purified these six become free of obscuration, are of a single taste, and are fused together as one. [391] Vajrasattva pervades all families, and so it should be understood that withdrawal yoga pervades all lower paths.ResultsThere are immediate and final results. On the immediate results, verse 118 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:In withdrawal the yogi apprehends no objects and is blessed by every mantra.192On this the Great Commentary says:By the power of withdrawal, when the forms are stable and the yogi has attained purification, he is blessed by every mantra and is able to perform giving by words and so forth.193The Guhyasamaja says:"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"The meditator by withdrawal is blessed by every mantra.194When the yogi has completed withdrawal yoga, he is blessed by every mantra and develops the power of “giving bywords.” For example, by say­ing “Let there be no poison,” the poison disappears.The final result of withdrawal is the complete nonobscuration of the six phenomena of the gnosis aggregate in the form of Vajrasattva, Jnana- paramita, and so forth.460 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stage"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"e Yoga of Meditative AbsorptionThe second yoga, the stabilizing meditative absorptionThis has six outlines:1.

Although this appears to be based on the fact that meditative absorption yoga is the branch of Aksobhya, it is not clearly stated in the tantra and commentary. Therefore our own position is that the meditation begins after the appearance of the tenth sign and the vari­ous empty forms that subsequently appear. The tenth sign is the sambhogakaya form seen in the black line inside the drop. A Short Teach­ing on Initiations says:Like dreams, forms are seen.Meditate constandy on these forms.202Naropa, in his commentary to this text, says:“Forms” are various forms. “Meditate” means to stabilize with the branch of meditative absorption.203The same commentary says:The time for approximation is that firstly one meditates with withdrawal, and then one stabilizes with the branch of medita­tive absorption.204"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Absorption 463Therefore the ten signs and the subsequent various empty forms are achieved by withdrawal, and stabilization is accomplished by meditative absorption.

Signs of accomplishmentPurpose of the meditationThe purpose of the meditation is to stabilize the empty forms achieved during withdrawal. This can be understood from the above quote from Naropa’s commentary beginning “The time for approximation.”Actual way to meditateThis has two outlines:1. Refuting the position of others2. Our own positionRefuting the position of othersSome, thinking it to be the position of Tsongkhapa, say:Empty forms appearing during meditative-absorption yoga are all conceived by one’s own effort. They are transformed into the forms of deities one has the greater meditative familiarity with and that appear easily to the mind. These are meditated on repeatedly, and upon the culmination of that meditation, one transforms them into forms of Kalacakra. After this practice they all transform into light and absorb into one another to become the form of Kalacakra in the form of Vajrasattva and consort. Previously this form appeared at a distance from oneself,"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"464 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagebut from here onward one’s mind enters this form and becomes indivisible with it. Pride is generated and meditation is per­formed again and again. Finally the deity no longer appears at a distance from oneself, and one is able to transfer a natural uncontrived pride to the deity. Such a meditation creates a spe­cial basis for the development of deity form in the branch of recollection.205This passage is from an instruction manual. It may sound very profound, but I cannot see it as being correct, because the empty forms in this and other secdons are not imputed or conceived by the mind at all but must arise on their own accord. The fifth summary from the Realms chapter says:That which is taught as ultimate truth is beyond the world, and is for the attainment of the mahamudra siddhi endowed with every supreme feature. It grants the desired result, manifestly appearing in the space of the yogi’s clear-light mind, like images in a mirror seen by a maiden, devoid of phenomena imputed by the mind. It produces the gnosis of unchanging bliss.206Also: [394]Because the form of the Buddha is without substance and because it is unimputed.207Similar passages are found throughout the tantra and commentary, and yet you say that the empty forms that appear during meditative absorption are deliberately conceived by the mind and changed into the forms of deities? It would follow, too, that the ten signs that appear during with­drawal would also have to be transformed by the mind into forms of deities.According to the above assertion it seems that if it were not possible to transform the various manifest empty forms into deities and especially into a single Kalacakra mother and father, then the appearance of these empty forms would have no purpose. However Kalacakra in the form of Vajrasattva mother and father adorned with the features and signs in the black line is stabilized by meditative absorption and is the basis of the empty-form Kalacakra of the branch of recollection. Likewise the various aspected empty forms, such as the vase and so forth, that appear after the ten signs are also stabilized by meditative absorption and are the perfect basis for the"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Absorption 465unobscured empty forms of enlightenment. There is no need to transform them into the forms of deities. Verse 122 of the Gnosis chapter says:The emptiness becomes the forms of the ten signs.The signs are fully aspected and become the unending, supreme indestructible bliss.208On this the commentary says:Likewise the emptiness becomes the definite forms of the ten signs of smoke and so forth, and the signs are fully aspected form. From the forms comes the unchanging bliss.209Therefore the emptiness, which is the clear-light mind in its aspect of vacu­ity, becomes the ten signs of smoke and so forth, and the signs of the var­ious empty forms such as the vases and friezes are fully aspected forms. The passage says that the unchanging bliss comes from these fully aspected forms. It does not say that they are transformed into the forms of deities. On these empty forms of the vases, friezes, and so forth being fully aspected forms, the Great Commentary says: [395]The fully aspected forms of the vases, friezes, and so forth are seen.210Furthermore the previous assertion is not that of Je Tsongkhapa. His Notes on Kdlacakra says:Withdrawal is meditation for the creation of form not yet cre­ated. Meditative absorption is meditation for the stabilization of form already created. What is the object to be stabilized after the meditation? The continuity of the object of meditation itself is to be stabilized.211Therefore the empty forms are single-pointedly concentrated upon as they appear in the meditations of withdrawal. Some apply this particular way of meditating to each branch. This is not correct, because this branch is at a level of insight that only comes from the mental placement of meditative absorption, which will now be explained."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"466 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageOur own positionThe meditation is performed in the place of day or night withdrawal yoga with eye and body positions and mental placements held as in withdrawal. When the empty forms arise, it is these forms that are single-pointedly concentrated upon. A Short Teaching on In itia tio n s says that meditative absorption focuses constantly upon the empty forms themselves:Like dreams, forms are seen.Meditate constantly on these forms.212The Kalacakrapada Transmission also says:The objects of mind are empty forms.On empty forms of previous meditation, mind is placed looking into space.Mind placed in emptiness is wisdom.213This is also J6 Tsongkhapa’s position, as can be understood from the above quote from Notes on Kalacakra.SubdivisionsVerse 116 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter states:Meditative absorption also is wisdom, conception, discernment, joy, and unmoving bliss of a single-pointed mind.214On this the Great Commentary says: [396]Similarly, within this form, there is “wisdom,” which means the view, “conception,“ meaning apprehending phenomena, “dis­cernment,” meaning ascertainment, “joy,” meaning attraction to form, and “unmoving bliss,” meaning the mind and form together as one.215Naropa explains these by commenting on them as they appear in the Later GuhyasamajOy which says:"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Absorption 467Meditative absorption is in five forms: conception, discernment, joy, bliss, and single-pointed mind.This is meditative absorption in brief.216These are the five divisions in brief. The tantra continues with their expla­nation:Three secrets arising is conception;its application is discernment;vivid joy the third; gathered bliss the fourth;self-mind, the cessation of arising consciousnessand objects of consciousness, is the fifth;it is of the nature of all buddhas,it is pacification,all desire abides this way.217The meaning of these verses Naropa has explained in his Commentary ona Short Teaching on Initiations*.Concerning “three secrets” and so forth, the three times and three realms, whose nature is the enlightened body, speech, and mind, are the three secrets. The one-time mind, holding just their rough forms vividly illuminated as the three realms, is the “arising.” Experiencing and understanding this is the “three secrets arising.” That is “conception.” “Its application is dis­cernment” means discernment applied to the objects of con­ception. The apprehending of phenomena possessed of animate and inanimate characteristics, such as the vase and the friezes and so forth, is “discernment.” “Vivid joy” means joy that is the blissful state keeping the mind on all objects held by discern­ment. “Gathered bliss” means that the experience of the blissful state coming from the mind dwelling in all phenomena becomes a cause of great pliancy within the body. Concerning “self-mind, the cessation of arising consciousness,” etc., “consciousness” refers to the six consciousnesses of sight and so forth that engage the “objects of consciousness,” which in turn refers to the final­ity of the six spheres of phenomena. “Arising” means the arising of these consciousnesses and objects of consciousnesses. Their"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"468 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage“cessation” is the single-pointed mind [397] in which the appre­hending and the apprehended are possessed of the characteris­tics of emptiness. This is “self-mind.” Self-mind in such a form is in the nature of all buddhas. Because concepts of form and so forth have been pacified, there is “pacification” appearing vividly as the three realms. This is the sole and ultimate emptiness. Concerning “all desire abides,” “all desire” means all phenom­ena, and these phenomena abide in a form vivid and indivisible from one’s mind.218This passage should be explained a little. “Three secrets arising” is the meaning of conception. What are the three secrets and what does “aris­ing” mean? Empty forms appearing in the aspects of the three times and the three realms and whose natures are the enlightened body, speech, and mind are the three secrets. “Arising” refers to the “one-time” mind holding the rough or coarse aspects of the vivid empty forms appearing as the three realms. In short, experiencing and perceiving in a rough but vivid form, the empty forms, whose nature is the enlightened body, speech, and mind, and which appear in the forms of the animate and inanimate phenomena of the three times and three realms, is what is meant by “three secrets aris­ing.” That is the first branch, called conception.Application to the objects of conception is the division of discernment. How is this application carried out? The objects of conception are the empty forms of animate and inanimate phenomena, and the details of these empty-form phenomena, such as those of the vases, friezes, and so forth, are discerned and clearly appear. This is discernment.Although mental pliancy is the actual cause of the mind being naturally settled on the detailed empty forms that make up the objects of discern­ment, joy is a blissful or joyful mind that induces such a state. Bliss is the bliss of the physical pliancy that arises from the mind being single-point- edly held on the discerned empty forms.The “single-pointed mind” spoken of in the Later Guhyasamaja is the same as the “wisdom” taught in the tantra and commentary and is explained by lines beginning “self-mind, the cessation of arising con­sciousness.” [398] Consciousness here refers to the six consciousnesses from sight to mental consciousness. “Objects of consciousness” refers to the six objects from visual form to mental phenomena. “Arising” refers to the six consciousnesses engaging with the six objects. “Cessation” refers to severing"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Absorption 469the connection of the apprehending subject and the apprehended object, which lies between the mind with its six consciousnesses and the six objects themselves. The main characteristic of the “emptiness” that is the severing of this connection is the “single-pointed mind,” spoken of as “self-mind.” Although connections between the five sensory consciousnesses and their objects are severed from withdrawal yoga onward, the same is not true of the connection between mental consciousness and its objects. Therefore, up to the division of bliss in meditative absorption, the empty forms and the mental consciousness that abides single-pointedly within them exist in sep­arate aspects as apprehended and apprehender. However the empty-form objects and clear-light-mind subject do not exist in separate aspects as apprehended and apprehender. Subject and object are as one. This “self­mind” is a single-pointed mind, indivisible from all buddhas in the aspect of empty forms. In particular it is indivisible from the empty-form Kalacakra in the aspect of mother-father embrace. In this way “concepts of apprehended form,” or objects, “and so forth,” referring to the appre­hending consciousness, “have been pacified.” “Therefore this pacification” is the “sole and ultimate” mind, indivisible from the “emptiness” form “appearing vividly as the three realms,” and especially indivisible from the empty form that is Kalacakra in mother-and-father union.Measure of completionDuring withdrawal, meditation is directed upon the sites of penetrative focusing within the body. When empty forms arise, these are meditated upon with constant single-pointed equipoise. In the branches of concep­tion and discernment, rough empty forms followed by detailed empty forms are seen. The continuity of these empty forms is single-pointedly focused upon and, at the end of a continuous session of meditative con­centration, joy and bliss, induce the twin benefits of mental and physical pliancy. The empty-form apparition of Kalacakra mother and father, as a mere appearance within one’s mind, [399] is indivisibly mixed with one’s own mind. That enlightened form no longer appears as mind, and one is able to move self-pride effortlessly to that enlightened form. At that time meditative absorption has been accomplished. From then onward one moves into prànàyàma yoga.To summarize: In the branch of meditative absorption, the body and eye positioning and the mental placement are the same as in withdrawal."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Meditation brings about a special entry of the winds into the dhutl, from which the winds of the indicative conceptual states of mind are stopped from flowing through the right and left channels, and the conceptions themselves are halted. The nonconceptual mind of clear light arises together with empty forms, which are vividly seen by the meditator with a fleshly eye consciousness. These forms, and especially the empty-form Kalacakra mother and father that appears within the black line inside the dhutl at the midway point between the eyebrows, are single-pointedly focused on by the clear-light mind. From the ensuing meditation the empty-form objects and clear-light-mind subject merge indivisibly until all appearance of a separate apprehender and apprehended is lost, and the yogi is able to transfer self­pride to the form of Kalacakra mother and father. The empty form in its appearance as Kalacakra mother and father, to which self-pride has been transferred, is the basis and similar-type cause for the actual realization of the sambhogakaya Kalacakra mother and father during the branch of rec­ollection and the resultant state.Signs o f accomplishmentThe previously described signs become more and more distinct until they are of a brilliant clarity. Moreover appearances of limitless buddha fields and limitless beings of the six realms arise. Empty-form images of pleasant and unpleasant sounds, smells never before experienced, pleasant and unpleasant tastes, and sensations, such as heat and cold, all appear. At first they appear externally, and then they appear inside the black line. When they are purified, clairvoyance will arise. This description is according to the dharma master Buton.219 [400]Valid cognitionBecause the empty forms are clearly seen by clairvoyant eyes and such seeing is nondeceptive, the cognition is a sensory and direct valid cognition.Purification divisions The Great Commentary says:470 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Absorption 471“Meditative absorption is Aksobhya” refers to the consciousness aggregate.

In his writings it says:“Meditate forcefully on the empty forms of meditative absorp­tion” means in order to make firm the activities, bindings, and body positions, centralize the mind by way of the previous instructions.224As in withdrawal yoga the practice of correcting the body positions and so forth [401] cannot be an enhancement ritual. Also in his writings he quotes verse 195 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, the first of the last forty verses left by the Great Commentary as “easy to understand” verses, which says:Turn from the sun, stand in its rays, and stare at your shadow, externally examine the pure sky, and a person that is the color of smoke and one with the sky will be seen.With six months meditative yoga becomes pure, earth’s treasures will be seen through earth’s openings.Or move to the shadow of a tree,and in the heart of space, garlands of drops will form.On the meaning of this verse he comments:In an isolated place, turn your back to the sun. In front of you look at your shadow with meditative-absorption placement. Then look into the cloudless sky, and a shadow person will be seen. Look at this with the samadhi of meditative absorption. If you meditate in (this way for six months, the meditative absorp­tion will become pure, and you will see the treasures beneath the earth.

Then look into space, stabilize with meditative-absorption meditation, and in six months you will see the treasures.225He maintains that this passage from the tantra teaches an enhancement ritual. Because the very next verse, 196, beginning “The ¿akti,”226 teaches the pranayama enhancement ritual, it may seem that the previous verse quoted above, beginning “Turn from the sun,” must similarly teach a meditative absorption enhancement ritual. However these two verses are not similar. The verse beginning “The sakti” describes the enhancement rituals of both withdrawal and pranayama, because it says in the Great Commentary, on verse 119 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, “Nada meditation will be explained,”227 and the later verse that this line refers to is the one beginning “The sakti.” Therefore there is no question that the verse begin­ning “The s'akti” describes the enhancement ritual for withdrawal and pranayama. The verse beginning “Turn from the sun” is clearly a verse that describes the accomplishing of various feats, such as seeing the treasures beneath the earth. Notes on Kalacakra says:Meditative absorption is just the stabilizing of withdrawal. Therefore, if withdrawal [402] has been accomplished and med­itative absorption meditation is performed, it is impossible not to achieve it. However, if withdrawal has not been attained, there is no meditative-absorption meditation. Therefore “and so forth” mainly refers to pranayama.228This is an assertion that meditative absorption does not require an enhance­ment ritual."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"nayáma: The Yoga of the W indsThe branch of wind accomplishmentThis has two main outlines:1.

In the Kalacakra, práná­yáma is taken to mean “wind stopping.” In the Guhyasamája, prána means “life” and áyáma means “to lengthen.” Therefore, in terms of the Kalacakra explanation, prána refers to the winds such as the downward wind and so forth, and áyáma has the meaning of “stopping.” These winds are stopped"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"476 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stagefrom flowing in the left and right channels and brought into the dhutl.Moreover this can be confirmed if the grammatical formation of this term is explained.229 Concerning the Dhatusiitra passage “Prana means life- holding,” the affix230 ac is added to the root. The consonant cis a marker231 and therefore is dropped. Concerning the Dhatusutra line “Yamu means stopping,” the affix ghan is added to the root. Before the letter ya of the word yamUy the prefix232 ang is added.

The s becomes a visarga, and the resulting term is prandydmah. O n this Naropa says;Concerning dydma, “yam u means stopping.” Here the letter a of the root stops all conception. This is aydmah, which means that the paths of the life air and downward air are stopped and brought into the central channel.235The time for the first meditationSome texts, thinking it to be the position of Je Tsongkhapa, assert:After the ten signs indicating that the winds have entered and dissolved within the central channel are complete and have been stabilized by meditative absorption, pranayama meditation is begun.236However, not only do the ten signs of the winds dissolving not arise dur­ing withdrawal and meditative absorption, it is not even the position of Je Tsongkhapa that such signs arise during pranayama. His Notes on Kalacakra states:The function of pranayama is to bring the winds into the cen­tral channel. However keeping the winds in the central channel is the function of retention. Therefore asserting that this task is"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"Pranayama: The Yoga o f the Winds 477performed by pranayama is incorrect, because if pranayama also accomplished the keeping of winds in the central channel, what would be the purpose of meditating on the branch of retention? Therefore the function of pranayama is to bring the winds into the central channel, and when the signs of winds having entered the central channel clearly and unmistakably arise, that func­tion is complete.237Therefore, if it is not the function of pranayama to even hold the winds in the central channel, how could it possibly dissolve them? Furthermore the previous text says:Then one meditates for an extended period, and for however long one sits, inhalation and exhalation of breath become pro­gressively shorter. When inhalation and exhalation have stopped, the winds abide completely. In the Guhyasamaja and other tantras, it is taught that vajra recitation brings about the abiding that is the severing of inhalation and exhalation as well as the dissolving, and that this in turn induces the innate bliss. It would be incorrect to say that vajra recitation is able to bring about such a result in the context of Guhyasamaja but is not able to here.However this passage is also refuted by the above quote from Notes on Kalacakra. How do those explanations from the Kalacakra tradition and those from the Guhyasamaja and others [404] differ on this topic? Notes on Kalacakra states:In general the highest yoga tantras talk of the winds entering the dhutl, dwelling in the dhutl, and dissolving in the dhutl. Here dissolving in the dhutl is referred to as “binding,” “mixing,” and “killing” the winds, whereas entering and abiding are spoken of as being separate branches. These are the branch of pranayama, which halts the flow of winds in the left and right channels and brings them into the dhutl, and the branch of retention, which keeps the winds in the dhutl.238This passage is saying that in the Guhyasamaja and other tantras, during the practices of body isolation and speech isolation, for example, penetrative"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"focusing on the points of the body will bring about the entering, abiding, and the dissolving of the winds in the dhuti during one continuous prac­tice. However here the branch of pranayama that brings the winds into the dhuti and the branch of retention that keeps them there are two separate methods and, moreover, are two separate branches within the six-branched yoga. The above passage also says that dissolving the winds in the dhuti, referred to here as “killing the winds,” occurs in the sixth branch, medi­tative concentration. Moreover the tantra, the Great Commentary, and other authoritative commentaries, which act as sources for the Notes on Kalacakra, do not even mention the abiding and dissolving of the winds in the central channel in any of the chapters up to the branch of pranayama.Our own position is that when the empty forms of withdrawal and med­itative absorption have been seen and stabilized, the branch of pranayama, as illustrated by the vase yoga, should begin. The Great Commentary, on verse 117 of the Gnosis chapter, says:Then, “when form is seen, each day the winds are to be halted” refers to the vase yoga.239Similarly Naropa, in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, teaches that pranayama meditation begins immediately after the comple­tion of meditative absorption:The lines on pranayama begin, “When images of form are seen.” When miragelike and dreamlike images of fully aspected form are seen, “meditate constantly on pranayama” and halt the life and downward winds with filling, vase, and expelling yogas.240These words refute the suggestion [405] that meditation on pranayama not preceded by the practices of withdrawal and meditative absorption will develop into the correct path.Branches of the meditationThis is under four outlines:1. Identifying the path of pranayama2. Divisions478 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Prânâyâma: The Yoga o f the Winds 4793. The meditation4. Enhancement ritualIdentifying the path of prânâyâmaThe appearance of the empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace within the center of the navel cakra, indivisible from the clear-light mind that has arisen from a very special entry of winds into the central channel brought on by the prânâyâma practices of vajra recitation and vase yoga, is the path of prânâyâma. This is taught by the Great Commentary on verse 120 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:“Purified by prânâyâma” means that when the yogi is “divorced from the paths of the sun and moon” and is constantly within the central channel, he will be purified by the prânâyâma and therefore will be “praised by the bodhisattvas.”241What is to be purified? The clear-light mind and the empty forms that are of the same nature as this mind are the phenomena to be purified. What is the purifier? It is prânâyâma practice, which induces the special entry of the winds into the central channel. This occurs when the sun and moon right and left channels are divorced from their flows of wind. “Therefore,” which means because of this purification, the yogi will be “praised by the bodhisattvas.” The empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace as the actual path of prânâyâma is taught by verse 122 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:The winds enter the center, divorced of objects, embracing VisVamâtâ.242That this phenomenon appears in the center of the navel cakra is taught by the Great Commentary on verse 120 of the Gnosis chapter: [406]“In the center of the two winds meeting” means in the center at the navel, where the life wind and downward wind meet. “The arising and engaging in the objects by object-engagers,” such as eyes and so forth, at the navel is a topic that has been discussed previously. The word “objects” is without a grammatical case."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"480 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stage“Apprehending the signs of smoke and so forth also” is by way of the avadhuti. The word “also” refers again to the navel.243How does this passage teach that the empty form appears in the center of the navel cakra? It does so like this. By meditating on the vase yoga of pranayama, the life-sustaining wind and the downwardly expelling wind meet at “at the navel,” meaning at the center of the navel cakra, where the arising and engaging of object-engagers such as eyes focusing on objects such as forms and so forth has been halted. Because of this, the empty- form signs of smoke and so forth, and especially the empty-form Kalacakra in mother-father embrace, are perceived. Where are they seen? “By way of the avadhutl” means inside the avadhutl. The word “also” means inside the dhuti in the center of the navel cakra. The way that the process of object-engagers such as eyes engaging in objects such as forms and so forth has been halted “is a topic that has been discussed previously” in the sec­tion on withdrawal.Therefore, in this section on pranayama also, wherever one focuses within the dhuti, there the winds will gather, and at that particular place an empty-form Kalacakra in mother-father embrace will definitely arise of its own accord, unconceived and unimputed by the mind. Therefore, dur­ing vajra recitation, when the empty form at the upper end of the dhuti enters and mixes with winds, there is no need for a separate visualization of it arriving at the navel. This is because the power of vase yoga will bring the life and downward winds to meet at the navel, and the union of these two winds is meditatively focused on inside the dhuti at the center of the navel. There empty forms will appear by their own volition, unimputed and unconceived by the mind, as taught by the above passage from the Great Commentary.

In the yogas of filling, vase, and arising, the sylla­ble om in the avadhutl brings about the entering, [409] the syllable hum brings about the halting, and the syllable dh creates the arising. The yogi meditates on these, whose natures are the moon, Rahu, and sun. This is pranayama.250How does this passage teach the focus of meditation? The first sentence shows the purpose or function of vajra recitation by stating that the winds are stopped from flowing in the left and right channels and are made to flow constantly in the central channel. How is this achieved? By filling the dhuti with wind, by vase yoga, and by arising yoga. How are these per­formed? The innate tone of the breath entering arises as the sound of om, the moon body-vajra syllable, and is visualized as entering the dhuti. The innate tone possessed by the breath abiding internally arises as the sound of hum , the Rahu mind-vajra syllable. It is visualized as abiding in the dhuti, which is the meaning of “vase” and “halting.” The innate tone of the breath being expelled arises as the sound of the syllable ah, whose nature is the sun speech vajra and is visualized as being expelled from the dhuti. This is “arising.” This is vajra recitation meditation.Naropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations cites this explanation from the Cakrasamvara Commentary:"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"486 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StagePrânâyâma means blocking the left and right paths of lalanâ and rasanâ, from which the winds constantly enter the avadhütï.In the avadhütï, by the yogas of filling, vase, and expelling, the syllable om brings about the entering, the syllable hüm brings about the halting, and the syllable âh creates the arising. The yogi accomplishes those whose natures are the moon, Râhu, and sun. This is the branch of prânâyâma.Some lamas focus on the winds coming and going from the right and left channels and so forth and then consider it unnecessary to visualize the winds entering and leaving the central channel. This method of vajra recita­tion is well refuted by the two passages above, which talk of “the syllable om in the avadhütï brings about the entering,” etc., and “In the avadhütï, by the yogas of filling, vase, and expelling,” etc.In the great vow251 section of the Gnosis chapter it says: [410]The definitive meaning is that at all times it is stabilized, and at all times during the vase yoga, the yogi meditates on the winds that enter and arise as being in the central channel.252Some lamas say that the “vase yoga” mentioned here refers only to the stage of abiding, the inhalation and exhalation having been stopped by the power of vajra recitation. This is incorrect, because it is not the position of Jé Tsongkhapa as explained previously. Moreover the Great Commentary talks of “winds entering the central pathway.”253 The Cakrasamvara Commentary talks of “the winds constantly entering the avadhütï.”254 These quotes point out that it is the constant flow of wind in and out of the central channel and not the stage of abiding that accomplishes the function of vajra recita­tion. So what does the above passage from the Gnosis chapter mean? That will be explained below.Three Bodhisattva Commentaries speaks of the entering wind being assigned to the syllable om, the abiding wind as assigned to hüm , and the wind being expelled as assigned to âh. In the Great Illusion Tantra the expelling is assigned to om and the abiding to hüm. The Guhyasamâja speaks of the entering wind as om, the abiding wind as âh, and the wind being expelled as hüm. Although there are differences in the way the sylla­bles are assigned, there are no differences insofar as they are all prânâyâma yogas that block the flow of wind in the right and left channels and bring"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Vajra Recitation 487it into the central channel. Therefore the innate tone of the breath enter­ing, abiding, and leaving is visualized as the appropriate sound of the three syllables. However the disagreement that arises on the tantra’s position when trying to establish which of the innate tones of the three breath stages are assigned to which sounds of the three syllables is confusing and should be examined.The Great Commentary says:Here there is no counting or saying of mantra, but together with the breath entering and leaving, concentrate on the letters of the mantra entering and leaving like a garland of flowers, in the nature of moon and sun, and in forward and reverse order. In this way, inwardly the yogi performs 108,000 recitations in five days.255 In five hundred days the yogi recites on 10.8 million breaths. Then the body becomes pure. Likewise the speech is purified and similarly the mind. [411] In this way the breath of fifteen hundred days remains unmoving, and the state of the vase wind is achieved. The yogis will develop the five kinds of clairvoyance, and with the perfect flow of winds in the left, right, and central channels, this is the vajra recitation and neutral recitation. This has been determined by the Buddha.Also:The definitive meaning is that at all times it is stabilized, and at all times during the vase yoga, the yogi meditates on the winds that enter and arise as being in the central channel.Using these passages as a basis, Buton Rinpoche256 explains that the letters of the great-vow daka and dakinl mantras intertwined with the seventy- two-line mantra are recited like a threaded flower garland upon the twelve major movements of wind,257 each of which is divided into five elemental mandalas to make sixty, to which is added the twelve flows of gnosis wind that occur between each of the twelve movements, to make seventy-two in total. These letters are recited in forward order for the entering and the abiding, which are in the nature of the moon and Rahu respectively, and in reverse order for the arising, which is in the nature of the sun. If this is done with no distraction and no interruption, then in one day 21,600 recitations are performed. In three blocks of five hundred days each, the"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"488 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stagebody, speech, and mind are purified, and one has reached the time for vase yoga. Therefore he posits the above passages as being the tantra and com­mentary description of the completion-stage vajra recitation of the branch of prânâyâma. Other texts that claim to be commentaries in keeping with the position of Jé Tsongkhapa and his disciples also explain this passage from the commentary as a description of the vajra recitation of prânâyâma from the six-branched yoga.I cannot see these claims as being correct, because in a preceding passage that comments on the tantra lines “the letters of wisdom and method,” which teach these mantra recitations applied to breaths like garlands of flowers, the Great Commentary says:The text speaks of reciting mantras in order to achieve worldly powers.258[412] Therefore the recitations of this passage are for the achievement of worldly powers. Also the line “together with the breath entering and leav­ing, concentrate on the letters of the mantra entering and leaving like a garland of flowers” describes a recitation in which the forms of the mantra syllables are strung together like a garland of flowers on the thread of the entering and leaving breath. Focusing on the winds and mantras as being separate in this way and focusing on the forms of the mantras is incom­patible with vajra recitation. Moreover, in the above description, focus is placed on the winds of the twelve major movements, which flow within the left and fight channels. However, in vajra recitation, the winds are to be visualized as entering and leaving the central channel. Furthermore the Great Commentary in that section says:The inseparable branch, the winds together with the mantras, are recited by the mind.259This explains that the mantra recitation of that passage is mental recita­tion. Moreover the Great Commentary refers to the mental recitation of the generation stage as vajra recitation. Therefore, although the passage talks of “vajra recitation and neutral recitation,” it must be the intention of the tantra merely to label mental recitation as vajra recitation.Others say that the eyes and the mind are focused within the dhütï between the eyebrows, and merely by single-pointed concentration a very"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Vajra Recitation 489special empty form will appear due to the power of previous familiarity. Self-pride is placed in this empty form, and when the winds are inhaled, the mind, which has become one with the empty form, merges with the winds so that winds, mind, and empty form are not regarded as separate entities but are merged in the mind. This is single-pointedly concentrated upon, and during its gradual descent from within the upper opening of the dhutl, its tone is visualized as the actual sound “om.” This process is asserted as being part of the profound focus of vajra recitation meditation. However, if examined, it can be seen to be faulty. When the eyes and the mind are focused in the dhutl between the eyebrows and a very special empty form appears just by the power of single-pointed concentration, the flow of winds in the right and left channels will typically have been severed and brought to the central channel. Specifically this is the time of the comple­tion of meditative absorption. [413] Therefore, as the line “cessation of aris­ing consciousness and objects of consciousness”260 explains, the object and object-engager connection, which refers to the six consciousnesses of sight and so forth engaging the six objects, form and so forth, has been cut because the winds, or mounts of those consciousnesses, have been brought into the central channel. Therefore, at that particular time, the conscious­ness of hearing and the bodily consciousness do not engage their objects of sound and bodily sensation. Therefore how would it be possible to visual­ize the gradual descent from within the upper opening of the dhutl as emit­ting the sound om>Furthermore, when beginning the practice of vajra recitation, even if the actual status of the winds is that they are still flowing in the left and right channels, one nevertheless practices by visualizing them as entering the central channel. According to the above assertion, however, the time for beginning the practice of vajra recitation is when a very special empty form appears due to the power of the winds having already entered the central channel. Therefore at that time you would have to say that the winds were already entering and leaving the central channel. How could that be cor­rect? Through this and other reasons a lot of damage can be done to this assertion.To summarize our own position on vajra recitation meditation: the eyes and body are positioned as previously explained, and at the beginning of the practice of vajra recitation, regardless of whether the winds are actually flowing in the right or left channels or the central channel, the incoming breath is visualized as descending within the central channel to arrive at the"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"490 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagecenter of the navel cakra. There it remains for however long the duration of one breath may be. When it arises, it does so again through the central channel. The innate tone261 of the breath entering is visualized as om, the innate tone of abiding as hum, and the innate tone of leaving or arising is visualized as ah. This process is to be single-pointedly concentrated upon.The actual way the mantras are applied to the winds is that the innate tones of the breaths resonate as die sounds of the three syllables as if they were actually being heard. The reason why it takes place in the central channel within the very center of the navel cakra is that although in the branches of withdrawal and meditative absorption the special empty form appears within the upper opening of the central channel, from the branch of pranayama onward it has to be an appearance in the central channel at the center of the navel cakra. [414] The reason why is stated by Khedrup Je in Illum inating Reality:The special empty-form mudra as an actual phenomenon is first developed on the branch of recollection. This is taught as an empty form arising from the winds entering, abiding, and dis­solving within the avadhutl at the center of the navel cakra. Therefore the special cause that induces the special innate gno­sis is first developed at the navel cakra. Because of this the navel cakra is spoken of as the innate deity form. This is a special assertion of my omniscient master.262An actual empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace that is not just an appearance within the mind of the yogi is first developed during the branch of recollection, and the place where it is developed is in the central channel at the center of the navel cakra. The foundation and immediate cause of this special empty form is the empty-form Kalacakra in mother- and-father embrace developed during the branches of pranayama and reten­tion, which arises unconceived and unimputed within the yogi’s mind. This too must arise in the central channel at the center of the navel cakra. For the arising of such an appearance, the winds must abide in the central channel at the navel cakra during retention and must enter the central channel at the same location during pranayama. Therefore vajra recitation is applied to the processes of entering, abiding, and arising at the navel, and it is in that location that vase yoga holds the winds together in union.What does it mean to say, “the navel cakra is spoken of as the innate"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Vajra Recitation 491deity form”? This is taught by the twenty-seventh verse of the Inner chap­ter, which says:At the secret, crown, and navel also, the innate form of the Buddha, without and with nature.263On this verse the Great Commentary says:Therefore, at the secret lotus, the crown lotus, and the navel lotus, the pure form, the supreme deity. Without nature, and unimputed, its nature is like form in a clairvoyant’s mirror.264To summarize: during the practices of the six-branched yoga, sometimes the winds are entering the central channel, sometimes the process of enter­ing is at its peak, sometimes the winds abide in the central channel, [415] and sometimes the winds are “killed” or dissolved in the central channel. By the power of these processes, the clear light, whose nature is the pri­mordial mind, appears in unification with its images at all stages within the meditations of the six yogas. These images are empty forms, especially the countless sambhogakaya forms, which appear like phenomena in a clair­voyant’s mirror. Although the final clear light cannot be actualized until the attainment of omniscience, nevertheless, when the winds are initially brought into the central channel by the power of meditation, a little of the clear-light mind is experienced. During the stages of peak entering, abid­ing, and dissolution, the clear-light mind becomes progressively clearer, and the empty forms also become clearer.At the stages of withdrawal and meditative absorption, the empty forms are seen with fleshly eye consciousness. From the completion of meditative absorption, when clairvoyance is gained, until the completion of pranayama, retention, and recollection, and for as long as there is no sep­aration from desire for the union of the two organs, the empty forms are seen with the clairvoyance of the celestial eye. From the completion of the branch of recollection, in which a mahamudra consort has been actually created and separation from desire for the karma and wisdom mudra con­sorts is attained, the empty forms are seen with the buddha eye. From the very first moment of attaining the unchanging bliss on the first of the twelve bodhisattva levels, the forms are seen with the eye of wisdom. When"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"492. Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stagethe perfect and complete enlightenment is attained, empty forms are seen with the eye of gnosis. Verse 232 of the Methods of Accomplishment chap­ter says:Objects of celestial sight are two,those of inferential and of direct cognition.W ith the application of direct cognition,manifold sambhogakaya forms arise, like stars in the sky.265On this the Great Commentary says:There is direct and inferential cognition. With the application of direct cognition, “manifold sambhogakaya forms arise, like stars in the sky,” meaning like a host of stars, the forms are seen with the fleshly eye and so forth, and the three worlds and the three times are like dreams and illusions. Here initially the beginner yogi without clairvoyance sees various forms with the fleshly eye.Then, with the attainment of clairvoyance, they are seen by the celestial eye. [416] With the attainment of separation from desire, they are seen by the buddha eye. W ith the attainment of the bodhisattva stages, they are seen by the eye of wisdom. With the attainment of full and perfect enlightened mind, they are seen by the gnosis eye, “freed from remainder.” In this way the fleshly eye of the tathagata and the other sights that make up the five eyes are for the seeing of emptiness. Other living beings are blind to the objects seen within the view of emptiness.266If this passage is analyzed, it can be understood that any part of the six- branched yoga is solely a time of meditative equipoise on the winds enter­ing, abiding, or dissolving in the central channel, within which empty forms will definitely arise. In the illusionlike postmeditation times when the winds flow in the right and left channels, the empty forms do not appear. For example, in Guhyasamaja thinking, it is only in the meditative equipoise of the winds entering, abiding, and dissolving in the central chan­nel that the clear light along with the appearances, increases, and attain­ments of the path will definitely occur, whereas these are not experienced in the postmeditation sessions.

Seeing the channels and the colors of the winds is the result of practice. However being able to see the cakras and then the colors of the moving winds, as well as being able to see many worlds, is like seeing visions in a dream, and although some may be genuine, they are unreliable. The Vajra Garland teaches that when the isolation of the body is complete, vajra recitation should be per­formed for six months, and that in the fourth month the colors of the cakras are seen. This is an actual sight of the cakras, and although this is a common experience of vajra recitation medi­tation, [417] the most important thing is that the unmistaken signs of the winds having entered the dhuti must arise.268"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":".se YogaThis has two main headings:1.

Focus and method o f meditationHolding the winds inside without letting them enter or leave can also be explained as vase yoga and is found in the lower tantras. Moreover it has been taught that vase yoga is found in the non-Buddhist Samkhya tradi­tion. Pandit Ksitigarbha260 said that it is difficult to differentiate the wind yogas of non-Buddhists and those of the mother tantras.270 Lamas of the past have maintained that they are differentiated on the basis of their view and by whether or not they encompass bodhicitta but not on the basis of"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"496 Part s: Gnosis: The Completion Stagebeing wind yogas. Although it may seem that the different vase yogas are not differentiated by their individual characteristics, there is actually a huge difference in the fundamental features of these yogas. Generally, in the Sâmkhya tradition, there is no bringing together of upper and lower winds, and specifically there is no inducing of the innate great bliss by uniting and holding the winds in the centers of the cakras as taught in the highest yoga tantras. Vase yoga in which the winds are merely kept inside without leaving or entering can be found in non-Buddhist traditions and in the lower tantras. Therefore a special vase yoga meditation is necessary here, and that will be explained. It is under two headings:1. How it is presented in the tantra and commentary [418]2. The actual focus and method of the meditationHow it is presented in the tantra and commentaryThe Great Commentary, on verse 117 of the Gnosis chapter, teaches the need for vase yoga and its duration:Then, “when form is seen each day, the winds are to be halted” refers to the vase yoga. “Until mandalas of light are seen to encir­cle the entire body”: these are within and emerging from the forms previously mentioned.271The way vase yoga is practiced is taught in verse 194, an “easy to under­stand” verse of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:Mouth too is closed, and from the two nostrilsall outer wind is drawn in by the power of prânâyâmaand joined with pure lightninglike downward wind.From familiarization with the yoga over time, moon and sun are as one in the center of fire.In the body thirst and hunger are destroyed, and freedom from death too is granted.272The mouth is closed, and the outer wind is drawn in through the two nos­trils by the power of the life-sustaining upper wind. This is joined with the downwardly expelling lower wind, whose color is yellow, like that of pure lightning, in the central channel at the center of the navel cakra. From the"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 497practice of this yoga over a long time, the winds that flow in the moon left channel and the sun right channel are as one in the “center of fire,” mean­ing inside the central channel at the center of the Kàlàgni, or navel cakra. The immediate benefits of completing the vase yoga are that thirst and hunger are destroyed and freedom from death is granted.Therefore do not think that these words from the tantra do not clearly teach that the uniting of the winds is to be meditated upon within the cen­tral channel. This verse definitely teaches that when familiarization with this practice has been fully developed, the life and downward winds of the left and right channels are as one inside the central channel, and for that to happen these two winds must be brought together in the central channel.Furthermore Notes on Kâlacakra quotes a verse from Later Guhyasamaja that says:Breath, the nature of the five wisdoms, the nature of the five elements, uprooted as a globe-shaped form, meditate at the tip of the nose.273Notes on Kalacakra goes on to explain how the commentary on this verse, as found in the Cakrasamvara Commentary, clearly teaches vase yoga. [419] Notes on Kalacakra first corrects the translation— “In some translations ‘globe-shaped form.’ is rendered ‘amassed form’”274— and then continues with the explanation. The way that the Cakrasamvara Commentary explains this verse from the tantra is as follows:The term “five jewels” refers to the phenomena of the five rasand mandalas, which are the five elements of earth and so forth. Breath in the nature of the five elements is of the nature of the five jewels, and is in the right nostril. Likewise the phenomena that are the five laland mandalas of the five buddhas are the five aggregates— consciousness and so forth. The winds blessed by these are in the left nostril. “Globe-shaped” in the line “up­rooted as a globe-shaped form” means the life winds of the left and right mandalas are as one in the avadhütï. The life winds are “uprooted as a globe-shaped form, meditate upon the tip of the nose.” The word “nose” here is used to mean the lotuses of the"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"498 Part $ : Gnosis: The Completion Stagenavel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown. Here, to meditate at the tip, as in the line ‘‘meditate at the tip of the nose,” refers to the center of the navel at the location of right and other lotus petals.275This passage needs to be explained a little. The term “five jewels” refers to the breath that possesses the nature of the five elements or mandalas of earth, water, fire, air, and space, and that flows through the right rasand channel and through the right nostril. The term “five buddhas” refers to the breath that possesses the nature of five aggregates of consciousness, and so forth, and that flows through the left lalana channel and through the left nostril. These winds become as one globe-shaped form or one “amassed form,” which is “uprooted” or “led” through the avadhuti. “Nose” in the line “meditate at the tip of the nose” is used here to mean the lotuses, or cakras, of the navel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown. The “tip” refers to the central dhutl of those cakras. The term “nose” refers to the cakras, but at the tips of which cakra is one to meditate? The line “meditate at the tip of the nose \"means to meditate within the dhutl at the center of “the loca­tion of the right and other lotus petals,” meaning the right and left chan­nel petals of the navel. [420] That this is the meaning of the above passage is confirmed by Nopes on Kalacakra:This is clearly explained in the Cakrasamvara Commentary, in which a verse from the Later Guhyasamdja is quoted:“Breath, the nature of five wisdoms, the nature of the five elements, uprooted as a globe-shaped form, meditate at the tip of the nose.”In some translations “globe-shaped form” is rendered “amassed form.” Therefore the five mandala winds, whose natures are the five wisdoms and which flow individually through both chan­nels, become as one amassed form, which is “uprooted” or “led” through the avadhuti. “Tip of the nose” refers to the cakras, and therefore “tip of the nose” here refers to examining, or medi­tating, in the center of the navel cakra.276"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 499Similarly Naropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations, when explaining the meaning of just this one verse, which begins “Breath, the nature of five wisdoms,” says very clearly:This talks of the third branch. The five wisdoms from the line “Breath, the nature of five wisdoms” are the five buddhas, Aksobhya and so forth, referring to the five aggregates of con­sciousness and so forth, which are phenomena of the lalana mandalas. Breath, which is of their nature, is in the left nostril.Here the term “five elements” refers to the element of earth and so forth, phenomena of the rasana mandalas. Breath, which is of their nature, is in the right nostril. “Globe-shaped,” from the line “uprooted as a globe-shaped form,” refers to the life winds of the right and left mandalas together as one in the avadhutl.That wind is “uprooted as a globe-shaped form,” and the “nose” of the phrase “tip of the nose” refers to the centers of the navel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown lotuses. Having uprooted the winds, “meditate at the tip of the nose” refers to the medita­tion, which is in the center of the navel but not on the left and right lotus petals.277The meaning of most of this passage is similar to that expressed by the Cakrasamvara Commentary passage. The meaning of the lines from “the nose of the phrase,” [421] up to “which is in the center of the navel but not on the left and right lotus petals” is that the first part, from “the nose” up to “crown lotuses,” identifies the nose of the phrase “tip of the nose.” The “winds,” or life-sustaining upper winds, that flow through the left and right channels are “uprooted,” or led, solely through the pathway of the dhuti and meditated upon in the dhuti in the center of the “tip of the nose,” or navel cakra. From where are the winds led? From the nostrils, down through the dhuti, to the center of the crown-channel lotus, through the forehead, throat, and heart lotuses and as far as the dhuti at the center of the lotus of the navel cakra. The winds are not led through the “left and right lotus petals” and left and right channels.This rough explanation of the scriptural description of the purpose of vase yoga focused on the dhuti leads to the second outline:"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"500 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageThe actual focus and method of the meditationThis is under four headings:1. The order of drawing the upper and lower winds2. The pathways from where winds are drawn3. Mental placement on the winds drawn and brought together4. Duration of meditationThe order of drawing the upper and lower winds Notes on Kalacakra says:Ordinarily, when life-sustaining wind leaves from the upper opening, downwardly expelling wind leaves from the lower opening. When life-sustaining wind enters, downwardly expelling wind enters and reaches as far as the navel. Therefore it is possible to bring them together and bind them simultane­ously.278However, in the Guhyasamaja Completion Stage,21* it says that the upper and lower winds are drawn one after the other. Whatever the case, here they are to be drawn one after the other. The place of meditation, posture, and position of eyes are arranged as they were in vajra recitation. When draw­ing in the winds, the upper, life-sustaining wind must be drawn in first if you do not have the instructions for preventing the emission of bodhicitta. If you draw in the lower, downwardly expelling wind first, there is a dan­ger of bodhicitta emission, which must be avoided. If you have the instruc­tion on the prevention of bodhicitta emission, it is taught that drawing in the lower wind first is acceptable.The pathways from where winds are drawnFor the upper, life-sustaining wind, the mouth is closed, [422] and with one of the yogas of “taking from above,” “taking from below,” or yogama, the wind is slowly drawn through both nostrils and pulled down the dhütï until it reaches the center of the navel cakra. There it is focused on and added to without allowing it to stray upward. After that the lower, down­wardly expelling wind is drawn up through the dhutl from the two lower"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 501orifices to the center of the navel cakra, where it is to be focused upon. Both winds are held and added to without being allowed to stray up or down.Mental placement on the winds drawn and brought togetherThe life-sustaining upper wind and downwardly expelling lower winds are drawn through the dhütï as far as the navel. This unites the two winds inside the dhütï at the center of the navel cakra, where the dhütï is con­stricted by the knots of the right and left channels. These united winds are then the focus of a single-pointed placement of mind. The purpose of focusing on the winds themselves in vase yoga is found in the quote begin­ning “The look of Vighnantaka,” which explains that prânâyâma is prac­ticed with the look of Vighnantaka. The definitive Vighnantaka, or amrtavarta, is said to be the winds. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:“The images of amrtavarta refers to the winds using provisional language.280The prânâyâma vase yoga taught here is performed after vajra recitation, and the measure of vajra recitation completion is that just by focusing on the vajra recitation objects of meditation, the winds are stopped from flow­ing in the left and right channels and move constantly within the central channel. Because of this, empty-form signs of the winds having entered the central channel will appear without fail and in the correct order. When vajra recitation has been mastered and the yogi begins to engage in the practice of vase yoga, a little vajra recitation is first performed to bring the winds into the central channel, after which the upper wind is slowly led down through the central channel. The reason for this is that the tantra states that external wind is drawn in and moves through the nostrils:Mouth too is closed, and from the two nostrilsall outer wind is drawn in by the power of prânâyâma.281If wind enters through the nostrils, it has to then move through the cen­tral channel and in order for the winds to move through the central chan­nel, the first moments of vase yoga must be preceded [423] by a vajra recitation that brings the winds to the central channel."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"502 Part y Gnosis: The Completion StageThe mind is single-pointedly placed upon the upper and lower winds brought together inside the dhutl at the center of the navel cakra. Wher­ever the mind and winds dwell within the dhutl at the navel, there an empty-form Kalacakra will appear by its own volition unconceived by the mind. Therefore any practice that involves drawing down mind and winds, indivisibly united, in order to merge them with this Kalacakra empty form makes no sense. From the branch of meditative absorption onward, the appearances of the primordial clear-light mind and its special empty forms are no longer separate subjects and objects and appear indivisibly as one, thereby enabling self-pride to be assigned to the special empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace. Similarly, in all instances from pranayama onward, wherever mind and winds are focused within the cen­tral channel, there mind and winds will enter, thereby enabling a natural, uncontrived self-pride to be assigned to each of the special empty forms that arise there. The special causes of this are the ability to place a natural uncon­trived self-pride in the main deity developed during generation-stage prac­tices and similar concentration practices developed in the branch of meditative absorption. The teachings here on vase yoga are for the special disciples of the tantra, those “jewellike persons” who have undertaken all preceding practices of the generation and completion stages. Beginners in vase yoga who have not accomplished these previous practices should learn vase yoga methods from the teachings of the gurus.Duration of meditationMeditation on the winds held together should continue until the head begins to hurt, until the yogi sees his body encircled by light, or until the heart starts to jump. If meditation continues after these signs appear, there is a danger of death. If one dies under these circumstances, what happens? If death occurs, the yogi should place concentration one-pointedly on the empty forms, and by doing so he will actualize a realm of great bliss. This is what will actually occur. However the previous advice is given to avoid gaining the bad reputation of being a yogi who meditates on the path and then dies. [424] Verse 121 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:Pranayama grants fruits of complete equalized bliss,desirable for as long as the head is.Beyond that it produces the undesirable, the fear of death,"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 503cause of definite destruction of aggregates.To leave through the opening at the crown without doubt joins one to a place of great bliss.W ithout aggregates, the yogi finds blissful peace, but he has no reputation in the world.282On this verse the Great Commentary says:When he sees the empty forms, the yogi performs prânâyâma “for as long as the head is,” which means until the head begins to hurt. This will grant the fruits of equalized bliss. “Beyond that” means that going beyond the bounds of a painful head will produce “the undesirable, the fear of death,” a cause of the loss of the aggregates. If, by the power of yoga, the prânâyâma moves through the opening at the crown, the yogi is joined “to a place of great bliss,” meaning to the empty forms. “Without doubt” means definitely.And further:“But he has no reputation in the world” means a reputation that “this yogi has died.”283Signs of accomplishment The Great Commentary says:“In the center of the two winds meeting” means in the center at the navel, where the life wind and downward wind meet. “The arising and engaging in the objects by object-engagers” such as eyes and so forth at the navel is a topic that has been discussed previously. The word “object” is a without a grammatical case. “Apprehending the signs of smoke and so forth, also” is by way of the avadhütï. The word “also” refers again to the navel.284This passage, as previously explained, teaches that the life and downward winds are merged within the dhütï at the center of the navel cakra. The winds that are the mounts of the six consciousnesses enter this union,"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"504 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stageresulting in the severing of the six types of objects, form and so forth, from their object-engaging consciousnesses. This in turn produces a definite and ordered sequence of signs, such as smoke and so forth, and particularly the appearance of many sambhogakaya forms in the aspect of Kalacakra mother-and-father embrace within a hair-sized black line to which self­pride is assigned. This appears clearly in the midst of this union of life and downward winds.Furthermore this union of life and downward winds ignites the candall fire at the navel. This melts the bodhicitta element, which then falls, [425] and without emerging from the tip of the jewel, induces the four joys of descent and the four joys of stable ascent, in which the bodhicitta increases to reach to the forehead cakra. This great bliss is applied to aspected and nonaspected emptiness. These meditations are the primary signs of accom­plishment, while seeing the colors of the channels and their winds are com­mon signs.How does the completion of vase yoga induce the four joys of descent? The Great Commentary says:Then, “when form is seen each day, the winds are to be halted” refers to the vase yoga. “Until mandalas of light are seen to encir­cle the entire body”: these are within and from the forms previ­ously mentioned.This passage teaches the activity and measure of completion of pranayama vase yoga. The text continues:Then, devoid of the inferior sensation of the union of the two organs, “in six months, the meditator who is a beginner in brah- macarya conduct, enters the path of the mind” or mind of empty form “of equalized bliss,” meaning unchanging bliss.285The passage teaches that the jewellike persons or primary disciples of this tantra accomplish vase yoga and then strive in the paths of retention and recollection. After six months, even if they are at the stage of a beginner, those of brahmacarya conduct, meaning those who have not experienced the loss of bodhicitta, will come to the path of the mind of equalized or unchanging bliss that is devoid of desire for the inferior sensation of the"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 505coupling of the two organs. This path of the mind is an attainment in which mind and the empty forms are indivisible. In short this passage is saying that if jewellike disciples who have completed vase yoga strive on the path for six months, they will achieve the branch of meditative concentration.The continuation of the above passage, from “Next, full and perfect enlightenment by single instances” up to “at the crown all winds are ended. This is the twelfth,”286 teaches how the instances of bliss increase to 21,600 and how these are responsible for “killing” the winds of karma at the six cakras, resulting in the attainment of the twelve levels.The continuation of the passage, from “Therefore, until the blazing of oda>m until “bliss will increase,” [426] teaches the development of the four joys in descent and ascent that occurs from the practice of vase yoga up to recollection.It is clear that the blazing of the candâlï fire melts the bodhicitta and induces the descent, but how is the ascent brought about? After “bliss will increase” the passage continues:“By the certainties of the gurus” means that from the previously taught halting of the winds comes an increase as far as the fore­head and that “this is no surprise.”This means that it should come as no surprise that from the prior practice of the prânâyâma halting of the winds comes the stable ascent, wherein the bodhicitta increases from the secret place to the forehead. The reason for this is that the ability to draw up the bodhicitta is dependent upon the winds being “halted” in the central channel.Prânâyâma enhancement ritualVerse 119 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter says:If by withdrawal and so forth,the wishes of the mantra practitioner are not met,perform nàda meditation by wrathful means,and they will be accomplished by blocking the dropin the vajra jewel within the lotus.288"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"5o6 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageOn this the Great Commentary says:Now wrathful yoga is taught. During withdrawal and so forth, when forms are seen but instances of the unchanging have not been generated, because the winds have not been bound, at that time meditate on the nada, which will be explained, and by wrathful means bring the winds to the central channel. The bodhicitta drops in the lotus of wisdom are halted within the vajra jewel and are unmoving. By this is accomplished an instance of the unchanging. This is the wrathful yoga.289This passage means that by the meditations of withdrawal, nondefinitive signs of smoke and so forth are seen, but the winds have not been bound in the central channel. Therefore an instance of the bliss that arises from the bodhicitta “unchanging,” which means not falling from the opening of the vajra jewel, has not been generated. [427] When this happens, meditate on the nada as it is explained in verse 196 of the “easy to understand” verses of the Method of Accomplishment chapter, beginning with the words “The ¿akti.” With this wrathful yoga the winds are brought to the central chan­nel, and when the yogi relies upon an activity mudra consort, the winds within the yogi’s vajra jewel, which is placed within the lotus of the wisdom consort, are halted by the force of being brought to the central channel. The bodhicitta does not move outside, and an instance of the unchanging or nonfalling bliss is created.Therefore, once the winds have been moved into the central channel by the power of meditation, the yogi possesses the certainty of being able to hold the bodhicitta from emission by the power of the winds, and it becomes possible to induce the innate bliss through the power of the winds even from the branch of withdrawal. Therefore the phrase “instance of the unchanging” mentioned in the passage above is used to describe the bliss that arises from the bodhicitta being held at the tip of the jewel and pre­vented from falling, but it is not the definitive unchanging bliss. This can be understood from the lines “accomplished by blocking the drop in the vajra jewel” in the above verse.The enhancement ritual can be dealt with under three headings:1. When to perform it2. The actual ritual3. The creation of bliss from binding the winds"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 507When to perform itIf the meditations of withdrawal and prânâyâma have produced many vis­ible empty forms but there are no signs of the winds having entered the cen­tral channel, this enhancement ritual is to be performed because its enactment will bring the winds into the central channel. Moreover this rit­ual is specifically designed to bring winds into the central channel, because the tantra teaches that if bliss is not developed due to the winds not being bound in the central channel, wrathful means are employed to bring that about. Therefore there are two occasions when this ritual is to be per­formed. One is when the meditations of withdrawal are unable to bring the winds into the central channel. The other is when the meditations of prânâyâma, as indicated by the words “and so forth,” are also unable to bring the winds to the central channel. If withdrawal has brought the winds into the central channel, it is impossible for the winds not to be brought into the central channel during prânâyâma. Therefore prânâyâma enhance­ment is necessary when the winds have not entered the central channel during withdrawal.If this wrathful yoga brings the winds into the central channel, [428] then isn’t it acceptable to perform it at the very outset of practice? If the yogas of withdrawal and prânâyâma are first performed gendy and over a long time but do not produce results, then this ritual is to be performed. However, if forceful methods are used from the beginning, not only will the yogi not be able to bring the winds to the central channel, but many obstructions will be created. Therefore such a practice is unsuitable at the outset. Practicing a meditation such as withdrawal over a long time makes the winds very pliant, and even if wrathful methods are employed at that time, no obstruction will be created.The actual ritualThis is taught by verse 196 in the “easy to understand” verses of the Meth­ods of Accomplishment chapter:The sakti from the center of the navel to another place travel a distance of twelve and a distance of “part,” they are halted at the navel, together with the pure lightninglike,"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"5o8 Part y.

The way this hüm is meditated on is as follows. Feet are placed in vajra position, arms in vajra-fist position are crossed across the heart, and the head is slightly bent. “Sakti” here means the life-sustaining wind. “Another place” in the line “From the center of the navel to another place” refers to the nostrils. From here to the outside, the earth-element wind travels a distance of twelve fingerwidths, the water-element wind a distance of thirteen, fire-element wind fourteen, air-element wind fifteen, and the space-element wind travels a distance of “part,”292 or sixteen, fingerwidths. These life-sustaining winds are inhaled violently, not through the mouth but through the nostrils, and descend through the central channel as far as the navel. The innate tone of the winds is visualized as the sound of hüm. At the same time, from either of the two lower orifices, the downwardly expelling wind, similar in color to pure lightning, is drawn up through the pathway of the central channel and is upright “in the form of a stick.” These two winds are “halted at the navel,” meaning held together at the navel. From the navel cakra to the crown cakra, these two winds “disap­pear” from the left and right channels [429] and penetrate instead the cen­ters of succeeding cakras, moving through the central channel. When they reach the opening of the crown cakra by “wrathful method,” meaning mov­ing by the force of the wind, and the skin on the outside of the head feels as if it is being pricked by needles, this is a sign that the winds have been brought into the central channel by these forceful means.That is the ritual for bringing the winds into the central channel. How­ever, if consciousness transference is to be performed at this point, the tantra continues:At that time the downward wind, by supreme wrathful method, is urged into the upward path, and if the two winds are blocked, they travel to the supreme city from the crown opening.293"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Vase Yoga 509“At that time,” meaning when wrathful methods have produced needlelike sensations, the downward wind is urged into the upper avadhuti path by “supreme wrathful method,” meaning by the power of even more forceful winds. This blocks the winds from flowing through the left and right chan­nels, and instead they travel to the supreme city of the dakinl from the central channel at the crown opening.The creation of bliss from the binding of windsGenerally, in most highest yoga tantras, development of clear-light mind and innate bliss is mainly taught in the completion stage. The Kalacakra Tantra and Three Bodhisattva Commentaries, which teach in accord with Kalacakra thinking, teach methods for the development of empty forms and great innate bliss once the winds have entered the dhutl. The devel­opment of empty forms is a limb of or method for the development of unchanging bliss. Therefore the Kalacakra Tantra teaches mainly unchang­ing bliss and, as a method for its attainment, the development of empty forms. That is the reason for categorizing Kalacakra as mother tantra. Therefore these empty forms cannot be just any appearance of empty forms but must be those brought about by the winds having entered the dhutl. So for the empty forms and the innate bliss of a definitive completion stage to occur, the winds must have entered the central channel.Therefore, if the winds are brought into the central channel by this wrathful method, [430] the bodhicitta element is held by the power of the wind and does not fall from the opening of the vajra jewel. From the achievement of that ability on the path of withdrawal until the attainment of the ability to induce the unchanging bliss by reliance upon a mahamudra consort, one engages in union with an activity mudra consort. The drops are held in the vajra jewel, and from the bliss of nonemission comes the development of the bliss of descent and ascent. The same is true for a wis­dom mudra consort.Valid cognitionThe cognition is a valid, nonconceptual, direct mental perception focused on the winds within the central channel."},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"5io Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage Purification divisionsThe Great Commentary, on verse 115 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:“Prânâyâma is the sword family”294 refers to the aggregate of men­tal formations.295 “In ten aspects” refers to the ten mandalas left and right combined as one.296The six phenomena of the mental formation aggregate group are to be purified into a state of nonobscuration.

The first three, place of meditation, posture, and eye positioning, are the same as in pranayama.Focus of the meditationMeditation is focused on the “sphere” of wind that is the combination of the life and downward winds. As it says in the Kalacakrapada Transmission:The focus is the wind of bliss.309The way mind is placed on this object is that with mind and wind rolled together as one, the mind is one-pointedly focused on the combined winds concentrated within the drops in the dhutl at the centers of the cakras. The Root Tantra states:Placing the vajra in the lotus, the winds enter the drops.310Also the Later Guhyasamaja says, “Breath, the nature of the five jewels” and so on. The meaning of this quote was explained by the Cakrasamvara Commentary in the section on vase yoga and also needs to be understood here, because the Cakrasamvara Commentary applies the meaning of these lines from the tantra to both pranayama and retention. The Cakrasamvara Commentary, after the explanation of these lines from the tantra, says:Like this, within these locations of the drops, the winds, in globe-shaped form, are halted. That is retention.311[434] This passage is saying that in the drops of body, speech, mind, and gnosis located inside the dhutl at the centers of the cakras, the winds are combined in a sphere or glo^e-shaped form and are halted from flowing through the left and right channels. Combined with these drops, the mind dwells one-pointedly upon the winds, and this is the way to meditate on the branch of retention.What is the procedure of the meditation?

Expelling the wind outside is done gently and without effort. Because of this, in the manner of earth dissolving into water, the focus of meditation is then held at the heart, in the same way it was held at the navel. In the manner of water dissolving into fire, the focus moves to the throat. In the manner of fire dissolving into air, it moves to the forehead. In the man­ner of air dissolving into space, it moves to the crown, and in the manner of space dissolving into gnosis, the meditation moves to the secret cakra. This can be explained in more detail. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:From blocking the left and right pathways, the winds constantlyflow within the central avadhütï.313As this quote indicates, the accomplishment of the practice of vajra recita­tion ensures that the winds enter and leave only from the central channel during the one-pointed meditation on vajra recitation. These winds travel from the navel to the outside when leaving and as far as the navel when entering. Therefore the yogi who has accomplished the practice of vajra recitation has mastered the ability, during the single-pointed session on vajra recitation, to move the winds between the navel and the nostrils314 solely by way of the central channel. The winds only move up and down through the dhütï at the centers of the cakras. Therefore, on the accom­plishment of vajra recitation, the channel knots at the cakras must have loosened, because if they had not, the winds would not flow up and down solely through the dhütï at the centers of the caleras.Therefore, when vajra recitation is mastered and before the commence­ment [435] of vase yoga, a little vajra recitation is performed to get the winds to enter the central channel. This is followed by the life and downward winds being drawn from above and below. This is not just imagined or visualized; the winds are actually drawn through the central channel to combine at the navel. This vase-yoga meditation is continued session after session to eventually produce the outer, inner, and secret signs. The candâlï fire at the navel blazes up to melt the bodhicitta and create the four joys of descent and stable ascent. After the completion of vase yoga, retention med­itation is performed. At this point the upper life wind and the lower down­ward wind have been drawn from above and below into the central channel and combined as one in the navel cakra. At this point these winds and chan­nels are actually seen. This spherelike amalgamation of life and downward"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"5i8 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stagewinds is combined with the drop that creates the waking state and that is located in the central channel at the center of the navel cakra. The mind is single-pointedly placed on this and held there determinedly, with the winds not being allowed to stray up or down. This is practiced repeatedly, and at first the combined winds will not naturally stay in place without effort. However the time will come when the two winds mixed with the drops will remain there naturally without effort. When that occurs, it is meditated upon and eventually stabilized. Then the meditation moves on to the heart cakra, as in the procedure explained above.By the power of meditation the winds enter the central channel during prânâyâma and abide there during retention. At all times during these med­itations, the clear-light mind is directly experienced, and various empty forms appear. In particular, wherever the mind and winds are held, there an empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace, indivisible from the clear-light mind, unimputed and unconceived, will appear of its own accord. This is a natural cause-and-effect process. In the section on vajra recitation it is not taught that the candàlï fire blazes due to the practice of vajra recitation. However it will blaze on the completion of vase yoga, caus­ing the bodhicitta to melt and to bring about the four joys of descent and ascent. Here, in the section on retention, it is taught that the four joys of descent and ascent are greater than those of vase yoga. [436] At these two times, when the four joys are generated, the clear-light mind becomes a mind of great bliss. This great-bliss mind is placed one-pointedly on the noninherent nature of the empty forms that arise simultaneously with this mind. Within this state the empty forms clearly appear, and they too are single-pointedly focused upon.Some say that when the upper wind is drawn in, the winds and mind are made indivisible from the empty forms and are then drawn to the location of the drop at the center of the cakras. However, when the upper wind is drawn inside, empty forms do not appear, so how could they be made indi­visible from the winds and mind?Experiences gained from meditation Süryas'rï Jñána says:“Selves, powers, and the jewel all cease; holding to this is retention.”"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Retention 519To explain this in greater detail, “Selves” refers to the objects of form and so forth. “Powers” refers to the eyes and so forth.Selves and powers cease and dissolve.

That is retention.315This means that the situation after the completion of retention is that the “selves,” or objects of form and so forth, and the sense powers of the eyes and so forth have ceased and dissolved. Then, after this dissolution, “the jewel, which is the basis for the objects and sense powers and refers to the jewel of the mind, ceases together with pranayama and disappears.” Here pranayama means “winds.” This means that the clear light arises as a vast emptiness. The master Buton says that if a definitive clear-light emptiness arises, it is not possible to be without fear, and that one should meditate well armed with instructions.316Furthermore, when the life and downward winds are combined at the navel, the candall fire blazes, and all food or drink taken becomes a fire offering to the candall fire. Its nourishment improves the body’s complex­ion. All waste in the body is burnt away by the candall fire, and excrement and urine are no longer passed. The body becomes light and of good odor and color. From this time onward one cannot be harmed by untimely death.

This quote is clearly referring to empty forms “in the space.” How are these forms described?

Therefore recollection represents the accomplishment of actual empty forms. By igniting the special candall fire at the navel, great bliss is generated. This mind of great bliss focuses on and meditates upon the empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and-father embrace that has appeared in the dhutl at the navel. By the power of this meditation, the appearance of this Kalacakra mother and father becomes purer and purer and transforms into an actual empty-form Kalacakra mother and father. The five light rays emerge from this deity form, pass through the pores of this coarse body, and radiate outside. Also countless actual deity forms emerge from this inner deity form in identical aspect and pervade the reaches of space. [444]The great bliss arising from the the special candall fire at the navel is pro­duced in three ways: by focusing the mind single-pointedly on the candali fire blazing at the completion of retention, by reliance on an activity mudra consort, and by reliance on a wisdom mudra consort. The three types of person develop the great bliss by relying on these three methods. The asser­tion that the three types of person will develop the great bliss by relying on an activity mudra consort, is taught in the “easy to understand” seventy- third verse of the Gnosis chapter:To increase this innate bliss of the conqueror, first rely upon an activity mudra consort; then create the sun form, with body, face, legs, crown, all limbs complete; in a flash of lightning resemblance, arises a definitive creator of unmoving bliss, all features complete.335The meaning of this is as follows. In the first five branches, from the attain­ment of the ability to hold the bodhicitta element and prevent it from falling by the power of the winds up to the ability to generate the supreme and unchanging bliss, one first relies upon an activity mudra consort in order to increase the innate bliss. After that, in recollection, a deity form is created endowed with the rays of the sun, with body, face, legs, crown,"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 529and so forth, all completed and in the aspect of Kalacakra in mother-and- father embrace. The consort of this union is the definitive mahamudra consort, the creator of the unmoving drop and unchanging bliss, created in the great bliss of the blazing candall fire resembling a “flash of light­ning.” She is an actually created consort with “all features complete.”The reason why all three types of person— sharp, middling, and dull— must rely upon the activity mudra consort in the first five branches is as fol­lows. In those five branches one practices on the path in order to prevent bodhicitta emission, to develop a nonchanging bliss336 and to attain simil­itude and definitive empty forms. For these attainments one relies, with skillful means, on an activity mudra consort, and having habituated to nonemission, [445] one must develop nonfalling bodhicitta and non­changing bliss as well as empty forms, which are the objective aspects of that bliss. The Great Commentary, in the Supreme and Unchanging Gnosis summary, says:By mudra consort yoga, instinctual emission is transformed into instinctual nonemission, like mercury and fire. This is spoken of by the Buddha in verse 224 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the king of tantras:337“Fire is enemy of quicksilver; without fire quicksilver is never bound.Unbound it will not create gold; no gold is of no use to man.Similarly, not in union with a consort, the yogi’s mind is forever unbound.Unbound, his body is not penetrated, a body not penetrated does not grant innate bliss.”338Therefore the meditation common to all three types of persons is under five headings:1.

The Guhyasamaja Tantra says:The yogi, striving in accomplishment, [446] meditates on the form of the deity,340These lines teach that at the time of the practice of recollection, which is the branch of accomplishment from among the four branches of approxi­mation and accomplishment, the yogi looks at and meditates upon the form of the deity.

At this time the empty form in this meditation is only an appearance and not an actuality. However, with prolonged meditation, that appearance is transformed in an actual empty-form Kalacakra mother-and-father deity. This moment represents the attainment of the actual path of recollection.Signs of accomplishmentAfter the completion of retention, the outer cause of the two mudrá con­sorts and the inner cause of focusing and meditating single-pointedly on the combined life and downward winds as indivisible from the drop within the dhütí at the navel cakra will produce signs that are mere appearances but in a more distinct form than previous signs. These range from those of smoke up to the empty-form Kalacakra mother and father. At those times the candáll fire at the navel blazes and the bodhicitta melts to induce the four joys of descent and stable ascent. These are the ordinary signs.The clear-light mind of that period in the nature of bliss focuses and meditates single-pointedly upon the appearance that is the empty-form Kalacakra mother and father. This causes the empty-form deity appear­ance to transform into an actual form of a Kalacakra mother-and-father deity, encircled by mandalas of stainless light. From this form [447] light rays of five colors emerge and emanate through the pores of the coarse physical body. Countless more forms in identical deity aspect emanate as actual phenomena and pervade the reaches of space. The bliss of descent and stable ascent is developed from reliance upon the three kinds of mudrá consorts and experienced from the time of the development of the actual- phenomena empty forms up to the attainment of unchanging bliss. This is the actual path of recollection and the primary signs of accomplishment. The references for this are the passages from the Cakrasamvara Commen­tary and so on, which were explained previously.How is the bliss of descent and stable ascent described?

Moving from the throat to the heart, it produces the supreme joy and from the heart to the navel, joy­less joy. Moving from the navel to the secret place and from there to the tip of the vajra jewel, it produces innate joy. Furthermore these four joys “are of the nature of variety, ripening, rubbing, and being without charac­teristics. \"After this line the text continues:In this way the sixteen parts are complete.

Here, during the time of nonchang­ing bliss, the innate bliss is that of a child, and yogis should know it as an immediate result.343[449] The meaning of this passage is as follows. The four joys are each divided into four to make sixteen, and “in this way the sixteen parts are complete.” The bodhicitta reaches the tip of the vajra jewel, where it remains, and “meditation produces bliss.” This is the nonchanging bliss of descent arising from the bodhicitta not falling from the opening of the vajra jewel and is produced in reliance upon an activity mudra consort. Such bliss is only an example presented to illustrate the definitive unchang­ing bliss.

Meditation for attaining the recollection deity form2. Meditation after attaining the recollection deity formMeditation for attaining the recollection deity formThe meditation place, meditation posture, and position of eyes are as explained in the above section on the common meditation. After the accomplishment of the branch of retention, the life and downward winds are combined at the navel, and so mental placement is primarily a single­pointed focus on the empty-form Kalacakra mother-and-father as just an appearance illumined by the light of the candali fire in the center of the navel cakra. Constant meditation on this form, together with enhance­ment by relying on the two types of mudra consorts, will ignite the special candali fire and generate innate bliss. Clear-light mind is developed into the nature of this bliss and placed one-pointedly into the empty-form Kalacakra mother-and-father deity that vividly appears before it. This is meditated on again and again, and as much as that is undertaken, the appearance of that deity form becomes progressively purer, finally developing into an actual empty form in the aspect of Kalacakra mother and father. This is the rec­ollection body. From that form countless bodies emanate to fill the three realms. These are also actual recollection bodies.Meditation after attaining the recollection deity formThe empty-form Kalacakras in the aspect of mother-and-father embrace, both that dwelling in the center of the navel cakra and those pervading the three realms, have become actual phenomena and definitive recollection forms. All these outer and inner Kalacakra mother-and-father forms are of the same mental continuum as the yogi and, therefore, by way of attraction to the consort in the form of Vi^vamata, these Kalacakra forms enter into"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 535union. Meditative equipoise is held single-pointedly on this union, and after repeated meditation, the yogi arrives at a point when the bodhicitta elements located within parts of the gross body gather at the forehead cakra and gradually travel to the vajra jewel, from which arises the sixteen joys.[451] As the white element arrives at the tip of the jewel, the red element arrives at the crown. These two do not move elsewhere and are firmly located in their respective places. From these drops an instance of the sta­ble supreme and unchanging bliss arises. This is an indication of the actual attainment of the branch of meditative concentration. Therefore the path from the first of the four or sixteen joys onward is established as being the path of recollection.It may be thought that the yogi of high intelligence, after the attain­ment of the recollection body, only needs to rely upon the mahamudra consort and has no need of the other two types of consort. On this point some say that after completing the branch of retention, the intelligent yogi has the ability to actually raise the recollection body from within the equipoise of the meditative concentration of retention without break or interruption to the session, and to induce the unchanging bliss at that time by entering in union with the empty-form Visvamata. Therefore they assert that recollection can be completed within the one continuous meditation session of the meditative concentration of retention, and that the unchang­ing bliss of the branch of meditative concentration can also be attained in that session. They also maintain that the yogi of high intelligence, while developing the recollection form, and even after it has been developed, does not rely upon activity and wisdom mudra consorts.This is not correct. After the completion of retention it is necessary to train in candall fire practice, to rely on activity and wisdom consorts, and to undertake many other practices in order to attain the recollection body. Therefore how would it be possible to complete recollection and attain med­itative concentration in one continuous session of retention meditation? The yogi of high intelligence, when developing recollection, relies upon an activity mudra consort as previously quoted in the Condensed Tantra:To increase this innate bliss of the conqueror,first rely upon an activity mudra consort.Therefore, after the completion of retention and during the development of recollection, an activity mudra consort is used.

W ith repeated meditation a definitive and actual empty-form Kalacakra mother-and- father form is achieved. [452] At that time a mahämudrä consort, the cre­ator of the bliss of the unmoving element, is created as an actual phenomenon. This is taught by the following lines, which have been explained previously:Then create the sun form, with body, face, legs, crown, all limbs complete; in a flash of lightning resemblance, arises a definitive creator of unmoving bliss, all features complete.344Furthermore the yogi of high intelligence relies upon the activity mudrä consort even after the attainment of the recollection form. The Great Com­mentary, on verse 121 of the Gnosis chapter, states:“Mind in closeness to the mudrä” means that from desire for the form, the bodhicitta melts, the yogi abides in supreme bliss, and the vajra is raised. This is the third, the face of the mind. If joy is not realized through the use of form, at that time “use the sound of the vajra in the lotus,” which means to move it slowly.If a girl is not found, then penetrate the lotus of the hand. This is to done to increase bliss and not to create a downfall.345Therefore, after the development of an actual recollection empty form, the yogi desires the empty-form Visvamätä. From this “the bodhicitta melts, the yogi abides in supreme bliss,” and because of the desire, “the vajra is raised.” This represents the third of the four vajras, which is Kälacakra’s “face of the mind,” or the mind vajra of recollection. If at this time the yogi has great desire for this empty form but joy is not generated through reliance on this empty form, “use the sound of the vajra in the lotus” of an activity mudrä consort, which means to generate the bliss by moving the vajra slowly in the lotus of an activity mudrä.If it is thought that this passage is not about the attainment of the definitive recollection body, then it should be known that this passage is in the section that comments on recollection as well as on the attainment"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 537of meditative concentration following the achievement of recollection, for the passage continues:This bliss of not expelling the seed destroys the fear of death and is the fourth face of the guru, or the gnosis vajra. This is a confirmation of the yoga meditations.[453] This passage talks of the gnosis vajra and, of the four vajras, the branch of meditative concentration has been taught as the gnosis vajra.It could be thought that this may indeed be a passage on the attainment and postattainment of recollection but that it is a teaching on the need for the yogi of low intelligence to rely upon an activity mudra consort. That would not be correct, because this is not a section in which the tantra and the commentary are teaching for any particular type of person but a section that explains the central tenets of the path. The central tenets of the path are taught for the primary intended disciples of the tantra, and the primary intended disciples of the tantra are those of high intelligence.Furthermore the Great Commentary, on verse 120 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:Concerning the line beginning “Moved toward the wisdom, the moon drop,” the movement refers to that of the moon drop, whose movement is generated by desire for the wisdom. The moon drop is the bodhicitta drop, which moves to the wisdom but remains in the vajra. O f that, the three nonchanging at the secret area, the navel, and the heart represent accomplishment.This is the third branch known as accomplishment. Practice accomplishment in this way.346Therefore, in this section on the branch of completion-stage accomplish­ment, the bodhicitta, which moves toward the activity mudra consort, stays in the vajra, thereby inducing the bliss of stable ascent that is the three non­changing or nondescending states at the secret area, navel, and heart. More­over, among the four branches of approximation and accomplishment, the branch of accomplishment is established as being recollection. These tantra and commentary passages also explain the central tenets of the path.Furthermore the Cakrasamvara Commentary, on the lines “W ith the mind placed inside, meditate upon the siddhi of desire,” says:"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"538 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageThe bodhicitta dwelling in the vajra jewel is spoken of as the “mind placed inside.” W ith the mind placed inside, this none­mitting bodhicitta associates with an activity mudrä or wisdom mudrä, and the characteristics of the three-realm world are med­itated on as forms of the Buddha. The three-realm world refers to the animate and inanimate characteristics of the desire, form, and formless realms, [454] and to functional and nonfunctional phenomena, all of which are possessed of supreme characteris­tics. They are wisdom gone beyond, possessed of supreme char­acteristics. On all these the yogi meditates.347Therefore, when one has the ability to hold the bodhicitta within the vajra jewel without emission, one associates with activity or wisdom mudrä con­sorts and induces the great bliss. Because of this great bliss the characteris­tics of the three-realm world appear as the forms of all buddhas in empty form. These are single-pointedly focused upon. A more detailed explana­tion of the “three-realm world” follows from the sentence beginning “The three-realm world refers to” up to the sentence “On all these the yogi med­itates.” The bliss induced by reliance upon activity and wisdom mudrä consorts is single-pointedly focused on empty forms. These empty forms are “wisdoms gone beyond” and are actual empty forms “possessed of supreme characteristics.” This is the meaning of the above passage, and therefore it can be established that all three kinds of yogis, of sharp, mid­dling, and dull intelligence, when on the first five branches, and especially on the branch of recollection, have to generate bliss by relying upon activ­ity and wisdom mudrä consorts.Furthermore the commentary on the line “meditate upon the siddhi of desire” runs:Here “desire” is great desire, is Vajrasattva, of great significance, supreme and unchanging.348Therefore “desire” is explained as being the supreme and unchanging bliss. The passage continues:“Siddhi” is the mahämudrä, the wisdom gone beyond, possessed of supreme characteristics.349"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 539“Siddhi” is explained as meaning empty form. This empty form is said to be of two kinds. The commentary continues:The meditation is of two kinds: earlier meditation on images and later meditation on images. The earlier meditation is the complete meditation on the signs of smoke and so'forth.350Therefore the earlier meditation refers to those during withdrawal and meditative absorption on images ranging from those of smoke and so forth up to the manifold sambhogakáya images. The commentary continues:Concerning the later meditation, when the image is seen, the lingam is placed in the bhaga, [455] and meditation is performed in order to increase the supreme and unchanging bliss.351The later meditation is asserted as being a recollection meditation, and when the image of an actual entity empty-form Kalacakra mother and father of the branch of recollection is seen, the lingam of the yogi is placed in the bhaga of an activity mudra consort, and the yogi meditates upon great bliss. The purpose of this meditation is to develop and increase the supreme and unchanging bliss of the branch of meditative concentration. The commentary continues:Again, to increase the great bliss, the activity mudrá consort and the wisdom mudra consort are abandoned for meditation on a mahámudrá consort. Here the abandoning of the activity mudrá consort and the wisdom mudra consort was spoken of by the Conqueror in the twelve-thousand-verse Supreme Orig­in a l Buddha:“Activity mudra is left behind, wisdom mudra is abandoned; with supreme unchanging yoga meditate upon the mahámudrá.”352By relying on activity and wisdom mudrá consorts, the yogi meditates on great bliss. “Again, to increase the great bliss,” or unchanging bliss, during the branch of meditative concentration, “the activity mudrá consort and the"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"540 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stagewisdom mudrá consort are abandoned for meditation on a mahámudrá consort.” This means inducing the unchanging bliss by meditating on desire for the mahámudrá consort. The authority for the assertion that in the meditations of the path of meditative concentration, which has the ability to develop the actual unchanging bliss, all meditations on activity and wisdom mudrás are abandoned is stated in the lines beginning “was spoken of by the Conqueror” up to “meditate upon the mahámudrá.” Therefore, with the only difference between them being their consort of primary reliance, yogis of sharp, middling, and low intelligence will rely upon activity and wisdom mudrá consorts, generating the four joys of descent and stable ascent and applying that bliss to emptiness until they are able to induce great unchanging bliss through the mahámudrá consort. [456] They develop the recollection body, which is an actual entity of an empty-form Kálacakra mother and father, and during the four joys, the mind of clear light develops into the entity of the bliss and takes on the aspect of desire for union between oneself as Kálacakra and his consort. Meditating in this way will eventually create the ability to generate great unchanging bliss through reliance on the empty-form mahámudrá Vis- vamátá. Therefore one must know when to rely on and when to abandon the activity and wisdom mudras, as taught in the tantra and commentaries.Recollection meditation for yogis of middling and low intelligenceThe meditations for developing the recollection body and the meditations following its development are basically the same as those of the yogi of high intelligence. The difference is that the yogi of middling intelligence relies mainly on the wisdom mudrá consort for inducing the bliss of descent and stable ascent that arises from igniting the candáll fire, whereas the yogi of low intelligence relies mainly on the activity mudrá consort.All three types of yogis, when meditating for the achievement of the rec­ollection body upon the completion of retention, will rely upon their own primary methods for creating great bliss, which will generate the great bliss of descent and stable ascent. The clear-light mind develops into the entity of great bliss, focusing and meditating single-pointedly again and again on the empty-form Kálacakra mother and father in whose aspect the yogi has appeared, unimputed and unconceived in the dhütí at the navel cakra. Finally that similitude empty form in its aspect of Kálacakra in mother-and-"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 541father embrace becomes an actual empty-form Kalacakra in mother-and- father embrace.In some instruction texts it is written that the candäli fire blazes, induces bliss, and from within the state of bliss and emptiness, one meditates to impel353 the arising of the recollection body.354 This seems to be applying here to the process found in the Guhyasamäja and other tantras, wherein one impels the arising of an illusory body from within either the state of bliss and emptiness or the state of clear light. [457] However these two are not similar. The explanation from the Guhyasamäja and other tantras is that within bliss and emptiness, or within the clear-light mind applied to emptiness, the illusory body develops from the subde wind that acts as a mount for the clear-light mind. However the empty-form body taught here is an empty form whose appearance first arose during withdrawal and med­itative absorption, was then prepared by the paths of pränäyäma, reten­tion, and so on, and whose attainment is accomplished by the gradual purification process of that empty-form body.In the explanations on the divisions of recollection, the explanation that those of sharp intelligence enter into union with as many mahämudrä con­sorts as there are atoms in M ount Meru, that those of a middling intelli­gence enter into union with as many wisdom mudrä consorts as there are goddesses in the mandala, and that those of low intelligence enter into union with activity mudras, are ways of practicing the path of recollection after the recollection body has been attained. On the topic of union with a mahämudrä consort, one instruction manual that claims to follow Butön Rinpoch^ and Rinpoch^ divides recollection up into three divisions and then says:355Then the empty forms that pervade space transform into the ten saktis and so forth. Also mahämudrä consorts as many as there are atoms in Mount Meru transform, enter into union, and create unchanging bliss as before.This is all that is written on the subject, and Butön Rinpoch^ himself does not elucidate on union with a mahämudrä consort. So this should be examined a little. How is union with a mahämudrä consort achieved? Does the yogi achieve it with his gross body, or does he enter into union as the father of the empty-form father-and-mother aspect? It cannot be the former because the mother in the aspect of empty-form Visvamätä is in the"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"form of an unobscured and unobstructed rainbow body, and entering into such a union with one’s coarse body would not be possible. Therefore the latter is correct. [458] The yogi in the form of Kalacakra mother and father has emanated to pervade the three realms. The mother mahámudrá con­sorts of that union numbering as many as the number of atoms in Mount Meru and the yogi in the aspect of the Kálacakra father of that union also numbering as many forms as there are atoms in Mount Meru, enter into union. This is the meaning of the assertion that those of sharp intelligence enter into union with as many mahámudrá consorts as there are atoms in Mount Meru.The way that the bliss of the melting elements is generated from this union is that the yogi focuses upon himself as empty-form Kálacakra moth­ers and fathers in union, and by dwelling single-pointedly in this desire, the four or sixteen descending joys are generated from the crown of the gross body down to the forehead, then to the throat and so on, and finally to the tip of the vajra jewel. Therefore, during recollection, the yogi of high intel­ligence practices repeatedly the method for developing bliss by reliance upon the mahámudrá conson and enhances the practice by relying on the other two types of mudrá consorts. The Great Commentary, in the section explaining that the mind vajra refers to recollection and the gnosis vajra refers to meditative concentration, says:Desiring the form, the bodhicitta melts, he abides in supremebliss, and the vajra is raised.356Therefore, in the practice of mind-vajra recollection, the primary intended disciples of this tantra desire the form of the mahámudrá consort, and the vajra of the yogi is raised. This brings about the melting of the bodhicitta, and the yogi dwells in the bliss that arises from the melting. If such a dis­ciple does not generate the four joys of the melted bodhicitta by desiring the form of the mahámudrá consort, “use the sound of the vajra in the lotus” of an activity mudrá consort, which means generating bliss by mov­ing the vajra slowly in the lotus of an activity mudrá. These and other lines, which have already been explained, clarify this point. Also the primary intended disciples of this tantra are yogis of high intelligence.Those of middling and low intelligence rely mainly on wisdom and activity mudrá consorts, respectively, from which they develop the four joys of descent and stable ascent and apply the bliss to emptiness. The yogi542 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stage"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 543arises as the empty-form mother and father and meditates repeatedly on the desire for the mahamudra mother. [459]Whether they have achieved the recollection body or not, the three kinds of practitioners at all levels of recollection practice rely on the candali fire as well as on wisdom and activity mudra consorts to induce great bliss, which is then applied to emptiness. The meditations on that bliss-and- emptiness gnosis ripen the mindstream and are similar-type causes for the development of the 21,600 instances of meditative concentration unchang­ing bliss. Moreover the empty-form mahamudra consort is a special cause of an unchanging bliss not found in the hidden tantra traditions. Therefore great significance should be attached to the achievement of empty form.Relying on the two mudra consortsThis has three headings:1. Wisdom mudra consort2. Activity mudra consort3. The explanation from the tantra of the four mudra consorts Wisdom mudra consortWith the generation stage already accomplished, and especially with the attainment of accomplishment of form and wind accomplishment,357 clear images can be created by thought alone. Therefore, with oneself clearly visualized as Kalacakra mother and father, on a moon disk at the forehead of both father and mother there is a white om, on a sun disk at the throat a red ah, on a Rahu disk at the heart a black hum, on a Kalagni disk at the navel a yellow hoh, on a gnosis mandala at the secret area a blue svd, and on a space mandala at the crown a green ha. From one’s secret area, which is in a nonapprehended state, arises a hum , which transforms into a blue five-pointed vajra. At its center is the syllable ah which turns into an eight- petal lotus. From the mother’s secret area, which is in a nonapprehended state, the syllable ah appears and transforms into a red eight-petal lotus. In its center is the syllable hum, which transforms into a vajra.W ith this visualization the yogi single-pointedly meditates on entering into union. This meditation brings about the melting of the bodhicitta element, which descends from the forehead to the tip of the jewel and is held there without being emitted. This generates the innate bliss of the"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"544 ^art S: Gnosis: The Completion Stagefour joys of descent, followed by the four joys of stable ascent, involving the upward return from the tip of the vajra jewel to the crown. [460] The clear- light mind develops into the nature of this great bliss and meditates single- pointedly on the empty forms, actual or facsimile, that simultaneously appear, as well as on the emptiness that is the noninherent nature of these empty forms. If this is practiced during the period in which an actual phe­nomenon empty-form mahamudra consort has yet to be achieved, the yogi alternates between his own inner meditative concentration and the mudra consort meditation. These provide mutual enhancement until an actual phenomenon empty-form mahamudra consort is attained. The great Naropa says:“Meditate” refers to meditation on the wisdom mudra consort.The aggregates, spheres, and sources are purified by being in deity aspect. The mandalas are clearly visualized, and the yoga of constant movement causes the fire of gnosis to blaze. The letter hum is burnt, and the moon descends from the forehead to the throat, heart, navel, vajra, and center of lotus.

In this meditative con­centration, union is entered into and endures until the approach of the glorious mahamudra consort.358Just as this is applied to a wisdom mudra consort, it can also be applied to meditations on an activity mudra consort and on the candall fire.Activity mudra consortThe correct kind of activity mudra consort to be relied upon is described in the tantras. The root Hevajra Tantra says:When discovered,she will have wide open eyes,adorned with beauty and youth,camphor and sihla,359well trained by bodhicitta.360On this the Vajragarbha Commentary says:"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 545This teaches the characteristics of a mudra consort. Her eyes are quite large, with the red and white well separated. Her waist is like a vajra. She is one, age twelve or sixteen, whose blood is flowing and who delights in bodhicitta. Similarly that mudra consort is to be trained.361[461] This teaches the characteristics of a mudra consort and the necessity of training. On the method of training, the tantra continues:Beginning from the ten virtues, teach her the dharma well; a mind in deity form, similarly, a well-pledged mind.362Beginning from the practices of the ten virtues, she is trained in the com­mon path. Then, as the line, “teach her the dharma well” indicates, she is given initiation and transformed into a suitable receptacle for tantra. She is taught the meaning of tantra and given vows and pledges according to her level of understanding. She is trained in the deity yoga of having a “mind in deity form,” becomes wise in the arts of desire, and has a conviction on the view of emptiness. Using the rituals taught in the tantras, the yogi should rely on such a mudra consort with these and other skills. If she is not trained in this way, very serious faults will occur. The tantra continues:An untrained girl in Hevajra yoga weakens the pledges, and one will be ruined.Train her, therefore, by teaching dharma.363Knowing these faults, do not enter into erroneous liaison with any female not trained as a mudra consort, using the power of the winds or various instructions to ensure the drop is not lost as a reason.The way to rely upon a mudra consort according to the rituals in the tantra is taught in the Root Tantra, quoted in verse no of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the Great Commentary:A qualified consort aged sixteen, adorned with youth and beauty; first teach her well,"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"546 Part y.

If that empty form is the definitive and actual empty form, the clear-light mind focuses upon the se x u al union of oneself established in the form of Kalacakra mother and father, and desire for the mother is cre­ated. Furthermore the lines “The three realms in their entirety are meditated on as forms of buddhas” indicate that one also meditates on emanating empty-form buddhas filling the entirety of the three realms.Regarding one’s lifestyle while relying upon an activity mudra consort, the Vajragarbha Commentary says:Having discovered such a girl, dwell in distant places, well prepared with food and drink, with songs, cymbals, dance, her body adorned with ornaments, flowers, and perfumes.Live well in this good place [463] and emanate the perfect gnosis.365From the same text it says:W ith one’s powers summon mudra consorts from the gods, asura, humans, kimnara, and yaksa, and examine them well.366These lines teach that goddesses and so forth should be summoned with special powers and assessed for their suitability to be activity mudra con­sorts. A consort should be chosen from among those who are suitable.The explanation from the tantra of the four mudra consorts In verse 74 of the Gnosis chapter of the Condensed Tantra it says:"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"548 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageW ith these four mudrá consorts giving fruits of unchanging bliss, in towns, in isolation, cemeteries, unclean, and clean places.367This line mentions four mudrá consorts. These are activity mudrá con­sorts, wisdom mudrá consorts, mahámudrá consorts, and samaya consorts. On the activity mudrá consort, Náropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations says:The activity mudrá has breasts and hair, a cause for bliss in the realm of desire. The activities are those of cumbanda, embrac­ing, touching the secret area, moving the vajra, and so on. Illus­trated by these activities, the mudrá is she who creates reliability. Reliability here refers to changing bliss.368Therefore the nature of an activity mudrá consort is a girl who has breasts and hair and a body formed from a collection of atoms. The activities that establish her as an activity mudrá consort include cumbanda, or kissing, embracing the yogi, touching the secret area, and moving the vajra. By these activities she is an illustration of reliability.”369 This is the meaning of mudra, and she is known, therefore, as an activity mudrá consort. What does reliability mean here? It refers to the mudra s own ability to grant “changing bliss,” or the bliss of emission, which is created or illustrated by the mudrá.The wisdom mudrá consort is explained in the same commentary from the line “The wisdom mudrá consort is completely imputed by one’s mind, goddesses such as Visvamátá” [464] up to the line “Concerning reliability, here she shows the moving bliss.”370 Wisdom mudrá consorts are mentally imputed objects of meditation in the forms of goddesses such as Visvamátá. Reliability here means that in terms of her own ability, this mudrá consort is able to move the bodhicitta from place to place within the body during meditative union.On the mahámudrá consort the same commentary says:Because she is great (maha) and is a mudrá, she is known as mahamudra. Moreover “great” here means that being possessed of supreme characteristics, she is not insignificant. Because she is sealed by the bodhicitta vajra, she is a mudrá. “Reliability” here means being divorced from phenomena conceived by the"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Recollection 549mind and preceded by the signs of smoke and so forth. This will be understood by the yogi in the clarity of his mind, like prognostic images in a clairvoyant’s mirror. The resultant mahamudra is characterized by m udam , the gnosis of supreme and unchanging bliss. When the yogi is filled with rati, the mudra, by the yoga of immobility, will grant this totally and at all times. Her greatness also is of great abandonment and great insight. Great abandonment is an abandonment of all obscura­tions together with their propensities.371This passage teaches the mahamudra consort. It needs a little explanation. The sentence, “Because she is great and is a mudra, she is known as m ahamudra explains the term mahamudra. The next sentence teaches the meaning of “great,” which is that the empty-form consort, “being pos­sessed of supreme characteristics, she is not insignificant” and has emanated to pervade the entirety of the three realms. These forms are each in the aspect of mother and father in embrace. To illustrate that “mahamudra” refers to the mother, the female gender is used.Moreover the mother deity of the empty-form Kalacakra mother-and- father embrace that has emanated to pervade the three realms can be con­firmed as a “mudra” because “bodhicitta vajra” here refers to the great unchanging bliss, which is created by this mother, and by not going beyond that, she is therefore “sealed by the bodhicitta vajra.” Because of this “she is a mudra.”In this empty-form Kalacakra of mother-and-father embrace, of great significance, [465] possessed of supreme characteristics, and completely pervading the three realms, what does “reliability” refer to? It is that the yogi’s mind is divorced from phenomena conceived by the conceptualizing mind. The yogi, following his experience of the ten signs of smoke and so forth, will understand and experience this like prognostic images in a mir­ror in the great clarity of his clear-light mind.Moreover, because this empty-form mahamudra consort produces the resultant mahamudra consort, she is known as a mudra. What is the result­ant mahamudra consort? “The resultant mahamudra consort is character­ized by m udam, the gnosis of supreme and unchanging bliss.” How does the mahamudra consort grant this bliss? She grants it “totally” or perfectly “and at all times” through this yoga.

[466]Valid cognitionButon Rinpoche says the cognition here is a direct yogic valid cognition.373 However direct yogic valid cognition is a term usually applied to a direct understanding of no-self. It makes no sense for the cognition here to be the direct perception of the coarse no-self of persons. Moreover, to perceive direcdy the subde no-self emptiness, one must be an arya being, whereas here the yogi who has only completed the yoga of recollection is still an ordinary being. Our own position is that the empty forms appear directly and clearly, and that the cognition is a nondeceiving, direct mental con­sciousness.Purification divisionsThe Great Commentary on verse 115 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter states:“Recollection of candali fire is Amitabha” refers to the recogni­tion aggregate.

Just as there are ten occasions for the experience of worldly desire, likewise, because of the candall fire in the central channel, there are the ten aspects of smoke and so forth in the meditations on inner and outer images.ResultsThere are immediate and final results. The immediate results are that one sees oneself as the deity, limitless light radiates from one’s pores, filling the realms of space, and one’s body is bathed in a halo of light. The Great Com­mentary, on verse 119 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:“Recollection is excellently pure.” Recollection, as spoken of here, refers to a mind embracing the forms and divorced from all con­ception. Therefore, when they become pure, at that time there are “mandalas of pure light.” The word “also” refers to the five rays of light radiating and traveling through the pores. “From the gnosis form” means from the empty forms.375The final results are that the six phenomena of the recognition-aggregate group become freed of obscuration to become the six enlightened phe­nomena, Amitabha and so forth.

Once the yogi has the ability to induce unchanging bliss because of familiarity with desire for the mahamudra con­sort, the meditations of meditative concentration should begin. The Great Commentary, on verse 113 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, says:Next is great accomplishment. When there is union with wis­dom, when the unmoving bliss is to be created, this is definitely the time of great accomplishment. “From the subtle yogas” teaches that great accomplishment is achieved definitively from the fluid well joined onto the “woman of excellent mind” channel.378“When there is union with wisdom,” or mudrâ consort, and when the unchanging bliss is to be created in reliance on the drops not moving to other places, [468] this is definitely the time to meditate on the great accomplishment— the branch of meditative concentration. W hat is the nature of this great accomplishment? Subtle yoga practice is taught at two levels— the provisional generation-stage practice and the definitive com- pletion-stage practice. In the definitive practice the red and white fluid ele­ments are “well joined onto,” or inside, the “woman of excellent mind,” or central channel, and do not move to other places.

As the previously quoted passage from the Great Commentary says:“In the nature of wisdom and method” means that conscious­ness and the object of consciousness are mixed as one, [469] and the power that is the unchanging bliss is a meditative concen­tration upon gnosis form.379In the Later Guhyasamdja Tantra it says:W ith wisdom and method in union, all phenomena are gathered.By the yoga of amassing,the image is meditated on in the center.An instance of gnosis complete is called meditative concentration.380Naropa in his Commentary on a Short Teaching on Initiations says of this verse:The lines beginning “W ith wisdom” speak of the sixth branch. “With wisdom and method in union” refers to the stages of sim­ilar- to-cause and so forth, which rise in the space of the lotuses.By the power of the unchanging bliss, consciousness and object of consciousness are mixed as one.

A more detailed explanation of this is found in the lines beginning “An instance.” The gnosis is nondual in terms of the two truths, and when an instance of this is complete or perceived, it is known by the name of the branch of meditative concentration.381This passage needs a little explanation. Concerning the line “W ith wisdom and method in union,” the Root Tantra says, “The stages of similar-to- cause travel upward.” Therefore, by the stages of similar-to-cause and so forth,382 the bodhicitta element rises up from the tip of the vajra jewel to the crown in the dhutl space of the cakras from lotus to lotus. At these cakras they do not change or move to other places and therefore produce unchanging bliss. By the power of this unchanging bliss, the emptiness form, endowed with every supreme aspect as an object of consciousness, and unchanging-bliss consciousness merge to become one entity. This acts as an opponent force to destroy portions of the obscurations, and at such uncontaminated times all phenomena, as illustrated by the inanimate envi­ronment and the animate living beings in it, are gathered together as illu­mined empty forms. This is the meaning of the term gathered.The meaning of the line “By the yoga of amassing” is that the “clear light solely in emptiness form, in its nature of the nonfalling,” or unchang­ing supreme bliss, consumes and transforms all the aggregates, elements, and sources into nonobscured phenomena. For example, “like the taste of forms when all elements— iron and so forth— are made into a form of one taste,” [470] referring to the process in which elements are consumed by mercury and transformed into gold.The meaning of the line beginning “In the center of the clear light” is that because of the above reasons, one should meditate upon the image, or empty form, “whose nature is a conventional truth,” in the center of, or indivisible from, the clear light that is of “one taste with the supreme non­falling bliss,” or unchanging bliss. The lines beginning “The gnosis is non­dual” refer to the two truths. These are: the ultimate truth, which here refers to the unchanging bliss that perceives emptiness and is an example of a consciousness being given the name of its object; and the conventional truth, which is the empty forms. These become nondual, and when “an instance of this is complete or perceived, it is known by the name of the branch of meditative concentration.”"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 557DivisionsThis has two headings:1.

This division is taught in verse 117 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter of the Condensed Tantra:As these are divided by being of low intelligence and so forth, there are three different and main methods of practice.Three consorts and three times by three paths, karma and conception become the supreme.383The Great Commentary on this verse says:“As these are divided by being of low intelligence and so forth, there are three different and main methods of practice” of the Kalacakra. “Three consorts and three times by three paths” refers to the path of the falling bodhicitta during the times of those of low intelligence, the path of moving bodhicitta during the times of those of middling intelligence, and the path of the nonmoving bodhicitta during the times of those of high intel­ligence. [471] Among these, the activity mudra consort is the giver of the bliss of falling, the wisdom mudra consort is the giver of the bliss of movement, and the mahamudra consort is the giver of the nonmoving bliss. In this way the Buddha taught the meditations of the three mudra consorts in the six branches. Therefore the yogi should meditate on the six yogas.384"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"558 Part $ : Gnosis: The Completion StageThe divisions of meditative concentration are taught in this passage. How are they taught? The words “In this way” refer to the preceding explanation of the words of the tantra. The line “the Buddha taught the meditations of the three mudrá consorts in the six branches” refers to all six branches. The three types of reliance-upon the three mudrá consorts, therefore, must be applied in the branch of meditative concentration too. The words of the tantra and corresponding commentary passage require some explanation. As these six branches are divided into meditators “of low intelligence and so forth,” meaning those of middling and high intelligence also, “there are three different and main methods of practice of the Kálacakra” in this branch of meditative concentration. “Three times” refers to the three occa­sions of practice for those of low, middling, and high intelligence, who rely on activity, wisdom, and mahámudrá consorts respectively. The reason for this reliance is that “by three paths,” practitioners develop the unchanging bliss of the branch of meditative concentration. “Those of low intelligence” must rely upon a mudrá consort who grants the “path of falling bodhicitta” in order to induce the unchanging bliss. “Those of middling intelligence” rely upon a mudrá consort who grants “the path of moving bodhicitta” as a way of inducing the unchanging bliss. “Those of high intelligence” rely solely upon a mudrá consort who grants “the path of the nonmoving bod­hicitta” in order to induce the unchanging bliss. Therefore, among these three consorts, “the activity mudrá consort is the giver of the bliss of falling” bodhicitta, “the wisdom mudrá consort is the giver of the bliss of move­ment” of bodhicitta to other places in the body, [472] and “the mahámudrá consort is the giver of the nonmoving,” or unchanging “bliss.”The descriptions of the activity and wisdom mudrá consorts as consorts who grant falling and moving bliss is made on the basis of these mudrá con­sorts’ own abilities. During practices such as the branch of meditative con­centration, one can induce bliss by relying upon an activity mudrá consort, but the bodhicitta is withheld from emission.That these tantra and commentary passages refer to the branch of med­itative concentration can be understood by the lines “the path of the non­moving bodhicitta during the times of those of high intelligence” and “the mahámudrá consort is the giver of the nonmoving bliss.” This is because the granting of unchanging bliss by a mahámudrá consort can only occur on the branch of meditative concentration.Furthermore A Short Teaching on Initiations states:"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 559By union with an activity mudra, visualization of a wisdom mudrá, becoming one with mahámudrá consort, increase the unchanging bliss.385Division by natureThis has two headings:1.

These can be divided into twelve levels. The tip of the vajra jewel to the secret area is divided into two parts. The first part filled with bodhicitta, unchanging and unmoving, produces 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss. This constitutes the first level. [473] Likewise the second part filled with unchanging and unmoving bodhicitta also produces 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss. This is the second level. Similarly the area up to the navel cakra filled with unmoving bodhicitta will produce 3,600 instances of unchanging bliss. The first 1,800 is the third level and the second 1,800 is the fourth. 3,600 instances of unchanging bliss are produced by the bodhicitta filling the area up to the"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"560 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion Stageheart cakra. The first 1,800 belong to the fifth level and the second to the sixth level. 3,600 instances of unchanging bliss are produced from the bodhi­citta filling the area up to the throat cakra. The first 1,800 belong to the sev­enth level and the second to the eighth. 3,600 instances of unchanging bliss are produced by the bodhicitta filling the area up to the forehead cakra. The first 1,800 belong to the ninth level and the second to the tenth level. 3,600 instances of unchanging bliss are produced from the bodhicitta, unmoving and unchanging, that fills the area up to the crown cakra. The first 1,800 belong to the eleventh level and the second to the twelfth level.An explanation of the progressionOne drop within the central channel at the very tip of the vajra jewel, stay­ing in one place and not moving elsewhere, produces the first instance of unchanging bliss. That drop consumes and destroys one of the 21,600 larger portions that the material body is divided into. This first instance of unchanging bliss “kills” or eliminates one breath of the 21,600 breaths that flow in one day. In a similar manner, one instance of unchanging bliss is produced from each of the 21,600 drops. Each drop consumes one part of the material body, and each instance of bliss destroys one breath or wind. The Great Commentary on verse 117 of the Gnosis chapter says:Next, full and perfect enlightenment by single instances. In the line “The instance at the end and beginning of desire and non­desire,” the word “desire” refers to the bright side of the month, and its “end” refers to the sixteenth. [474] “Nondesire” refers to the dark side of the month, and its “beginning” means not hav­ing entered the dark side and is the time of full and perfect enlightenment. “Also the instances are the number of breaths” means that they increase to 21,600. From the tip of the secret vajra jewel, the instances are multiplied to 3,600, and that num­ber of winds are killed. Moving to the lotus of the secret area, two levels have been reached. Similarly, at the navel, heart, throat, and forehead, four, six, eight, and ten are reached. At the crown all winds are ended. This is the twelfth.387To explain this passage a little, “Full and perfect enlightenment by single instances” refers to instances of unchanging bliss. How is this attained? In"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 561the outer world the waxing period or bright side of the moon is divided into fifteen sections, and although in reality there is no sixteenth after these fif­teen, a sixteenth is mentally created at the point of entry into the first divi­sion of the dark side. Therefore “at the end” of the bright side is the sixteenth part. Likewise, internally from the large toe of the left foot to the crown, the increase in the white part of the drops is divided into sixteen, and the last of these “refers to the sixteenth.” On the path, the bodhicitta descends from the crown to the tip of the vajra jewel to create the sixteen joys, at the end of which the first instance of unchanging bliss is formed and increases until its last increase, at the end of which full and perfect bud- dhahood is attained. This is “full and perfect enlightenment by single instances.” How these instances increase is taught by the lines beginning “Also, the instances.” This has been explained previously.Although these instances of supreme and unchanging bliss arise from their special cause, which is the empty-form mahámudrá consort in the aspect of Viévamátá, each of the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss is indivisible from oneself as an empty-form Kálacakra in mother-and-father aspect. [475] This is the significance of the nonworldly fourth initiation. The authority for this assertion can be known from a verse from A Short Teaching on In itia tio n s beginning “From desire for the mahámudrá,\"388 which was quoted in the explanation of the fourth initiation from the Ini­tiation chapter, and the detailed explanations given there should be recalled.An examination of areas ofdoubtThis is under two headings:1.

The perfect seeing that is the nonseeing of these worlds is the attainment of the twelfth level of perfect enlight­enment. This is not attained by the absence of “changing” desire. It is by the instances of unchanging bliss arising from desire for wisdom that these tathagata levels are achieved. Accomplishing 1,800 nonmoving instances is to attain the first level, and by these numbers the twelve levels are finally attained.By 21,600 unchanging instances, the twelve levels are reached and the links of dependent origination are negated.389An examination of the areas of doubt regarding this textThis has two oudines:1.

Other scholars also assert that the first set of 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss is the level of practice by belief and that the second set is the first bodhisattva level, great joy. Similarly others maintain that the first level begins with the last moment of the first set of 1,800.It is incorrect to posit the first of the twelve levels in this tradition as being the level of practice by belief. If the first level with its initial set of 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss is equated with the level of practice by belief, then the tenth set of 1,800 would have to correspond to the ninth level, excellent m in d If that were the case, “glorious Vajrapani, the mighty one of the tenth level,” would have to be on the ninth level, because the Great Commentary states, as will be quoted, that of the 21,600 karmic winds of Vajrapani, 3,600 remain undestroyed [477] and that he has not reached the eleventh level of this tradition.Suryas'ri in his Filled w ith Good Qualities says:By the process of attaining two levels at each of the cakras, one becomes the mighty one of the twelve levels. In this way, by"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"564 Part 3: Gnosis: The Completion Stagenegating 3,600 in-and-out breaths at the secret cakra, the two levels of great jo y and p u rity are attained. By negating the same at the navel cakra, the two levels of light and blazing light are attained. Similarly, at the heart lotus, the levels of hard to over­come and manifest are attained.396Therefore the above assertions contradict the fact that the first ten of the twelve levels of the Kalacakra tradition correspond to the ten levels of great joy and so forth.In a work called Opening the Secrets o f the Three Tantras it says:When an arhat has exhausted his bodily formation he inhabits a mental body. This body is similar to a bardo body and to a dream body. However it is not an actual bardo body nor is it an actual dream body. Nevertheless, if he enters the Mahayana, he enters it with this mental body. Prior to entering the Mahayana he increases his powers of clairvoyance and so forth. By doing so he moves through the eleven lower levels and only then enters the Mahayana. Are there differences in the qualities of these lev­els? The Great Commentary says, “Counting begins from the perfect seeing, that is the nonseeing of the world realms”397 Therefore with the attainment of the first level comes the per­fect seeing of one ten-direction world realm. W ith the attain­ment of the second comes two.398In the Great Commentary the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss are spo­ken of as the twelve levels,399 and in the above passage the qualities of these twelve levels are assigned to the qualities of a Hinayana arhat entering the Mahayana with a mental body. This appears to be a very distorted expla­nation. These passages from the Great Commentary are passages at the very heart of the path of the branch of meditative concentration, [478] which is explained by condensing the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss into twelve levels. Such a core path is for the intended disciples of the Kalacakra who enter the path of mantra from its beginning. How could it be for those of the Hinayana who enter the Mahayana! Furthermore, for those of the Hinayana to enter the Mahayana at the branch of meditative concentration would be like a calf becoming an old bull without the intervening process of growing up."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 565Moreover it seems that this scholar thinks the following. When the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss have been achieved and the winds of the twelve lagnd™ have been negated, then will the gnosis body be gained and not before. Moreover this gnosis body is attained when the first of the Per­fection Vehicle levels is attained. In his work Opening the Secrets o f the Three Tantras, he says:B right Lam p says, “In the Lahkavatdrasutra it says, ‘Having attained the level of great joy, he will go to Sukhavati.’”401 There­fore, when explaining the meaning of the master Nagarjunas attainment of the level of great joy, the assertion that he gained the form of Vajradhara endowed with every supreme aspect is made on the basis of that union or gnosis body being labeled as buddha.If this were the case, it would have to follow that the arya Vajrapani, the mighty one of the tenth level, would not have previously attained even the first level of great joy, because it is clearly stated in the Great Commentary that the movements of 3,600 karmic winds, or two lagna, of Vajrapani have not been negated. The second summary from the Realms chapter of the Great Commentary says:The master of the great yaksa dwells in the Place of Corpses402 like the “master of the beasts of the forests.” Internally “corpse” refers to the cessation of 21,600 in-and-out breaths less 3,600.“He dwells here, on the level of the cloud of dharma,” means that by dwelling there, he dwells in the Place of Corpses.403Furthermore, if the completion of the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss explained as being the attainment of the states of Vajrasattva and Vajrad­hara [479] is equated with the attainment of a gnosis body realized on the first level, then consider these passages from the Great Commentary:The final signs are those of the Buddha and of Vajradhara. This is the twelfth level attained by 21,600 instances of supreme and unchanging bliss. This attainment is the actual attainment of the great mahamudra.404"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"566 Part y Gnosis: The Completion Stage Also:In order to teach living beings worldly and nonworldly dharma, the enlightened conqueror, the Buddha, already the mighty one of the twelve levels, wise, master of the great illusion, of the great magical and optical illusion, was born in Lumbini of the Sakya family405If the above assertion were correct, the twelve levels mentioned in these passages would have to be levels attained prior to the attainment of the first level of the Perfection Vehicle tradition. In that case the description “wise, master of the great illusion” and so on would have to be explained as not referring to an actual enlightened being. This is beyond words. There is a lot more to say on this subject, but that is enough for now.A statement of our own understandingAs the omniscient Buton has said, the first level in the Kalacakra tradition corresponds to the first arya level, great joy, and the ninth level corresponds to the ninth arya level, excellent mind. In the Perfection Vehicle tradition the tenth level, the cloud of dharma, is divided into the mere, the special, and the uninterrupted paths. In the Kalacakra tradition the tenth level is the mere tenth, the eleventh is the special path, and the twelfth is the unin­terrupted path. The end of the twelfth, after instance 21,600 of unchang­ing bliss, is established as the level of all light, or the eleventh-level406 state of Vajradhara.The qualities gained from these levels are taught in the Great Commen­tary beginning from “From the attainment of the first level comes the per­fect seeing that is ultimately the nonseeing of the world realms of the ten directions” up to “From the attainment of the tenth level comes the per­fect seeing of 512 world realms of the ten directions.”407 The qualities men­tioned here are far fewer than those mentioned in the M adhyamakavatara, and they especially seem to contradict the verse from the M adhyam a- kavatara that runs:The qualities here on the tenth [480] are far beyond the abilities of speech; not within the realms of speech,"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 567Buddha fields gained as many in number as the number of atoms.408You might say that the qualities of the levels taught in the M adhyam a- kâvatâra come from the Sutra o f the Ten Levels, so how can the levels as they are taught in the Kalacakra tradition be a valid description of the ten lev­els of the ârya? Well, what if you were to say that the qualities of the levels taught in the M adhyam akâvatâra are wrong because they contradict those of the Kalacakra? I think that just as praising the Buddha by talking of his features and signs of enlightenment is to speak of only a part of Buddha’s qualities, so the qualities of the levels as taught in the Great Commentary are but a fraction of his qualities, but scholars should examine this.How bliss meditates upon emptinessThis has two outlines:1. Examining doubts over the nature of the emptiness to be meditated upon2. A brief explanation of how bliss meditates upon emptinessSome say that the emptiness to be meditated on in the glorious Kalacakra refers solely to the emptiness endowed with every supreme aspect, because emptiness as mere negation of the object of refutation as taught in the Per­fection Vehicle is explained as having no essence. This, they say, is confirmed by A Short Teaching on O ur Assertions Concerning the View, which says:The emptiness of examining the aggregates is without essence like the plantain tree.Emptiness endowed with supreme characteristics is not like that.409In reply to this assertion it has been said:“The emptiness of examining the aggregates is without essence like the plantain tree.” The meaning of these lines is that when exam­ining the aggregates with analysis and nothing is found, it is “without essence” to conclude that nothing therefore exists at all and to fall to a view of nihilism. Synonymous with that is a quote"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"568 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stagefrom the Supreme and Unchanging summary in the Gnosis chap­ter: [481] “The emptiness that comes from examining phenomena that are a collection of subde atoms is an emptiness far from a nonexistence emptiness.”410 Therefore you should be ashamed to deprecate the emptiness that is the nature of all phenomena.411However the verses of A Short Teaching on Assertions Concerning the View can be understood in the following way:The emptiness of examining the aggregates is without essence like the plantain tree.Emptiness endowed with supreme characteristics is not like that.Emptiness seen as phenomena, without birth, without cessation:Meditation upon that emptiness is not investigation of the aggregates.All phenomena are empty,said by the Buddha to be without essence.For practitioners to see emptiness, he taught this method.All phenomena of compassionare said by the Buddha to be without essence.For practitioners to see compassion, he taught this method.Pacification that is without beginning or ending, the fundamental nature412 of phenomena and nonphenomena extinct,the indivisibility of emptiness and compassion, this is taught to be bodhicitta.413If these verses are explained in detail, the context will be more easily under­stood. The emptiness taught as an object of meditation in A Short Teach­ing on Assertions Concerning the View, which supplements the Kalacakra, is"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 569of two types: nonaspected emptiness and aspected emptiness. The first type is an emptiness in which the aggregates and so forth are investigated by an analytical mind and, like the plantain tree, their essence is not to be found. Aspected emptiness or empty-form “emptiness endowed with supreme characteristics is not like that.” It is not an emptiness that is the mere refu­tation of the object to be refuted by analysis. So what is it? It refers to forms of “emptiness seen as phenomena” of the three realms, characterized by being devoid of the nature of birth or cessation like images in a prognostic mirror. Meditation upon that emptiness is not like the meditation in which the aggregates and so forth are investigated by an analytical mind. [482] Therefore when all phenomena, the aggregates and so forth, are inves­tigated with an analytical mind, the result is an emptiness of not finding a single atom. Therefore all phenomena are said by the Buddha to be with­out essence. He taught this as a method for practitioners of this path to see aspected and nonaspected emptiness. Similarly, when all phenomena of compassion, common or exclusive, are investigated by analysis, not a sin­gle atom is found. Therefore the Buddha said that they were without essence like the plantain tree. Nevertheless, for practitioners of this path, he taught this as a method to see the common compassion and exclusive com­passion, or unchanging bliss.In this way, the lack of any inherent beginning or ending is “pacifica­tion.” Phenomena and nonphenomena extinct since beginningless time is “the fundamental nature.” Aspected and nonaspected emptiness and com­passion, or unchanging bliss, are indivisible. This is taught to be bodhicitta.If these verses are explained all together, the meaning of the verse begin­ning “The emptiness of examining the aggregates” is still as explained above. Similarly the meaning of the line from the Supreme and Unchang­ing summary in the Gnosis chapter that runs “The emptiness that comes from examining phenomena that are a collection of subtle atoms is an emptiness far from a nonexistence emptiness” must also accord with how I have explained the verse beginning “The emptiness of examining the aggregates.” This is because this line is quoted by Anupamaraksita in his S ix Yogas and explained by Suryasrl in his commentary to this text.414So as not to fall into the systems of Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, and Yogacara, “The emptiness that comes from examining phe­nomena that are a collection of subtle atoms.”"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"570 Part s: Gnosis: The Completion StageAfter this introduction he continues:So as not to enter the systems of the hedonist Carvaka, so as to cast far away the nihilist, “an emptiness far from nonexistence.”Therefore the verse beginning “The emptiness of examining the aggregates” teaches both aspected and nonaspected emptiness as ultimate meditations of this path. [483] The lack of essence mentioned in the lines “is without essence like the plantain tree” and “All phenomena of compassion, said by the Buddha to be without essence” is explained in the Bodhicarydvatdra:For example, the plantain trunk, when cut up, is nothing.Likewise, when investigated, the self too is not genuine.415A sutra also says:Just as someone might split the unripe trunk of the plantain tree to seek its essence only to find no essence within or with­out, so should you know all phenomena.416This lack of essence can be compared to the lack of essence of a plantain tree. Therefore do not misconstrue the meaning of this term.Furthermore those who say that the emptiness ascertained by a practi­tioner of the Madhyamaka in the Perfection Vehicle is not the emptiness that is the ultimate object of meditation for the great bliss of highest yoga tantra, because there is an even higher emptiness, are not correct. Investi­gation o f the Views o f Ourselves a n d Others summary from the Inner chap­ter of the Great Commentary states:It is taught that first the views of the outsiders are refuted. Then the views of the first three of our tenets are refuted. Finally the unchanging great bliss meditates upon the emptiness ascertained by the Madhyamika.Just how is this taught?417 In the same summary it says:Similarly the tantra says:"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 571“Space, cessation, uncompounded phenomena, these three are permanent.All that is compounded is impermanent.Self is empty, there is no doer.Perception born from the senses, without taking on the aspect, directly perceives the collection of atoms.These are the assertions of the Vaibhasika from the ocean of Kashmiri texts.”418This is a presentation of Vaibhasika tenets. The tantra continues:Objects creating consciousness with aspect do not appear to sense organs.Space is like the barren woman’s son, cessation is like space, compositional factors have no form, the three times are not concomitant, there is no form that does not obstruct, this is understood by the Sautrantika.419Having presented the Sautrantika tenets the tantra continues:There is no holder of parts, and subtle atoms do not exist; like experiences in a dream, they appear as nonobjects; ultimate consciousness exists, freed from subject and object.These are proclaimed for crossing the ocean [484] of the Yogacara doctrine.420After these presentations the exclusive assertions of each of these tenets is refuted.

This section begins:Therefore, analytically searching for a consciousness with a sin­gle or manifold nature, it is not found, and so the asserters of consciousness are weakened.425The Great Commentary continues with a refutation of the phenomena assert­ers,426 who claim that creation, duration, and destruction exist by their own natures, and then proceeds to an ascertainment of the subde emptiness that is the Madhyamaka view. This passage runs from “Now the faults of momen­tary birth and destruction are taught” up to “It could not arise from a com­bination because they would be mutually exclusive and therefore not one.”427 The commentary continues:“Therefore the Madhyamika say that the wise do not assert consciousness to exist ultimately.Not possessing a nature that is one or many it is like a lotus in the sky.Not existing, not nonexisting,not possessing the natures of these two,freed from the four extremes.This is known by the Madhyamika.”Those who weaken the extremes are not weakened.

They are of the tenet of the buddhas.428To explain this a little: the verses ending with the line “This is known by the Màdhyamika” [485] refer to the way Mâdhyamikas ascertain emptiness. Those persons of the Madhyamaka school who “weaken the two extremes” of existence and nonexistence do not fall from reality. How do Mâdhyamikas not fall from reality? “They propound nondual emptiness and compassion.” This is the main topic, and is explained by the following lines. “Here,” at this juncture, when the main themes of Kalacakra are being practiced, the yoga of “compassion” or unchanging bliss, which is “nonap­prehending and nonconceptual,” one-pointedly dwells in the emptiness ascertained by the Màdhyamika, in union with and indivisible from “empti­ness supreme in all aspects. With the Madhyamaka view of reality, it will enter the three times for the sake of gaining “the knowledge of the three times.” If a meaningful understanding of this passage is not reached, the foundation for the ultimate great-bliss meditation will not be there. The discerning mind, therefore, needs to exercise great subtlety on this point.Furthermore it says in the Supreme and Unchanging summary:Because of this, by the force of the instincts of the four kinds of Buddhists, the Buddha taught the meditation of the imperma­nence of self to those who propound the self. Those who pro­pound phenomena are taught the totality meditations on earth, and so forth.429 Those who propound consciousness are taught the meditative concentration upon mere perception. The Màdhyamika are taught meditations upon the dreamlike, unchanging, and nondual gnosis. In this way there is the non­self of persons and the nonself of phenomena. There is the nirvana with remainder of the Vaibhasika, Sautrantika, and Yogàcâra. There is the nirvana without remainder, the non­abiding, of the Màdhyamika in which all cause and effect has ceased.430This passage too states that the Madhyamaka view is the ultimate view of the meditations of highest mantra."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"574 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion StageA brief explanation of how bliss meditates upon emptiness[486] The unchanging bliss consciousness meditates on the very emptiness ascertained by the Madhyamika through the lines “Not existing, not nonex­isting,” and so forth. This is the position of the tantra and commentary as has just been explained. As to how that is accomplished, initially the mind is trained in the common path. The K ing o f M editative Concentration Sutra states:If phenomena are analyzed for nonself, and if that analysis is meditated upon, this becomes the cause for the fruit of nirvana; other causes will bring no such peace.431As this quote indicates, the subtle emptiness as taught by the protector Nagarjuna and the glorious Candraklrti is initially ascertained by study and thought. That is meditatively analyzed again and again to produce an actual or similitude special insight432 in which deep ascertainment433 of this subtle emptiness is experienced. Eventually, when the innate bliss is gen­erated, that emptiness is recalled by this bliss, and placement meditation is practiced on that emptiness in a meditative state where no objects are to be analyzed or conceived.Such a bliss-and-emptiness gnosis is the supreme of all special insights. The reason for using meditative analysis434 when one first meditates to develop special insight is that it increases the strength of the ascertaining mind’s hold on emptiness. When great bliss is nonanalytically and single- pointedly placed on emptiness, the hold of the ascertaining mind also becomes stronger. The reason for this is that for as long as one remains in the meditative concentration on bliss and emptiness, the moving winds of the conceptual minds are stilled and not present, which means that the mode of apprehension will not weaken. Moreover, because great bliss is the best consciousness for meditating upon emptiness, that apprehension will actually become stronger. Furthermore bliss that takes emptiness as its object brings about the descent and stable ascent of the bodhicitta element in the central channel and prevents it from moving elsewhere. This creates a special bliss within the body, which becomes the causal condition for the primordial or clear-light mind to develop into the entity of great bliss.

This is the meaning of the previously quoted lines from the seventy-third verse of the Gnosis chapter:In a flash of lightning resemblance arises a definitive creator of unmoving bliss, all features complete.435Also verse 113 says:A mere apparition of the mind, born from the mind, like a reflection in a mirror,upon whom all bodhisattvas and buddhas have relied, upon whom the mighty yogis rely.436Using these verses as an authority, the Supreme and Unchanging summary from the Great Commentary says:Until the finality of enlightenment the yogi meditates on this mahamudra, this mere appearance within the mind.437Furthermore, in verse 198 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter, it says:Mudra, like an illusion,in mind and space like an image in a mirror;myriad beams radiate forth like pure lightning,"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"5j 6 Part 5: Gnosis: The Completion Stageilluminating the three worlds,the external inseparable from the body,a nonobject, a mere appearance,the mind dwelling in space,embracing the nature of mind,the forms of many beingsare solely this mudrá.438And further on:For the attainment of perfect enlightenment,the she-creator of supreme buddha,supreme, unsullied mudrá consort, unchanging in aspect,all-pervading, dispelling darkness vast as space,the path traveled by yogis, forever unchanging,the radiance of gnosisdestroying the impurities of existence,meditate upon this wisdom of Kálacakra.439[488] The mahámudrá consort is as described here and in many otherverses. She is to be recognized as the form of Visvamátá embraced byKálacakra. The Supreme and Unchanging summary from the Great Com­mentary says:The mahámudrá consort is of the noninherent nature of all phe­nomena, endowed with every feature supreme, the Prajñápára- mitá, the creator of buddha. She is also known as “the source”440 because from this source all noninherently existing phenomena arise. The noninherently existing phenomena include the ten powers, the non-fears, and so forth of the 84,000 groups of dharmas. The arising of these is from the source, the realm of buddha. The place of the buddhas and the bodhisattvas is a place of joy and a place of birth. That which gives rise to blood, urine, and semen is not the source. Flere the realms of desire and nondesire of those of samsara are not those of the tathágata. Therefore the source has the nature of the dharmadhátu; it is Viávamátá embraced by Buddha Kálacakra and at all times is divorced from all obscuration.441"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 577These and other passages clearly teach that when the yogi arises in the form of Kalacakra in the aspect of mother-and-father embrace, the mahamudra consort refers to the mother in the form of Visvamata. Therefore, as pre­viously explained, yogis of high intelligence enter union with as many mahamudra consorts as there are atoms in M ount Meru, and these mahamudra consorts are mostly in the form of Viivamata.How the meditations of the three types of practitioners rely on the mahamudra consort to develop the unchanging blissPractitioners of high, middling, and low intelligence in the form of Kalacakra mother and father must focus on mother-and-father union and dwell single-pointedly in that desire. The Cakrasamvara Commentary says:Concerning meditative concentration, unchanging bliss is achieved from the yearning for the desired goddess.442[489] Naropa’s commentary to A Short Teaching on Initiations t r e a t s these words of the Cakrasamvara Commentary,443 In the Supreme and Unchang­ing summary of the Great Commentary, an opponent is questioning the thinking of the Great Commentary:How does the yogi develop desire in his mind for an apparition of the mind, then destroy the obscurations of the mind and enjoy the gnosis of unchanging bliss when this apparition is a body devoid of atoms?444A Short Teaching on Initiations says:From desire for the mahamudra consort, unmoving bliss is born; initiated by the great wisdom, the unmoving is realized.445In commentary on this, Naropa says:“Mahamudra consort” is a form arising from space. The “desire” is one’s own meditation, from which the “unmoving” is born."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"578 Part S: Gnosis: The Completion StageThis refers to the halting of the emission from the vajra jewel.This is the body innate joy, speech innate joy, and mind innate joy.446These passages clearly teach that with oneself in the form of Kalacakra mother and father, one develops desire for union and generates the unchanging bliss. This is the way the mahamudra consort generates unchanging bliss.The practitioner of low intelligence meditates in this way but is unable to generate unchanging bliss by relying on a mahamudra consort from the very beginning, so as a method of developing unchanging bliss, he first relies upon an activity mudra consort to bring the bodhicitta down to the tip of the vajra jewel. Thereafter this drop is prevented from changing or moving elsewhere by the power of the mahamudra consort, from which arises one instance of unchanging bliss. This is the first of the 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss. After this he develops the second and fol­lowing instances of unchanging bliss by relying on the mahamudra consort. In this connection, immediately after quoting the tantra verses beginning “A mere apparition of the mind” as a source for mahamudra consort med­itation, [490] the Supreme and Unchanging summary says:These are the definitive words of the Buddha. The yogi aban­dons the changing bliss that arises from the union of the two external organs, meditates on the mahamudra consort, this mere apparition of mind, until the finality of enlightenment.447Therefore, up to and including the branch of recollection, any or all of the three types of practitioners will generate bliss by the union of the two organs. The practitioner of low intelligence will especially rely on an activ­ity mudra consort and develop changing bliss through the union of the two organs. However later he will be able to generate unchanging bliss by rely­ing on a mahamudra consort, and from that point onward the yogi “aban­dons the changing bliss that arises from the union of the two external organs and meditates upon the mahamudra consort, this mere apparition of mind, until the finality of enlightenment.” In the phrase “mere apparition of mind,” the word “mere” does not negate the reality of the mahamudra con­sort, but negates atom-created materiality, as in the case of external form.The practitioner of middling intelligence generates unchanging bliss"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 579through reliance on a wisdom consort, and apart from the difference in con­sort, his practice is similar to the above. The practices of relying upon these two types of consorts have been explained in the section on recollection.The practitioner of high intelligence, from the moment he develops the ability to produce unchanging bliss, relies solely on the mahámudrá con­sort to generate unchanging bliss. In the form of Kálacakra mother and father, he focuses single-pointedly on union and meditates on desire. This causes the candáli fire to blaze, and one red speck travels to the crown of his coarse body. When it is stabilized, the white bodhicitta melts and descends through the central channel to the tip of the vajra jewel, where it is held firm by the power of the mahámudrá consort. From this, one instance of unchanging bliss arises, and this bliss, indivisible from oneself in the form of empty-form Kalacakra mother and father, [491] directly cog­nizes nonaspected emptiness like water being poured into water. This is the first of the 21,600 instances of bliss, the attainment of the path of seeing— wherein emptiness is newly seen with direct perception— and the attain­ment of the first level, great joy.Using the above process as an illustration, the 21,600 white drops are then stacked up in succession inside the central channel from the tip of the vajra jewel to the center of the crown cakra. Similarly 21,600 red specks are stacked from the crown to the tip of the vajra jewel, and 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss, developed in dependence on the drops and arranged in groups of 1,800, will form the twelve levels.The way that the twelve levels of the Kálacakra tradition are presented as the ten levels of the árya paths of practice and the reasons for that have already been explained. From the tip of the vajra jewel to the center of the secret-area cakra, 3,600 white drops are stacked inside the central channel. The lower 1,800 drops give rise to 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss. This is the first level. The 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss that arise in dependence on the upper 1,800 drops make up the second level. Likewise the levels from the secret area to the navel and other cakras can be known from the previous section on divisions by numbers.O n the creation of instances of bliss from the drops stacked one after another from the tip of the vajra jewel to the crown, the Great Commen­tary on the seventy-fifth verse of the Gnosis chapter says:Whatever [drops] there are of bodhicitta travel from the fore­head to the throat, heart, navel, and secret place. They are"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"580 Part $: Gnosis: The Completion Stagestopped by the power of pranayama. At the secret place the body drop is halted. Likewise the speech, mind, and gnosis drops are halted at the navel, heart, and throat. “O f these drops, the mov­ing fluid” means that the fluid, which is liquid by nature and different from the body drop at the secret place, which is natu­rally thick, is spoken of as “moving fluid.” This is stopped at the “tip of the victory banner of the vajra jewel,” meaning at the opening of the organ. [492] This moving fluid is “wisdom gno­sis, if bliss is granted by the cause of the unmoving succession of drops.” At this time this is not the gnosis of the activity mudra consort but the accomplishment of wisdom gnosis. Because it is immobile, “the instances of unmoving bliss are dharmadhatu here” and granted by Prajnaparamita. Therefore the bliss of the mahamudra is supreme and unchanging.448The meaning of this passage is as follows. The drops, indicated by the word “whatever,” reach down from the forehead to the secret area. Those that are coagulated drops are stopped from falling by the power of pranayama. They are the body, speech, mind, and gnosis drops and are stopped at the secret area, navel, heart, and throat respectively. The molten fluid, which is dif­ferent from the solid body drop at the secret area, is halted at the opening of the organ at the tip of the vajra jewel. By what is it blocked? By the mahamudra consort. Therefore this molten fluid, which is given the name “moving fluid,” is halted and made immobile by the mahamudra consort. If instances of unchanging bliss are granted with the succession of stacked drops prevented from moving elsewhere as a cause, then at that time this bliss is the bliss of wisdom gnosis and becomes the fourth initiation. It is “not the gnosis of the activity mudra consort.” Because the succession of drops does not move to other places, the instances of unmoving or unchanging bliss are here called dharmadhatu. From what cause are they produced? They are granted or produced by the mahamudra consort Prajfiaparamita. This is the meaning of the above passage.Similarly the specks or red bodhicitta consdtuents are stabilized from the crown to the tip of the vajra jewel. The Later Kalacakra Tantra says:From fluid rising up, specks traveling down, the indestructible melody of Brahma, from which, stains upon the vajras"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 581of body, speech, and mind are destroyed, to become an enlightened buddha.449The root tantra A Short Teaching on Initiations also says:When living beings die, moon nectar falls, sun specks of Rahu move up, and consciousness is of samsara.Greater than that, moon nectar moves up,Sun specks of Rahu move down,and consciousness is of unchanging bliss.450[493] These verses are saying that the white bodhicitta constituent is stacked up from the tip of the vajra jewel to the crown, and the red speck con­stituent is stacked downward from the crown to the tip of the vajra jewel. From this the mind turns into the 21,600 instances of bliss and finally into the nonabiding nirvana.To summarize, the 21,600 drops of the white constituent are stabilized within the central channel from the tip of the vajra jewel up to the center of the crown cakra. One instance of unchanging bliss is generated in dependence upon each drop, and by 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss joining with emptiness, the resulting gnosis of bliss and emptiness destroys the clinging to true existence and its imprints as well as the imprints of falling bliss. Also, by stopping the 21,600 breaths, the winds of the twelve wind movements are halted. Each instance of bliss is divided into a path of noninterruption and a path of freedom. Each instance of bliss as the direct cognition of emptiness on the path of noninterruption is the antidote to clinging to true existence and its imprints. Each instance of bliss in its aspect of unchanging bliss is the antidote to falling bliss and its imprints. The paths of freedom are the states of actual abandonment accomplished by the noninterrupted paths, and they are also accompanied by instances of bliss and so number 21,600.The way the instances of unchanging bliss halt the wind movements is as follows. Each wind movement consists of approximately 1,800 breaths, and each creation of unchanging bliss halts one breath. In this way, with the completion of 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss, one complete wind movement has been halted. Applying this process to the other wind move­ments, each level has 1,800 instances of unchanging bliss, and so with the"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"582 Part $: Gnosis: The Completion Stagecompletion of each level, one wind movement is halted. Finally 21,600 instances of unchanging bliss are generated, [494] the twelve levels are accomplished, clinging to true existence and falling bliss, along with their imprints, are destroyed. The twelve wind movements are halted, and the twelve aspects of truth and the sixteen realities are achieved.451On this the tantra says:Meditate on the supreme and unchanging.W ith vajra placed inside lotus,bring the winds into the drops,the drops into the cakras;the movement of drops halted at the vajra,always rigid, the yogi continuously raises fluid.W ith the yoga of mahamudra,the descent to the vajra, and by its blessing,the instances of supreme unchanging,completed at 21,600,will bring the great enlightenment,the attainment of Vajrasattva.452The necessity for the practitioner of high intelligence to abandon activity and wisdom mudra consorts and to rely solely on a mahamudra consort once he has developed the ability to generate unchanging bliss, and for practitioners of middling and low intelligence to do the same once they have developed the ability to induce unchanging bliss solely in reliance upon the mahamudra consort, is taught in verse 199 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter:Mind abandons impure activity mudra consorts and mentally conceived wisdom mudra consorts.For the attainment of perfect enlightenment,the she-creator of supreme buddha,supreme, unsullied mudra consort, unchanging in aspect,all-pervading, dispelling darkness vast as space,the path traveled by yogis, forever unchanging,the radiance of gnosisdestroying the impurities of existence,meditate upon this wisdom of Kalacakra.453"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"The Yoga o f Meditative Concentration 583The verse beginning “Mudra, like an illusion”454 quoted in the Supreme and Unchanging summary is prefaced by the words “The characteristics of the mahamudra consort are spoken of.” Also the Root Tantra, quoted in the same summary, says:Abandoning activity mudra consortsand conceived wisdom mudra consorts,meditate upon the mahamudrawith the yoga of the supreme and unchanging.455Valid cognitionThe Vajragarbha Commentary says: [495]Apparitions are seen by a nonconceptual mind. A nonconcep­tualizing and nonmistaken cognition is said to be a direct cog­nition. This is of four kinds: direct sensory cognition, direct mental cognition, direct yogic cognition, and direct self-know­ing cognition. These reveal, engage, attain, and experience.456As this quote makes clear, the way that the six-branched yogas are deter­mined as being direct cognitions is from the point of view of the cognition being nonmistaken and nonconceptual regarding the empty forms. These empty-form apparitions are clear unobstructed appearances, and the cog­nition therefore is nonconceptual. The cognition is unmistaken and unde­ceived as regards the appearance of these empty forms and is therefore a valid cognition. It has already been explained what type of valid cognition the first five branches are. This sixth branch can be classified as yogic valid cognition directly perceiving emptiness. However, because it is a noncon­ceptual, nonmistaken consciousness experiencing supreme and unchanging bliss, Buton Rinpoch^ has called it a direct self-knowing cognition.457 Gyalt- sap Rinpoche also asserts it to be a direct self-knowing cognition.458Purification divisionsThe form aggregate group of six phenomena is purified by this branch.

Therefore the purification accomplished by meditative concentration is that “in a few days,” referring to the days of three years and three fortnights,460 the “gnosis form will be accomplished.” This refers to enlightenment with its attainment of the ten powers and so forth.461[496] Concerning the ultimate results, the aggregate of form, the earth ele­ment, the organ of the body, the sensory source of smell, the anus, and the action of speaking are the six phenomena transformed into nonobscuration to become Vairocana and so forth.Know how the lotus of the empty-form mudra consort in recollection yoga induces great unchanging bliss.462Therefore, with an extensive explanation of these vajra words, the branches of recollection and meditative concentration, and the completion stage itself, have been explained.584 Part $: Gnosis: The Completion Stage"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"e Fruits of the Two StagesThis has two outlines:1.

The lower results are the siddhis of pacification, increase, and so forth, and the middling results are the eight siddhis. These are not the only results, because “enlightenment also” is the supreme result of the two stages.The generation stage, as previously explained, [497] is completed when the mindstream has been ripened for the actual development of the special completion stage, whose branches from withdrawal to meditative concen­tration are practiced as has been described. From this arises “full and perfect enlightenment by single instances.” This means that after the completion of 21,600 instances of supreme and unchanging bliss comes the initial accomplishment of enlightenment. Then comes the yoga of the great bliss of complete enlightenment, where all instances are without differences of quality, whether one or many, the supreme nonduality of method and wis­dom. This is spoken of in the fifth summary of the Realms chapter:Here the meditator meditating upon all the instances attains “full and perfect enlightenment by single instances.” This means that the practitioner meditating upon the 21,600 instances of supreme unchanging bliss firstly attains full and perfect enlight­enment by instances of supreme unchanging bliss. After that comes the yoga of complete enlightenment, the supreme non­duality, where all instances are without difference, whether one or many.465Furthermore verse 162 of the Gnosis chapter says:The flow of the moon and sun is weakened, the great winds of the two paths also are halted,"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"The Fruits o f the Two Stages 58 7the lotus awakens the vajra, the moon melts and engages with the great form of the sun.Phenomena and nonphenomena become one,the indestructible is seen in the three-existence forms.At that time, as he moves to the supreme level, there is not the slightest nonduality for such a yogi.The wrathful, the buddhas, goddesses,Rasavajra, Ksitigarbha, and so forth, manifest in space minds of great joy to the yogi at this time of accomplishment.On a solar day of the moon, at dawn and midnight, the desired siddhi of the yogi arises.Because of the moment, rains of jewels or flowers fall to earth.466To explain these verses a little: the flow of the left and right moon and sun winds is weakened, [498] and in the pathways of the left and right chan­nels the “great wind,” or karmic winds, are completely halted. The lotus of the consort awakens and stiffens the vajra of the yogi, causing the moon drops to melt from the forehead and to stabilize from the tip of the vajra jewel to the crown. This “engages with the great form of the sun,” which refers to the sun specks of red bodhicitta stabilized from the crown down to the vajra jewel. Because of this, “phenomena,” referring to method or unchanging bliss, and “nonphenomena,” referring to wisdom or the empty- form mahamudra consort, become indivisibly one. All indestructible sounds abiding in the hearts of all beings living in the “three-existence forms,” or three realms, are well perceived and seen. At that time for such a yogi there is not the slightest separation between method and wisdom as he moves to the supreme level of ultimate union.Having arrived at this ultimate level, the yogi possesses minds of supreme and ultimate joy. At this time of accomplishment, the thirty-six phenom­ena associated with his being, consisting of the aggregates, elements, and so forth, are all freed of obscuration.

This desired siddhi of the yogi, the ultimate level of union, is realized on a “solar day of the moon,” meaning on a particular solar day at midnight or at dawn. Due to the power of this moment of supreme and complete enlightenment, a rain of jewels or a rain of flowers falls to earth.The status of the body, speech, and mind of the yogi who has realized this highest enlightenment is taught in the next verses:The body is of clarity, devoid of atoms, like the sky, well completed by the signs and so forth.The three worlds are clear, free of obscuration, and like appearances in a dream.Speech is completely unbroken, in languages of many, entering the hearts of others. [499]Mind is full of the highest bliss, unmoving, at all times embraced by the innate.467These verses will be explained a little. For the yogi who has achieved the ulti­mate union, the coarse body composed of atoms has gone. The empty-form Kalacakra in mother-father aspect is of total clarity, devoid of obscuration and obstruction, and is therefore like the sky. It is a body perfected by the thirty-two signs of an enlightened being and by the eighty marks, referred to by the words “and so forth.” To the mind of the yogi the three worlds are as clear as crystal, free of obscuration. They are dreamlike appearances, untainted by the contamination of the two types of obscurations.The speech of the yogi is “completely unbroken,” meaning that its con­tinuum is never severed. “In the languages of many,” meaning in languages that accord with those of countless living beings, it enters accordingly “the hearts,” or minds, of countless other living beings. The mind of the yogi is filled with the highest and supreme bliss one-pointedly focused upon emptiness. It never moves from its meditation for an instant and at all times is embraced by the innate clear-light mind.These verses teach the four bodies and the four vajras of body, speech, mind, and gnosis. How? The body, speech, and mind vajras are clearly taught. The gnosis vajra is indicated by the line “Mind is full of the high­est bliss” because the ultimate bliss is established as being the gnosis vajra. Concerning the four bodies, the two lines beginning “The body is of clarity”"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"The Fruits o f the Two Stages 589directly teach the sambhogakaya enjoyment body adorned with the signs and marks and implies the nirmanakaya basic emanation body with its countless emanations. The empty form adorned with signs and marks that is first actualized at the end of the last instance of unchanging bliss is the sambhogakaya, whereas the manifestation of empty forms or “manifold sambhogakaya forms” adorned with the signs and marks and directly pro­duced by that sambhogakaya to pervade the three realms is the basic nirmanakaya. [500] Both these are directly taught by the lines beginning “The body is of clarity.” These empty-form “manifold sambhogakaya forms” pervading the three realms are clearly taught in the Great Com­mentary. On verse 232 of the Methods of Accomplishment chapter it says:With the application of direct cognition “manifold sambhoga- kaya forms like stars in the sky,” meaning like a host of stars, are seen with the fleshly eye and so forth in the three worlds and the three times like dreams and illusions.468But isn’t this how empty forms are seen during withdrawal and the other branches? The Great Commentary continues:With the attainment of full and perfect enlightened mind, they are seen by the gnosis eye.469This teaches that at the time of enlightenment, these forms are seen by the gnosis eye. Therefore the forms are actual buddha forms adorned with the signs and marks and appearing like a host of stars.But in this tradition doesn’t the sambhogakaya enjoyment body refer to the indestructible speech of the buddha? How can there be a sambhogakaya adorned with the signs and marks? It is true that the speech of the buddha is known as the sambhogakaya, but the tantra also talks of a sambhogakaya adorned with the signs and marks. In the third summary of the Realms chapter it says:These two, the buddha and the bodhisattva, are related as teacher and requestor by way of nirmanakayas or sambhoga- kayas. The former and the latter are not contradictory.470Also:"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"590 Part y. Gnosis: The Completion StageHe displayed the mandalas and magical creations, then entered the sambhogakaya, source of the nirmanakaya471This teaches that Sucandra withdrew his emanations and entered his own sambhogakaya. The nirmanakaya implied by the sambhogakaya enjoyment body is spoken of in the third summary of the Realms chapter as being of countless manifestations: [501]By the force of previous prayers and with all wisdom and merit accumulations complete, glorious qualities such as fearlessness all perfected, the conquering Buddha in countless emanated illusory and nonobscured forms in the great thousand world realms employs the languages of every living being when various requestors request the Buddha in the limitless tongues of limit­less living beings. With omniscient speech he teaches worldly and nonworldly dharma. Yet the Omniscient One is not more than one. For example, someone with great powers of illusion will manifest many forms, and with the forms he has created he will uproot trees and shake mountaintops. In the guises of Mahadeva and Visnu, he will bind Devadatta and others. Yet this great illusionist is not more than one person. In this way, the illusory emanations of buddhas and bodhisattvas work for living beings.472As this passage indicates, by the power of prayers and the completion of the two accumulations, the conquering buddhas do not move even for an instant from the nonconceptual state of unchanging bliss and emptiness united as one taste. At the same time the three realms appear to them as a dream, without obscuration, and as clear as images in a prognostic mirror. By knowing how the three realms appear in impure aspect to the minds of others, they see the complete extent of existent conventional phenomena as clearly as a berry in the palm of the hand. From this omniscience there emerges limitless emanated forms, each of which employs speech that accords with languages of limitless living beings and teaches a dharma that is disposed to the minds of each these beings. In this way the buddhas work solely for the benefit of living beings for as long as space lasts.

This teaches the sambhogakaya as the speech of a buddha. The “mind” in the third line, “Mind is full of the highest bliss,” is one of unchanging bliss dwelling indi- visibly in emptiness. This line, therefore, teaches the svabhavikakaya nature body, or great bliss body. “Unmoving, at all times embraced by the innate” teaches the innate clear-light mind dwelling indivisibly with emptiness and therefore teaches the dharmakaya.The ultimate unchanging bliss merged inseparably with emptiness, as signified by the letter vam, indivisible from form endowed with supreme characteristics, as signified by the letter e, represents the ultimate result. Furthermore the thirty-six phenomena of the aggregates and so forth, free of obscuration, and arranged in five categories are signified by the five parts of the letter vam. The thirty-six phenomena of the elements and so forth, free from obscuration and arranged in six categories, are signified by the six parts of the letter e.

This vajra body is the site of practice for the completion stage of tantra.3 Ráhu and Kálágni (or Ketu), although classified as planets, are the ascending and descending nodes of the moon respectively.4 John Newman discusses Kalacakra’s arrival in India in great depth in Sopa et ah, p. 65.5 See Fendall, p. 5; Sopa et ah, p. 76.6 Stearns, pp. 24-27.7 According to a conversation with Edward Henning.8 A photo of the mandata appears in Wayman, p. 80.9 C akras, or channel wheels, are essentially clusters of channels within the vajra body and are usually entwined around the central channel. Likened to a locus, the chan­nels that run to and from a chakra are called petals.10 g tu m m o, ca n d á li. The inner heat developed by sustained concentration and visu­alization at the navel cakra during completion-stage practices.11 Abhyakaragupta’s attempts to do just this are dealt with in the text.12 sto n g g zu g s. Empty form is central to Kálacakra and is dealt with in detail in O r n a ­m e n t o f S ta in less L ig h t. Briefly, it refers to forms first developed on the completion stage that are devoid of any atomic structure and are not visualized or deliberately projected by the mind but exist of their own volition. These include empty forms of various appearances developed at the beginning of the completion stage, but pri­marily this term refers to the empty forms of the consort of Kálacakra, known as the m a h á m u d r á consort, and to Kálacakra himself. These empty forms are primary objects of meditation in Kálacakra."},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"618 Notes to pages 8-2813 As Norsang Gyatso details in this text.14 Gyaitsap Darma Rinchen (1364-1432), A b b r e v ia te d E x p la n a tio n o f T h e S ix - B ra n c h e d Yoga o f K alacakra^ Collected Works, vol. ka.15 This simile is used a lot in Kalacakra to illustrate the nature of empty forms. The clairvoyant was usually a young woman who had the power to see prognostic images in a special mirror. These images, like empty forms, would arise of their volition unconstructed by the mind of the clairvoyant.16 The Sanskrit p r a n a y a m a is rendered in Tibetan with a term that literally means “wind exertion” (srog rtsol). The ending d y a m a has several meanings. In the Guhyasamaja tradition it means “lengthening” whereas in Kalacakra it means “stopping.” The term p r a n a is also multilayered. Therefore, I feel the term is best left in the Sanskrit p ra n d y a m d , a term familiar to Western devotees of Indian yoga practices.17 p. 555. >18 For much of the following discussion on the shentong philosophy of the Jonang, I am indebted to the in-depth analyses found in Ruegg, Stearns, and Fendall.19 Attempts have been made in the notes to identify and reference many of these cri­tiques, especially those of Rendawa.20 As explained to me by Sonam Rinchen, student at the Tibetan Medical and Astro College, Dharamsala, India.21 These paragraphs on the development of traditions of astronomy in Tibet have been mostly drawn from Shawo, pp. 28-32.N o tes to the In tro d u c tio n1 rigs Idan.

See bibliography.26 Beginning with Saturn at zero, seven planets rule the days in turn. The planet rul­ing this particular day was the sun.27 According to Edward Henning, normally this means that sixteen mansions have been traversed and the moon is one hour into the seventeenth. The month is usu­ally named after the lunar mansion in which the full moon falls but this is often approximate. The sixteenth lunar mansion is Vais'akha and the seventeenth is Anuradha. Therefore either the author is using a system of numbering in which “sixteen” means “in the sixteenth mansion” or that the month was named after the sixteenth mansion even though it was actually (although only one hour) into the seventeenth. The hours are hours of “distance” or degrees.28 A lunar eclipse.29 Toh 1 Kangyur, ’dul ba, nga, 33by.30 Toh 301 Kangyur, mdo sde, sa, 4ia4.31 Jonang Chogle Namgyal, 1306-86."},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"620 Notes to to pages $2-3932 Because, according to Buton Rinpoché and others, the six hundred years must begin from the year of the enlightenment, which is the Wood Monkey year.33 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, iri, 264b3.34 Edward Henning says that months are either waxing-led or waning-led depend­ing on which half of Caitra month the sun enters Aries. Entering Aries in the wax­ing half designates Caitra as a waxing-led month beginning from the first lunar day of the waxing or “bright side.” That month becomes the first month of the new year. When the sun enters Aries during the waning or “dark side” of Caitra, Vaiéákha is posited as beginning from that full moon and becomes the first month of the new year.

Then it descends eleven thousand yojana on its southern journey.

Kirti Tsenshap Rinpoché explains this line provisionally: the casing of the ritual bell is seen as a lotus and mentally divided into eight petals, and the bell’s “finger” strikes the left of the left petal. An explanation can also be found in the Great Exposition o f Secret Mantra by Tsongkhapa, p. 375, where he explains the first g .yon p a as referring to the consort and the second as meaning “left.” There could be a play on words here. The channel is known as the Vaj radhatvlsvarl channel and is found to the left of the center of the consort’s lotus. The finger is used to stim­ulate this channel, and the syllable i i is uttered before the main mantra.

This would contradict the assertion that this section is a meditation on the accumulation of wisdom. However Gyaltsap J€ says that the translation is at fault and that “form”('gzugs, riip a ) in the above sentence should have been translated as “nature.” This would make the sentence an instruction to meditate on ultimate or nonaspected emptiness. However not all instances of rupa can be rendered as “nature,” because phrases such as “devoid of all aspects” and “emptiness beyond the nature of mat­ter” are often used as synonyms of conventional-truth empty form.25 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, sri, 20324.26 chos 'b y u n g, d h a rm a b h a v a .27 The 30th or final day of a month.28 The seed syllable has ten component parts, because the h a m is broken down into four.

The two words b rta n and g ta n are pronounced the same and are similar in meaning, but there are differences. G ta n is connected with time, often with the meaning of con­stant, permanent, and so forth. B r ta n means firm or stable. The etymology of bsam g ta n , therefore, is a mind that is constandy held or fixed, hence m e d ita tiv e absorption. Tsongkhapa is saying that some have confused these two terms.201 Toh 1372 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, ba, 224b6.202 Toh 361 Kangyur, rgyud, 1533.203 Toh 1351 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, na, 26035.204 Toh 1351 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, 252b3."},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"Notes to pages 464—76 663205 Unable to trace the author of this citation.206 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, sri', 3882.207 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, sri, 38887.208 Toh 362 Kangyur, rgyud, ka , v. 122,11384.209 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, sri, 39125.210 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, iri, 388b6.211 Collected Works, vol. da , 1123.212 Toh 361 Kangyur, rgyud, ka , 1323.213 Toh 1372 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, ba, 22486.214 Toh 362 Kangyur, rgyud, ka, v. 116, 8983.215 Toh 845 Kangyur, rgyud, iri, 13726.216 Toh 443 Kangyur, rgyud, cha, 15437.217 Toh 443 Kangyur, rgyud, cha, 15481.218 Toh 1351 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, 24625.219 Collected Works, vol. ga, In stru c tio n s on W ith d r a w a l a n d M e d ita tiv e A b so rp tio n .220 P2064 Tengyur, rgyud ’grel, ka, 14382.

Alternatively Kirti Tsenshap Rinpoché says that according to Khedrup Jé, aspected emptiness is spe­cific ultimate-truth emptiness linked to specific phenomena, while nonaspected emptiness is the general phenomenon of emptiness. The Jonang tradition would say that the nonaspected emptiness as taught in the perfection of wisdom sutras, or the second turning of the wheel of dharma, has no essence, is a nihilistic emptiness, and therefore is inef­fective in the development of enlightenment. Aspected emptiness, on the other hand, refers to the ultimate-truth buddha essence eternally present in al living beings or, in a tantric sense, to the ultimate-truth màhamudrâ consort “endowed with every supreme aspect,” whose prac­tice will lead to enlightenment in the form of Kàlacakra."},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"674 Glossaryavadhuti.

Kalacakra literature mentions different kinds of bliss. They are not mutually exclusive. All are connected with the movements of the white elemental bodhicitta, or seminal fluid. Innate bliss is the bliss of withholding the fluid from emission, and is found throughout the completion stage. It is also the term used in tantras other than Kalacakra. Great innate bliss is used as a synonym for unchanging bliss. Falling bliss is the bliss of emission.

However generation of changing bliss does not always mean emission of seminal fluid. D efinitive unchanging bliss is first generated on the sixth branch, meditative concentration. Therefore bliss generated on the preceding branches, during which emis­sion is prevented, has to be changing bliss, even though there is no emis­sion. Alternatively bliss developed on the first five branches is also called unchanging bliss or nonchanging bliss because emission is prevented, but it is not the definitive unchanging bliss.
