N."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ABSTRACT This study contains translations and editions of the tantras of the Indian Buddhist Tantric deity Vajrabhairava, who bound by oath the pre-Buddhist god of the underworld Yama to the protection of the Buddhist doctrine. These texts have played a significant role in the history of Buddhist tantric practice, in particular amongst the Dge lugs pa of Tibet and Mongolia for whom this is one of the three most important anuttara-yoga- tantra cycles. A) The first of the four parts into which this study is divided contains three sections : I. The first is a general introduction which attempts to place the tantras and other such \"mystical\" phenomena into a non- rationalist - and non-phenomenological - context. It is argued that the way forward for the study of \"mystical\" texts and systems lies along paths well-trodden for centuries by the practitioners of such systems, and not along recently invented arbitrary rationalist paths. The section closes with a short account of the traditional Buddhist explanations of the tantric path. II. The second section considers the ancient Indo-European deity Yams and the sacred nature of the wild cattle associated with him. The argument involves a reappraisal of the species of cattle associated with Yama and Vajrabhairava, and reaches the conclusion that the most likely species was the extinct Aurochs Bos rims enius, This finding also necessitates a reappraisal of the relationship between the Indo-Iranians and cattle which has hitherto been considered a primarily economic one involving domesticated cattle rather than a religious one involving wild ancestral cattle. III. The nature and myths of the deity Yama are then considered and an astrological explanation of his association with the Aurochs is provided. Vajrabhairava himself is then discussed primarily on a mythical basis. B) The second part contains a translation of five primary canonical treatises concerning Vajrabhairava with annotations which include material from the Indian commentaries preserved in the Tanjur. C) The third part contains editions of the Tibetan versions of those five texts and editions of the available canonical Mongolian translations of the three primary texts. D) The study concludes with a three part bibliography, a Tibetan- Sanskrit- Mongolian- English glossary, a Mongolian-Tibetan glossary, an index and an appendix presenting a short Tibetan text detailing how the Vajrabhairava-tantras are to be read. z"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ERRATA p12 Illustration reproduced from Tsultem 1986. p31 for regardless read regardless of. p68 Illustrations from Rol pa'i rdo rje's Three Hundred Images; reproduced in Olschak and Wangyal 1973). p73 Illustrations from Rol pa'i rdo rje's Three Hundred Images; reproduced in Olschak and Wangyal 1973). p81 Illustration reproduced from the Ngor Collection (Ngor mthar rtse mkhan po 1983). p83 for brgyad read brgya. p99 for liberated read freed. p152 for great flesh read human flesh. p155 for great flesh read human flesh. p160 for great flesh read human flesh. p187 add in red sandalwood for controlling and summoning e ore in ochre (9v). p190 for holding to the assembly read holding to the ritual substances. p192 for attainment of yoga read attainment of union. pl94nl for saliva read urine (despite TD). p194n6 read these syllables are : dha na pa pha ba bha ma ya ra la va 6a $a as ha kqa. p389/390 pages reversed. p407 for how to read read how to recite."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CONTENTS Abstract ............................................... 2 Contents ............................................... 3 Acknowledgements ....................................... 7 List of abbreviations .................................. 8 Note on transcriptions and italicization ............... 9 List of illustrations ................................. 11 PART ONE A.

The blockprinted Kanjur translations show evidence of great care in transcribing Sanskrit words and mantras and in the original Mongolian these transcriptions are used in preference to the more usual Mongolian forms (though there is sometimes no difference between the two). Such words have been transcibed in this essay by underlining all letters which are graphically distinguished in the Mongolian and assuming that a Sanskrit reconstruction is intended rather than a Mongolized form. Mongolized forms are however retained in cases where it has been (subjectively) decided that the word had passed into accepted Written Mongolian (and thus into the dictionaries). An example will make the issue clear : the blockprint P has 4 while the manuscript M has . -J The dictionaries would accept the second and transliterate as dandir-a (the 'normal' form).

THE STUDY OF TANTRA AND THE RATIONALIST QUANDARY i. Preliminary Observations When dealing with mystical [1] texts such as the tantras of Vajrabhairava discussed in this essay, the researcher finds him/herself in a methodological impasse. The problem is a simple one : there is no generally agreed acceptable way, in our rationalist age, to deal with mystical texts or theories. Given this, one can ask : what do we do with the native [2] interpretations of mystical systems? Native interpretations of such (in this case, tantric) material and practices can be presented in our modern, academically acceptable works in one of two ways [3]. Firstly they can be presented phenomenologically in order to achieve some kind of acceptable rationalist status for the research. In other words, phenomenology can be used to formulate non-modern arguments in a way which renders them acceptable to modern rationalist scholars. But this of course means that the academic game is being played according to rationalist rules, and according to those rules the spirits, gods and magical powers dealt with in (for example) tantras do not and can not exist. In short, phenomenology does not mean safety-in-neutrality, it means unstated commitment to a particular view (eg. the view that the tantric's explanation is unacceptable ). Or secondly, by adopting a cultural-relativistic viewpoint it is possible to grant a mystical system/text validity as a functioning system for a particular group of people, again leaving aside the question of whether the mystical systems in question have any claim to a more general type of validity or whether they are to be ºtt"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"regarded as nothing more than primitive curiosities of no practical use. Even though for the modern student of tantra (or any mystical system) there must necessarily be such problems with methods measuring up to rationalist standards, there are other options open. In the case of Buddhist Tantra, the most suitable methods are, not surprisingly, Buddhist tantric methods. These are suitable primarily because, for better or worse, they are the best worked-out methods available to us. Western scholarship cannot hope to do better with ad hoc interpretations of such tantric material (or indeed any mystical material). In fact free (modern) interpretation of these texts is not an option which is open to us (those who think it is should read the closing paragraphs of the 6th. Section of the Vajramahabhairava tantra translated in this essay on p\\! 7). Of course the price one pays for accepting tantric premises is (methodological and philosophico-rational) unacceptability in rationalist eyes. This price I for one am willing to pay on the basis of the following section (A. ii). Taking native interpretations seriously does not mean that only native oriental traditions are usable as exegetical sources. When Indo-Tibetan tantric traditions are being analyzed, there are very large areas in which modern scholarship can improve on traditional modes of scholarship. For example it is possible (for the first time in the history of these tantras) to provide precise specific identification of plants, animals and substances appearing in the texts and also to accumulate piecemeal international comparative information of a type which would not have been available to the traditional Indian, Tibetan and Mongolian commentators on these treatises. Though there are no causal implications when such similarities between cultures far removed from each other are pointed out (eg. who else used Datura, where else IS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"wild cattle cults occurred and so on) it is by no means irrelevant to the understanding of a tantra if these similarities are pointed out. I6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ii. The science of mysticism [41 Students of mysticism and science would generally agree that mysticism is unscientific. If we define the scientific as being simply that which the scientific community considers scientific and studies, then naturally mysticism is unscientific because scientists do not study it. One would however hope that there are also good scientific reasons for why mysticism is beyond the scientific pale in the company of its friends - alchemy, astrology, demonology, witchcraft and the like. But locating these reasons is by no means an easy task. They tend to be unspoken reasons, vague assertions concerning scientific or rational world views and the incompatibility of mysticism with these world views. And it tends to be left at that [5]. This would be all very well - after all there is no reason why a mystical system or experience of any sort should ever want to be considered \"scientific\" (and we shall return to this later). But this arbitrary rejection of mysticism - both the experiences and the theories - leaves the scientific community with several awkward problems since science supposedly has a commitment not just to \"truth\" in general but to all individual facts. If it exists scientists must study it, and so one would expect scientists to be extremely cautious in any ontological rejection of supposedly unscientific phenomena especially as science is the dominant mode of investigation at present and is fully capable of rendering the scientific study of any such phenomena almost impossible given the level of competition amongst academics for public tax money. The moment the accusation \"unscientific! \" is hurled against a theory, scientific and intellectual communities bury their differences, close ranks and ostracize the interloper. In short we find that there are particularly human 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"psychological aspects to the attitudes of science to the unscientific no different in essence to the earlier attitudes of, say, Christianity to the unchristian [6],. Amongst themselves scientists are perfectly willing to concede that the foundations of all scientific subjects are unsteady and unclear at present. Indeed, there are clear indications, for example in mathematics, that the ideal of a rock-solid foundation will remain utterly unattainable, not because of any limitation of human ability but because of the intrinsic nature of the theories and systems we have created. But when showing itself in public, when introducing itself in schools and universities and when called upon to attack the unscientific, science is quite happy to present itself as a solid, all-encompassing, firmly based system superior to every other form of life. In this way, science manages to 1) keep its monopoly on education; 2) remain the primary beneficiary of the public funding of academic life; 3) ensure power, influence and personal comfort for its practitioners; 4) extend its influence to all parts of the world through its claim to universal validity and 5) ridicule and misrepresent anything that seems to conflict with its own preconceived notions of rationality. Much of this is camouflaged with notions of \"liberalism\" and \"equality', \", - \"equality\" in modern Western terms does not mean that other, non-scientific theories or modes of life are equally valid. In Feyerabend's words 'equality mean[s] that the members of different races and cultures now [have] the wonderful chance to participate in the white man's manias, they [have] the chance to participate in his science, his technology, his medicine, his politics' (1978 : 119). Quite simply the superiority of science is taken for granted, and it is taken for granted that every group of people from Amazonian Indians to Siberian reindeer herders, from Buddhists to Muslims should likewise accept %s"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the superiority of science and the dubious boons of technology without question since this renders them \"equal\" to lucky Westerners. And if their cultures fall by the wayside? Too bad, they were unscientific anyway. Of course, Western civilization does consider itself tolerant, and the preservation of quaint manifestations of pre-modern life is encouraged [7]. But the idea that unscientific \"primitive\" philosophies might actually be capable of positively contributing knowledge or wisdom to humanity is immediately rejected without the slightest effort made to investigate or understand. And this seems neither scientific nor rational. A scientist or rationalist may argue that it is the universality of science that enables it to make judgements on the unscientific in this casual way, but of course science is by no means universal since, for a start, it does not deal with the unscientific. The so-called demarcation problem, the problem of where to draw the line between science and non-science (or more precisely between science and metaphysics, with mysticism beyond even the metaphysical pale) has been a major concern not necessarily for scientists themselves, but for their parasites, the philosophers of science. The history of the demarcation problem is long and complex but a brief and imperfect account of its main features would not be out of place, if only to provide ammunition of sorts for students of mysticism who tend to feel uneasy and defenceless when faced with the superficially stable edifice of modern science [8]. Initial attempts made by the logician Rudolf Carnap in the first half of our century aimed at demonstrating that the distinction between science and metaphysics was equivalent to a distinction between sense (or meaning) and nonsense (or meaninglessness). This of course requires definitions of \"meaning\", and definitions of meaning require Wittgenstein. According to his %9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"verifiability criterion a). all words in a proposition must have meaning (\"meaning\" defined by Carnap as being based on observational or perceptual experience, and b). the proposition consisting of meaningful words must in addition take note of the \"type-level\" of the words of the proposition (this was considered to apply both to logical/mathematical propositions and to natural linguistic ones). The aim of the \"type-level\" or \"category\" consideration is to avoid having to consider grammatically correct propositions like 'x is an element of x' or 'the number 7 is green' meaningful. The concepts in question are members of different categories and cannot be mixed in single propositions. A third condition equivalent to the conditions a). and b). was also proposed c). a proposition is genuine if it is reducible to elementary (\"atomic\") propositions expressing observations. An unscientific, irrational or metaphysical proposition does not meet these criteria (although when was this ever looked into in detail? ) This entire elaborate structure turned out to be false - a). is false because it is possible to produce synthetic languages in which 'x is an element of x' or similar \"meaningless\" sentences can be valid; and hence to demonstrate the meaninglessness of a proposition it is be necessary to demonstrate that the proposition is meaningless in all possible consistent languages; b). is false since basing meaning on observables results in an extensional theory of meaning requiring full listing of all things sharing the observable property (ie. there are, and can be, no universals); and c). is false since no scientific proposition can be or is ever reduced purely to observables [9]. When this was realised there were attempts made to construct \"scientific languages\" in which scientific/ rational statements would be well-formed while unscientific or metaphysical statements could not be 20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"expressed. Carnap went on to propose a physicalistic language in which only physical objects and their movement in space and time could be expressed (and this in the post-quantum theory era). The physicalist language was also to be a single unified and universal language. This strained and unnatural idea was soon demolished. Kurt Gödel's two incompleteness theorems demonstrated 1). the impossibility of constructing a language which, while sufficient for expressing all the propositions of a theory, could also express all proofs of the propositions of that theory; and 2). the impossibility of discussing the consistency of a particular language in that language itself. The Polish logician Tarski further managed to demonstrate the necessary paradoxicality of every universal language. In short the logic of scientific languages lies outside the languages themselves. All of these above attempts founder even without the demonstration of their incompleteness or paradoxicality. It makes no sense to produce such theoretical structures and talk of the translatability of scientific statements into the structure unless this translation is actually undertaken (how could we tell otherwise? ). And how do we select the scientific statements to be translated? When we pick up a book on a scientific topic we find it naturally contains a lot more besides well-formed, rational statements. We find polemic, examples, statistics, humour, pictures, references, personal comments and so on - these are just as much part of written science as the few well-formed propositions which a logician might be able to extract (if he had the time, money and inclination to do so). The above attempts at demarcation attempted to provide logically-based structures which would be of universal and eternal validity for the sciences. It is easier to comprehend the motives of those proposing these structures if we bear in mind the trauma occasioned 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"amongst philosophers of science by the demise of Newtonian mechanics and gravitation, the single best corroborated scientific theory of all time. What certainty could there be in science if reams of evidence and proof, experimental corroboration and one-time unanimous agreement amongst scientists turned out in the end to be utterly useless in defending Newtonian physics against quantum theory and relativity? Despite the vastness and complexity of Newtonian physics, despite its technological successes, despite its seemingly perfect experimental and theoretical basis and despite the number and influence of its promoters, it was, not to put too fine a point on it, wrong. Attempts at constructing \"universal languages\" and the like to establish post- Newtonian physics on a firm basis utilizing the results of new developments in logic seem to be not much more than submissions to the standard scientific (and human) desire for complete, firm structures within which a scientific statement can be tested and proved. The impossibility of proof hinted at by the history of 20th. century physics is ignored in such attempts. Other philosophers of science proceeded differently. Since science was neither verifiable nor provable (as the demise of Newtonian mechanics and gravitation had shown) ideas involving the \"probability\" of theories were produced. Best known of all, the theory of the necessary falsifiability of scientific theories was proposed by Karl Popper, according to which a theory was scientific if, and only if, it specified those conditions under which its proponents would accept its falsity. If it were scientific, a theory would make crucial predictions which could be shown to be false. The problem with this idea is that there is not one example of a scientific theory ever having been abandoned just because a few of its predictions turned out to be wrong - the normal human impulse is to paper over the cracks and 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"hang on tenaciously. However, a more sophisticated falsificationist might consider a theory falsified if - and only if - there were another theory available which a). predicted novel facts not predicted by the original theory; b). contained the unrefuted content of the original theory and c). had some of its excess content over the original theory corroborated. In such cases - with much oversimplification - we find that it is no longer a single theory which is judged as \"scientific\" or otherwise; instead we have a sequence of theories, each making differing claims and falling prey to the next theory in the sequence. The list seems endless. Scientific propositions are meaningful. Scientific propositions are translatable into scientific languages. Scientific theories and propositions are testable or provable. Science is self- correcting. Science is falsifiable. Now whether or not science is any of these things, it seems completely unjustifiable to demarcate between science and non- science on this basis. How have rationalists and scientists managed to come to the conclusion that, for example, mysticism is not testable, provable, falsifiable or self-correcting, when it could well be all of these things if scientific theories themselves are? And the theory of evolution in all its forms is quite clearly none of these things, yet its study comes under the purview of university science departments. But to return to the initial problem :a firm demarcation line between the scientific and unscientific worlds is not merely impossible to draw, but is also unnecessary and harmful for science. It is unnecessary because the everyday activity of the scientific community seems to go on oblivious to the \"demarcation problem\", and it is harmful because the scientific community should be willing to accept the existence of a grey zone from which initially unscientific ideas can enter the main 7.3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"body'of science as has happened in the past[1O]. Only if we concede that science is perfect and complete as it currently is can any demarcation be sucessful, and I do not know of a scientist who would be willing to state this. Despite what seems to be a general inadequacy of these protectionist attempts to establish a divide between the scientific and everything else, there is a firm distinction between the mystical and the scientific from the point of view of a mystic. We can make this distinction more easily if we reformulate the original assertion concerning the unscientific nature of mysticism in the following statement : Science is unmystical. Strange as this statement may look, it at least has the merit of being true. Mysticism is the theory and practice of alternate mental states, and mystical knowledge is knowledge acquired in alternate mental states. Mental events which take place in the familiar awake state, for example the invention or comprehension of a scientific doctrine [11], take place in only one possible state amongst many. For a mystic science is unmystical - and hence inadequate - because it makes no attempt to instruct in or to explain the attainment, existence, meaning or usefulness of the numerous other mental states at the disposal of human beings. Scientific knowledge can be valid for a mystic (in fact mysticism can contain all of science as a subset of all possible types of human knowledge), but there is no reason whatsoever for a mystic - or anybody else for that matter - to feel that only knowledge gained in one type of mental state has validity - and yet this is the scientific / rational claim. It is also for this reason that it is not possible for the truth or falsehood of a mystical theory to be determined by scientific means since the mystical theory is not limited to operating within the everyday mental 2t"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"state favoured by scientists and rationalists. As a result the truth or falsehood of, say, Buddhist Tantra is determined simply by whether the practitioners attain the siddhis (supernatural powers) and progress to enlightenment and not by some trivial scientific criterion. Similarly the truth or falsehood of a system of witchcraft aiming at teaching the power of flight is determined by whether or not the witch manages to fly once he or she has correctly undertaken the preliminaries and correctly concocted a flying potion. The truth or falsehood of Shamanism is determined by whether the shaman manages to contact and communicate with the spirits of his tribe. In none of these cases is it sufficient for a rationalist or scientist merely to assert that such systems are false because they do not fit with whatever preconceived idea of rationality the scientist or rationalist may have. Asserting that science is unmystical does not necessarily lead to something like the various \"two- realm\" ontologies proposed by scholars trying to find a place for the religious in the modern science-dominated world (see the critical discussion in Peacocke 1979 : 22- 27). Such distinctions between nature and supernature, the physical /biological and the mental/spiritual or any other similar pair seem to me to accept tacitly once again an arbitrary duality between what is scientific and what is not. It is not merely that it is impossible to demarcate in this manner, but that there is no reason why a two-fold demarcation of this sort should be considered sufficient to encompass all human intellectual and mental activity. Calling science unmystical may provide a demarcation of sorts, but this demarcation could only be considered two-fold if we were to accept the idea that there is a strict duality between the everyday mental state and the \"mystical\" mental state. But there are numerous alternate or mystical mental zS"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"states, and knowledge gained in or from one particular alternate state is not the same as that gained in or from another. So why not \"multi-realm\" ontologies instead? In addition the discussion on the unmystical nature of science leaves untouched other \"unscientific\" theories and systems which may in their turn further complicate the picture. The statement that science is unmystical is \"therefore not the converse of the more familiar assertion that mysticism is unscientific, especially as there is no ontological claim involved. To put it more simply : in general when a believer in science claims that a theory is \"unscientific\", he or she rejects the validity of the theory; on the other hand were a mystic to claim that science is unmystical, this would make no judgement concerning the validity of science at the level of \"everyday\" waking state consciousness. To summarize the two. basic claims of this section : 1). because of the vagueness of current ideas concerning the uniqueness of science and its superiority over all other systems of thought, and because of the inadequacy - or to be precise, non-existence - of \"scientific\" approaches to mysticism, mystical theories cannot at present be considered \"unscientific\". Conversely there seems no real need for any mystical system to be scientific; this would merely serve to reassure modern sympathizers. Science might in time produce its own valid theory of mystical experiences, but it will not be able to do so until it pays attention to extant mystical theories which it cannot at present do since these are \"unscientific\". And 2). science as it is at present can safely be called \"unmystical\" since it arbitrarily considers only one type of knowledge, that acquired in one particular mental state, as valid. ZG"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"iii. Phenomenology and mysticism Certain systems involving experiences of alternate states have been investigated \"scientifically\". In one well-known study, Kasamatsu and Hirai undertook electroencephalographic investigations of the brains of zazen (seated meditation) practitioners (1966). Other similar studies have been made of Tibetan gtum mo (inner heat)' practitioners, transcendental meditators and psychedelic drug users. All such studies, however accurate and scienific they may be, end up as nothing more than feeble phenomenologies. Staal comments that 'the best one can say for most of these studies is that they might broaden the minds of people who are disinclined to accept that meditation has any effects... physiological studies... are not in a position to provide even a first understanding of what is going on - let alone provide explanations in terms of theories' (1975 : 112). It is for this reason that phenomenologies - scientific, anthropological, sociological or otherwise - are uninteresting. When we know that alpha waves appear in the brains of zazen meditators, we know nothing other than the fact that something happens in the brain during meditation, which is hardly surprising in any case. A phenomenologist should however distinguish between two separate phenomenologies. Firstly there is that of the standard phenomenologist, the scientific, anthropological or social phenomenologist of mysticism. This phenomenologist approaches a mystical field of study, observes, takes notes, holds interviews and produces a strictly phenomenological account on this basis. In the terminology of the natural sciences, he or 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"she produces a black box theory [121. Within the black box untouched by the phenomenology reside \"objects\" of the interpreted and non-phenomenological theories of the mystic. These internal non-phenomenological theories, the theories given by the practitioners of the mystical system under consideration naturally end up as parts of the original phenomenological description when they are taken into account by the phenomenologist, but there is no way in which these theories can be taken seriously as interpretative theories of mystical systems if only because these theories are not based on the phenomenology produced by the phenomenologist. Further, since the mystic's explanation is never more than part of the phenomenology, any non-phenomenological elucidation of the resultant black box remains the preserve of standard translucent theories. In the natural sciences translucent theories are found in abundance coexisting with phenomenological theories but in modern studies of mysticism they simply do not exist. Nonetheless, while a phenomenology of mysticism should remain nothing more than a phenomenology, the temptation to throw light upon the black box often proves too great. And it is here that we find ac hoc theories in profusion as phenomenologists rush to fill the empty space provided by the complete absence of current standard interpretative touchstones. There is a second phenomenology that we can construct for the sake of argument. This is a subjective, personal phenomenology of alternate mental or meditative states which exists only in the context of a full, interpreted mystical system for an individual mystic or a group of mystics engaging in similar techniques. It seems unnecessary to abstract a phenomenology from the mystic's system given that the mystic is not a phenomenologist, but it will help make one phenomenological point. The interpreted system of the mystic explains this second, subjective phenomenology, and not the \"objective\" 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"phenomenology of the field anthropologist or experimental scientist, for example. It is small wonder that the two approaches remain completely irreconcilable - the mystic and the phenomenologist are describing completely different phenomena. Until this root confusion is cleared up, there will also be no justification whatsoever for any rationalist, empiricist or scientific rejection of the theories of a mystic. It is in fact more common for the rationalist to dismiss the entire personal and experiential phenomenology of the mystic rather than to bother with theory since by definition the rationalist does not have, never has any intention of having, and does not believe in mystical experiences. There is nothing of any consequence to theorize about. Phenomenologists of course recognize that their approaches are just a beginning - efforts to fix the phenomena to be interpreted, ideally without attempting any kind of interpretation since there seem to be no suitable modern interpretative techniques. But what is actually wrong with the explanations of \"insiders\"? Why are we so reluctant to accept the explanations of mystics themselves? If, for example, a Siberian shaman tells us that after consuming fly-agaric the spirits of the mushroom speak to him and answer his questions, the western academic naturally rejects this explanation because he or she - as a rule - tends not to believe in spirits which inhabit mushrooms. If the temptation to take the easy way out and produce a noncommital phenomenology is resisted, it is usually an explanation in terms of biochemistry or psychology which would come to the fore in this case. But the question of whether the shaman's interpretation is valid or not is left unanswered - it is just assumed to be wrong. So we find it very hard to take non-modern (=non- Western) interpretations seriously. Yet some of these interpretative systems have lengthy histories and Za"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"detailed methodologies which seem far more capable of making sense of mystical systems than some of the systems employed by modern scholars who believe in the primacy of modern logic, philosophy and science. 30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"iv. Buddhism as mystical theory Amongst these unscientific interpretative systems perhaps the most complex is Buddhism. Ever since the inception of Buddhism the prime concern of much Buddhist writing regardless what else it may touch on has been the explaining, justifying, classifying, and instructing in, mental and meditative states. Buddhist explanations in part touch upon features of the external universe but only inasmuch as these flow from or affect mental and meditative states and hence contribute to or hinder progress towards enlightenment. The external universe is supposed to be understood while in meditative states (a process called insight). No true understanding of either internal or external universes can be gained except through entering meditative states. Nirvana is achieved by means of meditative states. Buddhism as theory is the philosophy of meditation, this being a field hardly approachable using modern scientific methods. For these reasons a discussion of how the Buddhist community of India in the first millenium of our era explained, adopted and adapted one particular natural religious system, viz. tantra, is not merely of historical interest. Buddhism, being in possession of a comprehensive theory of mental and meditative states has shown itself to be, and still is, a tool of no little versatility in approaching the mental and meditative states experienced and utilized in natural religion, if its approach to tantra is anything to go by. In this section only the broadest outlines of one particular Buddhist approach to the tantras can be given, one which might be classified as Dge lugs pa (Mädhyamika as far as possible, occasionally lapsing into Yogacära formulations). Fortunately there are now several works in European languages which deal with the details of the 31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Buddhist interpretation and practice of tantra, and excessive detail here would only duplicate what is available elsewhere [13]. The acceptance of tantra - texts, methods, theories and so on - by a large part of the Indian Buddhist community during the first millenium of our era can be considered and understood from two separate Buddhist points of view. Firstly, in terms of the permissibility of tantra, and secondly in terms of the requirement that tantra be approached from a Buddhist point of view. Firstly, the permissibility of tantra : when the current of tantra first manifested itself on the Indian subcontinent as a method for attaining certain powers of worldly and religious kinds, it produced a vast mass of varied and unsystematic written and oral material. Much of it appeared in Buddhist communities, some appeared within the sangha itself. The exact process - as is the wont in Indian history - is unclear, and Snellgrove's account (1987 : 47ff; 117ff) seems about as close as we can reasonably come. It is immediately understandable why these tantric texts came to be widely read, commented upon and theorized about by the Buddhist monastic community. These were new texts, perhaps strange at first sight; nonetheless they contained something entirely different - the teachings given by non-worldly buddhas and their various manifestations. Buddhism is a universal religion in the quite literal sense that it exists in other worlds (all other worlds in fact) and so the existence of other-worldly Buddhist teachings is no surprise. And above all it was according to theory natural that such texts could be revealed to humans since there are sentient beings (the dAkas and däkinis) who move freely between one world and another transmitting teachings and granting initiations to worthy adepts. And secondly, it was necessary that tantra become ý2"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"part of Buddhist practice. Ignoring any Buddhist (or other) interpretation and ignoring tantra as texts, tantra as a particular type of yoga aimed at the accession of certain (divine) mental states belongs to an ur-religious complex of such techniques widespread in both the New and Old Worlds. Put simply, in uninterpreted forms tantra is yet another collection of methods for accessing mental states and using resultant powers. In this it does not differ at all from the main practices of what can be termed \"natural religion\", natural merely because of its ubiquity in some form or another in all pre-modern and pre-urban communities. These natural religions, including tantra (in its \"pre-religious\" forms) have a roughly common set of features, the most significant of which is the presence of identification with a deity (often called possession) in some shape or form. Most of the other features involve transformative methods and experiences related to the process of identification with the deity. These include initiation and initiatory experience, the separability of the 'soul' or 'dream body' from the physical body, the existence of spirits who also appear in animal and plant form, the transformation of the practitioner into divine and/or animal forms, the acquisition of supernatural powers through such transformations and so on (cf. Furst 1976 : 6). The members of the Buddhist sangha of Tantric India themselves lived in environments where the techniques of natural religion were commonplace, and since as Buddhists they were committed to the investigation of their own minds, any natural religious technique would have been of extreme interest to them, regardless of how \"un-buddhist\" these techniques may have seemed. It would simply have been impossible for them to have ignored or dismissed tantra, even in its most \"extreme\" forms. To understand what the deities of tantra are and how the Buddhist yogin is meant to use them - and also to 33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"understand how exactly tantra could become Buddhist - we should consider the relationship that mind has to what is outside it (ie. to its objects). To a Buddhist the starting point is, and has to be, that both mind and its objects exist conventionally, as empirical facts. The meditator can then take his or her mind as the meditative object and try to identify 1. a permanent, eternal essence in the mind; 2. the nature of the mind and 3. the characteristics of the mind. In all three aims he or she fails. In the words of the buddha Vajradhara in the Vairocanäbhisambodhi : 'The mind has never been seen by any of the fully enlightened, supremely attained ones who have conquered inner adversaries, nor will they ever see it. Being formless the mind has no colour such as blue, yellow, red, white, maroon or crystal. The mind has no shape either short or long, either round or square; it is neither light nor dark. It has no sexual identity such as female, male or sexless (PT Gi 44v; Lhalungpa 1986 : 188). The subject/object distinction which is of such overwhelming importance in most philosophies is of much less importance in Buddhism and is regarded as belonging to the category of mistaken views. The consequence of this is that there is a distinct tendency in Buddhism for any characterization of the mind to be equally valid for anything outside the mind (which things are, from the unenlightened point point of view, mistakenly considered to belong to an entirely separate objective realm) [14]1. There is therefore no difference at all between the emptiness of the mind and the emptiness of space, and both these are identical to the mind of enlightenment itself : 1ý"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"' Whatever is the nature of space is the nature of mind. Whatever is the nature of mind is the mind of enlightenment. For this reason the mind, the expanse of space, and the mind of enlightenment are non-dual and inseparable. ' (Vairocanäbhisambodhi; op. cit.; Lhalungpa 1986 : 216). Merely meditating on emptiness is however not enough if the practitioner has pledged to function in cyclic existence (sanjsära). In tantric terms meditation on emptiness will lead to the attainment of the 'dharma aspect' or 'dharma body' (dharmakäya; chos sku) of the buddhas (in other words meditation on emptiness leads to the extinguishing of the causes for continued rebirth in samsara), but it does not lead to a 'form aspect' or 'form body' (rüpakäya; gzugs sku) enabling enlightened functioning in samsara (to which the practitioner, as a bodhisattva, has pledged himself in any case). This form body can take two forms, firstly, the 'enjoyment aspect' (sambhogakäya; longs sku) which is the form employed in a Buddha realm (this form is a three-dimensional geometric shape such as a blue cube); and secondly the 'emanation aspect' (nirmänakäya; sprul sku, ) which is the form adopted amongst sentient beings (eg. Vajrabhairava as illustrated in plate 1). To summarize the reasoning behind this distinctly mahäyänist approach Tsong kha pa in his Sngags rim quotes the Vajrapanjara-tantra : 'If emptiness were the method then Buddhahood could not be. Since other than this cause (=emptiness) there would be no other fruit, the method is not emptiness' (P11 (vol 1. ) 223.4.4.; trs. Hopkins 1977 : 117). The formulation in this passage may seem somewhat obscure, but the argument is merely that if one meditates on emptiness alone, then only that meditation on 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"emptiness can be a cause of enlightenment, but this is not possible since emptiness is not a cause of anything (enlightenment is not a thing but a buddha's form definitely is a thing, though of course one characterized by emptiness). The Vajrapanjara-tantra continues : 'Therefore it [=the method] is the circle of the man ala, it is a binding of the blissful method. Through the yoga of buddha pride buddhahood will not be distant. A teacher has the thirty two marks as well as all the eighty minor marks. Therefore the method of attainment is to take on the teacher's form'(P11 223.4.6-7). This meditative identification with the form of the deity (and its mandala) is known as deity yoga (devayoga; lha'i rnal'byor), and it is this that the tantras partly concern themselves with. Deity yoga is a type of formalized possession involving conscious direction of the evolution of a form body of an enlightened being which resides in a formalized purified universe (the mandala). As the Vajrapanjara-tantra indicates, this form body differs in certain ways from the body of a being who is not enlightened (indeed this observation is found in the very earliest stratum of Buddhism) and thus initial tantric meditational techniques concentrate on rendering the body speech and mind of the practitioner a fit receptacle (samäyasattva or pledge-being) for union with the deity (the jnänasattva or wisdom-being) whose meditation is being practiced. For any discussion of deity yoga, Mädhyamika modes of thinking are best left behind in favour of Yogäcära approaches, though the practice of meditation on emptiness is included in the practice of deity yoga itself. The mental construction of the mandala and deity in deity yoga, when correctly done [151, is meant to differ from an ordinary mental construction in one way. 36"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The subject-object duality which is present in 'ordinary' mental constructions is absent in correctly-performed deity yoga which is consequently characterized by emptiness, since emptiness is the absence of dichotomizing thought and hence also the absence of the subjective and objective independence ('inherent existence'; svabhävasiddhi; rang bzhin gyis grub pa) of subjects and objects). The conventional duality of tantric practice as method (deity yoga) and wisdom (the apprehension of thusness which is the emptiness of phenomena) is in this way shown to be non-dual and only designated in terms of the distinction between the conventionally-asserted opposites of method and wisdom, which are in turn a). mundane appearance and b). acceptance of mundane self. The mahäyäna Buddhists of India accepted and used the tantras because the tantras were legitimately there to be used and because they worked. Whatever characteristics or powers enlightened deities had could also be attained by the practitioner using tantric methods. The deities used for the practice of yoga (the union of the wisdom and pledge beings in a mandala) and for other purposes such as protection did have to meet one requirement, however. They had to be Buddhist deities. This in a Buddhist context means not 'deities in whom Buddhists believe', but 'deities who are themselves Buddhist'. The great deities of the Highest Yoga Tantra (anuttarayoga-tantra) class have impeccable Buddhist credentials (since they are purely Buddhist deities [161), but the ancient gods of India naturally did not. To become fit objects of Buddhist tantric devotion or practice or to become guardians of Buddhism itself, these pre-Buddhist deities need to be converted to Buddhism by high-ranking Buddhist bodhisattvas. The tantras presented in this essay are those of the deity Vajrabhairava, a wrathful manifestation of the Bodhisattva Mafju4rl who 37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"converted to Buddhism the ancient Indian god of death and the underworld, Yama, and bound him by oath to the protection of Buddhism. 38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"NOTES [1] A mystical text is either an oral text, or a written text with an oral transmission which originates from spiritually developed sentient beings in non-human (divine or animal) realms. [2] 'Ernie', to use an unnecessary modern term. While it is true that the boundary between an emic (=insider's) and etic (=outsider's) theory is often indefinable (is a mahayanist's explanation of a theravada text emic or etic? ), in the case of a tantra a firm definition is possible based on whether or not the theorist is initiated or not. Classifying mystical theorists in terms of an initiated/uninitiated duality provides a firm classification which is empirically testable in a way in which emic/etic categorizations are not. [3] Assuming one cares about acceptability from a rationalist point of view. At first sight it would seem that there is no real point in worrying about such issues, but they matter to me for one primary reason. Standards of rationality and scientific truth as vaguely understood in the modern world are those against which all other non-rational and non-scientific mystical systems are measured, and this consequently enables the latter to be ignored at all levels inside modern education (and discouraged outside it). A quick comparison between the budgets and enrolment levels of university science departments and religious studies departments will bear this out. [4] Given the degree of compartmentalization in current academic disciplines, and given the unbelievable amount of work produced on scientific topics this century, it is naturally impossible for a student ouside the scientific world to do any more than provide the vaguest outlines about theoretical problems encountered and discussed within that world. For this reason also, this section has not been overloaded with references which a). can be found elsewhere (Popper 1972 has the detailed references for what has been discussed here) and b). would not be the most up-to-date ones available in any case. It should also be stressed that the chief external (=non- scientific) source of such academic criticism of scientific certainty has been the Catholic community, with whose literature I am completely unfamiliar. In short the topics discussed in this section (and elsewhere) have been discussed much more competently in many other places (one example : Duerr 1985 is the very best (Western academic) defence of non-modern/non- rationalist thinking that I have yet come across). 39"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"[5] Mystical experiences and theories are best ignored as far as current philosophy and science are concerned. Can it just be me who is astonished by reading a major restatement of current views on the mind and the brain produced by two knighted luminaries (Popper and Eccles 1977) which, in almost 600 pages, hardly mentions the states and techniques of meditation or mystical experience at all? There is one short account of - predictably enough - Evans-Pritchard's views on the Azande, followed by Popper's summary of primitive and prehistoric man's discoveries concerning mind and body, one sentence of which reads 'dream experience and states of divine inspiration and possession and other abnormal [! ] states are recognized, also involuntary [! ] and unconscious [! ] mental states (such as those of \"witches\")' (1977 : 158). This seems to be all that a mixture of mainstream philosophy and science can offer regarding the mystical. [6] For a penetrating study of this phenomenon see Feyerabend's account of scientific attitudes to astrology (1978 : 91-96). While the prejudices of our ancestors are obvious, we are hardly ever aware of our own. Prejudice by definition needs this lack of awareness to survive. It was with sorrow that the Inquisitor Remigius recalled, in his old age, those children of witches whom he had saved from death on the pyre. By not burning them as the reasoning of that time and place demanded, he had condemned them to eternal suffering. [7] This is a phenomenon which we might call 'culture as art'. In science-dominated civilizations today, whether democratic or communist, we find the discouragement or persecution of unscientific ways of life coupled with the promotion of the artistic manifestations of these ways of life - native song and dance troupes play to packed concert halls, tourist villages provide imitations of pre-modern life and ritual, and by now meaningless sacred objects are sold to museums and tourists. But this should not be mistaken for tolerance, just as preserving animals in zoos is not the same thing as preserving wildlife. [8] For further details see Popper 1963 : ch. 10-11 and Lakatos 1978 : ch. 1 [91 Nor is the concept of an \"observable\" particularly clear. Dreams and hallucinations are \"observable\", while subatomic particles are in general not observable except by way of complex and expensive equipment the validity of which is generally not discussed in this context. Further, consideration of the structure and biochemistry of the eye and of the process of the 'transmission of information to the brain indicates that \"observation\" or \"perception\" are by no means the simple intuitive notions 4c"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"they seem to be. Add relativistic and quantum effects relating to the observed phenomenon, to the means of information transmission before the eye is reached and to the resultant biochemical phenomena occurring within the eye and brain, and our confidence disappears completely. [10] The idea that meteorites existed was for a long time rejected by the scientific community on the basis that rocks did not fall from the sky - they belonged on the ground. Today as well there are phenomena which have not quite managed to make the transition to scientifically acceptable status : ball lightning, Kirlian photography and hypnotism are three examples. [11] Nor does scientific creativity emerge exclusively from the waking state - another uncomfortable and ignored fact for philosophers of science to take note of. The best known example of scientific understanding attained through the dream state is that of the German chemist F. A. Kekule whose dream of a snake swallowing its tail directly produced the solution to the then crucial question of the structure of benzene and related organic compounds. They turned out to be ring structures. [12] Black box theories are contrasted with translucid or representational theories in dependence on the degree to which the interpretations and explanations underlying the observables form part of the theory. Some examples from science might make this clear. (1) Circuit theory is phenomenological in that it takes no account of the electronic structure of the components of the circuit; that is the task of field theory and quantum theory. (2) S-matrix theory which deals only with the observables (exclusively momenta and spin orientations) prior to and following subatomic particle interactions and ignores the process of interaction itself. (3) Information theory which deals neither with the structure of the transmitting and receiving systems nor with the meaning of the information. For further examples and a scientific account of phenomenology see Bunge 1964.

For a detailed account of the complex practicalities of yogic transformation involving control of the subtle body see Geshe Kelsang (1982). [14] Though this view would find little favour with many mainstream Western philosophers, even the most hardened modern rationalist would agree that a). external appearances are what they are because they appear to a . mind and as appearances are part of a mind (even if their existence as independent objects is asserted); and b). the mind as a thing (or as a system composed of things) is intrinsically no different to other things. [15] It is the presence or absence of this subject-object distinction which determines the correctness or otherwise of the mental construction of the deity and mandala. All yogic meditation characterized primarily by the continued presence of this subject-object distinction ('I in the centre of the ma ala' etc. ) is part of the preparatory stage of tantric practice, the 'generation stage' (utpattikrama; bskyed rim) while the absence of the distinction enables the yogin to embark on the practices of the 'completed' or 'completion' stage (sampannakrama; rdzogs rim). [16] This is not to say that the deities of the highest yoga tantra class do not resemble or are not modelled on Hindu deities; nonetheless there is no doubt about their Buddhist status.

General observations The most conspicuous feature of the full canonical form of Vajrabhairava is the mahisa (\"buffalo\") head (see plate 1). Vajrabhairava seems to be unique amongst highest yoga tantra deities in possessing a primary animal head; no others in the illustrated Gsar ma pantheons have them. Reference to Rol pa'i rdo rje's standard Dge lugs pa pantheon, the 'Three Hundred Images' (sku brnyan brgya phrag gsum or sku brnyan sum brgya reproduced in Olschak and Wangyal 1973 : 113ff. ) confirms this - only in lower categories do animal heads reappear, but even then only in small numbers. Apart from the three \"buffalo-headed\" forms of Yama as Dharmaräja (fig. 1) - intertwined with the cycle discussed here - the pantheon has only three äkinis with tiger, lion and bear heads (nos. 187.188,189) and the mythical bird Garuda (nos. 184,185,186). Outside strictly canonically based material, the number of animal headed deities is predictably larger as reference to Nebesky-Wojkowitz's descriptions (1966) of many Tibetan rnying ma and bon deities will show, but the very predominance of such deities at a more local scale only serves to emphasise the uniqueness of Vajrabhairava in the canonical (non- local) scheme of things.

The cultic background A more in-depth look at the religious role of cattle (genus Bos) and similar animals (in particular the genera Bubalus (Water Buffalos) and Bison at present seems to lead to a lot of guesses and to very few hard facts due to the immense complexity and amount of available data. One thing is however clear. Wherever we look - not least in India - we find members of the cattle clan accorded the highest religious honours, in excess of the honours regularly bestowed on other, perhaps economically equally vital animals (the horse, sheep, or goat for example). Certain recent analyses have nevertheless continued to seek the motivation for sanctifying cattle in their economic usefulness to the Aryans. Lincoln (1981 : 7) is not alone in asserting that the value of cattle to the ancient Indo-Iranians was 'based on their role as the chief source of food - furnishing milk, milk products, meat, and even blood for drinking'. While it is true that cattle have all these uses and many more besides - much as it is true of the Bison in North America, Reindeer in the Arctic and so on - this is not in itself a sufficient reason for worshipping these animals. People - as a rule - tend not to worship mere food (witness the sad religious fate of the humble pig, for example). Whether or not \"cattle\" are divine on account of being food parcels from the gods, as it were, one still has to take into account the presence of wild forms. Domestication is by no means a prerequisite for the granting of divine status for an animal. If anything, domestication enhances the divine status not of the domesticated animals, but of the wild ancestor, the source. In cases where the cult of a by-now domesticated animal is being investigated, there will be fundamental differences between the attitudes of a group who were L% 15"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"familiar with the original wild form and those who were not. The 'terrifying bull gazing from afar', the sacred source of one's mild-mannered domesticated cattle would have produced vastly different (religious) reactions to those produced by the domesticated cattle themselves. Just to take the simplest example, animal sacrifice becomes possible after domestication (since only domestic animals - which category in India always includes humans - are ours to sacrifice). Any further doubt concerning the importance of the wild/domestic distinction can be dispelled by considering the gulf which separates human reactions to wolves from reactions to dogs. And none of this is ever a matter of mere socioeconomics. So we are still left with the question of why wild cattle of any sort should have induced religious feelings if their food-parcel aspect is secondary. What other reason could there be? The answer might be simple even if impossible to prove. It has been discussed elsewhere (cf. a forthcoming paper of mine) that \"mythical truth\" is dependent upon the appearance of this truth in a person's mental continuum in a visionary or mystical modality (an altered state). As a \"truth\", the appearance in question is also \"sacred\" (these two words are synonyms in this scheme). In the course of the evolution of religious thought the initial unity of these two terms \"true/real\" and \"sacred\" ends when the complexity of artificial structures increases. This results in a situation in which it is increasingly human products which make up the visionary bestiary. In the modern West, a hundred cars might appear in a person's dreams before the first wild animal does. At this evolutionary stage no longer can what appear in visions or dreams be regarded as \"sacred\" since there is awareness of the fact that these items are just products, nothing more. They have no behaviour. This is why there are no ploughshare gods or wheelbarrow gods 46"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"in the history of religion, despite the vastly important role these items have played in improving the economic lot of humans, and despite the number of dreams in which they must have figured over the centuries [1]. So if wild cattle had appeared regularly in the visions of early humans then they would by definition have been sacred. This seems very facile. Why should wild cattle appear preferentially in the visionary life of certain groups of people? Why not other, more impressive animals? In this era of domesticated cattle we need to remember that wild cattle are (or were) extremely impressive even when compared to the larger carnivores. All wild cattle are heavily muscled, fast, agile, intelligent and distinctly agressive animals with large males in some species standing well over two metres tall at the shoulder. Nor are these animals primarily solitary. Our ancestors must have often encountered them in very large herds often numbering many thousands. The frequency of encounters with these cattle would also have been much higher than with large carnivores since the population density of the latter is always much smaller, and in any case cattle were always being deliberately sought out both for hunting and later for domestication while large carnivores were distinctly avoided in the normal course of events, though perhaps hunted through bravado. The almost complete lack of large carnivores in the Palaeolithic cave paintings of Europe (c. 40,000 - 10,000 BP) is significant in this respect. Any wild cattle of whatever genus (Bos, Bubalus or Bison) simply could not avoid playing a leading role in the visionary and dream life of a group of people concerned with hunting (or, later, domesticating) them. What wild cattle would say or do in visions would be of paramount importance to those about to go and hunt or capture them, so much so that a formalization of ritual (and visionary) behaviour - invocations, deliberate engendering of a 47"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"favourable vision, interpretation, offerings and so on - would be a likely religious outcome. Full domestication in fact lessens the importance of visions based on the animals since these are now tame. Their individual behaviour at particular times or places in the future is not something which the herdsman has to worry excessively about. This as a sequence of general observations may or may not be valid as the case may be, and perhaps all that can be said is that this provides an explanation of sorts for the cultic appreciation of wild cattle (or whatever) in terms of a generalized vision adaptable to local ecological conditions and also varyingly theorizable in religious (post-mythic) terms. As such, all this is pure speculation and nothing more. Things do however become more involved when the ancestry of a particular case of religious association between cattle of one type or another and the divine comes under scrutiny; here in the case of the association of the \"buffalo\" (mahisa) and Yama it is necessary to look at the Indian background to cattle worship in more detail. k8"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"iii. Indian backgrounds The background to cattle worship in the Indian subcontinent is particularly complex. At least four members of the genus Bos and one of the genus Bubalus are or were involved in various types of cultic activity, and the resultant complex state of affairs is made still more obscure by uncertainties in the modern taxonomic situation of these genera. Nor do comparative Indic lexigocraphical works, or indeed many of the modern anthropological or archaeological works which touch on the subject do much to shed light on the worship of these animals as specifically identified - though there are plenty of works speaking in terms of generalities such as 'cattle' (Lincoln 1981 : passim) or 'bulls' (Hiltebeitel 1978 and 1980). Certain scholars [21 even seem to have been content to provide meanings such as 'bull', 'cow' or 'buffalo' for various Sanskrit terms without unduly worrying about specifics - an inadmissible procedure if only because humans before Linnaeus did actually concern themselves with taxonomic specifics (much as this might surprise some modern academics [31). Any Indologist would also agree, if only intuitively, that Sanskrit cattle terminology somehow ought to be very accurate indeed. The early history of cattle worship in India, though unclear, has been discussed in various works which together paint a more or less similar picture. The brief summary here is based primarily on the observations of Parpola (1985) and Hiltebeitel (1978 and 1980), both of whom base their views on Harappan materials. There is genberal agreement that a Harappan Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis cult existed, as shown by images excavated at Harappa and other sites, and also by the presence of Water Buffalo cults amongst modern Dravidian groups certain aspects of whose religious life can be seen as a IL9 BIBL.

Certain Indo- Iranian groups prior to the Aryan invasions moved into areas where contact with Indus Valley groups was possible. Notable amongst these Indo-Iranian groups is the one identified with the Hissar III Culture in Bactria. Parpola (1985 : 147) says that the Indo-Iranians of Hissar III worshipped a supreme deity equivalent to Yima, chief deity of their descendants the Kafirs, and possessed a mahisa (=B. bubalis) cult borrowed from the Harappans or a similar Indus valley group. The later Aryans were likewise influenced and borrowed this mahisa (=B. bubalis) cult from their Harappan or Harappan- influenced neighbours (ie. the inhabitants of the IIIrd. level of Tepe Hissar) at an early date prior to their invasion of India. The association of the mahisa with death (shown in later periods by its participation in the non-Aryan cult of Durgä) seems to be sufficient reason for associating this animal with Yama. This interpretation is hampered by one small nominal straightjacket : the equation of Sanskrit mahisa (Tib. ma he) as Yama's associated animal with the Water Buffalo Bubalus bubalis and its domestic derivative B. arnee. Undoubtedly the word mahisa means 'Water Buffalo' and nothing else in Sanskrit, but what has to be decided is not what animal the word mahisa refers to in Indian contexts, but what animal was associated with Yama, a deity whose worship is by no means restricted to India. If this equation is made variable and other cattle can enter the picture, then the fluidity of the zoogeographical and religious situation(s) in early India and Central Asia is easier to take into account. This fluidity is needed simply because neither the Hissar III Culture in Bactria (to where Parpola traces the mahisa/Yama association) nor the Aryans prior to their settlement in India would have been familiar with the Water Buffalo since this animal is distinctly tropical So"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"(as are all the other members of its genus) and incapable of surviving winters in the drier continental climate of the steppes and mountains of Central Asia [4] even if this was warmer and wetter 3000 years ago than it is now (which seems not to have been the case; cf. the palaeo- climatological investigations of Raikes and Dyson 1961). Bearing all this in mind, it seems unlikely that the Aryans simply borrowed an Indus Valley Water Buffalo cult and linked it to their own deity of death and the Underworld, Yama. The two, Yama and mahisa, form a mythic pair, and since it is impossible for the worship of Yama to be a Dravidian/ Indus Valley borrowing (the god exists in various parts of the Indo-European world, notably in early Scandinavia under the name Ymir), the worship of the mahisa must likewise date prior to the Aryan invasion of India. So, given the absence of Water Buffalos from the Aryan homeland (the steppes and hills between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and further West in earlier periods), the most likely (in fact, the only possible) candidate species is the extinct Aurochs (Bos primigenius (=namadicus)) of Europe and West Asia, the wild ancestor of modern domestic cattle [5]. This animal features prominently in the Palaeolithic cave paintings at Lascaux and elsewhere (the earliest examples of which date from c. 40,000 years ago). There is one further aspect. Locating the Aryans in areas where the Aurochs was common also puts them in touch with that other vital animal, the Tarpan (Equus ferus). This even makes it possible to picture the Indo- Iranians as a society familiar with casual riding which hunted the Aurochs (and possibly also the Eurasian Bison or Wisent (Bison bonasus) and Elk (A. alces)). This picture is at odds with the classical view of the Aryans as extreme pastoralists similar to present-day Nilotic pastoral groups (Lincoln 1981). In defence of this view of Indo-Iranians as hunters S%"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"and not pastoralists, it must also be stressed that there is, to my knowledge, no archaeological evidence whatsoever for cattle domestication amongst the Aryans prior to their entry into areas in which they could have come into contact with Indus Valley groups. Amongst the Aryans it is conceivable that the domestication of the Aurochs could have been establishd at some point, but given this lack of archaeological evidence there is no particular reason to assume this as yet. The cattle-raiding spoken of in the Vedas and Avesta and thus reconstructed as common Aryan (Lincoln 1981 : 103) can have taken place in ways which would not require the cattle to have been domesticated (ie. to have had their breeding controlled in such a way as to result in morphological peculiarities). Perhaps what is required above all is. careful archaeological, palaeontological and palaeozoological research covering all the relevant areas - but it seems as if many opportunities available to archaeologists of earlier times have now disappeared. Though the skeletal remains of the Aurochs and its domestic long-horned derivatives are not completely identical (cf. the researches of Bökönyi et al. 1964, summarized in Bökönyi 1988 : 107ff), many archaeological expeditions this century and earlier paid hardly any attention to the animal bones they found and so many opportunities to uncover the zoogeography of ancient times have been lost for ever. Any bones found were usually written off as \"animal bones\" and discarded while at the' same time every tedious scrap of pottery was carefully logged. This lack of information which resulted from ignoring available evidence does not stop scholars assuming the existence of domestication. Not to put too fine a point on it , it is simply astonishing on what little evidence archaeologists have seen fit to proclaim particular prehistoric societies or cultures as \"nomadic\" S2."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"or otherwise familiar with certain domestic animals. For example Ghirshman (1954 : 29) claimed that the Siyalk site in Iran provided evidence for the domestication of cattle at around 7000-8000 BP since 'bones of domesticated oxen and sheep were found in the remains of period V. When Charles Reed examined the original report he found that the evidence for Ghirshman's statements consisted of 'six \"sheep\" (possibly goat) teeth and two [! 1 teeth of Bovini' (1960 : 143). Apart from the lack of any positive proof whatsoever for cattle domestication in Indo-Iranian times, there is one suggestive piece of evidence for the non-domestication of cattle amongst the Aryans prior to Aryan-Harappan contact. It is this : the domestic cattle population of India is primarily composed of Zebu or humped cattle, Bos indicus, and not B. taurus, the domesticated Aurochs. To put it another way, India today is dominated by the species adopted by the Harappans from further West, and not by the Aryan species. This, let me repeat, flies in the face-of the accepted wisdom that the Aryans were a domestic cattle-based society prior to their entry into the valleys of the Indus and Ganges (an assumption which forms the basis for several monograph as, eg. Lincoln 1981). It seems far more likely that the Inlo- Iranians borrowed the domestication process along with the Zebu from early Dravidian groups. In any case, given the lack of any archaeological support at all for Aryan or Indo-Iranian cattle domestication prior to Indus Valley contact (ie. while the Indo-Iranians inhabited the deforesting steppe zones north west of the Pamirs), Occam's Razor still applies and we must expect some kind of evidence if we are to assume nomadism rather than a (less glamorous) hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the Aryans prior to 1500 BC. So, just as the Aryans left the true soma behind them in the hills of the north, they left the Aurochs S14"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"behind them, though, as in the case of soma, they continued to nurse the cult carefully. But far from entering a land free of wild cattle, they entered the very heartland of the group's success and diversity. The composers of the vedas were familiar, as we have seen, with the Zebu, Bos indicus (only the domesticated form and not the wild ancestor which may never have lived in the Indus valley), and this is the animal which is meant when 'cows' are spoken of in an Indian context. They were also familiar with at least two further Indian cattle species, the Gaur and the Gayal. The Gaur (Skt. ag ura) is a huge brown wild forest ox once widespread throughout India, while the Gayal (Skt. ag vaya\") is a smaller blackish-blue version on the same theme now restricted to Assam and Burma. Modern taxonomy subsumes both animals under the name B. gaurus and considers the Gayal (formerly B. frontalis) to be a feral form of the Gaur (cf. Burton and Pearson 1987 : 186). This is unlikely as the Väjasaneyi Samhita (xxii, 48,49) refers both to wild gavayas and wild gauras in the same breath, and there are many other specific references to wild gavayas (listed in Macdonell and Keith (1912 : 222) who very strangely argue that specific references to the wildness of these animals imply that 'they must usually have been tame') [6]. None of the above seemed suitable as substitutes for the Aurochs as that was left behind. The Gaur and the Gayal are both forest dwellers and distinctly short- horned, while the Zebu was exclusively domestic. The long-horned and dark Water Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) seems to have been the best choice, with the substitution encouraged by the presence of a strong Dravidian Water Buffalo cult (see Hiltebeitel 1980 : 189n-190n for a bibliography).

The Aurochs-Buffalo transition in the worship of Yama assumed here for palaeo-zoogeographical reasons during a period of gradual migration was replaced at a later date with a firm Water Buffalo link for Yama, and Vajrabhairava shares this later association. All this still leaves open the question of what prompted the association between Yama and the cattle clan in the first place. For an approach to this question, the figure of Yama needs closer investigation. But before this is undertaken, a summary of similar wild cattle cults worldwide would not be out of place, if only to demonstrate that this revised picture of the early Indo- Iranians is in keeping with religious custom worldwide. 55"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"iv. Ungulate cults worldwide Other wild cattle outside India also seem to have been sacred animals. The increasingly rare Banteng (Bos banten of South-East Asia, and Indonesia west of the Wallace Line has various local cults associated with it, and this is also the animal primarily used for ritual bullfighting in various parts of Indonesia (bull against bull, not bull against man). The Banteng has recently also been invoked in the name of Marxism - the symbol of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) is a red Banteng. The wild Yak (B. grunniens; 'bronR in Tibetan) has its slot in native Tibetan religion and has consequently infiltrated Buddhism as well, ' though not to any great degree. There is however even a Yak-headed form of the tantric protective deity Mahäkäla ('Great Black'; Tib. mgon po). The inhabitants of the Chumbi Valley venerate the ancient pre-Buddhist Yak-headed deity Bdun po raksa'i mgo g. yag, now bound by oath to protect the borders of Buddhist Tibet. There are Yak-headed sa bdag and Yak- headed sri (both categories of local deity; cf. Nebesky- Wojkowitz 1956 : 60,236). The Bon lay mediums of Chumbi, Sikkim and Bhutan (the male dpa' bo and the female bsnyen jo mo) regularly sacrificed black Yaks with white heels until the practice was Buddhicized through the substitution of dough models and butcher's meat (ibid. : 427).

The bon priests ( sg hen) invited from Zhang-zhung to perform the funeral rites of the Tibetan kings who had lost the power to ascend bodily to higher realms after death are reported to have sacrificed Yaks along with sheep and horses during these ceremonies (Lalou 1952).

Negative approaches have discarded the entire basic structure (vision and what appears in vision as true/sacred) in order to postulate an unknowable sacred truth outside - unknowable and outside because no vision or dream can be it. Positive approaches have sought to replace the cluttered structure of our later artefact-ridden visionary and dream life with a highly formalized system which recreates a vision and its corresponding universe in a manner conducive to a particular type of spiritual progress. It is this latter course which tantra has followed. [2] For example Eggeling (1966 : 410) thinks that gaura, gavaya and ugtra all mean 'buffalo' when they presumably mean 'Gaur', 'Gayal' and 'Camel' respectively (the last only in post-Vedic usage). Hiltebeitel distinguishes merely between 'Water Buffalo' and 'Bull' in his otherwise careful and distinctly interesting articles on the interrelationships between Harappan and later Indian religion (1978,1980). The question still remains : bull what? [3] There is no shortage of material on the accuracy of pre-modern taxonomy. Ernst Mayr found in New Guinea that the locals identified and carefully distinguished 136 out of the 137 species he himself identified, confusing only two obscure warblers (1963). Jared Diamond has provided an account of the Papuan Fore tribe's zoological classifications, including a fascinating account of the observations of the tribesmen on birds they had not previously seen in an area new to them (1966). Brent Berlin has written several papers (1973; et al. 1966) on the general principles of native taxonomies, and also a lengthy monograph (et al. 1974) on the plant classification of a Mayan group from Chiapas in S. Mexico, the Tzeltal. [4] The northernmost Pleistocene Bubalus fossils are from Germany and North China, but all such finds date from interglacials. Following the last ice age, the Water Buffalo recolonized Europe as far north as the Carpathian Basin during the Neolithic, which is roughly where the current northernmost limit for active domestic use of the Water Buffalo lies (Bbkbnyi 1988 : 150-155).

The quirky survival of Spanish bullfighting seems to indicate that our victory over the Aurochs - its full domestication and extermination in the wild - was perhaps humanity's greatest victory in its attempts to dominate and enslave the animal kingdom. It seems to be one of the few victories that has to be symbolically reasserted through the tormenting and public slaying of the largest male animals. [6] As a consequence of the modern conflation of the two species, the Gayal is not separately listed on the IUCN or CITES lists of endangered mammals and consequently remains unprotected and vulnerable in its Arunachal Pradesh stronghold. The information given above has been passed on to both organizations. [7] In this discussion of the cult of the primary ungulate sub-Saharan Africa has been avoided. The sheer number of species involved in such cults in Africa makes for a vastly more involved and complex picture than elsewhere.

For Euro-American attitudes and for the extermination of the Plains Bison in the wild (involving a population drop of some fifty million to a sad total of a thousand or so by 1900) see in particular Garretson 1938. The Eurasian Bison (B. bonasus), so prominent in the Palaeolithic cave paintings of Lascaux along with the Aurochs, has likewise been reduced to near-extinction this century. The Caucasian population was exterminated during the Russian Civil War, while the Polish population in the Bialowieza Forest was exterminated during the First World War. This last population was reestablished from captive animals, only for the entire sequence of extermination and repopulation to be repeated during and after the Second World War. [9] One way in which the reindeer demonstrates its sacred nature is by seeking out and enjoying fly-agaric and fly- agaric - impregnated urine. The fact that herbivorous animals may consume plants considered sacred and used for altering consciousness may or may not play a role in their religious or cultic appreciation, but it certainly does play a role in their cultic or religious affiliations with the plant and fungal kingdoms.

Yama In the Vedic age the god Yama was the son of Vivasvat the Sun. He also had a \"twin\" or female equivalent [1] at this time called YamT or Yamunä, and together the two had intercourse (for the first time in the history of life) and begat the first mortals, This act renders Yama mortal (or, looked at differently means that he is mortal), and, again, this also means that Yama is 'the first mortal, the first who went to the nether world' (yo mamära prathamo martyänäm yäh preyäya prathamö lokäm etäm AS 18.3.13). As the first mortal Yama has a specific kind of wisdom, the wisdom of death (and it is with death personified (Mrtyu) that he is identified in the Rg veda, eg. 1.165.4 and elsewhere). In later Epic times Yama's primary role is as ruler of the underworld, a position he holds by virtue of the primacy of his death. Yama is, both in Vedic and Epic times identified with the mahisa which serves as his mount [2]. This simplified account is not without parallels in other Indo-European cultures. Perhaps closest to the Indic materials is that from the Avesta, though this is coloured by the noticeably hostile attitudes of Zoroaster to the implications of the myth (the relevant materials have been presented by Lincoln 1981 : 72 and ff). Among the ancient Scandinavians it was said that the dual being Ymir (the word is cognate to Skt. Yama) was produced from the meeting of heat and cold (originating from lands to the north and south) in the void between known as Ginnungagap. Ymir is the ancestor of both humans and giants, who first emerged from his left armpit and feet 60"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"respectively. But Ymir is also the world itself, since he was slain by the gods Odin, Vili and Ve, taken to Ginnungagap, dismembered and used to make the world. The vault of the sky is his skull, the sea his blood, the earth his flesh, the clouds his hair - and as in the case of Yama it seems his death was the first in this creation. Ymir's primary slayer Odin was a result of the union between a giantess and a man licked into existence from the salted ice by the cow Au6umbla on whose milk Ymir was fed. (The primary source is Snorri's Gylfaginning 4-9 (relying on the Voluspä 3ff); cf. Ellis Davidson 1964 : 27-8). There are still more versions of this myth, but perhaps only the heavily modified Old Irish and Roman versions of the tale can be considered primary. The first of these is preserved as a short section at the end of the epic poem the Cattle Raid of Cooley (the Tin B (SCüailgne; trs. by O'Rahilly 1967 : 270-2) and tells of a conflict of two bulls, one of which (Donn Cüail9ne) kills the other and tosses the remains to the four quarters creating the landscape of Ireland. The echoes of the Indian myth of Yama are equally faint in Livy's account (1.6.3-7.3) of the founder twins of Rome, Romulus and Remus (gemini is again a cognate word to Skt. Yama). Romulus kills Remus and on this possibly sacrificial basis Rome can be founded. The Greek and Russian versions are seemingly secondary (see the discussions in Olerud 1951 and Schaper 1935) - as are of course the Chinese and Near Eastern versions (discussed in Winston 1966 and Hoang-sy-Quy 1969 respectively). The link between the deity of Death and the ruler of the Underworld, Yama and his Aurochs is not particularly clear as the evidence is fragmentary and often late. There are also dangers in supplementing missing pieces of the picture from other related civilizations and assuming that the principles on which 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"the religions of these cultures are based are the same. Also, these ideas on wild cattle have been evolving continuously ever since humans first encountered cattle (in other words, ever since there have been humans), and evolving in a literate context ever since Sumer twelve thousand years ago. Yama is, as explained earlier, associated with death through his twin aspect rather than through his bull aspect since copulation between the twins Yama and Yami creates mortality [3]. Yama is also the first being to die and thus shows the way for those mortal beings who later follow him into death. In this way his \"shamanic\" role is created since death and its small-scale versions (for example sleep and visionary/ mystical experience) are the primary means towards shamanic understanding since the spirit world can only be contacted in these states (or - and it is much the same thing - spirits dwell in these states). How far this \"shamanic\" Yama can be connected with a Harappan proto-Mahisa \"master of animals\" figure as postulated by Hiltebeitel (1980) is uncertain, and perhaps this aspect should be restricted to Harappan and Mesopotamian contexts. There is one further Mesopotamian idea (subsequently taken up everywhere in the civilized world) which must be considered in this connection, and this is astrology. The earliest indisputable Mesopotamian evidence for astrological thinking dates from c. 4400 years ago, though doubtless much had been worked out earlier [4]. The celestial zodiac, the twelve zones into which the ecliptic is divided, appears somewhat later (indisputably from c. 700 BC) and is not merely used on the annual scale (the year divided into 12 zodiacal months) but is also used to mark out periods of 2160 years (cosmic months), each such period being under the influence of one sign of the zodiac (these following each other in the reverse order to what we find in the 62"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"'normal' yearly cycle). Twelve of these 2160 year periods make up a cosmic year of 25,920 years, this being the time it takes for the individual members of the Solar System to return to a position where they are all contained within the same zodiacal constellation. The history of the universe is made up of a sequence of these cyclical cosmic years (represented by a snake swallowing its tail; cf. p. 41 for this image in an entirely different context). It just so happens that the precession of the solar system in more recent human history has marked out, in sequence, the following periods : Gemini (c. 6678-4518 BC), Taurus (4518-2358 BC), Aries (2358-198 BC), Pisces (198 BC-1962 AC) and Aquarius (1962-).. So, at around 4500 BC according to this scheme, there was a cosmic transition from the Twins to the Bull, and this is reflected in a similar ritual and religious transition in ancient civilizations at this period, as at the later transitional periods (2350 BC for Taurus-Aries and so on). We can see this transition particularly clearly in the Egyptian case. Egyptian civilization (the First Dynasty) begins, along with a new calendrical system, at c. 4000 BC with a fully-fledged Bull cult, that of the bull Hapi, better known as Apis. Hapi is associated with Usiri-Osiris, a deity with solar connections, and so also appears with the solar disc between his horns (when he is known as Usirhapi-Serapis). The Amun ram cult officially replaces that of Hapi after two thousand years or so at the time of the accession of the XII. Dynasty and just after the era of the pyramids comes to an end; and this cult in turn comes to an official end with the start of the Ptolemaic era (c. 300 BC) and the gradual rise to power of monotheism in the Near and Middle East (and it is no accident that the early Christians chose the Greek word 'XGQS 'fish/Pisces' to summarize their doctrine). Of course individual bull or ram cults did continue well 6-6"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"after the official cults ended at the astrologically determined time - bulls were still being mummified in the 4th. century AC during the reign of Julian the Apostate [5]. Whether or not these transitions did actually take place in the religious life of a particular prehistoric group at the astrologically predetermined time is impossible to ascertain - and is also irrelevant, since it is enough for later periods to have thought that these transitions must have happened. There is certainly ample time for knowledge of the entire evolutionary sequence of cosmic months to have passed into Central Asia and the Aryans (and/or to the Indus Valley where Mesopotamian influence was considerable). It seems hard to imagine that the association of Yama as Twins and Yama as Bull could have developed entirely independently of this astrological idea, especially as the latter does not conflict with the death and knowledge-of-death associations discussed above (these being the philosophico-religious reflexes of the scheme). The fact that both the Twins and the Bull are bound up in the figure of Yama (and not some other figure) suggests the prominence of the deity amongst the early Aryans - and incidentally backs up Parpola's suggestion that Yama was the leading deity of the Hissar III culture (1985 : 147). All the conclusions of this and preceeding sections are only tentative, and perhaps all that has been shown is how difficult it is to untangle all the various threads of cattle worship and Yama worship, whether these are Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Harappan, Indo-European or Dravidian. One thing is however certain. The situation, both historical and pre-historical, is far more complex than has hitherto been imagined and it is easy to think up dozens of lines along which further research could proceed.

Does the Yama/twins/bull astrological association originate from Mesopotamia via the Indus Valley or did it arrive by some other route? 65"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ii. Dharmaräja So the response to Yama at different historical periods has varied. Just looking at the Indian sources we see Yama first as the primordial being with a strongly shamanic role, while later in the Epics the emphasis is placed increasingly on his role as God of the Hells and Judge of the dead (the role in which he is perhaps best known). But how did Yama come to enter the Buddhist fold? One of the names of Yama which seems to have caused some confusion is Dharmaräja, 'King of Dharma' (Tib. chos kyi rgyal po; Mon. nom-un gayan). The Amarakosa (svarga- varga 53/54a) has this name in its list of the fourteen names of Yama, and it occurs in subsequent lists as well (the twenty-six name list of Dpal 'dzin sde in his lexicon (Sde dge Tenjur, sna tshogs Po 80a. 3ff. )). Wayman comments that this name 'not only refers to Yama's popular role as a judge of merit and demerit, but... could reasonably include his position as guru' (1959 : 57) But why should this primordial being be regarded as a guru by Buddhist tantrics? And why should the three Yama manifestations represented in the standard Dge lugs pa pantheons [6] have been given the name Dharmaraja to the exclusion of all other possible names including the name Yama itself? The Myth Section indirectly clarifies the situation by providing a description of Yama's entry into the Buddhist fold. According to this text Vajrabhairava went to the city of Yama and subdued the deities there. After taking his oath of subjugation/ subjection Yama is called Dharmaraja; when he is 'blessed into the state of liberation', he is addressed by this name. In short Dharmaraja is Yama's name after his conversion to Buddhism by Vajrabhairava; and it is only from this moment onwards that 'Yama' becomes a suitable object for Buddhist tantric worship [7]. This conversion also L16"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"enables Yama to take his place amongst the great protective divinities of Buddhism. He is found as one of the eight wrathful protectors (the drag gshed brgyad) along with (amongst others) Yamäntaka (the`Ender of Yama [8]), the generalized title of the MailjuAri emanation which converted him. The three forms of Dharmargja are known as the Outer, Inner and Secret Forms (see fig. la, and also the detailed descriptions in Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1975 : 82ff). The Outer Form (bähya-sädhana; phyi sgrub) is blue, naked, buffalo-headed, and stands on a mahisa which is crushing - or, in certain representations, copulating with -a corpse. His penis is erect, and his right hand wields a club topped with a skull (thod dbyug) and his left a noose. To his left his twin sister Yami offers him a blood-filled skull-cup with her left hand while holding a trident in her right. The Inner Form (antara-sädhana; nang sgrub) is blue, räksasa-headed and wears a tiger skin. He holds a chopper and a skull-cup and tramples on a corpse. The Secret Form (guhya-sädhana; gsang sgrub) is red, buffalo-headed, naked and tramples on a buffalo. His penis is erect and he holds a jewel (a chopper in the illustration) in his right hand and a skull-cup in his left [9). These three forms may seem to be the unnecessary elaborations of later Tantric exegesis, but they are intended to be understood in terms of various aspects and consequences of death itself. Jaya Pandita quotes the Vimalaprabhä as saying that the three Yamas are : The preta dwelling in the place, the lord of death which is in the body, the defilements (klesa) which are in the mind [to] 67"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ýýý ý; T Výý a). b). zýE -VWR*NK Er%A r ZZ. zxgiý1141; ý ztuo SWRVNrA UkJR ý ^ý ýýý ýýý h ý ýý 1 'ý ýý / ý LL IYF ý //ýrj/iý (ý x/\" I I äQýý\"ý\"r5°'ýwýiýl Fig la).

The Inner Form is personal mortality, the path which Yama was the first to follow - or to put it another way the Inner Form is the Yama who is personal mortality (this being the feature which he personally introduced to sentient beings who are all his descendants - hence Yama's name Pitrpati (Tib. pha gshin bdag), the Lord of the Fathers). The Secret Form is mental defilement, those obscurations (desire, aversion and ignorance) which produce the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death (as opposed to the Inner Form which is itself death and consequent birth, sickness and old age). It is said that each of these Yamas has its own Yamäntaka, and equivalences can be set up as follows : Outer Dharmaräja - Vajrabhairava Inner Dharmaräja - Krsnayamäri Secret Dharmaräja - Raktayamäri To decide whether the situation really is this simple will need analyses of the texts connected with the deities Black Yamäri (Krsnayamäri) and Red Yamäri (Raktayamäri; see fig 2a). Certainly the emphasis in the Vajrabhairava cycle is on the subjugation and conversion of the Outer Dharmaraja, the actual Lord of the Hells. Nonetheless the fact remains that the six-headed, six- armed and six-legged form mentioned in the Ritual Procedure Tantra (pt61) is considered to be a separate canonical form, and this and the other forms of the Ritual Procedure Tantra fit uneasily into the above scheme. 6q"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"iii. Vajrabhairava and his Tantras amongst humans Of Vajrabhairava himself all that need (or can) be said has been said in his tantras - what he looks like, what his yoga can be used for and so on [II]. However, the tantras we have in Tibetan translation (and which are translated in this essay) are said to be merely fragments of a complete tantra in a hundred thousand verses which exists among the däkinis (mkha' 'gro ma) [%2]. The däkinis, beings who can freely pass between the realms of the universe, have guarded the complete tantra of Vajrabhairava ever since it originated as enlightened speech from the dharmakäya appearing as Vajrabhairava for the purpose of converting (binding by oath) the (non- Buddhist) deity Yama. Those fragments we do have are however enough, the däkinis have assured us. It is possible for certain adepts (siddhas) to obtain such teachings and the required initiations from the däkinis. It seems that most often the adept has to actively seek the text for it to be bestowed, and this is what we find in the case of the Vajrabhairava tantras. The Tibetan historian T-aranätha (b. 1575) records the history of the revealer of the Yamäntaka tantras, the acarya Lalitavajra (fig. lb. ). Lalitavajra, a noted pan ita from the monastery of Nälanda whose tutelary deity (Skt. istadevatä) was Manjusrl, noticed a reference to Yamäntaka (as Vajrabhairava) in a tantra connected with Manjusri. This was possibly the Manjusri-müla-kalpa. usually regarded as a very early Buddhist tantra (ie. nearer 500 than 1000AC). In this tantra we read, in a description of the bodhisattva Manjusri : '[Manjusri] is quite splendid, entirely surrounded by a ring of flames, seated in the lotus posture, as he glances at Yam-dntaka, the Lord of Wrath, while facing the , To"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"main entrance of the mandala with a graceful expression. On his right side below the lotus one should draw Yamäntaka, the Lord of Wrath, terrible in appearance, entirely surrounded by a ring of flames, with his gaze fully directed toward the great bodhisattva, on whose command he attends. ' (41 1.20-42 1.3 of the edited text, trs. Snellgrove 1987 : 194; cf. also Macdonald 1962 : 105ff). Lalitavajra performed the practice of Manjusrl for twenty years before receiving a vision of the deity who told him to visit the land of Uddiyäna and retrieve the tantras of Yamäntaka. Uddiyäna (Tib. U rgyan) is often identified with the modern Swat district of Pakistan [13]. Tantra was extensively cultivated in this mountainous region prior to the advance of Islam, and we have evidence for this in the travelogue of the Chinese pilgrim Hsuan-tsang (Beal 1884 : 1.120-1), and it is also from this area that many yogins entered Western Tibet from the 7th. century onwards during the period of the first diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet (notable amongst these yogins is Padmasambhava). Täranätha continues : '[Lalitavajra] went to Uddiyäna and had a contest of magic power with a number of heretical yoginis there. He fell unconscious by their magic stare. Returning to consciousness he prayed to Vajrayoginl. He received the vision of Vajra-vetala who conferred on him the consecration (abhiseka) of the Yamäri-mandala. He then meditated on the completion stage (sampanna-krama) of the four yogas for two and a half months and attained the great siddhi (mahisiddhi). As a mark of this he subdued a wild and violent buffalo, attracted it towards himself and rode on it... he then wanted to take from the Dharma- treasury of Uddiyäna the Yamäri and other tantras for the welfare of all future living beings. The däkinis said 71"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"'you can take as much as you can commit to memory in seven days. ' He prayed to his chosen deity and committed to memory the Tantra of Black Yamäri who is the Body, Speech and Mind of All Tathägatas, the 3 Section, the 7 Section and many other fragmentary dhäran1s and longer kalpa-kramas. He extensively propagated these in Jambudvipa' (translation based on Chattopadhyaya 1980 : 242-3). The lineages as listed for the various texts by Jaya Pandita (Thob vig, glegs bam 4, f. 257v-258r) indicate that the Vajramahabhairava Tantra is the primary text of the cycle transmitted by Jnänadäkinl to Lalitavajra, while the other texts - the Myth Section, the Ritual Procedure Tantra, the 3 Section Tantra and the Musk Shrew Section - according to Jaya Pandita, were directly transmitted from Vajrabhairava to Lalitavajra. In related cycles Lalitavajra is also the revealer of the 18 Chapter Tantra of Black Yamäri, Body Speech and Mind of All Tathagatas, receiving this from Vajradhära via Jfänadäkin3, but in the lineage of the Tantra called the Wheel of the Wrathful Black Yamäri he is shown as receiving the tantra from the yogins Jnänasri and Dipadhiya, while he does not figure at all in the lineage of the 16 section Red Yamäri Tantra. This leaves only the 22 section Red Yamäri Tantra (=9r1mad-raktayam7ari- tantrarnja) concerning which Jaya pandita gives no information as he did not receive the transmission of the text (lung ma thob)). Lalitavajra is also credited with the authorship of several works preserved in the Tenjur (bstan 'gyur) on various aspects of the teachings and practices of the Vajrabhairava and Black Yamäri cycles, including a useful commentary on the Vajramahabhairava Tantra (these works are listed in Bibliography l. ii. along with other Indian works preserved in the Tenjur).

Amongst the Dragon Bka' brgyud and the Rnying ma pas Yamäntaka appears as the Black Poison-faced One (Dug gdong nag po), also called Quicksilver (Khro chu), while the Kar ma bka' brgyud cultivate Yamäntaka in a form known as the Black Master of Life, Tshe bdag nag po (Beyer 1978 : 42-4). Amongst those schools which relied on canonical works 'officially sanctioned' by Bu ston and who therefore cultivated the tantras of Vajrabhairava and the two Yamäris, the Sa skya school was particularly noted for its mastery of Vajrabhairava's cycle (with notable works by 'Phags pa, Ngor Chen kun dga' bzang po, Go ram bsod nams seng ge and others, cf. Bibliography l. iii). It is however amongst the Dge lugs pa that the cycle was most prominent. Vajrabhairava counts as one of the three central Highest Yoga Tantra (anuttara-yoga-tantra) cycles preferentially cultivated by Dge lugs pa yogins (the Tibetan phrase gsang bde 'jigs gsum is used to refer collectively to the three deities in question, ie. Guhyasamäja (Gsang bsdus), Samvara (Bde mchog) and of course Vajrabhairava (Rdo rje 'jigs byed); see fig 2b.! ). It is said that the cultivation of these three tantric cycles amongst the Dge lugs pa derives from the originator of the school Tsang kha pa (1357-1419) who performed the full sädhanas ('evocations') of these three deities as part of his daily practice, and who also performed an extensive retreat on the Vajrabhairava practice in his 55th year (Thurman 1982 : 28). The Dge lugs pa also considered Vajrabhairava to be the special protector of the Anuttara-yoga-täntras while Yama as Dharmargja was pressed into service as the special (thun mong ma yin pa) protector of the Dge lugs pa themselves (cf. Lessing 1942 : 76).

The Vajrabhairava cycle was possibly even more popular amongst the monks and yogins of Mongolia than it was in Tibet. It seems that the few members of the Dge lugs pa pantheons with animal connections were particularly popular in Mongolia, with only the deity Hayagriva (Rta mgrin; \"Horse-necked\") approaching Vajrabhairava in popularity. Perhaps more so than in Tibet, we find the practices of Vajrabhairava widespread amongst the wider populace to whom these were dispensed by proselytizing monks or local princes without the full set of initiations required, much to the dismay of the Dge lugs pa establishment: 'In order to begin the spread of the Buddha's doctrine with benevolent intention, the Tüsiyetü Khan of the Khorcin [Mongols] let it be publicly known : 'I will give a horse to whoever learns by heart the summary of the Doctrine, and a cow to whoever can recite the Yamäntaka dhäraii by heart! ' Thereupon from the moment that they heard this announcement, all the poor and have-nots learnt the prayers according to their intellectual capacity. And since the Khan, as he had announced, gave horses and cows to those who had already learnt the prayers from other people, there were many believers... ' (Heissig 1980 : 36-7; from a biography of the Mongol monk Neici Toin (1557-1653)). Amongst the Mongols it is therefore no surprise to find Vajrabhairava (or Yamäntaka) invoked in spells for various worldly purposes, for example, for adjusting one's gun and making it shoot straight (cf. the Mongolian texts entitled buu-vin tarni (gun-dhärani) and buu-vin sang (gun incense offering); cf. Rinchen 1959 : 38-40). 7$"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Though most Mongol lamas wrote in Classical Tibetan there are a certain number of texts connected with Vajrabhairava which are in Mongolian - though in some cases (for want of a colophon) it is hard to decide whether these are original Mongol works or translations from Tibetan. A short list of Mongol language works on Vajrabhairava is provided in Bibliography lc. There are probably many more such works lying uncatalogued in Mongolian collections and libraries as well as forming part of the individual Mongolian language collected works (gsung 'bum) of learned Mongolian lamas. Vajrabhairava was also one of the most prominent deities evoked by the Manchu-supported Dge lugs pa community in Peking and associated Lamaist centres in China and Manchuria. The deity had a close relationship with the Manchu imperial family on the basis that the phonetic similarity between the words Manjusri and Manchu (the Bodhisattva of wisdom and the wisest nation in the Empire) was no accident. Manjusri came to be considered the special patron of the Manchus (just as Vajrapäni and Avalokitesvara protected Mongols and Tibetans respectively, power and compassion being the characteristics which these nations saw in themselves), hence it is immediately understandable why Vajrabhairava as the wrathful form of Manjusri should have been pressed into Imperial service. The sixth hall of the great Yung- ho-kung (Palace of Harmony4¬. 0t) in Peking was devoted entirely to the evocation of Vajrabhairava and the other forms of Yamffntaka as was an entire temple in Peking (the Yamandaga-yin slime). During Manchu times the city of Peking itself was topographically identified with Vajrabhairava and his mandala as a means of protection (with a famous statue in Pei-hai representing the deity himself, and the Forbidden City, the Imperial City and the Outer City three \"concentric mandalas, cf.

Guntert 1923 : 337. It seems to make little difference but the twin interpretation is preferable. Of Yami we hear very little in a Buddhist tantric context, but in the Vedic context, especially in the context of the avabhrta bath (the vedic sacrificial and expiatory bath) Yami is associated with the river YamunS, bathing in which releases one from Yama's power ensuring rebirth outside Yama's realm. [2] In addition to the mahi a, Yama is also associated with a black barren cow equated with the anustarami cow slaughtered at funeral ceremonies) which in turn has a counterpart in the barren cow offered to Varuiia at the conclusion of the soma sacrifice. There is a definite link between Yama and Varupa, both of whom appear together before the dead in the next world. The sacrificial animal associated with Varuiia is the black ram, and this has a bearing on what was mentioned earlier about the astrological transition from Taurus to Aries (pc). For further details on the Yama-Varuip link see Parpola 1985 : 64ff. [3] In modern genetics death has a similar origin. In organisms which reproduce asexually there is a simple duplicating process (cloning) whereby the organism genetically manufactures identical copies of itself. A colony of such organisms, bacteria for example, is made up not from many individuals but from many copies of the same \"individual\". In organisms which reproduce sexually the procedure involves the alternation of haploid phases (where the nucleus contains a single set of chromosomes) and diploid phases (where the nucleus contains a double set). Sexual reproduction thus involves the union of two haploid cells from two different individuals of two different mating types (called male and female) to produce a single unique organism, composed of diploid cells, which produces, in turn, haploid gametes (sex cells). In the case of simple organisms which reproduce asexually by repeated fission it makes little sense to speak of the \"death\" of individuals since these are all identical copies of the (hypothetical) source organism and can, in a sense, be traced back to it. In this sense at least, colonies of bacteria are \"immortal\" as long as one remains, and, conversely, it is impossible to say how old - how many millenia old - such bacteria are. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the mixing of chromosomes from two parent individuals ensures the uniqueness (and hence individuality) of the offspring - but at the cost of the eventual dissolution of that 78"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"particular individual organism. In short, sex causes death. [4] This earliest datable occurrence is in a description of the favourable astrological conditions for the construction of a temple given by the goddess Nishaba in a dream to Gudea, king of Lagash (K kosy 1978 : 111). [5] This discussion relies primarily on Värkonyi 1972 (176ff), an inventive and original book which will no doubt remain unknown outside Hungary. For more on the complexities of Egyptian bull cults see Leca 1980 : 94ff). [6] In their reproduction of Rol pa'i rdo rje's blockprinted Dge lugs pa pantheon 'the Three Hundred Images', Blanche Olschak and Geshe Wangyal mistakenly call the three Dharmaräjas 'special forms' of Yamäntaka (1973 : 170). [7] So it seems that whenever the name Yama (Gshin rje) appears in Buddhist texts it indicates that the deity is playing his earlier pre-Buddhist epic role. This is borne out by Yama's appearance in a list of divine mounts in the Hevaira-tantra (II. v) alongside Brahms, Indra, Visnu, giva, Kubera, Nairrti and Vemacitrin (Snellgrove 1959 : 112). [8] The name Yamäntaka is perhaps better translated as 'Ender of Yama' rather than 'Slayer of Yama' since, as the Myth Section tells us, Yama merely becomes Dharmaräja through Vajrabhairava's appearance and is not killed in the process. In Tibetan we find both Gshin rje gshed (Slayer of Yama) and Gshin rje mthar byed (Ender of Yama). The Mongolian translation is Erlig-iin daisun 'Enemy of Yama' which also refers to Yamäri. [9] According to Klong rdol bla ma, the Outer and Inner forms have retinues composed of yet more forms. The Outer form has a retinue of eight Yamas and eight Yamis (gshin r je ho brgyad mo br ad or alternatively a retinue twelve ma mo (this alternative is given by Tucci 1949 (II) : 582). The Inner form has a retinue of four Yamas, one each for the activities of calming, increasing, controlling and for fierce activities (Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1975 : 82-3). In addition there are other forms of Yama found in the Rnying ma literature, for which see Nebesky- Wojkowitz, op. cit. 83ff.

The relationship between the two needs investigation, although there seems to be no awareness on either side of the existence of the other's deity. [12] The idea of the complete versions of certain tantras existing amongst the 4äkinls has led scholars to suggest that this implies that the\" tantras were compiled from much larger masses of unsystematic material in existence at the time the tantras were first commited to writing 1000-1500 years ago (cf.

The Canonical Texts The tantric texts preserved in the Kanjur are divided into four categories according to the New (Gsar ma) Tradition of Tibeto-Mongolian scholarship which is based on the Kanjur and Tenjur canonical collections as established by Bu ston in the 14th. century. These four categories are 1. Kriya-tantra (Action Tantra); 2. Cärya- tantra (Performance Tantra); 3. Yoga-tantra; and 4. Anuttara-yoga-tantra (Highest Yoga Tantra). It is only the last two of these categories which involve the self- generation of the practitioner as a deity, and of these two categories it is the Anuttara-yoga-tantra [1] to which the Vajrabhairava-tantras belong. The Anuttara-yoga-tantras can be further classified into male and female types [2]. The main female Anuttara- yoga-tantras are those of Heruka-Cakrasamvara, while the male types are subdivided into tantras using 1. desire; 2. hatred; and 3. ignorance. The primary male Anuttara- yoga-tantra cycle using desire is that of the deity Guhyasamäja (Secret Assembly), while the main cycle using ignorance is that of the deity Vajra Arali (only rarely invoked).

Two lesser texts preserved in the Kanjur also belong to this cycle. These are the Musk Shrew Section (also known as the Te'u lo pa Section) and the Myth Section. All five of these texts are translated here [3]. I. The Vajramahabhairava Tantra The Vajramahabhairava Tantra is regarded as the major text of this cycle. This means, amongst other things, that it is the primary source for the meditational and ritual practice of Vajrabhairava as expressed in a). the independent Indian works of the Tenjur (bibliography. lb); b) independent Tibetan works (bibliography lc) and c). current practice in Tibetan (and Mongolian) monasteries. One reason for its primacy (apart from its length) might be its relative clarity and straightforwardness (particularly when set against the difficult Tibetan verse translation of the Ritual Procedure Tantra and the Three Section Tantra). So clear is this text, in fact, that it makes it impossible to argue for the primacy of ambiguity or obscurity as characterizations of tantric styles of writing, as is sometimes suggested (cf.

The Ritual Procedure Tantra of Vajrabhairava The Ritual Procedure Tantra is a verse text which is loosely structured as a dialogue between Vairocana and Väglsvara ('Lord of Speech'= Manjugho$a). Tibetan verse translations of Sanskrit verse abound in difficulties due to the dropping of particles representing Sanskrit grammatical endings, and mistranslations are always possible when the Sanskrit is not available as in this case. For this reason the prose Mongolian translation has proved useful for providing missing grammar, though there is no guarantee whatsoever that this missing grammar is being supplied \"correctly\" (ie. correctly from the point of view of the (missing) Sanskrit \"original\"). Nonetheless, through using the Mongolian translation it is possible to gain an insight into how the text was interpreted by the Mongol translator Toin corji and the Manchu-sponsored Tibeto-Mongolian Dge lugs pa community of 18th. century Peking. The Ritual Procedure Tantra discusses these topics : lst. Section : Meditation on Method and Wisdom. This section describes the meditative generation of Vajrabhairava (the 'method') and provides miscellaneous philosophically-oriented teachings on emptiness and its relation to deity yoga ('wisdom'). 2nd. Section : Yoga. Various rituals performed by means of magic diagrams, images and substances are described in this section. This is followed by a list of mantras for various purposes. Various forms of Vajrabhairava are then described. 3rd. Section : Drawing the Form. The method of preparing a painting of Vajrabhairava is discussed. 4th. Section : Burnt Offering.

The Myth Section This short text has no Sanskrit title, and the supplied Tibetan title (gtam rgyud) seems to be a later descriptive addition (it means simply 'myth'). The text tells of the initial conversion of Yams to Buddhism by Vajrabhairava, and the way in which Yama and his entourage offered their life-essences in the form of mantric syllables to Vajrabhairava. IV. The Musk Shrew Section This short text, traditionally belonging to the Vajrabhairava cycle, is found in the Urga Kanjur (cf. bibliography 1a), but in other cases it has been relegated to the Tenjur, presumably because there is nothing to indicate that the text includes the standard Highest Yoga Tantra practice of identification with a deity (deity yoga).

A brief examination showed that it is the expected literal \"clone\" translation of the Tibetan. The Three Section Tantra discusses these topics . . Section 1: The ritual of drawing the wheel. Detailed instructions, often obscure, are given for constructing an elaborate magical wheel, and a list of mantras for ritual purposes is provided. Section 2: Turning the pledge-substances into medicine. Instructions which are seemingly impossible to follow are provided for making a magical medicine to be drunk and used as ointment by the practitioner. Section 3: Causes and helpful factors for rituals. Subsidiary instructions are provided for ritual success, including an account of the importance of the master- disciple relationship.

The Commentaries The commentaries preserved in the Tanjur (and listed in Bibliography lb) without exception comment only on the Vajramahabhairava Tantra - and it is probably this text that needs the least exegesis. It is possible that it is precisely the obscurity of many sections in the Ritual Procedure Tantra (and also the Three Section Tantra) which restricted the commentators to working on the Vajramahabhairava Tantra. These commentaries are also not word-by-word analyses of the Vajramahabhairava Tantra - perhaps because of the dire warnings contained in the text (those clarifying the text will go to hell; see the end of Section 7 of the Vmbh., p12s - and hence prove less useful than they might otherwise be. Much useful information on ritual is however provided including details on the evocation of Vajrabhairava which amount to full s7idhanas presented as comments on the term 'yoga'. A selection of observations from the commentaries is given in the notes though many of the commentarial observations would be better placed in an account of the rituals based on these texts as practiced today rather than in an account of the texts themselves. Looking at the commentarial identifications (eg. those explaining the items held in the deity's hands; cf. p139f), it is hard to avoid the conclusion that their primary intention is the 'buddhicizing' of the texts. The frequent warning given by lamas that tantric texts are meant to be read only with the accompaniment of their commentaries stems not from any intrinsic obscurity or ambiguity in the texts but from their essentially non- Buddhist or semi-Buddhist character. This needs spelling out because it is often bluntly stated that the tantras are simply incomprehensible without commentaries. Sangharakahita states : '(the tantras] are more or less unintelligible q0"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"without the traditional commentary. This is not only because the latter may describe in greater detail rituals and yogic exercises, for example, to which the text contains only an allusion as to matters well known, or because it 'translates' the cryptic and frequently symbolic language of the text into its equivalent in the abstract conceptual idiom of standard Mahäyäna philosophy, whether Mädhyamika or Yogäcära. The commentary is important mainly because it helps to complete the framework of metaphysical and spiritual reference within which alone it is possible for the Tantric methods of practice to function' (1985 : 254). This is all very well from a purely Buddhist point of view, and to understand a tantric cycle as functioning today in Tibetan monastic communities in India the commentaries must be used and Sangharakshita's words heeded. This nonetheless does not alter the fact that the tantric yogins of India, Tibet and Mongolia who performed (and, possibly, still perform) the rites as detailed in these texts - with their bodies smeared in cremation ash, seated naked amongst the corpses at midnight - might not have cared much for 'equivalents in the abstract conceptual idiom of standard Mahäyäna philosophy. ' From their point of view the texts are, in the main, self-explanatory, and it was for such yogins that the äkinls provided the texts in the first place. As a requirement for using the texts, a commentary takes in any case a very distinct second place to initiation since it is only the latter which actually enables the yogin to practice the rituals of the cycle.

If detailed explanations are made the mantrin will not attain the attainments'. The commentaries in any case tend to give differing ritual elaborations to the root tantra, and featuring all the variants would serve mainly to overload the notes to the translation without providing a corresponding degree of elucidation. The full understanding of such commentarial variations (and of their manifestation in current ritual) is easiest when the history of the cycle is being concurrently analyzed. In the case of the Vajrabhairava tantras (as well as the related cycles of the Black and Red Yamäris) there are several extensive histories needing careful analysis (those of 'Jam dbyangs bshad pa and Taranätha, to name but two). For these reasons the following criterion has been loosely applied to the selection process for commentarial statements concerning the Vajramahabhairava Tantra: if a comment is not related to an explicit phrase in the tantra, it has been omitted. Hence ritual clarifications are admitted, while ritual elaborations (visualizations not present at all in the tantra) are not. These elaborations are beat studied in the context of the (Buddhist monastic) practice of the texts, along with the related texts on specific rituals as preserved in the Tenjur and elsewhere.

Future Studies A look at the bibliography is enough to make one realize that the translation of the basic tantras preserved in the Kanjur can be no more than a convenient point of entry to the study of the cycle of Vajrabhairava and related cycles. The following immediately suggest themselves as areas for future research : 1. The tantras of the related deities Red Yamäri and Black Yamäri as preserved in the Kanjur (Bibliography la) and the relationships of these texts to each other and to the Vajrabhairava tantras. 2. The Tenjur commentaries of the Vajrabhairava and Yamäri tantras (as primary sources of ritual, and not just as exegesis of the Kanjur tantras themselves). 3.

THE VAJRAMAHABHAIRAVA TANTRA ( 4y) I prostrate to the glorious Vajramahabhairava, the great Lord of Wrath. [i. Section 1: The Man a1a] Now [1] I shall duly explain the accomplishment of Vajrabhairava, by means of which one terrifies and causes fear to gods. Firstly, for this the mantrin should perform all the requirements with regard to suitable and pleasing places. Such places are : cemeteries, riverbanks, solitary trees [2], places with single lingas, valley junctions, mountain peaks, deserted houses, temples of the divine mothers [3], temples of gods, battlefields, cities, forests and marketplaces. In these and other such places should the mantrin be [4]. The yogin who has received the empowerment of this Vajra-Wheel Tantra of Vajramahabhairava accomplishes by means of these rites consecration, summoning, killing, driving away, separating, paralyzing; the sword, the eye- ointment, travelling underground, pills, the alchemical Work, taking the essence, treasure; ghosts, vampires, ghouls, male and female spirits, serpents etc. [5]. For the rites the mantrin first of all anoints his body with the ashes of a cremated corpse and at midnight with dishevelled hair he draws the mad ala [6) in the cemetery or elsewhere while in the yoga of the exalted Buffalo-headed One. The ma ala is square [7] with four Rates [8) (135r) adorned with four tympana [9]. The as"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"bells, silk banners and other ornaments are covered in garlands of flowers. In each corner and in the alcoves by the entrances there are half-moons [101 adorned with vajra-jewels [11]. The wheel drawn in its centre has nine sections and is round. One of the gates is open while the rest are shut. In the centre he draws a corpse, in the East a head, in the South an arm, in the West entrails, in the North two legs; in the eastern corner a skull, in the southern a skull with the hair still attached, in the western a cemetery cloth and in the northern corner a man impaled on a stake. These are the five mudra-symbols within the wheel [12]. Next, the mudras outside the wheel [13] : on the terrace in the East he draws a curved knife, a single- pointed spear, a pestle, a small knife, a single-pointed vajra, an iron goad-hook and so on. On the southern terrace he draws an axe, an arrow, a khatvänga, a staff, a wheel, a vajra-noose and so forth. On the western terrace he draws a vajra, a sword, a knife, a shield, a bow, a bell, a wind-banner and so on. On the northern terrace he draws a threatening hand-gesture, a three- pointed pendant, the hide of an elephant, a vajra hammer, a lance, a hearth and so on. At the four gates and the four corners huge vampire-demons [141 should be drawn. If he wishes for the highest attainments he offers a lamp containing human fat. He offers the flesh of [151 a human, an ass [16], a camel, a dog, a jackal, a buffalo, an elephant, an ox, a gayal, a ram, a deer and a boar. He also offers the flesh of a vulture, an owl, a crow, a hawk, a heron, a duck, a crane, a peacock, a junglefowl, a myna and an eagle [17] (135v). Fully entered into meditative equipoise [181 he performs the ritual deeds of eating, feasting [19], burnt offering and dough offering. He sprinkles blood in all corners of the map ala.

A close friend who has calmed his own ego should anoint him with vairocana [21], or he should do it himself, and then at midnight, naked and with hair dishevelled he sounds his skull-drum and, uttering \"ha ha\" he equalizes in meditation, and, desirous of attainment, he enters the ma ala of Vajrabhairava. He offers delicious drugs and well-flavoured food. Then, in the centre, he visualizes what he wants to attain and above it thinks of the buffalo-faced Vajramahabhairava. Sitting in front of him with the right side drawn in and possessed of divine pride, with mind one-pointed and equalized in meditation, he recites the ten syllable mantra. Then if the great Bhairava [22] should arise, the mantrin should not be afraid. If he becomes afraid demonic interference will occur. If such interference arises he will not attain the attainments. Therefore the mantrin should not be afraid, and if he is not, then the glorious Vajramahabhairava will be pleased. And, pleased, he will ask: \"what do you want? \" To that the knowledge- holder replies : \"Please bestow on me whatever attainment I wish for - the sword, going underground, the eye-ointment, turning into gold, taking the essence\". If he says this, it will doubtless be bestowed. If in the end the mantrin does not attain these, he will certainly attain all the lesser types [23] (1 6_).

Section 2: Acomplishing the Ritual Deeds] Next I shall properly explain the ritual method for the set of ritual activities [24]. The wrathful mantrin should perform the killing, the driving away etc. in due sequence by abiding in the yoga of the glorious Vajramahabhairava. Firstly the mantrin should clear away all evils [25]. This is because he is the Lord of the Yoga [26]. In the yoga tantras, the one in union with the deity should do this since he himself is the Lord of the Yoga. For the rite with regard to this the mantrin who desires to kill should, in union with the Buffalo-headed One, naked, with dishevelled hair and facing south, draw the sixteen- section wheel of Vajramahabhairava on a cemetery cloth in venom [27], blood, salt, black mustard [28], nimba [29] and datum juice [30] using a pen made from a raven [31) feather or from human bone. When he has placed it in between two fires [32] along with the name of the victim of the rite, he surrounds it with the ten syllables and writes eight iit1s. In the corners the syllable PHAT is to be written. Anointing himself with warm butter he places the magical device [33] in . two skulls. When he has placed it above three hearths, he should kindle a fire with cremation wood. Then he tramples it [34) with his left foot and recites the ten syllable mantra. By this means the victim will doubtless die instantly. Or, if he wants the victim to be afflicted by a disease he puts this same wheel in between two human skull-cups, digs a half-cubit down below a hearth, places it there and kindles a fire. If he does this the victim will be stricken with the disease. For this I have explained the preparation of the sixteen section wheel (136v), but its particular feature is that to the thirty-two syllable mantra the ten 18"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"syllable mantra with the name of the victim is added [351. He sprinkles the cemetery cloth with the filthy leftovers of a crow's meal together with the items mentioned previously and with vairocana, and on the cloth draws the wheel according to the rite given earlier. If he hides it in a cemetery, the victim will die. If he hides it beside a single tree the victim will be driven away. If he hides it in a place with a single linga, the victim will be separated. If he hides it in water, the victim will be petrified. If he places it inside a house the victim will be pacified. If he takes it out and washes it the victim will be liberated. Furthermore the practice [36] will be explained. He draws the wheel of Yama on a cemetery cloth using the previous rite. He makes an eight-inch image of the victim from earth from a cemetery, a crossroads, a place with a single tree, an anthill, a riverbank, a place with a single linga, by a royal gate, and from vairocana, vajra water and cremation charcoal. He puts the mantra of the wheel at the heart of that image and stabs that in five places with a dagger [37] made from human bone. He pierces all its joints with sharp thorns. He places it in two skulls, and, out of earth from the seven places and an anthill he makes an image of Yama one cubit in size, baring his teeth, with a huge belly, one head, two arms, holding a knife and a noose, naked and with hair dishevelled. Ile places the two skulls at its heart and, at midday or midnight, hides it in a cemetery or a cremation-site. Ile keeps it facing south for a long time and then turns it face down and hides it. He should go home, enter meditative equipoise and if while in the yoga of the (137r) Buffalo-headed One he recites the ten syllable mantra with the victim's name, the victim will die in three days. If he takes it [38] out and washes it [the victim] will be liberated. ý"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Now the practice of petrifying : on a colt [39] skin he writes the ten syllable mantra in venom and the other substances. Filling that skin with dust from the footprint of the victim and with earth from a place where [the victim] has urinated, he ties it up with [the victim's] hair. Later, he should mix up the urine of an ass with vairocana and fill a clay bowl with it. He places the wheel in it and places it on a cremation fire. He tramples the fire out with his left foot, and, if he recites the ten syllable mantra while in the yoga of Yama the victim will be petrified in a day. This is the practice for those who in the end do not attain magical skills [40]. In great wrath the mantrin should do the practice. Now the practice of separating : drawing the wheel of Yams according to the above rite, he makes a bull and a horse out of earth from the seven places, puts one on top of the other, puts the wheel into their hearts and puts them beside a nimba- tree. Also, he draws the wheel in bull and horse blood - this is the particular feature of this mantra. If he enters meditative equipoise they [41] will be separated in three days. Then, if the mantrin wants to drive someone away, he should make a camel out of earth from the seven places and should then imagine on its back a wind mandala in the shape of a half-moon transformed from the syllable YAM. Above it he imagines the victim, and on his back he imagines the form of Yama holding a staff in his hand. Ile thinks that the victim is beaten with that staff and is led off facing south. If he draws the wheel along with the victim's name according to the rite told of above and places (137v) the wheel at the victim's heart, he will definitely be driven away in seven days. Now the explanation of the practice. At noon [42] he anoints the wrathful one [43] with clarified butter and, after climbing a nimba tree, he places it there and 100"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"scrapes off the butter from the image with an oyster shell and remains there holding it. When he has taken that clarified butter, he takes the banner of the great god [44] and mixes that butter with the soot from the smoke produced while burning it, and smears it on the shoe of the person he wants to drive away. Moreover if he sprinkles it on the arms and legs of that person he will instantly be driven away. Now the explanation of the practice : on a cemetery cloth or on a sheet of birch-bark he draws the wind ma a1a in crow's blood with a crow feather. In the middle of the wind mapdala he adds the name of the victim and binds it to the neck of a ball -eater. Seizing the crow, he who is in union with the Buffalo-headed One faces south and releases it. Instantly he [45] will journey to all lands like the crow. Moreover, concerning driving away : anointing himself with hot clarified butter he takes the nest of a halt-eater [46] from a nimba tree and takes the ashes after burning that nest in a fire made from wood from an ancestral forest. That person on whose head he sprinkles it will be driven away. Also, in the practice of separating, he puts together the wings of a crow and an owl and the hair of a brähmin and a ca ala and kindles a fire of datura wood. Burning these in this smokeless fire he takes the ashes and, if he puts the ashes in between a woman and a man after reciting the ten-syllable mantra, they will instantly be separated. Then, taking a cemetery cloth he writes the victims' names while moistening it with venom and the other substances (138r). Taking a mongoose [47] fur and a snakeskin, he puts these in it and rolls it up. The people in whose house he burns, [48] this will fight amongst themselves. Then, one who wishes to kill makes an image in I % O\\"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"excrement and urine and sprinkles powdered bone on it. At midnight with hair dishevelled and facing South in the yoga of the Buffalo-headed One he chops it up and burns it. The person whose name has been written on it [49] will instantly die. This practice has been spoken of by the great Vajrabhairava himself [50]. Then, he who wants to drive someone away draws the ten syllable mantra in the sixteen section wheel with the person's name on a victory banner using the substances mentioned above and cremation-ash. If he places it in a nimba tree, that person will be driven away. Then, the person who wants to paralyze draws the wheel of Yama on a stone slab or a cloth in orpiment and turmeric with the intended victim's name and places it there [51]. If he does this, that person will be paralyzed. If the mantrin wants to bring someone into his power he puts together earth from an anthill, saffron, bezoar, orpiment and turmeric, and makes an image of the male or female victim sixteen inches high. He draws the wheel of Yama on birch-bark using bezoar [52] and blood from his ring finger, and, on his placing it into the heart of the image, he makes offerings with red flowers three times. If, facing west, he recites the ten syllable mantra, within seven days even Indra will come into his power - not to mention a mere person. Then, if he wants to summon someone, for that he draws the wheel in bezoar and blood from his ring finger on a skull and heats this in an acacia fire. If he recites [the mantra] with the name of the person, that person (138v) will instantly be summoned with the speed of the wind. Then, if the mantrin wants to drive someone insane, he takes datum fruit and, mixing it with human flesh and worm-eaten sawdust, offers it in food or drink. He recites the mantra and that person will instantly go %c2"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"{ insane and then die within seven days. Now, in addition the practice will be explained. He writes the mantra of Yama in venom and the other substances on a cremation cloth and makes an image using human oil [53] and vairocana. At its heart he places the wheel and goes to an ancestral forest. If the yogin, facing South with his body anointed with vairocana, cuts it up with a sharp knife and burns it in a cremation fire using the yoga of arranging [54], that person will quickly die. Now the arising of the practice of separating : if one takes the bones of a crow and an owl [55] and writes the ten syllable mantra with the names of the victims on them using an iron pin, and rubs one against the other while reciting [the mantra] with the names in a solitary place, they will be separated. Then, when he has drawn the wheel of Yama on a sheet of birch-bark with the names of a woman and a man and has put this in the belly of a frog, the limbs of that man and woman will be pierced by weapons if he hides it under the threshold. Now the practice of petrifying a girl : writing the mantra of Yama on a cemetery cloth using venom and the other substances, he makes an image one span in size out of the ashes of a cremated corpse. When he has placed the wheel into its heart he tramples it under his left foot, and if, in union with the Buffalo-headed One, he recites the ten syllable mantra saying \"may such-and-such a girl be petrified\", she will be petrified. (139r) These deeds must not be spoken of to others. If the foolish mantrin should do this he will certainly fall into hell. In order to benefit people who who harm the three jewels, treat the gurus with contempt, do not keep the pledges, do not hold to the mantra, revile the mantra and the tantra and injure sentient beings, the mantrin takes their evil upon himself with a 103"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"compassionate and sympathetic mind. If he does otherwise his pledges will deteriorate and he will go to the great hot hell [56]. I have also explained this in other tantras - one should strive to kill those who revile the masters, slander the mahäyäna and deride the practice and wisdom of mantra and tantra, or alternatively one should remove them from where they are. If the uncompassionate yogin acts violently towards others, such actions will rebound on him. On account of the harm he does to sentient beings for whatever reason this will happen to the yogin.

Section 3: Putting the Mantras Together] Next, what will be explained is the order in which the mantras for the rites are to be put together.

He takes the fifth (139v) of the fifth with the eleventh, the third of the fourth with the thirteenth affixed, the second of the sixth with the fifth vowel, the fifth of the third and then adds the seed syllable of wind with the thirteenth vowel. He takes the first of the sixth, the third of the fourth, then the seed syllable of wind with the thirteenth vowel, the fifth of the fourth with the third vowel and then the seed syllable of fire and the seed syllable of wind just as it is.

Section 4: Visualization] Next the accomplishment [65] of Vajrabhairava will be explained. One should visualize the deity by the prior understanding of the selflessness of all dharmas, so first one makes all dharmas selfless in nature (140v) by reciting the mantra of intrinsic purity [66]. One thinks of the smoke-coloured wind ma ala arisen from the syllable YAM in the middle of space. Above that one visualizes the moon ma ala arisen from the first vowel [67], and above it one thinks of the youthful Majusrl [68] arisen from the syllable DHIH [69]. There [70] one thinks of the sun ma ala [71] arisen from the syllable A. From that sun ma ala lights emanate and invite the tathägatas, bodhisattvas, wisdom- godesses and wrathful ones who reside in the ten directions. One thinks that they come and enter the sun mandala. As a result Manjusri and the tathägatas etc. become one and one thinks of them in the sun man ala [72]. The light which blazes from it illuminates fully for a hundred thousand leagues around. Above it one thinks of a black HUH endowed with five rays of light. From that HUH the lights emanate and are reabsorbed as explained before. One visualizes that from that syllable a great black vajra arises in threatening form [73] endowed with the five rays of light. One thinks that from that vajra minute buddhas, bodhisattvas, wrathful ones and wisdom goddesses seated on solar discs fill the sphere of space like sesame husks and enter the solar disc. By means of these buddhas and so on one brings sentient beings to maturation and places them in the state of enlightenment. One further thinks that these gather together and enter the vajra.

Vajramahabhairava should be drawn standing like this. Around him [131] the great cemeteries are to be drawn. There one should see causers of fear - ogres, field-guardians [132], vampire-demons, the forms of people impaled on the points of lances. One should draw people hanging from the tops of fig trees [133], and also people burning. One should also draw people run through by spears. One should also draw various. birds, vultures, crows, dogs and jackals uttering \"ha ha\". One should also draw practitioners (143r) in the cemeteries single-pointedly looking at the Lord, with hair dishevelled, adorned with the five mudras, holding skull-drums, skulls and khatvängas, adorned with skulls on the tops of their heads and laughing.

Firstly each mantrin goes to a desolate place and undertakes all the ritual deeds of burnt offering at midnight. All the rites are to be performed by one in union with the deity as explained previously. The rites are as follows. If he wants to kill he should mix up human bone, vairocana, ass dung, dog dung, thorns, hair and . fingernails with melted butter. Entering meditative equipoise using the yoga of the Buffalo-headed One, he faces south and, if he burns [those things] a hundred and eight times in a cremation fire [136] with the victim's name, the victim will certainly die within three days. Or alternatively he single-pointedly (143v) makes a triangular hearth [137] and performs the burnt offering in a fierce [138] fire using the items mentioned above. Through this yoga he achieves the ritual deed. Then if he wants to separate [139], he puts together crow, owl and peacock feathers with snake-skin, hair, rice husks, buffalo flesh and horse flesh. If he burns these things in a cemetery fire using the ten-syllable mantra along with the victims' names they will be separated. Or alternatively he kindles a fierce fire with cremation wood and if he burns the items previously mentioned in his own house even one like Vajradhara will be separated. Then, if he wants to drive someone away, he takes crow's flesh and camel dung along with drugs [140] and kindles a fire in cremation wood in the centre of a wind man ala.

Then, if he wants to petrify, he makes a square ma ala with orpiment, turmeric, ochre and bezoar, faces North and visualizes the yoga which accords with the rite [142]. If he performs the burnt offering with the victim's name, the victim will be petrified in seven days. Then, if he wants to cause the abandonment of [143] a city, he kindles a fire in 'nimba; wood and mixes together dog flesh, frog flesh, fowl flesh, camel dung and cat's blood. If, in meditative union with Yama [144], he performs a thousand burnt offerings in the centre of a wind mamdala using the ten syllable mantra with the name of the town, the town will be abandoned. These activities should be performed in full meditative equipoise, or otherwise the mantrin (144r) will bring the rites down on himself. Nor should he let anyone else see. Then, if he wants to petrify a woman he should mix up thorns, venom and mustard with his own blood. If he performs a thousand burnt offerings in the cremation fire saying \"petrify this woman\" and the ten syllable mantra; she will be petrified - no other outcome is possible. Then, if he wants to pacify [145]; he takes butter, honey [146], milk and durva grass [147], and kindles the fire in bälada wood [148]. Then, visualizing what he wants to pacify he sits facing East, and if he performs a thousand and eight burnt offerings at the three times [149], that country will be pacified through this. Then, if he wants to increase, he takes sesame, rice, barley and butter and kindles a fire in udumbara [150] wood.

If he burns these in a fire of rice-chaff that person will attain happiness. Then if, wanting to turn wealth into poverty, he performs a hundred and eight burnt offerings at night in a fire of cottonwood [152] using datura fruit, (that wealth] will indeed become trifling. If he burns myrobalan that wealth will be restored. If he performs a hundred and eight burnt offerings at night in the sixth month with human flesh and drugs in front of the great lord, he will become the ruler of all lands. If he performs a thousand burnt offerings with the flesh of an ox and blood with the name of the victim, then as long as that person lives there is no doubt he will be [the mantrin's] slave. If he performs a hundred and eight burnt offerings at night using dog flesh with vajra water with his self as it (144v) came into being and using the victim's name, that person along with his wealth will come into his power. If, vizualizing at night a king with single pointed concentration, he performs a hundred and eight burnt offerings with horse flesh and vairocana using the mantra of Yamäntaka, within seven days that king and his retinue will come into his power.

Then, if he performs burnt offerings at midnight with a crow's nest and rice husks using the ten syllable mantra along with the victim's name after kindling the fire in datura wood, [the victim] will be driven away within seven days. Then, if the mantrin desirous of bringing someone under his control mixes up sesame, rice and menstrual blood with vajra water and, facing West, burns it in an acacia fire having visualized the red form of the yoga [153] and using the ten syllable mantra with the person's name, that person will come to him and not be parted from him for as long as he lives. Then if, wanting to summon, he performs a hundred and eight burnt offerings in acacia wood with the five -ambrosias and butter using the person's name, that person will instantly come. These activities are to be done by a mantrin who has undertaken the preliminary propitiations. If he does (JOE) otherwise, he will be derided by worldly people.

Section 7: Meditation] Now the rites of meditation [154] will be explained. By the practice of meditation and mantra all purposes are accomplished. For the rites for this, firstly the yogin who is in the yoga of the Buffalo-headed One should do all the activities after purifying himself. He thinks that a fire maanndla arisen from the syllable RAM blazes brightly all round. Above it he visualizes in front of himself the victim who is naked, with dishevelled hair and terrified. Then from his own body many wrathful forms are emanated. He should think that these wrathful ones strike with their knives and drink blood. He thinks that they devour the flesh of the victim and rip out his entrails. At that moment he should say : \"Strike! Strike those who harm the Three Jewels and revile the guru! Kill! Kill them! \" Just by thinking this even a Vajradhara will die in seven days, not to mention a lesser being. Next, the practice of the meditation (145v) : maintaining divine pride by means of the yoga of the Buffalo-faced One all activities will be fulfilled. He thinks of the victim weeping in the centre of a fire maidala, and then he should think of many ogres before him. He should think that these ogres, in various forms and terrible, fiercely devour [the victim's] flesh and drink his blood. Also he thinks that there are various types of birds - vultures, crows and owls, and also jackals and dogs, eating his flesh and drinking his blood. Through the practice of this meditation [the victim] will doubtless die. One undertakes this meditation and even a man who is a hundred leagues away can be seized mentally [155]. The mantrin should be firm in the meditation. Then, if he wants to separate, he thinks of one %\\q"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"victim in the heart of a buffalo and the other victim in the heart of a horse [156]. He thinks that the horse and buffalo fight each other for as long as the horse and buffalo are not reduced to dust. Then he thinks that the two victims hate each other, and merely by this thought those two will certainly fight each other - it cannot be otherwise. Then, if he wants to drive away, he thinks of a camel arisen from the syllable YAM, and he thinks of a half-moon shaped wind ma ala arisen from a YAM on its back. On it he thinks of the victim who is naked, with dishevelled hair and frightened, and, in union with the Buffalo-faced One, he thinks of the form of Yama on [the victim's] back holding a staff in his right hand with his hair dishevelled, and then he makes that camel face South and releases it. He thinks this reciting the mantra of Yama with the victim's name (146r). Just by thinking this the yogin can even drive away a Vajradhara in seven days like this. Or otherwise in the practice of this meditation, he thinks of the naked victim with hair loose on the back of a crow or a vulture. On [the victim's] back he thinks of Yama holding a hammer in his hand and grasping the victim's hair. He thinks of him [Yama] as being commanded by the Buffalo-headed One, as facing South and then as leaving. If he thinks this in single-pointed yoga, [the victim] will be driven away in seven days by that single- pointed yoga. Then, if he wants to summon, he thinks of a wind mandala arisen from the syllable YA11 and above it a moon ma ala arisen from an A and above that the form of Yama holding a hook and a noose in his hands. In the yoga of the Buffalo-headed One, he commands : 'Go, Yama, and quickly summon such-and-such a woman from such-and-such a land! '. When he has exhorted him with these words, he thinks that [Yama] departs in the form of a YAM.

Above it he thinks of the third vowel, and on the petals eight PHATs. Beneath it he should think of the form of a serpent, and he should think that ambrosia drips from a white syllable I on its head. He should think that the ambrosia issues from the eyes of that serpent and (146v) is absorbed into the body of the victim. By means of the practice of this meditation even venom completely filling the three realms is annihilated. One can even eat a thousand doses of venom. Now the practice of the meditation of melting [1581 will be told. He thinks of the victim before him. He thinks of a wind ma ala arisen from the syllable YAM on his two legs. Above those in the secret place he should think of a triangular red fire ma ala blessed with a RAM. Above that at the heart he should think of a square yellow earth ma ala blessed with a LAM. Above that at the forehead he should think of a moon mandala. In its centre he thinks of the syllable PAM facing downwards from which ambrosia trickles. After he has contemplated these things well, he thinks that the fire is kindled by the wind, and that the fire burns the ma ala of the great powerful one. He should think that by the heat of the ma al of the great powerful one the mandala of ambrosia melts. Merely by this practice that woman melts.

He should think that Manju4rf binds the victim's heart and throat [160] and summons him, and then causes him to enter the body of Manju6ri. He should think that the victim is driven insane. He should think of the ten syllable mantra in his heart. Further, (147r) the practitioner who is red in colour should enter these syllables in his wisdom-form. He makes these one with the victim. Through the practice of this meditation even a universal monarch will doubtless come into his power for the rest of his life. The mantrin who is in full meditative equipoise should do this by means of unwavering meditation. Also, he must not give this tantra to anyone. He must not show the mantra either. He must not provide the meditation of the glorious buffalo-headed Vajrabhairava for anyone. He must not speak of it. He must not give details about the mantra.

The word implies a previous setting of the scene for the tantra in some more extensive original version. It is worth remembering that here we have only what Lalitavajra could memorize in a week, not the complete version as it exists among the däkinis (cf. the comments on p. 1Ab.

The names of these göddesses have been given in a general Indian context as Brahma, MaheAvarl, KaumarT, VaisnavI, V9rah3/Indrän3 and Camupda (MMW 807). [4] These places are not arbitrarily chosen, and similar lists are found in other tantras. The (Hindu) Yogini- tantra lists an empty house, a riverbank, a mountain, a crossroads, under a Bel tree, cemetery, lonely place, a §iva-ekalinga, as places suitable for the performance of its skull rite (Banerjee 1988 : 336). These places all seem to be 'intermediate' ones where different realms meet creating a no-man's land where supernatural beings preferentially assemble. European witches' sabbats took place at similar types of location - cemeteries, mountain peaks, under oak trees and at crossroads, for example (Robbins 1959 : 416ff). [5] This list of attainments (siddhi; dngos grub) falls into two groups : a). consecration, summoning, killing driving away, separating and paralyzing; b). the sword, the eye-ointment, travelling underground, the small ball, turning to gold, taking the essence and the treasure.

For ma he (Buffalo), ba lang (here probably Zebu, Bos indices) and ba men (Gayal) see p54. [17] Some of these bird names are very general (lug pa 'owl', chu skya (='heron', not 'crane') and khra 'hawk'), but specific identification can be attempted in some cases (with specific names corresponding to those in Ali and Ripley's standard handbook (1987)). Bya rog (käka is the House Crow Corvus splendens with which most visitors to India will be familiar.

Särasa is the much loved Sarus Crane Grus antigone. Khyim bya \"domestic fowl\" is the nearest Tibetan equivalent of Sanskrit kukkuta or kukkubha, the Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus. This bird still exists in the wild in north and east India, though its domestication probably dates from as early as c. 2500 BC in the Indus Valley from where the domestic fowl found its way to Egypt a thousand years later. Ri skyegs (Skt. sffrika) is the Indian Myna Acridotheres tristis. Khyung chen, the Garuda, is the highest ranking of all birds and chief enemy of the serpents. It is possible that the original model for for the Garuda might have been a member of the extinct Elephant Bird family (Aepyornithiformes) to which Sinbad's Rukh or Roc belonged (Swinton 1975 : 41-2). Others have compared the Garuda to the Phoenix (Van den Broek 1972 : 262,266ff). In this text the kh un Chen is definitely treated as an extant (normal) bird, so interpreting the word as 'eagle' is probably justified (this is a recorded meaning). Eagles in India (including Swat, the region from which this text emerged) are usually the very closely related Steppe and Tawny Eagles, either separated as two species Aquila nipalensis and A. rapax or united in one variable species A. nipalensis).

It is possible that vai-rocana here is related to rocana and go-rocana 'cow bile' (cf. also the comments on bezoar below). Cow-bile is used to make a yellow pigment which can be used for dyeing, painting or marking the tilaka on the forehead (MMW 366). Semen is another possible interpretation, the colour white used to designate it (eg. khams dkar po) being the colour associated with Vairocana, the 'solar' buddha of the centre.

Gnod mdzes is recorded as equivalent to Sanskrit Aiimbha (TSD 2382), which, if not indicating the name of an asura slain by Durgä (MMW 1084), is derived from the root subh/sumbh, recorded as meaning 'prepare oneself' or 'beautify', so these are also possible interpretations. Some versions (A, D) avoid the problem by reading re ship sn as pas sad par bya ste 'each mantrin should kill', which does not suit the context. [26] The 'Lord of the Yoga' here is the deity Vajrabhairava. The mantrin 'clears away all evils' (? =cleanses himself; cf. note 2 above) because he appears as Vajrabhairava, and hence the translation 'the Yoga' is preferred to 'yoga' in general. In the following line this is given as a general principle applying to all 'yoga tantras_' (rnal 'byor gyi rgyud), i. e. to all tantras involving yogic union with the deity. [27] Rather than being a general word for a poison, dduu (vi a in Sanskrit) tends to refer to snake venom.

The tree has an astonishingly wide variety of religious and curative uses and is also the preferred abode of the goddess of smallpox Sitala.

The various members of the genus Datura (the subgroups Stramonium, Dutra. Ceratocaulis and Brugmansia) have been involved in numerous magical and hallucinogenic ritual activities in most warm areas of the globe. Notable centres of such activity (in most cases up to the present) are 1. Mexico; 2. Hispaniola; 3. West Africa; 4. Europe and 5. India, though the group is known almost everywhere. In two of these areas of use, Europe and Mexico, species of Datura are employed for their psychedelic properties and in particular for their ability to confer the power of flight (see Furst 1976 : 134ff. for details on the plant's use in Mesoamerica; and for the power of flight chapters 8 and 9 in Duerr 1985 are indispensable reading). Datura stramonium is a primary ingredient for European witches' brews (Harner 1973 : 128). It is the main ingredient in the zombie potions of Voodoo (vodoun is the currently preferred term) as its popular Haitian name concombre zombi ('zombie cucumber') indicates. Its ability to turn people into zombies is now a well-established fact with one case widely reported in the media (see the report 'Zombies : Do They Exist? ' in the Time Magazine of 17th. October 1983; this was based on the researches of the ethnobotanist Wade Davis who has provided an account (1986) of his travels in Haiti). Both in West Africa and in India, Datura is used in these two separate yet interconnected ways - if the dose is high enough the effects are permanent and insanity the result, if the dose is lower the effects are temporary and pleasant for the user. In India Datura is sacred to §iva and hence used by Siva yogins who consume the seeds (sometimes mixed with bhang, Cannabis sativa; cf. Majupuria and Joshi 1988 : 151). In the tantras discussed in this essay it is used exclusively to cause madness and death (p102). There are in fact very few plants or fungi (or metabolites of these) in use which manage to bridge the gap between producing usable \"psychedelic\" effects and causing lasting mental damage, but Datura is one of these. [311 The Raven Corvus corax (bya rog chen po; kä o) and the House Crow (bya rog; käka appear throughout these texts (more often than not for the use of their feathers and blood) and seems to have a close relationship with Yama, mainly functioning as a messenger between this world and Yama's realm (though I have only hearsay evidence for this).

This is the explanation for the phrase bali-eater' (gtor ma za ba; balibhoia/- bhojana) used in this text to mean 'crow' (p. 101). The association of these intelligent and adaptable birds with death and the afterlife is well attested in Europe as well. The god Odin is also called hrafnagut or 'god of ravens' since he has two ravens perching on his shoulders who report all they see and hear on their travels to him (Turville-Petre 1964 : 57). Odin is also called the 'priest of the raven-sacrifice' (hrafnbots god i) and such names are connected with Odin's roles as master of the hanged and the greatest magician amongst the gods. The Raven also predicted victory since it followed warriors into battle to feed on the corpses of the enemy, and for this reason it appears on battle standards throughout European history and functions as an important heraldic symbol. For such associations we need to look no further than the Tower of London where the presence of Ravens ensures monarchic continuity. [32] 'The fires are syllables RAI' (Sonasri 149v3). [33] A ap ntra ('khrul 'khor), translated as 'magical device' is often a geometric diagram (superficially resembling a man ala) through which certain powers can be activated. There are other types as well, such as cut rock crystal shapes which fulfil the same purpose.

[39] Rte'u lo means 'colt' or 'foal' (when it is equivalent to ki ora), although the occurrence of this word in the (alternative) title of the Chucchundara-kalpa (Musk Shrew Section) led the Mongolian translator to think of it as synonymous with chucchundara and to translate accordingly as kürene 'espece de putois' (Row 2636), ie. a species of Souslik (Citellus sp).

This is interpreted here as *anugrAha 'proficiency in magical skill' (ie. = 'facilitating by incantations' MMW 32, nominal equivalent to anugrahin 'proficient in magical skill' ibid). This is perhaps unjustifiably arbitrary, and the result is somewhat strange, but 'those who do not attain bestowal', involving a less obscure meaning of anugraha, does not lead to a much clearer result.

[50] The temptation to succumb to A's emendation kyis (<kyi) has not been resisted. Reading kyi produces 'I have explained this practice of Vajramahabhairava himself', but it would seem unnecessary to stress this since all the practices detailed in the text are Vajrabhairava's. But, reading kris and translating accordingly results in an implication that the text is being delivered not by Vajrabhairava himself but by some other emanation form (nirmänakäya; sprul sku), most likely Ma'iju4rl who is invoked at the end of each chapter.

Das (1902 : 218) says that there are two basic grades of bezoar according to Tibetan medical theory - the highest is from an elephant and the second from a cow (go-rocana; cf. p. r18n). Lesser forms come from other animals like sheep, goats and so on. Indian medicine also acknowledges a mineral form (bezoar-stone) described as 'a variety of soap-stone occurring in very irregular and angular pieces of light yellow colour' (Nadlearni 1954 : 11,97). In modern medicine the best known forms found in people are trichobezoars, balls of accumulated hair in the digestive tract of those who chew their own hair.

Tatz and Kent also provide a short account of the tortures of this hell.

The editor of A did what comes naturally to any Tibetan speaker and boldly corrected to deli phyi rot 'outside him [=the deity]', which is where the cemeteries are located.

Section 6 [135] The rites of burnt offering are amongst the most fundamental topics discussed in the tantras. Beyer quotes this verse (quoted by Kongtrul but otherwise untraced) : 'In order to accomplish the various functions we shall explain the function of the burnt offering. It is said : in the mouth of Agni the burnt offering is very firm; by the burnt offering are the deities satisfied, and satisfied they grant the magical attainments. Every guarantee of the mantra is fulfilled by the burnt offering' (1979 : 264-5). For further details see Beyer (1979 : 264-75) and Skorupski (1983a), the latter utilizing materials from the Yoga-tantra Sarvadurgatiparisodhana cycle (the main text of which has been translated in Skorupski 1983b). There are also separate works on the fire-offerings of Vajrabhairava preserved in the Tenjur (cf. bibliography lb) which I hope to translate and present in the future. [136] Vajrasiddha comments 'the fire is the three-faced, six-armed black god of fire arisen from a RAJ in the centre of a triangle [=triangular hearth, cf. the illustration in Skorupski 1983a : 412]. In his right hands he holds a rosary and makes the gesture of fearlessness, in his left hands he holds three wands (dbyu gu); with the other two he holds a curved knife. He is adorned with the ornaments of the wrathful ones, has his left legs extended. The seed syllable is in his heart' (162r-162v). [137] There are four basic types of hearth corresponding to the four types of ritual deed (and to the four Vajrabhairavas spoken of by Vajrasiddha, cf. n below). A triangular hearth is used for wrathful rites (killing, separating and driving away). [138] The Mongolian has do'sin-u \\al 'fire of the wrathful ones'. [139] The usual word used in this text for the rite of 'separating' is 'b a db a ba (=bheda < bhid , but here the text has dbral ba <'phral ba) 'separate', 'cut'. There might be some kind of technical distinction between the two.

Both words are connected with the verb mad 'rejoice, be under the influence of a drug, enjoy heavenly bliss' (said of gods, etc). Chang is a much more specific term in Tibetan, and its meaning there ('barley beer') cannot afect the translation. The only available (though unfortunately not neutral) term in English is 'drug', and this has been used throughout the translation. Both 'drink' and 'intoxicant' have entirely different connotations in English to mada/matta and cannot be used. (1411 The left hand is 'negative' in some way in almost all human cultures without exception, and its use in wrathful rites is almost to be expected. For fascinating studies of right- vs. left-handedness and related issues see Needham (ed) 1973. One of the pledges of practitioners of the so-called Mother Tantras is to perform certain tasks with the left hand or leg (Mullin 1988 : 304). [142] Ries su 'brans ba_ is interpreted as anuvartana 'conformity to'. [143] Bskrad (ucchatana), translated as 'driving away' when referring to persons, means 'causing to abandon' when referring to cities (MMW 173), though 'ruination' is also a possible meaning. [144] This and similar rites are effective via the visualization of Yama (and not Vajrabhairava) because Vajrabhairava can then command this Yama to realize the rite. The primordial meeting between the two (described in the Myth Section, pl77) is in this way reenacted in these rites, and it is also for this reason that the name Yama (Gshin rje) is retained at these points rather than being changed to Dharmaräja (Chos rgyal), cf. the comments on p(h. [145] The technical meaning of the rite of pacification is the stopping of rites of others affecting oneself. [146] Honey (or the mead/honey complex) in ancient Indo- European contexts is never just a simple sweet, and is associated with soma in the vedas. Kerenyi thinks that some kind of 'narcotic drink' was prepared from honey for use in Minoan cults (1976 : 56).

These hairs were cast ashore, took root and became durva grass. There are also other such stories. It is used in most Hindu rituals and is considered to bestow immortality. For an immaculate and detailed account of durva grass (and other types) in the Vedas see Gonda 1985. [148] Bälasa is the Palash Tree Butea monosperma, also known as Bastard Teak. This is yet another conspicuously sacred Indian tree. In Hindu tradition sticks from this tree are rubbed together to light sacred fires, and the initial lighting of the cremation pyre is also done with a Palash stick. The sacrificial post is also made of Palash wood. The tree is itself worshipped with seeds of mustard, barley and sesame, and is also the abode of Brähma in Puranic mythology. There are many more such associations listed in Majupuria and Joshi 1988 : 110-12, who also provide a long list of the medicinal uses of this tree. [149] The three times are morning, noon and night. Presumably the mantrin performs one each session until the full complement has been performed. [150] Udumbara is the Cluster Fig Ficus glomerata, also known as the Gular. This tree has numerous medicinal uses and has a distinct place in religious worship (the second day of gravana (July-August) is a traditional date for worship of this tree in Nepal). It is not however considered particularly auspicious as its shadow negates religious virtues and its presence near a home brings sorrow (Majupuria and Joshi 1988 : 165-6).

Section 4: Burnt Offering] Now, this will be explained : the student who has done away with distractions of the mind and who wants to achieve all the activities, when he has renounced avarice and renounced any wavering of his courage, should strive in the ritual activity of burnt offering. (152v) He kneads together vermillion [64], orpiment, ochre, butcher's ashes, soil from a cemetery, human blood and buffalo blood. On a two cubit square mandala he constructs a round one of half a cubit [65]. He adorns this with a crossed vajra. Above that he adds the six signs [66] on the six spokes of the wheel. He makes the fire mandala at the hub one span in size, and anoints it well with buffalo blood. Facing South he himself should, by means of the yoga of the Buffalo-faced, clearly see seed syllables of fire in all the cardinal directions inside the hearth. He visualizes it like the great fire at the end of an aeon. There he should think of the god of fire with three faces, four arms, reviling the wicked.

If it is any other way, such a foolish infant will stupidly bring about the collapse of wisdom. If one who despises mantra and the pledges, who is clearly lazy in meditative concentration, who is of little endeavour and who lacks concern performs the accomplishment even for a thousand aeons the result will not come about; his mind will become tired and troubled. For example, certain feeble-minded infants desirous of a certain result, commit errors. Grain is never produced on beating chaff.

Permanence itself is not valid if it comes to have properties. For example, a mother says to her children \"stay here and I will get ,a lot of fruit and happily give it to you\" - likewise I explain these things in order to lead people away from mistaken worldly views of various sorts [74]. In front of the victorious god of gods one should perpetually offer the highest delicious (153v) foods - drugs, sesame oil and buffalo blood.

Section 1 [1] Sanskrit kalpa (Tib. rtog pa; Mon. onul) is a frequently used term meaning 'that which lays down the ritual and prescribed rules for ceremonial and sacrificial acts' (Apte 1959 : 388). 'Ritual procedure' is the translation used here. [2] 'The Lord of Speech' (Skt. Vägisvara) is Manjughoga. [3] Kaya (zad (byed) 'to exhaust') is used as a technical term in Buddhist texts. In the Mahävastu (1.52.6) we find ayuuhksayäya ca karmaksayäya ca 'in order to exhaust their lives and karmic debts'. To 'exhaust' [the karma of] beings therefore means to liberate them. [4] This tantra is loosely structured as a conversation between these two deities. 'The first' and 'near him' as attributes of the deities seemingly refer to their positions in the discussion (protagonist and deuteragonist). Due to the fragmentary nature of this text the discursive structure periodically breaks down (cf. pn below). [5] Grahas are spirits associated with the planets (graha; g_za'). The 'Lord of Grahas' can be the Sun (*grahapati = *grahagramani), or possibly even the eclipsing planet-demon Rahu. [6] Siva is also known as 'the Lord of the Bhutas' ('byungpo rie = *bhutabhartr(? ), also bhutesvara). [7] 'With burnt relics from an offering-pyre' is the free translation of mchod rten bsreg bred mtha' dang bcas which can also be read as 'with an offering-pyre along with what is burnt in it'. [8] Gzhan du shes par mi 'Ryur te can also be taken to mean 'knowing it otherwise it will not come about'. [9] Rtsub is taken here as a noun meaning 'wild place', though it is possible to interpret it here as an attribute of ngogs. These uncertainties are unavoidable when translating Tibetan verse translations of Sanskrit. The Mongolian avoids the issue with gudu, <-un kijaaar 'at the edge of a well/spring'. [10] Since the emanations (nirmänakäya; sprul sku) of a buddha arise from the non-dual 'dharma aspect' (dharmakäya; chos sku) each buddha can 'penetrate' or enter into any or all emanations since enlightened beings KOS"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"are all one and the same in their dharma aspects (dharmakäya). At this point in the text this process of interpenetration is linked to the 'mirror-like' amädh entered by the bhagavin, mirror-like since all realities or phenomena appear spontaneously and without effort in the mind. Into all these appearances penetration can take place - into the other side of the mirror as it were. [11] The 'goals' or 'purposes' (artha; don) are traditionally thought of as twofold : one's own goal (svärtha; rang don) and that of others (Dr'rtha; zhan don ; cf. TD 196. From here on the speaker is presumably the Lord of Speech Manjughosa. [12] 'Termination' or 'growing faint' (avasäda; yid gsad bed) here seems to mean much the same as kVaya/zad above cf. p%68 n 1) - ie. 'a termination in the worlds will be brought about'. The subject of the sentence is uncertain, however. The Mongolian interprets yirtincü-nügüd-tür sedkil-i Seri ülü u 'will wake up minds in the worlds', so the implication is that it is others that are awakened rather than the practitioner. [13] The hollow channel is the central nädi up which the yogin directs the 'winds' or psychic energy ( räna; rlung). The präna in a non-enlightened human flows through the two channels on each side of the central channel, and it is only with the opening or loosening of the lowest 'channel wheel' or knot (nadicakra; rtsa 'khor) at the perineum and the diversion of the präna usually in the two side channels up through this cakra that the central channel can come into operation. For details of the procedure in step-by-step form see Geshe Kelsang's clear account (1982 17-66), and for a different point of view see Guenther (1963 : 158-74). [14] For this see the comments on pI26n. [15] The uncertainty in this sentence stems from the doubt about the exact meaning of nges par bcun 'truly subdue, truly soften'. The Mongolian translates as Boyar ü es-i er ma ad kina'u 'he investigates with his two features [=eyes? ]'.

[22] Manumali remains unidentified, and no version reads anything else. The Mongolian transliterates similarly, but the word is not in the dictionaries (MMW, THD, Edgerton etc). [23] Yama's direction is South, and this is the direction in which yogins of this tradition face when meditating. South is defined in this case by the direction in which the very bright supergiant star Canopus (ac Carinae) lies when visible in the southern sky from Indian latitudes.

[31] The translation is very uncertain, and hinges upon the way 'am (_ . yam) is taken. To interpret as 'or' (= 'alternatively') needs an negative condition ('or [if he does not] the deity will turn the wheel [against him]') - which is just not there. Taking 'am (=vä) meaning Skt. eva (the emphatic enclitic) is preferable, resulting in a link with the previous lines (the existence of such a link being confirmed by the lack of punctuation in the (prose) Mongolian between this sentence and the previous one). This is no guarantee of a correct translation, however. [321 This line forms a complete sentence in itself, and one is almost constrained to assume that some kind of location is being given for the rite of bringing someone under the mantrin's control (since locations for other rites are given in the preceding lines). There seems no way of obtaining such a meaning given the sgyur ba'o closing off the previous sentence. The instrumental kyis causes further difficulties.

UT and U's reading yang na me la gdung(s) bas 'grub 'even one tormented in fire accomplishes' seems no better than the version decided upon here. It is possible that this entire line has been misplaced (the sandalwood ointment used for rejuvenation can have little to do with tormenting in fire).

P's reading ba dmar is not in the dictionaries, and caused problems for the Mongol translator who decided on the improbable ula ci üni en-ü tosun 'red fox fat' as if reading wa mar mar.

The drop moves down the central channel through the throat, heart and navel cakras to the sex organ, giving rise to the four joys (catvari mudita.; d Ra' ba bzhi), one at each point. At the throat, joy mudita; ga' ba) is experienced, at the heart great joy (pramudita; rab tu dga' ba), at the navel extraordinary joy (vi6egamudita; khyad par gvi dga' ba) and at the sex organ innate joy (sahaiamudita; Than skyes kyi dga' ba). At this point the yogin does not allow the drop to dissipate through the sex organ (as happens in the more limited case of orgasm where the central channel is not used in any case), but instead reverses the flow of the drop and moves it back up the central channel experiencing the four joys of the reverse order, and ending with the return of the drop to the crown cakra and the resultant experience of the innate joy of the reversed order, the highest joy of all. It is taken for granted amongst Buddhist yogins that this practice is at all times undertaken conjointly with meditation on emptiness. Full details on the practice are provided by Geshe Kelsang (1982 : 67-99). [58] This sentence seems misplaced, and there is no obvious place in the text where it could be fitted in.

Then he writes the syllables DHA etc. up to KSA after that [6]. In the inner two enclosures () he arranges the sixteen vowels [7] twice over.

Having taken the moon-sized ones, one made into a ball of light which is in the Arrow house and one adorned with the third vowel which is in the Earth house () counted from [the Arrow house], he offers each one in the North-East quarter [13].

On the basis of these vowels he lists the syllables of the name. On the base of the syllables of the name he sets up the syllables appropriate for bringing about the various activities. For killing, driving away and separating he arranges the syllable PHAT (8r); for subduing, the syllable LAM ; for pacifying, the syllable SVA ; for increasing, the syllable OM ; and for summoning, the syllable JAH. There are rays for these - for pacifying, water; for increase, earth; for control, wind, and for fierce activities, fire. For separating, summoning, driving away it is the same as for control. For subduing it is as for increasing. When he has performed the yoga of summoning, he embarks on the yoga of mixing [14]. Remaining non-dual and possessed of mantra he should make the central ($y) auspicious syllable YA into a sphere of light like the moon.

Even when the sacred instruction has been imparted, the attainment is said to take a long time if the disciple is beset by dualistic thinking. Even if the quintessential teaching is concealed by the guru, the disciple will succeed if, not beset by dualistic thinking, he holds thereby to the so-called quintessential teachings of the guru as precious. For that reason, in order to abandon dualistic thinking (]) it is important for the mantrin to please his guru. His abilities and powers will be great if he dutifully serves him and he will be without obstacles if he recites secretly. His own mind becomes the twofold jewel by his performing great offerings and it is from the twofold jewel that attainment arises. If it becomes hard to acquire he utters praises, and from those praises good qualities arise. If he does not offer praise, it is just as in the case of the wish-fulfilling gem - (18v) the desired treasure is not bestowed on someone who does not utter praises.

These are the fleshes of humans, elephants, oxen, dogs and horses, all of which are äsu (domestic animals) in classical Indian terms. Part =the tantric 'inner offering' involves the offering up of these five animals. [3] 'OM you are the vajra-pledge'. [4] Attempts to sketch this structure were made on several occasions with inconclusive results. The instructions are not really precise enough to enable a definite reconstruction to take place, and the point of this elaborate structure also remains obscure. The inner circle is the city of Yama (the Galava of the Myth Section, cf. p. t77) with sixteen doorless iron dwellings. Outside it there are three 'circumferences' (nemi; mu khyud) with 32 'houses' (khang pa; ) on each. The consonants, in two groupings of 16 and 12, are arranged on the outer 'circumference', and the 16 vowels are arranged on the two inner circumferences twice over. After this, problems multiply (cf. the comments in note 8 below).

[8] The instructions involving these twelve 'signs' (mtshan ma) are as unclear as the nature of the signs themselves. One Tibetan interpretation has been that they are the numbers from 1 to 12 (Doboom Tulku, personal communication). This is possible especially as almost all of the 'signs' do have listed numerical values in the dictionaries (MMW). The main problem is that some of the numerical values assigned when assuming the identity of Iqt"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"the 'signs' with the numbers I to 12 seem wrong. Yon tan ( uoa) 'quality' can be 3 (Sämkhya) or 5 (Vaisesika but not 2. There are 9 'planets' (graha; gzah) in Indian terms (always including Sun and Moon and not 7. 'Fierce' (drag po = rudra) is 11, not 9. There are definitely 15 'lunar days' tshes; tithi) per month, and not 12. In fact apart from 'Moon-eye' (=one), none of these numerical equations fit the usual dictionary ones (assuming our list numbers the 'signs' from one to twelve consecutively). Another possibility is that the 'signs' stand for deities - again the problem is that for some (Moon-eye, Quality, Arrow of Instruction and Lunar Day) there is no eqivalent deity (at least, none known to me). 'The Powerful' (dbang po) is the deity Indra. 'The Auspicious' is Agni. 'Planet' is Rahu. 'Direction' reconstructing Phyogs (pa) as *PakSin 'the Winged') is Siva or G ruda. 'The Fierce' is Rudra. 'The Sun' is also used of Siva, though the deity Vivasvat has independent standing. 'The Membered' (reconstructing Yan lag (pa) as *An iras is used for Agni. [9] Understanding this and the following paragraphs necessitates the clarification not merely of the twelve 'signs' (cf. note above) but also of the precise meaning of the phrase rim (pa) min (pa) which qualifies the 'houses' (khang pa) in which the signs are (or which 'have' the signs can)). It is uncertain what Sanskrit word the Tibetan rim min, literally 'non-order' or 'without order', represents. Lokesh Chandra's Tibetan- Sanskrit Dictionary (1961 : 2270) has the single equivalent paravrtta which is not in the Sanskrit dictionaries (Apte 1959, MMW, Edgerton 1953), unless this is a misspelling for paravrtta 'disappeared, averted from' or parivrtta 'revolving', both of which are unlikely. 'Out of sequence' is a possible interpretation of rim min, but unlikely given the level of detail in the instructions found elsewhere in this chapter. [10] 'As many syllables as are auspicious' is the translation chosen for vi Re bkra shis tsam, though 'just the auspicious syllables' is an equally possible alternative. [11] It is also not easy to understand where in the circle the syllables are to be located. 'In the four directions on the sides of the equatorial line of the circumference of the eastern side' is what the text says; where exactly this might be is obscure. [12] Throughout this section the phrases mig Ri tshad_'as much as an eye' and zla ba' i tshad 'as much as a moon' occur repeatedly as attributes of the selected syllables. Mätra. the usual Sanskrit equivalent of tshad can indicate either a measure of size ('as big as' or of %q5"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"number ('as many as'); the former has been chosen only because a Tibetan translator might have preferred tsam for quantity rather than tshad (cf. note 10 above). Needless to say, 'as many as ' is an equally possible translation (with 'moon'= 1 and 'eye'= 2). Also, it is surely no accident that the two definers of the measure, moon and eye, are the components of the first 'mark' (mtshan ma) in the preceding list. [13] This and the following three paragraphs are possibly even more obscure than the rest of this first chapter. The situation would be much simplified if correcting to mda' can khang a'i [< , Dal nang gnas pa could be justified the... which is inside-the Arrow house' etc. ), but none of the paragraphs have this convenient genitive. This necessitates the assumption that nang gnas pa 'the one inside' is an attribute of the house itself which seems intuitively unlikely. Of course intuition is not a sufficient reason for amending a text at several points against the only available readings. Another possibility is that the Tibetan phrase renders a Sanskrit tat urusa compound where the genitive remains unexpressed. This excuse has been used to justify a translation using genitives, though the possibility of complete misinterpretation, needless to say, remains open. Translating strictly in accordance with the Tibetan text as it stands would result in a translation such as 'from the Ocean house which is inside and has the second vowel and from the reversed Excellence house he takes a moon- sized one and places it in the South-East quadrant accordingly' (taking the second of the four paragraphs, the one easiest to translate in this way).

The Knowledge-holders of the Desire Realm (kämadhatu; ) are familiar with the usual siddhis (cf. p. gs) and are considered to be great masters of tantra. Täranätha tells us that 'shortly after the spread of the Mahäyana doctrine there were a hundred thousand vidyädharas. Most of them, like those of *Urgyan (cf. p. 71) who attained the stage of vidhyädhara, attained it by the help of the anuttara path... they attained rainbow-bodies and left nothing in the form of preaching' (Chattopadyaya (ed. ) 1980 : 151). Knowledge-holders of the Form Realm (Rn adhätu; ) are long-lived beings who can travel freely through all of space. 'They are ... far beyond the enjoyment of the objects of sense... dwelling in the sound of the mantra (cf. note above) without specific visualization they attain a state of pure calm and insight' (Tatz and Kent 1978 : 155).

This process has been followed here. The Kanjurs used [11 for the editing of the various texts are listed below (for information on the presence or otherwise of each text in various Kanjurs see bibliography la) : a). Tibetan translations : I. The Vajramahabhairava Tantra from Kanjurs P. U, S, D and R and from the extra-canonical print A. II. The Ritual Procedure ' Tantra from Kanjurs P, U, S, and D. III. The Myth Section from P, U, S, D and R. IV. The Musk Shrew Section from U and Tenjur P only. V. The Three Section Tantra from the extra-canonical print A and from Kanjur P (in which it is known as the Three Section Tantra of Black Yamäri). b). Mongolian translations : 6. The Mongolian versions of the Vajramahabhairava Tantra, the Ritual Performance Tantra and the Myth Section from P and the manuscript copy C. Though it may seem that it is in this way possible to produce an edition of a Tibetan canonical text which 20'S"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"is the equivalent in terms of quality of those we now possess for the European classics, the entire procedure is fraught with difficulty. I personally doubt if there is in fact much point in the student of such texts collating the various versions for the following reasons. 1. Since these texts are translations criteria of correctness are impossible to establish if, as in the case of the Vajrabhairava cycle, the Sanskrit originals are lost. Even when these Sanskrit 'originals' exist (eg. as in the case of the Sanskrit Hevajra Tantra edited by Snellgrove, 1959), they are in almost all cases much later than the printed Tibetan translations and thus far more prone to corruption through scribal error (and very often require correcting on the basis of -their own Tibetan translations). 2. Nonetheless even if it is assumed that the Tibetan translators understood the tantric texts they were translating correctly (which is by no means certain given a). occasional obscurity and b). the fact that most were written either in some form of Prakrit and later roughly Sanskritized, or in incorrect Sanskrit) there is often little to choose between the alternative readings found in the various Kanjurs. The editor can only choose what seems more 'correct' without any guarantee whatsoever that the 'original' is more closely approached thereby. This does not always work, however. In the case of the Vajramahabhairava Tantra (a. I. ) almost all the alternative readings of blockprint A could be chosen over the Kanjur readings if it was merely criteria of correctness that were being followed. So why can this not be done? Primarily because A shows clear evidence of being a version in which the editor has simply gone through the text, located each difficulty or ambiguity and altered the Tibetan so as to improve the sense or remove an ambiguity. Clearly a great deal of interpretation took place to produce A and the text is %o k"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"thus of no use in establishing the 'original' Tibetan, let alone the Sanskrit. But interpretations of various types are found everywhere in the Kanjur editions (there would be nothing to edit without these continuous interpretations and reintepretations) - so these should be abandoned similarly. We do not of course do this because we trust the Kanjur editors more than we can trust the unknown editor of blockprint A- even though we know no particulars about the competence or otherwise of any of the editors in question since the main criterion of competency would be an (uncorrupt) Sanskrit original. 3. In addition the Tibetan editors of the various Kanjurs themselves attempted to gather together as many Kanjurs as possible to collate for their new version - and we hardly ever know exactly which versions were used. Confusion is thus almost total, and the neatness of the critical apparatus in, say, this essay belies the complexity of the relationship between the Kanjurs used. And it is precisely this complex relationship that needs to be understood if our editing is to be successful. 4. But if one decides to go ahead with the editing of the Kanjur versions, there is a separate problem. Certain crucial Kanjurs are inaccessible or accessible only with the greatest difficulty. For example the Rgyal rtse them spangs ma Kanjur (S), supposedly Bu ston's personal copy (or a copy of it), is preserved in Ulan Bator and shown to scholars only with the greatest of reluctance. This Kanjur shows several unusual readings, some of which are absent from closely-related Kanjurs such as the Stog Palace manuscript R. It seems reasonable to assume that no edition can claim to be complete without reference to this and/or certain other versions (a manuscript closely related to S such as R or the Berlin and Tokyo mss. ). This essay is the first to incorporate readings from the Rgyal rtse them spangs ma Kanjur into the critical apparatus - but hopefully it ? p5"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"will not be the last. 5. Because most work on the history of the Kanjur focuses on the relationships between the various Kanjurs as collections of texts rather than on the relationships between individual texts contained within, strictly speaking no conclusion drawn on the basis of comparative research into the Kanjur editions is necessarily valid for the textual history of individual texts. And it is likely that Kanjur editors knew about any extra-canonical versions which might have been around at the time (it is part of editorial responsibility after all), so this extra-canonical input into the editorial process of canonical texts is always a possibility. The extra- canonical version of the Vajramahabhairava Tantra called here A could easily have been known about by the editors of U (and also the Lhasa Kanjur), for example. Rigour in the editing process loses some of its appeal if entire layers of possibility are left uninvestigated. 6. There is one more point regarding the editing of tantric texts, a point which is all too easy to ignore on account of its seeming frivolity. In model edtitions of normal (=non-tantric) classical texts the editor understandably assumes that an archetypal text did once exist when the author first committed the text to writing. But, even if it were possible to reconstruct the early manuscript history of the Sanskrit originals of any of the tantric texts available to us in Tibetan translation (which it is not since extant Sanskrit manuscripts are very late), we have to remember that, as the tantras themselves tell us, they have archetypes which are not of this world. The complete tantras of Vajrabhairava, Black Yamäri and Red Yamäri exist not here on earth but amongst the däkinis, and this is where the archetype is stored. As the colophon; tells us (p123),, the tantra of Vajrabhairava in a hundred thousand verses is in this sense the archetype, and what we have (and what 21 36"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"has been translated here) is merely what the yogin Lalitavajra managed to memorize (and not copy) in the course of a week. The textual history of these texts is completely different to the history of normal human texts, and the reconstruction of the archetype (the theoretical aim of all editors) is impossible. The 20th. Century editor using available Kanjurs dating from the 16th-20th, centuries is expected to go to a good deal of trouble to reconstruct the 11-12th. century Tibetan translation of a Sanskrit manuscript which itself has an entirely separate history, hundreds of years older originating ultimately from a fragmentary memorized version of a divine version of the text which circulates in higher realms. Of course it is easy simply to disregard the sacred history of these texts and treat them as we treat the European Classics, but even a rationalist editor would have to admit that the texts we possess have been treated as sacred by their Indian, Tibetan and Mongolian editors and preservers. The sacred nature of these texts may not influence the way in which they are treated by their Indo-Tibetan preservers to any great degree, but it remains the case that we rely very heavily on what these Kanjur editors thought about these texts in 'rational' text-critical terms (that is what we are editing). Can the editor simultaneously reject what the practitioners and former editors of such texts considered the most important aspect of the texts' history and not take any account of this when editing? What we are doing if we treat these texts as non-sacred is making an arbitrary distinction between rationally acceptable textual history and irrational myth on the basis of our own preconceived notions of (logico- scientifically based) rationality (\"there are no ddkinis\", etc. ), a distinction which would have been, and still is, utterly false for all practitioners of the cycle of Yamäntaka who, after all, have the däkinis to 1-07"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"thank for the presence of these texts on this world. Despite all this in the editions presented in this essay the editorial procedure has been much as usual. The basic principle of minimal interference with the texts has been followed, and only a very few readings unsupported by the versions available have been suggested. Misspellings are included in the critical apparatus only when meaningful syllables are the result. In the (frequent) cases where there is little to choose between the available readings, I have either chosen-the readings supported by the majority of versions or preferred the readings of the earlier versions (Rgyal rtse them spangs ma in particular). The Mongolian translation was originally prepared from the Tibetan version P (the Peking Kanjur), so the edition provided here diverges slightly from the edited Tibetan text (though it has been checked against the edited Tibetan and readings have been chosen on this basis). It is not usual editorial practice to incorporate readings from direct copies of a text into the critical apparatus, but in this essay a Mongolian manuscript copy (C) of the relevant volume of the Mongolian printed Kanjur has been used to control the readings of the latter. Certain lines ommitted in the Tibetan Peking Kanjur and therefore the Mongolian P are supplied by the copy C. Though the benefit of the doubt has always been given to the Mongolian translation, there are occasions when it has been corrected on the basis of the Tibetan against both Mongolian versions, not a procedure admissible in the case of original (untranslated) texts. The pagination of both Tibetan and Mongolian versions is based on the Peking blockprints (with the exception of the Three Section Tantra) and the punctuation is also taken from this edition with occasional modifications. Bringing out the full implications of what has been said above and linking it to the specific information we ? p8"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"have on the texts and their history is a time-consuming task, and perhaps not one that would lead to spectacular results, but I hope to make the attempt at some point. For the time being, the following brief observations can be made concerning 1) the independent blockprint called here A; 2) the Rgyal rtse them spangs ma Kanjur versions and 3) the Mongolian translations. 1) The independent blockprint A For the interpretation of difficult phrases in the Seven Section Tantra the independent extra-canonical blockprint given the identification mark A (all readings from which are presented in the critical apparatus) is of more use than the commentaries since it provides clearer equivalent phrases which give an indication of how the text was understood by the Dge lugs pa community of Urga in Mongolia. Most of these clarifications seem accurate and useful, though in a few difficult cases the text has been misinterpreted. It is curious that A is often closer to R and S than to D or P. Examples of the alterations in this blockprint are given below : i). Recasting of sentences such as deli dbus su 'dod pa'i dngos grub for the more difficult dngos grub dang dngos grub ma yin pa la (Vmbh. 135v). ii). Technical alterations such as nga rgyal dang ldan pas 'possessed of divine pride' for mnyam par bzhag pas 'meditatively equalized' (Vmbh. 136v). iii). Clarifications such as bsgrub bya deli for the ambiguous deli (Vmbh. 137r). iv). Major alterations of unknown origin such as gzhon nu rnams kha sbub tu byas nas zhabs kyi 'og tu mnan pa 'jigs su rung ba'i thod pas thod byas pa for gnod sbyin 140g"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"la sogs pa za ba (Vmbh. 141r). v).

Vmbh. 142r); or the ge mo added after bu mo in ritual instructions (Vmbh. 143v). vi). Omissions such as that of gshin rje'i sngags kyis (Vmbh. 144r), presumably on the basis that no such mantra is provided elsewhere in the text. vii). Changes in word and sentence order such as at Vmbh. 147r. 2). The Rgyal rtse them spangs ma manuscript S. This attractive and carefully written manuscript Kanjur preserved in the State Library in Ulan Bator could be regarded as no more important than any other ms. Kanjur (eg. Stog Palace, Berlin, London, Taipei or Tokyo) were it not for the rumour that this was the personal copy of the original compiler of the Kanjur Bu ston (or at least a copy of this) [2]. It would be impossible to overstate its importance if it did prove to be Bu ston's personal copy. Until this is demonstrated, no firm conclusions can be reached on the importance of the readings it provides, but for the time being, the following observations can be made [3] : i). There is a strange ommission of a rite for petrifying women at Vmbh. 144r which would indicate that a source independent of this Kanjur (and the closely related ms. R) was used as the basis for the other versions collated here. The blockprint U\" (the editors of whichrelied heavily on S) restores the passage. 'Mo"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"ii). There are several (but by no means many) unique readings (more common in the Ritual Procedure Tantra than in the Vajramahabhairava-tantra) which are more significant than the run-of-the-mill alternatives common in these texts (such as gzhag/bzhag etc. ). Examples are ma he gdong ba' i sbyor ba gsang ba gnas to (sic, no la after gsang ba) for ma he gdong ba'i sbyor bas nga rgyal, la gnas to (Vmbh. 145v); mgo dang mtha' ma gnyis ldan bya for mi yi sa bon gnyis ldan bya (Kp. 147v); kha dang lag pa bshal ba'i sngags so for mchod pa'i'o (Kp. 151r). There is another possibly prudish alteration at Kp. 151r with shes rab mo dang mnyam du sbyor 'united with the Wisdom Woman' replaced by srin po rab tu khros pa 'dra 'like a very wrathful demon'. iii). The majority of the mantras of Section 2 of the Ritual Procedure Tantra (151r) are unique to S (from among the Kanjurs looked at in this essay) and hint at two completely separate traditions for this text. 3). The Mongolian translation (M and the ms. copy C). Though Toin '6orji's translation is generally accurate and shows much evidence of careful thought, there are also certain peculiarities, mostpof which are found in the translation of the Ritual Procedure Tantra (admittedly a difficult text). There is some general confusion between a). nominative and instrumental (yoginis kiged daginis ideyü instead of yoginis kiged daginis-iyar idegdeyü, Vmbh. 185r), and b). accusative and genitive (eg. üküdel tülegsen-i 'ajar-tur ni'uju instead of tülegsen-ü (Vmbh. 172v)). The confusion between cases a) is due primarily to occasional translating of Tibetan ergative constructions using a) instrumentals unnacompanied by passives or b) leaving objects in the 2l\\"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"nominative. This literal translation of ergatives produces a strange construction completely contrary to the principles of Mongolian (and Altaic) grammar and this seems to explain the relative frequency of these cases in the translation. Confusion between cases b) seem mostly scribal (many are corrected in the ms. copy C). There are other cases - M's reading at Vmbh. 184v is dulayan-dur rasiyan-iyar tein bilged gesiigsen-i, and this involves a dative where an instrumental would be correct and an instrumental for a correct genitive. The copy C only corrects the first (duly an-iyar). Some of the words used to translate certain items of tantric vocabulary will come as a surprise to those unfamiliar with this type of Classical Mongolian. For example kisu an 'shell, oyster' is used to translate Tib. nya phyis (= Skt. sukti meaning 'a vessel made from a skull' since the usual meaning in other contexts of the Sanskrit word is 'mother-of-pearl'. The semantic boundaries of the Mongol (and Tibetan) words used are determined by the semantic boundaries of the Sanskrit words they translate and not by those of the word in its native context. This also means that one often searches in vain in the standard Mongolian dictionaries (Lessing 1960; Kowalewski 1844) for these meanings. All such items of vocabulary are included in the Mongolian-Tibetan glossary and are marked with asterisks. There are also several errors of translation. Masi ayu%ýuluuci er-e em-e (Kp. 191v) 'a terrifying man and woman' is found for skyi bung rab tu 'jigs_ 'terrifying clouds', the Mongolian incomprehensibly reading skyes bud which does not fit the context at all (surely a copyist's or blockcutter's error rather than Toin ýorji's). Other examples are yasun 'bone' for Tibetan rus 'lineage' (Kp. 187v) and ula'an bol an uiledcu (Kp. 191r) 'making it red' for dam por drud byas 'making it taut' (ie. reading dmar por not dam por). 2\\4,"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"NOTES [1] The main Kanjur of significance not used is the Narthang blockprint.

It should in particular be stressed that there are numerous Rnying ma works on various forms of Yamäntaka to be found in the Bka' ma (particularly vols. 6-7) and the Rin chen Rter mdzod. Wherever possible, information on numbers of folios, dates of authors etc. is provided, though there are many omissions. Most items included are available in Europe, though doubtless many works of seminal importance to Tibeto-Mongolian traditions have not been included (for example the commentaries of Rwa lo tsha ba and Dpal 'dzin on the Vajramahabhairava tantra, both seemingly unavailable in Europe). In the case of manuscripts or blockprints possibly unavailable in modern - reprints, library information has been provided (cf. abbreviations list). Authors and works are listed in strict Tibetan and Mongolian alphabetical order (taking into account preliminary titles such as jrj/dpal). Reconstructed titles are placed in square brackets, as are equivalent author names, and Chinese titles read from left to right (these read right to left in the blockprints)."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"a).

APPENDIX THE CONCISE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO RECITE THE COLLECTED TANTRAS. 'I and all other beings distributed throughout space go for refuge to the guru and the three jewels. I shall rapidly attain the state of bodhivajra and I shall establish all beings in the state of divine union. I myself as Akgobhyavajra, the colour of space, three- headed, six- armed and united with the consort, invite all the conquerors and the assembled deities to become present in front of me. I make obeisance with reverence and worship them with oceans of cloud-offerings. On my supplication with a reverent, single-pointed mind may they bless me so that I may duly understand the meaning of the tantra and so that the twofold auspicious path may become clear. ' Saying this, read the tantra, and then conclude : 'May the guru adorned with all the marks of perfection demonstrate the meaning of the tantra to this good receptacle of pure requirements for human birth and of lineage-succession by the power of the accumulation of white virtues.

May I attain the state of Vajradhara by means of the twofold yoga of maturation and liberation.
