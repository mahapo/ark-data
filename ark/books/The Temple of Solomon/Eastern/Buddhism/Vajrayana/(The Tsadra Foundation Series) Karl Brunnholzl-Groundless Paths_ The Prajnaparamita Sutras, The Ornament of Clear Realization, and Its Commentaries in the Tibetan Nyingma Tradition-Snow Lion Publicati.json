The bulk of the present book consists of translations of texts by Dza Patrol Orgyen Jigme ChOkyi Wangpo3 (1808-1887). His main works on the AA are The General Topics of the Abhisamayalalpkara (PSD) and A Word Commentary on the Abhisamayalatpkara (PBG). However, except for a concluding verse at the end of each of the eight chapters in PSD and a few words inserted here and there, PSD and PBG consist in their entirety of literal or abridged pas­sages from Tsongkhapa's (1357-1419) commentary on the AA, called Golden Garland of Excellent Explanations (LSSP). Thus, PSD and PBG cannot be considered as autonomous commentarial works, but they represent skillfully arranged excerpts from Tsongkhapa's text (for details, see below). To greater or lesser extents, LSSP also informs four of Patrol Rinpoche's five other works related to the AA, three of which are translated here (see Appendices I-III). They are A Concise Enumeration of the Paths and Bhumis of Bodhisattvas; A General Topic of the Ornament of Prajftaparamita, [Called] \"Its Brief Progressive Stages of Meditation, An Excellent Explanation of the Scriptural Tradition\"; and A Specific Explanation of the Manner of Gradually Progressing through the Five Paths and the Manner of Attaining the Qualities of the Ten Bhumis.4 To briefly describe each one of these three texts, the first one gives a short systematic overview of the five paths and the ten bhfimis of the mahayana. It defines each one of these paths and matches them with the seven sets of the thirty-seven dharmas concordant with enlightenment. It also explains the names of the ten bhfimis and correlates them with the paramitas to be perfected on the respective bhfimis, the obscurations to be purified through them, and the manners of rebirth of the bodhisattvas who dwell on them. The second work represents the most independent composition on the AA by Patrol Rinpoche, with its colophon saying:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 Groundless Paths There is a little bit in this [composition] that is not explained in other commentaries, But I wrote it down by thinking that it is taught implicitly In the excellent explications of many learned ones And by examining it in perfect accordance with the other dharmas of Maitreya. Though the title of this text (Progressive Stages of Meditation) seems to suggest instructions on how to actually use the AA for meditation, it contains no such instructions. Rather, it presents the eight topics within the two frameworks of (1) the fundamental motivation of the mahayana (bodhicitta) and (2) its appli­cation on the path as well as in terms of the triad of ground, path, and fruition. (1) In terms of motivation (or the ground), in due order, the knowledge of all aspects, the knowledge of the path, and the knowledge of entities are uniquely matched with the aspiring, the applied, and the ultimate bodhicitta, respectively. When bodhisattvas take the three knowledges as the objects of generating bodhicitta in this way and ascertain them through studying and reflecting, their order consists of the aspiration for the knowledge of all aspects as the final fruition, the training in the paths of all three yanas for the sake of all beings with different dispositions, and said training not going astray into inferior paths through realizing the true reality of all entities. However, when actually practicing the three knowledges, the order of their arising in the mind streams of these bodhisattvas is said to be the reverse. Ultimately, the actual practice through which they familiarize with the true reality of prajfiaparamita is said to be solely the essential point of nonclinging, which naturally results in the unbiased appreciation of all dharma traditions. (2) In terms of the application of the motivation of bodhicitta (or the path), among the four trainings, the complete training in all aspects and the serial training are said to represent the meditative equipoises and the subsequent attainments, respectively, of the actual meditation training of bodhisattvas. Through them, they familiarize with all aspects of the three knowledges sepa­rately or by combining them, respectively, with the culminating training and the instantaneous training constituting the respective peaks of the former two trainings. In addition, the text addresses a number of wrong ideas about the rela­tionship between the realization of emptiness and vast bodhisattva conduct, explaining how the latter, and not the former, represents the main characteris­tic and goal of the mahayana. This means that the realization of emptiness is merely the preliminary, or the cause, for vast enlightened activity. Therefore, in terms of the fruition, the dharmakaya with its enlightened activity is said to be exactly what is to be strived for through the initial motivation of the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 23 aspiring bodhicitta. In other words, from the very start of the mahayana path, true bodhicitta and thus its resulting objective and the practice to achieve this objective are not oriented toward buddhahood per se as representing merely one's own welfare, but toward the all-encompassing altruistic activity for the welfare of all beings until saipsara is emptied. The text also displays Patrul Rinpoche's typical \"Rime\" (nonsectarian) flavor, repeatedly stating that one should appreciate all dharma traditions, while avoiding disputes out of biased attachment to one's own position and aversion toward those of others. The third text represents Shichen Tulku's5 notes of Patrul Rinpoche's expla­nations on Jigme Lingpa's (1729-1798) Treasury of Qualities.6 Compared to the Concise Enumeration of the Paths and Bhumis of Bodhisattvas, it pro­vides a much more detailed presentation of the five paths, the ten bhO.mis, and buddhahood. The five paths are discussed in terms of their psychophysi­cal supports, natures, divisions (the thirty-seven dharmas concordant with enlightenment), meanings of the terms, and levels, with reference to some of the differences between these paths in the systems of the hinayana and the mahayana. The ten bh'iimis are presented by way of their predominant features, qualities on the level of seeming reality, manners of taking rebirth, remedial realizations, antagonistic factors to be relinquished, the signs of having attained the bh'iimis, the features of their fruitions, and their herme­neutical etymologies. Finally, the text concludes with an explanation of the twenty-one uncontaminated qualities of buddhahood. The relationship of PSD and PBG with Tsongkhapa's LSSP In the introduction to his LSSP, Tsongkhapa states that he will explain the AA through primarily following both Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra, while also adopting certain \"good parts\" from other commentaries. Thus, though perusing almost all Indian commentaries on the AA, LSSP is mainly based on Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti and Haribhadra's Vivrti and Aloka (often engaging in lengthy justifications of the positions of these two masters versus those of other Indian commentators such as Ratnakarasanti and Abhayakaragupta). Surprisingly often, LSSP also refers to the two Brhaffikas7 (even more sur­prisingly, and contrary to most other Tibetan commentators, LSSP suggests repeatedly that the Satasahasrikapancavi'f1satisahasrik�tada5asahasrika­prajnaparamitabrhattika is not a \"Mind-Only\" text). In terms of Tibetan commentaries, as is well known, LSSP greatly relies on the exegetical templates found in the commentaries by Nyalshig Jambel Dorje8 (c. 1160-1220), Buton Rinchen Drub9 (1290-1364), and Nyaon Kunga"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 Groundless Paths Bal10 (1345-1439; a disciple of both Buton and Dolpopa). However, as is often the case in the Tibetan tradition, Tsongkhapa does not acknowledge these Tibetan scriptural sources.11 By contrast, he often refers explicitly to Ngog Lotsawa (usually calling him \"the great being\"). According to the colophon of LSSP, it is based on the oral teachings that Tsongkhapa received from the two Sakya masters Tondrub Rinchen12 (1309-1385) and Rendawa Shonnu Lodro. Ts ongkhapa also received extensive instructions on the AA and its commen­taries from Nyaon Kunga Bal and at Nyetang Dewachen13 Monastery (based on a commentary written by Jamkya Namka Bal, 14 one of Nyalshig's nine major students, who were among the key persons to transmit the teachings on the AA during the thirteenth century in Tibet). As Sparham puts it, the LSSP is \"looking through the Buton and Nyaon commentaries, as it were, at the earlier Tibetan and Indian commentarial tradition. \"15 Throughout, LSSP exhibits a very thorough twofold commentarial struc­ture of treating each one of the seventy points of the AA through usually starting with (1) presenting the pertinent general topic and then (2) explain­ing the verses of the AA proper through a three-tier format. Said format consists of (2a) the Vivrti's introductory passage for a given section followed by (2b) a word-for-word commentary on the A& verses (usually based on Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti or direcly on the prajfiaparamita sutras) and (2c) a subcommentary on Haribhadra's Vivrti (often based on the latter's Aloka). For the most part, PSD consists of materials under (1) and PBG, of materi­als under (2b), but both PSD and PBG also include passages from (2c). Also, there is a certain degree of overlap between the contents of PSD and PBG and the headings in the latter are almost always identical to those in the former (though PBG omits some of them). Somewhat surprisingly, LSSP (and thus the corresponding sections of PBG) often omit more or less extensive pas­sages of the actual text of the AA and, in some of these cases, replace certain words of the AA by synonyms or glosses. Thus, neither LSSP nor PBG can be considered as word-by-word commentaries in the strict sense.16 Compared to the size of LSSP in terms of page numbers, PSD and PBG make up thirty-one and eleven percent, respectively. However, without the above-mentioned duplications of parts of PSD in PBG, the actual contents of these two texts together total only thirty-nine percent of LSSP."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 25 Topic/Chapter LSSP PSD/PBG Percent Intro. and knowledge of all aspects 69317 186/59 25/9 Knowledge of the path 152 41/17 25/11 Knowledge of entities 60 21/9 35/15 Complete training in all aspects 332 100/43 30/13 Culminating training 149 56/21 37/14 Serial training 9 4/1 44/11 Instantaneous training 9 3/3 33/33 Dharmakaya 101 48/21 47/21 Total pages 1494 461/164 31/11 Total contents 1494 461/127 31/8 PSD often abbreviates and/or omits large parts of LSSP's detailed general topics and supplementary issues. In particular, it leaves out many quotations, most of LSSP's discussions of positions that are controversial between differ­ent masters, and all of the latter's polemics against other masters, schools, and earlier Tibetan commentators on the AA (probably an expression of Patrul Rinpoche's well-known nonsectarian attitude). There are also significant omis­sions in terms of Madhyamaka versus Mere Mentalists in the section on the disposition (the dharmadhatu) and in the explanation of emptiness accord­ing to the Vijfianavadins (in the section on the equipment of wisdom), which could suggest Patrul Rinpoche's tacit disagreement with LSSP's treatment of Yogacara in these contexts.18 Also, PSD often rearranges and/or switches some of the headings and contents of LSSP to other places in its presentation. As for PSD and PBG consisting almost exclusively of excerpts from LSSP, certain circles within the Nyingma School (such as the major monastic col­leges at the Dzogchen and Namdrol Ling monasteries) hold that LSSP was actually composed by Longchen Rabjampa (1308-1363) and later became presented under Tsongkhapa's name. However, others, such as the contempo­rary great Nyingma scholar and Dzogchen master Alak Zenkar Rinpoche, 19 do not agree with this.20 The late Dzogchen Khenpo Tubten Tsondrii Piintso's21 (1920-1979} SN says: There is an oral tradition of the great Dzogchen Khenpos that says the following. The Dharma Lord, Patrul Rinpoche, composed his General Topics, Word Commentary, and Progressive Stages of Meditation of prajfiaparamita in accordance with the commentary of the great"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 Groundless Paths Venerable Tsongkhapa, the Golden Garland. That these three are based on said commentary of Venerable Tsongkhapa [means noth­ing but that they] represent the pure assertions of the followers of the early translations because [the Golden Garland] is [actually] the prajfiaparamita commentary by the Omniscient Longchenpa.22 Thus, to this day, certain Nyingma teachers consider Patrol Rinpoche's texts on the AA simply as the authentic continuation of their school's indig­enous commentarial tradition on this text. According to them, it is justified for Patrol Rinpoche to use extensive passages of LSSP in his PSD and PBG without mentioning Ts ongkhapa's name since the latter has only copied Longchenpa and Patrol Rinpoche just gives back to the Nyingmapas what is rightfully theirs anyway. Haas reports further ramifications of this position: Renowned contemporary mKhan pos such as mKhan po rNam grol and mKhan po Padma Shes rab of the rNying rna monastery rNam grol gling teach that Longchenpa has composed a commentary on the Abhisamayalarrzkara called Rin chen them skas Uewel Staircase), which is referred to by him in his other scriptures, such as the Yid bzhin mdzod, but is not preserved.23 The rNying rna pa scholars refer to the circumstance that many of Klong chen pa's works are lost and that one therefore can at least not exclude the possibility that dPal sprol composed his commentaries according to the model of Klong chen pa's Abhisamayalarrzkara commentary. This assump­tion can neither be proven nor refuted. However, one can take it for granted that both Tsong kha pa and dPal sprol would have referred to Klong chen pa at least sometimes if they had known such a com­mentary. Since there are no indications for that, such assumptions seem to be rather signs of hurt rNying rna pride. mKhan po Padma Shes rab holds the opinion that dPal sprol composed sPyi don and 'Bru grel for the rDza Ser shul dGon pa, a monastery that combined dGe lugs pa and rNying rna tradi­tions and in which dPal sprol is said to have taught frequently. 24 Indeed, several sources confirm that the throne holder Lha rams pa'i dGe bshes Thub bstan rGyal mtshan was a student of dPal sprol. 25 However, concrete indications that dPal sprul taught him the Abhisamayalarrzkdra could not be found.26 One could add here that it is not only Tsongkhapa and Patrul Rinpoche who neither mention nor quote a commentary on the AA by Longchenpa, but none of the existing Nyingma commentaries does so either (nor do any of the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction 27 Kagyii, Sakya, or Gelug commentaries that I have consulted). Furthermore, the title of the lost AA commentary that is listed in Longchenpa's own index of his compositions-A Clear Analysis of the Main Body of the Ornament of Clear Realization-dearly suggests that it only deals with the \"main body\" of the AA, which all commentaries explicitly identify as just the overview of the eight topics of the AA in its verses 1.3-17. Thus, it is hardly conceivable that the size of this commentary would come anywhere near the massive size and the detail of LSSP, which comments on the entirety of the AA and contains many extensive discussions of different positions and supplementary topics. Of course, the same in terms of size and detail with regard to the AA goes for Longchenpa's above-mentioned Jewel Staircase since his own index explicitly describes it as a general work on all five Maitreya texts and not as a specific commentary on the AA alone. Last, but not least, the overall style and format of LSSP seems more typical for Tsongkhapa than for Longchenpa, such as the emphasis on applying correct reasoning, the numerous lengthy discussions of controversial positions between different masters and schools, the frequent polemics against other masters and schools, and repeated praises of his own explanations as being superior to others. In sum, according to the contem­porary Nyingma master Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, within the Nyingma tradition there is no dispute about Longchenpa having written a commentary on the AA, but there is dispute as to whether it is identical to LSSP.27 In any case, no matter who the true author of LSSP is, as mentioned above, there is no doubt that this text greatly relies on many exegetical templates for the AA that were in place before both Longchenpa and Tsongkhapa and did definitely not originate in either the Nyingma or the Gelug traditions. In that vein, the above argument by some Nyingmapas that LSSP belongs to their tra­dition since it was composed by Longchenpa could equally be applied to LSSP's demonstrable great reliance on Nyalshig, Buton, and Nyaon by saying, \"Give back the Kadampas, Sakyas, and Jonangpas what is theirs.\" In addition, given the chronological order of these five masters, if LSSP were by Longchenpa, it would follow that not only Tsongkhapa copied Longchenpa, but that both Nyaon and Buton did so too (or that Longchenpa copied Buton), and also that Longchenpa copied from Nyalshig. However, no such allegations were ever raised by anybody within or outside of the Nyingma School. Last but not least, there is no obvious reason to distrust Tsongkhapa's colophon to his LSSP saying that he based his text on the oral instructions from the two Sakya masters Tondrub Rinchen and Rendawa, who are well-known as two of his primary early teachers. As for PSD and PBG, it is definitely striking that both lack any introduc­tory verses of paying homage and committing to compose the text as well as a colophon stating the authorship and the circumstances of the composition,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Groundless Paths which are so customary in the tradition of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist treatises. Instead, both works start immediately with the first headings of the tex­tual layout that Patrul Rinpoche took over from LSSP.28 The only two other AA-related materials composed by him that begin with an homage and end with a colophon explicitly stating Patrul Rinpoche's authorship are his Concise Enumeration of the Paths and Bhumis of Bodhisattvas and Brief Progressive Stages of Meditation. In the colophon of the latter text, Patrul Rinpoche even names Tsongkhapa as his main source, whereas he does not do so in any of his other AA works. In sum, Patrul Rinpoche clearly does not sign as the author of either PSD or PBG.29 This makes it very unlikely that he himself consid­ered or claimed these two texts as being his own commentaries, though it is attested by his followers that he used them when teaching on the AA. In general, Patrul Rinpoche is well known for having composed texts and compilations of scriptural materials for his own studies and as aids for his students. However, he obviously did not plan to actually publish all of these works (many of them were only published after his death by his followers.). This seems to be one of the reasons why his collected works contain a number of commentaries and texts without the customary introductory verses and a colophon. Thus, in the case of PSD and PBG, the most likely reason for their lack of explicit authorship, introductory verses, and colophon is that Patrul Rinpoche did not regard them as independent commentaries of his own. It rather seems that he composed these texts to present the major themes of the very voluminous LSSP in a more accessible form in order to facilitate a synap­tical study of the topics of the AA proper. This is supported by PSD and PBG consistently omitting LSSP's numerous quotations, its extensive discussions of controversial points between different masters and schools, and all of its polemics against other masters and schools. In sum, though PSD and PBG consist almost entirely of excerpts from LSSP, they nevertheless possess great value from their own side as commentarial works on the AA. For Patrul Rinpoche consistently adheres to the principle of specifically selecting and skillfully combining essential passages from LSSP that are focused on unadorned information rather than on disputes, polem­ics, and lengthy scriptural sources. PSD and PBG also exhibit a significant amount of creatively rearranging and newly blending distinct passages from LSSP. Through all of this, Patrul Rinpoche's two texts assume a character of their own that clearly distinguishes them from LSSP in terms of style, for­mat, stringency, and accessibility. By virtue of these features and their relative brevity, Patrul Rinpoche's two texts represent convenient tools to elucidate the main themes of a complex work like the AA in a concise and yet comprehen­sive manner.30"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction 29 Other Nyingma works on the AA In addition to these works by Patrol Rinpoche, I consulted all the other pre­served Nyingma materials on the AA. The earliest available Nyingma texts on the AA are the word commentary The Lamp That Illuminates the Meaning of the Mother (PGBG, 88 pages; composed in 1700)31 and the general topics named Essence of Amrta (PGSD, 275 pages; composed in 1716), both by Perna Gyurme Gyatso32 (1686-1718), the second throne holder of Mindroling.33 As a son of the famous terton Terdag Lingpa34 (1646-1714), who founded this monastery, he was mainly educated by both his father and the latter's brother, Lochen Dharmasri (1654-1718), who also fully ordained him. Being a prolific author, the collected works of Perna Gyurme Gyatso consist of twentyvolumes. Both his texts on the AA are mainly based on Haribhadra's Atoka and Vtvrti. PGSD is very well structured and clear in its explanations, consisting of both a synoptical subcommentary on the Vtvrti and further elaborations on most of the general topics of the AA. In addition, PGSD relies on Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti and Rongton's commentaries on the AA, but occasionally also explicitly presents \"our own tradition\" (for PGSD's definitions of the eight topics and the seventy points of the AA, see Appendix VI). PGBG provides only very brief glosses on the verses of the AA, which usually do not differ from, or add anything to, LSSP/PBG. Mipham Rinpoche's (1846-1912) annotational commentary (MCG; 174 folios), called White Lotus Necklace, does not provide many general explana­tions, but is primarily focused on explaining the verses of the AA proper. Like most Tibetan commentaries, it is mainly based on the Vivrti and, in its head­ings and actual comments on the AA, often echoes PSD and PBG (and thus LSSP). It does not contain explicit definitions of the eight topics and the sev­enty points, but its glosses of AA 1.3-17 can be considered as such definitions (see Appendix VII).35 In addition, Mipham Rinpoche wrote a commentary on the Prajflaparamitiisart'lcayagatha (176 folios) called Unmistaken Excellent Explanations on the Intended Meaning of the Mother of the Victors. According to LN, this commentary explains this sutra based on the tradition of the early translations in Tibet. Its first part explains the sutra according to its explicit meaning (emptiness), while the second part (64 folios) does so according to its implict (or hidden) meaning (the clear realizations of the path). Thus, the latter part relates the verses of this sutra to the eight topics and seventy points of the AA in a concise manner, without, however, adding anything to the contents of MCG. In the possession of Akong Rinpoche, there is also an old blockprint of the AA (23 folios) with some handwritten notes that are attrib­uted to Mipham Rinpoche.36"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 Groundless Paths The eighth Dzogchen Khenpo, Padrnavajra (1867-1934), was a student of Patrul Rinpoche, entertained a mutual teacher-student relationship with Mipham Rinpoche, and was also a teacher of the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche, Tubten ChOkyi Dorje37 (1872-1935). His Clarification of the Intention of the Protector Maitreya (PVSD; 28 folios) is a brief synopsis of the AA which is largely based on LSSP/PSD.It consists mainly of the definitions and divisions of the eight topics and the seventy points, usually following, but often elabo­rating on, those of LSSP/PSD (see Appendices IV and V). Khenpo Shenga38 (1871-1921) was the first main teacher at the famous monastic college of Dzongsar, founded by Dzongsar Khyentse Jamyang ChOki Lodro (1893-1959), and also greatly revived the Nyingma academic curriculum. His Light of Altruism (SCG; 60 folios), in this author's typical fashion, is an annotational commentary on Haribhadra's Vivrti, which, for the most part, simply reproduces the latter verbatim, inserting just a few words or phrases here and there. Without relying on any Tibetan works at all, the text also contains some references to the Aloka, Prasphutapada, Durbodhaloka, Suddhimati, and other Indian commentaries. Beyond that, it contains a single general topic section on the ten bhtimis, but otherwise rarely provides further explanations, nor does it contain any definitions of the eight topics and the seventy points. The same author's prologue to SCG presents his brief over­view of the contents and purposes of all five texts ascribed to Maitreya.39 The Words of Ajita40 (MPZL; 198 pages) by Poba Tulku Dongag Tenpe Nyima41 (1895/1900-1959), a disciple of the famous Khenpo Kiinsang Belden (1862-1943), mainly comments directly on the verses of the AA. Compared to all the other Nyingma materials on the AA, MPZCs ways of categoriz­ing and explaining the subpoints of the seventy points of the AA are mostly quite unique, thus not having much in common with other commentaries. Its occasional brief elaborations include explanations on the twenty types of satpgha, the conceptions about apprehender and apprehended to be relin­quished on the paths of preparation and seeing, the sixteen moments of the path of seeing, the skill in means of bodhisattvas deliberately not relinquish­ing the afflictions in order to be reborn in sa�psara for the welfare of others, the knowledge of entities, the manner of cultivating the complete training in all aspects through alternating meditative equipoise and subsequent attain­ment, the signs of irreversibility of bodhisattvas, and the serial training (for the text's definitions of the eight topics and the seventy points, see Appendix VIII). The same author also wrote brief Notes on Prajnaparamita42 (SZB; 35 pages) that highlight some crucial points in the AA. In addition, he composed a second commentary on the AA, called The Ornament of the Intention of Ajita,43 which is sometimes referred to in MPZL. This commentary was more extensive than MPZL, but is no longer preserved."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 31 Both the short Preliminaries for the Explanation ofPrajnaparamita (SN; 14 folios) and Commentary on the Presentation of the Body of the Great Treatise Abhisamayalarrrkara (LNG; 20 folios) by the late Dzogchen Khenpo Tubten Tsondrii largely follow LSSP/PSD. The former text gives an overview of the prajfiaparamita sutras, the four founders of the different systems of their exe­gesis,44 and the Indian and Nyingma commentaries on the AA. The latter work provides the definitions, divisions, and boundary lines of prajftaparamita, the eight topics, and the seventy points (see Appendix IV). The contemporary scholar Kiinsang Tegchog Yeshe Dorje45 (born 1957) wrote his massive two-volume Jewel Mine (KSC; 807 folios) in 1999 upon the request of the Fourth Dodrupchen, Kiinsang Jigme Choying Rangdrol46 (born 1927}. According to the colophon of this text, it explains the AA through matching it with the sutras on the basis of Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti and Haribhadra's revised version of the Prajnaparamitasutra in Twenty­five Thousand Lines and also uses the two Brhattfkas, the Aloka, and other (Indian) commentaries for clarifying certain difficult passages. Thus, KSC appears to be based on Indian commentaries alone. While abounding with lengthy quotations from the sutras and supplementary explanations, the text does not provide definitions of the eight topics and the seventy points, nor does it add any significant materials to the other commentaries in terms of commenting on the AA proper. The endnotes for the respective sections of the translations of PSD and PBG include the relevant passages from all the above texts (except KSC and Mipham's commentary on the Prajnaparamitasarrrcayagatha}47 that provide different or additional explanations than PSD and PBG. Relationships between the contents of the Nyingma materials on the AA As for the congruencies between the various Nyingma materials on the AA, PVSD, SN, and LNG are clearly and fully based on LSSP/PSD. In terms of the comments on the verses of the AA proper, MCG often accords with PBG, but also provides occasional additional glosses. Similarly, PGBG, SCG, and KSC's direct comments on the AA mostly accord with PBG inasmuch as all four are based on Haribhadra's Vivrti. PGSD often differs, sometimes greatly, from both PSD and the general explanations in MCG. MPZL almost never con­forms to any of the other materials. In sum, though some of the later Nyingma commentators on the AA follow Patrul Rinpoche's works (and thus LSSP), it is noteworthy that all the major Nyingma commentaries by Perna Gyurme Gyatso, Mipham Rinpoche, Khenpo Shenga, and Dongag Tenpe Nyima often"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 Groundless Paths exhibit significant differences both among each other and in comparison to PSD and, to a lesser degree, PBG. This fact a}.one casts considerable doubt on PSD representing a typical Nyingma commentary on the AA or even being the model exegesis of this text in this school. If it were, one would expect that at least the later commentaries would follow it very closely, which is obviously often not the case. For example, the definitions of the eight topics and the seventy points of the AA in different texts are significant markers for how the entire structure and contents of the AA are understood in these texts. When considering these seventy-eight definitions in all of the Nyingma works that contain them, those in PVSD and LNG are generally identical to those in PSD (with PVSD often elaborating them). However, there are remarkably few overlaps between the four major commentaries PSD, PGSD, MCG, and MPZL. In detail, compared with PSD, PGSD contains only thirteen definitions that are dose to those in PSD, twenty that are somewhat or partly similar, but forty-five that are differ­ent. MCG contains thirteen definitions that are dose to those in PSD, eighteen that are somewhat or partly similar, and forty-seven that are different. In addi­tion, the definitions in PGSD and MCG that are respectively dose or similar to those in PSD are, for the most part, not the same either. MPZL contains only five definitions that are dose to those in PSD, eight that are somewhat or partly similar, and sixty-five that are different. Compared to PGSD, MCG contains six definitions that are dose to those in PGSD, twelve that are some­what or partly similar, and sixty that are different. Between the definitions in PGSD and MCG on the one side and MPZL on the other, there are virtually no overlaps. The question of an indigenous exegetical tradition of the AA in the Nyingma School It is standard with almost all classical Indian and Tibetan texts to emphasize the uninterrupted lineage of transmitting these texts and their exegesis from India all the way through a given school of Tibetan Buddhism. This is con­sidered to be of utmost importance in order to establish the authenticity and reliability of both the teachings contained in these texts and the commen­tarial stance on them in a particular school. However, in the case of such a lineage with regard to the AA and its commentaries in the Nyingma tradition, there is an obvious problem. For when one does not consider PSD and PBG as stemming from Longchenpa, the beginning of an actual Nyingma tradi­tion of commenting on the AA happened only in the early eighteenth century"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction 33 with Perna Gyurme Gyatso's works. Thereafter, it was only about two hundred years later that the bulk of the presently remaining Nyingma materials on the AA were composed (starting with Mipham Rinpoche and ending with Dongag Tenpe Nyima). Finally, there are the three works by the two contem­porary scholars Tubten Tsondrii and Tegchog Yeshe Dorje. Thus, there is an evident lack of a clear and long-standing commentarial lineage of the AA that is unbroken all the way back to the time when such lineages formed in the other major Tibetan schools in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In turn, all of these lineages of transmitting the teachings of the AA are largely based on earlier Kadampa commentaries (particularly in the Sangpu tradition of Ngog Lotsawa and his followers), some of which date as far back as the tenth century (of course, all Tibetan commentaries rely on the Indian com­mentaries, primarily those by Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra). This lack of a clear continual transmission of the AA that can be traced back to the formational period of the Nyingma School seems to be another, if not the main, reason for some Nyingmapas insisting on PSD and PBG being based, via LSSP, on Longchenpa, while at the same time largely neglecting the first clearly Nyingma commentary by Perna Gyurme Gyatso, which only origi­nated in the early eighteenth century. In any case, at present, among all the above materials on the AA, the ones that are primarily studied in Nyingma monastic colleges are PSD, PBG, MCG, SN, and LNG."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"TRANSLATIONS"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"• • • • • • • • • The General Topics of The Treatise on the Pith Instructions on Prajiiaparamita, The Ornament of Clear Realization { 2} 48 The explanation of this Treatise on the Pith Instructions on Prajnaparamita, The Ornament of Clear Realization, has two parts: 1) Identifying the nature of the text to be explained 2) Determining the meaning of this text 1. Identifying the nature of the text to be explained Our teacher [Buddha Sakyamuni], who is the supreme refuge, protector, and companion of the beings who wander in the three realms [of saqtsara], bestowed upon the fortunate ones to be guided many varieties of the nectar of the 'genuine dharma as the means to overcome the hundreds of sufferings of [ saqtsaric] existence. Among these, those that possess the utmost profundity {3} consist of the precious sfttra collection of prajfiaparamita-the single path traveled by all victors.49 Though there are many treatises that comment on the intention of this [sfttra collection], the main ones are known to the earlier [Tibetans] as being [by] \"the four great system founders.\"50 (1) The great being Nagarjuna, in terms of refuting any real entity (which [others attempt] to prove) and the reasonings of dialecticians (their means to prove [such an entity]), composed the fivefold collection of Madhyamaka reasoning51 and so on and thus founded the great system of the profound view of Madhyamaka. (2) The great master Dignaga explained the main points of the brief mother [sfttra]52 through summarizing them into thirty-two. As [his Prajnaparamitarthasarrtgraha] says: This is stated as foundation, governance, Activity, familiarization, Categories, signs, Downfalls, and benefit. 53"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 Groundless Paths Among [these eight], \"categories\" refers to [the division into] the sixteen emptinesses and \"familiarization,\" to the division into the ten remedies for the ten conceptual distractions. Therefore, there are thirty-two [points].54 (3) In the extensive commentary on the large and medium mother [siitras] and the one in eighteen thousand [lines], the Paddhati [or] Brhaffika55 on the mother, the meaning of the mother is commented on by way of the three approaches and the eleven instructional specifications. The three approaches are the approach of the concise teaching for those who understand through concise statements; the approach of the intermediate teaching for those who understand through elaboration; and the approach of the detailed explana­tion for the sake of those who are fond of words. The eleven instructional specifications are (1) [the Buddha] teaching Sariputra; (2) the explanations by Subhuti; {4} [the dialogues with] (3) Indra, (4) Subhuti, (5) Maitreya, (6) Subhuti, (7) Indra, (8) Subhuti, (9) Maitreya, and (10) Subhuti; and (11) [the Buddha] teaching Ananda and then entrusting [the siitras to him].56 ( 4) The victor Ajita composed the Abhisamayala711kdra through condens­ing the body of the mother into the eight topics and the seventy points and thus linking it with the progressive stages of the practice of yogins. In this way, it is explained [by Buton and others] that since each one of these four [masters] comments on the intention of the mother without relying on any other commentaries on this intention, they are explained to be \"system founders.\" However, the Prajnapar amitarthasa711 graha's manner of com­menting on the [prajiiaparamita] siitras through instructing on the practice of the remedies of the ten conceptual distractions and its manner of com­menting on these siitras through the three natures appear to accord with the Madhyantavibhaga and the Mahayanasa711graha. Therefore, [this text] does not initiate a [commentarial] system outside the dharmas of Maitreya. As for the Paddhati, through quoting passages from the Mitlamadhyamakakarika in its sections on the sixteen emptinesses and the nonexistence of arising, ceas­ing, afflicted phenomena, and purified phenomena, it asserts that these are to be explained according to the reasonings of venerable Nagarjuna. Therefore, it does not create any exegetical system outside of the collection of reasoning. 57 Therefore, according to the position of master Dharmamitra, 58 the top­ics of the mother are two-the core [topic] of ultimate reality and the vast progressive stages of clear realization, with the collection of reasoning com­menting on the first one and the Abhisamayala711ktira, on the second one. Alternatively, it is also said, \"The collection of reasoning [comments on] the topic of emptiness (the explicit teaching [of the prajiiaparamita siitras]), {5} while the Abhisamayala711kdra comments on the progressive stages of the manner in which the clear realization [of emptiness] arises in the mind streams of those to be guided when emptiness is explained [to them] (the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 39 implicit teaching [of these sutras]).59 Therefore, there arose two systems of commenting on the prajftaparamita [sfttras]-those of venerable [Maitreya] and honorable Nagarjuna. \"60 Among these, the dharma that is to be explained here is the Abhisamayala,kara. 61 As for the commentaries that follow this Ornament of the mother, there are twenty-one Indian commentaries-twelve commentaries that correlate [the AA] to the [prajftaparamita] sutras and nine that do not correlate [it to any sfttras].

If they do not see any such invalidation, subsequently the nature [of their trust] is the arising of an openness that cannot be taken away from them. 2ba2) As fo r the purpose of openness, from the cause of great openness hav­ing arisen, there arises the very intense respect or the striving aspiration for the mother slitras (the excellent words that make the three knowledges-the mother-their subject matter) and for this treatise (the excellent words that rely on these slitras) as being what is to be seized, held, read, comprehended, and applied in yoga in all respects. 2ba3) The purpose of respect is that, subsequent to such striving, one engages [in prajnaparamita] through gradually giving rise to the three prajfias that"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 Groundless Paths arise fr om study, reflection, and meditation. As for these three prajfias, the Vaibh�ikas assert: The mental states that arise from study and so on, respectively, Have names, both [names and referents], and referents for their objects.75 However, since it is impossible to observe both a name and its referent at the same time, there would be no [prajfia] that arises from reflection. Therefore, one should assert the fo llowing here. The prajfia that arises from having lis­tened to the words of the Buddha is the one that arises from study. The prajna of gaining certainty through examining their meaning with reasoning is the one that arises from reflection. The one that arises from fa miliarizing, through one-pointed samadhi, with that very certainty that has been gained is the prajfia that arises from meditation. 2bb) The ultimate purpose is that one, by virtue of such engagement, will attain the supreme of what is excellent-enlightenment. {12} 2bc) The outcome of these [points] is to establish that respect is attained from openness; engagement, from respect; and the supreme of what is excellent, from engagement. Therefore, great openness fo r the Bhagavati [Prajfiaparamita] is the primary cause among the causes fo r attaining every­thing that is excellent. 3) As for the meaning of the topical summary, in general there are [many] objects of paying homage and many ways of praising them. However, here the object of praise and paying homage is [mother prajiiaparamita as] the subject matter of the treatise. The way of praising this mother is to praise her by way of her accomplishing the specific desires of her fo ur [kinds of] children. The mother-the three knowledges-also represents the entirety of the clear realizations of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and bud­dhas. Therefore, through [these clear realizations] being embodied in her in this manner, all eight clear realizations represent the mother who is the object of praise and paying homage. In this context, the explanation [that sounds] as if the mother and prajiiaparamita are without difference is given merely in terms of these two being equal in function by way of their producing and sustaining the uncontaminated skandhas.76 However, it is not the case that these two are without difference otherwise because the meaning of the fully qualified mother is to accomplish the desires of her children and the meaning of the fully qualified prajiiaparamita is the genuine mind of realizing the lack of nature."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 45 4) The meaning of the words is as follows. The first three lines [of the A& opening verse of homage] are [each] explained by way of four [points]-the three of (a) [psychophysical] support, (b) means, and (c) fruition in accor­dance with the position of master Atula[dasa] and the added [point of] (d) their justification. 4a) As for the first line, [ 4aa)] the supports consist of what the Bodhisattvapitaka says: The liberation of sravakas [comes from] pursuing words. The pratyekabuddhas possess the discrimination of conditions. {13} Accordingly, the sravakas must themselves listen to [teachings] that involve words and also make those to be guided hear [teachings] that involve words.77 [Here] the pratyekabuddhas who attain enlightenment through the mere condition of realizing dependent origination, but do not depend on words (explaining, and listening to, the dharma), are included in the faction of the [sravakas]. The motivation [of both] is the desire for attaining peace­nirviil.la-for themselves alone. 4ab) As for the means, all skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are entities [or the bases] since they serve as the bases for childish beings clinging to them as a self and what is \"mine\" and the noble ones ascertaining them as being without a self and thus relinquishing the clinging to a self. [Therefore, the means] refer to the knowledge of entities of knowing that [all these entities] are primordi­ally empty of a personal self and the apprehended, respectively. 4ac) The fruition consists of the two types of nirviil)a, with remainder and without remainder, which represent the utter peace of afflictions and suffer­ing having completely subsided. You may wonder, \"What is the difference between these two?\" A critical analysis of this has three parts: 1) [The system of] the sravaka faction 2) [The system of] the Mere Mentalists 3) The system of the Madhyamikas 4acl) The system of the sravakas [has two parts]: a) The meaning of being with and without remainder b) What they assert as nirvaJ:.la 4acla) As for the difference between being with and without remainder, some explain that the difference lies in having relinquished all origins [of suffer­ing] without exception, but not having relinquished suffering, versus having relinquished all suffering without exception too. This is not justified because the great texts explain that, though arhats have terminated all karmas and"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 Groundless Paths afflictions that are certain to propel them into yet another existence, they still have many virtuous or nonvirtuous karmas that they committed during their phases as ordinary beings. { 14} Therefore, [the sravakas] asssert that the difference between these two [kinds of nirWI}.a] lies in having relinquished all afflictions without exception, while the continuum of the skandhas has not come to an end, versus the continuum of the skandhas having been sev­ered, which accords with [Candrakirti's] Yukt4�tikavrtti\"8 adducing the thesis of his [sravaka] opponents. Both [sravaka] factions [(Vaibh�ikas and Sautrantikas)] assert that [the nirvat)a without remainder] consists of nothing but the expanse of peace, in which awareness does not connect with a next [life], after arhats have cast off the fo rmations of [their last] life. 4aclb) From among the two [categories of] conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, nirvat)a [belongs to the category of] unconditioned phenomena. Here the Kashmirian Vaibha�ikas assert three uncontaminated phenom­ena-the two cessations79 and space. The Madhyadesika Vaibha�ikas assert four by adding suchness. Thus, from among these four unconditioned phe­nomena, both [Vaibha�ikas and Sautrantikas] hold both [kinds of] nirvat)a to be analytical cessations. The difference is that the Vaibh�ikas take them to have the nature of a nonimplicative negation and therefore [assert them to be] substantially existent. The Sautrantikas take them to have the nature of an implicative negation and thus assert them to be imputedly existent. 4ac2) In the system of the Mere Mentalists, the meaning of being with and without remainder is as above. As for the nature [of nirWI}.a], the ViniScayasartJgrahat;Ji explains it to have the defining characteristic of being the utterly pure dharmadhatu, while [Vasubandhu's] commentary on the MahayanasartJgraha explains it as being an analytical cessation. This sys­tem asserts that the continuum of awareness is severed upon [entering the nirvat)a] without remainder. At that point, though there is no termination in the sense of the two obscurations having been relinquished through the path, there is their coming to an end on their own accord since their support does not exist anymore. Therefore, it is asserted that the nirvat)as of the mahayana and the hinayana are without difference in terms of relinquishment. However, by virtue of their differing in terms of the power of aspiration prayers and the disposition, there is the difference of the welfare of others being or not being promoted, respectively. {15} 4ac3) As for the system of the Madhyamikas, in general, four [kinds of] nirvat)a are found in the words of the Buddha-natural, nonabiding, with remainder, and without remainder. The first is the nature of phenomena­the freedom from all reference points. The second is the nirvat)a of buddhas and bodhisattvas. [The explanation of] the latter two is twofold. In terms of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 47 the hinayana [nirvat)a], it is evident that [this system] asserts the following. [The nirvWJ,a] with remainder means that when arhats have not yet cast off the fo rmations of [their last] life, though they have relinquished the afflic­tions, they possess a remainder of suffering that has been propelled through [their fo rmer] karmas and afflictions. [The nirvWJ,a] without remainder refers to the time when [arhats] have cast off the physical fo rmations of [their last] life and thus have abandoned their coarse skandha of suffering, dwelling in mental bodies in pure realms within lotus buds.80 In terms of the mahayana, [Nagamitra's] Kayatrayavataramukha says: The nirvat)a with skandhas Is presented as the two [nipa]kayas of the sage. Since it is free from all skandhas, The dharmakaya is without skandhas. 81 Thus, it presents [the nirvWJ,as] with remainder and without remainder with regard to the three kayas, which also accords in meaning with a [similar] pas­sage in the Suvan:zaprabhasottamasutra. 4ad) The justification fo r the [first line of the A& homage] is as fo llows. The clinging to a personal self is the root of all afflictions and suffering. Through the knowledge of entities, the lack of a personal self is realized and thus the clinging to [such a] self is overcome and comes to an end. Therefore, it is justi­fied that the nirvWJ,a of being free from all suffering is attained. 4b) The second line [of the homage] also has fo ur parts. 4ba) As fo r the [psychophysical] support, the Samadhirajasutra says: \"This is the path that makes you attain the nectar [of buddhahood]. Relinquish bad paths {16} and consider [this] path\"-Thus, upon seeing sentient beings with bad views, they make them understand. For this reason, they are called \"bodhisattvas.\" Accordingly, bodhisattvas are those who desire to promote the welfare of beings fo r as long as the sa�psara of those to be guided lasts. 4bb) The means is the nature of realizing that, ultimately, all three paths [of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas] are without arising and, con­ventionally, represent causes, natures, and fruitions. 4bc) The fruition consists of the welfare that all beings desire-the higher realms and definite excellence.82"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 Groundless Paths 4bd) The justification [for this line] is that teaching others the unerring path must be preceded by one's own realization of the path, just as it is. As the Pramat:�avarttika says: Since the outcome of the means and its cause are hidden, It is difficult to explain them.83 4c) The third line [of the homage] also has fo ur parts. 4ca) The [psychophysical] support is that of buddhas, which is due to their perfect restraint from all mistaken behaviors of body, speech, and mind. 4cb) The means is to be endowed with the knowledge of all aspects of real­izing all aspects to be without arising. 4cc) The fruition is to pronounce this wheel of dharma, which is endowed with all aspects of the meaning (what is to be expressed) and also entails all kinds of elaborations in terms of the words (the means to express this). Here a critical analysis of the wheels of dharma has fo ur parts: 1) The nature of a dharma wheel 2) Hermeneutical etymology 3) Division 4) Size. 4ccl) As fo r the nature [of a dharma wheel], the Vaibha�ikas assert only the path of seeing to be the wheel of dharma. For they assert the fo llowing. When the path of seeing arose in the group of five84 by virtue of [the Buddha] hav­ing taught them the dharma in Yaral}.asi, the y�as85 proclaimed, \"The wheel of dharma has been turned.\" {17} Also, the precious wheel [of a cakravartin] and the path of seeing concord in [seven] fe atures. As fo r these concordant fe atures, since the path of seeing makes one realize the [four] realities swiftly, it moves swiftly. It leaves behind the fo cal objects and aspects86 of the preced­ing realities. It progresses to the later ones. By way of the uninterrupted path determining the attainment of what is to be relinquished, it makes one vic­torious over what one has not been victorious over. By virtue of the path of liberation leading to the attainment of the freedom of being free from what is to be relinquished, it truly establishes one in this victory. Through fo cusing on the realities of the higher realms, it soars up. Through fo cusing on the realities of the lower realms, it descends. Bhadanta Gho�aka holds that the eightfold path of the noble ones rep­resents the wheel of dharma. Since [correct] speech, aims of actions, and livelihood make up [the training in] ethics, they are similar to a hub of a wheel-that which functions as the support fo r [the further two trainings in]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 49 samadhi and prajfia. Since [correct] view, thought, and effort make up the training in prajfia, they cut through antagonistic fa ctors and thus are similar in their fe atures to cutting spokes. Since [correct mindfulness and] samadhi87 one-pointedly hold the view and so on in one's fo cus, their fe atures are like those of the rim [of a wheel] that holds it together. Therefore, the fe atures [of the eightfold path] concord with those of a wheel. [However,] since these approaches are mistaken in terms of [only pro­viding] partial proofs, they [are to be] rejected. Here, [in the mahayana,] all dharmas of scriptures and realization are to be asserted as dharma wheels because all the words of the Buddha are contained in the three wheels of dharma and one fo cuses on the meaning of these dharma wheels on all paths. 4cc2) The hermeneutical etymology of \"dharma wheel\" is that it is a wheel of dharma in the sense of having the nature of the dharma (such as the correct view) {18} and being turned smoothly by transiting from one mind stream to another.88 4cc3) The division is twofold-the dharma wheel of realization and the dharma wheel of scriptures. The dharma wheel of realization is [subdivided into] the five paths. The dharma wheel of scriptures is divided into twelve branches. As it is said: (1) The slitra collection, (2) proclamations in song, (3) prophecies, (4) Proclamations in verses, (5) joyful aphorisms, (6) counsels, (7) Legends, (8) narratives, (9) The extensive [discourses], (10) [reports on the Buddha's] fo rmer lives, (11) Ascertaining [discourses], and (12) [the discourses on] marvelous qualities-In this way, it was spoken in twelve branches. When summarized, these represent the three pitakas. The first five, such as the slitra collection, represent the pitaka of the slitra collection of the sravakas. The fo ur of counsels (as the primary one), legends, narratives, and [reports on the Buddha's] fo rmer lives (as supplements) represent the pitaka of the vinaya.89 The two of the [discourses on] marvelous qualities and the exten­sive [discourses] make up the pi taka of the slitra collection of bodhisattvas. The collection of ascertaining [discourses] represents the pitaka of the abhi­dharma of both the hinayana and the mahayana. This is the system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya. The Vastusamgraha�;�i takes the extensive [discourses] as the pitaka of the mahayana, while the others are the pitaka possessed by the sravakas, thus"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 Groundless Paths explaining both as the pitaka of the sfttra collection, which discords with this [presentation of the Abhidharmasamuccaya]. Through taking the four of counsels (the primary one) and its supplements as one, a commentary on the Lankavattlrasutra explains the branches of the words [of the Buddha] as being nine.90 {19} 4cc4) As for the size [of a dharma collection (dharmaskandha)], some say, \"Its extent is that of the treatise [called] 'Sariputra-made dharma collection' since it has six thousand slokas.\"91 Others [assert] it to refer to one complete dis­course that starts out with skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, realities, or dependent origination, and so on. Yet others hold that it consists of the complete remedy for a given factor to be relinquished. However, here there are two systems-the one of the common yana and the one of the uncommon [yana]. According to the first one, the system of the commentaries on the Abhidharmasamuccaya is to assert that one dharma collection [has] one thousand slokas. According to the second one, it is said that one dharma collection consists of what can be written with the [amount of] ink that is suitable to be carried by Indra's elephant, Suprati�thita. Given this, what the Satra on Repaying [the Buddha's] Kindness says is also appropriate: Noble Devadatta made [the monks] recite [all] the volumes that are to be carried by five thousand elephants. You may wonder, \"If there are that many dharma collections, why is it that not as many appear in Jambudvipa?\" Most [of them] are in other wordly realms and in the realm of the nagas. As [Candragomin's] Si�yalekha says: The teaching, as excellent as a supreme jewel, sound, And completely pure in nature, is worshipped respectfully By the great hooded nagas like a crown jewel And thus eliminates the gloom that dwells in the depths of the earth.92 4cd) As for the justification [of the third line of homage], if preceded by the knowledge of all aspects in terms of suchness and variety, [buddhas] are able to turn the wheel of dharma in accordance with the constitutions, motivations, and latencies of those to be guided, {20} but without such [knowledge] preced­ing it, the opposite is the case. Therefore, the turning of all dharma wheels without exception is established as the fruition of the knowledge of all aspects. 4d) The explanation of the fourth line [of the verse of paying homage] has two parts:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"a) The actual [explanation] Translations: The General Topics 51 b) The manner of becoming children of the victor 4da) In this way, [Maitreya says,] \"I pay homage to this mother of the Buddha with (that is, who is surrounded by) his assemblies of sriivakas (and, implic­itly, pratyekabuddhas) and bodhisattvas.\" That he speaks of \"the mother of the Buddha\" is out of the wish to indicate the main one of her children, but, ultimately, she is the mother of all four noble ones. 4db) Here to present clear realization as the mother and [said four] persons as her children is not a presentation of mother and child by virtue of [the former] giving birth to someone whose nature is [as different] as [an actual] mother and child [are]. So how is it then? In worldly terms, one may speak of some person who has benefited one greatly as \"being a mother to me.\" Likewise since the clear realizations of the three persons [(sriivakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas)] completely accomplish their respective ultimate desires, they represent the mother of these persons. Moreover, this mother is their mother because she gives birth to the uncontaminated skandhas that have not [yet] arisen in their mind streams (their temporary desire) and sustains the continuum [of these skandhas] once they have arisen. Also, the complete accomplishment of their ultimate desires must be preceded by temporarily producing and fostering their uncontaminated skandhas. Thus, [clear realiza­tion] is presented as the mother [of said persons] by virtue of the manners of accomplishing [their] ultimate and temporary desires. However since the knowledge of all aspects exists solely on the buddhabhumi, { 21} it is only suit­able as the mother that sustains buddhas, but is not taken to be the mother who gives birth [to what has not yet arisen]. 5) The explanation of [the homage] by way of rebutting objections [has two parts]. Sa) The objection is as follows. In this context of paying homage, since [praj.fiiipiiramitii] is praised by way of the three knowledges, this represents a praise and an homage that concord with the subject matter [of this trea­tise]. Therefore, implicitly, it [also] represents the commitment to compose a treatise that takes these three as its subject matter. On this some say, \"As for composing a treatise that takes the three knowledges as its subject matter, since the three knowledges cannot be defined by way of their natures, they must be taught in connection with their objects. Here you may take the subject matter [of the treatise] as consisting of (a) merely the numeric subdivisions of skandhas, dhatus, and iiyatanas in order to give rise to the praj.fiii that fully discriminates phenomena; (b) merely [all] remedial factors or the paths to the three [kinds ofj enlightenment in order to merely relinquish antagonistic fac­tors; (c) or the mere subdivisions of aspects (such as their being substantially"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 Groundless Paths or imputedly [existent]) in order to know all enumerations of knowable phe­nomena without exception. [So the question is] which one among these three [possibilities] is [the subject matter of the AA]? The first case would [merely] be a repetition of the abhidharma treatises. In the second case, the composi­tion of this treatise would be without purpose because one would not know which remedies are for which fa ctors to be relinquished. In the third case, [the question is] whether [the text] teaches the aspects as entailing [their respec­tive] bases or as being without bases. In the first case, when it teaches the aspects, it also needed to teach said bases, and therefore it would be a repeti­tion of the abhidharma. In the second case, it would fo llow that there is no realization of the actuality of entities because, through realizing aspects with­out bases, they would consist of mere imputations.\" Sb) The answer to this is as fo llows. {22} It is not that, through the subject matter consisting of partial [discussions ofj bases, remedies, and aspects, [this treatise] functions as a partial ornament of the mother. It functions as an ornament of all three knowledges by virtue of its subject matter consisting of the points of all three fa ctors-bases, remedies, and aspects. Therefore, there is no flaw of [this treatise] not explaining what must be explained. In order to understand the three knowledges (the [cognizing] subjects), which is its purpose, it teaches them in the manner of the points to go astray, the cause, and what is to be attained [through this cause].93 Therefore, there is no flaw of repeating the abhidharma treatises either. If [this treatise] is thus established as an ornament of the three knowledges, it is established as an ornament of all mother [sfitras] because the three knowledges include all clear realizations of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. For the triad of the large, medium, and brief mother [sfitras] explains that the clear realizations of said fo ur persons are included in the three knowledges.94 2.2.2.1.2.

Since it is just by virtue of [seeing this] that the intelligent engage [in such a treatise], [the set of purpose and connection] is definite as being fourfold because more than these [four] are unnecessary and fewer are not sufficient.

However since the Sautrantikas assert said three collections as series of term generalities, [they hold them to be included in the skandha of] nonassociated [formations]. Since the Vaibha�ikas assert them to be specifically characterized sounds that are made perceptible through speech, they hold them to be included in [the skandha of] fo rm.

The instances that are treatises [Sthiramati's] Madhyantavibhagatfka says: A treatise consists of the cognizances that appear as the collections of names, words, and letters. Or a treatise consists of the cogni­zances that appear as the special terms that cause one to attain supramundane wisdom. 99 Among these two [definitions of a treatise], the fo rmer identifies treatises as such and the latter, special [treatises]. Furthermore, for ordinary beings and noble ones up through reaching the tenth bhumi, treatises are respectively presented as the appearances of those to be guided and of both [those to be guided and the teacher]. For even on the tenth bhftmi, there is the clinging to one's own cognition appearing as sambhogikakayas and its appearing as names, words, and so on as respectively representing external buddhas and the speech of external tathagatas. Therefore, as long as there is such subtle clinging, just as names and words appear for the listeners, something similar also occurs for those who explain [these names and words]. Hence, if treatises are asserted as series of term generalities, they would become nonentities and therefore would not be produced by persons. Consequently, one had to accept [the position of] those who propound the Vedas. {27} Also, if [treatises] are asserted as specifically characterized"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 57 sounds, [it would follow that] no treatise is composed unless it is uttered as speech, and that the rhino like [pratyekabuddhas] do not teach the dharma to those to be guided. 2.2.2.1.2.3.2. Explanation of the term [\"wtra\" (treatise)] You may wonder why [treatises] are called \"sastra.\" It is because they restore100 the mind streams of the disciples. Through giving rise to the three trainings in the mind streams of the disciples, they prevent what is not appropriate from coming forth from their threefold collection of body, speech, and mind and make them engage in the actions that are appropriate to come forth. Thus, according to the explanations in the Vinayavibhaga and the Vyakhyayukti, since this hermeneutical etymology is fully met, also the words of the victor are to be asserted as treatises.101 2.2.2.1.2.3.3. The actual meaning of the words [of AA 1.1-2] This has four parts. The subject matter [of the AA] consists of the knowledge of all aspects (the path of buddhas alone) and the remaining seven [top­ics] exemplified by it that are explained by the teacher, the Buddha, in these mother [sfttras]. The essential purpose is that intelligent bodhisattvas, after having commit­ted the meaning of the mother sfttras (bodhicitta and the ten piiramitiis as the conduct of the dharma practices),102 which has the character of definitely according with the eight topics, to memory (which is associated with alertness), progress through the ten bhiimis and manifest this knowledge of all aspects, which is not experienced by others than bodhisattvas, through seeing it. As for the purpose, [Maitreya says that] the purpose of undertaking the com­position of the Abhisamayalarrzkara is that, based on this Abhisamayalarrzkara, the subject matters of the sfttras may be realized in an easy way (that is, with little difficulty) for the sake of said essential purpose. The connection is implicit-\"the purpose of this undertaking\" {28} [implies] the connection between the treatise and its purpose, while \"so that\" implies the connection between the two purposes.103 2.2.2.2.

Instruction on the actual and nominal prajfiiparamitas This has two parts: 1) Presenting the assertions 2) Demonstrating the justified position among them 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Presenting the assertions In general, there are five different assertions on this. ( 1) The Satasahasrika­pancavi'?'lsatisahasrikfl$tada5asahasrikaprajnaparamitabrhaffika holds that the meditative equipoise of the buddhabhii.mi-the vaj ralike samadhi with­out appearances-is the actual prajfiiipiramiti, while the fo ur conceptual and nonconceptual wisdoms of subsequent attainment, whose nature it is to be associated with appearances, represent the nominal prajfiiipiiramitii. Since the wisdoms of sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats are results of prajfiiipiramitii and the texts represent its cause, they are [also] nominal. In addition, the mere"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 Groundless Paths name \"prajfiaparamita\" is applied to all realizations of [the level of] engage­ment through aspiration108 and the ten bhtimis, so they are nominal [too].I09 (2) Master Dignaga explains [in his Prajfliipiiramitiirthasa1pgraha]: Prajfiaparamita is nondual wisdom, Which is the Tathagata. By virtue of being connected to this actuality to be accomplished, It is [also] the term for both the [related] scriptures and the path.U0 As fo r the meaning of this, most earlier [masters] assert that the illusionlike nondual wisdom of buddhas is the actual [prajfiaparamita], while both the texts and the path are nominal. (3) [Ratnakara8anti's] Suddhamati asserts that the meditative equipoises of the ten bhtimis represent the fully qualified prajnaparamita, while those of both ordinary beings and buddhas are the causes and results, respectively, of the [former] and thus nominal. {31} His intention that represents the reason fo r asserting it in this way lies in the mother sfttras stating that [bodhisattvas should] make efforts in prajfiaparamita, which functions as the remedy fo r the ten conceptual distractions. Therefore since the [level of] engagement through aspiration is not able to function as the remedy fo r these [distractions] and buddhas are free from any remedial activity, [their respective meditative equi­poises] are nominal. m (4) Buddhajfianapada says [in his Sa1pcayagiithapanjikii]112 that \"prajfia\" is what fully discriminates phenomena. \"Parama\" refers to the trust in identity­lessness at the time of engagement through aspiration and to being devoid of all conceptions upon having attained the bhumis. (5) Vimalamitra asserts [in his Prajniipiiramitiihrdayatikii]113 that the ultimate prajfiaparamita is the dharmakaya, while [everything] from the gen­eration of bodhicitta up through the defining characteristics of the practice of final deliverance makes up the causal prajnaparamita. 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Demonstrating the justified position among them When seeking out the intention of the [above] statement of master Dignaga, according to the explanations of the Abhisamayala1pkiiriilokii114 and [Triratnadasa's] Prajniipiiramitiirthasa1pgrahakarikiivivara�;�a, 115 it appears that [prajfiaparamita] is asserted as principal and ordinary [versus actual and nominal]. Nevertheless, {33}116 as explained above, since texts such as the [prajfiaparamita sfttra] in one hundred thousand lines are merely the cog­nizances of the mind streams of those to be guided appearing as the aspects of names, words, and letters, they are not the fully qualified prajfiaparamita. Consequently, though the path represents the ordinary [prajfiaparamita], this"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 61 does not contradict its being fully qualified, just as an ordinary person [is still a fully qualified person] .117 You may wonder, \"As which kinds of paths is [prajnapiiramita] asserted?\" This [discussion] has four parts-instances, definition, boundary lines, and hermeneutical etymology. The instances [of prajfiapiiramita] are the factors that consist of the real­izations, through the three paths of the noble ones of the mahayana, that all phenomena are without nature. The definition [of prajfiapiiramita] is \"the knowledge of directly realizing all phenomena as being free from reference points, which has gone, or makes one go, to the nonabiding nirviil}.a.\" The boundary lines are that the fully qualified [prajfiaparamita] exists on the three paths of the noble ones of the mahayana, while the nominal one exists on the paths of accumulation and preparation. As for the hermeneutical etymology [of prajfiaparamita], since it is the supreme of all knowledges, it is prajfia (\"supreme knowledge\"), for it focuses on the ultimate. Since it is the most genuine of all prajfias, it is the piiramita [of prajfia], for it is what has gone, or makes one go, to the nonabiding nirviil}.a.118 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2. The manner in which these divisions are specified through names This has five parts: 1) Definitions of the eight topics 2) Their definite number 3) Their definite order {34} 4) Their boundary lines 5) Rebutting [the criticism of there being needless] repetitions 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Definitions of the eight topics (1) The definition of the knowledge of all aspects is \"the direct knowl­edge of all aspects of suchness and variety without exception in one single moment.\" It is divided into two-the knowledge of all aspects of suchness and variety. 119 (2) The definition of the knowledge of the path is \"the path of training which realizes that the three paths are without nature and which manifests the true end through completion, maturation, and purification.\" In this context, \"completion\" refers to the completion of aspiration prayers; \"maturation,\" to the maturation of the mind streams of those to be guided; and \"purifica­tion,\" to the purification of buddha realms.120 \"The true end\" is explained as a synonym of suchness or the dharmadhatu in the Madhyantavibhaga, the Abhidharmasamuccaya, the mother sfttras, and the Abhisamayalarrzkaraloka. The Uttaratantra says:"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 Groundless Paths The true end121 has been stated to be devoid Of conditioned phenomena in all respects. Therefore, it refers to the dhatu of peace that is empty of all reference points and characteristics-sheer nirval).a. As for the meaning of \"manifesting\" it, as it is explained in the third one among the eight profundities [in AA IV.SSd-59], the one-sided partial peace [of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] refers to abiding in this very [dhatu] through greatly emphasizing it and thus constantly resting in it in meditative equipoise, but not to merely manifesting it. If one engages in it on the paths of training in the [former] manner, one falls into the extreme of extinction. For when one constantly abides in the peaceful dhatu without having fully completed the accumulations, {31} there is no promoting of the welfare [of others] through the appearance of the rfipakayas during subsequent attainment. [On the other hand,] if completion, maturation, and purification [are fully completed] , despite constantly abid­ing in the peaceful dhatu the welfare of others is promoted spontaneously through the two rfipakayas. Therefore, there is no falling into the extreme of peace. Consequently, it is also with this in mind that [bodhisattvas] are said to pass into nirv�a on the eighth bhfuni, unless they are exhorted by the tathagatas [to continue on the mahayana path]. The knowledge of the path is divided into the three knowledges of the path [of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas]. (3) The definition of the knowledge of entities is \"the limited knowledge that realizes that all bases are empty of a personal self.\" It is divided into two­the knowledge of entities of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. {32} (4) The definition of the complete training in all aspects is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas in which they fa miliarize with the three types of nonarising in a combined manner in order to attain mastery over realizing the three knowl­edges.\" It is divided into the twenty trainings. (5) The definition of the culminating training is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas in which they have gained mastery over fa miliarizing with the three types of nonarising in a combined manner based on the complete training in all aspects.\" It is divided into seven. (6) The definition of the serial training is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas in which they sequentially familiarize with the aspects of the three knowledges in order to stabilize the realization [that consists] of the simultaneous arising of the cognitive aspects122 of the three knowledges.\" It is divided into three. (7) The definition of the instantaneous training is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas that is the final [stage] of the sequential familiarization with the three know­ledges.\" When divided in terms of isolates, it is fo urfold."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 63 (8) The definition of the dharmakaya is \"the final fruition of having cul­tivated the trainings that is endowed with a multitude of uncontaminated branches.\" It is divided into the four kayas. 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.2. Their definite number For a single person to become enlightened, there is the definite number of the triad of the objects to be known, the path to be practiced, and the fruition to be attained. Therefore, the first are definite as the three knowledges; the sec­ond one, as the four trainings; and the third one, as the dharmakaya. As for what is to be known being definite as the three knowledges, just as a merchant, upon hearing about the profit of selling something, engages in the means to do so, first, the knowledge of all aspects that is endowed with the two welfares of oneself and others is taught for the sake of generating enthusiasm for the fruition. Once [bodhisattvas] understand this, they will engage in the means for [attaining] it. Therefore, the knowledge of the path [is taught] as the means for that. Since knowing the [latter] 's points of going astray depends on the knowledge of entities, the knowledge of entities is taught next. As for the practice being definite as the four trainings, since it is not suf­ficient to merely determine the three knowledges [through studying and reflecting], {33} they must be made a living experience. This [process] is defi­nitely fourfold in number because it entails the two [aspects of] g�erating the realizations of the path that have not yet arisen in one's mind stream and of making those that have already arisen special. For the complete training in all aspects makes one attain what has not been attained; the culminating train­ing is the phase of attaining; the serial training makes what has already been attained special; and the instantaneous training is merely the phase of the [latter] being accomplished. {34} You may wonder, \"A single set of cause and result is certainly sufficient, so what is the point of two?\" In the absence of the cause and result of gaining mastery, the effortless spontaneous dharmakaya is not attained, and in the absence of the cause and result of gaining stability, {35} the knowledge of all aspects that manifests all [uncontaminated] dharmas upon manifesting a single [such] dharma is not attained. Therefore, both sets are necessary. The serial training, which familiarizes with the three knowledges in a progressive manner, means to practice a single [virtuous dharma] (such as generosity) through progressively connecting it with the other virtuous dhar­mas (such as ethics). The instantaneous training is the final phase [of this process]-through having become familiar with said mental engagement for a long time, one is able to manifest all uncontaminated [ dharmas] upon manifesting a single one."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 Groundless Paths The complete training in all aspects consists primarily of meditative equi­poise, which is what gives rise to dear realizations through familiarizing with the core topic [of the prajfiaparamita sutras, that is, emptiness]. The serial training represents primarily the meditation during subsequent attain­ment, which consists of mentally engaging in the dear realizations that have [already] arisen or have not yet arisen.123 The fruition of practicing said trainings after having determined them in this manner through studying and reflecting is just the dharmakiiya alone. Therefore, [the eight topics] are definite in number. 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.3. Their definite order When the three knowledges are explained in said manner, they represent the order of explaining them so that the audience understands them easily, while the four trainings represent the order of the actuality of causes and results. 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.4. Their boundary lines Since the three knowledges entail definite [psychophysical] supports, they respectively exist in buddhas, bodhisattvas, and sravakas and pratyekabuddhas.124 Both the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path exist from the path of accumulation up through the path of nonleaming.125 The complete training in all aspects exists from the lesser path of accumu­lation up through the end of the continuum of the ten bh\\imis. The culminating training exists from [the level of] heat [on the path of preparation] up through the end of the continuum. The serial training exists from the path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum. Here the serial training of mentally engaging in a progressive manner in the dear realizations that are taken as objects through studying and reflecting exists mainly from the path of accumulation onward, {36} while the serial training of mentally engaging in the dear realizations that are experienced through [the prajfia] which arises from meditation exists mainly from [the level of] heat onward. The instantaneous training exists at the end of the ten bh\\imis. The dharmkiiya exists solely on the buddhabhumi. 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.2.5. Rebutting [the criticism of there being needless] repetitions This has four parts. First, it may be said, \"The three knowledges and the training in the three knowledges that is explained in the complete training in all aspects are repetitious.\" They are not repetitious for three reasons. The three knowledges [have] definitely distinct aspects [as their objects], while"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 65 the complete training in all aspects is the subject of all these aspects without exception. Since the three knowledges are taught as what is to be known by way of what defines and what is defined, they are the fully qualified [objects to be known], while the complete training in all aspects teaches them by way of making them a living experience and thus represents the training [in them]. What is explained in the three knowledges is taught as the object of studying and reflecting, 126 while what is explained in the complete training in all aspects refers to what is generated in order [to serve as] the remedy that relinquishes the stains. Therefore, [the three knowledges and their explanation in the com­plete training in all aspects] are not repetitious. Secondly, it may be argued, \"The knowledge of all aspects and the knowl­edge of the path are repetitious because the very explanations on both [the paths of] seeing and familiarization (such as the equipment of the bhiimis) [in the fo rmer] are also explained in the knowledge of the path.\" The expla­nations in the knowledge of all aspects are fo r the sake of indicating that the knowledge of all aspects is the single knowledge of all causal and resultant phenomena without exception. The explanations in the knowledge of the path eliminate the concern about the knowledge of the path of the children of the victors not being what is explained in the knowledge of all aspects and teach the knowledge of the path that knows the three paths [of bodhisatt­vas, sravakas, and pratyekabuddhas] through defining it by way of its objects. Therefore, [the knowledge of all aspects and the knowledge of the path] are not repetitious.127 Thirdly, it may be said, \"The knowledge of the path and the knowledge of entities are repetitious because the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are also taught in the second chapter.\" {37} What is explained in the second chap­ter is fo r the sake of defining the knowledge of the path that is the [cognizing] subject, while what is explained in the third [chapter] teaches being free from superimpositions (such as impermanence) as the remedial knowledge of enti­ties. Therefore, it teaches the opposites that are implied by this as being the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and independently teaches their paths as being separate. Therefore, [the knowledge of the path and the knowledge of entities] are not repetitious. 128 Fourthly, it may be argued, \"The knowledge of all aspects and the dharmakaya are repetitious because both are taught in both [of these topics].\" They are not repetitious, fo r [the explanation] in the first [chapter is in terms of the] object [to be known], while the explanation in the eighth one is in terms of the fruition [to be attained]. Also, what is taught [in the first chapter] is in terms of the defining [points] and [what is taught in the eighth one is in terms of its] nature."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.2.

The nature of the generation of bodhicitta as what is supported [This has three parts]: 1) Instantiation 2) Definition 3) Divisions 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Instantiation There are five ways of asserting this. ( 1) Master Asailga holds aspiration to be the nature of the generation of bodhicitta. His Bodhisattvabhumi says: The generation of bodhicitta is the supreme aspiration of bodhisattvas. 139 Master Vasubandhu asserts intention as the nature of the generation of bodhicitta, which is what he says in his Mahayanasutralalflkiirabhii$ya [on IV.1].140 However, the Mahayanasutralalflkiira [also] says: The aspiration of the steady ones Consists of intention associated with resolve.141 Thus, it states that intention associated with the [mental] aid of resolve repre­sents aspiration prayer. Therefore, the intention of the brothers [Asailga and Vasubandhu] comes down to the same. (2) Master Aryavimuktisena holds the nature [of the generation of bodhi­citta] to be mmd. [His Vrtti says]: [The word] \"mind\" (citta) in \"generating bodhicitta\" refers to con­sciousness ... 142 Also, having in mind that the consciousnesses of the five [sense] doors solely look outward and that the alaya and the afflicted mind are neutral, {46} he does not present [mind] as [either of] them, but explains the mental con­sciousness, which is suitable as the support for all virtuous dharmas, to be the instantiation [of bodhicitta]. (3) Likewise, master Haribhadra also teaches the definition of the genera-tion of bodhicitta from the Mahayanasutralalflkiira, which says: It is the intention of bodhisattvas With great enthusiasm, great endeavor, Great purpose, and great outcome That is the arising of the mind endowed with the twofold welfare.143"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"7 4 Groundless Paths [Haribhadra] thinks that the first line is an explanation [of the generation of bodhicitta] as being mind and takes it to indicate that a mind which entails the [mental] aid of intention represents the generation of bodhicitta. In the [above quote], \"great enthusiasm\" refers to not being weary of engaging in hardships with armorlike vigor for a long time. \"Great endeavor\" means to practice according to said armorlike [vigor] with the vigor of application. \"Great purpose\" means for the sake of benefiting oneself and others. \"Great outcome\" is the accomplishment of great enlightenment. Thus, the first two phrases teach [the qualities that are] produced by persons and the following two, the qualities of promoting welfare and of seizing the fruition. \"The two welfares\" goals are to focus on enlightenment and the welfare of others.144 (4) Master Buddhasri[jfiana's Prajnapradipavali]I45 asserts the generation of bodhicitta as being a striving resolve and holds that minds and mental fac­tors are one in substance. (5) [Ratnakara]santi holds [the generation of bodhicitta] to be both menta­tion and resolve. His Suddhamatl says: What is called \"the entity of generating bodhicitta\" is mind (that is, mentation) and desire.146 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.2.

Division in terms of nature When divided in terms of its nature, [the generation of bodhicitta] is two­fold-aspiration and application. This involves (a) presenting the systems of others and (b) demonstrating the justified position. a) There are four different ways of asserting [the difference between the bodhicitta of aspiration and application]. Buddhasrijfiana asserts [the differ­ence] as referring to not having versus having attained the bhiimis:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 75 The bodhicitta of aspiration is the one of all mundane [paths], while the bodhicitta of application is the one from Supreme Joy onward.148 [Dharmamitra's] Prasphutapada149 explains [the difference as] not having versus having adopted [bodhicitta] through a ritual. Others assert it as not having versus having attained irreversibility or making a commitment with regard to the cause and the result, respectively. b) As fo r demonstrating the justified position, [Santideva's] Si�asamuccaya says: Bodhicitta is twofold-the mind of aspiring fo r enlightenment and the mind of setting out for enlightenment. The Garpjavyuhasutra states: 0 son of noble fa mily, sentient beings who aspire fo r unsur­passable completely perfect enlightenment are rare in the realm of sentient beings. Even rarer than those are the sen­tient beings who have set out fo r unsurpassable completely perfect enlightenment.150 The Bodhicaryavatara says: In brief, bodhicitta Should be known as twofold: The mind of aspiring fo r enlightenment And the mind of setting out for enlightenment. Just as the difference is understood Between the desire to walk and walking, So should the learned understand, In due order, the difference between these two.151 Since these [statements] have the same intention, the [correct] explana­tion is like that. Furthermore, it is as Praj:fiakara[mati] {48} says [in his Bodhicaryavatarapanjika]'52 when referring to the [above] passage-[both kinds of bodhicitta] do not go beyond the desire for completely perfect enlightenment for the welfare of others, but they are to be understood as having different characteristics by virtue of their entailing or not entailing physical, verbal, and mental actions [that put this desire into practice]."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 Groundless Paths Therefore, first, great compassion that focuses on sentient beings arises. Based on this, there arises the mere motivation of thinking, \"I shall attain buddhahood in order to liberate all these [sentient beings] from [saJllsaric] existence.\" This is [the bodhicitta of] aspiration. Thereafter, through hav­ing taken the [bodhisattva] vow and so on, even when one engages in just a fraction of the six paramitas as the conduct toward unsurpassable enlighten­ment, this is the [bodhicitta of] application that actually fulfills this function. Consequently, aspiration and application are equal in their nature in that both entail the motivation of thinking, \"I shall attain buddhahood for the welfare of others.\" However, these two are mutually exclusive because of being and not being associated, respectively, with the activities for accomplishing enlighten­ment. This corresponds to the example of the mere arising of a mental state of desiring to go to a certain place versus [this desire] subsequently being associated with the activity of setting out on the road and [actually] going [to this place]. Therefore, [the bodhicitta of] aspiration is solely a beginner's bodhicitta. Accordingly, [Kamalasila's] first Bhavanakrama says: The bodhicitta of aspiration is the initial striving [of thinking], \"May I become a buddha for the sake of benefiting all beings.\" The bodhicitta of application begins with the subsequent taking of the bodhisattva vow and then being engaged in gathering the accumulations.153 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Division in terms of the manner of arising This has two parts: 1) Arising through symbols 2) Arising through the power of familiarization 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Arising through symbols The Mahayanasutrala�?tkiira says: Through the power of a friend, the power of its cause, the power of roots, The power of study, and the cultivation of virtue, The generation of bodhicitta taught by others is explained As arising in a stable or unstable manner.154 {49} Here the generation of bodhicitta by virtue of the teachings of others and the representative verbal indications of others refers to the generation of bodhi­citta that arises from taking [the bodhisattva vow] through [certain] symbols."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 77 The arising of this [bodhicitta] has many forms. It may arise (1) through the power of a friend, that is, due to a spiritual friend; (2) through the power of its cause, that is, the force of the [mahayana] disposition; (3) through the power of roots of virtue, that is, the flourishing of said disposition; ( 4) through the power of studying [the mahayana scriptures] a lot; and (5) through the power of having cultivated virtue, that is, [bodhicitta] arising from [activities] such as always studying, memorizing, and explaining the dharma in this lifetime. [Among] these, the first one is not stable, while the remaining four are stable. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Arising through the power of fa miliarization The Mahayanasutralarrzkara says: By virtue of having attended the perfect buddhas well, Through having gathered the accumulations of merit and wisdom, And due to the arising of nonconceptual wisdom about phenomena, It is the ultimate one.155 Once one attains being equal-minded Toward phenomena, sentient beings, Their actions, and supreme buddhahood, By virtue of these, its joyfulness is outstanding.156 The first line of the first verse refers to [bodhisattvas] receiving the supreme scriptural instructions and the second one, to their accomplishing the supreme causes [of bodhicitta]. The third one teaches the distinctive feature of their realization, that is, their supreme insight. Once they have generated bodhicitta through these three features, it is taught to be the ultimate one. [The next verse speaks of] attaining the [first] bhfuni], Supreme Joy, and thus teaches the causes for its supreme joy being outstanding. For [these bodhisattvas] are equal-minded toward phenomena, sentient beings, buddhas, and the actions of sentient beings. In due order, these refer to realizing phenomenal identitylessness, the equality of themselves and others, {50} the dharmadhatu of buddhas and their own [dharmadhatu]being inseparable, and desiring to extinguish the sufferings of others as if these sufferings were their own. 157 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. Division in terms of boundary lines [According to Mahayanasutralarrzkara IV.2,] on the level of engagement through aspiration, it is the generation of bodhicitta that arises through aspira­tion; on the first seven bhumis, the one that is the pure superior intention; on the three [pure] bhfunis, such as the eighth one, the one that is maturation; and on the buddhhabhfuni, the one of [all] obscurations having been relinquished. 158"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 Groundless Paths Some say, \"Buddhas do not generate bodhicitta. For if they did, it would have to be cloudlike,159 but they lack this [kind of bodhicitta] since the Mahayanasutrala111kiira explains: The generation of bodhicitta of the children of the victors Is said to be similar to a cloud. \"160 There is no flaw [in buddhas generating cloudlike bodhicitta]-its existence in the children of the victors does not exclude its existence in buddhas. Also, one is well able to examine the intention of [Maitreya speaking of] the gen­eration of bodhicitta to be attained by the children of the victors [in the above quote]. Otherwise, he would contradict [his own] boundary lines [in Mahiiyiinasutrala111kiira IV.2] above and there would also be the very absurd consequence of there being no ultimate generation of bodhicitta, [that is, the one in buddhas]. It may be said, \"But then buddhas would have desire. However, such is unreasonable because [desire] is conceptual.\" There is no flaw in that either. [Abhayakaragupta's] Marmakaumudi says that buddhas [indeed] lack the conceptual [bodhi]citta that makes them strive, but they possess the noncon­ceptual [bodhi]citta to be strived fo r. Alternatively, though the resolve [of bodhicitta] is conceptual on the paths of training, it is nonconceptual on the buddhabhfimi.161 No matter which one of these two explanations [is taken], they are acceptable and therefore there is no contradiction. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Division in terms of the manners of desiring [enlightenment] This is threefold-the desire for oneself becoming a buddha through establish­ing all sentient beings in buddhahood represents the shepherdlike [generation of bodhicitta]; the desire for oneself and others becoming buddhas at the same time, {51} the fe rrymanlike [generation of bodhicitta]; and the desire to liberate others after one oneself has become a buddha, the kinglike generation of bodhicitta. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.3. The benefit The Bodhicaryiiviitara says: Once bodhicitta has arisen in them, in an instant The fe eble who are fe ttered in the dungeon of saip.sara Are called \"children of the sugatas\" And worldly gods and humans will pay homage to them.162"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"[Nagarjuna's] Bodhicittavivara�Ja states: Without generating bodhicitta Buddhahood is never attained.

Receiving the instructions (what purifies the generation of bodhicitta) This has five parts: 1) The [psychophysical] supports for receiving them 2) The causes due to which they are received 3) The objects from whom they are received 4) The nature of what is to be received 5) Boundary lines {52} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.

In particular, the mahayana instructions are twofold-ordi­nary and special ones. From among these, the ones taught here are the latter. If one listens to them directly [coming] from a buddha, one must have arrived on the great path of accumulation. The Mahayanasutralarrzkara says: Through having accomplished The supernatural knowledges in samadhi They travel to [various] realms in the universe In order to pay homage, and listen, to buddhas beyond measure.165 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.2. The causes due to which they are received The Mahayanasutralarrzkara says: Then, within the stream of dharma, Extensive instructions are received"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 Groundless Paths From the buddhas in order to attain Vast calm abiding and wisdom.166 Accordingly, [said instructions are received] based on the samadhi of the stream of dharma. [Its description] has three parts. (1) Its definition is \"the mindfulness and alertness, congruently associated with samadhi, of being able to directly seize countless words and meanings of buddha speech from the victors.\" (2) The explanation of the term refers to the ability to seize the words and meanings of buddha speech-the dharma-in a [continuous] stream, that is, in an uninterrupted manner. (3) As for the boundary lines, the special [kind of this samadhi] exists on [the level of] the supreme dharma [of the path of preparation], but in general, it exists on the great path of accumulation. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.3. The objects from whom they are received There is the assertion by some that [said instructions are received from] bud­dhas alone. {53} However, according to [the standard phrasing], \"the buddhas and so forth who reside in the ten directions,\" both buddhas and the spiritual friends who are able to teach the mahayana instructions qualify [as the teach­ers of said instructions]. For there are also many sravaka teachers even fo r the mahayana instructions, that is, practicing according to the instructions in sfttras such as the mother [sfttras]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.4. The nature of what is to be received Some say that [said instructions] refer to direct instructions from a buddha, [but] this is not tenable. It was demonstrated above that, even for the special [mahayana] instructions, there is no certainty about their teacher [having to be] a buddha. In general, it is not even certain that [said instructions have to] be the words of a buddha because the purport of said special instruc­tions is also perfectly complete in [treatises] such as the Abhisamayala'?'lkiira. Therefore, these special instructions are represented by all the sfttras and trea­tises that comprehensively teach all the aspects of the path of those with the mahayana disposition becoming buddhas.167 Here some assert that both the instructions and the practice in accordance with these instructions represent the instructions.168 However, the instructions are the fully qualified means of expression, while the practice in accordance with these teachings is the result of these instructions. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2.5. Boundary lines Prajfiiikara[mati] explains that [the instructions] exist from the level of a beginner up through the buddhabhumi.169 The Prasphutapada explains:"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 81 On the uninterrupted path, [bodhisattvas] do not strive fo r the [instructions] because they are able to give rise to self-arisen wis­dom.170 {54} However, the latter [only] applies in terms of the boundary lines [of the instructions referring to bodhisattvas] definitely having to listen to instructions, but if they are set [in terms] of the teacher, the fo rmer [explanation] applies. The meaning of said instructions [is discussed further] in two parts: 1) Teaching on the actual instructions 2) Particular explanation of what is difficult to understand 1) The actual instructions have fo ur parts in terms of the instructions on a) practice's own nature b) the fo ur realities as its fo cal objects c) the three jewels as its fo undation d) the causes of excellent practice. 1a) Practice's own nature [The nature of mahayana practice] consists of the means fo r accomplishing virtuous dharmas that are explained in the [prajfiaparamita] sfitras in the sec­tion on the generation of bodhicitta. For they are what make [bodhisattvas] attain the dharmakaya (what is to be realized) through the six paramitas (the application [of the motivation of bodhicitta]) fo r the sake of all sentient beings (the aim). Therefore, [this practice] is not in common with sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, but more eminent than theirs.171 The sfitras say: Sariputra, if this Jambudvipa were completely filled solely with bh�us such as Sariputra and Maudgalyayana (like a thicket of reeds, of bamboo, of sugar cane, or of rushes, or a field of rice, or a field of sesame), their [collective] prajfia does not even come close to the prajfia of a bodhisattva mahasattva who fa miliarizes with prajfiaparamita even fo r a single day by one hundredth part, nor by one thousandth part, nor by one hundred thousandth part up through one trillionth part. It does not come close by any num­ber, fraction, counting, similarity, comparison, {55} or resemblance. Sariputra, it is to such an extent that the prajfia of a bodhisattva who engages in prajnaparamita and familiarizes with it fo r just a single day outshines the prajfia of all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Why is that? Sariputra, the prajfia of a bodhisattva mahasattva is con­cerned with all sentient beings passing into nirv�a.172"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 Groundless Paths 1b) The explanation of the four realities as the focal objects [of practice] has five parts: a) Explanation of the term b) Their natures c) Their being one or different d) Their definite number e) Their definite order 1ba) The meaning of the term \"reality\" The Viniscayasa1f1graha1;1i says: What is the meaning of \"reality\" [here]?

It is [ch�acter­ized by] suchness, the path, and the nonarising of afflictions, which [respectively indicate] as what [or where the afflictions] cease, through what they {57} cease, and what ceases.177 Thus, this explains that suchness is the basis of cessation, while the aspect that consists of the factors to be relinquished having been overcome through the path represents the nature of cessation. The same [text] continues: Through this specification, the defining characteristic of cessation is the [state of] being focused on suchness, in which contaminated entities have ceased.178 Thus, also the aspect that consists of the factors to be relinquished hav­ing been ceased through the path is explained as the reality of cessation. Therefore, the [reality of cessation] must be asserted as having the nature of a nonimplicative negation and an analytical cessation. This corresponds to the example of a place devoid of a vase and the aspect of said vase having"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 Groundless Paths been ceased in this [place] both representing the lack of said vase. Likewise, both the suchness of the mind streams of noble ones and the aspect of the factors to be relinquished having been ceased through the path within this [suchness] represent the reality of cessation. Therefore, the reality of cessa­tion is not necessarily suchness. Also, it is declared that the fully qualified reality of cessation must be the eradication of the seeds to be relinquished through the supramundane path, whereas the deterioration of the seeds to be relinquished through the mundane path represents the nominal reality of cessation. Consequently, suchness is not necessarily the reality of cessation. Furthermore, according to what is said in the Uttaratantra, the reality of ces­sation must be asserted as the change of state of the nature of the mind into its being free from stains. As for the reality of the path, the Abhidharmasamuccaya says: In brief, the defining characteristics of the path consist of, through this path, understanding suffering, relinquishing its origin, mani­festing cessation, and cultivating the path. {58} Furthermore, [the reality of the path] consists of the five paths-the path of accu­mulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of familiarization, and the path of nonlearning.179 Following this, the five paths are asserted as the reality of the path. However, some say that [Asailga] made this statement with the intention that [the paths of] accumulation and preparation are merely associated elements of the real­ity of the path, [such as Jinaputra's] Abhidharmasamuccayabhfi$ya [saying]: This division should be understood through the context of the real­ity of the path and its associated elements.180 Others say, \"Since the four dharmas [of the reality] of the path and the factors of purity, lucidity, and remedy181 are not complete in them, the path of nonlearning and the paths of accumulation and preparation are the result and the causes, respectively, [of the path]. Therefore since they are not fully qualified paths, solely the two [paths of] seeing and familiarization are fully qualified paths.\" Such statements amuse the gods because [Asailga's] com­mentary on the Uttaratantra says: As stated earlier, this [verse about the Buddha being the ultimate refuge explains that], because the sage, who is characterized by being unborn and unceasing, possesses the dharma.kaya free from attachment [that entails] the two realities of purification ... 182"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 85 Furthermore, if a buddha's conditioned realizations are not the path, they cannot be presented as any one of the four realities. Therefore, there would be clear realizations of the noble ones that are neither one of the four reali­ties. On the buddhabhfimi, there is neither any actual relinquishment of any factors to be relinquished nor any going higher than this [bhfimi], but it pos­sesses the unobstructed power of overcoming the factors to be relinquished, {59} the knowledge with the consummate power to deliver those to be guided into liberation, and the [power to] establish [beings] in an unmistaken state of mind. The great ones declared that both [the terms] \"yana\" and \"path\" refer to the two [meanings of] traveling by means of it and traveling in it. Also in this [Abhisamayalatrtkiira, verses IV.4-5] say that the thirty-nine aspects [of the knowledge of all aspects] are the reality of the path. Therefore, the path of nonlearning is justified as the reality of the path. As for [the paths of] accumulation and preparation, they are fully qualified · paths because they are yogas of realizing identitylessness, that is, clear realiza­tions which make one progress toward the enlightenment of one's respective yana. It may be argued, \"They are not paths because they are not able to eradicate the seeds to be relinquished and assess identitylessness as a mere object generality.\" In that case, manifest phenomena would necessarily never be factors to be relinquished because whatever is a remedy would necessarily overcome nothing but seeds. [Also,] whatever are hidden phenomena would necessarily never be realized because realizing them in the manner of object generalities would necessarily mean to not realize them. Therefore, just as the Lokayatas, one would have to accept that the only valid cognition that realizes objects is perception, and furthermore that there are no ordinary beings who enter the path, practice in such a way that means and prajfia are in union, and become irreversible from perfect enlightenment. lbb2) Defining characteristics Each reality has four aspects, [which makes a total of] sixteen. What are they? The first reality [has the aspects of] impermanence, suffering, being empty, {60} and being identityless; the second one, cause, origin, arising, and condition; the third one, cessation, peace, excellence, and final deliverance; and the fourth one, path, appropriateness, accomplishment, and being con­ducive to deliverance. Since the identifications of each one of these sixteen are explained in the text, I do not discuss them [here]. You may wonder, \"Why are they presented as sixteen?\" The first four, in due order, are the remedies for engaging in the views of permanence, plea­sure, mine, and self. The second four are the remedies for the views of there being no cause, a single cause, transformation, and premeditation. The third four are the remedies for the views of thinking that there is no liberation, that [what is actually] suffering is liberation, that the bliss of the dhyanas is"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 Groundless Paths excellence, and that liberation is not absolutely irreversible. The fourth four are the remedies for the views of thinking that there is no path, that this path is bad, that something else is also the path, and that this path is also reversible. Therefore, there are sixteen aspects because of these sixteen [kinds of] engag­ing in [wrong] views. Furthermore, the Viniscayasa1'flgrahal;li183 explains that the definition of the reality of suffering is \"the formations that arise from the afflictions.\" The defi­nition of the reality of the origin [of suffering] is \"what produces the reality of suffering.\" The definition of the reality of cessation is \"both of the [former two] being at utter peace.\" The definition of the reality of the path is \"what accomplishes the three aims.\" {61} lbc) Their being one or different The reality of cessation and the other three are different [in the sense] of negating their being the same. As for the other three, the reality of the path that consists of the meditative equipoises of noble ones and the two [realities of] suffering and its origin are different in substance, while the reality of the path that consists of the subsequent attainments [of said meditative equi­poises] is not contradictory to the reality of suffering. As for the two [realities] of suffering and its origin, the origin [of suffering] is necessarily the reality of suffering, but the reality of suffering is not necessarily the [former]. Examples [of suffering not being its origin] include the a.J.aya, the world as the container, the five sense faculties, and furthermore [all] unobscured and neutral con­taminated phenomena. lbd) Their definite number You may wonder, \"Why are the four realities definitely four in number?\" It is because the elements to be adopted and rejected, respectively, by the intel­ligent are definitely twofold as virtuous factors and dark factors, with each one being definite as a twofold [set] of cause and result. [However,] it is not that all knowable objects are included in the four realities because it is explained that suchness is not included in the four realities. It is also explained that nonanalytical cessation represents a [given] formation having [temporarily] subsided, but is not the reality of cessation and is not included in [any of] the other [realities] either. lbe) Their definite order The order [of the four realities] accords with the order in which those who first cultivate the path determine them. The Uttaratantra says: Just as a disease is to be known, the cause of the disease is to be relinquished,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 87 The state of well-being is to be attained, and medicine is to be relied upon, Suffering, its cause, its cessation, and likewise the path, respectively, Are to be known, to be relinquished, {62} to be reached, and to be relied upon. 184 lc) Explanation of the three jewels as the foundation [of practice] This has four parts: a) The natures of each one of the three refuges b) The three temporary refuges c) The single ultimate refuge d) Explanation of the term \"jewel\" lea) The natures of each one of the three refuges This has two parts: 1) [The system of] the sravaka faction 2) The system of the mahayana leal) As for the system of the sravakas, the Abhidharmakosa says: Those who take the threefold refuge Take refuge in the dharmas that constitute the Buddha and the saqtgha (Nonleamers and both [learners and nonleamers], respectively), And nirvaJ}.a, respectively. 185 Accordingly, to take refuge in the Buddha means to take refuge in the dhar­mas that constitute a buddha (a nonleamer). These consist of a buddha's knowledge of the termination and nonarising [of the obscurations]. Together with the associated factors [of this knowledge], they consist of the five uncon­taminated skandhas. To take refuge in the saqtgha means [to take refuge] in the dharmas that constitute the saqtgha, which consists of [all] learners and nonleamers except for buddhas. It is by virtue of having attained their respective [ dharmas] that the eight persons186 are not separated from the path by [anyone], including gods. Therefore, they are called \"saqtgha.\"187 In other words, [the saqtgha] is represented by the five uncontaminated skandhas in the mind streams of said eight persons. To take refuge in the dharma means [to take refuge] in the analytical ces­sation that is nirv�a, that is, the two nirv�as [with and without remainder] of the noble ones."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 Groundless Paths Here the system of the Vaibha�ikas asserts that the bodies [which serve as the physical] supports of a buddha and the sa�p.gha constitute the reality of suffering and therefore do not represent the [actual] buddha and sa�p.gha. {63} It may be said, \"But then, to cause blood to flow from the body of a buddha with an evil intention would not be an [action with] immediate consequence.\" To this, they answer, \"Through harming the support, what is supported is harmed too. Therefore, this constitutes an [action with] immediate conse­quence.\" [The commentaries on the Abhidharmakosa by Vasubandhu188 and Ya8omitra] say that since the treatise of master [Vasubandhu] has \"a buddha and the dharmas that constitute a buddha,\" it does not say that being a buddha is nothing but being a nonlearner. Since the [physical] support [of a buddha] is not negated as being a buddha, it is inappropriate to [raise the above] as an objection against his treatise. If the intention of his treatise were not like this, buddha and sa�p.gha would not be buddha and sa�p.gha when mundane states of mind manifest [in their mind streams]. For since [the minds of] learners and nonlearners are uncontaminated, they do not coexist in a manifest way with mundane states of mind. Therefore, at the time of [mundane states of mind arising], there are no [minds characteristic of] learners and nonleam­ers, nor is it that their [physical] supports represent [learners or nonlearners]. Thus, master [Vasubandhu]'s explanation about the [physical] support [also] being buddha is obviously the assertion of the Sautrantikas too. Consequently, except for just this difference, [both Vaibh�ikas and Sautrantikas] agree [on what a buddha is]. lca2) The system of the mahayana has three parts. First, as for the buddha, the Uttaratantra says: Unconditioned, effortless, Not realized through other conditions, And possessing wisdom, compassion, and power­This is buddhahood endowed with the two welfares.189 In due order, the [first] three [qualities of a buddha] are being empty of aris­ing, abiding, and ceasing; all efforts and conceptions being completely at peace; {64} and not being realized through [any] other conditions (such as terms and reasons), but having to be realized through a buddha's very own self-arisen wisdom. The [second] three [qualities] are realizing [the first] three just as they are; the loving-kindness of teaching them to others just as [oneself] realizes them; the power of relinquishing the suffering (the result) and the afflictions (the causes) of those to be guided through teaching [said three qualities]. The first three [qualities] represent one's own welfare and the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 89 following three, the welfare of others. Through counting these two bases of division, [the qualities of a buddha] are eight. Secondly, on the dharma, the Uttaratantra says: By virtue of its being inconceivable, nondual, nonconceptual, Pure, manifesting, and remedial, It is what is and what makes free from attachment, respectively­This is the dharma that is characterized by the two realities. Freedom from attachment consists of The two realities of cessation and the path. In due order, these two are to be understood Through three qualities each.190 In due order, the [first] three [qualities of the dharma] are not being an object of terms and conceptions, but being the object of the meditative equipoises of the noble ones; relinquishing contaminated karmas and afflictions as appropriate; and relinquishing the causes of these two-the mental states of superimposing purity, happiness, permanence, a self, and so on [onto them]. Among these, the first one represents the aspect of natural purity and the latter two, the one of being free from adventitious stains. The [second] three [qualities] are the nature of the path being pure of afflictions and secondary afflictions; elucidating the true reality of [all] knowable objects; and overcom­ing the darkness of the three poisons and so on. {65} Thus, the first one among these two sets of three [qualities] represents the reality of cessation and the latter one, the reality of the path. These six subdivisions [plus] their two bases of division make eight [qualities]. Here the commentary [by Asailga] explains that cessation and the path must be taken as the cessation and path of the mahayana and that the reality of the path consists of solely the mahayana [paths ofj seeing and familiarization.191 Thirdly, as for the srupgha, the Uttaratantra says: By virtue of the purity of the vision of the inner Wisdom of suchness and variety, The assembly of the irreversible intelligent ones Possesses unsurpassable qualities.192 In due order, [the srupgha] possesses the following four pure qualities. To be aware of suchness is to realize the [true] end of identitylessness in which the two identities of beings, called \"phenomena and persons,\" are at utter peace. To be aware of variety is to see that suchness empty of said two identities"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 Groundless Paths pervades all sentient beings. The awareness that is the vision of inner wisdom is to realize the two [former kinds of] wisdom in a self-aware manner. \"Purity\" refers to said vision being pure of both attachment (the afflictive obscura­tions) and obstruction (the cognitive obscurations), as appropriate. lcb) The three temporary refuges The Uttaratantra says: For the purpose of the teacher, the teaching, and the disciples, The three jewels are presented With regard to those in the three yanas And those who aspire for three activities.193 Accordingly, because of three purposes [described] in the common sfitras, in terms of six [types of] persons, the supreme one among those with two legs is presented as the Buddha; {66} the supreme one among what is free from attachment (nirWI}.a), as the dharma; and the supreme one among assemblies (the four pairs of persons), as the satpgha. The three purposes refer to teach­ing the qualities of the three refuges. The six [types of] persons are the persons who, from among the three refuges, [primarily] wish to perform activities for the Buddha, the dharma, and the sa�pgha, respectively, and the three [types of] persons who have the mahayana, sravaka, and pratyekabuddha dispositions, respectively. For in terms of the causal going for refuge, each one of those who possess said dispositions takes all three as refuges, but this [presentation here] is in terms of the fruitional going for refuge, which refers to the respective unique attainments [with regard to each one of the three refuges]. Thus, this way [of presenting them] is of expedient meaning because it is for the sake of progressively leading those who dwell in the three yanas to the mahayana. lee) The single ultimate refuge This is the Buddha alone. The Uttaratantra says: Ultimately, the refuge of the world Is buddhahood alone ... 194 You may wonder, \"But then the three refuges would not be complete in the ultimate refuge.\" There is no flaw because [the realities of] cessation and the path in the mind stream of a buddha represent the dharma and [a buddha], upon attaining the dharmakaya, also represents the consummation of the assemblies of the three yanas. The Uttaratantra says: Because the sage is the body of the dharma And because this is the consummation of the assembly.195"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"led) Explanation of the term \"jewel\" The Uttaratantra says: Translations: The General Topics 91 They are jewels because their appearance is difficult to encounter, {67} Because they are stainless, because they possess power, Because they are the ornaments of the world, Because they are supreme, and because they are changeless.196 ld) The instructions on the causes of excellent practice This has four parts: a) [The instructions on] relinquishing the antagonistic factors of practice b) [The instructions on] being independent of others in one's practice c) [The instructions on] completing all qualities of practice d) The instructions on the causes of the final practice Ida) The instructions on relinquishing the antagonistic factors of practice The main element of practice is vigor and its factors to be relinquished are three, as the Bodhicaryavatara [says]: Laziness in terms of clinging to what is bad, Discouragement, and self-contempt.197 Thus, first [there is] the instruction on the vigor of nonclinging as the means to relinquish clinging to idleness;198 secondly, the instruction on untiring vigor as the means to relinquish the laziness of discouragement; and thirdly, the instruction on the vigor of fully embracing the path as the means to relin­quish the laziness of self-contempt. ldb) The instructions on being independent of others in one's practice The instructions on being independent of others in one's practice, which take the five visions as their subject matter, have four parts: 1) Definitions 2) Boundary lines 3) Causes 4) Purpose ldbl) Definitions (a) The fleshly vision is the [cognizing] subject of individually ascertain­ing [all] entities within a range of one hundred yojanas199 up through a trichiliocosm."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 Groundless Paths (b) The divine vision is the subject of seeing [the manners] of all sentient beings in the ten directions dying and transiting elsewhere as well as their being reborn in a certain [place] fr om elsewhere. (c) The prajfia vision is the subject of not conceptualizing any conditioned or unconditioned phenomena as anything. {68} (d) The dharma vision is the subject of realizing the duller and sharper fa culties and so on of all noble persons. 200 (e) The buddha vision is the subject of realizing, that is, completely awak­ening into [directly] fa cing, all phenomena of suchness and variety. You may wonder, \"Are the objects of the first vision definite to be within the range of a trichiliocosm [at most]?\" The Vrtti says that its objects are defi­nite [in that sense] : This is because its objects are individually definite due to its arising fr om [karmic] maturation. Also, it is due to the fleshly vision being the subject of dominated results, which are included in the worldly realms of the greatest chiliocosm within a trichiliocosm.201 Thus, the fleshly vision is asserted as a special eye sense fa culty that arises from karmic maturation. Also the divine vision is asserted as arising from the mere maturation of virtuous karma. This is the position of Aryavimuk.tisena and master [Haribhadra]. The Brhattikii on the three [largest prajfiaparamita s\"ii tras] says: The fleshly vision is the cognition that engages all fo rms. The divine vision is the cognition of knowing all samadhis and meditative absorptions. The prajfia vision is omniscient wisdom. The dharma vision consists of the nine knowledges [among the ten powers of a buddha] except for the knowledge of what is the case and what is not the case. The buddha vision is the wisdom of the vajralike samadhi. 202 The large commentarf03 explains: The fleshly vision is the eye of [karmic] maturation that is established through the power of having cultivated the limbs of miraculous powers {69} and sees all big and small forms in a trichiliocosm. The magical vision or divine vision is [the vision] that is established through having cultivated the first dhyana and so on and sees all big and small fo rms in the ten directions and three times. The prajfia vision is nonconceptual wisdom. The dharma vision refers to the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 93 unimpeded engagement in the twelve branches of buddha speech. The buddha vision means to realize all phenomena that are con­taminated, uncontaminated, and so on. Furthermore, the large commentary also explains that the magical vision is a result of [either] karma or meditation. The first one refers to gods, through the power of their own individual karmas, having obtained eyes with lucid sense faculties and thus seeing forms in an unobstructed manner. The second one is explained as [the vision] obtained by yogins through the power of hav­ing cultivated samadhi, through which they see the deaths, transitions, and births of sentient beings. Here the magical vision refers to the divine vision. Kamalasila [says in his Prajfliiparamitdvajracchedikatika]: In brief, there are four kinds of vision-apprehending form, apprehending ultimate reality, apprehending seeming reality, and apprehending knowable objects in every aspect. To apprehend form is twofold-being a result of karma and being a result of meditation. 204 ldb2) Boundary lines The first two [visions] exist from the path of accumulation onward; the third one, from the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing; and the fourth one, from the subsequent attainment of the path of seeing. {70} As for the fifth one, in its approximately concordant form, it exists from the seventh bhiimi onward, and in its fully qualified form, on the buddhabhfimi alone. ldb3) Causes [The causes of the five visions] are to train in the six piiramitiis205 and to cultivate the limbs of miraculous power. ldb4) Purpose206 Their ultimate [purpose] is to become a buddha in the form of [attaining] unsurpassable enlightenment. Temporarily, when [bodhisattvas] accomplish the welfare of others, by virtue of knowing the means to that [end] by them­selves they do not depend on others. Ide) The instructions on completing all qualities of practice The instructions on completing all qualities of practice-the six supernatural knowledges-have five parts: 1) The levels that are their [mental] supports 2) The definitions [of the knowledges] that are supported [by these men­tal supports] 3} Superiority"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"94 Groundless Paths 4) Boundary lines 5) Purpose ldcl) The levels that are their [mental] supports [According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya,] the first five supernatural knowl­edges are accomplished on the basis of the pure form of any one of the four actual dhyanas, while the sixth one is accomplished based on the highest form of the fourth dhyana [alone].207 In the system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya, among all eight actual dhyanas and form[less absorptions], all those that are suitable as supports for special qualities are asserted as the highest forms of said dhyanas and the form[less absorptions] .208 The Abhidharmakosa says: The supernatural knowledge of termination is like the power.209 Thus, it explains that the supernatural knowledge of terminating contamina­tion is similar to the power of terminating contamination and [exists] on all levels, [including the formless ones]. Since this is the system of the Vaibh�ikas, it does not invalidate [the explanation in the Abhidharmasamuccaya]. Therefore, the Mahayanasiitralarrakara says: Having arrived at the very pure fourth dhyana, Through seizing nonconceptual wisdom And mentally engaging in proper abiding {71} The supreme accomplishment of power is attained.210 Thus, it states that if [bodhisattvas] who possess the fourth dhyana as support and nonconceptual wisdom as the basis mentally engage in the dharma as it is presented, they will accomplish the power [of the supernatural knowledges]. You may wonder, \"What are the [kinds of mental] abiding or mental engage­ment that accomplish the [six] supernatural knowledges?\" The first abiding means [to mentally engage in] the lightness of the body [in order to attain the supernatural knowledge of miraculous powers]. The second one refers to [mentally engaging in] all-pervading sound [in order to attain the super­natural knowledge of the divine ear]. [In order to attain the supernatural knowledge of knowing the minds of others,] the third one refers to being con­vinced that since certain states of mind appear in certain of one's own bodily [expressions], similar states of mind exist in others too because they possess similar bodily [expressions]. [In order to attain the supernatural knowledge of recollecting former states,] the fourth one means to mentally engage [in all the moments of this life] in reverse order, starting from the characteristic of the mental consciousness just having ceased [at death] down to the [moment ofj conception [in one's mother's womb]. The fifth one is [being mentally"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 95 engaged in all] directions being pervaded by appearances [in order to attain the supernatural knowledge of the divine eye] . The sixth one is the mental engagement in all phenomena being identityless [in order to attain the super­natural knowledge of knowing the termination of contamination]. You may wonder, \"What is the manner of these being supports [for the supernatural knowledges] as the supported?\" [The latter] are not supported as in the cases of a juniper bush being supported by its flowerpot, or the arising of a sprout being supported by its seed. So how is it then? The explanations on what is supported use the conventional term \"what is supported\" fo r what arises as the nature of a certain level [of dhyiina or meditative absorption]. This principle should be known [as applying] to all mental supports of the path; it is a terminology unique to the Abhidharmikas. ldc2) The definitions [of the knowledges] that are supported [by these mental supports] (a) The supernatural knowledge of miraculous powers represents the supernatural knowledge that has shaking the earth, one becoming many, many becoming one, and so on as its objects and {72} consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that make one display these [feats] in said manners. (b) The supernatural knowledge of the divine ear consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that make one hear all small and big sounds that exist in all worldly realms. (c) The supernatural knowledge of knowing the minds of others consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that make one know the minds of other sentient beings, such as their possessing desire or being free from attachment. (d) The supernatural knowledge of recollecting fo rmer states consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that [make one] recollect innumerable lifetimes of oneself and others. (e) The supernatural knowledge of the divine eye consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that make one see the deaths, transitions, and births of all sentient beings in the ten directions as well as their supreme, middling, and low physical fo rms. (f) The supernatural knowledge of knowing the termination of contami­nation consists of the samiidhi and prajfiii arisen from meditation that have relinquished, or make one relinquish, the seeds of the afflictive [ obscurations] (such as attachment), the cognitive obscurations that consist of the concep­tions about apprehender and apprehended, and so on. In the context of the divine ear, the sfttras say that it is beyond the human [ear], which is explained by Siigaramegha [in his Y ogiiciirabhiimaubodhisattva­bhiimivyakhyii] as referring to being accomplished through the dhyiinas."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 Groundless Paths Also, through the supernatural knowledge of knowing the minds of others, one knows their mental factors as well. However, based on [the motivation] that drives one at the time of first cultivating [this supernatural knowledge], it is explained as \"knowing the minds [of others].\" {73} Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra assert that the difference between the divine vision as a subdivi­sion of the five visions and the supernatural knowledge of the [divine] eye lies in the former arising from previous karma and the latter from having culti­vated the dhyanas in this life. The Abhidharmakosa says: The supernatural knowledges of the eye and ear Are neutral and the others are virtuous. 211 In the Abhidharmasamuccaya,212 all six are explained as their nature being prajfia and samadhi. The two [supernatural knowledges of the divine] eye and ear rely on the sense faculties and the remaining four, on mentation. ldc3) Superiority The Brhattika says: The supernatural knowledges of worldly people, sravakas, and pra­tyekabuddhas only know the minds and so on of those who are equal to them and those who are inferior to them, but the supernat­ural knowledge of completely pure bodhisattvas knows [even] the minds and so on of their superiors, such as a buddha bhagavan. 213 The Abhidharmakosa214 says that, in general, the supernatural knowledges are able to display the miraculous powers and so on of the respective levels they rely on and the levels below, but are not able to [do the same with respect to those] of the respective higher levels. ldc4) Boundary lines The first five [supernatural knowledges] are in common with non-Bud­dhists, but those of the mahayana exist from the great path of accumulation onward as appropriate. As for the supernatural knowledge of the termination of contamination, in general it exists in its fully qualified form in sravakas and pratyekabuddhas too, but [Haribhadra's] Vivru\"215 explains it to be the termination of the contaminations of both obscurations. The Suddhamatr16 explains that both the buddha vision and the supernatural knowledge of the termination of contamination are attained on the eighth [bhO.mi] {74} and are fully completed on the buddhabhO.mi. IdeS) Purpose [In his Vrtti,] Aryavimuktisena describes the meaning of the sO.tras [here] as follows:"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 97 [The supernatural knowledges are the means by which bodhisat­tvas] establish sentient beings in the equality of phenomena; are loved by all noble beings; encounter pleasant objects; are worthy of the gods' paying homage to them; and attain the prophecy [about their enlightenment]. 217 ldd) The instructions on the causes of the final practice These are the two instructions on the path of seeing and the path of famil­iarization. Though there is a difference between these two paths in terms of what they relinquish, there is no difference in terms of the manner in which they realize the nature of phenomena. For example, this is similar to there being no difference between laundry water before [it is used] and later in terms of its being water, but there being a difference in terms of the manner of its being pure of stains.218 2) Particular explanation of what is difficult to understand In the context of the instructions on the [three] jewels as the foundation [of practice], the sfitra [section] on the jewel of the satp.gha speaks of many divisions of the bodhisattva satp.gha.

As for those who cross to their fruitions in leaps, they are called \"those who cross in leaps\" in terms of their manner of attaining the fruitions, but in terms of their manner of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished, they are called \"those who have previously become free from attachment.\" The gradualists are gradualists in terms of both their manner of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished and their manner of attaining the fruitions. The simultaneists are presented as simultaneists in terms of their manner of relinquishing the fa ctors to be relinquished. 2aa3) With respect to which [among these three] approachers and abiders are presented Those who cross in leaps can only be fourfold-approachers and abiders of the two middle fruitions [among the above fo ur of stream-enterers and so on], whereas the other [fruitions] are impossible [for them]. The gradualists are presented as all eight approachers and abiders. As for the simultaneists, the Abhidharmasamuccaya219 and its commentaries explain that it is the two [fruitions of abiding] stream-enterers and arhats that [can] be designated [by this term]. However, it is suitable to extend it to the approachers of these two [fruitions] as well. 2aa4) The manner of attaining these fruitions has three parts: a) The paths through which these fruitions [are attained] b) The time when [they are attained] c) The levels based on which they are attained 2aa4a) The paths through which they are attained The paths that make one attain both said fruitions and the final end are necessarily supramundane paths. The middle two fruitions are attained by those who cross in leaps through the supramundane path. {76} The gradual­ists [can] attain [these two middle fruitions] through both the mundane path and the supramundane path. 2aa4b) The time when they are attained Both the fruitions of stream-enterers and those who cross in leaps are nec­essarily attained simultaneously with attaining the sixteenth [moment of the path of seeing]. The two fruitions of the gradualists are necessarily mani­fested after having attained said sixteenth [moment]. 2aa4c) The levels based on which they are attained Whatever is a path that makes one attain [the fruitions of] stream-enterer and once-returner necessarily relies on the preparatory stage of the first dhyana. The same goes for the [fruition ofj nonreturner of the gradualists. The"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 99 path that makes those who cross in leaps attain the [fruition of] nonreturner relies on any one of the six grounds of dhyana. Their fruition of arhathood is manifested by relying on any one of the nine uncontaminated grounds. 2ab) Teaching the nature of each one has three parts: 1) Those who cross in leaps 2) Gradualists 3) Simultaneists 2ab 1) Those who cross in leaps are twofold: a) Approachers b) Abiders 2ab1a) Approachers are again twofold. First, approaching once-returners pos­sess the following two [features of] relinquishment and realization. Through the mundane path before the path of seeing, they have [already] relinquished the sixth [degree of] the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiarization. They may or may not have relinquished the seventh or eighth [degrees] too, but have not relinquished the ninth one. Their distinctive fea­ture of realization is to abide on any one of the [first fifteen moments of the path of seeing] from the dharma readiness of suffering up through the subse­quent readiness of the path. Second, approaching nonreturners possess [the following features of] relin­quishment [and realization]. Through the mundane path before the path of seeing, they have [already] relinquished the ninth [degree of] the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiarization. {77} They may also be free or not be free from attachment toward any [levels of the higher realms], from the first dhyana up through Nothing Whatsoever. Their dis­tinctive feature of realization is as in the previous one. There are also some who [take] the Abhidharmasamuccaya's reasoning of the path of preparation being [the lower boundary line of] the first approacher [(the one to the frui­tion of a stream-enterer) and] extrapolate it to these [two approachers here], thus taking their lower boundary lines to be the path of preparation too. 2ab 1 b) As fo r the a biders, the above [two kinds of] approachers later become abiders in the fruitions of once-returner and nonreturner, respectively, upon their attaining the sixteenth [moment of the path of seeing]. The above approachers who are of duller faculties (\"pursuers by means of confidence\") and those of sharper faculties (\"pursuers by means of the dharma\"), upon later attaining their [respective] fruitions, bear the conventional designations \"those who are convinced through confidence\" and \"those who attain through seeing,\" respectively."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 Groundless Paths 2ab2) Gradualists are fo urfold: a) Stream-enterers b) Once-returners c) Nonreturners d) Arhats 2ab2a) Stream-enterers are twofold: a) Approachers b) Abiders 2ab2aa) According to the Abhidharmakosa, approaching [stream-enterers] dwell on [any one of the first fifteen moments of the path of seeing] from the dharma readiness of suffering up through the subsequent readiness of the path.220 According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya,221 they dwell on [any level] from the path of preparation up through the subsequent readiness of the path. In any case, they have not relinquished the sixth [degree of] the afflic­tions of the desire realm. When divided, they are twofold-those who have not relinquished even one [degree] of the factors to be relinquished through familiarization before the path of seeing and those who have relinquished any [number] from one up to five [degrees of said factors to be relinquished]. 2ab2ab) Abiding [stream-enterers] are the sravakas who, in addition to being endowed with the above [degrees of] relinquishment, have attained the six­teenth [moment of the path of seeing]. As for their distinct features, {78} based on said [state], there are two [types]-( 1) those who [take rebirth] seven times and (2) those who are born from family to family. (1) Their distinctive fe ature of relinquishment is that they have not relinquished even one [degree of] the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiariza­tion. Their distinctive feature of realization is that they abide in the fruition of stream-enterer. Their distinctive feature of birth is that they take seven rebirths in the desire realm. As fo r the manner of being reborn, if they attain [the fruition of] stream-enterer in the [psychophysical] support of a human, they take [rebirth] as a human six times, then seven times as a god, and finally pass [into nirvat).a] after having [again] been born as a human. If they attain [the fruition of stream-enterer] in the [psychophysical] support of a god, they take [rebirth] as a god six times, then seven times as a human, and finally pass [into nirvaQ.a] after having [again] been born as a god. In this way, [alto­gether,] they take twenty-eight [existences]-fourteen existences of being born as gods and humans and fo urteen existences in the intermediate state. 222 However since said [four] sets of seven are similar, they are called \"those who [take rebirth] seven times,\" just like a bh�u who is learned in seven fields [(that is, in various sets of seven)] and a tree with seven leaves [(that is, whose leaves grow in sets of seven)]."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 101 (2) Those who are born from family to family also have three distinctive fea­tures-the relinquishment of having relinquished the third or fourth [degrees of] the afflictions of the desire realm [to be relinquished through familiar­ization], but not having relinquished the fifth one; the realization of having attained the remedy of these [afflictions], the uncontaminated faculties; and taking two or three rebirths in a similar class of humans or gods in the desire realm. As for their not having relinquished the fifth [degree of the afflictions of the desire realm], if one relinquishes the fifth one, the sixth one will be relinquished too since it is not necessary to go beyond the [desire] realm [to do so]. However, in that case, one would [already] be a once-returner. This [implies that, in terms of] the relinquishment of the factors to be relinquished through familiarization, there are both those [stream-enterers] who [are born from family to family and] have [already] relinquished [the third and fourth degrees of the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiar­ization] before the sixteenth [moment of the path of seeing] and those who relinquish them thereafter. 2ab2b) Once-returners are twofold: a) Approachers b) Abiders {79} 2ab2ba) When abiders in the fruition of stream-enterer make efforts in order to attain [the fruition of] once-returner, [their range as approaching once­returners includes] those who have relinquished none or up to five [degrees of] the factors to be relinquished through familiarization up through those who make efforts to relinquish the sixth one. 2ab2bb) Once these approachers have relinquished the sixth [degree] of the afflictions of the desire realm, they are once-returners. While they are abid­ing in the path of liberation of having relinquished said sixth [degree], they are mere abiders in the fruition, and when they make efforts to relinquish the [following degrees] up through the ninth one, they are special [abiders]. [The once-returners who are separated from attaining nirvWJ,a by] a single interval of one lifetime are special cases of the latter [abiders]-they have relinquished the seventh and eighth [degrees] of the afflictions [of the desire realm], have attained their remedy (the uncontaminated faculties), and have a single remaining rebirth [in the desire realm] left. 2ab2c) Nonreturners are twofold: a) Approachers b) Abiders 2ab2ca) Approaching [nonreturners] are said once-returners who make efforts to relinquish the seventh up through the ninth [degrees of the afflic­tions of the desire realm]."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 Groundless Paths 2ab2cb) Once these approachers have relinquished the ninth [degree of the] factors to be relinquished through familiarization, they are nonreturners, which are twofold: 1) Those who progress to higher realms 2) Those who pass [into nirvil)a] in their present [psychophysical] sup­ports [in the desire realm] 2ab2cbl) The first are threefold: a) [Those who progress to the] form [realm] b) Those who progress to the formless [realm] c) Consideration of their supports 2ab2cbla) The first are threefold: a) [Those who pass into nirvil)a] in the intermediate [state] b) Those who pass into nirvil)a after birth c) Those who progress higher 2ab2cblaa) [Those who pass into nirvil)a in the intermediate state] are the nonreturners who, after having been born in any one of the sixteen inter­mediate states of the form [realm] except for [the one ot] Mahabrahmil)a, pass into nirvil)a in this [respective intermediate state as their psychophysi­cal] support.

Since the first are those for whom the path arises very naturally and whose contaminants are very small, they are different from the second [two]. This also accords with the Abhidharmasamuccaya.225 Those who pass into nirvil)a after birth and are born in the five pure abodes [of the form realm] must familiarize with the alternating [cultivations of dhyana explained below]. 2ab2cblac) Those who progress higher are the nonreturners who pass into nirvil)a after having passed through birth existences in the form realm two"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 103 times.

(a) As fo r the leapers, when they have accomplished familiar­izing with the nve [levels of] the alternating [cultivation of dhyanas], they experience the taste of the first dhyana and {81} regress from the latter three dhyanas, thus being reborn in Brahmakayika. There, through the fo rce of their fo rmer familiarization, they alternate the fo urth dhyana [in its contami­nated and uncontaminated fo rms] and skip the ones in between, thus being born in Akani�tha and then passing into nirvaQa [there]. (b) The half-leapers, after having been born in Brahmakayika and having skipped the [dhyanas] in between as before, are reborn in [a certain one of] the pure abodes while skipping some others and [finally] pass into nirvaQa in Akani�tha.

The Abhidharmakosabh�ya explains that noble ones are not reborn in MahabrahmaQa because [Mahabrahma] has accumulated the karma of being without rival since there is only a single sovereign [there], and because this is an abode of wrong views.226 [However,] according to the mahayana, these reasons are not definite. This will be understood through the maturational rebirths of great bodhisattva& who have attained the bhftmis, which will be explained [below].227 You may wonder, \"What is the manner of the alternating cultivation of the causes fo r said [nonreturners] being born in the pure abodes?\" The criti­cal analysis of this has two parts-(1) the [psychophysical] supports of this cultivation and (2) the cultivation supported [by them]. (1) The [psychophys­ical] supports of this cultivation are that arhats and nonreturners cultivate it through having attained the mental state of the fourth dhyana. First, they practice this alternating [cultivation] on the three continents [i.e., except fo r Uttarakuru] of the desire realm. Later, those who have regressed [from the latter three dhyanas] practice the alternating [cultivation] in the fo rm realm. (2) The cultivation supported [by them is explained] in three parts-(a) the practice of alternating, (b) the gauge of accomplishment, and (c) the actual alternating.

They first alternate the fourth [dhyana] in this way because this fo urth one is a workable and lucid samadhi by virtue of its being free from the eight flaws [of samadhi] (examination, analysis, mental pleasure and displeasure, inhalation, exhalation, and physical pleasure and suffering). (b) As for the gauge of [this alternation] being accomplished, [in Abhidharmakosa Vl.42b,] the Vaibha�ika system explains that it is accom­plished based on instants. However, master [Vasubandhu]'s autocommentary [on this] says: Only buddhas are able to alternate instants. Therefore, [all others] complete [the alternating cultivation] when they [are able to] enter [each one of said] three prolonged meditative absorptions fo r as long as they wish. 228 After having alternated [the contaminated and uncontaminated fo rms of] the fourth dhyana in this manner, they later also alternate the other dhyanas [in the same way]. (c) The actual alternating [cultivations of dhyana] represents the causes that result in being reborn in the five pure abodes, which consist of the five [levels of] alternating cultivation [ranging] from alternating three [contami­nated and uncontaminated dhyanas as above] up through alternating fifteen. [However,] the alternating cultivations are not definite as being these five [only] because it is explained that these five refer to only alternating the fourth [dhyana], whereas [nonreturners] also alternate the others. As fo r the manner of alternating these [dhyanas], to alternate three by inserting a contaminated one between two uncontaminated ones [is small alternating]; to alternate six through repeating this, medium; to alternate nine, great; to alternate twelve, greater; and to alternate fifteen, greatest. You may think, \"Since the manner of alternating is thus not different fo r the remaining ones [after the small one], {83} one will be able to [accomplish] all [five levels] if one is able to alter­nate three [dhyanas].\" There is no flaw because one is [only] able to alternate the respective set (such as [only] alternating three [dhyanas first]) of each given stage, but one is not able to alternate the others [of the respective higher stages]. Here the [actual] causes for being reborn in the five pure abodes are the contaminated [ dhyanas within these alternating cultivations] because the uncontaminated ones sever [ saip.siiric] existence.

However, the Sautrantikas hold that regressing from arhathood is impossible and that they can only regress from [the samadhi of] blissfully abiding amidst visible phenomena. 231 Also the brother masters [Asailga and Vasubandhu] take this [latter position] to be excellent. 2ab3) Simultaneists Having manifested the path of seeing before attaining the mental states of the dhyanas, through the supramundane path that relies on the prepara­tory stage of the first [dhyana] {85} they relinquish the factors of the three realms to be relinquished through familiarization by combining them in [the sets of their] nine [respectively corresponding degrees]. They mostly become arhats before the time of dying or when they are dose [to dying], but if they do not attain [arhathood], they pass into nirvaQa in a [psychophysical] sup­port of having been reborn in the desire realm. If that coincides with [a time when] the scriptural teachings have disappeared, during their last existence they attain enlightenment without depending on a master and thus become pratyekabuddhas. Through this, one should understand that, even during the time when they are training, they are not necessarily sravakas. 2ac) The reasons for the fruitions being definite as four Stream-enterers are presented by virtue of their merely having relin­quished the factors to be relinquished through seeing; once-returners, by virtue of having relinquished, from among the two [kinds of] factors to be relinquished through familiarization, the sixth [degree] of the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiarization; and nonreturners, by virtue of having relinquished the ninth [degree of said factors to be relin­quished].

Having come from Akani�tha to Tu�ita and then to Jambudvipa, they go forth from their home and generate bodhicitta immediately upon assuming the cross-legged [posture] under the bodhi tree. Thus, they pass [into nirviil}.a] with the remainder of their skandhas. 238 (c) The third are those who pass [into nirviil}.a] with effort. They are the great bodhisattvas who engage in the six piiramitiis, proceed from mundane realm to mundane realm, and always make efforts for the welfare of sentient beings. They pass [into nirvat)a] with effort because they make efforts for the welfare of sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 Groundless Paths (d) The fourth are those who pass [into nirvil)a] without effort.

They are those who pass [into nirvat)a] without effort because they, by virtue of their distinct disposi­tion, become enlightened very swiftly. (e) The fifth are those who progress to the form [realm], who are twofold. ( 1) The first are those who progress to Akani�tha, [who consist of] the three [kinds of] leapers. (1a) The leaper bodhisattvas are the great bodhisattvas who practiced the four dhyanas, regressed from [the higher three] dhyanas, and thus are born as gods of Brahmakayika through practicing [only] the first dhyana. {90} Having practiced the dhyanas [there], they become bud­dhas in Akani�tha and then [display] awakening to unsurpassable perfect enlightenment in various [buddha] realms. (1b) The half-leaper bodhisattvas are those who died in, and transited from, the Brahma world and then are [born in one of the lower pure abodes]. Next, through skipping one or two of these pure abodes, they are [finally] born in Akani�tha (the rest is as above). (1c) The bodhisattvas who [are born,] die in, and transit through all abodes are the great bodhisattvas who display their own body like the body of a tathagata and thus train in the abode of Tu�ita. Then, they are born among the gods of Brahmakayika up through Akani�tha. Since they are skilled in means, they teach the dharma [even] to beings in the lower realms. (2) The bodhisattvas who progress to the highest peak of existence are the great bodhisattvas who attained the dhyanas and form[less absorptions], take birth from Brahmakayika up through Consummate Virtue, and then from Infinite Space up through the Peak of Existence. [Finally,] they are born in various buddha realms. 239 (f) The sixth are the bodhisattvas who overcame attachment to the form realm and progress to the formless [realm]. They are the great bodhisattvas who entered the dhyanas and form[less absorptions], are born from Infinite Space up through the Peak of Existence, and then are born in various buddha realms. After having died in, and transited from, here [(the desire realm)], they are born in the formless [realm] without going to the form [realm).240 (g) The seventh are the bodhisattvas of passing into peace (nirvat)a) amidst visible phenomena (this lifetime). They are the great bodhisattvas whose bod­ies, while engaging in the six paramitas, are ornamented with the thirty-two marks of a great being and {91} who are endowed with completely pure and unsurpassable faculties.

They are those of \"peace amidst visible phenomena\" because those who see these great bodhisattvas will pass into nirvru,a.241 (h) The eighth are the bodhisattvas who are a bodily witness. They are the great bodhisattvas who engage in the mother and entered the dhyanas, formless [absorptions], and immeasurables up through the meditative absorption of cessation. Then, having entered the [meditative absorption of] crossing in one leap, they become buddhas in various buddha realms. [The Abhidharmakosabh�ya242 says that] one may wonder why they are called \"those who are a bodily witness\" [and answers that] it is because they gen­erate the nirvru,alike meditative absorption of cessation based on the body, which is without mind. This explanation accords with the Vaibha�ikas. Master Vasubandhu243 holds that, when having risen from the meditative absorption of cessation, [one's mind] is very peaceful in that this cessation is similar to nirvru,a. Through the mind being in absorption, the body, which is associ­ated with consciousness, attains a hitherto unattained [state of the] afflictions being at peace. Therefore, [this is called] \"bodilywitness.\"244 2bc4) [According to the sfttras,] the bodhisattvas who bear the name \"rhinolike\" [pratyekabuddhas] are the great bodhisattvas who awaken to self-enlightenment in a com­pletely perfect way in a worldly realm in which no buddhas reside and in which there are no sravakas either. Having matured limitless sentient beings through the three yanas, they awaken to unsurpass­able perfect enlightenment.245 {92} In this way, through emphasizing duller and sharper faculties, [Aryavimuktisena] teaches three [approachers]-the first approacher [to the fruition of stream-enterer] and the two approachers among those who have previously become free from attachment. Through [speaking of] \"[those who are convinced through] confidence\" and \"those who attain through seeing,\" he teaches both abiders in the fruitions [of once-returner and nonreturner] among those who have previously become free from attachment. He skips those who progress to Akani�tha because they represent the basis for the divi­sion into the three leapers. The others are counted literally [as they appear in the Abhisamayala,kara]. (B) According to the assertions of master Haribhadra, stream-enterers are twofold-approachers and abiders. The approachers are twofold (being of sharper and duller faculties). The abiders are [also] twofold (mere and special ones), with the special ones consisting of the two [types of] being born [from family to] family."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 Groundless Paths Once-returners are twofold (approachers and abiders), with the abiders being [also] twofold (mere and special).

Those who progress higher are twofold (those who progress to Akani�tha and those who overcame attachment to the fo rm [realm] and prog­ress to the Peak of Existence). Those who progress to Akani�tha consist of the three leapers and those who overcame attachment to the fo rm [realm] are twofold ([those who attain] peace amidst visible phenomena and those who are a bodily witness). In this way, there are five stream-enterers, three once-returners, and ten nonreturners. In addition, there are approaching arhats and pratyekabud­dhas, which makes twenty [altogether]. Thus, the intention of the Vivrti and the AbhisamayalaJ?1karaloka consists of supplementing the seventeen that are taught in the root text [of the AbhisamayalaJ?1kara] by three.246{93} It may be said, \"In this, to take the subdivisions of those who progress to the Peak of Existence ([those who attain] peace amidst visible phenomena and those who are a bodily witness) is contradictory.\" [Ar] Jangchub Yeshe247 explains that Tril�a says [the fo llowing on this] . In terms of the sravakas, this is true, but [in the mahayana,] it is not contradictory because all that is explained is the fo llowing. It is [merely] by virtue of bodhisattvas having cul­tivated all eight dhyanas and fo rm [less absorptions] that they are called \"those who progress to the highest peak of existence.\" Also, it is Uust] by virtue of their being able to enter the fo rmless samadhis that they are [called] \"those who overcame attachment to the fo rm [realm].\" 2bd) Considering through what they are illustrated You may wonder, \"If it is fo r reasons of similarity that these [types of the bodhisattva] sa.rpgha are taught by giving hinayana names to mahayana [per­sons], how do [the hinayana persons] exemplify [the latter]?\" Aryavimuktisena explains them as being similar to those who cross in leaps and the gradual­ists, while Haribhadra explains all of them as being similar to the gradualists. However, nobody's commentary explains this by matching [said bodhisat­tvas] with the simultaneists. \"Through how many similar fe atures are they matched?\" They are matched through three-relinquishment, realization, and the manners of taking rebirth. However, according to the statements of great beings, it is definite that the presentation of bodhisattvas as sravaka stream­enterers, once-returners, and so on in dependence on their relinquishment is only a presentation [that is made out] of the wish to demonstrate the special reasons, in terms of the respectively concordant fe atures, fo r giving the names of the [latter] to the [former] . However, this is not a presentation by way of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 113 asserting that [the relinquishments of bodhisattvas] accord with the progres­sion of the relinquishments of sravakas. {94} 2be) The instruction on other distinctive fe atures has three parts: 1) The difficult points in the slitras 2) Boundary lines of the [types of] sa�p.gha 3) Considering whether these are fully qualified or nominal 2bel) The difficult points in the slitras It may be said, \"It is not justified for noble bodhisattvas to be born as long­living gods.\" [There is no flaw] because they are presented as being of duller faculties when they are born as such [gods] in a former life and later attain the path of the noble ones among humans. Also, it may be objected, \"The explanation that those who progress to the Peak of Existence and those who overcame attachment to the form [realm] are born in the formless [realm] contradicts the explanation in the [Prajftaparamita]sarrrcayagatha and so on that bodhisattvas are not born in the formless [realm].\" There is no flaw-to say that they are born [there] bears the intention of their merely having attained the causes for being born there, which are the formless meditative absorptions. Yet another [qualm] is as follows. \"In the context of the three leapers, it is explained that [bodhisattvas] experience the taste of the first dhyana, thus regressing from the latter three, and that they are born in divine abodes under the influence of dhyana. This is not reasonable [because] such is contradictory in bodhisattvas who have entered high bhlimis.\" There is no flaw. For the first [explanation] has in mind certain noble bodhisattvas of duller fa culties who are not skilled in means or it has in mind that they experienced said taste when they were ordinary beings. The second [explanation means that] they are born as they wish through relying on mental states of meditative absorption. 2be2) Boundary lines Aryavimuktisena's position is to say that the two pursuers [by means of confidence and the dharma, respectively,] are [bodhisattvas] on the path of seeing and that the remaining are on the path of familiarization. In particu­lar, the fourth approacher [(the approaching arhat)] is on the tenth bhli.mi. Master {95} [Haribhadra] asserts that mere stream-enterers are on the path of seeing and that the remaining are on the path of familiarization. In any case, it is [to be] understood that it is not tenable to match these with the bhlimis in due order because the slitras explain in the context of the pursuers by means of the dharma and the ones separated by a single [lifetime] that [both] are [bodhisattvas] separated [from buddhahood] by a single birth."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 Groundless Paths 2be3) Considering whether these are fully qualified or nominal You may wonder, \"Are these explanations here of [bodhisattvas] being stream-enterers and so on actual terms [for them] or nominal?\" They are nominal. The basis of intention [behind using these names for bodhisattvas] is to have in mind the reasons for applying the mere terms \"stream-enterer\" and so on [to them] as [they are stated] in the A vaivartacakrasutra. 248 The pur­pose is to use the designations of the four pairs of persons [in the hinayana] in order to counteract [the wrong ideas of] those who are not convinced about bodhisattvas belonging to the srupgha, thinking, \"The srupgha consists solely of the four pairs of sravaka persons.\" The invalidation of the explicit [mean­ing of said terms] is that [if they were taken literally,] there would be fully qualified sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats who are bodhisattvas and that, consequently, the three yanas would be mixed up. This concludes the sequence of explanations on the instructions [as the second point of the knowledge of all aspects]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3. The branches conducive to penetration (the fruition of the instructions) This has two parts: 1) The [psychophysical] supports for the arising of the path of preparation 2) The path of preparation as what is supported [by them] {96} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.1. The [psychophysical] supports for the arising of the path of preparation First, on the physical supports, the autocommentary [on the Abhidharmakosa] explains: Three [of the branches conducive to penetration] are gener­ated among humans only and on the three continents [i.e., except Uttarakuru]. Those who have generated them [already] before can also manifest them among the gods. The fourth one is also gener­ated among the gods.249 Therefore, [the branches conducive to penetration] must arise in the [same physical] support in which the path of seeing arises. The mental support is [that their arising] primarily relies on any one of the six grounds of dhyana. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2. The path of preparation as what is supported [by them] This has four parts: 1) Nature 2) Divisions 3) Examining which mental state is divided 4) The distinctive fe atures [of the mahayana path of preparation]"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Nature This has two parts: 1) Common [nature] 2) The nature of each [of its branches] 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Common nature Translations: The General Topics 115 [The nature of the path of preparation] is the realization [that arises] through study, reflection, and meditation, among which the one arisen from medita­tion is primary. 250 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.2. The nature of each [of its branches )251 Except for mental discourse, bodhisattvas in meditative equipoise do not see [outer] referents (such as forms), but see nothing but said mental dis­course appearing as specifically and generally characterized phenomena. This samadhi of attaining illumination or the first poised readiness of realizing the dharma represents [the level of] heat [of the path of preparation]. To make steady efforts, through the activity of nonabiding, in order to increase said illumination of the dharma that was attained on [the level of] heat is the samadhi of the increase of illumination-[the level of] peak. Through making such efforts, the illumination of the dharma {97} increases greatly and [bodhisattvas] abide in mere mind, realizing that what appear as objects are nothing but inner mind. Then they see that what appear as refer­ents are nothing but mind, but not anything other than mind. At this point, they have relinquished the distractions of the apprehended and solely the dis­tractions of the apprehender remain. This means that they have entered one side [of true reality]-the lack of the apprehended. Since this is followed by the lack of the apprehender [later] , it represents the samadhi of entering one side of true reality-[the level of] poised readiness. [Bodhisattvas] who have relinquished the distractions of the apprehended in this way and then abide merely in the distractions of the apprehender think, \"If there is thus nothing apprehended, it is not reasonable for there being an apprehender either.\" Thus, through immediately relinquishing [any] attachment to an apprehender too, they arrive at the immediately following samadhi, which is thus called \"the immediate samadhi.\" It is [also] called \"immediate samadhi\" because the first bhftmi is entered immediately at the end of this [samadhi], which is the supreme dharma. In this way, through the first three [branches], [bodhisattvas] find certainty, arisen from meditation, about the lack of the apprehended. However since they [still] cling to mere mind, the distractions of the apprehender have not subsided [yet] . Through the fourth [branch], they find certainty, arisen from meditation, about the lack of the apprehender because they do not even cling to mere mind.252 Thus, these four [branches] are also called \"engagement"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116 Groundless Paths through aspiration\" because [bodhisattvas] greatly aspire for the actuality of identitylessness. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.2. Divisions If divided by nature, [the path of preparation] has the four [levels of] heat, peak, poised readiness, and supreme dharma. {98} If divided in terms of great, medium, [and lesser] , it is twelvefold since each [of these four levels] has three [sublevels]. Furthermore, the two of heat and peak, poised readiness, and supreme dharma, respectively, are explained to be the lesser, medium, and great poised readinesses of mind being certain about the dharma. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.3. Examining which mental state is divided It is not asserted that the meditative equipoises of the path of preparation are direct perceptions of the actuality of identitylessness. For then it would follow that there could be occasions of the afflicted mind not operating in a mani­fe st manner in the mind streams of ordinary beings because when a mental state of directly realizing identitylessness is manifest, this excludes [the pres­ence of] any manifest views about identity. Hence, on the path of preparation, [mind's] being focused on identitylessness represents mental states of assess­ing an object generality through apprehending, in an aspiring manner, the object generality of identitylessness that appears to these [mental states]. Therefore, they are conceptions for which terms and their referents appear [as being contlated].253 On [the path of preparation, which represents] the nondeterioration of the mental formations of having gained certainty about the meanings of the four realities through reasoning on the path of accumula­tion, there exist both repetitive cognitions of recollecting [said certainty] and inferential cognitions of some particular fe atures of identitylessness.254 In this way, though the path of preparation, in its own nature, consists of mistaken [forms of] cognition, unlike the mental states of ordinary persons it does not represent cognitions that are mistaken in all aspects. For it is pro­duced through the flourishing of the latent tendencies for listening that are the natural outflow of the pure dharmadhatu. 255 Seeing this point, Maitreya says [in his Madhyantavibhaga]: Familiarization is approximately concordant yet mistaken, {99} Connected yet opposite, As well as unmistaken and never Connected with mistakenness. 256 When commenting on this, the supreme scholar Vasubandhu's [Bh�ya] 257 says that ( 1) the mistaken cognition that is approximately concordant with"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 117 unmistakenness is the path of familiarization of ordinary beings. (2) The path of fa miliarization of noble learners is still connected with the mistaken fa ctors to be relinquished through familiarization, but its own nature is unmistaken. (3) The path of familiarization of noble nonlearners is neither mistaken [in itself] nor connected [with any mistakenness]. [Sthiramati's] Tfka258 says that ( 1) refers to familiarizing with the foundations of mindfulness up through the [five] powers, while (2) represents fa miliarizing with the seven branches of enlightenment up through the [eight] fold path [of the noble ones].2 59 Therefore, without even listening to it, the learned reject the assertion of there being any direct realization of the nature of phenomena by those who see just this life, but accept [the position] that accords with [the following statements]. The omniscient Santar�ita says: Since the minds of all who just see this life Are wrong about this, Not even the slightest real entity Is established through direct perception.260 [The Uttaratantra] by the regent of the victor states: Since it is subtle, it is not an object of study. Since it is the ultimate, it is none of reflection. Since it is the depth of the nature of phenomena, It is none of worldly meditation and so forth, Because childish beings have never seen it before, Just like those born blind [have never seen] form.261 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.

Considering it in particular You may wonder, \"Do these conceptions possess the aspect of being affirmed or negated?\" {101} Though most earlier [masters] assert them to be concep­tions in terms of being negated, they are not taught as conceptions to be negated anywhere in the root text and its commentaries. Therefore, they should be asserted as being conceptions in terms of being affirmed. \"If they are not conceptions in terms of being negated, how do they become a distinctive fe ature [of the mahayana path of preparation]?\" It is not that these concep­tions become such a distinctive fe ature by virtue of being [conceptions] that possess the aspect of being negated, but they do so by virtue of being associ­ated [with the path of preparation] as the fa ctors to be relinquished by its own results since they can be terminated by the paths of seeing and fa miliarization that are produced by it. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.1.2. The objects that are conceptualized [The objects] are two-apprehender and apprehended. You may wonder, \"But what do these apprehender and apprehended refer to?\" In general, Buddhists have three ways of presenting apprehender and apprehended-in terms of the ayatanas, cognition and what is cognized, and a self and what is mine. In the first case, the six objects are the apprehended and the six sense fa culties are the apprehender. In the second case, all matter is the apprehended and all cognition is the apprehender. In the third case, the self is the apprehender and what is mine is the apprehended. [The discussion] here is in terms of the latter [model] . The apprehended consists of what is experienced by a substantial or imputed self (that is, what is enjoyed). The apprehender is that which experiences the [former] (that is, the enjoyer) . Though the latter is explained [in the Abhisamayalatrlkilra] to be conceived of as a self or a sentient being, these [two] are not what is actually [conceptualized here]. Rather, [the apprehended] is taken to be the bases of superimposing said [two]-the mere phenomena of skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas. Though [bodhisattvas] do not cling to the latter as being a perma­nent, single, and independent person who is the apprehender of objects, { 102} the superimposition of an apprehender onto said mere phenomena that are devoid of such a self does arise [in them]. Thus, the conceptions [about the apprehender] are twofold-clinging to said phenomena through taking them"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120 Groundless Paths to be substantially established entities ultimately and through taking them to be mere imputations that are not established ultimately. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.1.3. The manner of conceptualizing You may wonder, \"How do conceptions cling to these objects?\" Through focusing on afflicted and purified apprehended [objects], respectively, the manner of clinging of the first [type ofj conceptions about the apprehended is to cling [to the former objects] as being discordant, thinking, \"This is some­thing apprehended that is to be absolutely rejected,\" and to cling [to the latter] as being concordant, thinking, \"This is something apprehended that is to be absolutely adopted.\" The manner of clinging of the second [type ofj conceptions about the apprehended is to cling [to said objects] by respectively thinking, \"Since this is the path of the hinayana, I must turn away from it\" and \"Since this is the path of the mahayana, I must engage in it.\"266 The manner of clinging of the two [types ofj conceptions about the appre­hender is to cling by respectively thinking, \"The apprehender or experiencer of objects is this substantially established basis for imputing a person\" or \"[It is] this merely imputed basis for imputing such [a person].\" Thus, when [the Abhisamayala111kara speaks] here of \"sentient beings\" and \"individuals,\" what it has in mind from among the pair of personal and phenomenal [identities] are not exclusively persons, but it refers to what indicates a mere apprehender of objects. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.1.4. The subdivisions of the conceptions The basic [division of conceptions] is twofold-conceptions about the appre­hended and conceptions about the apprehender. The conceptions about the apprehended are twofold-conceptions about the apprehended in terms of the set of afflicted phenomena {103} and conceptions about the appre­hended in terms of the set of purified phenomena. The conceptions about the apprehender are twofold-conceptions of apprehending substances and conceptions of apprehending imputations. Each one of these four [types of conceptions about apprehender and apprehended] is ninefold. The nine objects to which the first [type of] conceptions about the appre­hended [in terms of afflicted phenomena] clings are (1) the ignorance of being dull about karma (causes and results) and true reality, (2) the five contami­nated skandhas (such as form) that are produced by the karma motivated by that ignorance, (3) clinging to the four [skandhas that are] names and [the one ofj form as being a self and what is mine, ( 4) through the views about extremes, clinging to objects-to which one [already] clings through the views about a real personality-as [falling under] the two extremes of being permanent or"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 121 extinct, (5) through clinging in this way, not knowing the fa ults and qualities of afflicted and purified phenomena, respectively, ( 6) by virtue of not under­standing this, not abiding on the path of the noble ones from generosity up through the unique [buddhadharmas], (7) through deviating from the path in this way, fo cusing on phenomena in a mistaken way, (8) through such mis­taken fo cusing, [experiencing] attachment to the aspect of \"self' and aversion toward the aspect of \"others,\" and (9) the suffering ([including] also the con­taminated [virtuous karmas] that produce the higher realms) that indirectly produces purity-nirvaJ)a-being the cause for weariness [with sa�p.sara].

The first nine conceptions about the apprehender are the conceptions about (1) a self being an independent [apprehender] that is not contingent on any other apprehender of objects, (2) the self being something singular without a companion, (3) the self being the cause that provides the room fo r consciousness, (4) the self being the substance that is the watcher up through the knower, (5) the self being [the substance of] the three [types of] afflicted phenomena, from ignorance up through aging and dying, ( 6) the self being [the substantial support of] becoming free from attachment to the [respec­tively lower] mundane cessations [attained through the progression of] the dhyanas and fo rm[less absorptions], (7) the self being [the substantial sup­port of] the path of seeing that directly sees the characteristics of the fo ur realities, (8) the self being [the substantial support of] the path of fa miliar­ization, whose nature consists of the [eight] liberations [and the ninefold] progressive abiding, and (9) the self being the substantial support of the path of nonlearning on which the purposes [of oneself and others] have been per­fe ctly accomplished The second nine conceptions about the apprehender are the [nine types of] clinging in which one thinks that [an imputed individual] is an apprehender that is a merely imputed support, [with the latter respectively consisting] of (1) the five skandhas (such as fo rm), (2) the ayatanas (such as the eyes),"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 Groundless Paths (3) the eighteen dhatus (such as the dhatu of form), (4) the twelve [links of] dependent origination (such as ignorance), (5) the purified phenomena of the thirty-seven [dharmas] concordant [with enlightenment], (6) the path of seeing, whose nature consists of the three doors to liberation, (7) the path of fa miliarization, which consists of the dhyanas and formless [absorptions] , (8) the special paths of realizing emptiness, which are superior to [the paths of] sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and so on, and (9) the path of nonlearning (such as the [ten] powers). {105} Thus, if these thirty-six conceptions are classified in terms of the [three] realms, through counting thirty-six [conceptions] in each one of the three realms, they [sum up to] 108.268 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.1.5. Their definite number Since what is conceptualized is definitely two in number as being apprehender and apprehended, the conceptions about it are also twofold. Since the appre­hended is definitely twofold as being afflicted and purified phenomena or the purified phenomena of the mahayana and hinayana, respectively, the con­ceptions about the apprehended are twofold. Since the objects to be clung to as an apprehender are definite as being substantially and imputedly exis­tent, the conceptions that are their subjects are definitely twofold in number. [The Abhisamayala171kara's] ninefold subdivisions of each one [of these four conceptions] are taught to those to be guided in the immediate retinue who entertain such thoughts, but they are not definite numbers that are grounded in [corresponding distinct] entities. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.1.6. Their definite order The [four] basic conceptions accord with the order of the four [factors con­ducive to] penetration.

Calculating the fo ur possibilities [of their relationship] The possibility of being a conception about the apprehended, but not a concep­tion about the apprehender refers to [conceptions about] the six objects. The possibility of being a conception about the apprehender, but not a conception about the apprehended refers to [conceptions about] a cognizance that possesses a single instant. The possibility of being both refers to [conceptions about] cog­nizance with any other [number] of moments. The possibility of being neither is prajftaparamita free from these aspects.

However, this is not the same as [how] apprehender and apprehended [are understood] in this context [of the path of preparation as discussed in the Abhisamayalal?'lkdra]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.2.2. The remedies that relinquish them These will be explained in [the chapter on] the culminating training. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.4.3. The distinctive fe ature that is the spiritual friend as the mentor To explain this according to the position of master Aryavimuktisena, [he says that] the first line of root [verse 1.36] teaches (1) the inner mentor (being skilled in means); the second one, (2) the outer mentor (the spiritual friend); and the third one, (3) the antagonistic fa ctors of both these [mentors]. (1) [Bodhisattvas] are endowed with the mental engagement in the know­ledge of all aspects, which is the cause for their minds not being intimidated, truly not being intimidated, and absolutely not being intimidated as the rem­edies fo r the triad of lesser, medium, and great fe ar (being afraid, terrified, and very terrified), respectively. Through this, [they practice the six paramitas-] the generosity of realizing the skandhas and so on, in the manner of not observing them, as being of the nature of the three doors to liberation and teaching [this realization] to others; the ethics of not clinging to such a real­ization as being supreme; the patience of discriminating such accepting and poised readiness; the vigor of not giving up such discrimination and mental engagement in the knowledge of all aspects; the dhyana of not providing any chances fo r mentally engaging in the hinayana; and the prajfta of knowing that [all] phenomena from the skandhas up through the unique [buddha­dharmas] are not empty of their respective emptinesses, but are inseparable from emptiness. (2) The outer mentor{107} refers to spiritual friends who teach that [all] phenomena from fo rm up through the unique [buddhadharmas] are without nature; are skilled in means; point out the actions of maras; and do not make [their disciples] dedicate the roots of virtue to the levels of sravakas and prat­yekabuddhas, [but only to the knowledge of all aspects]. (3) As fo r the antagonistic fa ctors of both of these [mentors], the antago­nistic fa ctor of the inner mentor (being skilled in means) is as fo llows. When"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 Groundless Paths [bodhisattvas] cultivate the paramitas up through the unique [buddhad­harmas] by way of lacking the mental engagement in the knowledge of all aspects, they become terrified and so on by virtue of being conceited about the [paramitas and so on]. The antagonistic fa ctors of the inner mentor (the spiritual friend) are evil friends who reject the [prajfiaparamita] scriptures ([saying] about the scriptures that teach the six paramitas that \"these are not the words of the Buddha, but self-styled [compositions] of poets\"), reject the path (turn [their disciples] away from the six paramitas and make them prac­tice the pitaka of the sravakas), and reject the fruition ([saying,] \"With [all phenomena] from form up through the knowledge of all aspects being empty of a self and what is mine, to become a buddha is pointless\"). Therefore, those who reject these two [kinds of] antagonistic fa ctors represent the mentors. 269 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.

The sravaka system In the vinaya, [the Buddha] speaks of [the disposition] being fourfold-the dispositions of the noble ones of being content with poor dharma robes,"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 125 alms, and bedding as well as the disposition of the noble ones of delighting in relinquishment and meditation. The nature [of this disposition] is the mental factor detachment. The first three teach the manner of practicing the path and the last one teaches the actual path.270 As for these two [sets], in due order, the former brings peace, when one craves for entities that [one considers to] be mine and the last one lastingly pacifies craving for both a self and what is mine. As for the manner in which these serve as the disposition, the autocom­mentary [on the Abhidharmakosa] says: They are the four dispositions of the noble ones since the noble ones arise from them. 271 Also, the difference between sharp and dull faculties is presented as the dis­position. The Abhidharmakosa says: Some are of this disposition from the beginning And some become [so] by virtue of purification. 272 Thus, though a mere disposition is known [among sravakas,] there is no pre­sentation of the two dispositions [as in the mahayana]. {109} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. The Mere Mentalist system This has two parts: 1) Asserting something conditioned as the disposition 2) Asserting the nature of phenomena as the disposition 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Asserting something conditioned as the disposition Among those who assert something conditioned as the disposition, there are (1) those who present the alaya and (2) those who do not present it. (1) As for the first, the Vivrtagiuf.harthapir;4avyakhya says: The perfect [nature] is twofold-permanent and impermanent ... The impermanent is twofold-what has the character of perfect wisdom and what has the character of seeds ... What has the nature of seeds is also twofold-naturally abiding and accomplished.273 Thus, it explains the naturally abiding disposition as the potential within the alaya for producing what is uncontaminated. The Mahayanasaf!lgraha states: The small, medium, and great latent tendencies for listening are to be regarded as the seeds of the dharmakaya. Since they are the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 Groundless Paths remedy for the alaya-consciousness, they are not of the nature of the alaya-consciousness. 274 [The text] says [further] that these latent tendencies exist together with the alaya, just like [a mixture of] milk and water, and that [the latter] changes state through its seeds becoming extinguished to the very extent to which said [ten­dencies] increase. Furthermore, according to what the Mahayanasiitriilarrtkiira and the Viniscayasarrtgraha�;�i say, the disposition is asserted as the seeds within the alaya that are able to produce what is uncontaminated. (2) Not to present the alaya accords with the Bodhisattvabhiimi: \"What is the disposition?\" In brief, the disposition is twofold-the naturally abiding one { 110} and the accomplished one (samudanfta ). The naturally abiding disposition is the distinctive feature of the six ayatanas of bodhisattvas, which has been obtained through the nature of phenomena since beginningless time and is continuing as such [up through the present]. The accomplished disposition is what is obtained through having cultivated roots of virtue in the past.275 [Thus, the disposition of bodhisattvas] is this \"distinctive feature of the six ayatanas.\" It is asserted as the potential to attain enlightenment that oper­ates based on [the six ayatanas] and is not interrupted by a sentient being's mind stream, its elements, birthplaces, and so on. Since it performs [this] function, it is substantially existent, but not a separately existent self-sufficient substance. Therefore, it is asserted as something that is inexpressible as being either identical with or other than its basis of imputation. Thus, the disposi­tion is neither the six ayatanas nor is it something else. As for the unfolding disposition, it is just the naturally abiding disposition being caused to flourish through the triad of study, reflection, and medita­tion. Therefore, it is merely [the naturally abiding disposition] being labeled with this other name \"unfolding.\" Furthermore, there are explanations in the Sagarameghasiitra about naturally abiding and unfolding [types] for the cer­tain and the uncertain dispositions as well as for the ones of those who have and have not previously gone through inferior paths. 276 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1.2.2. Asserting the nature of phenomena as the disposition This refers to cases like the disposition that is taught as the nature of phenom­ena here in the [Abhisamay]alarrtkiira being also explained by Ratnakarasanti as the disposition. 277"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 127 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. 4.1.1.1.3. The Madhyamaka system The Da5adharmakasutra { 111} says: Just as [the existence of] fire is known due to smoke And [the existence of] water is known due to water birds, The disposition of intelligent bodhisattvas Is known due to its signs. Accordingly, the Madhyamakavatara explains [the disposition] as the cause of the [following] physical signs: Those who, even at the time of being ordinary beings, hear about emptiness, Thus give rise to great joy on the inside again and again, Whose eyes become moist through the tears arisen from that great joy, And whose body hairs stand on end-They possess the seed of the mind of a perfect buddha. 278 The A vatal'flsakasutra says: 0 children of the victors, what is called \"the disposition of bodhi­sattvas\" is being completely devoted to the dharmadhatu, which is as vast as the sky and naturally luminous. Accordingly, here in the [Abhisamay]alal'flkilra, the disposition is said to be the dharmadhatu. Likewise, there is the explanation in the Uttaratantra, which says about the disposition in general: The disposition of the three jewels Is the object of the omniscient ones. It is inconceivable in fo ur ways ... 279 Thus, it explains all of the fo llowing fo ur-the basic element, enlightenment, the qualities, and enlightened activity-as the disposition. In particular, it speaks of the disposition as being twofold: Like a treasure and a fruit tree, The disposition is to be known as twofold-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 Groundless Paths Naturally abiding without beginning And the supreme of what is accomplished.280 It clearly teaches the naturally abiding disposition, which is illustrated by the example of the treasure, as the nature of phenomena free from anything to be added or to be removed: Similarly, with the stainless treasure of jewels lodged within the mind, Whose nature is to be inconceivable and inexhaustible, { 112} Not being realized, beings continuously experience The suffering of being destitute in many ways.281 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.2. The manner in which it serves as the disposition In general, both Madhyamikas and Mere Mentalists agree in presenting the disposition as being the mere cause of the qualities being suitable to arise and the obscurations being suitable to be relinquished within the mind streams of sentient beings. Also, that [the obscurations] are suitable to be relinquished is by virtue of the stains being adventitious. However, they disagree on the meaning of \"adventitious.\" The Madhyamikas present \"stains\" as adventitious because they are merely set up by mentally imputing them, but, ultimately, they are emptiness in that they are not substantially established. The Mere Mentalists assert the stains as being adventitious for the following reason. Since they have the nature of other-dependent primary minds and mental fa c­tors, they are real as substances, but they are produced through the improper mental engagement of clinging to the skandhas as being pure, happiness, per­manent, and a self, which deviates from their basic nature. Hence, one is able to put an end to this [improper mental engagement] by way of eliminating its objects. Once it stops, also the desire and so on that are its results will natu­rally come to an end. Therefore, they are suitable to be removed. Consequently, [according to] the Madhyamikas, when the nature of the mind-emptiness that in its fundamental state is not established as anything whatsoever-is realized, conventionally all illusionlike clinging will be at peace and all illusionlike remedies will arise. This is what they, from the per­spective of the seeming, impute onto that very nature of the mind and { 113} present as \"the naturally abiding disposition.\" [According to] the Mere Mentalists, the luminous nature of the mind, in its fundamental state, is established through its own nature at all times, while said stains are suitable to be removed from it through remedies. To the very extent that it becomes free from these stains, to that extent all its qualities"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 129 will arise. Therefore, since it functions as the basis for these two [(stains and qualities)], the nature of phenomena is asserted as the disposition.282 Thus, though [Mere Mentalists and Madhyamikas] agree in asserting the nature of phenomena as the disposition, they differ in respectively asserting or not asserting the basis of purification of the stains as being real. Hence, their reasons for presenting the nature of phenomena as the disposition are not the same. Consequently, the statements in the context of Mere Mentalism that the stains are primordially extinct are explained as merely referring to their not operating in the basic nature since they are produced due to mistakenness. But, unlike by the Ni.Q.svabhavavadins, they are not explained as mere names that are mentally imputed because that would mean to mix the [two positions]. That stains are without extinction and without arising is the distinctive fea­ture of the latter system. Therefore, [Madhyamikas] label the mere knowing that the factors to be relinquished are without nature with the conventional term \"relinquishment,\" but do not assert that the factors to be relinquished and their remedies are real as different substances, just as an illusory elephant defeats another illusory elephant. Furthermore, the [Mere Mentalist] presentation of something conditioned as the disposition is given by virtue of its producing what is uncontaminated, while the explanation of the nature of phenomena as the disposition pres­ents the mere production of the qualities through focusing on the [nature of phenomena] as the disposition. In this way, the disposition [is understood to] serve as the disposition by way of either being the causal condition or the object condition [for the production of the uncontaminated qualities]. 283 {114} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.2.3. The divisions of the disposition The Laitkavatarasutra describes it as fivefold-the dispositions of the three yanas, the uncertain disposition, and the cut-off disposition. As for the last one, it merely intends being difficult to be liberated, whereas it is impossible for the disposition to be cut off completely. If the stains were not suitable to be relinquished, it would follow that they are the nature of the mind and, in that case, it would be impossible to transcend satp.sara, just as fire and its heat are inseparable.284 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.2.3.4. The hermeneutical etymology of\"disposition\" The Mahayanasutrala111kiira says: ... -it is to be understood In the sense of qualities being set free. 285"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 Groundless Paths Accordingly, it is the disposition because the qualities arise and originate from it. As for its synonyms, the Bodhisattvabhumi says: The disposition is also called \"basis,\" \"displayer,\" \"cause,\" \"founda­tion,\" \"abode,\" \"precursor,\" and \"matrix.\"286 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.2. Explanation of the dharmas that are fo unded [on it]­the thirteen practices This has two parts: 1) General instruction on the thirteen practices 2) Particular explanation of the twelfth practice 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.1. General instruction on the thirteen practices What is called \"disposition\" is the foundation of the thirteen practices-the six dharmas of realization, that is, the dharmas of realizing identitylessness, which consist of (1)-(4) the four [factors conducive to] penetration and (5)­(6) the two [paths of] seeing and fa miliarization; (7) the uninterrupted path (the remedy); (8) the path of liberation (the relinquishment); (9) the com­plete consumption (that is, relinquishment) of the conceptions of fa ctors to be relinquished and remedies; (10) prajiia with compassion that makes [bod­hisattvas] not abide in either [ sa�psaric] existence or peace; ( 11) the path that is not in common with the disciples (the §ravakas);287 {115} (12) progressively accomplishing the welfare of others in accordance with their [karmic] for­tune;288 and (13) the effortless operation of wisdom.289 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2. Particular explanation of the twelfth practice To progressively accomplish the welfare of others refers to establishing [those to be guided], in accordance with their respective [karmic] fortunes, on the paths of the three yanas. You may wonder, \"Through which means are they so established?\" [This happens] by way of the four indirect intentions and the four intentions. A critical analyis of this has three parts: 1) The natures of intentions and indirect intentions 2) The difference between these two 3) Considering what expedient and definitive [meanings] are 1) The first one has two parts: a) Intentions b) Indirect intentions 1a) The Mahayanasutriilarrzkiira says: Intention should be known as fourfold In terms of equality, another meaning,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Another time, and also The thinking of a person. 290 Translations: The General Topics 131 Accordingly, among these four, a) the intention in terms of equality refers to [saying] something like, \"At that time, I was the completely perfect Buddha Vipasyi,\" [which means that] the dharmakaya [of all buddhas] is equal.291 b) The intention in terms of another meaning refers to saying something like, \"All phenomena lack a nature and are without arising\" because this is not [to be taken] literally. c) The intention in terms of another time refers to [saying] something like, \"Those who make the aspiration prayer to be born in Sukhavati will be born there,\" {116} which intends [to say] that, though they may not be born [there] immediately after having died, and transited [from, their present life], they [will be born there] at another time. d) The intention in terms of the thinking of a person refers to something like praising certain roots of virtue in some [people], while disparaging them in some [others] who content themselves with [only] small [amounts of said roots of virtue]. lb) Indirect intentions The Mahayanasutralarrzkara says: The indirect intention in terms of introducing, The indirect intention in terms of characteristics, The indirect intention in terms of a remedy, And the indirect intention in terms of transformation-292 Accordingly among these four, a) the indirect intention in terms of introduc­ing refers to something like teaching that form and so on exist in order to relinquish the sravakas' fear [of emptiness] for the sake of introducing them into the teachings. b) The indirect intention in terms of characteristics refers to something like teaching that all phenomena lack a nature and so on while intending the three natures. Here [the three natures] are explained as the lack of nature by intending that the imaginary is [the lack of nature in terms of] characteristics because it does not exist as a substance; the other-dependent is [the lack of nature in terms of] arising because it does not arise from itself, but arises from others; and the perfect [nature] is the ultimate lack of nature because it is the ultimate focal object of ultimate nonconceptual wisdom and does not exist apart from the other-dependent. 293 c) As for the indirect intention in terms of a remedy, the Mahayana­sutrdlarrzkara says:"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 Groundless Paths Contempt for the buddha or the dharma, Laziness, complacency with little [achievements], Desirous and proud behavior, Regret, and separation of those who are indefinite { 117} Are the obscurations of sentient beings-The supreme yana was taught as their remedy.294 Thus, [this indirect intention] refers to something like teaching in order to overcome these eight flaws. (1) [Statements with) the first [one among the above four] intentions are explained as a remedy for contempt for the bud­dha. (2) As a remedy for contempt for the scriptural dharma, [the Buddha] said something like, \"When having served and paid homage to buddhas equal [in number] to the sands of the River Ganga, the realization of the mahayana arises freshly.\" In the Mahayanasa111graha, this is explained as [a statement with] an intention in terms of another meaning. In [Asvabhava's Mahaydnasa,grah]opanibandhana, its meaning is explained as a statement with the intention of [referring to] another meaning than the scriptural [dharma], that is, the dharma of the realization of the mahayana. (3) As remedies for the obscuration of laziness, [statements with] the intention of another time are explained, and [also statements] like, \"Merely through pro­no\\1ncing the name of the Tathagata Vimalacandraprabha, unsurpassable enlightenment is certain.\" (4) Something like despising generosity and so on for some and praising them for others [is used] as a remedy for complacency with little [achievements]. (5) Something like praising the excellences of cer­tain buddhas [is used] as a remedy for proud behavior. (6) To praise the riches in buddha realms [is used] as a remedy for desirous behavior. (7) Something like [saying], \"Those who harm buddhas and bodhisattvas progress to the higher realms\" [is used] as a remedy for regret. (8) Something like prophecies for sravakas [about their buddhahood] and explanations on the single yana [are used] as remedies for the obscuration of those who are indefinite [in their disposition] turning away [from the mahayana]. {118} This [third indirect intention] as well as the [second] intention and the sec­ond indirect intention are only asserted by the Mere Mentalists. d) Regard the indirect intention in terms of transformation as leading to another profound subject matter. This corresponds to something like the fol­lowing statement: Those who understand what lacks essence to have an essence, Dwell well in mistakenness, And are greatly afflicted by afflictions Will attain supreme enlightenment.295"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 133 [Here] \"essence\" refers to mind being distracted and to lack that is \"what lacks essence.\" \"Mistakenness\" refers to the opposites of [the four mistaken notions of] purity, happiness, permanence, and a self. \"Afflictions\" means being tired out by long-lasting austerities. [In sum,] the [four indirect intentions] correspond to what the Mahayanasutralarrrkara says: With regard to sravakas, the [three] characteristics, Overcoming flaws, and also The profundity of expressions, Indirect intention is fourfold. 296 2) As for the difference between these two, the [Mahayanasarrrgrah]opani­bandhana says: An intention is just something that one has in mind, but it is not an assertion in relation to another person [who listens]. An indi­rect intention is in relation to introducing297 that very [statement] to another person [who listens].298 Accordingly, an intention is [to be understood] from the point of view of demonstrating a speaker's thinking, that is, explaining separately [after a given statement] that what its explicit words say is not the intention of these words and thus [saying], \"I said this by thinking about such and such.\" An indirect intention is [to be understood] from the point of view of demonstrating a purpose, [saying,] \"The purpose of not teaching in a straightforward man­ner, but teaching in a roundabout way of speaking, is as follows.\" For indirect speech or [speech] that speaks in riddles is roundabout. Therefore, {119} intentions and indirect intentions are presented through different ways of presenting [what is intended] in a single passage of expe­dient meaning, [corresponding to] the two [statements] \"[This was said] by intending such and such\" and \"This was said for the sake of such and such.\"299 As for [the Mahayanasarrrgrahopanibandhana saying that] an intention is not in relation to introducing another person [to something], [it means that] its being presented as an intention is not from the point of view of that. However, since [said text's explanation of] an indirect intention [contains the phrase] \"that very [statement] ,\" both [intention and indirect intention] are evaluated with regard to a single basis, just as the first and the last two [among the four] intentions [can] be explained as the indirect intention in terms of a remedy."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 Groundless Paths 3) Considering what expedient and definitive [meanings] are All these [statements with intentions and indirect intentions] are of expe­dient meaning because, [in statements with] intentions, one must seek for an intention other than what the words explicitly say and because [statements with] indirect intentions are statements that are not [to be taken] literally. It may be said, \"But then all [statements] would [entail] the indirect intention in terms of transformation.\" I agree because [all] these [intentions and indirect intentions] are just subdivisions in terms of isolates. \"If all of them are of expedient meaning, all words of the Buddha would be of expedient meaning because the Mahayanasarrzgraha says: The indirect intention in terms of a remedy is taught as the remedy in which one engages [in order to counteract] the eighty-four thou­sand [kinds of afflictions]. \"300 The teachings on the repulsiveness [of the body], love, the subdivisions of the dhatus, counting one's exhalations and inhalations, and so on as the respective remedies for desire, hatred, pride, thoughts, and so on as well as that [the latter] are completely relinquished through these remedies are not [to be taken] literally {120} because each one of them is not capable of fully relinquishing [its corresponding affliction]. Therefore, the intention in these [teachings] is to introduce those whose faculties [make it] difficult to guide them into cultivating limited remedies, but it is not that all the words of the Buddha are taught as [entailing] the indirect intention in terms of a rem­edy.

In general, there are explanations on these mundane and supramundane [paths] that they, respectively, refer to bearing the aspects of [discriminat­ing] coarse [lower levels from] peaceful [higher ones] and the [four] realities; being with and without appearances; and not having or having attained the bhftmis. Here, however, {121} they refer to mastering one's mind stream. (6) Contaminated phenomena are the skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, dhyanas, form[less absorptions], and immeasurables that are not able to function as remedies for the views about a personal self, [thus entailing] striving for future skandhas and excessive attachment to the present skandhas. (7) Uncontaminated phenomena are the remedies for the views about said personal self, such as the foundations of mindfulness. As for the meaning of contaminated and uncontaminated, the [Abhidharma]­samuccaya speaks of them as being connected or not being connected, respec­tively, with the six doors of contamination: They are to be regarded as contaminated because of their very character being contamination, their being connected with contam­inations, their being bound by contaminations, their being related to contaminations, their being approximately concordant with con­taminations, and their arising from contaminated causes. 306 The Abhidharmakosa307 explains contaminated and uncontaminated as contaminations expanding or not expanding, respectively, by virtue of either the focal object or the associated [mental factors]. Here, however, they are presented as respectively not functioning and functioning as remedies for contaminations. Therefore, this disagrees [with the above explanations] .

Therefore, the Vrtti explains [the uncommon phenomena] here in terms of the mind stream.308 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.2.2. Manners of [serving as] fo cal objects First, in the minds of bodhisattvas, there arise thoughts about what they should adopt, what they should reject, and what they should be indifferent about. Based on that, [they focus on] the first three [focal objects], respec­tively. Then, when they take up what is to be adopted, they think about what they should adopt first and what later. Based on that, [they focus on] the mun­dane and supramundane paths, respectively. Next, by thinking about what the [latter path] 's factors to be relinquished and its nature are, [they focus on] contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena, respectively. Through con­sidering what the focal objects of uncontaminated phenomena are, [they focus on] conditioned (seeming) and unconditioned (ultimate) phenomena. Then, leaving conditioned phenomena behind, [there are] two fruitions of focusing on unconditioned phenomena-common and uncommon. 309 Though there are certainly also fruitions of focusing on conditioned phenomena, noble persons are characterized by their manners of realizing unconditioned phe­nomena. Therefore, the fruitions of focusing on conditioned phenomena are not taught [in the Abhisamayala111kara]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.3. The aim of practice [The aim of practice] consists of the three greatnesses. {123} According to the intentions of the Marmakaumudi and the Suddhamati, great mind consists of the vajralike [mind] and so on; great relinquishment is to teach the dharma for the sake of relinquishing all views; and great realization is to lack clinging to bodhicitta and so on. Thus, bodhisattvas, through working with said three greatnesses, wish for the great highest state-buddhahood. According to Aryavimuktisena's assertions, [this is discussed in] in two parts-(1) what is to be accomplished and (2) the means of accomplish­ment. (1) To be the highest among a great host of sentient beings and a great assembly of sentient beings is the great highest state [or great mind]. To have relinquished all obscurations without exception is great relinquishment. Through having realized everything in terms of suchness and variety, great realization is free from attachment and obstruction with regard to any object. Here \"a host of sentient beings\" refers to [beings] in general and \"an assem­bly,\" to their differences in terms of their dispositions and so on. 310"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 137 (2) The means for accomplishing [the above] exist in bodhisattvas and con­sist of the six types of mind that make [them attain] the highest state among all sentient beings, teaching the dharma to sentient beings in the manner of nonobservation in order to relinquish all views, and the attachment-free bod­hicitta that is not in common with any sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and not contained in the three realms. These are the three causes for presenting bodhisattvas as mahasattvas. As for the six [types of] mind, they are (1) the vajralike mind, (2) the vast mind, (3) the unshakable {124} mind, (4) the benefiting mind, (5) the mind of making efforts in the yogas of the mother because of constant delight in the dharma, and (6) the mind of making one the highest among all sentient beings through abiding in all purified phenomena. (1) The first one is to wish for enlightenment in the following way. Having donned the armor for the welfare of all sentient beings for as long as [satpsaric] existence lasts, [bodhi­sattvas] take on limitless physical forms and give away all material goods. They [develop] an equal mind toward sentient beings and [lead them] to nirvai}.a through the three yanas. However, through understanding that all phenom­ena are without arising, they realize that there is no nirvai}.a. They engage in the six paramitas by way of a state of mind that is not mixed with the mental engagements of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and thus realize all dharmas to be of the same principle. They make the commitment, \"For the sake of each single sentient being, I shall experience their sufferings until they pass into nirvai).a\" and thus [think], \"I shall fully complete my own accumulations [of merit and wisdom and so on] later.\" (2) The second one means that, after having generated bodhicitta for the first time, [bodhisattvas] do not generate any attachment and so on or the mindsets of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. (3) The third one refers to the lack of conceit [that may arise] due to having generated the mindset of the mahayana. (4) The fourth one means to protect sentient beings and to never give up on them, while lacking any conceit about this. (5) The fifth one refers to mentally engaging many times in suchness, which is inseparable from all dharmas. ( 6) The sixth one means to abide in emptiness, the thirty-seven dharmas [concordant with enlightenment], the [ten] powers, the [four] fearlessnesses, the [four] discriminating awarenesses, the unique [buddhadharmas], and the samadhis from the vajralike one {125} up through the one of being liberated and untainted by virtue of being as unattached as space.

These four dharmas are [causing] the decline of its antagonistic factor (miserliness), being endowed with nonconceptuality by virtue of having realized phenomenal identity­lessness, fulfilling [all] desires through giving what is desired, and attracting [sentient beings] through generosity and thus maturing them in accordance with their karmic fortunes in terms of the three yanas. Likewise, (2) the mind of relinquishment, (3) not being upset, (4) delight in virtue, (5) a one-pointed mind, and ( 6) fully discriminating phenomena [each] possess said four dhar­mas. Among these [four], the antagonistic factors are the respective ones that pertain to each one [of these five paramitas]. As for [said paramitas] fulfill­ing what is desired, they completely fulfill the desires [of beings] through, in due order, restraint from harming others through body and speech, enduring harm done by others, assisting sentient beings with whatever they are doing, producing magical creations in accordance with the minds of sentient beings, and cutting through the doubts of sentient beings. Through subdividing each one of these [six paramitas] into three, they become eighteenfold. The first one thus consists of [granting] the dharma, material goods, and fearlessness. The second one consists of promoting the welfare of sentient beings, gathering virtuous dharmas, and vows. The third one consists of not being concerned about harm, willingly accepting suffer­ing, and certainty about the dharma. The fourth one consists of armor[like vigor], [the vigor of] application, and being active for the welfare of sentient beings. {127} The fifth one consists of blissfully abiding amidst visible phe­nomena, manifesting qualities, and being active for the welfare of sentient beings.

Explanation of what makes one attain the first dhyana [The first dhyana is attained through] seven mental engagements. 1) First, one mentally engages through blending study and reflection, [con­templating that, compared to the first dhyana,] the desire [realm] has more extensive suffering, is not peaceful, and has much shorter lifetimes, whereas the first dhyana is the opposite of that. Therefore, [the fo rmer] is coarse and [the latter] is peaceful. Since this [mental engagement] distinguishes the characteristics of higher and lower realms, it is the mental engagement of discriminating characteristics. 2) By virtue of having aspired in this way [for a long time] fo r said lower and higher [levels] as being coarse and peaceful, respectively, [one's mental engagement] goes beyond study and reflection and becomes calm abiding and superior insight. This is the mental engagement that arises fr om aspiration. 3) Through the fo rce of having become fa miliar with the [above] for a long time, �e path of relinquishing the three great [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire realm will arise fo r the very first time. The mental engagement of being endowed with this arisen path is the mental engagement of separation. 4) Once one has become free through this from the afflictions of the desire realm and the [associated] impregnations of the negative tendencies of this sphere, one then fe els the joy of relinquishing, and being separated from, said afflictions. Seeing these two Uoys] as benefits, {132} one arrives at the lesser [degree of the] joy and bliss that arise from said separation. At that point, in order to free oneself from sleep, dullness, and agitation, time and again one makes [the mind] lucid through the mental engagement of its becoming lucid and makes it weary through the mental engagement of its becoming weary [of the desire realm]. This is the mental engagement of joy and withdrawal,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144 Groundless Paths which represents the phase of relinquishing the three medium [degrees of the] afflictions [of the desire realm]. In due order, the mental engagements of [mind] becoming lucid and weary refer to familiarizing with relinquishing [the afflictions of the desire realm as being the aspect of] what is desirable and with not relinquishing them as the aspect that is the shortcoming [here]. 5) Having made efforts in relinquishing [said afflictions] in this way, if, no matter which causes or places [one may encounter], the fetters of the desire realm that obstruct applying oneself to virtue do not occur [in one's mind stream], one ponders, \"Do I not experience these [fetters] while they [still] exist in me or do I not experience them because they do not exist [anymore]?\" Then, one mentally engages in an attractive aspect [of the desire realm] and, if striving for the desire realm occurs through that, considers, \"My mind is not free from attachment toward the desire realm.\" To [further] familiarize through this with [the desire realm] being coarse and [the first dhyana] being peaceful in order to relinquish the remaining factors to be relinquished is the mental engagement of analysis. 6) Having analyzed time and again in this way whether [the afflictions] are relinquished or not relinquished, in order to relinquish the manifest factors to be relinquished that have not yet been relinquished, the remedy for the three lesser [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire realm arises, which is the mental engagement of the final training. However, said [afflictions] are relinquished only temporarily, but not relinquished for good because their seeds have not been eradicated, for the mundane path does not have the ability to do so. 7) At the end of this [process], through its force {133} one enters the actual first dhyana and the mental engagement of being endowed with this actual [ dhyana] arises, which is the mental engagement of the fruition of the training. As for these seven mental engagements being definite in number, one does not attain the actual [first dhyana], if, through this preparatory stage, the fac­tors of the lower level to be relinquished are not relinquished and the factors of the higher level to be attained are not attained. Therefore, said mental engage­ments are presented as seven. In this way, this preparatory path [entails] the triad of its (a) cause, (b) nature, and (c) fruition. (a) As for the first one among these, the first two mental engagements refer to generating what has not yet arisen. For the first one gives mind direction through understanding what is to be relinquished and what is to be attained, while the second one means to make efforts for that sake. The fifth mental engagement is what makes what has arisen special because, through examining whether [the afflictions] have or have not been relinquished, it finally rids one of the remaining factors to be relinquished. These three [mental engagements] are the causes [within the preparatory stage]. (b) Its nature consists of the second, third, and fourth [mental engagements] because they respectively overcome the three [degrees]"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 145 (great, medium, and lesser) of the afflictions of the lower level [that is the desire realm]. (c) Its fruition is the seventh mental engagement. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.1.2. Demonstrating that the others are similar to this As it was [described] fo r the first dhyana, so it is [for all fo llowing dhyanas and fo rmless absorptions] up through the ayatana of Neither Discrimination Nor Nondiscrimination. However, in the general terminology of the abhidharma, it is explained that when one makes efforts in contemplation in the higher realms, one enters samadhis in which there is no room fo r thinking. Therefore, on the higher levels, there is no [mental state] arisen from reflection and, in the fo rmless [absorptions], there is no one arisen from study [either] . Thus, if one meditates in a [psychophysical] support of the fo rmless [realm], {134} the first mental engagement lacks both [mental states arisen from] study and [those arisen from] reflection. When one meditates in a [psychophysical] sup­port of the fo rm [realm], there are no [mental states] arisen from reflection. Furthermore, from the preparatory stage of the fo urth dhyana up through the preparatory stage of the Peak of Existence, there are no joy and bliss that are fe lt in their [respective] activities. Therefore, the meaning of the mental engagement of joy and withdrawal is explained as merely seeing the qualities in relinquishing [the afflictions]. The first mental engagement of the preparatory stage of the first dhyana belongs to the desire realm-it is not included in the higher level [of the fo rm realm]. One should understand that this [same] rationale also [applies] to the remaining [preparatory stages]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.1.3. Considering where the ninth path [of libera­tion] is contained According to the assertion that the mental engagement of the final fruition of the training is the [corresponding] actual [ dhyana], it is obvious that the ninth path of liberation of the preparatory stage [ (experiencing the lesser of the lesser degrees of the afflictions having been relinquished)] is necessarily said actual [dhyana]. However, those who fo llow the Abhidharmakosa assert that the ninth path of liberation of the first three dhyanas arises as having both the natures of the respective preparatory stage and the actual [dhyana], whereas they hold that the [preparatory stages] of the fo urth [ dhyana] and onward are necessarily the [corresponding] actual [dhyanas]. Since the Abhidharmakosa asserts the fe eling of the preparatory stages to be solely equanimity, the type of the fa culty of fe eling in the preparatory stages and the actual stages of the first three dhyanas differs. Therefore, [what the Abhidharmikas] have in mind is the difficulty of shifting the fa culty [of fe eling between the prepara­tory stages and the actual states of the first three dhyanas], while there is no"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146 Groundless Paths difficulty of shifting said faculty during the remaining [preparatory stages and actual stages above the third dhyana]. For the feeling [in both these prepara­tory stages and actual stages] is definitely equanimity alone. The [above] identification of the six mental engagements of the prepara: tory stage in this way is made in terms of becoming free from attachment to [the respectively] lower levels through the mundane path. However, {135} it is not that [the preparatory stages] are definitely six in number. For there are the path of seeing and the uncontaminated path of familiarization that rely on the preparatory stage of the first [dhyana] and it is contradictory for these two to entail the aspect of [discriminating] coarse [lower levels] and peaceful [higher ones]. In particular, the path of seeing is not suitable as a remedy for the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiarization. In general, [the Abhidharmikas] assert that this path of regarding [lower levels] as coarse and [higher ones] as peaceful relinquishes all manifest afflic­tions (such as those of the desire realm) without exception. The Vaibha�ikas [assert that it relinquishes] both the factors to be relinquished through see­ing and the factors to be relinquished through familiarization of [the levels] up through Nothing Whatsoever, while the Sautrantikas hold that it relin­quishes the factors to be relinquished through familiarization. However, if analyzed finely, through the path of familiarizing with [lower levels] as being coarse and [higher ones] as being peaceful, childish beings are not able to relinquish, without exception, all afflictions of the desire realm that are fac­tors to be relinquished through familiarization. For without having attained the path of the noble ones, it is impossible to put an end to the afflicted mind of someone who possesses a [psychophysical] support of the desire realm and said [afflicted mind] is an affliction that is a factor to be relinquished through familiarization which is included in the level of the desire realm. Except for the first one, all eight preparatory stages [of the dhyanas and formless absorptions] are solely pure, while the first one has both pure and contaminated [forms]. Some assert that [the first preparatory stage] has three [forms-the former two plus entailing] relishing the taste [of its result]­because it emulates the actual [first dhyana]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.

Afflicted [paths] { 136} [This is discussed in] three [aspects]-(a) the bases that are made afflicted, (b) the phenomena that make them afflicted, (c) the manner in which they are made afflicted. (a) You may wonder, \"What is made afflicted?\" It is the pure actual dhyanas and formless [absorptions]. (b) \"Through what are they made afflicted?\" Among the primary afflictions, anger does not exist in the minds of the higher realms. Therefore, [the afflicting factors there] are the remaining four obscured yet neutral [afflictions] except [anger]-craving, view, pride, and ignorance-which are the contaminants of the two higher [realms]. (c) \"How are they made afflicted?\" When one rests in meditative equipoise in the pure meditative absorptions, through the arising of attachment toward them, though they were virtuous [states of mind] before, they thus come to be associated with affliction later. Likewise, [these meditative absorptions may become associated with) pride, [thinking,] \"I attained this, but others did not.\" Through the force of being ignorant about what is and what is not the path, one [wrongly] thinks, \"These [meditative absorptions] must be the path to liberation\" and also entertains doubts about what [actually] is the path to liberation being the opposite. Thus, [said meditative absorptions] become associated with such [ignorance]. When one sees some earlier and later limits [in time] through the supernatural knowledges that are based on said medita­tive absorptions, wrong views about the world being permanent and so on [may] arise. Thus, [said meditative absorptions] come to be associated with such [wrong views]. You may wonder, \"But since the formless [absorptions] are not supports for supernatural knowledges, what is the manner in which they become afflicted by views?\" It is true [that the formless absorptions are no such supports]. However, in the formless [realm], when one attained the [formless] meditative absorptions while one's mind stream was associated with wrong views before, {137} there arises the view of holding a bad view as paramount, [thinking,] \"This view of mine is supreme because I attained this samadhi through its power.\" It is through this that the formless absorptions are made afflicted. [This position of the Abhidharmasamuccaya ]323 that [the dhyanas and med­itative absorptions] are made afflicted through [said] four afflictions agrees with the Bahyaka Vaibha�ikas, but the Kashmiri Vaibha�ikas assert that, in afflicted [meditative absorptions, there is] solely [the affliction of] relishing their taste, which is for the most part craving. Though these [afflicted meditative absorptions] are not fully qualified meditative absorptions, it is by having in mind that they are merely of the substance of the meditative absorptions [as they were attained in their pure form] before that they are counted as divisions of meditative absorptions, just as a rotten seed [is still considered a seed]. Furthermore, these [afflicted"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"148 Groundless Paths meditative absorptions] are neutral [and not virtuous,] and do not possess their branches [that usually define them] either. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pure [paths] These are the dhyanas and fo rmless [absorptions] that represent [forms of] mundane virtue. They are called \"pure\" or \"purified\" because they are free from the fe tters of their respective levels. When divided, there are fo ur [forms of each]-those from which one regresses, those in which one abides, those that are special, and those that are the factors conducive to penetration. In due order, they are approximately concordant with [the arising of] coarse afflic­tions right at their end, [the further arising of] their own [pure level], [the arising of] a higher pure level, and the arising of an uncontaminated path. Since there is no higher level fo r the Peak of Existence, its special [form] and its being the fa ctors conducive [to penetration] are excluded for it. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.2. Supramundane paths The higher and lower abhidharmas explain that the fo ur dhyanas and the first three fo rmless [absorptions] represent the seven supports for the supramun­dane path. However, the Peak of Existence does not because uncontaminated paths determine their objects clearly, while, on this level, the flow of discrimi­nation is very unclear. {138} However, master Haribhadra explains that such is [only] the c�se when sravakas cultivate [the Peak of Existence] because they are not skilled in means. But when bodhisattvas cultivate it, it becomes uncon­taminated because they are skilled in means. In general, through [counting] the preparatory stage of the first [dhyana] and dividing its actual stage into two (mere and special), the uncontaminated [meditative absorptions] are explained to be nine. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.3.

Difference in terms of their being substan­tial and imputed In general, by way of their names, there are eighteen branches of the dhyanas. As the Abhidharmakosa says: The first one has five-examination, analysis, Exhilaration, bliss, and samadhi. The second one has fo ur branches­Serenity, exhilaration, and so on. The third one has five-equanimity, Mindfulness, alertness, bliss, and the basis. The last one has fo ur-mindfulness, equanimity, Neither happiness nor suffering, and samadhi.324 The Vaibha�ikas assert eleven [among] these to be substantial-the substances of examination, analysis, exhilaration, bliss, the fe eling of mental bliss, samadhi, serenity, mindfulness, alertness, the fo rmation of equanimity, and the fe eling of equanimity.325 According to the higher [abhidharma], exhilara­tion and bliss {139} are of the same substance and serenity has the nature of the triad of mindfulness, alertness, and equanimity. Therefore, nine are asserted as being substantially [existent] and the remaining, as being imput­edly existent. Alternatively since [all kinds of] bliss are the same in being satisfying fe elings that belong to the retinue of the mental consciousness, they are counted as one substance, which thus makes [a total of] eight [substan­tially existent branches]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.2. The nature of the branches This has fo ur parts. 1) Among the five branches of the first dhyana, (a) examination refers to searching the mere nature [of something]. (b) Analysis means to analyze finely. Both represent inner discourse, which motivates [outer] speech. The Savitarkdsavicarabhumi explains that these two do not exist in the other three dhyanas in a manner of making up these levels, but exist in that they [still] occur [in them].326 Also, these two are labeled onto both [the mental factors of] impulse and prajiia. The Vaibha�ikas assert that (c) exhilaration and (d) bliss are the fe eling of mental bliss and the bliss of the mental factor suppleness, respectively. The reasons fo r such an assertion are their fo llowing considerations. If bliss were a physical sensation, it would not be such by virtue of a sense consciousness­sense consciousnesses do not exist in the dhyanas because they represent"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 Groundless Paths [mind] being distracted toward the outside. Nor is [bliss] suitable as a feeling that belongs to the retinue of the mental consciousness. [For] since exhila­ration is a feeling of mental bliss too, if these two occurred together, [the position of] their being equal in substance is lost and if they occurred sequen­tially, the first and second dhyanas would respectively not consist of five and four branches because the branches occur together. The Abhidharmakosa[bhd$ya, in representing the position of the Sautrantikas,] says: Others say, {140} \"The faculty that is the mental factor of bliss327 is solely [mental] bliss-in all three dhyanas, what is presented as their [respective] branches is solely physical bliss.\"328 Thus, they assert that the bliss of the first three dhyanas329 is solely a physi­cal sensation, whereas [the bliss of] suppleness exists in the fourth dhyana. Since [the passage in] the siitras on the third dhyana says in [the Buddha's] own words that \"bliss is experienced by the body,\" it is a physical sensation. The Sravakabhumi explains that suppleness is experienced by the physical body and the feeling of bliss, by the mental body. 330 The commentary on the Abhidharmasamuccaya explains: Through experiencing the satisfying feeling that belongs to the reti­nue of the mental consciousness in the first two dhyanas, the body together with the supports that are the sense faculties is made work­able. Through exhilarations, the mental consciousness together with its retinue of congruently associated [mental factors] is sat­isfied. Therefore, since [bliss and exhilaration] perform the two activities of benefiting the body and the mind, respectively, they are presented as \"bliss\" and \"exhilaration.\"331 The latter two [explanations] agree,332 but these two do not accord with [either] the root text of, [or] the commentary on, the Abhidharmakosa. (e) Samadhi is what brings together in a single focal object the minds and mental factors that are congruently associated with it. The Abhidharmikas explain that, among these five [branches], examina­tion is very coarse. Therefore, through meditating by regarding it as a flaw, one becomes free from attachment to this [branch] alone, which is the special actual first [dhyana]. {141} 2) Among the four branches of the second dhyana, as for (a) serenity, the Abhidharmakosa[bhd$yaj333 asserts that it is the trusting confidence about becoming delivered from the level of the meditative equipoise that is the first"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 151 dhyana. The Viniscayasamgrahat;�i334 asserts it to be of the nature of mindful­ness, alertness, and equanimity. The remaining [branches] (b)-(d) correspond to [(c)-(e) of the first dhyana) above. The higher and lower abhidharma and the mother sfttras say that this [ dhyana] is free from both examination and analysis. 3} Among the five branches of the third dhyana, (a) bliss is the satisfying fe eling that belongs to the retinue of the mental consciousness and consists of merely being free from the flux of exhilaration. (b) Mindfulness seizes the focal object and aspect of putting an end to the fe tter of exhilaration and (c) alertness functions as the sentry that [checks] whether [one's meditative equipoise] possesses or does not possess said [focal object and aspect] . (d) Equanimity means that, through being free fr om the flaws of examination, analysis, and exhilaration, there is no [mental) imbalance through these. Thus, mindfulness, alertness, and equanimity exist in the first [ dhyana], but they are impaired by examination and analysis. In the second one, they are obscured by the flaw of exhilaration. Therefore, they are [summarily] referred to as \"serenity\" [and not by their actual names] . 335 4} As for the four branches of the fourth dhyana, they are free from the eight flaws [of dhyana]-examination, analysis, physical pleasure and suffer­ing, mental pleasure and displeasure, inhalation, and exhalation. Therefore, they are completely pure of these. With regard to the fourth [ dhyana], exami­nation, analysis, exhilaration, and bliss are explained as flaws of moving [away from this dhyana], but they are not flaws with regard to their respective own levels {142} because they benefit [their respective) samadhis.336 In due order, the differences between these dhyanas refer to the differ­ences in terms of samadhi, benefit, and complete purity being or not being complete. 337 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.3. Their being definite in number [Said branches] are presented by way of being remedies, benefit, and the basis of these two. [In due order,] the remedial branches [of the four dhyanas] con­sist of examination and analysis; serenity; the triad of mindfulness, alertness, and equanimity; and pure mindfulness and equanimity. For they relinquish the afflictions of the respective lower levels. They represent the remedial con­tinua of the phase of the preparatory stages and, during the actual [ dhyanas), merely make the respective lower levels more distant, but [the actual dhyanas) are not the actual relinquishing remedies. [In due order,] the branches of benefit that are attained when the lower levels are overcome by the remedies consist of the pair of exhilaration and bliss,338 bliss,339 and the fe eling of equa­nimity. The branch that is the basis in all [ dhyanas) is samadhi because it generates the remedies and benefits."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 Groundless Paths Therefore, it is in terms of these three [branches] that the branches are definite in number as [the above] . However, it is not the case that there are no [constituents of the] dhyanas of meditative absorption that do not con­sist of any of these branches. Otherwise, the minds and mental fa ctors (such as impulse and discrimination) that are congruently associated with these branches would not belong to any of the nine grounds [of dhyana] {143} because they would not be the meditative absorptions of the dhyanas, but not be suitable to be anything else either. In this way, through relinquishing examination and analysis, the second [dhyana] is presented; through relinquishing exhilaration, the third; and through relinquishing bliss, the fo urth. Therefore, [the Abhidharmikas] refer to the dhyanas as \"transcending [their respective] lower levels by way of their branches.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.3.2. Explanation of the fo cal objects and aspects of the fo rmless [absorptions] First, as fo r Infinite Space, yogins who have attained the fo urth dhyana see the fo rm [realm] as flawed and the fo rmless [realm] as having qualities. Thus, in order to put an end to the notion of form, they fa miliarize with solely the notion of space free from characteristics such as color, shape, and tangibility. When doing so, [all] discriminations of fo rm (which appears as blue, yel­low, and so on), obstruction (which appears as bricks, walls, and so on), and variety (which appears as clothes, jewelry, pleasure groves, mountains, and so on) disappear-they do not appear at all, even if [said yogins] direct their minds toward them. Likewise, [when engaging in the three fo llowing fo rmless absorptions,] they see the notions of the three lower levels that respectively precede them as being coarse and, in order to put an end to them, in due order, they become intent upon consciousness (the [cognizing] subject of infinite space) pervading everything; not finding anything whatsoever, when searching for fo cal objects with fo rm or without fo rm, they become intent upon there being no fo cal object whatsoever; and they become intent upon there being no coarse discriminations, while it is not that there are no subtle ones. {144} Unlike with the dhyanas, there are no branches to be presented and therefore, these [formless absorptions] are called \"transcending [their respective] lower levels by way of their fo cal objects.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.2.3.3. Explanation of the fruitions of having fa mil­iarized with these [meditative absorptions] The [fruitions of the dhyanas] correspond with what the Abhidharma­samuccaya says:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 153 The fruitions of having fa miliarized with the first dhyana to lesser, medium, and great [degrees, respectively,] are the three births of the first dhyana. As it is fo r the first dhyana, so it is for the remain­ing ones. 340 As for the fo rmless [absorptions], since they are formless, there are no [physi­cal] abodes that are diveded in terms of being higher and lower. However, there are higher and lower rebirths in terms of longer or shorter lifespans and better or worse ones in terms of having more or fe wer afflictions. You may won­der, \"What is the meaning of having familiarized [with the dhyanas] to lesser, medium, and great [degrees, respectively]?\" It is explained that [such fa miliar­ization] is to a lesser [degree] if it lacks both devoted application and constant application; medium, if it possesses either one; and great, if it possesses both. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.3. The signs of such attainment When the dhyanas are attained, there occur signs such as it appearing that one's body sinks beneath the earth and, when the fo rmless [absorptions] are attained, [there occur signs] such as it appearing that one's body is flying through the sky. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.1.4. The persons who attain them [The Abhidharmakosa] says in general: The dhyanas and fo rmless [absorptions can] have [psychophysical] supports Of their respective own and lower levels, [while] the lower are of no use.341 In particular, it says: [Exception:] Through noble ones at the Peak of Existence Manifesting Nothing Whatsoever, they terminate the contaminations. 342 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.2.

The compassion of bodhisattvas [Comes] from a cause, a [spiritual] friend, and nature.343 The first half [of the verse] indicates the object [conditions] of compassion because fo cusing on the three [kinds of] fe elings-the two fe elings of hap­piness and suffering as well as the fe eling of indifference, which induces the [former] two-makes [bodhisattvas] compassionate [in the sense] of wishing that [others may] be free from the three [kinds of] suffering.344 The second half [of the verse] indicates the remaining three conditions-\"'cause\" refers to the causal condition (the uncontaminated seeds within the alaya); \"'friend,\" to the dominant condition (the one who teaches the [four] immeasurables); and \"nature,\" to the immediate condition (the preceding [moment of] aware­ness).

Their natures in particular The Abhidharmasamuccaya says: What is love? It consists of the samadhi and prajfia that, through relying on the dhyanas, are immersed in the [mental] state of thinking, \"May sentient beings encounter benefit, \"346 including the phenomena of the [primary] minds and mental fa ctors that are congruently associated with them. 347 Likewise, with the beginning and end [of this definition] being the same, [the text] says fo r the remaining [three immeasurables], respectively, \"immersed in the [mental] states of [thinking], 'May [sentient beings] be free from suffering' and 'May they not be separated from happiness: and [think­ing about] their benefit.\" These [definitions] teach the bases, fo cal objects, aspects, natures, and aids [of the immeasurables]. The first one consists of the pure fo rms of any one of the actual fo ur dhyanas. The second one refers to all sentient beings [in general] and, in particular (when slightly divided), to those sentient beings who do not possess happiness, possess suffering, possess happiness, and possess attachment and hatred as the causes fo r their discrim­inating [other beings as respectively] being close or distant [to them]. The third one is the wish that they encounter [happiness] and so on. The fo urth one consists of samadhi and prajfia. The fifth one consists of [their associated primary] minds and mental fa ctors. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.2.2.2.3.

The second one is the arising of love and so on through observing those who suffer as having the nature of mere phenomena, while there are no substantial sentient beings that are established as those who suffer.

Alternatively, the objects of the [immeasurables] are as fo llows.

[The system of] those who propound referents The skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are the basis of emptiness, while the per­manent and single self imputed by the tirthikas is the object of negation. In this way, a personal self does not exist, whereas the lack of a [personal] self exists. The [latter] is a negation that is specified by its basis of negation being the triad of skandhas and so on or the fo ur realities. A siitra says: There is no self or sentient being here. These dharmas originated fr om entailing causes. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.2.1.2.

In brief, the unique object of negation of this system is any phenomenal identity, which is asserted as being solely the imaginary [nature], whereas the other two characteristics are not established as self-empty in any undisputed texts of Asali.ga and his brother. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.2.1.2.2. The system of the N�svabhavavadins [The emptiness in this system] is not a limited [kind of] being empty that, in brief, does not go beyond adopting and rejecting, that is, negating some fa ctors and affirming others, such as affirming something unconditioned after what is conditioned has been negated, affirming a nonentity after entities have been negated, affirming existence after nonexistence has been negated, affirming an other-entity after an own-entity has been negated. Rather, it is the emptiness that cuts through the entire cocoon of reference points. [This means that] though any phenomena, which are satisfying if unexamined, appear in an illusionlike manner from the perspective of mistakenness, ultimately they are empty of a nature of their own and are therefore not observable as any nature whatsoever. The Mitlamadhyamaka[karika] says: If the conditioned is not established, How could the unconditioned be established?357 {153} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.2.1.2. Meaning of the branches Emptiness is asserted as the basis of the division and the nature of the divi­sion, as its being twenty in number. 1) On the emptiness of the internal, the slitras say: What is the emptiness of the internal? What are called \"internal phenomena\" refer to eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mentation. Since these do not abide in any solid manner and do not perish, the eye is empty of the eye. 358"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 161 [Aryavimuktisena] taught this through the four [points] of (a) the basis of emptiness, (b) the manner of being empty, (c) the conventional term of being empty, and (d) the reason for this conventional term. (a) The first one consists of the six sense faculties. (b) As for the manner of being empty, the gateway to engaging in the meaning of solidity is the meaning of abiding. Through negating this, [it is clear that phenomena] do not abide in the collection of their causes and con­ditions. Also, since they lack arising, they lack perishing too. Therefore, [the slitras say that] a given [phenomenon], such as the eyes, is empty of this given [phenomenon] \"because it is without arising and ceasing.\" [Jayananda's] Madhyamakavataratika359 explains the meaning of abiding in a solidly exist­ing manner as being completely unchanging. Then, having negated change through this, [he says that Candrakirti] speaks of \"not ceasing\" in order to put an end to wondering, \"Is it that they cease later after having abided for a while?\" The Satasahasrikaprajiiaparamitabrhaffika says: The meaning of being neither of these two is to not exist either in a permanent or an impermanent way. Therefore, ultimately, the six sense faculties lack being entities, for otherwise they would have to be entities in either of these two [ways ).360 This manner of being empty is the same for all [following emptinesses]. {154} (c) The conventional term of [this] being empty is \"the emptiness of the internal.\" (d) The reason for applying this conventional term is that the eyes and so on are internal phenomena. 2) The basis of emptiness consists of the five objects. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the external.\" The reason for applying this conven­tional term is that they are not conjoined with mind. 3) The basis of emptiness consists of the five objects that are the supports of the sense faculties.361 The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the inter­nal and the external.\" The reason [for applying this conventional term] is that they are conjoined with mind and do not consist of the sense faculties. 4) The basis of emptiness consists of cognizing all phenomena to be emp­tiness or, according to the Madhyamakavatara, the lack of nature of [all] phenomena. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of emptiness.\" The rea­son is that this [emptiness] pacifies clinging [to emptiness] as being emptiness. 5) The basis of emptiness consists of the ten directions, such as east. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the great.\" The reason is that they represent a very vast sphere."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 Groundless Paths 6) The basis of emptiness consists of nirvaQa and the path that is its con­cordant basis. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the ultimate.\" The reason is that it is the supreme actuality to be attained. 7) The basis of emptiness consists of what arises from conditions-the three realms. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of conditioned phe­nomena.\" The reason is that [conditioned phenomena] are not established absolutely and therefore can be changed through remedies. 8) The basis of emptiness consists of what is unarisen-it is other than aris­ing, abiding, and ceasing, that is, unchanging. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena.\" {155} The reason is that it is devoid of arising and so on. 9) The basis of emptiness consists of what is beyond extremes, that is, empty of the extremes of permanence and impermanence. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of what is beyond extremes.\" The reason is that, in the middle, not the slightest reason for setting up extremes or parts is established. 10) The basis of emptiness consists of �ircling [in srupsara] without begin­ning, middle, and end. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of what is without beginning and end.\" The reason is that beginning and so on arise in accordance with the nature of phenomena or that they are exactly like the nature of phenomena. 11) The basis of emptiness consists of the pure side of srupsara. Or the Suddhamah-s62 explains that it is the mahayana that is not to be rejected. Both Brhaffik�3 explain that the skandhas are what is to be rejected, while the nirval)a without remainder is their nonexistence (the Kasyapa scripture speaks of the skandhas as what is rejected) and that this does not mean any repetition since the above nirvaQa [in emptiness (6)] refers to the nirvaQa with remainder. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of what is not rejected.\" 12) The basis of emptiness consists of the emptiness of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the primordial nature.\" The reason is that [emptiness] is primordially empty and therefore not made empty by any noble ones. Hence since conditioned phe­nomena change and unconditioned phenomena do not change, they cannot harm [emptiness in any way]. 13) The basis of emptiness consists of skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, con­tacts, feelings, what has fo rm, what lacks form, conditioned phenomena, and unconditioned phenomena. The conventional term {156} is \"the emptiness of all phenomena.\" The reason is that all phenomena are included in the [above]. 14) The basis of emptiness consists of [general characteristics] (such as arising and ceasing) and [specific characteristics] (such as being suitable as fo rm and being an experience). The conventional term is \"the emptiness of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 163 specifically characterized phenomena.\" The reason is that [the above] are gen­eral and particular characteristics. 15) The basis of emptiness consists of the three times, such as the past. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the unobservable.\" The reason is that, in each one of these [three], the other two are not observable. 16) The basis of emptiness is what is composed or made of many causes and conditions. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of the nature of nonentities.\" The reason is that the mere general [unit of the] collection of [the parts] that it is made of does not exist as an entity. 17) The basis of emptiness consists of the five skandhas. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of entities.\" The reason is that they are appropriating entities. 18) The basis of emptiness consists of space, the two cessations, and such­ness. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of nonentities.\" The reason is that they are nonentities. This is not a repetition of \"the emptiness of uncon­ditioned phenomena,\" for this one here is taught [from the perspective of] the instances and the above, from the perspective of the definition. 19) The basis of emptiness is the unmistaken nature of phenomena. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of self-entity.\" The reason is that [empti­ness] is not newly produced through the knowing or seeing of the noble ones. As fo r the meaning of knowing and seeing, the [Satasahasrikaparamita]­brhattika364 explains knowing as nonconceptual wisdom and {157} seeing as its subsequent attainment. The Vrttt'365 says that [the Buddha] speaks of seeing and knowing in order to eliminate inferential cognition and mistakenness, thus explaining them as perception and unmistakenness, respectively. This [emptiness] is not a repetition of \"the emptiness of the primordial nature\" because they are different in [the former presenting emptiness] in brief and [the latter], in detail. 20) The basis of emptiness is the entity of the other phenomenon. The conventional term is \"the emptiness of other-entity.\" As for the reason, the Madhyamakavatarabht4ya366 explains that [emptiness] is the supreme among phenomena. Or \"other\" refers to excellent wisdom and \"entity,\" to its object. Or it is the true end that is other than or beyond satp.siira.367 The Suddhamati says: Since it is supreme, it is other. Since it is the nature that is not pro­duced by anything other, it is the other-entity, that is, suchness.368 Here said [emptiness] is explained as emptiness through using this manner of presenting it as being other. Before, it was explained as emptiness through explaining it as the self-entity that is not produced by the noble ones.

These are described in the Madhyamakavatara. 375 The Madhyamakavatara explains the first quality as entering and ris­ing from samadhi. The ninth quality is [to be understood] according to the Bodhisattvabhumi: Through their seeing with wisdom, they operate from the earliest limit to the latest limit of one hundred eons. 376 Here, through \"shaking [one hundred worldly realms],\" [bodhisattvas] cause [beings] to aspire fo r being guided. Through \"going\" and \"illuminat­ing,\" they proceed to the abodes of those to be guided and, upon seeing them, mature them. As for \"operating from the earliest to the latest limits,\" fo r the sake of helping sentient beings to become free from their negative actions [bodhisattvas] demonstrate the ways in which [beings] wander in satp.sara through their karma. \"Opening a hundred gates of dharma\" means that [bodhisattvas], fo r the sake of ripening their own insight, reflect about the meaning of the [various] specifications of dharma. Likewise, on the second bhftmi they attain these twelve qualities one thou­sand times; on the third one, one hundred thousand times; on the fo urth one, one billion times; on the fifth one, ten billion times; on the sixth one, one trillion times; and on the seventh one, ten sixtillion times.

On the second bhfimi {164} [they realize it] as the actuality of being supreme because they realize that it is suitable to relinquish the obscurations. On the third bhfimi [they realize it] as being the natural outflow that is the supreme purpose because they are aware that searching the study [of the dharma] is a natural outflow of having realized the nature of phenomena and thus is the supreme cause. On the fo urth bhfimi [they realize] the nature of phenom­ena as the actuality of nonclinging because even the craving fo r the dharma comes to an end.

On the seventh bhfimi [they realize it] as the actuality of no difference because there are no different characteristics of dharma (such as the sfitras) in the dharmadhatu.

Also, through the change of state of the afflicted mind and the five [sense] gates together with their objects, in due order, [they realize] the nature of phenomena as being the matrix of mastery over nonconceptual wisdom and pure realms.

In this way, the ten cognitive obscu­rations-the nonaftlictive [forms of] ignorance that obscure said ten [aspects of the] dharmadhatu-are {165} progressively relinquished through the ten bhiimis that are their remedies because [the latter] are the antagonistic factors of said [ obscurations]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.4.2.

Presenting the tenable position You may wonder, \"Do these manners of realization that are explained in the Madhyantavibhaga constitute manners of realization during meditative equipoise or subsequent attainment?\" Since there are different manners of inducing certainty during the subsequent attainments [of] each [bhiimi], they represent the manners of realization of [subsequent attainment]. It is not feasible to claim any differences in the manner of realizing the nature of phenomena during meditative equipoise. If there were divisions in the nature of phenomena, the nature of phenomena would have the character of having many parts. This would also contradict the explanations that, with­out referring to the [different] bearers of this nature, [in itself] the nature of phenomena is indivisible. On the other hand, if, through the meditative equipoises [of the respective bhfunis], the nature of phenomena were realized as being [different] despite its being indivisible, the meditative equipoises of mahayana noble ones would be mistaken cognitions with regard to the nature of phenomena, just like a cognition for which two moons appear.378 You may wonder, \"So what is the object of meditative equipoise?\" Here there is ( 1) the assertion of meditative equipoise being without appearances and (2) the assertion of its being with appearances. (1) corresponds to what the Bodhicaryavatara says:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"170 Groundless Paths Once neither entities nor nonentities Remain before the mind, There is no other mental flux [either]. Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace. 379 This means that no cognition with regard to this object arises-to familiarize with just not seeing [or simply nothing to be seen] is expressed as \"seeing.\" (2) {166} Both Aryavimuktisena and master [Haribhadra, in their expla­nations on both the focal object of the knowledge of all aspects and the equipment of wisdom,] refute the systems of the sheer nature of phenom­ena being the object of meditative equipoise, meditative equipoise having the aspects of apprehender and apprehended, and its being without object. Then, they explain that the focal object of meditative equipoise is the implicative negation that is illusionlike dependent origination without any real entities. [In this,] it is not the case that subject and object are different, but the appear­ances that are experienced in meditative equipoise through the [perceptual] mode of self-awareness are empty of any nature. [However, these masters] do not assert that, in terms of the nature of phenomena, these appearances are established [in anyway]. From among these two [assertions (I) and (2)], this latter system is to be accepted for the time being.380 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1 .4.4.2.3.2.3.2.4.2.2.

Presenting a seeming dispute It may be said, \"[In this case,] the realization of mahayana noble ones would be untenable because there would be no realization of the nature of phenom­ena. Furthermore, the relinquishment of having relinquished all cognitive obscurations without exception would be untenable because there would be no realization of the nature of all phenomena being free from reference points. Also, the naturally abiding disposition would not be tenable as the support for the realizations of the three yanas progressing higher and higher because the nature of phenomena is without support and what is supported. The illusionlike appearance of the object of meditative equipoise would exist ultimately because it exists as381 the object of the meditative equipoise of mahayana noble ones. There is entailment [of the predicate by the reason] because this [meditative equipoise] is the final reasoning [cognition] of ana­lyzing the ultimate. {167} In addition, the explanations of even bodhisattvas on the ten bhiimis only realizing the nature of phenomena in a partial manner"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 171 and buddhas alone realizing it in its entirety would be untenable because the realization [of the nature of phenomena] just as it is would be complete from the first bh11mi onward.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.4.2.2.2. Refuting it through the correct answer As for the meaning of the nature of phenomena not being realized because of the first two consequences [above], if this refers to the meaning that the nature of phenomena is not established as dualistic appearance through meditative equipoise, the entailment [in these consequences] is not certain because the meaning of realizing the nature of phenomena is asserted as not seeing any referential phenomena whatsoever. But if this refers to the medita­tive equipoise [of bodhisattvas] not realizing [the nature of phenomena] in the manner of all reference points being at utter peace, the reason does not apply [to the subject]. In brief, . the meaning of realizing the basic nature, the nature of phe­nomena, or the nature free from reference points refers to the following. In wisdom, all [forms of] clinging are at utter peace and therefore no cognition that focuses on said [reference points] arises. However, in actual fact, it is not that anything that focuses takes anything as what it focuses on. For example, when a cognition arises as an aspect that corresponds to the object, though this object does not exist at the time of [this cognition] itself, [said cognition] is presented as realizing [this object]. Similarly, when meditative equipoise, in concordance with the nature of phenomena not abiding as any extreme what­soever, does not apprehend it as any extreme whatsoever, the conventional expression of [bodhisattvas] realizing such and such [aspects of the nature of phenomena] is used. The Madhyamakiivatiira says: When nonarising is true reality and the mind is free from arising too, Then, based on these, {168} it is as if this [mind] realizes true reality. Just as a cognition that has the aspect of something [is said to] cognize this object, This is [a case of] being cognized in terms of convention.382 There is also no consequence that the naturally abiding disposition is unten­able. The nature of phenomena is the nature free from reference points and it is realized in the manner of not seeing any reference points. Therefore, the explanation of [its being] the foundation and [the thirteen practices being] what is founded [on it is given] by merely having in mind that the qualities of the three yanas increase further [through realizing the nature of phenomena],"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172 Groundless Paths but not [in terms of their being any] fully qualified fo undation and what is fo unded [on it] . Though appearances exist as the objects of the meditative equipoises of mahayana noble ones, [this does] not [mean that] they become established ultimately. For through these [meditative equipoises] said [appearances] are not assessed as being real, but are assessed as being without reality. Otherwise, the [omniscient] knowledge of the sage had to be without object because, Uust as the meditative equipoises of bodhisattvas,] it is a final reasoning [cognition] of analyzing the ultimate. [In addition, from the above] it would fo llow that whatever is an object of a [buddha's omniscience] is established ultimately. As fo r the sutra [passages] that speak about the difference between realizing the nature of phenomena partially or completely, they represent explanations of this [nature of] phenomena being difficult to realize, the benefits of [such] realization, and so on in order to lead certain [persons] who possess the dis­position of the hina[yana] to the [maha]yana, but they are not [to be taken] literally. Thus, many sutras and treatises say that it is from the point of view of seeming [reality] that the nature of phenomena is established as the object of wisdom and is labeled as \"it is realized,\" but that this is not the case ultimately. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.

General enumeration Among the three ways of explaining [the enumeration of the factors to be relinquished through seeing], [the one] in the Abhidharmasamuccaya386 [is as follows]. Though the seeds of anger exist in the [psychophysical] supports of the higher realms, they cannot be manifested [there]. Or [conditions for] inputting these seeds are only contained within the level of the desire realm and their maturation is only experienced in the desire realm too. With this in mind, [the text] explains that, with anger being excluded from the [two] higher levels, the ten contaminations that exist on the levels of the desire realm and the nine on [each one of] the [two] higher realms wrongly engage"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"17 4 Groundless Paths all four realities without difference. Thus, [there are] 112 [factors to be relin­quished through seeing]. The Viniscayasa1f1grahar;zFB7 [speaks of] ninety-four since it excludes the first two views [about a real personality and about extremes] from engaging the remaining three realities except for the [reality of] suffering of all three realms. The Abhidharmakosa388 [says that], in the desire realm, [there are] ten [wrong engagements] in [the reality of] suffering. {171} From [the realities of] origin and cessation, it excludes three [wrong engagements] (the first two views and the last [view] of [holding ethics and spiritual disciplines] as para­mount) and from [the reality of] the path, only the first two views. Therefore, with regard to the four realities, in due order, [there] are ten, seven, seven, and eight [wrong engagements]. Through excluding anger too from the higher [realms], [there are respectively] nine, six, six, and five wrong engagements. Hence, in general, [there are] eighty-eight [altogether]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.1.2. Manners of wrong engagement You may wonder, \"If the factors to be relinquished through seeing are explained by way of wrong engagement, how many engagers are there, what are the objects of engagement, and what is the manner of engaging?\" As for the engagers, the secondary afflictions that are congruently associ­ated with the primary afflictions as well as other mental factors together with their primary minds are limitless. However, when summarized according to their type, the main ones are ten-desire, anger, pride, ignorance, doubt, views about a real personality, views about extremes, holding a view as paramount, holding ethics and spiritual disciplines as paramount, and wrong views. In brief, they are the five that are not a view and the five views. The objects of engagement also have limitless subdivisions in terms of their instances, but [they are all contained within] the four realities. As for the manner of engaging, for as long as the common characteristic of the four realities-being empty of a personal self-is not realized, these ten [wrong engagements] impel suffering through directly producing con­taminated karma, earlier ones producing later ones of the same type, and impelling and accomplishing later [karmic] maturations. Therefore, they are the causes of both [the realities of] suffering and its origin. Also, through focusing on these two [realities], these [wrong engagements] will increase, {172} so that said two [realities] also function as the causes and bases for the ten [wrong engagements]. When the four realities are realized to be empty of a personal self, the mutual increase of the [wrong engagements and the reali­ties of suffering and its origin] is put to an end. Therefore, these ten are the wrong engagements in [the realities of] suffering and its origin because they are relinquished through seeing the nature of these two [realities]."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 175 Likewise, under the sway of taking delight in sarp.sara when not seeing that the four realities lack a self, [beings] entertain the notion that the causes and results in terms of liberation are [like] an abyss and thus are afraid. Once they see [that the four realities lack a self], this fear too is put to an end through relinquishing said ten afflictions. Therefore, the ten afflictions that are thus relinquished are the wrong engagements in the two [realities of cessation and the path] in that they [cause] fear about what is not to be feared-cessation and the path. One should know that there are three [kinds of] wrong engagement-( I) direct, (2) indirect, and (3) being under influence. (1) As for direct wrong engagement, five-three views (the first two and the last one) and two non­views (ignorance and doubt)-engage wrongly in the [four] realities in a direct manner. For in due order, [through these five,] one clings to the [four] realities as being a self and what is mine; clings [to them] as being permanent or impermanent; denies that the aspects of these realities exist or superim­poses aspects onto them that are other than how they are taught; is ignorant about the nature of the realities; and entertains doubts as to whether these [realities] are or are not exactly as they are taught. {173} The explanation in the Abhidharmasamuccaya389 that doubt means to wrongly engage in the rem­edies bears the intention that the four realities are the objects of the remedies. (2) As for wrongly engaging [in the four realities] in an indirect manner, [there are] four-the two among the views that hold [views or ethics and spiri­tual disciplines] as paramount and the two among nonviews that are desire and pride. For in due order, [through these four,] one superimposes that the [three] views that engage wrongly in a direct manner are paramount; regards bad ways of conduct connected with bad views as yielding purity and libera­tion; craves for bad views; and one's mind is haughty through bad views.390 Thus, [these four] mistakenly focus on those afflictions that focus on [the realities] in other ways and thus intervene between [these four] and the [four] realities. (3) Anger represents the [manner of] engagement of being under influence because it means wrongly engaging [in the four realities] under the influence of a mind malicious toward views that discord with one's own view. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.2. The fa ctors to be relinquished through fa miliarization as subdivided in terms of levels This has two parts: 1) Definitions 2) Divisions"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.2.1. Definitions The general definition [of fa ctors to be relinquished through familiarization] is \"the ignorance that is to be overcome through the path of fa miliarization.\" The definitions of the afflictive obscurations and the cognitive obscurations [to be relinquished through fa miliarization] are \"the afflicted and nonaf­flicted ignorances, respectively, that are to be overcome through the path of familiarization.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.2.2.Divisions There are two ways of explaining this. In the system of the Abhidharma­samuccaya,391 there are six fa ctors to be relinquished through familiarization in the desire realm-views about a real personality, views about extremes, desire, anger, pride, and ignorance. In the higher realms, there are five ( [the same] except anger). When [these sixteen] are divided in terms of [the nine] levels [of the three realms], there are fo rty-six-six in the desire realm and fo rty on the eight [levels of the] dhyanas and fo rm[less absorptions]. When divided in terms of these levels and [the fa ctors to be relinquished] being great, medium, [and lesser], the five [factors] (except anger) [to be relinquished] on each one of said nine [levels] are divided into nine each, which makes five [sets of] eighty-one. Through dividing the anger in the desire realm into nine [and adding these nine, one arrives at a total of]414. In the system of the Abhidharmakosa, 392 when divided by nature, there are fo ur-desire, anger, pride, and ignorance. When divided in terms of the realms, there are ten- [the above fo ur plus] the three except anger in each one of the [two] higher [realms]. When divided in terms of the levels and [the fa c­tors to be relinquished] being great, medium, [and lesser,] there are 252. This is the system of the Va ibha�ikas, who assert that the [first] two views are only fa ctors to be relinquished through seeing. The fo rmer [system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya] corresponds to the Paficaskandhaprakara�;�a [saying] : The last three views and doubt are nothing but imputational. The remaining ones are both imputational and innate. 393 This also corresponds to the Sautrantika [system]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.3. Analysis of the presentation of such subdivisions Since the fa ctors to be relinquished through seeing are the coarse fa ctors that are produced through the mind being affected by bad philosophical sys­tems, they are relinquished merely through directly seeing the [four] realities."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 177 Therefore, they are explained by way of the wrong engagements in the [sixteen] aspects of the [four] realities. As for the factors to be relinquished through familiarization, though they do not arise from imputations through bad philo­sophical systems, they are the subtle innate [obscuring] factors that operate since beginningless [time]. Therefore, they need to be relinquished [progres­sively] through becoming [increasingly] familiar with said seeing of the [four] realities {175} ([starting] from the great [over] the medium [down to the lesser degrees of these factors to be relinquished]), but they cannot be relinquished right upon merely seeing [the realities]. Therefore, they are presented as great, medium, [and lesser] by way of the levels [of the path of familiarization]. As for the meaning of \"imputational\" and \"innate\" in terms of the factors to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization, it refers to one's mind being altered versus not being altered through non-Buddhist philosophical systems, but not to [the factors to be relinquished] being manifest versus latent. Thus, the factors to be relinquished through seeing are [the wrong engagements in] the [four] realities, while the factors to be relinquished through familiarization are the wrong engagements in objects. That the factors to be relinquished through seeing are presented in two different [ways] in the Viniscayasarrtgraha�i and the Abhidharmasamuccaya is due to [the former] being a coarser [presentation and the latter being] a more refined one. However, in the context of the mahayana, the system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya should be accepted [as being authoritative for] both the factors to be relinquished through seeing and the factors to be relin­quished through familiarization. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.5.2.4. Manners of relinquishment This has two parts. (1) As for the manner in which the factors to be relin­quished through seeing are relinquished, the ViniScayasarrtgraha�r94 and the Abhidharmakosa395 explain that the factors of the desire realm with regard to [the reality of] suffering that are to be relinquished through seeing [are relinquished through] both the dharma readiness and the dharma cognition of suffering. The factors of the higher realms with regard to suffering that are to be relinquished through seeing are relinquished through both the subse­quent readiness and the subsequent cognition of suffering. The same goes for the remaining realities. Thus, the remedies [for the factors to be relinquished through seeing] of the desire realm and the higher realms are different. Dre [Sherab Bar] explains that this is [the system] of the sravakas. The system of the Abhidharmasamuccaya will be explained below [in the section on the knowledge of the path]. (2) The manner in which the factors to be relinquished through familiarization are relinquished [is discussed] in three parts-( a) the manner that is described"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"178 Groundless Paths in the abhidharma, (b) examining what its intention is, and (c) instruction on other features of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies. 2a) There are two manners of relinquishment with regard to the afflictions­{176} (a) relinquishment by way of the aspects of [comparing between] what is peaceful and what is coarse and (b) relinquishment by way of the aspect of identitylessness. 2aa) The factors to be relinquished through familiarization on the nine lev­els [of the three realms] are subdivided into nine each. The remedies for them are a corresponding number (in terms of substance) of mundane and supra­mundane paths of familiarization. However, through the mundane path of familiarization there is no relinquishment of the nine396 factors of the Peak of Existence to be relinquished. Through the first one [(the mundane path)], the manifest [factors to be relinquished through familiarization] are relinquished and, through the second one [(the supramundane path)], the latent ones. Also, the first one is in common with the tirthikas. 2ab) [The relinquishment by way of the aspect of identitylessness] refers to the uncommon path of this [Buddhist] dharma. [According to the abhidharma,] there are two manners in which the supramundane path of familiarization relinquishes its factors to be relinquished. Some sravakas relinquish the great, medium, and lesser afflictions of the three realms simul­taneously through familiarizing with personal identitylessness by combining [said afflictions] and not dividing them in terms of the realms and their levels. [Others] relinquish [these afflictions] gradually through familiarizing [with personal identitylessness] in a progressive manner throughout the [nine] lev­els [into which the three realms] are divided. In speaking about these two manners [of relinquishment, the abhidharma] does not present any features in which [the manner of relinquishment of] the mahayana would be diff erent. 2b) As for examining what the intention of this [explanation] is, the state­ments [in certain abhidharma sfitras] that one transcends the three realms through paths that bear the aspects of [comparing between] what is peaceful and what is coarse are merely statements [that serve] as means to gradually guide those to be guided who are of dull faculties (who regard [saip.saric] exis­tence as having qualities, do not engage in a mindset of relinquishing it, and thus are temporarily not [suitable] vessels for teaching them identitylessness) toward the meaning of identitylessness. Therefore, let alone [stopping] all the manifest afflictions on said [nine] levels [of the three realms], {177} these paths [only] weaken just the viewing of these [respective] levels as being the best by craving for them, but they are not even able to stop all manifest crav­ing [for such levels]. For they do not damage the cause of such [craving]-the clinging to a self and what is mine."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 179 Hence, [the paths that] bear the aspects of [comparing between] what is peaceful and what is coarse are merely [means] that make the mind stream a suitable vessel [for the teachings on identitylessness], whereas the paths of all three yanas that [actually] liberate from the afflictions bear the aspect of identitylessness. One should understand that both manifest and latent afflictions are relinquished by way of mentally engaging in aspiring for per­sonal identitylessness and mentally engaging in the true reality [of personal identitylessness]. 397 2c) The instruction on other features of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies is threefold-( a) gradual and simultaneous relinquishment, (b) nature of the factors to be relinquished, and (c) examining what the meaning of relinquishment and liberation is. 2ca) As for gradual and simultaneous relinquishment, [according to the Vrtti and the Aloka,] the [factors to be relinquished through familiarization] are not divided into [the various levels of] the three realms, but there are nine [degrees of the] factors to be relinquished through familiarization (the conceptions [about apprehender and apprehended]) in terms of their being easier or harder to relinquish. Therefore, they are relinquished through nine greater and lesser remedies. It is through directly combining the respective great, medium, and lesser [degrees] of these [factors] of the three realms [to be relinquished] that bodhisattvas relinquish them simultaneously. That is, through familiarizing with the freedom from reference points that consists of all phenomena of the three realms being empty of the two [types of] iden­tity, the clinging to entities is put to an end. Once this [clinging] comes to an end, all conceptions about apprehender and apprehended of the three realms, which are caused by this [clinging), will also cease, just as a fire when its fire­wood has been consumed. 2cb) As for the nature of the factors to be relinquished, from among mani­fest and latent afflictions, the relinquishment of the latent ones is prioritized. As the ViniScayasarpgrahar.zi says: For if [the afflictions] are relinquished from [the side of] the fetters, but not from [the side of] the latencies, the fetters will arise again and again. But if they are relinquished from [the side of] the laten­cies, [the afflictions] will absolutely not arise [again]-neither from the latencies nor from the fetters.398 2cc) As for the meaning of relinquishment and liberation, through the force of a powerful remedy arising in the mind stream, a mind stream that was a vessel for factors to be relinquished before changes state into not being such a vessel. In this way, it is made [a mind stream] in which there is no chance for said factors to be relinquished to arise [again]."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.3.2.6. The signs of having attained the bhiimis In their dreams, [bodhisattvas] see the following. On the first bhOmi, this worldly realm of the great thousan� within a trichiliocosm is completely filled with one quintillion of treasuries. On the second one, this worldly realm, which has become like the palm of a hand, is excellently adorned with many hundreds of quintillions of jewels. On the third one, being heroes who [wear] armor and hold [weapons] in their hands, they overcome all opponents. On the fourth one, the four wind mal)qalas from the four directions scatter all kinds of flowers over the great earth that is replete with everything. On the fifth one, women who are adorned with all [kinds of] ornaments put garlands of magnolia flowers on their heads. On the sixth one, they see a pond with four stairways [leading down into it. Its bottom] is covered with golden sand and {179} it is clear and unpolluted. It is filled with water that possesses the eight qualities and this water is adorned with blue water lilies, night water lil­ies, and white lotuses. Then, they see themselves enjoying it by frolicking in it. On the seventh one, they see the abysses of the sentient beings in hell to their right and left sides, while they themselves return without being injured or weakened [in any way]. On the eighth one, [they see two] lions (the kings of wild animals) with a mane and wearing a crown, who stand on the two shoul­ders [of the bodhisattvas] and frighten all lesser carnivores. On the ninth one, they see a cakravartin, who is surrounded by many tens of quadrillions of per­sons and looks straight ahead, a white parasol adorned with all kinds of jewels being held above his head. On the tenth one, they see the body of a tathagata with [a halo of] goldlike light [radiating out to the distance of] an armspan. He is surrounded by many tens of quadrillions of Brahmas, looks straight ahead, and teaches the dharma. These signs are to be understood as the signs that correspond to the ten paramitas being respectively predominant on the ten bhOmis. As for the signs on the sixth bhumi, the following is explained. The pond [symbolizes] the teaching of the Buddha; the four stairways, the four [Buddhist] philosophical systems that are the gateways fo r entering this [teaching]; [its bottom] being covered by golden sand, the fundamental basis-the disposition; and its being clear and unpolluted, [this disposition's] natural purity and [its purity of] adventitious [stains]. As fo r water having eight qualities, it is said: Cool, well-tasting, light, soft, Clear, {180} without impurities, Not harming the stomach, when drunk, And not harming the throat."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 181 To be filled with such water [symbolizes] the eightfold path of noble ones.

You may wonder, \"If these are dream signs, what about [the fact of mind] not being associated with the five obscurations (such as sleep) from [the level of] heat pnward?\" There is no flaw because there are two [kinds of] sleep-the afflicting one that makes the consciousnesses that engage objects powerless during sleep and the one that makes the body flourish and is counted as vir­tue. Therefore, [the above dream signs refer to bodhisattvas on the bhfunis] lacking the former [kind of sleep] while possessing the latter one.

(1) As the remedy for being attached to fine food, through eating just whatever one receives in households with which one is acquainted, one is content with whatever [alms] one receives. Also, having done one's [begging] round in due order from household to household and having taken [whatever one receives], one eats whatever one has obtained and does not go to [those households] that are commended, thinking, \"From this household I will get as much food as I like.\" This means to do one's beg­ging rounds progressively [from one household to another without selecting]. If these two are taken as subdivisions, the qualities of abstinence are thirteen and when they are not taken as subdivisions, [those qualities] are twelve. { 183} (2)-(3) As the remedies for being attached to a lot of food, one is a single­seater, who eats [only] while sitting on one seat and does not [eat] after having stood up from it. Also, after having sat down in order to eat, one does not eat until one has taken the entire amount of food that will sustain one's life [for a"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"184 Groundless Paths day]. Thinking, \"This will sustain me,\" one then eats all [this food] at once and does not take [any more food] after having eaten [that amount]. (4) As the remedy for being attached to a lot of clothes, one is a three-robe wearer, surviving with three [robes] (the patched robe, the upper robe, and the lower robe) and not keeping any more clothes than these. (5)-(6) The following two are to relinquish attachment to soft and fine clothes. One is a [coarse] wool wearer, with one's three dharma robes and any further clothes being made of such wool, or, as the Marmakaumudi [says]: They are wool wearers since they wear wool, hemp, and so on.402 One wears the dress of a dung sweeper, that is, clothes that have been thrown out on garbage heaps and are soiled with impure [substances], such as urine and feces, and then are taken by a tailor, washed, patched together, and dyed. (7)-(10) The following four are to relinquish attachment to bedding. In order to relinquish hustle and bustle, one lives in isolated places cut off from towns at the distance of an earshot; one is a tree-dweller who stays under trees; one is an open-air dweller who lives without anything over [one's head]; and one is a charnel ground dweller who stays in places where all dead people are deposited. {184} (11)-(12) As the remedies for being attached to lying down on one's side and the comfort of sleeping, one sleeps in a sitting position, that is, one does not rest on one's back or one's side, but spends one's time resting while squat­ting on a bed, a platform, or a mat of grass. One leaves the ground as it is, that is, one makes a onetime bedding of grass and leaves, just as they are, without exchanging or fixing them up again and again. These are to relinquish attach­ment to beds, mats, and coverings. These [qualities] are [described] according to the Sravakabhumi and the Marmakaumudi. Some, by taking the last two as referring to conduct, explain [only] four to be in terms of bedding. b) As for explaining the collective term, for example, if wool is not shaken and pulled apart, it is not suitable [to be made] into a thread, but it is suit­able in the opposite case. Likewise, if one is attached to alms, dharma robes, and bedding, the mind is not workable. However, through these qualities, the mind is purified into being workable in order to abide in pure conduct. Therefore, they are called \"qualities of abstinence.\"403 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2.3.2.4.

(5) The final deliverance into the nonabiding nirvat}.a beyond extremes refers to there being neither any initial limit (permanence), nor any later limit (extinction), nor any middle that is set up by these two.

(7) The final deliverance into the knowledge of all aspects means to be without clinging despite knowing all aspects of phenomena. (8) The final deliverance of [the path] is the [cognizing] subject of the special path that consists of the six paramitas free from observing the three spheres. {186} Thus, there are seven on the path of nonlearning and one on the path of learning. These eight practices of final deliverance are what deliver [bodhi­sattvas] onto the eight levels of ultimate final deliverance and entail the manner of all phenomena being unobservable.405 It is explained here that bodhisattvas, through taking nonclinging as the basis, Engage in listening to and practicing the instructions without clinging"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 Groundless Paths And are finally delivered into the eight deliverances without clinging, Which is the excellent path to the knowledge of all aspects.

The supports for the arising of the knowledge of the path In the context of the sutra [passages] that explain the knowledge of the path, the natural light of the Tathagata eclipses the light of the gods. {187} Through this, he overcomes their pride and makes them suitable vessels for the arising of the knowledge of the path. As illustrated by this, he makes one understand that those in whom pride is overcome are the vessels for the knowledge of the path. The Abhin#krama�Jasfttra says that one needs to be free from both pride and faintheartedness. Thus, [the supports] are like that. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. 1 .2.

Those who have entered the certainty of what is truly flawless lack the power to give rise to the mindset for unsurpassable perfect enlightenment because they have severed the stream of sa�p.sara. 408 However, I shall rejoice if they too give rise to the mindset for unsurpassable perfect enlightenment. The meaning of the former and the latter sfttra [passages] is as follows. They respectively teach that the knowledge of the path arises solely in the mind streams of [those who] have given rise to bodhicitta (temporary definiteness) and that any beings to be guided who belong to the three [types] of possess­ing [one of the three] dispositions will [eventually] give rise to bodhicitta and [attain] unsurpassable perfect enlightenment (ultimate indefiniteness). As fo r the former sfttra passage, the meaning of \"certainty about what is true [or flaw­less]\" is explained as referring to the realizations on all sravaka paths {188} and the meaning of \"have severed,\" as the cause for being born in satp.sara having come to a end through having relinquished all afflictions without exception. The latter [passage] teaches that also sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats and so on will [attain] unsurpassable perfect enlightenment. A critical analysis of this has three parts: 1) The manners of asserting the three yanas as being expedient or definitive 2) Where sravakas and pratyekabuddhas enter the mahayana 3) Whether satp.sara has or does not have an end 1) This is twofold-the manners of asserting [the three yanas] as being of definitive and expedient meaning, respectively. 1a) To assert the three yanas as being of definitive meaning has two parts: a) The sfttras that are followed b) How their meaning is explained 1aa) It is explained that [the sfttras] that are followed consist of the following. The Samdhinirmocana[sutra] says that it is impossible for those sravakas who proceed to the peace [of their own nirvW).a alone] to tum to the mahayana, while it is possible for those who transform [into perfect buddhahood] to tum to the mahayana. [It says] that the single yana is of expedient meaning, while the three yanas are of definitive meaning. The Daiadharmaka[sutra] and the Ratnameghasutra [are also followed]."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"188 Groundless Paths lab) How their meaning is explained [is discussed in] three parts: 1) Presenting the specific system [of those who assert the three yanas as being of definitive meaning] 2) Eliminating [seeming] internal contradictions in it 3) Eliminating [seeming] contradictions with other sfttras labl) As for presenting the specific system [of those who assert three yanas], the ViniScayasarttgrahal;li explains that it is impossible for sravakas to tum to the mahayana from [their nirviil)a] without remainder, while they [can] turn [to it] from [the nirviil)a] with remainder. As for their manner of turning [to the mahayana], it explains that they prolong their lifetime through the force of their miraculous powers and thus accomplish enlightenment. However, their own bodies {189} are blessed so as not to pass into nirviil)a and, from the perspective of others, they demonstrate the manner of passing into [the nirval}.a] without remainder with an emanated body. Thereafter, they dwell in isolated places, with their former [type of] body not being seen even by the gods, and fully complete the accumulations. During that time, due to being fond of their own welfare, they become heedless with regard to cultivating the path and are exhorted by buddhas and bodhisattvas.409 In [the nirviil)a] with­out remainder, [there is no continuum of] following [moments of] awareness that connect [with the last one]. Therefore, what remains is solely the stainless unconditioned dhatu, while all obscurations without exception have come to an end. In this, [said sravakas] are not different from tathagatas, but since they have passed into nirviil)a without having made aspiration prayers before and without the motivation to rise [from it], they do not perform the activities of tathagatas. 410 Thus, [the text] explains that the continuum of conditioned phe­nomena has become extinguished. Also, Ratniikara5anti establishes through many means of proof that the three yanas are of definitive meaning. You may wonder, \"So what are the means of proof for [the three yanas] being of definitive meaning?\" They are twofold-scripture and reasoning. The scriptures consist of the statements in the Sarttdhinirmocana[sutra] that were explained above, the Lankiivatiira[sutra] speaking of five disposi­tions, the Alqayamatinirdesa[sutra] saying, \"These three are yanas that finally deliver,\" and the Dhiitubahutakasutra411 teaching that sentient beings are of various mental constitutions. Likewise, also other sfttras speak of the three yanas as being distinct. Secondly, the reasonings {190} are as follows. Some sentient beings pos­sess the motivation to benefit others and others delight in the suffering of others. Likewise, some wish for the mere happiness of [sarp.saric] existence and create merit, others tum away from it and make efforts in order to liber­ate themselves, and some think that only others are to be liberated and thus accomplish generosity and so on as the causes for perfect enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 189 Therefore, one infers that there are different causes (the [above] wishes) [for different paths] in sentient beings because different results are produced by these causes. Since [sentient beings] would not have such different wishes if they did not have distinct dispositions, different disposition are established. Thus, the yanas as the results [of these different dispositions] are also of vari­ous kinds. Since _arhats have relinquished [all] fe tters of [ srup.saric] existence, they do not take birth there [anymore] . Therefore, it is impossible for them to attain the enlightenment [of a buddha] that is asserted to be attained via many lifetimes. lab2) As fo r eliminating internal contradictions in this [position], it may be said, \"In the ViniScayasalflgrahatzi it is explained that arhats do not take rebirth and that, ultimately, the dispositions are different. This contradicts [Asailga's] commentary on the Uttaratantra. [For,] by quoting the Srimala[devi]sutra, it teaches that there are the inconceivable [forms of] death, transition, and rebirth, and that �e two yanas [of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] are tempo­rary paths. By adducing a passage from the Saddharmaputz4arika[sutra, the Uttaratantra]412 also says that sravakas are exhorted by the tathagatas and thus brought into the mahayana.\" {191} [The Viniscayasalflgrahatzi] does not contradict the first [statement in Asailga's commentary. For,] with regard to those sravakas who transform [into buddhahood] and dwell in isolated places with their [own physical] bodies [that possess the] sense fa culties, the Ratnagotravibhagavyakhya has in mind that they are beyond any births and deaths within the three realms, but possess mental latencies (the fo undation of the cognitive obscurations), the karma that is motivated by these, and the mental body that is supported by those two. [With this in mind, the text] explains that [said sravaka arhats] take rebirth with a mental body, fo r which the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance and uncontaminated karma function as cause and condition, respectively.413 However, when arhats have died, [there is no continuum of] fo llowing [moments of] awareness that connect [with their last one]. [The Viniscayasal'f'lgrahatzi] does not contradict the second [statement in Asailga's commentary] either. [For the latter] explains that the fruitions of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are temporary like a magically created city in the middle of a wilderness.414 It is because sravakas and pratyekabuddhas only have limited [degrees of] relinquishment that [the text] teaches their possessing the fully qualified nirval}.a as [representing a statement of] expedient meaning, but it does not teach that the three yanas are of expedient meaning by virtue of all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas [eventually] turning to the mahayana. [The Viniscayasal'f'lgrahatzi] does also not contradict the third [state­ment in the Uttaratantra].

The seven are as fo llows. (1) The dharmadhatu of the three yanas in which to travel or of the [three kinds of] persons [who travel in them] is the same in not being different, just like space. (2) The yanas that represent the travelers-the three [kinds of] persons-are the same in being identityless. (3) The yanas for the sake of which one travels-their fruitions (liberation)-are the same. (4) Different dispositions being the same means that those with the uncertain sravaka disposition enter the mahayana and become buddhas. Therefore, [those with] two different dispositions enter a single path. (5) \"Attaining the two attitudes\" means that (a) tathagatas, from the first bhiimi onward, find the equality of the nature of themselves and sentient beings not being two. (b) When certain sravakas whose disposition is certain temporarily engage in the conduct of bodhisattvas, then give it up, enter the sravakayana, and attain the nirvaJ)a of this [latter yana], similar to tathagatas thinking, \"I became a Buddha by virtue of having engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattva before,\" they think, { 193} \"By virtue of my having engaged in the conduct of a bodhisattva through the power of a buddha before, I will become a buddha.\" Thus, they attain an attitude similar [to the one of a buddha] just briefly. (6) \"Emanating\" means that [buddhas], fo r the sake of those to be guided, dem­onstrate the manner of passing into nirvaJ)a through the sravakayana many times. (7) \"Culmination\" refers to there being no dharma that is more emi­nent than the mahayana. Therefore, by having in mind these seven [bases of intention], it is taught that the yana is definitely a single one. As fo r the pur­pose [of this teaching], the same [text] says:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"It is in order to guide some And in order to take care of others That the perfect buddhas Translations: The General Topics 191 Ta ught a single yana fo r those who are uncertain.416 \"Some\" refers to the sravakas and \"others,\" to bodhisattvas with uncertain disposition. It is said that this does not contradict sravakas being prophesied as buddhas because such a [prophecy bears] the intention of [its referring to] emanated sravakas or sravakas who transform [into buddhas] . Furthermore, [the Aloka] explains that these [people who assert three yanas] hold the siitra [passage] on the definite object as being of definitive meaning and the siitra [passage] on pervasiveness, as being of expedient meaning, with the [latter] meaning that [all beings] are pervaded by the disposition.417 1 b) To assert the three yanas as being of expedient meaning has two parts: a) The siitras that are fo llowed b) The manner in which this is presented 1ba) The Lankavatara[sutra says] : As long as mind operates, There is no limit for yanas. But once mind changes state fundamentally, There are no yanas and no traveling [in them]. It is the very lack of any presentation of yanas That I refer to as the single yana. {194} But in order to guide childish beings, I speak of different yanas.418 The \"Chapter of the One Who Is Truthful\" in the [Saddharma]put:�t/arika[sutra] and others are also fo llowed. 1 bb) The manner in which this is presented [has two parts]: 1) How master [Nagarjuna] explains the meaning of these siitras 2) The manner in which his fo llowers eliminate disputes about this lbbl) The [Bodhi]cittavivarat:�a says: For those who are weary of the path of [ sa�psaric] existence, In order to give them a rest, [the Buddha] spoke of Two [kinds of] wisdom that arise from the mahayana, But this is not the case ultimately.419"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"192 Groundless Paths The Niraupamyastava says: Since the dharmadhatu is without distinction, There is no difference between the yanas, 0 lord­Your declaration of three yanas Is fo r the sake of introducing sentient beings.420 The fo rmer [verse says] that the three yanas are of expedient meaning because, finally, sravakas and pratyekabuddhas need to be introduced to the mahayana. The latter one teaches the fo llowing. If the actuality of true reality is not real­ized [in a certain yana] , [this yana] is not suitable as a fully qualified yana that transcends [satp.saric] existence. Since true reality is without distinction, there are no different manners of realization in the minds that realize this [true reality]. Therefore, any statements about three yanas by way of [saying that] hinayana and mahayana [have] different manners of realization are of expedient meaning. Thus, [these two verses] describe two ways of presenting [the three yanas] as being of expedient meaning. The latter one also repre­sents a [scriptural] source fo r [the fact that one], through the sravaka-and pratyekabuddhayanas, realizes the lack of nature of phenomena.421 lbb2) As for the manner in which [Nagarjuna's] fo llowers eliminate disputes about this, {195} the scriptures adduced by the Vijfiaptivadins do not inval­idate [the above explanation] because [the siitras] speak about three yanas with the intention that the dispositions are individually certain only fo r a cer­tain while, but not fo r the reason that they are absolutely certain. For even in the Lankavatara[sutra]'s statements about those who are without disposition, it is said that they eventually, through the power of a buddha, strive fo r roots of virtue. One is also not able to prove [three yanas] through reasoning. If the cer­tainty of three yanas is asserted by way of different practices and aspirations since sentient beings have countless manners of practicing and [countless] manners of aspiring, the number of yanas would be of an equally [countless] number. Nor is such certainty established through the manners of practice or the particular wishes [of beings]. For it appears that some who possess the motivation of wishing to benefit others, through meeting evil friends and so on turn into people who delight in others' suffering, while those who delight in others' suffering, under the influence of meeting spiritual friends and so on tum into the opposite. [Thus, the certainty of] three dispositions and, by virtue of that, the certainty of three yanas is not established due to said dif­fe rent wishes. Also, the assertion that rebirths of arhats are terminated is not reasonable because the mother [ siitras] and the Sri mala[ devisutra] say that, though their"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 193 births and deaths by virtue of karma and afflictions are terminated, they [still] have births and deaths that are inconceivable transformations and that their knowledge of termination and nonarising is of expedient meaning. {196} Therefore, through having relinquished the afflictions of the three [realms of] existence, their being born in the three realms is put to an end, but what is not put to an end is their dwelling in the uncontaminated dhatu through being born miraculously in a lotus bud in a pure realm.422 2) Where sravakas and pratyekabuddhas enter the mahayana Though there is the explanation in the Chinese commentary on the Sa1?1dhinirmocana[sutra]423 that they enter [the mahayana] on the eighth bh11mi, most scholars hold that it is justified for them to enter on the path of accumulation. Afi for their manner of rising from the uncontaminated dhatu, it corresponds to what the Lankavatara[sutra says]: Having attained the samadhi body, They do not awaken until the end of eons. Just as drunken persons awaken Once they are not drunk anymore, So they will attain my body, Which is called \"the buddhadharmas. \"424 You may wonder, \"In what time do they attain enlightenment?\" Some assert that they are one countless eon slower than bodhisattvas and some assert that they are forty countless [eons slower].425 3) Whether saip.sara has or does not have an end [There are] two assertions, [saying] (a) that it does not have an end because the nature of saip.sara is to be infinite and, just like space, interminable and (b) that it has an end because the remedial factors are able to terminate it, just like a film on gold. From among these, master [Haribhadra] obviously holds the latter one and Abhayakaragupta proves through both scriptures and reasoning that [saip.sara] has an end. However, in general, the Bhagavan said both-that saip.sara has and does not have an end. {197} Though there are means of proof for both, for the time being the approach of [saq1sara] having no end is adopted [here] for the following reasons-the mistakenness [of thinking that] a result [(nirvill).a as the end of saip.sara)] arises definitely, though it is [only] suitable to arise; the realm of sentient beings not showing any decrease since it, just like space, is not established as having any extent in terms of [its beings] being more or fewer; and the explanation that the bearer of the emptiness of what is without beginning and end (that which is to be"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194 Groundless Paths empty) is satpsara.

As a means of proof for this, [the text] presents [bodhisattvas'] assuming existences as they wish. {198} Since these two [types of craving] are explained as being the impregnations of the negative tendencies of desire with regard to the desire realm and the higher realms, [the afflictions that are not relinquished] must be asserted in this way. 1 b) The explanation in the sutras has two parts: 1ba) The explanation in the Sagaramati[pariprccha]sutra says: You may wonder, \"What are their afflictions that are the causes for satpsara and are congruently associated with roots of virtue?\" They are as follows-never being content with [their efforts in] seeking out the accumulation of merit, taking rebirth in [ satpsaric] existence as they wish, striving to meet buddhas, never being weary of matur­ing sentient beings, making efforts in grasping the genuine dharma, exerting themselves in whatever activities of [benefit for] sentient beings there are, not being separated from the activities of desiring the dharma, and not rejecting the trainings in the paramitas."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 195 Thus, [said afflictions] are these eight. As for the question of \"afflictions that are congruently associated with roots of virtue\" not being tenable since these are not afflictions, if they are roots of virtue, [the bodhisattva Sagaramati asks] in the same [s'iitr a]: Bhagavan, if these are roots of virtue, for what reason are they called \"afflictions\"? As the answer [to this, the Buddha says] that, though they are not actual afflictions, the reason for labeling them with this name lies in their being similar to [afflictions] in their function because afflictions connect one with the three realms [and] these [nominal afflictions] also connect [bodhisattvas] with the [three realms]. As for the invalidation of the explicit [statement of their being afflictions, the s'iitra] says: And And This is because they are not able to afflict the mind. {199} Sagaramati, thus, these afflictions that have such a nature connect bodhisattvas with the three realms-the three realms originate from the afflictions. They are [afflictions] because they connect [bodhisattvas] with the three realms for as long as these exist, but not because they afflict the mind. The purpose of labeling [them as afflictions] is not explicitly stated in the s'ii tra, but since it teaches that \"bodhisattvas emphasize the welfare of oth­ers,\" this is [the purpose]. [Bodhisattvas] know how to not relinquish said afflictions for their own welfare in order to connect [through them] with [ saip.siiric] existence for the welfare of others. lbb) What appears in the Srimala[devi]sutra is as follows: Bhagavan, for example, through the condition of grasping, the three [realms of] existence arise from contaminated causes. Likewise, Bhagavan, through the condition of the ground of the latent ten­dencies of ignorance, what arise from uncontaminated causes are"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"196 Groundless Paths the three bodies of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have attained mastery, which are of a mental nature.428 Thus, also this [sfitra] does not assert [these causes for being reborn in satp.sara] as being contaminated karma and afflictions. As for \"the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance,\" it consists of the subtle contaminated impregnations of negative tendencies that the Viniscayasarrzgraha1;1;429 explains as being relinquished solely by the wisdom of a tathagata. As an example for [these impregnations], former [masters] {200} explain that in a container into which musk was poured, one still smells it even if the [musk] is not [in it anymore], and that the same goes for the latencies that function as the supports for the [primary] afflictions and sec­ondary afflictions even if [these afflictions] have been relinquished. As for \"uncontaminated karma,\" it consists of the intentions that serve as the causes for [sa�p.saric] existence, but are not mixed with afflictions. They manifest in the ways of the eight [afflictions] that were taught above. 2) Ascertaining this through dispute and answer has two parts: a) Negating imputed extreme [positions on this] b) Presenting the meaning as it is 2a) Negating extreme [positions on this] Some earlier Tibetans say about the meaning of [bodhisattvas] not relin­quishing the afflictions, \"For promoting the welfare of others, bodhisattvas must take rebirth in [saJ:p.saric] existence. However since they also need afflic­tions as the causes for this, [these afflictions and their resulting rebirths] are presented as being like ferment and curdled milk.\" Atuladasa asserts, \"There are four capacities of afflictions-producing suffering, obstructing the arising of their remedies, taking birth in [satp.saric] existence, and producing what is similar to their own type. From among these, the first two are relinquished and the latter two are not relinquished.\" So, through what do the sravakas relinquish the [afflictions]? It may be said, \"[They do so] through being familiar with personal identitylessness, whose mode of apprehension is mutually exclusive with ignorance as the root of the afflictions.\" However, since bodhisattvas have additionally familiarized with phenomenal identitylessness, they would have to relinquish the afflictions even if they wish to keep them because they have accomplished this powerful [rem­edy] that is mutually exclusive [with the afflictions]. Furthermore, since the contaminations in the [mistaken] explanation of the knowledge of the path being contaminated {201} must be asserted as ignorance, craving, and so on, they would have to be asserted [as existing] in buddhas as well because these [contaminations] are not relinquished in all respects through the knowledge"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 197 of the path and there is no other remedy either. Also, if ignorance, craving, and so on are needed as causes for taking birth, how would sravaka and pra­tyekabuddha arhats [re]adopt craving through entering the mahayana? It may be said, \"[They do so] through the ground of the latent tendencies of igno­rance and uncontaminated karma.\" [However,] this is exactly the same fo r bodhisattvas. Therefore, the [afflictions] of bodhisattvas are the very roots of virtue that are compassion, aspiration prayers, bodhicitta, and so on. They are labeled as such [afflictions] because they are similar to afflictions in their func­tion. This discussion by the earlier scholar Jangchub Yeshe is an explanation of understanding the-essential point of the sfttras and the commentaries. Here the fo llowing is also to be said. If the causes fo r taking rebirth are fully qualified afflictions and karma, it would fo llow that noble bodhisattvas are born under the influence of karma. Also, if [the bodhisattvas] who have taken rebirth are harmed by the sufferings of the respective [type of] beings [as whom they are born], this is not reasonable-the Uttaratantra [says]: The root of the sufferings of death, sickness, And aging is removed by the noble ones. [Suffering] is born from the power of karma and afflictions, [But] they lack it, because they lack these.430 Furthermore, it is very much contradictory to conflate the causes for rebirth that are explained at the beginning of the Sagaramati[pariprcchasutra] with the [fully qualified] afflictions taught here and to assert that [the fo rmer] are not Uust] nominal afflictions. {202} 2b) Presenting the meaning as it is You may wonder, \"What is the meaning of Aryavimuktisena and master [Haribhadra] saying that bodhisattvas do not relinquish the afflictions, while sravakas and pratyekabuddhas relinquish them? What are these afflictions?\" The meaning of this is as fo llows. As fo r not relinquishing the afflictions in gen­eral and not relinquishing the afflictions that are the causes for taking rebirth in particular, this is not an explanation of not relinquishing the afflictions in terms of needing them as causes fo r taking rebirth. For if they were not fa c­tors to be relinquished, it would contradict their being afflictions. If they are [factors to be relinquished], they would [consequently] not be relinquished through the knowledge of the path and there is no remedy other than that either. Therefore, they would even exist once [bodhisattvas] have become bud­dhas. But if fully qualified afflictions were needed as the causes fo r their being reborn, this would contradict [the above] two sfttras. \"So what are [these afflic­tions] then?\" It is explained that [bodhisattvas] are not like sravakas (who are afraid of the result of the afflictions-[sa�p.saric] existence-and thus mentally"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 Groundless Paths cast them off), but do not relinquish the afflictions because of their motivation of striving to connect with [sa�psaric] existence for the welfare of others. In brief, what is merely labeled as not relinquishing the [afflictions] is [the fact that bodhisattvas] do not relinquish the [seeming sa�psaric] existence that resembles [the actual sa�psaric existence which is] the result of the [afflic­tions] . Otherwise, it would be contradictory that the latencies of craving for the desire realm are not relinquished through having relinquished all latencies of ignorance without exception. For if the cause comes to an end, its result comes to an end [too]. Also, the Vrtti says that since bodhisattvas, through mentoring prajfia and compassion, respectively, are not to be bound or liber­ated, this is the very point [here]. {203} The compassion of bodhisattvas Is to delight in [saiJI.saric] existence. Since it is thus said that, through compassion, bodhisattvas are not liberated from [sa�psaric] existence, it is this very compassion that is the cause for their being reborn in [ sa�psaric] existence. As the Ratnavali says: It is solely through compassion That they connect with [sa�psaric] existence until enlightenment.431 Furthermore, since bodhisattvas gain mastery over the afflictions through means and prajfia, [the afflictions] do not give rise to flaws and even become aids fo r practicing the path. Therefore, unlike the sravakas, who take them exclusively as antagonistic fa ctors, it is also [because of this that bodhisattvas] do not relinquish the afflictions. This explanation of the causes of taking rebirth that is obtained in this way is the intention of commenting on the siitras that combines the intentions of the siitras, noble Nagarjuna, noble Asailga, Aryavimuktisena, and master [Haribhadra] , which represents the final essential point of bodhisattvas not abiding in peace by virtue of compassion. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1 .2.1.2.3.

This is the path of rhinolike [pratyekabuddhas] . Here some explain the fo llowing: \"When [these pratyekabuddhas] have engaged in study and reflection fo r one hundred eons by fo cusing on the pitaka of the sravakas and know that they still have to take [one] rebirth, at the point of being about to die and transit after having trained on the path before they make the fo llowing threefold aspiration prayer, 'May I be born in a realm without buddhas and sravakas! There, may I progress on the path without depending on others, but through the prajfia that I attained by myselfl {208} After having attained enlightenment, may I engage in loving-kindness fo r those to be guided through physical [displays], but not through speech!' After their transition, they are born as men who are not of the siidra caste in a realm empty [of buddhas and sravakas] on [any one among] the three continents [i.e., other than Uttarakuru].440 From their homes, they go into homelessness and ordain themselves of their own accord, and then go to charnel grounds. Through reflecting upon where the bones [there] come from, they realize the progressive and reverse orders of dependent origination (from ignorance up through aging and death) and fa miliarize themselves with this actuality by relying on the actual fo urth dhyana. Through this, they manifest the fo ur fo l­lowing paths [after the path of accumulation] in a single lifetime.\" As for [the pratyekabuddhas on] the second path, they please the buddhas who come into being, rely on genuine beings, listen to the genuine dharma, and engage mentally [in it] in a proper manner. Based on this, they give rise to the first three [levels of the] path of preparation. Then, in order to clearly realize the dharma [on the remaining paths] later, they become learned in the six topics of erudition. [Those on] the third path, based on the same [causes] as above, manifest either one of the first two fruitions [of stream-enterer and once-returner. Then, in order to attain the fruitions of nonreturner and arhat later, they also become learned in said six topics].

[However,] those who follow the Abhidharmasamuccaya do not assert that rhinolike [pratyeka­buddhas] give rise to their remaining four paths on the single seat [of one session of meditation], though they give rise to them in said single lifetime. Those who follow the Abhidharmakosa [quote its lines VI.24ac]: The teacher and the rhinos, up through enlightenment, Rely on the last dhyana and accomplish all in one, Which is preceded by the factors conducive to liberation. Thus, they explain that, at the time of their last existence, they attain the pre­paratory stage of the Peak of Existence before the path of seeing and thus become free from attachment to Nothing Whatsoever and [all levels] below. Through relying on the last-the fourth-dhyana, they manifest their remain­ing four paths on a single seat. At that time, they relinquish the factors to be relinquished through seeing and just the nine [degrees of] the factors of the Peak of Existence to be relinquished through familiarization. According to this, they are [of the type of] those who have previously become free from attachment and become approachers to, and abiders in, [the fruition of] a nonretumer. Furthermore, the Bodhisattvabhumi explains: Pratyekabuddhas are to be understood exactly like sravakas.441 Therefore since the natures of their paths are alike, it is suitable to count all eight [levels of] approachers and abiders [of sravakas for pratyekabuddhas too].442 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.2.4.

The dharma cognition of suffering manifests the [corresponding] path of liber­ation. The subsequent readiness of suffering, through fo cusing on the two [preceding moments of] the dharma readiness of suffering and the dharma cognition of suffering, apprehends them as the causes for the dharmas of the noble ones.

Since said relinquishment represents cessation, cessation is manifested too. Since there is no [cessation] without having familiarized with the path, these [four activities] are simultaneous. As for the meaning of the second [phrase above], though [the path of seeing] is a single [moment] in this way, it is presented as [having] sixteen [moments] in terms of the progression of the arising of certainty subsequent to having cut through the various aspects of superimpo­sitions onto each one of the [sixteen aspects of the four] realities. In this way, though [the path of seeing] lacks any progression in terms of the manner of performing the activities of knowing, relinquishing, and so on with regard to the four realities, in terms of the manners of inducing certainty, it arises as having the progression of sixteen [moments]. Thus, the presentation of approachers to, and abiders in, the path of seeing is suitable too. The second system says that even the discriminating clear realization is a single moment. For once one has arrived at the culmination of familiarization through having familiarized oneself [fully] with [the fact that] all phenom­ena lack being entities, {214} through the arising of uncontaminated wisdom, which is the subject of the true reality of all four realities, there is nothing to be seen again that has been seen [already. This happens] in the manner of [the Pramdt;�avarttika saying]: Within what is identical in nature With a referent and directly perceived, What other unseen parts to be examined Through valid cognition could there be?456 As for the manner of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished, the afflic­tions (such as attachment and the views about a real personality) are motivated by the clinging to entities, whereas being liberated from them is by virtue of seeing that they do not exist in the way that one clings to them. Therefore, there is no progression in the [discriminating clear realization] either. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2.3.1.2.2.3.2. Teaching which one is the tenable one The latter system is not tenable. For in that case, by virtue of all aspects of the path of seeing to be realized being complete in a single moment, there is no cultivation of the path of seeing by way of any remaining aspects. So how could the presentation of approachers to, and abiders in, the path of seeing be feasible? If one, merely through seeing the true reality of the four realities, would not make any superimpositions [onto these realities] that represent their opposites, the discriminating clear realization would [indeed] be a single moment. However, by virtue of certain causes for mistakenness, during the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"208 Groundless Paths time of [such mistakenness] there exist other aspects that are said superim­positions which represent the opposites [of the sixteen aspects of the four realities]. Therefore, it is for the sake of eradicating these aspects [of superim­position] that there exists the familiarization by way of the other aspects [of the path of seeing] too. Consequently, also the presentation of approachers and abiders is tenable. Thus, though consciousness apprehends all aspects of the true reality of the four realities, it is through the power of its clear famil­iarity with certain elements and so on that it is able to eliminate said aspects of superimposition. {215} It is this very [ability] that eliminates the obscurations that represent the obstructions of these [respective elements]. Therefore, [said ability] represents the valid cognitions with regard to [the respectively corresponding ones of] these [elements], but not with regard to [any of] the other elements. This is just as seeing blue and [seeing its] momentariness are undifferentiated, but [seeing the former] is able to eliminate the superimposi­tion of [blue] not being blue, whereas it is not able to eliminate the clinging to permanence. One should also not say, \"If certainty is not induced even if [the true nature of the four realities] is seen, what difference is there between noble ones and ordinary beings?\" For it is by virtue of the extent to which the aspects [of the four realities] are clear [in their minds] that the [former] are more eminent due to their cognitions being lastingly free from the causes of mistakenness. This presentation of the [above] assertions and the analysis as to wether they are or are not tenable correspond to what appears in the Abhisamayalarrzkaralokd,457 which, accordingly, asserts the following. Since there are no parts in the true reality of the four realities, when it is seen, it is seen in its entirety, but this seeing does not necessarily induce certainty. Therefore, in order to eliminate superimpositions and give rise to certainty, one cultivates the path of seeing through sixteen moments. Consequently, its meditative equipoise arises in the manner of entailing the progression of the sixteen [moments of the] readinesses and cognitions. However, since these [moments] do not discord in their manner of realizing the object that is such­ness, they represent a single continuum and thus a single moment [in the above sense of completing an action]. The sixteenfold explanation of distinct manners of realization is presented with regard to the manners of inducing certainty [about said sixteen moments] during subsequent attainment. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1 .2.2.3.1 .2.2.3.3. [The manner of this] being explained in the scriptures This has two parts. As for what is explained in Madhyamaka, the Yukti��tikd says:"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Right upon dharma cognition, If there were a distinction in it, Then those unlearned people Translations: The General Topics 209 Who think that even very subtle entities Arise through something {216} Would not see the actuality of origination through conditions.458 The meaning of [these lines in] the root text and [ Candrakirti's] commentary is as follows. Through understanding that dependently originating phenomena are without arising and ceasing, it is realized that also the nature of suffering, its origin, and the path is to be without arising and ceasing. Since this nature is also the nature of cessation, the nature of the four realities is realized simul­taneously-it is not that they are realized progressively through the manner of different aspects of realization after the dharma cognition [of suffering]. Therefore, there is only a single clear realization. However, the presentation [of the path of seeing] as [having] fifteen or sixteen moments is given in order to benefit those who are fond of elaborations. [In this vein,] it is asserted that the dharma readinesses [are taught] by virtue of not being afraid of the nature of the four realities; the dharma cognitions, by virtue of being aware of [this nature] properly; and the subsequent readinesses and subsequent cognitions, by virtue of possessing the power of not being afraid and being aware in said sense at the time of subsequent cognition too. The ViniScayasa,grahar;�i says that [the presentation of the path of see­ing is twofold]-the detailed presentation with reference points so that the teachings remain and the presentation of ultimate personally experienced awareness without reference points. In terms of the first presentation, there are the fo ur dharma readinesses that accord with the factors that are the dharma cognitions, the fo ur subsequent readinesses that accord with the fac­tors that are the subsequent cognitions (together eight), and a single state of mind of calm abiding. Through these nine [states of mind, the path of seeing is fully completed].459 However since this contains the [eight] cognitions, it is [nothing but] a presentation of sixteen [moments]. In terms of the second presentation, [the text] explains that [the path of seeing] is complete through a single state of mind that is the [cognizing] subject of suchness.460 {217} The first presentation is an explanation with reference points from the per­spective of those to be guided in order for the teachings to remain, while the second one is the one of the definitive meaning without reference points-the manner in which [the path of seeing] arises in the mind streams of yogins.

The objects of aspiration The Abhisamayalarrzkariilokii466 explains [the objects] as being all three prajftaparamitas-scriptural, path, and fruitional. The Suddhamah\"'467 explains that since [bodhisattvas] aspire for writing and reading the object that is the scriptural [prajftaparamita] and fo r venerating it with flowers and so on, it is the object of aspiration. 2.2.2.2.1.2. 1 .2.2.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. The nature of aspiration As fo r the nature in general, the Prasphutapadii468 [says] that it is to ascer­tain the entities to be certain of, thus identifying it as being the same as what the Abhidharmasamuccaya explains as the mental fa ctor aspiration. The Suddhamati explains it as trusting confidence and desire fo r the object [that is the scriptural prajftaparamita]: Aspiration is confidence and striving, that is, it has the defining characteristics of trust and desiring. 469 As fo r the nature in particular, the Vrtti [says]: The aspiration in terms of one's own welfare is what accomplishes one's very own welfare and it also promotes the welfare of others in that it has the nature of [the latter] being its aim. [The aspiration in terms of] the welfare of oneself and others is what accomplishes both welfares. [The aspiration in terms of] the welfare of others is fo r the welfare of others alone.470 Thus, it says that, though [all three types of aspiration] do not lack the motivation [of aspiring fo r] the welfare of others, their difference lies in the application [of this motivation.

You may wonder, \"In what manner do they rejoice?\" On the level of the seeming, through being skilled in means, they do so by observing [these vir­tues] as being illusionlike. Ultimately, through prajfta, they do so by realizing that they are not observable as anything whatsoever.477 2.2.2.2.1.2. 1 .2.2.3.2.2.1.3.

Since the ninefold path of familiar­ization of the mahayana as the remedy for the nine factors to be relinquished through familiarization (the antagonistic factors in dependence on the nine levels [of sa�psara]) is the cause that purifies all stains without exception, the purity of buddhas is utter [purity]. For if this cause is what purifies all stains, its result must be being liberated from all stains without exception. The lesser, medium, [and great] paths of familiarization of sravakas and pratyekabud­dhas (the remedies for their respective factors to be relinquished) are the causes that purify something other than all aspects of the stains, that is, [only] certain parts of them (merely the afflictive obscurations or merely these and the conceptions about the apprehended, respectively). Therefore, the puri­ties of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are limited. For if said causes are the remedies for limited stains, the results attained through them represent being liberated only from certain parts of the stains. 482 In this context, [the path of familiarization] is ninefold due to the supports of both the factors to be relinquished and their remedies. The supports of the factors to be relinquished are the nine levels of the three realms. The supports of their remedies are two distinct [sets]. In the abhidharma, the following nine are asserted as the supports of the uncontaminated [path of familiariza­tion]. Since the Peak of Existence is not very lucid and the desire realm is not very much at peace, the uncontaminated [path of familiarization] does not rely on these two, but on the six grounds of dhyana and the first three form­less [absorptions]. Others say that this [presentation] is [only] in terms of the sravakas, who are not skilled in means. But since bodhisattvas are skilled in means, {227} their uncontaminated [path of familiarization] relies also on the desire realm and the Peak of Existence.

The mahayana knowledge of entities that is taught through the entailment [The mahayana knowledge of entities] consists of (a) seeing, through the prajfia of realizing the lack of nature of [sa�psaric] existence, the shortcom­ings of abiding in it exclusively, (b) through the compassion that focuses on"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"220 Groundless Paths all sentient beings without exception, promoting the welfare of others, and (c) realizing [all] phenomena as being equality. Therefore, this is the knowledge of entities that is close to the perfect mother. 2.2.2.2.1.2. 1.3.1.2. The hinayana knowledge of entities (the reverse) [The hinayana knowledge of entities] is devoid of the compassion and loving­kindness of promoting the welfare of others as well as the prajfia of realizing the lack of nature, and it lacks the knowledge of the three times being equal­ity. Therefore, it is the knowledge of entities that is distant from the perfect mother.484 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.2. The reasons for presenting closeness and distance It may be said, \"It follows that it is not tenable to present being close to, and distant from, the [fruitional] mother by virtue of respectively having or not having the realization of the three times as being equality in said way. For sravakas and pratyekabuddhas also have the realization of the basis-the actu­ality of dependent origination-and, in the texts of the mahayana, dependent origination is taught to have the nature of emptiness. [Thus,] if dependent origination is realized, it is established that the freedom from reference points or equality is realized.\" {229} Though it is true that the nature of dependent origination (the object) is emptiness, there is a difference as to whether the mind realizes or does not realize it to be this way. Since sravakas and pratyekabuddhas [lack] spiritual friends and companions who teach them that all phenomena lack a nature (the outer condition) and [also] lack skill in means (the inner condition), they cling to dependently originating phenomena (such as form) as being really existent. Therefore, they lack the realization of phenomena as being equal­ity. Bodhisattvas possess the unmistaken pith instructions that truly delight mahayana spiritual friends (the outer condition) and also possess the skill in means of their study, reflection, and meditation being based on both seeming and ultimate reality (the inner condition). Therefore, they possess the prajfia of realizing [all] phenomena as being equality.485 In this context, the explanation of whether sravakas and pratyekabuddhas realize or do not realize phenomenal identitylessness has two parts: 1) The manner in which this is discussed in the s'iitras 2) How it is commented on in the treatises 1) [The manner in which this is discussed in the s'iitras] has two parts. The manner of [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] not realizing phenomenal identit­ylessness is discussed in many [s'iitras], such as the [Mahapari]nirvii7;�a[sutra], the Srimiila[devisutra], and the sa,dhinirmocana[sutra]. Since this is very well known, I do not write out these [scriptural] sources."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 221 As for [certain other sfitras] saying that [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] realize phenomena as being without nature, the Da5abhumika[sutra] states: 0 children of the victors, it is as follows. For example, it is merely through his being born that a prince born in the royal caste who is endowed with the [proper] signs {230} outshines the entire assem­bly of ministers under the authority of the king, but not because of [being able to perform] any analysis through the power of his mind [as a child]. [However,] when he has grown up, it is through what he produces by the power of his mind that he goes very much beyond all activities of the ministers. 0 children of the victors, like­wi�e, immediately upon having generated bodhicitta, bodhisattvas outshine all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas through the greatness of their superior intention, but not because of any analysis through the power of their minds. Bodhisattvas who dwell on this seventh bodhisattvabhftmi, through abiding in the greatness of know­ing its object, go very much beyond all activities of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Also the mother [sfitra in eight thousand lines] says that those who wish to train in the bhftmis of the sravakas should train in prajftaparamita and so on.486 The first [source] says that until [bodhisattvas] attain the seventh bhftmi, they are not able to outshine sravakas and pratyekabuddhas through their realization. Therefore, sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the realization of the lack of nature. Otherwise, why would the [bodhisattvas] not outshine them? ·The second [source] also teaches that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the realization of phenomena lacking a nature. For it says that it is the mother itself who is the cause of the enlightenments of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and that those who cling to [anything], be it permanence, impermanence, an existing identity, or identitylessness, do not engage in the mother. This is also not invalidated by the mother [sfitras] saying that the prajfta of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas {231} does not even amount to a fraction of having cultivated the prajfta of bodhisattvas for a day and so on.487 For [the sfitras] teach the difference in generating [their respective] mindsets as the reason for this, but they do not teach a difference in their prajftas. Also the sfitras taught to the sravakas [say]: Form is like a ball of foam. Feelings resemble bubbles. Discrimination is like a mirage. Formations are equal to a banana tree."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"222 Groundless Paths Consciousness is like an illusion. Thus spoke the friend of the sun.488 This was taught in order that the sravakas relinquish the afflictive obscurations. 2) [How this is commented on in the treatises] has two parts-those who fol­low (a) the first and (b) the second sfttras, respectively. 2a) The MahayanasutralartJkara says: Those people who reject the greatly valuable generation of the mindset Progress toward peace, but reject the happinesses Of intending the welfare of others, achieving the means for that, And seeing the actuality of the great intention and supreme true reality.489 Thus, it says that those who reject the generation of the mahayana mindset lack the happiness of seeing supreme true reality, that is, phenomenal identit­ylessness. Also, in the explicit words of the other dharmas of Maitreya, except for [sometimes stating] a mere difference with regard to the pratyekabuddhas, there is no explanation of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas realizing phenom­enal identitylessness. Following this, in the texts of Asailga, his brother, Sthiramati, and others, there appears no explanation of sravakas and pratye­kabuddhas realizing phenomenal identitylessness either. Even among Madhyamaka masters, {232} the great master Bhavaviveka, master Sant�ita and his disciples, as well as Aryavimuktisena and Hari­bhadra with their followers (all of whom follow prajfiaparamita) say that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize phenomenal identitylessness. This position [is held by] very many Indian and Tibetan scholars. In this Ala1pkara of the mother, in the context of the paths of preparation of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, it appears as if it speaks about [these paths] entailing the aspect of phenomenal identitylessness, but given the general scope [of this text], it is not in order [for this to actually be the case]. 2b) This has three parts: a) Presenting the scriptures of master [Nagarjuna] b) Explaining the meaning of these scriptures c) Rebutting disputes about this 2ba) The Yukt4a�pka says: If one accepts [real] entities, One grasps at awful bad views"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"That arise from desire and hatred. From that, disputes arise. This is the cause of all views. Translations: The General Topics 223 Without it, the afflictions do not arise. Therefore, if this is thoroughly understood, Views and afflictions disappear. \"Through what is this understood?\" Through seeing dependent origination. The supreme among the knowers of true reality Said that what arises in dependence does not arise.490 The Ratnavali says: For as long as the clinging to the skandhas exists, For that long there is [the clinging to] them as \"me.\" If there is the clinging to \"me,\" [there is] also karma And, from that, rebirth too. With three paths491 without beginning, middle, or end Serving as its mutual causes, This round of satpsara spins Like the round of a circling firebrand. Since this [round] is neither obtained as oneself, {233} Nor others, nor both, nor in the three times, The clinging to \"me\" is exhausted, And thus karma and birth too.492 2bb) As for explaining the meaning of these scriptures, the former one says that if there is the clinging to [real] entities, attachment and so on operate and, without it, they are put to an end. The latter one speaks about the fol­lowing entailment. If there is the clinging to entities, there are the clinging to \"me\" and the views about a real personality. From these afflictions [comes] the karma motivated by them and, by virtue of these two, one is born in [satpsaric] existence. Through seeing that these are not established as any nature of themselves, others, or the three times, the clinging to \"me\" and so on are put to an end. Therefore, [these texts] teach that sravakas and prat­yekabuddhas possess the realization of phenomenal identitylessness because he asserts [in his Bodhicittavivarar;ta] that sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 Groundless Paths have relinquished all views about a real personality, attachment, hatred, and so on without expection and are not reborn under the influence of karma and afflictions. One is also not able to explain what is said in the Ratnavali as being [meant] in terms of bodhisattvas. [For it] states the same as the above [quote from the Yukti$�tika] and, at the end of [its verse which] teaches that, without grasping, one passes into nirvat)a, [it says]: Thus, through seeing in this way, Bodhisattvas firmly desire enlightenment.493 Following these [scriptures], glorious Candrakirti, Jayananda, master Santideva, Prajiiakaramati, Kalyanadeva, and Vunalamitra hold that sravakas and pratyek­abuddhas possess the realization of [all] phenomena being without nature. 2bc) As for rebutting disputes about this, {234} you may wonder, \"So how do you account here for the [first] sutras and Maitreya stating that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize phenomenal identitylessness?\" Well, how do you account for other scriptures speaking about the existence of an inexpress­ible person: There is the person who carries the load, Inexpressible as either permanent or impermanent. You may say, \"This is [a statement] that entails an intention, being said in order to guide those who cling to views about a self.\" Well, [likewise,] it is for the sake of guiding those who propound referents and so on and who are afraid of the teachings on the lack of nature that it is taught on a temporary basis that they will be liberated through [familiarizing with] personal identitylessness [in the form of the sixteen aspects of the four realities], such as impermanence. Thus, the basis of the intention of presenting the path of impermanence and so on to sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and thus teaching that they do not realize phenomenal identitylessness is that they lack the familiarization with phenomenal identitylessness in a complete manner. The purpose [of this teaching] has already been described. As for the invalidation of its explicit statement, if the [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] had no other path than the sixteen [aspects] of impermanence and so on, which entail the clinging to phenomena [as being real] , it would not be suitable to accept their having relinquished the afflictions at the root and being fully qualified noble ones. For both the path and the afflictions are equal in focusing on the very same phenomena of the skandhas as their focal objects and thus in wrongly engag­ing in the true nature of these [phenomena]. Since the mind would thus stray from the [ultimate] nature of the four realities, it would not see these realities exactly as they are. Furthermore, the afflictions (such as attachment) entail"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 225 the cause that consists of the clinging to the skandhas as being really existent. {235} So if the [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] cling to the skandhas as being really existent in all [aspects], since this cause has not come to an end, how could all its results without exception be put to an end? You may say, \"If sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possessed the realiza­tion of phenomenal identitylessness, there would be no difference from the mahayana.\" The Ratnavali answers: In the sravakayana, The aspiration prayers of bodhisattvas, Their conducts, and their dedications are not explained. Therefore, how could they be bodhisattvas?494 [The text furthermore] explains that they also lack the familiarization with phenomenal identitylessness in a complete manner. If one understands these differences, any concerns about whether sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are or are not fully qualified noble ones will stop. Furthermore, in the meditative equipoises of these [sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas], there are no manifest conceptions of [the skandhas] being real as being impermanent and so on because [these meditative equipoises] repre­sent yogic perceptions and therefore are free from terms and conceptions. The Pramd1Jasamuccaya declares: On the basis of [meditating on] the teachings of the guru of yogins, Sheer reality unmixed [with thoughts] is seen. Thus, it says that yogic perception takes the phenomena of the four reali­ties as its objects without mixing them with names [and thoughts]. Also, the Abhidharmasamuccaya495 states that when supramundane cognition engages the aspects of,the realities, it sees the actuality of impermanence, but not [the term] \"impermanence.\" As it is for impermanence, so it is for the remaining aspects too.496 {236} 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.3.

The yogas ofbodhisattvas, which are taught explicitly In general, [here] \"the path of training\" is said to refer to the mere yoga of training in [or connecting with] its repective objects without focusing on them [as such objects], but not to [the path of preparation499 as] one of the five paths. Therefore since this training in the knowledge of entities represents the cultivation of the remedies for clinging to any characteristics of view, medita­tion, conduct, fruition, subject, and object, one must cultivate it for as long these characteristics arise. Consequently, it is presented as [ranging] from the path of accumulation {239} up through the tenth bhftmi. This training in the knowledge of entities is tenfold-(!) the training in form and so on ([the sfttras say], \"If bodhisattva mahasattvas, while being engaged in the mother, do not engage in form and so on, they engage in the mother\"),500 (2) the training in impermanence and so on (\"If they do not engage in 'form being permanent' or 'impermanent: they engage in the mother\"), (3) the training in being complete or incomplete (\"If bodhisattva mahasattvas, while being engaged in the mother, do not engage in 'form being incomplete: . . . \"), ( 4) the training in detachment (\"If bodhisattva mahasattvas, while being engaged in the mother, do not engage in 'form being with attachment' or 'with­out attachment: ... \"), (5) the training in changelessness (\"No matter whether this profound mother is taught or not taught, it does not diminish.

As for the meaning of \"form and so on being complete or incomplete\" in the context [of training (3)], the Abhisamayalarrzkariilokii says: Imaginary form is incomplete because it is empty of characteris­tics. The form of the nature of phenomena is complete because it is replete with the collection of qualities. 501 As for the meaning of this, [some Tibetans] explain the following. If one focuses on them, [that is, the perfect and imaginary natures, resepectively,]502 said qualities arise or do not arise. Therefore, [these two types of form] are respectively complete or incomplete as the foundation of qualities. However, this is not the intention [of the Alokii] because it speaks of being empty of characteristics as the reason for [imaginary form] being incomplete. So what is [the meaning then]? Since imaginary form is merely what is conceptually superimposed as form, it is not established through any characteristics or nature. Therefore, ultimately, it does not exist. The form of the nature of phe­nomena is the nature of form-the emptiness of conceptual imaginations. {241} Since it abides as being inseparable from the naturally pure qualities, it is called \"complete\" or \"abiding ultimately.''503 As for [the three things] that are hard to do [in training (7)], in due order, it is hard to take the knowledge of all aspects as one's aim, it is hard to gener­ate the knowledge of the path in one's mind stream, and it is hard to teach the knowledge of entities to others. At the time of this training, [bodhisattvas]"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"230 Groundless Paths take said three �ings that are hard to do as their objects and understand these three as lacking anything to be attained, what causes attainment, and so on, just like space, but it is not that the training is constituted by these three things that are hard to do. In the context of the seven kinds of appearances [in training (10)] that make [bodhisattvas] understand [all phenomena as dreams and so on], there are four [distinct features] for each one. Where [or for what] do they appear? [They appear] for the subsequent attainment of bodhisattvas. What appears? It is inner and outer entities. How [do they appear? They appear] like dreams. The reason for this is that consciousness, by virtue of the sleep of latent ten­dencies, appears as being transformed into such and such. By applying these four features to the following [six of] the seven [examples] too, [phenomena are like] illusions because they arise from the coming together of ignorance's mantra and elixir; mirages, because they appear contradictory by virtue of appearing as real, but not existing; echoes, because they appear in dependence on conditions; and optical illusions, because they appear in the manner of not going beyond the way of being of knowable objects, that is, the ways in which these are propelled by inner latent tendencies (which resemble the factors that bring about a reflection). Here the sfttras [say] \"reflection\" and the Abhisamayalarrzkaraloka says \"optical illusion.\" The smaller Brhattika504 [explains] this as the appearance of fa lling strands of hair for those who have blurred vision and some explain it as a swiftly circling firebrand and so on. {242} [Furthermore, phenomena are like] cities of gandharvas because they appear on their own without any support to dwell on. [They are like] magical creations because they appear as activities of body and speech, which lack any causes in true reality. Through these seven [examples], bodhisattvas are made to understand all phenomena as being equal to said [examples]. Therefore, they are called \"the seven appearances that make one understand.\" During subsequent attainment, [bodhisattvas] should understand all phenomena to be illusionlike and, if they have any clinging to even this very being illusion­like, they must stop [such clinging] by way of the fourfold lack of conceit. [In his Abhisamayalarrzkaravrittipi7;�4ilrtha,] Prajfiakaramati holds that these ten trainings increase more and more through casting off their respective clingings.505 However since they, ultimately, are just divisions by way of their respective objects, their nature is one in that they [all] represent nonclinging. 2.2.2.2.1.2.1 .3.4.1.2.

Here the smaller Brhattfka508 explains that since [bodhisattvas real­ize that] form is not established ultimately, [the first, second, and fourth lack of conceit above mean] that they are not conceited [by. respectively think­ing], \"This is form,\" \"Through this form, that kind of entity is established,\" \"I should benefit or harm form in this way.\" {243} The larger [Brhatpka]509 explains the third one as not being conceited about [form and so on represent­ing] entities [as in the relationship between] a master and servants. Master [Haribhadra's Aloka]510 says that the first one is the clinging to a nature of form and so on; the second one, the clinging to conventional characteris­tics511 (with regard to form]; the third one, the clinging to the classificational elaborations [of form and so on]; and the fourth one, the clinging to what is realized �ough [what is conducive to] penetration and so on. 512 2.2.2.2.1.2.1.3.5.

The reason fo r not explaining the path of familiarization The Vrtti says: You may wonder, \"Due to which point is it that, unlike with the knowledge of the path, there is no separate path of familiarization fo r the knowledge of entities?\" This is because [the sfitras] say that bodhisattvas view the excellences of �ravakas and pratyekabud­dhas through understanding and seeing them and then go beyond them. 513 Therefore, the other one [ (the path of familiarization of bodhisattvas)] is taken to be primary here.514 The realizations as they are realized by �ravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and so on are only something that is to be known by bodhisattvas, but not something with which they have to fa miliarize and acquaint themselves again and again. Therefore, a path of familiarization of how bodhisattvas have to fa miliarize with the knowledge of entities of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas is not taught. You may wonder, \"But why not teach the very paths of fa miliarization of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas, on which [bodhisattvas] familiarize with the actualities that these �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas themselves have seen [on their respective paths of seeing]?\" Though they are not taught, they are easy to understand. For in the context of bodhisattvas teaching the paths of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas to others, it is sufficient fo r them to teach, \"The path of fa miliarization is to fa miliarize with the very actuality as you have seen it,\" but [bodhisattvas] themselves do not familiarize with this [actuality].515 {245} 2.2.2.2.1.2. 1 .3.6.

The same goes fo r the two other realms. It is neither what bestows the paramita of generosity nor what takes away miserliness ... It is neither what bestows the knowledge of all aspects nor what takes it away. The concluding summary of the knowledge of all aspects is as fo llows: Again, Subhiiti, this mother is neither what bestows the buddhad­harmas nor what takes them away. The same applies fo r the dharmas of ordinary beings, the dharmas of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and conditioned and unconditioned dharmas. As the justification fo r this [the sfttras continue by] saying that, no matter whether tathagatas arise or do not arise, the nature of phenomena abides Uust as it is]. {246} After the tathagatas have fully realized this, they teach it to oth­ers and so on. [Thus,]517 everything that is stated in this third chapter-the chapter of the knowledge of entities-is not taught in order to respectively adopt and reject all the phenomena of skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas (the entities) by way of clinging to dualistic phenomena, such as attaining or not attaining, bestowing or taking them away. Rather, it is stated fo r the sake of cutting through the reference points of clinging through stopping the conceptions that cling to any extreme whatsoever. Whatever is taught in the second chapter-the chapter of the knowledge of the path-is not taught in order to adopt nirvat)a and reject satpsara through regarding the phenomena that make up satpsaric existence as the set of the antagonistic fa ctors that are to be relinquished and the phenomena that make up what is purified (nirvaJ}.a) as the set of the remedies that are to be adopted. Rather, it is taught for the sake of cutting through the clinging to what is to be adopted and to be rejected through realizing [satpsaric] existence and peace as being equality.

Rather, the knowledge of all aspects is the utter peace of all reference points of clinging to satp.sara as what is to be relinquished and nirvat}.a as what is to be adopted {247} being taught to be free from superimpositions and denial, once the primordially abiding true nature of all phenomena is fully realized [as it is]. Thus, it is taught fo r the sake of cutting through the clinging to what is to be attained and what causes attainment. This represents the concluding sum­mary by way of stating how the three knowledges are taught and what the purposes of teaching them are. As for the meaning of the commentaries [explaining] here that the three knowledges are taught completely, this does not mean that all points of the three knowledges are taught here in a complete manner, but [this statement] teaches that the explanation of the three knowledges has been completed. As fo r [the AA] providing a concluding summary for the three knowledges, but not mentioning the other five clear realizations, this is because the three knowledges are the primary [clear realizations] by virtue of their including all points of the eight clear realizations and because, through having explained them in detail, the others have been explained implicitly too. What entails clinging, even if it is a remedy, is a factor to be relinquished. In the actual realization of nonclinging there is nothing to be adopted or to be rejected. The difference between clinging and nonclinging being in this way Is what is explained here as what is to be adopted and to be relinquished by the children of the victors. This completes the explanation of the general topics of the chapter (the third one) on the knowledge of all entities. {248} 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.

For these two, the conventional terms \"referent aspects\" and \"cognitive aspects\" are also used."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.

The manner in which they are summarized in the treatise Venerable [Maitreya] {250} delineates the outline of these sii.tra [passages] through [verse VI.2], \"Beginning with the aspect of nonexistence ... \" [Thus, he says that,] from this [passage] to that [passage in the sii.tras], respectively, the aspects of the knowledge of entities, the knowledge of the path, and the knowledge of all aspects are taught. For the first two knowledges [in this order], [the aspects of] all four realities [are described] and for the last one, the aspects of the reality of the path are said to be trifling. The reason for this reality of the path being explained to be trifling and its aspects being the referent aspects and the cognitive aspects of the knowledge of all aspects will be explained in the section [on the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects below]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.4. The manner in which to familiarize [with them] Earlier [masters] explain that the referent aspects are what one should famil­iarize with because, through the 173 cognitive aspects, one should familiarize with the 173 referents byway of cutting through superimpositions [onto them]. However, the text's statement that one, through the training, familiarizes with the aspects appears to be primarily a familiarization with the cognitive aspects because the meaning of familiarizing with the aspects through the training is as follows. The paths that entail the focal objects and [cognitive] aspects which consist of the distinct instances of the wisdoms of the three knowledges (the subjects) realizing the particular phenomena of the four realities (the objects) in said manner are generated as the union of means and prajfia through two [among the twenty trainings within the complete training in all aspects]-the training in nonabiding [in form and so on] and the training in nontraining. As for [those paths that exist] solely on the buddhabhiimi versus those that exist in the mind streams of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, to generate certain paths that are of concordant type with said [paths] is labeled as familiarizing with, and generating, these [paths], just as in the example of bodhisattvas"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 237 being said to generate the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Therefore, { 251} in this chapter [of the complete training in all aspects], it is held that, no matter whether these aspects are taught [by way of] the different supports of the mahayana, the hinayana, buddhas, or bodhisattvas, or by way of subject or object, they point out the focal objects and [cognitive] aspects of the particu­lar wisdoms of realizing the triad of bases, paths, and aspects to be without arising that are to be generated in the mind streams of bodhisattvas. It is in this way that [the text] speaks about such and such focal objects and aspects of the distinct instances of the wisdoms of the three knowledges. [Thus, the text] speaks of the aspects as the objects with the intention that, once the focal objects and aspects that are to be generated are understood, they are generated in the mind stream through the training as [described] above. In this way, just as in the cases of familiarizing with identitylessness and compassion, from among the two [manners] of familiarizing with an object and familiarizing with [its] subject (the mind in its character of [bearing] said [object]), here [the manner of familiarization] is to be identified primarily as the latter one. 519 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.

(5) Conventionally, it is the cause for the production of name and form, but, in true reality, there is no basis for their production.

The fo ur [aspects of the reality] of cessation are as fo llows. (9} It is something to be manifested through the body of prajfia, but lacks going anywhere [in the sense] of being something to be attained through having gone from one mind stream to another.

The [actual] subdivisions of the path These are threefold. The remedy for the afflictive obscurations is one­the uncontaminated path of the hinayana. The remedies for the cognitive obscurations are two-the contaminated path of familiarization and the uncon­taminated path of seeing. [Within] this [scope of the aspects of the knowledge of entities,] the remedies fo r the cognitive obscurations consist of the pratyeka­buddhas' remedies fo r the conceptions about the apprehended. {253} 2.2.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.1.2. 1.2.1.2. A critical analysis This has fo ur parts. 1) The reasons fo r presenting the first fo ur [aspects of the reality of the path as the remedies fo r] the afflictive obscurations and the remaining eleven as the remedies for the cognitive obscurations are as fo llows. The first fo ur appear as bearing the aspect of the lack of a personal self, and the clinging to a personal self is the cause of the afflictive obscurations. These fo ur repre­sent [the fo ur aspects of the reality of the path in the abhidharma] (such as path and appropriateness) and the sixteen [aspects] such as impermanence are the subdivisions of the remedies fo r the afflictive obscurations. Therefore, the first fo ur [aspects of the reality of the path] are the remedies for the afflic­tive obscurations. As fo r the reasoning of the remaining ones [being the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 239 remedies for the cognitive obscurations], they must be taught as remedies for the obscurations, but since [the four remedies for] the afflictive obscurations have already been taught, [the remaining eleven] are not suitable [as remedies for the afflictive obscurations]. 2) As for presenting the first five among the remedies for the cognitive obscu­rations as being contaminated and the last six as being uncontaminated, they are presented as such because the first five point out [the phase of] subsequent attainment, during which objects appear while not existing. The latter six point out [the phase of] meditative equipoise, which is without appearances. 3) As for presenting [these two sets] as the contaminated path of familiar­ization and the uncontaminated path of seeing, respectively, [this is done] because the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing [arises] in an uninter­rupted manner, while the path of familiarization, by virtue of being longer in time, arises by way of [meditative equipoise] alternating with manifest [phases of] subsequent attainments. 4) As for the remedies for the afflictive obscurations not being subdivided [in the above manner] while the remedies for the cognitive obscurations are subdivided, this is due to these two [obscurations] respectively being easier or more difficult to relinquish. 520 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1 .2.2. The subdivisions of the aspects as what is supported This has three parts: 1) [The subdivision into] four 2) [The subdivision into] five 3) The subdivision into six 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1 .2.2.1. [The subdivision into] fo ur Among the three paths that there are [here as explained above], the first path exhibits uncontaminated aspects. (13) Through realizing that there is no per­son who is an agent, it functions as the remedy for clinging to such a [person]. {254} (14) Through realizing that there is no person who is a cognizer, it func­tions as the remedy for clinging to such a [person]. (15) Conventionally, there is a transition by way of leaving inferior levels behind and taking hold of more eminent stages [on the path], but, in true reality, there is no transition. (16) Conventionally, one passes into nirvat}.a through subduing the afflictions, but, in true reality, there is no subduing. In due order, these four correspond to the four [aspects of the reality of the path in the abhidharma] (such as path). 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1 .2.2.2. [The subdivision into] five The five aspects that exist on the second path (the contaminated path [of familiarization]) are as follows. (17) Just as in a dream, outer apprehended"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"240 Groundless Paths [objects] appear as objects, but lack any real nature. (18) Just like a reverbera­tion or an echo, they do not arise from a real cause. (19) Just like an optical illusion ([such as] a reflection or the appearance of two moons), their mere aspects are unimpeded. (20) Just as with the water in a mirage, [in these objects all] reference points are at peace primordially. (21) Just like the horses and elephants in an illusion, they are naturally pure. As for the manner in which these [five] function as remedies, through familiarizing with each one of them (such as the realization that apprehended [objects] are dreamlike), one is able to relinquish all clinging to their being realy existent. 2.2.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1 .2.2.3. The subdivision into six The six aspects that exist on the third path (the uncontaminated path [of see­ing]) are as follows. (22) Outer apprehended [objects] do not exist as afflicted entities to be rejected. (23) They do not exist as purified entities to be adopted. (24) Their untainted nature is luminosity. (25) They lack the elaborations of any divisions such as forms or sounds. (26) There is nothing to be conceited about, that is, being conceited about the realization of realizing that said [objects] are empty of a nature.521 {255} (27) The emptiness of their being empty of a nature is immovable, which is the aspect of realizing that it abides for as long as [saiJlsaric] existence lasts. These represent the remedies for six conceptions that are cognitive obscura­tions. You may wonder what these six are. They are the cognitive obscurations of conceiving of outer apprehended [objects] as afflicted phenomena to be rejected, and, in the same way, [conceiving of] them as purified phenomena to be adopted, [conceiving of] their nature as being stained in that it is tainted by the latent tendencies of the afflictions, [conceiving of] their having elabora­tions of subdivisions from form up through tangible objects, [conceiving of] one's own realization, due to having realized that they are empty of a nature, as being the realization that previously existing apprehended [objects] do not exist later, and conceiving of their nature of being empty of a nature as [involving] deterioration since one apprehends it as being empty for a while, but being reversed later and thus not being empty. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. [The aspects ofj the knowledge of the path This has four parts: 1) [The reality ofj the origin [of suffering] taught by way of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies 2) The reality of the path [taught by way of] its concordance with the thesis 3) The reality of suffering [taught by way of] its general and specific characteristics 4) The reality of cessation taught by way of emptiness"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 241 2.2.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. [The reality of] the origin [of suffering] explained by way of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies ( 1) The aspect of the knowledge of the path that consists of turning one's back on objects and being free from desire is the remedy for the desirous striving to look at objects and so on. (2) The aspect of not dwelling on objects through clinging is the remedy for desire, that is, the clinging that is preceded by desire toward objects. { 256} As for these two [aspects], since striving is the cause and desire is its result, if one is free from the one, one is also free from the other. It is merely for this reason that [striving and desire and said two aspects] are matched as factors to be relinquished and their remedies. (3) The aspect of characteristics and flaws being at utter peace is the remedy for becoming, that is, delighting in future divine and human physical supports. These three fac­tors to be relinquished represent the aspect that is the nature of the origin [of suffering, that is, its] being a cause.522 {4)-{6) The aspects of lacking the triad of desire and so on are the remedies for the triad of desire and so on. These three factors to be relinquished represent the aspect of the origin [of suffer­ing] that is origin. (7) The aspect of the lack of afflictions by virtue of being free from the cause of the affiictions (improper mental engagement) is the remedy for imagining them as being purity, happiness, and so on. This fac­tor to be relinquished represents the aspect of the origin [of suffering] that is arising. (8) The aspect of realizing the lack of a sentient being or a self is the remedy for the views about a real personality, that is, the clinging to being a sentient being. This factor to be relinquished represents the aspect that is the nature of the origin [of suffering, that is, its being] a condition. Thus, [the prajfiaparamita siitras and the AA] do not teach the actual [four] aspects of the origin [of suffering], but discuss their remedies because this teaches that the origin [of suffering] is what is to be relinquished. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. The aspects of the reality of the path [taught by way of its concordance with the thesis] (9) [The aspect of] being immeasurable teaches the nature of [the aspect of the reality of the path that is] the path-the mahayana that provides the opportunity for all sentient beings [to progress to buddhahood]. (10) [The aspect of] being disconnected from the two extremes teaches the reason for how this [path] provides said opportunity for all sentient beings {257} because it promotes the welfare of others through being free from clinging to the two extremes of [satp.saric] existence and peace. For if one clings to either [satp.saric] existence or peace, the promoting of immeasurable welfare does not occur. (11) [The aspect of] not being different teaches the nature of [the aspect of the reality of the path] that is the appropriateness of real­izing that all phenomena without exception are not different in their being"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"242 Groundless Paths the dharmadhatu. (12) [The aspect of] no clinging to superiority teaches the reason for how said appropriateness of the mahayana is the realization of everything without exception [being the dharmadhatu] because it is not content with merely the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, but accom­plishes all qualities of the mahayana. For if one takes the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas to be superior, this [only] represents a partial appro­priateness. (13) [The aspect of] nonconceptuality teaches the nature of [the aspect of the reality of the path] that is the accomplishment which makes one realize the object [-the nature of phenomena-] without conceiving it as the two [kinds of] identity. (14) [The aspect of] being unassessable teaches the reason for how this mahayana accomplishment does not conceive [the nature of phenomena as the two kinds of identity]. For preceded by being free from the clinging to regressing from what was already attained as being inferior and [the clinging to] attaining what was not attained as being excellent, the nature of phenomena is not clung to as an object that can be known. (15) The aspect of lacking attachment teaches the nature of [the aspect of the reality of the path that is its being] conducive to deliverance in that it, just like space, is free from attachment to any phenomena. That [the sfttras] do not give a justifica­tion for this is by virtue of the thinking of those to be guided who were close [at the time]. In this way, the sfttras discuss the reality of the path as being distinguished by way of [the above] pairs of theses and reasons {258} because the path is what is to be relied upon in the mind stream. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.3. The aspects of the reality of suffering [taught by way of its general and specific characteristics] (16) Since it abides as the nature of arising and ceasing, [suffering] is imper­manent. ( 17) Since it is pervaded by the suffering of [all-pervasive] formation, it is suffering. (18) Since it is not connected with a self that functions as its support, it is empty. (19) Since [suffering] itself is not a self [either], it is iden­tityless. (20) The fifth [item] in this enumeration refers to the nature of the aspect of its not having any characteristics or nature because, in true reality, all phenomena are not established. Thus, [here the aspects of the reality of suffering] are five. The fo rmer four represent its specific natures, while the last one is the nature of all fo ur and pervades all. Therefore, they are the spe­cific and general characteristics, respectively, [of suffering]. That [the [sfttras] teach the reality of suffering through its specific and general characteristics is because suffering represents what is to be known. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2.4. The aspects of the reality of cessation [taught by way of emptiness] They are taught as sixteen, from the aspect of the emptiness of the internal up through the aspect of the emptiness of the nature of nonentities. You may"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 243 wonder how the aspects of cessation are taught through these [ emptinesses]. This has five parts-cessation of (a) entities, (b) imputations, (c) agents, (d) mistakenness about objects, and (e) a nature. a) (21)-(23) The three aspects of the emptinesses of the internal, the exter­nal, and both teach the aspect of the nature of the reality of cessation that is the very nature of cessation. For these [three aspects] respectively consist of the cessation of the contaminated entities of the internal (such as eyes), the exter­nal (such as fo rm), and what is both internal and external (the sense organs). b) {259} (24)-(31) The eight from the aspect of the emptiness of emptiness up through the aspect of the emptiness of what is not rejected teach the aspect of the nature of the reality of cessation that is the nature of its aspect of peace because the eight [kinds of] clinging that have the nature of superimpositions onto the fo llowing eight are at peace. [In due order, these eight refer to] the remedy of regarding [emptiness] as emptiness; the world that is the container which consists merely of arranged fo rms; the ultimate being the [remedial] factor that is not established as the ultimate; conditioned phenomena merely in dependence on the characteristics of unconditioned phenomena; uncondi­tioned phenomena (their opposite); the lack of the extremes of permanence and extinction because a middle that posits extremes is not established; sarp.sara being without beginning and end [in the sense] that, just as its being without beginning and end, also its middle corresponds to the nature of phe­nomena; and the concordant dharmas [of realization] that are not rejected at the time of the path because they, just like a raft, are to be relinquished at the time of the fruition. As fo r the meaning of the fo rmer [three aspects] being called \"[the cessa­tion of] entities\" and these [eight], \"the cessation of imputations,\" th� fo rmer refer to [the cessation of] suffering in terms of contaminated objects, while these here refer to the cessation of the clinging of superimposing subjects onto objects. c) (32) The aspect of the emptiness of the primordial nature teaches the aspect of the nature of the reality of cessation that is excellence. It puts an end to the primordial nature and the agents (such as i8vara) that are imputed by others, such as the tirthikas, because it is not fabricated by them, but repre­sents the purity that is naturally free from flaws. {260} d) (33)-(35) The three aspects of the emptinesses of all phenomena, specif­ically characterized phenomena, and the unobservable teach the aspect of the nature of the reality of cessation that is the aspect of how it is final deliverance. They put an end to the three [kinds of] mistakenness about mere imputations, characteristics, and time. These three [kinds of mistakenness] have the nature of mistaking all phenomena, [characteristics] such as what is suitable as fo rm, and [the three times] (such as the past) for being [actual] objects. Since final deliverance523 is what is to be attained, the way in which said three [kinds of]"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"244 Groundless Paths mistakenness are eliminated through final deliverance teaches the manner in which this [final deliverance] is attained. e) (36) The single aspect of the emptiness of the nature of nonentities teaches the aspect of the nature of cessation that is the aspect of what is final deliverance. It puts an end to the fo ur natures of entities, nonentities, self[­entity], and other[ -entity].524 What is put to an end here is anything that is real as the nature of what is to be attained through final deliverance since said fo ur natures are taught to not exist. In this way, [the sutras] teach cessation through the ceasing of the obscurations because it is taught as what is to be manifested. 525 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.

The actual brief introduction If the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects are divided, they are divided by way of the three omnisciences. {261} Therefore, they consist of the thirty­seven aspects that exist in sravakas, the thirty-four [aspects] that exist in bodhisattvas, and the thirty-nine aspects that exist in buddhas. Through add­ing them up, they are 110 [altogether]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.2. The reasons for dividing the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects into [those of] the three knowledges Some [earlier masters] assert, \"Since the knowledge of all aspects contains the qualities of all noble persons in the manner of the lower being incorpo­rated in the higher, the thirty-seven and the thirty-four that arise in the mind streams of sravakas and bodhisattvas exist in the knowledge of all aspects in an approximately concordant manner. They are merely taught through being labeled with the names of these [qualities as they arise in sravakas and bodhi­sattvas] because [AA IV.4c] says that they are 'in approximate concordance with the reality of the path.'\" Some [others] say, \"Since all the yanas [that consist of said thirty-seven and thirty-four aspects] are the causes fo r buddhahood, they are presented as the aspects that are the causes of the knowledge of all aspects. However, in actual"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 245 fa ct, the aspects of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path are counted as adduced above.\" However, our own system is not to assert said thirty-seven and thirty-four aspects as either the cognitive aspects of the knowledge of all aspects or its causal aspects, but to assert them as the referent aspects that are the objects of the knowledge of all aspects. The knowledge of all aspects is the [ cogniz­ing] subject of all aspects without exception that are based on the three [sets of] objects (entities, the path, and [all] aspects) and their subjects (the three knowledges). Therefore, when its aspects are taught, the aspects of both the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path must be taught too. Since these [two sets of aspects] were taught by way of their defining characteristics before, here these two [sets] are taught by way of their instances. {262} The fa ctors that make one realize the two [sets of] referent aspects that consist of the above twenty-seven [aspects of the knowledge of entities] and the thirty­six [aspects of the knowledge of the path] are the thirty-seven [aspects of the knowledge of entities] and the thirty-four [aspects of the knowledge of the path] in this [explanation of the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects]. Hence, when these [two sets of cognizing] subjects are explained as the fo cal objects [of the knowledge of all aspects], their objects-the fo ur realities­also become the fo cal objects of this [knowledge of all aspects]. For without identifying the fo cal objects and aspects of the path as being such and such, they are not able to be made known. It is by virtue of seeing this implication that what this treatise explains explicitly are the limited aspects that are based on the reality of the path. This is also not a repetition of what was explained before. For the above [twenty-seven aspects of the knowledge of entities and thirty-six aspects of the knowledge of the path] were taught as the respective fa ctors to be realized by these two [knowledges], while here [the thirty-seven aspects of the knowledge of entities and the thirty-four aspects of the know­ledge of the path] are taught as fa ctors to be realized by the knowledge of all aspects. Therefore, this is what refers to their being \"in approximate concor­dance with the reality of the path,\" but such is not tenable if it were to refer to [these aspects] being [merely] nominal-since [being concordant with the reality of the path] applies to all three paths, it would also fo llow fo r the thirty-nine [aspects of the knowledge of all aspects within the knowledge of all aspects that they are merely nominal] .526 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.

On which paths one fa miliarizes with them In general, the scriptures of the mahayana say that, on the path of accumula­tion, one cultivates the first three sets [of remedies];527 on heat and peak, the [five] fa culties; on poised readiness, the [five] powers; on the path of seeing, the [seven] branches of enlightenment; and {263} on the path of familiariza­tion, the [eight] branches of the path [of the noble ones]. The last two [sets] are [matched with the paths of seeing and familiarization, respectively, in terms of their] being predominant or primary [on these paths], but the [eight] branches of the path [of the noble ones] also exist on the path of seeing. Abhidharmakosa [VI.70] explains that, on the path of accumulation, [one cultivates] the fo undations of mindfulness and, on the path of prepa­ration, the fo ur [sets] from the correct efforts up through the [five] powers. On the path of familiarization, [one cultivates] the branches of enlighten­ment because it is closer to enlightenment than the path of seeing. As fo r the paths within the mundane [yanas], they are divided in terms [of the different realms] of beings, so the path of seeing proceeds much fa ster than the path of familiarization. Therefore, on the [path of seeing, one fa miliarizes with the eight] branches of the path [of the noble ones]. Since this progression is the assertion of the Va ibh�ikas, master Va subandhu too refutes it in his auto­commentary [on the Abhidharmakosa]. The explanation by some that the fo rmer and the latter positions represent the manners in which bodhisattvas and sravakas, respectively, cultivate [said seven sets of meditations just shows] that they do not distinguish between the manner in which the clear realizations arise in the mind streams of noble ones and the superimpositions of [certain] proponents of [Buddhist] philosophical systems. For the Vaibha�ikas present it the way they do in terms of all noble persons and the mahayana [presents it the way it does] in terms of [applying] in general.

Otherwise, [there would be] infinite [flaws, such as] having to assert that the minds of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lack self-awareness, that an alaya[-consciousness] is impossible in them, and that, ultimately, their skandhas and so on are not empty. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.2. The difference between substantial and imputational [aspects] The Abhidharmakosa says: In terms of names, ten are substantial-Confidence, vigor, mindfulness, Prajfia, samadhi, {264} equanimity, joy, Thought, ethics, and suppleness. 528 Thus, by condensing [correct] speech, aims of action, and livelihood into one, [namely, ethics, the above aspects] are explained as the ten substantial ones. The autocommentary says: According to the Vaibha�ikas, the actions of body and speech are different and not of similar type. Therefore since the [above three] branches of ethics represent two [different] substances, there are eleven substantial [aspects]. 529 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.1.3. Explanation of the term [\"factors concor­dant with enlightenment\"] This corresponds to the Abhidharmakosa [saying]: The knowledge of termination and nonarising Is enlightenment. Since they are concordant with it, These thirty-seven are the factors that concord with it.530 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.1.2. Meaning of the branches This has seven parts: 1) [The path of] examining entities 2) [The path] that arises from effort 3) [The path of] training in samadhi531 4) [The path of] preparing for clear realization 5) [The path of] connecting with clear realization 6) [The path of] clear realization 7) The path that is conducive to pure final deliverance"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"248 Groundless Paths 1) The first one among these seven sets is explained as the path of examining objects, that is, entities such as the body. It consists of the fourfold fo undation of mindfulness. You may wonder, \"(a) What are their objects, (b) in which way are they examined, (c) through which nature, and (d) for what purpose?\" la) The objects [range] from the body up through phenomena. As fo r the body, there are three. The internal body consists of the five inner sense fa culties that posssess fo rm (the greater Brhaffika and [Ratnakara]santi [saying that this] refers to the six sense fa culties does not accord with the Abhidharmasamuccaya). The external body consists of the five objects (such as fo rms and sounds) that are not the sense organs. {265} The body that is both internal and external consists of (a) the outer ayatanas that possess fo rm and function as the sense organs and (b) the five sense fa culties in the continua of others. Feelings are pleasant, unpleasant, and indifferent. Mind consists of the skandha of consciousness. Phenomena consist of [all] mental fa ctors except fe elings, nonassociated [formations], and unconditioned phenomena. As fo r the internal, [external, and combined aspects] of these last three [sets of objects], in due order they arise through being based upon said three bodies or through fo cusing on them. These fo ur are the objects that childish beings respectively conceive as the support of the self, the basis of the experiences of the self, the nature of the self, and the basis of the self becoming purified. lb) As fo r the manner in which they are examined, the body and so on are examined by way of both their specific and their general characteristics. Their general characteristics are [explained as] \"What is conditioned is imper­manent, what is contaminated is suffering, and all phenomena are empty and identityless.\" The specific characteristics are explained as regarding the respective specific natures of the elements and the elemental derivatives [that make up] the body, of the experiences that are fe elings, of the observer that is the mind, and of the mental factors and so on that are phem,mena as being the [respective specific natures of these objects]. Furthermore, [one consid­ers] the conceptual images of rotten corpses, their disintegration through bugs, and so on that arise in the mind and [the fa ct that] one's own natural body which has not died [yet] {266} bears such properties, has such a nature, and is not beyond these characteristics. [In this way,] one regards [one's body] as being equal in its impurity [to a corpse]. Said three phrases are applied to one's past, present, and future body. One [further] fa miliarizes with fe elings as being suffering; states of mind as being impermanent since they arise as various different [states] due to different supports and fo cal objects; and phe­nomena as being sheer afflicted and purified phenomena devoid of a self. This is the common cultivation [of the fo ur fo undations of mindfulness]."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 249 The uncommon [cultivation of bodhisattvas entails] three differences [in terms of] (a) its focal objects, (b) its mental engagement, and (c) its attain­ment. (a) Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas [focus] only on their own bodies and so on, while bodhisattvas focus on those of both themselves and others. (b) Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas [familiarize with these objects] through men­tally engaging in them as being impermanent and so on, while bodhisattvas familiarize with them through not observing the characteristics of phenom­ena as such [characteristics]. (c) Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas familiarize [with said objects] only in order to become free from their contaminated bod­ies and so on, while bodhisattvas do not [familiarize with them] in order to either become free or not become free from their [bodies and so on], but in order to accomplish the nonabiding nirvat}.a. lc) As for the nature [of the foundations of mindfulness, the Abhidharma­samuccaya identifies it as] \"praj:na and mindfulness.\" Accordingly, it consists of the prajiia of discriminating the specific and general [characteristics] of the body and so on and the mindfulness of retaining [these characteristics] as they were discriminated, without forgetting them. ld) As for the purpose [of the foundations], one familiarizes with them in order to engage in the four realities as what is to known, relinquished, mani­fested, and cultivated, respectively. In this way, through the mindfulness of the body, {267} one knows that the contaminated body has the nature of the suffering of the impregnations of negative tendencies. Through the mindful­ness of feelings, one realizes, by way of their results, that they are the causes for the craving to be separated from unpleasant feelings and to not be sepa­rated from pleasant ones. This craving is the primary [factor] of the origin [of suffering] and is therefore relinquished [in this way]. Through the mindful­ness of mind, one analyzes the mind (the basis for the clinging to a self) as being impermanent and so on and thus puts an end to the clinging to its being such [a self]. Therefore, by virtue of not having any concerns about the self being extinguished, one is not afraid of cessation as what is to be manifested. Through the mindfulness of phenomena, when one understands that all afflicted phenomena are the antagonistic factors and that purified phenomena are their remedies, one understands the [latter] as being the means for putting an end to [all] harm and thus gives rise to them. In these ways, one engages in the four realities. For the Madhyantavibhaga says: Because of the impregnations of negative tendencies, because of being the cause of craving, Because of being the basis, and because of not being ignorant, One should engage in the four realities. Therefore, one cultivates the foundations of mindfulness. 532"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"250 Groundless Paths Furthermore, one relinquishes the four mistakennesses of clinging to purity, happiness, permanence, and a self, cuts through clinging to the four that con­sist of the contaminated body and so on, and attains being free from these four. You may wonder, \"Why are these four called 'foundations of mindfulness'?\" [According to the Abhidharmakosabh�ya,]533 the Vaibha�ikas assert that, just like seizing split wood with a wedge, through the power of mindfulness not forgetting the focal objects and aspects, prajfia engages in its objects. However, master [Vasubandhu] says that prajfia [first] discriminates entities as distinct focal objects. Subsequent to that, through mindfulness {268} seizing these [objects], mindfulness settles on the objects of prajfia. This is excellent. 534 2) As for the path that arises from effort, it is within the engagement in enti­ties (such as the body) through examining them by way of their specific and general characteristics that the vigor of rejecting the factors to be relinquished and adopting their remedies arises. Therefore, on this path, there are the four correct efforts. As before, [their explanation has four parts]. 2a) As for [the question] on which objects one focuses and thus exerts oneself, they are four-[already] arisen and not [yet] arisen virtues (purified phenom­ena) and nonvirtues (afflicted phenomena). 2b) As for the manner in which one exerts oneself, one applies the vigor that serves as the cause for the following four. Through discontinuing one's engage­ment in the afflicted phenomena that have arisen [already], one relinquishes them and does not give rise to those that have not arisen in the mind stream before. One increases the purified phenomena that have arisen [already] and gives rise to those that have not arisen in the mind stream before. In the sutras, these four are discussed by linking each one of them to \"giving rise to striv­ing,\" \"making effort,\" \"applying vigor,\" \"holding the mind,\" and \"settling.\" These s'ii tra [passages] teach the cultivation of vigor including its basis. Thus, striving is the basis because it is the preliminary of vigor. \"Making effort\" represents the mental engagement in the characteristics of calm abiding, holding, and equanimity. Through mentally engaging in the characteristics of these three, this is the time of cultivating flawless remedies. {269} Since superior insight is predominant [here] and calm abiding is not so strong, just like a butter lamp in the wind, the mind is very agitated. Therefore, since true reality is not seen clearly, at that point one mentally engages in the charac­teristic of calm abiding. When the opposite of this [happens], just as when falling asleep, true reality is not seen clearly either. Therefore, at that point one mentally engages in the characteristic of holding the mind. When one rests naturally, with calm abiding and superior insight being well balanced, at that point one mentally engages in the characteristic of equanimity. This is [the meaning of] \"making effort.\" \"To apply vigor\" is [to do so] for the sake of"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 251 eliminating dullness and agitation. For thereafter, one speaks of \"holding\" and so on. That is, when one sinks into inner dullness, through mentally engaging in a buddha statue and so on one holds the mind [in the sense] of uplifting the mind. If one is agitated toward the outside, one settles the mind through mentally engaging in things that make one weary of satp.sara. Through these two [methods], dullness and agitation are eliminated. 2c) The nature [of the correct efforts] is vigor. 2d) As for [the question] for what purpose one exerts oneself, through the first two [correct efforts] one obtains the deterioration of all antagonistic factors without exception and, through the last two, the increase of all remedial fac­tors without exception. You may wonder, \"Why are these four called 'correct efforts'?\" They are labeled with the name of a part of them since one relin­quishes both arisen and unarisen factors to be relinquished.535 Alternatively, the Abhidharmakosabh�ya says: You may wonder, \"Why is vigor explained as correct settling?\" Because body, speech, and mind are correctly settled through it.536 3) As for the path of training in samadhi, in those who are endowed with the vigor of rejecting the factors to be relinquished and adopting their remedies, the mind becomes workable through samadhi. On this path there are the four limbs of miraculous powers. As before, [their explanation] has four parts. 3a) You may wonder, \"Through focusing on which object is mind trained?\" It is [through focusing on] the activities of miraculous powers, such as turning a single body into many and many into one. 3b) \"In what manner is mind trained?\" The Madhyantavibhaga says: Which follows upon cultivating The eight applications that relinquish the five flaws.537 Accordingly, one cultivates the eight relinquishing applications. These eight are striving, effort, confidence, suppleness, mindfulness, alertness, intention, and equanimity. They bear this name because they are applied in order to relinquish..[ the five flaws]. To be endowed with them is [regarded] as a cause. The first four among them are desiring, vigor, trust, and body and mind being workable. In due order, they are presented as support, supported, cause, and result. Since desiring precedes effort, it is its support and, therefore, effort is what is supported [by it]. The cause of striving (the support) is confidence. For if one has the confidence of having trust in cause and result, one desires"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 Groundless Paths the activity of resting in meditative equipoise. {271} The result of effort (the supported) is suppleness. For through applying vigor, the suppleness of body and mind being workable arises. You may wonder, \"They are applied in order to relinquish what?\" [They are applied in order to relinquish] the five factors to be relinquished, which are stated in the Madhyiintavibhiiga: Laziness, forgetting the instructions, Dullness and agitation, Nonapplication, and application­These are asserted as the five flaws.538 Accordingly, [the factors to be relinquished] are five since dullness and agita­tion are taken to be one. The first one is the flaw [at the time] of preparing [for meditative equipoise]; the second one, [the one at the time] of joining with it; the third one, [the one at the time] of resting in meditative equipoise; the fourth one, [the one at the time] when dullness or agitation occur; and the fifth one, [the one] at the time when dullness and agitation have subsided. For in due order, [they mean that] one does not prepare [for meditative equi­poise], mind will not be resting in meditative equipoise, mind will not become workable, one does not mentally engage in the remedies for dullness and agi­tation when necessary, and one mentally enages in them when unnecessary. As for the manner in which these [flaws] are relinquished, the first four [applications] are the remedies for laziness. Though [the actual remedy] is vigor, [all four are presented] in terms of the causes and the result [of vigor]. The latter four [applications] relinquish the latter four factors to be relin­quished. For as the Madhyiintavibhiiga says: Not forgetting the focal object, Recognizing dullness and agitation, Application to relinquish them, And natural flow upon their subsiding. 539 3c) As for mind being trained through which nature, this has two parts. The general nature [of the fo ur limbs of miraculous powers] {272} is samiidhi. Here Abhidharmakosa [VI.68d-69c says] that the explanation of the first three sets [of the factors concordant with enlightenment] being prajfia, vigor, and samiidhi, respectively, is one given [in terms of their] predominantly [repre­senting these three factors]. As for the specific natures [of the four limbs of miraculous powers], they respectively consist of the devoted application of"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 253 the intense striving for virtue, the continuous application of constant vigor, the flourishing of the seeds of mind having cultivated samadhi before, and the samadhi of mind's one-pointed abiding that is based on analysis due to the instructions of others. 3d) As for [mind] being trained for which purpose, through directing one's mind toward the respective miraculous powers and so on that one wishes to manifest, they will be manifested. You may wonder, \"Why are these four called 'the limbs of miraculous powers'?\" The Abhidharmakosabha�ya says: \"Why is samadhi explained as 'the limbs of miraculous powers'?\" Because it is the foundation of obtaining all qualities. 540 The greater Brhattika541 asserts that, with miraculous powers referring to the supramundane path, [they are called] limbs because they are the basis or matrix for it.542 4) As for the path of preparing for clear realization, it is within having trained the mind through the eight [remedies] such as striving that the preparations of heat and peak, which make one clearly realize the [four] realities, arise. On this path there are the five faculties. [Their explanation] also has four parts. 4a) The objects [of the five faculties] are the four realities. For since these [five] are included in the preparation for the path of the noble ones, they bear the aspects of said realities. {273} 4b) As for the manner in which to cultivate them, through relying on the respectively former ones existing as the causes one engages in the respectively latter ones. 4c) As for their nature, from the faculty of confidence up through the faculty of prajfia, in due order, they consist of trust in the four realities, enthusiasm for realizing them, not forgetting the focal objects and aspects in terms of this, the factor of mind's being one-pointed with regard to their actuality, and thoroughly discriminating each one of them. If you wonder to which stages of the path these [faculties] belong, [they belong] to the stages of heat and peak. 4d) Their fruition is to swiftly attain the path of seeing and to accomplish [all] four [stages of] the path of preparation. You may wonder, \"Why are these five called 'faculties'?\" The A.loka says that they \"are the sovereigns of accomplish­ing the path of the noble ones. \"543 5) As for the path of connecting with clear realization, it is within having attained the five faculties (the natures of heat and peak) that the five powers (the natures of poised readiness and the supreme dharma) arise."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"254 Groundless Paths Sa-b) Their fo cal objects and manner of cultivation are like [those of the five] faculties. Sc) As for their natures, they consist of the power of confidence up through the power of prajfia. The difference between these and the [five] faculties cor­responds to what the Abhidharmakosabha�ya [says]: You may wonder, \"Why are nothing but the faculties also explained as the powers?\" Because they, through their difference in being small and big, respectively, [can be] overwhelmed and cannot be overwhelmed [by the afflictions or other mundane phenomena].544 The Aloka says: The arising of the antagonistic factor (such as lack of confidence) and {274} its remedy (such as confidence) in a mixed manner is called \"faculty.\" The arising of solely the remedy, without being mixed with its antagonistic factor, is called \"power.\"545 Sd) The fruition is the accomplishment of the two latter [stages of] the path of preparation and the path of seeing. As fo r it being said that the above [path of preparing for clear realization] and this path respectively prepare for clear realization and connect [with clear realization], in fact, both are [doing] both. However, [they are called so with] the intention that they prepare for the path of seeing (the clear realization of the [four] realities) from some distance and are closely connected to it, respectively. 6) As fo r the path of clear realization, it is within having attained the fourfold path of preparation (the nature of the paths of preparing for and connect­ing with clear realization) in said ways that the path of clear realization-the path of newly seeing the [four] realities-arises. Therefore, on this path, there are the seven branches of enlightenment. You may wonder, \"What are their (a) fo cal object, (b) manner of cultivation, (c) nature, (d) manner of being branches, and (e) fruition?\" 6a) Their focal object is the true reality of the four realities. 6b) As for the manner of cultivating them, through correct mindfulness (the branch of enlightenment) focusing on suffering one seeks to be separated from this [suffering] and abides in that. Through its focusing on the origin [of suffering] one seeks to be free from the desire for this [origin] and abides in that. Through its focusing on the cessation of suffering one seeks to manifest this [cessation] and abides in that. Through its focusing on [the path] that will relinquish suffering by way of accomplishing one's progressing toward"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 255 the cessation of suffering, {275} one seeks to cultivate this [path]. The same [applies] fo r the remaining six [branches]. 6c) As for their nature, that through whose power the other branches are ren­dered not being distracted from their focal objects and aspects is the branch of the matrix [of enlightenment]. This is [the aspect of] the branches of enlightenment that is correct mindfulness ([the phrase] \"the aspect of the branches of enlightenment that is correct ... \" is to be applied to the follow­ing [branches] too). The branch that is the nature [of enlightenment] is the thorough discrimination of phenomena since it is the nature of nonconcep­tual wisdom. The branch of final deliverance is vigor since it makes one go far beyond the level of an ordinary being. The branch of benefit is joy since it benefits body and mind. The branch of the lack of affliction consists of suppleness, samadhi, and equanimity since they are the basis of the lack of affliction, the matrix of its lack, and the nature of its lack. For the first one, through making body and mind workable, relinquishes the impregnations of the negative tendencies of body and mind not being workable. The second one, through the power of meditative equipoise, gives rise to correct prajfia and thus relinquishes the afflictions. The third one functions as the remedy for the afflictions that consist of mind's being imbalanced in that it abides in accordance with the afflictions, its not resting in its own natural flow, and its entailing effort. [Here] the difference between \"basis\" and \"matrix\" lies in being the basis of activity and being the agent, respectively. Thus, the Madhyantavibhaga says: The branch of the nature, {276} the branch of the matrix, The third being the branch of final deliverance, The fourth being the branch of benefit, And three aspects being the branch of the lack of afflictions­These are taught as basis, Matrix, and nature.546 6d) As for the manner of their being branches, the Madhyantavibhiigatika says: The complete and perfect enlightenment of true reality is the nonconceptual wisdom of enlightenment. Since the six547 such as mindfulness concord with enlightenment, they are its branches. As for the discrimination of phenomena, since it has the character of realization, it is enlightenment. [But] since it serves as an aid for the [others], it is [also taken as] a branch. 548"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"256 Groundless Paths 6e) The fruition is the relinquishment of all factors to be relinquished through seeing without exception. 549 7) As for the path that is conducive to pure final deliverance, it is within hav­ing attained the path of the clear realization of directly seeing the [four] realities that the path that is conducive to pure final deliverance (the nature of the path of familiarization) arises. On this path, there is the eightfold path of the noble ones. 7a-b) Its focal objects and manner of cultivation are as above [under the path of clear realization]. 7c) As for the nature [of its branches], just as personal and phenomenal iden­titylessness were realized on the path of seeing, on the path of familiarization one correctly follows what was viewed previously, thinking, \"I realized it in this way.\" This is the aspect of the branches of the path of the noble ones that is cor­rect view ( [the phrase \"the aspect of the branches of the path] of the noble ones that is correct ... \" is to be applied to the remaining [branches] too). In general, the mundane [wisdom of] subsequent attainment delimits the realization dur­ing the time of having been in the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing. {277} Therefore, [the branch of the correct view, which represents said delimi­tation,] must be presented as [a part of] the path of familiarization. However, in the context of presenting it as the path of seeing, though the actual correct view does not arise during the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing, the attainment of the powerful ability to give rise to it [during the following subse­quent attainment] is presented as the attainment of the [correct view]. Correct thought is to delimit the presentation of the realization that was realized through the correct view and to engage in the meaning of the Buddha's words, such as the siitra collections, that present [said correct view]. Correct speech is to be pure of verbal acts such as lying. Correct aims of action are to be pure of physical acts such as killing. Correct livelihood is to be pure of both physical and verbal actions such as corrupt ethics. Here the Madhyantavibhagatika550 says that, when linked to the path of seeing, [correct] thought and speech both refer to obtaining, during meditative equipoise, the power for their arising [during subsequent attainment]. Correct effort means to cultivate the remedies for the factors to be relinquished through familiarization (or for the cognitive obscurations) for a long time without becoming weary. Correct mindfulness is to cultivate, through not forgetting the characteristics of calm abiding, holding [the mind], and equanimity, the remedies for the obscurations of the paths of calm abiding and superior insight that are to be manifested in order to be without dullness and agitation.

As for the assertion by the Vaibh�ikas that these two [kinds of actions] are fully qualified [entities] that possess fo rm, the second Buddha, [Vasubandhu,] refutes it in his Abhidharmakosabha�ya and Karmasiddhiprakarat:ta and pres­ents [both] as [the mental fa ctor] intention.

Instruction on the aspects of the knowledge of the path This has six parts: 1) [The path of] the remedies 2) [The path of] manifesting 3) [The path of] blissfully abiding amidst visible phenomena 4) The supramundane [path] 5) [The path of] relinquishment 6) The path of buddhahood 1) The path of the remedies consists of the three aspects that are the three doors to liberation. In general, there are many ways of presenting the three doors to liberation, but according to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, [one speaks of the door of] emptiness because the two aspects \"empty\" and \"identity­less\" of the reality of suffering are realized as its being empty of a self that is another referent or its nature.553 [One speaks of the door of] signlessness because, [among] the eight aspects of [the realities of] cessation and the path, [the first four] represent being free from conceptions about characteristics and [the latter four], being what makes one free [from such conceptions]. [One speaks of the door of] wishlessness because the two aspects \"imperma­nence\" and \"suffering\" of the reality of suffering and the four aspects of [the reality of] its origin are realized as being the bases for revulsion. In due order, these three [doors] function as the remedies for three [factors]-the cling­ing by virtue of viewing [the skandhas] as a self and what is mine, {280} the conceptions about characteristics that are the results of the views about a real personality, and wishing for the three realms, that is, craving.554 Therefore, they constitute the path of the remedies. [According to the Viniscayasa111grahatzi],555 the statement that emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness are without difference is a general instruction on their [equally] arising from the triad of study, reflection, and meditation. When they are used as the terms for [the corresponding three] samiidhis, they refer to both mundane and supramundane [factors] arisen from meditation. When they are used as the terms for the [three] doors to liberation, they rep­resent supramundane [factors] arisen from meditation.556"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 259 2) The path of manifesting consists of [the first] three [of the eight]libera­tions-(a) looking at form through what possesses fo rm, (b) looking at fo rm through what is formless, and (c) the liberation [of notions] of [specific] beauty. 2a) Looking at form through what possesses fo rm has six parts: a) [Looking] with which supports b) [Looking] by relying on which ground c) [Looking] at which objects d) [Looking] in what manner e) Hermeneutical etymology 0 Looking for which purpose 2aa) As for the supports, in the case of the mahayana they are [the paths] from the greater path of accumulation onward. In the hinayana, they are the nonre­turners who are a bodily witness and those arhats who are liberated by virtue of both elements, [that is, prajfia and meditative absorption]. Abhidharmakosa [VIII.37d] says that the first three liberations arise in a human [psychophysi­cal] support and arise as the actual grounds [of dhyana] in a [psychophysical] support of the desire realm. However, I think that bodhisattvas are [also] able to cultivate them in [psychophysical] supports of the form realm and [those ofj the gods in the desire realm. 2ab) Abhidharmakosa [VIII.32ab] {281} asserts that since the first two libera­tions are progressively cultivated as the remedies fo r the desire for the colors of the desire realm and the first two dhyanas, they are based on the first two dhyanas. However, in that system, the first two [liberations] are held to be the meditation on repulsiveness, which is not what they are identified as here. Therefore, here, according to what the Abhidharmasamuccaya says, [the first three liberations] rely on the culmination of the actual fourth dhyana. 2ac) As for which objects are looked at, [their objects] are small forms, whether they have nice colors, ugly colors, or are bad or good. The same goes for big forms. \"Nice colors\" are those that appear to be beautiful. \"Ugly colors\" are the opposites of those. \"Bad\" refers to [objects] from sounds up through tangible objects that are unpleasant. \"Good\" means the opposites of those. \"Small\" refers to the forms of sentient beings and the possessions that they enjoy. \"Big\" means [things such as] huts and houses. 2ad) As for the manner of looking, with the notion of oneself as the inner looker possessing form, one looks at big, small, good, and bad [forms in the sense] that there is no absolute certainty about their being bigger, smaller, and so on than they [are]. No matter whether the objects that one looks at in this manner are good or bad, one must be free from attachment to them. However, even if one is free from attachment, one has not yet attained mastery over"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"260 Groundless Paths the creative willpower [to manifest these objects] as one wishes and therefore [looks at them] with the wish to attain [such mastery]. In this context, since one must [mentally] establish the notion of oneself as [possessing] fo rm {282}, this is easy if one is not devoid [of fo rm]. But even if one is devoid [of form] through having attained a fo rmless [absorption], one must establish the notion of [oneself possessing] form without [physically] manifesting [in any fo rm]. 2ae) The reason behind the hermeneutical etymology [of looking at fo rm through what possesses form is] that one establishes the notion of oneself as [possessing] fo rm. 2a0 The purpose for which one is looking [in this way is that such looking serves] as the remedy for the obscurations that prevent one from manifesting outer entities just as one wishes. [However,] this is just [one] example-the Yogacarabhumi557 explains that [this liberation] is [cultivated] in order to furthermore accomplish the totalities, [the ayatanas of] overpowering, the miraculous powers of the noble ones, dispassion, the knowledge through aspiration, the discriminating awarenesses, and so on. 2b) As for the liberation of looking at form through what is fo rmless, [except for the following] all other points are as above. The distinct feature of its sup­port is the attainment of the first liberation. The manner of looking is to look with the notion of oneself not possessing form, [that is, with the notion of] the fo �r space[like] names.558 In this context, if one has attained a formless [absorption], [such looking] is easy, but even if one has not attained [a fo rm­less absorption], one must [mentally] establish the notion of not possessing fo rm. The Bahubhumivastu559 explains that, even if one has attained a form­less [absorption], one merely establishes a mental state of formlessness, but does not give rise to that actual [formless] meditative absorption. Therefore, the statement in some texts that the supports of the [first] two [liberations can be] any of the dhyanas and fo rmless [absorptions] entails the intention that even in those who [cultivate these liberations on the basis of] having attained a formless [absorption], there is only the cultivation [of the notion of not possessing fo rm]. On the other hand, there are numerous statements that, within the actual formless [absorptions], forms are [by definition] not taken as objects. Therefore, {283} [the first two liberations] do not rely on the formless [absorptions]. The reason behind the hermeneutical etymology [of looking at fo rm through what is formless is] that the notion of oneself as [possessing] fo rm is destroyed. The meaning of these two establishing or not establishing the notion of oneself as [possessing] fo rm derives from the two [facts] of the manifester appearing or not appearing at the time of manifesting [forms]. 2c) [The explanation of] the liberation [of notions] of [specific] beauty has four parts. (a) The persons [who can cultivate it] differ from the former [two]"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 261 in having attained the first two liberations. (b) As for the ground, they rely on the fourth dhyana. (c) The purpose is [that this liberation serves] as the remedy for the arising of mental states of wishing to manifest beautiful forms and not wishing to manifest ugly ones. (d) As fo r the manner in which [it is cultivated], one relies on the three notions of (1) mutual dependence, (2) mutual connection, and (3) mutually being of one taste. (1) [One starts with] a beautiful, an ugly, and a neutral fo rm (such as a golden, a silver, and a cop­per vase). In dependence on the copper vase, the silver vase is beautiful, but in dependence on the golden vase, it is ugly. Through meditating on these three [forms in this way], one puts an end to the clinging to [forms] being indepen­dently beautiful or ugly. (2) Through meditating on [the fact] that both being ugly in dependence on the golden vase and being beautiful in dependence on the copper vase are connected within the single silver vase, one puts an end to the clinging to beautiful and ugly being different. (3) Through having medi­tated according to the former two [steps], without apprehending everything that is beautiful or ugly as being absolutely distinct, one attains the notion of everything being of one taste as [having the aspect of] being beautiful or being an aspect that one wishes to manifest. This is the time of having accomplished [the third liberation]. {284} You may wonder, \"Why is the path of manifesting presented as the [first] three liberations?\" If one does not look at small, big, good, and bad as not being defini�e, one is not able to manifest them as something other. Therefore, even if one has attained the first two [liberations] and the conviction that the [properties of big, small, good, and bad] are not definite, if one does not put an end to the clinging of being biased about beautiful and ugly, one does not wish to manifest what [one thinks] is ugly. But if one does not manifest what [one thinks is ugly], one has not completed [the power to] manifest [all kinds of things]. Therefore, one must cultivate the third [liberation].560 3) [The path of blissfully abiding amidst visible phenomena consists of the remaining five liberations.] You may wonder, \"In what does one rest in medi­tative equipoise?\" To blissfully abide amidst visible phenomena (that is, [the appearances of] this life) is the path that benefits body and mind, which is five­fold. What are these [five]? First, on the path of abiding in concordance with liberation (niMI}.a) and being free from the manifest fetters [of the afflictions], there are the fo ur actual fo rmless absorptions. These are the [four] fo rmless liberations. One cultivates them through distancing oneself from the craving fo r relishing the fo rmless levels in order for them not to be mixed with such [craving]. Second, in the nature of the path of abiding in the utter peace of the afflictions (such as attachment), or of [primary] minds and mental factors, there is the one liberation of the cessation of feelings and discrimination since these are the main fa ctors to be ceased [here]. This [meditative absorption] is"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 Groundless Paths manifested in order to be liberated from the obscurations of the cessation of fe elings and discrimination. As for the difference between the [regular] fo ur fo rmless [absorptions] and the meditative absorption of cessation versus said [five] liberations, they are [presented as] meditative absorptions by virtue of being balanced with regard to their fo cal objects that consist of the great ele­ments of the body or [primary] minds and mental factors. {285} They are presented as liberations from the point of view of being liberated from the fe t­ters of their own respective levels and not being mixed with them. The followers of the Abhidharmakosa assert that [the liberations] also [include] the preparatory stages [of the dhyanas and fo rmless absorptions, saying that] since the meaning of \"liberation\" is to turn one's back on lower [levels], the uninterrupted paths of the preparatory stages are not liberations, while their paths of liberation are. Thus, [among] the eight [liberations], the first three arise for the welfare of others, while the next five, while entailing the aim of the welfare of others, are liberations in terms of blissfully abiding in the actuality that is seen by oneself. 4) The supramundane path consists of nine [meditative absorptions]. These nine are the eight dhyanas, the formless [absorptions], and the medita­tive absorption of cessation. Since these constitute aspects in relation to the knowledge of the path, they are identified as said [meditative absorptions] in the mind streams of bodhisattvas. As fo r their being presented as the supramundane path, though the Abhidharmikas assert that there is noth­ing uncontaminated within the Peak of Existence, in the mahayana it is held that there is. Therefore, since it is the uncontaminated elements of the eight dhyanas and formless [absorptions] that represent the nature of the supra­mundane path, they are presented as such. Cessation [is said to belong to the supramundane path] by virtue of the need to gain certainty through the supramundane [path]. Here a critical analysis of the meditative absorption of cessation has seven parts: a) Which persons [enter this meditative absorption] b) Based on which mental states [they enter it] c) Through which mental engagement [they enter it] d) Which factors to be ceased are ceased e) Its nature f) Its time g) In which realms [this meditative absorption is entered] a) As fo r which persons enter this meditative absorption, {286} [the position of] the hinayana corresponds to what the Viniscayasarrzgraha1)i says:"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 263 The nonreturning learners who are a bodily witness and the non­learners who are liberated by virtue of both elements are the ones who enter this meditative absorption.561 In the mahayana, [bodhisattvas] are able to enter it from the path of seeing onward. Ordinary beings, stream-enterers, once-returners, and [arhats] who are liberated by virtue of the element of prajfta [alone] are not able to enter it. For in order to enter it, the afflicted mind must have ceased and the mental state of the Peak of Existence must have been attained-the first lack the first [criterion] and the remaining lack the latter. In the Da5abhumika[sutra] it is said that bodhisattvas enter the meditative absorption of cessation from the sixth bhfimi onward. Since this is held to be the cessation within the dhatu free from all reference points, the name is the same but the meaning is different. b) As for the mental states based on which [one enters this meditative absorp­tion, according to Abhidharmakosa VIII.33b] the Abhidharmikas assert the following. Since the mental state of the Peak of Existence is very subtle, based on it it is easy to cease the flux of [primary] minds and mental factors. Therefore, it is the one on which one relies [here]. However, in the mother sfttras it is explained that one can rely on any one of the nine levels. Therefore, the former [position] must be asserted as [applying only to] the time of first making efforts [to enter this meditative absorption]. c) As for the mental engagement [through which one enters this meditative absorption], it is through the mental engagement of seeing that one is not free from the coarse flux of feelings, discrimination, and so on, and thus [giving rise to] the discriminating notion of [wishing to] abide in the peace [of said flux having ceased] through this [meditative absorption]. d) As for which factors to be ceased are ceased, it is seven that are ceased-the six collections [of consciousness] and the afflicted mind {287} together with their accompanying [mental factors]. For if the afflicted mind has not ceased, [just] in terms of whether they are or are not peaceful there is no difference between this [meditative absorption] and the meditative absorption without discrimination.562 This [explanation] refers to the desire realm. However, in the form realm the nose and tongue consciousnesses [do not exist] and, in the formless realm, [all] five collections [of the sense consciousnesses] do not exist. Therefore, [in these realms, only] five and two, respectively, [of the above seven consciousnesses] cease. As for the sravakas saying that only the [first] six collections [of consciousness] cease since the sravaka texts only explain six collections, they [also] explain that only that many [can] be ceased. However, the Viniscayasa�pgraha�Ji explains that, actually, also the afflicted"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"264 Groundless Paths mind ceases. Since the alaya[ -consciousness] exists in this state, it is \"[a state] of being endowed with mind.\"563 e) As for its nature, both the proponents of referents and the followers of the mahayana assert that it is a nonassociated formation. However, the Vaibha�ikas assert that it is substantially established, while [the others] from the Sautrantikas on up hold that it is imputedly existent. Some say, \"The explanation of its being a nonassociated formation accords with the factions of the sravakas. However, in the mahayana's own system, it is held to be a special [type of] samadhi. For the Da5acakra�itigarbhasutra says: Bodhisattvas, through abiding in the samadhi of cessation, com­pletely sever the three discriminations and the three feelings. Also, the mother sutras explain it as [belonging to] the samadhi of cross­ing in one leap, speak of it as a meditative absorption, and [even] explain it as the wisdom dharmakaya of realization. Therefore, it is the nonconceptual wisdom of the noble ones of the mahayana.\" {288} [However,] noble Asati.ga and his brother [say that,] let alone the nature of this [meditative absorption] being cognition, the assertion of the Vaibh�ika monk Vasumitra that there is an unclear mental consciousness in this state is refuted based on the scriptures stating that if there is the mental conscious­ness, [the mental factors] contact, feelings, and so on arise [too]. Also, when they establish that the alaya[ -consciousness] exists for the sravaka factions [too], they say that since the six collections do not exist when having entered the meditative absorption of cessation, if the alaya[ -consciousness] did not exist, this would be just like being dead and so on. 564 Therefore, the texts of these [two] brothers say that it is by virtue of the alaya[ -consciousness] that, during the meditative absorption of cessation, mind exists, but they do not say that mind exists [in it] by virtue [of the existence] of any other [kinds of] consciousness. Since there is no other great mahayana scriptural system that comments in a way that does not accord with this either, one cannot [simply] explain the intention of the sutras and Maitreya through one's own power. Therefore, it is obvious that this comment of the meditative absorption of cessation being a nonconceptual samadhi is not tenable. Furthermore, if this [meditative absorption] were a nonconceptual samadhi, it would have to be a mental consciousness. But in that case, such is not tenable [either] because [Vasubandhu's] Tri111sika [says]: The mental consciousness occurs always"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 265 Thus, it explains the time of its arising in general and then specifically con­trasts this with its not arising during the following five states: Except for in those without discrimination, In the two kinds of meditative absorption, [Deep] sleep, fainting, and also the state without mind. 565 Therefore, it is with the intention that [this meditative absorption] is attained through the power of the path and that buddhas {289} also have the capa­bility to manifest it that it is explained as the wisdom dharmakaya [in the prajfiaparamita sfitras]. However, it is not the case that a substantial [entity] of this [meditative absorption] is generated in the mind streams of buddhas. [Also,] the statement that buddhas enter this [meditative absorption entails] the intention of their having attained the capacity [to do so]. This is not inval­idated through [this meditative absorption] being explained as [belonging to] the crossing in one leap either-it is just as in the case of the mind that is not in meditative equipoise. As for the intention of its being described as a meditative absorption, it is the intention that the state of mind that enters it is a meditative absorption, or that it puts the great elements of the body into a balanced state. It does not exist before the [first] seven collections [of consciousness] have ceased, but exists once they have ceased. Therefore, it is referred to by the conventional term \"conditioned.\" f) As for the length of time during which this meditative absorption is entered, some assert, \"Bodhisattvas enter this meditative absorption only for seven days because [otherwise] they reject the welfare of others.\" However, it is taught that this is not tenable because, [for bodhisattvas,] to enter this meditative absorption also represents the welfare of others. g) As for in which realms [this meditative absorption is cultivated], Abhidharmakosa [11.44cd] explains that, after it has first been generated in the [psychophysical] support of a human, later, [it can be] generated in the form [realm too]. The explanation in the Viniscayasa111grahat:J;566 accords with that, but explains that it is the presentation that needs [to be made] if the alaya[­consciousness] is not accepted. If the alaya[-consciousness] is accepted, [this meditative absorption can be] manifested in all three realms. Thus, this rep­resents the difference between the existence and the nonexistence of a basis of cessation. 5) The path of relinquishment consists of the aspects of the uninterrupted paths that are the dharma readinesses {290} which represent the [cogniz­ing) subjects of the four realities. These are the four dharma readinesses [that have the] defining characteristic of not being associated with the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266 Groundless Paths afflictions to be relinquished through seeing. Though this [path] is explained as the dharma cognition that is the end of the continuum, [according to the Munimatiilarrzkara,]567 to assert it as the path of seeing is the intention of Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra. 6) The path of buddhahood consists of the ten pararnitas (such as generos­ity) that, on the path of progressing to true reality, do not engage in their ten antagonistic factors (the six [factors] from miserliness up through corrupted prajfta, the two of what are not [skill in] means and aspiration prayers, and the two of little power and ignorance). You may wonder, \"If the thirty-seven [aspects of the knowledge of all aspects in terms of the knowledge of entities] are also cultivated by bodhisat­tvas, while [all] the [aspects] from the three doors to liberation up through the path of relinquishment exist in sravakas too, why are these two [sets of aspects] explained to respectively exist in the persons who are sravakas and bodhisattvas and [why] are they explained as the aspects of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path, respectively, [among the three] knowl­edges?\" They are explained [in this way] by virtue of the thirty-seven aspects [being primary for] sravakas and the thirty-four being primary for bodhi­sattvas. How are they [primary)? The specific aim that the sravakas desire is the mere nirvW).a of being liberated from the afflictions, and said thirty-seven [aspects] represent the branches that are indispensable for accomplishing that. For it is said that, though the realization of phenomenal identitylessness exists in these thirty-seven, they primarily entail the completion of the focal objects and aspects of personal identitylessness, and the afflictions arise from the views about a personal identity. [On the other hand,] the eight libera­tions, the nine meditative absorptions, and the ten pararnitas are cultivated as the remedies for the cognitive obscurations because the final desire of bodhisattvas {291} is the omniscience of having relinquished the cognitive obscurations [too]. Alternatively, it is not that the realization of phenomenal identitylessness is presented from the perspective of the isolates of said thirty-seven [aspects of the knowledge of entities]. Therefore, [such a realization is attained] through the power of being embraced by the other paths that represent the extraor­dinary realizations of identitylessness. Consequently since said thirty-seven [aspects] are the ones that entail the focal objects and aspects of personal identitylessness, they represent the aspects of [the knowledge of all aspects that correspond to] the knowledge of entities. In the context of the thirty-four [aspects of the knowledge of all aspects that correspond to the knowledge of the path], the first and the fifth paths both constitute the remedies for the afflictive obscurations. Among the remaining [paths], the liberations and med­itative absorptions [constitute the remedies for] the cognitive obscurations"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 267 that [bodhisattvas and those in] the hinayana have in common, while the ten paramitas are the remedies for the uncommon cognitive obscurations [of bodhisattvas alone]. In brief since these [thirty-four] teach the aspects of the remedies for all of the two obscurations without exception, they are presented as the aspects of [the knowledge of all aspects that correspond to] the know­ledge of the path of bodhisattvas. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.

The subdivisions of the qualities [The qualities are subdivided into] four [sets]. ( 1) The first one consists of the ten aspects of the powers. What are they? a) The power of knowing what is the case and what is not the case consists of knowing such [things] as the following. Through generosity, it is the case that [one will obtain] large possessions, while it is not the case that one will be destitute (through miserliness, the opposite [will happen]); through corrupt ethics, it is the case that one will be reborn in the lower realms, while it is not the case that one will be reborn in the pleasant realms (through ethics, the opposite [will happen]}; through a malicious mind, it is the case that one will be of ugly appearance, while it is not the case that one will be beautiful {292} (through patience, the opposite [will happen]). b) The power of knowing karmic maturations is the knowledge about karma as distinguished by virtuous and evil actions, and about the inferior and the special maturations of [certain] motivations and the actions that [are moti­vated by] them. c) The power of knowing various inclinations is the knowledge about vari­ous [inclinations of beings], such as dwelling in desire, being inclined toward hatred, the opposites [of these], the inclinations or wishes of sravakas, prat­yekabuddhas, and so on. d) The power of knowing various constituents (dhatus) is the knowledge about the many constituents of the world-the eighteen such as the eye con­stituent, the six such as the earth constituent, and so on.568"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"268 Groundless Paths e) The power of knowing superior and nonsuperior faculties is the knowledge about faculties such as confidence being sharp, dull, medium, nonexistent, and so on. 0 The power of knowing the paths that go everywhere is the knowledge about [all] paths that are definite in being the correct paths that go everywhere in [satpsaric] existence and peace, those that are indefinite, those that accord with them, and those that are definitely wrong. g) The power of knowing dhyanas and liberations is the knowledge about the afflicted phenomena of relishing the four dhyanas, the eight liberations, the three samadhis (such as conceptual ones), the four formless [absorptions], and the nine [meditative absorptions] of progressive abiding as well as about the purified phenomena of not observing them, such as entering and rising from the lion's sport or crossing in one leap. {293} h) The power of knowing the recollection of former states is the recollection of many fo rmer states of birth of oneself and others. i) The power of knowing death, transition, and rebirth is the knowledge, through the divine eye, about the present and future deaths, transitions, and rebirths of sentient beings. j) The power of knowing [the termination of the contaminations is the knowledge] about the partial and complete terminations of the contamina­tions from sravakas up through buddhas. Since these [ten] aspects have overcome all antagonistic factors and [can]not be suppressed by them, they are [called] powers. 2) The second [set] consists of the four aspects of the fearlessnesses. (a) The first one among these four is to be fearless about proclaiming one's consummate realization.

Since no such reasons are seen here, through experiencing the attainment of bliss, the attainment of the lack of cowardice, and the attainment of fearlessness, I proclaim this as the stance of a mighty bull. I utter the lion's roar among those that surround me. In the world I shall turn the wheel of Brahma569 {294} that cannot be turned in accordance with the dharma by either sramaJ}.as, brahmans, gods, maras, Brahma, or anyone else in the world. 570"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 269 b) As for being fearlessness about [proclaiming] consummate relinquishment, [the slitra says:] If I proclaim, \"I have terminated the contaminations\" ... neither srama!J.as ... saying that I have not terminated these ... c) As for being fearless about [proclaiming] obstructing phenomena, [the slitra says:] There is no basis such as that what I taught as obstructing phenom­ena not becoming obstructing phenomena if relied upon.

[saying], \"Even if it is practiced correctly, suf­fering will not be terminated perfectly.\" Here srama)J.as and brahmans refer to those who are conceited due to prajii.a; gods and demons, to those with excellence due to the divine eye, knowing the minds of others, and so on; and Brahma, to those with great power and miraculous powers. Therefore, these are mentioned due to their being greatly conceited [in these ways]. Through the power of [buddhas] having attained the bliss of being without their body hairs standing on end [due to fear], shy­ness, and so on, {295} they proclaim their stance of the all-knowing steed and the [mighty] bull because the enlightened activity of their bodies is pure. Through the power of having attained [the state of] their speech being without any trepidation (such as being timid or inferior), they utter [this stance] like a lion's roar because the enlightened activity of their speech is pure. Through the power of having attained the fearlessness of their minds being without doubt, faintheartedness, and so on, they turn the wheel like Brahma because the enlightened activity of their mind is pure. Alternatively, Brahma refers to being a tathagata because of being nobler than everybody [else]."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270 Groundless Paths 3) The third [set] consists of the fo ur aspects of the discriminating aware­nesses. What are they? a) The discriminating awareness of dharmas is to engage in [the objects that consist of] the twelve branches of [a buddha's] speech or the objects that con­sist of the synonyms that are means of expression (such as \"the one with white light\" and \"the one with a rabbit\"}571 without any attachment of relish­ing them and any obstruction of cognitive obscurations. b) [The discriminating awareness of] meanings [is to engage,] as before, in the objects that consist of what is expressed by the twelve branches or the specific and general characteristics of phenomena. c) [The discriminating awareness of] semantics [is to engage,] as before, in the objects that consist of the languages within the six [realms of] beings or the languages of each country. d) [The discriminating awareness of] self-confidence [is to engage,] as before and in order to teach others, in the objects that consist of the mani­fe st triad [(a}-(c)] of dharmas and so on or the subdivisions of the natures and the aspects of phenomena, such as their existing substantially or existing imputedly. Since these fo ur [awarenesses] are without attachment and obstruction with regard to said fo ur [sets of] objects, they are discriminating awarenesses. {296} 4} The eighteen dharmas of the buddha qualities that are unique compared to others are (a) the six that consist of conduct, (b) the six that consist of realiza­tion, (c) the three that consist of enlightened activity, and (d) the three that consist of wisdom. a) The six flaws that will be explained [in the fo llowing] are possible fo r arhats of the hinayana, but tathagatas [lack them. (1) They lack] being harmed by fierce elephants, cattle, dogs, and so on, and lack any mistakenness such as crushing black snakes under their fe et. Therefore, their physical actions are pure. (2) They lack chatter, such as spoiling the path and thus uttering chat­tering sounds and, under the sway of latent tendencies, guffawing like a horse. Therefore, their verbal actions are pure. (3) They lack any deterioration of mindfulness in terms of fa iling to do something by virtue of fo rgetfulness and it then being too late [to do it] . (4) At all times, they lack [a mind that is] not settled in meditative equipoise, no matter whether they rest or do not rest in meditative absorption. (5) They lack discriminations in terms of [satp.saric] existence and nirvaJ.)a being different by way of clinging to them as being dis­cordant or concordant. (6) They lack the indifference of fo rsaking the welfare of sentient beings through not examinining [whether] the time fo r guiding them [is right or not] and so on. These fo ur aspects represent the purity of their mental actions. Thus, [these] are the six [aspects of unique conduct].572"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 271 b) [As for the six aspects of unique realization,] (7) tathagatas lack any dete­rioration of their striving because they always promote the welfare of sentient beings and incessantly wish for the dharmas such as great love and compas­sion. {297} (8) They lack any deterioration of vigor in that they, for the sake of each single sentient being, go to the places of [all] buddha realms that exceed [the number of the grains of] sand in the River Ganga. (9) They lack any dete­rioration of mindfulness in that they, after having become buddhas, place the mental behaviors of all beings in the three times, the means to guide them, and so on onto the path of mindfulness and therefore do not have to think about these [things] later. (10) They lack any deterioration of the samadhi of rest­ing in meditative equipoise in the suchness of all phenomena. ( 11) They lack any deterioration of prajfia because their knowledge of the mental behaviors of sentient beings and teaching the dharma is inexhaustible. (12) They lack any deterioration of their inexhaustible liberation within their promoting the welfare of sentient beings for as long as saip.sara exists. Thus, [these] are the six aspects [of unique realization]. Among these six, striving is the support; the middle four, the faculties; and the last one, the fruition. For those in the hinayana, there is no deterioration of these six once they have been attained, but there is deterioration when they have not been attained [fully]. However, for tathagatas, there is no [deterioration] in either [case]. c) [As for the three aspects of unique enlightened activity,] the enlightened activities of [a buddha's] body guiding sentient beings through radiating light, walking, opening his eyes, and so on; the enlightened activities of his speech instructing sentient beings in accordance with their thinking and their laten­cies; and the enlightened activities of his mind having relinquished all latent tendencies without exception and being endowed with great love {298} arise from the cause of wisdom having arisen before them. Therefore, these are the three aspects of [said enlightened activities both] being preceded by wisdom and, since they flow together with wisdom, following wisdom. d) The three aspects of [unique] wisdom are that [this wisdom], through the mere wish [to know them], knows all knowable objects in the three times that occur in the past, the future, and the present. By virtue of that, it is not attached to them and, by virtue of knowing everything, it is not obstructed [with regard to them either]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.2.

Whose [qualities] they are To have gained mastery over all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena is through the power of what is self-arisen, that is, self-arisen wisdom. [In general,] what is self-arisen is twofold-the dharmadhatu and the wisdom of someone in their last existence realizing all knowable objects. In terms of the first one, this corresponds to what the Ga�;�tjavyuhasutra [says]: Though some worldly realms, Inconceivable [in their number], are burned, Space will not be destroyed. Self-arisen wisdom is just like that. As for the second one, through bodhisattvas having familiarized with the instructions of spiritual friends for a long time, without depending on a mas­ter, [their final wisdom] is self-arisen. {299} As it is said: Having arrived, I am a buddha. I have nobody as a master. Since the first one of these [two kinds of what is self-arisen] is the suchness that is explained by all buddhas, it is the second one that is to be taken here [as that which possesses the above qualities]. 573 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.3.4. For what aim they are [The aim is represented by] the aspect that is buddhahood-the perfect real­ization of all aspects of suchness and variety. Thus, the [last] three [among these thirty-nine aspects of the knowledge of all aspects are suchness, what is self-arisen, and buddhahood]. When the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects is attained through having focused on suchness, it is by virtue of its being endowed with the power of mastering all entities [that it is presented] as what is self-arisen. By virtue of its knowing all kinds of knowable objects without mixing them, it is presented as bud­dhahood. Apart from that, there is no difference. In this way, suchness is the nature of the thirty-six qualities [before it]. What is self-arisen refers to hav­ing gained mastery over the collection of these qualities, or to the persons to which [they belong]. The last [aspect] refers to the aim for which these [ quali­ties] are, [namely, buddhahood]. It is in this way that [these] are the [last] three [aspects of the knowledge of all aspects]. 574"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 273 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.

The training's own nature This has two parts: 1) The manner in which the training arises {301} 2) The training that arises 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. The manner in which the training arises In terms of the manner of its arising, the complete training in all aspects is fivefold. (1) The training in nonabiding is the realization that objects such as form are not real as something that is to abide through clinging to it. (2) The training in nontraining is to not train through clinging to form and so on, which is to train in true actuality. Since these two put an end to the clinging to objects and subjects, respectively, they are [also] called \"putting an end to abid­ing and yoga.\" Alternatively, the meaning of the siitras is to realize that form and so on do not exist as entities that are the objects to be trained in and that it is the realization of this [fact] that, conventionally speaking, constitutes the training. If one familiarizes with the threefold lack of arising [of all aspects, paths, and entities] through not clinging to objects and subjects in this way, the [following three] trainings of realizing the three such as profundity arise. The three such as profundity are the following three. (3) Conventionally, enti­ties are supports, but, ultimately, they do not exist as anything that is to abide. Therefore, they are profound. (4) Though the path is associated with stains, it is naturally pure. Therefore, it is difficult to fathom. (5) Since any end of the aspects that are these two is not observable, they are immeasurable. As for the manner in which these three are realized, the Aloka says: When one, in the manner of not clinging to form and so on, think­ing, \"They are profound,\" does not abide in them as true reality, this is unmistaken. Therefore, the training in profundity with regard to [forms and so on] is attained. When one does also not engage in yoga, thinking, \"They are profound,\" one does not even abide in \"form and so on being profound.\" {302} In this way, through putting an end to abiding and yoga, the unmistaken, meaning of the training in profundity is taught. Likewise, the meanings of the trainings in being difficult to fathom and being immeasurable are to be expressed by following this. sn"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 275 Though entities (the phenomena of skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas) are the supports of bondage, liberation, and so on on the level of seeming [reality], ultimately, they do not exist as anything whose nature is really established. Therefore, they are profound. When they are realized to be profound in this way, the mind that is associated with clinging to real existence does not see them as anything that is to abide and thus becomes without any clinging to the real existence of objects-\"having put an end to abiding\" is the training in nonabiding. When the profound nature of objects is not established as any­thing that is to abide, from the perspective of the mind as the subject too, [mind] is not engaged in yoga, thinking, \"They are profound.\" Thus, the mind does not cling to objects that are not established as anything whatsoever as being anything whatsoever-\"having put an end to yoga\" is the training in nontraining. That there is no clinging in this manner from the perspective of both object and subject is the training in the profundity of the knowledge of entities and the same applies for the remaining two [trainings]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.2. The training that arises The training that arises through these means is fifteenfold. [It can be divided into] two [categories-the trainings ofj those who attain [buddhahood] through great hardships and of those who attain it in an easy manner. First, (1) in persons who are beginners with dull faculties, fear, terror, and so on about the points of profundity, being difficult to fathom and being immea­surable, arise. {303} This makes them realize [buddhahood through training] with great hardships and over a long time. Secondly, as for those who attain [buddhahood through training] in an easy manner, (2) those of sharp fac­ulties who are neither afraid nor terrified about nonarising realize the three objects in an easy manner by way of their twofold lack of clinging [to objects and subjects, respectively]. Thus, [they train in the manner of] receiving the prophecy [of attaining buddhahood] at the latest [after] three buddhas [have appeared]. (3) [They train in] making the realization of the mother that has arisen in them irreversible through seizing [this realization] and so on. (4) [They train in] becoming finally delivered from the phenomena that obstruct the knowledge of all aspects. (5) [They train in] their being close to what was prophesied not being obstructed by clinging to the mother and so on. (6) [They train in] being close to perfect enlightenment. (7) [They train in] becoming enlightened swiftly in the form of perfect buddhahood. (8) [They train in] the welfare of others through turning the wheel of dharma for the sake of the benefit and happiness of beings and encouraging them [to practice accordingly]. (9) [They train in] seeing that the way of being of phenomena is without increase and decrease. ( 1 0) [They train in] not seeing dharmas (white actions) or nondharmas (black actions) and so on. (11) [They train in] the"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"276 Groundless Paths lack of conceit of not [even] seeing the inconceivability of form and so on.

(14) [They train in] purifying the subtle impregnations of negative tendencies. (15) They train in a set period of time-not giving up their efforts after they have set a period of time (from days to years) for writing down the precious mother, listening to her, and so on. This last [training] is the cause of the fourteen [preceding] trainings. { 304} As for the boundary lines of these [trainings], [the training with great hard­ships and the training in] the prophecy [exist on] the path of accumulation and [the level of] heat, respectively.

The preliminary dharmas of the training This has four parts: 1) The qualities to be attained 2) The flaws to be rejected 3) The defining characteristics to be known 4) The factors conducive to liberation (what is to be relied on in the mind stream) 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4. 1. The qualities to be attained For the persons who delight in and practice the unmistaken trainings in this way, there are fourteen reasons for the arising of many kinds of benefit, based on which they attain fourteen benefits. In due order, these are as follows. (1) In order to weaken the power of the maras who obstruct the persons who cultivate the trainings, the power of these maras is vanquished through the blessings of the buddhas. (2) Since the minds of the tathagatas consider said [persons] for the sake of giving rise to their capacities to train, they are considered and known by the tathagatas in all situations. {305} (3) Since the tathagatas see them with the eye that is the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects in order for their training to become special, they are perceived by the buddhas. ( 4) Since they, by virtue of these points, are close to the tathagatas, they are close to attaining completely perfect enlightenment. (5) Since they"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 277 are endowed with the great benefit of seizing the mother through writing her down and of venerating her, they attain the great aim of not being separate from the buddhas, the great benefit of being born in the pleasant realms, the great fruition of enlightenment, and the great maturation of engaging in the welfare of others even after having passed into nirv�a. ( 6) Since they per­form the activities of the tathagatas, they come to write down the mother and so on in places where the mother has spread, such as Partani. (7) Since they perfect the dharmas that are the remedies for the two obscurations, they perfect all uncontaminated qualities (such as the six paramitas). (8) Since they obtain discourses of the knowledge of all aspects from the tathagatas, even after having died and transited, they proclaim the discourses on the unborn that start with perfect enlightenment. (9) Since the tathagatas function as their companions and protectors, they [can]not be separated from perfect enlight­enment through maras and the hordes of mara. (10) Since they have given rise to the [great] joy in seeking the supramundane dharmas, the [great] openness of relying on the three refuges, and the great delight of their minds engaging in virtue, the virtuous roots that are not in common with sravakas and pra­tyekabuddhas {306} (generosity and so on pure of the three spheres) arise [in them]. ( 11) [The tathagatas] know that the words of the vow \"I shall establish many sentient beings in enlightenment,\" which the ones who cultivate the trainings take in the presence of the tathagatas, are their pure motivation. Thus, [the tathagatas] rejoice in their vow and, therefore, they actually accom­plish it in precise accordance with its meaning of promoting the welfare of sentient beings. (12) Since they desire and aspire for the profound and vast dharma, they take hold of the vast maturational result that is buddhahood. (13) Since they attain the special capacity of promoting the welfare of sentient beings, they accomplish the welfare of sentient beings by way of giving them inner and outer things including their results. (14) Since they do not abandon their vigor for the six paramitas (their past roots of virtue of having found prajfiaparamita in its entirety), they definitely obtain the mother even when they change [from lifetime to] lifetime. Here the land Partani is explained by some as the central area of India, while some [others] explain it to refer to areas in the east and north of India and soon. As for the meaning of \"during the last five hundred [years]\" in this context in the sfitras, 579 Santar�ita asserts that during the first half of the teaching's remaining for ten times five hundred [years], they increase, while they decline during the latter half.

The actual flaws The flaws are forty-six, which consist of (1) the twenty-three of the adverse conditions for the arising of unarisen trainings being dose and (2) the twenty­three of the favorable conditions [for such arising] not being complete. 1) The adverse conditions being dose are twofold-those that depend on (a) oneself and (b) others. la) The adverse conditions that depend on oneself are threefold-hindrances for (a) understanding the meaning, (b) the activities of the three doors, and (c) engaging in the mahayana. 1aa) ([The phrase] \"At the time of cultivating the training\" is supplemented at the beginning of all [of these flaws] .) [The first] two are (1) to attain an understanding of the mother over a long time and with great hardships and thus being weary of it and, (2) without examining former and later lifetimes, a very swift arising of self-confidence in terms of understanding the mother and thus being conceited thereby. 1 ab) As for the activities of the three doors, ( 3) at the time of writing down the mother and so on, [one may be distracted by] the impregnations of the nega­tive physical tendencies of the physical expressions of yawning or laughing, \"Ha ha,\" or of fooling around with others with the body or what is connected to the body. ( 4) [At said time,] one may be distracted by the impregnations of the negative mental tendencies of the mind being distracted toward friends and so on, or mutual attachment to pleasant objects in dependence on oneself and others, or [thinking,] \"I do not experience the taste of this mother,\" thus rising from one's seat and going somewhere else. (5) [This flaw is] threefold. One's recitations and explanations may be produced with said three improper physical [conducts]. {308} Or one's retaining [of the mother] up through one's mental engagement [in her] may be produced with said three improper mental [conducts].

(6) If bodhisattvas have not entered the flawless, there is no prophecy about them. Therefore, when there is no prophecy about them, they may hold on to reasons for turning away from the mother, thinking, \"I have not been prophesied. The village where I was born and so on are not mentioned.\" The following six are not different as far as rejecting the mother and then engaging in the scriptural collections of inferior [yanas] goes-they are merely presented as different by way of isolates. (7) Just as one's aim is not accomplished if one discards the roots of a tree and then searches for its branches, to reject the rootlike mother, who is the cause of mundane and supramundane qualities, and then engage in the scriptural collections of inferior [yanas], which are like branches and so on, means to fall away from holding on to the causes of the knowledge of all aspects. (8) Just like a dog who does not beg [for food] from a master from which excellent and lots [of food] would come, but begs [for food] from a ser­vant from whom [only] bad and little [food] comes, to reject the mother, who is the root of all dharmas of the tathagatas and then engage in the [scriptural] collections of inferior [yanas] means to fall away from experiencing the taste of excellence, that is, the bliss of the supreme fruition. Thus, the former and the latter [are presented] from the perspectives of the isolates of falling away from the cause and the result, respectively. (9) Just like not knowing the char­acteristics of an elephant when having found one and then {309} searching for its characteristics in its footprints, to not take hold of the mahayana by virtue of the mother, but [trying to] take hold of it by virtue of inferior [scriptural] collections means to fall away from completely taking hold of the mahayana in all aspects since it is impossible to find it in the [inferior scriptures]. [This is presented] from the perspective of the isolate of falling away from both cause and result. (10) Just as when some who desire gems see the ocean and then, being satisfied with [taking it] to be equal to the water in a cow's footprint, do not set sail on the ocean and thus do not obtain the gems for which they aim, through being satisfied with [taking] the mother and inferior [scriptural] collections to be equal and thus not engaging in the mother, it is impossible to attain one's desired aim-the knowledge of all aspects. Therefore, one con­stantly falls away from one's aim. (Up to here, this is the first set of ten [among the forty-six flaws].) (11) Just like a mason who wishes to build a palace equal in size to [Indra's] palace, Vaijayanta, through [trying to take] the measure of the orbs of the sun and the moon, one falls away from the connection between the cause and the result [in terms of the knowledge of all aspects].

The first two among these six [cases of] falling away refer to striving for the result of inferior yanas. The following one and [the last] three, respectively, mean that, despite one striving for the mahayana knowledge of all aspects, {310} one does not understand the actuality of the mother and her being the cause of true reality. Therefore, [to fall away from] the former [set of] two [in terms of] cause and result and to fall away from the following causes and results is not repetitious. This is the meaning of the sutras. 1acb) The eight causes for being distracted from the mahayana are (13) the arising of many conceptual [forms of] self-confidence through clinging to many kinds of objects (such as forms and sounds); (14) clinging to writing letters as being the mother; (15) clinging to mere nonentities as being the mother; (16) clinging to mere written-down letters as being the mother; (17} clinging to solely what is without letters as being the mother; (18) mentally engaging in landscapes that are pleasant and so on, single houses, villages, cit­ies where the eighteen kinds of arts and crafts exist, market towns where there are many merchants, areas where the four castes dwell, and so on; (19) savor­ing gain (such as obtaining gems) and fame (that is, services being rendered to one, such as silken ribbons of glory being tied to one, and verses [of praise being dedicated to one]); and (20) searching for skill in means in scriptural collections that are taught by maras and are not the means for attaining bud­dhahood. (Up to here, this is the second set of ten.) 1b) The three adverse conditions that depend on others are (21) the activities of maras arriving in the disguise of fully ordained monks, saying, \"What is found in my sutra collection represents the mother, but the large, medium, and brief [mother sutras] and so on are not the mother,\" thus {311} creating schisms in the dharma and between persons; (22) [maras] procuring the con­trivances of teaching sutra collections of a facsimile mother; and (23) maras, through magically appearing as buddhas, making one give rise to desire for them, thus giving rise to confidence and desire for inappropriate objects of confidence and desire. 2) The favorable conditions not being complete is twofold-those depending on (a) both oneself and others and (b) oneself alone. 2a) Those that depend on both oneself and others are twofold-those that are connected to (a) the one who listens [being mentioned] first and (b) the one who explains [being mentioned] first."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 281 2aa) Those that are connected to the one who listens [being mentioned] first are (24) falling away from shared dharma activities by virtue of the listener having great striving for writing down the mother and so on versus the one who explains being very idle and lazy; in the same way, [the listener and the one who explains, respectively,] falling away from shared dharma activities through (25) wishing to listen in a certain area versus wishing to explain in another area; (26) being content and having little desire for dharma robes and so on versus the opposite of that (not having little desire); (27) being endowed with the twelve qualities of abstinence (such as [begging for] alms) versus not being endowed with them; (28) through having a virtuous and striving char­acter, desiring to write down the mother and so on versus, through having a nonvirtuous character that lacks confidence in the [mother], not desiring to write down the mother and so on; (29) giving away daily necessities to others versus being miserly about them; (30) wishing to give dharma robes and so on to the one who explains versus the [latter] not accepting them; {312} (31) understanding through Uust] mentioning the beginning of [a certain] dharma and not emphasizing words versus understanding through elaborations and emphasizing words; (32) knowing the dharmas of the twelve branches of [a buddha's] speech (such as the sfitras) versus not knowing them; and (33) being endowed with the six paramitas (such as generosity) and wishing to train in them versus the opposite of that (not being endowed with them). (This is the third set of ten. )581 As before, applying [mentioning] the one who listens first and the one who explains later, [the remaining] four [flaws] are (34) being skilled in the means of the paramitas and striving for such skill in means versus the opposite of that (being skilled in what are not the means); (35) having attained the dharaiJ.i of not forgetting words and their meanings versus not having attained it; (36) wishing to write down the mother in letters up through mentally engaging in it properly versus not wishing to do all this; and (37) being free versus not being free from the five obscurations (mali­ciousness, sleepy dullness, agitation, regret, and doubt) that are exemplified by desire for sense pleasures. 2ab) [The flaws that are] connected to the one who explains [being men­tioned] first are (38) [delighting in] solitude (being alone) versus delighting in the hustle and bustle of a retinue; (39) the listeners wishing to follow the one who explains while the [latter] does not provide any opportunity and the listeners refusing [to follow] while [the one who explains] wishes them to follow;582 (40) wishing to teach the dharma for just the tiniest bit of mate­rial goods versus not wishing to give them; (41) wishing to go to places that are life-threatening {313} versus not wishing to go there (by adding the two [flaws] that depend on oneself alone, which will be explained [below], to the eight up to here, the fourth set of ten [is complete]); (42) wishing versus not"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"282 Groundless Paths wishing to go to places where there are famines and so on; (43) wishing to go to places haunted by robbers and so on versus not wishing to go there; and (44) the one who explains mainly looking at households of loved ones and so on, through which the listener feels mentally uncomfortable. [All] such [cases of] falling away from shared dharma activities become flaws by virtue of masters and students disagreeing, both thinking before­hand, \"If [the other one] agrees with a certain one of my own desires, I will engage in [shared] dharma activities, but otherwise I will not.\" Otherwise, it would very absurdly follow that [the fact of] master and student being old and young, respectively, also constitutes a flaw. [Also, the manners of presenting these flaws by way of] relating them to those who listen first and to those who explain first, respectively, represent mere indications, while their opposites also constitute flaws. 2b) [The flaws] that depend on oneself alone are as fo llows. (45) If the suffer­ings (such as hunger) of the three lower realms are mentioned, one does not aspire to go to the lower realms for the welfare of others and becomes weary. ( 46) If the gods or mere peace is praised, one delights in one's own welfare of going to the pleasant realms and manifesting [states] such as a stream­enterer. These are the two [flaws] that depend solely on those who cultivate the training. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.2.2. The remedies that eliminate them The example of precious substances [provoking] many enemies [illustrates that] {314} there are many hindrances fo r those who cultivate the trainings. However, through the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten times always con­sidering and thus protecting them and so on, they will not fall away from the trainings, just as when a mother with many children has fallen ill, all of these [children] will perform healing rituals [for her]. The [Prajftaparamita]­samcayagatha [says]: It is fo r four reasons that skillful powerful bodhisattvas Are difficult to be defeated by the four maras and cannot be shaken [by them]-Abiding in emptiness, not abandoning the welfare of sentient beings, Acting in accordance with what [the buddhas] say, and being endowed with the blessings of the sugatas.583"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 283 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.

The general presentation Though there are many different descriptions of defining characteristics in general, here they are described as \"the defining characteristics of knowledge, distinctiveness, activity, and nature.\" From knowledge up through nature, in and of themselves, these undoubtedly represent their own specific natures and their own specific defining characteristics. However, here these four must be explained as the defining characteristics of the trainings. Therefore, based on that, the last defining characteristic represents the nature [of the trainings], while [the characteristic of] distinctiveness has mostly another meaning, and the two [characteristics] of knowledge and activity illustrate the causes by way of their results. {315} Just as \"crow\" illustrates \"palace,\"584 [said characteris­tics] are merely made understood in said ways. The great system founders of the land of snows assert that this means that the causes are illustrated by their results, which is the intention of the root text and its commentaries. Some great translators say that since there is no difference between \"instance\" (mtshan gzhi) and \"definiendum\" (mtshon bya), with the equiv­alent term (la�ya) [in Sanskrit] being the same, the explanations by those Tibetans who take them to be distinct is not tenable. [However,] since [the lat­ter explanations] are precisely what appear in the great scriptural systems [of Indian mahayana], it is good not to apply the conventional term \"instance\" to the definiendum-the pertinent subject that consists of the trainings. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.1.2. The specific manner of defining This has two parts: 1) The meanings of \"what establishes an agent\" and \"what establishes an object\" 2) The uncommon manner of defining"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.1.2.1. The meanings of \"what establishes an agent, and \"what establishes an object, For example since [the single term] \"to boil\" is a word that is connected to [both] what is acted upon and the agent (that which is boiled and that which boils it), it is suitable to be adduced in both [cases]. Likewise, with the inten­tion that [the single term] \"defining characteristic\" is connected to both the agent and what is acted upon (that which defines and that which is defined), venerable [Maitreya uses it in the sense of] the first three defining charac­teristics [of knowledge, distinctiveness, and activity] being what define [the trainings], while he uses the last one in the sense of what is defined. For these two (agent and what is acted upon), master [Haribhadra] coined the conven­tional terms \"what establishes an agent\" and \"what establishes an object,\" respectively. Therefore, there are very many applications of \"what establishes an agent\" and \"what establishes an object\" to [cases] such as what makes one understand and what is understood (like a reason and a probandum), what cuts and what is cut (like an axe and a tree), and what is aware and what it is aware of (like subject and object). {316} 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.1.2.2. The uncommon manner of defining You may wonder, \"Why are the first three defining characteristics called 'what establishes an agent'?\" Because these three define the trainings. \"How [do they do that]?\" As defining factors, the two [characteristics] of knowledge and activity respectively define the two capacities of realizing the three know­ledges (one's own welfare based on the training in the three knowledges) and of giving rise to enlightened activity (the welfare of others). Therefore, these two capacities represent the instances or definienda. As for their manner of defining, when one sees an excellent harvest arising in a field, one infers that this [field] has the capacity to produce [this harvest]. Likewise, when one sees that the [special] realizations of the three knowledges and the special enlightened activity that promotes the welfare of others origi­nate from the trainings, one infers that these trainings possess the capacity to produce them. Since said two [defining characteristics] point out that said capacities exist [in the trainings], they define them in the manner of excluding nonpossession. 585 [Some people] may wonder, \"Do these [capacities] also exist in the trainings of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas?\" To [answer] that, the defining character­istic of distinctiveness makes one understand that [said capacities] exist only in the [mahayana trainings], but not in others. Therefore, it defines them in the manner of excluding possession by others. 586 You may wonder, \"Why is the last [defining characteristic] called 'what establishes an object'?\" This is because it, by virtue of being the nature of the"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 285 training in the three knowledges, is what is defined through the former three [characteristics]. You may wonder, \"Aren't said capacities what is defined? How is the training what is defined?\" Since these two are not different entities, there is no flaw. For [all] these [defining characteristics] are not fully qualified defining characteristics and definienda that, respectively, represent what sets up [something] and what is set up [by it]. {317} You may wonder, \"If this [last characteristic] is a definiendum, how can it be suitable as a defining character­istic?\" Didn't I say [above] that the term \"defining characteristic\" is connected with both the object and the agent? Also since the sixteenfold [defining char­acteristic that is the] nature makes one know the nature of the training in the three knowledges, it is also something that defines. \"But is [this characteristic] then not something that establishes an agent?\" There is no flaw-though it defines the trainings, in terms of another meaning it does not define them and thus is not something that establishes an agent. 587 However, the former three [defining characteristics] are presented as what establishes an object because, in their own respective ways, they have a different meaning than said [ defin­ing characteristic that is the nature]. It may be said, \"However, since these [defining characteristics] are different instances and entities, they are not suitable as defining characteristics and definienda, respectively. Otherwise, it very absurdly follows that even a vase would be the defining characteristic of an ox.\" Though they are different in nature, by way of them one is made to understand, and it is [this very fact] that is merely labeled as the defining characteristic \"being defined through them.\" Therefore, they do not repre­sent [actual] defining characteristics in terms of what sets up [something] and what is set up [by it]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.2. The manner in which knowing the defining charac­teristics is a preliminary When those who have the mahayana disposition strive with certainty for unsurpassable enlightenment, they engage in its cause-the yogas of the mother. Since one needs to analyze whether said [persons] at said time have or do not have the capacity to give rise to the final realization, the defining characteristic of knowledge [must be taught] in order [to understand that they do have said capacity]. Furthermore, if the capacity of giving rise to the final welfare of others does not appear in these [persons], since mere realiza­tion is not the primary object to be strived for in the mahayana, the defining characteristic of activity [must be taught] in order to understand that. If said two capacities existed on the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas too, any engagement in the mahayana path, on which one must undergo many hardships, {318} would be stopped. Therefore, the defining characteristic of distinctiveness [must be taught] in order to understand that said [capacities]"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"286 Groundless Paths do not exist [on the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] . The last defin­ing characteristic must be taught in order to make one understand that the own nature of the [mahayana] trainings consist of being endowed with the corresponding relinquishments and realizations. Therefore, this is the man­ner in which knowing said [four] defining characteristics is a preliminary for cultivating the trainings. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.3. Instruction on their boundary lines [To know said defining characteristics] is presented as [ranging] from the path of accumulation up through the tenth bhlimi because [the trainings] are cultivated by way of each cultivation of a training preparing [for it through] these [defining characteristics]. 588 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.3.4. Elaboration on these defining characteristics A critical analysis of the mind coming fo rth, withdrawing, and so on in the context of the defining characteristic of knowledge of the knowledge of enti­ties has fo ur parts: 1) The nature of the [wrong] views 2) The manner in which these fo ur states of mind are matched with affir­mation and negation 3) [The views] of which persons they are 4) Explanation of the term [\"undecided\"] 1) [The views in question] are fo urteen-( a) the fo ur that depend on a start­ing point, (b) the fo ur that depend on an end point, (c) the fo ur that depend on nirviir;ta ([altogether] twelve), (d) the view that body and life-force are one, and the view that these two are different. 589 [The views under] (a) are the views that the self and the world are per­manent, impermanent, both, or neither. They depend on a starting point because, through these [views], one respectively clings to said two [(the self and the world)] as something that exists in an unchanging manner right from the start, being something that arises in a sudden manner later, being both, or being neither. [The views under] (b) are the views that the self and the world have an end, do not have [an end], both, or neither. They depend on an end point because, through these [views], one respectively clings to said two {319} as having or not having an end and so on at a later time. [The views under] (c) are the views that tathagatas [still] manifest after hav­ing passed away, do not manifest, both, or neither. They depend on nirviir;ta because, through these [views], one respectively clings to sentient beings, who have the nature of a self, manifesting or not manifesting after death and so on. As fo r the self in \"the self and the world\" in these [views], [it refers to] a"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 287 personal self, while the world is thought of as the basis of what is experienced by that [self]. As for the tathagatas, according to the Abhisamayala'l'lkiiraloka and the smaller Brhaffika,590 it refers to sentient beings whose nature is a self, whereas it does not fit with the Ayatas if it referred to the liberated self. [The views under] (d) refer to [two kinds of] clinging, [thinking,] \"What is the body is the life-force\" and \"The life-force is other and the body is other.\" This corresponds to the Bahubhumivastu [saying]: The view of some that the life-force is the body is the view that the self possesses fo rm. The view that the life-force is other and the body is other is the view that it does not possess fo rm. 591 2) As fo r the manner in which these fo ur states of mind are matched with affirmation and negation, the Vrtti says: The mind engaging in its specific object is called \"coming fo rth\" ... 592 Accordingly, the three first [views in (a)-(c), respectively,] are matched with \"coming fo rth\"; the three third [views in (a)-(c), respectively,] and the thirteenth one, with \"being scattered\" (which is included in [the phrase] \"and so on\" [in the Vrtti]); the three second [views in (a)-(c), respectively,] with \"being withdrawn\"; and the three fo urth [views in (a)-( c), respectively,] and the fo urteenth one, with \"being closed.\" {320} For the fo urteenth one­\"Neither is the body the life-force nor is the life-force the body\" -negates both [possibilities]. [In the order of the terms \"coming fo rth\" and so on as enumer­ated here,] the first two represent affirmations since the mind engages in its respective object without negating said object. The latter two represent nega­tions since [the mind] negates [its respective] object and thus does not engage in this object. [In the normal progressive order of said fo ur terms,] though the third one [(\"being scattered\")] entails both negating and affirming views and the fo urth one [(\"being closed\")] negates both affirmation and negation, they are presented as affirmation and negation, respectively, because they have or do not have a [certain] object. The Suddhamati says: Proliferating593 is affimation, that is, what is called \"existence.\" Being withdrawn is negation, that is, what is called \"nonexistence.\" Being scattered is both, that is, what is called \"both existence existing and nonexistence not existing.\" Being closed is the negation of both, that is, what is called \"being neither existent nor nonexistent.\" The same should be understood for being permanent, impermanent ... 594"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"288 Groundless Paths 3) As for these [views] being [the views] of which persons, the Srupkhyas assert that, when one has died, [the self] exists in a nonmanifest manner. Therefore, it is the thoughts about opening ([such as] \"manifesting after hav­ing passed away\") that are theirs. Since the A yatas and others assert that, when one has died, the self perishes in all respects without continuing at all, it is the thoughts about being closed595 ( [such as] \"not manifesting after having passed away\") that are theirs. Since the Nirgranthas assert that what possesses a state and that state are different, it is the thoughts about both opening and clos­ing ([such as] \"[both] manifesting and not manifesting after having passed away\") that are theirs. Since those [Buddhists] who propound a person assert that the self is inexpressible as being either the same as, or different from, the skandhas,596 {321} it is the thoughts about negating both opening and closing ([such as] \"neither manifesting nor not manifesting after having passed away\" that are theirs. The same should be applied to [the remaining of the fourteen views], such as being permanent. This is the intention of master [Haribhadra in his Abhisamayala,.kdraloka]. As for the meaning of this, some explain, \"Though 'having an end' is explained first in the siitras, it is in order if this is reversed for the SaJpkyas and the Ayatas.\" [However,] in that case, since [the order of] affirmation and negation is reversed, such is not tenable. Therefore, the Vyakhyayukti says: End [refers] to exhaustion, the final part, Being close, direction, and being lower.597 Accordingly, it is very much in order if the meaning of \"[having an] end,\" through referring to the factors that are the skandhas of the next life, is explained as possessing the factor of the consciousness of this life entering the next one, while \"not having an end\" is the opposite of that. As for [the terms] \"opening\" and \"being closed,\" they refer to the [above] two [terms] \"coming forth\" and \"being withdrawn,\" which respectively have the aspects of affirmation and negation alone. The two [terms for] affirming both [\"opening\" and \"being closed\"] and negating both are \"being scattered\" and \"being closed,\" respectively. In the last two [among the fourteen views], it is not clear what the person is, but Sthiramati explains that the Vaise�ikas assert the self as having form and the Srupkhyas, as being cognition. Therefore, [the last two views] are respec­tively matched with said two [schools]. 4) As for the explanation of the term [\"undecided\"], you may wonder, \"Why are these fourteen called 'undecided'?\" When the Tathagata was asked about these [fourteen issues], they were all asked by starting with [the notion of] a self. Therefore, with the intention that one cannot analyze any distinctive"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 289 fe atures in what lacks any basis [in the first place], {322} he gave undecided answers. Thus, they are [referred to as] undecided. You may wonder, \"But why did he not say that such a self does not exist?\" He did not say that because the [persons who asked these questions] were not vessels to be taught the lack of a self. 598 Furthermore, in the context of the defining characteristic of distinctive­ness, only the path of seeing is mentioned, but not the other two [paths]. Since the path of seeing is the result of the path of preparation and the cause of the path of familiarization if [the characteristic of distinctiveness] is explained with regard to said [path], it is also understood with regard to the other [two paths]. For if the cause does not have any distinctiveness, the distinctiveness of its result would be without cause, and, if the result has no distinctiveness despite its cause having distinctiveness, the [distinctiveness] of the cause would be pointless. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.4.

The [psychophysical] supports in which it arises This has two parts: 1) Physical supports 2) Mental supports 2.2.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Physical supports The Abhidharmakosabha�ya599 explains that [the factors conducive to libera­tion] arise only among humans. Since there is no prajna in [the beings of] the lower realms and no weariness in [those of] Uttarakuru and the god [realms], it does not arise in them. This is the assertion of the Vaibha�ikas. The follow­ers of the mahayana [assert the physical supports] according to the following: At that time, hundreds of thousands of gods and humans Generated the mind for enlightenment. [The Sagaranagarajapariprcchasutra] states that twenty-one thousand nagas generated the mindset fo r the mahayana and [the prajfiaparamita sutras] say that, through the light of the Tathagata, even the sons of the gods in the fo rm [realm] were made vessels in whom the knowledge of the path arose."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"290 Groundless Paths Therefore, there is no certainty [that the factors conducive to liberation arise] only in those in the desire realm and, [among them,] in hum�s. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.4.1.2. Mental supports The Abhidharmasamuccaya600 explains that the fully qualified [prajfia] that arises from meditation exists in these [factors conducive to liberation]. {323} Accordingly, they [can] also rely on the states of mind of the dhyanas. But in the Abhidharmakosa601 it is explained that they lack [said prajfia] arisen from meditation. Accordingly, they rely on just [the meditative states of] the desire realm. Though this is the case in the abhidharma, according to the mahayana something like the great path of accumulation mostly relies on the actual fourth dhyana. This was already described in [the section on] the instructions [in the chapter on the knowledge of all aspects]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.4.2. The nature of the path as what is supported The Abhidharmakosa602 explains [the path of accumulation] as the actions of all three doors [of body, speech, and mind] as well as studying and reflecting, while the Abhidharmasamuccaya603 explains it as also possessing [the prajfia] that arises from meditation and being what is suitable as the vessel for [both] the remedy-the clear realization of the realities-and the actual relinquish­ment of the factors to be relinquished. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.4.3. Signs and explanation of the term As for the signs of the path of accumulation just in general, the Abhidharmakosabh�ya says: You should understand that those whose body hairs stand on end and whose tears well up upon hearing the discourses that describe the shortcomings of sarpsara, the lack of a self, and the qualities of nirvaJ)a possess the roots of virtue that are conducive to liberation, just as one understands from the growing of a sprout in summer that there was a seed in the hollow of the threshing floor.604 Therefore, even if just a fraction of the roots of virtue that are motivated by the attitude of renunciation arises in one's mind stream, this represents the attainment of a part of the path of accumulation. As for the signs of the special path of accumulation, the Vrtti speaks of not being afraid of profound actuality and so on: The signs of the factors conducive to liberation, which illustrate them, are threefold-the characteristic of not being fainthearted and"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 291 anxious, {324} the characteristic of not being cowed and afraid, and the characteristic of not having any regret and fear in one's mind.605 You may wonder, \"Why are they called 'conducive to liberation'?\" The Vrtti says: Here liberation refers to the distinctive feature of freedom and since they benefit a part of this [liberation], they are conducive to liberation. 606 The Prasphutapada607 explains \"liberation\" as [the levels of] heat and so on, which are free from the very coarse karma and afflictions that propel one into the eight [states] without leisure and so on.608 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2. The [progressive] familiarization through which the spe­cial training is produced in the mind stream This has three parts: 1) The time of the arising of the special training 2) The persons who are the supports for its arising 3) The progressive familiarization of these persons 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. The time of the arising of the special training This has two parts: 1) The actual [time of its arising] 2) Rebutting [the flaw of] repetition 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. The actual [time of its arising] The time of the arising of the special training consists of the fourfold fac­tors conducive to penetration. Earlier, in the chapter on the knowledge of all aspects, these [factors] were already taught [by] primarily referring to the realizations in meditative equipoise. {325} Here, in the chapter on the com­plete training in all aspects, they are described [by] primarily referring to the training in benefiting others during subsequent attainment. Accordingly, this should be understood from the text [of the AA itself]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.1 .2. Rebutting [the flaw of] repetition It may be said, \"The teachings on the three [paths] of preparation, seeing, and familiarization in the first six dear realizations are repetitious, be they explic­itly or implicitly, because they are taught again and again, though there is no difference in their topics.\" The answer to this is found in the texts of master Haribhadra, who explains the following. The three dear realizations that are taught by way of the terms of said three paths in the first three chapters are [to be taken] literally. However, primarily, they refer to the path of preparation"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"292 Groundless Paths of realizing, in the manner of object generalities, that all aspects, paths, and bases are without arising; to the path of seeing of directly and newly realizing this; and to the path of familiarization of familiarizing with it through mak­ing oneself familiar with what one has seen. Since these refer to said three paths in dependence on the respective objects to be realized [by them] (bases, paths, and aspects), they are not repetitious. The three dear realizations that are taught through the terms of said three paths in the first three trainings are not fully qualified in the way they are described literally. Therefore, they are not repetitious [either]. [In this context,] the eighth, ninth, and tenth bhiimis (the three [pure bhiimis] as the bases of labeling) are taken to have three [levels] each (lesser, medium, and great) in terms of those with dull faculties and so on. [These three levels] are labeled through the three factors that are said three paths (the features with which they are labeled). Therefore, the three pure bhiimis represent the fully qualified complete training in all aspects and so on, while said three paths in terms of their literal [descriptions as the three levels of each one of the pure bhumis] represent nominal [forms of these three paths]. Hence, among the two [types of the first] three trainings, that is, their being or not being special, {326} the special ones are presented as [occurring] on the three pure bhiimis. Thus, this also represents the boundary line of [these trainings] being attained for the first time. As for the reason for [the three levels of each one of the pure bhftmis] being labeled [as said three paths], they are so labeled because the existence of the three [levels of] lesser, medium, and great on each one of these bhiimis corresponds to [the threefold progression that is represented by] said three paths. The purpose of such labeling is that they are labeled [in this way] in order to cut through the doubts of wondering, \"Since the bhiimis from the eighth one onward are the ones on which efforts have subsided, isn't it that, [from then onward,] the path is not generated in a progressive manner?\" and to teach that, [even on the eighth bhiimi and beyond, the path in fact] does arise progressively. Otherwise since it is explained that, in the context of the culminating [training] of [the level of] poised readiness of the path of prepara­tion, one abides in the flawlessness of bodhisattvas; that, in the context of heat [in AA IV.42a], \"all latencies are overcome\"; and that \"stability\" [in AA V.3] is explained as \"[all] dharmas of the three knowledges being completed,\" these would not be suitable as the fully qualified path of preparation. Also, if every­thing that is taught through the terms of said [three] paths represented these three paths in their fully qualified forms, one would not be able to rebut [the flaw of] repetition. [But] since the [paths as referring to the three levels of each one of the pure bhiimis] are nominal, there is no repetition. Though some assert that this does not represent [the approach of] master [Haribhadra]'s own texts, it is put forth as his very own position in his Vivrti.609"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 293 Also, the two subcommentaries [Prasphutapadii610 and Durbodhiilokii]611 on this [text] as well as [Prajfiakaramati's Abhisamayiilarrzkiiravrtti]pi1;1c}iirtha612 comment on this as being [the approach of Haribhadra's] own texts and do not teach it as the system of others. Through these and other [factors], it is clear that this is [indeed the approach of his] own texts. However, in this context, Tibetan scholars such as the great being [Ngog Lotsawa] say, \"There is no invalidation of the clear realizations of the [first] three trainings being said actual three paths. For the statements about dwelling in the flawlessness of bodhisattvas, {327} attaining the poised readiness for the dharma of nonarising, and so on [entail] the intentions of dwelling in the mere causes [of these states] and of being approximately concordant with them. Otherwise, if the explanation on the generation of the wisdom of the knowl­edge of all aspects [referred to its being generated] in a direct manner, one would become a buddha in the second moment of the eighth bhumi. But if it referred to [its being generated] in an indirect manner, the same applies to the above. Since venerable [Maitreya] explains that the three knowledges are the objects and that the four trainings are the causes, to explain the three knowledges and the trainings by way of separating them such that [the former exist] up through the seventh bhftmi and so on and that [the latter exist] from the eighth bhftmi onward is not the intention of this treatise.\" It is very difficult to give an answer to this. Also, though said [three] paths in the [first] six clear realizations are not referred to as being or not being fully qualified, their being described under the three knowledges represents the object of studying and reflecting, while their description under the [first] three trainings is given by way of practicing them. Said paths in the first [category-the three knowledges-are described] for the sake of defining, in due order, the three knowledges that are what is to be attained, what is to be generated, and what is to be relinquished. [In due order,] the paths in the latter [category-the first three trainings-] entail the three dis­tinct features of [being cultivated] for the sake of gaining mastery, representing the manner of gaining [such mastery], and acquainting oneself with it again. Since it is sufficient to rebut [the flaw of] repetition in general and for each one [of the first six clear realizations] in this way, with regard to this topic it is rea­sonable to follow Aryavimuktisena.613 {328} 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.

I. 1 .2.2. I. The irreversible persons Though the siitras only speak of bodhisattvas in general, venerable [Maitreya] takes their intention as [referring to] those on the path of preparation up through the path of familiarization. As for those on the path of accumula­tion, in general the sfttra [passages] on the factors conducive to liberation say that, on the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, without deterioration or regression, one will awaken to perfect enlightenment. Also, [bodhisattvas on the medium path of accumulation with] the goldlike generation of bodh­icitta, due to its existence, possess irreversibility, but since they lack the signs of having attained this [irreversibility], [these bodhisattvas] are not presented [as irreversible]. You may wonder, \"Are those who dwell on these three paths distinguished through their different faculties or not?\" Since it is said in most slitras and great treatises that, from the eighth bhlimi onward, [bodhisattvas] are irre­versible in all respects, they must have sharp faculties to attain the signs of irreversibility on the level of an ordinary being. For if the two [kinds of bodhisattvas] with medium and dull [faculties] also attained [such signs] on this level, what was explained above for the eighth bhlimi would not be rea­sonable. Therefore, what is presented [here] is that those with dull faculties do not attain said signs even on the seven impure bhftmis. [However,] though they do not attain these signs, it is impossible for them to fall [back] into the hinayana once they have attained the bhlimis because {329} it is impossible for mahayana noble ones to regress from the generation of ultimate bodhicitta. \"But the same goes for the eighth bhlimi.\" There is no flaw. For below the eighth bhlimi, the clinging to \"me\" is not exhausted and, as long as it exists, mental states of self-cherishing [still] operate. Therefore, the mere condition for merging with one's own welfare is close by, whereas it does not exist from the eighth [bhlimi] onward. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2. The meaning of\"irreversible\" [AA IV.45d] says, \"Do not turn away from perfect enlightenment.\" Therefore, not to turn away from what makes one attain buddhahood is the meaning of that from which one does not turn away. Since all persons of the three yanas will become buddhas in the end, [being irreversible] does not refer to just that [fact], but to what makes them attain [buddhahood] in an uninterrupted manner. Therefore, it is certain that one does not even temporarily revert to the extremes of [satpsaric] existence and peace. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.3. The signs of irreversibility These consist of the twenty, sixteen, and eight signs (such as turning away from form and so on) [on the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization,"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 295 respectively]. [Bodhisattvas] realize that [all phenomena] from form up through the knowledge of all aspects are without nature. Therefore, it is the great compassion marked by the prajfta of putting an end to clinging to the real existence of these [phenomena] that represents the two very stable streams of means and prajfta. One should know that [these two] represent the primary signs, while the others are mere facets [of them]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.4. The manner in which the signs point to irreversibility From seeing that [certain bodhisattvas] are endowed with certain signs in their subsequent attainments one infers that it is certain that unsurpassable enlightenment will arise [in them] in an uninterrupted manner. [For exam­ple,] when one sees that the collection of the causes of a sprout is complete in its number, {330} one is certain that the sprout can arise from it. Likewise, when irreversible persons see that their own mind streams are endowed with the primary signs that were explained above or the other signs that are con­nected with them, there arises the mental state of thinking, \"Now it is certain that I, without being interrupted by any other yanas, will attain unsurpass­able enlightenment.\" Also, when other persons see that [said bodhisattvas] are endowed with the physical and verbal behaviors explained in the siitras, are acquainted with said [behaviors] for a long time, and are able to exam­ine these behaviors, based on the scriptures, [those other persons] infer from said [behaviors] that said [bodhisattvas] are irreversible. It is merely [what is thus inferred] that, from the perspective of such [other persons], is explained as the signs [of irreversibility], but it is not suitable to make these [signs] into a presentation of reasons614 for which the three modes are ascertained through valid cognition. [For] yogins who know the mind streams of others just as they are do not need any proofs through reasons, whereas those with inferior realizations are mistaken if they infer [irreversibility] from just the physical and verbal conventional [expressions of others]. Also, there is no certainty that they do not mistake such particular conventional [expressions] for [being true signs of] the realizations of irreversible [bodhisattvas] because, for persons [with inferior realizations], the inner realizations of irreversible [bodhisattvas] are something very hidden. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5. Explaining [some] topics that elaborate on the signs This has three parts: I) [Elaborations on the signs] of those on the path of preparation 2) [Elaborations on the signs] of those on the path of seeing 3) Elaborations on the signs of those on the path of familiarization"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"296 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.1. [Elaborations on the signs] of those on the path of preparation As fo r the five obscurations in \"not being associated with the five obscura­tions at the level of heat,\" the obstructions of the [pure] skandha of ethics are the two obscurations of striving fo r sense pleasures in a craving manner {331} and the malicious mind of hating others. The obstruction of the skan­dha of prajfta consists of the obscurations of sleepiness (mind withdrawing from615its objects) and dullness (which makes the mind unworkable). [These two are counted as] one. The obstructions of the skandha of samadhi are the obscurations of agitation ([mind] not being at peace with regard to beauti­ful objects) and regret (which appears in the fo rm of something being stuck in the mind). [These two are also counted as] one. In addition, there is the obscuration of doubt about the [four] realities. These five obscurations exist in the desire realm. As fo r sleepiness and dullness as well as agitation and regret existing as two [pairs], the reasons fo r taking them as one [obscuration, respectively,] are that they are explained in this way because they respec­tively have the same antagonistic factors or remedies, nourishing factors, and functions. The remedy fo r [the two in] the first pair is the illuminating discrimination [of prajfta on the level of heat]. Their nourishing factors are five-weariness, dislike, yawning, drowsiness after a meal,616 and languidness of mind. Their function is that both [sleep and dullness] make the mind inter­nally languid. The remedy for [the two in] the latter pair is calm abiding. Their nourishments are fo ur-the [three] thoughts about one's close relatives, one's country, and immortality, and the recollection of one's past entertainments and enjoyments. Their function is that both [agitation and regret] make the mind unpeaceful. As [the Abhidharmakosa says] : [Among] the obscurations in the desire realm, since two [pairs] Have the same antagonistic factors, nourishing factors, and functions, They are [counted as] one.

It is in these senses that they are presented as faculties.

As fo r the five of confidence and so on, though most [schol­ars] explain them as being mundane, the reason for their not definitely being so is as before. Among these [faculties], six are imputedly [existent] and the remaining are substantially existent. Both the male and fe male [faculties] are imputed onto a part of the body sense fa culty; the life [faculty], onto the state that is the continuum of the skandhas; and the last three, onto the factors of confidence and so on. Therefore, they are not separate substances. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.2.2.1.1.2.

In terms of the analogous fo ur [features] with regard to nirviiQ.a, [the purified fa culties] are respectively definite as being five, one, one, and one. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.2.2.1.1.3. The boundary lines of the last three According to Abhidharmakosa [11.9ab], [the set ot] the nine [faculties] that arise in their uncontaminated fo rms on the path of seeing (the five such as confidence, [physical] pleasure, mental pleasure, equanimity, and the mental [faculty]) represents the fa culty that makes one know everything unknown {334} or makes everything known. Likewise, [the same sets of nine] on the path of familiarization and the path of nonlearning respectively represent the faculty of knowing everything and the faculty of being endowed with know­ing everything or guarding the knowledge of everything. [Thus,] all three [faculties] are presented as being supramundane and nothing but uncontami­nated. The Vrttf'19 also agrees with this. According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya,620 the first one [of these three fa c­ulties] is presented as [consisting ot] the path of preparation and the [first] fifteen moments of the path of seeing; the second one, as all paths of learning"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 299 fr om the sixteenth [moment of the path of seeing] onward; and the third one, as the path of nonlearning. As for these two [explanations], since the fo llowers of the Abhidharmakosa assert that said fifteen moments are the path of seeing, while the sixteenth is the path of familiarization, except fo r identifying or not identifying the boundary line of the first [faculty as its starting] from the path of preparation, they are alike. In the [Indian] commentaries on the Abhidharmasamuccaya,621 mental displeasure is also counted as [belonging to] the bases of designation of the first two [faculties]. In the [Prajfiaparamitasutra in] Twenty-jive Thousand [Lines],622 the confidence and so on of persons who are learners who do not have clear realizations are explained as the first [faculty]; the confidence and so on of learning persons who are endowed with knowing everything, as the second one; and the confidence and so on of nonlearning persons (arhats, pratyeka­buddhas, bodhisattvas, and tathagatas), as the third one. As fo r the meanings of these, the Brhaffikd explains that the first one refers to sravakas who are approaching stream-enterers and bodhisattvas [on the level of] engagement through aspiration; the second one, to abiders in the fruition of a stream­enterer and bodhisattvas on the first bhlimi and above; and the third one, to sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, bodhisattvas on the tenth bhfuni, {335} and tathagatas. 623 The ViniScayasa111grahat:�i explains the first [faculty] as the path of prepara­tion, the second one as the path of seeing; and the third one as the path of nonlearning. However, since it explains that the first one has both contami­nated and uncontaminated [elements, in terms of the hinayana] , though it is presented as starting from the path of preparation, it refers to [the path of preparation] up through the [first] fifteen moments [of the path of seeing]. In terms of the mahayana, the first one is explained as [the level of] engagement through aspiration; the second one as the ten bhlimis; and the third one as [the fa culty] that is possessed by tathagatas. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.2.2.1.2.

The manner of their being ceased in which realms In the desire [realm] the fa ctors to be ceased are the fo urteen afflicted facul­ties. In the fo rm [realm] [there are] ten [of these to be ceased] since male and fe male [faculties], [physical] suffering, and mental displeasure do not exist [there] . In the fo rmless [realm], among these, the five [faculties] that possess fo rm, [physical] pleasure, and mental pleasure are missing. Therefore, since there are [only] the life [faculty], the mental [faculty], and equanimity, it is those that are ceased. As fo r the supports of the faculties and the objects of the fa culties, in the desire [realm] all [of them] exist. In the fo rm [realm] smell and taste are missing. In the fo rmless [realm], {336} among the objects of the fa culties, [there are] only phenomena. As fo r the supports of the faculties, the Abhidharmakosa [says] : Here the mind stream relies On [being in the same] class and the life [faculty).624 Thus, both the large commentaries [by Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra] and the [Abhisamayala'!1kiira]varttika625say that it is being in the concordant type [of beings] and the life [faculty] that are ceased [in the fo rmless realm]. However since it is [only] the assertion of the Vaibha�ikas [that the beings in the fo rmless realm] rely on these two, it is refuted in the Abhidharmakosabha�ya. A self and what is mine exist in all three realms. Some assert that the objects do not cease, but that merely the clinging to the subject ceases. However, with regard to a self and what is mine, it is clinging [that ceases], whereas with regard to the remaining [factors], both clinging and the natures of the con­taminated fa culties and so on cease. For the commentaries also say that the fa culties and so on cease and that, once the path of seeing is attained, all skan­dhas, dhatus, and ayatanas of the lower realms are relinquished.626 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.2.3. [Whether the signs of irreversibility on the path of seeing refer to meditative equipoise or subsequent attainment] You may wonder, \"Is it meditative equipoise or subsequent attainment that becomes said signs?\" Since [the signs] appear as apprehender and appre­hended, but have the aspect of lacking clinging to these [two] , they are pure. Since they consist of mental states after having risen from medita­tive equipoise, they are mundane. They are the sixteen physical and verbal"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 301 conventional [expressions] that represent the results which are approximately concordant with the focal objects and aspects of meditative equipoise itself and serve as objects that are realized by other persons. You may wonder, \"But this contradicts the explanation that the signs consist of the very wisdom of meditative equipoise [that is referred to as] 'such sixteen moments.'\" There is no flaw. {337} Once these sixteen moments that consist of poised readi­nesses and cognitions are attained in a complete manner, any discriminating notions of form and so on are put to an end and one gives rise to the [sixteen] conventional [expressions] up through giving away one's life for the sake of the dharma. Therefore, the results are labeled with the names of their causes. Thus, [there are] three factors in terms of explaining the sixteen behaviors during subsequent attainment as signs byway of labeling them with the names of the [respectively co�responding] sixteen wisdoms of meditative equipoise. Among these [factors], [the first one is] the reason for labeling [said behaviors as signs]. Among similarity and connection as the two reasons [for labeling, here] connection is taken as the reason because [said behaviors as the signs] are the results of meditative equipoise. [Secondly,] as for the purpose of labeling [them as signs], the physical and verbal conventional [expressions] of noble yogins are [displayed] for the sake of making [others] understand that [said expressions] are definitely concordant in all aspects with the [respectively corresponding] realizations of meditative equipoise. \"Is it certain that these two are concordant?\" The Subahupariprccha[tantra] says: Though their nature is free from attachment and hatred, They display something like attachment for attached sentient beings And, in order to guide the wicked, they display anger for the angry­To those who dwell in supreme enlightenment, I pay homage. Accordingly, except for [bodhisattvas] displaying discordant [behaviors] under the influence, or for the sake, of the needs to guide certain sentient beings who possess attachment and hatred, all others [of their behaviors] are certain [to be concordant with their realizations]. [Thirdly,] as for the invalidation of the explicit [statement], if it were not the case that [certain behaviors during] subsequent attainment are explained as signs by way of labeling [said behaviors during] subsequent attainment with the names of the sixteen [corresponding] wisdoms [in meditative equipoise], but if the literal actual realizations of meditative equipoise {338} were explained as said signs, it would follow that, from the perspective of other persons in the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing, [said signs] are not signs that instill trust [in them] about [the person in question being an] irreversible [bodhisattva]"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"302 Groundless Paths because [these \"signs\" are not signs of the realization in meditative equipoise, but] are the actual meditative equipoise of someone on the path of seeing. There is entailment [of the predicate by the reason] because the moments of cogni­tions and poised readinesses in the mind stream of a noble yogin are personally experienced by said yogin, but are not experienced by others. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.5.3. Elaborations on the signs of those on the path of familiarization The signs of [a bodhisattva] who is irreversible on the path of familiariza­tion consist of the eightfold profound nature of phenomena. Though these are not contradictory ultimately, from the perspective of those who possess clinging the meanings of said [eight profundities] (such as arising) are estab­lished through [seeming to be internally] mutually exclusive.627 Thus since they appear as if what is contradictory is combined [in them], they are pro­fo und. These eight, which are the subsequent conventional [expressions] that are approximately concordant with the [corresponding] realizations in medi­tative equipoise, are the signs of [bodhisattvas] who are irreversible on the path of familiarization, just as it was explained for those on the path of seeing. You may wonder, \"How can those on the path of familiarization realize these [eight profundities] as not being contradictory?\" They realize them by way of attaining the liberations that are inconceivable fo r those who entertain any clinging to extremes. 628 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.

Therefore, since satp.sara and nirvaQ.a are not concep­tualized as being different in terms of what is to be rejected and what is to be adopted, respectively, this is the equality of [satp.saric] existence and peace.

(1) The skill in means of overcoming the enemies of the fo ur maras and the two levels [of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] is to transcend the phenomena that obstruct the training. [The Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha says:] Likewise, at that time, skillful bodhisattvas Give rise to compassion fo r all realms of sentient beings, And, having overcome the fo ur maras and the two levels, They always dwell in the supreme samadhi and do not touch enlightenment. 634 Thus, [this skill in means] is described through the example of a person trained in all arts and skills without exception going to a wilderness and then {341} overcoming all his opponents.635 The Vrtti says [that it refers] to bodhi­sattvas causing the sentient beings who are cared for by them to transcend [all] obstructions.636 In this [context], if one undertakes a brief critical analysis of the fo ur maras, they are to be understood through three points: a) Identifying their natures b) The reasons fo r presenting them as fo ur c) The manner of their being presented on which [levels] a) As fo r identifying their natures, this corresponds to the Sravakabhumi [saying] : Here the mara of the skandhas consists of the five appropriating skandhas. The mara of the afflictions consists of the afflictions"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 305 that are experienced in the three realms. The mara of death is what causes the time of specific sentient beings dying away from [living within] specific classes of sentient beings. The devaputramara con­sist of powerful devaputras born in the desire realm approaching one in order to create the obstacles for, and the distractions from, one's making effort in virtue in order to transcend the maras of the skandhas, the afflictions, and the lord of death. This is called \"the �evaputramara. \"637 b) As fo r the reasons for presenting them as four, you may wonder, \"Why are they presented as four maras?\" It is in terms of dying that they are presented as four, that is, in what fo rm one dies, through what one dies, the nature of dying, and what causes one to not transcend dying. [Thus, in due order, one dies] in the form of the five skandhas that have arisen and come into being. Through the afflictions one takes rebirth in a next life and dies after having been born [there]. {342} [The mara of death] stops the life faculty of sentient beings. [The devaputramara] causes one's efforts in order to transcend death to either complelety lack the power of transcending it or to transcend it [only] after a long time. c) As for the manner of [the maras] being presented on which [levels], the mara of the afflictions does not exist from the eighth bhumi onward. In terms of dying under the influence of karma and afflictions, the mara of death does not exist from the first bhii.mi onward. However, since the dying and transit­ing of a mental body does not come to an end until buddhahood is attained, the mara of death and the mara of the skandhas [exist] until buddhahood is attained. Since the devaputramara creates obstacles for transcending said three [maras], it exists for as long as these three operate. The Uttaratantra speaks of this as what establishes the permanence of the dharmakaya of the sage, [saying]: By virtue of the mara of death not stirring Within the attainment of the state of immortality and peace .. ,638 One should understand that the latencies of these [maras] are overcome together simultaneously with the attainment of enlightenment. The greater Brhattlka says: Through relinquishing the contaminations of desire the devaputramara is overcome. Through relinquishing the contami­nations of becoming the mara of death is overcome. Through relinquishing the contaminations of ignorance the mara of the"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"306 Groundless Paths afflictions is overcome. Through relinquishing the contaminations of views the mara of the skandhas is overcome. Being victorious over the fo ur maras is called \"the termination of contamination. \"639 [However,] this does not accord with other [sources]. The explanation that [this first] training [in skill in means] overcomes the fo ur maras [entails] the intention of [its doing so in a] coarse and partial [manner]. {343} (2) The skill in means of abiding in nonabiding means that [bodhisattvas], through having familiarized with all phenomena as being equality, do not abide in the extremes of satp.sara and nirvi\\J).a in the manner of clinging [to them. The Prajnaparamitasa,cayagatha says]: A bird flying in space has no abode-It neither abides in it, nor does it fall to the ground. Likewise, bodhisattvas who engage in the doors to liberation Neither experience nirvi\\J).a nor engage in characteristics.640 (3) [The skill in means of bodhisattvas] accomplishing aspiration prayers is to promote the welfare of others to be guided in precise accordance with what was projected through the fo rce of their past aspiration prayers, just as they have made them. Thus, through donning the armor for the welfare of others in all respects, they do not manifest the true end without having completed [all] roots of virtue. [The Prajfiaparamitasa,cayagatha says]: For example, a person trained in archery shoots an arrow into space And then others in [quick] succession so that they lift up the notch [of the first one] So that there is no chance for the first arrow to fall to the ground­It will [only] fall to the ground if that person wishes it so. Likewise, those who engage in the supreme paramita of prajfia And use prajfia, means, power, and magical powers, For as long as their roots of virtue are not completed, Will not attain the supreme emptiness.641 (4) As for [the skill in means that is] uncommon in comparison with sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, through the power of mentally not abandoning any one among all sentient beings [bodhisattvas] become very familiar with all austerities of not manifesting the true end. [The siitras say]:"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 307 You should understand that they, until they attain the knowledge of all aspects, do not manifest the true end somewhere in between.642 {344} (5) [The skill in means of] not clinging and not being attached to any of all phenomena consists of the purity in the pure dharmas (such as the dhyanas and the factors concordant [with enlightenment]) and of being without rel­ishing them. [The sfitras say]: At that time, bodhisattva mahasattvas are endowed with the dharmas concordant with enlightenment. Until awakening into unsurpassable perfect enlightenment, they will not regress. ( 6) As for [the skill in means of] not observing, through having completely familiarized with the door to liberation that is emptiness [bodhisattvas] relinquish observing a self of sentient beings and [observing anything] as a phenomenon. [The sfitras say]: For a long time these sentient beings kept engaging in the four mis­takennesses. They kept engaging in the notion of permanence, the notion of happiness, the notion of a self, and the notion of what is pleasant. It is for their sake that I shall engage in enlightenment. (7) As for [the skill in means of] having terminated characteristics, through having completely familiarized with the door to liberation that is signlessness [bodhisattvas] abide in the relinquishment of clinging to characteristics with regard to form up through the knowledge of all aspects. [The sfitras say]: They think, \"For a long time these sentient beings kept engaging in characteristics ... It is for their sake that I shall engage in enlighten­ment so that the flaws of these sentient beings become annihilated.\" (8) As for [the skill in means of] having terminated aspiration prayers or their nonexistence, through having completely familiarized with the door to libera­tion that is wishlessness [bodhisattvas] abide in the relinquishment of the joy of craving for the forms of sentient beings up through the knowledge of all aspects. {345} [The sfitras say]: They think, \"For a long time these sentient beings kept engaging in aspiration prayers. Thus, they delighted in [becoming] Indra, Brahma, world protectors, and cakravartins ... It is for their sake"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"308 Groundless Paths that I shall ... teach the dharma by all means so that the flaws of the aspiration prayers of these sentient beings become annihilated.\" (9) As fo r [the skill in means that is] the sign of, or points to, the irreversibility as explained above, [the siitras say]: \"How can they ... through realizing emptiness and the true end, not perceive these two so that they attain the five results? How can they familiarize with the mother without perceiving signlessness ... and nonbeing?\" Upon being questioned thus by other bodhi­sattvas, [irreversible] bodhisattvas, being skilled in expressing that one must mentally engage in the dharmas of irreversibility, would answer by prescribing, \"You should mentally engage solely in emp­tiness. Likewise, you should mentally engage solely in signlessness, wishlessness, what cannot be fo rmed, nonarising, noncessation, and nonbeing. And yet, you should not abandon any of all sen­tient beings.\" In that case, Subhiiti, you should understand that these yogins who are bodhisattva mahasattvas were prophesied by the buddha bhagavans to [attain] unsurpassable perfect enlighten­ment. If you wonder why, [it is because] these [bodhisattvas] {346} express, prescribe, and differentiate in this way what irreversible bodhisattva mahasattvas should acquaint themselves with. If they ... prescribe, \"You shouid not acquaint yourself with emptiness ... and the dharmas concordant with enlightenment and thus not fo cus on all sentient beings,\" you should understand that these bodhi­sattvas were not prophesied to [attain] unsurpassable enlightenment. (10) [The skill in means of] being unlimited refers to [being skilled] through knowing all objects of the skill in means of great bodhisattvas. [The siitras say]: The bodhisattva mahasattvas who were prophesied to [attain] the level of irreversible wisdom in this way give an answer in this fa sh­ion. You should understand that those who give an answer in this fa shion have given rise to splendid roots of virtue. As fo r the manner in which these ten [trainings in] skill in means are to be practiced, the position of Aryavimuktisena is as above. However, the Vivrtz'643 and the Prajfiiipradipii[vali],644 by taking the ten skills in means as objects, assert that they refer to knowing the [appropriate] times and the in [appropriate] times fo r manifesting [these ten objects] in order to guide sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 309 The familiarization with these three trainings [in equality, purifying the buddha realm, and skill in means] through the [psychophysical] supports of irreversible [bodhisattvas] is attained according to the order of the text. Therefore, these three [trainings] are presented [as existing] from the path of preparation onward. If this is finely analyzed in terms of what is primary, they must be presented [as existing] even from the path of accumulation onward. For these three [trainings respectively] consist of the triad of fa miliarizing with phenomena as being free from reference points, purifying [buddha] realms, and maturing sentient beings, and if [bodhisattvas] did not perform these three, they would not be bodhisattva&. {347} It may be said, \"But ordi­nary beings do not possess the training in skill in means. If they possessed it, they would have to possess the first training [too], but they do not possess the [first one] because they are not endowed with [the ability to] overcome the fo ur maras.\" Since [the training in] skill in means is [the training] in know­ing the [appropriate] times and the in[ appropriate] times, ordinary beings do possess it. Also, it is not necessarily the case that one does not possess skill in means if one does not possess [the ability to] overcome the fo ur maras, just as it is not the case that, even if one lacks the knowledge of all aspects, one [must] lack any one of the eight clear realizations.645 Not clinging to objects, one knows the true reality of knowable objects. Not clinging to mind, one gives rise to the types of realization of the three knowledges. With means and prajfia being in union, one does not fall into the extremes of [sa�psaric] existence and peace. The practice of the children of the victors is explained as this.

The culmination of heat The culmination of the path of preparation is described by way of its being indicated through the twelve signs of attainment. These consist of the six signs that occur in dreams, {348} the two signs that occur in both dreams and the waking state, and the fo ur signs that occur in the waking state. Among the six signs in dreams, there are the two main signs of fa miliarity with the yoga of means and prajiia, the two signs of stable familiarity with the refuges and their power, the one sign of recognizing dreams as dreams, and the one sign of purifying one's own [buddha] realm. Among these, the first two are (1) to regard all phenomena as being dreamlike and (2) not to give rise to the mindsets of delighting in the levels of §ravakas .and pratyekabud­dhas or the three realms. The second two are to see (3) tathagatas teaching the dharma and ( 4) showing miraculous displays of their miraculous powers. The third one (5) consists of (a) seeing something frightful and so on in dreams and, through this condition, recognizing them as dreams and (b) the arising of a mindset that, even after having woken up, [makes one] teach that the three realms are dreamlike. The fo urth one ( 6) is to see the beings in the lower realms and, through this condition, remember to relinquish the lower realms in the realm in which oneself becomes a buddha. As for the signs that occur in both dreams and the waking state, they are the two of (7) pacifying, through uttering aspiration prayers with true words, fires that burn down villages and so on and (8) releasing other sentient beings that were seized by nonhuman beings. These are the two signs in terms of power, that is, pacifying harm by [causes] that are and are not sentient beings, respec­tively. In this context, there are the fo ur possibilities of being an irreversible [bodhisattva] and fire {349} being pacified [as above] , not being an irreversible [bodhisattva] and fire not being pacified, being an irreversible [bodhisat­tva] , but fire not being completely pacified due to experiencing the karmic remainders of having abandoned the dharma, and not being an irreversible [bodhisattva] , but fire being pacified through the power of maras and one then becoming conceited through this. The same goes for the fo llowing [signs] . As fo r the fo ur signs that occur in the waking state, they consist of (9) relying on inner and outer spiritual friends who overpower maras and evil companions, (10) training in prajfiaparamita in all aspects due to wishing to"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 311 complete the roots of virtue, (11) not being attached to any afflicted or puri­fied phenomena through regarding them all as being void, and (12) being close to buddha enlightenment through engaging in prajfiiiparamitii in the manner of not engaging in fo rm and so on. These fo ur are the signs in terms of the cause fo r training in the path, the object of that training, the manner of training, and the benefit of training, respectively. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.1 .2. The culmination of peak This is described by way of its being indicated through the manner of merit increasing. They consist of the eight [kinds of] merit that are primarily exter­nal and the eight [kinds of] merit that are primarily internal. The eight that are primarily external are ( 1) someone during [the culmination of] peak mentally engaging in the actuality of the mother and teaching it to others represent­ing a greater increase in merit than worshipping a number of buddhas that equals the sentient beings in a trichiliocosm ([consisting of] Jambudvipa and so on) and dedicating these roots of virtue, (2) not being separated from mentally engaging in prajfiiipiiramitii throughout day and night, (3) attain­ing the poised readiness of not being afraid of the dharma that is free from reference points, {350} (4) realizing that the causal and fruitional dharmas of enlightenment are not observable, (5} engaging in the actuality of the mother of the noble ones being a more eminent virtue than the sentient beings of Jambudvipa attaining the ten virtues, the [eight] meditative absorptions, and the [four] immeasurables, (6) [bodhisattvas] going to all god realms for the welfare of the gods and so on as well as the gods approaching [these bodhi­sattvas] fo r the sake of protection, (7} overpowering all maras through never being separated from mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects, and (8) having respect fo r other bodhisattvas that is equal to [the one fo r] the Buddha, the teacher. The eight that are primarily internal are (9) not being reborn under the influence of the dhyiinas and fo rm[less absorptions] despite being absorbed in them, (10) the buddha disposition having become special by way of the sriivaka and pratyekabuddha dispositions perishing, (11) the power of the causes for attaining buddhahood (such as generating bodhicitta) having become supe­rior (these [last] two referring to the two [kinds of the mahayana] disposition having become superior, or being [divisions in terms of] those who possess the disposition and the disposition [itself]), (12) pacifying the states of mind that are the antagonistic fa ctors of the six piiramitiis, (13} not clinging to [any­thing] from fo rm up through the knowledge of all aspects, (14) knowing that all piiramitiis are included in the mother and thus training in her, (15) attain­ing all consummate trainings, and (16) being close to perfect enlightenment through being fr ee from views about the apprehended and so on."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"312 Groundless Paths 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.1.3. The culmination of poised readiness This is described by way of its being indicated through the manner of having mastered, and attained stability in, the realization that has increased through peak. { 351} It is twofold-( 1) the stability of realization (one's own welfare) and (2) the stability of compassion (the welfare of others). (1) means to attain the stable realization of the respectively suitable ones among the thirty dharmas from generating bodhicitta up through the path of seeing free from the two extremes that were explained in the [first three] chapters on the three omni­sciences. (2) means that one, at that point, through the power of being skilled in means and for the sake of not falling into peace (one's own welfare), mani­fests great compassion and does not abandon the welfare of sentient beings. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.1.4. The culmination of the supreme dharma This is described by way of its 'being indicated through the mind being set­tled and undistracted toward anything other than the realization that has been stabilized through \"stability\" [(the level of poised readiness)]. [The Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha] says: As for rejoicing from the depths of one's heart in the generation of the mind Of engaging in irreversible supreme enlightenment, It is possible to measure the Merus in a trichiliocosm through weighing them on a scale, But such is not the case for the virtue of said rejoicing.646 [The larger prajfi.aparamita slitras ]647 take the examples of measuring the earth mai}.Qalas of a trichiliocosm (such as the four continents) on a scale and scooping up the water drops [in a trichiliocosm] with the [finely split] tip of a hair. They say that it is possible to measure these, but that one is not able to measure the accumulations of merit and wisdom of rejoicing, within one-pointed samadhi, in the roots of virtue of the four [kinds of] bodhisattvas engaging in the six paramitas. The four [kinds of] bodhisattvas are the four bodhisattvas who first enter the [maha]yana, {352} engage in [bodhisattva] conduct, are irreversible, and are separated by [only] a single birth [from attaining buddhahood]. [There are] also the ways of asserting these four [kinds] as those who dwell in the four realizations [of the paths] of seeing and familiarization that are the remedies for the four conceptions, or as respec­tively being [the bodhisattvas] during the four culminations [of the path] of preparation, [the level of] engagement through aspiration and the seven impure bhlimis, the three pure bhlimis, and the tenth bhlimi.

The nature of the conceptions Their nature is twofold-not observing the objects of engagement [of bod­hisattvas] as characteristics and observing their objects of withdrawal as characteristics. In due order, these refer to [the nine in V.S-9] such as \"nature\" and [the nine in V. 10-12] such as \"falling into [sa�p.saric) existence and peace.\" Their aspects are as follows. Through desiring to adopt the dharmas of bodhisattvas and buddhas, {353} one clings to them as being \"something apprehended that is to be adopted.\" Through desiring to reject the dharmas of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, one clings to them as being \"something apprehended that is to be rejected.\" In due order, these are the two concep­tions about the apprehended in terms of engagement and withdrawal. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.2. Their being taught as antagonistic fa ctors These two represent antagonistic factors of the culmination [of the path] of seeing because they are factors to be relinquished. For example, [in this"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"314 Groundless Paths regard,] they are just like the afflictions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.3. Their divisions Each one of these two conceptions has nine [divisions] since they are divided in terms of there being nine objects [for them]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4. Establishing them as mistaken It is to be understood that these eighteen [conceptions] (two times nine) have the specific nature of clinging to their objects as being something that they are not because their specific objects appear in mistaken manners. Just as one, caused by the ingestion of datura, may engage in [the attempt to] pluck golden needles from the sky, [these conceptions] engage in the entities that are the objects of their clinging in a way of being disconnected from them, which is due to these objects not existing in the ways in which [said concep­tions] cling [to them]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.2. Their remedies [The remedies] are nine each. First, the nine remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of engagement are as follows.649 (1) The remedy for the conceptions about a nature is the realization that [everything] from the mother up through the knowledge of all aspects is void. (2) The rem­edy for the conceptions about the disposition is to not think about being close to, or being distant from, both the knowledge of all aspects and the bh'ii mis, just as one [can]not think about being close to, or being distant from, certain [parts of] space. (3) The remedy for the conceptions about the perfect accom­plishment of the path is to not think about being close to inferior paths or being distant from supreme ones, just as an illusory person does not think about being close to, or being distant from, the illusionist or the spectators. {354} (4) The remedy for the conceptions about unmistakenness about the focal object is to not think about being close to, or being distant from, the focal objects of the two paths [of the mahayana and the hinayana, respectively], just as a reflection does not think about being close to [the object] through which it arose or being distant from what is not [said object]. (5) The rem­edy for the conceptions about antagonistic factors and remedies is to think that, in prajiiaparamita, the pair of being beautiful and being ugly does not exist, just as the Tathagata does not have any mental states about [anything] being beautiful or being ugly. ( 6) The remedy for the conceptions about one's own realization is that, just as the Tathagata has relinquished all conceptions, bodhisattvas relinquish them too. (7) The remedy fo r the conceptions about being an agent who promotes the welfare of others is to not cling to oneself"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 315 and others as being two, just as the emanations of the Tathagata do not cling to being close to, or being distant from, perfect enlightenment and the knowledge of all aspects. (8) The remedy for the conceptions about the activ­ity for the welfare of others is that, just as the emanations of the Tathagata accomplish the welfare of sentient beings without thinking, the mother too promotes [their welfare] in this manner. (9) The remedy for the conceptions about the result [of said activity] is to not think about what is to be attained through familiarizing with the mother fo r which purpose, just as [a machine in] the form of a woman created by an engineer does not think about which purpose it was created for. Second, the nine remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of withdrawal are as follows. ( 1) Through the examples of the sun and the moon performing their activities on the four continents and the disposi­tion of a cakravartin being mastered through the seven precious items, {355} in due order it is taught that one, through the five paramitas (such as gener­osity) that are not separated from prajfia and compassion, does not fall into the two extremes and gains mastery over what is to be attained (this is the opposite of inferior realizations). (2) Through the example of rogues finding or not finding a chance [to molest] a woman who is not protected or pro­tected by a husband, it is taught that maras assail or do not assail the five [paramitas] that are separated or not separated from the sixth one (this is the difference between possessing and not possessing the inner and outer men­tors). (3) Through the example of [a warrior] with his armor and weapons complete not being defeated and vanquished by enemies, it is taught that the five [paramitas] that are not separated from the sixth one are not assailed by maras and vanquish all antagonistic factors (this is the opposite of the aspects of the path being incomplete). (4) Through the example of the command­ers of fo rtresses approaching a cakravartin in order to pay their homage and services, [it is taught that] the five [paramitas] that are not separated from the sixth one approach the knowledge of all aspects (this is the opposite of not having attained mastery over realization, but [trying to] approach [the knowledge of all aspects] through other conditions). (5) Through the example of the tributaries of the Ganga being absorbed by it and thus flowing toward the ocean, [it is taught that], through the power of the sixth [paramita], the [other] five also proceed toward the knowledge of all aspects (this is the oppo­site of a wrong aim). (6) Through the example of the right and left hands, respectively, doing and not doing work, it is taught that the sixth and the [other] five [paramitas], respectively, are like that (this is the difference between limited and fully complete paths). (7) Through the example of the waters of all big and small rivers becoming of one taste once they arrive in the ocean, it is taught that the five [paramitas] that are embraced by the sixth one"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"316 Groundless Paths {356} are of one taste as omniscience once they arrive at the knowledge of all aspects (this is the opposite of various fruitions). (8) Through the example of the precious wheel [of a cakravartin] causing his armies to march and stop, it is taught that the sixth [paramita] causes the [other] five to proceed toward, and stop at, the knowledge of all aspects (this is the remedy fo r being ignorant about remaining and engaging [in the knowledge of all aspects]). (9) Just as the seven precious things of a cakravartin precede his armies, it is taught that the sixth [paramita] precedes the [other] five and that the five follow this sixth one (this is the opposite of going anywhere else after [having attained] one's own fruition). 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.

Also, the clinging of noble ones does not necessarily con­sist of conceptions about imputations. For they possess the clinging to 'me' because [the notion] 'me' occurs in them too.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.1.2.1 .2.2. The answer to that That ordinary beings understand all phenomena as being identityless means that they, by virtue of mentally engaging in aspiring [for true reality], realize any identity as being a mere imputation. As for the explanation that the cling­ing to imputations [exists] in noble ones, it is asserted that they realize any identity as being a mere imputation by virtue of their mentally engaging in true reality [in a direct manner]. The words of noble ones, [such as saying,] \"At that time, I ... \" are conventions that they teach as means fo r others to understand, but it is not that they possess any fully qualified clinging to \"me.\" Therefore, these disputes are without any essence.650 It may be said, \"But then Aryavimuktisena's explanations about the concep­tions in the mind streams of [bodhisattvas] on the path of preparation that cling to imputed individuals and about these [same] conceptions here being factors to be relinquished through seeing are not tenable. Also, the factors to be relinquished through familiarization would not be asserted as concep­tions that cling to substance because the first [type of] conceptions about the apprehender exist only in ordinary beings and the second [type], only in noble ones.\" {358} [Aryavimuktisena] took the clinging to imputations as being two­fold by virtue of [the above-mentioned] two [types of] mental engagement. Therefore, his explanation that the latter conceptions [ (those of clinging to imputations)] exist [both] in ordinary beings and within [the scope of] the factors to be relinquished through seeing [are given] in terms of the mental"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"318 Groundless Paths engagement in aspiring [for true reality]. On the other hand, the intention of the root text ascribing them to noble ones is to bear in mind that [this is the case in terms of] the mental engagement in true reality [in a direct man­ner]. Also, [Aryavimuktisena] does not use the conventional term \"clinging to substance\" with regard to the factors to be relinquished through familiariza­tion. [Ratnakara]santi takes these two [conceptions] as [referring to] definite existence and thus explains that the conceptions of clinging to imputations exist in sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and the conceptions of clinging to sub­stance, in ordinary beings. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.1.2.3. Rebutting dispute about the answer It may be said, \"Does this explanation here that the conceptions about the apprehender are conceptions about sentient beings refer to the persons in terms of the twofold [division into] persons and phenomena or is it asserted as [referring to] the basis for imputing a person-the mere phenomena that are conjoined with a mind stream? In the first case, since these conceptions (the subjects) are afflictive obscurations, they would also be relinquished by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. But this is not tenable-they are uncommon factors to be relinquished through the bodhisattva path and, if one relin­quishes the two [types of the conceptions about the apprehender], one is also able to relinquish the two [types of the] conceptions about the apprehended. Therefore, this is extremely absurd because it would follow that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are able to relinquish all four conceptions about appre­hender and apprehended. In the second case, neither the explanation in the text that [said conceptions about the apprehender] are conceptions about sentient beings and persons nor the Vrtti's explanation in its answer to the [above] dispute that the clinging to substance exists or does not exist by virtue of there being or not being, respectively, the clinging to 'me' are tenable.\" In general, within the conceptions about the apprehender, there are the two [types of] clinging to persons and mere phenomena as being apprehenders. {359} Since both must be relinquished by bodhisattvas, the presentation of both must be accepted. Therefore, though both ordinary beings and noble ones realize personal identitylessness, [this realization] exists [in them] in a nonmanifest and manifest manner, respectively. Hence, the [types of] cling­ing of these two are presented as the clinging to substance and imputation, respectively. Accordingly, by virtue of the difference of their realizing or not realizing phenomenal identitylessness in a direct manner, the [two types of] clinging of ordinary beings and noble ones should be understood as consist­ing of the two [types of] clinging that represent the cognitive obscurations of clinging to mere phenomena as being substantial and imputed experiencers, respectively."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 319 To take the [two types of] clinging of ordinary beings and noble ones as the two [types of] clinging to substance and imputation, respectively, in this way is in terms of [their being like this] primarily.

(3) [The remedy for] both the factors to be relinquished and their remedies that adhere to the three realms is the statement that mental engagement and nonengagement are and are not the cause for the three realms, respectively. {360} (4) The remedy for abiding through clinging is to engage in the manner of mental nonengagement, that is, not to abide in any of all phenomena. (5) The remedy for clinging is the jus­tification for this [nonabiding]-since there is nothing to be attached to, there is no attachment. ( 6) The remedy for clinging to imputed phenomenal entities is as follows. If [bodhisattvas] think, \"The mental engagement in detachment [is the mental engagement in the mother], and the Tathagata, after having real­ized that all phenomena are ungraspable, explained [them to be so],\" they are distant from the mother and fall away from her-the [Tathagata] did not real­ize, teach, or impute any phenomenon. (7) The remedy for attachment to the six paramitas is the following statement-[the reason for] teaching that being attached to [all phenomena] being ungraspable means being separated from the mother is that she is not expressed through being attached. (8) The remedy for clinging to remedies is that, through not being separated from remedies such as the paramitas, the remedies and their focal objects are equal.

(3) The remedy fo r arising and ceasing is that no phenomenon whatsoever arises or ceases through the mother. ( 4) The remedy fo r being conjoined and not being conjoined with entities is to make efforts in the mother, without thinking of any phenomena (such as fo rm) as being conjoined or not conjoined. (5) The remedy fo r conceptions about abiding is to not make efforts [by thinking], \"I should abide in fo rm and so on.\" ( 6) The remedy fo r destroying the dispo­sition is that [those with] the buddha disposition train in the six paramitas and, through that, take care of sentient beings, [which is taught] through the example that someone who wishes to eat mangos should not waste their seeds. (7) The remedy fo r lacking striving is to train in the six paramitas out of the desire to not depend on others, purify [one's buddha] realm, dwell in the heart of enlightenment, and turn the wheel of dharma. (8) The remedy fo r lacking the cause is the justification fo r the [preceding one]-the statement that the mother is the cause of the realizations of all noble ones, [which is taught] through the example of the ocean being the cause of all precious substances. (9) The remedy fo r observing opposing fo rces is the statement that those who engage in the mother are not overcome by maras and so on, [which is taught] through the example of a master of archery with a suitable sized bow not being overcome by enemies.

(1) To train the mind streams of others is twofold in terms of establishing them in the dharma of realization (the result) and the dharma of scrip­tures (the cause). The first one consists of [causing them to] give rise to the realizations of the path of seeing and so on and then establishing them in enlightenment by way of the prophecy. The second one refers to teaching them the cause of this enlightenment-the actuality of the mother that is the dharma of the freedom from reference points.

Proving it through scripture The stains are primordially without arising and ceasing because, ultimately, they are of the nature of the dharmadhatu free from reference points, just as space is without arising and ceasing. The reason applies [because] the Madhyantavibhaga says: Except fo r the dharmadhatu There are thus no phenomena.655 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.2.1.2.1.2.2. Proving it through reasoning The stains are primordially without arising and ceasing because, ultimately, there are no real entities, just like a lotus in the sky. The proof of this rea­son is fo urfold, consisting of the arguments of (1) being free from unity and multiplicity (analyzing the nature), (2) the vajra slivers (analyzing the cause), (3) negating arising from the fo ur possibilities (analyzing the result), and (4) dependent origination. ( 1) [The reasoning of] being free from unity and multiplicity says, \"What is ultimately free from unity and multiplicity is necessarily without nature, just like a reflection. These entities are also free from unity and multiplicity.\" {364} This is [a reason of] the nonobservation of something that includes [the predicate of what is to be negated]. The Madhyamakala'?'lkiira says: As for these entities that we and others speak of, Since they, in true reality, are free from A nature of unity and multiplicity, They are without nature, just like reflections.656 (2) [The reasoning of] the vajra slivers says, \"What ultimately arises neither from itself, nor something other, nor both, nor without a cause is necessarily without real arising, just like the horns of a rabbit. Ultimately, these entities are also free from arising from themselves, something other, both, or without a"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 323 cause.\" This is [also a reason of] the nonobservation of something that includes [the predicate of what is to be negated]. The Mulamadhyamakakarika [says]: Not from themselves, not from something other, Not from both, and not without a cause-At any place and any time, All entities lack arising.657 [Phenomena] do not arise from themselves because the same [text says]: If cause and result were one, The agent and what is acted upon would be one.658 Accordingly, father and son, fire and smoke, seed and sprout, and so on would be one. Ultimately, [phenomena] do not arise from something other [either] because the same [text says]: If cause and result were other, A cause and what is not a cause would be the same. 659 Accordingly, it would very absurdly follow that, just as a seed is the cause for a sprout, coal is also a cause of this [sprout] because they are not different in their sheer being other [than the sprout] and a special being other is not estab­lished under analysis. Therefore, [both seed and coal] are equal with regard to [what is attempted to] be proven [here-that entities arise from something other]. {365} [Phenomena] do not arise from both [themselves and something other either] because the flaws that were stated for each one [of these two possibili­ties] would [both accrue] and said two [possibilities] are mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is impossible that this is the case. Nor do [phenomena] arise without a cause-it would very absurdly follow that the brilliant colors of a peacock are also observed in crows; the nature of water (being cool), in humans; and so on. Or peacocks would be without their brilliant colors and coolness would not be observed in water. For if [any phenomena] arose without a cause, they would either have to exist at all times and places or never exist at all. (3) [The reasoning of] negating arising from the four possibilities says, \"What ultimately arises neither as an existent, nor as a nonexistent, nor as both, nor as neither is necessarily the nonarising of a real result, just like the child of a barren woman. Ultimately, these entities also do not arise as exis­tents, nonexistents, both, or neither.\" The Sanyatasaptati [says]:"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"324 Groundless Paths Existents do not arise because they exist [already].

[The reasons fo r] the Madhyamikas being able to relinquish the obscurations completely Based on the four stages of yoga, Madhyamikas realize all phenomena as the nature of suchness free from reference points and thus are able to relinquish all cognitive obscurations of clinging to real existence without exception.661 These four stages of yoga are as follows. (1) Non-Buddhist and Buddhist tirthikas assert a permanent self that is empty of arising and ceasing. {367} Within seeming phenomena, there is nothing that is empty of arising and ceasing (any entity that is permanent and a self), that is, there is no personal self, which is like the horns of a rabbit. Having determined that, through focusing on the focal object of the innate views about such a self one meditates by thinking, \"In terms of negative determination, there is no self, and, in terms of positive determination, [phe­nomena] are just mere phenomena.\" Through this, the clinging to a self is put to an end, which is the yoga of focusing on the lack of a self. (2) Whatever is invariably observed together is necessarily not different in substance, such as happiness and the awareness that experiences that hap­piness. As for the appearance of blue and the mind that perceives this blue, by virtue of the reason of their invariable co-observation it is determined that what appears as a referent does not exist outside of the mind in which it appears. One familiarizes with the fact that what appears as an object, in terms of positive determination, is mere inner mind, and, in terms of negative determination, does not exist as an outer referent. Through this, the clinging to outer referents is relinquished. (3) Having determined that, without anything to be apprehended, there is also no apprehender because these two are mutually dependent, one familiar­izes with this by thinking, \"The two of apprehender and apprehended do not"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"326 Groundless Paths exist.\" Through this, also the clinging to a mere apprehender is eliminated, but what is not relinquished is the clinging to mere nondual wisdom. ( 4) What originates dependently necessarily lacks a real nature (just like the appearances of illusory horses and elephants) and nondual self-awareness is also dependently originating. Having determined this, {368} through famil­iarizing with all phenomena being free from reference points all cognitive obscurations of clinging to apprehended, apprehender, and self-awareness are relinquished without exception. Therefore, the Madhyamaka path relin­quishes the two obscurations completely. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.1.2. The reasons for the views of those who propound [real] entities not being able to relinquish them Since they respectively assert that apprehended, apprehender, and self-aware­ness are really existent, in that case the stains would not be affected even in the slightest by their remedies because these stains would exist ultimately. Therefore, since the two [Buddhist] proponents of [real] entities [(Vaibha�ikas and Sautrantikas) assert really existent] stains that are [primary] minds and mental factors and the Vijfiaptivadins assert them to be [instances of] the really existent other-dependent [nature], they assert them to be established ultimately. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2. The actual [internal] contradictoririess of their position Therefore, their assertion that the Bhagavan relinquishes the cognitive obscura­tions in all aspects and their claim that the phenomena of the apprehended, the apprehender, and self-awareness exist ultimately are contradictory positions. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2. Presenting the system of those who propound emptiness In this nature of phenomena that is dependent origination, the two [kinds of] identity have never existed in the first place. Therefore, they are not to be removed. On the other hand, since the two [kinds of] identitylessness have neither beginning nor end, they are not to be added or set up even in the slightest. If actual reality-the two [kinds of] identitylessness-is thus seen without superimposition and denial in an unmistak.en manner, as it really is, through viewing this actual reality of the nature of phenomena that is free from removing an existent [identity] and adding the nonexistence of any identity {369} one will be liberated, in due order, from afflictive obscurations and cognitive obscurations. 662"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 327 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.2.2.

The actual path of seeing This has two parts: 1) The actual [path of seeing] 2) Its function 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.2.2.1.1. The actual [path of seeing] The path of seeing is what consists of the single moment of poised readi­ness in which each one of the six paramitas contains the six [paramitas]. It is not contradictory that the path of seeing was explained in other chapters as having sixteen moments, while it is explained here as being a single moment and this [moment] being poised readiness. For the explanation as sixteen [moments was given with the intention that it refers to] the manner of induc­ing certainty during subsequent attainment, while the explanation as a single [moment is given with] the intention that there is no difference in seeing the nature of the fo ur realities in meditative equipoise. Also, said poised readiness is the actual relinquishing remedy and this here is the context of teaching this path of seeing as the remedy of the [above fo ur] conceptions. As for the six paramitas in this context, some assert that the culmination of seeing is taught through being indicated by them [in an indirect manner] since they represent its subsequent attainment. However since the paramitas [on the path of seeing] bear the aspect of not observing any reference points, it is permissible to refer to them as the [actual] nature [of the path of seeing]. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.2.2.1.2. Its function When the culmination of seeing is perfected in this way, the 108 manifest conceptions to be relinquished through seeing (plus their seeds), which con­sist of the above-explained thirty-six fa ctors to be relinquished through seeing in [each one of] the three realms, are relinquished. In general, through relin­quishing the manifest [factors to be relinquished] , {370} their latencies are not necessarily relinquished. Here, however, there is no flaw since this is the context of their being relinquished through the supramundane path. As fo r the manner of their being relinquished, since they are motivated by the mental state of clinging to [real] entities, their remedy is the realization that all entities are without nature. Through having familiarized with this, if said cause [of clinging to real entities] is put to an end, these conceptions will"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"328 Groundless Paths naturally come to an end by themselves. This manner of being relinquished also applies to the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through familiarization. Therefore, though the divisions of the distinct instances of these conceptions are infinite since their root is the clinging to real existence, the essential point is to familiarize with the realization of the lack of real exis­tence as their remedy. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.2.2.2.2. The manner of fa miliarization During meditative equipoise, one is absorbed in the samiidhi of the lion's sport and, during subsequent attainment, one realizes the twelve links of dependent origination in their progressive and reverse orders. As for the lion's sport as the meditative equipoise [of the path of seeing], according to the assertions of Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra, it represents the culmination of seeing in the form of six sets of six [piiramitiis], but according to the Suddhamati, [the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing] is the lion's sport that is explained below [as the preparatory stage] in the training in crossing in one leap.663 Here, in the context of realizing dependent origination during the subse­quent attainment [of the path of seeing], a slight critical analysis of dependent origination has eight parts: 1) General characteristics 2) The individual division and summary [of the twelve links] 3) The manner of their arising as conditions 4) Their individual functions 5) In how many lifetimes they are completed 6) The presentation with which levels they accord {371} 7) The manner of familiarizing [with them] 8) The benefit of having familiarized [with them] in this way 1) As for the general characteristics, [the Buddha] says in the [Dharmartha]­vibhagasutra: Through this existing, that originates. Through this arising, that arises. This is as follows. Through the condition of ignorance, [kar­mic] formations ... As for the meaning of this, in due order, first, when inner and outer enti­ties arise, they are not produced by anyone in a premeditated way, but, in general, if the causes and the conditions exist, certain results arise. Secondly, even if the causes exist, [the results] do not arise from permanent conditions, but arise from impermanent ones. Thirdly, though they arise from conditions and are impermanent, it is not that all results arise from all causes, but they arise from their specific concordant causes that have the efficacy to produce"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 329 them. Through this, starting with the dependent origination of both what is contained and what is not contained in a mind stream, it is taught to have said three distinct features. The Abhidharmasamuccaya [speaks of these three as] \"arising from immovable conditions, arising from impermanent conditions, and arising from efficient conditions.\"664 2) The individual division and summary [of the twelve links] has two parts: a) Division b) Summary 2a) Their division is into the twelve [links] from ignorance up through aging and death, which refer to the inner dependent origination. The natures of these [links] are as follows. 2al) In general, there are two [kinds of] ignorance-afflicted and nonafflicted [ignorance]. However, since even arhats possess the second one in a manifest form, it is not tenable as the root of taking birth in [satp.saric] existence. {372} Therefore, it is the first [kind of ignorance that represents the first link of dependent origination], which is again twofold-being ignorant about cause and result and the actuality of true reality. This [ignorance] serves as the cause that motivates the three [kinds of karmic] formations. As for how it moti­vates these formations, when one is ignorant through not knowing the nature of the skandhas that are merely dependent origination, one clings to a self and, due to this, becomes attached to that self. Therefore, when one is overly attached to one's self, one wishes for this self to be happy and does not wish for it to suffer. Through wishing for the self to be happy in just this lifetime, one engages in nonvirtue and thus [forms] nonmeritorious [karma], the cause for the lower realms. Through wishing for it to be happy in later lifetimes, one engages in the ten virtues and thus [forms] meritorious [karma], the cause for [being reborn as] gods and humans [in the desire realm]. Through craving for the happiness of equanimity, which mainly consists of being free from the suffering of the [constant] change of happiness and suffering, one engages in the dhyanas and the formless [absorptions] and thus forms immovable karma, the cause for the [two] higher realms. In this way, ignorance is the root of forming said three karmas. As for which ignorance motivates which karma, the Abhidharmasamuccaya [says]: Ignorance is twofold-being ignorant about the maturation of results and being ignorant about the actuality of true reality. From being ignorant about the maturation of results, nonvirtuous forma­tions arise. From being ignorant about the actuality of true reality, virtuous and immovable formations [arise].665 {373}"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"330 Groundless Paths To explain it in this manner [entails] the intention of [referring to igno­rance as] the motivation at the time [of engaging in said formations], but their causal motivation is solely the ignorance about the actuality of true reality, as was explained above. Therefore, the first one of the twelve links is this [latter ignorance] alone. Since the commentary on the Pratityasamutpadasutra says that this [igno­rance] is what propels rebirth and lacks anything that would propel one toward seeing reality, the Vivrtagiit/.hdrthapi7J.t/.avyakhya asserts that it constitutes the ignorance to be relinquished through seeing. 666 However, this appears to be untenable. For Asaitga explains the factors to be relinquished through seeing as the imputational [factors to be relinquished] that arise from minds that are altered by philosophical systems. On the other hand, the minds of birds, deer, and so on are never altered by philosophical systems, but they also accumu­late karma that is affected by ignorance. It is this ignorance that is the root of [satp.saric] existence, which is held by Asailga and his brother to be the ignorance that [belongs to] the retinue of the afflicted mind. Therefore, it is reasonable that it is a factor to be relinquished through familiarization. It may be said, \"But then it would follow that noble ones possess this ignorance that propels [them into further rebirths] because they possess the afflicted mind.\" If I accept that this propelling ignorance belongs to the retinue of the afflicted mind, but did not say that the latter is necessarily the fo rmer, why should there be any such qualm? \"[Still,] noble ones do possess it because it is a factor to be relinquished through familiarization.\" There are many [factors] that are explained to be factors to be relinquished through familiarization but do not exist in noble ones, for example, intense hatred that focuses on an object. 2a2) [Karmic] formations are the karmas that are motivated by ignorance and are threefold [as explained above]. 2a3) Consciousness {374} refers to the mind stream that is taken on through said karmas. The [consciousness] at the time of accumulating karma is [the consciousness] at the time of the cause and the one that has linked to the [respective] place of birth is the consciousness at the time of the result. In the system of those who assert the alaya, it is the [alaya]. According to [all] others, it is the mental consciousness. 2a4) Name and form refer to the names of the fo ur [mental skandhas] of feel­ings and so on and to the form that [starts as an] oblong [embryo] and so on. 2a5) The ayatanas are the completion of [the six inner ayatanas] from the eye up through the mental [sense faculties] by virtue of the development of name and form-at the time of name and fo rm, the first fo ur sense faculties do not exist."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 331 2a6) Contact arises from the coming together of object, sense fa culty, and consciousness and delimits the three [kinds of] objects, such as pleasant ones. In terms of its supports [(the sense faculties)], it is sixfold. 2a7) Feelings are the experiences that arise from the delimiting of the three [kinds of] objects through contact and do so as having the nature of being pleasant, unpleasant, and so on. As before, they are sixfold. 2a8) Craving refers to the craving that entails the conditions of experiencing [any of] the three [kinds of] fe elings. It is threefold. The craving fo r the desire [realm] is to strive fo r happiness when one is tormented by suffering. The crav­ing fo r the fo rm [realm] is [to strive fo r] bliss during the first three dhyanas and to strive fo r equanimity during the fo urth one. The craving fo r the fo rmless [realm] is to strive fo r equanimity during the fo ur fo rmless [absorptions]. 2a9) Grasping is the strong increase of this very craving. In terms of its objects, it is fo urfold. To grasp at what is desirable [is to strive fo r, and cling to,] the five sense pleasures. To grasp at views [is to strive fo r, and cling to,] the sixty-two bad views.667 {375} To grasp at ethics and spiritual disciplines [is to strive for, and cling to,] spiritual disciplines (such as [behaving like] dogs and cows) and the relinquishment of corrupt ethics. To propound a self by virtue of the existence of views about a self,668 that is, to propound a self by saying, \"[My] body [is me] or I am [me] by virtue of certain [features]\" is to strive for, and cling to, views about a self and the pride of self-centeredness. 2a10) Becoming is the karma that, through the power of grasping, grows into the capacity to establish the arising of a rebirth. It is explained as sevenfold­the becomings of the five [kinds of] beings, the intermediate state, and karma, but the first six are merely ancillary.669 2all) Birth refers to the five skandhas that are linked to a place of birth through the power of said karma. It is divided into fo ur modes of birth. 670 2a12) [The link of] aging and death is divided into one's age changing, starting right after having been born, and leaving the concordant class [of the beings with whom one has lived], thus consisting of physical changes and so on and timely and untimely deaths. As fo r aging and death being presented as a single [link], this is fo r the reason of [these two] not being certain as successive links because death [can] occur without aging. As fo r misery, lamenting, [physical] suffering, mental displeasure, and turmoil [(the shortcomings that are entailed by these links)], they are not cer­tain in their order and some die while [being in a state of] mental pleasure. Therefore, they are not presented as links. That they are taught [in the sfttras] in an ancillary manner is fo r the sake of producing weariness in others by way of teacqing these shortcomings."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"332 Groundless Paths 2b) The summary [of the twelve links] has two parts: a) Brief summary of the links b) Summarizing them into [three kinds of] afflictedness 2ba) If the links are summarized briefly, {376} they are fo urfold-(!) pro­pelling, (2) propelled, (3) completing, and (4) completed links. (1) The first consist of the first three links. What [propels]? It is the fo rmations that entail the condition of ignorance. How [do they propel]? It is in the manner of consciousness being impregnated with latent karmic tendencies. (2) What is propelled? It is the fo ur [links] from name and fo rm up through fe elings. (3) The completing links are three. Through what [are the propelled links com­pleted] ? It is through the grasping that entails the condition of craving. How [are said links completed]? It is in the manner of the latent karmic tendencies that exist in consciousness functioning as [the link of] becoming. (4) What is completed? It is birth and aging and death. If these [links] are matched with a single cycle of causes and results in terms of taking birth [in this life,] the very fo rmations that were motivated by the propelling [link] of ignorance are revived through craving and grasping, and what makes them suitable as being completed as fo rm and so on is becoming. In the next [life] , the arising of the consciousness at the time of the result is birth and the changes of name and fo rm up through fe elings are aging and death, which represent the phase of the completion of what was propelled before. When master Asailga teaches this as the manner in which particu­lar sentient beings take birth, his adducing [the links of] craving and so on before [the link of] name and fo rm corresponds to the meaning of retrieving the intention of the sfttras. What the sfttras teach [explicitly] is that the latter [among] the twelve links operate based on the fo rmer. In a general sense, they teach that, when one enters saqtsara, by virtue of having accumulated karma through fo rmer ignorance, {377} the body of name and fo rm and so on is completed. Based on this [body], karma and afflictions (such as craving) arise and become [the links of] birth and so on in one's rebirth. However, this does not [entail] the intention of [referring to] a single particular sentient being's manner of taking birth from ignorance up through aging and death. 2bb) As fo r [the twelve links] being summarized into [three kinds of] afflictedness, this corresponds to what is explained in [Nagarjuna's] Pratityasamutpadahrdaya [in the] Madhyamaka [system]: The first, eighth, and ninth are afflictive, The second and tenth are karmic, And the remaining seven are suffering. 671"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 333 3) As fo r the manner of the arising [of the twelve links] as conditions, the Abhidharmasamuccaya says that the earlier links function as the fo ur condi­tions for the later ones, as it is respectively suitable. This means that [those links that consist of] awareness [function as all] fo ur conditions for [the others that consist of] awareness. [Those that consist of] awareness [function] solely as the dominant condition for [those] that possess fo rm. [Those] that possess fo rm [function as] two [conditions] (said [dominant condition] and the object condition) fo r [those that consist of] awareness. [Those] that possess fo rm function as two [conditions] (the causal and the dominant conditions) for [those] that possess fo rm.672 To illustrate the first [case] through the manner in which ignorance functions as [all fo ur] conditions fo r karmic fo rmations (intention), these fo rmations arise from the latent tendencies of ignorance; through the fo rce of being propelled by it, they operate continuously; when being ignorant, one mentally engages in what is not supreme as being so and thus engages [in ignorance as] a fo cal object; and, under the influence of that [ignorance], [the fo rmations] that are congruently associated with it deal with their fo cal objects in mistaken ways. Through this, in due order, [ignorance] functions as the causal up through the dominant condition [for karmic fo r­mations]. The corresponding [patterns] apply to the other [links] too. {378} This is not contradictory to the Mahayanasa171graha saying that [ignorance] functions solely as the dominant condition673 because this [text] has in mind that it definitely [functions in this way] , whereas the Abhidharmasamuccaya has in mind that it can [function as all fo ur conditions]. It is also not contradictory to the [Yogaciira]bhumi saying that it functions as the three [conditions] except for the causal condition674 because this [text] has in mind that the ultimate causal condition is the alaya, whereas the [description] in the Abhidharmasamuccaya is made in terms of conventional causes and conditions. 4) The individual functions [of the twelve links] are twofold. (a) Their similar function consists of the respectively fo rmer giving rise to the resepectively lat­ter. (b) Their dissimilar functions are stated in the Madhyantavibhiiga: Because of obscuring, because of planting, Because of guiding, because of taking on, Because of completing, because of delimiting the triad, Because of experiencing, because of pulling along, Because of binding, because of manifesting, And because of suffering beings are affiicted.675"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"334 Groundless Paths The last two [links are taken here as] one by way of their being summarized as the causes fo r the arising [of suffering] , while the others are matched [with their distinct functions] one by one. 5) As fo r in how many lifetimes [the twelve links] are completed, in general, when one is born [through] miraculous birth among the fo ur modes of being born, the sense fa culties and the main and secondary limbs are completed simultaneously and, when one dies, the sense fa culties also perish simultane­ously. In the other three [modes of birth], both [these processes happen] in a gradual manner. Therefore, the gradual completion of [the links] such as name and fo rm is omitted in miraculous birth. In the desire and fo rm [realms], the twelve links exist in a complete manner. {379} For in the fo rm [realm], there is aging (the decaying and dissolving of conditioned fo rmations) and the other [links] exist too. In the fo rmless [realm], half of the fo urth link [(form)] and the five [physical] ayatanas of the fifth one do not exist, but the others are suitable to exist. If [the process] is swift, the twelve [links] are completed in two lifetimes. For example, if, through the power of ignorance, a human being in the desire realm has accumulated the karma fo r being reborn as a desire [realm] god in his or her consciousness, right upon dying, through [this karma] being revived by craving and grasping, it is made powerful by virtue of becoming. Thus, these six [links are completed] in this lifetime and the seven links, including the consciousness at the time of the result, are completed in the next [life­time]. The time of the intermediate state is not counted separately. Even if [said process] is slow, it is impossible fo r it to last longer than three lifetimes. For the three propelling [links] will be completed in one lifetime and the three completing links, also in one lifetime, with the [latter] and the two [links] of birth and aging occurring in an uninterrupted manner. However, it is pos­sible that many lifetimes come in between the propelling and the completing [links] . You may say, \"Therefore, it is uncertain how long [it takes fo r them to be completed] .\" Though many lifetimes may come in between the propelling and the completing [links], there is no flaw because [said lifetimes] represent lifetimes [that belong to] other [cycles of] dependent origination. 6) As for the presentation with which levels [the twelve links] accord, you may ask, \"Are these causal and resultant links of the same or of different lev­els?\" There is no certainty fo r either one. \"How is that?\" [Here] the levels are three-the level of birth, the level of death, and the level of what is other than these. In a [psychophysical] support of a lower level, one can accumulate the karmas for being reborn on said level or on a higher level. However, in a [psy­chophysical] support of a higher [level], there is no accumulation of karma fo r being reborn on a lower one. {380} In the [psychophysical] support of"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 335 one's own given level, there is the accumulation of the karma for being reborn on that level. That is, the first link and the consciousness at the time of the cause are included in the given level on which one accumulates this karma because ignorance [belongs to] the retinue of the afflicted mind, conscious­ness represents the alaya[ -consciousness], and said two consciousnesses [ (the afflicted mind and the alaya-consciousness)] in the given [psychophysical] support belong to said given level. It may be said, \"When, in the desire [realm], childish beings free from attach­ment accumulate the karma for being reborn on a higher level, they lack the afflictions of the desire [realm]. Therefore, their ignorance is not included in the desire [realm].\" With regard to this, the followers of the Abhidharmakosa assert that, in such a mind stream, there are the afflictions of a higher [level] and therefore, the karma that is motivated by them is accumulated. However, here there is no flaw because the afflicted mind is accepted, which cannot be overcome by the paths of childish beings and is included in the desire [realm]. It may also be said, \"If the karma fo r another level is motivated by the igno­rance of that other level, why does one not accumulate the karma for being reborn on a lower level in the [psychophysical] support of a higher level?\" In the [latter psychophysical] support, none of the afflictions for being reborn on a lower [level] exist and, through having obtained a special [psychophysical] support that is separated by different levels [from lower levels], one is not able to accumulate any inferior karma of lower levels. Karmic formations are included in the level on which one will be reborn because the karma of a certain level is not able to propel the skandhas of another level. As for the [above-mentioned] seven [links], including the con­sciousness at the time of the result, they are included solely in the level on which one will be reborn. The VivrtagCujharthapir;ujavyakhya explains that craving and grasping are [also] included in the level on which one will be reborn,676 but this is [only] reasonable for being born on a higher level from a lower level since, [in that case,] there is a flux of the afflictions of the higher level in [the psychophysical support of the lower one]. {381} However, that there are manifest afflictions of a lower level in the [psychophysical] support of an existence of being born on a higher level discords with the general sys­tem of the abhidharma and is not [a position that can be] obtained through reasoning [either]. Therefore, [said explanation] is not in order fo r being reborn on a lower level from a higher [level]. However, [the link of] becoming is included in the level on which one will be reborn, no matter whether one is born in the pleasant realms or the lower realms of the desire [realm]. As fo r being reborn in the lower realms, [this link] consists only of the latencies of nonvirtue of that lifetime."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"336 Groundless Paths It may be said, \"If [ignorance] lacks anything that would propel one toward seeing reality, it is not reasonable that nonreturners are reborn in the pure abodes through the alternating cultivation [of contaminated and uncontaminated dhyanas] because one must generate uncontaminated dhyanas in order to be reborn there. However, at the time of ordinary beings, uncontaminated [ dhyanas] are not attained and, at the time of the noble ones, karma is not accumulated.\" On this, I accept the explanation in the VivrtagCltjharthapiJ:ttJavyakhya677 that there is no flaw because the karma for being born in Great Fruition [(the highest level of the fourth dhyana)] exists since beginningless [time] and is transformed into the cause for being reborn in the pure abodes through said alternating [cultivation]. That both the noble ones and those with attachment have accumulated karma for being reborn in the desire [realm] is to be understood as referring to the time of their being ordinary beings. This is similar to the assertion of the followers of the Abhidharmakosa that if the afflictions for being born on certain levels have not been relinquished, even the noble ones propel karmas that are motivated by these [afflictions]. 7) The manner of familiarizing [with the twelve links] is to familiarize with them in their progressive and reverse orders. \"What are these two?\" [The first one consists of] \"through the condition of ignorance, formations [arise]\" and so on, that is, [up through] \"through the condition of birth, aging and death, misery, lamenting, [physical] suffering, {382} and mental displeasure occur.\" One discriminates these [links] and thinks, \"In this way, nothing but this heap of suffering occurs.\" [In the reverse order,] one discriminates [the links] from \"Through the cessation of birth, aging and death cease\" and so on up through \"Through the cessation of ignorance, formations cease.\" [Finally,] one thinks, \"In this way, nothing but this heap of suffering ceases.\" [In due order,] these two represent the progressive order of afflicted phenomena and the reverse order of purified phenomena. Illustrated by these two, one should also under­stand the progressive order of purified phenomena and the reverse order of afflicted phenomena. You may wonder, \"Why do these constitute a progres­sive order and a reverse order, respectively?\" Because, in the first one, birth [is analyzed] last, while the latter one analyzes birth first and thus is the reverse of the [first one]. In this way, the presentation of the [above-mentioned] four [types of] progressive and reverse orders of afflicted phenomena and purified phenomena, respectively, is [given] in terms of teaching the principles of the [four] realities. For the two [links of] birth and aging are the final matura­tions of karma and afflictions and thus represent the reality of suffering. The examination of what arises from birth and aging and what their cessation is is [performed] in order to become learned in the reality of suffering and the reality of cessation that is the cessation of [suffering]. The examination"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 337 of what arises from ignorance and what ceases from it[s cessation] is [per­fo rmed] in order to become learned in [the realities of] origin and the path because the two [links] of ignorance and formations represent the reality of the origin [of suffering] and the path represents what ceases them.678 8) The benefit of having familiarized [with the twelve links] in this way is that one is learned in [the ways in which one] engages in, and puts an end to, sa�psara {383} and that one, through respectively rejecting and adopting these [ways], passes into nirvai)a without grasping. The proponents of [real] entities assert that these twelve links have the character of being substantially established [instances] of arising and ceasing, but what comes from the texts of noble Nagarjuna and his spiritual heirs is that their natural state is to be devoid of the eight extremes of reference points. 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.2.3.

Alternating with cessation [First,] one progresses in the progressive order through alternating the [other] eight meditative absorptions with eight [meditative absorptions of] cessation. {384} After having risen from the [last meditative absorption of] cessation that has been alternated with the Peak of Existence, [one slightly exits from the meditative absorption of cessation through reentering] the Peak of Existence and, upon rising from it, abides in a state of mind of the desire [realm]. Thus, in this [sequence], there are eighteen abodes. This accords with the [sutra] in eighteen thousand lines. According to the [revised edition of the Prajnaparamitasutra in Twenty-five Thousand Lines] in eight chapters, after the last [meditative absorption of] cessation, one [immediately] abides in a state of mind of the desire [realm] without [first] exiting slightly into the Peak of Existence.

(3) As for the remedy for not being empty, [they say]: Through seeing that phenomena are empty of their own specific characteristics, they should train in what is not formed.

(7) As for the remedy for conceptions about the three yanas, [they say]: \"But how can these three yanas-the sravakayana, the pratyekabuddhayana, and the mahayana-be distinguished?\" The Bhagavan answered, \"Subhuti, in phenomena that are not produced and not formed any distinction whatsoever is not observable.\" (8) As for the remedy fo r the impurity of offerings, [they say]: To make offerings to the Tathagata and his emanations is of such great benefit and is so amazing."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"344 Groundless Paths (9} As for the remedy for disordered conduct, [they say]: They should not disturb this nature of phenomena by saying, \"This is the mother.

(7) As for the remedy for being ignorant about the [four] realities, [they say]: The bodhisattva mahasattvas who analyze the meaning of this pro­found mother should analyze it as the meaning of impermanence.

Once it has turned into excellent leaves, flowers, and fruits, this [per­son] enjoys the leaves, flowers, and fruits of this sprout. Likewise, bodhisattva mahasattvas engage in unsurpassable perfect enlight­enment for the sake of sentient beings, engage gradually in the six paramitas, and attain the knowledge of all aspects. Just like leaves, flowers, and fruits, they will nourish all sentient beings. 693 The sfttras continue that \"leaves\" refers to leading sentient beings out of the lower realms; \"flowers,\" to [causing sentient beings] to be born as gods and humans; and \"fruits,\" to their attaining the five fruitions [of stream-enterer, once-returner, nonreturner, arhat, and pratyekabuddha] and the knowledge of all aspects. In this section, the root text [V.36c] says, \"Who are embellished with the desired fruition. \"694 On the meaning of this, the Vrth'695 says that, just as a tree bears the load of the fruits that are enjoyed by others, bodhisattvas are embellished by their power of granting others the five fruitions-the causes for the nourishment of sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"346 Groundless Paths In this way, from among the three [parts of this discussion of the] path of familiarization (the path of familiarization as the support, the conceptions to be relinquished, and the qualities as what is supported [by it] ), the first two are presented as all nine [levels of the] path of fa miliarization and the last one, as the tenth bhumi. {392} 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.4.

In this context, a slight critical analysis of the two realities has two parts: 1) The purpose of determining the two realities 2) The natures of the two realities as what are to be determined 1) As fo r the purpose of determining the two realities, all the many discourses of the victors are nothing but [statements] that start from the two realities. The Pitrputrasamagama[sutra says]: Without having heard them from others, The knower of the world {395} taught through these two realities,"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 349 Which are the seeming and, likewise, the ultimate­There is no third reality whatosever. The Mulamadhyamaka[karika states]: The teaching of the dharma by the buddhas Is correctly based on the two realities. These are the seeming worldly reality And the ultimate reality.703 The Satyadvaya[vibhaga says]: Those who understand the division of the two realities Are not ignorant about the sage's words. Having gathered all accumulations without exception, They will go to the excellent yonder side.704 The Madhyamakahrdaya [says]: Without the staircase of the correct seeming, It is not suitable to become skilled In ascending to the top Of the mansion of true reality.705 Therefore, those who are endowed with discrimination should definitely reflect on these two [realities]. 2) [The explanation of] the natures of the two realities as what are to be deter­mined has two parts: a) General [instruction] on the two realities b) Instruction on them individually 2a) As fo r the general instruction, the two realities lack any division that is made by their own natures. Otherwise, if they were established as being of one nature, the ultimate would also be just something contrived that is conceptu­ally imputed, the seeming (just as the ultimate) would also be the uncontrived basic nature that is not mentally imputed, and all beings would be liberated without effort since they realize the ultimate [by virtue of just perceiving the seeming] . The Mulamadhyamaka[karika says]: {396} As for a so-called \"produced nature,\" How could it be suitable?"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"350 Groundless Paths Natures are unfabricated And not dependent on anything else. 706 The * Aryatattvanirdesasamadhf01 [declares] : Those who speak of the seeming as the ultimate Should be known as possessing an erring mind. The Samadhiraja[sutra says] : Neither the eye, the ear, nor the nose is valid cognition, Nor is the tongue, the body, or mental cognition valid cognition. If these sense fa culties were valid cognition, Whom would the path of the noble ones do any good?708 If [the two realities] were established as being different in nature, there would be limitless [absurd] consequences such as the fo llowing. Just as in the case of light and darkness, the ultimate would not be the nature of the seeming and, just as when it is asserted that seeing the lack of an elephant is the remedy fo r being afraid due to mistaking a rope fo r a snake, the realization of the ultimate would not eliminate the stains of clinging to the seeming. In [the sfitras of] the mother of the victors, [the Buddha] said not only once that \"it is not the case that the mundane seeming is other and the ultimate is other too\" and that the phenom­ena in the repetitive phrases of afflicted and purified phenomena are [nothing but] suchness-if suchness were something other than them, it would not exist It may be said, \"If the two realities are not established as the same or differ­ent, it fo llows that they do not exist.\" It is our assertion that the nature of the two realities is not established as being either the same or different. However, we assert their merely being different [in the sense] of negating being the same, just as in the case of entity and nonentity. {397} As fo r [the objection that one then can]not give a presentation of the two realities as being dif­fe rent, there is no entailment. [For] such a presentation is given by way of imputing \"the ultimate\" onto the aspect that is the freedom from reference points, which is just like designating a specifically characterized phenomenon by way of blending into one that which appears through conception and the referent that is conceived [by it] . The sfitras [say]: Within phenomena without letters, What listener and what teacher would there be? It is through superimpositions onto what is changeless That it is asserted as listener and teacher, respectively."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 351 Furthermore, in the scriptures, there are many statements about the two realities being neither one nor different. Therefore, there is no scriptural invalidation [of our above assertion]. However, since [the two possibilities of] the two realities being the same or different are both invalidated through reasoning, the assertion that both realities are established through a nature represents a flaw that nobody but you [(the above objector)] has set up by yourself. Therefore, also the statement, \"[The two realities] are of one nature but different isolates\" is not tenable/09 nor is [the fo llowing verse] from the BodhicittavivaraiJa a [valid scriptural] source fo r it: Just like being produced and impermanent, It is certain that they do not occur without each other. Therefore, emptiness is explained as the seeming And the seeming, as emptiness.710 Since this [verse] takes being produced and impermanent as the example fo r the one reality not existing without the other, it also constitutes the reason­ing that these [two] are neither the same nor other. Thus, by virtue of my excellent assertions [here], one should abandon the bad views about [the two realities] being one or different that the Bhagavan himself disparaged in the sa,dhinirmocana[siltra]: The defining characteristic of the conditioned realms and the ultimate Is their defining characteristic of being free from being one and different. {398} Those who think of them in terms of oneness and difference Have engaged them in an improper manner.711 You may wonder, \"So how are the realities divided into two then?\" The entirety of the fa ctors that appear to mind as many different characteristics (such as arising, ceasing, being afflicted, being purified, being affirmative, and being negative) and that, from the perspective of the conventional mind, cannot be invalidated through reasoning are seeming reality. If this seeming [real­ity] is analyzed, its being devoid of the entire web of reference points (such as appearing, not appearing, arising, not arising, and having or lacking an identity) without exception represents \"the ultimate.\" It is only accepted by virtue of the purpose of guiding others on the correct path. \"Freedom from reference points\" is also merely a name that is imputed from the perspective of others, but it is not asserted that any phenomenon that is the freedom from reference points is established. Thus, the Satyadvayavibhaga [says]:"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"352 Groundless Paths Just these very appearances, as they [appear], Are the seeming. The other one is its counterpart.712 The Bodhicaryavatara [states]: The ultimate is not the sphere of cognition. It is said that cognition is the seeming.713 You may think, \"When it is explained in this way, the ultimate is not just this illusionlike dependent origination, but if there is nothing other than this either, what could it be? Therefore, since [the above] is an opinion about it that is without any objective reference point, it is an intolerable view of extinc­tion.\" This is very true. For the latent tendencies of having habituated oneself very much with views that cling to the extremes of what is to be adopted, to be rejected, to be affirmed, and to be negated have flourished since beginningless [time]. It is by virtue of this {399} that one, when not finding anything that can be grasped by conceptions as being absolutely \"this,\" does not aspire for the emptiness that puts an end to all clinging and that fear of it arises. This is just the nature of things. Therefore, it is reasonable that those with insight train in the principle of [being free from the extreme ofl denial when the dependent originations of the seeming appear ([that is, thinking,] \"From the perspective of their lacking a nature and being illusionlike, they do not exist\"), and being free from the extreme of superimpositions onto the ultimate that is free from all reference points ([that is, thinking,] \"It exists, it is permanent\"). 2b) As for the instruction on the [two realities] individually, the Satyadvaya­vibhaga takes the seeming as being twofold-correct and false: Although [phenomena] are similar in appearance, Since they are able to perform functions or not, Due to being correct or false, The division of the seeming was made.714 The ultimate is also taken to be twofold-the freedom from all reference points is the nonnominal ultimate and the negation of a portion of [all] refer­ence points is the nominal one. The same [text continues]: Since the negation of arising and so on Concords with true reality, we accept it.715 Since this refers to the objects of the inferences that are based on reasons such as being free from unity and multiplicity, it does not go beyond conceptual fabrications and thus is the imputed ultimate."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 353 Or it represents the position of master [Haribhadra] if one says that the appearances during the subsequent attainment of the great noble ones [are called] \"the correct [seeming],\" while the own appearances of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and those who just see this life are called \"the false seem­ing.\" For [both] appear as apprehender and apprehended, but [said persons] respectively do not possess or do possess clinging to [these appearances] in the way they appear. {400} In this way, this very rough [account here] is formulated according to the position of *Svatantrikas such as master Haribhadra. For the time being, out of fear of being too wordy, I did not write down a detailed presentation, nor the one of the *Prasaitgikas.716 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.4.3.1.2. The answers that eliminate them In general, [the qualms here] are twofold-the qualms that take the route of the ultimate and the qualms that take the route of the seeming. Since each one of them has consequences and reasons that either concord or do not concord in type, they are definite as being four. Here [the consequence and the rea­son] being concordant in type means [to fling a consequence on the level of] the seeming through formulating [something on the level of] the seeming as the reason and to fling a consequence on [the level of] the ultimate through formulating [something on the level of] the ultimate as the reason. [The con­sequence and the reason] not being concordant in type refers to [flinging a consequence on the level of] the ultimate through formulating [something on the level of] the seeming as the reason and to fling a consequence on [the level of] the seeming through formulating [something on the level of] the ultimate as the reason. However, [all four] are included in [the above] two [types of qualms] because the two [cases of] formulating [something on the level of] the seeming as the reason [represent those that take the route of] the seeming and the two [cases of] formulating [something on the level of] the ultimate as the reason represent those that take the route of the ultimate. Therefore, the three [qualms] that are the ninth, tenth, and twelfth [among the above six­teen] are concordant in type in terms of the seeming, whereas the others are nonconcordant in type in terms of either the ultimate or the seeming. In due order, these [two cases of being concordant and nonconcordant] refer to the positive and the negative concomitances of the consequences [being or not being concordant in these ways]. As for [qualms] that are concordant in type in terms of the ultimate, none are listed [among the above sixteen]. Here, among the two [types of qualms] that take the routes of the seeming and the ultimate, respectively, and are not concordant in type, to those that take the route of the seeming [one must give an answer in terms] of the ulti­mate, and to those that take the route of the ultimate one must give an answer"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"354 Groundless Paths [in terms] of the seeming.

[Take,] for example, the qualm that takes the route of the ultimate [and says,] \"The focal object of the culmination of the uninterrupted [path] as the subject is not even tenable on [the level of] the seeming because there are no objects ultimately.\" To this [one gives the answer,] \"It follows that it is tenable because, on [the level of] the seeming, objects do exist.\" [Or take] a qualm that takes the route of the seeming and is the opposite of the above one, [saying,] \"It follows that it is not tenable that, ultimately, there are no objects because the focal object of the culmination of the uninterrupted [path] is tenable on [the level of] the seeming.\" To this one gives the answer, \"It follows that it is tenable because it is tenable that there are no focal objects ultimately.\" As for the three [above qualms] that take the route of the seem­ing, one respectively gives the following answers: \"The very nonobservation of the three spheres is skill in means,\" \"It is the very knowledge of being free from existence and nonexistence that represents the realization of the sage, but not conceptions about existence and nonexistence,\" and \"Since the familiarization of bodhis attvas with the three paths is in order to take care of others with the respective dispositions for these [paths], but does not repre­sent the own welfare [of bodhisattvas], there is no flaw.\" 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1 .2.4.3.1.3. The manner in which samadhi arises after they have been eliminated Bodhisattvas who strive for perfect enlightenment for the welfare of others eliminate all wrong ideas of apprehending the two realities as being contra­dictory again and again, starting from the path of accumulation. Through this, {402} the certainty of the valid cognition (which is free from noncogni­tion, wrong cognition, and doubt) of the actuality of the focal object and the aspect of the culmination of the uninterrupted [path] arises correctly.

In the context of the recollection of the dharma, [Haribhadra's two com­mentaries] speak of recollecting virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral dharmas. Though these three are not the jewel of the dharma, when one mentally engages in the jewel of the dharma, one mentally engages in what are known as conditioned, unconditioned, contaminated, and uncontaminated dharmas in an implicit manner. The recollection of the satp.gha is the recollection of the common and uncommon qualities of the satp.ghas of both the hinayana and the mahayana. The recollections of ethics and giving are the recollections of the benefits of these [two], whereas the [ethics and generosity within the six paramitas] above {406} are taught from the perspective of the isolates of practicing them. The Prasphutapada725 says that ethics [here means to recollect] cooling the mind stream without regret, accomplishing the path of the higher realms and the fruitions as one aspired for them, giving rise to samadhi without regret, and training in the qualities of gods and men. Giving is to recollect the branches of furthering one's relatives and friends, of the causes of happiness in [all] lifetimes, and of venerating one's parents and gurus. As for recollecting deities, the Prasphutapada726 says that this refers to considering that [the states of] ordinary gods (such as the four great kings) are accomplished through special pleasing karmas and to recollecting the qualities of [supramundane deities] such as Lokesvara727 and noble Tara. Aryavimuktisena and master [Haribhadra] say nothing but [that deities refer to] noble ones who are reborn as gods.728 2.2.2.2.1 .2.2.2.1.3. The serial [training] that makes the path pure [This training means to recollect that all] phenomena such as form are to be realized in the manner of finding certainty that they have the nature of lack­ing any real entity. Thus, these thirteen [elements of the serial training bear] the intention of [applying] not only to the serial training, but to the entire mahayana path. In the context of the serial training, when one mentally engages in a gradual manner in [all] the clear realizations that have arisen before and [all] those that have not arisen [yet] in one's mind stream, all of them are accomplished in the manner of being associated with the six paramitas, relying on the three jewels as their support, {407} being linked to recollecting the benefits of ethics and giving, recollecting all deities as one's witnesses, and understanding all of these as having the nature of the lack of entity without conceiving of the three spheres.

(2) Since it"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 363 is indivisible from the dharmas that are the qualities, it is indivisible. (3) Since it is without the duality of apprehender and apprehended, it has relinquished the two extremes. (4} Since it is liberated from the triad of afflictive, cognitive, and obscurations of meditative absorption, it is free from adventitious stains. (5) Since it is naturally pure, it is stainless. Since it is not an object of concep­tions, it is nonconceptual. Since it is the object of buddhas, it is the object of yoga. Through summarizing the last three [characteristics] as the defining characteristic of luminosity, it has five defining characteristics.747 Uttaratantra [11.47-48] explains that it is endowed with five ultimate quali­ties.

(4} Since only buddhas possess it, {413} it is an absolute unity. (5} Since it has relinquished all latent tendencies without exception, it is pure. Through the last two of these qualities and the third defining characteristic [above], it is also refuted that this [kaya] exists in those on the paths of learning or those who have not entered the path. [The Buddha] stated not only once that this kaya is the very nature of the mind that has the character of a total change of state through the power of having cultivated the path. Therefore, to assert that it is some other unconditioned phenomenon that is not suchness does not accord with any Madhyamaka or Mere Mentalist [positions]. It may be said, \"If it is asserted as suchness since this [suchness] must exist primordially, the svabhavikakaya would exist at the time of the ground.\" This flaw would equally apply to an unconditioned phenomenon that is not suchness. For if suchness [ (or any other unconditioned phenomenon, fo r that matter)] is not held to [exist] from the time of the ground onward, this simply comes down to the [absurd] consequence that it is not unconditioned. 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.2.1 .2.

As for the meaning of the term, the same [text] explains it as mirrorlike wisdom because the reflection of wisdom arises in it: Since it is the cause of all wisdoms, It is like a great jewel mine of wisdom. It is the sambhoga-buddhahood, Since the reflection of wisdom arises.756 As fo r its being explained as the sambhogikakaya, Asvabhava explains it as being the cause of the [sambhogikakaya] .757 {416} 2) As fo r the wisdom of equality, at the time of being a bodhisattva, one fa miliarized with oneself and others being equal.

One looks at the silvery orb of the moon above and so on at night, at the spots of light that are produced on the ground through moon­light or sunlight shining through a window or between the leaves of a tree, {422} or one sees a window or a hole in a wall. It is through merely [seeing these] that the samadhis of the totalities of water and so on will arise. Sdb) The manner of training without having trained before is twofold: 1) Taking the fo cal objects as supports 2) The manner of directing the mind toward them Sdb 1) As for taking the fo cal objects as supports, the fo cal supports of the total­ities of water and so on are the fo llowing that one creates as visual objects.773 One fills any container (such as a begging bowl) with stainless water free from any particular colors (such as blue) that has rained down from the sky and is filtered through a strainer. One cuts oily substantial wood into pieces, piles it"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 371 up in a suitable place (such as under a tree or near a guest house),774 and sur­rounds it by a wall. In [this wall], one makes a hole about a finger span and four finger widths [big] and, once [the fire] is lit, the wood is below, the smoke above, and the fire is blazing in the middle. [One takes] a window or a hole in a wall that will be touched by wind in any of the intercardinal directions, or, if there is none, one makes one. On a blue cotton cloth that is stretched out like the skin of a big drum, with any suitable colors (such as bronze blue or leaf blue or a blue eye potion), one creates a portable or stationary orb and demar­cates its fringe with a different color. The same goes for yellow, red, white, and so on. One lights a butter lamp inside a vase, covers its opening, and makes a hole in it that is not too big. {423} On the surface of a wall, its light creates a shining orb that remains for a long time. In a place that is covered by either a wall, a piece of felt, or a woolen blanket, one makes a hole about a finger span and four finger widths [big]. 5db2) The manner of directing the mind toward [said focal objects] is as follows. One sits down on a comfortable seat in an agreeable place in which one sees these focal objects, familiarizing with them again and again through focusing on just the names of these ten, [thinking,] \"earth, earth,\" \"water, water,\" and so on.775 Se) Signs are twofold: a) [The manner in which] the signs of seizing the indications of not yet having accomplished [the totalities appear] b) The manner in which the signs of the appearing of the indications of accomplishment appear Sea) The signs of not having accomplished the nine [totalities] of water and so on are the following appearances-water [appearing to be] mixed with bubbles, thus appearing to move; fire [appearing to] become more and more extinguished, burn down, and remain a bit in embers, coals, and ashes; [wind appearing to] be present like wafting vapor right before milk is boil­ing; [appearances] such as [blue] flowers without anthers and stalks, that is, anthers, stalks, and leaves [disappearing because of their] being made of what does not concord [with the color blue] (the same goes for the three [other] colors such as yellow); light orbs appearing only in some things as clearly as those that arise on the earth or walls; and mind [being able to] create [space] in something like holes in walls and so on, but not [being able to] enlarge it. 776 {424} The Vrtti says that these occur for both those who have and have not trained before, but in those who have already familiarized [with the totalities], they do not represent flaws. Seb) As for the signs of accomplishment, the signs of having accomplished the nine [totalities] of water and so on are the following appearances-[water]"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"372 Groundless Paths appearing as being unmoving like a fan of gems or a mirror orb that has the nature of gems abiding in space; [fire] appearing like a round red woolen cloth, a golden fan, or a [golden] pillar abiding in space; seeing that [wind] abides without moving, just as it is present; the focal support of the totality [of blue] soaring up [into the sky] from the orb [that one created as above] and then appearing there like a fan of gems (the same goes for the other three [col­ors]); similar to a very lucid and intense mass of light, [light] clearly appearing and abiding in everything as if it were' the expanse of space; and [space], if created by mind, appearing to enlarge. · For [the totality of] earth, there is no mention of the manner of accomplish­ing it through having trained in it before, the focal support for the training when not having trained in it before, and the signs of having and not having accomplished it. The reason for this is that one does not know in which way they appear. Sf) As for the manner of mentally engaging in the [totalities], at the point when said signs occur, through relinquishing any discrimination of colors and any mental engagement in characteristics one should familiarize [with the totalities] by clearly focusing on just their respective names. Sg) [In due order,] the functions of the [ten] totalities of [earth,] water, and so on are to multiply what is single [and vice versa] and {425} to turn space or water into earth, thus making them walkable for one's legs and so on; make birds slip into the earth and come out above it, rain down water, and turn riv­ers and oceans into earth, mountains, and so on; [create] billowing smoke and blazing fire, rain down showers of sparks, burn whatever one wishes, burn one's body once one has passed into nirv�a, and illuminate objects through the divine eye; walk as swiftly as the wind, bring down gusts of wind, and so on; turn forms blue and make them dark; turn forms yellow, turn them into gold, and so on; turn forms red and so on; turn forms white, distance oneself from sleep and dullness, overcome darkness, illuminate objects through the divine eye, and so on; turn forms luminous, distance oneself from sleep and dullness, illuminate objects through the divine eye, and so on; and, through clearing away obscurations and creating space within the earth, mountains, and so on, make one's way and walk straight through walls. The Bahubhumivastu777 explains that what has been transformed into gold and so on through the totalities according to whatever one aspires for becomes exactly like gold and so on and is able to [actually] perform the functions of [gold and so on]. Sh) As for the reasons for not presenting other ayatanas as totalities, {426} you may wonder, \"With form and tangible objects being presented as totalities, why are the other eight ayatanas that possess form not presented [as such]?\" Both oneself and others as well as all realms of sentient beings who possess"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 373 form exist as forms and tangible objects. Since the five sense faculties do not exist in the mind streams of others, and both smell and taste do not exist in the form realm, they are not presented [as totalities]. This is the intention of the Bahubhumivastu.778 It is said that sound is not presented [as a totality] because of its lack of a continuum. The Bahubhumivastu [continues] that, in the formless [realm], space is omnipresent and consciousness is the [cogniz­ing] subject of the objects of the totalities. Therefore, they are presented as totalities. However, the eight [ayatanas] that possess form [may] function as totalities below the form realm.779 Thus, the last two formless [ayatanas] are not presented [as totalities] because the third one severs [all] focal objects and the fourth one is unclear by virtue of mind being withdrawn inside. As for the four totalities of causal form being presented within the totalities that possess form, the Abhidharmasamuccaya [says] that, without the elements, the objects that are elemental derivatives (such as blue), cannot be encompassed.780 Si) The hermeneutical etymology [of \"totality\"] corresponds to [the Vrtti say­ing,] \"They are the ayatanas of totality because they encompass [everything] in an uninterrupted and [all-]pervading manner [through their resp�ctive objects].\"781 To explain the totalities in the manner as it is [done here] is the intention of the Vrtti.782 (6) As for the sixth set [of qualities], the basis of division is the ayatana of overpowering. The number of division is eight, which {427} consist of the fourfold overpowering of shapes and colors, respectively.783 As for the first four, the first one is to look, with the notion of oneself as the inner yogin pos­sessing form, at small external forms with nice and ugly colors. One knows them through overpowering them, sees them through overpowering them, and discriminates them in (this way. In the second [ayatana of overpower­ing], one does the very same thing by applying it to big [forms] instead of small ones. The next two consist of [looking in the same way at] small and big [forms], respectively, with the notion of oneself as the inner yogin being without form. Here \"small [forms]\" are the forms of sentient beings, and their being beautiful and ugly refers to their being divine and human, respectively. \"Big\" [refers to] houses, palaces, mountains, and so on, and their beautiful or ugly colors refer to being pleasant or unpleasant. \"Through overpowering\" [means] \"through mastering.\" \"One knows them\" refers to calm abiding, and \"one sees them,\" to superior insight. \"One discriminates them in this way\" means to lack pride, no matter whether one does or does not overpower them. In due order, these two sets of two [ayatanas of overpowering] arise from the power of having trained in the first two [of the eight] liberations. As for the latter four [ayatanas of overpowering], when one looks at the above big and small forms, while not entertaining the two notions of being and not being what possesses form, respectively, but solely with the notion of"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"374 Gro,undless Paths [oneself as the looker] being without fo rm, one knows blue, white, [yellow, and red] through overpowering them and sees them through overpowering them. {428} [Again,] at the end of each one, [the phrase] \"One discrimi­nates them in this way\" is added. The sfitra [in twenty-five thousand lines]784 says that, with the notion of the internal [looker] being without fo rm, one looks at external fo rms with blue color, those that display as being blue, and those from which blue light arises (for example, a flax flower, an excellent blue cotton cloth from Varat}.asi, and so on). Accordingly, with the notion of the internal [looker] being without form, one looks at externally occurring blue forms and so on, knows them through overpowering them, and so on as above. The same is said fo r yellow, red, and white by matching them with a karr:tikara [flower], a bhandujivaka flower, and the star Venus, respectively. [As for the first ayatana of overpowering, the sfitra passage] \"[With the notion of] the internal possessing form, they see [external forms]\" represents the brief introduction and the rest is the detailed explanation. The same applies for the following examples and their meanings. Here \"blue\" represents the brief introduction. \"Blue color\" refers to natural [kinds of blue] and \"those that display as being blue\" are manufactured [kinds of blue]. \"Those from which blue light arises\" refers to a [blue] lustre emitting from these [kinds of blue], which is common to both of them. \"Flower\" is the example for a natural [kind of blue] and \"cotton cloth,\" the one fo r a manufactured [kind of blue]. Therefore, the beginning and the last ones among the [above] four phrases are the ones that refer to both flower and cotton cloth, while the two middle [phrases] refer to these two individually (the same is to be understood for the other three [colors, yellow, red, and white.] These [four last ayatanas] arise from the liberation of [specific notions of] beauty. The small Brhaffika {429} refers to the following eight [ayatanas of overpowering]-the two of looking at small and big [forms] with the notions of possessing and not [pos­sessing] form, respectively, the four of looking at blue and so on, and the two [ayatanas of] overpowering in terms of space and consciousness. This accords with the [sfitra] in eighteen thousand lines.785 (7) The samadhi of dispassion consists of the samadhi and the prajfia of eradicating, based on one's dhyana, the stream of the enemies that consist of the afflictions contained within the mind streams of others.786 (8) The knowledge through aspiration consists of the samadhi and the prajfia of engaging, during the phases of satp.sara and nirvat}.a for as long as they last, in objects through being free from all mental states about char­acteristics, having overcome clinging attachment, and having accomplished one's aspiration prayers fo r eliminating the doubts of those to be guided. The nature of both this and the preceding [uncontaminated qualities] consists of calm abiding and superior insight."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 375 (9)-(10) [The supernatural knowledges and the discriminating aware­nesses] are as explained before under the knowledge of all aspects and [the complete training in] all aspects. (11) The fo ur purities in all respects refer to (1) the [physical] support (based on dhyana, having gained mastery over adopting [physical fo rms as one pleases] and abandoning [them in a timely fa shion]), (2) fo cal objects (through having gained mastery over magically creating those that do not exist and transforming those that exist), (3) mind (entering countless samadhis in each moment), and (4) wisdom (having gained mastery over immeasurable doors of dharat)i). [The phrase] \"the purity in all respects [ofj\" is to be supple­mented at the beginning787 of each one [of these fo ur]. Their nature consists of calm abiding and superior insight. (12) The masteries are tenfold. (1) Mastery over one's lifespan. consists of [being able to] discard the fo rmations of one's lifetime as one pleases. {430} (2) Mastery over mind consists of entering a mind of samadhi as one pleases. (3) Mastery over necessities consists of procuring necessities as one intends. These three are the results of generosity. For giving possessions serves as the cause fo r one's lifespan [being long], and tathagatas engage sentient beings according to the thinking of [these beings] and give them necessities as they intend. (4) Mastery over karma consists of changing physical and verbal kar­mas as one pleases. (5) Mastery pver birth consists of taking birth as any being as one pleases. [These two] are the results of ethics. For one exhorts sentient beings to [perform] flawless physical and verbal actions as one intends and one's aspiration prayers are accomplished through being endowed with eth­ics. ( 6) Mastery over creative willpower consists of transforming earth and so on into gold as one wills it. This is the result of patience because one engages sentient beings according to their wills. (7) Mastery over aspiration prayers consists of one's aspiration prayers being accomplished as one has aspired. This is the result of vigor because one has not let go of vigor for the welfare of sentient beings before. (8) Mastery over miraculous powers consists of the supernatural knowledges. This is the result of dhyana because one has rested in meditative equipoise before according to the needs of sentient beings. (9) Mastery over wisdom consists of manifesting wisdom as one pleases. (10) Mastery over the dharma consists of being able to teach the twelve branches of a buddha's speech as one pleases. {431} These two are the results of the mother because one has manifested wisdom before according to the wishes of sentient beings and has joined them with the sfitras and so on as they wish. (13)-(14) [The ten powers and the fo ur fe arlessnesses] are as explained above under the knowledge of all aspects. (15) The three ways of nothing to hide mean that the conduct of the body, speech, and mind of tathagatas is pure of flawed conduct in all respects."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"376 Groundless Paths Therefore, since tathagatas are not afraid of, or concerned about, others com­ing to know their bad mistaken conducts, they never think, \"I should keep this secret.\" (16) As for the threefold foundation of mindfulness, when teaching the dharma one is not attached to those who wish to listen and direct their ears [toward one] while being grounded in the mental state of understanding everything. One is also totally free from the opposite of that (anger [toward those who do not wish to listen]) and both attachment and anger toward those who sometimes [behave] like the former and sometimes like the latter. Thus, being endowed with mindfulness, one abides in equanimity [in this way]. ( 17) The true nature of being without forgetfulness has the defining char­acteristic of never missing the [right] time for when the welfare of sentient beings needs to be promoted. (18) The latent tendencies being overcome means that the seeds which have the nature of being the latencies of [all] afflictive and cognitive obscurations have been relinquished. Therefore, any conduct as if the afflictions had not been relinquished, though they have been relinquished, is terminated.788 \\ (19) {432} Great compassion for [all] beings is the intention of benefiting all beings through discriminating six times during day and night whose roots of virtue are mature, whose are the opposite of that, who is a vessel for the higher realms, who is a vessel for definite excellence, and so on.

Presenting them as a kaya by combining them Through the mind and mental factors (such as the factors concordant with enlightenment) of the paths of learning having changed state completely, they have become the path of completion, which has the character of the wisdoms that lack the reference points of apprehender and apprehended. All [of these wisdoms] are to be described as a kaya different [from the svabhavikak.aya], that is, the wisdom dharmakaya.789 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.2.1 .2.2. Refuting that [the svabhavikakaya and the dharmakaya] are not different This has two parts: 1) Stating the assertion 2) Refuting it"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Translations: The General Topics 377 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.2.1 .2.2.1. Stating the assertion Others than those who assert fo ur kayas-those who assert three kayas790-accept the phenomena that are the uncontaminated minds and mental fa ctors on the buddhabhftmi in a literal sense and hold that their nature of being without arising represents the svabhavikakaya. However, when the passage [of AA VIII.l-6] is explained, {433} it may be asked, \"What are the uncontami­nated phenomena that are the uncontaminated phenomena whose nature is the svabhavikakaya?\" As an answer to that, [they say that said phenomena] are explained through the fa ctors concordant with enlightenment and so on and thus link the fo rmer and the latter [verses VIII.l and VIII.2-6 of this] pas­sage. Thus, they explain that it is just their above-explained nature of being without arising that represents the dharmakaya. It may be objected that if the dharmakaya were the true nature of said bearers of this nature, it must be expressed as \"the kaya of the nature of phenomena\" (dharmatakaya), whereas [the term] \"dharmakaya\" is not tenable. [On this] they assert that, ultimately, it is the \"dharmatakaya\" -the kaya of the nature of phenomena. However, under the influence of verse composition, it is taught as \"dharmakaya\" in the root text by eliding the [Sanskrit] particle [ta that indicates a] nature. 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.2.1.2.2.2. Refuting it According to those who assert the dharmakaya and the svabhavikakaya as being one, they must undoubtedly accept [the uncontaminated minds and mental· fa ctors in AA VIII.2-6] as the buddhabhftmi. Also, they themselves accept the minds and mental factors without the duality of apprehender and apprehended that, after [all] states with stains have changed, are free from all stains and have the functions of teaching the dharma to those to be guided and so on by way of the two riipakayas appearing during the subsequent attainment that is the seeming [reality] of yogins. [However, if there are only three kayas,] it follows that [said minds and mental factors] do not exist because they are not included in any one of the three kayas. They may say, \"There is no invalidation [of there being only three kayas] because they are included in the svabhavikakaya in the manner of the nature of phenomena and the bearers of this nature being inseparable.\" [But] in that case, since the sambhogikakaya and the nairmru;tikakaya would also be like that, it would be definite that there is only a single kaya. They may say, \"This is not the case. Since the Buddha's words speak of three kayas, {434} the sambhogikakaya and the nairmru;tikakaya are presented as the seeming [reality] of yogins in the fo rm of separate kayas.\" But then, just like the sambhogikakaya and the nairmru;tikakaya, the kaya of nondual wisdom would also have to be presented as a separate kaya because the Buddha's words also speak of four kayas. If they say that said nondual wisdom consists of the sambhogikakaya and the"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"378 Groundless Paths nairm3.J].ikakaya, this is not tenable either. For the minds and mental fac­tors [of nondual wisdom] must be presented as the sage's own appearances, whereas those two kayas represent nothing but the appearances of others. 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.2.1.2.3. Rebutting disputes about their being different It may be said, \"If the kayas were four, in the brief introduction [in M 1.17], 'dharmakaya' should appear right after the svabhavikakaya, but since it does not appear [there], three kayas are justified.\" There is no flaw since the dharmakaya is mentioned right after the three [other] kayas because of three special purposes. As for these three purposes, ( 1) it is taught that the uncontaminated minds and mental factors that must definitely be accepted as the buddhabhiimi and [operate] in order to accomplish the welfare of oth­ers are not included in the three other kayas and must be combined as the dharmakaya. (2) Flaws in the composition of the verses of the [Abhisamay]­alalflkiira [must be] relinquished. (3) It is only the dharmakaya of wisdom and its deeds that are to be matched as agent and activity, respectively. These approaches of explaining the triad of refuting [the positions of others], presenting [one's own position], and rebutting [objections to the lat­ter in the context] of asserting four kayas represent the intention of master Haribhadra. {435} Aryavimuktisena and [Ratnakara]santi assert the kayas as only being three.791 2.2.2.2.1.2.3.2.1.3.

The difference between the major and the minor marks Since they point out being a mahiipuru�a, they are the major marks. Since they cause understanding in the mind streams of others, they are the minor marks. The meaning of that is that they give rise to others [seeing] the beauty of this kiiya. Furthermore, since the major marks are the primary ones, it is taught that each one arises from the causes that are the six piiramitiis. [For example,] it is said that, in due order, the results of the six [piiramitiis] in terms of the ftrQ.ii-hair at the place between the eyebrows are that it is white in color, coils to the right, is beautiful and cannot be outshined, is long, is tightly coiled and well arranged, and is surrounded by boundless light.

Since the minor marks are the retinue [of the major ones], [their being results of the six piiramitiis] is not taught in this way because they are included in the primary [marks].

(4) The serial realization represents the phases of the successive order of the three knowledges. For in order to ascertain the entities that are the realizations of the three knowledges, it sustains, in a continuous and nonregressing manner, the points of each one [of the three knowledges] and their entirety with which one has to familiarize. As for the meaning of \"each one and their entirety\" here, [the fact of] the three knowledges being contained in the [first] three clear real­izations [refers to] their combination or \"their entirety,\" while [the fact of] the paths of [the complete training in] all aspects and so on being explained in detail by way of generating bodhicitta and so on refers to \"each one.\" (5) To become fully and perfectly enlightened in a single instant represents the final phase of the three knowledges because, during the phases of [the paths of] learning, there is nothing more special to which one could proceed. (6) The dharmaka.ya, including its activity, represents the final maturation of the three knowledges because it is the final fruition of the three knowledges. The three knowledges here refer to the yogas of bodhisattvas in which they realize the threefold lack of arising.

This refers to the mere attainment of the dharmaka.ya by virtue of ascertaining the three knowledges. The Suddhamatfl31 also explains them as the common locus of the objects and the causes [of the trainings]. However, since this translation is not good, it is reasonable [to explain this] as in the translation in the Abhisamayala1pkaraloka, according to which the common locus refers to causes and trainings. 832 (2) You may wonder, \"How do [bodhisattvas] train in these objects?\" The training consists of the four such as [the complete training in] all aspects that are explained next.

It may be said, \"If the meaning of the words in all three ways of summariz­ing the clear realizations must be explained as they are explained in the section of the eight [clear realizations], it is meaningless to divide [them according to] the differences of [those with the] three faculties [of having confidence in detailed, intermediate, and brief explanations].\" As for the differences between these three, [Ar] Jangchub Yeshe833 explains the fo llowing. It is said that the great being [Maitreya]'s explanation [of the clear realizations] as eight is taught [through mainly referring to] the respective specific characteristics of the clear realizations; his presentation as six, [through mainly referring to] their definite order; and his presentation as three, through mainly referring to their definite number and the rebuttal of the flaw of repetition. {461} [This explanation] represents the final intention of the treatise. Therefore, when the defining characteristics of each [one among the eight] topics are differenti­ated, the words must be emphasized. When their definite order is taken to be primary, they are not detailed as that many words. When, through summariz­ing them into the triad of object, cause, and result, their definite number and the rebuttal [of the flaw] of repetition is taken to be primary, there are only a few words.

Paying homage (the branch of producing openness in those to be guided) She is the one who, through the all-knowledge, guides the sravakas who search for peace to utter peace. She is the one who, through the knowledge of the path, makes those who promote the benefit of beings accomplish the welfare of the world. Being united with her, 839 the sages proclaim this variety endowed with all aspects. I pay homage to this mother of the Buddha with his assemblies of srivakas and bodhisattvas. 840 The objects of paying homage through this [verse] are the three know­ledges. (1) Through the means that consist of the all-knowledge of knowing that all entities (skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas) are primordially empty of a personal self and the apprehended, respectively, she guides the persons who are sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and search for one-sided peace (their own welfare) to the two fruitions that consist of the utter peace of afflictions and suffering having subsided. (2) She is the one who, through the means that consists of the knowledge of the path of realizing that, ultimately, all three paths of sravakas, pratyeka­buddhas, and bodhisattvas are without arising and, conventionally, represent causes, fruitions, and natures, makes those persons who are bodhisattvas and desire to promote the benefit of beings for as long as the SaJllsira of those to be guided lasts accomplish the fruition that consists of the welfare of the higher realms and definite excellence841 that the whole world desires. {467} (3) Being united with the knowledge of all aspects of realizing that all aspects are without arising, the persons who are the sages (the perfect bud­dhas) endowed with the body of the perfect restraint from all mistaken behaviors of body, speech, and mind proclaim the fruition that consists of this dharma wheel of the variety of expedient and definitive meanings that is endowed with all aspects of the two realities.

[1.4] What is to be explained [here] is the praj:iiapiramiti who was praised, and to whom homage was paid, as the subject matter of the [verses of] paying homage above.

The first [are definite in number as] three-the fruition, the path, and the points to go astray. The second one [is definite in number as four]-the cause and result of generating the realizations of the path that have not yet arisen in one's mind stream and the cause and result of making those that have already arisen special. The third one is definite in number as the single fruition that is the dharmakaya. As for their [definite] order, when the three knowledges are explained in said manner they represent the order of explaining them so that the audience understands them easily, while the four trainings represent the order of the actuality of the sequence of causes and results. As for their boundary lines, the actual knowledge of all aspects exists on the buddhabhiimi; the knowledge of the path, on all five paths of the mahayana; and the knowledge of entities, on all five paths of the hinayana. [The complete training in] all aspects exists from the lesser path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum of the ten bhii.mis. The culminating [training] exists from [the level of] heat [on the path of preparation] up through the end of the continuum. As for the serial [training, in terms of] study and reflection being primary, [it exists] from the path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum, while the one that arises from meditation exists from [the"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Translations: A Word Commentary 403 level of] heat onward. The instantaneous [training] exists at the end of the ten bhumis. The dharmkaya exists solely on the buddhabhftmi. As for the rebuttal [of the criticism of there being needless] repetitions, since the three knowledges represent [the cognizing subjects of] distinct [aspects] and {472} the [complete training in] all aspects is the subject of all [aspects] without exception, the former and the latter one are not repetitious. Or these two are not repetitious because [the former] are the fully qualified objects to be known, while [the latter] teaches them by way of the training that makes them a living experience. Or they are not repetitious because [the former] represent the objects of realizing the aspect of natural utter peace, while [the latter] is the remedy that relinquishes the stains. Also, the equipment of the bhftmis and the paths of seeing and familiariza­tion that are explained under the knowledge of all aspects and the knowledge of the path are not repetitious because they have different purposes. Since the former are explained in order to define the knowledge of all aspects (the [cog­nizing] subject}, while the latter is taught through defining the knowledge of the path of knowing the three paths by way of its objects, they are not repetitious. The paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas that are explained under the knowledge of the path are [taught] for the sake of defining the knowledge of the path that is the [cognizing] subject, while what is taught under the knowledge of entities teaches the remedial knowledge of entities that is free from super­impositions. Thus, [the latter] teaches the opposites that are implied by this [remedial knowledge of entities] as being the paths of sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas and independently teaches their paths [as being separate]. Therefore, [the knowledge of the path and the knowledge of entities] are not repetitious. The knowledge of all aspects and the dharmakaya are not repetitious because they are respectively taught in terms of the object [to be known] and the fruition [to be attained], or in terms of the defining [points] and the nature. {473} 2.2.1.1.2.

[The instructions on] practice's own nature [The nature of mahayana practice] is to practice all the pure dharmas without exception that were taught [in] the twenty-two divisions of bodhicitta above [and to do so] in the manner of their being illusionlike [on the level of] the seeming and the three spheres being unobservable ultimately. This means that the six paramitas (the application [of the motivation of bodhicitta]) cause the attainment of the dharmakaya (what is to be realized) for the sake of all sentient beings (the aim). Therefore, [this practice] is more eminent than the practices of sravak.as and pratyekabuddhas. 2.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. The instructions on the four realities as its focal objects For the sake of stopping clinging to the reality of suffering as what is to be understood, one is instructed in the inseparability of the emptiness of form and so on (the object) and prajfiaparamita (the subject). For the sake of stopping clinging to the origin [of suffering] as what is to be relinquished, one is instructed that form and so on, which serve as the causes of what is contaminated, are not established as arising, ceasing, and the origin [of suf­fering]. In order to put an end to clinging to cessation as what is to be attained, one is instructed that no phenomenon whatsoever (from form up through enlightenment) is established. {479} In order to put an end to clinging to the path as what is to be relied on in one's mind stream, one is instructed that [bodhisattvas] do not really see any so-called making or not making efforts in [practicing] the path (the six paramitas and so on). 2.2.1.2.1.1.2.1.3. The instructions on the three jewels as its foundation In order to put an end to clinging to relying on the Buddha as one's refuge and thinking, \"I am the teacher who knows all objects of refuge without excep­tion,\" it is taught that \"being a buddha\" refers to the final wisdom of knowing that subject and object are not established as separate, but are equality. In order to put an end to clinging to the jewel of the dharma, thinking, \"This is my path,\" it is taught that the entities, the remedies, and the aspects that are taken as objects by the three knowledges, respectively, lack any real nature.

[The instructions on] relinquishing the antagonistic factors of practice The nature of practice is [threefold] vigor and its factors to be relinquished are the three [kinds ofj laziness. Among these, one is first instructed in the vigor of nondinging as the means to relinquish clinging to idleness. Since those with dull faculties cling to the arising of the happiness of the three gates, in order to dispel that [clinging] it is taught that body, speech, and mind lack any nature of something to cling to. Secondly, one is instructed in untiring vigor as the means to relinquish the laziness of discouragement. When having cultivated the path for a long time and having still not accomplished enlightenment as the goal that they desire, those with dull faculties who have the character of being fearful and trembling become very depressed due to being conceited about having done practice for so long. In order to dispel that [depression], it is taught that there is nothing to be conceited about in any phenomenon from fo rm up through enlightenment. Thirdly, one is instructed in the vigor of fully embracing the path as the means to relinquish the laziness of self-contempt. One [may] become faint­hearted, [thinking,] \"If it is necessary to request, for each point to be taught, instructions on practicing the path from the buddhas and bodhisattvas who dwell in the ten directions, I am not able to do this.\" In order to dispel that [faintheartedness], it is taught that one should train through realizing that [all] phenomena are unarisen by nature. {481} 2.2.1 .2.1.1.2. 1.4.2. [The instructions on] being independent of others in one's practice [These consist ofj the instructions on the five visions, in which one trains as follows.

[The instructions on] completing all qualities of practice The instructions on the six supernatural knowledges consist of the following teaching. In order to establish sentient beings in the equality of phenomena, be loved by all noble beings, encounter pleasant objects, be worthy of the gods paying homage, and attain the prophecy [about enlightenment], through rely­ing on the four pure dhyanas one generates the six supernatural knowledges in one's mind stream and realizes that, ultimately, they are the utter primor­dial peace of reference points. 2.2.1.2.1.1.2. 1.4.4. The instructions on the causes of the final practice [These consist of] the two instructions on the path of seeing and the path of familiarization. The first one is the teaching that one, in order to relinquish the factors to be relinquished that are the factors to be relinquished through see­ing, should cultivate the nature of the sixteen moments of the path of seeing. {482} The second one is the teaching that one, for the sake of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished that are the factors to be relinquished through familiarization, should cultivate the mahayana path of familiarization-the means to make oneself familiar with the very realization that one had realized on the path of seeing before. Said [instructions] are definite as ten in number because they respectively represent the aspect of practice, its focal object, its foundation, relinquishing adverse conditions, and bringing about favorable conditions. 848 2.2.1.2.1.1.2.2.

[1.24] The basis of division here is the sa�pgha of irreversible mahayana noble ones. When divided, there are twenty [kinds of such noble ones] -seventeen that are covered by the words of the root text and three that are easy to understand and [thus] taught implicitly. In general, these [twenty can be categorized as] five-(1) stream-enterers, (2) once-returners, (3) nonreturners, (4) approach­ing arhats, and (5) pratyekabuddhas. (1) There are five [stream-enterers]. Approaching stream-enterers are twofold. Those of duller faculties are those who pursue by means of confi­dence-they abide in [any one of the first] fifteen moments of the path of seeing and make efforts in order to accomplish the relinquishment and realization of a stream-enterer. Those of sharper faculties are those who pursue by means of the dharma. The one [type of] mere abiders in the result [of a stream-enterer consists of] those who abide in the sixteenth moment of the path of seeing and have not relinquished even one [degree] of the factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through familiarization. {483} The two special abiders in the result [of a stream-enterer] are [those who are born] from family to family among gods and those who are born from family to family among humans. (2) Once-returners are threefold. [There is only] one [type] of approaching once-returners-both those of duller faculties who are convinced through confidence (those who have relinquished [up through] the fifth [degree] of the aftlictions of the desire realm of the path of familiarization and make efforts in order to attain the result of a once-returner) and those of sharper faculties who attain through seeing are alike [in this regard]. Abiders in the result [of a once-returner] are twofold. Mere abiders in the result of a once­returner are those who abide in the path of liberation of having relinquished the sixth [degree] of the aftlictions of the desire realm. Special abiders in this result are those with a single interval for whom there is [only] a single rebirth in the desire realm left. (3) Nonreturners [are tenfold]. Approaching nonreturners are those of duller and sharper faculties who are convinced through confidence and attain through seeing, respectively-they have relinquished the seventh or eighth [degree] of the afflictions of the desire realm and make efforts in relinquish­ing the ninth one. Those who abide in the result of a nonreturner are those who have relinquished the ninth [degree] of the afflictions of the desire realm. They are ninefold. Those who pass into nirviil)a in the intermediate state have relinquished the fetters of being born in the form [realm], but have not relinquished the fetters through which its intermediate state is formed.

Those who pass into nirv8I}.a after being born, by virtue of not having relinquished both of said fetters, end suffer­ing after being born in the form [realm]. Those who pass into nirvaQ.a with effort do so through having manifested the path with exertion after being born in the fo rm [realm]. Those who pass into nirvaQ.a without effort do so without exertion. The three leapers who progress to Akani�tha are leapers (progressing from Brahmakiyika to Akani�tha), {484} half-leapers (progress­ing from Brahmakiyika to certain ones among the pure abodes and then to Akani�tha), and those who die in, and transit through, all abodes (progressing to Akani�tha via all abodes [of the form realm]).

They are twofold-those who [attain] peace amidst visible phenomena attain nirv8I}.a in this lifetime and those who are a bodily witness witness the meditative absorption of cessation through their bodies. ( 4) Approaching arhats are those who have relinquished the eighth [degree] of the factors of the Peak of Existence to be relinquished through familiariza­tion and make efforts in relinquishing the ninth one. (5) The rhinolike are those who will become pratyekabuddhas when there are no buddhas. Among these, those who progress to the Peak of Existence, through having accomplished the states of mind of the dhyanas and formless [absorptions], possess the ability to progress there, but one can understand through their sub­divisions that noble bodhisattvas are not actually born in the fo rmless [realm]. 2.2.1.2.1.1.3.

(3) [Its serving as] causes is that it gives rise to [all] types of realizations of the three yanas in a complete manner. (4) Being men­tored refers to being kept from [falling into] satpsiiric existence and peace by virtue of being skilled in means. (5) What is to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization consists of the conceptions that are associated with, and based on, the path of preparation in due number. [Some] assert that [its] division into lesser, medium, and great [degrees] is also a distinctive feature. Accordingly, by virtue of these six distinctive features, compared to the [levels of] heat and so on of sriivakas and pratyekabuddhas (illustrated by the rhinolike ones), a protecting bodhisattva's [levels of] heat and so on are more distinguished.850 For [on their paths of preparation,] sriivakas and so on focus on the sheer four realities as what is to be determined. [These paths] bear the aspects of persons lacking a self by way of being impermanent and so on. They are the causes that give rise to only the types of realization of the hinayana.

[I.28ab] As for the focal objects and aspects of lesser heat, the sixteen [aspects] such as impermanence, which are the substrates of the four realities, are the bases based on which superimpositions are to be cut through through understand­ing. Therefore, the fo cal objects are impermanence and so on. Their aspects are to refrain from great, medium, and lesser clinging to them (clinging [to them through mistaken views], abiding [in them through a mistaken mind], and understanding [them through mistaken discriminations]). [The phrase] \"The cause fo r attaining all three yinas\" represents the distinctive feature of [lesser heat] being a cause [for the path of seeing], which also applies to all following [levels of the path of preparation]. As for the focal objects and aspects of medium heat, the focal objects are fo rm and so on being specified by lacking rising (affirmation) and falling (negation) in true reality. The aspects are that, in true reality, [form and so on] lack nonabiding (operating as something dissimilar from the continua [that their] names [suggest]) and are without abiding (being something similar to the continua [that their] names [suggest]). As fo r great heat, its focal objects are the conventional phenomena that are imputed as designations-the phenomena that are specified by the mere names of form up through the knowledge of all aspects.

Not abiding in fo rm and so on Is their lack of nature by virtue of being such. [1.28cd] These two having a common nature, There is no abiding in their being impermanent and such.

Its aspect is that, within the nature of a single [phenomenon] (such as form) being emptiness, all [phenomena] have a common nature in that they are emptiness. Therefore, there is no abiding in these [phenomena's] being real as permanent, impermanent, and such. As for medium peak, the focal objects are form and so on being specified by being without difference-ultimately, impermanent [phenomena] and so on and their emptiness of being empty of an own-being have a mutually com­mon nature.

As for the focal objects and aspects of great poised readiness, its focal objects are fo rm and so on being specified by being without characteristics­their being empty of anything that could be grasped as any phenomenon with characteristics.

Its aspect is the realization that what constitutes the path of seeing-the supreme means for accomplishing buddhahood-is the path of nonconceptuality even within the samadhi that is the [cognizing] subject of [realizing that] all phenomena to be examined [in it] as focal objects do not exist ultimately.854 During medium poised readiness, one focuses by way of the cause; during lesser supreme dharma, by way of the result; during lesser poised readiness, by way of the nature; and during the remaining nine, {490} by way of [vari­ous] aspects of the nature of phenomena. 855 The summary of these [four factors conducive to penetration] is as follows. These are the lesser, medium, and great degrees Of the factors conducive to penetration. [I.33cd] Penetration refers to the uncontaminated path of seeing. The branches conducive to penetration are the factors that are conducive to the [path of seeing] or that serve as its causes. On the path of accumulation, one familiar­izes with all phenomena through determining them as being without nature. Through this, the clear illumination of the apprehended lacking real existence is brought forth for the first time and then this clear illumination intensifies, which respectively represent [the levels of] heat and peak. The first arising and the intensification of the clear illumination of the apprehender lacking real existence respectively represent [the levels of] poised readiness and the supreme dharma.

(a) The nine conceptions about the apprehender in terms of a substantially existent person (the apprehender) are the conceptions about [the self being] a substance [in the sense of] (1) the self being an independent [apprehender] that is not contingent on anything else, (2) the self being something singular without a companion, (3) the self being the cause that provides the room for consciousness, (4) the self being the watcher up through the knower, (5) the self being the support of being afflicted in satp.sara, ( 6) the self being the sup­port of becoming free from attachment to the [respectively lower mundane] cessations [that are attained] through the path of the mundane dhyanas and fo rm[less absorptions], (7) the self being the support of the path of seeing that directly sees the characteristics of the four realities, (8) the self being the support of the path of familiarization, whose nature consists of the [eight] liberations [and the ninefold] progressive abiding, and (9) the self being the support of the path of nonlearning. These [conceptions] cling to afflicted and purified supports as being some substance that serves as the sheer phenom­enon which is the apprehender. (b) The conceptions about the apprehender in terms of an imputedly existent individual as the apprehender are the nine [types of clinging to] (1)­(3) skandhas, ayatanas, and dhatus (the bases of designating sheer sentient beings), (4) [the twelve links of] dependent origination (the bases of desig­nating [sheer] ordinary beings), {493} (5) the purified phenomena [of the thirty-seven dharmas concordant with enlightenment] (the bases of designat­ing sheer noble ones), (6) [the path of] seeing, [the path of] familiarization, and the special path (the bases of respectively designating inferior, middling, and supreme noble learners), and (9) the path of nonlearning (the basis of designating noble arhats). [These conceptions] ding to sentient beings in general and in specific through thinking of them as apprehenders by way of merely imputing [such apprehenders] onto said [nine] bases of designating. 858 2.2.1.2.1.1.3.2.3.

[1.36] [Bodhisattvas may be] cowed due to fearing emptiness (which is not some­thing to fear), afraid due to fearing [emptiness], and terrified due to fixating on that fear. That those on the mahayana path of preparation are mentored means that [their spiritual friends] are endowed with the three distinctive fea­tures [that serve] as the remedies for said three [fears]-the skill in means that causes the minds of those to be guided to not be intimidated, afraid, and terrified by emptiness, to teach the lack of nature of all phenomena and so on according to the thinking of those to be guided, and to make those to be guided attain the higher realms and definite excellence through abandoning the antagonistic fa ctors (such as miserliness) of the paramitas.859 Though the teacher of both the hinayana and the mahayana is one and the same (the Buddha), there are differences in the manner of him being a men­tor. For through this [mahayana mentoring], [bodhisattvas] on the path of preparation are mentored by way of their giving rise to the following three­the generation of bodhicitta that fo cuses on the knowledge of all aspects, the prajfta of realizing that phenomena are not observable, and the dedication of turning over [all] roots of virtue to [the attainment of] the knowledge of all aspects. {494} On the other hand, he does not mentor sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas in this way.

Next, they fo cus on both (6)-(7) the factors of the supramundane path that are to be relinquished (contaminated phenomena, which do not function as remedies for a personal self) and the nature of the supramundane path (uncontami­nated phenomena, which function as the remedies fo r a personal self).

Great mind is the dharma that makes one a buddha (the highest of all sentient beings)-great compassion and its [mental] associates during the phases of cause and fruition. Great relinquishment consists of teaching the dharma in order to relinquish all views and relinquishing the two obscurations together with their latent tendencies. Great realization consists of lacking any clinging to bodhicitta and so on and, through realizing the entirety of suchness and variety, being free from attachment to any objects.863 2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.

[In particular,] generosity refers to dedicating roots of virtue to [all] sentient beings. Ethics means to relinquish the states of mind of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Patience is to tolerate abuse, suffering, and so on. Vigor is the intense striving fo r virtue. Dhyana is the one-pointed mind with regard to the knowledge of all aspects. Prajfta refers to dedicating without conceiving of the three spheres. Through the divisions of these six, [the paramitas in the armor like practice] are thirty-six.864 2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.2. The practice of engagement Dhyanas and fo rmless states, generosity and such, Path, love and so fo rth, Not having anything as a fo cal object, Purity of the three spheres, [1.44] Aim, the six supernatural knowledges, And the principle of the knowledge of all aspects-One should know that the practice of engagement refers to these, Which means mounting the mahiyina. [1.45] ( 1) First, through the mind being distracted toward sense pleasures, it is not able to attain any qualities. Therefore, in order to stabilize it on [its virtu­ous] focal objects, [bodhisattvas] enter, and rise from, the samadhis of the fo ur dhyinas and the four fo rmless states, which they practice through being endowed with the six paramitas. (2) Thereafter, since those whose minds are stable in this way train in the two accumulations, they engage in the six paramitas (generosity and such) by way of being pure of the three spheres. (3) Since the strong aspiration for the actuality of true reality arises [in] those who gather the [two] accumulations, they engage in the path of realizing this [actuality], which primarily consists of [the paths of] seeing and familiariza­tion. (4) Since enthusiasm fo r the welfare of others arises [in] those who see the nature of phenomena themselves, they engage in the fo ur immeasurables through being endowed with the six paramitas. {499} (5) Since the fetter of their engaging in the welfare of others is clinging, they engage in not hav­ing any among all phenomena as a fo cal object.

(7) Those who engage in such a way engage in their own aim-the three greatnesses of the ultimate relinquishment of clinging. (8) Through those who make efforts toward said aim making efforts in order to attain the six supernatural knowledges, they engage in the six supernatural knowledges. (9) Since strong enthusiasm for the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects arises [in] those who attained the supernatural knowledges, they engage in the knowledge of all aspects.

They accomplish the happiness of the given time (the wishes [of others] being fulfilled right upon [bodhisattvas having practiced] generos­ity), the happiness in the future ([others] assuming bodies within the higher realms by virtue of [bodhisattvas] having established them in ethics), the hap­piness of being absolutely certain by virtue of the triad of patience, vigor, and dhyana accomplishing results in accordance with their causes, {500} and the lasting happiness of attaining the definite excellence of absolutely not return­ing to sarpsira by virtue of [bodhisattvas] having established them in prajfia. (8) Since samadhi arises in those who are endowed with the six paramitas (the means), they [cultivate] the calm abiding of being one-pointed toward"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"428 Groundless Paths the welfare of others. (9) Since superior insight arises [in] those who have attained this [calm abiding], they [cultivate] the superior insight of realizing that the objects of calm abiding are not observable. (10) [Since] it is possible for those who focus on this kind of emptiness to fall into inferior yanas, they [cultivate] the union of not fa lling into the extremes of [srupsiiric] existence and peace through means and prajfia. ( 11) Those who are endowed with this [union possess] the skill in means of promoting the welfare of others through mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects. (12) Those who know this [skill in means] train in emptiness, which is the equipment of wisdom. (13) For those who are fa miliar with this, merit arises from promoting the wel­fa re of others through perfect prajfia and samadhi, which is the equipment of merit.

This is the equipment of the path. (15) Those who are endowed with the path will attain the dhiiraJJ.i of infinite recall (the cause for teaching the dharma for many eons), which is the equipment of dharaJJ.i. (16} The [progressive] phases of realization of those who attain dhiiraJJ.i function as the foundations of the respectively following qualities, which represent the equipment of the bhdmis. (17) The equipment of the remedies [is taught] through the divisions of the phases of relinquish­ing the factors to be relinquished on the respective bhumis. These seventeen are called \"the practice of the equipments.\" [The Sanskrit] sa111bhara [means] \"equipment,\" {501} with sam [being glossed as] \"perfect accomplishment\" (samudagama); bha, as \"true state\" (bhava}; and ra, as \"seizing\" (sambhriyate). Thus, this is the practice of the equipments because it seizes the true state of what perfectly accomplishes great enlightenment by way of practicing the entire mahayana without excep­tion through the two realities. It should be known as this progression that is seventeenfold in number.866 2.2.1.2.1.1.4.4.3.2.

You may wonder, \"What are these ten?\" They are (1) the intention that is hot mixed with the states of mind of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas who prioritize their own welfare, (2) seizing the things that are beneficial for oneself and oth­ers-the mahayana dharma as the cause of the knowledge of all aspects, (3) an equal mind toward all sentient beings by way of the four immeasurables, ( 4) giving away all material things by virtue of not conceiving of the three spheres, (5) delighting the [spiritual] friends who exhort one toward the knowledge of all aspects, (6) searching for the genuine dharma contained in the three yanas as focal object and not fa lling into the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, {502} (7) taking ordination in the teachings of the Buddha through being endowed with a constant mindset of leaving one's home, (8) mentally engaging in the buddhakiya through constantly longing for accom­plishing it and delighting in it when seen, (9) teaching the genuine dharma that is virtuous in the beginning, the middle, and the end, and (10) speaking the truth that does not deceive others, as one has promised. Through these ten, [bodhisattvas] realize that all said objects of purification are not observ­able as any real nature whatsoever.

The path of familiarization as rejoicing [Rejoicing] has the nature of the [mental] openness that bears the aspect of delighting in the roots of virtue of oneself and others. Through both means and nonobservation, One rejoices in roots of virtue. The mental engagement in rejoicing Is stated here to be familiarization. [11.24] One rejoices in roots of virtue through means and rejoices in roots of virtue through nonobservation. This is stated here in the treatise or the sfitras to be the mental engagement in rejoicing. It represents the twofold rejoicing that respectively has the seeming and the ultimate as its objects. In this way, said three [types of] the contaminated path of familiarization constitute the element of subsequent attainment, which entails conceptions of dualistic appearances. In due order, the functions of these three are as follows. The first one gathers new merit, just like a lump of gold coming forth from a mine. The second one makes this merit into branches of perfect enlighten­ment, just like a goldsmith transforming unwrought gold into an ornament. Through the third one, the merit of oneself and others is attained equally. As for the latter two, the virtue of dedication {525} is increased through rejoicing and the virtue of rejoicing is increased through dedication. Therefore, these two are connected [in such a way that it makes] no difference [which one comes] first [and which one] last.905"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Translations: A Word Commentary 451 2.2.1.2. 1 .2.2.3.2.2.2.

Since there is only a single stain to be purified, these two purities are not different because they do not exist as the duality of apprehender and apprehended, cannot be made two through the mind, and do not have dis­similar natures. They are indivisible because they do not have many branches or parts. In this mahayana, since there are no external objects except as mere appearances of the mind, {527} once the mind is pure, appearances are pure [too].

[IV.1] The specific instances of the wisdom of cognizing entities (the aspects of the four realities) represent \"aspects.\" This is the defining characteristic of aspects in general. When classified, these aspects are asserted as three kinds for the reason that the omniscience& are of three kinds.936 2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.

[IV.2] The fo ur aspects of the reality of suffering are (1) not existing as something permanent, (2) not arising ultimately, (3) being free from a self that is another referent, and, (4) not being subdued by the flaw of conceiving of a self. {540} The four aspects of the origin [of suffering] are (5) lacking a basis for the production of name and form ultimately, ( 6) lacking coming and going, just like space, (7) inner expressions, examinations, and analyses being inexpress­ible because they do not exist, and (8) the craving that is the condition for rebirth and arises from feelings not [even] existing as a name. The four aspects of cessation are (9) lacking going anywhere ultimately, ( 10) not being carried away by dualistic appearances, ( 11) being inexhaustible since it has the nature of the dharmadhatu, (12) being without arising since"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Translations: A Word Commentary 465 there is no producing cause. These [aspects] match the well-known aspects of the respective realities in accordance with their enumeration. As for the aspects of the reality of the path, the four aspects of there not being a self that is (13) an agent, (14) a cognizer, (15) one who transits higher, or (16) a subduer of the afflictions, in due order, match the four [aspects of the reality of the path] such as \"path.\" They represent the uncontaminated path of the hinayana that is the remedy for the afflictive obscurations. The aspects of the contaminated subsequent attainment of the path of familiarization that is the remedy for the cognitive obscurations are the fol­lowing five. (17) Just as in a dream, outer apprehended [objects] appear, but have no real existence. (18) Just like an echo, they do not arise from a real cause. (19) Just like an optical illusion, their manner of appearing is unim­peded. (20) Just as in a mirage, [all] reference points [with regard to them] are at peace. (21) Just like an illusion, they are natural nirv�a. The six aspects of [outer apprehended objects] (22) not existing as afflicted phenomena, (23) not existing as purified phenomena, (24) being untainted because of their nature being luminosity, {541} (25) lacking the elaborations of divisions, (26) lacking anything to be conceited about realization, and (27) being immovable emptiness represent the uncontaminated path of seeing that is the remedy for the six cognitive obscurations of clinging to real exis­tence with regard to what is to be rejected, what is to be adopted, what is stained, the elaborations of the five skandhas, realization, and the nature of emptiness deteriorating. 937 2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Detailed explanation of the aspects of the knowledge of the path In terms of the cause, the path, suffering, And cessation, in due order, They are said to be eight, seven, Five, and sixteen. [IV.3] The reality of the origin [of suffering] is taught by way of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies; the reality of the path, by way of theses and their justifications; the reality of suffering, by way of general and specific characteristics; and the reality of cessation, by way of emptiness. 1) The eight [aspects of the reality of suffering] are as follows. The three aspects of (1) being free from desire, (2) not dwelling [on objects] through clinging, and (3) characteristics and flaws being at utter peace are the rem­edies for three causes938-striving, desire, and delighting in rebirths. The three aspects of (4) lacking desire, (5) lacking hatred, and (6) lacking ignorance"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"466 Groundless Paths are the remedies for the three [corresponding] origins [of suffering]-desire, hatred, and ignorance. (7) The aspect of lacking afflictions because of being free from their cause-improper mental engagement-is the remedy for the imagination of the arising [of suffering]. (8) The aspect of the lack of real sentient beings is the remedy for the condition that consists of the views about a real personality. 2) As for the aspects of the reality of the path, (9) the aspect of being immeasurable {542} teaches the nature of path-the mahayana that provides the opportunity for all sentient beings [to progress to buddhahood]. (10) The aspect of being disconnected from the two extremes teaches the reason for [this path] providing said opportunity because of not clinging to [satpsaric] existence and peace. ( 11) The aspect of not being different teaches the nature of appropriateness-realizing that all phenomena without exception are not different in their being the dharmadhatu. (12) [The aspect of] no clinging to superiority teaches the reason for the mahayana being the realization of everything without exception [being the dharmadhatu] because of not being content with the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. (13) [The aspect of] nonconceptuality teaches the nature of the accomplishment of realizing identitylessness. (14) [The aspect of] being unassessable teaches the reason for not conceiving of the nature of phenomena through clinging to it as an object that can be known. (15) The aspect of lacking attachment teaches what is conducive to deliverance-being free from attachment to any phenomena. For this, [the sfitras] do not state a reason. 3) The five aspects of the reality of suffering are the four of being (16) impermanent, (17) suffering, (18) empty, and identityless (its specific charac­teristics) as well as (20) the aspect of all these not having any characteristics of being established by a nature of their own. 4) As for the sixteen aspects of the reality of cessation, (21)-(23) the empti­nesses of the internal, the external, and both are the three aspects of cessation that are characterized by the cessation of contaminated entities. (24)-(31) The eight [aspects of] the emptinesses of emptiness, the great, the ultimate, condi­tioned and unconditioned phenomena, what is beyond extremes, { 543} what is without beginning and end, and what is not rejected are the eight aspects of the eight [kinds of] clinging of superimposing [something] onto these eight being at peace. (32) The emptiness of the primordial nature is the one aspect of excellence-the lack of an agent being pure as natural emptiness. The [last] four [teach the aspect of final deliverance.] (33)-(35) The three emptinesses of all phenomena, specifically characterized phenomena, and the unobserv­able [teach the aspect of] how [cessation] is final deliverance because they put an end to the three [kinds of] mistakenness about imputations, characteris­tics, and time.

[Detailed explanation of] the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects Starting with the fo undations of mindfulness And ending with the aspects of buddhahood, In approximate concordance with the reality of the path, And distinguished through the threefold omniscience [IV.4] Of disciples, bodhisattvas, And buddhas, in due order, They are asserted as thirty-seven, Thirty-four, and thirty-nine. [IV.S] [Within the scope of the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects,] the thirty­seven aspects of the knowledge of entities consist of the four fo undations of mindfulness (the path of examining entities), the four correct efforts (the path that arises from effort), the four limbs of miraculous powers (the path of training in samadhi), the five faculties (the path of preparing for dear realiza­tion), the five powers (the path of connecting with clear realization), the seven branches of enlightenment (the path of clear realization), and the eightfold path [of the noble ones] (the path that is conducive to pure final deliverance). The thirty-four aspects of the knowledge of the path consist of the three doors to liberation (the path of the remedies), the [first] three liberations (the path of manifesting), the remaining five liberations (the path of blissfully abiding amidst visible phenomena), {544} the nine meditative absorptions (the supramundane path), the four dharma readinesses (the path of relin­quishment), and the ten paramitas (the path of buddhahood).

You may wonder, \"What is the manner of bodhisattvas familiarizing with these aspects of the knowledge of all aspects?\" In general, the familiarization of bodhisattvas is of four kinds. The familiarization of mentally engaging in aspiring [for true reality] refers to mind arising as a mere likeness of what it familiarizes with.

The familiarization of analyzing defining characteristics refers to mentally engaging in, and analyzing through discriminating prajfta, the defining characteristics of certain clear realizations that have arisen in one's mind stream, [thinking,] \"They are such and such.\" The familiarization through aspiration prayers means to mentally aspire to attain certain states and gather the accumulations fo r that sake. {545} Among these, up through the seventh bhlimi, the types of realization that consist of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path in the context of the knowledge of all aspects arise as mere likenesses and thus are [cases ot] the familiarization of mentally engaging in aspiring [for true reality].

The training's own nature Because of not abiding in fo rm and so on, Because of having stopped involvement in them, Because of their suchness being profound, Because of their being difficult to fathom, [IV.8] Because of their being immeasurable, Because of realization being slow and full of hardships, Because of the prophecy, irreversibility, Final deliverance, no obstructions, [IV.9] Being close to enlightenment, swift, The welfare of others, without increase and decrease, Not seeing dharmas or nondharmas and so on, Not seeing the inconceivability of form and so on, [IV.lO] Because of not conceiving the characteristics Or the being of fo rm and such, Bestowing precious fruitions, Purity, and a set period of time. [IV.ll] [The nature of the training is divided into] (a) the five [trainings] in terms of the manner in which the training is produced and (b) the fifteen trainings that arise [based on that].

(4) The training in the knowledge of the path being difficult to fathom consists of realizing that their nature is difficult to fathom. (5) The training in the immeasurability of the knowledge of all aspects consists of realizing that their nature is immeasurable. These five that are described in such a way are [like that] because [the Aloka]942 teaches that if one familiarizes with the threefold lack of arising through not clinging to subjects and objects, the trainings in realizing the three such as profundity arise. They are also called \"the five natural trainings\" because they exist on all [levels of the path] from a beginner up through the tenth bhtimi."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"470 Groundless Paths (b) The trainings that are produced by these means are fifteen. (6) The training in which realization is slow and full of hardships refers to practicing with the arising of fe ar, terror, and great terror with regard to prajfiaparamita being profound and so on. [It exists] in [bodhisattvas] on the path of accumu­lation with dull faculties. (7) The training in attaining the prophecy refers to practicing without any fear and so on of the threefold lack of arising. {547} [It exists in bodhisattvas] on the path of accumulation with sharp faculties and [in others] from heat onward because they are prophesied [to attain buddha­hood] no later than after three tathagatas [have appeared]. (8) The training in irreversibility (from peak onward) refers to [making one's realization of prajfiaparamita irreversible through] having heard about the mother and then correctly retaining her up through mentally engaging in her in a proper man­ner. (9) The training in final deliverance (on [the level of] poised readiness) is the final deliverance from the phenomena that obstruct the knowledge of all aspects-the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. (10) The training in no obstructions (on [the level of] the supreme dharma) refers to familiarizing with the freedom from reference points during meditative equipoise and dur­ing activities such as explaining and retaining the mother during subsequent attainment because it joins one with the path of seeing without obstructions. (11) The training in being close to enlightenment (from the path of seeing onward) represents the support of newly attaining the uncontaminated dhar­mas of the mahayana as well as the support of uncontaminated [dharmas] arising from then onward. (12) The training in swift fully perfect enlightenment (from the second up through the seventh bhumis) refers to the accomplish­ment of the fruition of the training-dharmakaya, sambhogika[kaya], and nairmat;tika[kaya]. (13) The training in the welfare of others consists of turn­ing the wheel of dharma and encouraging beings, for the sake of their benefit and happiness. (14) The training without increase and decrease means to see increase and decrease with regard to qualities and flaws, respectively, but not seeing any increase, decrease, arising, ceasing, being afflicted, or being puri­fied in the nature of phenomena. (15) The training in not abiding in the two extremes refers to not observing dharmas [(virtues]), nondharmas [(nonvir­tues)], the three realms, and so on. (16) The training in the lack of conceit about the nature of phenomena consists of lacking the conceit of clinging to the nature of fo rm, feeling, and so on as being inconceivable, unassessable, and unthinkable. {548} (17) The training in not conceiving of [form and so on] as the bearers of the nature of phenomena refers to not conceiving the characteristics (the causes) or the being of fo rm, feeling, and such. [These last] five [exist] from the eighth bhUmi onward.

For at this point [bodhisattvas] have attained the four discriminating awarenesses and thereby mature sentient beings [in accordance with their individual capaci­ties]. (19) The training in purity ([on] the tenth bhumi) consists of purifying the subtle obscurations that are the impregnations of negative tendencies. These are the fourteen situational trainings. (20) The training in a set period of time refers to not abandoning one's efforts in writing the mother and so on for [a set number of] years, months, or days.

[IV.23] In this way, through the defining characteristic of knowledge, the general nature of the [mahayana] training is defined as merely being what gives rise to buddhahood. However, this does not function as an exclusion of possession by others [in the sense of] \"This alone is what gives rise [to buddhahood].\" Thus, here the defining characteristic of the distinctiveness [of the mahayana training] is explained. This refers to the explanation of the distinctiveness of the sixteen moments [of the mahayana path of seeing] that have the four realities as their objects and are distinguished through the sixteen distinctive features of inconceivability and so on.957 2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.4.1.3.2.2.2.

The defining characteristic of activity You may wonder, \"As for these trainings that, through the defining charac­teristic of distinctiveness, are to be understood as being more eminent than [those of] sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, what is their activity of accomplish­ing the benefit of others?\" Representing benefit, happiness, protection, The refuge and place of rest fo r humans, An aid and an island, Acting as the leader, [IV.27] Being spontaneously present, having the character of not manifesting The fruition through the three yanas, And, lastly, the activity of being a resource959-These represent the defining characteristic of activity. [IV.28] {559} [There] are three [activities] through buddhas and bodhisattvas (the supports) relying on the training in the knowledge of entities (the means). (1) They accomplish the nirvat}.a in which the suffering of [ satp.saric] existence is at peace, which is the future benefit of those to be guided (the objects) in their later [lives]. (2) At present, they establish [beings] in being free from unhap­piness ([physical] suffering and mental displeasure) in this life and, finally, they establish them in nirvat}.a. (3) They protect all sentient beings from all satp.saric suffering and establish them in the nirvat}.a without remainder. [There] are seven [activities] through [buddhas and bodhisattvas] relying on the training in the knowledge of the path. ( 4) They establish sentient beings in the paramita of genuine bliss through protecting them from the phenomena of birth, aging, sickness, and death. (5) Through teaching that phenomena are without arising and ceasing, they serve as a place of rest for sentient beings who cling to [real] entities (the cause of suffering). (6) Through realizing that satp.sara, nirvat}.a, what is to be adopted, and what is to be rejected are equality in that they do not exist, [buddhas and bodhisattvas] are the aids of sentient beings. (7) Through the nonabiding nirvat}.a (the termination of the mois­ture of craving for the former and later extremes of [ sarpsaric] existence and peace) serving as the cause and foundation for themselves and others attain­ing higher realms and definite excellence, they are islands fo r sentient beings."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"482 Groundless Paths (8) They accomplish the welfare of others that consists of leading those to be guided to liberation through teaching that fo rm and so on are without arising, ceasing, being afflicted, and being purified. (9) They spontaneously engage in the welfare of sentient beings through teaching that all phenomena are like space and through engaging [in them] in an effortless manner. {560} (10) Through teaching the dharmas that are the aspects of the knowledge of the path, fo r the welfare of others, [those to be guided] are delivered through the three yanas, while [buddhas and bodhisattvas] do not manifest the fruition of these [yanas] fo r their own welfare. [There] is one [activity] through relying on the training in the knowledge of all aspects. ( 11) The activity of being a resource is to demonstrate that all phenomena do not go beyond the natural mode of being of the knowledge of all aspects. Through these eleven, the trainings in the three knowledges in one's own mind stream are defined as possessing the power to produce the special welfare of others. Therefore, they represent the defining characteristic of activity.960 2.2.1 .2.2.1.1.1.4. 1 .3.2.4. The defining characteristic of nature You may wonder, \"What is the nature of these trainings that, through the eleven defining characteristics of activity, are to be understood as having the power to produce the consummate welfare of others?\" Being devoid of afflictions, signs, characteristics, And antagonistic factors and remedies, Hard to be done, devoted in an exclusive manner, Aim, nonobservation, [IV.29] Refraining from clinging, What is discerned as the focal object, Being antagonistic, unobstructed, Without ground, without going and without arising, [IV.30] And not observing suchness­This sixteenfold nature Is defined as something like a definiendum, And thus is held to be the fourth defining characteristic. [IV.31] ( 1) Being devoid of afflictions is to be empty of any manifest nature of afflictions (such as attachment). (2) Being devoid of signs is to be empty of the results of these afflictions (the impregnations of negative tendencies of body, speech, and mind). (3) Being devoid of characteristics is to be empty of improper mental"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Translations: A Word Commentary 483 engagement (clinging to purity, happiness, permanence, a self, and so on) as the cause or characteristic of these afflictions. These are the three [ways] of being devoid of afflictive obscurations. (4) Being devoid of antagonistic fa ctors and remedies is to be empty of clinging to neither afflictions (the antagonistic fac­tors) nor the factors that are without afflictions (the remedies). This is the one [way] of being devoid of cognitive obscurations. Together, [these four make up] the fourfold nature of the training in the all-knowledge. {561} (5) Hard to be done means that, ultimately, there is no armor to be donned for the welfare of others, but, seemingly, one dons the armor for bringing all sentient beings to nirvat}.a. ( 6) Being devoted in an exclusive manner961 is to abide in the mahayana without falling into inferior paths. (7) The aim is to strive for the three greatnesses that are to be accomplished during countless eons. (8) Nonobservation is to not conceive of the three spheres with regard to meditation. (9) The nature is to refrain from clinging to [phenomena] from the mother962 up through the knowledge of all aspects as [real] entities. [These make up] the fivefold nature of the training in the knowledge of the path. (10) [The focus means] to fo cus on entities, the path, and suchness, which are taken as the objects of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path. (11) Being antagonistic is to put an end to the clinging to accomplishing by those who possess worldly clinging, that is, clinging to anything as being determined positively [(\"This is something to be taken on\")] and clinging to anything as being determined negatively (\"This is not something to be taken on\"). (12) Being unobstructed refers to wisdom being unobstructed with regard to all phenomena. (13) Being without ground is to realize that there is no sup­port because apprehender (what cognizes) and apprehended (what is cognized) are unobservable. (14) Being without going is to realize that there is no com­ing or going because they are suchness. (15) Being without arising is to realize that there is no arising because form and so on are the emptiness of lacking a nature. (16) The aspect of not observing suchness is to realize that suchness is not observable as the nature of an entity, a nonentity, both, or neither. [These make up] the sevenfold nature of [the training in] the knowledge of all aspects. Though this sixteenfold nature does not represent any defining char­acteristics that are other than the very nature of the trainings in the three knowledges itself, {562} [said nature] is defined through [these sixteen] as something like a definiendum that possesses them, or [as something like] the instances [of this nature], and thus is the fo urth defining characteristic. 963 2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.4.1.4.

The three mental aspects of medium heat consist of (3) benefiting [others] due to wishing to accomplish their future benefit, (4) not being angry about the happiness of others due to having overcome pride, and (5) not intending any harm due to having no contempt.

[IV .51] The four moments of the reality of suffering consist of ( 1) turning away from conceptions (including their seeds) of form up through the knowledge of all aspects by virtue of seeing that phenomena are empty of any specific characteristics of their own, (2) by virtue of being blessed by the victors and their children with the generation of bodhicitta not declining, firmness of the mind for unsurpassable enlightenment, without maras being able to sepa­rate one from the generation of bodhicitta, (3) by virtue of practicing the special mahayana, turning one's mind away from any wish for the inferior yanas of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and not being separated from men­tally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects, and, (4) through the power of nonconceptual wisdom discriminating phenomena as being without arising, the dissolution of the branches of being born [in the states corresponding to] the dhyanas, the form[less absorptions], and [the meditative absorption of] cessation despite resting in them in meditative equipoise. The four moments of the reality of the origin [of suffering] consist of (5) lightness of body and mind by virtue of being free from the heaviness of body and mind not being workable (that is, being free from the conceptions to be relinquished through seeing), (6) by virtue of one's skill in means in guid­ing sentient beings through whatever means [are suitable], using desirable sense pleasures in households without clinging, (7) constantly pure conduct for one's own welfare by virtue of seeing the shortcomings of households and, (8) by virtue of having attained an undistracted mind and the [five] faculties such as confidence, {570} purity of the daily necessities of livelihood in the manner of the genuine beings who have gained mastery over not forgetting the generation of bodhicitta. The four moments of the reality of cessation consist of, (9) with regard to the skandhas and so on, stopping to dwell on connecting with clinging to skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, and dependent origination as entities and to dwell on being occupied with continuously clinging to them (that is, through dwelling in the realization of emptiness, not seeing, in actual reality, any phe­nomena as being superior or inferior), (10) as before, stopping the clinging"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"492 Groundless Paths to entities and so on with regard to virtues being taken away or not being taken away by the phenomena that are the obstacles of the realization of the path of seeing (which are like robbers snatching [the wealth of] virtue), (11) as before, stopping the clinging to entities and so on with regard to more or less talk about the accumulations of the causes of enlightenment (the many aids such as generosity) and about [topics] such as wars to vanquish enemies and, (12) as before, stopping the clinging to entities and so on with regard to attachment and aversion, or what is to be adopted and to be rejected, within the battle of remedies (what cancels out) and their factors to be relinquished (what is to be canceled out).

This profundity is the state of being liberated From the extremes of superimposition and denial. [IV .52] The mahayana path of familiarization is profound because it is endowed with the direct realization of the profundity of emptiness and so on. The nature of profundity is emptiness, with \"and so on\" [including] signlessness, wish­lessness, nonformation, nonarising, nonceasing, freedom from attachment, cessation, peace, suchness, and the true end. The reason for this profundity is that it is the state of being liberated from the extremes of superimposition and denial. For [in terms of] these eleven such as emptiness, ultimately there is neither form in emptiness and so on, nor are emptiness and so on other than form. Thus, to not exist ultimately is the nature of form.976 2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2.

[IV .59] You may wonder, \"As for the eight profound qualities that appeared as a mere name above, in which objects-the bearers of these qualities-do they exist?\" They [exist] in the following eight such as arising. (1) The profun­dity in arising or dependent origination is phrased as follows. \"It is not that enlightenment is produced through each single one of the earlier or later moments of the generation of bodhicitta, but enlightenment is not produced without them either. Nevertheless, unsurpassable enlightenment (the goal to be attained) is produced through having cultivated the generation of bodh­icitta.\" (2) The profundity in ceasing is phrased as follows. \"Conventionally since all entities have already ceased right upon their arising from their own specific causes,986 there is nothing to be ceased again. Since they do not have any natural essence of their own, they are without ceasing ultimately, while they cease on the level of the seeming.\" (3) The profundity in suchness is phrased as follows. \"Though one familiarizes with suchness through prajfta during all phases of the path, one does not manifest it for one's own welfare out of compassion.\" (4) The profundity in what is to be cognized is that there is nothing to be accomplished (such as generosity) in the nature of suchness"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"498 Groundless Paths (all phenomena being free from reference points). However, on the level of the seeming, many paramitas such as generosity {577} are accomplished. (5) The profundity in cognition is phrased as follows. \"Since phenomena have the nature of suchness that is free from all reference points, nonconceptual wisdom's not seeing any reference points is the seeing of true reality.\" ( 6} The profundity in engagement is phrased as follows. \"To abide in the nature of phenomena refers to there being no engagement in characteristics with regard to all phenomena, [but] conventionally one engages in generosity and so on.\" (7) The profundity in nonduality is phrased as follows. \"Through realizing the nature that does not exist as the dual engagement by virtue of discrimi­nating notions about characteristics and the lack of characteristics, there is no duality of what is to be accomplished and what accomplishes it. However, [conventionally,] all paths are accomplished.\" (8) The profundity in skill in means is phrased as follows. \"On the level of the seeming, all accumulations of merit and wisdom are fully completed, but ultimately their fruition­buddhahood-is not attained.\" Though these are not [internally] contradictory ultimately, from the perspec­tive of those who possess clinging, said [eight profundities] (such as [in terms of] arising) appear as if they were mutually exclusive [internally]. Therefore, they are presented as profound. These eight, which are the subsequent conven­tions that are approximately concordant with the [corresponding] realizations in meditative equipoise, are the signs of irreversible [bodhisattvas] on the path of familiarization. You may wonder, \"How can those on the path of familiariza­tion realize these [eight profundities] as not being [internally] contradictory?\" [They realize them] by way of attaining the liberations that are inconceivable for those who entertain any clinging to extremes.987 2.2.1.2.2.1.1.2.3.

Detailed explanation of the conceptions about the apprehender The first about the apprehender should be known In terms of seizing and discarding, Mental engagement, Adhering to the three realms, [V.13] Abiding, clinging, Imputing phenomenal entities, Attachment, remedy, And impairment of proceeding as one wishes. [V.14] No final deliverance according to the aim, Identifying the path as not being the path, Ceasing and arising, Being conjoined and not being conjoined with entities, [V.15] Abiding, destroying the disposition, The absence of striving and the cause, And observing opposing forces Are the other conceptions about the apprehender. [V.16] {588} [The objects of the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of sub­stance] are ( 1) those [persons] who are seizing and discarding qualities and flaws, respectively, on the level of the illusionlike seeming, (2) those who are mentally engaging in phenomena as being illusionlike, (3) those who focus on the three realms by adhering to them through mentally engaging in char­acteristics, (4) those who are abiding in form and so on through clinging to them, (5) those who are clinging to all phenomena through taking them as objects, ( 6) those who realize all phenomena as being mere conventional imputations, (7) those who have attachment to the path (the six paramitas) and engage in them seriously, (8) those who practice the remedy for taking [satp.saric] existence and peace as what is to be rejected and to be adopted,"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"508 Groundless Paths respectively, and (9) those who know that the activity of proceeding as one wishes (such as generosity) is impaired through lacking prajfiaparamita. Thus, [these conceptions] consist of those that cling to said nine objects as having substantially existent identities. They are twofold in terms of regress­ing from the path of nonclinging (the cause) and not attaining the knowledge of all aspects (the result). The first one is threefold in terms of conduct, know­able objects, and the factors to be relinquished and their remedies. Conduct is threefold in terms of motivation, nature, and shortcomings. Knowable objects are threefold in terms of clinging to them as entities, continua, and conven­tions. The factors to be relinquished and their remedies are twofold in terms of clinging to the factors to be relinquished and their remedies. The nine [objects of the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of imputation] are (1) [those in whom] there is no final deliverance according to the aim (the three greatnesses), (2) those who are identifying the correct path (the mahayana) as not being the correct path, (3) those who realize that the ceasing of results and the arising of causes are imputed, through mere imputations on the level of the seeming, as having a nature, {589} (4) those who know that all entities are conjoined with indifferentiability ultimately and are not conjoined with indifferentiability on the level of the seeming, (5) those who are abiding in all phenomena through not clinging, ( 6) those who are destroying the mental state of merely striving for peace (the disposition of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas), (7) those who realize the absence of any buddhahood to be wished or strived for, (8) those who realize the ultimate absence of causes (such as someone who teaches the dharma), and (9) those who, through being familiar with the antagonistic factors of the six paramitas, know that opposing forces (the four maras and the two levels [of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas]) are observable (that is, existent) entities. Thus, [these conceptions] are the nine that cling to the mind streams endowed with said antagonistic and remedial phenomena as being really existent as imputed identities. They consist of two, six, and one in terms of the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, the path of bodhisattvas, and the antagonistic factors of both, respectively.1oo5 2.2.1.2.2.1.2.2.2.

After that, during subsequent attainment, dependent origUnation is examined in its progressive and reverse orders.1013 Through familiarizing with the dependent origination of afflicted phe­nomena in progressive order ([as in the statement,] \"Through the condition of ignorance, [karmic] formations [arise] ... \"), {593} one realizes that the primary factors of karma and afflictions-the two [links] of ignorance and formations-are the root of satpsira and thus realizes the nature of the real­ity of the origin [of suffering].

This samadhi, which is the buddhahood that serves as the immediate condition of its specific result, is the knowledge of all aspects.1027 2.2.1.2.2.1.2.4.2. Causes The lack of entity is asserted as the focal object of this, Mindfulness as its dominant factor, And peacefulness as its aspect. [V.39ac] Since the focal object of this uninterrupted samadhi and this knowledge of all aspects is the lack of any real entity, it is the nonimplicative negation that consists of illusionlike dependent origination. {600} The dominant condi­tion [of this samadhi] is the continuum (up through the ninth bhumi) of the mindfulness of retaining, without forgetting, emptiness free from refer­ence points (that is, the focal objects and aspects of mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects for the welfare of others). [Both this samadhi and the knowledge of all aspects have] the aspect that consists of the primordial peacefulness of reference points. Thus, both the culmination of the uninter­rupted [path] and the knowledge of all aspects concord in their focal object and aspect, and all favorable conditions for giving rise to the knowledge of all aspects are complete in the culmination of the uninterrupted [path].1028 2.2.1.2.2.1.2.4.3.

Those people's utterances about these sixteen Are asserted as the wrong ideas About the knowledge of all aspects. [V.42] [The sixteen disputes here are as follows.] (1) Since it is explained that all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena lack any entity, the justification of the focal object is not feasible-if it is tenable, it is feasible that there are objects. (2) Since it is explained that all phenomena lack a nature, the iden­tification of the nature [of this focal object] (that is, the manner of realizing it) is not {601} tenable-if there is a manner of realization, there must be something to be realized. (3) Since it is explained that both entities and non­entities are not observable, the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects is not tenable. For if the knowledge of all aspects exists, these two objects [ (entities and nonentities)] must exist [too]. (4) Since they are taught to be inseparable as suchness and the nature of the freedom from reference points, the two realities-the ultimate and the seeming-are not tenable. For if there are two, they must be separable. (5) Since it is explained that the triad of generosity, the one who is generous, and the recipient is not observable, the training in practicing generosity and so on is not tenable. For if this object exists, these three must exist. ( 6) Since it is explained that there is no object to be realized, the realizer-the jewel of the Buddha-is not tenable. (7) Since it is explained that cessation and the path are mere imputations, the jewel of the dharma is not tenable. (8) Since it is explained that all phenomena are free from increase and decrease, the jewel of the scupgha is not tenable. (9) Since it is said that they are not observable as the three spheres, the [cognizing] subjects that entail the means of generosity and so on are not tenable. (10) Since realiza­tion in terms of the four extremes of entities, nonentities, both, and neither is refuted, the realization of the sage is not tenable. ( 11) Since it is taught that"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Translations: A Word Commentary 521 permanent, impermanent, and so on are alike in being mere mental reference points, it is not tenable that clinging to the skandhas and so on as being per­manent and so on is mistakenness. (12) Since it is explained that they do not manifest the fruitions which consist of the nirval)as of sravakas and pratyeka­buddhas, {602} the explanation that bodhisattvas cultivate the three paths is not tenable. (13) Since it is explained that there is nothing to be adopted, remedies are not tenable. (14) Since it is explained that there is nothing to be rejected, antagonistic fa ctors are not tenable. (15) Since it is explained that all phenomena lack defining characteristics and instances, common and uncom­mon defining characteristics are not tenable. (16) Since there are no general and specific characteristics to be fa miliarized with, any familiarization with the path fo r the sake of attaining the knowledge of all aspects is not tenable. The wrong ideas in terms of clinging to the two realities as being contradic­tory, [which are expressed] by those people's uttering disputes about these profound points, are asserted as the sixteen that are related to the knowledge of all aspects. Mostly, these disputes are just [attempts to refute assertions about] the seeming through relying on the ultimate or to refute assertions about the ulti­mate through relying on the seeming.

[VIII. 7] The view of the dispassion of srivakas and pratyekabuddhas means the lack of afflictions by virtue of not producing afflictions in the mind streams of others. When [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas], through their samadhi, know that afflictions arise in certain sentient beings in villages and so on upon [these beings] seeing them, they do not wish to look at said [beings.

The distinctive feature of knowledge through aspiration The Buddha's knowledge through aspiration Is held to be effortless, free from attachment, Unobstructed, remaining forever, And solving all questions. [VIII.S] In general, the knowledge through aspiration is as follows. Once one's aspi­ration prayers of thinking, \"May I know this based on dhyana\" have been fulfilled, one enters dhyana while mentally aspiring, \"I shall know this\" with regard to whatever one wishes to know. Then, upon rising from this [dhyana], one will know the given knowable objects. The Buddha's knowledge through aspiration {610} is held to be more emi­nent than those of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas by virtue of five distinctive features-being effortless due to operating naturally, being free from attach­ment due to being uninterrupted, being unobstructed due to engaging in all knowable objects, remaining forever due to always resting in meditative equi­poise, and solving all questions due to giving answers to all that is asked.

If one comments on a brief enumeration of the paths and bhiimis of bodhi­sattvas in an easily understandable way, [this consists ofj the five paths and the ten bhiimis. The five paths are the path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of familiarization, and the path of nonlearning. The ten bhiimis will be explained below in the context of the path of familiarization. 1) The path of accumulation The excellent motivation of bodhisattvas, the children of the victors, is bodhicitta [in its] two [forms ofj aspiration and application. Having gener­ated this perfect bodhicitta on [the level ofj seeming [reality], [bodhisattvas] take their aspiration for the ultimate bodhicitta-the nonconceptual wisdom of the path of seeing-as the path. Therefore, this is the level of engagement through aspiration. When divided, the path of accumulation is threefold­great, medium, and lesser. It is the phase of making great efforts in [gathering] the accumulation of merit. Since this is the beginning of gathering accumula­tions for many incalculable eons, {174} it is called \"path of accumulation.\" Here the lesser path of accumulation [is lesser] because the time of the arising of the path of preparation in one's own mind stream is uncertain. The medium path of accumulation [is medium] because it is certain that the path of preparation arises in one's next life. The great path of accumulation [is great] because it is certain that the path of preparation arises in this lifetime. As for the meaning of the root text1066 [saying], \"May you engage in the foundations of mindfulness and so on,\" during the lesser path of accu­mulation [bodhisattvas] mainly familiarize with the four foundations of mindfulness. First, in the foundation of mindfulness of the body, through prajfia they examine the triad of the outer body (the world as the container), the inner one (their own body), and the intermediate one (the bodies of other sentient beings). Then, through samadhi, they rest in meditative equipoise in"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"546 Groundless Paths the state of [said bodies] not being established-spacelike emptiness. During subsequent attainment they familiarize with [these bodies] being like illusions and dreams. In particular, as the remedy fo r desire, they familiarize with this body as being the vessel fo r impure [substances, such as] blood and lymph, the source of the 404 kinds of diseases and the six thousand evil spirits, the support of [various] kinds of bugs, and with seeing it as a rotten [corpse] and skeleton after its death, and so on. As for the foundation of mindfulness of feelings, through prajiia [bodhi­sattvas] examine the three feelings of pleasure, suffering, and indifference, and then rest in meditative equipoise in the state of their being unarisen and without arising. { 175} During subsequent attainment they familiarize with all feelings being without essence, just like a banana tree, and being of the nature of suffering. As fo r the foundation of mindfulness of mind, through prajiia they analyze the three [types of] discrimination (vast, small, and intermediate) and then rest in meditative equipoise in the state of their natural emptiness. During subsequent attainment they should understand the nature of the mind as its mode of neither ceasing nor abiding. As for the foundation of mindfulness of phenomena, through discriminat­ing prajiia they analyze all phenomena that consist of conditioned formations and then rest in their nature-equality. During subsequent attainment they should regard all phenomena as the eight examples of being illusory, that is, being like dreams, illusions, mirages, optical illusions, [the reflection of] the moon in water, echoes, the cities of gandharvas, and magical creations. Here, since the object that is analyzed through prajiia [in the first founda­tion of mindfulness] is the body, one speaks of \"the body.\" Through having analyzed the body through discriminating [prajiia], any really established nature of the body is done away with and the subsequent spacelike empti­ness is called \"the foundation of mindfulness.\" The same applies to the other three [mindfulnesses]. As for the nature of practicing with the specific differ­ent focal objects of the four foundations of mindfulness here, there is nothing that is not included in the following two-the spacelike meditative equipoise and its illusionlike subsequent attainment. {176} During the medium path of accumulation [bodhisattvas] mainly familiar­ize with the four correct efforts. The first one is to not give rise to nonvirtuous phenomena that have not [yet] arisen. The second one is to swiftly cut through nonvirtuous phenomena if they have arisen in one's mind stream. The third one is to give rise to virtuous phenomena that have not [yet] arisen in one's mind stream. The fourth one is to make efforts in further increasing those [virtuous phenomena] that have arisen [already]. These are called \"the four relinquish­ments\" because they relinquish all entities of nonvirtuous phenomena and"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Appendix I 547 relinquish the factors that obstruct the virtuous ones. They primarily refer to the strong conduct of the three gates [of body, speech, and mind]. During the great path of accumulation [bodhisattvas] familiarize with the four limbs of miraculous powers. First, through the limb of miraculous powers that is striving, without the mind being agitated through a lack of confidence, wrong views, and so on, they aspire for, and delight in, samadhi and thus enter and cultivate it. Secondly, through the limb of miraculous powers that is vigor, they make efforts in resting in meditative equipoise in the doors of samadhi. Through this they eliminate the flaws and obstacles of these [samadhis], make efforts in accomplishing their qualities, and do not let themselves come under the influence of [adverse] conditions. { 177} Thirdly, through the limb of miraculous powers that is mind, the mind abides one-pointedly, does not turn into the two factors of being conceptual and being influenced by something else and so on, and manifests dhyanas and samadhis. Fourthly, through the limb of miraculous powers that is analysis, the conti­nuity of said samadhi is sustained throughout all manners of conduct. Here the supernatural knowledges and so on are the miraculous powers­they are the means that make one attain [samadhi and realization] in one's own mind stream. Samadhi refers to miraculously powering the dexterity in samadhi in many ways. Therefore, they are called \"limbs.\" On this great path of accumulation, through manifesting many miraculous powers, [bodhisat­tvas] travel with these miraculous powers to the realms in which buddhas actually reside, thus master listening to incalculable hundreds of thousands of dharma doors, and attain the samadhi of the stream of dharma, in which they are able to retain these [teachings] through their dexterity of prajfia. As explained above, since it is the gathering of accumulations that is mainly taught here, the path of accumulation is the first one among the five paths. 2) The path of preparation It is the path of preparation since it prepares one for, [or joins one with], the direct seeing of the nonconceptual wisdom of the path of seeing. [On its levels of] heat and peak, the time of the arising of the path of seeing is uncer­tain. { 178} [On its levels of] poised readiness and supreme dharma, it is certain that the path of seeing arises in this life. As fo r the meaning of the root text [saying], \"May you engage in heat, peak, and so on,\" the nonconceptual wis­dom of the path of seeing burning the afflictive obscurations resembles a fire and the portent of its arising in one's own mind stream resembles the fo llow­ing example. When one rubs a [wooden] support with a wooden stick, before the arising of fire there arises heat in the wood. Likewise, there arise signs of heat in one's mind stream that are unlike [what happened] before and coarse afflictions are suppressed. Therefore, this is [the level of] heat of the path of"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"548 Groundless Paths preparation. [Its level of] peak [is so called] because it represents the peak of mundane roots of virtue. [Its level of] poised readiness [is so called] because the poised readiness of not being afraid of the basic nature-the actuality of emptiness-is attained. [Its level of] supreme dharma [is so called] because it is the supreme of all dharmas that arise from mundane meditation. These make up the path of preparation as the four factors conducive to penetration. From among them, on the two [levels of] heat and peak, [bodhisattvas] familiarize with the five faculties. First, through the faculty of confidence, they greatly aspire fo r the wisdom of the path of seeing. Through the faculty of vigor, without being distracted, they make efforts in the means to give rise to the wisdom of the path of seeing in their own mind streams. Through the faculty of mindfulness they guard the training in superior ethics without dete­rioration. Through the faculty of samadhi they rest in meditative equipoise in the training in superior samadhi. {179} Through the training in superior prajfta by virtue of the faculty of prajfta they practice by giving rise to the view of the basic nature in their own mind streams. During the two levels of poised readiness and supreme dharma they practice the above five faculties in such a manner that they are free from their respective obscurations. Thus, the five [factors of] confidence, vigor, mindfulness, samadhi, and prajfta that can absolutely not be overwhelmed by their respective hindrances of lack of con­fidence, laziness, fo rgetfulness, distraction, and lack of alertness have become the five powers. 3) The path of seeing It is called \"the path of seeing\" because the supramundane wisdom of the noble ones is seen for the first time. The root text [says], \"May you attain the bhlimi of mindfulness, fully [discriminating] phenomena and so on.\" This refers to the correct branch of enlightenment that is the full discrimination of phenomena. In general, prajfta is the full discrimination of the individual aspects of all phenomena. Here it refers to the respective dharma cognitions, dharma readinesses, subsequent cognitions, and subsequent readinesses of the four realities and so on. These are the sixteen moments of readiness and cognition with regard to not being afraid of, and being ready for, all individual characteristics of all phenomena being demonstrated as the nature of phe­nomena-the fundamental ground of the basic nature free from all reference points. The same goes {180} for [all] seven branches of enlightenment, that is, [also the remaining] branches of enlightenment that are correct mindfulness, correct vigor, joy, physical and mental suppleness, samadhi, and equanimity. As for \"equanimity\" here, bodhisattvas [have an] equal [mind], and are with­out attachment and hatred, toward either being anointed with sandalwood balm from the right or their flesh being cut with an axe from the left. Having"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Appendix I 549 been introduced to, and having perfected, the correct view of such wisdom of the path of seeing, they are much more eminent than ordinary beings. At this point, through having purified the latent tendencies of the obscura­tion of miserliness and having fully perfected the paramita of generosity, in a single moment [they possess] the twelve [qualities] of [being able to] enter, and rise from, one hundred samadhis, see the faces of one hundred buddhas, know the blessings of one hundred buddhas, go to one hundred buddha realms, shake one hundred realms, fill one hundred realms with light, mature one hundred sentient beings, display a single moment as one hundred eons, engage in the vision of wisdom during one hundred earlier and later limits, open one hun­dred doors of dharma, display one hundred of their own bodies, and display each of these bodies with one hundred excellent retinues. {181} At this stage they are able to take rebirth as a [cakravartin] king over Jambudvipa. Since this first bhiimi, one among the ten bhfimis of the noble ones, repre­sents the seeing of the reality that is the nature of phenomena, it is the path of seeing. Since it is endowed with many joys that are unlike [what was expe­rienced] before, it is [called] \"Supreme Joy.\" 4) The path of familiarization It is the path of familiarization because, on it, [bodhisattvas] make them­selves familiar with the wisdom of the path of seeing that they saw already. In this context they familiarize with the eightfold path of the noble ones. The root text [says], \"May you progress through view, thought, speech, and so on.\" As for the meaning of this, through having directly seen the nonconceptual wisdom of the path of seeing, [bodhisattvas] correctly realize the view of the basic nature. This is correct view. Through its power no afflictions arise in their mind streams and all their thoughts are automatically virtuous, which is correct thought. Correct speech means that physical and verbal nonvirtues do not arise from a virtuous mind and that everything they say is of benefit to beings. Correct aims of action means that, no matter what they do, it turns into the welfare of others. Correct livelihood is to always be content and not be tainted by the five wrong livelihoods. The five wrong livelihoods are flat­tery, corrupt ethics, indirect appeal, seeking gain, and evaluating what can be obtained. These five have been relinquished [by said bodhisattvas]. {182} Correct vigor is to make efforts for the welfare of others through relinquish­ing distractions without becoming weary or tired. Correct mindfulness is to always sustain the continuity of mindfulness. Correct samadhi is to rest in meditative equipoise in the dhyanas and so on and to enter many samadhis. In this way [bodhisattvas] familiarize with the eightfold path of the noble ones. As for progressively traveling through the nine bhumis of the path of familiarization, at the time of the lesser of the lesser path of familiarization [bodhisattvas] fully perfect the paramita of ethics, purify the obscurations of"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"550 Groundless Paths corrupt ethics, and [attain the qualities as they were] already explained at the time of the path of seeing, such as entering, and rising from, one thousand samadhis in each moment. The difference is that, here the [respective] aspects of said qualities are twelve times one thousand [each]. [The bodhisattvas on this bhfimi] are able to take rebirth as a [ cakravartin] king that reigns over the four continents.

Thus, here the twelvefold qualities increase to one hundred thousand each. [The bodhisattvas on this bhfuni] are able to take rebirth as someone like lndra, the lord over the [gods in] The Thirty-Three. Since the third bhfuni illu­minates the dense darkness of the negative latent tendencies of sentient beings {183} through the genuine dharma, it is called \"The Illuminating.\" At the time of the great of the lesser path of familiarization [bodhisat­tvas] fully perfect the piiramita of vigor, purify the obscurations of laziness, enter, and rise from, ten millions of samadhis in each moment, and so on, just as above.

Since the fo urth bhfimi radiates the firelike wisdom that completely burns all afflictive and cognitive obscurations, it is called \"The Radiating.\" At the time of the lesser of the medium path of familiarization [bodhi­sattvas] fully perfect the piiramita of dhyana, purify the obscurations of distraction, and [attain] the twelve [qualities], such as entering, and rising from, one billion samadhis in each moment, just as above. Thus, here [these qualities] increase to one billion each. [The bodhisattvas on this bhfimi] are able to take rebirth as a king over [the gods in] Enjoying Emanations.1067 Since, at this stage, [bodhisattvas] simultaneously both dwell in samadhi fo r their own welfare and make efforts fo r the welfare of others, the fifth bh'iimi is called \"Difficult to Master.\" At the time of the medium of the medium path of familiarization [bod­hisattvas] fully perfect the paramita of prajfia, purify the obscurations of ignorance and dullness, enter, and rise from, ten billions of samadhis in each moment, and so on (the same [principle of increase] as above applies). [The bodhisattvas on this bhumi] are able to take rebirth as a king over the gods in Tu�ita.

At the time of the lesser of the great path of familiarization [bodhisattvas] fully perfect the paramita of power, purify the obscurations of being weak in power, enter, and rise from, samadhis in one moment that equal [the number of] the minutest particles in one hundred thousand of the greatest chiliocosm, and so on (the twelve as above). Since the eighth bhftmi is not moved by discriminating notions about being with characteristics or being without characteristics, it is called \"The Immovable.\" At this stage the five [sense] doors and the afflicted mind [of bodhisattvas] change state, they gain mastery over pure realms, manifest the all-accomplishing and discriminating wisdoms, and are able to take rebirth as a king over the first chiliocosm. {185} At the time of the medium of the great path of familiarization [bodhi­sattvas] fully perfect the paramita of aspiration prayers and purify the obscurations of not accomplishing the goals they aspire for. At this point they enter, and rise from, samadhis that equal [the number of] the minutest par­ticles in one million of countless greatest chiliocosms, and so on (applying to the twelve qualities as above). [The bodhisattvas on this bhumi] are able to take rebirth as Brahma, the lord over the second chiliocosm.

Division [The division of the path of accumulation] is threefold. The lesser path of accumulation means that it is uncertain when the path of preparation will arise. The medium path of accumulation means that its arising in the next [lifetime] is certain. The great path of accumulation means that its arising in this lifetime is certain. The lesser path of accumulation is traveled through the four foundations of mindfulness; the medium one, through the four correct efforts; and the great one, through the four limbs of miraculous powers. 1.1.3.1. The cultivation of the path of examining entities-the four founda­tions of mindfulness This has five parts: 1) Which objects 2) In what manner 3) Which nature 4) For which purpose 5) Meaning of the term 1.1. 3.1.1. Which objects [Objects] are fourfold-body, feelings, mind, and phenomena. The body con­sists of the triad of the outer, the inner, and the outer and inner bodies.1074 Feelings are threefold-pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. Mind consists of the eight or six collections [of consciousness], with the primary mind being the mental consciousness. Phenomena are threefold-the remaining condi­tioned formations except feelings, the fourteen nonassociated formations, 1075 and the three unconditioned phenomena.1076 {189} In due order, childish beings conceive the body as the support of the self; feelings as the bases of the experiences of the self; mind as the nature of the self; and phenomena as the bases of the self becoming afflicted or purified. Ordinary beings cling to the wrong idea that phenomena are the afflicted ones [that propel one toward] the lower realms and the purified ones that propel one toward liberation. 1.1.3.1.2. In what manner This has two parts: !) Common 2) Uncommon"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Appendix II 555 1.1.3.1.2.1. Common [This consists of familiarizing with] the four general characteristics imper­manence, suffering, being empty, and being identityless. This [ranges] from reviewing the body as the body up through reviewing phenomena as phe­nomena. First, one should understand that the body is [nothing but] a rotting corpse that is consumed by bugs and does not go beyond having this prop­erty, having this nature, and being of this essence. All fe elings are suffering. Though one dislikes fe elings of suffering and craves for pleasant �nes, ulti­mately they are all equal in being suffering. To the extent that one engages in the opposite of that, it must be happiness. Because of the above, no matter what one fe els it is all suffering. Mind is impermanent because it arises in respectively other [forms] due to different objects, supports, and so on. The five [sense] objects, the supports (the sense faculties), and also the cognitions that are supported [by those] are impermanent as momentary [phenomena] that [constantly] change into something else. All phenomena are identity­less.1077 {190} The body has the defining characteristic [of being composed] of the elements (such as specifically characterized earth) and elemental deriva­tives (such as the eyes). The defining characteristic of feelings is experience. The defining characteristic of mind is cognizance of objects. [The defining characteristic of] phenomena is to bear their own specific characteristics. 1.1.3.1.2.2. Uncommon The difference in the focal object is that the followers of the hinayana [focus] only on their own bodies and so on, while the followers of the mahayana [focus on] the bodies and so on of both themselves and others. The difference in mental engagement1078 is that the followers of the hinayana [determine the body as] being impure and so on, while the followers of the mahayana determine all phenomena as emptiness. The difference in attainment is that the followers of the hinayana [practice for, and attain,] the mental state of relinquishment, while the followers of the mahayana, through realizing the [ultimate] characteristic [of phenomena], practice for, and attain, the nona­biding nirviil)a without anything to be relinquished or to be adopted. 1.1.3.1.3. Which nature [The nature of the foundations of mindfulness] consists of prajfia and mindfulness. 1.1.3.1.4.

First, dur­ing the time of making efforts in preparing [for samadhi], the biggest obstacle is laziness. Its remedies are striving, vigor, 1084 confidence, 1085 and suppleness as the fourth one, which is supported by the third one. [Thus,] one relies on this set of four. When entering [into samadhi], the biggest obstacle is to forget the instructions. Its remedy is to rely on the mindfulness of not forgetting the focal objects and [their cognitive] aspects. When [actually] meditating, the biggest obstacles are two-dullness and agitation. Therefore, one relies on alertness as their remedy. As for the means to eliminate dullness and agita­tion, the remedy for not applying the remedies [for these two] {193} consists of the states of mind that hold and settle [the mind], respectively. The remedy for [over]applying [said two remedies] is to cultivate equanimity. 1.1.3.3.3. Nature In general, [the nature of the four limbs of miraculous powers] is samadhi.

Purpose [The purpose] is the accomplishment of all results that one wishes to mani­fest, such as miraculous powers. 1.1.3.3.5.

Division [The division of the path of preparation] is fourfold. Heat is the samadhi of attaining illumination, which is the attainment of the clear illumination [of prajfta].

[The Abhidharmakosa says]: In those who attain peak, the roots [of virtue] are not severed.1088 This is the peak of all movable roots of virtue1089-having reached greater cer­tainty than before, [it is realized that] the conceptions about the apprehended (the causes and results [of saQlsara]) are not established by any nature. Poised readiness is the samadhi of having entered one side of true reality. [The Abhidharmakosa says]: For those who attain poised readiness, falling into the lower realms is impossible. 1090 This is the attainment of the poised readiness of not being afraid of profound actuality-apart from everything being merely an appearance of mind, any nature of a basis [of these appearances] (a substantially established identity) is not established.

Through their serving as the causes for purity, when seen unmistaken states of mind arise. Thus, they are realities from the perspectives of both the [cognizing] subject and the object. They are realities because they are real from the perspective of the seeing of the noble ones. 1.2.3.1.1.2. Instances The instances of the reality of suffering are two-impure containers and their contents. The Abhidharmasamuccaya [says]: What is the reality of suffering? It consists of the births and the birthplaces of sentient beings. 1093 The origin [of suffering] consists of the afflictions and {196} the karmas that arise under the sway of these afflictions. Cessation [is fo urfold]-weakening of the seeds through symbols and the mundane paths, suppression of manifest afflictions, the ultimate [cessation of] the noble ones having eradicated the seeds at their root (these [three] being incom­plete and complete cessations, respectively), and, fourth, the buddhabhfuni. You may wonder, \"How is [cessation to be understood]?\" [It is to be understood in terms of] suchness, the path, and the afflictions, which are where the latter cease, through what [they cease], and what [ceases], respectively.1094 As for the path, the brief defining characteristics of the path are the under­standing [of suffering], the relinquishment [of its origin], the manifestation [of cessation], and the cultivation [of the path]. Alternatively, the reality of the path is asserted as consisting of all five paths. These are the instances [of the four realities]. 1.2.3.1.1.3. Defining characteristics Each reality [has] four [defining characteristics], thus there are sixteen. The first [reality] consists of impermanence, 1095 suffering, 1096 being empty, 1097 and being identityless.1098 The second one, the origin [of suffering], consists of cause, 1099 origin, uoo arising, uo1 and condition.U02 { 197} The third one, cessa­tion, consists of cessation, uo3 peace, u04 excellence, uos and final deliverance since it is definite liberation.u06 The fourth one, the path, consists of the"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Appendix II 561 path, 1107 being appropriate, 1108 accomplishment, 1109 and being conducive to deliverance.1110 1.2.3.1.1.4. Their being one or different Cessation and the other three [realities] are different in the sense of negating being the same. During the meditative equipoise of the noble ones the reality of the path and the reality of suffering are different, but during their subse­quent attainment they are not mutually exclusive. [The realities of] the path and the origin [of suffering] are different in substance. The two [realities] of suffering and its origin have the same basis. However, though the origin [of suffering] is necessarily suffering, suffering is not necessarily its origin. 1.2.3.1.1.5. Their definite number [The four realities are definite in number] because they are definite as the points to be rejected and to be adopted, respectively, by those with insight, that is, the causes and results in terms of afflicted and purified phenomena, respectively. 1.2.3.1.1.6. Their order They accord with the order in which meditators [meditate on them] first. The Uttaratantra [says]: Just as a disease is to be known, the causes of the disease to be relinquished, {198} The state of well-being to be attained, and medicines to be relied upon, Suffering, its causes, its cessation, and likewise the path, respectively, Are to be known, to be relinquished, to be reached, and to be relied upon.m1 1.2.3.1.2. In what manner Through relying on the existence of the causes that are the respectively pre­ceding ones, one engages in the respectively later ones. In due order, one should familiarize with the four realities by way of [the five faculties of] trust, enthusiasm, not forgetting the focal objects and their aspects, a one-pointed mind, and fully distinguishing them individually. 1.2.3.1.3.

In terms of the discrimi­nating clear realizations, it has sixteen moments. Though it is a single moment in terms of the manner of performing its function, according to the second system/115 it has sixteen [moments] in terms of the progression of the arising of subsequent certainty after having cut through various aspects of super­imposition with regard to each reality. In this way, also the presentation of approachers and abiders is suitable. The discriminating clear realization {201} is also a single moment.m6 Moreover, according to the Yukti$�tika1117 that is explained in Madhyamaka, through understanding that dependently origi­nating phenomena are without arising and ceasing the nature of the triad of suffering, its origin, and the path are also realized to be so. Since just this is the nature of cessation, there is only a single moment, but no gradual realization. However, the presentations of fifteen and sixteen moments are given in terms of the simultaneous nature of cognition in order to benefit those who like elaborations.

The"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"566 Groundless Paths first two are the causes that make arise what has not arisen, while the fifth one1130 is the one that makes special what has already arisen. As for identifying [these mental engagements] individually, the first mental engagement is to comprehend, by way of alternating studying and reflect­ing on them, the defining characteristics of the coarse [states] of the lower realms to be relinquished and the peaceful [states] of the higher ones to be attained. The second one is to arrive, through having vigorously aspired for these peaceful [states versus] the coarser ones for a long time, at calm abid­ing and superior insight that go beyond study and reflection. The third one is the path of relinquishing the three great [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire [realm] through having familiarized with this [calm abiding and supe­rior insight] for a long time. The fourth one is to relinquish the three medium [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire [realm] through joy and withdrawal. The fifth one is to mentally engage in the characteristics of suffering again and thus familiarize with the remaining factors to be relinquished in terms of peaceful [states versus] coarse ones if striving for the desire [realm] arises. The sixth one is to relinquish, through having familiarized in this way, {205} the three lesser [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire [realm].

They are fourfold-regressing, abid­ing, special, and conducive to penetration. 2b) [The supramundane path] consists of the nine dhyanas and form[less absorptions]1132 that are embraced by the prajfta of realizing identitylessness."},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Appendix II 567 2c) [Explaining their presentations] has two parts: a) Explaining the branches of the dhyanas {206} b) Explaining the fo cal objects and aspects of the fo rmless [absorptions] 2ca) [Explaining the branches of the dhyanas] has fo ur parts. The first dhyana1133 has five [branches]-examination, analysis, [mental] exhilaration, [physical] bliss, and samadhi. The second one has fo ur-supreme [inner lucidity] , exhilaration, bliss, and samadhi. The third one has five-equanim­ity, mindfulness, alertness, bliss, and samadhi. The fo urth one has fo ur-[ the fo rmation of] equanimity, mindfulness, the fe eling of equanimity, n34 and samadhi. Their differences are as fo llows. The relinquishment of examination and analysis [marks] the second [ dhyana compared to the first one]. You may wonder, \"What is the difference between the first one and the second one?\" There is the difference of samadhi being fully complete [in the second one] . The relinquishment of exhilaration [marks] the third one, so the difference between the second one and the third one is that [the branch of] benefit is fully complete [in the latter] . The relinquishment of bliss [marks] the fo urth one, so the difference between the third one and the fo urth one is that [the branch of] purity is fully complete [in the latter] . The branches of the fo urth dhyana are free from the eight flaws (the pair of examination and analysis, the pair of [physical] pleasure and mental pleasure, [the pair of physical] suffering and mental displeasure, and the pair of inhalation and exhalation).1135 The branches [of the fo ur dhyanas] thus being definite as fo ur or five, respectively, in number is in terms of their constituting the branches that are the remedies, the benefits, and the basis, respectively.1136 {207} 2cb) Explaining the fo cal objects and aspects of the fo rmless [absorptions] has fo ur parts. As for the first one, through [seeing] the fo rm of the fo urth dhyana that one has attained as a flaw and seeing fo rmlessness as a quality, in order to put an end to the discriminating notion of fo rm one cultivates solely the discrimi­nating notion of space, which is free from color, shape, tangible objects, and so on. Through this the appearances of these coarse [forms] vanish and nothing but the discriminating notion of space arises. As for Infinite Consciousness, Nothing Whatsoever, and Neither Discrimination Nor Nondiscrimination, through seeing the respectively fo rmer ayatanas as coarse one puts an end to them and aspires for the states of mind of the respectively following. 3) [As fo r the signs of such attainments,] the signs of having attained the dhyanas are such as one's body appearing to sink into the earth and the signs of having attained the fo rmless [absorptions] are the arising of signs such as soaring through space. 4) [As fo r the persons as those who attain,] the Abhidharmakosa [says] in general:"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"568 Groundless Paths The dhyanas and fo rmless [absorptions can] have [psychophysical] supports Of their respective own levels and lower levels, [while] the lower are of no use.1137 In particular, [it says] : [Exception:] If noble ones at the Peak of Existence manifest [The absorption of] Nothing Whatsoever, they terminate the contaminations. 1138 Through the path of familiarization's being divided into great, medium, and lesser, it is ninefold.

As for the mental support, the followers of the mahayana assert that it is the fourth dhyana. As [the Abhidharmakosa says]: The teacher and the rhinos, up through enlightenment, Rely on the last dhyana and accomplish all in one.1140 The followers of the hinayana say that [a buddha-to-be] who sits under the bodhi tree in Vajrasana is an ordinary being of sharpest faculties.

Their qualities [on the level] of seeming [reality] On the first bhfuni [bodhisattvas] attain twelve sets of one hundred qualities. They attain one hundred samadhis and enter them, see the fa ces of one hun­dred buddhas, know the blessings of these [buddhas], shake1148 one hundred worldly realms, go to one hundred pure realms,1149 illuminate them with light rays, mature one hundred sentient beings, abide for one hundred eons, see the earlier and later limits of one hundred eons,1150 open one hundred doors of dharma,1151 display one hundred [of their own] bodies, and display each of these bodies being surrounded by one hundred excellent retinues.

Their manners of taking rebirth This has two parts: 1) [Being born under certain] influences 2) [Being born through] maturation 2.2.3.1. [Being born under certain] influences According to the [Mahayanasutr]ala1flkdra, [such influences are] four: Those with insight are asserted to be born Under the influence of karma, m3 And, furthermore, aspiration prayers, Samadhi, and mastery.1154 2.2.3.2.

Also, as the matrix of mastery over noncon­ceptuality, through the change of state of the afflicted mind they gain mastery over nonconceptuality. As the matrix of pure realms, through the change of state of perception (the consciousnesses of the five [sense] gates) they gain mastery over pure realms. On the ninth bhumi their mastery over the four discriminating awarenesses is to gain control over the four discriminating awarenesses through the change of state of the mental consciousness. Also,"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"57 4 Groundless Paths they mature sentient beings through gaining mastery over excellent enlight­ened activity. On the tenth bhfimi they realize the matrix of mastery over enlightened activity. This realization is to gain mastery over mirrorlike wis­dom through the change of state of the alaya-consciousness (the basis of the arising of the mental consciousness). This makes [these bodhisattvas] suit­able fo r [performing] the great enlightened activity that is similar to the one of buddhas with regard to the enlightened activity that exists in terms of the recipient or the object. Thus, they gain mastery over fo ur [wisdoms]-[the wisdom of] equal­ity and discriminating [wisdom] on the eighth bhumi, all-accomplishing [wisdom] on the ninth bhfimi, and mirrorlike wisdom on the tenth bhfimi. Then, at the end of the continuum, immediately upon the change of state of the alaya that contains various latent tendencies, they gain mastery over dharmadhatu wisdom, which means becoming a buddha.

Explaining the obscurations to be relinquished This has two parts: 1) Identifying the two obscurations in general 2) Their particular characteristics 2.2.5.1. Identifying the two obscurations in general Through nonafflicted [ignorance] as the cause, no karma that propels one into saq1sara is accumulated. However, as that which obscures [everything] from small knowable objects up through the attainment of omniscient wis­dom, it represents the cognitive obscurations. Here it is said that the three spheres of the fo llowers of the mahayana-everything that is not asserted as afflictive obscurations (the fo ur causes of ignorance and so on of the sravakas and the cognitive obscurations, that is, phenomenal identity)-are asserted as [the instances of] the clinging to real existence. This is the same as phe­nomenal identity and represents the definition of the cognitive obscurations. The afflictive obscurations are produced by afflictions as their cause, have the power to accumulate karma that propels into saJp.sara, and obscure the path to liberation. Each one of these [two types of obscurations] is twofold-innate and impu­tational. Innate obscurations are those that have arisen together with the mind since primordial time, just as rust building on iron. Their subtle elements are those that can only be relinquished through [the levels of] the path of famil­iarization.U58 {217} Their coarse elements are those from which one becomes free through merely seeing reality. The imputational [obscurations] consist"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Appendix II 575 of the mind being newly altered through philosophical systems, for example, such as the conceited and delusive1159 misunderstandings1160 of [something] to be [a certain way], when it is not. In general, whatever is an afflictive obscuration is necessarily a cogni­tive obscuration, but cognitive obscurations are not necessarily afflictive obscurations. 2.2.5.2. Their particular characteristics This has two parts in terms of being divided through the particular [charac­teristics] of cognitive and afflictive [obscurations, respectively]. 2.2.5.2.1. Cognitive obscurations This has two parts: 1) Common 2) Uncommon 2.2.5.2.1.1. Common [The common cognitive obscurations] consist of the fo ur conceptions about apprehender and apprehended.U61 The conceptions about the apprehended in terms of the set of afflicted phenomena refer to the pair of the causes and results of satp.sara, all of which are without nature, and the ones in terms of the set of purified phenomena refer to the pair of the causes and results of nirvaJ:ta, all of which are without nature. [The conceptions about the appre­hender in terms of] clinging to substances refer to substantially established selves and persons, all of which do not exist, and the ones in terms of clinging to imputations refer to what is established through imputation, all of which does not exist. Alternatively, there is also the assertion that the cognitive obscurations consist of the fo ur conceptions in terms of being affirmed. In that case, the conceptions in terms of being affirmed that cling to substances refer to the phenomena of the five skandhas (the bases for labeling persons) {218} exist­ing in a substantially established manner. In brief, it is said that all conceptions about apprehender and apprehended are cognitive obscurations. 2.2.5.2.1.2. Uncommon On each one of the ten bhiimis, there is the triad of two [kinds of] ignorance and an impregnation of negative tendencies.1162 2.2.5.2.2.

There are also twenty-eight [each] with regard to the other three realities, so that their sum total is 112.

How are [they divided]? If divided in terms of the division of the path, they are sixteen. 1168 If divided in terms of the bhiimis, 1169 they are fo rty-six. If divided in terms of [lesser,] medium, and great, they are 414. 2.2.5.2.2.2.2. The manner in which they are relinquished This consists of the two manners of explaining the triad of (a) the factors to be relinquished, (b) the means of relinquishment, and (c) the manner of relinquishment in (I) the mahayana and (2) the hinayana, respectively. 1a) The factors to be relinquished are the latencies. Their manifest [forms] are relinquished through the suppressing remedy1170 from the path of prepa­ration of this [path of familiarization] onward. However since they arise again, this is not a relinquishment that actually fulfills this function. The three [terms \"latencies,\"] \"seeds,\" and \"impregnations of negative tendencies\" are synonyms, having the same meaning. They are eradicated at the root. 1b) [Said factors to be relinquished are relinquished] through the prajfia of realizing identitylessness that is the union of calm abiding and superior insight. 1c) [The manner of relinquishment] is asserted to be simultaneous-the greater, [medium,] and lesser obscurations of the three realms are relin­quished in a combined manner. You may wonder how [that happens]. {221} The fo rty-six great of the great [degrees of the] afflictive obscurations of the three realms are relinquished through the lesser of the lesser path of familiar­ization.1171 The same principle applies progressively up through the lesser of the lesser obscurations being relinquished through the great of the great path of familiarization.U72 On each one of these [paths] one progresses through fo ur [paths)1173-the path of preparation,1174 the uninterrupted path,1175 the path of liberation, 1176 and the special path.11n In accordance with the manner of the remedies arising in the order [from] the lesser [to the great], they are"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"578 Groundless Paths the causes for becoming free from the factors to be relinquished in the order [from] the great [to the lesser]. Therefore, this resembles the [simultaneous movements of] the upper and lower beams of a scale. 2a) According to the position of the hinayana, [the factors to be relinquished by the path of familiarization] are what is experienced or the [afflictive] fetters. 2b) It is asserted that they are relinquished through the six grounds of dhyana and the first three formless [absorptions]. {222} 2c) [The manner of relinquishment] is gradual-the obscurations of the higher and lower realms are [relinquished] through separating each one. From the \"not ineffective\" preparatory stage of the first dhyana the mental engagement of separation arises, which [relinquishes] the three great [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire realm. [The mental engagement of] joy and withdrawal [relinquishes] the three medium [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire [realm]. [The mental engagement of] the final training relinquishes the three lesser [degrees of the] afflictions of the desire [realm] (thus all nine). Likewise, in due order, said three natures of the preparatory stages that cause the attainment of the respective dhyanas relinquish the lesser, medium, and great obscurations of the respectively lower levels.1178 The hinayana says that the distinct feature of the Buddhist [path of familiarization] is only the very prajfia that severs solely the obscurations of the Peak of Existence. [The mun­dane path of familiarization] does not represent the uncontaminated path, but is [still] able to relinquish the obscurations of the other eight [levels] in a stable manner. 2.2.6. The signs of having attained the bhtimis On the first bhftmi [bodhisattvas] see a trichiliocosm being filled with trea­sures;1179 on the second one, all worldly realms being adorned with many jewels; on the third one, wearing armors and overcoming opponents; on the fourth one, all kinds of flowers being scattered by the wind in the four directions; on the fifth one, women who are adorned with ornaments putting flower garlands on their heads. On the sixth one, a pond with four stairways {223} [leading down into it,] being covered with golden sand [at its bottom], being filled with dear and unpolluted water with the eight qualities, and being adorned with blue water lilies, night water lilies, and white lotuses; on the seventh one, the abysses of hell to their right and left sides, while [they them­selves] return without being injured or weakened [in any way]; on the eighth one, two lions with a mane on their two shoulders outshining all the weaker creatures; on the ninth one, a cakravartin surrounded by hosts of people; and on the tenth one, the body of a tathagata."},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"Appendix II 579 2.2.7. The fruitions of the bhfunis The temporary fruitions are the qualities of the respectively fo llowing bhiimis and the final fruition is the accomplishment of buddhahood. 2.3. The hermeneutical etymology of [the bhiimis] that are endowed with these qualities The Mahayanasutralarrzkara [provides] the particular hermeneutical etymologies: Upon seeing that enlightenment is near And the welfare of sentient beings is accomplished, Utter joy will arise. Therefore, it is called \"Supreme Joy.\" Since it is free from the efforts of distorted ethics, It is called \"The Stainless Bhiimi.\" Since it causes the great radiance of dharma, It is The Illuminating. Thus, the dharmas concordant with enlightenment Are like intensely burning light. Because it is endowed with these, this bhiimi Burns both [obscurations], thus being The Radiating. Since they fully mature sentient beings And guard their own minds, {224} This is difficult to master [even] by the intelligent. Therefore, it is called \"Difficult to Master.\" Since sarp.sara and nirvat}.a Are both faced here, It is said to be \"the Bhiimi of Facing,\" Which is based on the paramita of prajfta. Due to being joined with the single path to travel, It is held to be the bhiimi Gone Afar.

He engages in the three actions with regard to objects that are preceded by omniscience And his vast knowledge operates by always being unobstructed with regard to the three times. 1185 As for the twenty-one sets of buddha qualities, [they start with] 1) the ten powers, {226} 2) the fo ur fe arlessnesses, 3) the eighteen unique [qualities], and the five visions.1186 Here the fleshly vision is the special quality of the sense faculty that makes one see fo rm. The divine vision is the quality of the eye consciousness seeing the deaths, transitions, and rebirths [of all sentient beings]. It is held that these two arise from fo rmer karma. The prajfta vision is the nonconceptual wisdom of the path of seeing. The dharma vision is what engages the twelve branches of a buddha's speech in an unobstructed manner and knows all sharp and dull fa culties of noble persons. The buddha vision is the direct seeing of the entirety of suchness and variety without attachment and obstruction. 4) The six supernatural knowledges are the supernatural knowledge of miraculous powers, the supernatural knowledge of the divine eye, the super­natural knowledge of the divine ear, the supernatural knowledge of knowing all movements of the minds of others, the supernatural knowledge of recollecting fo rmer states, and the supernatural knowledge of knowing termination. With these, sravakas and pratyekabuddhas behold those who are like themselves; bodhisattvas, those who are superior [to them]; and buddhas, everybody. 5) [The Mahayanasutralarrrkara says] : Support, supported (what is to be explained) ... 1187"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"582 Groundless Paths [This refers to] {227} what is to be explained through the fo ur discriminating awarenesses-all pitakas of the words of the Buddha that represent the dharma (the support) and all their meanings (the supported). [The text continues]: Speech and knowledge (the means of explanation) .. .U88 [This refers to] the means of explanation since it represents the certainty about the manners of speaking that represent the manners of explaining [the above] (all the ways of conventionally labeling with names, such as [different] kinds of languages) and the inexhaustible self-confidence of the knowledge of the mind. 6) As fo r the fo ur doors of dhara.Qi, the dhara.Qi that is the door to attain­ing poised readiness is as follows. For example, illustrated through something like the letter A, one is able to understand the dependent origination of all phenomena of sa!pSAra and nirWJ:ta as being unceasing and thus realize the inexpressible actuality. The dhara.Qi of mantra refers to, fo r example, compos­ing a mantra that accomplishes all benefit and harm and blessing it through samadhi, due to which its inconceivable power arises. The two dhara.Qis of words and their meanings refer to the capacity to keep [words and their mean­ings] in mind without error or flaw. The nature of these [ dhara.Qis] consists of the triad of mindfulness, prajfia, and samadhi. 7) The totalities have the nature of special samadhi and prajfia. When divided, they manifest as the samadhis of the totalities of the fo ur [elements] (earth, water, fire, and wind) and the fo ur colors (blue, yellow, red, and white). {228} They likewise manifest as the samadhis of infinite space and conscious­ness. As for the manner of familiarizing with them, one familiarizes with the earth above the water (such as a bridge), water raining down from the sky, a blazing wood fire, and the tangible sensation of wind. As fo r the fo ur colors, one relies on something like a round [patch in said colors. With the last two,] one fa miliarizes through relying on the space in a hole, a sphere of sunlight shining onto something else, and so on. The signs of accomplishment are that the [elements and so on] rise upward and so on. 8) The [ayatanas of] overpowering are eight due to being divided in terms of shapes and colors. First, [there are] fo ur in terms of shapes. With the notion of the internal [looker] having fo rm, one knows all big external fo rms through overpowering them. It is through seeing1189 by overpowering1190 them that one entertains1191 this notion [of knowing] . [Next,] one meditates in the same way on small external fo rms. Then, with the notion of the internal [looker] not having fo rm, one meditates as before on both small and big external fo rms. Again, with the notion of the internal [looker] not having fo rm, one knows"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"Appendix II 583 the fo ur external colors blue, yellow, red, and white through overpowering them and so on, just as above. 9) As for great compassion, [buddhas] view all sentient beings with great compassion three times per day and three times per night {229} and thus know perfectly who is in decline, who flourishes, and so on. 10) Dispassion refers to the samadhi of dispassion. [For] sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, [this means that they] first examine [the people in a given place where they] go for alms and so on, and if [they see that] these [people] would become afflicted in dependence on them, they flee.1192 [In the case of] buddhas, this is like a watchdog taming cattle. They do not avoid places with sentient beings who have given rise to afflictions, but definitely go there and then overcome all afflictions in the mind streams of these [beings] . 11) As fo r the knowledge through aspiration, the one of sravakas is to know what they wish [to know]. It is like thinking, \"I shall know this point,\" and knowing it through entering the meditative equipoise of the samadhi that is the highest fo rm [of the fo urth dhyana]. For example, it refers to some­thing like Maudgalyayana [being able to] state the royal lineage of the Sakyas. [Said knowledge] of perfect buddhas is the knowledge through aspiration that has five distinctive fe atures-it is spontaneously present without needing any effort, without attachment, without obstruction, everlasting until SaiJlSara is empty, and, while never leaving meditative equipoise, simultaneously pro­vides all the answers to the inconceivably [many] and various questions that sentient beings ask at the same time. {230} 12) As for the ten masteries, the three masteries over lifespan, mind, and necessities are the results of generosity. The masteries over karma and birth are the results of ethics. The mastery over creative willpower is the result of patience. The mastery over aspiration prayers (the fulfillment of all aspiration prayers in terms of places [to manifest buddhahood]) is the result of vigor. The mastery over miraculous powers is the result of dhyana. The masteries over wisdom and the dharma are the results of prajfia. 13) This refers to the dharmas concordant [with enlightenment as described] above. 14) The fo ur immeasurables do not clearly appear in this text.1193 15) As fo r the eight liberations, the [first] three are as fo llows. [During] the liberation [of looking] at fo rm [through what possesses fo rm, one medi­tates] with the notion of the internal [looker] possessing fo rm. [During the liberation of looking at fo rm through] what is fo rmless, [one meditates] with the notion of the internal [looker] being fo rmless. [During the libera­tion of notions of specific beauty, one meditates] with the aspect of beauty. According to the Abhidharmakosa, [the latter] is also asserted as the medita­tion on repulsiveness. As fo r their being liberations, the [following five-the"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"584 Groundless Paths four] fo rmless [absorptions] and [the meditative absorption of] cessation are free from the obscurations of their respective own levels. 16) The nine progressive abidings refer to successively abiding [in medita­tive absorptions]. As for \"the nine meditative absorptions (snyoms 'jug),\" they balance (snyoms) the elements of the body and balance all [primary] minds and mental factors. It is only the eight dhyanas and form[less absorptions] {231} that [buddhas] actually enter, while [the meditative absorption of] ces­sation is [only entered as] a mere manner [of display]. Cessation refers to the cessation of discriminations and feelings, that is, the cessation of all seven consciousnesses except for the alaya. 17) The three [ways] of nothing to hide refer to there being nothing to be kept secret in the actions of body, speech, and mind. Therefore, they are pri­mordially guarded. 18} The threefold foundation of mindfulness consists of the following three-equally not being attached to retinues listening with respect, not being angry at those who listen without devotion, and being without both attach­ment and anger [toward those who sometimes behave like the former and sometimes like the latter]. 19) The true nature of being without fo rgetfulness is to be without forgetting. 20} As for the four purities in all respects, the purity in all respects of the [physical] support is the purity in all respects in terms of adopting and aban­doning bodies. The purity in all respects of focal objects is the purity in all respects in terms of magically creating and transforming them. The purity in all respects of mind refers to inconceivable samadhis. The purity in all respects of wisdom is to know all knowable objects to be pure. 21) [The last set] consists of the latent tendencies of the afflictions being overcome and the three knowledges-the knowledge of entities (knowing all skandhas, dhatus, ayatanas, and so on}, the knowledge of the path {232} (knowing all paths of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas}, and the knowledge of all [aspects] (the knowledge of completely realizing all aspects). Among these qualities, sixty-four are unique [to buddhas], while the remaining are in common [with sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisat­tvas]. If these qualities, which are categorized in twenty-one sets, are divided [in detail], they are 144. Together with the five visions that are explained in this text, they make up 149. Virtue. This presentation of paths, bhumis, and fruitions was made in the form of notes by Shichen Tulku1194 during the explanations on the Treasury of Qualities by the dharma lord Patrul Rinpoche."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"• • • • • • • • • Appendix III: A General Topic of the Ornament of Prajnaparamita, [Called] \"Its Brief Progressive Stages of Meditation, An Excellent Explanation of the Scriptural Tradition \"1195 I pay homage to the Buddha. I pay homage to the Indian and Tibetan scholars and siddhas Who knew the true reality of the three knowledges (what is to be known), Trained in the path of the four trainings (the practice), And became one with the fruition that is the dharmakaya (what is to be attained). Here the unerring practice of the means for fortunate persons to manifest the final fruition (the dharmakaya) is twofold: 1) Motivation 2) Training 1) [To begin� there are] the three dharmas to be ascertained (what is to be known). If they are understood, the motivation-bodhicitta-will arise properly in one's mind stream. First, one must know the final fruition to be attained-if one does not know it, one does not know the focal object of the bodhicitta of aspiration. Secondly, one must know the defining characteristics of the path that makes one attain this [fruition]-if one does not know them, one does not know the practice of the bodhicitta of application. Thirdly, one must know the manners of relinquishing the points of going astray from this path-if one does not know them, {451} the ultimate bodhicitta does not arise in one's mind stream and emptiness and compassion are not unified. Therefore, at the very start, one should think the following: \"Since begin­ningless time all sentient beings (our former mothers who have sustained us with their kindness) are tossed around in the waves of sarpsara's ocean of suf­fering and thus experience all kinds of suffering-how very pitiful they are! Right now, through giving rise to the power of vigor, I shall protect all sentient beings, my mothers, from all forms of suffering and thus relieve them within"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"586 Groundless Paths the state of happiness.\" Thinking in this way, when giving rise to the root of the mahayana dharma, the motivation of compassion, the mahayana disposi­tion is awakened if a state of mind of not [being able to] bear the suffering of sentient beings arises, which is like the state of mind of a mother without arms whose child is carried away by the waters [of a river]. This means being some­one to be guided who has become a [suitable] vessel for this profound dharma. In such [persons] to be guided, in the beginning, the following state of mind arises: \"As for my accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings, if, at present, I myself am not liberated from the suff erings of saq�.sara and do not know the means to relinquish them, how could I possibly accomplish the welfare of others? Therefore, what makes up the ability to accomplish the welfare of all limitless sentient beings without effort and strain? {452} If such [an ability] exists, I shall practice in precise accordance with it.\" If such a state of mind has arisen, [the sutras] explain the following: 0 son of good family, such means definitely do exist. First, through the progressive stages such as generating bodhicitta for the sake of all sentient beings, one manifests the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects. Then, one teaches the path that oneself has traversed to others. This is the spontaneous welfare of limitless sentient beings without effort and strain. You may wonder, \"How is this knowledge of all aspects [to be under­stood]?\" Understand that, through the above [phrase] \"the path that oneself has traversed,\" the result is pointed out by way of its causes. The final result that is gradually accomplished through the ten dharmas such as the genera­tion of bodhicitta is the knowledge of all aspects. One should also understand that, through [the phrase] \"teaching to others,\" the subject is pointed out by way of its objects. The knowledge of all aspects refers to having properly understood the ten points such as the generation of bodhicitta (the objects) and thus teaching them to others. You may wonder, \"In order to understand the knowledge of all aspects, why is the knowledge of all aspects not taught by way of its own specific char­acteristics, but must be explained through pointing it out by way of its causes and its objects?\" It cannot be explained without pointing it out by way of these two, just as in the example {453} of explaining the eye consciousness, which is taught by way of [saying that] \"it arises from its causes, such as the eye sense faculty\" or \"it apprehends objects such as blue.\" However, it cannot be taught without relying on either one of these two. You may think, \"Isn't the knowledge of all aspects that which knows all that can be known without exception? How could it be the knowledge of all"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Appendix III 587 aspects through knowing only these ten [points, such as the generation of bodhicitta] ?\" In this [explanation here], these ten are what must definitely be known in order to accomplish the welfare of others without effort. Therefore, they are stated in terms of what is primarily needed [for omniscience], but it is not that [the knowledge of all aspects] does not know other [things] as well. [For example,] by virtue of [being able to] see a needle that is far away, it is certain that one [can] see a knife that is close by. Likewise, through [the knowledge of all aspects] knowing such difficult points [as said ten dharmas], it is implicitly established that it [also] knows other [objects] that are easier [to know] than those. In this context, some say, \"Through [the knowledge of all aspects] know­ing the ten points it knows all knowable objects without exception. Since [the AbhisamayalaJ?'lkiira says], 'The fo cal object consists of all phenomena:u96 the [knowable objects of the knowledge of all aspects] are contained in this [focal object] .\" However, there is no entailment in merely this, just as in the fo llowing example. When bodhisattvas cultivate the path, through knowing the fo cal objects of the path the familiarization with all phenomena as being emptiness and so on exists [in them], but they do not become omniscient merely through that. Also, when [bodhisattvas] fo cus on the triad of virtue, nonvirtue, and what is neutral as what is to be adopted and to be rejected, respectively, they surely must know these three, and all phenomena {454} are included within these three. However, merely through knowing these three they do not become omniscient. Next, said fo rtunate [persons who are able to accomplish the knowledge of all aspects] may wonder, \"Now, since I must attain this wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects by all means, in what kind of path that causes its attainment should I train?\" At that point, they must understand the fo llowing and train their minds in the motivation of benefiting others, thinking, \"Since results are produced in accordance with their causes, I must train in the very paths that accord with their results. Therefore, if I am to make efforts fo r the sake of sentient beings since sentient beings are different in their dispositions and motivations and thus cannot be taken care of through just a single path, I shall manifest all paths of the three yanas through knowing and seeing them [directly] and then teach them to others.\" This becomes the cause for the gen­eration of the bodhicitta of application arising in the mind streams [of said fortunate persons]. Then they think, \"For this sake I shall definitely train in all paths of the three yanas. However, since I am one who strives fo r the final mahayana alone, I shall properly understand the differences between the higher and the lower paths and thus not go astray into inferior paths.\" Thus, within the state of not being separated from great compassion (the means), they familiarize with the"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"588 Groundless Paths actuality of the true reality that is free from the thirty-two superimpositions onto entities (skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas). {455} In this way, the genera­tion of ultimate bodhicitta arises in their mind streams in a short time. In such a way, in due order, the respectively former [among] the three knowledges are the causes and the latter, their results. Therefore, when they are to be understood through studying and reflecting, and taken as the objects of the generation of bodhicitta, they are stated beginning with the know­ledge of all aspects so that the aspiration for the final result, which is attained as solely the first one [among the three knowledges], arises. However, when matched with the practice in terms of the progressive arising [of the three knowledges] in the mind stream of a person, what are generated in the mind stream first are the direct knowledge of realizing that all phenomena (the entities) in one's own mind stream are identityless and the uncommon great compassion that makes [the mahayana path] more special than inferior paths. Then, through the completion, maturation, and purification by way of teach­ing the paths that respectively accord with those to be guided who possess the three dispositions, the result of the knowledge of all aspects is manifested. Therefore, through matching [the three knowledges] in this order, in the con­text of their summary [the Abhisamayala,.kara] says: The three [knowledges] are this one, Then this one .. .U97 Thus, they are summarized by starting with the knowledge of entities. Therefore, in order to unerringly determine the characteristics of these three [knowledges] through studying and reflecting and thus take them as the objects of the generation of bodhicitta, they are stated as \"the characteristic\" in the context of the [Abhisamayala,.kiiras] summary into six clear realizations, and as \"the threefold object\" in the context of its summary into three. {456} Also, when [the three knowledges as] what is to be known are determined by way of studying and reflecting, through either the subject being pointed out through its objects, or the objects through their subject, the [ten] dharmas [such as the generation of bodhicitta] are to be assessed through nothing but the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects. Though these dharmas are the objects of the knowledge of all aspects, they are also the objects of the knowledge of the path of bodhisattvas. [Furthermore,] they are not only the objects of the first two [among the three knowledges], but also the objects of the knowledges of entities of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Through understanding this, [all] superimpositions onto the characteristics of all phenomena that make up the triad of satpsara, nirvai).a, and the path will be cut through."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Appendix III 589 At the time when they are taken as the objects of the generation of bod­hicitta, one makes a vow, thinking, \"It is through knowing such and such objects in this manner by way of pointing out the subject through its objects that I shall give rise to all types of realization of the three yanas or the fo ur persons, which are able to perform such functions, in my own mind stream.\" Therefore, this becomes the fully qualified generation of the mindset of the mahayana, just as the Mahayanasutralarrrkara [says] : Who possesses the skill in yana and wisdom being universal ... 1198 This explains that to commit, from the very start, to the actuality of the yana being universal and wisdom being universal is the supreme commitment. Therefore, when matching these three [knowledges] {457} with the genera­tion of bodhicitta, they are definite as the causes fo r generating the aspiring, applied, and ultimate bodhicittas, respectively. Or �ey represent the causes fo r the triad of resolve, intention, and superior intention, 1199 respectively. In due order, first, there arises the resolve of striving fo r what is to be attained­the knowledge of all aspects. Then, there arises the intention of striving for the benefit of others through relying on the knowledge of the path as the cause fo r the [knowledge of all aspects]. Through relinquishing the points of going astray into inferior paths one trains in the manner of not abiding in the two extremes. Through this, said intention, once it has become superior by virtue of being free from self-interest, [turns into] the superior intention. Thereafter, one engages in the generations of bodhicitta [that are associated with] the training and so on, 1200 which are easy to understand. Alternatively, it is also suitable to match these three [knowledges] with the manner of the three jewels being accomplished in one's own mind stream that is explained in [Asailga's] commentary on the Uttaratantra. First, through teaching buddha wisdom through the knowledge of all aspects one completely and perfectly realizes all phenomena. Secondly, in the context of the knowledge of the path, through teaching all paths of the three yanas one turns the wheel of dharma excellently. Thirdly, in the context of the knowledge of entities, since the dif­fe rences between the respective realizations of the higher and lower yanas are taught, one is surrounded by limitless disciplined hosts of disciples. {458} This is just an enumeration [of ways of matching the three knowledges]. In the context of these [three knowledges], the passages of the [prajiiaparamita siitras] themselves explicitly teach the knowledge of entities as the remedial knowledge of entities [in the sense] of not abiding in the two extremes. Through this, the knowledges of entities that fall into any extremes and [thus] are antagonistic fa ctors are to be understood implicitly, but apart from that, there is no direct explanation of the types of realization of sravakas"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"590 Groundless Paths and pratyekabuddhas. Therefore, [the Abhisamayala711kara] explains that it is \"not experienced by others.\"1201 Consequently, in those with small minds there may be some basis fo r the arising of subtle doubts about the explana­tions in this context here that the knowledge of entities refers to the points of going astray, that it represents the means to produce the knowledge of the path in one's own mind stream, and that it is the cause fo r the arising of the gen­eration of ultimate bodhicitta. However, ultimately, when the fully qualified remedial knowledge of entities-being free from superimposition and denial through having cut through all antagonistic fa ctors that are the points of going astray-has been generated in one's mind stream, it represents the mahayana knowledge of the path and also the generation of ultimate bodhicitta. In its wake, one will also know the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and therefore there is no contradiction. Furthermore, as for the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas that are explained in the context of the knowledge of the path, it is in order to take care of the persons who have the dispositions of the [sravakas and pratyekabuddhas] that the types of realization of [realizing] the actuality of identitylessness of the hinayana, which are not contradictory to [the realization of] the mahayana path, are generated in [a bodhisattva's] own mind stream and then taught to others. On the other hand, the knowledges of entities that are to be relinquished {459} are taught to be the superimpositions of clinging to real existence [that exist] in the mind streams of [practitioners of the] hinayana, the [latter's] own welfare of a partial peace, and so on, [all of] which are contradictory to the mahayana path. Therefore, these two [kinds of the knowledge of entities] are not repetitive either. When these three [knowledges] are matched with the five fo llowing clear realizations, both the [complete training in all] aspects and the culminat­ing [training] are mainly the training in the knowledge of entities. Both the serial and the instantaneous [trainings] are the training in the knowledge of the path, and the fruition of the dharmakaya is the actual knowledge of all aspects. Therefore, it is in terms of [making] the difference between motiva­tion and training that all eight [clear realizations] are included in the three [knowledges]. This is why the [Abhisamayala711kara's first verse of] paying homage also teaches these three. Consequently, this is what it means that all points of the text without exception are included in the paying of homage. Here, when the [above] fo ur trainings and two knowledges are matched, the meaning of saying \"mainly\" is that, when they are explained through matching them in this way in terms of what is primary, this is done because it benefits the arising of an understanding of the connection, the order, and the summary of the path. But it is not that [this explanation] covers every aspect [of the fo ur trainings], as [is shown by] the explanation of the training in all three knowledges in the context of the complete training in all aspects."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"Appendix III 591 The meaning explained by the noble one and commented on by the learned, Which is determined through the three prajnas, Is this summarized meaning of the three knowledges. So I wonder, \"Isn't it difficult to explain anything else than this?\" 2) The second main point, the training in the mahayana path This has two parts: a) The complete training in all aspects, [through which] mastery over realization is to be gained {460} b) The sequential training,1202 [through which] realization is to be stabilized 2a) As fo r the meaning of \"[through which] mastery over realization is to be gained,\" as pointed out through [studying, and reflecting on,] the three knowledges above, one comes to know the characteristics of all phenomena to be known and takes all types of realization of the three yanas as the object of [the bodhicitta of] aspiration. However, [through this alone,] one does not gain mastery over even the most subtle qualities of realization, which cor­responds to the fo llowing example. Though a poor servant may know and count all the possessions of a very rich person, there is not even the slightest chance of [said servant] being allowed to enjoy [these possessions] by being their master. Therefore, in the manner of the two realities being in union, one familiarizes with everything from the first aspect [of the complete training in all aspects] (impermanence) up through its final aspect (buddhahood).1203 Thus, what gives rise to realizations that have not [yet] arisen is called \"[that through which] mastery over realization is to be gained.\" Then, as fo r what stabilizes realization, one links all earlier and later famil­iarizations [with the three knowledges] that have arisen in one's mind stream before, thus manifesting them according to their order. Also, by way of acquainting oneself with those that have not [yet] arisen through studying them, and reflecting on them, in due order, one aspires for, and makes efforts toward, them in order for them to arise in the mind stream. In this way, one stabilizes one's familiarity with all realizations that have arisen in one's mind stream before. For example, when children learn the letters [of the Tibetan alphabet], first, based on being guided through the [thirty] basic letters ([such as] \"ka\" and \"kha\") and syllables, {461} they train in each letter. This resem­bles the complete training in all aspects. Later, through connecting many of the letters that they have come to know before, they learn to put together, and read, [words] such as \"Buddha\" and become proficient through becom­ing fa miliar with this. This resembles the serial training. Both the culminating and the instantaneous [trainings] are like the gauge of the path in terms of the"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"592 Groundless Paths fa miliarity with the fo rmer two trainings having become supreme. Therefore, they do not have separate manners of familiarization. The tenfold fa miliarity with the complete training in all aspects has fo ur stages. On the mundane path, once the qualities that consist of the signs of its being definite as the remedy which suppresses the fo ur conceptions about apprehender and apprehended, its increase, and so on have arisen in the mind stream, this is the culmination of the path of preparation. For the realiza­tion that arises from mundane meditation cannot become any higher than that. When, through the path of the noble ones, the remedy that eradicates, at their root, the fo ur conceptions about apprehender and apprehended which are fa ctors to be relinquished through seeing-the nonconceptual wisdom of the path of seeing-arises in the mind stream fo r the first time, this is the culmination of the path of seeing. For the realization of the meditative equipoise of directly seeing the nature of phenomena cannot become any higher than that. Thereafter, when the remedy that eradicates, at their root, the fo ur conceptions about apprehender and apprehended which are fa ctors to be relinquished through fa miliarization has arisen in the mind stream and {462} one, based on the samadhi with all aspects, 1204 has attained mastery over accomplishing the entirety of worldly benefit and happiness, this is the cul­mination of the path of familiarization. For the samadhi of familiarization in terms of those on the path cannot become any higher than that. At the end of the [path of familiarization] the culmination of the path of completion [occurs] , when even the most subtle appearances and clingings in terms of apprehending the two realities as different, good and bad, or contradictory are relinquished at their root and thus the nonconceptual wisdom that is pointed out through the triad of fo cal object, aspect, and cause has arisen in the mind stream. For one is not separated by any other paths from the final fruition to be attained-the dharmakaya. The phase of the final familiarity with the sequential training is the instantaneous [training]. When a single uncontami­nated dharma is manifested, it is nondual with all uncontaminated dharmas that have been manifested before, however many there are, and the ability to manifest [these dharmas] in the manner of lacking characteristics is the phase of having reached the end of the path. As for this [instantaneous training] and the culmination of the uninterrupted [path in the context of the culmina­tion of the path of familiarization] above, apart from merely being divided in terms of the isolates of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, they are without difference. Therefore, the actual [trainings] which one has to cultivate are both the complete training in all aspects and the sequential [training] . Nevertheless, in accordance with the order in the text, once, based on the complete training in all aspects, the culminating [training] has arisen in the mind stream, {463}"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"Appendix III 593 something like a sequential cultivation occurs. However, this represents the order that is explained in terms of closely connecting each aspect of cause and result, but not the order in which said cultivations are to be practiced. Hence, when [actually] cultivating [the trainings], now, from the time of a beginner onward, they are to be cultivated in both [orders], just as [indicated by] the example of a serial [training] in terms of studying and reflecting being explained as well. Therefore, if one explains these two trainings through applying to practice the mere entrance gate of pointing out their manners of familiarizing, first, during the complete training in all aspects, in general one should familiarize with it through condensing all aspects of the three knowledges into 173 aspects. From among these, to illustrate this through the manner of familiarizing with the first aspect of the knowledge of entities (the aspect of impermanence), the referent aspect is represented by all phenomena that consist of conditioned objects having the nature of the arising and ceasing of a continual series of moments. The cognitive aspect is represented by familiarizing, in the manner of mentally cutting through superimpositions by relying on scripture, reason­ing, and argument, with this very way of referents being impermanent. On the sravakas' own path merely this is sufficient. In the mahayana, since one must generate the types of realization of all yanas in one's mind stream, merely that is not sufficient-one must familiarize [with said aspect of impermanence] by way of training through taking both its objective and its cognitive aspects as one's objects. Though [the complete training in all aspects] is explained as twenty train­ings, three among these {464} are merely divisions of the manner of realizing the three knowledges and fifteen are divisions in terms of boundary lines. Therefore, what one should actually cultivate are only two trainings-the training in nonabiding and the training in nontraining. Here the familiar­ization with nonabiding is the familiarization that puts an end to engaging in clinging to objects. Since, at the time of this [training], the very aspect of impermanence is one's object, the cognition of [objects] as having the way of being of impermanence is merely the manner of realizing what is conventional and seeming. Ultimately, however, there is nothing that is really established even as sheer being impermanent. Through understanding this the mind does not abide in a manner of being associated with clinging, which is the train­ing in nonabiding. Through understanding impermanence as emptiness in this way, also the mind that familiarizes [with this emptiness] is the empti­ness of not being established as any extreme whatsoever. Therefore, what is called \"familiarization through nonobservation\" is that through which yoga is practiced, with regard to which [it is practiced], and how. To understand that, apart from this being a mere superimposition on the conventional level, there"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"594 Groundless Paths is not even an atom of something to familiarize with ultimately is the training in nontraining because one understands that there is no familiarization with a training in terms of object and subject. This is the familiarization that puts an end to the engaging in clinging to subjects. These two trainings are also explained as \"[putting an end to] abiding in something else\" and \"putting an end to yoga,\" with \"yoga\" and \"training\" being equivalent. Also, when matched with other dharma terminologies, \"being without anything to meditate on and a meditator\" {465} refers to noth­ing but these two. The training in nonabiding has the meaning of there being nothing to meditate on, while the training in nontraining means that there is no meditator. Furthermore, the explanations that the meaning of the mother consists of not mentally engaging in anything refer to just this-one does not engage in any object or subject by way of clinging to their real existence. Alternatively, the meaning of nonabiding is that since objects are not established as anything whatsoever, the mind does not cling to anything what­soever. The meaning of the training in nontraining is that this very lack of clinging to anything whatsoever is the supreme among yogas, which refers to the same essential point as \"the meditation of nonmeditation.\" As the Mahayanasutrala111kara [says] : Meditation is held to be supreme For those who do not see meditation.1205 Therefore, since the ultimate actual main practice through which one is to familiarize with the actuality of mother prajfiaparamita is solely this, from the bottom of one's heart one must cut through superimpositions with regard to just this essential key point. However, to take said essential points as something ancillary based on merely a few phrases in the text and [instead] demonstrating one's eloquence in a lot of meaningless and redundant ver­biage means that one's fortune for the dharma of the profound actuality is severed. Therefore, all the many thousands of the scriptural traditions and meditation manuals of the Indian and Tibetan learned ones are included within this single essential point of nonclinging, just as hundreds of waters are included in a single stream. By virtue of understanding this, {466} there is no need to take mere different dharma terminologies as being contradictory and then [engage in] negation and affirmation out of attachment and hatred, while [one has] a joyful mind due to having trusting and assured confidence in all of them. I consider this to represent the handprint of having studied, and reflected on, prajfiaparamita. This does not mean to [simply] remain in one's ordinary state through [entertaining] a nihilistic view, [thinking,] \"Since all phenomena are emptiness,"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"Appendix III 595 there is nothing to meditate on.\" Through understanding that, ultimately, the way of being of all phenomena (illustrated by subjects and objects) is to be naturally free from reference points, unborn, and beyond mind, one is not bound by clinging to, and fixation on, anything whatsoever. On the level of illusionlik.e seeming [reality] , within the state of being embraced by the triad of the generation of bodhicitta (the preparation), nonreferentiality (the actual main practice), and dedication (the conclusion), one familiarizes, in the manner of not fa miliarizing, with all aspects [of the culminating training], starting with [everything] conditioned being impermanent on the lower end up through buddhahood on the upper end, and gives rise to [these aspects] in one's own mind stream. This is the unsurpassable way of familiarizing with the emptiness of this prajfiaparamita. As [the Prajnapar amitasarttcayagatha says] : Just as a wooden apparatus, constructed by a skilled and experienced mason Similar to a man or a woman, performs all activities, Bodhisattvas who are skilled in engaging in prajna Perform all activities with nonconceptual wisdom.1206 Also, in the context of the knowledge of entities, {467} all phenomena are illustrated through the seven kinds of [illusory] appearance that make them understood and it is explained that one should familiarize with these by way of the fo urfold lack of conceit. 1207 Through familiarization in this way, temporarily [all] the types of realiza­tion of the three yanas, without any one being incomplete, arise in one's mind stream. Ultimately, all of these [realizations] are pure within the expanse of the single emptiness free from reference points and without clinging. Those with insight must realize that it is this very union of appearance and emp­tiness, means and prajfia, and the two accumulations that represents the unsurpassable excellent path of delighting the victors. In this context it is said that, at present, one cannot directly familiarize with some of the aspects of the knowledge of a buddha alone (such as the [ten] powers and the [four] fe arlessnesses), but one fa miliarizes with them in the manner of striving and aspiring fo r giving rise to them in one's own mind stream in the future. Once one has attained the bhfimis, though one lacks the actual [forms of these qual­ities], there is the generation in one's mind stream of what is similar in type [to them]. 2b) As fo r the sequential training, when one has condensed all the many aspects of the three knowledges into the 173 aspects [of the complete training in all aspects] and, through this complete training in all aspects, has fa miliar­ized with each one of them in the manner of the two realities being in union,"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"596 Groundless Paths one then fa miliarizes with all the many familiarizations that have [already] arisen in one's mind stream according to their order in an increasingly swift manner and by linking the fo rmer and the later ones. {468} One also fa mil­iarizes with them in the manner of each one of them including all [others] . Through this, one stabilizes the realizations that have arisen in one's mind stream during the complete training in all aspects. To illustrate this through the phase of fa miliarizing with the aspects of the reality of suffering in terms of the first knowledge, first, through taking each [aspect] (such as impermanence and suffering) as one's fo cal object, there arises stable certainty about the manner of, on the level of seeming [reality] , everything conditioned lacking permanence. Through understanding that, ultimately, [everything] is emptiness, one lacks conceit about, or clinging to, this. To familiarize with these two [realizations] arising in union in one's mind stream in an increasing manner represents the cultivation of the com­plete training in all aspects. When the respectively appropriate aspects have arisen in one's mind stream, in due order one trains again and again in [the aspects ofj impermanence, suffering, emptiness, identitylessness, and so on in the manner of dearly bringing them to one's mind through the respective moments that it takes to complete this activity. Also, the other three aspects are included in impermanence because it is explained that suffering [occurs] due to impermanence. Since conditioned phenomena represent continual series [of moments], in being just that they are also empty and identityless, and so on. Thus, one settles one's mind within the manner of all [aspects] being included in each single one of them and familiarizes with that. You may wonder, \"In the text the sequential [training] {469} is explained as thirteenfold, such as recollecting the Buddha. Therefore, how could the fa miliarization with aspects such as impermanence be the sequential [train­ing]?\" These thirteen are the branches of the sequential familiarization, but not its actual main phase of familiarization. As fo r the three jewels, they are the fo undation since taking refuge [in them] is the fo undation of all paths, while the recollection of the deity represents the witness of cultivating the path. One familiarizes [with impermanence and so on in the manner ofj the six paramitas being complete in each single aspect and in the manner of being embraced by emptiness. Therefore, these latter seven [(the six paramitas and emptiness)] represent the manner of familiarization [of the sequential train­ing]. If one recollects giving and ethics and abides in these two, by way of [obtaining] the excellent physical supports and possessions of the higher realms the favorable conditions for practicing the path will be complete in all one's lifetimes. Therefore, they serve as the aids fo r [being able to] cultivate [the path] in other lives as well."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Appendix III 597 Hence, the actual [training] to be cultivated is identified in the context of the intermediate [version of the] clear realizations [in the Abhisamayalarrtkara]: The characteristic, the training in it, Its highest degrees, its progression ... 1208 If one applies all [four] terms [in these lines] to the aspects of the three knowl­edges, it is the aspects of the three knowledges that serve as what one has to fa miliarize with through the sequential [training] . If one takes the respectively latter terms as indicating the respectively fo rmer, by virtue of \"the highest degree\" of the complete \"training\" in all aspects [its] \"progression\" {470} must be explained as the serial [training]. Therefore, in any case, it is certain that, out­side of what one is to familiarize with during the complete training in all aspects, there is nothing [else] to be fa miliarized with through the sequential [training] . You may wonder, \"If there is nothing [else] to be fa miliarized with through the sequential [training] outside of what one is to familiarize with through the complete training in all aspects, why are they presented as two clear realiza­tions?\" There are differences in terms of what is of greater or lesser priority in these two and so on. The complete training in all aspects means to pri­marily familiarize with all phenomena (illustrated through the aspects of the three knowledges) being emptiness free from reference points. The sequen­tial [training] means to, motivated by great compassion, primarily train one's dexterity in the samadhi with all aspects. Furthermore, the complete train­ing in all aspects represents [primarily the familiarization during] meditative equipoise, while the sequential [training] refers primarily to the familiariza­tion during subsequent attainment. As for the meaning of these two trainings being described as meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, respec­tively, this does not refer to presenting the phase of one's mind resting in equipoise in samadhi at present as meditative equipoise and the phase of engaging in conduct after having risen from that [samadhi] as subsequent attainment. Rather, meditative equipoise [is presented as] the noble ones who have attained the bhlimis resting in equipoise in the expanse of non­conceptual wisdom free from characteristics, while subsequent attainment is presented as {471} training one's dexterity in the samadhi with all aspects after said [meditative equipoise]. At the time of meditating now as a beginner, when cultivating the complete training in all aspects one familiarizes with [the aspects of] impermanence and so on by way of their appearing to one's mind and one's determining these very [aspects] as being empty. During the sequential [training], again within a state of not being separated from [these aspects] being empty, one trains through bringing these aspects clearly to mind according to their order."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"598 Groundless Paths Therefore, the difference in the manners of familiarization [of these two trainings] lies in familiarizing with each aspect versus fa miliarizing with them by linking many [of them] . It may seem that, except for the mere difference of emptiness and the aspects being more or less predominant, respectively, [in these two trainings], there is no difference [between them in terms] of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. However, when one cultivates the complete training in all aspects after having attained the path of the noble ones, one does not need to familiarize with each single aspect as being unborn through having determined it as emptiness, but all conceptions of the dualistic appearances of subject and object are pure within the expanse of the single nonconceptual wisdom, just like salt having dissolved in water. It is thus that the ultimate free from all reference points of the mind becomes manifest. Therefore, [this is presented as] meditative equipoise. [On the other hand,] just as in the exam­ple of the spiritual friends of Sudhana demonstrating the liberating powers of their individual samadhis in the Gar;at/avyuhasutra, noble persons accom­plish the vast conduct of the children of the victors (such as generosity) solely through the power of samadhi. {472} Therefore, to manifest the samadhi with [all] aspects through relying on the sequential familiarization is presented as subsequent attainment. Since all reference points are at utter peace in the meditative equipoise of noble ones, there is nothing to familiarize with as different aspects, but it is also not the case that there are absolutely no aspects. For example, in the con­text of the culmination of the path of seeing, [the Abhisamayalaf1Jkdra says]: That in which generosity and so on Are mutually combined with each other And which consists of poised readiness In one single moment is the path of seeing here.1209 Thus, it explains that, in this context, the path of seeing is what has the nature of thirty-six (six times six) paramitas. Likewise, it is in the manner of all reference points being at utter peace that all the many aspects of the three knowledges are also complete within the state of the nonconceptual wisdom of meditative equipoise. Therefore, also the meaning of the expression \"com­pletely and perfectly realizing all aspects\"1210 is established. During the subsequent attainments of the seven impure bhfunis, though all the oceans of the conduct of the children of the victors are accomplished through relying on the samadhi with all aspects, [the bodhisattvas on these bhiirnis] are not able to train in the manner of this being of one taste with the expanse free from characteristics. Also, though the mere samadhi free from"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"Appendix III 599 characteristics exists on the seventh [bhfuni], it entails effort. {473} Therefore, the cultivations of the complete training in all aspects and the sequential [training] exist separately. On the eighth bhfuni and above, through relying on the samadhi of the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects, in due order all the infinite and inconceivable qualities of a tathagata are attained within the uncontaminated expanse. Therefore, through relying on the path without characteristics and free from effort, this is the phase of the two welfares of oneself and others being spontaneously present and of train­ing in the training of the equality of [ sarpsaric] existence and peace. 1211 Thus, this marks the beginning of the two cultivations of the complete training in all aspects and the sequential [training] becoming blended in an inseparable manner. On the uninterrupted path of the end of the continuum [one attains] the final supreme quality of the contaminations being completely pure within the expanse. Through relinquishing, without remainder, the sixteen qualms of clinging to the two realities as being different, 1212 meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment (the two cultivations of the complete training in all aspects and the sequential [training]) become inseparable, and prajfia and samadhi are in [perfect] balance. This is the manifestation of the wisdom of the instantaneous [training]. Furthermore, in many sutras (such as the Bhadrakalpika[sutra] and the Samadhiraja[sutra]), a multitude of doors of bodhisattva conduct are enu­merated and described as the samadhis of expanding equality and so on, {474} [all of] which are included within this samadhi of the serial [training]. As fo r the purpose of cultivating these two [trainings], it is said that, without cultivating the complete training in all aspects (familiarizing with all phenom­ena as being emptiness), one will not attain the buddhahood in which the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies, are relinquished and all phe­nomena are realized as equality. Without the cultivation of the serial [training] (gaining mastery over all knowable objects [during] subsequent attainment), one will not attain the knowledge of all aspects-all [uncontaminated] dhar­mas becoming manifest through manifesting a single uncontaminated dharma. This has the same meaning as the Uttaratantra [saying]: The purity of adventitious afflictions Such as desire, which is like a pond and so on, In brief, is said to be the fruition Of nonconceptual wisdom. The seeing of the buddha state That is endowed with the supreme of all aspects"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"600 Groundless Paths Is explained to be the fruition of the wisdom That is attained subsequent to that. 1213 In brief, the cause for attaining the two ultimate buddhakayas, that is, the ultimate practice of the mahayana path, consists of these two [trainings]. Therefore, they include many [elements] such as emptiness and compas­sion, prajfia and means, paths and bhumis, the path of seeing and the path of familiarization, what is profound and what is vast, prajfia and samadhi, relinquishment and realization, [the wisdoms of] suchness and variety, and the dharmakaya and the riipakayas. [According to] some [said two trainings] are one in nature. [For] some {475} they are partially concordant. [For] some [they refer to] what is more or less predominant, and [for] some they are cause and result. [All of these] ways [of presenting them] should be analyzed. During [the paths of] accumulation and preparation it is said that one must mainly cultivate emptiness, that is, the complete training in all aspects, because one's mind stream is bound by clinging to real existence and not liber­ated from the fetters of karma and afflictions. Once the bhiimis are attained one must primarily promote the welfare of others and [thus] mainly engage in the cultivation of the sequential [training] as the cause for the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects. Therefore, after the culminating [training] has been attained one cultivates the serial [training]. Thus, it is also suitable to comment in this way on the meaning of [the Abhisamayala111kiira saying], \"Its highest degrees, its progression ... \"1214 Therefore, some who say that the teachings on spacelike emptiness free from reference points and beyond mind represent the dharma of supreme persons such as the noble ones, while the teachings on the area of conduct as in the sutras of the last [dharma] wheel and the commentaries on their intention represent the dharma of beginners, are simply people who voice their wrong understanding of the tradition of the victors and their children. For example, what is the point of explaining the taste of raw sugar to a per­son who is chewing raw sugar? What is the benefit of arranging a banquet of many kinds of cooked food for a child that was born last night? Just as in these examples, what is the point of explaining profound actuality to the noble ones who have [already] manifested the profound? {476} Also, persons who have not seen the nature of phenomena [on] the path of seeing and who have not become familiar with the samadhis of the path of familiarization are not even able to train in the mere fully qualified six paramitiis of the mahayana path, let alone in the vast conduct of bodhisattvas who have attained inconceivable liberation. [The Mahayanasutrala111kara] states the defining characteristics of the six piiramitiis, such as:"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Generosity defeats its antagonistic factors, Operates through nonconceptual wisdom, Completely fulfills all desires, And matures sentient beings in three ways.1215 These can be understood through examining them. Appendix III 601 Furthermore, some say, \"Once emptiness is realized, there is no need to train in vast conduct.\" This just means to fool [people] with lies. It is only through having realized emptiness that one [can] train in conduct-how would one be able to train in conduct through not having realized emptiness? Would [small] children who are not [even] able to rise out of their beds perform dances in the middle of an audience or what? It may be argued, \"What is the point of [engaging in] conduct after emptiness has been realized? For conduct (such as generosity) is for the sake of realizing emptiness.\" For those who do not understand even a bit of the general meaning of the mahayana and who cling to inf erior paths as being the mahayana, this may be true, but [in actual fact,] it is as follows. In the context of the text's paying homage, it is said: She is the one who, through the knowledge of the path, makes those who promote the benefit of beings accomplish the welfare of the world. {477} Accordingly, since the ultimate wish of the children of the victors is the wel­fare of others, through relying on the means of the ocean of conduct (such as generosity) they completely fulfill the desires of infinite sentient beings, which is the actual main practice of the mahayana path. However, without having directly realized emptiness prior to that, they would not understand the equality of themselves and others and thus their conduct would not be completely pure. Therefore, the direct perception of emptiness represents the preliminary of the vast conduct of the children of the victors, but how could it possibly be the primary ultimate object to be strived for through the mahayana path? As the Mahayanasutralalflkdra says: Having realized the nature of phenomena here, They continue to train in superior ethics, Superior mind, and superior prajfi.a ... 1216 Likewise, in the context of the classification of bodhisattvas, it is explained that, during the seven impure bhiimis, [bodhisattvas] dwell in conduct. Again, [some people] may think, \"As for conduct, it is in the tantras that one needs conduct, but it is not the final [point] of the mahayana path. For"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"602 Groundless Paths in the siitra collections the Bhagavan said that, as long as one has not attained the eighth bhii.mi, one has not [received] the prophecy by the buddhas [about one's enlightenment] and thus dwells in conduct. Once one has attained the eighth bhii.mi, one is completely beyond all conduct {478} and therefore [receives] the prophecy.\" The meaning of this [statement by the Buddha] is as follows. As explained above, up through the seventh bhiimi there is no path without characteristics and free from effort. Therefore, since nonconceptual­ity and the conduct for the welfare of others are not united, in such conduct there [still] exists a subtle element of clinging to real existence. Therefore, this is explained as \"dwelling in conduct.\" Once the eighth bhiimi is attained, through [the path] without characteristics and free from effort becoming manifest one is free from even the [most] subtle clinging to conduct and it occurs in a spontaneously present manner. This is described as \"being beyond conduct.\" However, in this context here, out of the concern that, upon [bod­hisattvas on the eighth bhiimi and above] entering the peaceful expanse of nonconceptuality, this will become a nirvaJ;la of extinction, it is said that the buddhas urge them again and again [to promote] the welfare of others. So, if [such] conduct is not the final [point] of the path, what is the point of [the buddhas] urging [those bodhisattvas]? You may wonder, \"But if the training in conduct (such as generosity) is not for the sake of realizing emptiness, this contradicts the Bodhicarytlvattlra saying: All of these branches Were taught by the sage for the sake of pra jfta. \"1217 The prajfta in this context is the nondual wisdom of buddhas, as is stated by master Dignaga [in the opening lines of his Prajfltlptlramittlrthasa,.,graha]: Prajftaparamita is nondual wisdom, Which is the Tathagata.121s {479} In the context of identifying the nature of the prajfia in the passages of the chapter on prajfia [in the Bodhicarytlvattlra], prajna is identified as the expanse free from reference points: Once neither entities nor nonentities Remain before the mind, There is no other mental flux [either]. Therefore, it is utter nonreferential peace.1219"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"Appendix III 603 Thus, immediately after the rebuttal of the objection that it fo llows that the n1pakayas (the welfare of others) do not arise [from the dharmakaya, the Bodhicaryavatara] explains: Just as a wish-fulfilling jewel and a wish-fulfilling tree Fully satisfy [all] desires, Likewise, the appearances of the victors are seen Because of their aspiration prayers and those to be guided. 1220 You may say, \"Though this is the case, the main fa ctor of the mahayana path is the prajfia of realizing identitylessness. What is to be strived for through the mahayana path is the buddhahood in which the two obscurations have been relinquished, and this must be perceived by profound prajna.\" Why have you still not relinquished and keep voicing nothing but your bad ideas [caused by] your clinging to inferior paths as being the mahayana? What is to be strived fo r through the mahayana path is not the buddhahood in which the two obscurations have been relinquished. In the context of its paying homage, [the Abhisamayala1pkara says] : Being united with her, the sages proclaim this variety endowed with all aspects. Thus, it explains that the buddhas (the persons), through relying on the knowledge of all aspects (the means), turn the wheel of dharma (the fruition). If the ultimate object to be strived fo r {480} were buddhahood, what would be the point here in said fruition [of turning the wheel of dharma]? Therefore, both temporarily and ultimately, the primary object to be strived for through the mahayana path is the welfare of others. As fo r the actual means to accomplish this, during the phase of the path it consists of enlightened conduct (such as generosity), and during the phase of the fruition it consists of the enlightened activity of a buddha. Since the main cause that precedes or accomplishes these two is prajfia, prajfia is explained to be supreme and primary. The [Prajnaparamita]sa1pcayagatha [says] : And What precedes practicing generosity is prajfia, And so it is with ethics, patience, vigor, and dhyana. It takes hold of the virtuous dharmas so that they may not be lost.1221 How could billions of people born blind, without a guide And also ignorant of the way, find entrance to a city?"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"604 Groundless Paths Without prajii.a the five eyeless paramitas Will not reach enlightenment without their guide.1222 Since prajii.a is said to precede [the other five paramitas] like a guide for those born blind, one first gives rise to nonconceptual wisdom-the realization of emptiness-in one's own mind stream and then, by way of the ocean of con­duct of the children of the victors (such as generosity), emphasizes the benefit of others for incalculable eons, thus {481} manifesting the true end through completion, maturation, and purification. This is the unerring coherence of the path. In the context of explaining the order of the six paramitas, it is said that one guards one's ethics without considering possessions and that one is patient if one guards one's ethics. Thus, the former and latter are causes and results, respectively. [The scriptures] also speak of their differences in terms of being superior and inferior: Generosity accomplishes possessions. And ethics, the higher realms. Meditation relinquishes the afflictions And prajii.a relinquishes all afflictive and cognitive [obscurations]. Therefore, it is superior, and its cause is studying this. What these [statements] have in mind are the generosity and so on on the level of ordinary beings. It is also suitable to comment on the meaning of the above quotes from the Bodhicaryiivatiira in this way. Therefore, to train in the gathering of the accumulation of purifying one's mind stream (such as generosity) during [the paths of] accumulation and preparation represents merely the cause for the arising of the profound view in one's mind stream. However, [in this context, the paramitas] represent neither the practice of the vast bodhisattva conduct of the children of the victors nor the fully qualified six paramitas. They are neither endowed with nonconcep­tual wisdom, nor have they undermined their antagonistic factors, nor are the desires of sentient beings completely fulfilled through these [paramitas], nor do they establish [beings] in any one of the three enlightenments according to their potentials. {482} Therefore, not even one among the four characteris­tics [of fully qualified paramitas] is complete.1223 Furthermore, since they lack the accomplishment of the four qualities, the relinquishment of the seven attachments, 1224 and so on, they lack the [true] meaning of \"paramita,\" just as the meditation on repulsiveness by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas does not represent the paramita of dhyana in the mahayana. If this is taught through an example to learned persons, they will under­stand it. Therefore, I shall give the following example. When skillful physicians"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"Appendix III 605 prepare concoctions with the precious substance of mercury, they first purify the mercury by way of polishing, washing, and refining it. Once it has become free from poison, it is joined with various kinds of medicinal substances and thus dispels all the various diseases of sentient beings. Just as in this example, bodhisattvas give rise in their mind streams to precious bodhicitta-the sin­gle cause fo r dispelling all degenerations of [satp.saric] existence and peace without exception. Since, on the level of ordinary beings, this [bodhicitta] is associated with the poison of self-interest, they [start by] fa miliarizing with profound emptiness and, through directly perceiving the nature of phenom­ena on the path of seeing, [eventually] realize the equality of [all] phenomena and become free from all stains of self-interest. Once [their bodhicitta thus] has become pure, the entire ocean of conduct of the children of the victors {483} is joined with the manner of not conceiving the three spheres. By way of the [resulting] marvelous vigor in which one's own welfare has vanished, [this bodhicitta] cures all diseases of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations of sentient beings without exception. Also the passage in the DharaJ:aisvararajapariprcchasutra that speaks [of this] by way of the example of cleansing a jewel teaches exactly this pro­gression of the path. The first two [stages] in this [progression] are easy to understand, but the Sutrasamu ccayabhii$ya and other [texts] explain that the discourses of the irreversible [dharma] wheel during the last stage represent the path of the union of means (great compassion) and prajiia (emptiness). To be pure of the three spheres represents the conducts of the children of the victors (such as generosity) because they are practiced in the manner of not observing the three spheres. Also, the supreme noble Nagarjuna, through adducing this very passage [from the DharaJ:aiSvararajapariprcchasutra and many others] in his Sutrasamuccaya, 1225 proves that, ultimately, there is [only] a single yana. [The sii.tra] says that, after first having given rise to weariness for satp.sara by way of [familiarizing with) impermanence, suffering, and so on, one then enters the profound and vast mahayana. This establishes that the paths of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are merely stepping stones fo r the mahayana. The venerable bodhisattva Asailga [also] adduces said passage in his commentary on the Uttaratantra1226 and {484} says that the mind streams of bodhisattvas are purified according to this progression. Therefore, he takes [this passage] as a proof fo r the basic tathagata element, saying that this estab­lishes what is to be purified-the pure basic element that is the [tathagata] heart-as existent. No matter in which one among these two [explanations of said passage] , during the first stage the mind is purified through [familiarizing with] imper­manence, suffering, and so on. During the second stage, through relying on the discourses on the three doors to liberation, the true nature of the profound"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"606 Groundless Paths view is directly perceived. During the third stage, through relying on the dis­courses of the irreversible [dharma] wheel and the discourses on being pure of the three spheres, one trains in the vast conduct of bodhisattvas. Since pre­cisely this progression of the path is asserted by both [great] system founders, one is called \"learned\" if one knows how to unite the stainless texts of these two supreme ornaments of Jambudvipa without contradiction and thus fully combine them in the practice of a single person. On the other hand, through holding on tight to disputes out of sectarian attachment and aversion one will [only] accumulate the karma of rejecting the dharma in a severe way, but one's mind stream will not become liberated through studying [the dharma]. In brief, what is primarily to be strived for through the mahayana path is the enlightened activity of a buddha that establishes all sentient beings, who fill the reaches of space, in the unsurpassable state of perfect buddhahood. Therefore, {485} the roots of virtue of bodhisattvas, the children of the victors, are inex­haustible and unlimited. The [Arya]bhadracarya[praiJidhiinariija says]: Just as far as the reaches of space extend, That far is the reach of all sentient beings without exception. Just as far as karma and afflictions reach, That far my aspiration prayers reach.1227 Otherwise, if what is to be strived for through the mahayana path were, tem­porarily, merely the realization of the actuality of profound emptiness and, ultimately, merely the attainment of the buddhahood in which one's own mind stream is liberated from the fe tters of the two obscurations, the roots of virtue of bodhisattvas, the children of the victors,' would be exhausted in, and limited to, just that. This would be comparable to the example of attaining the nirvat)a without remainder on the inferior paths. For genuine beings there is no need for such explanations since they would just [come down to attempts to] establish again what is already established [for these beings]. However, some [people] with inferior minds whose fortune equals mine, when they first [attempt to] give rise to the mindset [of bodh­icitta], may generate this mindset due to seeing the qualities of buddhahood and, considering the respective superiority and inferiority of [the Buddhist] paths, aspire for the level of a buddha. In brief, they may be conceited [by taking] other [kinds ofj generating the mindset [for the path], which do not arise from compassion as their root, to represent the [true] generation of the mindset of the mahayana. In the context of the path, they may think that, once emptiness is realized, there is absolutely no need to train in generosity and so on. {486} Due to being mistaken about the mere words \"The path of familiarization is what causes familiarity with what was seen already,\" they"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Appendix III 607 may think that, once one has attained the path of seeing, it is merely through familiarizing with just this nonconceptual wisdom that one will become a buddha. Not understanding that the difference between the hinayana and the mahayana is marked by generating the mindset and the conduct of a bodhi­sattva, they may think that it is marked by the view-emptiness-alone. They may think that the mahayana is [the greater yana] by virtue of what seems to be a profound dharma terminology of view and meditation without any altruistic motivation and training whatsoever. Also, they may cling to the two stainless traditions of the profound view and vast activity as being opposed to each other, just like fire and water. Likewise, they may be seized by biased clinging to either one of the middling and the final [dharma] wheels that are the words of the victor and thus view them as separate by being conceited about just the [one of them] being sufficient. For [such people] I wonder if there isn't some small benefit [in the above explanations]. Thus, it is fine if I incurred the flaw of repeating explanations of the same meaning again and again-! am someone who does not shy away from that. Furthermore, in these modem times, the fortunate ones who wish to train in the unerring highway of the mahayana, on the level of ordinary beings, through relying on [the literature of] mind training and the progressive stages of the path (such as the Bodhicaryavatara), {487} [should] first [make] their mind streams free from being obstinate and arrogant, just as one beats and straightens, respectively, a [raw] hide and an arrow. Thereafter, through rely­ing on the texts, such as the Miila[madhyamakakarika]prajfta[nama], by the glorious protector, noble and venerable Nagarjuna, [they should] determine the view of being free from reference points by way of cutting through the superimpositions of clinging to extremes with regard to the meaning of the profound view and thus eradicating even the [most] subtle focal objects of clinging to real existence. Still not being content with just that much, [they should] examine the profound words of the Buddha in the profound final [dharma] wheel and the stainless scriptural tradition of [Maitreya,] the regent of the victor, and his followers, thus turning their minds toward the unsur­passable ever-excellent conduct. Without tightening their minds through a short-term [attitude in terms of] just a single lifetime (just like a fresh hide that was put into a fire), [they should] put on their path of studying even the oceanlike conduct of the children of the victors that is beyond the confines of the mind, that is, the [vast] deeds that are based on the door to liberation which is the inconceivable measure of the extent of space and the extent of sentient beings. As [the Aryabhadracaryapra�;Zidhanaraja says]: May my conducts be without measure. May my qualities also be measureless."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"608 Groundless Paths Abiding in conducts without measure, I shall send out all [kinds of] emanations.1228 Accordingly, {488} I think how wonderful it would be if all the stainless tradi­tions of the victors and the children of the victors within the framework set by this highway of the profound and vast mother of the victors served as one's objects through unequivocally striving and aspiring for them. Whoever realizes this path of the profound and vast mahayana, The essential point of combining the profound and the vast without contradiction, The principle of profundity and vastness, Is taken care of by this mother of the victors. As for the fruition of having practiced said path by way of this special motiva­tion and training, it consists of the dharmakaya with its enlightened activity, which will be understood [in detail] from the text. In general, the final fruition is exactly what is to be strived for through the initial motivation of the chil­dren of the victors. Therefore, what is actually to be accomplished through the bodhisattva path is the altruistic activity for the welfare of beings, which is so great in its being permanent, all-pervading, and spontaneously present until satpsara is emptied. Its foundation is the dharmakaya and this dharmakaya has the two aspects of relinquishment and realization. From among these, the actual dominant condition for the altruistic deeds of enlightened activity is realization, that is, the wisdom dharmakaya. Therefore, the presentation of the body [of the Abhisamayala111kara says]: The dharmakaya, together with its activity ... 1229 Also, [its second] summary of the clear realizations [states]: And the fruition (the dharmakaya and enlightened activity) ... 1230 Thus, {489} the manifestation of the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects surely represents the handprint of having relinquished the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies. However, it is asserted that even sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, upon having entered [the nirvai}.a] without remain­der on the inferior paths, have relinquished the two obscurations in terms of there being no foundation [for them anymore]. Hence, the difference between the fruitions of the hinayana and the mahayana is said to not be marked by way of relinquishment, but by way of realization-the wisdom"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"Appendix III 609 dharmakaya, including its activity. Therefore, and because the initial motiva­tion is unerringly identified by giving rise to the mindset of the mahayana, it was explained above that what is to be strived for through the mahayana path is not the buddhahood in which the two obscurations have been relinquished. However, this does not contradict the explanation that [this buddhahood] is the ultimate object of striving or result [of the mahayana] in terms of taking it as what is to be accomplished in the mind streams of others. Though bud­dhahood and the knowledge of all aspects are discussed individually in some contexts, ultimately, they are inseparable. If the eight clear realizations are presented as ground, path, and fruition in this way, in the context of the [Abhisamayala1pkara's second] summary of the clear realizations [it is said]: The threefold object (the cause) ... 1231 [In the commentaries] there are the two explanations of linking \"the cause\" [in this line] with the preceding [words] versus linking it with what follows, but they are similar in meaning. Therefore, it is explained that, after having determined the three knowledges (the ground) through study and reflection, they are made a living experience through cultivating the four trainings (the path), through which the dharmakaya (the fruition) is manifested. {490} According to what was explained here, in terms of motivation and training it is also suitable to take ground, path, and fruition as [these] two elements. First, for the sake of manifesting the fruition, the knowledge of all aspects, through relying on the knowledge of all the paths of the children of the vic­tors and before training in altruistic conduct, entities-all phenomena of skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas-are realized in the manner of their being free from the thirty-two superimpositions. Secondly, after having condensed all phenomena that consist of the three knowledges (the ground) into the three [kinds of] being without arising, through the complete training in all aspects one familiarizes with [these phenomena] as being emptiness. Based on that, through the sequential [training] all the many wisdoms of realizing the path that have arisen in one's mind stream are stabilized. Through this the temporary fruitions (both the culminating and the instantaneous [trainings]) and the ultimate fruition (the dharmakaya, including its enlightened activity) are manifested. Then, until sarpsara is emptied, the [operational] mode of vast and uninterrupted altruistic enlightened activity takes place in a way that is spontaneously present and without any effort or strain.

Definition ·-The naturally abiding disposition is explained in three ways-in terms of the isolates of (1) lucid awareness (the bearer of the nature of emptiness), (2) emptiness (the former's true nature), and (3) the dharmadhatu (their unity). In terms of (1), Uttaratantra 1.104c says: And Likewise, the uncontaminated wisdom in beings is like honey ... Nagarjuna's collection of praises says: Buddhas spring from a sound mind at ease. I bow to my own mind.1272 Just so, wisdom in afflictions Stays without a single stain. 1273 In terms of (2), the Ratnakuta says: That in which there is not even the slightest conditioning is uncon­ditioned. That which is unconditioned is the disposition of the noble ones. By virtue of its being equal to space, this disposition is without distinctions. Since this disposition is the suchness of phe­nomena at all times, it is permanent by virtue of being the single taste of [all] phenomena. In terms of (3), the Avata111sakasutra says: 0 children of the victors, what is called \"the disposition of bodhi­sattvas\" is to be completely devoted to the dharmadhatu, which is as vast as the sky and naturally luminous.

Here the dharmadhatu that is the unity of lucidity and emptiness, the sug­ata heart, and alaya-wisdom1274 are synonyms. These exist at the times of the ground, the path, and the fruition.

The third one is the ultimate dharmadhatu that is endowed with twofold purity. 2.2.4.2. Division in terms of illustrating examples In terms of the root of the sugata heart, it is exemplified by the dharmakaya, suchness, and the disposition, as in Uttaratantra 1.28. In terms of its branches, the dharmakaya is threefold-the dharmakaya of the very pure dharmadhatu, the profound dharmakaya, and the vast dharmakaya. The disposition is five­fo ld-in terms of its nature, it consists of the two dispositions and, in terms of its potential, of the three kayas. For Uttaratantra I. 144 says: Its nature is the dharmakaya, Suchness, and the disposition, Which are to be understood through Three examples, five, and one, respectively. In the detailed explanation of the dharmakaya, Uttaratantra 1. 145 says: The dharmakaya is to be known as twofold­The very stainless dharmadhatu And its natural outflow, teaching The principles of profundity and of diversity. In the detailed explanation of the disposition, Uttaratantra 1.149f says: Like a treasure and a tree from a fruit ...

The manner in which the disposition is awakened This has three parts: 1) The signs of the disposition having been awakened 2) Its obstacles 3) Its benefit 2.3.1.1. The signs of the disposition having been awakened According to Mahayanasiitrala,.,kara 111.5, before training in the path the qualities of motivation are natural great compassion and aspiration for the dharma of the mahayana. The qualities of applying that motivation on the path are endurance for the hardships of practicing the dharma and the proper engagement in virtues such as generosity. 2.3.1.2. Its obstacles According to Mahayanasutrala'7Jkara III.7, the obstacles for the awakening of the disposition are being greatly habituated to the afflictions, bad companion­ship, being deprived of the favorable conditions for practicing the dharma, and being under the sway of nonvirtuous spiritual friends. 2.3.1.3. Its benefit As Mahayanasutrala,.,kara III.13 says, the mahayana disposition is like the excellent root of a tree: Because of growing the tree of enlightenment with its very vast qualities, Because of attaining wealth, happiness, and the pacification of suffering, And because of its fruition of bestowing benefit and happiness onto oneself and others, This supreme disposition is like an excellent root. 2.3.2. The manner in which it serves as the disposition This has two parts: 1) By way of being a foundation 2) By way of being a focal object 2.3.2.1. By way of being a foundation What serves as the disposition by way of being the foundation of practice is the true nature of cognition with stains. AA 1.37-38 says:"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"Appendix IX 659 The foundation for the six dharmas of realization Is called \"the disposition.\" The Vivrti on this states: It is through the particulars of the different phases of the dharmas of practice that nothing but the nature of the dharmadhatu, which serves as the basis of the dharmas of all thirteen kinds of bodhisat­tvas as explained, is taught as \"the disposition. 1279 2.3.2.2. By way of being a focal object The disposition also serves as the disposition by way of being a focal object because it is in dependence on focusing on, and familiarizing with, the dharmadhatu through the practice of the mahayana that the stains are pro­gressively purified and the realization of the nature of phenomena becomes consummate. The gist of this presentation of the disposition is that the true nature of cognition with stains in the mind stream of a bodhisattva on the path of preparation is the foundation of practice (the naturally abiding disposition) because it is the true nature with stains that serves as the foundation and basis of what is founded on it (the practice of the mahayana)."},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"• • • • • • • • • Appendix X: PGSD's explanation of the signs of irreversibility1280 This has four parts: 1) The irreversible persons 2) The objects from which one can be irreversible 3) The causes through which one can be irreversible 4) The nature of the signs of irreversibility 1.

Establishing the boundary line of first attaining the signs of irreversibility This has two parts: 1) The actual explanation 2) Analysis as to whether the signs of irreversibility have or have not been attained 1.1.1.1. The actual explanation In general, irreversibility exists even from the path of accumulation onward because it is impossible, through both motivation and application, for those with sharp faculties on the mahayana path of accumulation to enter the paths of inferior yanas. However, these bodhisattvas are not presented here as those who have attained the signs of irreversibility because they are not able to dem­onstrate, primarily from the perspective of others, the special physical and"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"662 Groundless Paths verbal behaviors that concord with their own realizations and therefore it is difficult for persons with realizations inferior to theirs to gain certainty about their irreversibility. Therefore, the boundary line of first attaining the signs of irreversibility is the path of preparation. As for those of uncertain disposition, those with sharp faculties attain said signs on the path of preparation; those of medium faculties, on the seven impure bhumis; and all remaining bodhisat­tvas, on the pure bhfimis. 1.1.1.2. Analysis as to whether the signs of irreversibility have or have not been attained If bodhisattvas possess the special realization of it being impossible for them, through both motivation and application, to enter any inferior paths, they are necessarily irreversible from unsurpassable enlightenment. The meaning of having attained the signs of irreversibility is to be able to demonstrate, primarily from the perspective of others to be guided, the special physical and verbal behaviors that concord with the realizations in one's own mind stream. 1.1.2. Identifying the subjects to be established as irreversible here In general, bodhisattvas are of three types-(1) those who are certain to enter paths of the hinayana, (2) those whose disposition is certain as the mahayana one, and (3) those who are of uncertain disposition. Among these, (1) are not to be identified as the persons in question who are to be established as being irreversible here because they cannot be established as such through any signs of irreversibility. (2) Among those whose disposition is certain as the mahayana one, there are (a) those who are irreversible through the power of their disposition and (b) those who are irreversible through the power of realization. On (a), Mahayanasutralarrrkara 111.5 says: Prior to training, compassion, Aspiration, patience, And engagement in virtue Are explained as the signs of the disposition. Accordingly, through being endowed with these four conditions that awaken the disposition, these bodhisattvas cannot be led onto any inferior paths. (b) As for those who are irreversible through the power of realization, it is through the power of the unity of great compassion and the prajfia of realizing emptiness primarily by way of what arises from meditation that it is impossible for them to abandon the realization of the mahayana. This is"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"Appendix X 663 also called \"the inner mentor.\" This type of bodhisattva is not primarily to be identified as the persons in question who are to be established as being irreversible here either because [others] have only some minor doubts about whether they are reversible. (3) Thus, it is the bodhisattvas of uncertain disposition with sharp faculties on the path of preparation and those with medium faculties on the impure bhOmis who are the primary ones to be identified as the persons in question who are to be established as being irreversible here. 1.2. Definitions The general definition of the irreversible SaJllgha is \"the mahayana persons for whom it is impossible, through both motivation and application, to enter inferior yanas.\" The definition of the irreversible SaJllgha that is explictly taught here in the AA is \"the children of the victors who attained the signs of irreversibility in their own mind streams.\" 1.3. Divisions Said irreversible bodhisattvas are threefold. Those on the path of preparation are defined as \"the bodhisattvas fo r whom it is impossible, through both moti­vation and application, to enter inferior yanas and who abide in the mahayana factors conducive to penetration.\" Those on the path of seeing are defined as \"said bodhisattvas who abide on the first bhfimi.\" Those on the path of famil­iarization are defined as \"said bodhisattvas who abide in the subsequent clear realizations.\" Each of these is twofold-those who have and have not attained the signs of irreversibility. 2. The objects from which one can be irreversible In general, there are four kinds of objects from which one can be irrevers­ible-mere enlightenment, unsurpassable enlightenment, the supramundane level, and the level of effortlessness. In due order, these irreversibilities exist from the path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the first bhfimi, and the eighth bhOmi. The signs of irreversibility that are taught here are pre­sented in terms of whether one is or is not irreversible from unsurpassable enlightenment. 3. The causes through which one can be irreversible This has two parts: 1) Being irreversible through the power of motivation 2) Being irreversible through the power of application"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"664 Groundless Paths 3.1. Being irreversible through the power of motivation This has two parts: 1) Nature 2) Boundary lines 3.1.1. Nature The first one means to be endowed with the special motivation in which there is not even the slightest doubt about falling away from the great compassion that focuses on sentient beings or from the generation of bodhicitta on the level of seeming reality. 3.1.2. Boundary lines According to the Marmakaumudi, 1281 the boundary lines of this irreversibility are that even bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of accumulation attain it. Among those with uncertain disposition, those with sharp facul­ties attain it on the path of preparation; those with medium faculties, on the impure bhfunis; and all others, on the pure bhfimis. 3.2. Being irreversible through the power of application This has two parts: 1) Nature 2) Boundary lines 3.2.1. Nature In this type of being irreversible, it is through the power of being embraced by spiritual friends (the outer mentor) and both means and prajfia (the inner men­tor) that it is impossible to fall away from the special conduct of the mahayana. 3.2.2. Boundary lines This type of irreversibility is attained on the mahayana path of preparation by all bodhisattvas whose disposition is certain or uncertain alike because being embraced by the above two types of mentors is explained as the noble dhar­mas that make those on the mahayana path of preparation more eminent than those on the hinayana paths of preparation. 4. !he nature of the signs of irreversibility This has three parts: 1) Definition 2) Divisions 3) The manner in which they serve as signs of irreversibility"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"Appendix X 665 4.1.

Divisions This has three parts: 1) Division in terms of the persons who are their support 2) Division in terms of their instances 3) Division in terms of debate 4.2.1. Division in terms of the persons who are their support (1) The definition of the signs of irreversibility of those on the path of prepa­ration is \"the reasons for being irreversible that have the capacity to establish the bodhisattvas on the path of preparation who possess them as being irreversible.\" They are divided in three ways. (a) The division in terms of their nature consists of the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment that operate simultaneously with the realizations of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. (b) The division in terms of qualities is threefold. The reasons for irreversibility that consist of aspects are physi­cal qualities such as one's body hairs standing on end upon hearing about the special qualities of the mahayana. The reasons for irreversibility that consist of signs are verbal qualities such as supplicating special objects due to the arising of said physical qualities. The reasons for irreversibility that consist of characteristics refer to the engagement of properly practicing the dharma due to the arising of the former two qualities. (c) The division in terms of objects is twentyfold-the eleven of heat, the six of peak, the two of poised readiness, and the one of the supreme dharma. (2) The definition of the signs of irreversibility of those on the path of see­ing is \"the reasons for being irreversible that have the capacity to establish the bodhisattvas on the path of seeing who possess them as being irreversible.\" Their instances consist of the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment that operate simultaneously with the realization of the meditative equipoise of bodhisattvas with medium faculties on the path of seeing and their knowledge of subsequent attainment that represents the result of said meditative equipoise. Their divisions in terms of qualities and aspects are as under (1) and their division in terms of objects consists of the sixteen reasons that represent the sixteen moments of readinesses and cognitions. (3) The definition of the signs of irreversibility of those on the path of familiarization is \"the reasons for being irreversible that have the capacity to"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"666 Groundless Paths establish the bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization who possess them as being irreversible.\" Their instances are as under (2), just replacing \"bodhisat­tvas with medium faculties on the path of seeing\" with \"bodhisattvas with medium faculties on the path of familiarization.\" Their divisions in terms of qualities and aspects are as under (1) and their division in terms of objects consists of the eight reasons of the profundity of arising, ceasing, suchness, object, cognition, engagement in practice, the nonduality of apprehender and apprehended, and skill in means. 4.2.2. Division in terms of their instances This has three parts: 1) Nature reasons 2) Result reasons 3) Reasons of nonobservation 4.2.2.1. Nature reasons Nature reasons are such as \"Bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation (the subject) are those in whose mind streams the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects is suitable to arise because they are the bodhisattvas in whose mind streams the number of causes in the collection of the causes for the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects being suitable to arise without being interrupted by any other yanas is complete.\" Pramiit�avarttika 1.7 states: The inference that A result arises from the collection of its causes, Since it does not depend on any other referents, Is expressed as being a nature [reason]. On the collection of the causes for the knowledge of all aspects, the first three lines of the opening verse of the Madhyamakavatara say: Buddhas are born from bodhisattvas, And compassion, a nondual mind, And bodhicitta are the causes of the children of the victors-4.2.2.2. Result reasons Result reasons are such as \"Bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation who possess the special physical and verbal behaviors during sub­sequent attainment (the subject) are those who previously have attained the realization that makes it impossible for them, through both motivation and application, to enter any paths of inferior yanas because they are endowed"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"Appendix X 667 with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment that are not tainted by the motivation of mentally engaging in their own welfare and are embraced by the special prajfia of realizing emptiness. For example, on a mountain pass with smoke (the subject) there is fire because there is smoke.\" This corresponds to the Dasadharmakasutra1282 saying: Just as [the existence of] fire is known due to smoke And [the existence of] water is known due to water birds, The disposition of intelligent bodhisattvas Is known due to its signs. 4.2.2.3. Reasons of nonobservation Reasons of nonobservation are such as, \"Bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation (the subject) are not persons who are reversible from unsurpassable enlightenment because it is it impossible for them, through both motivation and application, to enter any paths of inferior yanas.\" 4.2.3. Division in terms of debate This has two parts: 1) Reasons in the context of inferences for one's own sake 2) Reasons in the context of inferences for the sake of others 4.2.3.1. Reasons in the context of inferences for one's own sake These are those reasons for irreversibility that do not depend on being formu­lated as reasons by the defender from the perspective of the challenger. An instance of them is represented by bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation seeing that certain bodhisattvas with medium faculties on the path of seeing are endowed with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment and, based on that, knowing through their own power that the latter are irreversible. 4.2.3.2. Reasons in the context of inferences for the sake of others These are those reasons for irreversibility that do depend on being formulated as reasons by the defender from the perspective of the challenger. An instance of them is represented by bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization who possess the dharma vision of realization formulating, from the perspective of bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation who wish to understand this, the following reasoning: \"Bodhisattvas with medium faculties on the path of seeing who are endowed with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment (the subject) are irreversible from unsurpassable enlightenment because they are bodhisattvas who are endowed"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"668 Groundless Paths with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment and for whom it is impossible, through both motivation and application, to enter any paths of inferior yanas.\" These reasons are divided into four-those that are formulated by someone who has attained the signs of irreversibility for someone who has attained them too, those that are fo rmulated by someone who has attained them for someone who has not attained them, those that are formulated by someone who has not attained them fo r someone who has attained them, and those that are formulated by someone who has not attained them for someone who has not attained them either. 4.3. The manner in which the signs of irreversibility serve as signs This has three parts: 1) The manner in which they serve as signs from one's own perspective 2) The manner in which they serve as signs from the perspective of others 3) The manner in which they are taught in the AA 4.3.1. The manner in which they serve as signs from one's own perspective The realizations of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment as well as the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment can all three serve as signs of irreversibility from one's own perspective because, by virtue of the signs of the meditative equipoise, the subsequent attainment, and the special physical and verbal behaviors during [subsequent attainment] in their mind streams, bodhisattvas of medium faculties on the path of seeing can be certain about their being irreversible. 4.3.2. The manner in which they serve as signs from the perspective of others This has two parts: 1) General explanation 2) Eliminating qualms 4.3.2.1. General explanation Both meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment can serve as signs of irreversibility from the perspective of others. For example, from the perspec­tive of bodhisattvas on the path of preparation who wish to understand this, one can say, \"Bodhisattvas with medium faculties on the path of seeing who possess the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attain­ment (the subject) are those who previously have attained the realization that makes it impossible for them, through both motivation and applica­tion, to enter any paths of inferior yanas because they are bodhisattvas who are endowed with such special physical and verbal behaviors during subse­quent attainment.\" By virtue of this reason the realization of their meditative"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"Appendix X 669 equipoise is established. Then, by virtue of the reason of the realization of their meditative equipoise, certainty about their being irreversible is gained, saying, \"Bodhisattvas of medium fa culties on· the path of seeing who are abid­ing in meditative equipoise (the subject) are irreversible from unsurpassable enlightenment because they are bodhisattvas who abide in the realization of meditative equipoise that makes it impossible for them, through both motiva­tion and application, to enter any paths of inferior yanas.\" 4.3.2.2. Eliminating qualms One may also say, \"Bodhisattvas of sharp fa culties on the path of seeing who are endowed with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment (the subject) are irreversible from unsurpassable enlightenment because they are bodhisattvas who are endowed with the special physical and verbal behaviors during subsequent attainment that make it impossible fo r them, through both motivation and application, to enter any paths of inferior yanas.\" In this reasoning, the connection in the entailment can be established either by way of an autonomous valid cognition through the power of entities or by way of a valid cognition of informed trust that is based on scriptures. In the first case, one must have attained the signs of irreversibility oneself because those who have not attained them are not able to realize, by way of a valid cognition through the power of entities, the connection in the entailment in the mind streams of others. In the second case, one does not have to have attained said signs oneself because these signs can serve as such signs fr om the perspective of bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of accumulation who are learned in the divisions of these signs and are greatly erudite. 4.3.3. The manner in which these signs are taught in the AA You may wonder, \"In the context of the presentation of the body of the text, AA 1.12d speaks of 'the assembly of irreversible learners.' How many divisions of the irreversible sarp.gha are there and through which reasons fo r irreversibil­ity are they established?\" The irreversible sarp.gha is threefold-(!) irreversible bodhisattvas on the paths of preparation, (2) seeing, and (3) familiarization. ( 1) Irreversible bodhisattvas on the path of preparation are explained in AA IV.39-45, with \"by virtue of twenty kinds of signs, such as turning away from fo rm and so on\" in IV.39 teaching the reason; \"those who dwell on the branches of penetration,\" the subject; \"irreversibility,\" the predicate to be proven; and \"the characteristics,\" the establishment of the entailment. The same applies for the detailed explanation in IV.40-45. (2) Irreversible bodhisattvas on the path of seeing are explained in IV .46-51, with \"the sixteen moments of readiness and cognition on the path of see­ing\" in IV.46 teaching the reason; \"bodhisattvas,\" the subject; \"irreversible,\""},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"670 Groundless Paths the predicate to be proven; and \"should be known as the characteristics,\" the establishment of the entailment. The same applies for the detailed explana­tion in IV.47-51. (3) Irreversible bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization are explained in IV.52-53. As for the nature of the path of familiarization, the number of its divisions, and of what kind the instances of its signs are, the distinctive feature of the mahayana path of familiarization being more profound than the hinayana paths of familiarization by way of its realizing objects is taught by \"the path of familiarization is profound\" in IV.52. The nature of the path of familiarization is taught by \"during the branches of penetration, the path of seeing, and the path of familiarization itself' in IV .53. Its being definite in number is taught by IV .54. As for rebutting disputes with regard to \"countless and so on\" in IV.55, in line with IV.56 it may be argued, \"It follows that the mahayana path of familiarization does not perform the functions of undermining the factors to be relinquished and increasing their remedies because it is empty of real existence ultimately.\" The explanation of rebutting such disputes about the temporary functions of the path of familiarization is taught in IV .57. In line with IV.58ab it may be argued, \"It follows that it is untenable for unsurpassable enlightenment to be accomplished by the generation of bodhicitta because it cannot be attained through any earlier or later moments of the generation of bodhicitta on their own, nor through many of them coming together, nor through their being dependent on each other.\" The explanation of rebutting such disputes about the ultimate function of the path of familiarization is taught in IV.58c through the example of a lamp. The explanation of the actual divisions of the reason for establishing the irreversible bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization is found in IV.59 (\"profundity in arising\" and so on). Though the subject and the predicate to be proven are not explicitly taught in the AA, they can be taught in a supple­mentary manner by replacing \"seeing\" in IV.Slcd (\"the signs of irreversibility of the intelligent who dwell on the path of seeing\") by \"familiarization.\""},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"•• •• • •• • • Appendix XI: The diff erent models of the sequence of the samiidhis of

Though all of these numbered headings are retained in the translation, for the reader's convenience the Tables of Contents of both texts are simplified and organized accord­ing to the eight topics and the seventy points of the AA. I am also breaking with the tradition of presenting the entire outline of a Tibetan text as an appendix. The outlines of PSO and PBG are unfortunately more confusing than helpful since the main headings of the outlines do not corre­spond to the actual topics of the AA, which are buried somewhere in a plethora of subheadings. 2 The image here alludes to this river being considered as very holy by Hindus-even its mere sight is said to wash away all one's negative deeds (it rises on the summit of Mount Amarakal}.taka in Madhya Pradesh in Central India, and after a westerly course of about eight hundred miles ends in the Gulf of Cambay below the city of Bharuch). 3 Tib. rdza dpal sprul o rgyan 'jigs med chos kyi dbang po. 4 In due order, these three texts are Opal sprul 'jigs med chos kyi dbang po 2003c, 2003f, and 2003d. His remaining two supplementary works on the AA-2003b and 2003e-are not translated here because the former is identical to the table of contents of PBG and the latter is a brief excerpt from PSO on the twenty types of wpgha. 5 Tib. gshi chen sprul sku. 6 Tib. yon tan mdzod. 7 These two are the Satasahasrikdprajfiaparamitabrhaffikd (03807; usually ascribed to O;up.,trisena) and the Satasahasrikapaficavil11satisahasri�tadaSasahasrikdprajnaparamita­brhaffikd (03808; often ascribed to Vasubandhu). For the disputes about the authorships of these two texts, see the Introduction in Brunnholzl2010. 8 Tib. gnyal zhig 'jam dpal rdo rje. He was both a great scholar and siddha, serving as a throne holder of the upper campus of the famous Kadampa monastery of Sangpu Ne'utog (Tib. gsang phu ne'u thog). For more details, see the Introduction in Brunnholzl2010. 9 Tib. bu ston rin chen grub. 10 Tib. nya dbon kun dga' dpal. 11 In the introductory verses of his LSSP, Tsongkhapa briefly pays homage to his \"four tutors\" in a general way without even mentioning their names. These fo ur are Nyaon Kunga Bal, Yo nten Gyatso (Tib. yon tan rgya mtsho), Ugyenpa (Tib. u rgyan pa), and Rendawa ShOnnu Lodro (Tib. red mda' ba gzhon nu blo gros; 1348-1412). The latter was one of the most famous Sakya masters, a student of Nyaon, and also the early Madhyamaka teacher of Tsongkhapa, before the latter developed his own differing approach. For those familiar with Tsongkhapa's later fierce rejection of Oolpopa's views, it may be very surprising that he received teachings from Nyaon as one of the latter's main students and that his LSSP relies so much on Nyaon's"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"688 Groundless Paths commentary (interestingly, unlike for all other fields, Tsongkhapa's own record of received teachings (gsan yig) in its present form does not mention any prajftaparamita lineage). For one, LSSP is a very early text by Tsongkhapa, before he had formulated his full-fledged unique version of *Prasailgika-Madhyamaka and categorically rejected any other views. However, Tsongkhapa's reliance on Nyaon also highlights the by now well-established fact that the later so entrenched sectarian biases between different Tibetan schools did virtually not exist up through his time and that it was the norm for most masters to study with and teach scholars from other schools. In addition, unlike Dolpopa's commentary on the AA that vehemently rejects Haribhadra's expla­nations, the actual comments on the AA in Nyaon's text strictly follow Haribhadra, while he only sometimes makes excurses into Dolpopa's presentations in terms of \"Great Madhyamaka\" (a.k.a. Shentong). 12 Tib. don grub rin chen. 13 Tib. snye thang bde ba can. 14 Tib. 'jam skya nam mkha' dpal. 15 Sparham 2008b, p. xx. For more details on Tsongkhapa's prajftapiramitii studies, see ibid, p. 545. 16 In this context, it is curious that LSSP nowhere contains the verses of the AA as they stand, but only as they are embedded in (2b) and (2c). Most other commentaries, including PBG, provide, at the start of their comments on the respective verses of the AA, at least a few words of the beginning and the end of said verses, but LSSP does not do so. Therefore, it only becomes clear which verses a particular portion of LSSP is explaining after one has read through the entire respective passages in (2b). 17 The numbers of the pages in LSSP are adjusted according to the contents of the slightly shorter pages of PSD and PBG. 18 For LSSP's discussions of these subjects, see the respective sections in Sparham's transla­tion of this text (I am grateful to Sparham for providing me with electronic files of some parts of this translation). 19 Tib. a lags gzan dkar thub bstan nyi ma, born 1943. 20 Oral communication, May 13, 2010. 21 Tib. mkhan po thub bstan brtson 'grus phun tshogs. 22 Pp. 263-64. 23 Oral information from mKhan po dGa' dbang.

The matter may have been further confused by the fact that the Nyingma School has long held (see Bdud 'joms 'jigs bral ye shes rdo rje 1991, pp. 923 and 925) that the Zhus ian bdud rtsi sman mchog in Tsongkhapa's collected works partially cop­ies the Mkha' Rr\"o snying thig gi zhus ian gser phreng.

The latter text was edited (not authored) by Longchenpa as part of the Mkha' gro snying thig in the Snying thib yab bzhi. The similarity between these two texts has been confirmed more recently by Franz-Karl Ehrhard in his Flugelschli.ige des Garurja (Franz Steiner Verlag, 1990). Now, the words \"Golden Garland\" in the title of said text edited by Longchenpa may well have caused its being conflated with Tsongkhapa's LSSP, thus adding to the claim that the latter is actually by Longchenpa. I am indebted to Matthew Kapstein for providing me with this information. 28 Though PBG opens with a brief \"I pay homage to the Buddha,\" this is obviously just the homage for the beginning of the text up through bodhicitta (the first of the ten points of the knowledge of all aspects) and not for the entire text. For the next section on the instructions (the second point of the knowledge of all aspects) starts with paying homage to the dharma. Also, there are further such brief homages throughout the following chapters (such as to the saitgha in the middle of the point of the factors conducive to penetration; to the guru, before the purifica­tions of the second bhiimi; to Maitreya, in the section on the knowledge of the path of srivakas and at the beginning of the third chapter on the knowledge of entities; to Samantabhadra, in the context of the 173 aspects of the complete training in all aspects; to Vu nalakirti, before the characteristic of distinctiveness; to Avalokita, toward the end of the culminating training; and to Ajita, at the beginning of the simbhogikakiya). 29 In the current editions, only the colophon for the print by the then King of Derge, Karma Tsewang Rinchen Chogdrub (Tib. ka rma tshe dbang rin chen mchog grub), which is found at the end of PBG, attributes this text to Patrul Rinpoche, calling it \"a concise commentarial com­pendium on the Abhisamayala111kara\" (Tib. mngon rtogs rgyan bsdus 'grel kun las btus pa). 30 Haas 2008 (p. 311) suggests that it seems plausible that Patrul Rinpoche consciously chose LSSP as the basis for PSD and PBG not only for its contents, but also for diplomatic rea­sons in the sense of the Rime movement, that is, as a suitable text for studying prajftaparamiti during a politically sensitive period. 31 The colophon of this text says that Padma Gyurme Gyatso composed it according to the brief explanations by Tendzin Karwang (Tib. bstan 'dzin gar dbang). 32 Tib. pad ma 'gyur med rgya mtsho. 33 Tib. smin grol gling. 34 Tib. gter bdag gling pa. 35 As with a number of other works ascribed to Mipham Rinpoche, the colophon of MCG says that it was published posthumously in 1926 by his main spiritual heir, the Fourth Shechen Gyaltsab, Pema Namgyal (Tib. zhe chen rgyal tshab pad ma mam rgyal; 1871-1926) according to Mipham Rinpoche's notes, which had previously been copied and completed by the Third Kathog Situ, ChOkyi Gyatso (Tib. kaH thog si tu chos kyi rgya mtsho; 1880-1923/25), and edited by Khenpo K\\insang Belden (Tib. mkhan po kun bzang dpalldan; 1862-1943; a student of Patrul Rinpoche, Mipham Rinpoche, and Khenpo Padmavajra). Several later Nyingma scholars doubt Mipham Rinpoche's direct authorship of MCG since they consider its style and contents as falling short of the quality that this author generally displays in his other works. 36 According to the contemporary Kagyii master Thrangu Rinpoche, the text was given to ChOgyam Trungpa Rinpoche (1939-1987) by Khenpo Gangshar (Tib. mkhan po gang shar; 1925-1958/59). It is currently located in Akong Rinpoche's Samye Ling Center in Scotland (I am indebted to Scott Wellenbach for providing me with this information). I did not have access to the original text and, on the scans held by the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (www.tbrc.org, W2CZ5665), the handwritten notes are mostly illegible.

Therefore, for further details, the reader is referred to the respective sections and charts in Brunnholzl2010-2011. 49 PVSD (fol. 2a.4-2b.3) and MPZL (pp. 7-8) speak about the five excellences of the prajiiapiramiti sfitras. According to PVSD, the excellent teacher of the prajiiaparamiti siitras is Buddha Sakyamuni, the fourth leader in the good eon. The excellent place is the Vulture Flock Mountain in Rajagrha. The excellent retinue consists solely of those who are endowed with the disposition of the mahayana, with their prajiia being equal to the sky and their compassion being like a river stream. The excellent time is when the retinue of those to be guided has gath­ered and the time to teach them has come. The excellent dharma is the middle cycle of the words of the Buddha-the dharma wheel of the lack of characteristics. MPZL links the five excellences to the introduction in the siitra in twenty-five thousand lines (see CZ, pp. 37tf.), with the Buddha teaching the prajiiaparamiti siitras through his miraculous powers of body, speech, and mind. The excellent retinue consists of Srivakas (such as Kasyapa) endowed with fifteen qualities, such as their contaminations being terminated, and bodhisattvas (such as Bhadrapala) endowed with thirty-three qualities. 50 Literally \"chariot trailblazers.\" 51 The five texts in this collection are (1) Mulamadhyamakakarika, (2) Yuk�i4tikti, (3) Sunyattisaptati, (4) Vigrahavytivartani, and (5) Va idalyaprakara�:�a. Other Tibetan sources either add the Ratntivali or the Vyavahtirasiddhi as the sixth text, but LSSP rejects this as being mistaken. 52 Both prajiiaparamita and its siitras are called \"mother\" since prajiiapiramiti is consid­ered as the mother of all four kinds of noble ones (buddhas, bodhisattvas, pratyekabuddhas, and sravaka arhats). The Tibetan tradition refers to the prajiiaparamiti siitras in one hundred thousand, twenty-five thousand, and eight thousand lines, respectively, as \"the large, medium, and brief mothers.\""},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"53 Verse 2. Notes 691 54 LSSP (fol. 4a.4-6) adds that, in the above verse, \"foundation\" refers to the Buddha; \"governance,\" to his retinue of bodhisattvas and srivakas; \"activity,\" to how to engage in prajiiiiparamita; \"signs,\" to mira's activities and the irreversibility of bodhisattvas; \"downfall,\" to a rebirth in the lower realms, when rejecting prajiiiipiramitii; and \"benefit,\" to the merit resulting from inquiring about prajiiiipiramitii and so on being far greater than offering a trich­iliocosm filled with the seven precious items of a cakravartin. This explanation corresponds to the comments at the end of Asailga's Prajnaparamitakdrikasaptati on the Vajracchedikdprajna­paramitasutra (see Tucci 1971, pp. 435-36). As Conze 1960 (pp. 97-100) points out, the bulk of the fifty-eight verses of the Prajnaparamitarthasal?'lgraha is based on the large prajiiiiparamitii sdtras, with no parallels in the one in eight thousand lines. The four largest sdtras list twenty emptinesses, while the sixteen given by Dignaga (verses 8-18) never occur in the sdtra in eight thousand lines, but correspond exactly to the contents of the sixteen in Madhyantavibhaga 1.17-20. Almost the entire remainder of Digniiga's text (verses 19-54) discusses the ten con­ceptual distractions (in terms of nonentities or entities, superimposition or denial, being one or different, a phenomenon's nature or its features, and taking a referent to be just as its name or vice versa) and their remedies. Note that these ten distractions are not found in any known prajiiiiparamita text either, but in Mahayanasutralal?'lkdra XI.77 and in Mahayanasal?'lgraha 11.20-22 (P5549, fols. 19b.6-20b.5), with the latter correlating their remedies to passages in the prajiiiiparamita sdtras. In this context, Oignaga's verses 27ff. also discuss the three natures. 55 Usually attributed to Vasubandhu or Oarpftfisena. MCG (fol. 4a.3-4) speaks about a com­mentary on the sdtra in one hundred thousand lines by a certain Dpa' bo (*Sdra) as representing this third type of commentarial tradition (it is unclear to whom this refers-obviously not the early master Aryasdra-so it may be an alias of Oarp,tfisena). However, MCG (fol. 4a.6-4b.1) also mentions what is known as the \"Satasahasrikaprajnaparamitafikd by Oarpftriisena\" (obvi­ously considering these two texts to be different) and denies the assertion by some scholars that the latter is by Vasubandhu since none of his or Asailga's commentaries on the AA were trans­lated into Tibetan. In addition, MCG (fol. 5a.4) speaks of a Satasahasrikdprajnaparamitatika by King Trisong Oetsen. SN (p. 245) just says that, in old manuscripts, the Satasahasrikdpanca­vi,Satisahasri/ct4tadaSasahasrikdprajnaparamitabrhatpkd (03808) is said to be authored by the Kashmiri Oarpwasena. Among later scholars, some say that it is the Paddhati by Vasubandhu, while others deny this. For the complexities around the identity and the author(s) of 03807 and 03808, see the Introduction in Brunnholzl2010. 56 The three approaches are found in the Alokd (p. 11) and Vasubandhu's Brhatpkd, which also mentions the eleven instructional specifications (though not enumerating them in one place as eleven). Note that the page numbers of Haribhadra's Alokd and the first chapter of Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti refer to the Sanskrit editions by Wogihara and Pensa, respectively. These numbers are also indicated in [ ] in Sparham's (2006 and 2008a) English translations of the sections of these two commentaries that correspond to the first three chapters of the AA and thus can be conveniently located by the English reader. For the remaining chapters of the Aloka and the Vrtti, only the Oerge Tengyur folio numbers are given because the Tengyur is more widely accessible and read than Wogihara's Sanskrit edition and there is no published Sanskrit edition of the last seven chapters of the Vrtti (a working edition of the V.rtti is available in pdf form from G. Sparham and the IsMEO in Rome plans to publish a complete edition). 57 Note that this position on the Paddhati is originally stated in the Bhagavatyamnayanusdrir;Ji (03811; according to the Tengyur, this is a commentary that follows both Digniiga's Prajnaparamitarthasal?'lgraha and the Paddhah). 58 03796, fol. 2b.2-6."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"692 Groundless Paths 59 In the Tibetan tradition, the teachings on the clear realizations are usually called \"the hid­den meaning\" of the prajiiipiramiti siitras (this term, as referring to the subject matter of the AA, does not occur in any Indian commentary). Gung thang dkon mchog bstan pa'i sgron me's (1762-1823) commentary on the Heart Sutra (trans. in Lopez 1988, p. 179) explains that implicit teachings and hidden meanings differ in that the former \"can be found in any text and be under­stood through the power of reasoning that analyzes the meaning of the explicit teaching. A hidden meaning is something that cannot be understood with independent analysis without being indicated through the instructions of a guru.\" MPZL (p. 6) comments as follows: \"The intention of the prajiiipiramiti siitras is definite as the following two. The explicit teaching (the progressive stages of emptiness) explicitly teaches, through the one hundred [and eight) repetitive phrases, that the basic nature of all phenomena of ground, path, and fruition being identityless and empty consists of the nature of the three doors to liberation. The hidden mean­ing (the progressive stages of clear realization) consists of the subjects that realize this-the clear realizations of realizing all phenomena of entities, paths, and aspects as being identityless, that is, the nature of the three knowledges-as representing the hidden meaning of said one hundred [and eight) repetitive phrases.\" 60 SN (p. 247) defines these two \"system founders\" here as \"those who were directly proph­esied by the Buddha himself as system founders, who are taken care of by their personal deities (such as the foremost bodhisattvas Maitreya or Maiiju5ri), and who comment on the intention of the Victor in an independent manner without relying on any other commentaries of human authorship.\" PVSD (fols. 2b.3-3a.1) states that the large, medium, and brief prajiiipiramiti siitras in one hundred thousand, twenty-five thousand, and eight thousand lines and others contain the topics that are profound and vast. Among these two topics, the explicit teaching (the points of emptiness) are determined by the great system founder Nigirjuna in his collection of Madhyamaka reasoning, which represents the tradition of the profound view. The hidden meaning (the progressive stages of clear realization) is elucidated by Maitreya through his AA, which represents the tradition of vast activity and contains the pith instructions on mother prajiiipiramiti-the heritage of all buddhas of the three times and the single path that all bod­hisattvas travel. 61 Khenpo Shenga's prologue to his SCG (Gzhan phan chos kyi snang ba 1987, pp. 71.6-74.6) says that the five works of Maitreya were taught as commentaries on the intentions of the entire mahayana. Among them, the AA explains the intention of the siitras that teach profound emp­tiness; the Mahayanasutrdlalfllcdra, the Madhyantavibhaga, and the Dhannadhannatavibhaga, the intention of the siitras that teach vast activity; and the Uttaratantra, the intention of the siitras that teach the inconceivable nature of phenomena. These texts were given for the sake of guiding three types of persons-the three middle treatises were composed for those to be guided through the philosophical system of Mere Mentalism; the AA, for those to be guided through the teachings of the \"Svitantrika system; and the Uttaratantra, for those to be guided through the teachings of the \"Prisangika system. Also, these five texts are taught as the remedies for six kinds of wrong ideas. As the remedies for (1) the clinging to entities and (2) the clinging to the lack of entities, respectively, the AA teaches the lack of any nature and all the stages of the paths. The Mahayanasutrdlalfllcdra, the Madhyantavibhaga, and the Dhannadhannatavibhaga were taught for those who are temporarily unable to understand the meaning of the freedom from extremes. Thus, these texts teach the intentions, the indirect intentions, the three natures, and so on as the remedies for (3) taking said meaning literally. They also teach the infinite varieties of the aspect of skillful means as the remedy for (4) lacking interest in the vast aspect of the teachings and the narrow-minded wish to merely meditate on identitylessness. The Uttaratantra teaches that all sentient beings possess the buddha heart as the remedy for (5) the five faults, such as faintheartedness. As the remedy for (6) the idea that if all beings have buddha nature, there can be neither any decrease of flaws nor any increase in qualities, the text differentiates this in"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"Notes 693 terms of various presentations, examples, utterly pure buddhahood, and so on. In particular, the AA is based on, and draws on, all prajfiaparamiti siitras (such as the large, medium, and brief ones). From among the three turnings of the wheel of dharma, it comments on the intention of the siitras of definitive meaning from the middle turning on the lack of characteristics and belongs to the category of pith instructions on profound emptiness. It was composed fo r the purpose of guiding those who are ignorant about how the stages of clear realization-the hid­den meaning of the prajfiaparamiti siitras-are to be made a living experience. 62 Here PSD differs somewhat from LSSP (fols. 6b.S-7a.S), which summarizes its presen­tation of the siitras correlated to the AA by saying that it is clear that the root siitras are only the first four above, or five if one includes the one in eighteen thousand lines as commented on by the A�tasamanartha5asana ascribed to Smrtijnanakirti, whose authorship is, however, doubted by LSSP. MCG (fol. 4b.l-6) also lists twenty-one commentaries and follows the above correlations of the individual texts with different siitras and the AA (the first twenty commen­taries are the same as usual, while the twenty-first one is called sdud pa'i gdams ngag, which seems to refer to the Munimatalarrzkara). As for the prajftaparamiti siitras being enumerated by many early Tibetan masters as \"the six mothers\" (the siitras in one hundred thousand, twenty-five thousand, eighteen thousand, ten thousand, and eight thousand lines as well as the Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha) and \"the eleven children,\" LSSP (fol. 6b.3-5) rejects it on the grounds of the Kangyur containing more prajftaparamita siitras than those seventeen and the Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha being nothing other than one of the chapters of the siitra in eigh­teen thousand lines. SN (pp. 253-57) provides a \"quote\" from the Kau5ikaprajnaparamitasiltra (\"On the occasion of completing the seventeen mothers and children of prajftaparamiti, the Bhagavan dwelled on Vulture Flock Mountain\") and says that, thus, the rejection of said enu­meration comes down to contradicting the Buddha himself (however, this passage is not found in any prajfiaparamiti siitra in the Kangyur). SN continues that there is no flaw in applying the conventional expression \"seventeen mothers and children\" to group together seventeen prajfiaparamiti siitras that were taught together by the Buddha since this does not imply that he taught no other prajnaparamiti siitras. SN does not consider the reasons for LSSP's above rejec­tion of this enumeration as conclusive, saying that the first reason applies equally to the generally accepted enumeration of the large, medium, and brief prajftaparamiti siitras. Moreover, just as these three siitras are considered as the main ones among the main prajfiaparamiti siitras that are explained in the AA, said seventeen are also taken as the main siitras explained in the AA, but not as the only ones that exist or are explained in this text. As for the second reason, the Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha does not have the same status as the other chapters of the siitra in eighteen thousand lines, which is demonstrated by there being three Indian commentaries that correlate the AA to the Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha, but none that correlate the AA with any of the other chapters of the siitra in eighteen thousand lines. To think that all these chapters are equal in their topic simply because they are alike in being chapters of the siitra in eighteen thousand lines is like the reasoning that a fox and a lion are the same because they are equal in being wild animals, or that a thought and a vase are the same because they are both knowable objects. That the siitras explained in the AA are not limited to the large, medium, and brief ones is also stated in the opening verse of Haribhadra's Vivrti saying that the AA is an orna­ment of all prajfiaparamita siitras (and thus of the seventeen mothers and children). This is clearly evidenced by the existence of the Indian commentaries that directly correlate the AA not only to said three siitras, but also to the Prajnaparamitasarrzcayagatha. By way of quoting PSD's above enumeration of the six mothers as the primary siitras explained by the AA, SN also includes the siitras in eighteen thousand and ten thousand lines in this category, while \"the eleven children\" are said to represent the ordinary siitras explained by the AA. For more details on all prajftaparamiti siitras and the twenty-one Indian commentaries, see the Introduction in Brunnhi:ilzl2010."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"694 Groundless Paths 63 This verse is not found in said text (04123). 64 LSSP (fol. 56a.6-56b.1) explains that a treatise restores the mind streams of the dis-ciples-through producing the three trainings in their mind streams, it prevents their body, speech, and mind from engaging in what is inappropriate and causes them to engage in what is appropriate. 65 Prologue, verse 3. 66 Traditionally, in Tibetan Buddhist texts (translated from Sanskrit or indigenous), the opening homage indicates to which one among the three scriptural collections (Skt. pitaka, Tib. sde snod) of the siitrayana-siitra, vinaya. or abhidharma-a work belongs. Paying homage to the buddhas and bodhisattvas (as above) shows that a text belongs to the category of siitra because this category is primarily related to the training in samidhi, with both buddhas and bodhisattvas knowing and engaging in it. Paying homage to the buddha alone indicates the category of the vinaya since it is related to the training in ethics, with only a buddha being able to fully understand all the implications and reasons for this codex of discipline. Paying homage to Manjusri refers to the category of the abhidharma since it is related to the training in prajiii, which is embodied by Maftju8ri. 67 Verse4. 68 Ibid., lines 2bd. 69 The Sanskrit word buddha (meaning \"awake,\" \"expanded,\" \"intelligent,\" \"wise,\" and \"realized\") is explained here through the two syllables of its Tibetan rendering sangs rgyas, with the fo rmer meaning \"awakened,\" \"eliminated,\" or \"purified,\" and the latter meaning \"unfolded\" or \"expanded.\" 70 04061, fol. 30b.3. 71 Ibid., fol. 30b.5-6. These verses are a summary of the preceding passage in the Vyakhyayukti (fol. 30b.4-5), which says that (1) the purpose of a siitra will be realized through (2) giving a summary of its topics; said summary, through explaining (3) the meaning of the words of the siitra; the order of the meaning of these words not being contradictory, through ( 4) showing their coherence; and the reasonings and earlier and later passages not being contra­dictory, through (5) the rebuttal of objections. 72 This heading neither appears again nor has any corresponding contents. 73 Skt. sraddhinusarin, Tib. dad pa'i rjes 'brang pa. 74 Skt. dharminusirin, Tib. chos kyi rjes 'brang pa. The former term is often translated as \"followers of faith\" or the like, which suggests that it is possible to practice and realize the path of seeing out of mere (blind) faith. However, the scriptures make it very clear that a solid under­standing of the Buddhist teachings, especially of the four realities and how to meditate on them, is indispensable for both these types of practitioners in order to attain the advanced fruition of a stream-enterer (the path of seeing). Thus, both the Abhidharmakosa andAbhidharmasamuccaya explain that both types practice for the sake of clearly realizing reality as it is through recollect­ing the dharma, with the difference merely lying in having trust in the teachings as given by another person versus studying them by primarily relying on one's own prajiii. 75 Abhidharmakosa VI.5cd. 76 These are the five skandhas of ethics (correct speech, aims of action, and livelihood at the level of the path of nonlearning), samidhi (correct samidhi and mindfulness), prajiii (correct view, thought, and vigor),liberation (the mind that is utterly and completely liberated), and the vision of the wisdom of liberation (the prajiii that is utterly and completely liberated)."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"Notes 695 77 PGSO (pp. 42-43) says that there are three types of sravakas. Those on any one of the five paths of the sravakas are the sravakas in whose mind streams the respective realizations of these paths have arisen. Those who are buddhas and bodhisattvas who have assumed the appear­ance of srivakas are persons such as Sariputra. The sravakas who assert the view are emanated mahayana persons, such as G�aprabha, who accept the conventional Buddhist philosophical system in accordance with the sravakas. Among these three, the first are the actual sravakas, while the latter two are nominal since their mind streams entail the mindset of the mahayana. 78 03864, fol. 10b.3-4. 79 \"Analytical cessation\" refers to the result of freedom from the factors to be relinquished through having thoroughly analyzed all the aspects of the four realities of the noble ones. \"Nonanalytical cessation\" refers to something not happening due to its specific causes and con­ditions not being complete. 80 PGSO (p. 44) adds that the condition for taking on such mental bodies consists of the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, while its cause consists of uncontaminated karma. 81 Verse 31. Note that though the Tibetan Tengyur indeed incorporates this text in its Madhyamaka section, it (as well as its commentary by Jiianacandra) exhibits a number of very typical Yogacara features, such as relating the three kayas to the imaginary, other-dependent, and perfect natures. Thus, it is all the more interesting that LSSP and PSO take this text as rep­resenting the Madhyamaka position. 82 This is a synonym for n�a. 83 11.132cd. The context of these two lines is that bodhisattvas familiarize with the realiza-tion of the four realities as the means to pacify the suffering of others because they wish to teach these means to others out of loving-kindness. \"The outcome of the means and its cause\" refers to the two realities of cessation and the path, respectively. Without bodhisattvas having realized these two for themselves, it is difficult to explain them to others to be guided. 84 This term refers to the first five human disciples of the Buddha. 85 A class of normally good-natured and helpful, but somewhat fickle-minded spirits in ancient Indian mythology. Sometimes, they serve as protectors of the dharma. Exceptions to their being good-natured are, for example, causing epidemics or being possessed, and some even eat human flesh. 86 PSO says dmigs rnams, but LSSP has dmigs rnam, which is a standard pair in all AA commentaries. At the beginning of the chapter on the complete training in all aspects, both the Aloka (03791, fol. 176a.3-4) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 104b.3-4) define \"aspects\" in the gen­eral context of the AA as the specific instances of the wisdoms that focus on the nature of the remedies (such as impermanence) for the antagonistic factors (such as clinging to permanence). Thus, throughout, in the pair of \"aspect\" and \"focal object,\" the fo rmer refers to the various and progressive cognitive facets (the subjects) of perceiving and focusing on the respective focal objects that consitute the various levels of the lack of both apprehender and apprehended (or, in general, the emptiness of all phenomena) in the minds of bodhisattvas on the paths of prepara­tion, seeing, and familiarization. 87 PSO only has \"samadhi,\" but LSSP has both. Note, however, that in Bhandanta Gho�aka's own presentation, mindfulness belongs to the spokes. 88 The latter means that the Buddha taught the dharma to his students, who in tum teach others. 89 PSO and some other texts by Patrul Rinpoche in the present volume contain a number of interlinear notes (Tib. mchan), henceforth abbreviated as IN. Here the note says,\" A [certain]"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"696 Groundless Paths text says that the [reports on Buddha's] fo rmer lives represent the pitaka of the mahayana vinaya. Al!. for this boundary line here, the manner of summarizing the twelve branches of the words [of the Buddha] and the ten dharmas into the two of scriptures and realization represents [the approach of) the Panjika.\" The latter probably refers to Haribhadra's SaTflcayagathapanjika. 90 PGSD (pp. 47 -53) defines a dharma wheel as \"the genuine dharma spoken by the Teacher that consists of either the dharma wheel of scripture or the dharma wheel of realization.\" The dharma wheel of realization is \"the dharma wheel that represents the qualities which consist of either relinquishment or realization.\" The dharma wheel of scripture is \"the excellent explana­tions that teach the dharma wheel of realization as their subject matter.\" This is threefold. The dharma wheel of the four realities is \"a subdivision of the three dharma wheels of scripture whose own type lacks any of the two latter dharma wheels and which is the field of knowledge that was discussed primarily for the sake of generating the prajfia of realizing the fo ur realities in those to be guided who have the disposition of the hinayana.\" The dharma wheel of the lack of characteristics is \"a subdivision of the three dharma wheels of scripture whose own type lacks any of the first and the last dharma wheels and which is the field of knowledge that was discussed primarily for the sake of establishing those who have the disposition of the mahayana in the ultimate special realization of the mahayana.\" The dharma wheel of excellent distinc­tion is \"a subdivision of the three dharma wheels of scripture whose own type lacks any of the first two dharma wheels and which is the field of knowledge that was discussed primarily for the sake of establishing those to be guided who have an uncertain disposition or the disposi­tion of the mahayana in the ultimate realization.\" In due order, the purposes of these three dharma wheels are that those to be guided turn away from supsira and enter nirval}.a, to put an end to the clinging to saJpsara and nirval;la as being different (what is to be rejected and to be adopted, respectively) and thus realize the freedom from extremes. and to establish those whose mahayana disposition is already certain in the ultimate realization. The first dharma wheel is mainly of expedient meaning; the second, mainly of definitive meaning because it consists of the prajfiaparamita siitras; and the third is not definite because it contains various siitras of the com­mon yina and the uncommon yina. SCG (fol. lOa.S-lOb.l) says that the assertion of the second dharma wheel bearing an intention and the third one not bearing an intention is wrong. For it is mixed up about the expedient and the definitive meaning in believing that what can actually be invalidated through reasoning could be presented as the definitive meaning. while asserting that what is well established through both scripture and reasoning could be presented as the expedi­ent meaning. In fact, all dharma wheels without exception in all their aspects were turned in just a single moment-it is just that different beings to be guided heard this single moment as being longer or shorter in time and as different discourses. Compare, however, Longchen Rabjampa's standard presentation of the three turnings of the wheel of dharma, which follows the one in the Sa1!1dhinirmocanasii.tra. For example, his Response to Questions about Mind and Wr sdom (Klong chen rab 'byams pa dri med 'od zer 1973, pp. 377-78) says, \"In the first proclamation (the specifications of the dharmas of the fo ur realities), primarily having in mind the engage­ment of beginners and those of slightly inferior intelligence, [the Buddha] clearly discussed the methods of practicing in terms of the progression of factors to be relinquished and remedies. In the middle proclamation (the specifications of the dharma of the lack of characteristics), primarily having in mind the progression of the engagement of those who had a little training and those of medium faculties, through the specifications of the lack of nature, he declared that [all] fo rms of clinging to an identity with regard to the remedies are without arising. In the last proclamation (the specifications of the dharmas of definitive meaning), primarily through the progression of the engagement of those in the completely perfect yana and those of sharp fa cul­ties, he extensively discussed the specifications of how [things] are in the basic nature. Thus, the first one teaches the path of turning away from what is to be relinquished-the characteristics of saJpsara.

The last one teaches the way [things] are as being the [buddha] heart. Thus, they were proclaimed in dependence on the gradations of faculties and the order of engagement.\" 91 A Sloka consists of thirty-two syllables. 92 Verse6. 93 This refers to the knowledge of entities, the knowledge of the path, and the knowledge of all aspects, respectively. 94 MCG (fol. 5b.4) says that all eight topics of the AA are contained in the three knowl­edges-the clear realizations of said four persons, in the three knowledges; the four trainings, in the knowledge of the path; and the dharmakiya, in the knowledge of all aspects. According to SZB (pp. 301-2), the object of paying homage in the AA is the ultimate fruitional prajfiiparamiti, which is due to being the fully qualified prajii.aparamita. Thus, in Nagarjuna's texts on the explicit teaching of the prajii.aparamita sdtras (the fully qualified Madhyamaka), the greatness of the ground (Madhyamaka) is expressed by taking its teacher-the Buddha-as the object of homage, while Maitreya's AA on the hidden meaning of the prajii.aparamita sdtras takes the threefold fruition of prajii.aparamita as its object of homage. As for the question whether ground, path, and fruition are one or different, it may be said, \"Are the path and the fruition included in the ground or not? If they are, it is difficult to give a presentation of path and frui­tion in terms of the division into the triad of ground, path, and fruition. If path and fruition are not included in the ground, it follows that some knowable objects are not included in the two realities (the ground).\" In general, when all phenomena from form up through the knowledge of all aspects are presented as the seeming (all that appears) and the ultimate (the emptiness of that), there are no knowable objects that are not included in the two realities. From that perspec­tive, path and fruition are also included in them. However, through terminological divisions, in the prajii.aparamita sdtras and elsewhere, the skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are presented as the ground; the four realities and so on, as the path; and the powers and so on, as the fruition. When analyzing what is included in what, one needs to be skilled in the divisions of the latter categories here (path and fruition) being particulars of the fo rmer one (the ground) and so on. 95 Traditionally, every Indo-Tibetan Buddhist treatise has to fulfill four criteria-proper subject matter, purpose, essential purpose, and connection (usually abbreviated by just the phrase \"purpose and connection\"). (1) Proper subject matters from a Buddhist point of view are found in the three kinds of proper treatises (meaningful in a Buddhist sense; leading to the relinquishment of suffering; and mainly focusing on practice). The six types of specious treatises are meaningless ones (on topics such as whether crows have teeth); those with wrong meanings (from a Buddhist perspective, such as discussing an eternal soul); treatises on cheating others; heartless ones (such as on warfare or killing animals); and those that mainly focus on study or debate (as described in Asailga's ViniScayasa,.graha�;�i; 04038, fol. 205a.3-7). (2) The proper purpose of a text means that it must serve as a convenient avenue for penetrating the intended meaning of the teachings. (3) The essential purpose is to engage in this meaning with enthu­siasm and eventually attain the omniscience of a buddha. (4) The proper connection refers to the one between the purpose and the essential purpose. Also, in terms of the subject matter, the earlier parts of the contents of the text must be properly connected with the following. 96 See the translation of PBG. 97 1.25. 98 This refers to Dignaga, Dharmakirti, and their followers. 99 Pandeya ed., p. 4.7-10; 04032, fol. 190a.4-5."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"698 Groundless Paths 100 This explanation is based on the word Sis in the Sanskrit term sastra, which can mean \"teaching,\" \"correcting,\" \"controlling,\" and \"restoring\" (Tib. bcos). 101 PGSD (pp. 32-33) defines a treatise in general as \"the scriptural dharma that, motivated primarily by the intention of composing a treatise, is put together for the sake of teaching others the philosophical system that oneself asserts.\" The definition of a fully qualified (that is, Buddhist) treatise is \"A treatise that possesses the four special features.\" According to Uttaratantra V.19, these four features are the motivation (undistractedly writing solely in the light of the Buddha's teachings), using and explaining the words and the meanings of these teachings, and the purpose or function (these explanations leading to liberation). 102 Like most Tibetan commentaries, MCG (fol. 7b.1 and 7b.4-6) also takes the ten dharma practices here to refer to the ten piramitas, but mentions that, in general, they can also be classi­fied as the ten such as writing the letters of the dharma (as in Madhyantavibhaga V.8cd-10ab), the ten dharmas that define the knowledge of all aspects, and the ten that consist of the seven­branch prayer (prostrating to the buddhas and so on) plus the three mental states of taking refuge and giving rise to the twofold bodhicitta of aspiration and application. MPZL (pp. 10-11) says that the profound subject matter of the AA (the path of the knowledge of all aspects and its fruition) and the excellent words that express it represent the profound hidden meaning that is difficult to realize and explained by the teacher in this stitra collection of definitive mean­ing here. It is not something to be experienced by others-those who do not possess the pith instructions. For this reason, the intention of the slitras that have the character of the great­ness of the ten dharma practices (the scriptural prajftipiramiti as the means of expression) as well as the meaning of the path and the fruition that have the character of the eight topics and seventy points (the actual prajnaparamiti as what is to be expressed) will be seen and realized by the intelligent with analysis (the persons with the three different aims as outlined in the hom­age) after having committed them to memory, which is associated with alertness. Therefore, Maitreya says that he shall compose this treatise on the intended meaning of said slitras, the purpose of which is to realize the profound hidden meanings of the slitras in an easy manner with little difficulties. SZB (p. 301) says that Aryavimuktisena, in accord with what verses 1.1-2 teach explicitly, explains them as just indicating the purpose of the treatise, while Haribhadra matches them with the fourfold set of purpose and connection. The meaning to be expressed by the slitras (the means of expression), which have the nature of having to be practiced through the ten dharma practices such as writing letters, refers to the ten points of the knowledge of all aspects (such as the generation of bodhicitta), which are divided into the eight topics. 103 PGSD (p. 58) says that (I) the subject matter of the AA is represented by lines I. lab; (2) the purpose, by lines 1.2cd; and (3) the essential purpose, by lines I.Icd-2ab. (4) The connection between (1)-(3) is to be understood by implication. This accords with the Alolca (p. 4), the Vivrti (03793, fol. 8Ia.I-6), and all other commentaries (including PBG) that follow Haribhadra. 104 This example is first used in Oharmamitra's Prasphutapada (03796, fol. 28b.4-6). 105 04295, fol. 278b.7. 106 This explains the differences between the eight clear realizations, the eight topics, and the eight chapters of the AA. 107 03804, fol. 230b.4. PVSO (fol. 6a.I-2) elaborates that the clear realizations are stated in terms of the manners in which realizations arise in the mind stream of a person; the eight topics, in terms of their meanings to be expressed; and the eight chapters, in terms of the words that express those meanings."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"Notes 699 108 In its more general sense, \"the bh\\imi or level of engagement through aspiration\" refers to both the paths of accumulation and preparation. In its more narrow sense, it stands for the path of preparation alone. 109 03808, fo ls. 40b.6-41a.6 (Tib. yum gsum gnod 'joms). The text says that the fo ur wisdoms of subsequent attainment consist of mirrorlike wisdom, the wisdom of equality, discriminating wisdom, and all-accomplishing wisdom. The wisdoms of sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats represent natural outflows of prajiiaparamita. The realizations of bodhisattvas refer to the grad­ually increasing wisdoms that are the specific fe atures of engaging in suchness as the actuality of the omnipresence of the dharmadhatu and so on, which are embraced by the means to make the dharmadhatu stainless and increase through the progression of studying, reflecting, and meditating. 110 Verse 1. 111 03801, fol. 77b.4-6. The text does not use the terms \"fully qualified,\" \"nominal,\" and \"meditative equipoises of the ten bh\\imis.\" It says that prajiiaparamita is prajiia by virtue of knowing the ultimate entity because it fo cuses on emptiness. It is paramita in that it goes beyond the conceptions of noble bodhisattvas. The path of preparation and the dharmakaya with its enlightened activity are called \"prajiiaparamita\" due to being its cause and result, respectively. 112 03798, fol. 117a.6-7. 113 03818, fol. 270a.7-270b.l. 114 P. 23. 115 03810, fol. 295a.S-295b.7. 116 In the Mi rigs dpe skrun khang edition of PSO, pp. 31.12-33.6 consist of a passage that is mistakenly cut and pasted from p. 34 in the next section below (\"The manner in which these divisions are specified through names\"). In the Si khron mi rigs dpe skrun khang edition, said passage is in the correct place. In order to facilitate identifying the Tibetan in the fo rmer edition, I retained the its original page numbering of this passage in [ ]. 117 PVSO (fol. Sb.3-4) says that the nonconceptual wisdom which consists of the medita­tive equipoises of buddhas and bodhisattvas is the principal prajiiaparamita and the element of subsequent attainment, the ordinary one. Both constitute the fully qualified prajiiaparamita. The paths of engagement through aspiration and the scriptural prajiiaparamita represent the nominal one. 118 Like many other commentaries (but unlike LSSP/PSO), LNG (fols. 2b.6-3b.2) divides prajfiaparamita into fo ur: \"The definition of natural prajniipiiramitii is 'the elements that are the objects of the knowledge that directly realizes all phenomena as being free from reference points.' This is equivalent to ground prajfiaparamita. Its boundary lines are that it exists on all three paths of the noble ones of the mahayana. The definition of scriptural prajniipiiramitii is 'the words of the Buddha and the treatises that are the cognizances which appear as the assem­blies of the names, words, and letters that teach by taking the prajiiaparamitas of ground, path, and/or fruition as their main subject matter.' Its instances are the seventeen mothers and chil­dren of prajfiaparamita, the Abhisamayiilarrtkiira, and so on. Its boundary lines range from before the path is entered up through the buddhabh\\imi. The definition of the prajniipiiramitii of the path is 'the knowledge that directly realizes that all phenomena are free from reference points and causes one to proceed to the nonabiding nirvil}.a.' Its instances are the five paths of the mahayana, primarily [the paths of] seeing, meditation, and completion. As for its boundary lines, the fully qualified [prajfiaparamita of the path exists] during the meditative equipoises of the noble ones of the mahayana, while its approximately concordant [forms] exist in the mind streams of [those on] the two [paths] of accumulation and preparation and so on. The definition"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"700 Groundless Paths of the fruitional prajnaparamita is 'the knowledge that has arrived at the nonabiding �a and is the highest final level of directly realizing that all phenomena are free from reference points.' Its instance is the illusionlike nondual wisdom of the buddhabhiimi. Its boundary lines are that it exists solely in the mind streams of noble buddhas.\" On the difference between actual and nominal prajdaparamita, LNG (fol. 3b.3-6) quotes the above opening verse of Dignaga's Prajnaparamitarthasa,graha and explains, \"Accordingly, the two [prajnaparamitas of] ground and fruition represent the fully qualified prajftaparamita, while the scriptural prajftaparamita is only nominal. In the prajftaparamita of the path, there are elements of both actual and nominal [prajftaparamitas].\" PGSD (p. 61) says that only the fruitional praji!.aparamita is the fully quali­fied one, while the scriptural one and the one of the path are nominal. The reasons for labeling them as \"praji!.aparamita\" are that the former represents the means to express prajftaparamita and the latter, the cause for the attainment of prajnaparamita. The purpose of labeling them thus is that the persons who strive for praji!.aparamita know that they must study, and reflect on, the scriptural prajdaparamita and practice the prajftaparamita of the path. Both are not the actual praji!.aparamita because they are not the attainment of the prajiia of ultimate relinquish­ment and realization. 119 LNG (fol. 4b.1-2) elaborates: \"An instance of the first one is something like the reality of cessation in the mind stream of noble buddhas. The second one exists as two-the knowledge of all aspects that knows all aspects of knowable objects without exception and the knowledge of all aspects that knows the seventy points [that represent its] primary causes and [their] results. • According to SZB (pp. 302-3), the knowledge of all aspects is \"the clear realization of realiz­ing the aspects of the fruition as being without arising.\" However, one should not confuse this with the knowledge of all aspects taught in the eighth chapter (the wisdom dharmakiya). For as expressed in verse IX.2, the knowledge of all aspects taught in the first chapter is the cause and the one in the eighth chapter, the result When Haribhadra speaks of the four trainings as causes, he includes all the points in the eight chapters in the two catergories of cause and result, with the trainings belonging to the former. However, this is in no way a teaching that the three knowledges are not causes because that would not accord with the AA. 120 PGSD (p. 55) elaborates that maturation means to fulfill the main aspiration prayer-the actuality of wishing to attain perfect buddhahood for the welfare of others. As for the gauge of having matured sentient beings, matured beings are those who, by way of the obscurations being suitable to actually be relinquished and the remedies being suitable to actually arise, have attained the path of preparation of the yana of their respective own traditions. When these beings attain the paths of seeing and familiarization, it means that matured beings become liberated. When these beings attain the path of nonlearning, they abide on the path of final liberation. Therefore, they attain the final ability to make the obscurations be suitable to actu­ally be relinquished and the remedies be suitable to actually arise in those who are to be guided by the actual kiyas attained by said beings. As for purification, through the power of having accumulated the causes for excellent buddha realms being accomplished (the roots of virtue) in a perfect manner, within a buddha's own appearances the realms that consist of container and contents appear solely as all-encompassing purity. 121 1.158ab. Tib yang dag mtha' renders Sk.t. bhittako�u (which means \"in the myriads of beings•) by ignoring the plural. The sentence in Sanskrit thus means \"It has been stated that the conditioned phenomena in the myriads of beings are void in all resepccts. • 122 \"Cognitive aspects\" are the wisdom moments of the clear realizations that represent the cognitive subjects which focus on, and realize the nature of, their respective objects, called \"ref­erent aspects• (such as impermanence or emptiness). For more details on cognitive and referent aspects, see below (2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Explaining the aspects to be trained in) and Appendix III (section 2a)."},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"Notes 701 123 PVSD (fols. 7b.6-8a.6) explains the definite order of the four trainings as follows: \"The complete training in all aspects is the practice of what is profound during meditative equipoise, which causes the arising of the nonconceptual wisdoms free from reference points that have not [yet) arisen in one's mind stream. The culminating training is this very [training] arising as the nature of the highest [prajna] arisen from mundane and supramundane meditation. The serial training is the practice of what is vast during subsequent attainment, which causes the attainment of stability in the samadhi that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects. The instantaneous training is the final cause or path once the stability in this [samadhi] has been attained ... They are also definite in number in terms of their fruitions. Through both [the complete training in] all aspects and the culminating [training], the excellent relinquishment is manifested as one's own welfare-the attainment of the effortless and spontaneously present dharmakiya. Through both the serial and the instantaneous [trainings), the excellent realization that is the welfare of others is manifested-the attainment of the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects. [In this process,] the nipakiyas and their activities are attained as a matter of course.\" See also Appendix III. 124 That is, the knowledge of all aspects exists in buddhas; the knowledge of the path, in bodhisattvas; and the knowledge of entities, in jravakas and pratyekabuddhas. 125 According to LNG (fols. 4b.5-6 and 5a.3-4), the knowledge of the path exists on all five paths of the mahayana and it is also said to exist from the mahayana path of seeing up through the buddhabhfuni. As for the knowledge of entities, the actual one exists on all five paths of the hinayina, while all the noble ones of the mahayana possess the nominal knowledge of entities. It is also said to exist in the mind streams of all noble ones. 126 Instead of \"objects of studying and reflecting,\" LNG (fol. 7a2-3) has \"natural utter peace as the object of thoughts.\" 127 LNG (fol. 7a.3-5) says, \"The equipment of the bhfunis and the paths of seeing and famil­iarization that are explained in the knowledge of all aspects and the knowledge of the path are not repetitious because they have different purposes. For the former are explained in order to define the knowledge of all aspects (the subject) and the latter teaches the knowledge of the path, which knows the three paths, by way of defining it through its objects.\" PGSD (p. 64) gives the reason that, in the first chapter, the ten bhfunis, the five paths, and so on are taught in terms of the isolates that are the points which define the knowledge of all aspects. In the second chapter, they are taught in terms of the isolates that are the causes through which the knowledge of all aspects is attained. 128 PGSD (p. 64) gives the reason that, in the second chapter, the clear realizations and so on of the hinayana are taught in terms of the isolates that are objects to be known. In the third chapter, they are taught in terms of the isolates that are the points to go astray. 129 PGSD (p. 67) says that the given order of the ten points of the knowledge of all aspects represents the one in which they are explained. As for the order in which they are practiced, by virtue of the condition of the disposition for the mahayana having been awakened in someone, that person generates the motivation of generating bodhicitta and then engages in the applica­tion of this motivation through listening to the mahayana instructions from a tathagata and then giving rise to the realizations of the factors conducive to penetration in their mind streams. The persons with these realizations don the armor through their motivation, engage in the path through applying this motivation, gather the vast collection of the two accumulations, and are finally delivered into the nirvil)a that is the relinquishment of supsira. Through these four practices, by way of focusing on the eleven focal objects, they manifest the ultimate fruition-the threefold aim-in their mind streams."},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"702 Groundless Paths 130 Almost all other commentaries speak of five branches, the third one being the pervasive­ness of the disposition as the foundation for all beings to potentially give rise to the knowledge of the path. LNG (fol. 11 b.4-6) describes the first three as follows. \"The support for the arising of the knowledge of the path is to be free from manifest pride as what obstructs it. The certainty of its arising is due to having geneated bodhicitta (its cooperative condition). The pervasive­ness of its arising is due to the disposition (its substantial cause) having been awakened.\" The remaining two branches correspond to the last two of the four in PSD above. 131 This is a synonym for the path of accumulation. 132 See PSD, p. 32. 133 Note that the Sanskrit grammatical forms svibhivikakaya, simbhogikakiya, and nairm�ya (as opposed to svabhivakaya, sambhogakiya, and nirmat)akiya) are quite standard. They are not only used in the Abhisamaydlaf11kdra and its commentaries, but also in many sdtras and most Yogicira texts, such as the Mahayanasutriilaf11kdra, the Uttaratantra, the Mahayanasa,graha, their commentaries, and so on. These forms indicate that said kiyas are related to the dharmakiya as its features or aspects and are not three separate entities on their own. Thus, in terms of its nature, the dharmakiya is referred to as svibhivikakaya (this is why these two kiyas are often said to be equivalent). In terms of its bringing the enjoyment of the mahayana dharma to bodhisattvas, it is the simbhogikakiya. In terms of its manifesting in all kinds of forms for all kinds of beings, it is the nairmat)ikakiya. See also Makransky 1997 {esp. pp. 54-60). 134 MPZL (p. 18) says that, according to the explicit teaching of the AA and certain Indian and Tibetan masters such as Aryavimuktisena, the four points that define the dharmakiya are the svibhivikakiya, the simbhogikakiya, the nairm�ya. and enlightened activity. To list these four as the svibhivikakiya, the simbhogikakiya, the dharmakiya, and the nairm�ya is the exegetical approach of most Indian and Tibetan masters, such as Haribhadra, which repre­sents the unsurpassable intention of what the AA teaches implicitly. 135 MCG (fol. Sb.3-4) remarks that the seventy points are summarized in the eight topics and these can again be summarized in the three knowledges-the types of realization of the four kinds of noble ones are contained in a general manner in the three knowledges; the four train­ings, in the knowledge of the path; and the dharmakiya, in the knowledge of all aspects. 136 PGSD (p. 68) explains that all beings except for the gods without discrimination and those in the formless realm can directly give rise to bodhicitta. The former cannot do so because they do not possess a manifest and clear mental consciousness that has a continuum. The lat­ter cannot because the beings in the formless realm do not serve as focal objects for each other. Thus, they cannot directly give rise to the wish for others to be free from suffering upon seeing that they are being tormented by suffering. 137 Tib. dkon mchog sgron me'i mdo. The Kangyur does not contain a sdtra of this name and I also could not locate the following verse in any of the texts of the Tengyur whose titles contain these words. 138 Line IV.3a. MCG (fol. 14a.2-5) says that the support of the generation of bodhicitta is to aspire for the mahayana, which arises even in nigas and gods who desire to attain buddhahood. The statements in the Bodhisattvabhumi and the Bodhipathapradipa about the pritimol.qa vows being necessary as the support for the generation of the bodhicitta of application refer to these vows only being required in beings with particular psychophysical supports since there are also gods in the desire realm and bodhisattvas in the higher realms (both lacking pratimol.qa vows) who give rise to bodhicitta. The causes for generating bodhicitta are to see the physical form of"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"Notes 703 a buddha, to see and hear about the powers of buddhas and bodhisattvas, to hear the mahayana dharma, not to tolerate the suffering of beings when one sees it, and so on. 139 The Bodhisattvabhumi (04038, fol. 7a.6-7) says literally, \"A bodhisattva's first genera­tion of bodhicitta is the first perfect aspiration prayer among all perfect aspiration prayers of bodhisattvas. It includes [all] perfect aspiration prayers other than this\" (note that the above abbreviated paraphrase is also adduced in several other commentaries). In its following lines, the Bodhisattvabhumi (1.2, §§1.1.2. and 1.1.3.) explains bodhicitta as having the same two focal objects-enlightenment and the welfare of others-as Vasubandhu and others do below. 140 \"The intention that possesses three qualities and two focal objects is called 'bodhicitta'\" (Limaye ed., p. 42). Vasubandhu's text explains the three qualities as (1) the great enthusiasm for attaining the profound and performing difficult tasks for a long time by virtue of armorlike vigor, as well as great endeavor by virtue of the ensuing vigor of application; (2) the great pur­pose of being concerned about the welfare of both oneself and others; and (3) the great outcome of attaining great enlightenment. Thus, in due order, the three qualities are the qualities pro­duced by a person, the quality of working for the benefit of others, and the quality of maturing the fruition. The two focal objects are (1) great enlightenment and (2) promoting the welfare of others. For MahayanasutralaJ?1kiira IV.1, see below. 141 XVIII.74ab. 142 P. 31. 143 IV.1 (PSO only quotes lines bd). 144 PGSO (pp. 69-70) says that, according to Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra, the primary mind that is bodhicitta is the pure mental consciousness that is embraced by the prajfta of real­izing emptiness and focuses on perfect enlightenment for the welfare of others. According to Rongton, in terms of what is to be done, the generation of bodhicitta is a primary mind, but in terms of the agent, it is a mental factor. MCG (fols. 13b.4-14a.2) explains that, though \"desire\" in the definition of generating bodhicitta refers to the mental factor striving among the five object-ascertaining mental factors, it is the generation of bodhicitta (the result) that is labeled with the name of this striving (its cause). The reason for such labeling is that virtuous dharmas are the nature of the striving for enlightenment-if there is the striving for enlightenment, the generation of bodhicitta will arise as its result. Or though the generation of bodhicitta arises as a primary mind, it possesses the mental aid of striving and thus is labeled with the name of this mental aid. The purpose of this is to show that bodhicitta is generated based on such striving. The invalidation of the explicit statement is that the mental factor \"striving\" is the cause for generating bodhicitta and not its nature. If it were the latter, said cause and its result would be the same, just as when claiming that firewood and fire are the same. 145 03800, fol. 8b.6-7. 146 03801, fol. 79a.7. 147 SZB (p. 305) says that, according to Aryavimuktisena, among the two parts of the defini­tion of generating bodhicitta (\"enlightenment\" and \"the welfare of others\"), ordinary beings focus primarily on the former and noble ones, primarily on the latter. The generation of bod­hicitta, in which these two aspects are complete, is divided into twenty-two in terms of its particular instances. 148 This is an abbreviated paraphrase of what Oharmamitra's Prasphutapada (03796, fol. 39a.1-2) reports as Buddha5rijiiana's position: \"All sentient beings on the level of ordi­nary beings are said to be those with the bodhicitta of aspiration, while those from the bhiimi Supreme Joy onward are those with the bodhicitta of applying themselves to the dharmadhatu,"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"704 Groundless Paths just as it is, which is a particular fe ature of wisdom.\" However, neither of these passages is fo und in the commentaries on the AA by the two Buddhdrijiianas. 149 03796, fo l. 38b.S-7. 150 03940, fo l. 7a.S-6. 151 I.lS-16. 152 03872, fo ls. 51 bf. 153 03915, fo l. 25a.2-4. 154 IV.7. 155 Uterally,line IV.8d has \"supreme\" (Skt. paramata, Tib. dam pa), which is taken to mean \"ultimate\" (Skt. paramirtha, Tib. don dam) by the Bhaga and all subsequent commentaries. 156 IV.8-9. 157 PGSD (pp. 70-73) explains that the generation of bodhicitta on the level of seeming reality is the one of mahayana learners that fo cuses on perfect enlightenment for the welfare of others and lacks the wisdom of the meditative equipoise of directly realizing the nature of phenomena. It exists on the paths of accumulation and preparation and during the subsequent attainment of mahayana noble ones. It is divided into the bodhicitta of aspiration, which is not associated with the bodhisattva vow, and the bodhicitta of application, which is associated with the aid that is the bodhisattva training. The first cannot go beyond the path of accumulation because, from the path of preparation onward, there is no generation of bodhicitta that is not associated with the bodhisattva vow. The latter does not exist during the meditative equipoise of mahayana noble ones because it is definite as a generation of bodhicitta on the level of seeming reality. Therefore, in this context, the bodhicitta of aspiration is necessarily not associated with the bodhisattva vow, while the bodhicitta of application is necessarily associated with it. The ultimate bodhicitta has the nature of the nonconceptual meditative equipoise of directly real­izing the nature of phenomena, which exists from the first bhiimi onward. PVSD (fol. 10b.3-4) defines ultimate bodhicitta as the state of mind that arises as the nature of the ultimate, is made special through the above three fe atures in Mahayanasutrala,lcara IV.8 (with the last one being glossed as the direct realization of phenomenal identitylessness), and is attained by virtue of having become familiar with the yogas of calm abiding and superior insight. 158 MPZL (p. 22) points out that there are two ways of determining the boundary lines of generating bodhicitta-the way that is based on the twenty-two examples in AA I.l9-20 (see PBG below) and the above way of the Mahdyanasutrala,lcara. Against the Mahayanasutriila'fllcarabha,ya on IV.2 (which is fo llowed by PSD above) and the boundary lines in the commentaries on the AA (which take the last three among the twenty-two types of bodhicitta as referring to the buddhabhiimi), MPZL says that the Mahayanasutrala,kara's intention is to take all twenty-two types of bodhicitta in the AA as existing on the paths of learn­ing and thus referring to the causal forms of generating bodhicitta. 159 This refers to the last one among the twenty-two examples for generating bodhicitta in AAI.l8-19. 160 IV.20ab. 161 03805, fo l. 10b.6-7. 162 I.9. 163 Lines cd correspond to verse 106ab of said text and lines ab are somewhat similar to 106cd, which say, \"Except for bodhicitta, the buddhas have not seen any other means.\""},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"164 This is also echoed in verse 107 of the Bodhicittavivara,a. 165 XIV.17. 166 XIV.3. Notes 705 167 PVSD (fol. l3b.4-6) says that the instructions are twofold-the ordinary instructions that teach merely a part of the mahayana path and the special instructions, which consist of all the words of the Buddha and the treatises on them that comprehensively and unmistakenly teach the mahayana path and its fruition. LNG (fol. 9a.3-6) agrees and adds that \"instructions\" are given in order that previously existent qualities do not deteriorate, while \"directions\" are given in order to attain previously unattained qualities. This follows the Vrtti's (p. 31) distinction of the two Sanskrit terms avavada and anu.Sasana, respectively. MPZL (p. 24) acknowledges the Vrttl\"s distinction, but follows the assertion that \"instructions\" refers to the means that make one attain the qualities of the path that one had not attained before, while \"directions\" are the means that make what one has attained special. 168 This position, adding that practice in accordance with the instructions is the primary meaning of \"instruction,\" is found as a quote in Dharmamitra's Prasphutapada (D3796, fol. 43a.2). 169 D3795, fol. 256b.6. 170 D3796, fol. 42b.2. LSSP (fol. 113b.4) takes this to mean that bodhisattvas in their last life are able to attain enlightenment independently of others and thus do not rely on instructions. 171 PGSD (pp. 82-83) explains the instructions on practice's own nature as \"the genuine dharma of the mahayana scriptures that teaches the manner of making the practice of the mahayana a living experience by way of not going beyond the two realities (the object) and means and prajiia being in union (the subject).\" MCG (fol. 17a.4-5) says that said instructions consist of the instructions on practicing the path by way of the two realities being unified in that, conventionally, everything to train in (such as the generation of bodhicitta) is unceasing as illusionlike appearance and thus exists seemingly, while it is not observable ultimately, due to which there is no fear of emptiness. As for the two realities, their basis of division is the sheer lack of nature or the sheer reverse of what is unreal. Within seeming reality, the correct seeming consists of what appears to the unimpaired six sense faculties and the false seeming, of the dis­torted appearances due to impaired sense faculties (such as falling strands of hair due to blurred vision). The nominal ultimate refers to merely having negated arising and so on ultimately, but not being free from the reference point of the lack of arising. The nonnominal ultimate refers to being free from all reference points of arising and the lack of arising. The definition of seeming reality is \"the phenomena that are not beyond mind and cannot withstand analysis through cor­rect reasoning.\" The definition of ultimate reality is \"the nonreferential nature of phenomena beyond mind in which all reference points are at utter peace.\" All apprehenders and appre­hended phenomena that appear as the duality of subject and object represent seeming reality. Ultimate reality is the nonreferential suchness that is experienced by the wisdom of the noble ones in the manner of dualistic appearances having vanished. Therefore, these two realities that are taught through terms by those who explain and are taken as objects by audiences through listening and reflecting may well be presented as two distinct realities in dependence on the mental states that are their cognizing subjects. However, in terms of the fully qualified ultimate meditative equipoise of the noble ones, both these realities are seeming. Thus, they should be differentiated in this way. If the two realities were different ultimately, the ultimate would not be the true nature of appearances, the superimpositions of clinging to appearances being really existent would not be severed through realizing the ultimate, the true reality of not finding the seeming through reasoning would not be the ultimate, and both afflicted and purified phenom­ena could coexist in the mind stream of a single person. If the two realities were the same on"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"706 Groundless Paths the level of the seeming. ultimate reality would be seen through merely seeing the seeming; just as afflicted phenomena increase through focusing on the seeming, the same would happen for the ultimate; there would be no ultimate to be searched for outside of the seeming; and, just as seeming reality entails all kinds of reference points, the same would be true for the ultimate. Therefore, ultimately, the two realities are not asserted as having any referential characteristics of being the same or different. However, conventionally, in terms of the nominal ultimate, the two realities are the same in nature, but different isolates. In terms of the nonnominal ultimate, they are different merely in the sense of negating being the same. Ultimately since the two reali­ties cannot be differentiated by anything whatsoever, in terms of the way things are they are not different. However, in dependence on the cognizing mind, they are different in the same way as unconditioned space can mentally be divided into east and west. Thus, from the perspective of what is to be determined, the realities are taught as two. From the perspective of what is to be adopted and to be rejected, they are taught as the four realities (which are treated in the second one among the ten kinds of instruction). PVSD (fol. 14a.3-5) presents the instructions on the nature of practice as \"You should train in the entire conduct of bodhisattvas as what is to be practiced, and the way of practicing is in the manner of the two realities not being contradic­tory in terms of, ultimately, being free from clinging to real existence due to being free from the three spheres and, conventionally, observing [everything) as illusionlike.\" MPZL (p. 22) has \"the instructions on practicing the path of the union of means and praji\\i in the manner of not going beyond appearance and emptiness-the aspects of the two realities as what are to be known.\" According to SZB (p. 306), the nature of clear realization by way of realizing the two realities as not being contradictory is the realization of the two realities that has the cognitive aspect of the union of means and praji\\i. 172 CZ, pp. 57-58.

Since they are real for noble persons, they are explained as 'the realities of the noble ones' in the sdtras. 'Does this mean that they are delusive for others?' Not being mistaken, they are real for everyone, but the noble ones see them exactly as they are, [that is, in their sixteen aspects), while others do not. Therefore, these [reali­ties) are called 'the realities of the noble ones.' But they are not those of nonnoble ones because they see in mistaken ways.\" PGSD (p. 90) also presents the above quote and gives a similar explanation.

The instruction on the path of familiarization is to cultivate it in the manner of knowing that, on the mahayana path of familiarization (the remedy for the innate factors to be relinquished, which are relinquished through familiarization), the factors to be relinquished and their remedies do not exist as two.

They are conceptions because they apprehend the nature of phenomena in the manner of an object generality and apprehend the object by way of names and reference points. For both the Abhidharmasamuccaya and its commentaries explain them as conceptions that picture the four realities by way of names and reference points. Therefore, though the path of preparation possesses many qualities (such as the supernatural knowledge of knowing the minds of others), it does not arise as the actual nature of the path. 254 IN: there are [some who) say that the path of preparation consists of the inferential cognitions that rely on reasonings such as the freedom from unity and multiplicity. For Nyaon's synopsis of the different positions of various early Kadampa masters on the nature of the medi­tative equipoises of the path of preparation, see Brunnholzl2010. 255 This reason is literally fo und in Sthiramati's Madhyantavibhagatfka (04032, fo l. 280a.3). 256 IV.12. 257 04027, fo l. 18a.3-4. 258 Pandeya ed., p. 139.27-28 (04032, fo l. 280a.1-6)."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Notes 711 259 Thus, (1) refers to the paths of accumulation and preparation and (2), to the paths of seeing and familiarization.

It is in this way that the realization of the path of preparation weakens the manifest forms of these factors to be relinquished. According to MPZL (pp. 37-39), the AA explicitly teaches that the difference between the conceptions about the apprehended and the conceptions about the apprehender lies in the former conceiving of the apprehended as being the phenomena that consist of entities and the remedies, while the latter take the apprehender as being the phenomena that consist of substantially and imputedly existent persons. Also the commentaries by both Aryavimuktisena and Haribhadra and so on clearly teach that the latter refer to substantially existent sentient beings and imputedly existent individuals. Still, it appears that others give all kinds of explanations that miss the point, such as that the conceptions about the apprehender and apprehended are distinguished in terms of a self and what is mine, consciousness and matter, subject and object, and so on. Therefore, from among the two types of conceptions (special and ordinary [Tib. 'phar malrkyang pa]), these here are asserted as ordinary. It is not tenable for them to be special ones because this contradicts the meaning of the scriptures as well as reasoning. From among conceptions in terms of being affirmed and being negated, they are asserted as the fo rmer because they are states of mind that conceive of phenomena and persons as being existent. They are not conceptions in terms of being negated because they are not states of mind that conceive of phenomena and persons as being nonexistent. There is entailment because the difference between conceptions in terms of being affirmed and being negated is determined by the appearance of the cognitive aspects of affirming and negating, respectively. Therefore, these conceptions are associated with the path of preparation as its fa ctors to be relinquished, but not as its nature. For the nature of the path of preparation consists of the mental state of realizing personal and phenomenal identitylessness (the poised readiness that concords with the dharma), so how could it consist of the conceptions taught here? These four conceptions are what are to be eliminated by the path of preparation, so how could they be cultivated as its nature? Thus, these fo ur conceptions make up the fa ctors to be relinquished through seeing and familiarization-the obscurations-in their entirety. As for the manner in which they are associated with the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiariza­tion, the manifest conceptions about the apprehended that cling to phenomena as being really existent and the manifest clinging to substance, which conceives of persons as being substantial, exist in ordinary beings, but not in the noble ones because the latter have directly realized the lack of real existence. The manifest conceptions that cling to imputations and are not the fo rmer"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"712 Groundless Paths two conceptions exist in the noble ones, but not in ordinary beings because the latter have not directly realized identitylessness. Through the power of the manifest clinging to real existence in the mind streams of ordinary beings, the clinging to imputations cannot be manifest. As for the seeds of all fo ur conceptions, they exist generally in ordinary beings. In the noble ones, the seeds that are in the process of being relinquished on their respective bhiimis as well as the seeds that are to be relinquished on their respectively lower bhfunis do not exist, while they still have the seeds that are to be relinquished on their respectively higher bhiimis. As for the boundary lines of when these conceptions are relinquished, in general, conceptions are definitely three­fo ld-( I) imputational ones, (2) innate ones, and (3) their subtle latencies. Therefore, the first are relinquished through the path of seeing; the second, through the nine levels of the path of familiarization; and the third, through the vajralike samadhi. In particular, as for the concep­tions that cling to substantial existence, their imputational parts are relinquished through the path of seeing. Their innate seminal parts are relinquished through the seventh bhfuni, which completes the relinquishment of the afflictive obscurations. Their latencies, which represent cognitive obscurations, are relinquished through the three pure bhiimis. In this way, one is free from the absurd consequence that the four conceptions of the practice of the equipment of the remedies on the path of familiarization and the culminating training of the path of famil­iarization are incomplete. For those who assert that the conceptions of clinging to substantial existence have been relinquished completely on the first bhfuni, it appears difficult to explain the practice of the equipment of the remedies on the path of familiarization and the culminating training of the path of familiarization because AA I.l4cd-1 5ab says: The four conceptions' Four kinds of remedy On the paths called \"seeing\" And \"familiarization,\" respectively ... SZB (pp. 307-12) says that the difference between apprehender and apprehended is that they are presented in terms of a self and what is mine, respectively, while both are included in the views about a real personality. Therefore, according to the explicit teaching of the AA, the difference between them is that the conceptions about the apprehended represent the clinging to an iden­tity of phenomena (the root of the cognitive obscurations) and the conceptions about the apprehender, the clinging to an identity of persons (the root of the aftlictive obscurations). The purpose of dividing them in this way is to eliminate the assertions of tirthikas who conceive of them as what is experienced and the experiencer and, as illustrated by that, to realize that all conceptions about apprehender and apprehended (or any conceptions of the three spheres) are factors to be relinquished. Therefore, the root of all obscurations to be relinquished consists of the two types of clinging to an identity, while the root of all particulars of the qualities of real­ization (their remedies) consists of the two types of identitylessness. By virtue of that, in the mahayana path of preparation, the power of the causes for giving rise to all the types of realiza­tion of the three yanas in a complete manner is complete, and this path is the invalidating remedy that fully relinquishes all types of relinquishment of the three yanas. Also, in the path of seeing as the direct result of the path of preparation, all the functions of the types of realization and relinquishment of the paths of seeing of the three yanas are complete. Therefore, the Vrffi holds that all essential points of the path are complete in the purity of the three yanas being complete in the path of familiarization (the temporal indirect fruition of the function of poised readiness and so on), the complete bestowing of the six precious fruitions and so on (AA IV.ll), and (3) the realizations and relinquishments of the three yanas being complete and so on on the buddhabhfuni (the ultimate fruition).

Therefore, when not taking these conceptions as special ones (as done in other mistaken presentations that contradict the meaning of the AA), it is contradictory to only take the cognitive obscurations as said distinctive feature of the path of preparation because the conceptions about substance do not go beyond being afflictive obscurations. In general, the con­ceptions taught here are twofold-( 1) manifest and (2) seminal. ( 1) The first are relinquished on the path of preparation. (2) The seminal ones consist of (a) imputational and (b) innate concep­tions, with (a) being relinquished on the path of seeing.

N. for the latter, since they cannot be relinquished through the ordinary paths of learning up to the buddhabhiimi, they are the factors to be relinquished through the uninterrupted path at the end of the continuum. Therefore, according to the mean­ing of what the Lanklivatarasutra, the Madhyamakavatara, and so on teach, conceptions about substance exist up through the seventh bhfimi. However, except for mere seeds, from the first bhfimi onward there is no manifest clinging to real existence. N. for the differences with regard to the manner in which the factors to be relinquished are relinquished, the Gelugpas assert that, up through the seventh bhfimi, solely the afflictive obscurations are relinquished and thereafter, solely the cognitive obscurations. Some Sakyapas hold that, on the first bhiimi, both afflictive and cognitive obscurations are relinquished and thereafter, solely the cognitive obscurations. In our own tradition, Mipham Rinpoche says in his commentaries on prajiiaparamita and the Madhyamaklila'!'lklira (see Padmakara Translation Group 2005, pp. 340-43) that, in general, the intentions of the two charioteers (Nagarjuna and N.ail.ga) with regard to the manner of relin­quishing the factors to be relinquished share the same essential point. He asserts that, on the first bhfimi, the imputational parts of both obscurations are relinquished; up through the seventh bhdmi, the innate parts of both obscurations; and thereafter, solely the cognitive obscurations. Gorampa holds that this is tenable for the Mere Mentalists because they assert the afflicted mind, which must undergo a change of state on the seventh bhiimi. However, the Madhyamikas who only accept Nagarjuna's sixfold collection of reasoning do not assert the change of state of the afflicted mind and thus hold that the afflictive obscurations are already relinquished from the first bhiimi onward. Also, through quoting a passage from the Vrtti, he establishes that, in bod­hisattvas, the realizations and relinquishments of sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats are complete from the first bhfimi onward. However, the meaning of this passage is that the func­tion of poised readiness includes all the functions of the paths of seeing of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, but not all the functions of their paths of seeing and familiarization. Therefore, according to what the Madhyamaklivatara teaches, it is asserted that, in bodhisattvas, the real­izations and relinquishments of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are complete from the seventh bhfimi onward because all afflictive obscurations are completely relinquished at that point. The Gelugpas and Sakyapas each present distinct manners of matching the afflictive obscurations with the nine degrees of the factors to be relinquished through the mahayana path of familiar­ization, but Mipham Rinpoche does not do so. However, he holds that the system of asserting that the afflictive obscurations are relinquished on the seventh bhfimi on the one hand and the most well-known scriptural system as well as the system of Longchenpa and his followers that the three lesser degrees of the afflictive obscurations exist on the three pure bhiimis come down to the same essential point. Therefore, the three lesser degrees of the afflictive obscurations are just the latencies of the afflictive obscurations, but the clinging to an identity of persons is fully relinquished on the seventh bhfimi. Thus, the three lesser degrees of the afflictive obscurations are not fully qualified afflictive obscurations, which obstruct liberation and entail the clinging to an identity of persons as their cause. Rather, they are just nominal afflictive obscurations, that is, the latencies of the afflictive obscurations that are labeled with the name \"afflictions.\" Thus,"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"714 Groundless Paths except for being two different ways of describing this, the essential point is the same. Consequently, one should understand that the fo llowing are not contradictory-the teachings in the siitras and treatises about the afflictive obscurations being fully relinquished on the seventh bhiimi, the explanations that both obscurations are relinquished together at the end of the con­tinuum, the many passages in both siitras and treatises that teach the cognitive obscurations through the name \"afflictions,\" Candrakirti's assertion that the latencies of the afflictions are cognitive obscurations, and the statements in the Madhyamakdvatara, the Uttaratantra, the Lalikavatarasutra, and so on that there are many cognitive obscurations that consist of the con­ceptions about the three spheres, have the nature of phenomenal identity, and are independent of the latencies of the afflictive obscurations. 269 Following the Vivrti, like most other commentaries, MPZL (pp. 29-30) explicitly speaks of the five distinctive features of the path of preparation. (I) The focal objects are what is to be realized-the two types of identitylessness in their entirety (everything contained within the four realities), which are the root of all common and uncommon focal objects. (2) The aspects are the remedies-the entirety of remedial clear realizations in which all aspects of realizing identitylessness are complete, which are the root of all paths to liberation and omniscience. (3) The path of preparation's being a cause refers to its functioning as the cause of the result that is the path of seeing. which includes all types of realization of the three yinas. (4) The mentor represents the conditions of the inner and the outer mentor-the root of all clear realizations that put an end to the extremes of sarpsara and nirviq.a and what protects one in all situations of saJpsira and nirvil}a. (5) The conceptions refer to the entirety of the factors to be relinquished that consist of the two types of clinging to identity, which are the root of all afflictive and cogni­tive obscurations. 270 LSSP has \"function\" or \"activity\" (las) instead of \"actual path.\" 271 04090, fol. 8b.5. 272 VI.57cd. 273 04052, fol. 298a.4-7. This text is sometimes attributed to Vasubandhu and comments on the first chapter of the Mahayanasa111graha. 274 I.48 (P5549, fol. llb.6-7). 275 Wogihara ed., p. 3.1-8; 04037, fol. 2b.3-5. 276 LSSP adds that the conditioned disposition of Mere Mentalism is to be taken as the opposing position to be refuted by Aryavimuktisena in his Vrtti. 277 PVSO (fol. 16b.5-6) describes the Mere Mentalists' second assertion of the disposition as \"the true nature of the mind, natural luminosity, which, in its fundamental state, is established through its own nature at all times and is the unconditioned nature of phenomena without anything to be removed or to be added.\" It should be noted here that LSSP's frequent use of the SravakJJbhumi (which is tellingly omitted by PSO) as representing a Yogicira position on the disposition is rather questionable. Also, Tsongkhapa's presentation of different Y ogicira assertions on the disposition reflects his ambiguous position toward this tradition (see the trans­lation of LSSP's section on the disposition in Brunnholzl 2010, Appendix 11E4). In his early works LSSP and Ocean of Eloquence (see Sparham 1993), he considers the existence of the ilaya­consciousness at least a possibility. In the fourth chapter of LSSP (vol. 2, fol. 33a.5-6), basing himself on the Vini.Scayasa,grahar;�i, Tsongkhapa explicitly speaks of the existence of the ilaya­consciousness during the meditative absorption of cessation (gnas skabs de yang kun gzhi yod pas sems ldan yin). As is evident from the above presentation of the disposition, Tsongkhapa distinguishes between those Y ogaciras who assert the ilaya-consciousness and those who do not assert it. However, the only two quotes that he gives as supports for the latter position are"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"Notes 715 passages from Asatiga's Bodhisattvabhumi and Sravakabhumi, while he also quotes Asatiga as asserting the alaya-consciousness in others of his texts. In addition, the Abhidharmasamuccaya as yet another text by the same author is cited as support for some Mere Mentalists presenting the disposition as the unconditioned nature of phenomena. These obvious inconsistencies are not addressed by either LSSP or PSD. In Tsongkhapa's later works, such as the famous Drang nges legs bshad snying po and his commentaries on the Madhyamakiivatara (Dgongs pa rab gsal) and the Guhyasamajatantra (Gsang 'dus kyi grel pa bzhi sbrags), he strictly denies the existence of the alaya-consciousness. While at least accepting parts of the Y ogacara system in said earlier works, Tsongkhapa sometimes treats Maitreya and Asatiga as Madhyamikas (such as below in his presenting the explanation of the disposition in the Uttaratantra as Madhyamaka). In his later works, he consistently argues for the absolute superiority of Madhyamaka (in particular its *Prasatigika branch) over Yogacara (that is, \"Mere Mentalism\"), while maintaining that, in their ultimate view, both Maitreya and Asatiga are *Prasatigikas. 278 VI.4-Sa. 279 1.24ac. 280 1.49. 281 1.113. PVSD (fols. 16a.6-17a. l) describes the Madhyamaka assertion of the disposition as \"the nature of the mind-the unconditioned dharmadhatu that, in its fundamental state, is not established as anything whatsoever.\" 282 LSSP (fol. 209b.S) adds that it sees the fo rmer (Madhyamaka) as the scope of the explana­tion of the disposition in the AA and the latter (Mere Mentalism), as the scope of its explanation in the Uttaratantra. Note, however, that this contradicts LSSP's above presentation of the expla­nation of the disposition in the Uttaratantra as being Madhyamaka. 283 In LSSP, this paragraph ends the description of the disposition according to Mere Mentalism. 284 Interestingly, LSSP (fol. 210a.S-6) adds here that, though it is well known that the Mere Mentalists assert the possibility of the disposition being cut off fo rever, they just present what certain sutras of expedient meaning explain, but do not accept this as the definitive meaning. Otherwise, they would have to accept that the obscurations cannot be eliminated, but that is not tenable because they assert that all stains are adventitious. LNG (fols. 9b.6-10a.l) divides the dis­position into two in terms of its nature-the naturally abiding and the unfolding dispositions. In terms of the specific phenomena that are fo unded on it (AA 1.39cd), it is thirteenfold. 285 I11.4cd. IN: in terms of the eighth bh\\imi. 286 04037, fol. 2b.2-3. 287 IN: the ninth [bhUmi]. 288 IN: the subsequent attainment of the tenth [bh\\imi]. 289 IN: at the end of the continuum. For PGSD's explanation of the disposition, see Appendix IX. MCG (fols. 35a.3-35b.2 and 37b.l-4) presents the disposition according to the hinayana as PSD above. The Mere Mentalists, MCG says, identify it as the conditioned factor that makes it suitable for mind to change state into being uncontaminated. For the Madhyamikas, it is the pure true nature of the mind. Though there are many positions on this, such as it being the unity of clarity and emptiness, here it is the fact of all phenomena being empty of any nature (or naturally empty). Therefore, it is the disposition of the path of the noble ones arising if one meditates through fo cusing on the mere emptiness in which it is suitable for the three yanas to be accomplished. Though it exists from the path of accumulation onward and even before one has entered the path, in terms of the special disposition that is free from shortcomings, it is said"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"716 Groundless Paths to be the true nature of the mind of the persons from the path of preparation up through the tenth bhiimi, which is divided into thirteen. There �s also the explanation that this is a division in terms of the different capacities of the thirteen practices as the dharmas that are founded on it. In brief, by way of focusing on the dharmadhatu (suchness) from heat up through the attain­ment of effortless wisdom, the clinging to entities is progressively cut through and, finally, one is propelled onto the buddhabhiimi, on which all clinging to knowable objects is terminated at its root. All of this is due to the fo undation that is the dharmadhatu, the naturally abiding dis­position, because suchness exists primordially as the basic nature, and the relinquishment of the obscurations is accomplished through focusing on it. 290 XII.18. The following explanations on the four intentions and the four indirect intentions are based on the Mahayanasii.tralal'flkarabh�ya on XII.16-20ab. 291 PGSD (p. 121) says that there are three equalities of buddhas in terms of the two accumu­lations (the cause), the dharmakiya (the result), and enlightened activity (the welfare of others). 292 XII.16. 293 PGSD (p. 122) says that this refers to something like speaking of the cut-off disposition in order to lead Mere Mentalists to the Madhyamaka view. 294 XII.l9-20ab. 295 This verse is found in the Mahdyiinasii.triilaf!lkarabh�ya on XII.17. 296 XII.l7. 297 LSSP and PSD have gzung ba, but the Tengyur versions of this text read gzud pa. 298 04051, fol. 233a.7-233b.l. 299 PGSD (p. 122) says that siitras with an intention are those siitras of expedient meaning that are mainly taught by having in mind a basis of intention that is different in meaning. Siitras with an indirect intention are those siitras of expedient meaning that are mainly taught for the � of certain special purposes. These two are not contradictory because all four kinds of siitra$ with an intention (in terms of equality and so on) are included in those with the indirect intention in terms of a remedy. It is not that all siitras are included in these eight intentions and indirect intentions because these eight are stated in terms of only the siitras of expedient meaning. 300 11.31 (P5549, fol. 23b.8). 301 PSD and LSSP have rgyan gyi bshad sbyar dang de'i grel chen. 302 Mahayanasutralal'flkilratikii (D4029, fol. 107b.1-2), but Sthiramati's Sutriilal'flkilravrtti­bh�a does not mention this. PGSD (pp. 120-21) presents expedient and definitive meaning under three headings-( 1) identifying expedient and definitive meaning, (2) their divisions, and (3) their definitions. (1) What is said as merely a worldly convention is called \"expedient mean­ing\" and the ultimate basic nature of objects, \"definitive meaning.\" (2) The siitras whose subject matters respectively are not and are suitable to be accepted literally represent the division in terms of the means of expression. The siitras that mainly teach the seeming and mainly teach the ultimate, respectively, represent the division in terms of the subject matter. The siitras that are mainly taught for the sake of introducing those to be guided into the path and the frui­tion, respectively, represent the division in terms of those to be guided. The siitras that mainly teach topics that do not accord and accord, respectively, with the philosophical systems of the respective Buddhist factions represent the division in terms of philosophical systems. Among these, the division in terms of the subject matter is the fully qualified one (being stated in the Ratnakuta), while the other three are nominal. (3) The definition of siitras of expedient meaning"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"Notes 717 is \"the siitras that explicitly teach seeming reality as their main subject matter to adhere to.\" The definition of siitras of definitive meaning is \"the siitras that explicitly teach ultimate reality as their main subject matter to adhere to.\" Siitras of expedient and definitive meaning are each further divided into siitras of expedient and definitive meaning. In due order, the definitions of the latter two are \"siitras of expedient or definitive meaning, respectively, whose explicit subject matter is not suitable to be accepted literally\" and \"siitras of expedient or definitive meaning, respectively, whose explicit subject matter is suitable to be accepted literally.\" All for the progres­sion of introducing those to be guided to the teachings, it is reflected in the four reliances-not relying on persons, but on the dharma; not relying on words, but on the meaning; not relying on the expedient meaning, but on the definitive meaning; and not relying on consciousness, but on wisdom. The gist of this is that the wisdom of the tenth bhiimi is the practice of progressively accomplishing the welfare of others (the twelfth among the thirteen practices) because it is the wisdom of the tenth bhiimi that, by way of the eight intentions and indirect intentions, estab­lishes those to be guided in the paths of the three yanas. 303 PGSD (pp. 123-24) defines virtue as \"what is not neutral and yields pleasant results as its specific maturation.\" In terms of what concords with this name, it is classified as fourfold-(1) virtue by nature (the eleven virtuous mental factors such as confidence), (2) virtue in terms of congruent association (such as the primary minds and the five omnipresent mental factors that are so associated with one or more of the eleven virtuous mental factors), (3) virtue in terms of motivation (the physical and verbal actions motivated by (1) and (2)), and (4) ultimate virtue (the nature of phenomena, suchness). Virtue is furthermore classified as threefold in terms of body, speech, and mind. Nonvirtue is defined as \"what is not neutral and yields unpleasant results as its specific maturation.\" In terms of what concords with this name, it is classified as fourfold. (1)-(3) are analogous to the three of virtue and (4) the nonvirtue that is labeled as if being the ultimate consists of sarpsara. What is neutral is defined as \"phenomena that are neither virtuous nor nonvirtuous.\" Its fourfold classification is as above-(1) neutral by nature (such as the alaya and the afflicted mind), (2) neutral in terms of congruent association (such as the mental factors that are so associated with the alaya and the afflicted mind), (3) neutral in terms of motivation (the physical and verbal actions motivated by (1) and (2)), and (4) what is ultimately neutral (space as well as analytical and nonanalytical cessations). MCG (fol. 38a.1-6) divides virtue and so on each into the categories (1)-(3) as above, with nonvirtue by nature con­sisting of all primary and secondary afflictions except for innate ignorance and the two views about a real personality and extremes. 304 These are the faculty that makes everything unknown known, the faculty of knowing everything, and the faculty of being endowed with knowing everything. 305 These three refer to one's meditative absorption entailing both examination and analysis, only analysis, or neither. 306 04049, fol. 58a.4-5. 307 V.12-13ab and V.16-18. 308 MCG (fols. 38b.6-39a.1) says that (11) refers to understanding that uncommon buddha wisdom is the supreme and unsurpassable one among all phenomena that can be known and thus focusing on the manner of accomplishing it. 309 PGSD (p. 125) says that conditioned and unconditioned phenomena are explained because it is through meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, respectively, that ulti­mate reality and seeming reality are realized. Common and uncommon qualities are explained because they respectively arise based on realizing the two realities. MSLP (p. 42) says that, among virtuous phenomena to be adopted, one focuses on the mundane path as what is to be adopted temporarily and on the supramundane path as what is to be adopted ultimately. Then, in terms"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"718 Groundless Paths of the latter path, one focuses on contaminated phenomena as the factors to be relinquished and on uncontaminated phenomena as the remedies to be adopted. Among the latter, one focuses on conditioned phenomena as the temporary sphere of consciousness and on unconditioned phenomena as the ultimate sphere of wisdom. Among the unconditioned phenomena of the noble ones, one focuses on the common qualities of �rivakas and pratyekabuddhas and on the ultimate uncommon qualities of buddhas. 310 The Vrtti (p. 81) glosses \"assembly\" as the different assemblies of approachers and abid­ers. The siitras (CZ, p. 123) do not distinguish between \"host\" and \"assembly,\" but explain \"the great host and assembly of sentient beings\" as those on the level of the disposition up through bodhisattvas on the level of irreversibility. \"The level of the disposition\" is the lowest of the seven levels of the �ravakas as presented in the Vrtti (p. 107), the Aloka (p. 104), and the Vivrti (p. 76). For details on these levels, see PBG, p. 509. 311 PGSD (pp. 125-27) divides the aim into temporary (the qualities of realization and relin­quishment from the second moment of the path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum) and ultimate (the dharmakiya as one's own welfare and the two nipakiyas as the welfare of others). Great mind is defined as \"the generation of the bodhicitta of buddhahood that makes the persons whose mind streams are endowed with it the supreme among all sentient beings.\" In the definitions of great relinquishment and great realization, \"the generation of the bodhicitta of buddhahood\" is respectively replaced by \"the relinquishment of buddhahood\" and \"the realization of buddhahood.\" However, the aim of the practice of the mahayana is not definite in number as these three because it also consists of the two nipakiyas as the welfare of others. Still, the reasons for explicitly presenting it as threefold here are that what makes the aim supreme in that it is unrivaled by others, the overcoming of all antagonistic factors to be relinquished without exception, and the complete attainment of the qualities to be attained are definite as three. As for the reasons for presenting these three in the above order, great mind is taught first because the main aim of the practice of the mahayana is the welfare of others. Great relinquishment is taught next because the accomplishment of said aim depends on relin­quishing the two obscurations. Finally, great realization is taught because said relinquishment depends on attaining consummate realization. 312 PGSD (pp. 127-28 and 130-31) defines the nature of practice as \"the practice of bodhi­sattvas that possesses four distinctive features.\" The four features are the mahayana disposition having awakened, being established in the generation of the mindset of the mahayana, making efforts in accomplishing the welfare of oneself and others, and yielding the fruition that is great enlightenment. This practice is classified as two in terms of its objects and its nature. The defi­nition of the first one is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas of practicing the three knowledges through cutting through superimpositions onto them as the branches that, respectively, are what is to be attained, the means of attainment, and what is to be adopted and to be rejected.\" Thus, this practice is threefold in terms of practicing the knowledge of all aspects as the branch that is the result to be attained; the knowledge of the path as the one that is the cause for attaining it; and the knowledge of entities as the one that represents what is to be adopted and to be rejected. The definition of the practice in terms of its nature is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas of practicing the four trainings by way of being endowed with the six piramitis.\" The reasons for the mahayana prac­tice being definitely four in number in terms of both relinquishing the factors to be relinquished and attaining what is to be attained are as follows. In order to relinquish the two obscurations, bodhisattvas don the armor through their motivation, enter the battle through the application of this motivation, gather the battle friends of the two accumulations, and master the qualities of being victorious over all obscurations. In order to attain the fruition, bodhisattvas don the armor through their motivation, enter the practice of the path, gather the vast two accumula­tions, and manifest the fruition."},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"Notes 719 313 PVSO (fol. 18b.2-3) explains that this practice is called \"armorlikeD because it cannot be broken up through its antagonistic factors. 314 IN: the prajiias of the preparation, the main phase, and the subsequent attainment of nonconceptuality, respectively. 315 XVI.14. 316 XIX.28-29. 317 IV.5 (P5549, fol. 32a.1-3). 318 The three spheres are agent, recipient, and action. 319 PGSO (p. 128) says that one practices each paramita through being endowed with three features-possessing the mental engagement of the knowledge of all aspects (the preparation), not observing the three spheres (the actual main practice), and dedicating the roots of virtue to unsurpassable enlightenment (the conclusion). 320 The above explanations in the two Brhaffikas are respectively found in 03807 (fol. 151a.7-151b.3) and 03808 (fols. 116b.5-117a.5), and those in the Vrtti and the Aloka are on their respective pages 85.

Also, through mentally engaging in pith instructions, for a while even the mental flux of those who are not free from desire can be without examination and analysis (04035, fols. 37b.7-38a.2). 327 IN: the bliss of suppleness. 328 04090, vol. khu, fol. 69b.6-7.

According to other commentaries, (1) mindfulness refers to being liberated from the eight flaws of dhyina, (2) the mental fo rmation of equanimity is the resultant equanimity of being liberated from them, (3) the fe eling of equanimity is the benefit of the latter, and (4) the basis is samadhi as above. The difference between the fo rmation of equanimity and the feeling of equanimity is that the fo rmer refers to simply resting in a state of meditative equipoise in which there is no need or impulse to remedy any flaws of meditation, while the latter refers to being in an emotionally neutral state of mind that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 337 This means that samadhi is completed in the second dhyina, but not in the first; benefit, in the third, but not in the second; and purity, in the fo urth, but not in the third. 338 IN: in the first and second [dhyinas]. 339 IN: in the third one. 340 04049, fo l. 94b.6-7.

As for the fo rmer, the immeasurables can arise directly in all persons who have or have not entered the path of attaining the fo ur actual dhyinas. For the new arising of the immeasurables, a physical support within the desire realm is needed because they must arise by way of seeing others who are tormented by suffering and then wishing them to be free from it and so on. Once the immeasurables have arisen, their sustained state can also exist in physical supports within the form realm, but not in the fo rmless realm. For in the latter there are no other beings to take as fo cal objects whose suffering one wishes to eliminate. The mental sup­ports are any of the fo ur actual dhyinas.

The definition of immeasurable love is \"the samadhi (together with its congruently associated factors) of wishing that immeasurably many sentient beings encounter happiness, which is based on the states of mind of the actual dhyinas as its dominant condition.\" In the definitions of immeasurable compassion, joy, and equanimity, the phrase \"encounter happiness\" is replaced by \"are free from suffering.\" \"are not separated from happiness,\" and \"are free from attachment and aversion as well as being near or far,\" respec­tively. Each one of the four immeasurables is threefold in terms of focusing on sentient beings, the dharma, and being nonreferential. The definition of the first one is \"the samadhi (together with its congruently associated factors) that is the samadhi of immeasurable love, focuses on sentient beings as those who strive for happiness, and wishes that they encounter happiness.\" In the definitions of the second and third ones, the phrase \"focuses on sentient beings as those who strive for happiness\" is replaced by \"focuses, through having realized the lack of a personal self, on sentient beings as those who are specified by the lack of a self' and \"focuses, through having realized the lack of real existence, on sentient beings as those who are specified by the lack of real existence,\" respectively. The same applies to the other three immeasurables. As for the bound­ary lines of these three types of the four immeasurables, the first one exists even in persons who have not entered the Buddhist path; the second one, from the §ravaka path of accumulation onward; and the third one, from the mahayana path of accumulation onward. The immeasur­ables are four in number because they represent the remedies for their four antagonistic factors of hostility, maliciousness, mental unhapppiness, and manifest attachment and aversion. As for the manner of cultivating these four, one first cultivates them toward one's relatives and dear ones, then, toward other persons, and finally, toward one's enemies. In this way, one makes effort until all beings have become no different from one's own beloved mother. As for the respec­tive fruitions of the four immeasurables, according to the Anavataptanagarajapariprcchasutra, through a mind of equal love for all beings one always seizes the mind of omniscience. Through compassion, one never gives up on sentient beings. Through joy, one does not become weary in saJpsira. Through great equanimity, one relinquishes flaws. Their common fruitions are stated in Mahaytlnasutralarpkara XVII.22-23: The intelligent who dwell in these pure states Are always born in the desire [realm]. They complete the accumulations And mature sentient beings. They are nowhere separated from the pure states, Are free from their antagonistic factors, And are not affected by powerful conditions, Even when they are heedless. 352 Note that the original heading for this section in the outline above was \"[The practice of] bringing engagement to its end.\" 353 The forty-three letters and their order (beginning with \"A\") that the prajftaparamita sutra in twenty-five thousand lines lists in this context (CZ, pp. 160-62) correspond to the early Arapacana alphabet of the Karo�thi language of the northwestern Indian region of Gandhara. It was later widely used as a mnemonic device to symbolize Buddhist key terms (with each letter representing the first letter of a certain Sanskrit word). As in this case, these letters and the terms they stand for were often taken as the bases for contemplating their meanings. For example, with"},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"722 Groundless Paths regard to all phenomena, the first five letters of the Arapacana alphabet symbolize the follow­ing: \"A\"-being unborn (anutpannatva), \"RA\"-being free from pollution (mjas,lit. \"dust\"), \"PA\"-the ultimate (Jzg.ramartha) being empty, \"CA\"-dying (.cyavana) being unobservable, and \"NA\" -being without name (nama). 354 03808, fol. lla.7. 355 PGSO (pp. 137-39) explains that the dominant condition of the dh�is consists of the actual dhyanas, while its causes are being familiar with vast virtue in past lives, having studied many teachings of the Buddha in this life, and the pure samadhi that is embraced by realizing identitylessness. The definition of � is \"the mindfulness and prajfta (together with their congruently associated factors) of being able to seize the words and meanings, as appropriate, of limitless statements by the Buddha, which are based on the excellent causes that accomplish them as dhara�J.i.\" The meaning of \"dh�i\" (from Skt. dhara-\"holding\") is to seize the words and meanings of the dharma as well as the excellent path. The definition of the dh� of words is \"the mindfulness and prajna (together with their congruently associated factors) that are a subdivision of the four dhara!J.is and are able to seize, without forgetting, the words of limit­less statements of the Buddha.\" The definition of the dh� of meaning is the same except for \"words\" being replaced by \"meanings.\" These two are equivalent to the dharma vision of scriptures and the samadhi of the stream of dharma. They can be based on the maturation of virtuous karma, having studied many teachings of the Buddha, or the samadhi that is embraced by the realization of identitylessness. The first two types among these are called \"lesser\" because they also exist in persons who have not entered the Buddhist path. The latter one is called \"great\" because it exists only in persons who have entered this path. The definition of the � of poised readiness is \"the mindfulness and prajfta (together with their congruently associated fac­tors) of not being afraid of emptiness, which are a subdivision of the four�-\" It is twofold in terms of engaging in emptiness through aspiring for it and directly realizing it. The definition of the dh� of secret mantra is \"the mindfulness and prajii.a (together with their congruently associated factors) that are a subdivision of the four dhara!J.is and, through being embraced by the prajfta of realizing the lack of real existence, are able to bless the mantra words that repre­sent their results so that they yield fruitions.\" It is twofold in terms of realizing the lack of real existence as an object generality or in a direct manner. According to Mahayanasiltrala'!'llcdra XVIII.74, their functions are that, through relying on them repeatedly, bodhisattvas always elu­cidate and uphold the dharma. As for the number of the dh�is being definitely four, the �is have the two objects of words and meanings and consist of the cognizing subject that is wisdom. The first two dhara�J.is are presented in terms of seizing said two objects, while the last two are presented in terms of mainly accomplishing the welfare of oneself and others, respec­tively. As for their boundary lines, the first two also exist in those who have not entered the Buddhist path, while the latter two exist from the mahayana path of accumulation onward. The result of having cultivated the dhara�J.is is that, through first focusing on letters such as \"A,\" one gradually ascertains all phenomena as being identityless and free from reference points. 356 Lines 2lcd. 357 VII.33cd. 358 cz, p. 144. 359 03870, fol. 288b.4f. 360 I could not locate this passage in either of the two Brhattilcds. 361 That is, eyeballs, ear-holes, nostrils, tongue, and skin. 362 03801, fol. 108b.l."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"Notes 723 363 03807, fol. 176a.4-6; 03808, fols. 60b.1-3 and 301a.6 (the KaSyapa scripture is only men­tioned in 03808, while denying the flaw of repetition occurs only in 03807). 364 03807, fol. 178b.l. 365 03787, fol. 166b.4-5. 366 03862, fol. 324b.2-5. 367 In detail, the text's three reasons for why emptiness can be called \"other-entity\" are as follows. First, though emptiness is not established as any nature whatsoever, it abides as the supreme true reality of all phenomena at all times, no matter whether buddhas appear or not. In this respect, it is other than the phenomena of the seeming that bear this nature of emptiness since they do not exist at all times. Second, since emptiness is what is to be realized by ultimate supreme wisdom, it is other than the entities of the seeming, which are not what is realized by this wisdom. Third, emptiness is beyond SailJ.Sira. Thus, it exists \"on the other side\" of it, whereas the seeming is not beyond SailJ.sira. Thus, the highest reality or the suchness that is completely unchanging and has the defining characteristic of emptiness is \"the emptiness of other-entity.\" 368 03801, fol. 108b.5. 369 Interestingly, LSSP/PSO use here the very same terms (primordial nature and its man­ifestations) with which the Sirpkhyas describe their notions of an all-pervading, single, and primordial cosmic substance and of all phenomena just being different manifestations of this single substance. 370 \"Collection\" refers to both enlightened activity and its concording results, while \"its branches\" refers to said activity and its results separately. 371 LSSP (fol. 257a.3) says here that this represents the explanation of wisdom in relation to the twenty emptinesses by Ngog Lotsawa, who knew the intention of Haribhadra's boundary lines. Note that the dharmadhatu being realized as being omnipresent up through being the matrix of fourfold mastery corresponds to MlldhyiJntavibluiga 11.14-15. 372 LSSP (fol. 257a.4-5) adds that this is because neither Aryavimuktisena nor Haribhadra asserts any difference in the manner in which the nature of phenomena is realized through the paths of seeing and familiarization. PGSO (pp. 139-40) defines the equipment of wisdom in general as \"the wisdom of realizing identitylessness.\" It is twofold-the definition of the hinayana equipment of wisdom is \"the wisdom of realizing personal identitylessness in the mind streams of the followers of the hinayana.\" The definition of the mahayana equipment of wisdom is \"the wisdom of realizing phenomenal identitylessness.\" The definition of the equip­ment of wisdom that is explicitly taught here is \"the wisdom of realizing emptiness that arises mainly from meditation and functions as the direct cause of the path of the mahayana noble ones, which represents its result.\" When divided in terms of its boundary lines, this equipment is fivefold-the four wisdoms of realizing emptiness in the manner of an object generality through studying and reflecting, realizing it in the same manner through meditation, realizing it newly and directly through meditation, and familiarizing with what has been realized directly, and the wisdom of the ultimate direct realization. When divided in terms of its objects, the equipment of wisdom is twentyfold in terms of the emptiness of the internal and so on as above. As for the boundary lines of these twenty wisdoms, in terms of gaining certainty about the respective emp­tinesses through cutting through the superimpositions of being mistaken about them, they are as above in PSO (except for the first three being said to refer to the level of engagement through aspiration, while the fourth one refers to the supreme dharma). However, the sheer equipment of the wisdom of directly realizing all twenty emptinesses exists from the first bhlimi onward. 373 P. 99."},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"724 Groundless Paths 374 These refer to the paths of accumulation and preparation, respectively. 375 Xl.l-3. Both in terms of the content of these qualities and their increasing numbers on the remaining nine bhdmis (see below), the Madhyamakdvatara follows the Da5abhumikasutra (their main source). However, there are other sources, which vary in both respects. 376 04037, fol. 172a.2. 377 Usually, as presented in LSSP and other commentaries, Mahiibrahmii is said to rule over a dichiliocosm, while the king of gods in the pure abodes (Siva, a.k.a. MaheSva.ra) rules over a trichiliocosm. 378 MCG (fol. 45a.S-6) says on the manner in which the nature of phenomena is realized on the bhiimis that what is to be realized has no parts, but clear realization increases progressively by virtue of the progression of the mistakenness in one's mind stream becoming terminated, just as the sky has no parts, but the seeing of the sky is said to increase by virtue of the clouds vanishing progressively. 379 IX.34. 380 MCG (fol. 53a.4-53b.2) explains that the meditative equipoises of the bhtimis is with appearances because it is said, \"Though they rest in true reality, appearances are suitable, just as in the case of a buddha.\" This is very important. Therefore, when meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment are inseparable and the two realities are unified, within the scope of the self-appearances of a buddha's wisdom of seeing the nature of phenomena just as it is, appearances do not cease, but appear on their own. At the time of the path, during medita­tive equipoise, emptiness predominates and during subsequent attainment, appearances predominate. Once meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment are unified, this is the buddhabhdmi. Therefore, (a) the manner of a buddha's seeing through the two wisdoms of suchness and variety and (b) the meditative equipoises during the path being with and without appearances, respectively, are not contradictory. It is very important to understand this essential point. 381 LSSP and PSO literally have \"in the object\" (yul na, which may also be just a typo for yul ni). 382 Xl.13. 383 In sometimes varying formulations, these kinds of ignorance are found at the beginning of the siitra's ninth chapter (0106, fols. 40b.5-4lb.2). 384 IN: desire. 385 IN: the ignorance of destroying signlessness. 386 04049, fol. 84b.3-6. 387 04038, fol. 114b.6-7. 388 V.4ab-5. 389 04049, fol. 83b.6. 390 PSO follows LSSP's reverse order of the last two phrases without mentioning (as LSSP does) to which wrong engagement they refer.

The following quotes consist of verses XX.33-38 and the explanations are based on the respective passages of the Bhi4)'a. 400 Note that the Mahiiyiinasutriihz111kiirabh�ya on XX.38cd says, \"It is called 'Cloud of Dharma' because the gate of samadhi and the gate of dh�i pervade, like a cloud, the dharma that was heard-the skylike foundation in which they are deeply immersed\" (samiidhimukha dhiira�;�imukhavyiipaniin megheneviikiiSasthiiliyiiSrayasa'11nivi�tasya sri:ltadharmasya dhar­mameghety ucyate). Thus, thob pa'i rten in LSSP/PSD should rather be thos pa'i rten. According to PGSD (pp. 142-43), in the name of the second bhiim.i, \"stains\" refers to the afflictions, the causes for corrupt ethics. \"The Radiating One\" refers to its vast radiance of wisdom. \"The Facing One\" is endowed with the manifest prajiia of directly realizing the basic nature. \"Gone Afar\" means having gone far beyond any clinging to characteristics, which is by virtue of this bhiim.i being connected with the eighth one in the manner of being a direct cause and its result, respectively. The eighth bhiim.i cannot be moved by any clinging to characteristics or any mental engagement in one's own welfare. On the ninth bhiimi, through having attained the approxi­mately concordant four discriminating awarenesses, insight is unobstructed. 401 PGSD (pp. 140-45) defines a mahayana bhiimi as \"a mahayana learner's clear realiza­tion of directly realizing emptiness, which serves as the foundation of special qualities (such as the visions and supernatural knowledges).\" The first bhiimi consists of three paths. The defini­tion of its uninterrupted paths is \"the clear realizations of the reality of the mahayana, which consist of the process of directly relinquishing the cognitive obscurations that are factors to be relinquished through seeing.\" They are instantiated by the eight poised readinesses of persons on the mahayana path of seeing with duller faculties. The definition of its paths of liberation is \"the clear realizations of said reality that consist of the remedies which are the foundations of being liberated from the cognitive obscurations that are the factors to be relinquished through seeing by their respective uninterrupted paths as their specific causes.\" These are instantiated by the eight cognitions of said persons. The definition of its special path is \"the knowledge that arises after the completion of the mahayana subsequent cognition of the path and repre­sents the increase of the types of realization of the path of seeing.\" When divided, the special path consists of the subsequent attainment of the first bhiirn.i and, in terms of meditative equi­poise, the special paths that are included in its own level (such as the lion's sport) and those that are included in higher bhiirn.is (such as the knowledges of the second bhiirn.i and above). The same division in terms of these three paths applies to all following bhiirn.is as well. As for the second bhiim.i, the definition of its uninterrupted paths is \"the subsequent clear realiza­tions of the mahayana, which consist of the process of directly relinquishing the great degrees of the cognitive obscurations of the respective levels of the desire realm that are factors to be relinquished through familiarization.\" When divided, these uninterrupted paths are threefold in terms of the great, medium, and lesser great degrees of these obscurations. The definition of the paths of liberation of the second bhiirn.i is \"the subseqent clear realizations that consist of"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"726 Groundless Paths the remedies which are the fo undations of being liberated from the great degrees of the cogni­tive obscurations of the respective levels of the desire realm that are factors to be relinquished through familiarization by their respective uninterrupted paths as their specific causes.\" Their division accords with the previous. The definition and division of its special path are analogous to those of the first bhiimi. The divisions of the remaining bhiimis can be inferred from those of the second one. The first seven bhiimis are said to be impure because they are not pure of the characteristics of effort. The ten bhiimis are definite in number in terms of the three trainings in ethics, samadhi, and prajiia-the first one represents the cause of these trainings; the second through sixth, their nature; and the last four, their fruitions. The bhiimis are also tenfold in terms of the ten paramitas as what is to be practiced mainly on each one of them. They are likewise tenfold in terms of their fa ctors to be relinquished-the tenfold ignorance about the actuality of the dharmadhatu being omnipresent and so on as presented in Madhyantavibhaga 11.14-15 (and PSD's section \"Explanation of wisdom (the subject)\" above). As for the progression of realization on the bhiimis, it is twofold in terms of the isolates of realizing natural purity and the purity of adventitious stains. During the meditative equipoises of the ten bhiimis, there is no difference in the manner of seeing the naturally pure true nature of phenomena because when the naturally pure true nature of the reality of suffering is seen directly through the dharma readiness of suffering on the mahayana path of seeing, the naturally pure true nature of all phenomena is seen directly. For this is the direct perception of engaging the true nature of phe­nomena through practice and there are no divisions of different kinds in the naturally pure true nature of phenomena. As Aryadeva's Catul;rJatakti VIII.16 says, whoever sees the suchness of one entity sees the suchness of all entities. However, as outlined in .Mlldhyantavibhaga Il.l4-15, there is a difference in the manner of inducing various certainties about the nature of phe­nomena in relation to distinct bearers of this nature. As for realizing the purity of adventitious stains, there are differences during the meditative equipoises of the ten bhiimis because there is the manifestation of the dharmadhatu free from the factors to be relinquished through seeing on the first bhiimi up through the manifestation of the dharmadhatu free from all obscurations without exception on the buddhabhiimi. since a siitra (quoted in the Ratnagotravibhagavyakhya [J 77; P5526, fol. 119a5-6]) says: Just as the sun in a sky with a gap in the clouds, you are not seen in your entirety here Even by the noble ones who have the pure eye of insight but whose insight is limited. Bhagavan, [only) those whose perceptiveness is infinite see your dharmakiya In its entirety, which pervades the infinite firmament of knowable objects. As for the manner of realizing what is to be realized, the meditative equipoises of the ten bhiimis assess it in the manner of the two realities being in union. For through the view one cuts through all reference points with regard to appearances and, through meditation, one familiarizes with appearances as being without nature by fo cusing on them. The subsequent attainments of the bhiimis also assess what is to be realized in the manner of the two realities being in union because conditioned phenomena are assessed as being illusionlike in that they appear yet are without nature. For AA 11.21 says: As for special dedication, Its function is supreme. It has the aspect of nonreferentiality And the characteristic of unmistakenness. However, there is a difference between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment in terms of their manners of assessing what is to be realized. For the fo rmer assesses this by way of taking the ultimate as the object of its own mode of apprehension and taking the seeming merely as its"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"Notes 727 fo cal object, while the latter does so by way of taking the seeming as the object of its own mode of apprehension and taking the ultimate as its focal object. 402 03805, fol. 168b.3-4. 403 This etymology is based on the Sanskrit dhuta (to shake) in dhutagu�:�a, which is rendered in Tibetan as sbyang ba (to purify, train). 404 In the initial outline above, this heading was called \"The final practice.\" 405 PGSO (p. 130) divides these eight into two in terms of the place of deliverance and the manner of deliverance. The first one consists of (7) and (8) in terms of the deliverances onto the final path of nonlearning and the final path of learning, respectively. The manner of deliverance consists of (1)-(6). Thus, the knowledge of all aspects represents the level of final deliverance. The knowledges from the eighth bhfimi up through the last moment before the end of the continuum represent the level of accomplishing final deliverance. The wisdom of the end of the continuum represents both, and the seven impure bhfimis, neither. PVSO (fol. 21b.2-3) says that the eight practices of final deliverance are the activities of special means and prajiia that consist of the cognizing subjects which take said eight levels of ultimate deliverance as their objects. 406 PGSO (p. 147) says that the knowledge of the path that is the primary topic of the sec­ond chapter of the AA is necessarily the causal knowledge of the path because the knowledge of the path is definite as twofold (the causal one and the fruitional one that is contained in the buddhabhfimi) and the second chapter is taught in order to identify the cause of the knowledge of all aspects after the latter has been taught in the first chapter. The purpose in teaching the knowledge of the path separately from the knowledge of all aspects is that the attainment of the knowledge of all aspects depends on having practiced the knowledge of the path. 407 Usually, as in AA 11.1, the branches of the knowledge of the path are said to be five­fold-(1) eclipsing the gods through the Tathagata's light, (2) definite object (the generation of bodhicitta), (3) pervasiveness (the disposition), (4) nature, and (5) activity (see also PGSO below). Here (2) and (3) are subsumed under \"the manner of its arising.\" 408 This and the following quote are found on p. 204 in CZ. 409 04038, vol. zi, fol. 125a.2-125b.S. 410 Ibid., fol. 124a.6-124b.3. 411 PSO has khams sna tshogs pa'i mdo, but the Kangyur only contains the above khams mang po'i mdo. 412 11.58cd-59. 413 J 32-33; 04025, fol. 92a.5-92b.3. 414 J 56; 04025, fol. 104b.6-7. 415 XI.53. 416 Xl.54 (PSO omits the third line). 417 For details on this and the following section, see Alokii, pp. 133-34. 418 II, vv. 204-5 (0107, fol. 109a.2-3). 419 Verse 94.

PGSD (pp. 150-51) says that the three yinas are pre­sented with the intention of the temporary existence of three kinds of persons who possess the dispositions of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, respectively. Ultimately, however, only a single yina is established. For the Saddharmaput:�t/arikasutra says: The yina is a single one-there is no second one, Nor is there ever a third one. In the world, the supreme beings Only taught various yinas as [skillful] means. The Lalilcdvatarasutra (11.205; 0107, fol. 109a.3) states: There is no presentation of yinas, So I speak of a single yana. But in order to guide childish beings, I speak of different yinas. \"But does this not contradict Mahayanasfltrlila711lcdra III.2 speaking of many [dispositions]: Because of the differences in [beings'] dhatus, Aspirations, and accomplishments, And because of observing different results, The existence of the disposition is ascertained.\" There is no flaw because this is said with the intention that the sentient beings who are fatigued by the su1fering of saJpSira are temporarily established in the inferior IlirvaQas and then finally guided into the mahayana. MCG (fol. 56a.2-56b.4) says that the presentation of three yinas is of expedient meaning, bearing an intention. For according to the Lanlcdvatarasutra, the Saddharmaput:�t/arikasutra, the Srimaladevisutra, and others, the basis of this intention is that the three yinas are certain temporarily; the purpose of teaching three yanas is to provide some temporary rest in the two lower yinas for those beings who are afraid of the long time it takes to attain buddhahood and then guide them to buddhahood thereafter; and the invalidation of the explicit teaching consists of the following. The stains to be relinquished are like clouds and dross, and when the nature of the mind has been manifested in its ultimate state, the cause of su1fering (the clinging to an identity) has been relinquished and the nature of true realization cannot be harmed by su1fering. Also, there is the remedial prajiia of analyzing the two kinds of identity, which is directly opposed to said cause of su1fering. Though sravaka and pratyeka­buddha arhats cannot actually be reborn in sa�psara since the afilictions for such rebirth have been terminated, the Lalilcdvatarasutra says that they take on uncontaminated rebirths in lotus buds in pure lands upon being exhorted by the light rays of the buddhas to awake from their swoon in the uncontaminated dhatu. There they generate bodhicitta, cultivate the mahayana path, and eventually attain buddhahood. Furthermore, among the two kinds of dying and tran­siting (terminating a continuum and being inconceivable), it is said that the latter is not the one of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Therefore, it is established that, ultimately, there is only a single yina."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"Notes 729 423 This is the commentary by the Korean master Wonch'uk (a.k.a. Yuan-ts'e; 613-696), which was translated into Tibetan as 04016. 424 11.209cd (0107, fol. 109a.S-6). 425 PGSD (pp. 152-53) agrees that the noble ones of the inferior yanas must enter the mahayana on the path of accumulation. For in order to become a buddha, one must progress through all five paths of the mahayana in their due order. Furthermore, the direct realization of phenomenal identitylessness must be preceded by realizing it in the manner of an object generality. As for the justification that the noble ones of inferior yanas who have entered the mahayana are nevertheless ordinary beings, in the mind streams of those on the mahayana paths of accumulation and preparation who had previously attained the realization of arhat­hood in one of the inferior yanas, sometimes phases in which the direct realization of personal identitylessness is manifest are possible, but, mostly, such a realization exists in them in the manner of a powerful seed. For they do not need to make efforts in familiarizing with personal identitylessness (the remedy for the afilictions) because they have already relinquished the afilic­tions. As for the time when such phases of direct realization occur in them, through the power of being habituated to mentally engaging in their own welfare it is possible for said persons to fall back into the inferior yanas, but they do not need to enter these yanas via their respective paths of accumulation because they are able to directly dwell in their previous respective paths of arhathood. The mind streams of those on the mahayana paths of accumulation and prepara­tion who had previously attained merely the fruitions of stream-enterer and once-returner are not endowed with the manifest form of the prajiia of directly realizing personal identitylessness because they are endowed with the manifest form of the mahayana path of realizing the nature of phenomena in the manner of an object generality. Therefore, it is justified that both those on the mahayana paths of accumulation and preparation who had previously been noble ones in the inferior yanas are ordinary beings because, among the persons in the mahayana, they are those who realize the nature of phenomena in the manner of an object generality. The gist of this is that 'ravaka arhats must cultivate the knowledge of the path because they are sentient beings and will become buddhas. 426 PGSD (pp. 151-52) says that all sentient beings will necessarily and definitely become buddhas because (a) their mind streams are pervaded by the disposition as the primary cause, (b) the adventitious stains as the adverse conditions are suitable to be relinquished, and (c) the enlightened activities of buddhas as the favorable conditions are suitable to engage these mind streams. The first reason applies because of Uttaratantra 1.28 (\"The perfect buddhakaya radiates ... \").The second one applies because Prama,aviirttika 11.208cd says: Mind is naturally luminous, The stains are adventitious. The third one applies because Uttaratantra IV.l2 says: Because of setting out for the sake of others, Because of seeing sentient beings and oneself as equal, And because of what is to be done not being completed, There is no end of activity. Also, in the initial proof statement, the reasons entail the predicate. Forthe]nanalokiilal'!'lkiirasutra says, \"The light rays of the orb of the sun of the Tathagata touch even those whose mind streams are definitely [set) on wrongdoing, thus benefiting them and increasing their roots of virtue through producing future causes [for happiness].\" The Candrapradipasutra says: All these beings without exception will be buddhas, And there is no sentient being here who is not a vessel."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"730 Groundless Paths {Also the Prasphutapada (P5194, fo l. 54a.7) and the Munimatiila711lcara (P5299, fo l. 186a.8-186b.1) present this passage as stemming from the Samadhirajasutra (its early and shorter version being known as Candrapradipasutra), but I could not locate it in said sutra.} In general, satp.sara is said to be without end, as Madhyamalcavatara VI.194ac says: The beginning is first and the end is last­Since these two do not exist, Satp.sira Is said to be without beginning and end. \"But is this not contradicted by Catu}.!Sataka XIV.25cd saying: Having seen the identitylessness in objects, The seeds of (satp.siric] existence cease?\" There is no flaw since this is said with the intention that merely the satp.sara of persons with realization has an end. 427 03787, fo l. 147b.6-7. 428 See Wayman and Wayman 1974, p. 85. 429 04038, fo l. 119b.6. 430 I.67. 43 1 IV.66cd (the first line in PSO reads 'on kyang snying rje yis). 432 PGSO (pp. 147-50 and 153-55) speaks of five branches of the knowledge of the path in two main categories-( a) the three that newly produce this knowledge and (b) the two that benefit others once it has arisen. (a) The first are defined as \"the branches of the knowledge of the path that serve as its causes-making efforts in order to attain the unattained knowledge of the path.\" They consist of (1) the physical support that is free from manifest a11lictions as its obstructions (\"eclipsing the goods through light\" in AA II.l), which corresponds to a bodhisat­tva during the last moment of the supreme dharma who is free from such a11lictions, (2) the mental support of having generated bodhicitta as the favorable condition of the knowledge of the path (\"definite object\"), and (3) the mahayana disposition having awoken as the substantial cause of the knowledge of the path (\"pervasiveness\"), which corresponds to the lucid and aware mental consciousness that serves as the cause for the knowledge of the path. (b) The branches that benefit others are defined as \"the branches of the knowledge of the path that serve as its nature or its result.\" They consist of ( 4) the nature of the knowledge of the path corresponding to the mahayana paths of seeing and familiarization on which the causes for being reborn in Satp.sira for the sake of others-the latent tendencies of the a11lictions-are deliberately retained and not relinquished. (5) The function or activity of the knowledge of the path corresponds to the enlightened activity that arises based on the knowledge of the path functioning as its domi­nant condition. In general, the explanation that the affiicted mind exists in the mind streams of all ordinary beings is a coarse one-though bodhisattvas during the last moment of the supreme dharma are ordinary beings, they do not possess the a11licted mind because they are free from pride, that is because it is explained that realization arises only in those mind streams in which pride has been overcome. As for the afflictions taught here being actual versus nominal, in gen­eral, the term \"afflictions\" is applied to (a) manifest a11lictions, (b) their seeds, and (c) their latent tendencies. (a) The definition of a manifest a11liction is \"the form of awareness that appre­hends the fo cal object and aspect of its specific object by way of agitating the mind stream.\" Its instances consist of the primary and secondary afflictions together with all the primary minds and mental factors that are congruently associated with them. (b) The definition of a seed of"},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"Notes 731 affliction is \"the potential that is input into the mind stream through a preceding affliction of the same type and, when meeting with certain conditions, gives rise to a later affliction of this type.\" These seeds are twofold-the seeds that operate simultaneously with the afflictions and the seeds during whose own time the afflictions have already ceased. The first correspond to the potentials that consist of later forms of ignorance being produced through preceding ones of the same type. The second correspond to the seeds of the afflictions in the mind streams of noble srivakas while abiding in meditative equipoise. (c) The definition of latent tendencies is \"the very subtle stains that are the impregnations of negative tendencies which are input into the mind stream through preceding afflictions of the same type and, even when meeting with certain conditions, absolutely lack the potential for the arising of a later affliction of this type.\" Their synonyms are \"the latent tendencies of the afflictions,\" \"the impregnations of their negative tendencies,\" and \"the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance.\" (a) and (b) are fully qualified afflictive obscurations, while (c) represent the nominal ones. Thus, the afflictions that are taught in this context are not identified as (a) or (b), but only as (c) because the afflictions taught here function as the causes for noble bodhisattvas taking rebirth in SaJPsira for the welfare of others, while (as Uttaratantra 1.67 says) they have already relinquished the SaJPSariC births and deaths that occur under the sway of karma and afflictions. The afflictions (c) are twofold-the latent tendencies of the afflictions that function as obstructions to enlightenment and the latent tendencies of the afflictions that serve as its aids. The ones in question here are not the first because it is said that afflictive and cognitive obscurations are relinquished together. Therefore, they are the second because noble bodhisattvas deliberately retain these as branches of gathering the accumulations for the welfare of others. The Kasyapaparivartasutra says: Just as the manure of the excrement of city people Benefits the fields of sugar cane farmers, So the manure of the afflictions of bodhisattvas Benefits the production of the buddhadharmas. Asailga (Mahiiyiinasa,.,graha X.28; 04048, fol. 40b.l-2) states: In those who are endowed with great means, The afflictions become the branches of enlightenment And even SaJPsira has the nature of peace. Therefore, the Tathagata {PGSD: \"bodhisattvas\"} is inconceivable. As for bodhisattvas taking rebirth through said afflictions, the causes for such rebirths are as follows. Those who train in the inferior yanas and ordinary beings are born under the sway of karma and afflictions. For by virtue of not having relinquished the seeds of karma and afflic­tions, they cause birth and death in SaJPsira despite beings not wishing so. Arhats of the inferior yanas and noble bodhisattvas take rebirth in SaJPSira in dependence on the causes that consist of the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance and uncontaminated karma. For they must assume bodies of a mental nature-through the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance, they do so in order to attain the nirvil}.a without remainder and, through uncontaminated karma, they do so in order to gather the accumulations for the welfare of others-and have fully relinquished the causes that consist of karma and afflictions. As for the manner of taking rebirth, it is explained that those who train in the inferior yanas and ordinary beings, motivated by the afflictions, accumulate contaminated karma and thus accomplish the two links of dependent origination that consist of birth and aging in SaJPSira. Arhats of the inferior yanas and noble bodhisattvas, through the ground of the latent tendencies of ignorance functioning as the con­dition and uncontaminated karma as the cause, assume bodies with a mental nature, thus undergoing inconceivable deaths and transitions. In brief, for bodhisattvas on the path of"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"732 Groundless Paths seeing, there is a reason to deliberately retain the latent tendencies of the afflictions that serve as the causes for their taking rebirth in saip.sara for the welfare of others because they are the chil­dren of the victors who engage in promoting the welfare of sentient beings for as long as the saip.sira of those to be guided lasts. MCG (fols. 55b.1-56a.2 and 56b.4-57a.4) follows the format of PSD, but adds that the Buddha's light arises from his wisdom, while the light of gods arises from karma. (2) As for the manner of the arising of the knowledge of the path, temporarily speaking since it arises from the generation of bodhicitta (emptiness with a heart of compas­sion), this is its definite object. Ultimately since all sentient beings have the tathagata heart, all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas also are pervaded by the fact that the knowledge of the path in the single mahayana is suitable to arise in them. (3) The nature of the knowledge of the path is to gain mastery over the afflictions and thus to not manifest until Saip.Sira ends and the welfare of all sentient beings is fully accomplished. Here it is compassion that is labeled as natural afflic­tions, or it is through the skill in means of bodhisattvas that the afflictions are not relinquished. Generally, afflictions are twofold in nature-those that bind in Saip.Sira and latencies. In noble ones, the former do not exist. The latter do exist, but, through the skill in means of bodhisattvas, they become aids for enlightenment, just like poison turning into medicine. Though bodhisatt­vas attain the path of seeing, through mastering uncontaminated karma and what is to be relinquished on each bhiimi, unlike sravakas, they do not relinquish said latencies, but retain them as the causes for being reborn in saip.sira. By virtue of being embraced by prajiia and compasssion, said latencies are not fully qualified afflictions since they assist in accomplishing the buddhadharmas. (4) is as described in PSD. According to MPZL (pp. 65-69), the nature of the branches of the knowledge of the path is to be the special conditions for completing or per­fecting that knowledge. These branches consist of the branches of ( 1) relinquishing the adverse conditions of said knowledge, (2) accomplishing its favorable conditions, and (3) perfecting its function. (1) The explicit teaching in the sutras about the pride of the gods being overcome through their light being eclipsed points to the hidden teaching of the proper support for the arising of the knowledge of the path. The purpose of this hidden teaching is taught through the pertinent distinctive feature of relinquishment-having relinquished the manifest afflictions. Implicitly, this teaches the following. In terms of positive determination, those who dwell on the level of the supreme dharma of the mahayana path of preparation are suitable as supports for the knowledge of the path because they have relinquished the manifest afflictions. In terms of negative determination, those who are free from attachment due to having gone through mun­dane paths are not such supports because they have not relinquished the manifest afflictions of the Peak of Existence. (2) To accomplish the favorable conditions consists of (a) the generation of bodhicitta (the condition), (b) the awakening of the disposition (the cause), and (c) the nature of the means (the aid). (a) Through the generation of bodhicitta, which is oriented toward perfect enlightenment, it is taught that the object must be definite. Implicitly, this teaches the following. In terms of positive determination, those on the mahayana path of preparation are suitable as supports for the knowledge of the path because they have generated bodhicitta. In terms of negative determination, arhats free from attachment are not such supports because they lack bodhicitta. (b) Through the disposition having awoken, it is taught that its pervasive­ness must be definite. Implicitly, this teaches the following. In terms of positive determination, through the power of the disposition having awoken in those on the mahayana path of prepara­tion, they are necessarily suitable for the arising of the knowledge of the path. This teaches that, ultimately, there is definitely only a single yana. In terms of negative determination, the persons in whom the disposition has temporarily not been awoken are not supports for the knowledge of the path. (c) The aid-the nature of compassion-teaches that one must be endowed with the means of not relinquishing the afflictions. Implicitly, this teaches the following. In terms of positive determination, the knowledge of the path (which has the nature of prajiia) is united with its aid, means (which has the nature of compassion). In terms of negative determination, the paths of the hinayana are only of limited prajiia, but lack the means that is compassion."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"Notes 733 (3) Through the knowledge of the path consisting of special means and prajiia, it is taught that this knowledge is endowed with the special function of the means to accomplish the welfare of others. In terms of positive determination, this teaches that, though the ultimate function of the knowledge of the path that consists of special means and prajfta knows the true end, it does not manifest the true end in an untimely manner, but accomplishes the fruition that is the nonabid­ing nirvaQa. Its temporary function is to accomplish the welfare of others through gathering those sentient beings who have not been gathered as retinues, maturing those who were gath­ered, and liberating those who were matured. In terms of negative determination, this teaches that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas fall into the extreme of peace because they are inferior in terms of accomplishing the final fruition, and only accomplish their own welfare because they are inferior in terms of temporarily promoting the welfare of others. As fo r the meaning of not relinquishing the afflictions (the branch that is the nature of the knowledge of the path), to assert these afflictions as fully qualified afflictive obscurations entails flaws such as those bodhi­sattvas who have previously gone through inferior paths lacking this branch of the knowledge of the path and, in particular, the branches of the knowledge of the path not being complete in bodhisattvas on the three pure bhiimis (because all afflictive obscurations have been relin­quished on these bhiimis). As for asserting said afflictions as cognitive obscurations, there appears the tradition of claiming such things as bodhisattvas deliberately not cultivating the practice of the equipment of the remedies and the culminating training. Also, neither the asser­tion that these afflictions are latencies nor the explanation by others that bodhisattvas do not take the afflictive obscurations as their primary factors to be relinquished can transcend the flaws of the previous two assertions. In particular, the explanation that bodhisattvas do not take the afflictions as their primary factors to be relinquished for their own welfare entails innumer­able flaws, such as having to assert that bodhisattvas deliberately do not relinquish both types of obscurations and deliberately do not cultivate any remedial paths. Quoting some of the above passages from the Sagaramatipariprcchasutra in PSD, MPZL says that they teach the following. What is labeled as \"afflictions\" are the eight dharmas of bodhisattvas entering sa�p.sara as they please (which have the nature of compassion). The reason for labeling them as afflictions is their resembling the latter in that they connect with the three realms. Thus, it is the function of the skill in means of bodhisattvas engaging in the welfare of sentient beings out of compassion for as long as Satp.sara lasts that is labeled as \"afflictions\" because it is similar to (some of) their fea­tures. As for the purposes of such labeling, in general, though ordinary beings who are free from attachment (through mundane paths) have relinquished the afflictions of respectively lower lev­els, they did not relinquish those of the respectively higher ones and consequently are helplessly reborn in sa�p.sara. On the other hand, though noble bodhisattvas do not relinquish the afflic­tions temporarily, they are not born in sa�p.sara under their influence, but are skilled in the means to enter Satp.sara as they wish through the power of compassion. In particular, since sravakas and pratyekabuddhas reject any wish of entering sa�p.sara for the welfare of others like poison, they are not skilled in such means, whereas bodhisattvas are skilled in said means for as long as Satp.sara lasts. Most specifically, since sravaka and pratyekabuddha arhats have exhaus­tively relinquished the afflictions (the causes for entering sa�p.sara), they fall into the extreme of peace. Though bodhisattvas on the three pure bhiimis have also exhaustively relinquished the afflictions, they do not abide in the extreme of peace, but, under the sway of compassion, are skilled in the means to enter Satp.sara as they please. Thus, there is the purpose of realizing the greatness of their skill in these means. As for sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, who are not skilled in means, lack compassion, and fall into the extreme of peace, once they, through the power of the mahayana disposition having awoken in them, manifest compassion as the means and thus give rise to bodhicitta, they also enter the path of the mahayana, engage in sa�p.sara for the wel­fare of others as they wish, and so on. It appears that the profound meanings of these essential points of the greatness of the knowledge of the path being perfected and so on, as explained"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"734 Groundless Paths above, are only the sphere of bodhisattvas on the great bhiimis-they are hard to understand in just the way they are. 433 In this context, SZB {pp. 315-16) quotes the siitras, saying. \"Bodhisattvas should know all paths, give rise to all paths, and go beyond all paths\" (CZ. p. 518). The paths to be known by bodhisattvas are the three paths of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. The path to give rise to is the bodhisattva knowledge of the path of realizing that said three paths are unarisen or unobservable. The paths to go beyond are the paths of the limited realizations and relinquishments of srivakas and pratyekabuddhas as well as the respectively preceding paths of bodhisattvas. Here a bodhisattva's knowledge of knowing the path of srivakas is the familiariza­tion with the sixteen aspects of the four realities (such as impermanence) through not observing them and being free from the thirty-two superimpositions. More specifically, the sixteen aspects of the fo ur realities free from the sixteen superimpositions of permanence and so on represent the path of srivakas to be known. The cognitive aspect of realizing said aspects in a nonbserv­ing manner, or the path that is also free from the superimpositions of impermanence and so on, represents the path to give rise to. Thus, the limited realizations and relinquishments of the path of srivakas represent both the path to be known and, through realizing it in the man­ner of nonobserving, the path to go beyond. The path to give rise to is the path free from the thirty-two superimpositions that has the cognitive aspect of nonobservation and includes the realizations and relinquishments of srivakas. The same applies to the knowledge of the path of pratyekabuddhas. 434 Skt. salya can refer to any sharp weapon {such as spears, darts, arrows), anything tor­menting or causing pain (such as thorns or stings), or any extraneous substance lodged in the body and causing pain (such as splinters, pins, or stones in the bladder). The Tibetan has \"pain\" (zug rngu) throughout. 435 PSD has rang du mi gnas, but LSSP's ring du mi gnas makes more sense here. 436 MCG (fol. 58a.6-58b.1) says that this threefold division comes from Rongton. 437 MCG (fols. 57b.6-58b.5) glosses some of the above aspects di1ferently: (1) arising from conditions; (2) being under the sway of karma and afflictions; (4) suffering's own nature not being established as any identity; {5) craving as the cause of suffering being like a disease; (6) like evil, being the immediate condition for one's next rebirth; (10/17) destroying a continuum; (12/19) disintegrating momentarily; (26)-(29) being delivered from the factors to be relin­quished; (30) being the path to nirvil}a; (31) being appropriate as the direct remedy for the seeds of the afflictions; (32) directly realizing the true nature of mind; and (33) absolutely terminating suffering. These thirty-three aspects of the four realities in the prajftiiparamiti siitras and their sixteen aspects in the abhidharma di1fer only in terms of being classified in more or less detail, but accord in their meaning. 438 PGSD (pp. 155-58) identifies the three paths to be known through the bodhisattva knowledge of the path as fo llows. The type of realization that is the realization of personal identitylessness and the path of the srivakas as what is to be known are equivalent It is divided into three-the path of the srivakas as what is to be known that exists in the mind streams of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and fo llowers of the mahiiyiina, respectively. Likewise, the type of realization that is the realization of phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended and the path of the pratyekabuddhas as what is to be known are equivalent It is divided into two-the path of the pratyekabuddhas as what is to be known that exists in the mind streams of pratyekabuddhas and fo llowers of the mahiiyiina, respectively. The type of realization that is the realization of phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehender, the path of the mahiiyiina as what is to be known, and the realization of the mahiiyiina are equivalent. Though the type of realization of the sravakas is necessarily the path of the sravakas as what is to be"},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"Notes 735 known, the path of the srivakas as what is to be known is not necessarily the type of realization of the srivakas; for example, though the knowledge in the mind streams of noble bodhisattvas represents the path of the sravakas as what is to be known, it is not the type of realization of the sravakas. Therefore, the type of realization of the srivakas is merely the type of realization that is the realization of personal identitylessness, and the same goes for the pratyekabuddhas. However, it is not contradictory to take the path of the sravakas as what is to be known and the type of realization of the srivakas on the one hand and the path of the pratyekabuddhas as what is to be known and the type of realization of the pratyekabuddhas on the other hand as being equivalent, respectively, and then to say that either one of these two is not necessarily either the path of the sravakas or the path of the pratyekabuddhas. As for the manner of noble bodhisattvas knowing said paths, in terms of the manner of knowing that these paths exist in the mind streams of others, it is held that the dharma vision that is the realization in the mind streams of noble bodhisattvas directly knows the natures, focal objects, aspects, and manners of arising of the types of realization of realizing identitylessness that exist in the mind streams of other persons. For the dharma vision of such bodhisattvas is able to directly know all the divi­sions of the faculties of those noble persons whose mind streams are equal or inferior to these bodhisattvas. In terms of bodhisattvas knowing said paths in their own mind streams, during subsequent attainment they directly know the types of realization of realizing personal identity­lessness by way of experiencing them in their own mind streams. During meditative equipoise, in the manner of nonobserving, they know that the types of realization of realizing personal identitylessness lack real existence because AA 11.2b says, \"Through not observing the aspects . . . \" The definition of the knowledge of the path (the cognizing subject) is \"the knowledge of the mahayana noble ones of realizing the principles of the paths of the inferior yanas, just as they are, and then being skilled in generating the qualities of these types of realization in the manner of the lower being incorporated in the higher.\" Its instances consist of all paths of mahayana noble ones. As for how the srivaka knowledge of the path is taught in the siitras and the AA, in the relevant passages of both the siitras and the AA both the path of the sravakas as what is to be known and the knowledge of the path are taught explicitly because said passages explicitly teach both the types of realization that consist of directly realizing the sixteen aspects of the four realities (AA 11.2acd) and the knowledge of the path (the cognizing subject)-the path of directly realizing that this very path lacks real existence (AA Il.2bd). In the siitras (CZ, p. 204-5), the knowledge of the path as the cognizing subject is taught explicitly by the statement that it is endowed with three distinctive features-mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects (preparation), nonobservation (main practice), and dedicating the roots of virtue for perfect enlightenment (conclusion). The path of the srivakas as what is to be known is explicitly taught by \"impermanence, suffering ... \" in this siitra passage. Among the two types of the path of the sravakas as what is to be known, the one in the mind streams of srivakas and pratyekabuddhas is taught implicitly and the one in the mind streams of bodhisattvas is taught explicitly. In brief. the mahayana path of seeing is the knowledge of the path of knowing the path of the sravakas. For it is the knowledge of mahayana noble ones of realizing, in order to take care of those to be guided who have the sravaka disposition, the principles of the focal objects and aspects of the path of the sravakas, just as they are, and then being skilled in generating the qualities of this type of realization in the manner of the lower being incorporated in the higher. 439 PGSD (p. 163) has \"the subdivisions of karma, that is, causes and results.\" 440 PGSD (p. 165) says that, according to the Abhidhannasamuccaya (04049, fol. 110b.1-2), it is by virtue of their former aspiration prayers that pratyekabuddhas are definitely only reborn in the desire realm. 441 04037, fol 46b.3-4."},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"736 Groundless Paths 442 PGSO (p. 165) says that the four fruitions of the sravakas (stream-enterers and so on) are not presented for the pratyekabuddhas because the prajftapiramiti siitras enumerate the latter separately from the former. 443 04090, fol. 159b.2. 444 PGSO (p. 164) adds mostly remaining in silence as the abiding of speech. 445 PGSO (pp. 164-65) says that pratyekabuddhas first examine, through their supernatural knowledge, whether there is some benefit for others in their going to towns and villages on alms rounds. When they go there, through their miraculous powers they instill confidence in those who lack it and establish those with confidence in the higher realms and nirvaJ}a. Also, through their supernatural knowledge, they know the different faculties of the beings to be guided and, by virtue of their former aspiration prayers, teach the dharma by way of various physical dis­plays that accord with the respective thinking of said beings, thus being able to bring forth in these beings the realizations that they wish for. This manner of teaching is their predominant one, but it is not the case that pratyekabuddhas absolutely never teach the dharma with words. 446 04090, fol. 159b.5. 447 04092, fol. 324a.2. PGSO (pp. 158-68) defines pratyekabuddhas as \"those whose mind stream is endowed with the clear realization of the middling yana-ascertaining the ultimate view that consists of personal identitylessness plus the phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended.\" The pratyekabuddha disposition of rhinolike pratyekabuddhas is certain from the beginning and their faculties are sharp, while the pratyekabuddha disposition of group practitioners is not certain and their faculties are dull. Therefore, the former progress swiftly through the path of the noble ones, while the latter do so more slowly. Unlike for rhinolike pratyekabuddhas, for group practictioners it is possible to have been either ordinary or noble sravakas (that is, stream-enterers and once-returners) before. As for which sravaka persons can become pratyekabuddhas, according to the Vaibha4ikas (Abhidharmako§a VI.19ab and 23cd) sravakas can enter the mahayana up through the level of peak of the sravaka path of prepara­tion, but not thereafter. They still can become pratyekabuddhas on the lesser and medium levels of poised readiness of the sravaka path, but not on the level of great poised readiness. For imme­diately after great poised readiness, they attain the supreme dharma and right after that, they attain their path of the noble ones, after which they do not enter other yanas. According to the Mere Mentalists, even sravaka stream-enterers and once-returners can enter the pratyekabud­dha path, but nonreturners cannot because they do not take rebirth in the desire realm through karma and afilictions anymore. According to the Midhyamikas' own system, sravakas can enter the pratyekabuddha path even after having become nonreturners because it is possible for sravakas with uncertain disposition who have relinquished the ninth degree of the afilictions of the desire realm and are on the path of familiarization to study and reftect on phenomenal iden­titylessness in terms of the apprehended under the inftuence of a pratyekabuddha spiritual friend. About the path on which sravakas become pratyekabuddhas, the proponents of entities say that sravakas enter the pratyekabuddha path on the remaining paths beyond the respective sravaka paths that they have already gone through. For sravakas and pratyekabuddhas differ merely in respectively having sharper and duller faculties, but are otherwise alike in belonging to the inferior yana. According to the Madhyamaka system, sravakas must enter the pratyekabud­dha path on the pratyekabuddha path of accumulation because the final clear realization of phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended must be preceded by its correspond­ing path of familiarization-continually familiarizing with said identitylessness that was already realized on the corresponding path of seeing. As for the manner of pratyekabuddhas progress­ing on the path, there are three positions. (1) According to the hinayana, rhinolike pratyekabuddhas gather the accumulations on the path of accumulation for one hundred eons. In their last life, they progress through the four dhyanas and, through relying on the highest"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"Notes 737 form of the fourth dhyana, accomplish the level of heat up through the enlightenment of termi­nation and nonarising in a single session (Abhidharmakosa VI.24ab). The group practitioners manifest pratyekabuddhahood in their last life without relying on a teacher, but while associat­ing with pratyekabuddha companions. This is the explanation of the Bihyaka Vaibh�. while the Kashmiri Vaibha,ikas assert only rhinolike pratyekabuddhas. (2) The Abhidharmasamuccaya {04049, fol., 106b.3-7) says, \"'Who are those in the pratyekabuddhayana?' They abide in the nature of a pratyekabuddha being either certain or uncertain, are naturally of medium faculties, make aspiration prayers in order for themselves to attain liberation, have renunciation, are free from attachment, have the intention to become liberated, have the intention of themselves becoming fully and perfectly enlightened, practice the dharma in accordance with the dharma through focusing on the srivakapitaka. either have not given rise to the factors conducive to penetration previously or have given rise to the factors conducive to penetration previously, and either have not attained [srivaka) fruitions previously or have attained such fruitions previously. In any case, in the absence of buddhas, they manifest the path by themselves and, as rhinolike ones, become pratyekabuddhas by living alone, or reach the end of suffering as group practitio­ners.\" In brief, this teaches the four distinctive features of the disposition in which pratyekabuddhas abide, their path (prajii.a and means), their focus as their support, and their manner of progressing on the path. {3) Our own uncommon system says that pratyekabuddhas, partly similar to the manner of bodhisattvas progressing on the mahayana path, gather the accu­mulations during one hundred eons in three equally long periods, which respectively consist of the pratyekabuddha paths of accumulation, preparation, and seeing; the respective three phases of their lesser and medium paths of familiarization; and the three phases of their great path of familiarization. All for the relinquishment and realization of pratyekabuddhas, the Bodhisattvabhumi {04037, fol 46b.3-4) holds that there is no difference between them and the 5ravakas, which is also asserted by Bhavaviveka in his Ta rkajvala {03856, fol. 169b.3-4) and by others. However, in the AA there is a difference in that srivaka arhats are endowed with the final realization of personal identitylessness and pratyekabuddha arhats, with the final realization of phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended. The identification of the path of the pratyekabuddhas as what is to be known, the manner of knowing it, and the pertaining knowl­edge of the path as the cognizing subject are to be understood in analogy with the knowledge of the path of the srivakas above. All for the manner in which the knowledge of the path of pra­tyekabuddhas is taught in the AA and the sutras, the path of pratyekabuddhas that is endowed with three distinctive features (relinquishing the conceptions about the apprehended, not relin­quishing the conceptions about the apprehender, and having the disposition as the foundation; see AA II.S) is explicitly taught as the actual bodhisattva knowledge of the path that is the cog­nizing subject of directly realizing identitylessness, whereas the path of pratyekabuddhas in their own mind streams is taught implicitly. Among said three features, {1) the one of relin­quishing the conceptions about the apprehended (\"Form is neither profound nor subtle ... \" [CZ. p. 210)) means that pratyekabuddhas, on their own path, realize that outer referents (the apprehended) lack real existence and thus are able to relinquish the clinging to their real exis­tence, including its seeds. (2) All for the feature of not relinquishing the conceptions about the apprehender (\"Those who listen to the dharma from me should wish to be like an illusion ... \" [CZ, p. 210)), though pratyekabuddhas realize outer referents (the apprehended objects) to be illusionlike, on their own path they are not able to cut through the superimpositions of clinging to the real existence of the mind as the cognizing subject. {3) The distinctive feature of the dis­position as the foundation is twofold-( a) the persons on the path who are the psychophysical supports and (b) the disposition that is the nature of phenomena. (a) Among the six kinds of persons mentioned in the sutras (CZ. p. 212), \"irreversible bodhisattvas\" refers to those on the path of preparation; \"persons who have reached sound views,\" to bodhisattvas on the first fifteen moments of the path of seeing; \"arhats,\" \"those who have terminated the contaminations,\" and \"those who have fully completed their intention,\" to bodhisattvas on the sixteenth moment of"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"738 Groundless Paths the path of seeing-the subsequent cognition of the reality of the path (in due order, they receive these three names because they relinquished all factors to be relinquished through see­ing, relinquished the afilictions of the three realms, and completely attained the types of realization of the path of seeing); and \"those who attended to the victors of the past ... ,\" to bodhisattvas on the path of accumulation. The phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended is something that is to be known directly by bodhisattvas for the sake of others, but since they do not familiarize with this realization in a continuous manner, those on the path of familiarization are not explicitly taught in the siitras. (b) As for the disposition that is the nature of phenomena (exemplified through the magically created flowers of the gods [CZ, p. 214]), though magically created flowers lack any arising by their nature, on the level of seeming reality it appears that they arise in distinct areas and at distinct times. Likewise, the dharmadhatu of mind's luminosity with stains represents the feature of the disposition as the foundation, which is illustrated by the examples of its temporary functioning as the foundation of practice. In brief. the mahayana path of seeing is the knowledge of the path of knowing the path of pratyekabud­dhas. For it is the knowledge of mahayana noble ones of realizing. in order to take care of those to be guided who have the pratyekabuddha disposition, the principles of the focal objects and aspects of the path of the pratyekabuddhas, just as they are, and then being skilled in generating the qualities of this type of realization in the manner of the lower being incorporated in the higher. MCG (fols. 60b.2-6la.2) says th«i following on self-arisen wisdom in the context of the knowledge of the path of pratyekabuddhas (AA 11.6). If the wisdom of pratyekabuddhas is self­arisen, you may wonder, \"Then the wisdom of pratyekabuddhas would be without a cause,\" or, \"Since self-arisen wisdom has no cause, it is not suitable to be accomplished through the path, or it would manifest even without having cultivated the path.\" Such wisdom in which all reference points have subsided does not manifest without having relied on the prajnapiiramitii of the path that consists of the poised readiness for profound actuality because said wisdom does not appear before by virtue of being obscured by adventitious stains. Let alone the ultimate self-arisen wis­dom that is inseparable from the nature of phenomena, even the wisdoms of suchness being pure of obscurations to certain degrees that are attained through the inferior yiinas come about due to the power of their belonging to the class of prajnapiiramitii that consists of the poised readiness (or the powerful mind) for the actuality of the limited emptiness of eliminating views about entities. Therefore, it is justified that pratyekabuddhas, by virtue of the cause of their hav­ing familiarized with one-and-a-half of the two kinds of identitylessness before, realize these kinds of identitylessness in their last lifetime despite their not being taught by others. MPZL (pp. 70-71 and 74) says that the paths of the �riivakas and pratyekabuddhas as what are to be known are contained in the knowledge of entities, while the clear realization of knowing that these paths are unobservable is contained in the knowledge of the path of bodhisattvas. In order to know all paths for the sake of taking care of those to be guided with the three dispositions and in order to complete all relinquishments and realizations of the three yiinas in their own mind stream, bodhisattvas do know the true end through their profound prajfia of realizing, without observing the three spheres, all paths of the three yiinas that make up the knowledge of entities. However, through the means that consists of the compassion of deliberately not relinquishing the afflictions (the nature of their path), they do not manifest the true end in an untimely man­ner. Thus, through being embraced by these special means and prajfiii. they give rise to the path in their own mind streams, complete the relinquishments and realizations of all three yiinas, go beyond limited paths, and also know the paths that are to be taught to those to be guided with the three dispositions. Therefore, it is this kind of the knowledge of the path that represents the distinctive feature of bodhisattvas alone, while the paths that are to be known by it (the paths that are in common with §ravakas and pratyekabuddhas) are contained in the knowledge of entities. If this is not analyzed properly, one will not understand the profound intention of the prajfiapiiramitii siitras."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"448 In both instances of \"weariness,\" PSD has skye ba, but LSSP has skyo ba. 449 04037, fol. 256a.5-6. 450 VI.55bc. Notes 739 451 PGSD (pp. 168-69) explains that the beings on the above three continents represent the physical supports of the arising of the path of seeing through one's own power because these beings are naturally of sharp faculties. However, the path of seeing can also directly arise through the power of others because it is explained that the realization of the knowledge of the path arose, through the miraculous powers of the Tathagata, in the gods of the form realm who came to him to listen to the dharma. In brief, the physical supports of the arising of the path of seeing are the persons who are on the level of the supreme dharma in the systems of their respective yanas. All for the mental supports, the hinayana path of seeing can rely on any of the six grounds of dhyana, while the mahayana path of seeing is mainly attained through the actual dhyanas that are embraced by special compassion (Mahayanasiltriilaf!'lkiira VII.2a). In particular, it can even be attained through relying on the Peak of Existence because the actual meditative absorption of the Peak of Existence that represents the nature of the last moment of the path of preparation can function as the mental support of the actual meditative absorption of cessation that represents the nature of the dharma readiness of suffering. 452 VI.28cd. 453 PGSD (pp. 169-70) defines the path of seeing in general as \"the clear realization of the four realities that represents the direct realization of identitylessness, which arises subsequent to the completion of the path of preparation in the systems of the respective yanas.\" The definition of the sravaka path of seeing is \"the sravaka clear realization of the four realities that represents the direct realization of personal identitylessness.\" The definition of the pratyekabuddha path of seeing is \"the intermediate yana's clear realization of the four realities that represents the direct realization of phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended.\" Both sravaka and pratyekabuddha paths of seeing consist of the sixteen moments of the readinesses and cog­nitions. The definition of the mahayana path of seeing is \"the mahayana clear realization of the four realities that represents the direct realization of emptiness.\" Whatever is a mahayana path is not necessarily one of the five mahayana paths because the path of seeing consists necessarily of its meditative equipoise, while the wisdom of the subsequent attainment of the first bhiimi is not the path of seeing, though it is included in the path of seeing. In terms of its objects, the path of seeing is divided into sixteen moments such as the dharma readinesses. In terms of its nature, it is divided into two-the uninterrupted path and the path of liberation. The definition of its uninterrupted path is \"the mahayana clear realization of the four realities that consists of the relinquishing remedy for the cognitive obscurations that are factors to be relinquished through seeing.\" The definition of its path of liberation is \"the mahayana clear realization of the fo ur realities that consists of the sustaining remedy for said obscurations.\" Note that, in the general context of (a) being in the process of eradicating the respectively corresponding factors to be relinquished on a given path or (b) having already eradicated them, the four remedies are pre­sented as follows. (1) The invalidating remedy is the path of preparation (focusing on the four realities of the noble ones and invalidating the obscurations in terms of their sixteen aspects). (2) The relinquishing remedy refers to the uninterrupted paths (the actual process of eradicating even the seeds of the respective factors to be relinquished). (3) The sustaining remedy refers to the paths of liberation (experiencing and sustaining the attained freedom from the factors that have been relinquished through the preceding uninterrupted paths). (4) The distancing remedy refers to the special paths (enhancing the realizations that were attained through the preceding paths of liberation). In this way, the first two remedies belong to phase (a) and the last two to phase (b)."},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"7 40 Groundless Paths 454 04049, fol. 93a.6-93b.4. 455 PGSO (p. 174) quotes the Abhidharmasamuccaya (04049, fol. 93b.4) in support: \"A moment of mind should be understood as the complete arising of a cognition with regard to what is to be cognized [by it].\" 456 1.43. 457 P. 171. 458 Lines llcd-12. 459 This passage corresponds almost literally to a passage in the ViniScayasalflgraha�;�i (04038, fol. 118a.7-118b.2). 460 Ibid., fol. 118b.3. 461 PGSO (pp. 170-73) says that, among the four systems of asserting the path of seeing as having one, two, four, and sixteen moments (for details, see below), our own system is the last one. Within this last system, there are the systems of (a) Asailga, (b) Vasubandhu, and (c) Haribhadra. (a) Asailga's Abhidharmasamuccaya (04049, fol. 93a.5-93b.3) holds that the mahayana path of seeing is divided into sixteen moments in terms of its substance, that is, four moments for each one of the fo ur realities, which serve as the remedies for the factors to be relinquished through seeing: \"(1) What is readiness? It is the uncontaminated prajfia in which the reality of suffering becomes revealed as one's own personal experience by virtue of prior analysis [on the path of preparation]. Through this [prajfia] of seeing suffering, the [respective] afflictions to be relinquished are relinquished. This is call ed 'the readiness for the dharma cogni­tion of suffering.' (2) What is the dharma cognition of suffering? It is the cognition that manifests liberation [from the respective afilictions] right after the end of the readiness [for the dharma cognition of suffering]. (3) What is the readiness for the subsequently realizing cognition of suffering? It is the uncontaminated prajfia right after the end of the dharma cognition of suffer­ing in which it becomes revealed as one's own personal experience that the two [cognitions that consist] of the readiness for the dharma cognition of suffering and the dharma cognition of suffering are the causes for the qualities of the noble ones. ( 4) What is the subsequently realizing cognition of suffering? It is the cognition that definitely seizes the readiness for the subsequently realizing cognition. The readinesses and cognitions that correspond to the remaining three real­ities should be understood in the same way. Here, through the readinesses for dharma cognition and the [dharma] cognitions, the apprehended is realized [to be empty]. Through the subse­quently realizing readinesses and the [subsequent] cognitions, the apprehender is realized [to be empty]. It should be understood that all readinesses and cognitions entail the yoga of dwelling in signlessness. These sixteen moments of mind constitute the path of seeing.\" (b) According to Abhidharmakosa VI.25cd-26, the dharma readiness of suffering is the uninterrupted path of directly relinquishing the factors of the desire realm with regard to the reality of suffering that are to be relinquished through seeing. The dharma cognition of suffering is the path of libera­tion of being free from these factors. The subsequent readiness of suffering is the uninterrupted path of directly relinquishing the factors of the two higher realms with regard to the reality of suffering that are to be relinquished through seeing. The subsequent cognition of suffering is the path of liberation of being free from these factors. The same applies for the remaining three realities. (c) According to Haribhadra, both in terms of the manner of seeing the nature of phe­nomena and the fruitional clear realization, the mahayana path of seeing has a single moment. However, in terms of the individually distinct clear realizations and the manners of inducing certainty, it has sixteen moments. For the Alokii (pp. 170-71) asserts that the path of seeing's sixteenfold power of inducing the sixteenfold certainty during subsequent attainment that can­cels out the sixteenfold superimpositions of apprehending the four realities in a wrong way arises progressively during the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing. Also, said text"},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"Notes 741 presents these sixteen moments by following the Abhidhannasamuccaya as above. In terms of the progression of the faculties of bodhisattvas, it is not contradictory to present four manners of the arising of the mahayana path of seeing because there are the four manners of its arising in bodhisattvas with (1) very sharp, (2) sharp, (3) medium, and (4) dull faculties. (1) In bodhisat­tvas with very sharp faculties, it arises in a single moment because they are able to complete the activities of the path of seeing that consist of knowing suffering, relinquishing its origin, mani­festing cessation, and cultivating the path in the very moment when they directly and newly see the nature of phenomena. In terms of isolates, the path of seeing has sixteen moments-from the perspective of directly realizing the basic nature of the four realities with regard to the desire realm, it is presented as the four dharma cognitions; from the perspective of not being afraid of that, as the four dharma readinesses; from the perspective of directly realizing the basic nature of the four realities with regard to the higher realms, as the four subsequent cognitions; and from the perspective of not being afraid of that, as the four subsequent readinesses. This is also the intention of Niigiirjuna's explanation of the mahayana path of seeing having a single moment (2) In bodhisattvas of sharp faculties, in terms of substance the path of seeing arises in two moments. First, there arises an uninterrupted path of directly relinquishing all factors of the three realms to be relinquished through seeing and then a path of liberation of being free from these factors. In terms of isolates, the former is presented as the eight readinesses and the latter as the eight cognitions. (3) In bodhisattvas of medium faculties, in terms of substance the path of seeing arises in four moments. First, there arises an uninterrupted path of directly relinquish­ing all factors of the desire realm to be relinquished through seeing, which is followed by a path of liberation of being free from these factors, an uninterrupted path of directly relinquishing all factors of the higher realms to be relinquished through seeing, and a path of liberation of being free from these factors. In terms of isolates, these four are presented as the four dharma readi­nesses, the four dharma cognitions, the four subsequent readinesses, and the four subsequent cognitions, respectively. (4) In bodhisattvas of dull faculties, in terms of substance the path of seeing arises in sixteen moments, as explained above by Asaitga and Vasubandhu. The Prasphutapada (03796, fol. 78a.2) says that the exact duration of the path of seeing of bodhisat­tvas can never be delimited in general since it depends on the prajila, the vigor, and the faculties of individual bodhisattvas. MCG (fols. 62b.S-63a.6) says that there are many assertions about the sixteen moments of the path of seeing, such as that, after the respectively former have arisen, the respectively later take them as objects and cognize them. However, the instances of seeing the four realities with regard to the phenomena of the desire realm are called \"dharma readi­ness\" and \"dharma cognition,\" while those of seeing the four realities with regard to the phenomena of the two higher realms are called \"subsequent readiness\" and \"subsequent cogni­tion.\" The poised readinesses represent the actual remedies of directly seeing the four realities-the uncontaminated prajfiiis of the uninterrupted paths-and the cognitions are their paths of liberation. There are several assertions about these sixteen moments arising progres­sively or simultaneously and the manners of presenting each. However, the position that accords with the facts is that the realization of the true nature of the four realities in a complete manner through the prajila of realizing the actuality of the identitylessness of all phenomena happens in the single moment of completing this action, while its division into sixteen moments is merely one in terms of isolates. In particular, this position is very much justified in the mahayana's system of seeing all phenomena as emptiness free from reference points. Nevertheless, for the prajfia with reference points, which bears the aspects of the four realities, certainty arises pro­gressively in the order of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path. In this way, for said type of prajila, there are individual moments of completing the actions of seeing the four realities one by one. MPZL (pp. 77-79) explains that, according to Candrakirti's commentary, \"dharma cognition\" in the above quote from the Yuk��tika does not refer to dharma cognition versus dharma readiness, but to the cognition of the dharma that is ni rviil.la-cessation as the basic nature that is the inseparability of the ultimate nature of phenomena and the three among the"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"7 42 Groundless Paths four realities that consist of the seeming bearers of this nature. The presentation of the path of seeing as having sixteen moments is given for the purpose of those who wish for liberation familiarizing with engaging in true reality, but, ultimately, the two presentations are one in nature. According to Maitreya's intention with regard to the hidden meaning of the praji!.aparamita siitras (the progression of clear realization), throughout the chapters of the AA the path of seeing is asserted as consisting of sixteen isolates in terms of its factors to be relin­quished and their remedies. For example, in terms of isolates, the single wisdom of the path of seeing can be divided into two wisdoms by virtue of the identitylessnesses of two particular bearers of this nature of identitylessness. Likewise, the single remedial wisdom of the path of seeing, in terms of its focal objects, is divided into the four isolates of realizing the basic nature of the four realities as the bearers of this nature. In terms of the realms, through the particulars of the four realities with regard to the desire realm and the two higher realms, respectively, each one of these four is divided into the two isloates of dharma cognition and subsequent cognition, thus making eight. In terms of the manner of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished, since the single uninterrupted path of the path of seeing relinquishes all factors to be relinquished through seeing simultaneously, it is through the isolates of its relinquishing said eight wrong engagements in the four realities in terms of the different realms that one speaks of the eight readinesses. In the same way, the path of liberation of being free from these factors represents the eight cognitions. It is in this way that one, in terms of isolates, arrives at the sixteen moments of poised readiness and cognition, but one should understand that this does not refer to sixteen moments that arise in a progressive manner. In particular, AA V.22cd (\" ... which consists of poised readiness in one single moment is the path of seeing here\") says explicitly that, in their nature, all uninterrupted paths consist of the single moment of the wisdom of poised readiness. Therefore, both Nagarjuna and Maitreya as the two system founders who comment on the intention of the prajnaparamita siitras share the same essential point here. It appears that others identify the poised readiness in AA V .22c as solely the poised readiness of the reality of suffering and yet assert that, though this poised readiness relinquishes all factors to be relinquished through seeing simultaneously, the following fifteen wisdoms of poised readiness and cognition (which have the natures of uninterrupted paths and paths of liberation) still arise in a progres­sive manner thereafter. 462 PSD has \"heard\" (thos pa) instead of \"attained,\" while LSSP has \"because of having stopped being conceited about having attained eminence after being disciplined\" (dul ba'i rjes la khyad zhugs pa thob pa la rlom pa bkag pas). 463 PGSD (pp. 174-75) defines the function of the path of familiariZation as \"the excel­lent virtues that are attained through the power of having cultivated, in exact accordance with its nature, the mahayana path of familiariza tion as their specific cause.\" Its function is two­fold-temporary (the qualities of relinquishment and realization from the second moment of the path of familiarization up through the end of the continuum) and ultimate (the qualities of relinquishment and realization of a buddha). In terms of results, its above six functions can be summarized into three-( a) results produced by persons, (b) results of maturation, and (c) dominated results. (a) The first are twof old-in terms of pacifying inner harm, functions (1) and (2) represent the temporary results and (3) is the ultimate result, while (4) is presented in terms of pacifying outer harm. Function (5) represents result (b) and (6) represents (c). 464 PGSD (pp. 176-78) defines the path of familiarization in general as \"the subsequent clear realization of familiarizing with the direct realization of identitylessness that has already hap­pened.\" The definition of the sravaka path of familiarization is \"the sravaka subsequent clear realization of familiarizing with the realization of personal identitylessness that has already happened.\" The pratyekabuddha path of familiarization is analogous with regard to phenom­enal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended. The definition of the mahayana path of familiarization is \"the subsequent clear realization of familiarizing with the direct realization"},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"Notes 743 of emptiness that has already happened.\" In terms of its nature, it is divided into two-con­taminated and uncontaminated. In terms of its aspects, it is divided into nine (the lesser of the lesser and so on). The contaminations here are identified as the conceptions that are the cogni­tive obscurations of apprehender and apprehended appearing as different. However, it is not from the perspective of the contaminated path of familiarization and these conceptions defi­nitely operating simultaneously that the path of familiarization is presented as being associated with said conceptions. For during the subsequent attainment of the pure path of familiarization there is no certainty that said conceptions arise in a continuous manner. Therefore, the meaning of \"contaminated\" is that the seeds of these conceptions are taken as the objects of the mode of apprehension that apprehends all kinds of reference points of seeming reality and is the condition for the arising of subsequent conceptions similar in type (the reverse of that is the meaning of \"uncontaminated\"). Consequently, whatever is a contaminated path of familiariza­tion is necessarily uncontaminated. The definition of the contaminated path of familiarization is \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that takes seeming reality as its primary object\" (all subsequent attainments of the mahayana path of familiarization). The definition of the uncontaminated path of familiarization is \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that takes ultimate reality as its primary object\" (all meditative equipoises of said path). 465 03795, fol. 263b.4. 466 Pp. 211-12. 467 03801, fol. 132b.1-2. 468 03796, fol. 58 b.5-6. 469 03801, fol. 132b.l. 470 This passage is found in the Sanskrit version (see Sparham 2008a, pp. 20-21 ), but is miss­ing in 03787 (it should be on fol. 101a.4). 471 03787, fol. 104a.l. 472 03796, fol. 58b.6. 473 I could not locate this passage in either the Suddhamati or the Vrtti. 474 03803, fols. 75b.7-76a.l. PGSO (pp. 178-80) defines the path of familiarization as aspiration as \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that consists of the subsequent attain­ments of aspiring fo r mother prajiiapiiramita as being the source of the three welfares.\" The definition of the path of familiarization as the aspiration for one's own welfare is \"the impure path of familiarization that is congruently associated with the resolve of aspiring for mother prajilapiiramitii as being the source of one's own excellent welfare.\" The definition of the path of familiarization as the aspiration for the welfares of oneself and others is \"the path of familiariza­tion of the pure bhumis before the arising of the wisdom of the tenth bhllmi that is congruently associated with the resolve of aspiring for mother prajiiaparamitii as being the source of both excellent welfares.\" The definition of the path of familiarization as the aspiration for the welfare of others is \"the path of familiarization of the mind stream of the tenth bhllmi that is congru­ently associated with the resolve of aspiring for mother prajiiaparamitii as being the source of the excellent welfare of others.\" Each one of these three being divided into nine (the lesser of the lesser and so on) is illustrated in the sutras through nine examples each, but it is not that the first, middle, and last arising of said paths of familiarization are presented as lesser, medium, and great, respectively. For it is not contradictory for these nine examples to exist in the mind stream of a single person. As for the boundary lines, the first one exists from the second through the seventh bhllmis. For through the power of the coarse latencies of the afflicted mind not having changed state, one's application primarily accomplishes one's own welfare. The second one exists on the eighth and ninth bhllmis because one's application is able to effortlessly accomplish both"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"7 44 Groundless Paths welfares, but one has not yet attained the state of, from the perspective of those to be guided, one's accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings during subsequent attainment equaling the one of a buddha. This state is only attained on the tenth bhdmi, on which the third type of the path of familiarization as aspiration exists. However, from the perspective of relinquishment and realization, the accomplishment of the welfare of beings on the tenth bhdmi does not equal the one of a buddha because this is made clear in the sutras through the examples of a minute particle and the earth, respectively (the same is said in Uttaratantra I.78, which compares the two with the amount of water in a hoofprint and in the ocean, respectively). 475 XVIII.74ab. 476 PGSD (pp. 180-81) defines the path of familiarization as dedication as \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that consists of the subsequent attainments of dedicating the roots of virtue of oneself and others to perfect enlightenment.\" In terms of its boundary lines, it is twofold-existing on the impure and pure bhtimis. In terms of its objects, as listed in the sutras, it is twelvefold (CZ, pp. 269-81). The definition of dedication in general is \"being congruently associated with the resolve that one's own and others' roots of virtue cause the accomplishing of a special fruition.\" It is twofold-dedication for higher realms and nirviir}.a, with the latter con­sisting of the dedications in the hinayana and the mahayana, respectively. The roots of virtue to be dedicated consist of all those that are accumulated in the three times. The levels to which they are dedicated are threefold-mundane levels, the levels of the hinayiina, and unsurpass­able enlightenment. In terms of special dedication, said virtues are dedicated by way of being embraced by the prajiia that is free from the three spheres. The purpose of dedicating in this way is to make virtues inexhaustible and increase them further. The witnesses of dedication are all buddhas and bodhisattvas in the three times, to whom one prays so that one's dedication will be accomplished. 477 PGSD (p. 182) defines the path of familiarization as rejoicing as \"the mahayana subse­quent clear realization that consists of the subsequent attainments of perfectly cultivating the joy about the roots of virtue of oneself and others, which is congruently associated with the fe eling of mental bliss.\" It is twofold in terms of the impure and pure bhtimis. 478 PGSD (pp. 181-82) says that aspiration, dedication, and rejoicing are not mutually exclusive because all types of contaminated mahayana paths of familiarization are included in the path of familiarization as aspiration. For all of them are paths of familiarization that are embraced by the resolve of striving for enlightenment. However, the three are not coextensive because aspiration and dedication, which are congruently associated with the fe eling of equa­nimity, are not the path of familiarization as rejoicing. According to MPZL (p. 80), the paths of familiarization as aspiration, dedication, and rejoicing, respectively, are the causes that produce the accumulation of merit during subsequent attainment that has not arisen yet, let the already arisen merit not decline, and increase that undeclined merit. Similarly, SBZ (pp. 316-17) says that the reason for teaching the contaminated subsequent attainment of the path of familiar­ization through the triad of aspiration, dedication, and rejoicing is as fo llows. In general, the practice of subsequent attainment includes infinitely many mundane and supramundane paths (such as the piiramitiis and the four immeasurables). However, aspiration gives rise to the path in one's mind stream through bringing together all paths of subsequent attainment (such as the piiramitiis). Through dedication, all paths arise through being dedicated to the knowledge of all aspects and thus do not decline. Through rejoicing, said paths as well as the roots of virtue of others do not only not decline, but increase further as the causes of the knowledge of all aspects. In this way, these three gather the accumulations during subsequent attainment. 479 PGSD (p. 182) defines the path of familiarization as accomplishment as \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that consists of the remedies that relinquish the cognitive obscura­tions, which are the fa ctors to be relinquished through familiarization.\" It is equivalent to the"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"Notes 745 uninterrupted paths of the mahayana path of familiarization. In terms of its boundary lines, it is twofold-existing on the impure and pure bhlimis. In terms of relinquishment, it is also two­fold-the paths of familiarization as accomplishment that directly relinquish the seeds of the factors to be relinquished through familiarization and their impregnations of negative tenden­cies, respectively. 480 CZ, pp. 291-92. 48 1 This means that the above quote is taken as a probative argument with subject (the purities of form, prajftapiramiti, and fruition), predicate (these three being one), and reason (because they do not exist as two and so on). 482 PGSD (pp. 182-84) defines the pure path of familiarization as \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that consists of the sustaining remedies for the cognitive obscurations which are the factors to be relinquished through familiarization.\" It is equivalent to the paths of libera­tion of the mahayana path of familiarization. & for taking the above quote from the siitras as a probative argument, the subject in question is the path of liberation that is taught explicitly here as the pure path of familiarization. It is fourfold in terms of srivakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhi­sattvas, and buddhas, but the one to be taught primarily here is the mahayana path of liberation. & for the predicate, when the paths of liberation are pure of their respective stains, their objects (such as form) are also pure of their respective stains and the seeing of the true nature of these objects is also pure of its respective stains. & for the reason, with a mind that accords with the facts one cannot analyze any difference between the paths of liberation of the mahayana path of familiarization being pure of their respective stains and the seeing of the true nature of their objects being pure of its respective stains, neither through a difference in substance in terms of specifically characterized phenomena, nor through distinct isolates in terms of generally char­acterized phenomena. & for the particular explanation of the pure fruition, its definition is \"the qualities of the paths of liberation, or the reality of cessation, of being free from the seeds of the respective factors to be relinquished through the power of the uncontaminated uninterrupted paths.\" This is equivalent to the fruitions of the approach of virtuous effort. The definitions of the pure fruitions of srivakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, respectively, are \"the quali­ties of the paths of liberation, or the reality of cessation, in the mind streams of those in the lesser yana, those in the middling yana, and noble bodhisattvas.\" The definition of the pure fruition of buddhas is \"the qualities of realization or relinquishment of having exhaustively relinquished the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies.\" In brief, the path of libera­tion of the second bhiimi represents a pure fruition because it is the sustaining remedy of being free from its respective obscurations through the uninterrupted path that is its specific cause. 483 PGSD (pp. 175-76) explains the following on the physical supports of the arising of the path of familiarization. For pratyekabuddhas, it is certain to arise in a physical support within the desire realm. For srivakas, the support of the new arising of their path of familiarization is one within the desire or form realms, while the support of sustaining an already arisen path of familiarization can also be one in the formless realm. For bodhisattvas, the support is certain to be one within the desire or form realms and not one in the fo rmless realm because the lat­ter is not a suitable support of the direct operation of the enlightened activity of mahayana noble ones. & for the mental supports, the new arising of the path of familiarization of the hinayana can rely on any of the six grounds of dhyana, while the mental support of sustain­ing an already arisen path of familiarization can also be a state of mind in the formless realm. For srivakas on the path of familiarization can manifest the meditative absorption of cessation through relying on the actual meditative absorption of the Peak of Existence. The path of famil­iarization of bodhisattvas mainly relies on the actual fourth dhyana because calm abiding and superior insight are properly balanced in it, which makes it easy to practice the path. However, it is not that the path of familiarization of bodhisattvas does not rely on the states of mind of"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"746 Groundless Paths the formless realm at all because the actual formless meditative absorption whose nature consists of the last moment of the special path of the meditative equipoise of the first bhiimi functions as the direct cause for the second bhiimi. Though the first moment of the mahayana path of familiarization is definitely a meditative equipoise, its direct cause can be both the special path of the meditative equipoise of the first bhftmi and the special path of the subsequent attainment of that bhiimi. 484 PGSD (pp. 185 and 187) says that the knowledge of entities that is the main topic of the third chapter of the AA must be the remedial knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas because those to be guided for whom this chapter is mainly taught must be those with the mahayana disposition. As for the reasons for teaching the knowledge of entities after the knowledge of the path, through understanding that the knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas is one in nature with its cause, the knowledge of the path, it is understood that it is the actual cause of the knowledge of all aspects and that the paths of the hinayana represent the antagonistic factors of, that is, the places of going astray from, this knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas. Therefore, it is explained here by differentiating the hinayana and mahayana knowledges of entities. In brief, without knowing all entities to be adopted and rejected, the paths of all three yanas are not known prop­erly. The definition of the knowledge of entities of not abiding in sup.saric existence and peace is \"the knowledge of mahayana noble ones of directly realizing that satp.sara, nirval}.a, and what is between do not exist by any nature of their own.\" Its instances consist of all the knowledges of mahayana noble ones. The definition of the knowledge of entities of abiding in satp.saric existence and peace is \"the knowledge of hinayana noble ones of not realizing this.\" Its instances consist of all the knowledges of hinayana noble ones. The mahayana knowledge of entities is also called the \"knowledge of entities of not abiding in the extremes of either satp.siric existence or peace.\" For through great prajiia, bodhisattvas do not abide in the extreme of satp.sira and, through great compassion, they do not abide in the extreme of nirval}.a. The hinayana knowl­edge of entities is called \"the knowledge of entities of abiding in the extremes of both satp.saric existence and peace\" because the followers of the hinayana cling to satp.sira as what is to be rejected and nirvai}.a as what is to be adopted. MCG (fols. 73b.6-75a.2) states that the entities with regard to which the knowledge of entities cuts through superimpositions consist of skan­dhas, dhatus, and ayatanas. The realization of srivakas is to know that all of these are merely empty of a personal identity. The realization of the mahayana is to know them as freedom from reference points because they are empty of both identities. The first six among the nine points of the knowledge of entities (not abiding, or abiding, in sup.sara or nirval}.a; being close to, or distant from, the fruitional mother; and being remedial or antagonistic factors) describe the differences between the hinayana and the mahayana knowledges of entities, while the last three (trainings, equality of the trainings, and path of seeing) describe the actual path of the mahayana knowledge of entities. Prajiiapiramita is the wisdom of satp.sara and nirvai}.a (or the three times) being equal in the expanse of the nature of phenomena-great equality. That this great equality does not abide in either extreme of satp.sara (entities) and nirvai}.a (nonentities) is called \"the knowledge of entities,\" \"sugata heart,\" and \"dharmadhatu.\" Therefore, the cognizing subject that fo cuses on this is called \"the knowledge of the path.\" From the perspective of not abiding in the extreme of nirval}.a, it is called \"great compassion\" and, from the perspective of not abiding in the extreme of satp.sara, \"prajiiapiramita.\" Through realizing this just as it is, it is impossible to abide in either of these two extremes. On the other hand, the path of the sravakas that is to be relinquished here apprehends satp.sira as an entity and nirviJ.ta as the extinction that is the nonentity of the five skandhas having ceased. This mistaken mode of apprehension does not go beyond the sphere of minds and mental factors and thus not beyond the objects of the three realms. Therefore, mind does not cease, whereas the remedial knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas represents the subsequent attainment of mind having ceased through realiz­ing profound equality. MPZL (pp. 90-92) says that one should not conflate entities (seeming"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"Notes 747 phenomena such as the skandhas) and the knowledge of entities, which realizes the true nature of these entities. It is the latter that constitutes the first of the nine points that define the knowl­edge of entities. It must be explained according to the intention of the slitras and the great treatises as being only a fe ature that defines the knowledge of entities, but without grasping the essential points of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path, one should not explain the profound intention of prajftaparamita to others. What is primarily explained in this chapter here through the detailed division of the knowledge of entities is the explicit teaching on the uncommon knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas. The reasons for explaining this are that, according to the slitras, sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas must all attain their respective forms of enlightenment through practicing prajftaparamita and that the knowledge of entities is presented with regard to sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, while the knowledge of the path is presented with regard to bodhisattvas. Thus, it is taught that sravakas and pratyek­abuddhas only possess the particular instance of prajftapiramita that is the mere knowledge of entities, but not the knowledge of the path or the knowledge of all aspects. Therefore, the sravakas possess the particular knowledge of entities that is the mere clear realization of per­sonal identitylessness, but lack the knowledge of entities of realizing that these entities lack any phenomenal identity. The pratyekabuddhas possess the particular knowledge of entities of additionally realizing that, among phenomena, apprehended objects lack any identity, but they still lack the clear realization that is the complete knowledge of entities (that is, realizing both types of identitylessness fully). This presentation is well known among all Indian and Tibetan scholars as being the intention of the prajftaparamita slitras and the AA. It also eliminates the presentation of those who say that the knowledge of entities is nothing but the realization of personal identitylessness. Thus, sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possess merely the common kinds of the knowledge of entities that serve as the remedies for their particular obscurations (respectively, just the afflictive obscurations and the afflictive obscurations plus one half of the cognitive obscurations), whereas only bodhisattvas possess the uncommon knowledge of enti­ties that serves as the complete remedy for the cognitive obscurations. Therefore, this chapter determines the distinctions between the common and the uncommon knowledges of entities. The uncommon knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas is taught in detail by way of its nature, distinctive fe atures, factors to be relinquished and remedies, trainings, and the path of seeing of clearly realizing it. In this way, one should not think that the knowledge of entities is nothing but the knowledge of entities that consists of the path of sravakas and is to be relinquished by bodhisattvas. 485 PGSD (p. 189) defines the knowledge of entities that is close to the fruitional mother as \"the knowledge of noble bodhisattvas of being skilled in the means of accomplishing the fruitional mother.\" Its instances are the mahayana paths of seeing and familiarization. The definition of the knowledge of entities that is distant from the fruitional mother is \"the knowl­edge of hinayana noble ones of not being skilled in the means of accomplishing the fruitional mother.\" Its instances are the hinayana paths of seeing, familiarization, and nonleaming. 486 Conze 1973, p. 84. 487 cz, pp. 57-58. 488 Sal!lyutta Nikaya III.141-42. 489 IV.21. 490 Verses 46-48. 49 1 The three paths are the twelve links of dependent origination, grouped in three catego-ries: affliction (links 1, 8, 9), karma (links 2 and 10), and arising (the remaining seven links). 492 1.35-37."},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"7 48 Groundless Paths 493 Lines IV.66ab. 494 IV.90. 495 04049, fol. 100b.6-7. 496 PGSD (pp. 187-88) says that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lack the realization of phe­nomenal identitylessness because this lack is established through both scripture and reasoning. The Mahasannipataratnaketudhara�i says: Those who always regard the three realms as being identityless, Substanceless, and without an autonomous agent, And cultivate the according poised readiness Will be liberated from all migrations. The Lail.kavatarasiltra states, \"Not to realize signlessness means not realizing the enlighten­ment of the mahayana, but it does not mean not realizing the enlightenment of sravakas.\" The Ghanavyilhasutra says: Because of not destroying the existence of phenomenal entities Sravakas clearly realize this. As for the reasonings, if sriivakas and pratyekabuddhas realized phenomenal identitylessness, it would follow that the hinayana is not a path that lacks both special means and prajfia because it possesses the prajfia of realizing emptiness. If this is accepted, it stands in contradiction to the following passages. Prajnaparamitasa,.cayagatha XVI.5d says: Through being without means and lacking prajfiii, they fall into sriivakahood. AA V.10ab states: Realizations being deficient Due to falling into existence or peace ... Also, it would follow that it is untenable to explain blind people not perceiving the sun and the followers of the hinayana not perceiving emptiness free from reference points, respectively, as an example and its corresponding meaning because sravakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the prajfia of directly realizing emptiness. If this is accepted, it contradicts Uttaratantra 1.153 saying: The ultimate of the self-arisen ones Is to be realized through confidence alone. Those without eyes do not see The bright and radiant disk of the sun. Also, it would follow that the explanation of the followers of the hinayana lacking the four hap­pinesses of intending the welfare of others, achieving the means for that, realizing the vastness of all phenomena there are, and realizing emptiness is not tenable because they possess the prajfia of realizing emptiness. If this is accepted, it contradicts Mahayanasiltriila111kiira IV.21 (see PSD above). 497 This and the following quotes are found on pp. 299-301 in CZ. 498 PGSD (pp. 189-91) defines the remedial knowledge of entities as \"the knowledge of mahayana noble ones of not being bound by clinging to characteristics in terms of the charac­teristics of the triad of ground, path, and fruition.\" The definition of the knowledge of entities that is an antagonistic factor is \"the knowledge of hinayana noble ones that is bound by such clinging.\" That the mahayana knowledge of entities is not bound by said clinging to characteris­tics in terms of ground, path, and fruition is because it, through the power of directly realizing that ground, path, and fruition lack any nature of their own, is able to relinquish said clinging,"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"Notes 749 including its seeds, on its own path. The hinayana knowledge of entities is bound by such cling­ing because it lacks such realization and thus is not able to relinquish said clinging, including its seeds, on its own path. The clinging to characteristics that is to be relinquished here is the mental state of grasping at conditioned phenomena as being not dependent on anything else, but being autonomous. This clinging is twofold-its instances that are included in the afflictive obscurations consist of the innate and imputational clinging to a personal identity. Its instances that are included in the cognitive obscurations consist of the coarse stains of clinging to objects, which arise from the clinging to a phenomenal identity. These stains can be divided in terms of (1) the clinging itself and (2) its objects. (1) Clinging is twofold-the clinging to characteristics that consists of (a) clinging to substance and (b) clinging to imputations. (a) The clinging to substance corresponds to the clinging to identity that conceives of the three spheres with regard to all phenomena (subjects and objects). It is equivalent to the clinging to a phenomenal identity and is twofold. (aa) The innate clinging to a phenomenal identity corresponds to mental states of naturally clinging to subjects and objects as being really existent, without relying on any scriptures, reasonings, and so on. (ab) The imputational clinging to a phenomenal identity cor­responds to mental states of clinging to subjects and objects by way of examining and analyzing them on the basis of seemingly valid scriptures and reasonings. (b) The clinging to imputations corresponds to the conceptions that are cognitive obscurations and cling to subjects and objects as being mere imputations. It is twofold-coarse and very subtle. (ba) The first one consists of the clinging to characteristics and the conceptions that apprehend by conflating terms and referents, which exist up through the seventh bhiimi. (bb) The second one consists of the very subtle clinging to objects as being mere imputations, which exists up through the subsequent attainment of the tenth bhiimi. (2) In terms of its objects, clinging to characteristics is three­fold-clinging to (a) the ground, (b) the path, and (c) the fruition. (a) is the twofold clinging to characteristics with regard to the nature of phenomena and the bearers of this nature at the time of the ground, which is taught by AA III.3ab: The antagonistic factors are discriminating notions about engaging In the skandhas (such as form) being emptiness ... (b) The clinging to characteristics with regard to the path is taught by AA III.3d: And the factors of enlightenment (such as generosity). (c) The clinging to characteristics with regard to the fruition is taught by AA 111.4d: Thus, attachment to the victors and so on is subtle. Therefore, through the AA explicitly teaching here the clinging to characteristics that binds, the hinayana knowledge of entities that is bound by it is taught by implication. As for the manner in which the remedial knowledge of entities relinquishes these forms of clinging to characteristics as its factors to be relinquished, it is not that the remedial knowledge of entities and the entirety of the clinging to characteristics are explained by way of matching them as the remedy and its factors to be relinquished because mental states of clinging to characteristics are not necessarily associated directly with the remedies that overcome them. Therefore, the wisdom of noble bod­hisattvas of directly realizing the lack of characteristics directly relinquishes the obscurations in the mind streams of these bodhisattvas. For through directly canceling out the seeds of clinging to characteristics in said mind streams, it indirectly overcomes the manifest forms of this cling­ing. MPZL (pp. 93-94) divides the factors to be relinquished here into the clinging to entities as (real) phenomena, which consist of the two realities, and the clinging to entities as a person who engages in the practices of the path. Implicitly, in the latter clinging, the discriminating notions of clinging to the practices as the remedies for the clinging to a person who practices them are included as factors to be relinquished too. Though there appear to be different sys­tems of saying that this clinging to a person exists only in sriivakas and pratyekabuddhas, what"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"750 Groundless Paths appears as the intention of the AA and its commentaries is as follows. Said clinging does exist in the mind streams of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas in general, but it is also associated with the mind streams of bodhisattvas in the manner of a factor to be relinquished and, up through the seventh bhli.mi, sometimes they even have manifest forms of clinging to characteristics. After the seventh bhiimi, the relinquishment of the clinging to a person is completed, while the relin­quishment of the clinging to phenomena is completed at the end of the continuum. 499 The Sanskrit prayogamarga and the Tibetan sbyor lam can mean \"path of training,\" \"path of preparation,\" or \"path of connecting.\" 500 This and the following quotes are found on pp. 302-5 in CZ. 501 P. 425. 502 These two terms are explicitly used by LSSP (fol. 394a.2). 503 LSSP (fol. 394a.6-394b.l) adds the following: \"Conceived form-the other-dependent [nature]-is the basis for analyzing said being complete or incomplete. Therefore, it is not that it is not taught here because it is (a) the basis for the superimpositions that are the imaginary nature and (b) what bears the nature of the perfect [nature]. This principle is to be applied to [everything] up through the knowledge of all aspects. In brief, if one does not cling to form and so on as being the three natures, one engages in the mother.\" PGSD (pp. 192-93) defines the imaginary nature as \"the phenomena that are the mere seeming appearances which do not per­form a function.\" It is twofold-the imaginary without any characteristics (such as the horns of a rabbit) and the nominal imaginary (everything that is permanent and is not ultimate reality). The definition of the other-dependent nature is \"dependently originating phenomena, which arise from their specific causes and conditions.\" It is twofold-the pure other-dependent cor­responds to the subsequent attainments in the mind streams of noble ones and the impure one, to sarpsira. The definition of the perfect nature is \"the true reality that is the primary object of the valid cognition of a reasoning consciousness.\" It is twofold-the unmistaken perfect nature corresponds to the meditative equipoises in the mind streams of noble ones and the unchanging one, to the nature of phenomena. In brief, the three natures are contained in the two realities because the perfect nature is presented as ultimate reality and the other-dependent and imaginary natures, as seeming reality in terms of being and not being able, respectively, to perform a func­tion. The three natures are presented as being definitely three in terms of their objects because they are respectively presented in terms of the objects of the minds of ordinary beings, the sub­sequent attainments of noble ones, and the meditative equipoises of the latter. Their order is as given in Mahayanasutrdlal'flkdra XVIII.80ab (\"For the sake of fully knowing, relinquishing, and directly perceiving ... \"). The three natures bear their names because they respectively are mere conceptual superimpositions, are dependent on other causes and conditions, and are perfect as the basic nature of objects. Their scriptural source in the prajftaparamita siitras is the Maitreya Chapter in the siitra in twenty-five thousand lines, which speaks of imaginary form, conceived form, and the form of the nature of phenomena. MCG (fol. 77a.5-77b.2) explains that imagi­nary form means that form and so on are incomplete as the fo undation of qualities, which refers to the perception of form by ordinary beings. That is, no matter how much they focus on forms as being forms by way of clinging to these forms while they are appearing in a dualistic manner, the qualities of the path are not produced. The form of the nature of phenomena is the perfect nature empty of a real other-dependent nature, which refers to the subsequent attainments of noble ones. If they focus on this form that is specified by Jacking a nature of its own, they see it as illusionlike and therefore the qualities of the path are produced in a complete manner. SCG (fol. 69b.2-5) quotes the Aloka (p. 47): \"Imaginary form consists of the imputations in the man­ner of apprehender and apprehended. Since conceived form is false imagination, it is this very cognition that appears like [apprehender and apprehended]. As for the form of the nature of phenomena, in true reality form itself is perfect as the nature of emptiness. Feelings and so on"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"Notes 751 are to be described in the same way.\" Thus, the first one is labeled as the emptiness of charac­teristics and the last one possesses the collection of qualities and represents the true nature of phenomena. Therefore, they are incomplete and complete, respectively. MPZL (p. 98) says that, though there appear many ways of explaining the meaning of \"incomplete and complete\" (such as referring to imaginary form and perfect form, or the forms of children and old people), the prajiiapiramiti siitra in twenty-five thousand lines generally speaks of the above-mentioned three kinds of form. As for their meanings, the intention of the AA is that imaginary form refers to form being permanent and so on as imputed by the tirthikas, which are not the distinctive features of form. Conceived form and the form of the nature of phenomena are discussed in the AA by way of the trainings that stop engaging in clinging to the common and uncommon characteristics, respectively, of form and so on. 504 Note that \"smaller and larger Brhaffikii\" refers to the number of prajftapiramiti siitras on which 03807 and 03808 respectively comment, but not to the size of these texts (in fact, 03807 is twice as long as 03808). 505 03795, fol. 266a.1-2. 506 PGSO (pp. 191-92) defines the explicitly taught trainings in the knowledge of entities as \"the practices of familiarizing with either of the two types of identitylessness.\" The defini­tion of the mahayana trainings in the knowledge of entities is \"the yogas of bodhisattvas that are cultivated by way of respectively stopping the clinging to real existence with regard to ten objects, such as form.\" The first four among these ten trainings are called \"the natural trainings\" because they exist in an ongoing manner from the path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum. The remaining six are \"the temporary trainings\" because they are only cultivated if their respectively corresponding flaws arise, but need not be cultivated if these flaws do not arise. The definition of the implicitly taught hinayana trainings in the knowledge of entities is \"the hinayana practices of familiarizing with entities as being without a personal identity.\" They consist of the four hinayana paths of learning. 507 cz. p. 305. 508 03807, vol. pa, fol. 55b.2-4. 509 03808, fol. 202b.2. 510 03791, fol. 172a.3-4. 511 LSSP/PSO have rgyu mtshan (\"cause\"), but the Alokii has mtshan ma (\"characteristics\"), both being translations of Skt. nimitta, which has both these meanings. However, the context in all commentaries clearly suggests that the latter is meant here. 512 PGSO (fol. 192) defines the equality of the trainings in the knowledge of entities as \"the yoga of bodhisattvas of familiarizing with the trainings (the subject) and the objects of these trainings as being equality in that they lack real existence.\" This equality is fourfold in terms of training in stopping clinging to real existence with regard to the nature of form and so on, its distinctive features, the elaborations of its divisions, and the trainings themselves as the cogniz­ing subjects. 513 cz. p. 457. 514 03787, fol. 118b.4-6. 515 PGSO (p. 194) says that, in the context of the knowledge of entities, there is a reason for explicitly teaching the mahayana path of seeing of directly and newly realizing personal identitylessness because bodhisattvas must directly realize personal identitylessness in order to take care of those to be guided who have the sravaka disposition. There is also a reason for not explicitly teaching the mahayana path of familiarization of familiarizing with the personal"},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"752 Groundless Paths identitylessness that was realized already because noble bodhisattvas do not strive for the frui­tions of the hinayana, such as the relinquishment of the clinging to a personal identity. SZB (pp. 318-19) says that the reason for not teaching the mahayana path of familiarization here is not because bodhisattvas do not familiarize with the already seen types of realization of §rivakas and pratyekabuddhas. Rather, they do not familiarize with the limited types of realization of §ravakas and pratyekabuddhas in the first place, but only with the uncommon types of realiza­tion of the mahayana knowledge of entities, which is free from the thirty-two superimpositions and is understood implicitly by virtue of the knowledge of the path. In general, the realization of all entities lacking a personal identity is only divided into three (the types of realization of noble §ravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas) by virtue of the manner of realizing the knowledge of entities being complete or incomplete, but not by virtue of the knowledge of the path being complete or incomplete because the knowledge of the path does not exist at all in §ravakas and pratyekabuddhas. 516 This and the following two quotes are found on pp. 309-10 in CZ. 517 Except for a few words here and there, the following three paragraphs, which summarize and further explain the meaning of the above three quotes, are not found in LSSP. However, each of these paragraphs in PSD is in quotation marks, so that they cannot be considered as Patrul Rinpoche's own explanations either. 518 cz, pp. 312-17. 519 PGSD (pp. 200-203) says that bodhisattvas need to know all phenomena through study­ing and reflecting because they must practice them in the manner of their lacking real existence. Thus, the definition of the aspects of the complete training in all aspects is \"the phenomena with which bodhisattvas familiarize as lacking real existence.\" These aspects consist of (1) the refer­ent aspects and (2) the cognitive aspects. (1) The definition of referent aspects is \"the aspects to be familiarized with that are the objects to be realized by the cognitive aspects.\" Their instances consist of all phenomena and they are divided into the referent aspects of the three knowledges. (2) The definition of cognitive aspects is \"the aspects to be familiarized with that are the aware­nesses which apprehend their specific referent aspects.\" Their instances consist of all cognitions and they are divided into (a) the cognitive aspects that are antagonistic factors and (b) those that are remedies. (a) The definition of the first is \"the cognitive aspects that are to be absolutely rejected by persons who strive for liberation.\" Their instances correspond to the clinging to a personal identity and the clinging to a phenomenal identity. (b) The definition of remedial cognitive aspects is \"the cognitive aspects that are to be relied on in the mind streams of persons who strive for liberation.\" Their instances consist of all paths to liberation and they are divided into the aspects of the three knowledges. As for the manner of familiarizing with these aspects, to ascertain that all phenomena lack real existence and then to properly familiarize with this actuality represent the progressive stages of familiarizati on in terms of mentally engaging in the topic of the essence (emptiness). To practice the clear realizations (the subjects) and emptiness (the object) by way of their being a unity represents the progressive stages of familiarization in terms of mentally engaging in the topic of the clear realizations. These two are not mutually exclusive because a single mental state is able to simultaneously practice both the subject (a clear realization) and the object (emptiness). The manner of familiarizing with the aspects is fourfold. The familiarization by way of the aspect of the nature, just as it is, refers to familiarizing by way of generating the phenomena to be familiarized with from the perspective of the mental states that familiarize with them (for example, the cultivation of the four foundations of mindfulness on the path of accumulation). The familiarization by way of the aspect of approximate concor­dance refers to familiarizing with the focal objects and aspects that are approximately concordant with the actual ones to be familiarized with (for example, mentally engaging in the focal objects and aspects of the path of preparation on the path of accumulation). The familiarization by"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"Notes 753 way of the aspect of approximately engaging in characteristics refers to approximately engag­ing in the characteristics of higher factors to be attained (for example, mentally engaging in the general and specific characteristics of the paths of noble ones on the path of accumulation). The familiarization by way of the aspect of aspiration refers to mentally engaging through the motivation of wishing to attain a special fruition (for example, familiarizing with the knowledge of all aspects on the path of accumulation). It may be said that it is not justified to familiarize with the knowledge of all aspects on the path of accumulation because said knowledge does not exist on that path. However, there is no flaw because though there is no familiarization with this knowledge in terms of its nature, just as it is, on said path, this path does possess the familiariza­tions with the knowledge of all aspects by way of the aspects of approximate concordance and aspiration. As for the aspects that are explicitly taught in the brief introductions and the detailed explanations in both the siitras and the AA, they are necessarily cognitive aspects. For AA IV.1 speaks of \"aspects\" as the specific instances of wisdom and Haribhadra's Alokii (03791, fol. 176a.3-4) and Vivrti (03793, fol. 104b.3-4) define them as the remedies for antagonistic factors. Thus, also the detailed explanations must explicate just this. In brief. the aspects that are taught here are twofold-the three knowledges (the subjects) and the four realities (the objects). The first represent the cognitive aspects that are the primary ones to be taught explicitly, while the second represent the referent aspects that are taught in an implicit manner. Thus, the mahayana path of seeing represents a remedial cognitive aspect because it is the wisdom that, by way of directly realizing the basic nature of the four realities, functions as the remedy for the antago­nistic factors to be relinquished. MCG (fols. 81b.3-82a.2 and 89b.S-90a.1) says that \"aspects\" refers to cultivating. in the manner of prajda and means being in union, the 173 wisdoms that are the remedies for mistaken superimpositions onto the phenomena of entities, the path, and all aspects. However, there is no need for any disputes about cognitive aspects and referent aspects because both are just divisions in terms of isolates. In general, \"referent aspects\" are the aspects of the objects and \"cognitive aspects,\" the modes of apprehension of their subjects. Therefore, ultimately, they exist in an inseparable manner. However, in terms of classifying all aspects in terms of the three knowledges from the perspective of subject and object, the aspects of the knowledge of entities and the knowledge of the path are taught from the point of view of being referent aspects and the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects, from the point of view of being cognitive aspects. Though these 173 aspects of the three knowledges are all nothing but prajdiipiiramitii, which overcomes the antagonistic factor of clinging to characteristics and is free from the triad of arising. abiding. and ceasing. in terms of the manner of cultivating them they are for the sake of realizing the threefold nonarising (of the three knowledges) and also apply to all four trainings. Therefore, they are cultivated successively in one swoop. The reason for this is that they do not consist of just a part of the vast number of all aspects of the path, but represent their entirety without any incompleteness. For though they are all of one taste in being emptiness, the vast means of the path need to be complete too (such as the need for generating bodhicitta). To cultivate the complete training in all aspects on the path of accumulation repre­sents the remedy that invalidates the factors to be relinquished through seeing; the culminating training of the path of preparation, a part of the remedy that relinquishes said factors; and the serial training, their distancing remedy. SZB (pp. 331-32) says that the explicit statements in the siitras mostly teach the referent aspects in an explicit manner and the cognitive aspects as the hidden meaning. The explicit statements in the AA, when dividing the aspects in terms of the three knowledges (as in IV.1), teach the cognitive aspects explicitly and the referent aspects merely implicitly. 520 PGSO (pp. 201 and 203-4) defines the aspects of the knowledge of entities as \"the wisdoms of directly realizing the basic nature of the four realities as being personal identity­lessness.\" As for the three paths described above, the definition of the uncontaminated path that serves as the remedy for the afflictive obscurations is \"the type of hinayana realization that"},{"pageNumber":755,"pageContent":"754 Groundless Paths consists of the meditative equipoises of directly realizing personal identitylessness and possesses the power to relinquish the afflictive obscurations.\" It is twofold in terms of existing in the mind streams of the followers of the hinayana and the mahayana, respectively. The definition of the contaminated path that serves as the remedy for the cognitive obscuration& which are the con­ceptions about the apprehended is \"the type of pratyekabuddha realization that consists of the subsequent attainments of their path of familiarization and possesses the power to relinquish the cognitive obscurations that are the conceptions about the apprehended.\" The definition of the uncontaminated path that serves as the remedy for the cognitive obscuration& which are the conceptions about the apprehended is \"the type of pratyekabuddha realization that consists of the meditative equipoises of realizing phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended and possesses the power to relinquish the cognitive obscuration& that are the conceptions about the apprehended.\" These two are twofold each in terms of existing in the mind streams of pra­tyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas, respectively. Among these three paths, the first one and the last one are called \"uncontaminated\" because they consist of meditative equipoises, while the second one is called \"contaminated\" because it consists of subsequent attainments. 521 This could also be read as \"naturally empty,\" but both PSD and LSSP gloss it as ngo bos stong pa below, which suggests the above meaning. 522 In the following, the four aspects of each of the four realities as the factors to be relin-quished by the knowledge of the path are in italics. 523 After \"final deliverance,\" PSD has gyis, but LSSP has ni. 524 These refer to the last four of the twenty emptinesses in the prajiiapiramiti siitras-the emptinesses of entities, nonentities, self-entity, and other-entity. According to some, these four are just branches of the sixteenth emptiness (the emptiness of the nature of nonentities), while others say that they summarize all preceding sixteen emptinesses. 525 PGSD (p. 201) defines the aspects of the knowledge of the path as \"the knowledge of mahayana noble ones of directly realizing the basic nature of the four realities as being phenom­enal identitylessness. n 526 PGSD (pp. 204-5) defines the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects as \"the wisdoms of the final direct realization of the basic nature of the four realities.\" These aspects are two­fold-(1) common and (2) uncommon. (1) The definition of the common aspects is \"the final wisdoms that exist in the mind streams of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas in a sim­ilar type.\" These common aspects are twofold-(a) those that are approximately concordant with the knowledge of the path that represents their cause and (b) those that are approximately concordant with the knowledge of entities that represents their antagonistic factors. (a) The definition of the first one is \"the final wisdoms that exist in the mind streams of noble bodhi­sattvas in a similar type.\" (b) The definition of the second one is \"the final wisdoms that exist in the mind streams of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas in a similar type.\" (a) and (b) are not mutually exclusive because the foundations of mindfulness of the buddhabhiimi belong to both. They are not completely equivalent either because the generation of bodhicitta on the buddhabhiimi belongs to the first set but not to the second one, whereas the path of nonlearning that is the buddhabhiimi belongs to the second one but not to the first one. (2) The definition of the uncommon aspects of the knowledge of all aspects is \"the final wisdoms that do not exist in the mind streams of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas in a similar type.\" In the AA, the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects that exist in the mind streams of buddhas are taught explicitly, while those in the mind streams of lower noble ones are taught implicitly. 527 These are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four correct efforts, and the four limbs of miraculous powers."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"528 VI.67d-68ac. 529 04090, vol. khu, fol. 38b.7. 530 VI.67ac. 531 This can also be understood as \"purifying samadhi.\" 532 IV.l. 533 04090, vol. khu, fol. 12a.5-12b.3. Notes 755 534 PGSO (pp. 205-7) defines the foundations of mindfulness as \"the mindfulness in the mind streams of persons who have entered the path that is congruently associated with prajiia and, through focusing on either one of its four objects (body, feelings, mind, and phenomena), analyzes them by superimposing the aspects that are their general and specific characteristics.\" The body refers to entities that possess form; feelings, to the five collections of feelings (physical pleasure and discomfort, mental pleasure and discomfort, and indifference); mind, to the eight collections of consciousness; and phenomena, to a1Hicted and purified phenomena. The four foundations are presented as the four remedies that overcome the four mistakennesses of super­imposing the body as the support of the self; feelings as the experiences of the self; mind as the nature of the self; and phenomena as the distincive features of the self. They are called \"foun­dations of mindfulness\" because prajiia becomes founded through the power of mindfulness. They exist from the path of accumulation up through the buddhabhtimi. The primary factor of the foundations of mindfulness is prajii.a and the minds and mental factors that are congruently associated with it represent its aids. As for the manner of cultivating these foundations, accord­ing to the hinayana the specific characteristics of the body and so on are as above in PSO. Their general characteristic is personal identitylessness. According to the mahayana one meditates by understanding that the body appears while being without any nature, just like an illusion; that feelings appear, but are not established in the way they appear, just like dreams; that the mind is naturally luminous, just like space; and that phenomena-mind's stains such as attachment­are adventitious, just like clouds. The fruitions are to attain the uncontaminated body, feelings, mind, and phenomena through relinquishing the four mistaken notions of the body being pure, feelings being happiness, mind being permanent, and phenomena having an identity. 535 This explanation is based on translating Skt. praha�;�a, which can mean either \"relinquish­ment\" or \"effort,\" as the former in Tibetan (spong ba). However, the term samyakpraha�;�a (Tib. yang dag spong ba) clearly refers to four activities in which one exerts effort. 536 04090, vol. khu, fol. 39a.2. PGSO (pp. 207-8) defines the four correct efforts as \"the vigor, together with its congruently associated factors, of being able to properly adopt virtue and discard nonvirtue, which is included in the medium path of accumulation in the systems of the respective yanas and above.\" Thus, they exist from the medium path of accumulation up through the buddhabhtimi. Their aids are the minds and mental factors that are congruently associated with said vigor. Their fruition is the deterioration of antagonistic factors and the increase of remedies, thus attaining the final relinquishment and realization. 537 IV.3cd. 538 IV.4. 539 IV.Scd-6ab. 540 04090, vol. khu, fol. 39a.2-3. 541 03808, fol. 127b.3-4. 542 PGSO (pp. 208-9) explains that the objects of the limbs of miraculous powers consist of the special qualities that are the six supernatural knowledges, the five visions, the ten powers,"},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"756 Groundless Paths and so on.

Their aids are the minds and men­tal factors that are congruently associated with said confidence and so on. As for the manner of cultivating them, through confidence one focuses on the four realities and familiarizes with them in the manner of having trust in them; through vigor, in the manner of delighting in them; through mindfulness, in the manner of not fo rgetting their focal objects and aspects; through samadhi, in the manner of abiding one-pointedly in them; and through prajiiii., in the manner of discriminating them.

According to Mahiiyiinasutriila'!'lkara XVIII.81, in due order, the focal objects of said three samadhis are the identitylessness of all phenomena, the fact of nirvil}.a being peace, and the facts of everything conditioned being impermanent and everything contaminated being suffering. According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya (04049, fol. 102b.4-5), the respective aspects of said three samadhis are to realize the above-mentioned respective aspects of the four realities. As for the definite number of said three samadhis, they are three in terms of their factors to be relinquished because they are presented in terms of respectively overcoming the nature of the clinging to an identity, its cause-the conceptions of mentally engaging in an improper manner, and its result-the wishing for the three realms as something to be adopted.

As for the boundary lines, the understanding of the three doors to liberation refers to what has the nature of the triad of studying, reflecting, and meditating. Their being described by the term \"samiidhi\" is presented in terms of both the mundane and supramundane prajiiiis that arise from meditation. The samiidhi of emptiness exists only in the mind streams of noble ones. In brief, the path of the remedies consists of the samiidhis of the three doors to liberation because it represents the wisdom of overcoming the nature, cause, and result of the views about an identity. 557 04035, fol. 140b.4-5. 558 LSSP (vol. 2, fol. 30b.1) glosses this as looking at oneself with the notion of the four names (that is, the fo ur mental skandhas other than fo rm) or the notion of space because any notion of fo rm has been destroyed. 559 04035, fol. 140b.6 (this is the first and main part of the Yogiicarabhumi, with the other fo ur being the Viniscayasa'!'lgrahaP;Ji, Va stusa'!'lgrahaP;Ji, Paryayasa'!'lgrahaP;Ji, and VivaraP;Jasa'!'lgrahaP;Ji). 560 PGSD (pp. 215-17) defines the path of manifesting as \"the liberations of producing vari­ous emanations for the welfare of others, which rely on the states of mind of the actual dhyiinas as their dominant conditions.\" The definition of the liberation of what has form looking at form is \"the liberation that is the subdivision of the three liberations with form of being able to, by way of the emanators themselves entailing appearance from the perspective of others and rely­ing on the states of mind of the actual dhyiinas as its dominant conditions, look at outer fo rms as all kinds of things.\" It is twofold in terms of existing in the mind streams of followers of the hinayiina or the mahayana. The definition of the liberation of what is without form looking at fo rm is \"the liberation that is the subdivision of the three liberations with form of being able to, through being preceded by yogins settling into the notion of themselves being without form and relying on the states of mind of the actual dhyiinas as its dominant conditions, look at outer fo rms as all kinds of things.\" It is twofold-the liberation of being able to destroy any notion of form by virtue of having attained a state of mind of the fo rmless realms and the liberation of merely settling into the notion of being without fo rm by virtue of not having attained such a state of mind. The definition of the liberation of specific notions of beauty is \"the liberation that is the subdivision of the three liberations with form of being able to, through relying on the states of mind of the actual dhyiinas as its dominant conditions, look at all forms as having the aspect of being pleasant.\" It is twofold in terms of existing in the mind streams of followers of the hinayiina or the mahayana. The persons who cultivate these liberations must be persons who wish to see newly what did not exist in the above-mentioned ways before because such seeing must arise primarily through the power of scriptures. As for the grounds of samiidhi on which these liberations rely, according to Abhidharmakosa VIII.32ac, in due order, said three libera­tions rely on the first, second, and fourth dhyiinas. According to the Abhidharmasamuccaya, all three rely on the culmination of the fourth dhyiina. Said being based on the actual dhyiinas applies only to the new arising of said liberations, but it is not definite for sustaining those that have already arisen. As for the manner of looking, during the first liberation, by way of the look­ers entailing appearance, they look at a single form in various ways as being small, big, good, bad, beautiful, and ugly. During the second liberation, if one has attained a state of mind of the formless realms, it is through relying on that state of mind that one first destroys any notion of form. Thereafter, through relying on the state of mind of an actual dhyana, one looks at forms as above. If one has not attained a state of mind of the fo rmless realms, one first settles into the notion of being without form and then continues as above. The technique during the third liberation is as described in PSD above, and its purpose is to realize that beautiful and ugly are not established through any nature of their own, but are merely mental superimpositions. The"},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"Notes 759 general purpose of the first three liberations lies in knowing how to be able to emanate all kinds of emanations for the welfare of others. In due order, their specific purposes are to emanate all kinds of displays of miraculous powers by way of the emanator entailing appearance, emanate all kinds of such displays by way of the emanator not appearing, and to relinquish the afflictions of wishing to emanate beautiful forms and not wishing to emanate ugly ones. 561 04038, fol. 37a.3. 562 The meditative absorption without discrimination is the highest one within the fourth dhyana and, when performed for a long time, leads to rebirth in the highest level of the gods of the form realm. It entails the temporary cessation of primary minds and mental factors with an unstable continuum-the five sense consciousnesses, the mental consciousness, and their accompanying mental factors (but not the afflicted mind and the alaya-consciousness). However, the latent tendencies for the arising of these consciousnesses are not eliminated. Thus, mistaken appearances will occur again once one rises from this meditative absorption. 563 Compare the six \"states without mind\" below. 564 On this, see Mahayanasa,graha 1.50-52. 565 Verse 16. In general, as presented in the Yogacarabhumi (04035, fols. 160b.5-161a.2), there is a list of six \"states without mind\" (Skt. acittikibhfimi, Tib. sems med pa'i sa). These consist of (1) sleep, (2) fainting, (3) the meditative absorption of cessation, (4) the meditative absorption without discrimination, (5) the state of a god without discrimination (the result of (4), which is rebirth on the highest level of the fourth dhyana of the form realm), and (6) the expanse of the nirvil}.a without remainder (which is what \"the state without mind\" in line 16d refers to). Among these, during the first five only the first six or seven primary minds and their mental factors cease temporarily, but not the al.aya-consciousness. The expanse of the nirvil}.a without remainder is said to be the ultimate state without mind because the alaya-consciousness has ceased too. 566 04038, fol. 73a.3-4. 567 03903, fol. 166b.3. 568 This power is more often explained as knowing the various mental constitutions of sen­tient beings. 569 In the cosmolgy of the Vedic Upanishads, the entire creation is seen as a continuously rotating wheel, from whose hub or navel all illusory existence within this creation process spins forth. The hub represents Brahma as the creator of illusion and the wheel, his illusory creations. The Buddha's turning of the wheel of dharma is compared to this wheel of Brahma because it, just like the latter, rolls from one being to another, thus touching all beings. 570 This and the following three quotes are found in D9, vol. ka, fols. 243b.3-244a.6 (in the siitra, the phrasing of the last quote differs somewhat and is shorter). 571 These are traditional Indian synonyms for the moon (in India, the patterns on the moon that are seen as \"the man in the moon\" in the West appear like a rabbit). 572 During standing, walking, sitting, and lying, buddhas are completely free from any flaws in their physical, verbal, and mental conduct, whereas even arhats may sometimes bump into something or step on a snake. Some are reported to have yelled after women, guffawing with laughter. Udayin still had some attachment and preferred to teach dharma in the neighbor­hood brothel. Nanda used to stare at the women in the audience when giving a dharma talk. High-caste Mahakasyapa could not rid himself of habitual snobbery and-despite his renown for ascetism-could not help jigging to a tune because of his former lives spent as a monkey.

Madhuvasi4tha-another ex-monkey-could not resist climbing walls and trees. There are also stories about a pratyekabuddha-who had been a courtesan in past lives-still dress­ing like a coquette. As for being in constant meditative equipoise, even bodhisattvas on the ten bhiimis rise from their samiidhis between their meditation sessions. 573 MCG (fols. 88b.7-89a.3) glosses self-arisen wisdom as the luminous dharmadhiitu wis­dom. Through having familiarized on the path with the nonconceptual wisdom that is not conditioned by causes and conditions, and having done so in the manner of not adding anything to, or removing anything from, it, at the time of one's last existence the spontaneously present wisdom that does not depend on anything else is manifested. SCG (fol. 100b.6) says that, in terms of the above two types of what is self-arisen, the dharmadhiitu is self-arisen because it is not produced by causes and conditions and serves as the cause of nonconceptual wisdom. 574 MCG (fol. 89a.4-89b.5) summarizes all 173 aspects as follows. The twenty-seven aspects of the knowledge of entities that exist in the mind streams of sriivakas are uncontaminated by virtue of relinquishing the a1flictions like a poisoned arrow because they are aspects to be familiarized with during meditative equipoise. The knowledge of entities that exists in the mind streams of bodhisattvas is contaminated because it consists of aspects that are to be known for the welfare of others during subsequent attainment (this is presented in terms of assert­ing the subsequent attainment to be contaminated). The thirty-six aspects of the knowledge of the path of bodhisattvas are contaminated because it is taught that they do not relinquish the a1flictions since they are beneficial for perfect enlightenment, just as manure is for a field. The 110 aspects of the knowledge of all aspects are nothing but uncontaminated because the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies, have been relinquished. As for the divisions of these 173 aspects in terms of entities, path, and aspects. it is taught that, ultimately, one needs to familiarize with all dharmas of ground, path, and fruition in a combined manner, which is done by way of mentally engaging in the dharmas of the fruition through aspiring for them. During meditative equipoise, one solely familiarizes with all these dharmas in the manner of the familiarizing mind bearing the cognitive aspect of their being unobservable. During subse­quent attainment, one solely familiarizes with them by way of the cognitive aspects of knowing and accomplishing the aspects that are the respective natures, causes, functions, and so on of said dharmas without mixing them. According to MPZL (p. 111), in terms of its nature, the familiarization with all 173 aspects of the complete training in all aspects as the single aspect of lacking arising. which occurs through meditative equipoise (the samiidhi without appearances), is asserted to be uncontaminated. The complete familiarization with each one of them individu­ally, which occurs through subsequent attainment (the samiidhi with appearances), is asserted to be nominally contaminated. Though there is no diffence between these two assertions, there are divisions in terms of the mere types of realization in the mind streams of noble ones that are subsumed under these two categories being contaminated versus uncontaminated (which are to be known from other sources). SZB (p. 331) says that the first sixteen aspects of the knowledge of entities, which exist in the mind streams of sriivakas, are uncontaminated. The next five aspects, which exist in the mind streams of pratyekabuddhas, are contaminated because they exist during the subsequent attainment of their path of familiarization. The last six aspects are presented as the uncontaminated path of seeing of pratyekabuddhas. All the aspects in the mind streams of buddhas are uncontaminated. For this, compare PBG on IV.2. 575 This and the following three quotes are found on p. 318 in CZ. 576 PGSD (p. 218) defines the persons who cultivate the culminating training as \"the children of the victors who engage in prajftiipiiramitii through either studying. reflecting. or meditating.\" \"To retain prajftiipiiramitii\" is glossed as \"not forgetting the meaning of the words\" and \"to mentally engage in a proper manner,\" as \"through what arises from meditation.\" 577 03791, fols. 184b.7-185a.2."},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"Notes 761 578 PGSD (pp. 218-19) defines the trainings of the complete training in all aspects as \"the yogas of bodhisattvas that exist as the types [of training] which are endowed with both special means and prajiia.\" They are twofold-(a) the five natural trainings and (b) the fifteen situational trainings.

As for cultivating the trainings through alternating meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment and the manner in which these trainings exist in both, the A vikalpapraveiadhi1rat;�i says that, through meditative equipoise, all phenomena are seen to be equal to the middle of space and, through subsequent attainment, they are seen to be illusionlike. Accordingly, to mentally engage in the topic of the essence (emptiness) is to familiarize, through the meditative equipoise of the vajralike samadhi and in the manner of the nonabiding and the nontraining that are specified by the two realities being inseparable and the nonnominal ultimate, with said 173 aspects as their having the nature of the spacelike lack of arising without the elaborations of each individual aspect. This is the manner of realization through the wisdom of meditative equipoise. To mentally engage in the topic of the clear real­izations is to familiarize, through the subsequent attainment that is the illusionlike samadhi and in the manner of the nonabiding and the non training that are specified by the nominal ultimate, with these 173 aspects, without mixing them, as their having the nature of illusionlike appear­ance. This is the manner of realization through the wisdom that has the nature of subsequent attainment. It appears that it is difficult for those with limited minds who do not realize in this manner to know the profound intended meaning of prajiiaparamita. They may say, \"If, during subsequent attainment, through prajiia, there is the familiarization in the manner of ultimately not abiding and not training, while it is associated with appearances of seeming reality (the means), it follows that the seeing of the two realities together exists on the paths of training.\" This may appear as if it is a very sharp path of dialectic reasoning, but it is just a sign of not understanding the essential point. How could an earlier and later ultimate be possible anyway? Therefore, please rely on the meaning of the distinctive fe atures of the ultimate, the presenta­tion of the two realities, the divisions of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, and so on according to the systems of the great system fo unders. Otherwise, when explaining the subsequent attainment that consists of the supramundane paramitas, the six paramitas that are each endowed with four dharmas, the purifications of the bhiimis with their special means and prajiia, and so on that are described in the great mahayana siitras and treatises, without knowing the profound and secret essential point of the wisdom of the subsequent attainment of noble ones, one must still know how to present the distinctive features of the practice of marvelous means and prajiia from the point of view of subsequent attainment's own nature. However, to hold that it is only after a preceding subsequent attainment that this subsequent attainment is finally sealed by a meditative equipoise that apprehends emptiness is nothing but a cause for"},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"762 Groundless Paths laughter. The samadhi of subsequent attainment with appearances, no matter how much it may be demonstrated, just like an arrow shot into space, is devoid of any means to realize even the mere fact of in which direction it exists. It just comes down to what Candrakirti explained in his Madhyamakdvatarabh�ya (03862, fol. 230b.1-3) in detail, quoting the prajiiiparamita slitras as saying that, when the paramita of generosity has become free from the focal objects of some­thing to give, a recipient, and a giver, it is the supramundane paramiti. However, those who have not attained the state of bodhisattvas are not able to understand this. 579 cz. p. 328. 580 PGSD (p. 220) defines the qualities of the mahayana trainings as \"the excellent virtues that are attained through the power of having cultivated their specific causes-the mahayana train­ings-in exact accord with their nature.\" In terms of their boundary lines, they are twofold-the temporary qualities of relinquishment and realization of bodhisattvas and the ultimate ones of buddhas. In terms of the fruitions, they are fourteenfold as in PSD above. They exist from the second moment of the path of accumulation up through buddhahood. 581 It is a mystery to me how the flaws listed up to here are supposed to add up to a total of thirty (the same goes fo r the place below where LSSP/PSD speak of the fourth set of ten being complete). Moreover, even if one were to accept the number of flaws up to here as thirty and the following indication of their reaching forty, the entire list in LSSP/PSD would only contain forty-three flaws. Thus, I numbered the flaws simply according to their numerical order (which, for the most part, is consistent with the order in the slitras and CZ. 582 The latter phrase follows what the slitras say. LSSP/PSD have nyan pa po phyi bzhin rjes su 'brang 'dod, which is not clear to me, but might mean \"the listener being too late ... \" 583 XXVII.3. Note that the above numbering and grouping of the forty-six flaws differ, at times greatly, from the slitras and other commentaries. PGSD (pp. 220-21) defines these flaws as \"the activities of miras that obstruct the cultivation of the mahayana trainings\" and divides them simply into two-(1) the twenty-three of adverse conditions being close and (2) the twenty-three of the favorable conditions not being complete. Their boundary lines are that they exist from not having entered the path up through the seventh bhlimi. MCG (fols. 94a.3-96b.4) and MPZL (pp. 117-20) also agree that all forty-six flaws are the activities of miras. MCG divides the flaws into (1) the twenty adverse conditions that exist in oneself, (2) the twenty-three cases of favorable conditions not being complete that depend on either oneself or others, and (3) the three adverse conditions that depend on others. (1) is further subdivided (1) into (a) the two flaws in terms of self-confidence, (b) the three in terms of the impregnations of negative ten­dencies, (c) the seven of falling away from the mahayana, and (d) the eight of being distracted from the mahayana. (2) consists of (a) the fourteen of the one who listens being mentioned first and the one who explains, second, (b) the two that depend on oneself alone, and (c) the seven that can apply to either. MPZL agrees with MCG's threefold main division, except for calling (2) the twenty-three adverse conditions that depend on either oneself or others. (1) is subdivided into three. (a) are the five flaws of lacking respect for prajnapiramiti (correspond­ing to MCG's (1a) and (1b)). (b) and (c) are the same as MCG's (1c) and (1d), respectively. (2) is subdivided as in MCG. Thus, the order of the first twenty flaws in PSD, MCG, and MPZL is identical. Thereafter, PSD (21)-(23) correspond to MCG/MPZL (44)-(46); PSD (24)-(37), to MCG/MPZL (21)-(34); PSD (38)-(44), to MCG/MPZL (37)-(43); and PSD (45)-(46), to MCG/ MPZL (35)-(36). For the listing of these flaws, see also JNS (which agrees with MCG), and CZ (pp. 332-43). As for the remedies that eliminate said flaws, according to PGSD (p. 221), they consist of the following four causes-(1) the prajiia of realizing emptiness, (2) being skilled in the means that mature sentient beings, (3) training in practicing in exact accordance with what the buddhas say, and (4) the power of the blessings of the buddhas. MCG (fol. 96b.4-5) replaces"},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"Notes 763 (2) by \"the compassion of not abandoning sentient beings\" and says that (1)-(3) represent the inner conditions, while (4) is the outer condition. 584 This seems to refer to Skt. vayasa, which can mean both \"crow\" and \"house facing north­east.\" Both the Vrtti (03787, fol. 175b.S) and the Alokd (03791, fol. 305b.7) use this Sanskrit word in its two meanings \"crow\" and \"milk sweets/soup\" (an English example would be \"pen,\" signifying both a writing instrument and a corral). 585 A simple example for an exclusion of nonpossession (Tib. mi ldan rnam gcod) would be the statement \"Susan definitely is a good cook\" excluding that she does not possess the feature of being a good cook. 586 An example for an exclusion of possession by others (Tib. gzhan ldan rnam gcod) would be \"Only Susan is a good cook\" excluding that others too possess the feature of being a good cook. 587 As for the defining characteristic of knowledge, MCG (fols. 97a.4-98a.4) says that, in general, there is no difference between the three knowledges knowing all their respective objects to be equal in that they lack arising. However, the knowledge of entities, the knowledge of the path, and the knowledge of all aspects are respectively taught from the point of view of the iso­lates of seeing the realization of the suchness of entities (skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas), the path, and all aspects as lacking arising. Therefore, in due order, said three knowledges teach the manners of knowing the phenomena that are entities, the phenomena that make up the path, and the fruition that is the level of nonlearning. Thus, it is by way of knowing these respective phenomena that the three knowledges are defined, just as the cognizing subject that perceives blue can be taught by way of speaking about its object blue. Likewise, the defining characteristic of activity is to be understood by way of said cognizing subject being defined through speaking about its function, just as a pillar is defined through its performing the function of supporting a beam. Similarly, the defining characteristic of distinctiveness is defined through the distinctive features of said subject being more eminent than other paths, just as impermanence is defined through the reverse of permanence. The defining characteristic that is the nature is what is defined (or a definiendum) because it represents the nature that is referred to by the other three defining characteristics. However, it is also a defining characteristic because it is established or known through the power of excluding what is other, or because it is something like a spe­cific meaning-isolate (another technical term for \"definition\"), such as a round belly and so on defining a vase. In the field of valid cognition, it is well known that a defining characteristic (or definition) is the meaning-isolate that sets up what is defined (or a definiendum), that is, it sets up a phenomenon as an object of conventional discourse (such as defining it as \"a vase\"). Thus, phenomena are set up or labeled as definienda by way of their natures (such as color, shape, or tangibility), qualities, or functions, as appropriate. Likewise, here the first three defining char­acteristics are taught by way of their respective objects indicating that the complete training in all aspects (the cognizing subject) is able to know these objects in the corresponding ways, is unlike others, and has certain functions, respectively. Just as when showing that it is the seed of a sprout that has the power to produce that sprout, one understands through said three defining characteristics that what is defined by them-the complete training in all aspects of the three knowledges-has the power of these defining characteristics. Therefore, the cause is defined here through its results. 588 MPZL (pp. 130-31) summarizes the fo ur defining characteristics by saying that the clear realizations of the complete training in all aspects, whose character consists of the sixteeen­fold defining characteristic that is their nature, represent the instances. The conventional term \"mahayana trainings\" represents the definiendum. To be endowed with the triad of knowledge, distinctiveness, and activity in terms of special means and prajfta represents the definition. Since these three are one in nature, but divided in terms of isolates, they are presented as the triad of"},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"764 Groundless Paths definition, definiendum, and instances. In particular, the instances of the knowledge of entities consist of its nature being endowed with four features (as in AA IV.29ab). They define it as being the profound training in the knowledge of entities, which possesses the defining characteristics of knowledge, distinctiveness, and activity in terms of the special means and prajftii that make up the knowledge of entities. The same applies to the definitions, definienda, and instances of the knowledge of all aspects and the knowledge of the path. 589 The fourteen extremes listed here represent the fourteen \"undecided\" (Skr. avyiikrta, Tib. lung du ma bstan pa) questions that the Buddha refused to settle one way or another. Upon being asked by Ananda about the reason for his silence later, the Buddha answered that such questions are just entirely baseless speculations, but not soteriologically relevant in the sense of being conducive to liberation from saipsiiric suffering. The Buddha's teachings are not interested in or concerned with the former, but only with the latter. For more details, see below. 590 03791, fol. 207b.5-7 and 03807, fol. 101a.2-6. 591 04035, fol. 70b.2-3. 592 03787, fol. 136a.2. 593 Here the underlying Sanskrit term for \"coming forth\" (unminjita; lit. \"opening one's eyes\") is rendered differently in Tibetan (below, it is also rendered as \"opening\"). AF. explained, in this context it means that the mind comes forth/opens up/moves by virtue of engaging certain objects in an affirmative manner. 594 03801, fol. 155a.4-6. 595 Note that here the text uses \"being closed\" not in the sense as explained so far, but simply as the counterpart of \"opening\" (which is a different term for \"coming forth\"). Thus, as the context makes clear and as explained below, here \"being closed\" does not refer to the third one among the four terms under discussion, but to the second one. 596 This refers to the Viitsiputriyas, who asserted the existence of an ultimately real person in this way. 597 04060, fol. 34b.5. 598 PGSO (pp. 221-25) defines what is undecided as \"the aftlicted prajftii of mistaken dis­crimination that is motivated by views about a self and whose questions, which result from it, cannot be answered.\" Undecided (or neutral; the Tibetan lung du ma bstan pa can mean both) does not mean to be so merely by virtue of representing a common locus of what is undecided and views because common loci with views may exist even in the mind streams of persons who realized identitylessness, but such common loci do not have to be what is undecided because said mind streams contain common loci of views and nonvirtue. AF. for the individual natures of the fourteen undecided views, (a) in the four views of the self and the world being permanent, impermanent, both, or neither, \"self' refers to a person and \"the world,\" to the five skandhas as the bases of designating such a self. The first one among these four views represents the view that the self and the skandhas of the last life exist in this life. The second one is the view that such is not the case. The third one is the view that, in terms of their nature, the self and the skandhas of this life exist from before, while on the temporary level they arise newly. The fourth one is the view that the self and the skandhas are inexpressible as either permanent or impermanent. (b) Among the four views that the self and the world have an end, do not have an end, both, or neither, the first one is the view that the skandhas of the next life do not arise in dependence on the skandhas of this life. The second one is the view that the self and the skandhas of this life will also exist in future lives. The third one is the view that the nature of the self and the skandhas of the next life is to be permament, while on the temporary level they are impermanent. The fourth one is the view that the self and the skandhas of future lives are inexpressible as either having"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"Notes 765 an end or not having an end. (c) Among the four views that tathagatas still manifest after hav­ing passed away, do not manifest, both, or neither, the first one is the view that sentient beings, after having died, still exist in a nonmanifest manner. The second one is the view that, once sentient beings have died, their continuum of similar type is severed. The third one is the view that, after having died, the nature of sentient beings is to be permament, while on the temporary level they are impermanent. The fourth one is the view that sentient beings are inexpressible as either arising or not arising as a self after they have died. Views (a1), (b2), and (cl) represent mainly the view of the Siipkhyas because they assert that the self of the last life exists in this one and that the self of this life exists in the next one. Their view is called \"coming forth\" because, according to it, the self and the skandhas of the last life come forth into this life and those of this life transit into the next life. Views (a2), (b1), and (c2) represent mainly the view of the Ayatas because they do not accept that this life arises in dependence on a former one and that the next one arises in dependence on this one. Their view is called \"being withdrawn\" because all suffering and happiness are withdrawn into this life. Views (a3), (b3), and (c3) represent mainly the view of the Nirgranthas because they assert that the nature of all phenomena is to be permanent, while on the temporary level they are impermanent. Since they assert that this is like being scattered, their view is called \"being scattered.\" Views (a4), (b4), and (c4) represent mainly the view of the Vitsiputriyas because they assert an inexpressible self. Their view is called \"being closed\" because they assert that the self and the skandhas are inexpressible as the same or different, permanent or impermanent, and so on. View ( d1) is the view of the Vaise�ikas because they assert that the life-force is the self and that the self possesses form. View (d2) is the view of the Simkhyas because they assert the self as being cognition. The views of \"coming forth\" and \"being scattered\" engage their objects through the aspect of affirmation because they are views about permanence that superimpose certain features onto their objects. The views of \"being withdrawn\" and \"being closed\" engage their objects through the aspect of negation because they are views about extinction that deny certain features of their objects. The reason why all these views are called \"undecided\" is that the answers by the Buddha, when questioned about them, did not decide on them one way or the other. His reason for not doing so is that he had in mind that all these questions are based on the notion of a self and that, even if he had refuted that self, it would not have been of benefit to the questioners. The reasons for these fo urteen views containing all sixty-two views of the tirthikas as described in the Brahmajalasutta (Digha NikiJya I.12-1.46; trans. in M. Walshe 1995, pp. 73-90; P1021, pp. 286.2.8ff.) are as follows. The topics in the questions about all of these views are twofold-the nature of a self and its dis­tinctive features. The two views under (d) that are based on the body and the life-force are in terms of cutting through doubts about the nature of a self. As for the distinctive features of that self, the four views under (a) are in terms of cutting through doubts about a starting point of afflicted phenomena; the four under (b), in terms of cutting through doubts about an end point of afflicted phenomena; and the four under (c), in terms of cutting through doubts about an end point of purified phenomena. The reason for said questioners not asking about situations in the present is that these are easy to understand. The reason for their not asking any questions in terms of cutting through doubts about a starting point of purified phenomena is that one is able to understand this through having cut through doubts about an end point of afflicted phe­nomena. In brief, the mahayana path of preparation of realizing the basic nature of \"coming forth; \"being withdrawn; and so on represents the defining characteristic of knowledge of the training in the knowledge of entities because it is the yoga of bodhisattvas of realizing the basic nature of entities. MCG's (fol. 99a.4-99b.6) presentation and division of the fourteen undecided views corresponds to PSD above, except for explicidy categorizing \"being scattered\" as entailing both negation and affirmation and \"being closed\" as negating both affirmation and negation (as described above, PSD categorizes them as just affirmation and negation, respectively). In due order, the reasons for the terms \"coming forth\" and so on are as follows. Since the view of the Siipkhyas is far out or a far extreme, it is like \"coming fo rth/moving.\" Since, in the view of the"},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"766 Groundless Paths Ayatas, there is nothing but this life, it is like \"being withdrawn.\" The view of the Nirgranthas is like \"being scattered\" between the two aspects of affirmation and negation. Since the hypocriti­cal view of the Vitsiputriyas is to not assert anything out of fear of making mistakes, it is like \"being closed.\" 599 04090, fol. 16a.3-4. 600 04049, fol. 92b.4. 601 VI.25a. 602 VI.25a. 603 04049, fol. 92b.3-4. 604 04090, fol. 226a.l-2. 605 03787, fol. 145a.l-2. 606 Ibid., fol. 145a.5. 607 03796, fol. 7la.5-6. 608 PGSO (pp. 225-26) divides the physical supports of the factors conducive to liberation into those in which they can arise through one's own power (according to Abhid}umnalcosa VI.25ab, humans on the three continents [i.e., except Uttarakuru)) and those in which they can arise through the power of others (all beings except for the gods without discrimination in the form realm and all in the formless realm). The mental supports can be a one-pointed mind of the desire realm or any of the six grounds of dhyana. Said factors cannot rely on states of mind of the formless realm because they must primarily arise due to the power of scriptures. The definition of the factors conducive to liberation is \"the clear realizations of the persons who have entered the path that arise before the arising of the path of preparation in the systems of the respective yanas.\" They are called that way because they represent the path that is partially con­cordant with nirvil}.a. The distinctive qualities of the path of accumulation consist of its basis (being endowed with pure ethics), its branches (controlling the sense gates with regard to attach­ment and so on as well as moderation in food), the feature of one's mind stream being matured (making efforts in the yogas of studying, and reflecting on, the Buddha's words in their twelve branches), the feature of its nature (its consisting of the roots of virtue of studying, reflecting, and meditating), and the feature of its function (swiftly accomplishing the direct realization of the actuality of the basic nature). As for the mahayana path of accumulation being classified in terms of faculties (AA IV.34cd), unsurpassable enlightenment is easy to be realized by those with sharp faculties because it is difficult for them to revert from their course toward enlighten­ment. However, this does not mean that their having sharp faculties is equivalent to their being irreversible because there is a common locus between their having sharp faculties and their having an uncertain disposition. On the other hand, unsurpassable enlightenment is harder to realize by bodhisattvas of dull faculties because it is possible that they temporarily revert from their course toward enlightenment. However, this does not mean that their having dull faculties is equivalent to their being reversible because there is the common locus between their having dull faculties and their mahayana disposition being certain. MCG (fols. 107b.6-108a.l) explains that, in general, the factors conducive to merit consist of the virtues of those who have not entered the (Buddhist) path, while the factors conducive to liberation consist of the virtues that merge with, or benefit, the liberation that is the freedom from suffering. 609 03793, fol. 114a.5-114b.l. 610 03796, fols. 17b.l-7, 76a.l-4, and 85a.5. 611 03794, fols. 206a.4-207a.6."},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"Notes 767 612 03795, fol. 270a.3-270b.3. 613 PGSO (pp. 227-30) explains the manner in which the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization are taught in the AA as follows. The manners in which they are taught in the first, second, fourth, and fifth chapters are easy to understand. In the third chapter, the paths of preparation and familiarization are not taught explicitly, but they are taught implicitly in terms of their meaning because this chapter teaches both the remedial knowledge of entities and the knowledge of entities that is an antagonistic factor in a complete manner. In the sixth chapter (the serial training), said three paths are not explicitly mentioned in the AA, but they are taught by Haribhadra's commentaries in a supplementary manner because aserial activity,\" aserial training,\" and aserial practice\" (as described in the prajfiapiramita siitras; cz. p. 549) are explained by respectively matching them with the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiariza­tion. For the Aloka (03791, fol. 314a.2) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 130a.1-2) state in the context of the serial training in recollecting the Buddha that athe three aspects of the recollection of the Buddha that bear the characteristic of being without recollection ultimately are, in due order, expressed as the factors conducive to penetration, the path of seeing, and the path of familiar­ization.\" A1i for the proofs that all the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization as they are taught in the first six chapters of the AA are the fully qualified paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization since there are no significant doubts about those taught in the first three chapters being the fully qualified ones, there is no need to provide proofs for them. As for the path of preparation in the chapter on the complete training in all aspects, it is the fully qualified path of preparation because (a) the factors conducive to liberation (AA IV.34) are explained as causes and (b) the path of preparation (IV.35-37) as their direct results. Reason (a) applies because the Vivrti (ibid., fol. 113b.2) explains the five mental factors such as confidence in the context of the factors conducive to liberation as not (yet) having the nature of the five purified faculties (on the first two levels of the path of preparation). Reason (b) applies because the Vivrti (ibid., fol. 113b.5) says with respect to AA IV.35-37 that athe factors conducive to pen­etration arise in those who possess the enthusiasm of the factors conducive to liberation having arisen.\" The path of preparation in the chapter on the culminating training is the fully quali­fied path of preparation because both the Aloka (03791, fol. 288b.3-4) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 121b.5-6) say with regard to AA V.1-4, alt should be understood that the signs and so on, in due order, represent the natures of the four factors conducive to penetration (such as heat) within the culminating clear realization.\" The path of preparation in the chapter on the serial training is the fully qualified path of preparation because it is taught there that it is preceded by the culminating training and that the serial training consists of all the trainings of familiar­izing with all aspects of the three knowledges according to their progressive order. The same reasons also apply for the paths of seeing and familiarization in the chapters on the first three trainings being fully qualified. Someone may say, aThen it follows that the passages in the first six chapters that teach on the path of preparation have the flaw of being repetitious because they teach the fully qualified path of preparation six times. The same goes for the paths of see­ing and familiarization.\" In our own system, the answer to that is as follows. There is no flaw of the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization being taught in a repetitious manner in the first three chapters because these chapters entail different purposes and manners of teaching them. The purposes are that said chapters teach said three paths for the sake of understanding that, in due order, the three types of realization through the prajfia arising from meditation (realizing, in the manner of meaning generalities, that entities, paths, and aspects lack any real arising. realizing this in a direct manner, and realizing it through familiarizing in a continuous manner with what was already realized) are complete in the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization, respectively. The different manners of teaching said three paths in said three chapters are to teach them by way of the isolates of realizing that all aspects, all paths, and all entities, respectively, lack any real arising. There is no flaw of the paths of preparation, seeing."},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"768 Groundless Paths and familiarization being taught in a repetitious manner in the chapters on the first three train­ings either because these also entail different purposes and manners of teaching. The different purposes in these chapters are that they teach said three paths for the sake of understanding that all three manners of fa miliarization (familiarizing in a combined manner with the aspects of all three knowledges as being the threefold lack of arising, familiarizing with this in a manner that is higher than the one on the path of accumulation, and familiarizing with it in a progressive manner in order to increase realization further and further) are respectively complete in the paths of preparation, seeing, and fa miliarization. The different manners of teaching said three paths in said three chapters are that they respectively teach them by way of the isolates of famil­iarizing in a combined manner with the aspects of all three knowledges as being the threefold lack of arising and so on. The Aloka (03791, fo l. 274a.2-3) says that the path of preparation and so on are taught in each one of the clear realizations by virtue of the divisions of familiarizing with all aspects, paths, and entities. Thus, it explicitly refutes that said three paths are taught in a repetitious manner in the first three chapters, which implies the same for the chapters on the first three trainings. As for the answer of others to the above objection that the paths of prepara­tion, seeing, and familiarization are taught in a repetitious manner, they say that the reason in this objection (all paths being fully qualified) does not apply. For though the paths of prepara­tion, seeing, and familiarization in the first three chapters represent the fully qualified ones, said paths in the chapters on the first three trainings are nominal ones. The manner in which they are nominal is explained in the Aloka (ibid., 247a.3-4) as fo llows: \"In the three such as the clear realization of all aspects, through the levels of familiarization being more and more special, the lesser, medium, and great uncontaminated wisdoms that consist of the path which is special in all aspects arise in a progressive manner.\" Therefore, this second passage does not represent Haribhadra's own words, but presents the position of his teacher Vairocanabhadra because the Aloka (ibid., fol. 247a.5-6) says on this passage, \"Therefore, [these three wisdoms] are taught through the conventional terms 'the factors conducive to penetration' and so on in order to refute their simultaneous arising. This is [the position] of some [others].\" In brief, according to Vairocanabhadra's position, the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization taught in the chapters on the first three trainings are nominal ones. For in the context of the complete training in all aspects, it is the lesser, medium, and great wisdoms of the eighth bhllmi that are taught by way of respectively labeling them with the names of the paths of preparation, seeing, and famil­iarization. In the contexts of the culminating training and the serial training, the same labeling applies to the lesser, medium, and great wisdoms of the ninth and tenth bhtimis, respectively. 614 The Sanskrit lingam and the corresponding Tibetan rtags mean both \"sign\" and \"reason.\" 615 LSSP/PSO have la (\"in\"), but las (\"from\") seems to make more sense here. 616 LSSP/PSO and the Tibetan of the Abhidharmakosabha�ya on V.59 say literally, \"not seiz­ing the heat of fo od.\" The translation follows the Sanskrit of the latter (bhakte �amata). 617 V.59. 618 V.l3-15ab. 619 03787, fo l. 75b.1-2. 620 04049, fol. 99b.2-3. 621 04053, fo l. 66a.6-7 and 04054, fo l. 229a.6-7. 622 09, vol. ka, fo l. 240a.3-6. 623 I could not locate this explanation in either of the two Brhaffikas, but most of it cor­responds to what the ViniScayasa'!'lgraha�;�i (04038, fo ls. 94a.2-4 and 102a.1-2) says-in the hinayina, the first one corresponds to the path of preparation; the second one, to abiding stream-enterers up through the vajralike samadhi; and the third one, to the path of nonlearning"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"Notes 769 up through the expanse of the nirvir.ta without remainder. For bodhisattvas, these respectively correspond to the level of engagement through aspiration, the bhiimis of pure superior inten­tion and so on, and the tathigatabhiimi. 624 Ill.3cd. 625 03787, fol. 15lb.5; 03793, fol. 254a.5-6; and 03788, fol. 119a.l. 626 PGSO (pp. 240-45) says the following on the faculties. As for the objects to which clinging is stopped, the siitra in eight thousand lines (Conze 1973, p. 205) says, \"Bodhisattva mahisattvas make no efforts in connecting and being preoccupied with ... talks ... about ... battles. They make no efforts in connecting and being preoccupied with talks about villages, cities, market towns, countries, kingdoms, and capitals. They make no efforts in connecting and being preoc­cupied with talks about themselves, ministers, and prime ministers.\" AA IV.49b-50a speaks about \"stopping to dwell on connecting and being occupied with the battle of the faculties and so on.\" Here, according to the Alokd (03791, fol. 254al-4), the word \"battle\" illustrates the fac­tors to be relinquished and their remedies; \"village,\" the faculties; \"cities,\" the elements as the supports of the faculties; \"market towns,\" the objects; \"themselves,\" consciousness; and \"min­isters and prime ministers,\" mental factors and primary minds, respectively. In brief, all these factors are summarized into four (the faculties, their supports, their objects, and consciousness) because this is merely a general teaching on the manner in which these factors to be relinquished are relinquished through their remedies, and because primary minds and mental factors are included in consciousness. As for the manner in which clinging is stopped, the factors to be relinquished consist of the four such as the contaminated faculties that make up the factors to be relinquished through seeing with regard to the reality of cessation (in AA IV.49). Their rem­edy is the subsequent readiness for the reality of cessation because it overcomes the factors to be relinquished that are the obstructions to attaining the subsequent readiness for the reality of cessation. It may be said, \"This is not tenable because the context here is the explanation of the subsequent cognition of the reality of cessation.\" There is no flaw because the factors to be relin­quished that pertain to the subsequent cognition of the reality of cessation are overcome by the subsequent readiness for the reality of cessation. The fruition of this process consists of the four results of freedom of having relinquished the four such as the contaminated faculties that make up the factors to be relinquished through seeing with regard to the reality of cessation. Said results are divided into four in terms of the respective factors to be relinquished, but they are not different in terms of their nature because the reality of cessation in the context of the subsequent cognition of the reality of cessation must be presented as a single one. Among the twenty-two faculties, following the prajiiipiramiti siitras, the definition of the faculty that makes everything unknown known is \"the ninefold set of confidence and so on on the level of not having attained the subsequent cognition of the reality of the path in the respective yinas.\" The definition of the faculty of knowing everything is \"the ninefold set of confidence and so on on the level of having attained the subsequent cognition of the reality of the path in the respective yanas and having to train in the trainings of the respective yinas by way of entailing the characteristics of effort.\" The definition of the faculty of being endowed with knowing everything is \"the ninefold set of confidence and so on on the level of not having to train in the trainings of the respective yinas by way of entailing the characteristics of eff ort.\" As for the meaning of the term \"faculty\" in each one of the twenty-two faculties, the first six master the production of their specific dominant results-the six consciousnesses. Both the male and female faculties master the natures of the two genders. The life faculty masters remaining in the respectively concordant class of the skan­dhas. Feelings master afflicted phenomena. The purified faculties master the increase of purified phenomena, the attainment of unattained uncontaminated qualities, and the further increase of the qualities already attained. In the desire realm there are nineteen out of the twenty-two facul­ties-all except for the three uncontaminated faculties. In the form realm there are fifteen-the above nineteen minus the male and female faculties, physical suffering, and mental displeasure"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"770 Groundless Paths (according to the Viniscayasa,.graha�i, the faculty of physical suffering exists here too). In the fo rmless realm there are eight-the life faculty, the mental faculty, equanimity, and the five such as confidence. 627 For details on how some of the eight profundities seem to be internally contradictory in terms of the two realities, see PBG on IV.59. 628 For the explanation of PGSD on the signs of irreversibility, see Appendix X. MCG (fols. llla.l-112a.4 and 115a.l-115b.l) says that, in general, those with sharp faculties on the path of accumulation progress without deviating from the path. Therefore, ordinary irreversibility exists from this level onward. In particular, irreversibility is certain from the level of peak or poised readiness on the mahayana path of preparation onward. Here, however, irreversibility is presented due to being able to be certain about it by virtue of the signs of irreversibility. If one­self and others are not able, due to said signs, to be certain about one's irreversibility, though one may in fact be irreversible, one cannot find anything that serves as a means to establish this irreversibility. This is the reason why, in that case, one is not called \"irreversible.\" Therefore, it is certain that those with sharp faculties attain the signs of irreversibility on the level of heat of the path of preparation; those with medium fa culties, on the path of seeing; and those with even the dullest faculties, on the eighth bhiimi. As for the sutras speaking of \"aspects,\" \"signs,\" and \"characteristics\" in this context, \"aspects\" refers to seeing the special qualities of bodhisattvas, just as the heat and the blazing redness of a fire. \"Signs\" refers to the results that are the special qualities in the mind streams of said bodhisattvas (such as their words of truth becoming ful­filled), just as knowing that, due to the existence of smoke, there is fire. \"Characteristics\" refers to inferring results from their causes, that is, apprehending the characteristics of attaining spe­cial qualities in the future, just as one knows that, from the coming together of firewood, a flint stone, the efforts of a person, and a spark. a fire will certainly arise. It is true that, in general, one cannot infer a result merely from its causes because there can be obstructions to these causes. However, since the marvelous conduct of bodhisattvas that is embraced by both the special inner and outer mentors is so powerful, it cannot be overcome by any obstructions whatsoever. Therefore, it is able to accomplish its own results, just as it is certain that travelers accompanied by many armies will reach the destinations they wish for, or just as young cakaravartins and bud­dhas are unstoppable. Thus here, through the collection of the causes being complete, it is certain that their fo llowing specific results are produced and, through that, there is no chance for obstructions either. In this way, the collection of causes of the final result is made complete. Since said signs of irreversibility are connected with the special motivation of bodhisattvas (the compassion in which all manifest states of mind of striving for peace for one's own welfare have come to an end) and the application of this motivation (the stable realization in terms of means and prajiiii), they are certain to represent the signs of irreversibility. In the context of the signs of irreversibility of bodhisattvas on the path of seeing, the statement that the sixteen wisdom moments of the readinesses and cognitions represent said signs, this is a case of labeling the results with the names of their causes, but it does not refer to the actual wisdoms of the path of seeing. For the invalidation of the explicit statement is that the wisdoms of meditative equipoise are not suitable to appear to others as signs. The basis of the intention that is the reason behind said statement is the connection in the sense that the special physical and verbal signs of turning away from discriminating notions of fo rm and so on arise during subsequent attainment as the results of the wisdoms of meditative equipoise that are their causes. The purpose of said state­ment is to make one understand that, except for cases of needing to address certain beings to be guided in certain situations, the subsequent attainments of bodhisattvas on the bhumis are simi­lar in their aspects to the meditative equipoises of these bodhisattvas. Thus, said sixteen signs during subsequent attainment that are attained by virtue of having directly realized the nature of phenomena during meditative equipoise are not different in that all of them are results that are attained subsequent to the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing. That they are"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"Notes 771 individually matched with its sixteen wisdom moments is only done in terms of isolates, but it is not the case here that distinct causes produce distinct corresponding results. MPZL (pp. 135 and 145-46) says that the signs of irreversibility represent result reasons similar to the following example: \"The person over there (the subject) is a person who is an authentic source of valid cognition because he or she teaches the actuality of the four realities in an unerring manner.\" Likewise, one says here, \"The bodhisattva over there (the subject) is an irreversible person because he or she is a person who has put an end to clinging to the real existence of form and so on.\" There is also the system of some people who infer the realization of meditative equipoise by virtue of the physical and verbal signs during subsequent attainment (taking this to be a result reason), establish perfect enlightenment by way of putting forth the realization of medita­tive equipoise as the reason (taking this to be a nature reason), and take the irreversibility by the power of that to be a negating reason of nonobservation. Thus, they explain that, at the end of having put forth said three reasons, the final reason for establishing irreversibility is a negating reason. As for the eightfold profundity as the signs of irreversibility of bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization, it is through the power of their realizing during meditative equipoise that the profound basic nature of the two realities is of one taste without contradiction-the equality of appearance and emptiness free from all superimpositions and denials-that they, during subse­quent attainment, exhibit the signs of being skilled in the means of explaining, by way of exposition, debate, composition, and so on, the profound basic nature of appearance and empti­ness without contradiction, just as it is. Through these signs, bodhisattvas who abide on the path of familiarization (the subject in question) are established as being the assembly of irreversible noble ones (the predicate to be proven). You may wonder, \"For example, in order to establish the irreversibility of bodhisattvas on the level of heat of the path of preparation, does one need all twelve signs together or is each one of them sufficient?\" What is to be followed here is the system of asserting that each one is sufficient. \"But then it follows that srivaka noble ones are irrevers­ible bodhisattvas on said level because they have terminated unfavorable states (the third one of said twelve signs).\" To say this means to not understand the essential point here. For example, one would not agree with the reasoning that a knowable object exists as the gem over there because it possesses light. However, when \"the light that is specified as being the one of a gem\" is put forth as the reason in said reasoning, it represents a correct reason to be agreed with. Likewise, after having identified \"the bodhisattva over there\" (and nobody else) as the subject in question, to establish him or her as being irreversible through the reason of this bodhisattva being specified by the sign of having terminated unfavorable states represents doing so through a correct reason. No doubt there is also the probative argument in terms of a nature through which one infers, by virtue of the reason of meditative equipoise, that perfect enlightenment is suitable to arise. However, one should understand that the probative arguments in this context of the signs of irreversibility of bodhisattvas are primarily result reasons that establish their irreversibility for the sake of others. Similar to MPZL, SZB (pp. 327-28) says that some people infer the realizations in meditative equipoise through the result reasons that are the physical and verbal signs during subsequent attainment, establish the certainty of becoming a buddha through putting forth said realizations in meditative equipoise as nature reasons, and establish irreversibility through putting forth the certainty of becoming a buddha as a reason of nonob­servation. However, in what the AA teaches explicitly, it is bodhisattvas on the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization who are taken as the subject in question, they are estab­lished as being irreversible persons (the predicate), and the reasons that are the means to establish this irreversibility are put forth in the explicit words of the AA. None of these represent reasons of nonobservation or negating reasons-the \"ir-\" in \"irreversible\" is just the attributive part of \"irreversible persons\" and not a negative. Therefore, the reasons that are explicitly pre­sented in the AA take said bodhisattvas as their subjects and represent affirming reasons that establish these bodhisattvas as irreversible persons. This is done either through nature reasons (taking certain aspects of qualities as the reasons to establish irreversibility, just as the heat of a"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"772 Groundless Paths fire points back to the fire) or result reasons (taking certain conducts of body and speech as the reasons to establish irreversibility, just as a fire is indicated by its smoke). Or it is certain causal characteristics that are taken as the reasons to establish irreversibility-through their union of prajiia and means bodhisattvas take, and rely on, the three jewels as their refuge, focus on the four realities as their focal objects, and engage in the three kinds of vigor as the remedies for the three kinds of laziness (the adverse conditions of the path). Through this, they come to be endowed with the five visions and the six supernatural knowledges that are the aids for accom­plishing the vast welfares of themselves and others, thus manifesting the actual main part of the path-the paths of seeing and familiarization. 629 XXV.20. PGSD (pp. 245-50) defines the training in the equality of saJpsaric existence and peace as \"the pure wisdom of familiarizing with saJpsiira and nirvaQa being equality in that they lack any nature of their own.\" As for the natures of saJpsiira and nirviil}a, they are illustrated in the stitras by the examples of dream and daytime, respectively. The definition of saJpsiira is \"the reality of suffering that arises under the sway of its causes-karma and afilic­tions-and consists of the states of not having relinquished the afilictions.\" It consists of both the outer world (the container) and sentient beings (its contents). As for its boundary lines, it exists up through the last moment of the hinayana paths of familiarization and the supreme dharma of the mahayana path of preparation. The definition of nirviil}a is \"the analytical cessa­tion of nonleamers in which the afflictive obscurations have been relinquished.\" It is twofold in terms of the hinayana and the mahayana. The meaning of equality is that saJpsiira and nirviil}a are equal in being the unity free from reference points and in lacking any nature of their own. As for the reasonings on this lack of nature, SaJpsiira is without nature because it only appears as what is to be relinquished from the perspective of mistaken minds without realization, but is not established ultimately. Mulamadhyamakakarika XVI.l says: You may say, \"Formations are saJpsiira.\" If they are permanent, they do not cycle. And if they are impermanent, they do not cycle either. The same approach applies to sentient beings. The nirviil}a of being liberated from saJpsiira is without nature because that which fetters one­SaJpSiira-does not exist by any nature of its own, just as there is no being liberated from chains if there is no being fettered by them in the first place. Mulamadhyamakakarika XVI.4 says: No matter how, it is not tenable That formations pass into nirviil}a, Nor is it tenable, no matter how, That sentient beings pass into nirviil}a. As for rebutting objections to this, in the slitras (CZ, pp. 415-16), Siiriputra asks Subhliti ques­tions in that regard, but Siiriputra is not the actual opponent because the actual opponents take karma to be established by its own nature, objecting that, from SaJpsiira and nirviil}a lacking any nature, \"it would follow that the state of daytime is without virtuous and nonvirtuous karma because it does not exist by any nature of its own, just like a dream.\" However, Siiriputra does not have such a wrong view. Therefore, the actual opponents are those who propound really existing entities because the disputes here in the slitras are taught for the sake of putting an end to their wrong views of clinging to real existence. The answer to the above objection is two­fold. First, the entailment of the predicate by the reason is not certain. For though virtuous and nonvirtuous karma does not exist by any nature of its own, it does exist from the perspective of the mistakenness of seeming reality. Secondly, according to the Madhyamikas, the example of not accumulating karma in dreams is incorrect because the virtuous and nonvirtuous karma that is dreamt of is revived through states of mind subsequent to the dream and thus becomes fully qualified karma. According to the Mere Mentalists (Virrzsikakarika 18cd), said example is"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"Notes 773 incorrect because the dreaming mind, by virtue of being affected by sleep, produces its tempo­rary results in a distorted manner. Some say that the answer by the Madhyamikas is uncertain, objecting, \"Then it would follow that buddhas can still accumulate karma because they can revive what happened through subsequent states of mind-the Buddha said, 'I have terminated the skandhas of sarp.sara.\"' Buddhas do not revive what happened through subseqent states of mind. For through the power of having realized nonconceptual wisdom, they are free from all conceptions of clinging. There is entailment because karma is accumulated under the sway of conceptions of clinging being present, but there is no accumulation of karma if there are no such conceptions. Some object to karma being accumulated under the sway of conceptions of clinging, claiming that this contradicts the scriptures. They say, \"It then would follow that the statement in the siitras that 'all karmas and intentions are void' is untenable because it is said here that karma is accumulated under the sway of conceptions of clinging.\" There is no entail­ment in this conseqence because said statement in the siitras has ultimate reality in mind, while the accumulation of karma under the sway of conceptions of clinging refers to seeming reality. Some object to virtuous and nonvirtuous karma being accumulated in dreams by saying, \"It then would follow that the dedication of the virtues of generosity and ethics in a dream represents a pure form of dedication because there is karma in dreams.\" As for the answer to this in the siitras, Sariputra did not answer himself, but referred the question to Maitreya as one who is prophesied to attain unsurpassable enlightenment in his next lifetime. The reason for Sariputra to do so was that he had the following in mind. If the opponents in question are suitable to be guided by the teachings of the present Buddha, the answers to the previous objections in the siitras here were already able to dispel their wrong ideas. However, if they are not suitable to be guided by the present teachings, their wrong ideas will be dispelled by future buddhas. The explicit answer that Maitreya gave was that he is endowed with the profound prajiia of realizing emptiness, which entailed the implicit answer that dedication is pure if it is embraced by the prajiia of realizing identitylessness. MCG (fol. 125b.3-5) adds that one may wonder, \"If bodhi­sattvas realize, without clinging, that all appearances during the waking state are like dreams, do they not accumulate any karma whatsoever?\" They do not accumulate any contaminated karma at all because, by virtue of being without clinging, they lack any striving and so on for what is contaminated. \"But then it would follow that they do not accumulate any uncontaminated karma either.\" Though bodhisattvas are without clinging, it is not that they do not benefit other sentient beings who possess clinging. Therefore, by virtue of causes and results being infallible, it is not the case that bodhisattvas do not complete their accumulations. 630 XIX.8. 631 PGSO (pp. 245-46) defines the training in pure realms as \"the pure yoga of familiarizing with all realms that consist of container and contents as being nothing but boundless purity.\" 632 03787, fol. 161b.2-3. 633 XX.1cd. 634 XX.4. 635 Ibid., XX.2-3. 636 03787, fol. 161b.6. PGSO (p. 246) defines the training in skill in means as \"the pure yoga of familiarization through knowing whether or not it is the right time to manifest the special qualities of skill in means.\" According to the Alokii (03791, fol. 267b.3-4), this and the two above trainings exist from the eighth bhiimi onward because it is explained that bodhisattvas up through the seventh bhiimi are conventionally called \"the sarp.gha of learners\" and those on the pure bhiimis, \"the sarp.gha of nonlearners,\" with said three trainings being cultivated by way of being generated in the mind streams of the sarp.gha of nonlearners."},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"774 Groundless Paths 637 04036, fol. 126a.3-5. 638 11.66cd. 639 03808, fol. 5a.2-3. 640 XX.8. 641 XX.9-10. 642 This and the following quotations are found on pp. 427-30 in CZ. 643 03793, fols. 52a.6-53b.2 (see also 03791, fol. 273a.6 and 273b.4). 644 03800, fol. 55b.2-3. 645 PGSO (pp. 251-53) defines the four miras as follows. The mara of the skandhas is \"the subcategory of the four maras that consists of what is contaminated and arises under the sway of karma and afflictions as its causes.\" It is equivalent to the reality of suffering. The mara of the afflictions is \"the subcategory of the four miras that exists as the nature of the afflictions, which agitate the mind stream,\" such as the primary and secondary afflictions. The mara of death is \"the subcategory of the four miras that is the link of dependent origination which arises under the sway of karma and afflictions as its causes,\" such as the stopping of the life-force of ordinary beings. The devaputramara is \"the subcategory of the four miras that consists of those gods who are included in the classes of gods of the desire realm and create obstacles for uncontaminated virtue,\" such as the devaputras who create obstacles for practicing the genuine dharma. Though the last three miras are mutually exclusive, the last three and the first one are not mutually exlusive because the last three are included in the first one as its subtypes. They are presented as four in terms of creating obstacles for living for a long time, thus attaining spe­cial uncontaminated qualities, and eventually attaining the fruitions of the nirvaJ)as with and without remainder. They are called \"miras\" because they obstruct the attainment of the state of immortality (\"mara\" also means \"death\"). As for the boundary lines of overcoming the four miras, the srivaka system asserts that, in the case of the Buddha, the devaputramara was over­come through the weapon of love under the bodhi tree; the mara of the afflictions, through the vajralike samidhi at dawn there; the mara of death, through the Buddha blessing his formations of this life at Srivasti; and the mara of the skandhas, through passing into the nirvaJ)a without remainder at Ku5inagara. In the common yana, according to the hinayana, the devaputramara is overcome on the hinayana path of seeing. For on it one attains the clear realization of the three jewels in one's mind stream because one directly realizes the four realities. The mara of the afflic­tions is overcome when one has become an arhat because one has exhaustively relinquished the afflictions of the three realms. The mara of death is overcome by arhats who attained the highest form of the fourth dhyana because they attained mastery over retaining and discarding their life. The mara of the skandhas is overcome upon attaining the ni�a without remainder because the reality of suffering is exhaustively relinquished at that point. According to the mahayana, the four miras can be overcome even from the path of accumulation onward because such is the case for those on the mahayana path of accumulation who have previously realized the hinayana nirvaJ)a without remainder. Otherwise, the devaputramara is overcome from the mahayana path of preparation onward because, on it, one attains the clear realization of the three jewels in one's mind stream. The miras of the afflictions and death are overcome on the first bhiimi. because, on it, birth and death in sarpsara under the sway of karma and afflictions have been relinquished. The mira of the skandhas can operate up through the seventh bhfuni because it can operate in all physical supports that are similar in type to those of bodhisattvas on the mahayana path of preparation that arose under the sway of karma and afflictions. It is also possible for this mara to be overcome on the first bhiimi even in those who have not previously progressed through inferior paths because bodhisattvas during the subsequent attainment of the"},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"Notes 775 first bhlimi can discard their skandhas that arose under the sway of karma and afflictions and assume a body which is mental in nature. The mara of skandhas is definitely overcome on the eighth bhlimi because, on it, even if one does not retain or discard one's life, through the power of having attained mastery over nonconceptual wisdom one's former contaminated body trans­forms into an uncontaminated one. Therefore, the essential point of this is as follows. On the impure bh1imis, to discard what is similar in type to the contaminated form skandha depends on leaving one's present life. However, once one has attained the realization of the eighth bhlimi, even if one does not retain or discard one's life, through the power of one's inner realization one transforms one's contaminated form skandha into an uncontaminated one, which thus does not depend on leaving one's present life. 646 XXVI. I. In accord with the sutra in eight thousand lines, the Sanskrit of the end of line c reads,\" ... trichiliocosm through measuring them [with the tip of a straw).\" 647 CZ, pp. 459-60. 648 PGSD (pp. 255-60) says that the eight points of the culminating training are summa­rized into the four culminations of the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization, and the uninterrupted path. For the culminating training is what is to be cultivated as the remedy for the antagonistic factors to be relinquished and, (1) in terms of the manifest factors to be relinquished, is presented as the culminating training of the path of preparation; (2) in terms of the seeds of the factors to be relinquished, as the two culminating trainings of the paths of seeing and familiarization; and (3) in terms of the impregnations of negative tendencies, as the culminating training of the uninterrupted path. (1) is the case because manifest factors to be relinquished on the path of preparation exist as the four conceptions about the apprehended (engagement and withdrawal) and the apprehender (substance and imputation) and because it, in terms of the remedies of these four conceptions, is taught as the four culminating train­ings of the signs and so on. (2) is the case because the seeds of the factors to be relinquished are twofold-those on the path of seeing and those on the path of familiarization-and because, in terms of the remedies for these seeds, said two paths are presented as the culminating trainings of the path of seeing and familiarization, respectively. As for the culminating training of the path of preparation, it is equivalent to the mahayana path of preparation. Its definition is \"the mahayana factors conducive to penetration that represent the highest form of familiarizing with the three knowledges in a combined manner.\" When divided in terms of its qualities, it con­sists of the four culminating trainings of signs, increase, stability, and settling the mind. When divided in terms of its instances, it consists of the four culminating trainings of heat and so on. The definition of the culminating training of signs is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas that consists of the level of heat, which is endowed with the qualities of any one of the twelve signs that are taught here.\" It is instantiated by the knowledge of bodhisattva& with sharp faculties on the level of heat. The first one of the twelve signs means that bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the level of heat, through the power of their having familiarized with all phenomena as being dream­like during the day, possess, within their dreams, the knowledge of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment of realizing that all phenomena lack real existence, just like dreams (the analogous applies for the remaining signs). In terms of time, the twelve signs are contained in the time of dreaming and the waking state because the first six pertain mainly to the former and the last six, mainly to the latter. In terms of their nature, said signs consist of meditative equi­poise and subsequent attainment because each one entails these two phases. As for the boundary lines, the culminating training of signs exists only on the level of heat, but it is explained that the qualities of its twelve signs exist in a progressively increasing manner from heat up through the end of the continuum (the same applies for the remaining three culminating trainings of the path of preparation). As for the time when these twelve signs become signs, it is through the persons who are their supports that they become the general signs of these persons having attained the culminating training and the specific signs of their irreversibility from their own"},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"776 Groundless Paths perspective. You may wonder, \"What is the difference between the twelve signs here and the signs that establish someone as an irreversible person on the path of preparation as taught in the fourth chapter above?\" The difference lies in what is to be established-the signs here establish irreversibility mainly from a bodhisattva's own perspective, while the above do so mainly from the perspective of others. There is also a difference in their nature because the signs here consist of only the knowledge that makes up the culminating training itself, while the above signs also entail perceptible physical and verbal expressions during subsequent attainment. The definition of the culminating training of increase is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas that consists of the level of peak, which is endowed with the qualities of the increase of merit that is taught here.\" \"Increase of merit\" refers to the roots of virtue that consist of the two accumulations in the mind streams of bodhisattvas on the level of peak. The definition of the culminating training of stability is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas that consists of the level of poised readiness, which is endowed with the qualities of twofold stability.\" The stability of realization (one's own welfare) corresponds to the striving of bodhisattvas on the level of poised readiness to dedicate all roots of virtue of themselves and others for the sake of fully completing all dharmas of the three knowledges. The stability of enlightened activity (the welfare of others) corresponds to the actions of such bod­hisattvas that are motivated by the great compassion in their mind streams. The definition of the culminating training of the abiding of the mind is \"the yoga of bodhisattvas that consists of the level of the supreme dharma, which is endowed with the qualities of the abiding of the mind\" These qualities consist of the samidhi of bodhisattvas on the level of the supreme dharma in which the mind abides one-pointedly and which is congruently associated with rejoicing. 649 The descriptions of the following two sets of nine remedies are based on pp. 466-74 in cz. 650 The above disputes and this answer are based on the Vrtti (03787, fol. 168a.6-168b.4) and the Aloka (03791, fol. 289a.6-289b.6). 651 PSO has yod pa, but LSSP has yod sa. MPZL (pp. 154-55) says that the seeds of the two types of the conceptions about the apprehender exist in both ordinary beings and noble ones, but their manifest forms are certain to exist distinctly in ordinary beings and noble ones, respec­tively. The clinging to a person by ordinary beings cannot be but the clinging to a personal self because they do not realize identitylessness directly. Therefore, through reasonings such as the sevenfold reasoning based on the example of a chariot, they can gain certainty about persons merely existing in an imputed manner and those on the path of preparation can familiarize with identitylessness in the manner of a clear illumination of the prajni about it. However since the latter still do not realize identitylessness in a direct manner, their insight only constitutes the mental engagement in aspiring for true reality, but it is not the mental engagement in true reality in a direct manner. Therefore, their conceptions during subsequent attainment cannot have the nature of apprehending imputations. On the other hand, since noble ones directly real­ize identitylessness during meditative equipoise, during subsequent attainment they cannot but apprehend persons as imputations because they do not apprehend them as a personal self. As for the essential point here, in general, one should be learned in the manner in which substantial and imputed persons are presented in the system of Great Madhyamaka, the distinct man­ners in which ordinary beings and noble ones apprehend persons as substantial and imputed, respectively, and so on. In particular, if one wishes to understand the profound meanings to be understood in this context here, one should do so by virtue of the excellent explanations of Aryavimuktisena, who dwelled on the bhdmis of the noble ones. Though there are various approaches of explaining the meaning of this section, in general, it accords with the general scriptural tradition of Great Madhyamaka. In particular, I think one needs to connect it with the words of the pertinent passages in the root text and trust in the dharma necessary for those who strive for liberation and the knowledge of all aspects, which establishes the differences between"},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"Notes 777 the factors to be relinquished and their remedies through reasoning and is certain to be the cor­rect path. 652 The descriptions of these nine remedies are based on pp. 474-77 in CZ. 653 The descriptions of these nine remedies are based on pp. 477-80 in CZ. 654 Based on the Vivrti (03793, fols. 126b.4-127a.1), PGSD (pp. 260-62) explains that Haribhadra coined the conventional term \"preparation\" for the remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of engagement and the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of substance. For the remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of withdrawal and the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of imputations, he used the term \"entering.\" The definition of \"preparation\" as the remedy for the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing taught here is \"that which, by way of actually relin­quishing the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing and possessing the capacity to suppress their seeds, consists of the preparatory path that is the preparation for the actual path of seeing.\" It is instantiated by the wisdom of the last moment of the level of the supreme dharma of the mahayana path of preparation. The definition of the uninterrupted path of \"entering\" as the remedy for the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing taught here is \"the mahayana clear realization of the four realities that is in the process of performing the function of actually relinquishing the seeds of the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing.\" It is instantiated by the uninterrupted path of the mahayana path of seeing. As for the manners in which the factors to be relinquished and their remedies are matched here, the first type of remedy is presented as \"preparation\" in terms of the manifest factors to be relinquished because \"preparation\" performs the function of actually relinquishing the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing and possessing the capacity to suppress their seeds. The second type of remedy is presented as \"entering\" in terms of the seeds of the factors to be relinquished because_the uninterrupted path of \"entering\" renders the seeds of the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing into something that has the property of not arising again. That Haribhadra explains the remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of engagement and the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of substance as \"preparation\" and the remedies for the conceptions about the apprehended in terms of withdrawal and the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of imputations as \"entering\" is done so only in terms of the respective two conceptions explicitly mentioned in each of these two types of remedy pointing out the respectively other two. Thus, ]lis explicitly matching the respective factors to be relinquished and their remedies in the above manner is not definite because \"preparation\" relinquishes the manifest forms of all four conceptions and \"entering,\" the seeds of all four, thus making eight remedies altogether. MCG (fols. 130b.5-131a.6 and 132a.2-132b.1) explains that the conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing are twofold in terms of (1) apprehended objects and (2) their apprehenders. (1) The conceptions about the apprehended consist of (a) apprehending the mahayana path and its fruition as the objects to be engaged and (b) apprehending the paths and fruitions of srivakas and pratyekabuddhas as the objects from which to withdraw. The conceptions about the appre­hender consist of (a) focusing on persons who are ordinary beings and then clinging to them as being substantially existent and (b) focusing on persons who are noble ones and then clinging to them as being imputedly existent. (1) Since said objects of engagement and withdrawal are not established ultimately, the conceptions of clinging to them as being really established and then regarding them as what is to be engaged and from which one should withdraw, respectively, are factors to be relinquished during both meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. As for apprehending them as objects of engagement and withdrawal without clinging to them as being really existent, from the perspective of subsequent attainment with its dualistic appearances this needs not to be relinquished. However, since the conceptions about characteristics of merely apprehending said objects of engagement and withdrawal as such objects do not appear for the"},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"778 Groundless Paths nondual wisdom of meditative equipoise, it is important to understand that, in true reality, such seeming objects during subsequent attainment are not even established as mere objects that can be apprehended in these two ways. (2) The conceptions about the apprehender in terms of sub­stance and imputations are to be understood similarly. Through explicitly teaching the clinging to substance with regard to the phenomena of ordinary beings, it is implicitly taught that the clinging to imputations also exists as a manner of clinging to the phenomena of ordinary beings. Through explicitly teaching the clinging to imputations with regard to the phenomena of noble ones, it is implicitly taught that ordinary beings also cling to said phenomena as being substan­tially existent. Thus, ultimately, the two types of clinging to substance and imputations are to be understood according to the manner of relinquishment that is explained here in the slitras. That ordinary beings cling to persons as being substantially existent and noble ones cling to them as imputedly existent refers to their, respectively, not realizing and realizing identitylessness. Thus, said conceptions do not refer to objects, but are explained to refer to subjects. However, when referring to their objects, it is suitable to take them as what is apprehended in which manners. Thus, through teaching ordinary beings as the focal objects of the first type of the concep­tions about the apprehender, noble ones are taught implicitly. Through teaching noble ones as the focal objects of the second type, ordinary beings are taught implicitly. This means that all ordinary and noble persons may be regarded as being substantially existent, but, ultimately, they are not even observable as imputations. Therefore, one should understand that, by way of the exemplary conceptions that are factors to be relinquished through seeing and familiariza­tion, it is taught that all clinging and observing in the form of the infinite conceptions about what is to be adopted, to be rejected, to be affirmed, and to be negated must be relinquished. As an implication of this teaching, one will also understand the defining characteristics of puri­fied phenomena, the differences between the hinayana and the mahayana, and so on. Through understanding that, one will engage in the path in the manner of not clinging to anything, which is the meaning taught by the prajiiaparamita sutras. 655 V.l9ab. 656 Verse 1. 657 1.1. 658 11.19cd. 659 XX.20cd. 660 Verse4. 661 LSSP (vol. 2, fol. 173b.l) emphasizes that the four yogas represent the progressive stages of meditation of Madhyamikas alone and that it is ridiculous to match the first yoga with the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas; the second and third, with the Mere Mentalists; and only the fourth one, with the Madhyamikas. 662 PGSD (pp. 262-69) says that the cause of great enlightenment is what aids this enlighten­ment by way of having it as its specific result. This is instantiated by the merit of bodhisattvas on the path of seeing, during their subsequent attainment, establishing those to be guided in the dharma of scriptures and realization and, during their meditative equipoise, familiarizing with prajiiaparamita. The definition of unsurpassable enlightenment is \"the final wisdom of directly realizing that the arising and the termination of the stains of the two obscurations lack real exis­tence.\" Its instances are the fo ur kayas. As for refuting the manner in which the proponents of real entities assert the relinquishment of the obscurations, it is not tenable that the obscurations are relinquished through the power of their remedies. For since the obscurations are established as being of the nature of mind, they are something really established. As for the manner in which the Madhyamaka assertion of the relinquishment of the obscurations by way of the four"},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"Notes 779 stages of yoga is tenable, ( 1) the first yoga of realizing personal identitylessness is as follows. The reasoning in the context of reflection is something like, \"The appropriating skandhas do not exist as a permanent and independent personal self because they entail arising and ceasing.\" The definition of the yoga arisen from familiarization is \"the yoga of the unity of calm abiding and superior insight of realizing personal identitylessness.\" It is classified as fivefold-the yogas of realizing personal identitylessness in the manner of an object generality through study and reflection, realizing it in the manner of an object generality through the prajii.a that arises from familiarization, realizing it newly in a direct manner, realizing it through continually familiar­izing with what has been realized already, and realizing it directly and finally. Thus, in terms of the boundary lines of the first yoga, it exists from the path of accumulation up through the buddhabhtimi. Its result is the consummate relinquishment of the clinging to a personal self. (2) As for the yoga of realizing the lack of something apprehended, the reasoning in the context of reflection is something like, \"Blue does not exist as an external referent that is different in sub­stance from the valid cognition of apprehending blue because it is invariably observed together with the latter.\" The definition of the yoga arisen from familiarization is \"the yoga of the unity of calm abiding and superior insight of realizing phenomenal identitylessness in terms of the apprehended.\" It is classified as fivefold as above. As for its boundary lines, in terms of sheer attainment, it exists from the path of accumulation of pratyekabuddhas onward. In terms of being predominant, it exists from the mahayana level of heat onward. Its result is the consum­mate relinquishment of the clinging to a phenomenal identity in terms of the apprehended. (3) As for the yoga of realizing the lack of an apprehender, the reasoning in the context of reflection is something like, \"The cognitions that apprehend external referents do not exist by any nature of their own because their objects-external referents-do not exist by any nature of their own.\" The definition of the yoga arisen from familiarization is \"the yoga of the unity of calm abiding and superior insight of realizing that the cognitions that apprehend external referents do not exist by any nature of their own.\" It is classified as twofold-the yogas of realiz­ing, in the manner of object generalities, and directly, respectively, that said cognitions lack real existence. As for its boundary lines, in terms of sheer attainment, it exists from the mahayana path of accumulation onward. In terms of being predominant, it exists from the mahayana level of poised readiness onward. Its result is the consummate relinquishment of the clinging to a phenomenal identity in terms of the apprehender. (4) As for the yoga of realizing the freedom from reference points, the reasoning in the context of reflection is something like, \"The self­aware and self-illuminating cognition without the duality of apprehender �d apprehended is not really existent because it is dependently originated.\" The definition of the yoga arisen from familiarization is \"the yoga of the unity of calm abiding and superior insight of realizing that the cognitions that apprehend external referents do not exist by any nature of their own.\" In terms of realizing emptiness, it is classified as fivefold as above. As for its boundary lines, in terms of sheer attainment, it exists from the mahayana path of accumulation onward. In terms of being predominant, it exists from the first bhiimi onward. Its result is the final relinquishment of the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies. The reasons for teaching the progression of these four yogas in this way are that, first, the bad views of tirthikas are refuted and they are thus connected with the excellencies of the higher realms. Then, in due order, they are established in the view of realizing personal identitylessness, the view of realizing the identitylessness of cog­nitions with apprehender and apprehended, and, gradually, the view of being free from the eight extremes of reference points. As for the definite number of the four yogas, they are presented in this way in terms of overcoming their respective factors to be relinquished because the latter are four-afflictions, the clinging to a phenomenal identity in terms of the apprehended, the cling­ing to a phenomenal identity in terms of the apprehender, and their seeds. As for their scriptural sources, the first yoga is taught by the statement:"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":"780 Groundless Paths In this there is no self or sentient being. All these phenomena entail causes. The latter three are taught by Lankavatiirasutra X.256cd-257: By relying on mere mind, One does not imagine outer objects. By resting in the focal object of suchness, One should go beyond mere mind too. Having gone beyond mere mind, One must even go beyond nonappearance. The yogin who rests in nonappearance Sees the mahayana. In brief, the mahayana path of seeing is the path of having attained the fo ur stages of yoga because it is the path of directly realizing emptiness free from reference points. As for the mahayana path of seeing representing Madhyamaka, the definition of Madhyamaka is \"the dharma of being free from the two extremes of permanence and extinction.\" It is divided into ground, path, and fruition Madhyamaka. The definition of the first one is \"that which serves as the basis with regard to which path Madhyamaka has to cut through superimpositions,\" which is instantiated by all phenomena. The definition of path Madhyamaka is \"the knowledge of realizing empti­ness in the mind streams of Madhyamikas,\" which is equivalent to the Madhyamaka view. It is twofold-the object to be realized that is viewed (suchness as the basic nature) and the realizing path that views it (the five mahayana paths). The latter is the fully qualified Madhyamaka view, while the fo rmer one represents the nominal Madhyamaka view because the object of the view is labeled with the name of its subject. The definition of fruition Madhyamaka is \"the unsur­passable enlightenment that is attained through the power of having familiarized with path Madhyamaka,\" which is instantiated by the fo ur kayas. As for the reasonings that determine the Madhyamaka view, (1) absurd consequences are explained in order to stop the wrong ideas of clinging to real existence and (2) probative arguments are explained in order to give rise to inferential reasoning consciousnesses that realize identitylessness. {1) The Madhyamaka conse­quences that invalidate the referent objects of the wrong ideas of clinging to real existence that are imputed by the proponents of real entities are fourfold-( a) consequences that give rise to an inference that is acknowledged by others, (b) consequences in terms of the analogous appli­cability of the opponent's reason, \"(c) consequences that expose contradictions in others, and (d) consequences that expose the nonapplication of the means of proof due to presupposing the probandum. (a) The first one is a consequence that is flung as an unwanted consequence by way of formulating as its reason what the proponents of entities claim themselves. For example, \"It follows that the arising of a sprout does not depend on causes and conditions because it is established by a nature of its own.\" (b) A consequence that refutes real existence by way of the analogous applicability of the opponent's reason would be, \"It follows that the ear conscious­ness is what views visible fo rms because the eye consciousness is really established as what views visible forms.\" (c) A consequence that refutes real existence by way of exposing internally con­tradictory claims would be, \"It follows that it is not suitable for the proponents of real entities to relinquish the obscurations through the power of their remedies because the obscurations are really established.\" (d) A consequence that exposes the flaw of the nonapplication of the means of proof (being established by a nature of its own) due to presupposing the probandum would be as follows. The proponents of real entities may say, \"The skandha of form exists by a nature of its own because the skandha of consciousness exists by a nature of its own.\" It then follows that the skandha of consciousness existing by a nature of its own is not suitable as a proof for the skandha of form existing by a nature of its own because the very reasoning that refutes that the skandha of form exists by a nature of its own is also able to refute that the skandha of conscious­ness exists by a nature of its own. As Mulamadhyamakakiirikii IV.S says:"},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"When something is questioned through emptiness, Everything that someone may express as a reply Does thereby not constitute a reply, [For] it would presuppose what is to be proven. Notes 781 (2) The probative arguments to generate reasoning consciousnesses consist of the four Madhyamaka reasonings. The first three are as explained in PSD above and the reasoning of dependent origination is said to refute both extremes of nonexistence and existence. In the first case, it reads, \"Appearances such as form are not nonexistent conventionally because they are dependently originated.\" In the second case, it reads, \"Appearances such as form are not existent ultimately because they are dependently originated.\" As Mulamadhyamakakarika XXIV.19 says: Since there is no phenomenon That is not dependently originated, There is no phenomenon That is not empty. Therefore, it is reasonable for persons who strive for liberation to eliminate the wrong ideas of clinging to real existence and then make great efforts in the view of realizing identitylessness because the attainment of final liberation depends on this. In brief, the mahayana path of seeing represents the view of Madhyamaka because it is the knowledge of directly realizing emptiness. 663 In the V.rtti (D3787, fol. 174b.2-4), the Aloka (D3791, fols. 304b.7-305a.2-3), the Vivrti (D3794, fols. 125b.7-126a.1), and Ratniikarasanti's Suddhamati (D3801, fol. 181b.3-5), the lion's sport is explicitly related to the path of seeing, while the latter author's Sarottama does not mention the lion's sport in the context of the path of seeing. Note, however, that none of the first four commentaries identify the lion's sport as the actual meditative equipoise of the path of seeing, which consists of the six sets of six piiramitiis. Rather, the Vrtti, the Aloka, and the Vivrti say that the lion's sport is cultivated in order to master said meditative equipoise, which the latter two explain further by saying that it is those who have already attained the path of seeing who cultivate the lion's sport again and again in order to become free from the fear of afflictive and cognitive obscurations. The Suddhamati also says that the lion's sport follows said equipoise. PGSD (p. 269) defines the culminating training of the path of seeing as \"the mahayana clear realization of the four realities of practicing each one of the paramitiis in such a way that it is endowed with all six piiramitiis.\" This is equivalent to the path of seeing and classified as twofold-the uninterrupted path and the path of liberation. In brief, the dharma readiness for suffering of the mahayana path of seeing is the culminating training of the path of seeing because it is the mahayana clear realization of the four realities of practicing each one of the piiramitiis in such a way that it is endowed with all six paramitiis. The special path of the mahayana path of seeing is the samadhi of the lion's sport. Both MCG (fol. 138b.3-5) and MPZL (p. 164) explain that, in general, the term \"samadhi of the lion's sport\" applies to the path of liberation of the path of seeing, the special path of entering its meditative equipoise of resting in the nature of phenomena again, and the preparatory samadhi of the lion's sport that serves as the preparation for the path of familiarization. MCG (fol. 139a.5-139b.2) summarizes the culminating training of the path of seeing by saying that its wisdom, which has arrived at the nature of phenomena-the unity of appearance and emptiness-in which there is nothing to be removed or to be added, relinquishes, without observing subject and object as being differ­ent, all conceptions of focusing on the nature of phenomena in mistaken ways. Once that has happened, despite this wisdom being nonconceptual, the twelve times one hundred qualities of bodhisattvas on the first bhiimi arise without effort. During meditative equipoise, they rest in the equality of all phenomena being unobservable and, during subsequent attainment, they teach others, without any clinging, the dharma that liberates from suffering. 664 D4049, fol. 65b.l."},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"782 Groundless Paths 665 Ibid., fol. 86a.6-7. 666 04052, fol. 341a.4-5 (this text does not mention a commentary on the Pratitya­samutpadasiltra and the Tengyur also does not contain such a commentary). 667 These sixty-two wrong views are, for example, described in the Brahmajalasutta (Digha Nikaya 1.12-1.46; trans. in M. Walshe 1995, pp. 73-90; P1021, pp. 286.2.8tf.) and can be sum­marized in the fourteen \"undecided\" questions above. 668 Both LSSP and PSO have bdag smra yod pas bdag smra, which does not make much sense and thus, in accordance with the following phrase \"views about a self,\" is emended to bdag lta yod pas dbag smra. 669 PSO has \"six [kinds of] beings,\" but LSSP has \"five,\" which accords with becoming being said here to be sevenfold. 670 This refers to birth through warmth and moisture, birth from an egg, birth from a womb, and miraculous birth (such as in gods and hell beings). 671 Lines 2ac. 672 I could not locate any statements to this effect in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. However, except for omitting the causal condition, the above statements are found in the Yogacarabhumi (04035, fol. 110b.2-5), which adds that the twelve links cannot function as causal conditions because the causal condition is characterized by being their seeds. 673 The Mahayanasa111graha does not explicitly say that. Its commentaries by Vasubandhu (04050, fol. 133b.4) and Asvabhiva (04051, fol. 207b.5) take the phrase \"dominant condition\" in 1.28 (04048, fol. 7b.7) as referring to ignorance and so on giving rise to formations, but do not say either that ignorance is solely the dominant condition. 674 This text (04035, fol. 110b.4) makes said statement summarily for all formless links func­tioning for each other as the three conditions except for the causal condition. 675 1.11-12ab. 676 04052, fol. 352b.4-5. 677 Ibid., fol. 341a.5-341b.l. 678 MCG (fols. 138b.5-139a.5) says that, though the origin of suffering is not established in the equality of the nature of phenomena, the manner in which the latter seems to become the origin of suffering under the sway of one's own conceptions is represented by the progressive order of afflicted phenomena (formations and so on arising from the ignorance of conceiving of a self). Through familiarizing with this, one realizes that the primary ones among afflictions and karma-the two links of ignorance and formations-make up the root of saipSira. This repre­sents the realization of the nature of the reality of the origin of suffering. Through familiarizing with the reverse order of afflicted phenomena (aging and death arising from birth and so on all the way back to ignorance), one realizes that birth, aging, and death are the final results of karma and afflictions, which represents the realization of the nature of the reality of suffering. Through familiarizing with the progressive order of purified phenomena (through the cessation of igno­rance, formations cease and so on), one realizes that the root of saJpsira is severed through the remedy for ignorance-the prajni of realizing identitylessness. This represents the realization of the nature of the reality of the path. Through familiarizing with the reverse order of purified phenomena (aging and death ceasing through the ceasing of birth and so on all the way back to ignorance), by virtue of relinquishing afflicted ignorance one realizes that the final result of purified phenomena consists of the cessation of birth, aging, and death, which represents the realization of the nature of the reality of cessation."},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"Notes 783 679 PGSO (p. 270) defines the culmination of the path of familiarization as \"the mahayana subsequent clear realization that is the highest level of familiarizing with the three knowledges in a combined manner.\" It is equivalent to the mahayana path of familiarization and is twofold in terms of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. In brief, the uninterrupted path of the second bhiimi belongs to the culminating training of the path of familiarization because it is a mahayana subsequent clear realization of familiarizing with the emptiness that was already realized in a direct manner. MPZL (p. 165) says that the culminating training of the path of familiarization consists of the two elements of calm abiding (the support) and superior insight (the supported). What is taught here through the lion's sport and the crossing in one leap con­sists of the preparatory and actual phases, respectively, of its element of calm abiding. For an overview of the different presentations of the sequence of the preparatory lion's sport and the actual crossing in one leap on the path of familiarization in LSSP/PSO, MCG, and MPZL, see Appendix XI. Note that neither the slitras (CZ, pp. 501-2), nor the Vrtti, the Aloka, or the Vivrti say that the lion's sport is the preparatory stage of the culminating training of the path of famil­iarization. The Vrtti (03787, fols. 174b.2-4, 174b.7, and 175a.5) mentions the lion's sport in the context of the culminating training of the path of seeing and in two passages from the above­mentioned slitra section under the heading of the path of familiarization's crossing in one leap. However, both these passages only say that the crossing in one leap is entered subsequent to the lion's sport, but not that the latter belongs to the path of familiarization. Both the Aloka and the Vivrti do not mention the lion's sport at all in their very brief treatment of V.24-25 on the cross­ing in one leap. Being a commentary on the slitra in eight thousand lines (which does not discuss this topic in the first place), the Aloka does not even comment on V.24-25, but explicitly refers to the slitra in twenty-five thousand lines and just quotes the beginning of the latter of the two above-mentioned slitra passages. As mentioned above, Ratniikara8iinti's Suddhamati (03801, fol. 181b.3-6) relates the lion's sport only to the path of seeing, while it is only the following crossing in one leap that is said to represent the path of familiarization (Rong ston shes bya kun rig 1988 [fol. 134a.4] praises \"RatniikaraSiinti's excellent explanation of the lion's sport being only treated by V.23 and not being included at all in V.24-25\"). By contrast, Ratniikara8iinti's Sarottama (03803, fols. 184b.1-186b.1) explicitly comments on AA V.23-25 as relating to the path of familiarization, saying that, according to the slitras, both the lion's sport and the cross­ing in one leap constitute \"the entirety of the means in which bodhisattvas are skillful\" (on this phrase, the Aloka [03791, fol. 305a.4] says that it here means the path of familiarization). 680 This section is based on Abhidharmakosa VIII.18c-19ab and its Bha�ya. 681 This means that, first, one enters the contaminated form of the first dhyiina. Then, by skipping the second dhyana, one enters the contaminated third dhyiina. Next, by skipping the fourth dhyana, one enters the contaminated formless absorption of Infinite Space. Finally, by skipping Infinite Consciousness, one enters the contaminated absorption of Nothing Whatsoever, and then reverses the entire process in the same manner. Secondly, one likewise sequentially enters the uncontaminated first dhyana, skips the second one, enters the uncon­taminated third one, skips the fourth one, enters uncontaminated Infinite Space, skips Infinite Consciousness, enters uncontaminated Nothing Whatsoever, and reverses that process too. Note that the Abhidharmakosabh�ya lists four preparatory stages. First, one sequentially travels through the eight contaminated meditative absorptions in their progressive and reverse orders. Secondly, one does the same for the uncontaminated forms of the first seven. The third and fourth preparations are as in the above \"proximate preparation.\" 682 This and the following quotes in this section are found on pp. 505-9 in CZ. 683 PSO has \"being contingent\" (rag las pa). 684 03787, fols. 176a.1-177a.2."},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"784 Groundless Paths 685 03793, fo l. 126b.6. 686 03787, fo l. 176b.2-5. 687 This and the fo llowing quotes in this section are found on pp. 509-10 in CZ. 688 This and the fo llowing quotes in this section are fo und on pp. 511-16 in CZ. 689 This and the fo llowing quotes in this section are fo und on pp. 518-22 in CZ. 690 03787, fo l. 180a.5-6. 691 03791, fo l. 310b.6; 03793, fo l. 127b.5. 692 MCG (fols. 141a.2-145a.3) says that the four types of the conceptions about apprehender and apprehended that are factors to be relinquished through familiarization represent the innate fo rms of these obscurations.

(2) The conceptions about the apprehended in terms of withdrawal fo cus on, and cling to, the various paths of the hinayana. As for the conceptions about the apprehender in terms of substance and imputations, they both fo cus on, and cling to, the phenomena of both ordinary beings and noble ones. The conceptions under (3) cling to substance by virtue of not having realized identitylessness, while the conceptions under (4) cling to imputations by virtue of being embraced by the realization of identitylessness. In brief, since the main modes of apprehension of the fo ur conceptions about apprehender and apprehended in this context refer to what is to be adopted, what is to be rejected, those who rely on the paths, and the phenomena of the path, respectively, they are divided by way of the respectively nine isolates of terminating the seeds of said four modes of apprehension. 693 cz, p. 524. 694 The Tibetan has \"supreme\" (mchog) instead of \"desired\" (Skt. nikama). 695 This corresponds roughly to 03787, fo ls. 180b.4-5 and 181a.5-6. 696 Cz/p. 527. 697 03787, fo l. 182a.1-2. 698 03801, fo l. 186b.1-4. 699 03791, fol. 3llb.4-5; 03793, fols. 128b.7-129a.l. 700 03803, fo l. 189b.2-3. 701 PGSO (pp. 270-71) defines the culminating training of the uninterrupted path as \"the final yoga of bodhisattvas that, in its giving rise to the knowledge of all aspects as its direct result, cannot be interrupted by any other phenomena,\" which is instantiated by the wisdom at the end of the continuum. The definition of the focal objects of this culminating training is \"the phenomena that serve as the bases with regard to which the culminating training of the unin­terrupted path has to cut through superimpositions,\" which are instantiated by all phenomena that are characterized by being identityless. The definition of the aspect of said culminating training is \"its particular mode of apprehension that realizes its object,\" which is instantiated by the mode of apprehension of the culminating training of the uninterrupted path that real­izes emptiness. The definition of the dominant condition of this culminating training is \"that which gives rise to it primarily in an independent manner,\" which is instantiated by the mind­fulness right before the end of the continuum of not fo rgetting the fo cal objects and aspects of the two realities.

Seeming reality consists of appear­ances, while ultimate reality is their basic nature. The two realities are the same in nature, but different isolates because an ultimate reality that is different in nature from the seeming is not found, when analyzed through reasoning, and mind's manner of seeing does not exist as differ­ent. However, from the perspective of reasoning about the basic nature, the two realities cannot be analyzed as being the same or different at all because the Sa�pdhinirmocanasutra (in its third chapter) explains that there are four flaws in each possibility. If the two realitie�ere the same, it would follow that ultimate reality is seen through seeing the seeming; that, just as afflicted phenomena increase through focusing on the seeming, they increase despite focusing on the ultimate; that there is no ultimate to be searched for outside of the seeming; and that, just as seeming reality entails all kinds of reference points, the ultimate does so too. If the two reali­ties were different, it would follow that the ultimate is not the true nature of appearances, that the superimpositions of clinging to the real existence of appearances are not severed through realizing the ultimate, that the very fact of not finding the seeming through reasoning is not the ultimate, and that the increase of both afflicted and purified phenomena could happen simulta­neously since the former is caused by focusing on seeming reality and the latter, by focusing on ultimate reality. As for the subdivisions of the two realities, seeming reality is said to be classi­fied by both Pr8sailgikas and Svatantrikas as the correct and the false seeming (in terms of both subject and object). According to the Prasarigikas, the correct seeming in terms of the subject is the delusive mind in whose seeing the referents that appear for consciousness are not invali­dated through conventional valid cognition as being established in just the way they appear. The correct seeming in terms of objects consists of the objects that correspond to this mode of cognition. The false seeming in terms of subject and object consists of the opposites of these"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"786 Groundless Paths two. According to the Svatantrikas, the correct seeming is the seeming in which appearances and their being established in the manner they appear are not invalidated through valid cognition, that is, conventionally undeceiving phenomena. In terms of the subject, this includes cognitions that assess form and so on through relying on unimpaired sense faculties, the praji'ia of realizing identitylessness, and so on. The correct seeming in terms of objects consists of the specifically characterized phenomena that are the objects of these cognitions. The false seeming is the oppo­site of the correct one. In terms of the subject, it includes the cognitions with impaired sense faculties, the clinging to a personal self, and so on. In terms of the objects, it includes such as the reflection of the moon in water and what appears as a self for the conceptions about a self. The ultimate can be divided in two ways in terms of the phenomena that are its bearers and nominal concordance. As for the first one, the extensive division of ultimate reality consists of the twenty, eighteen, or sixteen emptinesses; the intermediate one, of the four emptinesses of entities, nonentities, self-entity, and other-entity; and the brief one, of the two emptinesses of being empty of a personal and phenomenal identity, respectively. The second division of the ultimate consists of the nominal ultimate (such as a sprout lacking arising) and the nonnominal ultimate (such as the naturally pure nature of phenomena that exists in each of its bearers). As for the valid cognitions that ascertain the two realities, the actual one that ascertains seeming reality corresponds to the wisdom of subsequent attainment in the mind streams of noble ones which realizes that conditioned phenomena appear and yet are empty of any nature. Ordinary instances of said valid cognition are such as the unmistaken sense consciousnesses. The actual valid cognition that ascertains ultimate reality corresponds to the wisdom of meditative equi­poise that realizes emptiness free from reference points. An ordinary instance is something like the inferential reasoning consciousness that, by virtue of the reasoning of being free from a real unity or multiplicity, realizes that appearances lack real existence. MCG (fols. 17b.2-18b.4) says that the basis of division is the sheer lack of nature or the mere reverse of what is not real. The definition of seeming reality is \"the phenomena that are not beyond mind and cannot with­stand analysis through correct reasoning.\" The definition of ultimate reality is \"the nature of phenomena that is beyond mind-the freedom from reference points in which all focal objects are at utter peace.\" The former is divided into the correct seeming (what appear as the objects of the unimpaired six sense faculties) and the false seeming (what appear through these being disturbed through impairments-such as the appearances of blurred vision). Ultimate reality is divided into the nominal ultimate (only having put an end to arising and so on, but not being lib­erated from the reference points of nonarising and so on) and the nonnominal ultimate (being liberated from all reference points of arising and nonarising and so on). In other words, seeming reality consists of everything that appears as the duality of subject and object and entails appre­hender and apprehended, while ultimate reality is the suchness free from reference points that is experienced by the wisdom of the noble ones in the manner of dualistic appearances having vanished. Therefore, the two realities that are taught by those who explain them through terms and are taken as the objects of study and reflection by the audience are suitable to be presented as two distinct realities in terms of the mind as the perceiving subject, but in terms of the fully qualified ultimate meditative equipoise of the noble ones, both are seeming. Hence, these two contexts must be distinguished. Next, MCG presents the eight flaws in terms of the two realities being the same on the level of the seeming or being different ultimately in literally the same way (except for the last one) as PGSD above. Therefore, ultimately, no referential characteristics of the two realities, such as their being the same or different, are accepted. However, convention­ally, in terms of the nominal ultimate, they are the same in nature, but different isolates. In terms of the nonnominal ultimate, they are merely different in the sense of negating being the same. Since, ultimately, the two realities cannot be divided by anything whatsoever, there is no differ­ence between them in the way things are, but they are different from the perspective of mind, just as unconditioned space is mentally divided into east and west."},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"Notes 787 717 PGSD (pp. 271-72) defines the wrong practices to be eliminated as \"either the wrong ideas of taking either one of the two realities as a reason and then attempting to invalidate the respective other one, or the statements of absurd consequences that are motivated by such wrong ideas.\" Said wrong ideas are instantiated by the conceptions of clinging to existence on the level of seeming reality and nonexistence on the level of ultimate reality as being mutually exclusive. The statements of absurd consequences like the disputes at hand here are instantiated by the sixteen misconceptions as presented in PSD above. When the latter are summarized, they are twofold-(1) disputes of trying to invalidate the ultimate by way of taking the route of the seeming and (2) disputes of trying to invalidate the seeming by way of taking the route of the ultimate. (1) The definition of the first one is \"the disputes to be eliminated here in which pri­marily an assertion on the level of the seeming is formulated as the reason.\" These are again twofold-( a) a dispute to be eliminated here that attempts to negate the ultimate by way of for­mulating an assertion on the level of the seeming as the reason would be \"It follows that conditioned and unconditioned phenomena exist by a nature of their own because they are ten­able as the focal objects of the knowledge of all aspects.\" (b) A dispute to be eliminated here that attempts to negate the seeming by way of formulating an assertion on the level of the seeming as the reason would be \"It follows that there is no mistaken state of mind of clinging to condi­tioned phenomena as being permanent because conditioned phenomena are presented as being impermanent\" (2) The definition of disputes of trying to invalidate the seeming by way of tak­ing the route of the ultimate is \"the consequences of trying to invalidate the seeming by way of formulating an assertion on the level of the ultimate as the reason.\" An example would be \"It follows that the focal objects of the knowledge of all aspects are not tenable because conditioned and unconditioned phenomena do not exist by any nature of their own.\" Such disputes are eliminated by the prajfli of discriminating the two realities and the pure reasonings that are motivated by this prajfii because it is explained that the former eliminates said wrong ideas (including their seeds), while the latter eliminates said disputes (including their objects). MCG (fols. 148a.4-150a.3) states that, contrary to the qualm of it being untenable that those who dwell in nonconceptual prajfiipiramiti equally engage in training in the other five piramitis, precisely such is very much tenable. Since the qualities of each piramiti equal all dimensions in terms of space and time, they are very hard to measure. Also, one should understand that the absolutely unequaled attainment of their being completely pure of stains is due to the power of dwelling in prajfiipiramiti. That is, if one does not understand that all phenomena are without nature and thus possesses the clinging to a personal self, one also possesses the antagonistic fac­tors of the piramitis (such as miserliness) that arise under the influence 5lf such clinging. Consequently, one is not able to engage in the kinds of giving and so on that are free from cling­ing and attachment. Even if one does not cling to phenomena as a personal self, but is not free from observing them as entities or nonentities, under the influence of clinging to sarp.sira and nirvil}.a as being what is to be rejected and to be adopted, respectively, one falls into the extreme of the peace of a one-sided nirviq.a. Also, one's accumulations that entail said observing of enti­ties or nonentities do not become utterly pure virtues because they are tainted by the ignorance of not being in tune with the true nature of phenomena. Therefore, the full perfection and purity of the other piramitis does not happen without the piramiti of prajfii. In the mind streams of bodhisattva& who are endowed with the piramiti of the prajfii of nothing being observable as any extreme whatsoever, there are no antagonistic factors such as miserliness and therefore they engage in generosity and so on without even the most subtle clinging to their bod­ies, possessions, and roots of virtue. They practice all piramitis in the manner of having no expectations about any rewards or pleasant karmic maturations and they are free from the stains of conceiving of the three spheres. In those who see the actuality of the prajfiipiramiti of not abiding in any extremes of entities, nonentities, sarp.sira, or nirviq.a in this way, a state of mind of abandoning sarp.sira and manifesting nirvil}.a will never arise. Though they see the true real­ity of unity free from reference points, they engage in generosity and so on for the sake of"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"788 Groundless Paths accomplishing the benefit and happiness of others who fail to see that true reality. Their engage­ment in the paramitas equals the numbers and scopes of all sentient beings and thus is immeasurable. Therefore, at the time of the path, bodhisattvas engage in the paramitas through fo cusing on the welfare of others in the manner of neither being weary about, nor clinging to, finishing the triad of completion, maturation, and purification. Then, at the time of the final fruition (the nirviU].a without remainder) they attain the wisdom kiya of not abiding in the extremes of either saJp.sira or ni�a by virtue of the true nature of phenomena and promote the welfare of sentient beings in a permanent, all-pervading, and effortless manner for as long as space exists. All of this is due to correctly engaging in prajftaparamita-the great equality of appearance and emptiness. If someone who sees emptiness-the unobservable nature of phe­nomena-stops practicing generosity and so on, the emptiness seen by that person is not the actuality of prajftaparamita. For it is nothing but a mere lack of entities, which contradicts the aspect of means. Even if it is labeled as unobservable, though it is not observed as an entity it is still observed as a lack of entities. Therefore, it is absolutely not the actuality of the prajftapiramita of being free from all extremes of observing and what can be observed. If the actuality of prajftaparamita represents something that weakens the clinging to the extremes of saJp.sara and ni�a even at the time of cutting through superimpositions through study and reflection, what need is there to speak about this being the case at the time of its being realized in a direct manner? If something like practicing even a fraction of generosity is embraced byprajftaparamita, all six paramitas are complete in it-by virtue of the antagonistic factors of the six paramitas (such as miserliness) being overcome by prajftaparamita, generosity alone (the aspect of means) also represents the nature of ethics and so on. Therefore, if the wisdom of realizing the freedom from reference points is divided by way of isolates, its abiding element is the paramita of dhyana, which represents the great dhyana in which all characteristics of abiding and nonabiding are terminated. Likewise, the remaining four paramitas are the great vigor of effortlessness, in which all vigor and nonvigor have subsided; the great patience of being completely unperturbed, in which all characteristics of patience and impatience have subsided; the great ethics of being free from all stains of corruption because anything that could be observed as corrupt or noncorrupt is terminated; and the great generosity that lacks even the most subtle attachment in terms of characteristics because attachment and detachment are not observable. Thus, since all these piramitas represent the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects, in which the element of appearance (generosity and so on) and the element of emptiness (the nature of prajfta) are in union, one should be skilled in the essential point of this being what embodies all paramitas. Since this is the crucial point of practicing prajnaparamita, one should be skilled in training in the profound prajftapiramita that is the union of means and prajfta. SZB (p. 333) says that the sixteen qualms here are eliminated through the essential point of the two realities not being contradictory. This means that, by virtue of something not existing ultimately, it is fully qualified as not existing ultimately, but it is not fully qualified as not existing on the level of the seeming-emptiness appears as dependent origination. By virtue of something existing on the level of the seeming, it is fully qualified as existing on that level, but it is not fully qualified as existing ultimately-dependently originating appearances abide as great emptiness. 718 cz, p. 550. 719 0391, fol. 140a.2-4. 720 03796, fol. 86a.4-86b.2. 721 I could not locate these explanations either in the Prajnapradipavali or the Sa'!'l-cayagathapanjika. 722 03787, fol. 188a.6-188b.4. 723 The Vrtti says, \"at the point of generating bodhicitta.\""},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":"724 03791, fol. 314a.1-2; 03793, fols. 129b.6-130a.2. 725 03796, fol. 88a.6-88b.2. 726 Ibid., fol. 88b.2-5. 727 This is another name of Avalokite5vara.

None of Haribhadra's com­mentaries comment in any way whatsoever on the recollection of deities. 729 PGSO (pp. 273-74) says that, according to Aryavimuktisena, the mahayana path of accu­mulation also constitutes the serial training because it is the training in familiarizing with the aspects of the three knowledges according to their order. According to Haribhadra, the serial training does not exist on the path of accumulation and the first moment of the level of heat because it must arise from the culminating training as its specific cause. Also, since the order of the four trainings represents an order in terms of causes and results, the serial training does not exist at the end of the continuum because there is no gradual familiarization with the aspects of the three knowledges at that point, but one familiarizes with them within a single instant. Therefore, the instances of the serial training consist of the knowledges from the second moment of the level of heat up through the last moment before the end of the continuum. The definition of the serial training in generosity is \"the serial training that is the yoga of bodhisat­tvas of gradually familiarizing with the qualities of generosity by way of their not being recollectable ultimately and recollecting them on the level of the seeming.\" The same applies for the other five paramitas. The definition of the serial training in recollecting the Buddha is \"the serial training that is the yoga of bodhisattvas of gradually familiarizing with the qualities of the Buddha by way of their not being recollectable ultimately and recollecting them on the level of the seeming.\" The same applies for the other five recollections. The definition of the serial train­ing in realizing the nature of the lack of entity is \"the serial training that is the yoga of bodhisattvas of gradually familiarizing with all phenomena through realizing that they lack any real entity.\" These thirteen serial trainings can be summarized into three-the consummate application (the six paramitas), the consummate motivation (the six recollections), and what makes both of these pure (the realization of the nature of the lack of entity). Or they can be summarized into five-the entities of the path (the six paramitas), the supports of the path (recollecting the three jewels), the branches of the path (recollecting ethics and giving), the wit­nesses for practicing the path (recollecting the deities), and what makes the path pure (the realization of the nature of the lack of entity). MCG (fols. 150b.1-153a.1) says that, though the complete training in all aspects also familiarizes with all aspects of the three knowledges in a complete manner, it is unlike the serial training in that the latter, by way of being embraced by all of its thirteen elements, entails the certainty of all the aspects of the three knowledges being complete, in their due order, in a single swoop. The six paramitas are the nature of the path (the consummate application), the six recollections are the supports that make the path special (the consummate motivation), and the nature of the lack of entity is what makes the path pure. As for the paramitas of generosity and ethics and the recollections of ethics and giving not being repetitious, in the context of the fo rmer one mentally engages in them in their actual form, while, in the context of the latter, one does so from the perspective of their fruitions. The recol­lections of the three jewels and deities are not repetitious either because the former are the supports of the path, while the latter are its witnesses. Though the 173 aspects of the three knowledges ultimately include all aspects of ground, path, and fruition without exception, it is not that the manner of familiarization of the serial training is unique merely by the fact that all"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"790 Groundless Paths of these aspects together appear in the mind in one swoop (this represents only the distant train­ing), just as the familiarization with entities, paths, and aspects being without arising implicitly includes all phenomena. Rather, the nature of the serial training it is as follows. From the per­spective of those who cling to duality, at the time when they familiarize with one phenomenon they do not know how to engage in any others. In order to dispel such ignorance, since each paramita includes the others, one is made to understand the manner in which uncontaminated phenomena are included in the special practice of means and prajfta being inseparable and the manner in which all piiramitas include all others, and this is done according to what was explained just above in the section on eliminating the wrong practices in the context of the cul­minating training of the uninterrupted path. Then, during subsequent attainment, by way of taking all aspects of the three knowledges in their due order or dealing with them separately, one practices without clinging in the manner of all paramitas being included in even a fraction of something like generosity. During meditative equipoise, through the power of being familiar with the true reality of all phenomena being of one taste, all the practices that are illustrated by the 173 aspects of the three knowledges can be induced and can appear gradually even within a single practice. It is the further and further increase of the experience of, and the certainty about, this special essential point that is called \"the serial training.\" Thus, it consists of the special man­ner of familiarization that is embraced by the special prajfta of knowing how to, even from within a single dharma, cut through superimpositions with regard to the entire variety of what is to be realized in terms of ground, path, and fruition. Thus, through each nature of the path (the paramitas) being associated with the six piramitas, all aspects of the path are included in said one swoop; through the three jewels as the supports of familiarization and the three meri­torious activities (recollecting ethics, giving, and deities), the aspects of the path are caused to increase further and further without decline; and, through realizing that, by virtue of the nature of their lack of entity, all phenomena are not different, the clinging to duality is relinquished. Therefore, even a single practice includes everything from cutting through superimpositions with regard to the ground up through the correct path and the fruition (such as the major and minor marks). By virtue of the focal objects and aspects of such practice becoming increasingly clear, they increase infinitely. Ultimately, this is the manner in which prajftapiiramita, through the power of equality, is able to make the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects a living experience. If prajftaparamita is able to familiarize, to the clearest degree possi­ble, with all aspects of the three knowledges within a single state of mind, this represents the gauge of accomplishment, which consists of the instantaneous training. If prajftapiiramita is able to bring up said aspects in this way in a gradual manner, this represents the phase of the serial training. Therefore, as exemplified by the practice of a single piiramiti being able to bring up the others, the serial training refers to the ability to gradually bring up, within the practice of a single swoop, all focal objects and aspects of cutting through superimpositions with regard to the ground, practicing the path, and the fruitions to be attained. Thus, one should not think that it merely refers to having to identify the correct number of aspects and then being able to have said number of aspects appear. For one starts with the aspects of the six paramitas and then, due to becoming familiar with them, there is an increase up through the 173 aspects of the three knowledges, which then increase further up through the infinite focal objects and aspects of all the limitless kinds of dharma gates without exception. Finally, during the instantaneous train­ing. one perceives the entirety of all uncontaminated phenomena. The suchness of one phenomenon is the suchness of all phenomena, and all phenomena are included in suchness, great equality. Therefore, in accordance with the progression in which the stains of the subject that focuses on this suchness become pure, through perceiving a single phenomenon one is able to perceive all phenomena. To understand that this is the case through the power of the nature of phenomena-the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects-is a very important essential point.

MPZL (pp. 177 -79) divides the thirteen elements of the serial training into ( 1) the vast serial training during subsequent attainment that is endowed with the six paramitas and (2) the profound serial train­ing of the nature of the lack of entity during meditative equipoise. (1) The actual serial training during subsequent attainment is that one, through the samadhis of subsequent attainment that entail appearances and by way of being embraced by the six paramitas (the vast means), gradu­ally familiarizes, in the manner of the trainings in nonabiding and nontraining, with the nature of the means (the seeming)-each one of the 173 aspects of the three knowledges-in such a way that their number and order are definite. Thus, the serial training that is endowed with the six paramitas is to complete, through training one's dexterity in samadhi, the accumulation of merit during subsequent attainment, which entails appearances. A1> for the six recollections that make the path special, they occur during subsequent attainment, but represent the aids of both the subsequent attainment and the meditative equipoise of the serial training. Through the power of cultivating the serial training over many lifetimes in the manner of alternating medita­tive equipoise and subsequent attainment, the path becomes special and thus one completes the two accumulations in three incalculable eons and so on. In order to do so, the six recollections are the pith instructions at the time of death of the profound practices of the path of the siitras, which represent the supreme essential point that is indispensable at the time when one recon­nects with other births. Throughout all one's lifetimes, one recollects the three jewels (the Buddha as the cause for having excellent teachers of the path; the dharma as the cause for the excellent nature of the path; and the satpgha as the cause for having excellent companions on the path) and the three meritorious actions (recollecting ethics as the cause for having excellent physical supports of the path; giving as the cause for having excellent favorable conditions on the path; and one's supreme deity as the cause for excellent backups on the path). (2) During the serial training of the nature of the lack of entity during meditative equipoise, through the samadhi of meditative equipoise that is without appearances and by way of being endowed with the three doors to liberation (profound prajiia), one familiarizes, in the manner of the trainings in nonabiding and nontraining, with the nature of the outcome of the means (the ultimate)­the entities that are the reference points which consist of the phenomena of entities, paths, and aspect as being all contained within the nature of the aspect of their nonarising. Thus, the serial training of the nature of the lack of entity is to complete, through purifying the path, the accu­mulation of wisdom during meditative equipoise, which is without appearances. Though it lacks any reference points in terms of a serial order, it is still referred to as \"serial training\" because it is the practice during meditative equipoise in the context of the serial training. In brief, the Buddha said in the siitras that the serial training represents the progression of mentally engag­ing in both the actuality of clear realization and the actuality of the essence (emptiness), which happens, from the level of engagement through aspiration up through right before the instanta­neous training, in the manner of alternating meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment and by way of familiarizing, through nonabiding and nontraining, with each one of all the aspects of the three knowledges (the vast means) during subsequent attainment and with their being included in the aspect of nonarising (profound prajiia) during meditative equipoise. However, there appear many ways in which others explain the serial training, such as saying that it consists of merely familiarizing with its thirteen elements in a gradual manner. AJ; for its boundary lines, according to Aryavimuktisena it exists from the path of accumulation up through the last moment before the end of the continuum, which bears the intention that it is cultivated in the manner of object generalities induced by studying and reflecting.

(3) The definition of the instantaneous training in terms of the lack of characteristics is \"the final yoga of bodhisattvas of being able to, upon realizing that a single phenomenon lacks real char­acteristics, realize that all phenomena that concord in type with it lack real characteristics.\" (4) The definition of the instantaneous training in terms of nonduality is \"the final yoga of bod­hisattvas of being able to, upon realizing that a single phenomenon lacks a real apprehender and apprehended, realize that all phenomena that concord in type with it lack the duality of a real apprehender and apprehended.\" The four instants of the instantaneous training can be summarized into two-the first two yogas of manifesting the qualities and the last two yogas of prajfta knowing what is to be known. MCG (fols. 153a.5-157b.4) says that the instantaneous training represents the single moment of wisdom (in the sense of the time it takes to complete an action) within which all knowable objects appear and are equally complete. Some explain that \"nonmatured\" refers to the buddha qualities (such as the ten powers) that have not matured before in one's own mind stream, while \"matured\" refers to the approximately concordant quali­ties from generosity up through the eighty minor marks that have already matured in one's mind stream, with both being explained as referring to objects. Others say that \"nonmatured\" refers to the familiarizations with effort up through the seventh bhlimi, while \"matured\" refers to the wisdom of not needing any effort. Yet others define this distinction as referring to ordi­nary beings and noble ones, respectively. Here, however, both \"matured\" and \"nonmatured\" are explained as being divisions by way of isolates of the cognizing subject that consists of the single instant of the uninterrupted path at the end of the continuum. For \"nonmatured\""},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"Notes 793 means that, through understanding the manner in which all uncontaminated phenomena are included by their nature in each one of them (such as generosity) on the paths of learning before, on these paths one has made efforts in becoming familiar with them in a complete and combined manner. Now, through the power of the final familiarity with such efforts, one is free from the mistakenness of apprehending entities one by one. Thus, the earlier nonmatured qualities arose from the serial training that occurred before the uninterrupted path at the end of the continuum, and it is in order to understand this that the instantaneous training in terms of nonmaturation is presented as a case of labeling the result with the name of its cause. Or it is referred to as \"the instantaneous training that arises from its nonmatured causes,\" just like the fruit of a seed. Just as in the example of an expertly crafted waterwheel, through the power of the full completion of one's earlier familiarization that involves effort, one is now able, with­out any effort, to manifest or perceive all phenomena once one manifests or perceives a single one. However, in its own nature, this present instant of the instantaneous training in term of nonmaturation represents maturation for the following reasons. Since the nature of a single phenomenon is the nature of all phenomena, the unitary nature of phenomena has no differ­ences, and this instant's mind as the cognizing subject of the nature of phenomena familiarizes with it in precisely this way. Also, one is propelled forward through having made efforts and having thought, \"May I manifest this in a single instant\" on the bhdmis, and one's accumulations have been completed. Through the power of all this, during this instant of the vajralike samadhi at the end of the continuum, in which all the favorable conditions for being able to see the profound nature of phenomena in exactly the way it is are complete, while its antagonistic con­ditions are absent, there is no gradual progression as in the serial training, but all aspects appear together simultaneously. For as long as one is affected by the latent tendencies of the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended one is not able to see the actuality of the great equality of all phenomena, just as it is. From the perspective of dualistic appearances, since there appear different phenomena, different times, and different natures of these phenomena, it is impossible to see the two realities of all knowable objects together. However, when the wisdom at the end of the continuum, which eradicates the latent tendencies of dualistic appearances, arises, it sees the ultimate actuality of equality. Through this, all phenomena without exception that are included in this equality are seen as being of one taste with it and it is impossible to stray away from this. This is called \"seeing the two realities together.\" Since arising and ceasing are not established within the basic true nature of phenomena, it cannot be presented through reference points in terms of characteristics such as earlier, later, and in-between-its nature is inconceivable. Nevertheless, from the perspective of those to be guided who are affected by dualistic appearances and for whom the three times appear as arising and ceasing, in terms of the self-appearances of knowing, and performing functions with regard to, the mind streams of those to be guided and phenomena that arise and cease, the knowledge of all aspects cannot be apprehended in any other way than appearing as if it were momentary. It is for that reason that the knowledge of all aspects is also presented as being impermanent. Thus, if one debates with childish beings and tirthikas in whom certainty about the mode of being of suchness has not arisen, one should explain the knowledge of all aspects in this way. When evaluating this through the actuality of the unarisen and unceasing kiya of self-arisen wisdom that, in its own nature, is inseparable from the nature of phenomena, the kiya of the nature of phenomena (the dharmatiikiya) is unchanging throughout all three times. Therefore, the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects is taught in the siitras as being unconditioned and permanent, and also described like that in the tantras. It exists in this way fo r the certainty that arises subsequent to having personally experienced the actuality of the profound nature of phenomena. Ultimately, Mii.lamadhyamahlkiirika XXV.13cd says: Nirviil;la is unconditioned. Entities and nonentities are conditioned."},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"794 Groundless Paths Accordingly, both conditioned entities that arise in dependence on other such entities and non­entities, which are conditioned by way of being imputed in dependence on certain entities, are conditioned. Even nonentities are established as conditioned due to their eliminating what is to be negated by them, but they are not established independently of that. Since they thus depend on something else, they are something temporary or conditioned. However, the great nirvaJ.ta of not abiding in the extremes of either entities or nonentities is of one taste with the nature of phenomena, in which there is nothing to be added or to be removed and which is therefore beyond thought and expression. Thus, the nature of phenomena abides primordially without needing to arise from any causes or be imputed based on any causes. As for nirvil)a seeming to arise from causes, it is labeled in this way merely by virtue of one's own conceptions of dualistic appearances coming to an end-just as the prajiiaparamiti sutras say many hundred times that, ultimately, all phenomena are nirvaJ.ta by nature and primordially luminous. Therefore, what is expressed as the wisdom kiya of a buddha is the great suchness of unity in which all stains have come to an end through the power of the path having eliminated the adventitious obscurations of the actuality of the natural nirvaJ.ta that is the great equality of sarpsira and nirvil}a. Thus, all uncontaminated phenomena are included in the nature of phenomena in that they are not different from, but equal with, it. Accordingly, if the path of manifesting this-the phase of the instantaneous training in terms of nonmaturation-has not been generated, its result-the instantaneous training in terms of maturation-does not arise. You may think, \"No matter how much one is familiar with nonmaturation, one is not able to give rise to the wisdom of matura­tion of seeing all knowable objects in a single instant.\" If all phenomena were really established as being different by way of their characteristics, it would not be established that, through mani­festing or perceiving one of them, all are manifested or perceived. However, since all phenomena share the same mode of being within the dhatu of the lack of characteristics, the suchness of the lack of characteristics is seen once it, through the path, has become free from the stains that obscure it. There is nothing that could be called \"an appearance that is other than such­ness\" -what is referred to as suchness is the unity of appearance and emptiness. Also, the single mode of being within the dhatu of great equality is something to be experienced personally by nondual wisdom, but is not something that apears from the perspective of those who cling to dualistic appearances. In this way, within the actuality of the nondual nature of phenomena (great equality), the wisdom that eradicates the latent tendencies of the clinging to duality is of the great equal taste of nonduality without subject and object. Consequently, what is called \"the knowledge of all aspects\" is the nature of the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects, the fruitional mother, the wisdom kiya that is all-pervading like space and beyond being made up by parts in terms of material particles or time. Here it is good to understand nonmatu­ration and maturation in terms of the existence and nonexistence, respectively, of causes-both the causal instant of nonmaturation of being propelled by previous familiarizations and the instant of maturation of phenomena and the nature of phenomena being one by their nature, which does not depend on any causes or efforts, represent divisions of the cognizing subject by way of isolates. Since all phenomena are nondual by nature, they are included in each other, and this fact is said to have \"matured\" in terms of the consummate familiarity with it. Even from the perspective of dualistic appearances and, naturally, by virtue of the lack of nature, there is no fragmentation in it and this equality of appearance and emptiness is the object of the instan­taneous training. When the nondual wisdom that is of one taste with this object is attained, all knowable objects are seen-together by virtue of the nature of phenomena. You may wonder, \"How are they realized by a single state of mind?\" It is in the manner of subject and object not being two. Ultimately, it is by virtue of the nature of the emptiness that is endowed with the supreme of all aspects and the wisdom of awareness (its subject) being inseparable, which is revealed in the manner of equality through the manifestation of the path that terminates the adventitious stains of dualistic appearances. SZB (p. 333) says that the instantaneous train­ing is equivalent to the culminating training of the uninterrupted path. Through realizing the"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"Notes 795 equality of appearance and emptiness, the first two divisions of the instantaneous training are in terms of the isolates of simultaneously accomplishing the two accumulations without alternat­ing them. The last two are in terms of the isolates of all objects being equality and the subject operating in the mode of dualistic appearances having vanished. It is by virtue of clinging to the two realities of appearance and emptiness in this context being contradictory that some people entertain the sixteen qualms in terms of attempting to refute the ultimate through the seeming and vice versa as presented in V.40-42. 737 III.12. 738 Verse 60. 739 III.1ab. 740 PGSO (pp. 277-78) says that the chapter on the dharmakaya is explained subsequent to the one on the instantaneous training because these two are connected as direct cause and result. The fo ur points that define the dharmakaya can be summarized into two-(1) the dharmakaya (one's own welfare) and (2) the nipakayas (the welfare of others), or (1) the kiya of the nature of phenomena and (2) the kiyas that bear this nature. (1) The first one is again twofold in terms of relinquishment (the svabhavikakiya) and realization (the wisdom dharmakaya). (2) The nipakayas are twofold in terms of appearing solely for pure beings to be guided (the sambhogikakiya) and appearing fo r all kinds of pure and impure such beings (the nairmil].ikakiya). 741 IX.65. 742 11.43. 743 Though this text says that the sambhogikakiya only appears to bodhisattvas on the tenth bhUmi (03796, fol. 96a.6), said divisions into five kiyas are explicitly said to be the positions of others (ibid., fo l. 101b.1-3). 744 03794, fo l. 251a.4-5. This text presents the division into five by quoting the Mllnjumnamasarpgiti and also mentioning the matured nairm81}ikakiya, but says that it does not contradict the division into fo ur. 745 Mllnjulrinamasarpgititflca (02534, fo l. 202b.4-5). 746 These five are mentioned throughout this author's Manjulrinamasarpgitivrtti (02533). 747 PGSO (p. 282) explains that (2) refers to the inseparability of dhatu and wisdom; (3), to the relinquishment of clinging to the two extremes of the reference points of identity and identitylessness; and (5), to the nature of the stainless and nonconceptual dharmadhatu. The definition of the svabhavikakiya is \"the result of freedom that is the dharmakaya (one's own welfare) and represents the nature of phenomena that is the final relinquishment.\" As for the meaning of final realization and relinquishment being inseparable, it is the very factor of freedom of the final realization being free from adventitious stains that represents the final real­ization. These two can only be divided mentally, but, ultimately, their nature is not different. In brief, the nature of phenomena that is endowed with twofold purity is the svabhiivikakiya because it is the kiya of the nature of phenomena that is endowed with twofold purity in the manner of being endowed with the qualities such as the powers and fe arlessnesses. MCG (fol. 158a.4-1 58b.4) says that the aspect of appearance (the uncontaminated phenomena such as the ten powers that have the nature of the wisdom of realization) and the aspect of empti­ness-the dhatu (the nature of phenomena of the unity of appearance and emptiness, which is primordially free from meeting and parting and has the character of manifesting as being pure of adventitious stains)-are what is called \"svabhavikakiya.\" This is the ultimate wisdom kiya of tathagatas. This kiya is not merely the aspect of emptiness or the dhatu-at the time of the"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"796 Groundless Paths ground, the sheer aspect of emptiness is not the ultimate nature of phenomena, nor is it the buddhahood at the time of the fruition. For the explanation by the scholars of the past that not even an atom of buddha qualities (such as knowledge) exists in a mere nonimplicative negation concords with the fa cts, while the svabhivikakaya is connected to the realization of a buddha. Also, a nonimplicative negation is by definition not suitable as a cognition, let alone the one of a buddha. As Bodhicaryavatara IX.68cd says: However, if it is cognizing because it possesses mind, It fo llows that its lack of cognizing is invalidated. This is called \"the svabhavikakaya of the nature of phenomena\" or, in other siitras, \"the vajra­like wisdom kiiya,\" which is the result of freedom that serves as the basis of all uncontaminated qualities. 748 PGSO (pp. 277-78 and 283-85) says that the dharmakiiya has five distinctive fe atures. (1) Its nature is to consist of the minds and mental factors without the duality of apprehender and apprehended-the Aloka (03791, fo l. 318a.1) and the Vivrti (03793, fo l. 133a.5) say that it arises from nondual minds and mental factors. (2) Its fe ature of being the total change of state is that it is free from all contaminations that consist of the factors to be relinquished-the Aloka (ibid., fo l. 317b.1-2) and the Vivrti (ibid., fo l. 133a. 1) say that everything that operates by virtue of the change of state is designated as the dharmakiiya. (3) Its fe ature of activity is that, through the unceasing appearance of the two riipakiiyas as appearances of others, the welfare of sentient beings is promoted-the Aloka (ibid., fol. 323b.3-4) and the Vivrti (ibid., fol. 138a.5) say that, on the level of seeming reality, the appearances of the siimbhogikakiiya and so on are generated by wisdom alone. (4) The fe ature of whose object it is means that it is the unique and direct experiential sphere of buddhas alone-the Aloka (ibid., fol. 16b.4) and the Vivrti (ibid., fo l. 131b.4-5) say that the presentation of how it represents the experiential spheres of buddhas, bodhisattvas, srii vakas and so on is given due to their respective manners of aspiring for the ultimate nature of phenomena on the level of the seeming. (5) As for the fe ature of its causes, its general cause is the accumulation of wisdom. Its specific causes are the causes of the fo ur wisdoms as in Mahayanasutrala111kara IX.76-retaining (mirrorlike wisdom), equanimity (wisdom of equality), elucidating the perfect dharma (discriminating wisdom), and accom­plishing activities (all-accomplishing wisdom). The definition of the dharmakiiya is \"the final knowledge of directly realizing all knowable objects.\" This is equivalent to the knowledge of all aspects, omniscience, and buddha wisdom, and it is divided into the above four wisdoms. The definition of mirrorlike wisdom is \"the final wisdom of directly realizing that all phenomena appear, but lack any nature of their own, just like reflections appearing in a mirror.\" The defini­tion of the wisdom of equality is \"the final wisdom of directly realizing that all phenomena of sa!psiira and nirviil}a are equality in that they lack real existence.\" The definition of discrimi­nating wisdom is \"the final wisdom of directly and distinctly realizing all phenomena in their entirety without mixing them.\" The definition of all-accomplishing wisdom is \"the final wisdom of accomplishing the welfare of all sentient beings without exception.\" Therefore, they are one in nature and only divided by way of isolates. As for the manner in which the dharmakiiya cognizes knowable objects, buddha wisdom simultaneously knows all past, present, and future phenomena in terms of both suchness and variety. In brief, the twenty-one sets of uncontami­nated buddha wisdom are the wisdom dharmakiiya of realization because it is the final wisdom of the change of state of everything contaminated having become uncontaminated. As for the dharmakiiya being all-pervading, it may be objected, \"It fo llows that the dharmakiiya functions as the dominant condition for buddhakiiyas appearing for all sentient beings because it is always endowed with the great loving-kindness and compassion of promoting the welfare of sentient beings.\" The answer to that is taught through the reason why it appears only for those with the appropriate karmic fo rtune (AA VIII.9) and the example for it not appearing to those who lack said fo rtune (AA VIII.IO). As for the dharmakiiya being both all-pervading and permanent,"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"Notes 797 it may be objected, \"It follows that it is not suitable to describe the dharmakaya as 'all-per­vading' because it exists only in the distinct mind streams of certain yogins such as Buddha Sakyamuni. Nor is it suitable to be described as 'permanent' because it perishes in a momentary manner.\" The answer to that is given in AA Vlll.ll. MCG (fols. 158b.6-6 and 167b.4-168a.2) says that the aspect of buddhahood that is the single wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects in all its aspects represents the wisdom dharmakaya, which is divided into the twenty-one sets of uncontaminated qualities. When the dharmakaya and the svabhavikakaya are taken to be one, in terms of the aspect of liberation that is endowed with twofold purity, the kaya of wisdom and dharmadhatu being nondual is the svibhavikakaya. In terms of the isolate of its aspect of knowledge (the twenty-one sets of uncontaminated qualities), it is presented as the dharmakaya. Apart from that, ultimately, there is no difference in the sheer wisdom kaya of the unity of dhatu and wisdom that is endowed with twofold purity. Therefore, there is also the assertion that the four points that define the dharmakaya as the eighth topic of the AA consist of dharmakaya, simbhogikakiya, nairmil}ikakiya, and enlightened activity. However, since enlightened activity is the enlightened activity of the dharmakaya, both realization and enlightened activity repre­sent the buddhadharmas of the effortless welfare of oneself and others. Therefore, here, without counting enlightened activity separately, it is the very four kayas that are explained as represent­ing the four points that define the topic of the dharmakaya. 749 ll.51-52. 750 03804, fol. 239b.5. 751 According to JNS (vol. 2, p. 471), the conventional expression of the simbhogikakiya being endowed with \"the five certainties\" (see below) was coined by way of inferring them from the meaning of Madhyamakavatara Xl.18ff. PGSD (pp. 291-92) explains the five distinctive features of the sambhogikakiya in terms of body, speech, mind, activity, and way of appearing according to Uttaratantra ll.40. In due order, they refer to possessing a body of light rays with the major and minor marks, enjoying all kinds of mahayana dharmas, possessing the compas­sion of liberation that makes efforts for the welfare of others, its activity being effortless (just like a wish-fulfilling gem), and appearing as all kinds of colors and shapes, but not being estab­lished as these characteristics. The definition of the simbhogikakiya is \"the ultimate nipakaya that is endowed with the five certainties.\" The five certainties are the certainties of (1) nature [usually referred to as \"body\"] (being adorned with the major and minor marks), (2) dharma (teaching only the mahayana), (3) retinue (solely bodhisattvas on the ten bhlimis), (4) place (soley the pure buddha realm of Richly Adorned Akan�tha), and (5) time (remaining until sarpsira is emptied). The simbhogikakiya is twofold-the mere simbhogikakiya that appears to all bodhisattvas on the bhlimis and the fully qualified one that is the sphere of those from the tenth bhfuni onward. Note that, in general, there are three kinds of Akani�tha-(a) the ultimate Akan�tha (the formless state of the dharmakiya), (b) the Richly Adorned Akani�tha (the sphere in which the simbhogikakiyas manifest), and (c) the highest pure level of the form realm (a natural sphere of nairmil}ikakiyas). On this, PGSD (pp. 293-94) says that, in terms of the con­ventional presentation, the location in which bodhisattvas on the last bhlimi become buddhas is known as (b) \"the Great Mighty Akani�tha.\" It is located at a place twice as high from the earth as the Akani�tha in the form realm. In terms of the actual true nature, once bodhisattvas at the end of the tenth bhlimi manifest the simbhogikakiya, through all impure mistaken appearances ceasing the very realm in which they are becomes a pure realm, and it is just this which is called \"Akani�tha.\" Therefore, the Akani�tha that was just described as existing above the Akani�tha among the pure abodes of the form realm is the Akani�tha that is the pure abode in which the reality of the first bhfuni is seen, whereas the actual \"location\" in which one becomes a buddha is said ultimate Great Akani�tha. Therefore, it is with the intention of these Akani�thas having to be manifested progressively that the presentation of higher and lower ones is made."},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"798 Groundless Paths 752 PGSO (pp. 294-95) says that, according to Uttaratantra 11.41, the nairm�ikakiya has four distinctive fe atures. First, it introduces those to be guided into the path to n�a. Then, it matures them in the mahayana. Finally, it prophesies their enlightenment. In order to do all this, its enlightened activity is uninterrupted. The definition of the nairm�ikakiya is \"the ultimate rtipakaya that directly promotes the welfare of sentient beings by way of all kinds of physical fo rms in all kinds of worldly realms.\" Some texts say that the rtipakayas represent buddha­hood, while the Suva17,1aprabhasasutra explains that they do not. Certain other sources say that buddhahood does not exist. These positions represent the expedient meaning, the temporary definitive meaning. and the final definitive meaning, respectively. In due order, they mean that, on the level of seeming reality, the rtipakayas are the kayas that promote the welfare of sentient beings; actually, also the rtipakayas have the nature of wisdom; and, ultimately, what are called \"buddhas\" and \"sentient beings\" are not observable as different. 753 0275, fo l. 37a.5-6. Originally, the teachings of the siitrayina proper presented the pure dharmadhatu and said fo ur wisdoms. The fifth wisdom (\"dharmadhatu wisdom\") belonged originally to the fivefold classification of wisdom in the vajrayana, which eventually also became incorporated in the siitrayina. 754 IX.67. 755 IX.68. 756 IX.69. 757 Mahayanasutrala�pkarapka (04029, fol. 74b.2-3). 758 IX.70-71ab. 759 IX.72. 760 IX.74. 761 IX.76. 762 See TOK, vol. 3, p. 607 (Appendix VI in Brunnholzl2011). 763 03801, fol. 203b.l. 764 As explained above, this refers to qualities (13)-(15) among the eighteen unique buddha qualities (03791, fo l. 182a.6-7; 03793, fo l. 107b.5). 765 PGSO (pp. 298-300) defines enlightened activity as \"the pure actions that arise from buddhahood as their dominant condition.\" It can be divided in fo ur ways. When divided by way of its objects, the twenty-sevenfold enlightened activity that is taught in the AA is three­fold in terms of establishing those to be guided in the support of the path, the path itself. and the fruition of the path. When enlightened activity is divided in terms of examples, according to Uttaratantra IV.l 3ff., it is ninefold-the display of bodies resembles the one of Indra and Brahma; the excellent instructions of speech, the great drum of the gods; the mind being per­vaded by knowledge and compassion, a cloud; the display of physical emanations, the one of Brahma; the radiating of wisdom, the sun; the secret of the body, a gem; the secret of speech, an echo; the secret of mind, space; and the manner in which compassion operates, the earth. In brief, enlightened activity consists of the activities of body, speech, and mind. When divided in terms of supports, it is twofold-the enlightened activity that exists in its agent corresponds to the knowledge of a buddha and the one that exists in its recipients or objects corresponds to the roots of virtue of those sentient beings who have confidence in the buddhas. When divided in terms of its manners of engagement, it is twofold-effortless and uninterrupted. According to Uttaratantra IV.l, it is effortless by way of five distinctive fe atures because it effortlessly engages in knowing all the divisions of the constitutions of those to be guided, knowing the means to"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"Notes 799 guide them, establishing them in higher realms and n�a (the activities of guiding them), and arriving at the appropriate places and times in order to guide them. According to Uttaratantra IV.l2, enlightened activity engages in an uninterrupted manner for three reasons-during the paths of learning before, having taken the vow to promote solely the welfare of others; seeing that oneself and all sentient beings are equal in possessing the sugata heart; and enlightened activity not being fully completed until the saJpsara of those to be guided has been emptied. In brief, according to Uttaratantra I.76, enlightened activity engages by way of having four distinc­tive features. Its nature is to do whatever benefits whatever beings are to be guided; its aspect, to be effortless (without any characteristics of effort); its time, to last until saipsara has been emptied; and its vastness, to pervade all sentient beings throughout the reaches of space. 766 XV.2ab. 767 This refers to the Sanskrit ca (Tibetan dang) at the end of this line, which is simply a verse filler. However, it is not uncommon in the Tibetan tradition to read all kinds of things into this kind of \"and.\" As explained below, \"the two knowledges\" refers to the knowledges of entities and the path. 768 04049, fol. 112b.5-6. 769 VIII.36ac. 770 Originally, as indicated under 5da) below, the last one refers to light. 771 03787, fol. 193b.2-5. 772 From here on, the presentation of the totalities is based on the explanations in the Vrtti (03787, fols. 193b.5-196a.l). 773 As explained below, most commentaries on the AA do not mention any specifics about the totality of earth. PGSO (p. 287) says that its focal object can be something like a bridge in a lake or ocean. Traditional abhidharma sources speak of using a disc made of clay as one's focal object. 774 The Vrtti speaks of these two places as unsuitable places, which makes more sense. 775 This means that one takes the respective physical focal object as one's model, looking at it for a while. Then, one visualizes it internally, gradually imagining that the entire world appears like that. As an aid to focusing on the physical and the mental image, one also repeats the name (or one of the epithets) of the respective object. Some sources also include the step of closing one's eyes and focusing on the retinal image that occurs after having looked at the outer object for an extended period. 776 Note that the last two signs, in due order, refer to light/consciousness and space. 777 04035, fol. l42a.3. 778 Ibid., fol. l4lb.6-7. 779 Ibid., fols. l4lb.7-l42a.l. 780 Such a statement is not found in the Abhidharmasamuccaya. The only phrase that could be interpreted that way (and seems to be so in the Chinese version) is 04049, fol. ll2b.7. 781 03787, fol. l96a.l. 782 PGSO (pp. 286-89) defines the totalities as \"the samadhis with their congruently associ­ated factors that rely on either the actual dhyanas or formless absorptions as their dominant condition and are able to pervade all knowable objects with their respective primary focal objects.\" In terms of their focal objects, they can be summarized into four since the first four focus on the ayatana of tangible objects; the next four, on the ayatana of form; and the last two,"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"800 Groundless Paths on the ayatanas of phenomena and consciousness, respectively. The reasons for presenting the ayatanas of tangible objects and form as totalities are that they pervade everything in terms of oneself and others and that one is able to make them pervade all realms that have fo rm. In particular, the four elements are presented as totalities because, without the elements as the sup­ports, one cannot pervade everything with elemental derivatives (the supported). Within the ayatana of phenomena, space is presented as a totality because it pervades everything animate and inanimate. Consciousness is presented as a totality because it is the cognizing subject of all knowable objects and represents the types of mind that have a continuum. The five sense facul­ties are not presented as totalities because they cannot be caused to pervade everything external and are not subjects that are able to apprehend other phenomena. Smell and taste are not pre­sented as totalities because they cannot be caused to pervade the two higher realms since they are included in the desire realm alone. Sound and mental factors are not presented as totalities because they lack a continuum. Among the signs of not yet having accomplished the totalities, earth appears to be split into lumps. The four colors appear as mutually exclusive, that is, in mul­ticolored objects such as flowers only the color on which one fo cuses in the respective totality appears. Consciousness appears to be obstructive like a maJ}qala made of earth (the others are as above). AJJ for the signs of accomplishment, one is able to cause earth to pervade everything in an unfragmented manner; water, to be unmoving and pervade other things; fire, to pervade other things like a round red moon in the sky; the fo ur colors, to pervade other things like a fan of gems; space, to pervade everything like the expanse of the sky; and consciousness, to illu­minate everything that has form with a vast mass of light (wind is as above). In due order, the functions of having cultivated the totalities of water, fire, and consciousness, respectively, are to be able to walk on water, emanate the fire that is able to bum the palaces of miras, and make heavy fo rms light and distance oneself from sleep and dullness (the others are as above). 783 The following is based on the Abhidharmako$abhaga on VIII.35a. See also the eight lib­erations as explained above under \"the path of manifesting\" and \"the path of blissfully abiding\" in 2.2.2.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.3.2.2.

According to CZ (pp. 653 and 654), the section on the ayatanas of overpowering is missing in the slitra in eighteen thousand lines, while the one as described here is from the slitra in twenty-five thousand lines. PGSD (pp. 289-91) defines the iyatanas of overpowering as \"the samadhis with their congruently associated factors that rely on the actual dhyinas as their dominant condition and are able, through the power of being preceded by the liberations with form, to overpower other phenomena with the fo rms that represent their respective fo cal objects.\" Just as in the case of the corresponding among the eight liberations above, the inner looker entertaining the notion of having or not having form means that, from the perspective of others, the yogins who emanate certain objects appear or do not appear, respectively. AJJ for the differences between the eight liberations, the eight ayatanas of overpowering, and the ten totalities, during the first, one regards one's focal objects as being all kinds of beautiful and ugly objects. During the second, one is additionally able to overpower other phenomena through these objects. During the third, one is able to cause a single spe­cific fo cal object to pervade all phenomena. Therefore, according to the Abhidharmakosabh�ya (04091, fo ls. 80b.7-81a.1) the respectively latter arise on the grounds of the respectively fo rmer. 786 PGSD (p. 291) defines the samadhi of dispassion as \"the samadhi of nonleamers with its congruently associated factors that relies on the actual dhyanas as its dominant condition and relinquishes the afilictive obscurations.\" It is twofold-the samadhi of dispassion of sravakas is said samadhi in the mind streams of sravakas who are nonleamers, such as the knowledge in the mind streams of arhats who are liberated through both prajiia and samadhi. The samadhi of dispassion of buddhas is said samadhi in which both obscurations and their latent tendencies"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"Notes 801 have been relinquished, which corresponds to the knowledge of all aspects. Thus, the latter is superior to the former because it is the final samadhi that eradicates the afflictions in the mind streams of others to be guided. 787 Due to the structure of Tibetan sentences, LSSP/PSD say \"at the end.\" 788 As mentioned above under the six unique qualities of a buddha in terms of conduct, arhats still may show such forms of conduct since they have not relinquished all latent tenden­cies of the afflictions. 789 Both theAloka (03791, fol. 317b.1-2) and the Vivrti (03793, fols. 132b.7-133a.1) present this as the position of some (according to LSSP, mainly Haribhadra's teacher Vairocanabhadra) and then support it versus the more literal reading of AA VIII.2-6 by others which takes the uncontaminated qualities as belonging to the svabhiivikakiiya (see right below). 790 This paragraph is based on the Aloka (03791, fols. 317b.S-318a.6) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 133a.1-7), which refer to the Vrffi and others as asserting three kayas. 791 PGSD (pp. 296-98) adduces the Kayatrayasutra and Uttaratantra Il.43 as the scrip­tural supports for asserting three kayas, with the former speaking of the dharmakaya as the naturally pure buddhakaya; the siimbhogikakaya as the pure samadhi of a buddha; and the nairmiil}ikakiya as the pure conduct of a buddha. As for the manner in which the AA teaches three kayas, it teaches each one of them by way of a brief introduction and a detailed explana­tion. Accordingly, the nature of the svabhiivikakiiya is taught briefly through VIII.l and the details of its uncontaminated qualities, through VIII.2-6. The nature of the siimbhogikakiya is taught briefly through VIII.12 and the details of the major and minor marks, through VIII.13-32. The naNI\"e of the nairm�ikakiya is taught briefly through VIII.33 and the details of its enlightened activity, through VIII.34-40. Following Aryavimuktisena, this is what Yagton, Rongton, and others hold. As for the scriptural support for there being four kayas, PGSD curi­ously adduces the above quote from the Buddhabhumisutra (0275, fol. 37a.S-6) on buddhahood consisting of five dharmas-the completely pure dharmadhatu, mirrorlike wisdom, the wisdom of equality, discriminating wisdom, and all-accomplishing wisdom, which is said to be further explained in the MahayanasutriJlal'flkara (see above). Even more curious as a scriptural support for four kayas is PGSD's citation of MahayanasutriJlal'flkara IX.60, which describes \"the manner in which the dhatu exists as three\": The svabhavika[kaya], the sambhogikakiya, And the other one, the nairm�ikakiya, Are the divisions of the kayas of the buddhas. The first one is the foundation of the [other] two. PGSD continues by saying that the existence of four kayas also represents the position of master Haribhadra since hisAloka (03791, fol. 316a.6) and Vivrti (03793, fol. 131b.l) say that buddha­hood is fourfold, such as the svabhiivikakiiya. Also, the Vivrti (ibid., fols. 131b.6 and 138a.2) says that the dharmakaya is taught as the second kaya after the first one and that the nairm�ikakiya is taught as the fourth one after the other three kayas. Thus, following Vairocanabhadra, many scholars assert four kayas. As fo r which of these two positions is tenable, in terms of the con­ventional presentation, four kayas are tenable because the dharmakaya as one's own welfare is twofold (relinquishment and realization) and the nipakaya as the welfare of others is also twofold (siimbhogikakiya and nairm�ikakiya). However, in terms of the actual way of being, three kayas are tenable because the dharmakaya has three aspects-the aspect of being pure of all adventitious stains without exception, the aspect of appearing as the siimbhogikakaya solely from the perspective of pure beings to be guided, and the aspect of appearing as all kinds of physical manifestations from the perspective of all kinds of beings to be guided. It is by virtue of this that it is presented as three kayas. Consequently, in this system, also the two nipakayas must"},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"802 Groundless Paths be accepted as having the nature of wisdom for the following reasons.

It is the sambhoga-buddhahood Since the reflection of wisdom arises. Oharmamitra explains the nairmiil)ikakiya as all-accomplishing wisdom and the Alokii (03791, fol. 323b.3-4) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 138a.5) say that, on the level of seeming reality, the appearances of the siimbhogikakaya and so on are generated by wisdom alone. In brief, if one divides the buddhakiiya, it is definite as being threefold because it is definite as being the dharmakiiya, the sambhogikakaya, and the nairmiil)ikakiya. 792 CZ, p. 653. 793 11.98. 794 This is the Indian fig tree, also called banyan tree. 795 LSSP (fols. 247b.6-248a.1) says, \"the five of his belly being slender, unmarred, and round, and his navel being deep and winding to the right\" 796 03903, fol. 286a.4-5. 797 Ibid., fol. 286a.5. 798 Note that the Munimatiila'!'lkiira (ibid., fol. 286a.6) says something different: \"When the entire sole is taken as being four parts, the foot is three parts and the heel is one part, thus being well proportioned.\" 799 03787, fo l. 200b.5 and 03788, fol. 170a.2. 800 Ordinary humans are said to be three-and-a-half cubits tall (one cubit being the span between one's own elbow and fingertips). 801 03796, fol. 87b.7.

The Tibetan of the Aloka (03791, fol. 321a.6) and the Vivrti (03793, fol. 137a.2-3) has dku in connection with \"round,\" \"slender,\" and \"umarred,\" but phyal (\"belly\") in relation to \"smooth.\" This wording is followed by LSSP/PSO, but dku is taken to refer to the waist (rked) as opposed to the belly. 818 The Sanskrit bimba can refer to both the plant Momordica monadelpha and its red ber­ries.

The three fetters, which are the afflictive factors to be relinquished through seeing, are the views about a real personality, the views that hold ethics and spiritual disciplines as paramount, and doubt. Through the first one, one is afraid of liberation and thus fettered by not wanting to pro­ceed on the path. Through the second one, one takes what is not the path to be the path and thus is fettered by taking the wrong path. Through doubt about the path, one obstructs liberation too. The five fetters consist of two sets-those in accordance with the desire realm (the above three fetters plus striving desire and malice) and those in accordance with the two higher realms (desire in the form realm and desire, agitation, dullness, and pride in the formless realm). 822 These are a mirror, yogurt, Panicum dactylon grass, wood-apple fruits, a right-coiling conch shell, elephant bile, vermilion powder, and white mustard. 823 III.2-8. The last verse is only found in the Tibetan version of the Ratnavali, not in the Sanskrit one.

MCG (fol. 170a.3-170b.6) summarizes the eighth chapter as follows. The spontaneous presence of the four kiiyas and enlightened activity represents the path of liberation of the vajralike samiidhi. Through having attained this ultimate change of state, the wisdom kiiya in the utterly pure realm of Akani,tha-the immeasurably vast palace of the dharmadhiitu-abides as the siimbhogikakaya with the major and minor marks, which takes care of the sentient beings with the purest mind streams (the bodhisattvas on the tenth bhiimi) through maturing them with the mahayana dharma. The nature of this is the mind stream of a buddha-the sviibhiivikakaya of dhiitu and wisdom being inseparable. It holds the nature of the wisdom kiiya, whose nature is to not be different from all the buddhas in the three times, and it displays all kinds of nairmil;likakayas that guide beings as appropriate. Thus, it takes care of all the 5aJ11ghas of those who have the dispositions of the three yiinas. This vajralike wisdom kiiya accomplishes all sarpsiiric and nirvil;lic benefits of sentient beings through its twenty-sevenfold enlightened activity in an effortless and nonconceptual way. 831 03801, fol. 203b.4-5. 832 03791, fol. 339b.1-2. Note that the Vrtti (03787, fol. 210a.4) and the Varttika (03788, fol. 179b.2) also say that \"cause\" in AA XI.2a refers to \"the four trainings\" in VIII.2b. However, Haribhadra's Vivrti (03793, fol. 140a.1) links \"the threefold object\" in AA XI.2a with \"cause,\" which is followed by most Tibetan commentaries (including PGBG, MCG, and MPZL) and also suggested by the most straightforward reading of VIII.2ab (though the Sanskrit and the Tibetan are not entirely unambiguous on this point). Moreover, since said lines appear in exactly the same way in all of the above texts, the issue of whether \"cause\" is matched with \"object\" or \"training\" is obviously not a translation problem (which thus would also apply to the Vivrti as the otherwise unquestioned authority in Tibetan commentaries), but a matter of different inter­pretations. Note that, right below in LSSP/PSO and differing from what they say here, the three knowledges are described as the causes of the dharmakiiya. 833 This is the name that is fo und in the Taipei edition of LSSP.

It is called \"pith instruction\" because it makes one understand this subject matter swiftly and makes one realize the vast meaning of the siitras in an easy way through a few words. It is called a \"treatise\" because, upon being studied and reflected on, it is able to restore the afflicted mind streams of those to be guided and protect them from the lower realms. It is called \"clear realization\" because the eight topics of facing true reality and realizing it, just as it is, represent its main subject matter. Also, it is both a clearly illuminating and a beautifying ornament because it clearly illuminates the words and the meanings of the prajiiaparamita siitras and beautifies all the meanings of these siitras. 837 Lines 2bd. 838 PGBG (p. 311) says that the purpose of providing the Sanskrit title is to demonstrate that this text has a noble source, create imprints of this language, and make blessings enter the mind stream. The purpose of providing the title in Tibetan is to show that it is equivalent to the Sanskrit, understand that the translators and pal}<).itas were both scholars and siddhas since they translated it without mixing it up, and remember the kindness of the translators who rendered what is difficult to understand in Sanskrit into Tibetan in a manner that is easily understandable. The purpose of the homage by the translators is to be able to complete the translation. 839 The translation of the stanzas of the AA follows the Sanskrit, with the occasional signifi­cant differences to the Tibetan version being indicated in the endnotes. Here the Tibetan has \"being endowed with her\" (gang dang yang dag ldan). 840 At the beginning of each section of explaining the verses of the AA, PBG usually only adduces a few of the respective beginning and concluding syllables or says that this section is taught through so and so many verses, beginning with \" ... \" In order to facilitate following the subsequent commentary, the translation provides the respective lines of the AA in their entirety. 841 This is another word for nirvil}a. 842 PGBG (p. 312) and MCG (fol. 6a.6) identify the two types of the utter peace of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas as the nirvil}as with and without remainder. PGBG concludes that there is a reason for Maitreya paying homage to the mother as the three knowledges because it is the mother in the form of the three knowledges who accomplishes all that her four children desire. 843 The AA contains many very terse, ambiguous, and cryptic verses, with the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions moreover differing at times. In these two verses, I attempted to mirror the order of the lines in Sanskrit, but since the commentary is based on the Tibetan, I largely adopted the meaning of the Tibetan (that these verses can be read in several ways is amply highlighted by the many different ways in which both Indian and Tibetan commentaries explain them). The main difference here lies in lines 1.2a-c, where the Sanskrit says, \"Having committed to memory the meaning of the siitras, may they easily progress in the tenfold practice of the dharma\" (smrtau cadhaya sittrartha'TI dharmacaryti'TI da5atmikam/ sukhena pratipatsirann iti). 844 MCG (fol. 7b.3-4) explains the implicitly taught connection as the fact that the realiza­tion of the knowledge of all aspects depends on knowing the meaning of the mother, which in tum depends on this treatise. 845 For MCG's and MPZI:s definitions of the eight points and the seventy topics, which rep­resent their respective glosses on AA 1.3-17, see Appendices VII and VIII."},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"806 Groundless Paths 846 According to MPZL (p. 19), the generation of bodhicitta consists of the special means and prajna that are endowed with the two welfares-it is the desire for completely perfect enlightenment (which comes about through prajiia) for the welfare of others (which comes about through the means that is compassion). This generation of bodhicitta is expressed accord­ing to the sutras-in brief, by way of its definition and, in detail, by way of its instances and their examples. 847 It is not clear what PBG means by \"the five special paths.\" Based on the Alolca's (p. 26) statement that the order of the twenty-two generations of bodhicitta represents the order in which true actuality is realized, LSSP (fol. 1llb.3-4) asserts that (15)-(19) refer to the special path of the tenth bhftmi alone. However, when commenting directly on (15)-(19), the Alolca (p. 26) does not specify the tenth bhUmi-all that it says is that \"these five consist of the special paths among the bodhisattvabh\\imis.\" 848 As LSSP (fols. 140b.4-141a.4) elaborates, the aspect of practice consists of its nature; its object, of the four realities; its foundation, of the three jewels; and its causes, of relinquish­ing adverse conditions (the three kinds of vigor) and bringing about favorable conditions (the visions, the supernatural knowledges, and the paths of seeing and familiarization). MPZL (p. 23) glosses the three types of laziness above as the adverse conditions for entering the path in the beginning, practicing it in the middle, and completing it at the end, respectively. The six super­natural knowledges and the five visions represent the common and uncommon aids of the path, respectively. The path of seeing is the direct seeing of the actuality of the basic nature not seen before and the path of familiarization represents the repeated familiarization with the actuality of this nature that was seen already. 849 The last six lines in Tibetan are somewhat different: A protecting bodhisattva's Character of heat and so on accordingly Is based on being associated with the four conceptions. [Its] lesser, medium, and great [degrees] Are more distinguished than Those of �ravakas and rhinolike ones. 850 Following the Vivrti, like most other commentaries, PGBG (p. 320), MCG (fol. 27a.2-27b.4) and MPZL (pp. 29-30) speak of only the first five distinctive features of the path of preparation listed here. MCG glosses the four realities in (1) as being illusionlike and explains (2) as the phenomenal identitylessness of cutting through clinging to these four realities and being free from the thirty-two superimpositions (such as impermanence and permanence) onto them. According to MPZL, (1) the focal objects represent what is to be realized-the two types of identitylessness in their entirety (all phenomena and their nature that are contained within the four realities), which are the root of all common and uncommon focal objects. (2) The aspects are the remedies-the entirety of remedial clear realizations in which all aspects of real­izing identitylessness are complete, which are the root of all paths to liberation and omniscience. (3) The path of preparation's being a cause refers to its functioning as the cause of the result that is the path of seeing, which includes all types of realization of the three yanas. (4) Being mentored consists of the inner and the outer mentor protecting one in all situations of saJp.sira and ni rviil;la and representing the root of all clear realizations that put an end to the extremes of saJp.siira and nirviil;la. (5) The conceptions refer to the entirety of the factors to be relinquished that consist of the two types of clinging to identity, which are the root of all afflictive and cogni­tive obscurations. 851 In the above, MCG (fols. 28a.3-29a.2) glosses \"understanding\" as \"understanding that their respectively own natures are empty\"; \"rising\" as \"affirmation by virtue of the mental"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"Notes 807 engagement of aspiration\"; and \"falling\" as \"negation by virtue of the mental engagement of true reality.\" Lacking \"nonabiding• and \"abiding\" respectively means to lack clinging to specifi­cally characterized phenomena as being objects of expression and that generally characterized phenomena do not exist as objects of expression either. Even conventionally, dialecticians assert that specifically characterized phenomena do not exist as objects of expressions, while the cling­ing to names expressing something refers to mere imputations, which do not exist ultimately. Therefore, in brief. objects of expression do not exist because all names (the means of expres­sion) do not exist. MPZL (p. 31) says that the focal objects of lesser heat are the sixteen aspects of personal identitylessness that consist of being free from the sixteen superimpositions as the common distinctive features of the four realities (such as form). Its aspect is the realization that since there are no reference points of such focal objects, all clinging to them does not exist either. The focal objects of medium heat are the sixteen aspects of phenomenal identitylessness that consist of being free from rising and falli ng (affirmation and negation) as the uncommon dis­tinctive features of the four realities (such as form). Its aspect is the realization that since there are no reference points of names, one does not cling to anything as nonabiding (impermanent), abiding (not being impermanent), and so on. The focal objects of great heat are the illusionlike unreal phenomena of seeming appearances that are the bearers of the nature of the four realities (such as form)-mere conventional designations that are imputations. Its aspect is the realiza­tion that since there are no reference points of being virtuous and so on, nothing is expressible through names and designations. 852 MCG (fol. 30a.l-2) glosses the aspect of great peak as all phenomena being unobservable as characteristics or lacking characteristics. According to MPZL (p. 32), the focal object of lesser peak consists of the lack of nature of ultimate emptiness-the true nature of the four realities (such as form)-being what does not abide in any extremes of reference points. Its aspects are the realizations of form and so on not even being conceived as not abiding as impermanent and such because they have a common nature-being empty. The focal object of medium peak is the single inseparable nature of the unity of appearance and emptiness-the true nature of the fo ur realities (such as form). Its aspect is the realization of not even grasping at phenomena's nature being said unity because the reference point of unity has subsided. The focal object of great peak is that equality free from extremes-the true nature of the four realities (such as form)-is not seen as the referential characteristics of being one or different. Its aspect is the realization that the investigation of characteristics is unobservable by the prajiiii of realizing the lack of characteristics. 853 PGBG (p. 322) explains the aspect of lesser poised readiness as the realization that the nature of form and so on consists of their not being real. The aspect of medium poised readiness is the realization that the body, speech, and so on of the level of medium poised readiness rep­resent the causes for the purity of adventitious stains at the buddhabhiimi. According to MPZL (pp. 32-33), the focal object of lesser poised readiness is the nature that is emptiness (being without a nature of characteristics)-the true nature of the four realities (such as form). Its aspect is the realization of not even grasping at form and so on as said true nature-their nature of emptiness-being the nonbeing of a nature. The focal object of medium poised readiness is that the equality of sarpsaric existence and peace (results being wishlessness)-the true nature of the four realities (such as form)-is without arising and without final deliverance. Its aspect is the realization of not even grasping at the nature of form and so on being purity by virtue of the equality of sarpsaric existence and peace. The focal object of great poised readiness is that the equality of what is to be adopted and to be rejected (causes being signlessness)-the true nature of the fo ur realities (such as form)-lacks general and specific characteristics. Its aspect is the realization that, through not dwelling on the reference points of characteristics, there are no aspiration for characteristics and no characteristics of discrimination."},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"808 Groundless Paths 854 PGBG (p. 323) says that the focal objects of the lesser supreme dharma consist of samadhis such as the heroic stride. The focal objects of the medium supreme dharma consist of the samadhis of the supreme dharma that serve as the causes for being prophesied by the buddhas. The aspect of the great supreme dharma is to not conceive of samadhi as possessing the three spheres. According to MPZL (p. 33), the focal object of the lesser supreme dharma consists of the unborn nature of the cognizing subjects of the four realities (such as form)-the samadhis such as the heroic stride, which are endowed with the three doors to liberation. Its aspect is the realization of not even grasping at the function of this nature (said samadhis) as being spontaneously present. The focal object of the medium supreme dharma is the distinc­tive feature of the result of said subjects of the four realities-those who possess such samadhis being prophesied by the buddhas and so on. Its aspect is the realization that any conceit about resting in meditative equipoise in said samadhis with special results is terminated. The focal object of the great supreme dharma is that, in terms of such samadhis as the subjects of the four realities, the three of agent, action, and object (the nature of characteristics) have a common nature. Its aspect is nonconceptuality even within the samadhi of phenomena with characteris­tics that are its cause. 855 MCG (fol. 3la.3-3lb.2) also reports this explanation, but says that the focal objects and aspects of the path of preparation are taught from the perspective of their nature and, in vari­ous other sources, by way of their functions, their results, and their supports (such as samadhis). However, ultimately, to familiarize with prajftaparamita during all four levels of the path of preparation means that, through focusing on suchness free from all reference points, also the aspects that represent the modes of apprehending this suchness lack the nature of any extremes or reference points. Therefore, they are described from the perspective of eliminating their respective factors to be ceased. However, without understanding this essential point, through thinking of them as having temporary modes of apprehension, it is very difficult to realize even a fraction of the profound intended meaning of prajftaparamita. MPZL (pp. 33-34) says that the twelve levels of the path of preparation are divided through their distinct focal objects and aspects, which are distinguished by the various aspects of phenomena and their nature in terms of cause, result, and nature. Thus, said levels are taught by way of their primary manner of put­ting an end to clinging. During lesser and medium heat, one puts an end to the clinging to the common and uncommon distinctive features, respectively, of the four realities. During great heat and lesser, medium, and great peak, in due order, one puts an end to the fourfold clinging to appearance, emptiness, their unity, and equality (however, this should not be conflated with the fourfold progression of the dawning of Madhyamaka). During lesser, medium, and greater poised readiness, in due order, one puts an end to the clinging to the distinctive feature of equal­ity-the equality of the basic characteristic (emptiness), satpsaric existence and peace, and the characteristics of what is to be adopted and to be rejected (the three doors to liberation as the object). During the lesser, medium, and great supreme dharma, one puts an end to the clinging to being endowed with the three doors to liberation in terms of cause, result, and nature (the subject). 856 I could not locate this paragraph in LSSP. In its general presentation of the four factors conducive to penetration, LSSP/PSD say that the first three refer to realizing the lack of some­thing apprehended, while only the last one realizes the lack of an apprehender (see PSD, pp. 96-97). 857 MCG (fols. 32a.4-33a.2) agrees with the above, but adds some further glosses. Under (a), (1) is the ignorance that consists of the imaginations which mistakenly apprehend in dis­cordance with the nature of phenomena and obscure true reality, (3) expands the primary and secondary afflictions, (5) is the lack of confidence, (6) is laziness, and (7) means to focus on all phenomena of suffering in a mistaken way. Under (b), (5) refers to the eighteen emptinesses free from reference points. According to MPZL (pp. 35-36), under (a), the general manners"},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"Notes 809 of conceiving of entities refer to ( 1) ignorance as the phenomenon that is the cause of afflicted phenomena and (2) the skandhas as the phenomena that are the results of afflicted phenomena. The particular manners of conceiving of the nature of afflicted phenomena mean to cling to (3) the bases of afflicted phenomena as name and form and (4), to the features of these bases as the two extremes. The particular manners of conceiving of the causes of afflicted phenomena refer to (5) the distinctive feature that is the cause of afflicted phenomena (not knowing the flaws and qualities of afflicted and purified phenomena, respectively); (6) the shortcoming of such not knowing (not abiding on the path of the noble ones); and (7) observing the three spheres to be relinquished. The particular manner of conceiving of the results of afflicted phenomena refers to (8) conceiving of the satpSiric existences of oneself and others. The specific manner of conceiving of the phenomena to be rejected means (9) to conceive of limited forms of purity as the phenomena that are to be produced. Under (b), the general manners of conceiving of purified phenomena consist of (1)-(3) as above, with (2) being the dominant conditions and (3), the substantial cause. The specific manners of conceiving of the purified phenomena of the ground are (4)-(5) as above, with (4) conceiving of the phenomena of the seeming and (5), of the phenomena of the ultimate. The specific manners of conceiving of the purified phenomena of the path are (6)-(8) as above, with (6) being the conduct and (7)-(8), the nature of the path. The specific manner of conceiving of the purified phenomena of the fruition is (9). 858 According to MPZL (pp. 36-37), under (a), the manner of conceiving of the basis of the features of a person is (1) as above. The manners of conceiving of the features of a person in general consist of (2) as above and (3)-(4) conceiving of the self as the cause that is an agent and the cause that is the experiencer of objects. The manners of conceiving of the fe atures of a per­son in particular (being the support of being bound in saip.sara and being liberated in nirv8I}.a) consist of (5)-(6). The manners of conceiving of the features of a person in specific (being the support of the supramundane path) consist of (7)-(9). Under (b), the manners of conceiving of the basis of the features of a person consist of (1)-(3) conceiving of a person that is imputed onto the skandhas, ayatanas, or dhitus. The manners of conceiving of the features of a person (being the support of being bound in saip.siira and being liberated in nirv8I}.a), in general, consist of conceiving of a person that is imputed onto (4) the self being bound-the phenomena of cycling in Saip.sira in the manner of the twelve links of dependent origination-and onto (5) the self being liberated-the purified phenomena of nirv8I}.a. The manners of conceiving of the features of a person in this way in particular consist of conceiving of a person that is imputed onto (6)-(9) the path of seeing, the path of familiarization, the special path, and the path of non! earning. 859 PGBG (p. 324) says that a supreme nirm8I}.akiya who teaches those to be guided the lack of nature of phenomena by way of not intimidating their minds and so on and who has abandoned the antagonistic factors (such as miserliness) of that is the mentor of bodhisattvas on the path of preparation in every way because he is the spiritual friend who always teaches the dharma to these bodhisattvas. MCG (fols. 34a.4-35a.2) explains that the arising of the path of preparation as described above depends on the outer and the inner mentors. Under the second one among the above-mentioned three distinctive fe atures of the outer mentor (the spiritual friend), MCG adds the piramitis, bodhicitta, and dedication as what is to be taught. The third feature-relinquishing adverse conditions-means to abandon the antagonistic factors of wis­dom (miras and evil companions who make one give up the mahayana), the antagonistic factors of the paramitis (such as miserliness), any mental engagement in inferior paths, and so on. The inner mentor consists of special means and prajfta-through mentally engaging in the knowl­edge of all aspects, one engages in the means (great compassion and the six paramitas) and through praji\\i, all phenomena are not observable as the three doors to liberation. MPZL (pp. 39-40) says that the inner mentor (the cause) and the outer mentors (the conditions) are what is to be relied upon. The inner mentor consists of special means and prajfta-through prajna, one's"},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"810 Groundless Paths mind is not intimidated and so on by profound emptiness and, implicitly, through compassion (the means), one engages in the vast welfare of others without being afraid. The outer mentors possess the fe ature of prajfia (teaching the lack of nature) and, implicitly, the fe ature of means (not being separated from the means that is compassion). Thus, they teach special means. To relinquish the adverse conditions of these two types of mentor means to abandon any internal lack of means and prajfia and to give up those external friends who are maras. 860 MCG (fols. 35b.4-36a.2 and 37a.6-37b.4) agrees with the above, but further glosses (8) as the relinquishment of the afflictive obscurations; (10) as the foundation for the path of lib­eration of the eighth bhiimi; ( 11) as the fourfold wisdom of discriminating awareness on the ninth bhtimi; (12) as accomplishing the welfare of others through the intentions and indirect intentions; and (13) as referring to the tenth bhiimi. In brief, from heat up through the effortless operation of wisdom, through focusing on the dharmadhatu (suchness), the clinging to real entities is cut through in a progressive manner. Finally, all clinging to any knowable objects is era��ated at the root and one is propelled onto the buddhabhiimi. All this is due to the dharmadhatu-the naturally abiding disposition because suchness is what exists primordially as the basic nature, and the relinquishment of the obscurations is accomplished through focusing on it. MPZL (pp. 40-41) says that (1)-(6) represent the general division of the dharmadhatu­the naturally abiding disposition-by way of the dharmas that are the nature of practice. (7)-(9) make up the particular division by way of the dharmas that are the factors to be relinquished and their remedies, with (7)-(8) being the uninterrupted path that consists of the wisdom of realiz­ing identitylessness, which functions as the actual remedy for the factors to be relinquished, and the relinquishment of the two obscurations by the power of that. (9) is the path of liberation of both the factors to be relinquished and their remedies having been completely consumed. The specific division by way of the dharmas of realization consists of (10) the nature of realization (prajfta with compassion), (11) the distinctive fe ature of realization (the clear realization of such means and prajfta not being in common with §ravakas and so on), and (12)-(13) the functions of realization (the temporary function of promoting the welfare of others through the four expedient intentions and indirect intentions and the ultimate function of the wisdom of the dharmakaya as one's own welfare operating effortlessly for the welfare of others). 861 MCG (fols. 37a.5-38a.1) says that, though a jar is a single thing, it can be differentiated by virtue of its varying contents (such as honey and sugar). Likewise, the disposition is not presented as threefold from the perspective of the dharmadhatu, but its divisions are expressed by virtue of the divisions of the various manners of the mind focusing on, or realizing, the dharmadhatu, which are founded on the dharmadhatu. 862 PGBG (p. 325) and MCG (fol. 38a.1-3) say that the focal object of mahayana practice consists of all phenomena because they are the bases with regard to which superimpositions are to be cut through. According to MCG, (1)-(3) are the general focal objects and (4)-(11), the spe­cific ones. MPZL (p. 42) glosses (4) and (5), respectively, as the temporary and ultimate objects to be adopted, and (8) and (9) as the spheres of temporary consciousness and ultimate wisdom, respectively. 863 PGBG (p. 326) glosses \"the self-arisen ones\" as \"the bodhisattvas who bear the name buddhas.\" MCG (fol. 39a.2) glosses \"great mind\" as \"nonreferential compassion.\" MPZL (p. 43) glosses \"the self-arisen ones\" as \"the perfect buddhas\"; \"great mind\" as \"great compassion, the distinctive fe ature of means\"; \"great relinquishment\" as the svabhavikakaya; and \"great realiza­tion\" as the wisdom dharmakaya. Said three greatnesses are to be known in the manner of not observing. As the knowledge of all aspects to be accomplished (the object), the three greatnesses exist on the buddhabhiimi, while the causal knowledge of all aspects (the means to accomplish the realization that it is not observable) consists of the paths of learning."},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"Notes 811 864 MCG (fol. 40a.3-4) explains that, through the armorlike practice of the above combina­tions of each one of the six paramitas (the vast practice), bodhisattvas cultivate the armorlike practice that is the vast motivation for promoting solely the welfare of others. 865 MCG (fol. 40a.4-40b.5) says that, among the nine objects of the practice of engagement, (1)-(8) refer to the path and (9) to the fruition. It further glosses (1) as calm abiding-the foun­dation of the path; (2) as the means to attain realization (one's own welfare); (3) as the means to attain relinquishment; (4) as the means to accomplish the welfare of others; (5) as the means to purify the welfare of others during the superior insight of meditative equipoise; (6) as the subsequent attainment of the mahayana path; (7) as transforming roots of virtue for the aim of the three greatnesses; (8) as representing the feature that is the power of swiftly completing the accumulations; and (9) as engaging through focusing on the knowledge of all aspects (the frui­tion). According to MPZL (pp. 44-45), (1)-(6) refer to the path, with (1) being the engagement in the mundane paths and (2)-(6), the engagement in the supramundane paths. Among the latter, (2) represents the supramundane path in general; (3), the particular nature of the supra­mundane path; (4), the specific feature of means; and (5)-(6), the specific feature of prajii.ii (the samiidhi of being without appearances-focal objects of reference points-during meditative equipoise and the samiidhi with appearances during subsequent attainment). (7)-(9) refer to the fruition, with (7) being the fruition in general and (8)-(9), the specific features of great realiza­tion (the common powers and the uncommon qualities of the wisdom of the knowledge of all aspects). 866 MCG (fols. 42a.3-43b.4) says that, in general, the equipments (or accumulations) are divided into two (merit and wisdom), which are then subdivided into the seventeen practices of the equipments. (8) is the one-pointed mind that arises from the causes of having relinquished the five flaws of samiidhi (such as laziness) and having relied on the eight applications (such as striving). (9) is the unerring seeing of true actuality through the prajii.ii of distinguishing the general and specific characteristics, the nature, and the distinctive features of the actualities of suchness and variety. (12) consists of the wisdoms of realizing the eighteen emptinesses. (13) Generally, merit consists of all virtuous karmas, but here it refers to uncontaminated karmas and specifically to the samiidhis (such as the heroic stride and the jewel mudrii) that possess the power to accomplish infinite merit without difficulty in each moment. MPZL (pp. 46-47) explains that (1)-(7) are the general instructions on the equipments in terms of (1) motivation and (2)-(7) application. (8)-(13) are the particular instructions on the nature of the two equip­ments of (a) wisdom and (b) merit. (a) The equipment of wisdom consists of the paramitiis of prajfiii and dhyana, with (8) being the foundation of samadhi; (9), the prajii.ii of realizing identitylessness, which is superior to the mundane paths; (10), its being in union with great compassion, which is superior to the inferior yanas; (11), superior to bodhisattvas who lack skill in means; and (12), the clear realizations of identitylessness that entail the above features. (b) The equipment of merit consists of (13) the first four paramitiis. As for the specific features of accomplishing the two equipments of merit and wisdom, (14) refers to the nature of the path-the paths of seeing and familiarization that are the basic foundations for accomplishing the two equipments; (15), to the qualities of the path that make the two equipments (its causes) inexhaustible; and ( 16)-( 17), to the practice of the path (accomplishing the equipments of merit and wisdom, respectively, by way of relinquishing the impregnations of the negative tendencies of the obscurations during subsequent attainment and the seeds of the obscurations during meditative equipoise). 867 As for the question of whether said purifications make one attain a bhiimi that one has not attained yet or purify a bhiimi that one has attained already, SZB (pp. 313-14) says that, due to the intentions of the siitras and the AA forming a pair without contradiction, the purifications function in both ways. According to the siitras' explicit teaching (CZ, pp. 163ff.), they make an already attained bhiimi special and, according to the hidden meaning of this as"},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"812 Groundless Paths expressed in AA 1.48ab, they make one attain a bhiimi that one has not attained yet. As for the manner of purification, what is to be purified consists of the purifications of the individual bhiimis (the nature of vast means), while what purifies them is the realization that they are not observable as the three spheres (profound prajna). The purifications occur through per­fecting the dexterity in the samiidhi with appearances during subsequent attainment, in which these two (means and prajfiii) are in union. Therefore, it is said in the Madhyamalcavatara and so on that the piiramitiis are only mundane if they are observed as the three spheres, whereas they are supramundane if they are embraced by not observing the three spheres. In due order, this is explained as being and not being affected by cognitive obscurations. Thus, through the purifications of each bhiimi, that bhiimi as well as its corresponding piiramitii are perfected. PGBG (p. 328) says that the above purifications should be understood as purifications on the level of seeming reality by way of not observing any nature of theirs ultimately. MCG (fol. 46a.4-6) explains that, in general, the purifications of the ten bhiimis are purifications from the point of view of relinquishing the obstructions of the special ten piiramitiis (such as generosity) that are respectively perfected on these bhiimis. Through these purifications, prajfiiipiiramitii and the wisdoms of the respectively purified bhiimis are accomplished. When said purifications have been perfected within a state of compassion and the prajna of realizing their being empty of real existence, the respective bhiimi has been perfected, which also constitutes the respective main piiramitii on this bhiimi. MPZL (pp. 48-50) says that the passages in the prajfiiipiiramitii siitras explicitly speak of the purifications as the distinctive features that make already attained bhiimis perfect. According to the intention of the hidden meaning of these passages, the AA explicitly speaks of the purifications as being what makes one attain the bhiimis that one had not attained. In brief. said purifications represent the purifications of the respective bhiimis by way of both being what makes one attain the bhiimis that one had not attained and what makes already attained bhiimis perfect. Those who exclusively cling to either one of these two do not see the meaning of the text fully. The nature of the purifications of the first nine bhiimis consists of the special means and prajfiii of perfecting the relinquishment and realization of merit dur­ing their respective subsequent attainments. The purifications of the first bhiimi are threefold in terms of the generosity of (a) material things, (b) dharma, and (c) protecting from fear. (a) con­sists of (1) a pure unwavering intention toward all sentient beings (the feature of the motivation of generosity), (2) pure things that are beneficial for the respective purpose (the feature of the things to be given), (3) pure objects by virtue of an equal mind toward all friends and enemies (the feature of the objects of generosity), and (4) pure giving-giving away all material things by way of the three kinds of giving (the feature of the application of generosity). (b) consists of (5) serving spiritual friends (the dominant condition for the explanation of the dharma), (6) searching for the genuine dharma of the three yanas (the substantial cause), (7) being endowed with the ethics of leaving one's home (the cooperating condition), (8) longing for attaining the dharmakaya of a buddha as what is to be accomplished ultimately (the focal object), and (9) teaching the genuine dharma in this manner (the feature of application). (c) means to protect others from the fears related to water, fire, and so on through uttering words of truth. Through knowing how to explain the purifications of the first bhiimi in this way, one understands how the purifications of each bhiimi primarily teach their respectively corresponding piiramitiis (such as the above ten purifications primarily teaching the piiramitii of generosity), which is the intended meaning asserted by Indian and Tibetan scholars. In particular, one will also under­stand the essential intended points such as that there are various progressive stages of practice (such as the piiramitiis) on the respective bhiimis, but that, on the first bhiimi, the distinctive features of superior generosity are taught. As for the manner in which said purifications of the first bhiimi purify, if they entail any clinging to characteristics in terms of the three spheres, they are only mundane piiramitiis, but do not become supramundane ones. Therefore, what relinquishes the manifest clinging to characteristics and so on is the samiidhi with appearances during subsequent attainment that entails said ten features of generosity (the aspect of means"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"Notes 813 as what is to be embraced) and the realization that they are unobservable as the nature of the three spheres (the aspect of prajiiii as what embraces these fe atures). This is to be understood as constituting the purifications of the obscurations that are the impregnations of negative tenden­cies of this bhiimi. 868 PGBG (p. 328) says that (4) refers to the utter joy about practicing virtuous dharmas. Both it and MCG (fol. 47a.2-5) agree that (5) means love and compassion for all sentient beings and, under (7), add \"and practicing it accordingly.\" MCG further glosses the first type of ethics under (1) as being free from the stains of corrupt ethics, mental engagement in one's own wel­fare, and effort. According to MPZL (p. 50), (a) the ethics of promoting the welfare of sentient beings consists of (1) the pure ethics of doing so (the fe ature of its nature), which promotes their welfare by way of (2) (the fe ature of its objects) and (3). Its fe ature of application is (4) to engage in it with utter joy about the welfare of sentient beings and its fe ature of motivation is (5) to be endowed with love and compassion for them. (b) The ethics of controlling flawed conduct consists of (6) paying respect to the gurus (such as preceptors and masters) through rendering services to them (the fe ature of the dominant condition) and (7) listening to what they teach and guarding all points to be trained in (the fe ature of the trainings). (c) The ethics of gathering virtue consists of (8). 869 PGBG (p. 328) says that (4) means that seeing the shortcomings of 5a111siira does not make one weary. MCG (fol. 47a.6) says that the third bhiimi is The Illuminating One, which shines the light of the dharma onto oneself and others. According to MPZL (pp. 50-51), the purifications of patience on the third bhiimi are threefold in terms of (a) certainty about the dharma, (b) taking suffering upon oneself, and (c) not retaliating upon being harmed. (a) con­sists of (1) reflecting about the dharma with the insatiable desire of studying by way of being patient with regard to the meaning of the profound dharma and (2) giving the dharma to oth­ers without expecting any reward by way of being patient toward hardships for the sake of the dharma. (b) consists of (3) generating, by way of taking suffering upon oneself, the state of mind of purifying pure realms so that all buddha realms are without suffering and ( 4) not being weary by virtue of being patient toward the suffering of the wrong Salllsiiric engagements of other impure realms. (c) consists of (5). 870 The Tibetan of both 1.54c and PBG has \"nirviiJ:.la.\" 871 More literally, the Tibetan in both line 1.54d and PBG has \"no views.\" 872 MCG (fol. 47b.4-5) says that the fo urth bhiimi is the one that radiates the light of the fire of the prajiiii of the thirty-seven dharmas concordant with enlightenment consuming the two obscurations. According to MPZL (pp. 51-52), the purifications of the fo urth bhiimi are threefold in terms of vigor (a) being armorlike, (b) gathering virtue, and (c) benefiting oth­ers. (a) consists of (1) the armor of staying in secluded places, (2) little desire for what is not obtained (the armor of few daily necessities), (3) as above, and (4) as the armor of controlling one's conduct. (b) consists of (5) collecting virtuous dharmas to be adopted (the training) with­out abandoning them and (6) despising and relinquishing sense pleasures as the antagonistic fa ctors of the training that are to be relinquished. (c) consists of (7) establishing in nirv�a (the ultimate benefit for others), (8) renouncing all there is (the temporary benefit for others), (9) being uncowed with regard to practicing the welfare of others in this way, and (10) disregarding the entities of accomplishing one's own welfare. 873 MCG (fol. 48a.5) says that the fifth bhiimi performs the two difficult activities of matur­ing sentient beings and one's own mind not becoming afflicted through that. According to MPZL (pp. 52-53), the purifications of the fifth bhiimi are twofold in terms of (a) the branches of dhyiina and (b) the nature of dhyiina. (a) consists of (aa) the body being secluded from crowds and (ab) the mind being distant from conceptions. (aa) consists of relinquishing (1) intimacy"},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"814 Groundless Paths with the group of one's friends (the basis of attachment), be they ordained or lay persons, {2} jealousy in terms of the group of those who are perceived as antagonistic due to one's taking faithful sponsoring families as being \"mine\" (the basis of hatred), and {3} places that invite crowds, where many distracted people gather. (ab) consists of (4)-{5} relinquishing thoughts of wishing to praise oneself and disparage others. Under (b), the dhyanas of childish conduct refer to {6) the samadhis of calm abiding that relinquish the ten paths of nonvirtuous actions. The dhyanas of the virtue of tathagatas consist of the samadhis of superior insight that relin­quish (7) conceit and arrogance by thinking, \"I intend\" and {8) the mistaken discriminations of regarding the body, feelings, mind, and phenomena as pure, happiness, a self, and permanent, respectively. The dhyanas of discriminating actuality consist of those that relinquish {9) defi­cient views and (10) any tolerance for the afflictive obscurations. 874 PGBG (pp. 329-30} says that (1}-{6) constitute the purifications of practicing what is to be adopted, while (7)-(12) are the purifications of being free from the factors to be relinquished. MCG (fols. 48b.S and 49a.4) says that the sixth bhiimi is the one of facing not abiding in sa�p.sara or nirviil;la due to the pararnita of prajfiii. Its twelve purifications are described as the six factors of generating the path and the six factors of relinquishing what is not the path, respectively. According to MPZL (pp. 53-54), the purifications of the sixth bhiimi consist of (a) the perfec­tion of the nature of prajfiii and (b) the perfection of its functions. (a) The first five paramitas are perfected on the first through fifth bhiimis, respectively, so what is perfected here are these five paramitas as they are contained in the pararnita of prajiia as its branches. Thus, one should not conflate the perfection of each one of the pararnitas and the perfection of their collection. Under (b), the function of accomplishing the causes of the dharmakaya (one's own welfare) consists of relinquishing (7) and {8) through means and {9) through prajiiii. The function of accomplishing the causes of the nipakayas (the welfare of others) consists of {10)-(12), which respectively refer to the beginning, the middle, and the end of one's practicing generosity. 875 The Tibetan in 1.63b literally says, \"teaching/displaying [all] dharmas as the single aspect of the nonduality of apprehender and apprehender.\" 876 MCG (fols. 49a.S-51a.4) says that the seventh bhiimi, by virtue of being joined with the path of single progress, has gone far beyond any clinging to characteristics. It explains flaw (4) as clinging to the mind with all seeds as being a person. The dhatus under {10) are glossed as having the meaning of cause, disposition, and seed, while the ayatanas under (11} refer to the gates for the arising and expanding of consciousness toward its objects by virtue of apprehender and apprehended. {12} The containers of the three realms arise from the respectively general collective karmas and afflictions of the beings in them and the contents, from their individual karmas and afflictions. (17}-(18) refer to conceiving of the three jewels and ethics in terms of the three spheres due to being conceited about them and {19}, to clinging to all phenomena as being really existent. {20} means that, due to taking emptiness as having characteristics, being an entity, and so on, one regards dependent origination as being opposed to it, that is, one does not realize the union of emptiness and dependent origination as the equality of appearance and emptiness. The seventh bhiimi is attained through eliminating these twenty flaws, just as expel­ling some thieves and closing the door behind them. Remedy ( 11) is glossed as the single flow of the means of the mahayana since all dharmas lack the duality of apprehender and apprehended. The discriminations under {13} refer to the four mistakennesses of regarding phenomena as pure, happiness, a self, and permanent. The retinues under {20} are glossed as sravakas, pra­tyekabuddhas, and gods such as Indra and Brahmii. According to MPZL (pp. 54-58}, the nature of the clinging to characteristics that represents the factors to be relinquished here consists of (a) the clinging to phenomena and persons and (b) not being skilled in means (the flaw of such clinging). (a) consists of clinging to (aa) persons and (ab) phenomena. (aa) consists of clinging to (aa1) the person as the basis of certain features and (aa2) its features as the two extremes. (aa1) consists of clinging to (1) the nature of a self, (2} sentient beings as having characteristics,"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"Notes 815 (3) the character of a soul, and (4) a person who is an agent. (aa2) consists of clinging to (5) the continua of sentient beings becoming extinct and (6) their being permanent entities. (ab) The clinging to phenomena consists of clinging to (ab1) their nature (characteristics of reference points) and (ab2) their distinctive features. (ab1) consists of (7) clinging to all phenomena as having characteristics of reference points. (ab2) consists of clinging to (ab2a) causes (producing phenomena), (ab2b) their natures (divisional phenomena), and (ab2c) their distinctive features (the phenomena of sarpsara and nirvil;la). (ab2a) consists of (8) clinging to various types of causes. (ab2b) consists of clinging to (9) the five conditioned skandhas; (10) the eighteen condi­tioned and unconditioned dhatus; and ( 11) the ayatanas of knowable objects in terms of subjects and objects. (ab2c) consists of clinging to (ab2ca) sarpsaric phenomena to be relinquished and (ab2cb) nirvil;lic phenomena to be relied on. (ab2ca) consists of clinging to (12) dwelling in the three realms (resultant sarpsaric phenomena), (13) the afflictions such as attachment (causal afflictive phenomena), and (14) one's mind being cowed with regard to the correct path (the phenomenon that represents the flaw of the above). (ab2cb) consists of clinging to ( 15)-(17) the Buddha (the fruition of nirvil;la), the dharma (its cause), and the sarpgha (its support). Finally, (b) not being skilled in means as the antagonistic factors of the means (the functions of the above kinds of clinging) consists of (18) clinging to the means contained in ethics (the nature of not being skilled in means), (19) disputing the object that is profound emptiness (the function of not being skilled in means), and (20) being opposed to this profound reality (the flaw of not being skilled in means). As for the remedies of these twenty factors to be relinquished, they consist of (a) their nature (the purifications of realizing identitylessness) and (b) their functions (the paramitas that are the means). (a) consists of the purifications of realizing (aa) personal identitylessness and (ab) phenomenal identitylessness. (aa) consists of (aa1) their nature (the wisdoms of personal identitylessness) and (aa2) their distinctive features (the purifications of being free from the two extremes). (aa1) consists of (1)-(3) the doors to liberation of the nature being emptiness, causes being signlessness, and results being wishlessness by virtue of respec­tively having relinquished the clingings to the nature of an identity, the characteristics of sentient beings, and the aspiring for the character of a soul. (4) Being pure of the three spheres is due to not clinging to a person who is the meditator. (aa2) consists of (5) the effortless arising of compassion (the means) due to not clinging to sentient beings as becoming extinct and (6) having no conceit about prajfia and emptiness due to not clinging to sentient beings as being permanent entities. (ab) consists of (ab1) their nature (the wisdom of the equality of phenom­enal identitylessness) and (ab2) the purifications that are its distinctive features. (ab1) consists of (7) realizing the equality of the identitylessness of all phenomena due to not clinging to phe­nomena as having characteristics. (ab2) consists of (ab2a) its cause (the feature of signlessness), (ab2b) its nature (the feature of nonarising), and (ab2c) its result (the features of relinquishment and realization). (ab2a) consists of (8) knowing the single principle of the mahayana (the cause) due to not clinging to causal characteristics. (ab2b) consists of (9) knowing the nature to be nonarising due to not clinging to the conditioned skandhas, (10) knowing the poised readiness for the actuality of profound nonarising due to not clinging to the dhatus of phenomena, and (11) the single flow of the nonduality of all dharmas of apprehender and apprehended due to not clinging to the ayatanas. (ab2c) consists of the purifications of (ab2ca) relinquishing the obscurations to be relinquished and (ab2cb) the remedial calm abiding and superior insight. (ab2ca) consists of (12) overcoming the conceptions of improper mental engagement (the cause) due to not clinging to the three realms that represent the reality of suffering and (13) relinquishing the cognitive obscurations (discriminations of characteristics) and the obscura­tions of views and afflictions due to not clinging to their causes (attachment and so on). (ab2cb) consists of (ab2cb1) their natures and (ab2cb2) their functions. (ab2cb1) consists of (14) famil­iarizing with calm abiding (the support) due to one's mind not being cowed and (15) being skilled in superior insight-the actuality of realizing identitylessness-due to not even clinging to the fruition of buddhahood. (ab2cb2) consists of (16) the function of calm abiding as the"},{"pageNumber":817,"pageContent":"816 Groundless Paths support-the mind (conceptions) being tamed due to not even clinging to the dharma as the causes of conceptions and (17) the function of superior insight as the supported-the wisdom of unobstructedly seeing the manner in which form and so on appear due to not even clinging to the sa�pgha (its support). (b) The paramitas that are the means consist of (18) the skill in means of realizing that, due to lacking the clinging to views about ethics, it is not a ground for being attached to the two extremes and (19)-(20) the functions of this-going simultaneously everywhere as one pleases in the manner of having the same fortune as the bodhisattvas in the pure realms due to not disputing prajiii and emptiness, and displaying, for the welfare of others, one's own being everywhere in the worlds of those to be guided due to having relinquished any conduct that is opposed to such means. Thus, the purifications of the seventh bhiimi are the special means and prajiia that consist of these twenty remedies, which are implied by being free from their twenty factors to be relinquished. Here the seeds of the factors of the seventh bhiimi that are to be relinquished are relinquished through the practice of the equipment of the reme­dies during its meditative equipoise, while the impregnations of their negative tendencies (the manifest clinging to characteristics) are exhaustively relinquished during its subsequent attain­ment. It is in this way that the twenty purifications are fully completed. 877 PGBG (p. 331) explains (5) as knowing how to develop the faculty of the divine eye. MCG (fol. 51a.5-51b.5) says that the eighth bhiimi is unmoved by the two discriminations of making efforts with regard to characteristics and the lack of characteristics. Under (4), the genuine dharma is glossed as what eliminates the views of tirthikas and proclaims the pure dharma. (5) One knows the faculties of beings through having developed the divine eye and abiding in the ten powers. Under (6), \"purifying\" is replaced by \"delighting the minds of all sentient beings.\" Under (7), the illusionlike samadhi is further glossed as \"not engaging in any phenomenon through clinging.\" Under (8), rebirths are said to be \"inconceivable transforma­tions through one's own power.\" According to MPZL (p. 59), the purifications of the eighth bhiimi consist of (a) their nature (the features of the predominant paramita), (b) the practice (the features of completion, maturation, and purification), and (c) their aspects (the features of mastery). (a) consists of (1) as the power of knowing the mind streams of those to be guided and (2) as the power of the miraculous powers that guide them. (b) consists of (3) manifesting a superb buddha realm as pure through having purified impure phenomena, (4) completing the accumulations through tending to the buddhas in this realm in scrutiny of the dharma, and (5) maturing sentient beings through knowing the progression of the faculties of those to be guided. (c) consists of (6) as the feature of mastering pure realms, (7) seeing that all phenomena lack characteristics and abide like illusions (the feature of mastering nonconceptuality), and (8) as the feature of mastering births. 878 The Tibetan omits \"perfection.\" 879 LSSP (fol. 299a.6-299b.2) says that this refers to the story of two boys hatching from two eggs that developed out of two drops of Gautama's sperm mixed with blood, which had been ripened by the sun and were fostered by the sage Kalaka. Most other commentaries explain this as MCG does (see below). 880 MCG (fols. 51b.6-52b.2) says that the ninth bhiimi marks the attainment of the excellent insight of the four discriminating awarenesses by virtue of being skillful in teaching the dharma. (1) is accomplished through perfecting the six paramitas and (2), through the discriminating awareness of semantics. (3) represents the discriminating awareness of self-confidence. (6) refers to a descent such as Buddha Sakyamuni's, one of whose epithets is \"the friend of the sun.\" A bodhi tree as described under (12) is like a wish-fulfilling jewel. MPZL (pp. 59-60) says that the purifications of the ninth bhiimi consist of (a) their nature (the feature of the predominant paramita), (b) their aspects (the features of mastery), and (c) the trainings on higher levels (the features of the manner of practicing). (a) consists of (1) the paramita of aspiration prayers for"},{"pageNumber":818,"pageContent":"Notes 817 the sake of those to be guided. (b) consists of mastering (2) as the discriminating awareness of words and (3) as the discriminating awarenesses of dharmas, meanings, and self-confidence. (c) consists of (4) entering the womb through descending from T�ita, (5) being born in families such as the royal caste of the Sakyas, (6) descents such as from Suddhodana, (7) lineages such as the one of Miyi. (8) retinues with striving and so on, (9) a birth in these ways (the buddha deed of taking birth), (10) at the end of having delighted in retinues and sustained a kingdom, seeing aging, sickness, death, and the approach of virtuous effort and thus leaving home (the buddha deed of taking ordination), (11) after having practiced asceticism, going to the bodhi tree and defeating the miras at night, and (12) becoming a completely perfect buddha at dawn, which is the nature of the excellency in qualities. 881 In this list, (1) pertains specifically to the supreme dharma because the srivaka disposi­tion is definite at this point. (2) bears its name because an approaching stream-enterer is the eighth fruition, when counted backward from arhathood as the highest fruition on the srivaka path. (3) is the level of seeing the first fruition of the approach of virtuous effort (fully seeing the sixteen aspects of the fo ur realities). (4) has this name because most factors of the desire realm to be relinquished have been relinquished. (5) is so called because one is free from the attachment of the desire realm. (6) means that srivaka arhats are finally relieved from their burden-they realize that all factors to be relinquished have been relinquished and that everything to be real­ized has been realized (the same applies for pratyekabuddha arhats). Usually, the presentation of the levels of the hinayina is eightfold as fo llows (the numbers in ( ) correspond to those in the above list)-[1] the level of seeing what is pure (the path of accumulation); [2] the level of the disposition (1); [3] the eighth level (2); [4] the level of seeing (3); [5] the level of diminishing (4); [6] the level of freedom from desire (5); [7] the level of guarding what had to be done (pra­tyekabuddhas) (8); and [8] the level of having realized (or done) what had to be done (srivaka arhats) (6). This usual list (just reversing the order of [7] and [8]) is also the one given in the sdtras (CZ. p. 178) and fo llowed by Bhadanta Vunuktisena's Abhisamayala111karavarttikaand the Satasahasrikavivarar;�a. To arrive at the above list as in PBG, the Vrtti (p. 107), the Aloka (p. 104), and the Vivrti (03793, fo l. 94b.3-5) drop level [1] and add the above level (7). 882 PGBG (p. 322) and MCG (fol. 53a.2-53b.2) agree that the tenth bodhisattvabhumi is only labeled as \"buddhabhdmi\" because its manner of promoting the welfare of others dur­ing subsequent attainment is equal to that of a buddha. MCG adds that bodhisattvas on this bhdmi are also able to display the nairmil;likakiya of a buddha. Said bhdmi is called Cloud of Dharma because cloudlike samidhis and dhiral].is pervade its skylike wisdom. The meditative equipoise of this bhdmi possesses appearances-though abiding in true reality, appearances are fe asible in it, just as in the case of a buddha. Therefore, at the time of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment being inseparable and the two realities being in union, in the self­appearances of the wisdom of seeing the suchness of the nature of phenomena appearances arise on their own without being ceased. However, at the time of the path, during the meditative equipoises of noble ones, emptiness is predominant and, during their subsequent attainments, appearance is predominant. Once meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment are a unity, this is the buddhabhdmi. Therefore, it is important to understand the essential point that a bud­dha's manner of seeing through the two wisdoms of suchness and variety and the meditative equipoises on the paths of learning being with and without appearances are not contradictory. According to MPZL (p. 61 ), having passed beyond said nine levels, the piramiti of wisdom (the basis of distinctive fe atures) is predominant as the nature of the tenth bhdmi. Though it does not represent completely perfect buddhahood, its distinctive fe atures-the relinquishments and realizations of said nine levels being perfected in it and its manner of accomplishing the welfare of others-are the reasons for its being partially similar to buddhahood. As for the purpose of the tenth bhdmi being taught by way of the fruition of the path, in general, through teaching it through the result of having passed beyond the nine levels of srivakas, pratyekabuddhas,"},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"818 Groundless Paths and bodhisattvas, it is understood that all relinquishments and realizations that are contained in the three yinas are complete in it. In particular, through teaching it through the result of having passed beyond the first nine bodhisattvabhiimis, it is understood that each one of the three levels of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas entails the two modes of cause and result. Most specifically, through teaching it through the result of all the purifications of the bodhisattvabhiimis below it being perfected, those to be guided give rise to enthusiasm for the bodhisattvayana. 883 Both here and in 1.7la, the Tibetan has \"are called ... \" (ces bya instead of shes bya). MCG (fols. 53b.6-54a.3) says that the eight remedies refer to the eight uninterrupted paths of relinquishing said eight conceptions on the paths of seeing and familiarization. ( 6) is explained as observing neither the path nor the fruition. 884 MCG (fols. 54a.6-55a.3) explains that the ultimate final deliverance is the buddhabhiim.i, which is here divided into eight-its uninterrupted path (the vajralike samiidhi) and its path of liberation being sevenfold in terms of its qualities. (1) represents the three greatnesses in general. Among these, great mind has three features-(2) through ultimate prajiiii, not moving away from seeing all phenomena as equality, (3) through maturing sentient beings through great nonreferential compassion, promoting their infinite welfare at all times and in all directions, and (4) as above. Great relinquishment has two features-(5) being beyond the two extremes of per­manence and extinction or SaJP.Siiric existence and peace and ( 6) as above, which mean that the connection between what is to be attained and what causes its attainment is not observable ulti­mately. Great realization also has two features-(7) the wisdom of directly knowing all aspects to be known and (8) the vajralike samiidhi as the cognitive subject of the final path of learning that is able to connect with said wisdom in an uninterrupted manner. MPZL (pp. 62-63) follows MCG and adds that (2)-(3) represent the feature that is the nature of great mind, while (4) is the feature of its function. (5) and (6) respectively come about through having relinquished the two obscurations and the obscurations of the three yanas, and thus respectively represent the features that are the nature and the function of great relinquishment. (7) and (8) represent the result that is great realization and its cause, respectively. 885 Note that LSSP/PSD say the same for the armorlike practice too. 886 This paragraph is not contained in LSSP. MPZL (p. 64) says that the resultant knowledge of all aspects (what is to be accomplished ultimately) consists of what is explained in the AX& eighth chapter (on the dharmakiya), while the causal knowledge of all aspects (the means to accomplish said result)-knowing the aspects of this result to be without arising-is explained in the first chapter. These two types of the knowledge of all aspects are also called \"the mother who accomplishes the desires\" (of sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattva&, and buddhas, as explained in the opening homage of the AA) and \"the mother who gives birth to the noble ones who are buddhas.\" 887 In line with most other commentaries, PGBG (pp. 333-34) speaks of five branches. It presents (1) the eclipsing of the light of the gods as representing the physical support for the arising of the knowledge of the path, while (2) the definite object of the arising of the knowl­edge of the path refers to its mental support. (3) The disposition as the foundation refers to all sentient beings being pervaded by the disposition for the knowledge of the path. (4) Its nature refers to not relinquishing the causes for being reborn in saipsiira for the welfare of others. (5) Its function is to always know the welfare of those to be guided. For MCG's and MPZI.:s comments, see endnote 428. 888 PGBG (p. 334) says that there is a manner in which the path of sriivakas is to be known by noble bodhisattvas because, through their mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects, the aspects of the four realities are to be known by way of not observing them. According to MCG"},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"Notes 819 (fol. 55a.5-55b.5), what the siitras teach explicitly is the path of the mahayana free from observ­ing and reference points. What is taught implicitly is that bodhisattvas must know the path of srivakas in order to take care of others who have the latter's disposition and in order to go beyond it through viewing it with their own way of seeing. The distinctive feature of this knowl­edge of the path of srivakas is the aspect that is nonobservation, while its distinctive feature of realization is that bodhisattvas know the path of srivakas exactly as it is and, at the same time, see that it is also without nature. MPZL (pp. 69-70) explains that the path of sravakas consists of familiarizing with the sixteen aspects of the four realities, which represents the realization of personal identitylessness. Thus, these aspects constitute the focal objects of the bodhisattvas' knowledge of the path of srivakas. The cognitive aspect of this knowledge is to realize said path of the srivakas without observing the three spheres and thus to know what is to be known through said knowledge. 889 The Tibetan has this line as line 11.3a, with all following lines shifting accordingly. 890 PGBG (p. 335) says on the supreme dharma that bodhisattvas on the level of the supreme dharma do not abide by way of taking the ten bhiimis for real because the Buddha, upon directly realizing all phenomena, did not see any phenomena in which one could abide as being real. According to MPZL (pp. 71-72), heat is the realization that fo rm and so on are undifferen­tiable from the true nature of phenomena, emptiness. Peak is the realization of form and so on through not observing them as the bases of distinctive features. Poised readiness is the realiza­tion of form and so on through not abiding in their distinctive features. The supreme dharma is the realization that even the wisdom of the ten bhiimis (the cognizing subject of the four realities, such as form) does not abide. You may wonder, \"For what reason does one have to real­ize all phenomena (subjects and objects) without observing them?\" Because the Buddha, upon realizing all phenomena with his omniscient valid cognition of seeing suchness, did not see that, ultimately, there are any phenomena that consist of subjects and objects. 891 The Sanskrit cain 11.6a (which fills the meter and is not rendered in the English) is ren-dered by yang (\"also\") in the Tibetan. 892 Like many other commentaries, PGBG (p. 335) says that this verse teaches the wisdom of pratyekabuddhas to be more profound and eminent than the one of srivakas because the former directly realize self-arisen enlightenment in their last existence without needing to rely on any instructions by others. MCG (fol. 60a.5-60b.2) largely follows PBG, glossing \"the self-arisen\" as the pratyekabuddhas who possess the wisdom of realizing one-and-a-half identitylessnesses and realize the profound path by themselves. Thus, their wisdom is more profound than the one of srivakas. According to MPZL (pp. 72-73), verses 11.6-7 teach the greatness of the psy­chophysical support of pratyekabuddhas in general, with 11.6 describing the manner in which they manifest the wisdom of realizing their own welfare. Here their distinctive feature of pro­found cognition is that they clearly realize the profound wisdom of realizing the self-arisen by themselves and thus manifest the enlightenment of knowing termination and nonarising. Their distinctive feature of profound nonteaching is that they do not need to depend on any instruc­tions by spiritual friends in their last life. For these reasons, the wisdom of pratyekabuddhas on the path is said to be profound in being more eminent than the enlightenment of sravakas. 893 PGBG (p. 335), MCG (fol. 6la.3-4), and MPZL (p. 73) agree that pratyekabuddhas, through the physical expression of their miraculous powers, produce a realization in the con­sciousness of the listeners in accordance with what the latter wish to hear. MCG and MPZL add that this ability of the pratyekabuddhas is due to their former aspiration prayers. According to MPZL, it is this verse that teaches the distinctive fe ature of profound silence, that is, the man­ner in which pratyekabuddhas teach the dharma through their body and without words for the welfare of others."},{"pageNumber":821,"pageContent":"820 Groundless Paths 894 MCG (fol. 6la.5) compares realizing the lack of nature of the apprehended, while not realizing the same for the apprehender, to perceiving an illusion or a dream, in which the objects that appear are clearly not established by any nature of their own, but the clinging to the appre­hender of these objects appearing as, and in fact being, the apprehender has not been stopped. According to MPZL (pp. 73-74), this verse teaches the three distinctive features of the path of pratyekabuddhas. (l) Its feature of being superior to the one of the srivakas is that pratyekabud­dhas realize the apprehended to be without nature. (2) Its feature of being inferior to the path of bodhisattvas is that pratyekabuddhas do not realize the same for the apprehender, but conceive of it as being the mind. (3) Its feature of the foundation (the disposition) is that pratyekabud­dhas possess the disposition that functions as the basis for said relinquishment and realization of those of middling faculties. Thus, it is this path of pratyekabuddhas as characterized by said three features that represents the focal object of the knowledge of the path of bodhisattvas of knowing the path of pratyekabuddhas. The cognitive aspect of this knowledge is the same as in the knowledge of the path of knowing the path of srivakas-nonobservation. Therefore, the nature of the knowledge of the path of knowing the path of pratyekabuddhas is to know this path in a nonobserving way. 895 MCG (fols. 6lb.3-62a.2) says that heat has the aspect of pointing out that, while focusing on the four realities, the mere existence of superimpositions and imputations of conventional names and even the manner of imputing them are not rejected. Ultimately, however, no mat­ter how one imputes them, this do not contradict the nature of phenomena because it does not go beyond the inexpressible dharmadhatu. As for peak, since form and so on do not exist, they are distinguished by being without increase and decrease. As for poised readiness, the eighteen emptinesses were taught for the sake of putting an end to clinging to all kinds of inner and outer phenomena. Thus, by virtue of phenomena such as form (the factors to be relinquished) being the emptiness of the internal and so on, they are not observable and therefore not apprehended. The supreme dharma, with its aspect of form and so on being without arising, abiding, and ceas­ing, is what definitely delivers one onto the supramundane path. According to MPZL (p. 74), heat is to realize the distinctive feature that the appearing bearers of the nature of phenomena (such as form) are mere imputations of conventions. Peak is to realize the distinctive feature that said form and so on are the ultimate empty nature of phenomena without increase and decrease. Poised readiness is to realize the distinctive feature of not apprehending the nature of the union of appearance and emptiness of form and so on as anything whatsoever. The supreme dharma is to realize the distinctive feature that the equal nature of phenomena such as form is without the characteristics of arising, ceasing, and so on. 896 MPZL (p. 75) says that, by virtue of the particulars of focusing on the focal objects that are the four realities (the four realities that make up the factors of the desire realm to be relin­quished and their remedies and the four realities that make up the factors of the higher realms to be relinquished and their remedies), the cognitive aspects of the mahayana path of seeing consist of sixteen moments of wisdom-the four moments of dharma readiness, dharma cogni­tion, subsequent readiness, and subsequent cognition for each one of these four realities. 897 PBG has an \"and\" between \"buddhahood\" and \"prajii.aparamita,\" but in LSSP, \"buddha­hood\" is followed immediately, and thus glossed by, \"prajii.aparamita.\" 898 PBG reads \"lack of nature\" (ngo bo nyid med) but LSSP's ngo bo nyid yin pa is in line with the meaning. 899 This could also be read as \"empty of a nature.\" 900 In the last sentence, PBG elaborates, mostly in its own words, on a passage in the Aloka (p. 200) that is also paraphrased in LSSP (fol. 355b.2-3). Note, however, that the gist of this sentence is also found in PGBG and MCG (see below). More in line with Il.l3bc, PGBG (pp."},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"Notes 821 338-39) says about (6) that the nature of form and so on is ascertained to be buddhahood by the bodhisattvas who abide in the prajiiaparamita of the dharma cognition of the origin of suffering ascertain. (8) is justified by saying that cultivating the four immeasurables raises the awareness of bodhisattvas about the danger of potentially falling into the cessation of personal nirviil:la on the ninth moment of the path of seeing due to having clearly and directly seen the shortcom­ings of the reality of suffering and its origin during the first eight moments. (12) Bodhisattvas are protected by the buddhas because they engage in prajiia and skill in means. The reasons for (15) and (16) are that bodhisattvas respectively wish to attain buddhahood for the welfare of others and make generosity and so on inexhaustible for said welfare. The basic reason for the realizations of these sixteen moments is said to be the realization that all phenomena are natural emptiness and without nature. In sum, these sixteen aspects are the moments of the path of seeing in the context of the knowledge of the path because they represent the distinctive features of the capacity of the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing to induce the benefits during subsequent attainment that are taught in them. According to MCG (fols. 63a.6-65b.3), it is from the perspective of those to be guided that the mere natures of the aspects of realizing the lack of nature of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path are temporarily taught to be different. Implicitly, this teaches the sixteen wisdom moments of the path of seeing. Most of them are aspects of realization and most of them refer to the benefits in this and future lives and so on that are induced during subsequent attainment through the power of the preced­ing meditative equipoise. To (1), MCG adds that it represents the wisdom of realizing that all objects and subjects are free from any assertions. (2) Not only form and so on (the objects), but also prajiiaparamita (the subject) are of the great nature of the dharmadhatu free from arising, abiding, and ceasing. The benefit of (7) is that maras have no chance to harm such bodhisattvas. The benefits of (8) are to be protected from falling into cessation and to be able to rise from it as well as fears being eliminated through relying on generosity and so on. (9) It is not that, through the power of emptiness as what is to be realized, entities are ceased. Rather, to focus on entities, despite their nonexistence, through various discriminating notions means to see that objects are without nature. Through this, bodhisattvas eliminate clinging to them and familiarize with the actual true nature of form and so on as being the sixteen emptinesses. (10) By way of focusing on all phenomena primordially being empty, cessation, and the true end, the buddha realms are purified and buddhahood is attained through the roots of virtue that are equal to the immeasur­able dharmadhatu. (13) happens because all phenomena up through nirviil:la are not established ultimately. Thus, it is the wisdom of realizing that, ultimately, an attainment of nirvat:ta is not observable. In sum, though these sixteen moments are divided by way of levels and aspects, in actual fact they are nothing but the true nature of the four realities being perceived, just as it is, by the wisdom of seeing the equality of all phenomena. According to MPZL (pp. 75-77), the inseparability of subject and object is realized as the basic nature of ( 1) the synonyms of support and supported being inexpressible, (2) the great ultimate, (3) there being no verifying valid cog­nition because of said inseparability, (4) the spacelike lack of measure, (5) being free from the extremes of permanence and extinction, ( 6) natural nirvaQa, (7) there being nothing to adopt or to reject, (8) being endowed with means such as love, (9) emptiness, the nature of phenomena, (10) attaining the final fruition, (11) laying hold of remedial purified phenomena, (12) suffering (what is to be relinquished) having subsided, (13) the clinging to nirviil:la being at peace, (14) entailing the benefit of being protected by the buddhas of the ten directions, (15) entailing the function of accomplishing the two welfares of oneself and others, and (16) entailing the func­tion of dedicating roots of virtue for perfect enlightenment. 901 According to MCG (fol. 65b.4-5), the physical supports of the path of familiarization are the same as for the path of seeing. As for its mental supports, due to the skill in means of bod­hisattvas, they cannot only use the dhyanas, but even the mental states of the desire realm and the Peak of Existence. MPZL (p. 80) divides the four temporary functions (1)-( 4) of the path of"},{"pageNumber":823,"pageContent":"822 Groundless Paths familiarization into (a) accomplishing favorable conditions and (b) relinquishing adverse con­ditions. Under (a), (1) one's thoughts being disciplined in every respect due to mastering one's mind represents the inner cause. (2) Bowing to all beings who teach one what to adopt and to reject (such as spiritual friends) represents the outer condition. Under (b), (3) being victorious over the afflictions is the cause and ( 4) being invulnerable to any attacks of suffering is its result. 902 According to MCG (fol. 66b.1-3), the contaminated and the uncontaminated paths of familiarization correspond to subsequent attainment and meditative equipoise, respectively. Buddha5rijfiana presents them as \"pure mundane wisdom\" and \"supramundane wisdom,\" respectively. MPZL (p. 80) says that the former has the nature of merit during subsequent attainment and the latter, the nature of wisdom during meditative equipoise. 903 MCG's (fol. 66b.4-5) reasons for the first two aspirations are as follows. During the subse­quent attainment of the seven impure bhiimis, the afflicted mind is not relinquished yet and thus there arises subtle pride or subtle clinging to a self. On the eighth and ninth bhiimis, by virtue of the afflicted mind having changed state, the equality of oneself and others becomes manifest. MPZL (p. 81) says that the threefold aspiration consists of aspiring for prajftiparamita as being the source of one's own welfare (the dharmakaya), both welfares (the nonabiding nirvir)a), and the welfare of others (the nipakayas). 904 PGBG (pp. 340-41) explains these as dedication (2) not referring to the substances to be dedicated, (3) having the characteristic of the mind that makes the dedication being unmis­taken, ( 4) being free from clinging to the one who makes the dedication as being really existent, (5) being the sphere of mindfulness about emptiness as being the nature of one's own virtues and the accumulations of merit of the buddhas, (6) possessing the skill in the means of not referring to generosity and so on ultimately, (7) being without characteristics in the sense of being emptiness, (8) in which the two realities are in union and in which the buddhas rejoice, (9) through not observing the three realms and its fruition not being included in the three realms. According to MCG (fols. 68a.2-69b.2), (1) is the nature of dedication and (2)-(12) are its divi­sions. (3) Dedication has the characteristic of unmistakenness because there is no mind, self, and so on that makes the dedication. (4) The nature of dedication is that the merit to be accumulated is free from clinging to it as such and such. To (5), MCG adds that it lacks clinging to the merits of buddhas and srivakas as being superior and inferior or better and worse, respectively. (6) To put an end to the clinging to the virtues of the six paramitas as being better and worse entails the skill in means of mentally engaging in the knowledge of all aspects and the prajfia of not observing generosity and such. (7) Through lacking the characteristics of observing the three spheres or clinging solely to nonentities, one puts an end to clinging to anything to be dedicated. (8) refers to unified dedication in which the buddhas rejoice and dwell because they realize its qualities to be conventional illusionlike dependent origination, or to dedicating in exactly the same way as the buddhas. (9) This dedication is not included in the three realms because it does not dedicate anything as a cause for them. Since the merits of sentient beings mentioned in (10-(12) entail referential discriminating notions, they do not even amount to a small fraction of the nonreferential merit of the dharmadhatu dedication. In terms of the manners of dedicating, the above twelve can be summarized into two-dedicating on the level of seeming conventional reality by way of turning virtues into the branches of enlightenment and dedicating ultimately in a nonreferential manner. MPZL (pp. 82-83) says that the nature of dedication is (1) the wisdom during the subsequent attainment of the path of familiarization that is special dedica­tion. What is dedicated are all accumulations of roots of virtue. That which dedicates them are special means and prajfia. They are dedicated as the causes for the function of the fruition (the path) and the supreme fruition itself. The eleven divisions of dedication are in terms of (a) the accumulations that are to be dedicated, (b) the means and prajfia that dedicate them, and (c) the supreme function to which they are dedicated. (a) is twofold in terms of the accumulations of (a) wisdom and (b) merit. (aa) The accumulation of wisdom to be dedicated is the special"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"Notes 823 accumulation of realization without referring to the three spheres. (2) Through not conceiving of the nature of its activity, it has the aspect of the path not being observable. (3) Through not conceiving of the aspect of the agent, it has the characteristic of mind being unmistaken. (4) Through not conceiving of the entities that are its objects, it bears the aspect of realizing the freedom from a self and so on. (ab) The accumulation of merit corresponds to (5) as explained in PBG. (b) consists of the distinctive features of (6) the means to dedicate roots of virtue for perfect enlightenment and (7) the prajiia of being without the characteristics of conceiving of the three spheres. (c) The function of dedication is twofold-( a) general and (b) special. (ca) (8) It accomplishes the intention of the buddhas by way of the buddhas' permission and rejoicing (the favorable condition). (9) It is not limited by being included in the three realms (the adverse factors). (cb) (10)-(12) Its special function consists of dedicating for the attainment of the final fruition of unsurpassable enlightenment, which teaches the paths of lesser persons (the supports of the actual path, such as the ten virtues), middling persons (the temporary path of stream­enterers and so on), and great persons (the final path to unsurpassable enlightenment). In this way, these three other aspects of dedicating roots of virtue as the causes of buddhahood, which possesses the function of teaching the path through the three yanas to those to be guided with the three dispositions, have the function of dedicating virtues as the causes for the welfare of all limitless sentient beings never becoming exhausted. Therefore, these three have the character of producing great immeasurable merit. 905 PGBG (p. 341) says that the wisdom of subsequent attainment of the second bhlimi is expressed in this section as the path of familiarization of mentally engaging in rejoicing because it is the mahayana contaminated subsequent clear realization of rejoicing in roots of virtue through skill in means on the level of seeming reality and nonobservation on the level of the ultimate. 906 MPZL (p. 84) says that the path of familiarization as accomplishment has the nature of the uninterrupted path and the pure path of familiarization, the nature of the path of liberation. 907 Note that the description and division of the above five points differ from PSD, which accords with LSSP. PGBG (pp. 341-42) agrees with PSD/LSSP, phrasing (1) as \"directly seeing the basic nature of form and so on.\" MCG (fol. 70a.3-70b.1) follows PBG up through \"non­formation of anything,\" further glossing the latter as \"accomplishment through realizing the freedom from reference points without clinging to real existence and clinging to characteristics.\" Thereafter, it follows PSD/LSSP, without singling out the mental aspect as PBG does. MPZL (p. 85) says that (1) the feature of the nature of this path is the prajiiapiiramitii of familiarizing during meditative equipoise with all phenomena being without nature. (2) The feature of the quality of this path is that it is the supreme of all branches of the means to accomplish the knowledge of all aspects. (3) Its aspect is the nonformation of any phenomena that constitute reference points in terms of observation and characteristics since all characteristics of clinging and observing are at peace. (4) Its feature of focusing is that the phenomena of the path (such as generosity) are embraced by the aid of nonconceptuality, which is the feature of procuring them without observing. (5) is as above. 908 Both MCG (fols. 70b.2-71a.3) and MPZL (pp. 85-86) say that, under the favorable condi­tions, (1) is the outer condition and (2)-(3) are the inner conditions. According to MCG, under the unfavorable conditions, (1) being under the power of miiras is due to having only little merit and consists of their shooting the five flower arrows that paralyze and make one dull, very dull, faint, and lose one's mind (for details, see Appendix 14H in Brunnholzl2011). (4) Bad friends are those that separate one from nonreferential prajiiapiiramita. According to MPZL, said favor­able conditions are explicitly taught as the causes for the arising of the path of familiarization as accomplishment, but implicitly are also established as the causes for the pure path of famil­iarization. For by virtue of being the causes for the uninterrupted path (the direct cause of the"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"824 Groundless Paths following path of liberation), they are also established as the causes for the path of liberation (the direct result of that uninterrupted path). Under the unfavorable conditions, (1) represents the general one and (2)-(4), the particular conditions that, respectively, first obstruct entering the path; in the middle, prevent the path from becoming pure; and, in the end, obstruct reaching the end of the path. 909 PGBG (p. 342) says that, once the fruition of the approach of virtuous effort has become pure of the stains of its specific cause, the corresponding uninterrupted path, the seeing of the true nature of its objects (such as form) is also pure of these very stains. For these two purities are not different substances in terms of specifically characterized phenomena and they cannot be divided into different isolates in terms of generally characterized phenomena. Therefore, said purities are proclaimed to be of the same type. According to MCG (fols. 71a.6-72a.4), at the point of the path of liberation that is the fruition of the approach of virtuous effort, the pure wisdom (the realizing subject) of having relinquished the factors to be relinquished (such as clinging to real existence) is nothing but the purity of form and such (the objects). For when being empty of real existence is realized with regard to a vase or a pillar, the clinging to their real existence has become pure. The (seeming) real existence of said vase or pillar is of one taste with the purity that is primordial purity. Other than realizing their being pure in this way, thereafter there is no other impurity within that vase itself or that pillar itself, just as one sees forms clearly by virtue of an eye problem having been cleared away. However, it is not the case that all impurities are terminated if one awakens to the single purity of one specific factor to be relinquished. The fruitions of the types of realization of the three yanas are presented by virtue of the manner in which the obscurations of clinging to real existence and clinging to the characteristics of dualistic appearances are purified. When the perceiving subject has become pure in said manner, just like seeing clearly upon an eye problem having been cleared away, the nature of the object is seen exactly as it is. Therefore, the object also appears to be pure. That these two purities of subject and object are not different is by virtue of a pure mind seeing the actual nature of the object. However, the purity of the object naturally abides like that-it is not manufactured as pure by the mind. Therefore, ultimately, all phenomena always abide as having the nature of great primordial purity free from obscurations. Still, the pure actual mode of being of all entities is seen progressively only through the correct path purifying what is observed in a mistaken way through becoming affected by the mistaken mind Oust as a conch is white, but appears as yellow for someone with jaundice). This is the essential point here. MPZL (pp. 86-87) refers to 11.28 as the general topic of identifying the nature of purity and says that this nature is represented by the statement \"Mind is na turally luminous, the stains are adventitious.\" Accordingly, the wisdom of the path of liberation, which is pure of adventitious stains and is the fruition of the uninterrupted path (its cause) having relinquished the adventitious stains that are to be relinquished in the naturally pure basic nature of form and such, comes about by virtue of the essence of the naturally pure basic nature of all phenomena. For these two purities are only different in terms of isolates, but not in terms of the nature of objects, and they are indivisible even by the mind. Therefore, the siitras proclaim that the nature of the fruitional path of libera­tion is the nature of purity. 910 MPZL refers to 11.29 as the elaboration that teaches purity through dividing it into the purities of the four noble ones. Both MCG (fol. 72b.1) and MPZL (p. 87) gloss \"the utter purity of buddhas\" as \"having relinquished both afflictive and cognitive obscurations, including their latent tendencies.\" 911 MPZL (p. 86) refers to 11.30-31 as the pertinent topic of this section-the actual pure path of familiarization. 912 PGBG (p. 343) adds that, by contrast, the ninefold paths of familiarization of the inferior yanas only purify limited factors to be relinquished. MPZL (p. 88) says that the above-mentioned"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"Notes 825 nine levels of saip.sara include all innate factors to be relinquished, which are relinquished through the wisdoms of the paths of liberation of the pure path of familiarization from the second through the tenth bhiimis. As for the manner in which these factors to be relinquished are relinquished, on the second bhiimi the greater of the great degrees of all the factors of said nine levels to be relinquished are relinquished together. The same goes for the following bhiimis and the corresponding degrees of factors to be relinquished until, finally, on the tenth bhiimi the lesser of the lesser degrees of all the factors of the nine levels are relinquished. In this way, the entirety of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations is purified. 913 In other words, the objector holds that great factors to be relinquished must be relin-quished by correspondingly great remedies and small ones by small remedies. 914 MCG (fol. 73a.2-73b.2) adds \"that it is not reasonable for the remedies in one realm to be able to eliminate the obscurations of all three realms\" to the above qualm. The reply on the ultimate level is that neither factors to be relinquished and remedies nor greater and lesser are established, while the conventional example is as above. The nonreferential wisdom of the meditative equipoise of the path of familiarization does not conceive of any real verifying cog­nition and what is verified by it as being different as subject and object. It is by virtue of realizing their equality that this wisdom is asserted as the special type of realization of the mahiyina that serves as the remedy for the factors of the three realms to be relinquished. MPZL (p. 89) further glosses \"great equality\" as \"lack of arising.\" Through explicitly teaching the division of the pure path of familiarization and the rebuttal of disputes about it, the manner in which the purities of srivakas and pratyekabuddhas are limited and the purity of buddhas is utterly so will also be realized. It is for this reason that master Haribhadra emphasizes the explanation of this implicit meaning. However, it appears that those who do not understand this and present explanations that confuse what is explicit and implicit lose the explicit meaning, which consists of the pure path of familiarization. 915 The Tibetan has \"extreme\" (mthal 916 PGBG (p. 344) says that the realization of noble bodhisattvas who wish for path prajdipiramiti abides neither in saip.sira, nor n�a. nor in between because it is the knowl­edge of noble bodhisattvas of directly realizing all phenomena in the three times as equality, that is, lacking real existence. For MCG's comments in addition to PBG, see endnote 480. According to MPZL (p. 90), emptiness with a heart of compassion-the wisdom of seeing saip.sira and �a as equality (not abiding in saip.sira through prajfii, not abiding in nirviJ.ta through compassion, and therefore not abiding anywhere in between either)-realizes the fundamental nature of entities, that is, the inseparability of the seeming phenomena of the three times (skan­dhas and so on) and their true nature, great ultimate equality. Therefore, it is asserted as having the nature of prajfiipiramiti. 917 PGBG (pp. 344-45) says that the reason for being distant from the fruitional mother is to not know how to accomplish this mother because of observing characteristics of enti­ties (due to not realizing the equality of the three times) and lacking skill in means (due to lacking mahiyina mentors). Noble bodhisattvas are close to the fruitional mother because they possess the skill in means of the two realities being in union. According to MCG (fol. 75a.3-75b.2), the hinayina system is to be distant from the perfect mother (the knowledge of entities or the fruitional mother) for the following reasons. Due to clinging to the characteristics of the phenomena of ground, path, and fruition, one does not realize equality, just as it is. If one engages in that way through observing the characteristics of entities and nonentities, one lacks the means to accomplish enlightenment (such as prajfii and means in union). The knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas does not conceive of the characteristics of entities and nonentities, but realizes them as equality. Thus, though suchness is neither close nor distant from phenomena, through possessing the skill in the means to properly realize this, the knowledge of entities of"},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":"826 Groundless Paths bodhisattvas is close to the fruitional mother. MPZL (p. 92) adds that the knowledge of entities of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas is like illusionists clinging to their own illusions, thus being distant from the fruitional mother. 918 PGBG (p. 345) says that the knowledges of entities of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas are the antagonistic factors of the bodhisattva path because they are factors to be relinquished by this path, that is because these knowledges entail the above three sets of discriminating notions. MPZL (p. 93) classifies the first two discriminating notions as clinging to the phenomena con­tained in the two realities and the third one as clinging to the person who engages in the path. That is, one clings to the skandhas as being the ultimate phenomenon that is emptiness and to the bearers of the nature of emptiness as being the seeming phenomena included in the three times. One also clings to the six paramitas (the uncommon path) and the factors concordant with enlightenment (the common path) as \"I,\" the one who engages in the path. Implicitly, the discriminating notions of clinging to the remedies of these notions are also taught to be antagonistic factors to be relinquished. There appear different systems such as saying that these notions exist only in the mind streams of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas. However, it appears to be the intention of the AA here that said notions exist in �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas in a gen­eral way, but that bodhisattvas also possess them in the form of factors to be relinquished. Up through the seventh bhiimi, they sometimes even have manifest clinging to characteristics. Their relinquishment of the clinging to a person is complete from the seventh bhiimi onward, while their relinquishment of the clinging to phenomena is complete at the end of the continuum of the ten bhiimis. 919 PGBG (p. 345) says that the uninterrupted path of the path of seeing of noble bodhisat­tvas, which does not cling to \"me\" (in the form of the three spheres) with regard to generosity and such and enjoins others to this, is the remedy for the imputational obscurations of clinging to the characteristics of generosity and such because it is the mahayana uninterrupted path of stopping all extremes of attachment through engaging in the basic nature of phenomena. MCG (fol. 75b.4-6) glosses \"extreme of attachment\" as \"clinging to real existence in terms of the fruition (the victors and so on)\" and says that III.4ac describes the remedial knowledge of entities of bodhisattvas. MPZL (p. 94) takes III.4ab as representing the knowledge of entities that is common to bodhisattvas and �ravakas-the realization of the remedy that is personal identitylessness. 920 MPZL (p. 94) takes III.4cd-6 as representing the uncommon mahayana knowledge of entities of realizing phenomenal identitylessness. 111.4cd explains the reason for having to real­ize entities as being free from extremes. Bodhisattvas must stop all coarse and subtle extremes of attachment in terms of observing and clinging. For otherwise there would be the flaw of the subtle extreme of attachment to the perfect buddhas and so on. 921 PGBG (p. 346) says that focusing on special objects as being really existent is also a factor to be relinquished on the path of bodhisattvas because the path that is the basic nature of all phenomena is free from being established by any nature of its own. Therefore, natural emptiness is the profound actuality. MCG (fol. 76a.3) glosses \"free by nature\" as \"free from all reference points such as saJp.sira, nirvaJ}.a, entity, and nonentity.\" 922 PGBG (p. 346) says that the wisdom of directly knowing that the phenomena of noble bodhisattvas are of a single nature in that they are empty of real existence is the remedy for clinging to characteristics of the fruition because it is the wisdom that relinquishes the attach­ment of clinging to characteristics. According to MCG (fol. 76a.4-6), through realizing that all phenomena of saJp.sira and nirval}.a have the single nature of great profound equality without anything to be divided or eliminated, all clinging attachment will be relinquished. Through this, the extremes of both existence and peace are naturally put to an end. MPZL (pp. 94-95) takes III.5 as describing the feature of the wisdom of realizing entities as equality. Since the path of"},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":"Notes 827 realizing the identitylessness of dharmas (the entities) is the basic nature of objects (all phe­nomena being free from any reference points of a nature), suchness is profound. Through the cognizing subject of this-the clear realization of the profound knowledge of entities-knowing that phenomena (the entities) are one in being the equality of identitylessness, all coarse and subtle extremes of attachment to be relinquished are relinquished. 923 According to PGBG (p. 346), natural emptiness is said to be difficult to realize and thus, implicitly, to be profound because it has the nature of being rejected through valid perceptions such as the direct seeing of minds that entail clinging to extremes. 924 PGBG (p. 346) says that natural emptiness is asserted to be inconceivable by the mind that realizes it because said mind does not cognize it as any entity such as form. MCG (fol. 76a.6-76b.6) comments on III.6 as a unit-the reason why the nature of phenomena is profound. The nature of phenomena is not to be known as anything such as entities (form and so on) or nonentities. Therefore, it rejects the conventions of seeing and hearing and so on through the cognizing subjects of conventional valid cognition (such as an eye consciousness). By virtue of that, this nature is said to be profound and difficult to realize. Since it is beyond the scope of the minds of ordinary beings, it is the object of personally experienced wisdom. It is not seen by conventional valid cognition because the character of all phenomena from form up through the unique buddha qualities is the basic nature of the mother. The unity of appearance and emptiness-great equality-is never separated or newly conjoined with appearances, but they are emptiness from the very time of their appearing. Therefore, prajfiaparamita is held to be inconceivable. Since �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize this equality, they fall into the extreme of nirviil)a. On the other hand, this represents the ultimate essential point of it being impossible for bodhisattvas who see it to deviate from the mahayana path. Therefore, it is the crucial point of prajfiapiiramita and one should know how to explain all its topics in the begin­ning, middle, and end in accordance with this principle, thus grasping the heart of the matter. Similarly, MPZL (p. 95) takes III.6 as describing the distinctive feature of the great profundity of prajfiaparamita. As for its feature of being difficult to realize through the cognizing subjects that consist of the valid cognitions of seeing just this life, the basic nature of prajfiaparamita is profound by virtue of not being the sphere of any mental states that are consciousnesses because it rejects what is seen by them. Thus, in the siitras it is said to be profound because it is difficult to be realized by any other yanas. As for the nature of the object being inconceivable, since the siitras teach that the profound nature of entities is not known as any of the aspects of the four extremes in terms of existence and nonexistence (such as form), it is asserted to be inconceivable. 925 See PSD's more detailed explanation of this. 926 PGBG (p. 347) explains under (3) that imaginary and the perfect forms are, respectively, incomplete and complete as the support of qualities. (4) refers to not clinging to the lack of attachment to form and so on being really existent. According to MCG (fols. 77a.3-78b.4), (1)­(4) are classified in terms of their objects; (5)-(7), in terms of their natures; (8)-(9), in terms of their functions; and (10), in terms of the examples that cause understanding. Under (3), MCG comments that imaginary form means that form and so on are incomplete as the foundation of qualities, which refers to the perception of form by ordinary beings. That is, no matter how much they focus on forms as being forms by way of clinging to these forms while they are appearing in a dualistic manner, the qualities of the path are not produced. The form of the nature of phenomena is the perfect nature empty of a real other-dependent nature, which refers to the subsequent attainments of noble ones. If they focus on this form that is specified by lacking a nature of its own, they see it as illusionlike and therefore the qualities of the path are produced in a complete manner. (4) refers to not clinging to the lack of attachment to these three kinds of form (imaginary, other-dependent, and perfect) as being really existent ultimately. Among"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"828 Groundless Paths these fo ur trainings, the first three fo cus on the seeming and the last one, on the ultimate. Thus, they counteract various ways of clinging to the bearers of the nature of phenomena. The next five trainings deal with clinging to the nature of phenomena, prajnaparamita. Thus, (5) refers to not clinging to the realization of prajfiaparamitii being without change because, in its nature, there is no increase or decrease through it being taught or not taught. (6) means that one does not cling to prajfiapiiramita ultimately not existing as an agent that pacifies praise, blame, attach­ment, hatred, and so on. That is, one does not cling to the nature of phenomena because, by virtue of its being unconditioned, it is neither produced by anybody nor does it ultimately pro­duce anything. (7) It is difficult to aim at the knowledge of all aspects, train in the knowledge of the path, and make the knowledge of entities workable because, ultimately, there is nothing to be attained, to be generated, and to be taught, respectively. On the level of seeming reality, one must rely on these three knowledges because they are what is to be attained, what is to be known, what is to be relinquished, respectively. However since it is not appropriate to cling to them as such, they are difficult to engage in. Under (8), \"wishing for fruitfulness\" is glossed as \"one's training in prajftapiiramitii not going to waste.\" (9) One does not cling to the following­all the qualities of the path and the fruition are complete, when the mother is present because they do not depend on anything other than this very mother. Under (10), \"dreams\" are glossed as \"appearing as transformations of the latent tendencies of clinging\" and optical illusions are explained as reflections, circling firebrands, and shadows. According to MPZL (pp. 96-98), this tenfold division of the training represents its objects and the fo urfold lack of conceit in III.10cd, the cognitive aspects of the training that are the subjects. The ten trainings are divided into (a) those that have the nature of meditative equipoise and (b) the one that has the nature of subsequent attainment The first are twofold-the trainings that stop engaging in clinging to (aa) appearances (the bearers of the nature of phenomena) and (ab) emptiness (the nature of phenomena). (aa) consists of stopping such clinging with regard to (aa1) objects and (aa2) the subject. (aa1) One stops clinging to (1) form and such as the bases of the attributes of appear­ances, (2) impermanence and so on as their general attributes, and (3) their being incomplete and complete, respectively, as their common and uncommon particular attributes. (aa2) consists of ( 4)-stopping clinging to the nature of detachment, which is the subject of stopping clinging to (1)-(3). (ab) The trainings in stopping clinging to emptiness refer to clinging to emptiness as (abl) an object and (ab2) the subject. (ab1) One stops clinging to (5) the nature of emptiness (the nature of phenomena) not changing into anything else throughout all situations and (6) its feature of there being no agent that is not produced by causes and conditions. (ab2) consists of not clinging to (7) the threefold feature of the nature of realization as the subject-the three knowledges as explained by MCG, (8) the feature of the function of the subject-wishing for attaining the fruitions of the four kinds of noble ones, according to one's destiny, through the three knowledges, and (9) the distinctive feature of the subject-said fruitions not being depen­dent on any other causes and conditions because they arise from the three knowledges. (b) The training during subsequent attainment consists of (10) not clinging to the seven examples that make one understand that all conventional appearances during subsequent attainment have the nature of illusory phenomena-being nonexistent and yet appearing. 927 MCG (fols. 78b.4-79a.2) says that the realization of the equality of subject and object, which is free from the four kinds of conceit, represents the general mode of apprehension of these ten trainings. It adds that the fo urfold lack of conceit can also be explained as respectively referring to the fo ur doors to liberation-emptiness, signlessness, wishlesness, and nonforma­tion. MPZL (pp. 98-99) also explains this in terms of said fo ur doors and identifies the fo ur lacks of conceit as the cognitive aspects of the training (the cognizing subjects), also referred to as \"the fo ur equalities.\" It says that the third lack of conceit (about fo rm as being \"mine\") refers to the aspects of form (such as its being impermanent), while the fourth one refers to unarisen phenomena (such as the cognizing subject of form)."},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"Notes 829 928 The Sanskrit of lines III.llab (dharmajnananvayajnanaqantijnanaqa�;�atmakab; cor­responding to lines be in the translation) is a single and-given the usual order of the fo ur readinesses and cognitions-somewhat peculiar compound, which may be broken down in more than one way. For example, the Tibetan has an \"and\" between \"dharma cognition, subsequent cognition\" and \"readiness ... \" However, most commentaries simply read this as \"readiness for dharma cognition, dharma cognition, readiness fo r subsequent cognition, and subsequent cogni­tion.\" From a Sanskrit perspective (as represented in the translation), it seems more likely that qantijnanaqanatmakab represents a compound on its own, with its general sense being instan­tiated by dharmajnana and anvayajnana. This seems to be how PBG reads it. Alternatively, the overall compound could also be read as \"has the character of momentary cognitions-dharma cognition, subsequent cognition, and their readinesses.\" 929 MCG (79a.5-79b.3) says that all phenomena are primordially and naturally pure and luminous and never stray away from this natural state. Therefore, even at the time when they appear as if mistaken, impure entities are impossible and they do not go beyond complete purity. Thus, the wisdom of realizing that suffering is neither permanent nor impermanent is the dharma readiness of suffering. Being beyond the extremes of suffering and nonsuffering is the dharma cognition of being free from permanence and extinction. (3) and (4) are as in PBG. These fo ur are the aspects of realizing that all phenomena of the reality of suffering are naturally pure. 930 The Tibetan of line III.12d has \"being without attachment\" (chags pa spangs pa) and PBG comments accordingly. 931 Under (8), against all other commentaries, PGSD (p. 348) has \"because of being liberated from flaws and nonflaws.\" However, this is most probably due to a scribe mistaking the simi­larly sounding Tibetan words for \"condition\" and \"flaw.\" Under (7), MCG (fol. 79b.3-6) glosses \"grasping\" as \"grasping at real existence\" and says in conclusion that these are the fo ur aspects of realizing that all aspects of karma and afflictions (the origin of suffering) are completely pure. 932 Under (11), PGBG (p. 349) adds \"being beyond the extremes of permanence and extinc­tion\" to \"being utterly pure.\" MCG (fol. 80a.3) says that these are the fo ur aspects of perfect wisdom realizing prajiiaparamita-the reality of cessation-in a nonreferential manner. 933 Under (16), MCG (80a.6-80b.1) glosses \"permanent benefit\" as \"the knowledge of all aspects and its causes\" and says in conclusion that these are the fo ur aspects of not observing the true nature of the reality of the path. 934 MPZL (p. 101) says that the wisdom that bears the aspects of being free from said thirty-two superimpositions and includes all types of realization of the three yanas is taught in the siitras by way of the isolates of these sixteen moments of the knowledge of entities. What is explicitly taught in this way represents the path of seeing of bodhisattvas that includes all realizations of the three yanas. There is no reason given here fo r not teaching the path of familiarization of bodhisattvas because this path is easy to understand implicitly from what was taught on it in the context of the knowledge of the path. The path of seeing in the mind streams of sravakas is explained implicitly through the path of seeing taught here, but their path of familiarization is not taught because this chapter is not a suitable context for teaching it in either an explicit or an implicit manner, which is clearly explained in the Vivrti (see the corresponding section in PSD). 935 As for the order of the three knowledges in this summary, MCG (fol. 80b.5-6) agrees with PBG, while PGBG (p. 350) and MPZL (pp. 101-2) have the reverse order. The latter justi­fies this by saying that this summary represents the link to the complete training in all aspects. Generally, both explanations are fo und in different Indian and Tibetan commentaries (for"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"830 Groundless Paths example, Haribhadra's commentaries present the regular order, while the two Vunuktisenas have the reverse order). 936 PGBG (p. 351) says that the specific instances of the wisdom of mahayana noble ones cognizing the basic nature of entities represent \"aspects\" and fully qualified remedies because they are the remedies for wrongly engaging in entities (the aspects of the four realities) as being permanent and so on. 937 On the aspects of the first three realities, MCG (fols. 82a.6-83b.5) comments as fol­lows-(5) lacking a basis for the production of suffering, (6) being the mode of being of space without arising and ceasing, (8) there being no names (the four name skandhas not existing ultimately), (9) lacking going anywhere because there is nothing to be attained in terms of com­ing or going, (10) what cannot be seized not being taken away through any aspects, and (11) ultimately, the stains will not be exhausted, are not exhausted, and have not been exhausted. As for the aspects of the reality of the path, they consist of the object to be realized that is in common with the sriivakas-aspects (13)-(16) taught through the isolates of personal identity­lessness-and the realization of pratyekabuddhas that apprehended objects are without nature. The latter is divided into the subsequent attainment of the contaminated path of familiariza­tion taught through the five examples (17)-(21) and the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing taught through (22)-(27), which are the remedies for coarse cognitive obscurations and the cognitive obscurations of the path of seeing, respectively. (17)-(27) are presented from the point of view of pratyekabuddhas realizing only that outer referents are without nature. In the mahayana, they are to be taken literally in the sense of all phenomena being without nature. Differing from PBG, said aspects are to realize that there are (13) no self that engages in the path (no agent), (14) no one who cognizes the appropriate path, (15) no one who transits higher or accomplishes an unmistaken mind stream based on a mistaken one, (16) no one who subdues the afflictions through the path that delivers from karma and afflictions, and (22)-(23) neither afflicted nor purified outer referents because there are no outer referents or because the wisdom of equality is without afflicted and purified outer referents. (24) means to be untainted by the latent tendencies of afflicted phenomena and (27), to be immovable because of realizing that one does not deteriorate from having already attained the realization of outer referents not existing. According to MPZL (pp. 103-4), the aspects of the reality of suffering are to realize that its basic nature (1) lacks the reference points of being or not being impermanent, (2) is without the arising of the reference points of suffering and nonsuffering, (3) is free from the reference points of being or not being empty, and (4) is not subdued by the reference points of a self and realizing the lack of a self. The aspects of the origin of suffering are to realize that its basic nature (5) lacks a basis for the reference points of causes and noncauses, ( 6) is like space in lacking the reference points of origin and nonorigin, (7) is inexpressible as the reference points of arising and nonarising, and (8) lacks the names of the reference points of conditions and nonconditions. The aspects of cessation are to realize that its basic nature (9) does not go any­where in that it lacks the reference points of cessation and noncessation, (10) is not taken away by the reference points of peace and nonpeace, (11) is inexhaustible in that it lacks the reference points of excellence and nonexcellence, and (12) is without the arising of the reference points of what is and what is not final deliverance. The four aspects of the path of realizing personal identitylessness as the remedy for the afflictive obscurations are to realize that its basic nature has (13) no agent, (14) no cognizer, (15) no one who transits, and (16) no subduer because of respectively lacking the reference points of the path and what is not the path, what is and what is not appropriate, accomplishment and nonaccomplishment, and what is and what is not con­ducive to deliverance. The next five and the last six, respectively, are the aspects of the paths that are the contaminated wisdom of subsequent attainment and the uncontaminated wisdom of meditative equipoise of realizing phenomenal identitylessness as the remedy for the cogni­tive obscurations. Among these, one realizes that (22)-(23) the nonexistence of afflicted and"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"Notes 831 purified phenomena, (24) being untainted, (25) lacking reference points, (26) no conceit, and (27) being immovable, respectively, are the remedies for conceptions about afflicted and purified phenomena, latent tendencies, characteristics of reference points, one's own clear realizations, and deterioration. One should understand that these aspects of the knowledge of entities also comprise the common types of realization of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. 938 In this section, words in italics represent the well-known sixteen aspects of the four reali­ties in the abhidharma. 939 According to MCG (fols. 83b.S-85b.4), (I)-(3) are the respective remedies for the desir­ous striving to obtain what one desires and has not encountered (the main cause of sa�psara), craving for and clinging to what one has obtained, and delight in rebirths under the influence of (I) and (2). (7)-(8) respectively relinquish the mistaken imagination of fo rmer and later and the clinging to sentient beings. (I6)-(I9) are respectively glossed as momentarily changing, either one of the three types of suffering, being devoid of a self that is another referent, and lacking a personal identity-being devoid of such an identity's own nature. (20) That suffering does not have any characteristics is due to the above four being one as the nature of phenomenal identitylessness. The emptinesses (2I)-(3I) are all pure of adventitious stains and represent the afflictions being at peace because they are free from the corresponding modes of apprehension. The emptinesses (32)-(36) are endowed with both purities. MPZL (pp. IOS-6) glosses \"striv­ing,\" \"desire,\" and \"delight in rebirths\" in (I)-(3) as \"cause,\" \"nature,\" \"and result,\" respectively. Through relinquishing them, one is respectively free from desire, does not dwell in sa�psara, and is at peace. (7) Through having relinquished imagination (the cause), one lacks afflictions (the result). (8) Through having relinquished clinging to sentient beings, one realizes that there are no sentient beings. That the Buddha gave no reason for (IS) is due to his having in mind the special greatness of dependent origination. (20) means that the nature of suffering does not have any characteristics of reference points. 940 Both PGBG (p. 352) and MCG (fols. 85b.4-86a.I, 88b.S-6, and 89a.3) say that the aspects of the knowledge of all aspects are divided in terms of the three knowledges because the knowl­edge of all aspects consists of the qualities that accord approximately with those that exist in srivakas and bodhisattvas, respectively, and the uncommon qualities that exist solely in perfect buddhas. MCG adds that since the knowledge of all aspects is the cognizing subject of all aspects of entities and the path, it knows all the aspects of the above two knowledges as well. The last three aspects of suchness, the self-arisen, and buddhahood are respectively explained as realiz­ing the basic nature in an unmistaken manner, attaining self-arisen wisdom without depending on anything else, and realizing all aspects of knowable objects without exception without mixing them. 94I Among the three fe atures of those who are vessels for listening, PGBG (p. 352) classifies the first two as the inner mentor of having trained their mind streams and the third one as the outer mentor. These vessels for listening are the bodhisattvas on the path of accumulation who are held by these two kinds of mentors. The remaining three vessels refer to the bodhisattvas on the path of preparation who are held by the outer mentor of having attended to buddhas and having asked them and the inner mentor of having engaged in the paramitas. MCG (fol. 90a.S-90b.4) speaks of rendering duties and so on to past and present buddhas in their actual fo rms or through visualizing them. In due order, the above four are the vessels for not only listening to the mother, but also for not being afraid upon hearing her and thus accepting her readily and taking her to mind, retaining her meaning through reflecting and meditating without fo rgetting, and mentally engaging in her and practicing her in a proper manner, thus giving rise to experiences and realizations. According to MPZL (pp. Ill-12), lines IV.6ab represent the condition and the cause for being a proper vessel for prajiiaparamita in general. In terms of being particular vessels, those who are protected by genuine spiritual friends in this life are the vessels for first"},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"832 Groundless Paths listening to profound prajftapilramita with the prajfta of hearing. Those who have attended to the buddhas in this and former lives and have asked them questions about the meaning of pro­found prajiiapilramita are the vessels for taking the words of profound prajftapilramita to mind and retaining their meanings with the prajfta of reflecting. Those who have trained in a supreme manner in the six pilramitas for many lifetimes are the vessels for mentally engaging in profound yoga in a proper manner with the prajfta of meditating. 942 03791, fols. 184b.7-185a.2 (for the quote, see the corresponding section in PSD). 943 Like most commentaries, PGBG (p. 353) divides these twenty trainings into the five natu­ral and the fifteen situational ones. The obstructions under (10) are explained as the four maras and the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. (15) is the training in not seeing any phenom­ena of SIIJP.sira, what are not phenomena of saJp.sara, and so on as really existent. (19) is the training in the nature being pure of the stains of apprehender and apprehended. MCG (fols. 90b.6-92b.6) says that the first five are classifications in terms of the nature of the training, while the next fifteen are classifications in terms of the boundary lines of the training. The first two trainings are the actual trainings in familiarizing with prajiiipiramita because they represent the nonconceptual wisdom of prajftapiramita in which subject and object are ultimately not two. When this prajiiapilramita is divided in terms of the isolates of entities, path, and aspects, (3)-(5) are the trainings as named in PBG because the suchness of entities (such as form) is profound, the phenomena of the path are difficult to fathom, and the nature of what consists of all aspects (the fruition that is the knowledge of all aspects) is immeasurable, respectively. The names of these five trainings refer to their respective cognizing subjects. Under (7), those on the path of accumulation with sharp faculties are glossed as \"those who mentally engage in prajftaparamita even in their dreams.\" (13)-(17) The five trainings on the eighth bhiim.i are explained from the point of view of its qualities. They are explained in the ways they are because, on the eighth bhiimi, nonconceptual wisdom has matured, due to which bodhisattvas dwell in equality throughout meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment. In particular, (14) is glossed as the means to perfect the familiarization with prajiiapiramita. Under (15), what is not observed also includes what is to be adopted and what is to be rejected. (19) The wisdom of the tenth bhiimi is call ed \"the training in pure familiarization.• It is referred to as pure because it is pure of even the most subtle obscurations of the impregnations of negative tendencies of which the lower bhiim.is were not pure. Thus, it is the most supreme purity of the path of learning. (20) means to meditate in set periods of time and thus draw a line between meditating and not meditating. This is the means for accomplishing all the other trainings. MPZL (pp. 112-14) clas­sifies these trainings as follows. (1)-(2) represent the nature of profound prajiia-the samadhi of great equality; (3)-(5), the aspects of vast means-the divisions of the trainings in the three knowledges; and (6)-(20), the specific practices of the situational trainings in terms of their boundary lines. (1) is the training in nonabiding because one realizes that the nature of the emp­tiness of objects (the entities that consist of ground, path, and fruition) does not abide in any extreme. (2) is the training in nontraining because the subject-the aspect of prajftaparamita that is the nature of the three knowledges-is not involved in any extremes of reference points. These two trainings consist of the meditative equipoise of familiarizing with all 173 aspects of the complete training in all aspects in a combined manner as the single aspect of lacking arising (the samadhi without appearances) and of the subsequent attainment of familiarizing with all of said aspects individually (the samadhi with appearances). (3)-(5) are the three divisions of (1) and (2) in terms of their objects and are glossed as familiarizing, in the manner of not abid­ing and not training, with the twenty-seven aspects of the knowledge of entities, the thirty-six aspects of the knowledge of the path, and the 110 aspects of the fruition, respectively (beyond that, they are explained as in MCG). The familiarization with these five natural trainings is understood from the progression of the situational trainings (6)-(20). That is, one familiarizes, through not abiding and not training, with said 173 aspects in the manner of alternating the"},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"Notes 833 above-explained meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment from the path of accumula­tion up through the tenth bhiimi during the respective situational trainings. In particular, on the eighth bhfuni, bodhisattvas (13) turn the wheel of dharma for the welfare of others through great compassion (the means), (14) by virtue of having gained mastery over conceptuality, real­ize in general that all phenomena are without increase and decrease, and, (15)-(17) in particular, conceive neither of dharmas and nondharmas (such as form), nor of form and so on being inconceivable, nor of any characteristic or nature of form and so on. Training (20) exists from the path of accumulation up through the end of the continuum, separating the sessions and breaks of all the preceding trainings. 944 This verse and the next ones on the flaws are not found in LSSP, but represent Patrul Rinpoche's mnemonic synopses based on the more detailed explanations in PSD/LSSP. PGBG (p. 354) does not comment on III.12. MCG (fols. 93a.1-94a.2) largely agrees with the corre­sponding section of PSD except for (6), which accords with PBG. According to MPZL (p. 117), (1)-(5) are the general qualities, with (I), (2), and (4) additionally being glossed as being the qualities of being free from adverse conditions, the favorable conditions being complete, and the fruition, respectively. (6)-(13) are the particular qualities, in due order being additionally glossed as being the qualities of one's birthplace in other lifetimes, the path (the supported), the persons (the supports), not being affected by adverse conditions, practicing the dharma (the cause), the distinctive feature that is the condition, the fruition to be attained, and the distinctive feature of the activity. (I4) represents the special quality of perfecting prajfiaparamita. 945 PBG has \"measureD (tshad), which in PSD belongs to (II), while (IO) is \"aim» (ched). Thus, since this is most probably a typo in the Tibetan, it is emended here accordingly. 946 Note that the numbering here follows PSD-(2I)-(23) in PSD are presented last in PBG. 947 For the divisions of these flaws in MCG and MPZL, see endnote 583. 948 PGBG (p. 354) says that what defines is able to define what is to be defined. Therefore, it should be known as the defining characteristic. Here it is twofold. (1) What establishes an agent is threefold (knowledge, distinctiveness, and activity) and (2) what establishes an object is one (the defining characteristic of the nature, which is also what is defined). According to MPZL (p. I20), what defines the mahayana training-the nature of special prajfia and means-should be understood as having the nature of being the defining characteristic in this context. It is three­fold in terms of being presented by way of knowledge, distinctiveness, and activity. In this way, the nature of the training is the basis that is defined. 949 Here PBG has ngo bo nyid med pa'i, which does not make much sense. LSSP says ngo bo nyid med paf:lm-\"For within the lack of nature, or for the five visions of tathigatas, it does not appear as something visible.\" Both MCG and MPZL read ngo bo (nyid) med pas. Since this makes the most sense, the translation follows it, emending PBG accordingly. 950 The Sanskrit for \"furthermore\" in N.I6d is rendered in the Tibetan as de las gzhan yang in IV.16c, while \"knowing these as aspects of suchness» makes up IV.I6d. Thus, PBG includes de las gzhan yang in its comments on (IS) as the phrase \"in another way than the ... » 95I Here PBG mistakenly repeats \"communicate» (bstan pa), but LSSP has btags pa. 952 According to MCG (fols. 98b.I-IOOb.2), through relying on the mother who is the train­ing in the knowledge of entities, one knows that (I) tathagatas appeared in the past and so on. Under (2), one also knows the five skandhas without error conventionally. Under (3), the eighty-four thousand conducts of the mind are divided into twenty-one thousand each in terms of desire, hatred, ignorance, and all three equally. Under (6), \"the aspect of inexhaustibility» is glossed as \"the essence of the nature of phenomena.» Under (10), \"mind» is glossed as \"the one who analyzes.» Some texts say that these sixteen are not definite in number because the Buddha"},{"pageNumber":835,"pageContent":"834 Groundless Paths enumerated them in the prajiiiiparamitii siitras while having in mind the mental framework of those to be guided who were present at that time. However, though it is true that he taught exactly these sixteen from the perspective of the mental framework of said disciples, they can be summarized into two-(1) conventionally seeing the five skandhas of sentient beings in general and their mental conducts in particular in a distinct manner and (2) ultimately seeing that they are without nature. When classified in detail, they are indeed countless, but the sixteen taught here are important to know in order to promote the welfare of those to be guided. Therefore, they implicitly contain all other points to be known too. Consequently, one understands that it is not the case that there is no reason for teaching exactly sixteen here. This way of under­standing should also be applied to all other such cases. According to MPZL (pp. 121-22), these sixteen consist of knowing the basic nature of entities (a) in general, (b) in particular, and (c) specifically. (a) consists of (1) knowing that the fruition of a tathiigata appears in dependence on realizing the basic nature of entities and (2) knowing the seeming nature of entities-the five skandhas arising and perishing-and that they do not arise and perish ultimately. (b) consists of the manners of knowing (a) mind's divisions and summaries in general, (b) the divisions of the factors to be relinquished and their remedies in particular, and (c) the divisions of the focuses of mind in specific. (ba) When the forms of mental conduct are divided conventionally, they are eighty-four thousand and so on as in (3). When summarized, they are (4) and (5)-mind being or not being in meditative equipoise. ( 6) Ultimately, they have the nature of inexhaustible suchness. Under (bb), (7) and (8) represent the factors to be relinquished and their remedies, respectively, while (9) both have the nature of the vast dharmadhiitu ultimately. (be) consists of (10)-(13). (10) Since said mind engages in all kinds of focal objects conventionally, the range of its focus is great. ( 11) The cognizing subjects-the aspects that apprehend these focal objects­are immeasurable in number. (12)-(13) are as above. (c) consists of (14) knowing, through the particulars of the fourteen undecided views, the views about phenomena and persons on the conventional level, (15) knowing, through the distinctive feature of entities being without nature ultimately, the true nature of the mind (suchness and identitylessness), and (16) knowing that, through realizing suchness in this way, the dharmakiiya of realization manifests and that teaching this to others makes the dharmakiiya appear in them too. 953 This could also be read as \"all phenomena are the emptiness of any nature.\" 954 MCG (fols. 90b.4-91b.1) glosses \"no arising\" in knowledge (4) further as \"from itself, something other, both, or without a cause.\" (5) There is no ceasing of anything that existed before. \"Foundation\" in (10) is also glossed as \"or is established by a nature of its own.\" (ll) All phenomena are suchness and the natural nirv�a, in which all reference points are at peace, thus having the defining characteristics of space. That is, the nature of phenomena cannot be produced, or it is uncontrived. (12) Whether buddhas have arrived or not, the basic nature of phenomena cannot be changed by anybody among gods and humans. Therefore, the nature of phenomena is unperturbed. To (15), MCG adds \"and that, ultimately, there are no such distinc­tions.\" Through resting in the actuality of the nature of phenomena that is without affirmation and negation, the suchness and intention of all phenomena are of equal taste. It is the mean­ing of what is taught by way of the isolates of this-suchness-that is asserted as the defining characteristic of knowledge in the context of the knowledge of the path. According to MPZL (pp. 122-24), these sixteen consist of knowing the basic nature of the path (a) in general, (b) in particular, and (c) specifically. (a) consists of (1)-(3) as above. (b) consists of the manners of knowing the path in terms of the particulars of (a) its nature being empty, (b) causes being signless, and (c) results being wishless. (ba) Thus, the nature has (4)-(7) no arising and so on, (8) no entities to be rejected, (9) no remedies, (10 no abiding foundation, and (ll) is suchness, which has the characteristics of space. (bb) consists of (12) the nature of the path being unper­turbed by any reference points of characteristics. (be) consists of (13) the nature of the path not being formed as the phenomena of the fruition and (14) the nonconceptuality with regard to"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"Notes 835 its distinctive features. (c) consists of (15) the nature of the path being conventionally distin­guished by the three yanas and ( 16) the defining characteristics of these also being unobservable ultimately. 955 PBG mistakenly has rang bzhin, but LSSP has the correct rang gzhan. 956 MCG (fols. 101b.2-102b.6) explains that one knows the following. (1) The buddhas, through relying on their own uncommon distinctive feature (the fruitional mother who is the knowledge of all aspects), abide in the equality of saqtsaric existence and peace-the wisdom of blissfully abiding amidst visible phenomena. Under (5), \"worshipping through practice\" is added. (8) The buddhas teach the profound nature of phenomena that is not seen by worldly beings, or they teach that not seeing form and so on as any extreme whatsoever is to see the ultimate. (11) They mature the mind streams of those to be guided through the latter under­standing what they have heard by way of reflecting upon it. ( 12) They liberate the mind streams of those to be guided by way of the latter familiarizing themselves with, and thus directly real­izing, the meaning about which they have gained certainty through reflecting. (13) They teach the essence of the nature of phenomena to be inconceivable because it is beyond being an object of mundane examination and analysis. (14) They teach that all phenomena are the peace of natural nirvar}a, or that all reference points of a cognizing subject are at peace in the nature of phenomena. In brief, through the training in the knowledge of entities, one realizes the seeming and ultimate modes of being of the five skandhas and, in particular, of the fo ur name skandhas. Through the training in the knowledge of the path, one understands how the path to be culti­vated is. Through the training in the knowledge of all aspects, one understands that those who have gained mastery over the knowledge of all aspects in their mind streams perform the deeds listed above. According to MPZL (pp. 124-25), the sixteen defining characteristics of knowl­edge of the knowledge of all aspects consist of the manners of knowing the knowledge of all aspects (a) in general, (b) in particular, and (c) specifically. (a) consists of knowing that (1) the mighty sages, who teach the final fruition (the basic nature of all aspects), abide in the equality of the dharmakaya through relying on their possession of the dharma that they manifested on their own-ultimate relinquishment and realization. (b) consists of the manners of knowing the distinctive features of (a) the miraculous powers of the bodies of buddhas, (b) the expres­sions of their minds, and (c) teaching through their speech. (ba) consists of (2)-(6), which are distinctive features of the dharmakaya demonstrating the welfare of others. (bb) consists of (7) engaging and knowing all phenomena in terms of suchness and variety without attachment and obstruction through the power of ultimate relinquishment and realization. (be) consists of (8) the buddhas first teaching the dharma wheel of the fo ur realities (the profound actuality that is not seen by worldly beings) and {9) in the middle, letting the dharma wheel of the lack of characteristics appear (the nature of the world of the five skandhas being emptiness). As for how they do this, (10) for those beings who wish to listen through hearing, they proclaim said dharma wheels through gathering these beings as their retinues. (11) As for those who wish for prajiia through reflecting, they make them know the teachings in the manner of maturing their mind streams. (12). As for those who wish fo r realization through meditating, they make them directly realize the teachings in the manner of liberating their mind streams. (13) In the end, they let the dharma wheel of excellently discriminating the inconceivable nature of phenom­ena appear. (14) In this context, they show that all phenomena have the nature of the peace of natural nirvat}a. (c) consists of the basic nature of all aspects-(15) the svabhavikakaya (the nirvat}a in which the contaminated world of the five skandhas has ceased) and (16) the wisdom dharmakaya (the realization that all discriminations of what is to be adopted and to be rejected with regard to saqtsara and nirvar;la have ceased and are at peace). According to SZB (p. 323), ( 1) is the general teaching that, through knowing the buddhadharmas (such as the powers) as the abode of not abiding in saqtsara or nirvat}a, one knows the manner of attaining the dharmakaya (one's own welfare). Then, one knows (2)-(5) the greatness of the bearers of this nature, (6)"},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"836 Groundless Paths that (2)-(5) lack an agent ultimately, (7) the manner of knowing knowable objects through the power of the knowledge of all aspects in which appearance and emptiness are inseparable, (8)-(13) entities (the two realities), (14) the path (the nature of peace), and (15)-(16) the frui­tion-the cessation of the five skandhas and the cessation of discriminations of clinging to saqtsira and nirv8J)a (the display of the nonabiding nirv8J)a). 957 Similar to PBG, MCG (fol. 102b.1-5) explains that the defining characteristic of knowl­edge of the knowledge of all aspects represents an exclusion of nonpossession, but not an exclusion of possession by others. Therefore, through explaining the defining characteristic of the distinctiveness of the knowledge of the path, its fruition-the knowledge of all aspects-is understood by implication and it is also implied that the remedial knowledge of entities is more eminent than that of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. 958 PGBG (p. 357) explains (15) as being held by mentors who are mahayana spiritual frineds. MCG (fols. 103a.4-104b.6) explains that (1) the instances of the reality of suffering (form and so on) are inconceivable because they are ultimately invisible like space, are the causes of the four buddha wisdoms, and are beyond the sphere of dialecticians. (2) This inconceivable nature is incomparable to any examples. (5) is what is to be known by wise bodhisattvas, who possess the subtle and astute intelligence of knowing the ultimate (suchness) and the seeming (variety). (8) means to manifest enlightenment through swiftly knowing how to realize true actuality as it is by virtue of not being separate from the prajiiaparamita that abides as the mahayana type of realization. (9) is the knowledge that all phenomena, from the perspective of seeming real­ity, lack any decline in terms of flaws ceasing or lack any denial and, from the perspective of ultimate reality, lack any increase through qualities or lack any superimpositions. (10) What accomplishes nirv8J)a is the path of the inseparable union of special prajiia and means (just as a mother cow and her calf), such as generosity pure of the three spheres. (11) The two unmistaken accumulations are completely accomplished through having practiced for many eons through the power of not being separate from the prajiiaparamita of not abiding in the two extremes. (12) By way of focusing on the suchness of all phenomena in a nonconceptual manner, it is seized through the effort of not abandoning prajiiaparamita (just like holding on to a plank when one's ship has been destroyed on the ocean). (13) Only bodhisattvas who focus on unsur­passable enlightenment-the nature of the dharmadhatu-through the superior intention are endowed with the foundation of practice (just like a day vase being fired in a kiln and thus holding water). (14) is illustrated by the example of entering the ocean in a ship whose leaks have been repaired. (15) also includes the outer mentors, mahayana spiritual friends. To not fall away from the path depends on both inner and outer mentors (just like an old and feeble person of 120 years relying on a powerful person). Under (16), MCG speaks of \"relishing in terms of taking the path as paramount and clinging to it.\" According to MPZL (pp. 126-28), (11) refers to completely accomplishing the fruition of great enlightenment through having accomplished the two accumulations; (12), to focusing on all phenomena in a nonconceptual manner; (13), to the distinctive feature of the foundation being the nature of the dharmadhatu; (14), to the completeness of all aspects of the path; (15), to being held by inner and outer mentors; and (16), to not relishing clinging to the path. The former Indian masters came up with various manners of explaining this defining characteristic of distinctiveness, such as asserting that these sixteen define the trainings in all three knowledges or asserting that, in general, the knowledge of enti­ties lacks the defining characteristic of distinctiveness (with the intention that the knowledge of entities that represents the types of realization of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lacks said defining characteristic). However, what appears to be the essential point here is found in the assertion that, actually, this is the defining characteristic of the distinctiveness of the mahayana's complete training in all aspects in general. 959 Skt. gati (the Tibetan has rten-\"support\")."},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"Notes 837 960 Under (2), MCG (fols. 105a.1-106a.1) replaces \"finally, they establish them in nirvil).a\" by \"establish them temporarily in the higher realms in later lives.\" (3) Through establishing beings in the nirvil).a without remainder, they protect them from all suffering in a lasting man­ner.

(8) They lead beings to the dry shore of the two welfares being accomplished temporarily and ultimately. (9) Through being without reference points, they accomplish the welfare of others spontaneously without effort. ( 11) Though having attained the wisdom kaya of the knowledge of all aspects, this kaya acts as the resource for bestowing all temporary and ultimate welfares of all sentient beings in all direc­tions and times without exception in accordance with their wishes. That is, while never wavering from seeing that all phenomena have the nature of being fully awakened in that they do not go beyond the natural state of the knowledge of all aspects, they effortlessly engage in the enlight­ened activity that is permanent throughout all times and pervades all directions. Through this, temporarily, they establish beings in the support of the path and the path itself, and, ultimately, in the great enlightenment of the nonabiding nirv�a. According to MPZL (pp. 128-29), the three activities of the training in familiarizing with the identitylessness of entities are to establish beings in (1) nirv�a-the benefit of no more rebirths in the future, (2) pratyekabuddhahood­the happiness of suffering being at peace in this life, and (3) great enlightenment-the ultimate protection from all suffering of saJp.siira and nirvil).a. Among the seven activities of the train­ing in the knowledge of the path, (a) the four activities of prajfiii consist of its two activities of relinquishment-(4)-(5) acting as a refuge and a place of rest through relinquishing suffering (the result) and its cause, respectively-and its two activities of realization-(6)-(7) acting as an aid and an island through respectively realizing saJp.siira and nirvil).a as equality and realizing the welfares of oneself and others. (b) The three activities of means consist of, (8) through the power of compassion, generally guiding those to be guided (9) in the manner of effortlessly and spontaneously accomplishing the welfare of others (10) without manifesting the fruitions of the three yiinas for one's own welfare.

MCG (fols. 106b.1-107a.6) explains that (5) it is seemingly hard to don the armor for liberating all sentient beings despite sentient beings being unobservable ultimately. (10) The training in the knowledge of all aspects focuses on the suchness of the three knowledges. (11) It is antagonistic to everything worldly by virtue of having relinquished clinging to entities and nonentities. (12) Due to see­ing the suchness of all phenomena, wisdom sees the entire variety of knowable objects without obstruction, which is the ultimate wisdom of realizing the inseparability of the two realities. (13) There is no ground or basis for realizing the knowledge of all aspects as having the nature of apprehender or apprehended. (14) There is no going higher and higher to the fruition by virtue of the nature of suchness. (15) Since there are no causes, there is no arising by virtue of any nature of its own. According to MPZL (pp. 129-30), as for the distinctive fe atures of means in terms of the nature of the training in the knowledge of the path, (5) means that this training is hard to do because of having given rise to the motivation of bodhicitta, ( 6)-(7) are as"},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"838 Groundless Paths explained in PBG and represent the application of that motivation and its fruition, respectively. The distinctive features of prajiiii consist of (8) as in PBG and (9) refraining from clinging to the aspects of meditation, with meditation being the object and the aspects, the subject, respectively. The sevenfold nature of the training in the knowledge of all aspects consists of its focus (a) in general and (b) in particular. (a) consists of (10) focusing on all aspects of the knowledge of all aspects (the fruition), (11) focusing on the qualities that are antagonistic to all worldly phe­nomena (its distinctive feature), and (12) focusing on the wisdom that engages in all knowable objects without obstruction (its nature). (b) consists of respectively focusing on the aspects that approximately accord with (13) the knowledge of entities (seeing that the qualities of conven­tional appearances are without a basis-a selO, (14) the knowledge of the path (knowing that the path is without going), and (15) the knowledge of all aspects (knowing that aspects are without arising). (16) refers to focusing on all of these as the ultimate unborn nature of suchness, which is unobservable. 964 PBG's gloss of this term follows the Tibetan version of Aryavimuktisena's Vrtti (03787, fol. 145a.5), being based on the Tibetan thar pa cha mthun (\"concordant with a part of libera­tion\") for the Sanskrit mo�abhagiya (lit. \"belonging or connected to liberation\"). PGBG (pp. 358-59) says that the clear realization of beginner bodhisattvas, who are skilled in the means to fully accomplish the realization of the basic nature of signlessness and the arising of the qualities of generosity up through the knowledge of all aspects, is asserted to represent the fac­tors conducive to liberation that are taught in this chapter of the training in clearly realizing all aspects because it is the clear realization of the dharma of prajiiii and means being in union. MCG (fol. 108a.2-3) adds to PBG that the piiramitiis and the knowledge of all aspects are the phenomena of the path and the fruition that are respectively accomplished in direct and indirect manners. According to MPZL (p. 131), the factors conducive to liberation here consist of the special prajiiii and means of being skilled in the characteristics of fully accomplishing all aspects of prajiiiipiiramitii (as explained above) through the prajiiii that is specified by signlessness and the means that are specified by generosity and so on. 965 PGBG (p. 359) speaks of (3) the mindfulness of the consummate intention of generat­ing bodhicitta and so on, (4) the samiidhi that is nonconceptual in terms of the three spheres, and (5) the prajiiii of knowing the general and specific characteristics of phenomena in all their aspects. MCG (fol. 108b.5-6) explains (3) \"the mindfulness of the consummate intention\" as focusing, in the manner of not clinging to it as being really existent, on the knowledge of all aspects that is induced by the generation of bodhicitta which knows that the welfare of others and enlightenment are not observable. According to MPZL (pp. 131-32), the three distinctive features of means are (1) the confidence of focusing on the three jewels (the supports), (2) the vigor whose sphere are the six piiramitiis (the application), and (3) the consummate intention­the mindfulness of the aspects of prajiiiipiiramitii (the nature). The two distinctive features of prajiiii are (4) nonconceptual samiidhis such as \"the sky treasure\" (calm abiding) and (5) the prajiiii of knowing the phenomena of entities and the path in all their aspects (superior insight). These represent the five purified faculties of the path of accumulation whose nature consists of special prajiiii and means, but they are not identical to the five faculties of the path of prepara­tion because they are not yet specified by having the four realities of the noble ones as their focal objects. 966 According to SZB (p. 326), within the mahayana, those of duller and sharp faculties are those to be guided by *Sviitantrikas and *Priisailgikas, respectively, which represent the approaches of gradualists versus simultaneists. 967 According to SZB (pp. 326-27), the reason for not explaining the practices during sub­sequent attainment in the first chapters, while teaching them here, is to easily understand the boundary lines of progressively cultivating the complete training in all aspects from the path of"},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"Notes 839 accumulation onward. However, if one were to teach this by virtue of the signs of meditative equipoise, one would just repeat what is said in the first chapters. On the other hand, to rebut the flaw of repetition through distinguishing the paths in the earlier chapters and in this one in terms of being fully qualified and nominal, respectively, is a sign of not understanding the above essential point. 968 Both MCG and MPZL have \"through the body.\" 969 According to PGBG (p. 360), the aspect of medium poised readiness is to familiarize with the knowledge about the fruition of a stream-enterer in order to manifest this knowledge. MCG (fols. 109a.6-ll0b.1) says that, in the chapter of the knowledge of all aspects, the focal objects of the realizations during meditative equipoise are characterized by emptiness, while here they consist of all sentient beings as the objects of compassion. Thus, as the outcome of having familiarized with emptiness during meditative equipoise, the power of compassion and one's engagement in the welfare of others increase during subsequent attainment. Under the aspects of great peak, \"making others conform\" is alternatively glossed as \"making them con­form through giving the dharma and material goods.\" The aspect of medium poised readiness is to abide in knowing the manners of accomplishing the fruitions such as stream-enterers, but not manifesting them. MPZL (p. 134) describes the aspect of the medium supreme dharma as \"abiding in oneself producing the cognitions of the clear realization of bodhisattvas.\" 970 PGBG (p. 361) says that bodhisattvas with sharp faculties attain the signs of irreversibility on the path of preparation; those with medium faculties, on the path of seeing; and those with duller faculties, on the path of familiarization. 971 The Tibetan has \"sentient beings\" instead of \"world.\" 972 Under (8), PGBG (pp. 363-64) further glosses sleep and dullness as the obstructions of calm abiding; agitation and regret as the obstructions of superior insight; and doubt as the obstruction of equanimity. (10) Bodhisattvas are endowed with mindfulness and alertness dur­ing all forms of conduct by virtue of always resting with an undistracted mind in meditative equipoise in the points to be adopted and to be rejected. (11) They are pure because there is nothing to be disrespected by others in their conduct in terms of dharma robes, bedding, and so on. (13) Their minds are without crookedness, such as mentally engaging in the levels of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, because they attained the root of virtue that consists of the pure mind of the mahayana. (16) They proceed to enlightenment through not being in contradiction with the nature of phenomena and being endowed with prajftaparamita because all phenomena are perfectly included in emptiness. (17) They even wish and search for the hell realms for the welfare of all sentient beings because, out of compassion, they take all beings as their own chil­dren. Under (19), fake paths are glossed as \"paths that contradict the six paramitas,\" while the piramitas are the means to attain buddhahood. Through these signs, bodhisattvas with sharp faculties on the path of preparation are shown to be irreversible from perfect enlightenment. MCG (fols. ll2b.3-ll4b.3) explains that, (1) by virtue of turning away from the manifest cling­ing to form up through the knowledge of all aspects as being really existent, these bodhisattvas are free from discriminating notions in terms of difference. They know that such a profound dharma exists in their own mind streams due to their speaking reasonable words without con­tradicting the profound nature of phenomena. Because of (2) as explained in PBG, except for the teachings of the Buddha, they do not rely on any other sramaJ.las or brahmans as refuges who teach the path. An additional reason for (3) is that they have relinquished manifest nonvirtues as the causes for rebirth in the lower realms. (5) Through exchanging themselves with others, they engage in generosity and so on for the welfare of others (such as teaching the dharma without concern for material goods) and dedicate this to enlightenment. (6) Because of not having doubts about the profound nature of phenomena free from reference points, they solely delight in the dharma. (10) That they are endowed with mindfulness and alertness throughout"},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"840 Groundless Paths all conduct is pointed out by their walking without looking any farther than the length of a yoke, their minds being without mistakenness, and so on. To (20) as explained by PBG, MCG adds\" ... and thus accomplishing the two welfares without even a speck of impurity.\" According to MPZL (pp. 136-37), (2) they have no doubt about the path by virtue of their inf ormed confidence. (13) Because of their roots of virtue, they are without crookedness toward sentient beings. (16) They proceed by being endowed with the nature of phenomena by virtue of perfectly collecting the dharma. 973 Here, like most Tibetan commentaries, PBG has \"kings,\" but the siitras speak of \"prime ministers.\" 974 PBG has rjes su mthun pas 'bras bu, but LSSP has rjes su mthun pa'i 'bras bu. 975 Under (3), PGBG (pp. 365-66) glosses \"practicing the special mahayana\" by \"as the union of prajfia and means.\" Under (6), \"sentient beings\" are glossed as \"those with attachment.\" (7) The reason for constantly pure conduct is seeing that all suffering in this and future lifetimes arises from the shortcomings of objects and so on. (10) The reason for not clinging to obstacles is that the antagonistic factors of the path of seeing have been eliminated. (11) The reason for not clinging to the accumulation of the causes of enlightenment is to know the flaws of concep­tions. (12) The reason for not clinging to names, that is, not clinging to the battle of the faculties and so on, is that apprehender and apprehended are the factors to be relinquished. (13) The reason for not clinging to greed and so on is the realization of the special piramitas. (14) refers to not the least permanent phenomenon (such as the dhannas concordant with enlightenment) being observable. (15) Through the certainty about the three knowledges, just as they are, one dwells on the triple bhiimi that oneself has attained because one has attained the kind of trust in one's own realization that cannot be taken away by others. (16) One renounces one's life for the dharma that is the cause of the knowledge of all aspects because one is absolutely immersed in it for the sake of the knowledge of all aspects. Under (5), MCG (fols. 115b.6-117b.6) glosses \"light­ness of mind\" as \"not being ensnared by anger and so on.\" (6) By virtue of not being attached to any phenomena, even if one is a householder, one is skilled in the means of being without clinging, even if one uses sense pleasures, and of guiding sentient beings through whatever means. (7) By virtue of seeing the shortcomings of households and the flaws of clinging to the pleasures of objects, one does not meet with women, nor engage in wrathful mantra practices. (10)-(12) are respectively related with the siitras' \"talk about robbers,\" \"talk about war,\" and \"talk about battle, villages, cities, market towns, themselves, and prime ministers and ministers.\" Here these are referred to as \"talk\" in order to indicate not clinging to what is only established as a name, but not as a referent. Through the essential point of nonclinging, the desire for what is explicitly taught in the siitras (villages and so on) and what is pointed to (the faculties and so on) vanishes. Therefore, I think that this implicitly also teaches such things as not talking about these topics repeatedly and not engaging for their sake physically. For talk follows what one has in mind and thus is a sign that points to certain internal aspects. To (13), MCG adds that the signs of nonobservation are to not harm others through wrathful mantras and so on. (14) By virtue of knowing that all phenomena are not established as any nature of the three doors to liberation whatsoever and thus observing not the least phenomenon of realization (the path and the fruition) to be realized, one always makes efforts in familiarizing with prajftapiramita. (15) Through having gained the certainty of trusting the irreversibility of the three knowledges (one's own level), one dwells on the triple bhiimi of entities, path, and aspects without being separated from it by maras. (16) By virtue of absolutely merging into the knowledge of all aspects and real­izing it as being empty through the firm generation of bodhicitta, one renounces one's life for the sake of such as listening to and explaining the dharma that teaches the knowledge of all aspects and so on. Though the large, medium, and brief prajiiaparamita siitras differ in their sixteen signs of irreversibility on the path of seeing, their meanings are similar. According to MPZL (pp. 138-40), the reason for (3) is to have realized the greatness of the mahayana. The reason"},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"Notes 841 for (5) is to be free from nonvirtue. (6) The reason for being skilled in the means for using sense pleasures is to be skilled in the means for taming the mind. The reason for (10) is to not conceive of antagonistic factors. ( 11) The reason for not clinging to the sense objects and so on is to not cling to them as apprehender and apprehended. As for (10-(12), the hidden meanings of the siitras speaking of \"talk about robbers,\" \"talk about war,\" and \"talk about battle\" consist of not talking in a clinging way about the obstacles to be relinquished, their remedies (the accumula­tions), and the battle between the factors to be relinquished and their remedies. The same applies for talk about villages and so on referring to the sense faculties and so on as above. The reason for (13) is to realize the distinctive fe atures of generosity and so on. (14) The realization of the nature that is endowed with the three doors to liberation is not observed as the least remedial phenomenon. The reason for (16) is that, ultimately, there is definitely only a single yana. All of these are resultant signs (or result reasons) during subsequent attainment of the respective particular wisdom moments during the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing. Thus, they are taught through labeling the results with the names of the causes. 976 MCG (fol. 118a.3-6) explains that emptiness is the profound locus that perfects all bud­dha qualities through bodhisattvas abiding in it. In this sense, the path of familiarization is profound in that its ground or basis cannot be found in the manner of observing its distinctive features. There are no signs, wishes, or formations that are generated by the mind that focuses on profound emptiness. The cognizing subject that depends on emptiness as its object is with­out arising and so on (the remaining six terms listed in PBG). According to MPZL (p. 140), bodhisattvas on the path of familiarization are established as irreversible due to the following sign. They realize the profound basic nature in a manner that is free from superimposition and denial. That is, the cognizing subject that is the wisdom of the meditative equipoise of the path of familiarization realizes the profound basic nature of the object (the nature of profound emp­tiness and so on) as being liberated from the extremes of superimposing existence onto it and denying it by taking it to be nonexistent. Through these particular features of realization, during subsequent attainment these bodhisattvas are able to explain the profound basic nature to others in a manner that is free from superimposition and denial. 977 MCG (fols. 118b.6-119a.2) explains that \"reflections,\" verifications,\" and \"absorptions,\" apart from respectively referring to the paths of preparation, seeing, and familiarization, can also be matched with the prajiias arising from studying, reflecting, and meditating or from the preparation, main phase, and conclusion of samiidhi. In terms of the manner of focusing, they can also refer to repeated reflections through the four reasonings, repeated verifications through the nine mental states of calm abiding, and repeated absorptions through the four kinds of superior insight. On the path of preparation, emptiness is realized in the manner of an object generality; on the path of seeing, one knows its nature; and on the path of familiarization, one is able to know what one has realized already to be more and more profound. 978 According to MPZL (p. 141), the factors to be relinquished on the path of familiarization are the innate conceptions. 979 The Tibetan omits \"true\" (Skt. bhutatJ). 980 PGBG (p. 368) says that the descriptions of each part of the path of familiarization generating merits that are countless and so on do not hold out in terms of the ultimate because, ultimately, in the defining characteristic of emptiness, there is no difference even by way of expressions. In terms of the seeming, the merits that are countless and so on represent the fruitions of the path of familiarization because the sage whose nature is great nonreferential compassion asserted them to be the fruitions that are the natural outflows of having familiarized with the dharmadhiitu through the path of familiarization. MCG (fols. ll9b.2-120b.3) presents the objection here as follows. \"If the siitras explain the results of the path of familiarization to be merits that are countless and so on, their causes (the stages of the path of familiarization) cannot"},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"842 Groundless Paths be ninefold because the qualities of these results arise from the realizations of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished, which are equally countless. Also, if there are countless results, their causes must also be countless.\" The teachings on merits that are countless are not divisions in terms of quantitative numbers such that countless results that are really established ultimately arise from a single cause that is really established ultimately. Since both causes and results are not established ultimately, they do not exist in any greater or lesser numbers. Of course, it is realized here that if there were really established causes and results, the arising of limitless results from limited causes is not justifiable. However, this is not what is asserted here. Rather, merely on the level of the seeming, each part of the path of familiarization results in merits that are countless and so on, which the Buddha asserts to be the natural outflows of compassion. This is not a teaching with an underlying intention, but the Buddha teaches such due to having seen that it is actually the case ultimately. Here the mere arising of many results from a single cause is established by facts such as many fruits arising again and again from a single seed. On the level of the seeming, the merit of familiarization in the fo llowing manner is also established through reasoning as being limitless. It is the merit of familiarization that operates by way of fo cusing on countless sentient beings and dedicating it, for their sake, as the cause of buddhahood with its countless qualities, all of which is embraced by the skill in means of not clinging to it and is of the nature of the dharmadhatu in which the two realities are of one taste. According to MPZL (p. 142), the dispute in terms of superimposing existence ultimately says, \"It fo llows that the aspects of the path of familiarization are not definitely nine in number because the siitras teach that their results exist as merits that are countless, immeasurable, and infinite.\" The answer of saying that said teachings do not hold out in terms of the ultimate means that the subject property in this objection is not established. It also shows the skill in explaining this in a man­ner of being free from superimpositions. The dispute in terms of denying existence on the level of the seeming says, \"It follows that these results-the merits that are countless, immeasurable, and infinite-do not even exist conventionally because their causes are definitely nine in num­ber.\" The answer to this is that, on the level of the seeming, said results, which are the natural outflows of the causes that consist of the special means of nonreferential compassion and the special prajiii of realizing the nature of phenomena (the nature of the path of familiarization), are actually countless and so on in these ways. This is realized by the Buddha who possesses the power of knowing the very hidden object that consists of all karmic actions and their matura­tions and then asserts it in this way in the siitras of definitive meaning. This answer means to refute the positive entailment in the above objection and shows the skill in explaining this in a manner that is free from denying the conventional existence of said countless results. 981 The Tibetan simply has \"path\" (lam), while the Sanskrit is vartmana. 982 PGBG (p. 368) says, \"It fo llows that the path of familiarization cannot perform the functions of decreasing the factors to be relinquished and increasing the remedies because this path-the entity whose nature is the nature of phenomena-is not expressible as factors to be relinquished and remedies, nor is there any familiarization to be perfected on it.\" MCG's fo rmu­lation of this dispute (fol. 120b.6) is similar to PBG's, but starts with \"If entities are inexpressible emptiness, decrease of factors to be relinquished ... \" According to MPZL (pp. 142-43), this is a dispute in terms of denying that relinquishment and attainment are tenable in the phenom­enon that is the realization of the ultimate, saying, \"In general, in the nature of the ultimate that is inexpressible as any one of the entities of the fo ur extremes, presentations of decrease and increase are not tenable. Therefore, through the progression called \"familiarization,\" which has this very nature, what antagonistic fa ctors to be relinquished could decrease and what puri­fied remedies could be obtained?\" This is reformulated as a two-branched proof statement: \"In whatever is inexpressible as an entity, decrease of factors to be relinquished and increase of remedies are necessarily not tenable. Just as in the case of a sky flower, this mahayana path of familiarization is also inexpressible.\""},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"Notes 843 983 MCG (fol. 12la.l-121 b.6) says that the enlightenment of knowing termination and non­arising is merely characterized by the obscurations being terminated and not arising any more, but it does not exist as an entity. However, by way of being absolutely free from all S8lll siric suffering after having attained this fruition, it is capable of protecting those who strive fo r liberation too. Likewise, by way of relinquishing the factors to be relinquished and attaining the realizations, the path of familiarization also accomplishes the desired goals of both one­self and others. For it is asserted that both this enlightenment and the path of familiarization have the defining characteristic of empty suchness. Thus, this is the answer to the dispute by realists saying that it is pointless. However, some phrase the answer to that dispute by saying, \"Just as the nature of the uncontaminated wisdom of unsurpassable enlightenment is beyond decrease and increase ultimately, but promotes the welfare of those to be guided conventionally, so does the path of familiarization.\" Since realists do not accept the example of unsurpass­able enlightenment being without decrease and increase ultimately, said answer seems to be not so good. Therefore, Niigarjuna says, \"In the sense of termination and nonarising, they are the same. Thus, give rise to poised readiness!\" Accordingly, for the realists who do not know how to present cause and result as well as relinquishment and attainment as soon as something is emptiness, it is better to take their own ultimate fruition-the enlightenment that has the nature of an analytical cessation-as an example. Whether this is considered to be empty by virtue of something previously existing having been terminated or to be empty by nature, it is the same in meaning in that it is empty. Therefore, in its essential point, I think this accords with saying, \"Don't be afraid of the relinquishment of the mahayana, but give rise to poised readiness for it.\" Thus, what appears as S8llls8ra does not appear by virtue of being established ultimately, but by virtue of one's own imagination. Once sarpsara has been relinquished, its having been put to an end is also nothing but a thought. Consequently, that there are the progressive relinquishment of said imagination and the obscurations that arise under its influence as well as the progressive attainment of the wisdoms of realization by virtue of the wisdom of focusing on the equality free from decrease, increase, adopting, and rejecting is not so from the perspective of suchness, but it appears in this way due to the manner in which one's own conceptions of straying from suchness are terminated. Therefore, one should understand that the seeing of the equality of the nature of phenomena, just as it is, represents the buddhahood that is the nirviit].a of not abiding in either S8lllS8ra or nirviit).a. MPZL (p. 143) agrees with MCG's answer and says that this means to deny the entailment in the above dispute and represents the skill in means to explain this in a way of being free from denying that the path of familiarization performs the functions of relinquishing and attaining. 984 PGBG (pp. 368-69) says, \"It follows that, on the level of the seeming, the generations of bodhicitta of the path of familiarization of bodhisattvas are not what make them attain their desired goal of enlightenment because enlightenment is produced neither through an earlier nor a later moment and because it is impossible for many earlier and later moments to come together.\" According to MCG (fol. 122a.l-4), those who take the two realities to be contradictory say, \"If it is like this ultimately, then the path of familiarization does not perform any function on the level of the seeming either. Mind has the property of arising and ceasing moment by moment. Since all of its moments cannot arise simultaneously in a single moment, they must arise sequentially. However, in that case, it is not reasonable to attain enlightenment through the first moment of mind (both ultimately and seemingly), nor can it be attained through solely a later moment that is not preceded by earlier ones. For each individual earlier or later moment lacks the complete capacity for attaining enlightenment and the earlier moments have ceased and thus do not exist at the time of the later ones.\" 985 PGBG (p. 369) explains IV.58cd together, saying that the explanation of unsurpass­able enlightenment being attained through the series of mutually dependent earlier and later moments of the mahayana path of familiarization (just as a wick is burned in the same way"},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"844 Groundless Paths through a flame) is taught for the purpose of understanding the eightfold profundity of the nature of phenomena, including its objects, as being the sign of irreversibility on the path of familiarization. MPZL (pp. 143-44) explains IV.58 as a whole, saying that this is the dispute about great enlightenment not being attained through a seeming momentary phenomenon because its earlier moments do not exist later and its later moments do not exist earlier, nor can they come together at the same time. Therefore, enlightenment is not attained through the path of familiarization, which is of the nature of seeming reality, that is, neither through its first moment nor a later moment alone that is not preceded by former ones. The answer is that the example of a wick being burned completely as a mere process of dependent origination justifies that enlightenment is attained by the path of familiarization despite its being a seeming momentary phenomenon. Again, this is an answer that denies the entailment in said dispute and represents the skill in means to explain this in a way of being free from denying that enlighten­ment is attained through the path of familiarization. Thus, the eight signs that establish the irreversibility of those on the path of familiarization consist of the eightfold skill in the means to explain the eightfold profundity of the nature of phenomena without superimposition and denial during subsequent attainment. 986 PBG has rang rgyud Ia (\"in their own continuum\"), but this is emended here according to LSSP's rang rgyu las. 987 MCG (fols. 122b.2-124a.4) says that (1) is the special unified realization that ultimate nonarising and conventional arising by virtue of undeceiving dependent origination are not contradictory-not just as an object of understanding. but as seeing that they actually are equal and do not have to be mutually exclusive in a single basis. (2) is the realization that the two realities are inseparable and of one taste because it is not contradictory that entities cease by not abiding for a second moment after their arising and do not cease ultimately due to lacking any nature of their own. These two profundities are presented in terms of the manner of realizing entities. (5) Since all phenomena are not established by any nature of their own, ultimately there is not even the least to be seen through observing entities, nonentities, and so on, which means \"to see true reality.\" Other than it being taught that not seeing is the genuine seeing, one is free from conceptions about there being no seeing whatsoever and seeing true reality being con­tradictory. This is the self-illuminating wisdom free from all reference points. (6) is the special realization of the teaching on genuine nonengagement by virtue of there being no engagement in any phenomena whatsoever ultimately. (7) is the realization of abiding in the nature of phe­nomena that is primordially equal, with what is to be accomplished and what accomplishes not being dual in the basic nature, though the fruition is manifested through not rejecting the accomplishment of the entire path. These five profundities are presented in terms of the man­ner of practicing engagement. They are phrased in terms of the ground (knowing that, though suchness exists in everything without any difference, one does not manifest it through complet­ing the triad of completion, maturation, and purification during the untimely period of not yet being free from the two obscurations), the path (what is to be cognized, cognition, and engage­ment in practicing the path), and the fruition (seeing that what is to be accomplished and what accomplishes are not dual). (8) refers to conventionally completing the two accumulations, but not being conceited about attaining their fruition-buddhahood. For one sees that, in actual fact, anything to be attained is unobservable and what is self-arisen or the unconditioned kiya of self-arisen wisdom cannot be accomplished through causes. From the perspective of those who cling to emptiness and dependent origination being contradictory in that they mutually eliminate each other, it is difficult to realize that they are equal and of one taste, while the wis­dom that is endowed with these eight profundities of realizing them to be equal is attained on the eighth bhlimi. The texts say that the conventionalities of body and speech that accord with these profundities serve as the signs of irreversibility from the perspective of others. Obviously, they do not only serve as such signs from the perspective of others, but also exist as one's own"},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"Notes 845 trust. In general, these eight profundities share the same essential point of realizing the great equal taste of appearance and emptiness. According to MPZL (pp. 144-45) these eight represent the distinctive fe atures of the manners of knowing entities (1)-(3), the path (4)-(6), and all aspects (7)-(8). In particular, (4) means that, though the path to be cognized (such as generos­ity) does not exist ultimately, it appears as what is to be cognized conventionally. (5) Though, ultimately, the path cannot be seen as the mode of being of nonarising, conventionally, seeing it is unceasing. ( 6) Though, ultimately, there is no engaging in any of all the engagements in the path, conventionally one engages in them. (7) Though, ultimately, nondual wisdom (what is to be accomplished) is not anything to be accomplished, conventionally one does not reject the manner of accomplishing it. (8) The fruition of having completed the accumulations neither abides in the extreme of s;upsara nor in the extreme of nirvaJ)a. 988 PGBG (p. 369) says that the wisdom of the eighth bhO.mi is the training in not concep­tualizing sa!psaric existence and peace as different in terms of what is to be rejected and to be adopted because it is the wisdom of the pure realization that all phenomena of sa!psara and nirvaJ)a are like dreams-appearing, but not really existing. MCG (fol. 124b.1) agrees with this being the training in the equality of saJpsara and nirvaJ)a because all phenomena do not show the slightest difference, but have the same mode of being in being the dhatu of the inexpressible equality of appearance and emptiness. Ultimately, in this equality, any arising, ceasing, increase, decrease, afflicted phenomena, or purified phenomena do not exist. However, for those persons who are entirely fe ttered by not realizing this, under the sway of their own conceptions, arising, ceasing, afflicted phenomena, purified phenomena, bondage, and liberation do exist. Therefore, the accumulating of virtuous and nonvirtuous karma as well as their respective results exist for them. According to MPZL (p. 146), said training in the equality of s;upsara and nirva!J.a is the special accumulation of the wisdom of realizing said equality. In terms of what this training is primarily, through its mastery over nonconceptuality, it is the distinctive fe ature of the profound nonconceptual wisdom that is the cause of the result that consists of the dharmakaya-equality. 989 The Tibetan has \"answers\" (lan). 990 See CZ, p. 415 and endnote 625. 991 MCG (fol. 126a.1-4) adds that bodhisattvas both make aspiration prayers to accom­plish such pure realms and gather the accumulations to actually accomplish them. Here Abhayakaragupta says that Haribhadra's presentation of the two trainings in equality and puri­fying realms as being special paths is not justified because Aryavimuk.tisena describes them as the level of nonlearning. However, Aryavimuk.tisena says this with having in mind the frui­tionallevel of these two training or that there is nothing to be learned beyond these two. Thus, Haribhadra is correct. According to MPZL (p. 148), the training in purifying buddha realms is the distinctive fe ature of the accumulation of vast merit, which is the cause that, through the mastery over pure realms, accomplishes the result that consists of the ro.pakayas and pure realms. In these pure realms sentient beings are irreversible bodhisattvas who possess the visions and supernatural knowledges and so on. 992 The Tibetan omits \"hordes of.\" 993 PGBG (p. 370) explains (2) as the skill in means of abiding in not abiding in the two extremes. (4) Though bodhisattvas are very much fa miliar with the hardships of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, they do not manifest the fruitions of these two and thus their own fruition is uncommon in comparison with sravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Through having familiarized with the three doors to liberation, in due order, bodhisattvas ( 6) do not observe any entities of a self and have terminated (7) the characteristics of reference points and (8) wishes for s;upsara. (9) As the sign of being irreversible, they express the dharma of irreversibility that makes oth­ers understand this. (10) They know all objects, such as the five fields of knowledge. MCG"},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"846 Groundless Paths (fols. 126a.6-127a.4) explains that this tenfold training refers to bodhisattvas being skilled in the means of (a) perfecting their own buddha qualities through the union of emptiness and compassion and (b) the manner of maturing other sentient beings not blocking each other, but becoming mutual aids. In detail, (2) they promote the welfare of sentient beings without abid­ing in the two extremes by virtue of taking the two realities as a unity. (5) They do not relish any qualities of the path or the fruition. (7) means not clinging to the characteristics of either sarpsara or nirviQa. Here one may think, \"In that case, nirviQa, which is a nonentity, would be manifested merely through not seeing anything whatsoever.\" This is not the case-bodhisat­tvas see all phenomena while not clinging to their characteristics, but to mentally manifest a nonentity represents nothing but clinging to the characteristics of a nonentity. (8) Bodhisattvas have terminated any hopes for a fruition through not abiding in either conditioned sarpsara or the nirviQa that is characterized as a mere nonentity. (9) Under the sway of their experiences, they are skilled in explaining the vast and profound uncommon dharma of profound emptiness, which is the sign of their irreversibility. Therefore, they are skilled in the means of explaining the signs of irreversibility. MPZL (pp. 148-49) divides this training into (a) the skill in means in terms of the object to be accomplished (the skill in means of spontaneously accomplishing the twofold welfare of the fruition that is the buddhabhiimi) and (b) the skill in means in terms of the training that accomplishes this (the skill in means of the special practices of the pure bhiimis). Under (a), the skill in means in terms of the dharmakaya as one's own welfare con­sists of (1) overcoming the enemies (the four maras) by virtue of having relinquished the two obscurations and their latent tendencies (the distinctive feature of relinquishment) and (2) not abiding in any extremes by virtue of realizing all phenomena as equality (the distinctive feature of what is to be realized). The skill in means in terms of the riipakayas as the welfare of others is (3) the spontaneous engagement of the riipakayas according to one's former aspiration prayers. (b) consists of its (a) nature, (b) distinctive features, and (c) function. (ba) consists of (4). (bb) consists of (5) not being attached by virtue of having relinquished the antagonistic factor that is the clinging to the three spheres (the distinctive feature of relinquishment), (6) not observing any nature because of having realized the true end as identitylessness (the distinctive feature of realization), (7) causes being signless because of having realized the path as lacking characteris­tics, and (8) results in being wishless because of having realized their wishlessness. (be) consists of (9) the temporary function-being skilled in explaining the signs of irreversibility to others because, from one's own perspective, the realization of the path has manifested and (10) the ultimate function-manifesting the unlimited skill in means of the knowledge of all aspects (the object) through completing the training in means (the cause). 994 This is an epithet of VajrapiQi. 995 MCG (fols. 127b.1-128a.4) says that (1)-(6) occur in dreams by virtue of being familiar with the calm abiding and superior insight of focusing on emptiness during the waking state. (5) While dreaming, there arises the mindset of teaching the dreamlike dharma to sentient beings who are overpowered by suffering. (6) refers to both the states of dreaming and waking. (9) refers to relying on spiritual friends through doing what is said under (9) in PBG. (10) One relies on prajfiaparamita in all aspects of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment by virtue of wishing to fulfill the hopes of those to be guided. (11) One does not cling to any purified phe­nomena by virtue of knowing the nature of form and so on. (12) One is close to enlightenment by virtue of engaging in the mother-the nature of phenomena without anything to be removed or to be added. According to MPZL (pp. 150-51), the six dream signs consist of (1) the sign of having accomplished the training in the path, (2) the sign of relinquishing adverse condi­tions (both described as in PBG), (3)-(5) the general, particular, and special signs of possessing favorable conditions (seeing buddhas, seeing their physical miraculous powers, and seeing their teaching the dharma through their verbal miraculous powers, respectively), and (6) the sign of the distinctive features of the fruition (as in PBG). The six signs of the waking state consist of"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"Notes 847 (7)-(8) the signs of having accomplished the power of the path and the four signs of having per­fected the distinctive features of the path-the distinctive features in terms of (9) the condition (relying on spiritual friends), (10) the remedy, (11) what is to be relinquished, and (12) the frui­tion (the latter three described as in PBG). These twelve are the signs that indicate the samiidhi of attaining the illumination of prajftii. 996 As PSD and LSSP say, this means not only that the gods approach these bodhisattvas, but also that the bodhisattvas go to all god realms in order to benefit them. 997 According to PGBG (p. 372), the comparison in (1) is the virtue of all beings in Jambudvipa worshipping all buddhas in the ten directions. MCG (fol. 129a.1-129b.6) explains that all of these sixteen arise by virtue of the power of loving-kindness and prajftii. The first eight are primarily external because they are pointed out in dependence on other examples and other persons. Due to (2)-(4), respectively, bodhisattvas on the level of peak serve as genuine objects of generosity, liberate beings, and seize the dharmas of enlightenment through deliber­ate efforts while not observing them. (9) The training of these bodhisattvas is pure by virtue of lacking the mental engagements of the formless realm, sriivakas, and pratyekabuddhas and by virtue of being skilled in means. (14) Said bodhisattvas know how to practice through includ­ing all piiramitiis in prajftiipiiramitii. (15) Through the power that arises from meditation, they attain all excellencies of the types of realization of the three yiinas. The above twelve signs and the sixteen kinds of increase of merit refer to the boundary lines of first attaining them, but this does not mean that they do not exist later too. They even exist in a partial manner before (such as during the training in purifying buddha realms), but their completely pure special forms are attained on the pure bhUmis. The same applies for the following levels of the path of preparation. MPZL (pp. 151-52) points out that the example under (1) in the slitras refers to worshipping all sentient beings in Jambudvipa who have become buddhas. The eight primarily external increases of merit consist of (a) their nature and (b) their benefit. (a) The nature is (1) general, (2) particular (mentally engaging in the profound yoga of prajftiipiiramitii in a proper manner), and special with regard to prajftiipiiramitii as (3) object and (4) subject (the efforts of not conceiving of profound prajftiipiiramitii in terms of the three spheres). (b) The benefit is also (5) general, (6)-(7) particular (being protected by bright gods and outshining dark miiras), and (8) special. The eight primarily internal ones are (a) general and (b) particular. (a) consists of (9) the training of these bodhisattvas being pure by virtue of the nature of their path being free from antagonistic factors. (b) consists of increase in terms of (a) causes, (b) nature, and (c) results. (ba) consists of (10)-(11) as cause and condition, respectively. (bb) consists of the increases in terms of relinquishment-the nonarising of (12) the afflictions (such as miserli­ness) that are the antagonistic factors of the piiramitiis and (13) the cognitive obscurations of conceiving of phenomena (such as form)-and the increase in terms of remedies-(14) the special realization that all piiramitiis are included in prajftiipiiramitii. (be) consists of (15) the temporary increase of attaining the path of seeing of the excellent types of realization of the three yiinas and (16) the ultimate increase of being close to perfect enlightenment. This is the sixteenfold increase that indicates the increase of the illumination of prajftii. 998 According to PGBG (p. 372), ( 1) the stability of realization as one's own welfare is to dedi­cate the thirty dharmas of the three omnisciences to unsurpassable perfect enlightenment, while (2) the stability of enlightened activity as the welfare of others is to not abandon the welfare of sentient beings out of the great compassion of wishing to eliminate the suffering of others. According to MPZL (p. 153), (1) and (2) are the stabilities of prajftii and means that define the samiidhi of poised readiness here. 999 MCG (fol. 130a.4) explains that the rejoicing on this level is supreme by virtue of having attained the special samiidhi of settling the mind. According to MPZL (p. 153), the samiidhi of"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"848 Groundless Paths the supreme dharma that is the direct and immediate cause of the path of seeing is endowed with the distinctive features of the accumulations of merit and wisdom being immeasurable. 1000 The Sanskrit of V.5-7 always has the dual case for \"conceptions,\" which is absent in the Tibetan of V.5. 1001 According to MPZL (pp. 153-54), the nature of these imputational conceptions about the apprehended is to apprehend the apprehended as phenomena to be adopted and to be rejected, respectively. They are a portion of the imputational factors to be relinquished through seeing because their character is that what they apprehend does not correspond to the natures of their objects as they are. 1002 PGBG (p. 373) says that these conceptions about the apprehender do not engage in the basic nature of their respective objects and thus are conceptions that cling to them in mistaken ways because they are deluded cognitions whose apprehended referents do not exist as suchness. Therefore, said conceptions have the characteristic of being empty of a nature of an undeluded apprehender because they have the nature of not apprehending their objects as they are. MCG (fol. 131b.4-5) explains that the conceptions about the apprehender resemble the cognition of mistaking a mirage for water. Thus, since no object or characteristic was ever substantially or imputedly established, said conceptions are like the child of a barren woman. According to MPZL (pp. 154-55), the nature of these imputational conceptions about the apprehender is to apprehend the apprehended as substantially or imputedly existent persons. They are divided by ordinary beings and noble ones (those who do not directly realize identitylessness and those who do, respectively). They represent a portion of the imputational factors to be relinquished through seeing because, in the basic nature, their apprehended referents are not established as they apprehend them. Thus, they are mere mistaken superimpositions. 1003 PBG mistakenly has Ia ltos pa'i srid mtha'i ched, but LSSP reads Ia ltos pas srid mtha'i tshe. 1004 Under the first nine conceptions about the apprehended, PGBG (p. 374) has (1) the nature of the path, (4) the unmistakenness about the focal object of being conscious about the path, ( 6) attaining one's own realization that consists of the three knowledges, (7) distancing oneself from the mental engagements of §ravakas and pratyekabuddhas, (8) performing the activity for the welfare of sentient beings, and (9) the fruitions (the nirvaJ].as of the three yanas) in which others are to be established. As for the second nine, their objects are (2) lacking spiritual friends who mentor one in the mahayana, (4) progressing by virtue of the condition of other masters, and (9) thinking that following bodhisattvas is flawed. As for the f;irst nine, MCG (fol. 132b.2-6) has ( 4) the focal object being unmistaken because of realizing that the focal object of being conscious about the way things are is illusionlike, ( 6) one's own realization of the knowl­edge of all aspects as the fruition of the mahayana (one's own welfare), (7) distancing those with the mahayana disposition from the levels of §ravakas and pratyekabuddhas (the welfare of others), (8) the activity of emanations who guide those to be guided promoting their welfare in accordance with their thinking. and (9) its result-establishing sentient beings in the great ni�a. According to MPZL (pp. 156-58), the first nine conceptions are about (a) the ground, (b) the path, and (c) the fruition of the mahayana. (a) consists of the distinctive features of (1) the empty essence (the nature of it being difficult to realize that all phenomena of ground, path, and fruition are ultimately void) and (2) the luminous nature (the mahayana disposition as the cause). (b) consists of (3) its nature (the mahayana paths of seeing and familiarization perfectly accomplishing great enlightenment) and its distinctive features-(4) the unmistaken­ness about the focal object because of realizing the focal object of the path-appearance and emptiness inseparable-as being like a reflection (the distinctive feature of the focal object) and (5) the distinctive features of the factors to be relinquished that are understood as flaws and their remedies that are understood as qualities. (c) consists of (6) the manner in which one mani­fests enlightenment (one's own realization) through the power of complete relinquishment and"},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"Notes 849 the nature of this enlightenment-(7) acting for the welfare of others through the riipakayas (the distinctive fe ature of not abiding in the extreme of peace) and (8)-(9) their activity and its result-the dharmakaya as one's own welfare (the distinctive feature of not abiding in the extreme of s;upsaric existence). As for the second nine, their objects are (a) the path and (b) the fruition of the hinayana. (a) consists of (a) its nature and (b) its distinctive features. (aa) refers to (1) the realization of merely personal identitylessness being deficient because of falling into either s;upsira or n�a. (ab) consists of (2) lacking the inner and outer mentors (the inferior cause of the path), (3) there being only the sixteen aspects of the four realities as the remedies for the afflictive obscurations, while the aspects of being free from the thirty-two superimposi­tions-the remedies for the cognitive obscurations-are incomplete (the inferior aspects of the path), and (4) relying on spiritual friends even at the end of their s;upsaric existence (the infe­rior function of the path). (b) consists of the fruition (a) in general and (b) in particular. (ba) is represented by (5). (bb) consists of (6) relinquishment being limited because of relinquishing merely the afflictive obscurations (inferior relinquishment), (7) various conceptions because of focusing on personal identitylessness as the different reference points of the sixteen aspects of the four realities (inferior realization), (8) being ignorant about abiding and engaging because of lacking the relinquishment of the cognitive obscurations-the svabhavikakaya (the inferior function), and (9) pursuing the mahayana subsequent to their own fruitions because of not hav­ing attained the complete realization of phenomenal identitylessness-the wisdom dharmakaya. 1005 Under the first nine conceptions about the apprehender, PGBG (pp. 375-76) has (2) not mentally engaging in real existence, but mentally engaging in the lack of real existence, (4) clinging to abiding in emptiness in the manner of nonabiding, (5) clinging through not clinging to entities, (6) clinging to all phenomenal entities as being mere imputations because they are not established as substantially existent, (7) clinging to the practice of the six paramitas through not clinging to them during subsequent attainment by virtue of not being attached to them during meditative equipoise, (8) clinging to the remedy for clinging to what is to be adopted and to be rejected, and (9) the impairment of proceeding toward the knowledge of all aspects as one wishes if one lacks the mother. The objects of the second nine consist of (1) focusing on the enlightenment of the hinayana, in which there is no final deliverance according to the aim, and clinging to it as an imputed entity, (3) focusing on the arising of results that entail the ceasing of causes, ( 4) clinging to being conjoined with the entities of the path during meditative equipoise while not being conjoined with them during subsequent attainment, and (5) clinging to abiding in form and so on through not abiding. As for the first nine, MCG (fols. 134a.2-135b.2) has clinging to the real existence of (1) the persons who seize and discard qualities and flaws, respectively (the nature of conduct), (2) those who mentally engage in an actuality that does not accord with the basic nature (the cause of conduct), (3) those who take birth in the three realms, {5) those who cling to the lack of real existence of all phenomena through taking them as objects, {7) those who have attachment to the six paramitas in terms of what is to be adopted and to be rejected, and (8) the remedy for the clinging to characteristics as being the experiencer. The second nine consist of clinging to (1) the persons who are not finally delivered according to the aim (the three greatnesses), or who do not attain the fruition according to their wishes, as being merely imputed experiencers, (3) those persons who cling to the seeming (the arising of results that entail the ceasing of causes) as being the ultimate, (4) those who cling to being uninterruptedly conjoined or not being so conjoined with the entities of the path (the continuum of the mahayana), (5) those who abide in form and so on through clinging to their real existence, (6) those who destroy the disposition of sravakas through generating bodhicitta and so on, (7) those without striving for buddhahood or the mahayana by virtue of contenting themselves with mere emptiness, and (8) those in whom the cause (prajiiaparamita) is absent and who thus lack activity, the teaching, meditation, and so on. As for the manner of relinquish­ing the clinging to substantially and imputedly existent persons who are experiencers, the slitras"},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"850 Groundless Paths teach the examples of illusions and so on, in which there is no conceiving of object, agent, and the result of activity. Accordingly, once the nonconceptual wisdom in which all reference points of apprehender and apprehended are at peace has matured, while there is no conceiving of any object whatsoever by thinking, \"I experience this object,\" noble bodhisattvas engage and reject objects through effortless enlightened activity. Other noble ones cling to objects being experi­enced by a merely imputed self and thus engage in and reject them in this way. Ordinary beings cling to objects being experienced by a substantially existent self, thus engaging in and rejecting them through clinging to their real existence. Therefore, one should abide in nonconceptuality through relinquishing conceptions in said way. According to MPZL (pp. 158-60), the first nine conceptions are in terms of conceiving (a) ordinary beings, (b) sravakas, and (c) mahayanists as being substantially existent. (a) consists of the persons who (1) seize and abandon births like illusory machines (the nature of ordinary beings), (2) entertain improper mental engagement (the cause), and (3) thus adhere to the three realms (the result). (b) consists of (4) the persons who do not abide in the realization of emptiness, but abide in the limited realizations that entail clinging to the real existence of form and so on. (c) consists of the mahayana persons in terms of (a) the path and (b) their faculties. (ca) consists of (5) the persons on the impure bhiimis who do not conceive of real entities, but cling to all phenomena through apprehending characteristics, and ( 6) the persons on the pure bhiimis who do not cling to phenomenal entities as phenomena in terms of substance and characteristics, but cling to them as imputations-mere illusions. (cb) As for persons of sharp faculties, they consist of (7) the persons who are skilled in relinquish­ing attachment through knowing true reality (the distinctive feature of relinquishment) and (8) the persons who are skilled in giving rise to remedial wisdom through realizing equality (the distinctive feature of the remedy). The persons of dull er faculties are (9) those whose proceed­ing toward the final fruition as they wish is impaired through not being skill ed in the means to familiarize with prajiiaparamita. The second nine conceptions of clinging to imputedly existent persons are in terms of (a) hinayana and (b) mahayana persons. (a) consist of the persons who, in general, (1) by virtue of inferior fruitions, are not finally delivered into the ultimate fruition as represented by the aim of the mahayana and, (2) by virtue of having entered the path of the hinayana, identify the mahayana path as not being the path that they themselves should enter. In particular, these persons (3) cling to the ground-the seeming phenomena of causes and results, which arise and cease-as being the ultimate, (4) are conjoined or not conjoined with a long continuum of the entities of the path by virtue of there being or not being obstacles in their meditative equipoise, and (5) abide in phenomena such as form by virtue of clinging to real existence during subsequent attainment. (b) consists of (6) the persons who destroy the hinayana disposition through means (such as generating bodhicitta), (7) realize through prajda that, ultimately, by virtue of the nature of suchness, there is no fruition to be accomplished that one could strive for, (8) realize that, ultimately, by virtue of the lack of nature, there is no cause such as cultivating the phenomena of the path, and (9) conventionally know the antagonistic factors of the path (maras and opponents) through observing them. 1006 PGBG (p. 376) says that the first two causes represent the cooperative causes of great enlightenment, while the third one is its substantial cause because they respectively aid enlightenment in the form of cooperative conditions and in a substantial way. MCG (fols. 135b.2-136a.2) explains that (1) \"enlightenment\" refers to the realization of ultimate great enlightenment, while the path is the wisdom of knowing termination and nonarising (explained in V.18). Therefore, in order to establish others in these two, bodhisattvas teach the path and introduce others to meditation. (2) As the cause of that realization, they grant prajftaparamitii to others. (3) The uninterrupted cause for attaining the path of seeing is to rest in meditative equipoise in the nature of phenomena. During subsequent attainment, bodhisattvas illuminate the dharma of scriptures and realization to others and during meditative equipoise, they famil­iarize with their own prajftaparamitii. These three are the causes of the path of seeing and each"},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"Notes 851 one of them entails an abundance of merit. According to MPZL (p. 161), (1) the conditions for the arising of the path of seeing are to establish others in the dharma of scriptures and realization-( a) teaching others the path of seeing and so on (the path toward the fruition of great enlightenment-the dharma of realization) and (b) entrusting the cause of that realiza­tion (scriptural prajii.aparamita as the dharma of scriptures) to others through explaining it to them and so on, which is illustrated by the explicit passage in the siitras in which the Buddha entrusts prajftaparamita to Ananda. (2) The uninterrupted substantial cause for attaining the special wisdom of the path of seeing is the accumulation of merit-the special samadhi of uni­fied calm abiding and superior insight that has the characteristic of an abundance of merit by virtue of having completed said accumulation during the first countless eon (of the three it takes to become a buddha). 1007 PGBG (p. 376) says that this verse teaches the nature of enlightenment and the reason for it. The ultimate wisdom of termination and nonarising is called \"great enlightenment\" because one must understand that what accomplishes the termination and nonarising of knowable objects means to realize that there are no previously existent stains to be terminated newly by any remedies and that there is nothing to be caused to arise newly from causes and conditions. According to MPZL (pp. 161-62), this verse presents the fruition in terms of relinquishment and attainment according to the system of Great Madhyamaka. The svabhavikakiya as the nature of the purity of being free from adventitious stains (the relinquishment of having termi­nated the two obscurations) and the dharmakaya (the realization of the basic nature-the lack of arising) are called \"the enlightenment of being free from adventitious stains.\" These two are also naturally pure because there is no termination of any essence of the two obscurations that is established by a nature of its own and because remedial uncontaminated wisdom is primordi­ally nonarising. Said two purities, in due order, are to be understood as the nature of the great enlightenment that is endowed with twofold purity. 1008 The Tibetan of the last two lines reads, \"What type of conceptions could be terminated and what kind of nonarising could be attained?\" (rnam par rtog rigs ci zhig zadl skye med rnam pa ci zhig 'thob). PBG comments accordingly. 1009 PGBG (p. 377) says that this verse teaches the manner in which enlightenment is with­out arising and ceasing. Through the path of seeing, what cognitive obscurations (the types of conception) to be relinquished could be terminated and ceased, and what kind of remedial wisdom of realizing nonarising could arise or be attained? It follows that there is no ceasing and arising of factors to be relinquished and their remedies, respectively, because enlightenment has the nature of lacking the kind of cessation that has the characteristics of having terminated what has arisen and obstructing the arising of what has not arisen. MCG (fols. 136b.4-137a.3) explains that, in terms of the fundamental nature of phenomena that is primordially pure, within abiding in the nature in which there is nothing to be ceased whatsoever, there is nothing to be terminated or to be attained (as explained in PBG). As for the reason of this, if the true nature of phenomena is stainless, it is suitable for an unmistaken state of mind to see it in this way, but if this nature is intrinsically stained, it would not be suitable to be seen as stainless. Rather, a state of mind that sees it as being stained would be a correct cognition, whereas seeing it as stainless would be a mistaken cognition, and a person with the latter state of mind would not be pure. According to MPZL (pp. 162-63), the reason for there being no termination and attainment is that, contrary to the assertions of realists, any stains that exist by a nature of their own cannot be terminated and a substantially existent cessation as the cause for such stains not arising again cannot be attained either. 1010 PGBG (p. 377) says this verse implicitly teaches the four yogas in the manner of saying that great enlightenment is not tenable if there were arising and ceasing. According to MCG (fol. 137b.1-2), if all phenomena were ultimately existent, how could one ever terminate the"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"852 Groundless Paths cognitive obscurations through not observing phenomena as the three spheres? MPZL (p. 163) says that realists hold the contradictory position that phenomena empty of the duality of apprehender and apprehended exist ultimately, while, in the mind stream of a buddha, all obscurations of conceiving of the three spheres have been terminated. 1011 PGBG (p. 377) says that, in dependent origination, no nature of appearances is to be removed through denying that appearing phenomena exist at all and no nature of the ultimate is to be added through superimposing ultimate existence. For if there were such a nature, one could not be liberated from clinging. Through relinquishing anything to be removed or to be added, actual reality is seen as it is. Through seeing it, one is liberated from the two obscura­tions because the mistakenness of clinging to real entities is put to an end. According to MCG (fols. 137b.2-138a.2), in the true nature of entities, there are no previously existing two types of obscurations that are to be removed and no previously nonexisting qualities (such as being empty) that are to be added newly. For the nature of entities, which cannot be produced, can­not be contrived through removal or addition. Therefore, if one rests in meditative equipoise in the actual reality or nature free from superimposition and denial (equality without anything to be removed or to be added) by way of seeing it as it is through a state of mind that concords with it in being free from denying and affirming, through the power of having familiarized with that, actual true reality-the basic nature of not abiding in any extreme whatsoever-is seen. Through this, one's mind stream is liberated from the bondage through conceptions about char­acteristics. This presents the ultimate essential point of the profound yoga of prajiiapiramiti. Thus, it is only in terms of the sheer way of how things appear that putting an end to the conceptions in one's mind stream that are inistaken about the nature of phenomena free from anything to be removed or to be added is called \"relinquishing the factors to be relinquished,\" while the arising of a state of mind that concords with the nature of phenomena is referred to as \"the arising of realization.\" However, in the basic nature, neither relinquishment nor arising are established. 1012 MCG (fol. 138a.S-138b.2) explains that the wisdom of the path of seeing consists of the amazing prajfta that is endowed with the aspect of means-all thirty-six subdivisions in terms of the isolates of the six piramitis (the generosity of generosity and so on) being complete. Or it is referred to as the wisdom of seeing the nature of all aspects of means (such as generosity) without exception as emptiness. For it means to rest, in the manner of dualistic appearances having vanished, in meditative equipoise in the actuality of the inexpressible equality of appear­ance and emptiness. 1013 PGBG (p. 378) says that the lion's sport is the path of liberation of the path of seeing. Just as a lion is not afraid of any other animals, in this samidhi one is not afraid of the factors to be relinquished through seeing. The purpose of examining dependent origination during its subsequent attainment is to distance oneself further from the factors to be relinquished through seeing, train one's dexterity in samadhi, and become learned in the topic of dependent origina­tion. According to MPZL (pp. 163-65), the nature of the culmination of the path of seeing is described in verses V.21-23, referring to (a) its wisdom of meditative equipoise and (b) an illustration of the practice during its subsequent attainment. (a) consists of (a) the wisdom of poised readiness (the uninterrupted path as the cause) and (b) the lion's sport (the wisdom of the path of liberation as the result). (aa) is threefold-(!) profound prajfta (the distinctive feature of being free from anything to be removed or to be added), (2) vast means (the aspect of being endowed with all paramitas), and (3) the nature of the wisdom of poised readiness (the union of prajiia and means). (aal) is taught by V.21-in this nature of the meditative equipoise of the path of seeing, in terms of the profound basic nature of objects, no phenomenon is to be removed or ceased and none is to be established or added. If this true end-the nature of great equality free from extremes, in which there is nothing to be removed, added, ceased, or estab­lished-is directly seen through the wisdom that sees in precise concordance with true reality,"},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"Notes 853 one is liberated from the obscurations to be relinquished through seeing. (aa2) is explained by V.22ab. (aa3) is described in V.22cd-the vast and profound wisdom of the union of prajiia and means, which has the nature of being in the process of becoming liberated from the factors to be relinquished, is divided in terms of isolates into the eight poised readinesses, but they are all included in the poised readiness of a single moment. (ab) The lion's sport as the path of libera­tion is found in V.23ab. (b) The practice during subsequent attainment is illustrated by V.23cd. However, besides the examination of the twelve links of dependent origination, the distinct features of practice during the subsequent attainment of the first bhiimi include the ten puri­fications of this bhiimi, its twelve times one hundred qualities, the supramundane paramitas, and the many meditative absorptions that make up its illusionlike subsequent attainment, such as the eight liberations, the four immeasurables, and various dhirar].is and samadhis. This also eliminates the assertion that the path of seeing has no subsequent attainment, which is an expla­nation that conflates the systems of the mahayana and the hinayana. 1014 PBG wrongly has \"origin [of suffering\" (kun 'byung). 1015 For the differing descriptions of crossing in one leap by PGBG, MCG, and MPZL, see Appendix XI. MCG (fol. 141a.1) adds that the function of cultivating the samadhis of crossing in one leap and so on is to terminate the conceptions to be relinquished through the path of familiarization. MPZL (pp. 165-66) adds that the culminating training of the path of familiar­ization is the special remedy for the innate factors to be relinquished through familiarization. It consists of calm abiding (the support) and superior insight (the supported). Here the focus is on the former, which consists of the preparatory stage (the lion's sport) and the actual stage (crossing in one leap). As for the great crossing in one leap, the sfttras explicitly teach only the descending progression, but the ascending one should be understood implicitly through that. 1016 The Tibetan has \"being abandoned.\" 1017 As for (4)-(6), PGBG (pp. 379-80) has the qualities of the path of preparation not exist­ing at the time of the path of seeing, the qualities of the path of seeing not really existing. and the qualities of the path of familiarization not existing at the time of the path of seeing. MCG (fols. 141a.3-142a.3) explains that the factors to engage in here consist of the scriptures and the realizations of the mahayana, while the factors to withdraw from (the second set of nine concep­tions about the apprehended) are the paths of �ravakas and pratyekabuddhas. Thus, the former are the objects to be engaged through the mahayana training, while the latter are not taken up through this training, but are mere objects of engagement of the primary minds and mental factors of bodhisattvas. In terms of what is to be known and the path, conceptions (1)-(2) refer to what is to be known; (3), to conduct; (4)-(6), to the qualities of the path; and (7)-(9), to the nature of the path. As for (4)-(6), the qualities of the paths in the three times do not exist ultimately, while existing seemingly because, in terms of the path of seeing being taken as the present, the path of preparation has already ceased, the path of seeing does not abide, and the path of familiarization has not yet arisen. MCG takes \"training\" (Tib. sbyor ba) in V.27b to mean \"preparation\" and thus says that these nine conceptions are relinquished during the pre­paratory stage of the path of familiarization. Generally, it says, the explanation of preparatory stage and actual stage refers to the difference in terms of the manifest factors to be relinquished being more or less easy to be relinquished, but their seeds are always relinquished at the time of the uninterrupted path of the actual stage. According to MPZL (pp. 167-68), the conceptions about the apprehended are about phenomena, while the conceptions about the apprehender are about persons. Here (1)-(2) represent the conceptions about the mahayana scriptures and the remaining seven, the conceptions about the mahayana realizations. The latter consist of (a) the conceptions about the flaws to be relinquished and (b) the qualities to be adopted. (a) consists of (3), which refers to seeming kinds of prajiiaparamita that are to be relinquished. (b) consists of (a) the ultimate qualities of emptiness and (b) the conventional qualities of appearance. (ba)"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"854 Groundless Paths consists of (4)-(6) conceiving of the qualities of the path of preparation, which have ceased before the path of seeing, as phenomena that are without ceasing ultimately; the qualities of the path of seeing that arise from the path of preparation as phenomena that are without nature ultimately; and the qualities of the path of familiarization as phenomena that are without arising ultimately. (bb) consists of (7)-(9) conceiving of the path of preparation as what prepares one for nirv8J;la through invalidating the factors to be relinquished; the path of seeing as the path of directly seeing the actuality of the nature of phenomena through relinquishing the seeds of the imputational factors to be relinquished; and the path of familiarization as the path of familiar­izing again and again with the actuality of the basic nature through relinquishing the seeds of the innate factors to be relinquished. 1018 PGBG (p. 380) has (3) mentally engaging in the sravaka path among the two paths of the hinayana and-implicitly taught-manifesting the pratyekabuddhayana, (S) familiarizing with enlightenment as impermanence and so on, (6) not familiarizing with it as such, and (7)-(8) neither familiarizing nor not familiarizing. MCG (fols. 142a.S-143a.l) says that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas deal with what is listed under these conceptions because, on their path of accumulation, (1) they lack mahayana spiritual friends and (2) their focusing on the welfare of others is narrow. On the path of preparation, (3) they possess their respective dispositions. On the path of seeing, ( 4) they lack the practice of prajiiaparamita in which prajfta and means are a union. (S) On the path of familiarization, they familiarize with a reflection of prajiiapiiramita or impermanence and so on for the sake of attaining the nirv8J;las of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas because they entertain reference points. ( 6) On the path of nonlearning, they do not familiarize with the actuality of the basic nature of having fully completed the mahayana path, or they do not depend on familiarizing again through focusing on impermanence and so on. (7)-(8) can also be understood as lacking the familiarization with the basic nature, while possessing the familiarization with impermanence and so on, or not familiarizing with impermanence and so on in a nonreferential manner, while familiarizing with the basic nature through clinging to real existence. (9) Therefore, they are not in accord with the true reality of the basic nature by virtue of falling into the extreme of clinging to the skandhas as being impermanent and so on. MPZL (pp. 168-69) also divides these nine according to the five paths, but differs with regard to the boundary line between the last two paths. (1)-(2) Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas on the path of accumulation belong to the inferior path of bodhicitta (the cause) not arising because their motivation is inferior, and they do not mentally engage in perfect enlightenment (the result) because the application of their motivation (the two accumulations) is inferior. (4) On the path of seeing, they do not mentally engage in unsurpassable enlightenment because they lack the prajftaparamita of special prajiia and means. On the path of familiarization, (S) they familiarize with the limited aspects of the four realities because they entertain reference points, and (6) they do not familiarize with the aspects of being free from the thirty-two superimpositions through being nonreferential. On the path of nonlearning, (7) they lack the complete ultimate familiar­ization with the basic nature because they lack the ultimate relinquishment and realization. (8) They possess the complete limited familiarization with the reference points of the aspects of the four realities. (9) They do not realize the basic nature in accord with true reality because they have not relinquished the cognitive obscurations of clinging to impermanence and so on. 1019 MCG (fol. 143a.4-143b.S) explains that (1)-(3) are in terms of prajiia or what is to be known; (4)-(5), in terms of the prajfta or view of sravakas and bodhisattvas; (6)-(7), in terms of their means or conduct; and (8)-(9), as in PBG. (1) What are regarded as substantially exis­tent experiencers are the persons who focus on ordinary beings and so on-the spheres that are helplessly imputed onto sentient beings (the skandhas)-and cling to them as substantial. The same applies for those who cling to (2) what does not exist ultimately as being really exis­tent as the mere imputations of the phenomena of subject and object, (3) the real existence of conventionally nonempty phenomena such as the knowledge of all aspects, (4) sravakas being"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"Notes 855 attached to the real existence of the phenomena of ordinary beings or purified phenomena, (5) bodhisattvas clinging to the real existence of the prajfia of fully discriminating the actuality of the basic nature, (6) srivakas practicing through forming. or aiming at, the path and the frui­tion of their own welfare (mere peace) as entities of clinging to characteristics, (7) bodhisattvas being finally delivered in terms of the three yanas, (8) the impurity of offerings-identityless­ness being incomplete due to ordinary beings and sravakas on the path of accumulation clinging to real existence, and (9) disordered conduct with regard to the paramitas such as generosity­observing them as the three spheres under the influence of clinging to real existence. According to MPZL (pp. 170-71), these nine conceptions are about persons who are (a) distinguished by the view (the ground), (b) the path (meditation), (c) the fruition to be attained, and (d) conduct (the activity). (a) consists of conceiving of the substantiality of (1) those hinayana persons who are the psychophysical supports of realizing the ground that is personal identitylessness and thus know that sentient beings are mere spheres of imputation, (2) those mahayana persons who are the psychophysical supports of realizing the ground that is phenomenal identityless­ness and thus regard phenomena as mere imputations and mere dependent origination, and (3) ordinary beings, who are the psychophysical supports of not realizing the ground that consists of both identitylessnesses and thus cling to the real existence of all phenomena, that is, their not being empty. (b) consists of conceiving of the substantiality of (4) those persons on the hinayana path who are the psychophysical supports of being attached to the phenomena of the characteristics of the three spheres due to not having relinquished clinging in any respect and (5) those persons on the mahayana path who are the psychophysical supports of discriminating phenomena due to realizing the lack of nature. (c) consists of conceiving of the substantiality of (6) those hinayana persons who are the psychophysical supports of aiming at the fruition that consists of just limited entities of relinquishment and realization due to lacking the aim of the three greatnesses and (7) those mahayana persons who are the psychophysical supports of being finally delivered into perfect enlightenment-the fruition that consists of the relinquishments and realizations of all the three yanas. (d) consists of conceiving of the substantiality of (8) hinayana ordinary beings, who are the psychophysical supports of the impurity of offerings due to not engaging in the correct manner of common conduct and (9) mahayana ordinary beings, who are the psychophysical supports of disordered conduct with regard to generosity and so on due to lacking the uncommon conduct-the paramitas without observing the three spheres. 1020 PGBG (p. 381), MCG (fol. 144a.1-2), and MPZL (p. 171) agree that these nine concep­tions are about objects (imputed sentient beings) and subjects, that is, the clinging to imputations (the causes for imputing them-the mere appearance of the continuum of the skandhas). 1021 The Tibetan of line V.33b has bdag nyid ji bzhin for Skt. yathasval'fl (\"each one,\" \"respectively\"). 1022 According to MCG (fol. 144a.4-144b.4), (1)-(3) refer to the ignorance about the focal objects of the three knowledges. (1)-(2) Sravakas on the path of accumulation are ignorant about relinquishing the obscurations of the knowledge of all aspects and the knowledge of the path because they do not know the aspects of suchness and variety, nor all three paths, respec­tively. (3) Ordinary beings are ignorant about relinquishing the obscurations of the knowledge of entities because they do not understand all entities. The innate conceptions here impute per­sons onto these three ignorances and then cling to them as experiencers. Likewise, the next conceptions refer to the ignorance about (4) prajfiaparamita-the path that pacifies all obscura­tions (the nature of the path to liberation)-and (8) the nature of the afilictions (being mistaken about the basic nature, that is, not knowing that the factors to be relinquished are adventitious or emptiness). According to MPZL (pp. 171-72), the objects of these nine conceptions are the persons who are ignorant about (a) the divisions of the obscurations to be relinquished and (b) its remedy-the path of prajfiaparamita. (a) consists of (1)-(3) and (b) consists of the persons who are ignorant about (a) prajfiaparamita (the subject) and (b) ground, path, and fruition (the"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"856 Groundless Paths objects). (ba) consists of (4) those who do not know the distinctive feature of the remedy-the path of prajiiaparamita, which is the clear realization of all phenomena of ground, path, and fruition being the peace of reference points. (bb) consists of (5) those who are ignorant about the ground (knowable objects)-the nature of phenomena (suchness) and its bearers (form and so on) being conjoined or disjoined, those who are ignorant about the path in terms of (6) its distinctive feature (being unequal to, and more eminent than, all other paths due to not being the sphere of maras and so on) and (7) its nature (knowing its focal objects-the four realities), and those who are ignorant about the fruition in terms of (8) relinquishment (the pure nature of the afilictions, which are adventitious stains) and (9) realization (the nature of remedial wisdom without the duality of apprehender and apprehended). 1023 The Tibetan has \"supreme\" (mchog) instead of \"desired\" (Skt. nikama). 1024 MCG (fols. 144b.4-145a.2) says that the four conceptions become more and more extinguished through the path of familiarization and thus do not arise again. Bodhisattva mahasattvas on the pure bhlimis or on the tenth bhlimi possess the consummate qualities of the three yanas being contained in their own mind streams and of accomplishing the happiness of all beings because the obstacles to promoting the welfare of others are terminated. According to MPZL (p. 173), to accomplish the happiness of beings represents the distinctive feature of the welfare of others, while the consummate qualities of relinquishment and realization being complete represents the distinctive feature of one's own welfare. These qualities of the path-all the relinquishments and realizations that are included in the three yanas-represent the distinc­tive feature of the support that sustains, in a spontaneous and effortless manner, the mahasattvas who perfected said relinquishments and realizations. 1025 The Tibetan has \"jravakas.\" 1026 The Tibetan of this line says. \"With nothing between it and buddhahood\" (sangs rgyas nyid kyi bar med de). 1027 PGBG (p. 382) says that the direct result of this samadhi is buddhahood, that is, the knowledge of all aspects. MCG (fol. 145b.4-6) glosses \"the flawless bhlimi of bodhisattvas\" as the first bhlimi and says that the uninterrupted path at the end of the continuum is the uninter­rupted path of the knowledge of all aspects. According to MPZL (pp. 173-74), V.37-38 teach the nature of the culmination of the uninterrupted path-the samadhi of the union of calm abiding and superior insight. V.37 refers to the nature of this path lying in its cause-the immeasurable merit of the two accumulations during three incalculable eons. The siitras' explicit teaching of bodhisattvas possessing such merit points to the hidden meaning that it is the culminating train­ing with nothing between it and attaining buddhahood that is endowed with this merit (\"the flawless bhlimi of bodhisattvas\" is glossed as the path of seeing). V.38 refers to the essence of this uninterrupted path being the wisdom of the ultimate union of calm abiding and superior insight. It consists of the ultimate calm abiding of the uninterrupted samadhi, whose nature is calm abiding (the support), and the wisdom of superior insight of knowing all the immeasur­able aspects of ground, path, and fruition (the supported). 1028 PGBG (p. 382) speaks of focusing on all phenomena as lacking any entity, the mindful­ness of not forgetting the focal objects and aspects of the three knowledges, and the aspect of natural peacefulness. MCG (fol. 146a.1-146b.l) says that the focal object is the ultimate such­ness of all phenomena not existing as any entities of any reference points, while mindfulness refers to focusing on suchness below the tenth bhlimi. This culmination of the uninterrupted path has the nature of being the highest training in prajiiaparamita. Since omniscient wisdom arises immediately after it, it is the genuine mine of all buddha qualities, the disposition for not severing the lineage of the buddhas, and the inexhaustible treasure of the happiness and well­being of all sentient beings. Therefore, once one gives rise to the ultimate prajiia of realizing"},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"Notes 857 that all dependently originating phenomena primordially abide as equality in that they are with­out arising and ceasing, the wisdom in which even the most subtle characteristics of reference points are at peace overcomes beginningless ignorance, including its seeds, and thus the bud­dhahood of being endowed with the kaya of self-arising wisdom is attained. Through this, the uninterrupted path of the ultimate wisdom of knowing termination and nonarising is taught. According to MPZL (pp. 174-75), the focal object is the suchness of great equality free from reference points-the identitylessness of all phenomena of ground, path, and fruition lacking any entity of reference points. The dominant factor (or condition) is the samadhi of spontane­ous calm abiding-the yoga of the continuum of undistracted mindfulness. The aspect is the wisdom of perfect superior insight-the yoga in which all modes of apprehending any focal objects, characteristics, and reference points are at peace. 1029 According to MPZL (p. 175), those who talk a lot are the realists with their valid cognitions of seeing just this life, who are not skilled in the means to realize the profound noncontradictori­ness of the two realities. 1030 PGBG (p. 383) explains (11) as it not being tenable to rely on the paths and fruitions of sriivakas and pratyek!abuddhas in one's mind stream. According to MCG (fols. 146b.4-147b.3), (1) if tathagata wisdom observes all phenomena, something to be observed, such as conditioned phenomena, is established. But if there is not even an atom to be observed, it is impossible to see all phenomena. Therefore, a focal object is not tenable. (2) If there is no nature of anything to be observed, it is not tenable to identify the nature of true reality free from reference points either. Since it is not feasible to be known by anybody, its aspect or nature cannot be identified. (4) If there is no seeming, it is impossible for an ultimate to exist independently of it, and the seeming is not tenable because it is not observable. (5) The training in practicing generosity and so on is not tenable because generosity and so on do not exist. (6)-(8) The jewel of the Buddha is not tenable because there is no attainer and nothing to be realized. Nor are the dharma and the saipgha tenable because cessation is a mere name and the bases for designating a saipgha (such as form) do not exist. (9) The distinctive feature of conduct-skill in means-does not exist because there are no generosity and so on that are embraced by any prajiiii that is pure of the three spheres. (11) Since it is not tenable that clinging to impermanence is mistaken, clinging to purity, happiness, and so on is not mistaken either. (12) Since the fruition is not manifested despite having cultivated the path, a nature of the path is not tenable. (15) Since there are no instances, general and specific characteristics are not tenable. (16) If there are no general and specific characteristics to be familiarized with, it is not tenable for those who engage through aspiration and the noble ones to familiarize with suchness by way of general and specific charac­teristics, respectively. According to MPZL (pp. 175-77), these sixteen disputes are (a) in general and (b) in particular. (a) (1) The explanation that the focal object of the culmination of the uninterrupted path is justified as a nonentity and (2) the identification of its aspect having the nature of peacefulness are mutually exclusive and therefore not tenable. Thus, (3) the wisdom of the knowledge of all the aspects of ground, path, and fruition is not tenable either. (b) consists of (a) disputes about the focal object in terms of ground, path, and fruition (the objects), (b) disputes about the aspects of the three knowledges (the subjects), and (c) the manner of disput­ing in summary. As for (ba), (4) since said focal object is not tenable, the ground-ultimate reality-is not tenable, and since that does not exist, conventional seeming reality is not tenable either. (5) Since the seeming does not exist, the training that consists of the six piiramitiis is not tenable. (6) Since said training (the cause) does not exist, its result-the jewel of the Buddha (the wisdom dharmakaya of realization)-is not tenable. (7) Without that, the dharma (the of relin­quishment) is not tenable. (8) Without such realization and relinquishment, their support-the saJpgha as the ultimate assembly-is not tenable. (bb) Since said aspects of the fruition do not exist, the knowledge of all aspects, including its enlightened activity-(9) skillful actions (the distinctive feature of means) and (10) the knowledge of all aspects of realizing the aspects of"},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"858 Groundless Paths the sage as lacking arising (the distinctive feature of realization)-is not tenable. Because there is no path, the knowledge of the path, including its mistaken factors to be relinquished-( H) mistaken paths (the distinctive fe ature of the factors to be relinquished) and (12) the knowledge of the path of realizing that the three paths are unobservable (the distinctive feature of the remedy)-is not tenable. Because there are no entities, the knowledge of entities in terms of remedies and antagonistic factors-(13) the remedial knowledge of entities of realizing that entities are free from extremes (the distinctive feature of the remedy) and the clinging to the characteristics of entities being the antagonistic factor (the distinctive feature of the factors to be relinquished)-are not tenable. (be) Thus, (15) since the three knowledges (the bearers of the nature of phenomena) do not exist, a defining characteristic in which these three are included is not tenable. (1) Since there is no clear realization that has such a characteristic, its aspect­the training in familiarization-is not tenable. As for the means to eliminate said disputes, one should be skilled in presenting the path by way of the means to realize the profound essential point of the two realities not being contradictory. 1031 LSSP (fol. 219b.3) glosses \"each\" as \"single\" and says,\" ... it takes the wisdom that has the nature of generosity and such-the essence of the single (that is, each) instant to be focused on-as its object.\" 1032 The Tibetan of this verse varies somewhat: When the nature of all spotless phenomena­Prajiiaparamiti, the state Of the true nature of maturation-is born, Then [it is] the wisdom in one single instant. 1033 The Tibetan of line VII.Sb adds \"likewise\" at the end. 1034 According to MPZL (pp. 180-83), through the power of having perfected the serial train­ing, finally, without depending on alternating meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment, there arises the wisdom of becoming fully awakened in a single instant in which all aspects of the path are completed simultaneously. This is the instantaneous training, which is divided into four in terms of isolates. (1) The nature of the instantaneous training in terms of nonmaturation is the aspect of vastness, the ultimate accumulation of merit. Through having perfected the serial training that entails the six paramitas during subsequent attainment, each one of the paramitas such as generosity (the accumulation of vast means-the ultimate causes of the riipakayas as the results of maturation) is manifested. Through this, all the vast uncontaminated phenomena that are of similar type (the aspects of the three knowledges) are manifested in the manner of their being included in said paramitas. This wisdom of the sage becoming fully awakened in a single instant is to be understood as the characteristic that is the isolate of the instant of the non­maturation of vast means because they have not yet matured as their results of maturation-the nature of the qualities of the riipakayas. Thus, it refers to the isolate of the accumulation of vast means-the causes for the maturation of these qualities. The example of the waterwheel refers to the manner of this instantaneous wisdom of nonmaturation being able to manifest all aspects of vast means of similar type through manifesting just a single means such as generosity. (2) The nature of the wisdom of the instantaneous training in terms of maturation is profound prajiia-the clear realization that consists of the ultimate accumulation of wisdom. Through having perfected the serial training in terms of the nature of lack of entity, the remedial uncon­taminated wisdom that is the accumulation of profound prajiia and the ultimate cause of the dharmakaya as the result of freedom is manifested. At that point, the basic nature of all pure phenomena that are as spotless as the autumn moon (natural purity and the purity of being free from stains)-naturally luminous wisdom, prajiiaparamita, the primordially matured intrinsic brilliance of the true nature-is born in the manner of manifesting in its state of being pure of adventitious stains. At that point, the wisdom of becoming fully awakened in a single instant is"},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"Notes 859 to be understood as the characteristic that is the isolate of the single instant of the maturation of profound prajfta because the result of freedom (the qualities of the dharmakaya) is already matured primordially. Thus, it refers to the isolate of the accumulation of profound prajfta. (3) The nature of the wisdom of the instantaneous training in terms of the lack of characteristics is the ultimate clear realization of having fa miliarized with equality as being free from refer­ence points. Through having perfected the training in nonabiding (not clinging to objects as the cause of the ultimate fruition that is the dharmakaya of equality), the wisdom of all objects lacking characteristics (the ultimate cause of the dharmakaya of equality) sees that all naturally pure phenomena (engaging in generosity and such) are equality, just like the appearance of objects in a dream. Through abiding in that samadhi, one realizes the lack of characteristics of all phenomena of saipsiira and nirviil)a (what is to be rejected and to be adopted) as being equality {MPZL mistakenly has \"nonduality\" instead of \"lack of characteristics\" in both its ren­dering of AA VII.4c and this comment}. Thus, the wisdom of becoming fully awakened in a single instant is to be understood as the characteristic that is the isolate of the single instant of the lack of characteristics-equality (the object) because even the most subtle obscurations of clinging to knowable objects as anything to be adopted or to be rejected have been relinquished. Thus, it refers to the isolate of realizing the object-the lack of characteristics-as equality. (4) The nature of the wisdom of the instantaneous training in terms of nonduality is the clear realization that consists of the ultimate training in the cognizing subject being without dualistic appearance. Through having perfected the training in nontraining (not clinging to the subject), the wisdom without any dualistic appearance (the ultimate cause of the ultimate fruition that is nondual wisdom) sees all phenomena, which appear as if they were apprehender and appre­hended, to be the true reality of nonduality, just as the appearances in a dream and the subject that sees them are nothing but isolates, but not ultimately seen in the dualistic fa shion of appre­hender and apprehended. Thus, the wisdom of becoming fully awakened in a single instant is to be understood as the characteristic that is the isolate of the single instant of nonduality (the subject) because even the most subtle obscurations in terms of the dualistic appearances of apprehender and apprehended have been relinquished. Thus, it refers to the isolate of realizing the cognizing subject as nonduality without dualistic appearances. Some say, \"It fo llows then that there is the simultaneous seeing of the two realities even on the paths of learning because the instantaneous training belongs to the paths of learning.\" However, they seem to not even understand as much as the manner in which the paramitas that possess the fo ur dharmas (see MahayanasutriJla'Tikdra XVI.8-13) exist on the paths of learning. 1035 PGBG (pp. 386-87) says that the svabhavikakaya possesses three fe atures-having attained the twenty-one sets of wisdom (the uncontaminated dharmas) through the power of the supramundane path, being pure in every respect of all adventitious stains to be relinquished (the ultimate reality of cessation), and the characteristic of these qualities of realization and relin­quishment being void by nature/of a nature. MCG (fol. 158a.3-4) says that the svabhavikakaya is the nature of phenomena or the dharmadhatu that has the characteristic of being endowed with the two purities-the single uncontaminated nature of phenomena to be explained being pure in every respect and the wisdoms that make it up, in terms of their nature, being naturally pure. According to MPZL (pp. 184-85), the svabhavikakaya possesses the three distinctive fe a­tures of (1) realization-the wisdom dharmakaya (the result of freedom that consists of the twenty-one sets of uncontaminated qualities of the dharmakaya that are attained through the power of the supramundane path eliminating the adventitious stains), (2) relinquishment­the purity of being free from adventitious stains in every respect through having relinquished the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies, and (3) nature-natural purity (these phenomena of realization and relinquishment having the characteristic of the naturally pure basic nature). When the nature of ultimate realization and relinquishment is taken to consist of the three kayas, one speaks of just the dharmakaya. If the latter is divided in terms of isolates,"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"860 Groundless Paths the ultimate relinquishment-the factor of being endowed with twofold purity-is called \"the svabhavikakaya,\" while the ultimate realization-uncontaminated wisdom-is referred to as \"the wisdom dharmakaya., However, the assertion that the dharmakaya is one among the three kayas that constitute three of the four dharmas which define the topic of the dharmakaya (the eighth chapter of the AA) corresponds to how Aryavimuktisena comments on the intention of the AA. The assertion that there are four kayas and that it is these four that constitute the four defining dharmas of the topic of the dharmakaya appears to be an explanation of what is taught implicitly in the AA. In particular, the assertion of the uncontaminated qualities of the dharmakaya being the result of freedom is to be understood according to what is taught explic­itly in the Uttaratantra. The presentation of the dharmakaya's not being produced by causes and conditions (the meaning taught in the siitras and the great treatises, which for the time being relies on common and uncommon valid cognitions) by virtue of the difference between the actual way of being and the way of appearing represents the points that are even more profound than the profound presentation of the knowledge of all aspects. It appears to be something to be realized henceforth, but it is not the sphere of people like us. Therefore, I think, it is something in which one needs to have confidence. 1036 The Tibetan has \"lack of afflictions\" (nyon mongs med). 1037 The Tibetan has \"nothing to guard\" (bsrung ba med pa). 1038 As mentioned in PSD, this refers to the Sanskrit ca (Tibetan dang) at the end of this line, which is simply a verse filler. \"The two knowledges\" refers to the knowledges of entities and the path. 1039 PBG presents the twenty-one sets as lines of verse. 1040 PBG mistakenly has bzhi (\"four\") instead of gzhi. 1041 MCG (fol. 160b.1-2) explains that, though the factors concordant with enlightenment and so on of learners and buddhas are the same in name, those of buddhas are unique compared to learners because they point out, by way of isolates, the seeing of nondual wisdom in which all reference points of minds and mental factors have subsided. According to MPZL (p. 185), the buddha qualities that are the result of freedom are immeasurable, but when summarized, they consist of said twenty-one sets. 1042 The Tibetan of VIII.7ab (nyan thos nyon mongs med pa'i lta/ mi yi nyon mongs yongs spong nyid) says: The view of the dispassion of Srivakas Means relinquishing the aftlictions of people. 1043 PGBG (p. 388) says that the samadhi of dispassion of buddhas who are victorious over the four maras is superior to the samadhi of dispassion of sravakas and so on. For the latter, through said samadhi, first look into whether they will or will not serve as focal objects for the arising of the aftlictions of other people and thus just avoid the afflictions of these people that could possibly arise, while the samadhi of buddhas extinguishes the stream of all afflictions without exception of anybody in villages and so on in whom aftlictions may arise. MCG (fol. 160b.3-5) explains that, when sravakas and so on see that afflictions arise in certain people in villages and so on upon these beings focusing on them, they avoid these afflictions through not going there. On the other hand, buddhas deliberately go to villages and so on in order to extin­guish the stream of the afflictions of the persons who live there. 1044 MCG (fol. 160b.6) explains \"free from attachment\" as being free from the aftlictive obscu­rations or the latent tendencies of clinging to characteristics. According to MPZL (p. 187), the Buddha's knowledge through aspiration is effortless (the distinctive fe ature of its nature), free"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"Notes 861 from attachment due to not clinging to any entities (the distinctive feature of relinquishment), unobstructed due to having relinquished the two obscurations, including their latent tendencies, remains forever in meditative equipoise for as long as sarp.sara lasts (the distinctive feature of time), and solves all questions simultaneously (the distinctive feature of activity). 1045 The Tibetan has \"appear\" (snang ba). 1046 PGBG (p. 388) glosses \"the cause of maturation\" as the two accumulations in the mind streams of those to be guided, while MPZL (p. 187) takes it as former aspiration prayers and accumulations. MCG (fol. 161a.2-3) presents this verse as the answer to thinking, \"If buddhas lack being near or far, this contradicts their appearing to some to be guided, while not appearing to others.\" 1047 The Tibetan has \"the king of the gods\" (lha'i rgyal po). 1048 According to MPZL (p. 188), there is the following dispute about VIII.9: \"If buddhas have such effortless and spontaneous power to guide those to be guided, it follows that they guide all sentient beings to be guided simultaneously.\" VIII.lO represents the rebuttal of this, saying, \"There is no entailment.\" 1049 MCG (fol. 161b.1-3) presents the objection, \"Since the dharmakaya dwells solely in Akani�tha, it is not permanent and all-pervading.\" It is all-pervading because it appears to those to be guided in all directions and times in an effortless manner as all kinds of bodies and speech and because its activity for sentient beings is so vast that it pervades all of space. It is permanent because it is inexhaustible until the end of time. 1050 PGBG (p. 389), MCG (fol. 161b.4-6), and MPZL (p. 189) agree that the sambhogikakaya is the ultimate rtipakaya that is endowed with the five certainties. 1051 The words in bold that are not included in VIII.13-17 are from VIII.19-20. 1052 The Tibetan is very clear on this line, while the Sanskrit dhviintapradhvastiilokaSuddhatii is very ambiguous and can also mean what Conze has (\"his pure light dispels the darkness\"). However, both the Sanskrit and the Tibetan of this minor mark in the Mahavyutpatti (section 18, no. 300) confirm my translation. 1053 In the Tibetan, the order of \"smooth\" and \"slender\" is reversed. 1054 The Tibetan has bkra shis (\"auspicious\") for swastika. In another Tibetan version of this verse, there is an additional line after the third one, which explicitly adds \"and are ornamented with swastikas\" (g.yung drung 'khyil bas brgyan pa ste; see PBG's comments). 1055 MCG (fol. 17b.1) speaks of eighty auspicious signs, such as squares, vajras, lotuses, and conches. 1056 According to MPZL (p. 197), this verse describes the nairmU)ikakaya's five distinctive features of (1) the rtipakaya (emanations such as the nairmU)ikakaya of a supreme buddha), (2) time (appearing until saJllsara is emptied), (3) object (all kinds of beings in the ten directions), (4) fruition (all kinds of benefits in terms of higher realms and liberation), and (5) activity (guid­ing beings equally through effortless, spontaneously present, and unbiased enlightened activity). 1057 PGBG (p. 393) says that the enlightened activity of the dharmakaya is perpetual until the end of 58Jllsara because its dominant condition-the dharmakaya-is equally perpetual. MCG (fol. 168a.6) explains that the enlightened activity of the wisdom dharmakaya is as perpetual as the promotion of the welfare of beings through the two rtipakayas, which arise from the bless­ing of the dharmakaya. According to MPZL (p. 197), enlightened activity is a subpoint of the nairmai)ikakaya, with lines VIII.34ab representing the brief introduction to its nature. However, in its comments, MPZL also glosses it as \"the enlightened activity of the dharmakaya.\""},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"862 Groundless Paths 1058 In the following, the numbers in ( ) indicate the twenty-seven points of enlightened activity. 1059 MCG (fol. 168b.2-3) agrees with this line indicating the establishment in the support of the path, but adds that it refers to the path of accumulation. Both MCG and MPZL (p. 197) say that this means to establish beings (MPZL: those in the lower realms) in the psychophysical sup­ports of gods and humans in the higher realms in order to pacify their suffering. 1060 MCG (fol. 168b.3-5) speaks of (2) as establishing in the training (glossing \"the four means of attraction\" as \"the causes for maturing oneself and others\") and of (3) as establish­ing in the view (realizing the four realities, with \"afflicted and purified phenomena\" being \"the realities of suffering and its origin\" and \"the realities of cessation and the path,\" respectively). ( 4) means to establish in the motivation (generating the bodhicitta of promoting the welfare of sentient beings by focusing on said welfare); (5), in the application of that motivation (practic­ing the six paramitas); and (6), in the ethics of vows (taking up the ten virtues as the path to buddhahood). According to MPZL (p. 198), (2)-(6) respectively are the companion on the path, the nature of the path, and the distinctive features of motivation (generating the mindset for accomplishing the welfare of beings, such as the immeasurables), application, and foundation. 1061 Note that this is the second to last of the twenty-seven points of enlightened activity in the order of the AA. Different from LSSP, PSD, and PBG, PGBG, MCG, and MPZL follow this order. 1062 PGBG (pp. 393-94) says that, on the second and third bhiimis, one is established in (9) the prajfla about phenomena being labeled as symbols and, on the fourth, fifth, and sixth bhiimis, in (10) the prajfla of nonobservation. (23) refers to mistakenness being relinquished in the manner of its nonsubstantiality. According to MCG (fol. 169a.1-169b.4), on the second and third bhlimis, one is established in (9) the ethics and patience that are endowed with the wisdom of realization of mere symbols; on the fourth, fifth, and sixth bhiimis, in (10) not observing any phenomena through clinging to their real existence; on the seventh bhiimi, in (11) maturing living beings through being skilled in means; on the eighth bhlimi, in (12) knowing the three paths (illustrated by the bodhisattva path with its vast merit), (13) putting an end to all clinging by virtue of the maturation of nonconceptual wisdom, (14) attaining enlightenment through this in an effortless manner, and (15) gaining mastery over pure buddha realms; and, on the ninth bhiimi, in (16) the definitiveness of being separated from enlightenment by only a single birth and (17) accomplishing the immeasurable welfare of sentient beings through teaching the dharma by virtue of having attained the four discriminating awarenesses. Through receiving the excellent empowerment on the tenth bhlimi, one is established in (18) attaining immeasur­able qualities (such as traveling to all buddha realms, attending buddhas, venerating them, and listening to their dharma), (19) attaining the immeasurable further increase of the realizations of the branches of enlightenment, (20) the actions of the two accumulations not being lost, but accomplished as buddhahood, (21) directly and completely seeing the vastness of the four realities, (22) completely relinquishing the fourfold mistakenness, (23) lacking the clinging to characteristics (the substance of said mistakenness), (24) perfecting the supreme purification of the stains through realizing all phenomena as equality, (25) completing all accumulations with­out exception, and (26) the ultimate wisdom of the paths of learning-the equality of sarpsiric existence and peace (not understanding or observing conditioned sarpsira and unconditioned nirvil)a as being different). According to MPZL (pp. 198-200), on the seven impure bhiimis, one is established in (9) realizing that the nature of all phenomena consists of the imputations of mere symbols (by virtue of the piramitas of ethics and so on being predominant on the second to fifth bhiimis), (10) the nature of realizing that all phenomena are unobservable (by virtue of the piramita of prajfla being predominant on the sixth bhlimi), and (11) maturing sentient beings (by virtue of the piramita of means being predominant on the seventh bhiimi).

In the third one, due to the absence of exhilaration, the benefit of bliss is complete, but there are still three flaws of dhyina (inhalation, exhalation, and bliss), which means it is slightly impure in the sense of lacking total equanimity.

PVSD does not provide boundary lines for the eight topics and the very few it gives for the seventy points are all identical to those of PSD. 1263 As mentioned before, the AA and most of its commentaries speak of five branches (PSD and PBG have four), with this one here being the first one. 1264 Pp. 59, 61-63, and 70ff. 1265 Fols. 8a.6-13a.3. 1266 Pp. 12-18. 1267 According to MPZL (p. 184), these are (1) the wisdom dharmakaya (the realization), (2) the purity of being free from adventitious stains (the relinquishment), and (3) natural purity (the nature). 1268 According to MPZL (p. 197), these are the distinctive fe atures of (1) the nlpakaya (ema­nations such as the nairm�ikakaya of a supreme buddha), (2) time (appearing until s;upsira is emptied), (3) object (all kinds of beings in the ten directions), (4) fruition (all kinds of benefits in terms of higher realms and liberation), and (5) activity (guiding beings through effortless, spontaneously present, and unbiased enlightened activity). 1269 Pp. 113-20 (slightly abbreviated and paraphrased). In terms of many of its quotes and also parts of its contents, this presentation relies on the one in Rongton's commentary Ts hig don rab tu gsal ba (see Brunnholzl2010, Appendix 11E4) 1270 Lines 11cd. 1271 These three instances reflect the entire range of how \"disposition\" is understood in the Yogacira and the Madhyamaka traditions. In the former tradition, one finds all three, while the latter usually only refers to the second one. Thus, it is especially remarkable that roots of virtue (which, unlike the other two, are conditioned and have to be acquired) are included here, which also seems to be at variance with the definition of the disposition right below. However, further down, PGSD even speaks of a conditioned naturally abiding disposition (the mere lucid awareness of the mental consciousness with stains). In general, PGSD's presentation of the dis­position according to Madhyamaka exhibits typical traits of both classical Madhyamaka and the Shentong system. Thus, it accords, more or less, with the classical Nyingma positions on buddha nature as presented by Rongzom, Longchenpa, and Mipham Rinpoche, which tend to harmo­nize said two systems. However, as in the above case, PGSD's presentation also contains a few rather unusual elements (see more below). 1272 These lines are Cittavajrastava 7d and 1d, respectively. 1273 Dharmadhatustava 23cd. 1274 Note that this term was coined by Dolpopa and is usually regarded as a key term in the Shentong system. 1275 DllO, fol. 55b.1-2. 1276 Ibid., fol. 13a.6 reads: By virtue of ever possessing natural luminosity, It is thus the tathagata disposition. Elsewhere, PGSD (p. 123) explicitly classifies the nature of phenomena (suchness) as the ulti­mate virtue. Note that PGSD's equating the sugata heart with ultimate virtue accords with JNS and Buton's AA commentary on the disposition (see Brunnholzl2010, Appendices 11E4 and I2E3)."},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"874 Groundless Paths 1277 As mentioned before, the presentation of a conditioned naturally abiding disposition versus an unconditioned one is very unusual in both classical Madhyamaka and Shentong. It is closer to the typical Gelugpa presentation of nonconceptual wisdom being conditioned and momentary (also held by Sakya Chogden), while the nature of phenomena (emptiness) is unconditioned and permanent. Also, as far as its final manifestation as the wisdom dharmakiya goes, the definition of the unconditioned naturally abiding disposition is identical to the one of the unfolding disposition below. 1278 To say that buddha nature pervades everything, even material things, is quite unusual in the Indo-Tibetan tradition (though common in Chinese Buddhism) and naturally begs the ques­tion why these material things cannot attain buddhahood too (for details on this, see Brunnholzl 2010, endnote 1289). Note also that the above \"dharmadhiitu of the unity of appearance and emptiness\" is not the same as the standard Gelugpa interpretation of buddha nature as mere emptiness, which, of course, also pervades everything animate and inanimate. 1279 03793, fol. 89b.3. 1280 Pp. 230-40 (slightly abbreviated and paraphrased). 1281 03805, fol. 152b.2-3. 1282 PGSO mistakenly has Dalabhumikasutra. 1283 LSSP, fols. 188b.6-189b.3; PSO, pp. 383-84. In the fo llowing, the nine meditative absorp­tions of progressive abiding (the four dhyiinas, the fo ur fo rmless absorptions, and the meditative absorption of cessation) are numbered as 1 - 9, while the state of mind of the desire realm of not being in meditative equipoise is indicated by 0. In the context of the culminating training of the path of familiarization as presented by the siitra in twenty-five thousand lines, all the steps within the lion's sport and the crossing in one leap represent a single continuous sequence of dif­ferent meditative equipoises (only alternated with phases of nonequipoise during the last part). Later commentators broke down this single sequence in different ways into different phases. Note that the explicit division of crossing in one leap into lesser, medium, and great is not mentioned in either the siitras or any Indian commentaries, but only in certain Tibetan commentaries. For more models of lion's sport and crossing in one leap, see Brunnholzl2011, Chart 23. 1284 Pp. 378-79. 1285 MCG, fols. 139b.5-140b.5; MPZL, pp. 165-67. 1286 MCG (fol. 140a.4) says that one can enter the first state of mind of the desire realm of great crossing in one leap after having risen from either the preceding meditative absorption of cessation or the slight exiting into the Peak of Existence. 1287 For a more detailed bibliography, see Brunnholzl2011."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"• • • • • • • • • Selected Bibliography287 Canonical Texts Abhayakaragupta.
