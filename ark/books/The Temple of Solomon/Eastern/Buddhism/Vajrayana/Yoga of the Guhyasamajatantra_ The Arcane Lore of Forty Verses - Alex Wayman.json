Emeneau, Who set the standard difficult to sustain"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PREFACEThe work here presented to the public is an organization of materials from the Guhyasamäjatantra cycle, stressing the aspect oi yoga, with sufficient introductory treatments to enable the reader to place this remarkable literature within the general frame of Indian thought and religious practice, which has already made world-wide contributions to the theory of.yoga.The set of forty verses was memorized for centuries by follo­wers of the ‘Arya’ Guhyasamdja tradition, which claims that these verses explain the entire ( Guhyasamäja) Tantra. I made up a title, the 'Guhyasamdja-niddna-kdrika*, for those verses(kdrikd) which go with each syllable of the initial sentence (niddna) of the Guhyasamäjatantra. The verses stem from the Explanatory Tantra Vajramdld, and were extant in the origi­nal Sanskrit by reason of being cited in the Pradlpoddyotana manuscript.As the synthetic commentary 011 the verses became increas­ingly technical, considerable introductory material was indi­cated; and this grew to three introductions before I was satisfied with the standard of clarification. Thus the reader lias a bridge to the verses, which in turn have been sufficiently annotated to bring out their individual character.Having long ago become aware of the hazards of speculating on the intricate subject of the Tantra, I have tried at every point to bring forward the authentic and reliable passages, whether in Sanskrit or Tibetan. But I do not deny my own contribution of selecting, translating, and organizing this mate­rial ; and especially the decision to group the forty verses accord­ing to the steps of yoga.Since most of the material in this book has not hitherto appeared in Western sources, certainly as far as English is con­cerned, I have preferred to give the original passages. However, I have omitted the Tibetan for Tsoh-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrcl on the forty verses, because the interlinear form of this annotation renders it difficult to cite separately; and there are some other omissions of Tibetan. The reader will soon notice my over­whelming use of Tson-kha-pa’s works. His writing is like the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"viliPREFACEpersonal message of a guru, for it is always to explain, not to conceal. The Tibetan chronicle called The Blue Annals has a most eloquent tribute to Tsoh-kha-pa for his authoritative works on the Guhyasamdja system.The concluded research is the outcome of a long-time aspi­ration. My original delving into the major theories is found in my first major published article, “Notes on the Sanskrit term Jhana” (1955). Already I knew about the forty verses and that they are quoted in the Pradipoddyotana because they are mentioned in an important context in Mkkas grub rje's Funda­mentals of the Buddhist Tantras; the late Professor F.D. Lessing and myself collaborated on a translation of tnis Tibetan book during the 1950’s even though it was not published until 1968. I realized that to do anything scholarly with the forty verses I would have to obtain the original Sanskrit, which was pre­sumably in the Pradipoddyotana manuscript of the Bihar Research Society. During my faculty research in India from February 1963 to January 1964, sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, it became part of a wonderful memory of 1963 Divali days in Patna that the Bihar Research Society in con­junction with the K.P. Jayaswal Institute graciously arranged for me to secure an enlargement of the Pradipoddyotana manuscript, for which I am most grateful. t)n December 24, 1963, the author was granted an interview with the Dalai Lama at Dharamsala (Punjab, India) during which His Holiness ex­pressed delight to learn that the forty ‘revelation’ ' verses explaining the initial sentence of the Guhyasamdja were extant in that unique manuscript. He mentioned a Tibetan tradition that there had been an Indian commentary on these forty verses not translated into the Tibetan language, and asked to be in­formed if such a Sanskrit commentary were to turn up. It is a special pleasure of this research that the present modest incursion into the vast Guhyasamdja lore leads to the publication in India of tbis commentary on the nidana verses, which thus becomes an ‘Indian commentary’ in a sense. If an old Sanskrit commen­tary ever turns up, the contents should overlap, but the fact that the data has been sifted through a Western consciousness will have brought many changes of outer form.Upon returning to my position of those days in Madison, Wisconsin, with the help of the Tibetan version I edited the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PREFACEixforty verses in Sanskrit, which along with the Tibetan and English translations, heads the ‘Documents’. As time went on, I collected materials for a synthetic commentary, on which account I must pay tribute to the remarkably convenient Japanese photographic edition of the Peking Kanjur-Tanjur and of Tson-kha-pa’s collected works, all of which has contributed so much to this endeavor. The early integrat­ing labor was pursued in part-time research in the Fall of 1965 supported by Ford Area funds of The University of Wisconsin; and I tried out some of the subject matter in my seminars on tantric Buddhism at Madison in Spring 1966 and at Columbia (as a visitor) in Fall 1966. In Summer 1966, I put together a manuscript that had considerable information on the subject, The Department of Indian Studies in Madison kindly afforded me secretarial assistance for typing up these technical materials. During the next academic year I decided to include even more new data while publishing such a book. During the Summer 1967 in a special teaching and research arrangement by my department in Madison, I selected from the photographic edition of the Tibetan canon a great amount of works or portions of works dealing with these and kindred topics. My assistant, Mr. Kio Kanda, duplicated all those pages on the excellent machine of the University-Industry Research Program in Madison by the cooperation of the ladies in that office. This provided me maximum ease of consulting texts as desired. In my new position at Columbia University starting in Fall 1967 I found some leisure from time to time for perusing more of the relevant texts, and for making more use of the Pradipoddyotana manuscript, which however, is only of interest to me for completing this book. The sabbatical year (1969-70) allowed me by Columbia University afforded me some leisure for further improvements and corrections. I am confident that the delays have considerably strengthened the contribution to knowledge of this tantric system, and that any future investigator of this or associated Buddhist tantric litera­ture will find in this a rich reference work.An important observation of comparing the basic text of the Guhyasamajatanlra with its commentaries, and in particular, with the kind of ideas found in the forty verses and their annota­tion, is that the commentarial literature brings forth an array"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"XPREFACEof data that is not at all apparent in the basic Tantra. This observation leads to the surprising conclusion that one cannot evaluate the Guhyasamajatantra in its edited Sanskrit form simply by reading it, which is the premise of the modern-day condem­nation of the Tantra. Adding to the difficulty is the loss in original Sanskrit of most of the commentarial works; which, fortunately, are almost all available in fine Tibetan translations. But few specialists are prepared to exploit these Tibetan works. For example, the only published paper that I know of as employ­ing Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel to any extent is Giuseppe Tucci’s “ Some glosses upon the GuhyasamajaTucci also explored the Guhyasamaja manéala in his Indo-Tibelica and in his work translated into English under the title The Theory and Practice of the Mandala. Without any reflection on those pre­vious efforts, it still follows that the subject of the Guhyasamaja has an importance deserving its own book. I believe it fair to say that the very effort of integrating materials from the vast sources has brought this system into a focus not hitherto possible with those—other than Professor Tucci—who only brushed against it in the dark and then praised or blamed.It is a pleasure to 'recall the helpful conversations with Dr. Rasik Vihari Joshi about some of the Sanskrit verses included in this book.An explanation is due the readers who expected this work to appear some years ago, since it was submitted to a publisher in South India late in 1960. Through no fault of that publisher but only of troubles in his city, it was finally necessary to resubmit it to the present publisher. I am indeed grateful to Shree N. P. Jain of Motilal Banarsidass to have undertaken this work and given it a speedy processing. However, those who appre­ciate the appendixes should thank the publishing delay. Also, in the meantime Samuel Weiser, Inc. of New York, published another work of mine on the Buddhist Tantras, with materials mostly different from the content of the present work , just as this one is so different from Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras. This should point attention to the almost inexhaustible character of the Buddhist Tantras.'New York City July 1977Alex Wavman"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"C O N T E N T SPREFACE viiPART ONE : DOCUMENTS 1I.

This was always the initial step in the traditional understanding of Buddhism, pursuant to the ‘three instructions’ (éik$á-traya), ‘insight consisting of hearing’, ‘i nsight consisting of contemplation,’ ‘insight consisting of cultivation (or putting into practice)’. That is to say, Buddhism always acknowledged a kind of ‘insight’ (prajnd) for the elementary step of exposure to the text when it was accompanied by devotion even if necessitating personal dis­comfort. The subsequent introductions, annotation of the forty verses, and appendices, all represent the ‘pondering’ level for this study.While the documents provide the most elementary level of ‘insight’, the form in which they are exhibited here has some advantage over their service to the reader of edited Sanskrit texts. In particular, a number of corrections have been made to the Sanskrit text of Chapters Six and Twelve, Guhyasamája­tantrai, prior to their translation. Again, a portion of the Pradi- poddyotana commentary on Chapter Twelve is presented from an unedited work, and the same holds for the forty verses them­selves, here edited in Sanskrit. Also, the translations of die two chapters and the extract of comment on Chapter Twelve have been slightly expanded by the use of commentarial and subcommentarial materials, mainly available in Tibetan. Of course, the theory of ‘insight consisting of hearing’ takes for granted that the text itself is correct. Thus considerable care has been taken with the Documents to meet this condition laid down for ‘insight’.I. The Guhyasamája-nidána-káriká (Sanskrit - Tibetan- English). This section of the ‘documents’ exhibits samples of the languages employed: Sanskrit and Tibetan for research purposes , and English for translation and communication purposes."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The nidana is the formula at the outset of the Guhyasa- majatantra : Evam maya srutam ekasmin samaye bhagavansarvatathagatakayavakcittahrdaya-vajrayosidbhagesu vijahara. The word nidana is being employed in the sense of ‘primary cause’, that is to say, the cause of the entire Guhyasamajatantra. The forty syllables of that formula serve mnemonic purpose as initials of forty verses (karikd) : (1) E, (2) vam, (3) ma,(4) ya, (5) sru, (6) tarn, (7) e, (8) ka, (9) smin, (10) sa,(11) ma, (12) ye, (13) bha, (14) ga, (15) van, (16) sa, (17)rva, (18) ta, (19) tha, (20) ga, (21) ta, (22) ka, (23) ya,(24) vak, (25) cit, (26) ta, (27) hr, (28) da, (29) ya, (30)va, (31) jra, (32) yo, (33) sid, (34) bha, (35) ge, (36) su, (37 ) vi, (38) ja, (39) ha, (40) ra.The original Sanskrit of the forty verses is here edited from the Pradipoddyotana manuscript, the Tibetan translation from the Derge Tanjur edition of the Pradipoddyotana and from the version of the Tantra Vajramdla in the Peking Tibetan Tripifaka edition. There are relatively few textual problems. The Sanskrit manuscript gives the syllables ci and tta for nidana verses 25 and 26, but I followed the Tibetan phonetic transcrip­tion, since cit and ta correspond more closely to the initial words of the Sanskrit verses. Nidana verse 20 has a defective pada in the manuscript, gacchaty indriyas tat tat. But the scribe had erased a syllable, leading to my solution : gacchann asty indriyas tat tat. The correction gacchann asty is justified by the Tibetan equivalence hgro bar hgyur ba.The Tibetan text here presented follows the Vajramald except for some obvious corruptions remedied with the Pradipoddyotana version. The translatipn snail ba gsal ba is the old one for nidana verse 4’s alokdbhdsa; the standard translation is snail ba mched pa.2 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTJRA"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"DOCUMENTS3q I H e ft 5T5TT f% TTH Tf?5TC!TTf?H ^>T Ifwfftf?Gi II [1]tff| £r^*r*,q'*^rq*^| |^ • q * ^ q - < y u f c * r . ^ r q | j“ E” is the Noble woman (sati) Prajna, the moments of aversion, and so on.

Chapters VI and X II of the Guhyasamdjatanlra, translated into English.These two chapters are selected for translation because they are the most important in terms of commentarial literature for stating explicitly the steps of yoga underlying the entire Guhyasamaja t antra.The portions of the two chapters which especially apply to steps of yoga are repeated with explanations in Part Two (III. Introduction to the Yoga of the Guhyasamaja system). Here we may say by way of introduction that the two stages, Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion, are represented by verse blocks in both chapters, while other blocks may go with both stages. In Chapter Six, verses 3-5 belong to the Stage of Completion, verses 6-14 represent the pranayama of the Stage of Generation, and 15-18 show the advancement to the pranayama of the Stage of Completion. In the case of Chapter Twelve thePradipoddyotana, inaugurating its commentary on verse BO in that chapter says : “Having taught the mundane slddhi by way of the deeds of the yogin belonging to the ‘Stage of Generation5, now in order to teach the means of accomplishing the siddhi of mahanmdra of those situated in the ‘Stage of Com­pletion5, there are the words 'vajrasamaya* and so on (of verse 50). Presumably these ‘Stage of Completion5 verses continue through 59. Then verses 60-63 show the steps of achieving those siddhis of the ‘Stage of Generation5; while the verse 64 (on which Candrakirti has the long commentary which is edited in the next section) is understood to allude to the steps of achieving the siddhis of the ‘Stage of Completion5. The subse­quent verses can be understood to indicate both stages, by use of the four expressions of sadhana (elucidated in Part Two) which can be construed as the ‘shared5 (sadharana) terminology of the two stages.The translations are made from the Bhattacharyva edition of the Tantra with the verse numbering in Dr. S. Bagchi’s edition, and with some minimum expansion based on Candra- klrti5s Pradipoddyotana commentary in the Tibetan edition with Tsori-kha-pa5s tippani (Mchan hgn-l) thereon.

Contem­plating through equality (of oneself) with the three vajra bodies (of Vajradhara), he reaches success.(67) The wise man, having contemplated with the know­ledge diamond of reciting Om, that is, by union with the four temporal junctures ( = the four goddesses) in five places (=the distinguished kind of the five sense objects), engages in the vow .( = bliss).(68) The siddhi is easily attained when one relies on the vajrasamaya (the Clear Light in sense objects) for seven days"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"DOCUMENTS35(by one of superior organs), half a month (medium, organ), a month or a half more (inferior organ).(69) I have explained extensively by stressing the difference of days (for accomplishing siddhi in the Stage of Generation) ; {now) the siddhi that takes a half-month (the Mahâmudrâ) is stated by sources (the Tathàgatas) of the high secret (the Clear Light).Herein is the domain of the Upasàdhana-vow :(70-71) May the glorious holder of Buddha Body contem­plated as the inseparable triple vajra, create for me today the place of blessing by way of the Diamond-holder of Body (Vairocana).

Edited Pradipoddyotana commentary on Chapter X II, 60-64, and English translation.This portion of Candraklrli’s commentary is devoted to defining the four steps of sàdhana constituting the ‘Stage of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAGeneration5 and then to explaining in detail the six members of yoga ($adanga-yoga) constituting the ‘Stage5 of Completion5. The part of the commentary on the six members of yoga is almost the same as is found in a work attributed to Nagarjuna, the fadangayoga-nama (PTT, Vol. 85). Therefore, this comment by Candrakirti may well have been a traditional commentary on the six members. At the end of the work ascribed to Nagar­juna (meaning of course the tantric author), there is presented the lineage of the fadahgayoga of the Guhyasamaja: “Buddha Vajradhara; Arya-Nagarjuna; Nagabodhi; Candrakirti; Arya- deva; Sakyaraksita; Ratnamitra; Dharmabhadra; Gunamati; ManjuSrijnana; Amoghairl; V iram ati; Vijayaklrti; Varaprajfia- dharmabhadra; Sribhadra; Dharmapala; Sakyadhvaja; Vagi£- varakirti; Ratnakirti; M ahasthavara; Srivanaratna; those are the chief ones. Also, from Srlvanaratna to (the Tibetan) Gnam-gah-rin-po-che; the chief one is Dharmabuddhi.55 However, the Karmdntavibhaga cited within the comment is by Kluhi bio (*Nagabuddhi) who might be the same person as the Nagabodhi in the above lineage list.Here I omit the verse numbers assigned in Bagchi5s edition to the block of verses which Candrakirti cites from the Guhyasamaja, Chap. X V III. Candrakirti does not include the verse line (Bagchi, X V III, 144A) : guhyatanlrefu sarve$u vividhah parikirtitah; and the verse grouping thereafter diverges from the edited Sanskrit text. Otherwise, Candrakirti5s citation of the verses agrees for the most part with the edited text. But hi$ line guhyatrayarp vitarkai ca vicar as tatprabhogatah appears to be an improvement over the line guhyarji tarkodayarp tarkaip vicdraip tat prayogatah (Bagchi, X V III, 144B). Naropa5s Sekoddeia\\ika (p. 30), when quoting the block of verses from Chap. X V III, gives the line guhyairayodayas tarko vicar as tatprayogata, which at least verifies the reading guhyatraya.The translation is somewhat expanded by extracts within parentheses of Mchan hgrel

Pursuant to that, the undertaking and generation of the (diamond) spot of earth, etc. (generation of the palace from BHRUM, up to the Clear Light of conviction) is the ‘occupation with the pledge of service5 (sevdsamayasamyoga), the first member.Having (in that way) voidness as meditative object, the meditative object of sun, and so on, is Near Evocation (upasd- dhana). Precisely the bringing to conclusion the depositing (in the body) of mantras (Orp, etc.) is the arising of Near Evo­cation (upasddhana-sambhava), the second (member).Concerning ‘the aim of the sâdhana, and the symbol5 {sddhandrtham ca samayam), the aim of the sddhana means to solicit for establishing the evocation (of one5s own three doors as the Buddha's Body, Speech, and M ind). ‘Symbol5 (samaya) means ‘to get together5, i.e. the symbol (one's own Symbolic Being), along with the Samâdhisattva and the Jhânasattva, toDOCUMENTS 41"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"4 2YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAwit, both the aim of the sadhana and the symbol are the third (member).The accomplishment of the great aim of others, (accom­plishment) which is the ‘best victorious m andala5 and the ‘best victorious rite’ belonging to the remaining conclusion, is the Great Evocation {mahasadhana). That is the fourth (member).Having thus understood the four members as a division of vajra, i.e. as a division of ‘family5 (kula) (the five families), then, i.e. next, one should accomplish the rites to be stated subsequently precisely as the first.(The fiist member :) Starting with the lines ‘Sevasamadhi..., he expands upon the (four) members which were touched upon. The bodhicitta (in the void) as meditative object is service (seva). Precisely that concentrates, i.e. halts in the mind, hence ‘samadhi*. Praxis (samyoga) means right appli­cation. That (imaginative) generation, by means of convic­tion (adhijnakti), from the (diamond) spot of earth, etc. up to the ;nandala-dircle, which is both the service-samadhi and the praxis, is the sevasamadhi samyoga. Having done that (much), he should contemplate the supreme revelation, possessing the character of thusness, which has arisen from pondering the meaning of the mantra, ‘OmSunyata.(The second member:) (Then,) in the sequence of sun* moon, lotus, etc., one stacks successively higher, places the three syllables (a, o, fia) upon that; then consolidates all that, and again imagines the moon-disk, and upon that the three syllables (Om, Ah, Hum). Then from the transformation of that, there arise the hand symbol (s) (of the six families). From the transformation of the hand symbol (s), there are completed the form(s) of M aham udra (of the six families). W hat accomplishes and completes nearby, that is said to be (definition of) Near Evocation {upasadhana). The siddhi is the siddhi of mahamudra (body from the five abhisarjibodhis). Its ‘foremost5 is the initial ones, the mantras Om, etc. When that is present, the Near Evocation is foremost. Having placed all the mantra-syllables, there are the form(s) of the M aha­mudra.

Their cases (ayatana) are the skandhas of form, etc."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"DOCUMENTS43-(The third member :) O f those (members), one becomes certain by the stage of the third series (the Atiyoga) and accomplishes through pondering with thorough knowledge of cause (the placement of deities in the body) and fruit (of con­templating after that placement). Whereby (by inviting the deity host of the triple vajra and drawing them into oneself) one has pleased (the deities) for the sake of blessing (one’s own three doors), thereby that ‘is said to be the exhortation when there is evocation.’ That is related by way of synonym (of evocation and exhortation)* But why (the exhortation) ? The two verses (Nos. 70-71) beginning ‘buddhakayadhara'. The ‘contemplation of the lords of the mantras’ refers to the syllables Om, etc. (i.e. when Vajradhara and Aksobhya are the mandala-rulers, H um ; and the remaining four samadhi- sattvas by Om, Sva, Ah, H a). The Samadhisattvas are the lords; the Jnanasattvas belong to the lords of the mantras. The meditation on the various families according to their arising is the ‘contemplation of the lords of the mantras.’(The fourth member :) Regarding ‘the great evocation (M ahasadhana). what is pointed out as the great evocation, belongs to the jnanavajrin-s at the time of generating it. The mantrins possessing the yoga of presiding deity, having aroused samdpatli preceded by instigation of the vajra and padma (of their own family), are their own mantras Vajradrg, etc. (32 in no.), i.e. the vajrin-s arisen therefrom (i.e. as in a womb from the syllables Om, etc.). To have imagined their totality as the form of M ahamudra (of the Victorious M andala), is stated as ‘having imagined the lord on the crown of his head’, that is, having imagined the lord Mahavajradhara on the crown and twisted hair of the M ahamudra form of the five Tathagatas, and (having imagined) Vairocana and the other Buddhas on the remaining crowns of their family deities (Locana, etc.),. one is successful, i.e. attains siddhi. yatharutam /The Stage of Completion :„Having thus explained the delighting of Vajrasattva (for the purpose of mundane siddhis) by the stages of four yogas (but with no treatment of ‘Victory of the Rite, which belongs to.M ahasadhana), now (idanim) he alludes to the completion"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"4 4YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAof M ahavajradhara by the stages of six members in the Uttara- tantra (Chap.

X II, 64 :One should create, everywhere and always, just with the knowledge nectar of service. For this brings to success the aim of mantra and of tattva, of all mantras. )As to the words, ‘One should create just with the know­ledge nectar of service5, and so on, “One serves, having been studying with desire for liberation (the highest siddhi)55, is (the definition of) ‘service5 (seva). And why (the desired liberation) ? The (yuganaddha) body of deity completely pure (of the two obscurations). That is to be created, i.e. completed, just with the knowledge nectar of service, i.e. just with the six-membered yoga. ‘Everywhere5 means in the nature of all. ‘Always5 means (those six) at all times and in all good postures. The expression ‘jhst5 (eva) is in the sense of restriction (to the particular instance). ‘For this5 (e$o hi) refers to the knowledge nectar, i.e. the six-membered yoga. ‘O f all mantras5 means ‘of all Tathagatas5. ‘M antras5 are SARPA (‘serpent5) and so on (diamond muttering of both neydrtha and nitartha mantras). ‘Reality5 (tattva) means the god reality (of ultimate yuganaddha). Their aim (artha) is the fruit (phala). By accomplishing that (fruit, by means of the six members) one accomplishes the reality aim for the mantra. ‘For5, means wherefore in the sense of aim. For the reason the six-membered yoga is that way, for that reason the service is to create just with that (yoga).Those six members, pratyahara, etc. are set forth in the Uttara-tautra of the Guhyasamaja'.When one does the service with the six-membered yoga, lie wins the supreme success. In no other way does the supreme siddhi arise.Pratyahara, dhyana, pranayama, dharana, anusmrti, and samadhi, are the six members.He expands upon those brief indications as follows (Chap."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"DOCUMENTS45X V III, verses 141, fF. in Bagchi’s numbering):The dwelling upon interiorization of the ten sense bases on all levels severally directed toward the taking of desires, is called Withdrawal (pratyáhára). The five desires are in condensation through the application to the five Buddhas. Meditation (dhyána) is said to be imagination. And that Meditation is fivefold: Primary Conception (vitarka)is the secret triad, from the enjoyment of which comes Secondary Conception (vicára). The vicinity of joy is the third, and the sum of pleasure is the fourth. O ne’s own consciousness with removal of the upsurge of knowledge and knowables, is known as the fifth, with a peace composed of all Buddhas and abiding in all desires. Drawing forth the breath made of five knowledges and which is the self-existence of the five elements, one should imagine it in the form of a tiny ball on the tip of the lotus nose.The great jewel of five colors is said to be pránáyáma. Having meditated on one’s own mantra in the heart, one should place the-prána in its bindu form.When one’s sense organ and the jewel have ceased (to operate) one should retain. (That is) called Retention (dhdrana). When consciousness goes toward the diamond of cessation, the apprehension of signs arises.Those signs have been explained by the diamond of enlightenment as fivefold. The first has the aspect of a mirage, the second the aspect of smoke. The third has the aspect of fire-flies, the fourth shines like a lamp, and the fifth is a steady light like a cloudless sky.One should radiate that firm thing by the vajra path into the regions of the sky. Contemplating which, by Recol­lection (anusmrti) one should radiate those aspects. One should know about Recollection that there is the shining appearance, and that it (Recollection) is engendered therein.Having drawn together by the equipoise of insight and means all states in condensation by the yoga of the small ball, one should contemplate the image in their middle.

The ‘interiorization’ (svavrtti) is of those ten sense bases which are the sense objects and the senses grasping them, to wit : accord­ing to the engagement with the intrinsic feature of the individual apprehended object and apprehending organ, there isinteriori- zation. The abiding in that, is the dwelling upon interiorization. ‘On all levels’ means according to the distinctions of inferior, middling, and best (for each sense object), that is, ‘severally directed toward the taking of desires’. ‘Desires’ according to the passage, “They desire and are attached to” , are form, and so on (the five sense objects). ‘Severally directed’, i.e. again and again, toward that taking, i.e. apperception, of those (sense objects) by the sense organs, their apperception is the ‘taking’. That is the detailed explanation of the initial member (which is the arcane body of purification‘afterwards obtained’). With the aim of purifying the Withdrawal, he states the second member with the verse ‘the five’ and so on. ‘The five desires’ are the sense bases of form, etc., i.e. the (five) sense objects. ‘In condensation’ means by unification (of the sense objects) with the sense organs. The ‘five Buddhas’ are the eye and other sense organs. The right conjunction of them (to their respective Buddha,Aksobhya, etc.) is the conjunction ‘through the application to the five Buddhas’. As a result, form and so on, are (also) those five Buddhas. In that fashion (of conjunction), whatever is the imagination purified (of ordinary appearance) is the ‘M editation’. That becomes fivefold by the division into ‘Primary Conception’ and so on. The verse ‘Primary Conception’ and so on, has the setting forth of its division. As to the verse ‘the secret triad’ and so on, the sense organ, the sense object, and the knowledge based on the sense, are the secret triad. The (rough) imagination that the five sense organs, the (five) knowledges based on the senses, and their sense objects have the nature of the five Tatha- gatas, is Primary Conception. The deliberating (in detail) just on that, is Secondary Conception in location (those two are also arcane body of purification ‘afterwards obtained’).

What has attained the pleasure possessing the characteristic of body-cathartic and so on (the mind-cathartic), through adherence to reality, that is the sum of pleasure (sukha-samgraha). The one who thus has applied himself repeatedly so as to go to the pinnacle of excellence, has the removal of upsurge of knowledge and knowables, where the upsurge of knowledge is the six evolve- ments as eye, and so on, of perception (vijnana), and where the upsurge in the knowables is in (the six) from form up to the dharmadhaiu (which is the object of the sixth ‘sense’); and where its removal is called ‘one’s own consciousness’ (svacitta) as the voidness in consciousness of both apperceived and apper­ception,and as the one-pointedness of mind with the characteri­stic of complete knowledge.4 One’s own consciousness’ of such fashion by reason of yoga is ‘with a peace composed of all Buddhas’. The ‘Peace’ is through pacifying the discursive thought of the apperceived and so on. It is engendered (by successive dissolution of the three voids) as light-only and the ultimate that is one with universal void (the fourth void, the Symbolic Clear Light). That is the fivefold division of the second member.Regarding the verse ‘five’ and so on, the downward breath has the intrinsic nature of the five knowledges, beginning with mirror-like, and is the individualizing factor of earth (and the other elements). Drawing it forth from the nostril of one’s vajra, one should imagine it in the form of a tiny ball, i.e. in the form of the bodhicitta-bindu, on the tip of the lotus-nose (of the sacral place). Precisely that is the breath proceeding upward with five colors, the nature of the five Tathagatas. Precisely that is the ‘great jewel’ (the ‘drop of light’ at the nose of the face, and which is recited). ‘Prana’ is what envigorates; ‘ayama’ is that by which it is spread far;— thus the explanation of prjinayama to be known, because one should recite during day and night by way of the own-nature of making that (pranayama) enter and so on. ‘Having meditated on one’s own mantra (drop) in the heart’, i.e. at (the nose of) the lotus (8-petalled) of one’s heart, ‘one should place’ (nyaset) ‘the Prana in its bindu form’ (the letter A, etc.) deposited, invio­lable (ak$ata).

Why that? The True Limit (the gnosis of the Clear Light). (The verse states) “When consciousness goes toward the diamond of cessation, the apprehension of signs arises.” The ‘diamond of cessation’ is the Clear Light (prabhasvara). When conscious­ness has gone to it, it is born in it. The apprehension of signs i.e. the manifestation of signs arises, i.e. occurs (as prior signs). Regarding the passage, the signs of the five realms have been explained by the diamond of enlightenment (the details are as follows) : Through dissolution into water by earth (in the performer’s body), theaspect of a mirage mani­fests—the first sign. Through the dissolution into fire on the part of water, the aspect of smoke—the second. Through the dissolution into wind of fire, the aspect of fire-flies—the third. Through the going into the three lights on the part of the subtle element (i.e. wind), the self-existence of the set of lights like a lamp—the fourth. Through the (sequential) dissolution of the (three) prakrti-light(s), there is only the Clear Light, a lasting light like a .cloudless sky— the fifth. Those five signs bring (consciousness) to Nirvana, as is said in the Karmantavibhaga : “First, earth goes into water. W ater goes into fire. Fire passes into wind. Wind enters perception (vijfiana).

Tantra (generalities)W h a t is an introduction to the ideas and practices of the Buddhist Tantras ? Let me allude to the leading literature on the subject. It is well known that S. B. Dasgupta wrote a book entitled An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism (University of Calcutta, 1950). This has certainly been a helpful book for persons interested in the Buddhist Tantras. The Japanese scholars appreciated it especially since the kinds of Tantras which had been continued in Japan were of a quite different character from the works consulted by S. B. Dasgupta, and those scholars were also interested in the philosophical tenets which Dasgupta found in the tantric manuscripts which he consulted. It must also be admitted that Dasgupta was himself attracted to certain features of the manuscripts which he con­sulted, such as verses about the cakras (mystic centers) in the body, and the special way in which the male and female are regarded, suggestive of being compared with the Sakta move­ments that have been strong in Bengal. All the material which he brought forward is indeed authoritative data from those texts. Naturally he did not thoroughly represent the works he consulted; and besides they are replete with ritual details that are often tedious. Benoytosh Bhattacharyya made giant strides in opening up this subject by his various text editions; and of course he was well prepared to explain elements of the system, which he did in various publications with sympathy. I have frequently recommended to my students to consult G. Tucci’s Tibetan Painted Scrolls for its Vajrayana chapter; but this is an expensive work of restricted distribution. Then the late Professor F. D. Lessing of Berkeley and myself collaborated in the translation from Tibetan of the work now published (1968) as Mkhas grub fe's Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras. In conversations I have freely admitted that this is not an intro­duction for Westerners as it was for Tibetans, even though it"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"52YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRApresents the fundamentals of the four Tantra literature divisions with a considerable and convenient fund of information not hitherto available in any Western language. To answer the question posed above, an introduction should show what the Tantra is all about, the underlying suppositions, the leading instructions, to the extent of recreating the Tantra as a viable entity to be liked or disliked. The trouble with so much of the present writing on the Tantra is that the reader is, or should be, left with a feeling of distancy or bewilderment; he is neither genuinely for or against it, because he does not understand it. It is on this point that one can praise S. B. Dasgupta’s work: he was not simply reproducing citations from texts; he tried to explain as he went along. But he could only explain when his own background allowed him, namely when these Buddhist Tantras overlapped the Hinduism with which he had a natural knowledge through his birthright and training.Now, what is the relation of the Buddhist Tantra to Hinduism ? This is hardly a one-directional influence. In fact, the Buddhist Tantra goes back in many of its leading ideas to the Brahmanism of the older Upanisads, and some of its ritual (e.g. the homai or burnt offering) can be traced to old Vedic rites. In short, the Buddhist Tantra incorporated a large amount of the mystical ideas and practices that have been current in India from most ancient times, and preserved them just as did the Hindu Tantra in its own way, while both systems had mutual influence and their own deviations. The Buddhist Tantra is deeply indebted to certain later Upanisads such as the Yoga Upanisads, which were probably composed in the main form about 1 st century b. g. to the beginning of the Gupta period, and which are a primitive kind of Hinduism. But these my­stical practices were so thoroughly integrated with Buddhist dogma, that it is a most difficult matter to separate out the various sources of the Buddhist Tantra.Then, with regard to the chronology, it is not my original idea to put the revealed Buddhist Tantras in the period of 4th and 5th centuries, a. d. (B. Bhattacharyya maintained such an early date for the Guhyasamdjatantra). This certainly requiresjustification, and in the section Tntroduction to the Guhyasa- majatantra7 I shall present some arguments in its case. For the others I shall simply assert that there is no where else in Indian"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM53chronology to put the bulk of them: exactly in the same period which was the creative period of Hinduism and which cast the mold for the forms of Indian religion in the subsequent centuries. There are some notable exceptions just as there are for Hin­duism; and in the case of the Buddhist Tantra certainly the expanded Kalacakratantra was composed much later. The Tantric revelations were kept in esoteric cults—for there must have been a tension between the orthodox Buddhist sects and these far-out tantric groups. This strict secrecy was continued up to around the 8th century when commentaries by named persons appear. Those commentaries continue through the 12th century, more and more coloring the public forms of Buddhism in its last Indian phase. However, we must look to other reasons for the disappearance of Buddhism; after all, the Hindus themselves are fond of Tantra and this has not caused Hinduism to disappear !These tantric cults were introduced into China from India during the T ’ang Dynasty but did not take root until the 8th century which saw the activity of the Indian masters Vajra- bodhi and Amoghavajra (cf. Chou Yi-liang, Tantrism in China), The kind of Buddhist Tantras which prevailed in China gave rise to the two forms of Buddhist mysticism in Japan— the form handed down by the Tendai school (in which the Tantra is one of the topics of study) and that handed down by the Shingon School (in which the Tantra is the main thing). Buddhist Tantrism called the Diamond Vehicle, was brought to completion in Japan by Kobo Daishi, founder of the Shingon. Japanese Tantrism is especially based on the works called the Mahavairocanasutra, also known as the Vairocanabhisambodhi (which yields the ‘Garbha-mandala’) and the Tattvasamgraha (referred to in Japan as “Tip of the Thunderbolt” which yields the ‘Vajramandala’). Forms of Tantra were also introduced and once apparently flourished in what is now called Java, where as Paul Mus has shown, the five levels of Borobudur symbolise the five Buddhas. But more than anywhere else the Buddhist Tantras came to flower in Tibet, starting with their implantation in the 8th century by the teachers Padmasambhava and ¿aruaraksita. After the cessation of composition in Sanskrit of the commentaries, they continued in the Tibetan language in cm enormous literature."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"5 4YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJAT ANTRAThere are serious problems in studying the Tantric litera­ture. Because of the syncretic and deliberately mystifying nature of such texts as the Guhyasamdjatantra> their sentences, although relatively simple in language complexity, continually need the guru’s oral expansion and authoritative commentary. The problem is not with the individual words, which indeed mean what they ought; but rather in the fact that so many words, besides meaning what they ought, are employed in a range, of acceptable usages and then intend other senses in arbitrary analogical systems. Again, these texts are essentially practical, are concerned with doing things such as rites. And recipe books, even on the mundane level, are notorious for requiring a teacher to tell the missing steps. Then, in the case of the Tantras, the gurus have taken vows not to reveal the Tantras to the uninitiated (‘immature’) persons, and so the difficulty is compounded, even for those persons who are initia­ted. The style of writing is conducive to corruptions in the texts, certainly a fault in manuscripts of the Guhyasamdjatatitra.It is understandable that the numerous difficulties of the literature might result in some unwarranted judgments. In fact, eminent authorities of the Tantras during their India period had disagreements with each other, and later investi­gators, such as the Tibetan gurus, decided that certain earlier authorities had misunderstood this or that important point. Therefore, it is right for us to be charitable in the event of seeming misinterpretations; but still they should be pointed out. In illustration, some questionable terms have been applied to the Buddhist Tantras. (1) There-is no expression ‘Dhyani Buddhas’ in the texts; one finds instead the words Tathagata, Buddha or Jina, as in the compound pancatathagata (‘five Tathagatas’), (2) There is no terminology ‘right and left hand paths’ in the Buddhist Tantras, and no classification of the Tantras on that basis, insofar as classification by the tan- trics themselves is concerned. The standard classification is into four classes, Kriya-tantra, Carya-tantra, Yoga-tantra. and Anultarayoga-tantra. Of course, some Westerners may feel that certain Buddhist Tantras-such as the Guhy .samdjat antra teach practices which fit the category of ‘left hand path’ and there are statements in those Tantras which lend credence to such a theory. We should observe that the Hindu Tantras themselves use such terminology but in different wavs, as shown"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM55in Chintaharan Chakravarti’s work, The Tantra: Studies on their Religion and Literature. (3) The texts do not use the word sakti in the sense of the female consort power of a deity (of course, the word iakti can be and is used in the other meaning of a certain weapon). In the article, “Female Energy and Symbo­lism in the Buddhist Tantras” I gave the following list of generic words used for the goddesses or females in the class of Anuttara- yogatantra prajha (‘insight’), yogini (‘female yogin’), vidyd (‘occult science’ or ‘know how’), devi (‘goddess’ or ‘queen’), ma.tr (‘mother’), mdtrka (‘mother’ o r ‘letters’), ddkinl (‘fairy’), dull (‘female messenger’), §uri (‘heroine’), and mudra (‘seal’ or ‘gesture’). Of course, that use of the word ¿akti for the female consort of the Buddhist Tantras implies that this is what the tantrics mean by their consort. Later on, various scholars (S. B. Dasgupta especially) protested against the use of the word on the grounds that in these Buddhist Tantras, the ‘prajna’ (one of the most frequent of the words) is passive, not active like the Saivitic sakti. That is one reason for my writing that article “Female Energy. .”, because when one goes into the texts he will find for the usage of the word prajild that in the ordinary person who does not control his mind this is indeed a passive function, while the aim of the Buddhist praxis is to arouse the fiery potentiality of this function. How is it aroused ? The Mahavairocanasutra has a celebrated verse about this matter, and which is correlated with mantra steps in the Shingon sect. Fortunately it is in Sanskrit, as cited in Kamalasila’s (First) Bhdvanakrama (G. Tucci’s Minor 'Buddhist Texts, Part II, p. 196 : vairocanabhisambodhau coktam/tad etat sarvajnajfianam karunamulam bodhicittahetukam upaya- paryavasanam iti/ “And it is said in the Vairocanahhisambodhi : ‘(Master of secret folk). The omniscient knowledge has Compassion for a root, has the Mind of Enlightenment for a motive, and has the Means for a finality’.” In that passage ‘omniscient knowledge’ is equivalent to the Buddha’s Perfection of Insight (prajhapdramitd). Compassion provides this Insight with a root in the phenomenal world. The Mind of Enlighten­ment provides this Insight with a motive, the vow as cause. The Means provides this Insight with a finality, its fulfilment. At the first two levels, the Insight is still passive; it is with the Means that it appears in full flowering, its true active form."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"5 6 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAWhen Insight (prajiia) is combined with the Means (upaya), it is no longer passive. Therefore, while it is not strictly correct to call Prajna a sakti, the persons who applied this expression— and Benoytosh Bhattacharyya and Giuseppe Tucci had read widely in both Hindu and Buddhist Tantras—were closer to the truth than those who insist on the ‘passive’ interpretation.This general problem of explaining the Tantras is so crucial that it is germane to dwell upon it some more. Fortunately, there is a master who expressed himself on this very point, the 8lh century teacher Lllavajra, the teacher of Buddhas rijnana who heads one of the two lineages of Guhyasamaja interpre­tation. Lllavajra has written a commentary on the Sri-guhya- garbha-mahdtantraraja (the tikd-nama) (PTT, Vol. 82, pp. 248 and 249). He soon begins a section ‘Method of Explaining the Tantra’, which he says has three aims, in the sense of aims for the superior, intermediate, and inferior among candidates and sense organs. In the course of explaining for the aim of the superior candidate or sense organ, he includes that which is related to the form of meaning, which “has certainty about the reality of the guhyagarbha” bahi sniri po de kho na did nespaho), regarding the chief words in the title of the Tantra on which he is commenting. Then he states that there are three kinds of guhya and three kinds of garbha. The three of guhya (‘secret’)) are (1) of the self existent (ran bzhin=svabhava), (2) pregnant (sbas pa= garbhin), and (3) profound (gab pa=gam- bhira). In explanation of the first kind, that of the self existent, he cites the text:Aho ! The dharma which is the utmost secret is the in­trinsic secret (behind) diverse manifestation, highlysecret through self existence; than which there is nothing more secret !In summary of his commentary on this verse, it turns out that the utmost secret is the non-dual, self-originated Wisdom (jdajia), an effortless fount of good qualities while its own aspect is incognizable. It is an element located in the stream of consciousness (the samtdna or samtati), an incessant fountain of entities self appearing, but this element is obscured by dis­cursive thought; it is both cause and effect as both conscious­ness and the imagined objective domain; there is nothingmore central, and it appears through introspection (svasamve-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM57¿ana) but by reason of obscurations, men have sought it else­where. (This is certainly the ‘embryo of the Tathagata5 theory from one stream of non-tantric Buddhism). The second kind of secret is the ‘pregnant5, so called because it is like the woman impregnated by another and with the embryo growing in privacy. This secret is deliberately given or withheld by the guru, and concerns the secret practice of the Tantra. Lila- vajra says, “ If one practices by praxis according to the word (of the Tantra) but lacks the mantra-precepts, this is a grievous fault55 (shags kyi man hag med pa dan/sgra bzhin spyod pa rnams kyis spyad na/sin tu nes pa che bas/ ). The third kind, the profound, is the perfect meaning of the Tantra (rgyud kyi don phun sum tshogs pa)> and this is conferred by oneself through the twopramanas. He must mean Direct Perception (pratyakfa) and Inference (anumana). In summary of the three kinds of secret, the first of the self-existent is nature5s secret, the second of ‘pregnant5 is conferred by another, the third of profound is conferred by oneself. When we think over Lllavajra5s precepts, it strikes us that it is easy to be irrelevant about the Buddhist Tantra by treating as doctrine what in fact is a practice: as far as human secrecy is concerned, in Tantrism there is only ‘pre­gnant5 practice and profound doctrine. And that it is easy to go wrong by interpreting the literal words of the Tantra as the practice, while lacking the precepts of the guru which clarify what the practice should be. I have been told that this point is also stressed in the Shingon sect of Japan, and so this is a mat­ter independent of whether the passage in question has ‘sexual5 symbolism. Lately some persons have found only a sexo-yogic topic to set forth as characteristic of the Anuttarayoga-tantra, but Lllavajra informs us that the most important issue and aim of the Tantras is that element hidden in the stream of conscious­ness, obscured by discursive thought (which plagues us all). That man becomes interested in finding the element hidden in the stream of consciousness is probably the reason for the non-tantric teaching that Buddhahood is attainable only through a human body, which is a teaching continued in the Tantras (Snags rim, f. 460a-2):/dri med hod las/ skye ba hdi la sans rgyas nid kyi hbras bu rab tu ster ba rgyud kyi rgval poho/lha la sogs pa hgro ba lnahi skye ba la ni ma yin no/zhes dan/It says"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÄJATANTRAin the Vimalaprabha : ‘The phrase “grants the Buddha« hood fruit in this lire,> means— the King of Tantras grants the Buddhahood fruit in this birth, which is a humanbirth; not in the birth which is one of the five (other)destinies (gali.), god and the like.5B.

Tsoh-kha-pa in his Snags rim cites the Vimalaprabha : “Thediamond (vajra) is the great ‘insplittable5 and ‘unbreakable5; and the Great Vehicle (mahdydna) which is precisely so, is the Vajrayana : it combines the Mantra-way and the Prajna- paramita-way, which are (respectively) the ‘effect5 (or ‘fruit5) and the ‘cause 5 5 5 ( / rdo rje ni mi phyed pa dan mi ch.od pa chen po yin la de fiid theg pa chen po yin pa ni rdo rje theg pa ste/ shags kyi tshul dan pha rol tu phyin pahi tshul hbras bu daii rgyuhi bdag hid gcig tu hdres par gyur paho).

The Yoga Tantra was expressed for subduing the candi­dates who delight in th eyoga of inner samädhi with minimal outer ritual, while the Anuttara Yoga Tantra is the in­comparable Tantra for subduing the candidates who delight in inner-yoga.Mkhas grub rje alludes to the deity differentiation as the Tour Passion Families5 (pp. 168-169), detailed in the notes thereto on the basis of the Sñags rim :The mutual attraction of Insight (prajnä) andtheM eans (;upäya) finds :some deities laughing — Kriyä Tantra;some deities gazing — Caryä Tantra;some deities embracing — Yoga Tantra;some deities in coition — Anuttara Tantra.Tsoñ-kha-pa emphasizes that this is not a description of the candidates of these Tantra divisions;...Besides, it can be speculated that the fourfold grouping of Tantras (there were earlier groupings of six or more) is made with an eye to the four Siddhäntas. In later Indian Buddhism, it was standard to divide up Buddhist metaphysics into four viewpoints, called Siddhänta, that of the Vaibhäsikas, Sauträ- ntikas, Yogäcärins, and the Mädhyamikas. That could be the implication of Pandit Smrti's commentary called Vajravi- däranä-näma-dhäram-vrtti (Tohoku no. 2684) to the effect that the four Tantras constitute four kinds of washing by four kinds of persons, namely, áravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Yogäcärins, and Mädhyamikas, in the given order. In Mahäyäna termi­nology, the Srävakas and Pratyekabuddhas constitute the Hina- yäna saints, while Yogäcärins and Mädhyamikas are followers of the two main philosophical Mahäyäna schools constituting"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM61the last two Siddhantas. Also the first two Siddhantas, those of the Vaibhasika and the Sautrantika, are classified as Hina- yana, with the Sautrantika considered preparatory for the rise of Mahayana viewpoints. The relation set up by Pandit Smrti (also called Smrtijnanaklrti) has an artificial tone, at best is an overgeneralization, and at the same time is suggestive.In the Anuttarayoga-tantra, there is also a principal division into Father Tantras, such as the Guhyasamajatantra ; and Mother Tantras, such as the £ri-Cakrasamvara, a division which Mkhas-grub-rje explains following Tsoh-kh-pa. In brief, a Father Tantra emphasizes the ‘Means’ side of the ‘means- insight’ union, and so deals especially with the topics so promi­nent in the present work of evoking the three lights followed by the Clear Light, and of introducing the Illusory Body into the Clear Light. A Mother Tantra puts emphasis on the ‘Insight’ side of the cmeans-insight’ union, and so treats the indissoluble bliss and void; in fact, insofar as material dealing with this topic is included in the present work, it was derived from the Mother Tantra literature. Besides, the Guhyasamdja-tantra is considered the chief Tantra of the Father class, as is the £ri- Cakrasamvara of the Mother class, for the reason that the litera­ture and cult for the two Tantras is the most extensive anddeve- loped among the Tantras found in the Kanjur and Tanjur.The Guhyasamajatantra (Chap. X V III, 153, 6-7) also has its own definition and classification of tantra: “ ‘Tantra’ is explained as ‘continuous series’ (prabandha). That continuous series is threefold through the division—adhara, prakrti, and asam hdryaThe succeeding verse explains that prakrti is the hetu, asamhdrya is the phala, and adhara is the tipdya. According to Mkhas-grub-rje, the Tantra of Cause {hetu) is the chief of candidates for the high goal of the Tantra. The Tantra of Means (upaya) is the Tantra of Path. The Tantra of Fruit {phaia) is the rank of Vajradhara. Those explanations clarify the definition of ‘Tantra’ as ‘continuous series’. Apparently what is meant is that the Tantra shows the continuous progress of a superior candidate (Tantra of Cause) along the Tantric Path (Tantra of Means) to the high goal of Vajradhara (Tantra of Fruit). Nagarjuna’s Astddasa-patala-vistard-vyakhyd (PTT, Vo.. 30 p. 6-1) sets forth on the same basis three kinds of Vajradhara, causal Vajradhara. fruitional Vajradhara, and"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"62YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAVajradhara of the means. The causal Vajradhara is Maha- vajradhara, the adindtha. The fruitional Vajradhara is Akso- bhya and the other Tathagatas. The Vajradhara of the means is of three kinds, guarding of the place, guarding of oneself, and guarding of yoga. Guarding of the place is the frightening away of the demons through emanation of the ten Krodha deities. Guarding of oneself is the contemplation of only Paramartha-satya (supreme truth), by recollecting such mantras as “Om su n y ata..” Guarding of yoga is of two kinds; the collection of merit (arousing compassion and contemplating the four Brahma-vihara-s) and the collection of knowledge (contemplation of the four doors to liberation).G. Some-fundamentals of the TantrasHere we shall consider four fundamentals: analogicalthinking, the subtle body, the three worlds, and initiation by the hierophant.T h e first fundamental is analogical thinking : “As with­out, so within” (yatha bahyam tatha ’dhyatmam iti). The Sanskrit is from Abhayakaragupta’s Nifpannayogavali (ed. by B. Bhatta- charyya, p. 4), where it applies to the mandala of the ‘Stage of Generation’ (utpatti-krama). See Mkhas grub rje’s Fundamentals.., Index under ‘mandala’ : the self existent mandala is in the mind, and the reflected image mandala is drawn outside in conformity. The outer rite must conform to the inner rite, and vice versa. One must clear defiled thoughts from a space within the mind and erect the meditative image in this space. In the external mandala-rite, first one drives away the evil spirits from the selec­ted area; in this consecrated space one will draw the mandala. In Mkhas-grub-rje’s work, probably the most intricate set of analogies is found in the chapter on the Yoga tantra. In the present work, the most remarkable analogies are those in the treatment of the ‘hundred lineages’ under the commentary of the ‘Bhagavan Sarva’ and ‘Tathagata’ verses in Part Three. But the analogies are ubiquitous in the Tantras. The most important analogy of all is that of affiliation: the candidate should affiliate his body, speech, and mind -with the Body, Speech, and Mind of the Buddha, called the three mysteries. According to Mkhas grub rje, it is this affiliation which estab­"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM63lishes the superiority of the Diamond Vehicle (the Tantras) over non-tantric Buddhism. One affiliates his body by gesture (mudrd), his speech by incantation (mantra) and his mind by deep concentration (samddhi). Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals... states, “ In the Kriya and Garya (Tantras) one intensely con­templates the body as Great Seal (mahamudrd), speech as In­cantation (mantra), and mind as Reality (tattva).” This is the ‘Quick Path’ because all avenues of the being are operating for a common goal : the body, speech, and mind are not working at cross purposes.In such a case, we might say of body, speech, and mind, what Arya-Sura wrote in his Jdtaka-mald in description of King Sibi (but in his case meaning the three types, kama, artha, and dharma).tasmitju trivargdnugund gundughah samharjayogad iva samnivi$tdh\\samastardpd vibabhur na casu virodhasamkfobhavipannaso- bhdhlfIn him all forms having multitudes of virtues consistent with the three types appeared with common residence as though from merger of rivalries, and they had no loss of brilliance due to opposition and commotion.In Hinduism it is believed that those three types when in har­mony yield the fourth one, liberation (mokfa).To understand any system of Buddhist Tantra one must find out the basic correspondence system or systems and carry through accordingly. Fourfold correspondences are especially prevalent in the Yoga-tantra. Among Anuttarayoga-tantras, the Guhyasamajatantra regularly employs fivefold corresponden­ces based on the five Buddhas, the five knowledges, the five personality aggregates, and so on. The Kdlacakra-tantra uses sixfold correspondences, wherein the elements are increased to six by addition of ‘knowledge element’ to the five of earth, water, fire, wind, and space. Sevenfold correspondences can be noticed in commentaries of the Sri -Cakrasamvara-tanlra. An example especially pertinent to the present work is the Guhya- samaja set of four steps of sadhana or spiritual culture. Once the praxis is established in four steps, then some other principal entities are put in correspondence; thus the four goddesses are identified with the four steps. This very principle is employed"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"6 4 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAin the present work for grouping the forty verses which expand the rtxddna of the Guhyasamdjatantra.Is there a particular philosophical position of Buddhism that fits this kind of analogical thinking? Mkhas-grub-rje reports the thesis of the school founded by his teacher Tson- kha-pa that the Prasangika Madhyamika underlies all four classes of Tantra. This appears to stem from the acceptance of all four pramanas by the non-tantric Gandraklrti in his Pro- sannapada commentary on the Mula-madhyamaka-karika. There (in the commentary on the first chapter) Candrakirti says, in agreement with the Hindu Naiyayikas, that the four sources of knowledge (pramana) provide a foundation for the knowledge of worldly objects. Therefore, this Buddhist school accepts upamdna (analogy) as an independent source of knowledge. However, the epistemology of this school may differ from that of the Naiyayikas. Thus Candrakirti (text, p. 75) goes on to modify his acceptance of the pramanas by insisting on their relativity, or mutual dependence: “There being the cognitions (pramana), there are the cognizable objects (prameyartha); and there being the cognizable objects, there are the cognitions. But, indeed, there is no intrinsic-nature kind of establishment for either the cognition or the cognizable object” (satsu prama- nesu prameyarthah/ satsu prameyesv arfhesu pramanani/na tu khalu svabhaviki pramanaprameyayoh' siddhir iti..). In contrast, Asahga (as I pointed out in “The Rules of Debate According to Asanga” ) accepts only three pramanas, direct per­ception, inference, and testimony of authoritative persons. This appears to be consistent with Asanga’s Yogacara idealism, wherein the subjective consciousness has the upper hand over the objective domain. Because idealist philosophy does not admit an equal status of subject-object, it does not agree with the precept “As without, so within” , and so does not admit analogy as an independent source of knowledge. The Buddhist logicians, as well known, accept only two pramanas, direct percep­tion and inference.A fundamental metaphysical postulate is that of the subtle body, which of course is a basic idea of the Hindu systems as well. Tson-kha-pa explains in his commentary on the Paiicakrama (PTT, Vol. 159, p. 41-5) that there are two kinds of ‘mind-only bodies’ (sems tsam gyi lus. cittamdlra-deha), namely"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM65the body of ‘states’ (gnas skabs, avasthd) and th e ‘innate body’ (gfitig ma pahi lus, nija-deha). The first of these is the ‘body of maturation’ (iripakakdya) formed during the ten states (avasthd), which are the lunar months of intrauterine life, and which is born, matures, and dies. The second of these is the body formed of winds and mind only, the ‘mind only’ including no five outer-sense based perception (vijnana) and the ‘winds’ including only the basic five winds (prdna, etc.) and not the secondary five {ndga, etc.). According to Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals.., the ‘uncommon means body’ (asadhdrana-upa- yadeha), a kind of subtle body, is the basis for the tantricmachi­nations; this body seems to be a development of the innate body (;nija-deha). The Tantras believe that by praxis involving mystic winds and mental muttering, this innate body gradually becomes defined as separate though within the coarse body. A more advanced stage is when this body can appear separately as an illusory body and be made to enter an ultimate state called the Clear Light, thus returning to a condition from which it had fallen, and which is anterior to the male-female division. As this innate body is strengthened, first it brings out exceed­ing acuity of one or more senses. The supernormal sharpness of smell is a topic in the celebrated Lotus Sutra (Saddharma- Pundarika) chapter X V III on advantages of a religious preacher. Non-tantric Buddhism speaks of six supernormal faculties (<abhijrtd), while tantric Buddhism adds more, for example, the eight siddhis.The remarkable occult physiology of the tantric books is really based on their theories of this subtle body. This body is said to have 72,000 ‘veins’ (nadt), of which three are the chief ones located in the position of the backbone. These three, the chief conduits of the ‘winds’, are differently named in the Hindu and Buddhist Tantras:Besides, the Buddhist Tantras superimpose on those three channels four cakras (suggesting how four-fold analogies may be superimposed on the three-fold ones).

One primary group of four cakras, important for what is called the ‘Stage of Completion’ (sampanna-krama) and havipg affinities with Upanisadic teachings, corresponds to four of the Hindu system as follows:head neck heart navelHindu Ajna Visuddha Anahata M anipuraBuddhist Mahasukha Sambhoga Dharma NirmanaHere I may cite my article “Female Energy and Symbolismin the Buddhist Tantras” for observations stemming fromTson-kha-pa’s commentary on the Guhyasamaja Explanatory Tantra Caturdevipariprccha :The primacy in this system of four cakras for physiologi­cal manipulation in ascetic practices may well go back to the old Upanisadic theories of the four states of con­sciousness. The Brahmopani$ad, one of the Samnyasa Upanisads, later than the early Upanisads but preceding the Tantric literature as we now have it, teaches that thePurusa has those four states when dwelling in the fourplaces, namely, waking state in the navel, sleep ( i.e. dream) in the neck, dreamless sleep in the heart, and the fourth, Turlya, in the head. In agreement, Tson-kha-pa writes : ‘When one has gone to sl^ep, there is bothdream and absence of dream. At the time of deep sleep without dream the white and red elements of the bodhi- citta, which is the basis of mind, stay in the heart, so mind is held in the heart. At the time of dreaming, those two elements stay in the neck, so mind is held in the neck. At the time when one is not sleeping, they stay at the navel, so mind is held there. When the male and female unite, those two stay in the head.The later system of four cakras is correlated with the theory of four elements deified as goddesses, and is important for the practice during the ‘Stage of Generation’ {utpatti-krama). Following the indications of the Manimdla commentary on Nagarjuna’s Pahcakrama (PTT, Vol. 62, p. 178-2) and the Sarvarahasya-ndma-tantraraja, verses 37-39 (PTT, Vol. 5), the fire-disk at the throat (or neck) is shaped like a bow; the water-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM67-disk at the heart is circular in shape; the wind-disk at the navel is triangular; and the earth-disk in the sacral place is square. These are also the shapes of the four altars for rites of burnt offering (homa) aimed at certain mundane siddhis (see nidátia verse 15), and they are also the shapes of the four continents of Puránic mythology (compare the printed geometrical forms in the edition of the Guhyasamdja, Chap. XV). The elements supply the names for these cakras (frequently máhendra for earth, and vdruna for water). According to the Snags rim (Peking blockprint, 441a-5).¡kha sbyor las/ jme ňid gaň dan rluň daň nil fdbati chen daň ni bzhin chu/ \\hkhor lor sems kyi kun spyod pa\\ \\steň daň ňos daň braň hog hgroj zhes gsuňspas me sten daň rluň bsegs daň sa thad kar daň chu hog tu hgroho /It says in the Sampuťa : Tire, wind, earth {máhendra), and water, are each the executors of consciousness in a (given) cakra, and move (respectively) upwards, at acute angles, forward, and downwards/ This means that the fire (vibration) moves upwards; the wind, at acute angles to the wave (tiryak); the earth, straight forward; and the water, downwards.The earth disk is equivalent to the Hindu Muládhára-cakra, said to-lie below the root of the sex organs and above the anus. The series is increased in the Hindu Tantras with Sahasrára at the-crown of the head, where Buddhism places the Buddha’s Ufnifa (sometimes said to be outside the body); and with Svá- dhisthána at the root of the penis, called in some Buddhist Tantras the ctip of the gem’ (*many-agra).Then we must take for granted that there are three worlds full of gods and demons. In the Guhyasamdjatantra, Chap. IV, p. 17, there is the line atha vajradharáh šdstd trilokas tu tridhd- tukah, on which Pradipoddyotana {Mchan hgrel edition, PTT., Vol. 158, p. 38.5) explains triloka as being sa hog (pátála), sa steii (bhiimi), and mtho ris (svarga); and explains tridhdtuka as being th e‘realm of desire’ (kámadhátu), e tc. The correspondences can be tabulated as follows:"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAOld VedicwordsDyausHindu period Tibetansa bla = mtho ris (‘superior world’)sa steň (‘above the earth’)Possibly the Buddhist three Svarga sa bla = mtho ‘formlessrealm (arupa dhátu)Antariksa Blnuni sa steň (‘above ‘realm of form(rupa dhatu)Prthiví Pátála sa hog (‘earth ‘realm of desire*and below’) (kámadhátu)The Vedic mantras of the three worlds are also employed in the Buddhist Tantras, as in this passage of Tsoň-kha-pa’s Sňagsrim (f. 31 lb.4) :Ibhúr ni rluň gi dkyil hkhor la sogs pa hkhor daň bcas pahi sa hog gojbhuvah ni sa steň gi hjig rten no/svah zhes pa ni mtho ris te srid rise mthar thug paho\\.Bhúr is the underworld accompanied by the circles of the wind disk (váyu-mandala) and so forth. Bhuvah is the ‘perishable receptacle’ (loka) of ‘above the earth’. Svah is the ultimate pinnacle of existence, the superior world.The females or goddesses in terms of the three worlds are especially treated in the Šň-Cakrasarjivara-tantra and its com­mentaries. How does one come in contact with any of those gods or goddesses ? Mircea Eliade (Toga : Immortality and Freedom, p. 208) cites the proverb ‘a non-god does not honor a god’ (nadevo devam arcayet). That means that one must awaken the senses of that particular realm and learn the rules. The child cannot make his way in the human world without human senses and without learning the human rules. Thus first one generates oneself into deity (‘selfgeneration’in Mkhas grub rje’s work).The last of these fundamentals is the topic of initiation (abhifeka) meant to confer power, explained as maturing the stream of consciousness. The power, including the permission to continue that tantric lineage, is conferred by the hierophant (vajracarya). The Pradipoddyotana on Chapter X V II (Mchan hgrel, p. 157-4) contains this passage :I tathá cdha f mahamaháyánaratnarájasUtre // bhagaván vajrapanih / uddiyánaparvate ni$annah/sarvdrjíš ca vajra- yánašikfitán ámantrayamása/J šrnuta nik hi lavaj ray dr,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM69sikfitáh tathdgataiji pariniwrtaiji na pafyati\\§asldram api tu vajrdcdryo vajraguruh / so'yarfi ¿dstd bhavatiti/And it is also said in the Mahámahdyánaratnardjasütra:The Lord Vajrapáni was seated on the mountain of Oddiyána, and addressed all the trainees of the Vajra- yána : “All you trainees in the Vajrayána, listen! When one does not see the Teacher, the Tathágata entered into Parinirvána, then the hierophant, the diamond guru, will serve as his teacher.”Various passages stress that one should look upon the hiero­phant as upon the Buddha, to disregard his faults and notice only his virtues, in that way, he is able to play the role of master for the disciple.Initiations are conferred in mandalas and are accompanied by vows (samvara) and pledges (samaya). The ‘Stage ofGeneration* has the five vidyd initiations as described in Mkhas-grub rje’s work. They are called the cvidyd’ because they are adversaries for the five forms of ‘avidyd* (nescience), also because they are in reality conferred by the goddess consorts of the five Buddhas. Mkhas grub rje points out that although the ‘preceptor* and the ‘hierophant’ lift up the flask (all five rites are accompanied with ‘sprinkling’), in fact the goddesses Locaná and soon hold the flask and conduct the initiation. In the transition to the Stage of Completion, there is the hiero­phant’s initiation. Then there are three initiations proper to the Stage of Completion, the Secret Initiation, the Insight Knowledge Initiation, and the ‘Fourth*. The initiating goddess is sometimes called the ‘seal* (mudra). The notes to Mkhas grub rje cite the verse: “ The seal pledge is explained as solidi­fying the ‘body made of mind’ (manomayakdya) ; because it solidifies all the body, it is called a ‘seal* (mudra).” The fact that in each instance the goddess is imagined as the initiator, or is the female element behind the scenes, indicates the initia­tions as the step-wise progress in the solidification of the innate body of the tantras which non-tantric Buddhism calls the ‘body made of mind’, meaning the progress of that body to the prege- netic androgyne state and then to the Clear Light.D. Winds and mantras A fundamental of the Buddhist Tantras that deserves"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"70YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAspecial treatment is the practice of mantras and machinations with winds. Such practices are very ancient in India, certainly of Vedic character. The doctrine of life winds is first worked out in the old Upanisads. The basic five winds are mentioned in Chandogya Up., III. 13 and V. 19, in the order prana, vydna, apdna, samdna, udana. The winds are the ‘breaths’ resulting* from ‘water’, as in the well-known ‘Three-fold development’ discussion of the Chandogya; this is made clear in Brhadaranyaka Up., 1.5.3. The functions ascribed to these winds continued to be speculated upon, and so came into the Buddhist Tantras in the theory of breath manipulation through yoga practice* Also a theory of five subsidiary winds developed, clarified later in The Toga Upanisads \\ in the Buddhist Tantras these latter five are accorded the function of relating external sensory objects to the five sense organs, while the former five are attributed various internal functions. When ten breaths [prana) are mentioned in Brhadaranyaka Up., III. 9.4, Vedantic commentarial tradition takes them to be the ten« sensory and motor organs (jndnakarmendriyani), thus explaining away the palpable refe­rence to winds: but we can infer the real meaning to be that those winds vivify the sensory and motor organs. In the latter Brhadaranyaka Up. passage, modern' translators have rendered the verb rod ay anti with causative force (‘make someone lament’), thus requiring an unexpressed object. A good Sanskrit grammar,, such as the one by William Dwight Whitney, readily shows that the causative infix-¿z>vz-does not necessarily confer causative force upon a Sanskrit verb.

The five principal winds have the respective natures of the five Buddhas and are associated with the five mantra- syllables and body-cakras as follows:Om—Vairocana—vyäna—all over thebody, or headAh—Amitabha—udäna— throatHum—Aksobhya—pränä —heartSvä—Ratnasambhava —apänar—sacral regionHä—Amoghasiddhi —samäna—navelThe four winds, leaving out vyana, are held in basic time or ordinary life to breathe in and out cyclically through one or other nostril or both.

This recitation of winds is indicated, according to the Pradipoddyotana commentary, as the meaning of the verses 9-14 (omitting 13) in Chapter Six (‘Documents5). Verse 9 deals with meditation on the tip of the nose of the face; at this stage one must take the passage of the winds on faith. Then verse 10 mentions an image of the Buddha, which is Vairocana. But as the Vairocaria wind, vyána, does not enter into the inbreathing and outbreathing, the diamond recitation intended by the verse is in fact Amitabha’s fiery udána-wind.

And the winds mixed that way dissolve the knots (mdud) of those centers. Accordingly, in fruitional time, the mantras have been reduced from five to three. This is meant to achieve three photism experiences called ‘light’, ‘spread of light’, and ‘culmination of light’. The further reduction from three to one corresponds to the experience of the Clear Light which is free from the three.Also, the Stage of Completion increases to three the noses meant by ‘tip of nose’, a teaching found in the Vajramala, summarized in Tsofi-kha-pa, “Dkah gnad” , Lhasa collected works, Vol. Ca, 8a-2 :The three ‘tips of nose’ (nds&gra) are 1. the ‘tip of nose’ of the sacral place; 2. ‘tip of nose’ of the face’ ; 3. ‘tip of nose’ of the heart (sna rtse gsum ni/gsaii bahi sna rtse, gdoň gi sna rtse, sňiň gi sna rtse.).

Thus Pancakrama, 1st krama, verse 66; Šrí Laksmí, Vol . 63, p. 21-5- and 22-1 :mantratattvam idam vyaktam vdgvajrasya prasadhanam/ jňanatrayaprabhedena cittamatre niyojayet 11 This clear reality of mantra as the accomplishment of the speech diamond, is applied to ‘Mind Only’ by the variety of three gnoses.Šri Laksmí explains that mantra has two aspects, by distinction of cause and effect. “The cause is prana, the effect is mantrap and their reality is the ‘reality of mantra’ ” (/de la rgyu ni srogf rluň daň / hbras bu ni sňags ste/de dag gi de ňid ni sňags kyi de nid de/). The ‘three gnoses’ mean the three lights.But then, do mantras have meaning ? See the discussion in The CalcuttaReview, 137-1 (Oct. 1955), aportion of the serial translation by J. V. Bhattacharyya of the Nydyamanjari, here (pp. 7-13) discussing the validity of mantras. The opponents: hold that the mantras do not convey meaning (p. 8) : “Amantra renders its assistance to a Vedic rite only by its recita­tion.” Among their illustrations is the mantra, “Hear, oh slabs of stone !” (šrnota gravdnah). They say (pp. 8-9): “This meaning is absurd since unconscious slabs of stone are never employed to listen to something.” The author of the Nydya­manjari, when replying to their arguments, says of this parti­cular example (p. 12) : “ Šrnota grávánah is...a miraculous act by the influence of which slabs of stone can even hear.” His chief answer is that the opponents have not taken .. . pains."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM75to find out the meaning. In conclusion he states (p. 13) : c‘Mantras, revealing their senses, render assistance to a sacrificial rite. But they do not help a rite by their mere recitation like the muttering of a m a n tra ....55 The viewpoint of the Nyaya- manjari is quite consistent with that of the Buddhist Tantras, where the mantras do indeed have meaning. For example, one need only consult the Tanjur commentaries on the Vajra- viddrana-mma-dharani, to learn that each one of the mantra expressions is given its explanation in terms of functions of the various deities involved. The Buddhist ^Tantra also insists that mere muttering of the mantra is useless, since one must simul­taneously make a mudra and concentrate the mind accordingly. And it also agrees when the Buddhist Tantra speaks of success in the incantation as the state when the mantra seems to pro­nounce itself, thus assuming the role of a deity5s body (mantra- murti'. An interesting example of this is in the last chapter of the Sri Paramadya tantra (PTT, Vol. 5, p. 171-5), understood with the help of Anandagarbha5s commentary (PTT, Vol. 73, p. 127-5). The Tantra states: “How is theBhagavat the master of the deeds of ‘diamond pride5 ? Because the best mudra belongs to the great lord (maheivara) who has the best of great siddhis and (she) greatly praises the diamond lord, the one who says ‘I am the master of diamond pride5 is the Bhagavat, the supreme primordial person.55 (/ de la rdo rje bsnems byahi bdag po bcom ldan hdas ci ltar yin zhe na // kun mchog dnos grub chen po yi ' / dbari phyug chen po phyag rgyahi mchog // rdo rje dbari phyug cher bstod pas // rdo rje bsnems pahi bdag po bdag ces oyaba ni bcom ldan hdas mchog dan pohi skyes buho /). The idea here, as gleaned from Anandagarbha5s comments, is that ‘diamond pride! is the name of a goddess and she is the best mudrd. Since she praises the Bhagavat, he is her master (pati) + This alludes to the state when the mudra coalesces with the mantra to reveal its sense (as the Nyayamanjari would say); and since its sense is‘diamond pride5 (vajragarva) the mind united with that mudra can be proud. She praises without any prompting :t he incantation sounds by itself. She has her own deeds or functions.However, some Western scholars have quite missed the point of h ew mantras acquire meaning. Take the celebrated mantra 'f the Buddhist Bodhisattva Lord Avalokitesvara, Otn mam pa dm e hum Scholars have ascribed this and that meaning"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAto it; for example, “Orp, the jewel in the lotus, hüm.” The implication of such an explanation is that the mantra has a meaning independent of the recitation, which is denied both by the Hindu Nydyamanjari and the Buddhist Tantras. When one goes into this cült of Avaloki tes vara, he finds out readily that this is called the six-syllabled formula. The six syllables are recited in the six times of day and night, along with fasting and correlated with gestures (mudrd), and the imagined six destinies of gods, men, etc. as associated with six colors. The meaning is the six Buddhas corresponding respectively to the syllables. By continual application to the cult with proper recitation of the six syllables in a correlation of body, speech, and mind, the yogin expects to identify himself with the Lord Ava- lokiteávara who looks with compassion at the beings in the six destinies. Gradually the meaning is evoked by the recitation. While such a translation as “Orp, the jewel in the lotus, hüip” does not convey any intelligence of the cult; nevertheless, if one insists on a translation anyway in such form, it is proper to translate the ‘mani padme5 portion as “jéwel in the lotus” be­cause on^. would understand mani-as the Middle Indie form equal to Sanskrit mani^h), the nominative. In terms of mantra construction, because the initial and final syllables are Om and Hüm, themiddle portion ‘mani padme5 is equivalent to thesyllable Ah, for these are the three heart syllables of the Buddhas corres­ponding to Body, Speech, and Mind, respectively Vairocana, Amitabha, and Aksobhya. Accordingly, the middle portion stands for the Buddha Amitabha in the heaven Sukhavati.The gods are literally expressed into manifestation; that is, they are called into phenomenal forms by mantra. In the Anuttarayoga-tantra cult, the .syllables E-VA(M) serve for this expression. ‘Evarp.’ (Thus) is the first word in the Buddhist scriptures, which normally begin “Thus by me it was heard” (evarp, maya frutam). Mchati hgrel, PTT, Vol. 158, p. 13-3, states : “The syllable E is like a mother. Therefore, the ‘in­sight’ (prajñd) syllable (E) is symbolized as the sixteen vowels (svara). Va is like a father. The ‘seminal drop5 (bindu} thig le, rp) of Varp makes manifest the vowels. Hence the ‘means5 (updya) syllable (Vam) is symbolized as the thirty-three conso­nants (vyañjana). Through their union arises, like sons, the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST TANTRISM77host of words. Thus E is the womb (alaya, km gzhi) and Varp the progenitor, of pravacana (the Buddhist scripture).” The bindu is also called in this literature the b<?dhicitta (mind of enlightenment).E. The world of lightIn the article “Notes on the Sanskrit term jfiana” I first tried to correlate the Guhyasamaja tradition of four lights (three light stages leading to or emerging from the Clear Light) with other systems of thought. Already it was apparent to me that the theory involved a reinterpretation of the old Buddhist for­mula of Dependent Origination (pratitya-samutpada). With the researches of the present work behind me it is easier to detect the Upanisadic precursors of this theory (it would be hazardous to try to trace it back to the Rg-veda).Perhaps the most discussed Upanisadic passage is the Chdndogya Upani$ad from V I.2 to V I.6. This teaches a develop­ment order of 1. heat, becoming speech; 2. water, becoming breath; 3. food, becoming mind. By their respective colors of red, white, and black, they were later (Hindu period) identi­fied with the three gunas (employed extensively in the Buddhist Tantras), to wit: rajas (activity, passion), sattva (buoyancy, clarity), tamas (immobility, darkness), although the guna applicability to the Chandogya text has been questioned. The Brhadaranyaka Upani$ad 1.5 portrays Prajapati’s production of the world as food for himself; and this suggestion o f‘food’ as the first produced is consistent with 1.5.3: “ Mind, speech, breath, these he made for himself” (mano vacam pranam, tany atmane kuruta), since we learn from the Chdndogya that ‘food’becomes cm ind\\ The !Brhadaranyaka order is consistent with a tantric interpretation of Buddhist Dependent Origination, with my understanding of the Vardhopanipadj and with theGuhyasamaja- nidana doctrine of three lights or three gnoses (jndnalraya). The Vardhopani$ad is translated by T. R. Srinivasa Ayyangar and edited by G. Srinivasa Murti in The Toga Upani$ads. In the Vardha we read: “ For says the Sruti, ‘These are the five essential features, viz., Asti (there is),Bhati (there shines forth), Preyas (whatever pleases), Rupa (form) and Naman (name).

The Pradipoddyotana quotes the Samdhivyakarana’s remark, ‘said to be the doctrine of Dependent Origination’ (;rten ciii hbrel hbyuii chos su grags), to which Mchan hgrel adds, ‘arising from the wind and mind only of the Clear Light’ {hod gsal gyi rluh sems tsam las skyes pa hi).Maryla Falk wrote a book entitled Nama Riipa and Dharma- Rapa.

Geiger and Prof. W. Geiger into the use of the term dhamma in the Pali Canon {Pali Dhamma, vornehmlich in der kanonischen Literatur, Abh. de Bayer. Ak. d. Wiss., Philos.-philol. u. hist. Kl., X X X I, 1. Munich 1921) is the conclusion that ‘the concept dhamma takes in Buddhism the place of the brahman of older Vedanta’ (p. 77). We have shown above that in Upanishadic thought, ever since its Vedic beginnings, the equivalence of both terms reflects the sameness of the entity they designate.In short, the equivalence of Pali dhamma and the old Indian term brahman leads to the equivalence Dharma-rupa = Brahma- rupa. This Dharma-rupa is therefore the pre-genetic world, anterior to the phenomenal world denoted by Nama-rupa. The Salapatha-brahmana (Eggeling’s translation as quoted by Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, I, p. 20) has the celebrated passage:Then the Brahman itself went up to the sphere beyond. Having gone up to the sphere beyond, it considered, ‘How can I descend again into these worlds ?’ It then descended again by means of these two, Form and Name. Whatever has a name, that is name; and that again which has no name and which one knows by its form, ‘this is (of a certain) form,’ that is form: as far as there are Form and Name so far, indeed, extends this (universe). These indeed are the two great forces of Brahman; and, verily, he who knows these two great forces of Brahman becomes himself a great force.The equivalent statement involving the equation Dharma = Brahman, and taking into account the Pailcakrama list of eighty prakrtis in three sets (seven, forty, and thirty-three), each set constituting momentary dark spots obscuring three light realms, also called the triple vijnana, can be expressed by Vijnana (the {Lahkavatara's ‘body of the Tathagata’) descending into the womb by means of name-and-form, the fourth member of Dependent Origination.

In this pre- genetic sphere, Gautama decided that 4. ‘name-and-form’ has 3. ‘perception’ (vijnana) as its indispensable condition; the latter, No. 2 ‘motivations’ (saqiskdra); and the latter, No. 1 ‘nescience’ (avidya). And—the Guhyasamdja tradition suggests—* this is his way of stating in psychological terms, the ‘white water*, ‘red heat’, and ‘black food’ of the Chandogya Up. vision, the atomic triad of the superior realm.Since the correlation of the supramundane light stages of the Guhyasamaja commentarial tradition is associated with the first members of Dependent Origination, vand with the develop­mental order of the Brhadaranyaka Upanifdd (rather than with the Chandogya order), it follows that if we are to acknowledge a feasibility that the formula of Dependent Origination is based on the Upanisads, we have to further admit that the Brhadaran- yaka Up. is the one with which the Buddhist formula has the most affinityEven if we accept that these three light stages may be traceable to such ancient sources as the old Upanisads, it must still be acknowledged that the theory of 80 prakrtis superimposed on the three lights is a development after the rise of the Buddhist Tantras. The Paflcakrama commentary Manimdld cited under nidana verse 6 explicitly mentions that the thirty-three female natures are generated by the wind in the left channel, the forty male natures by the wind in the right channel, and the seven neuter natures by the wind in the middle.

In contrast, as John Woodroffe, Introduction. to Tantra Shastra, pp. 49, if., points out, there are six vrtti associated with the Svâdhisthâna- cakra, ten vrtti with the Manipura, twelve vrtti with the Anâ- hata, twelve vrtti with the Viéuddha, sixteen kald with the Sahasràra, four ànanda with the Mülàdhàra$ with no sets men­tioned for the Àjftâ-cakra. Thus, this kind of Hindu tantra assigns vrttis to cakras rather than to the three nddi; and very- few of the vrttis can be identified with the prakrtis.As I perused the various commentaries on the Padcakrama available in the Tibetan Tanjur, I tried to find some explanation for the numbers ‘thirty-three’ etc., and any suggestions of internal grouping within the three sets of natures, but to little avail. However, the Padcakrama commentary called Manu maid attempts to rationalize the eighty prakrtis in terms of the Buddhist Abhidharma set of fifty-one caitasikadharmas (‘derivative mentals’), so in PTT, Vol. 62, pp. 186-187. I studied these pages with the help of the collaborated article by Dr. P. Cordier and L. de La Vallée Poussin, “ Les soixante-quinze et les cent dharmas.” For example, when this commentary analyses the set of thirty-three prakrtis (see the list under nidàna verse 1 ) it includes nos. 1-3, three degrees of aversion, under kaukrtya (‘regret’); 4-5 (thinking) future and past, under vitarka'and vicdra (‘searching state of mind’ and ‘deciding state of mind’)— —kaukrtya, vitarka, and vicdra being among the list of aniyata- bhümikas (‘indeterminate caitasikas’). It includes 11-13, threetdegrees of fear, under the three virtuous roots (kuialamüla)— non-clinging (alobha), non-hating (advefa), and non-delusion (amoha), which are in the' list of kuialamahdbhümikas (mental elements present in every good conception); and so on. The attempt is obviously forced, but is significant for showing this author’s belief that the dharmas are identical with the prakrtis. This is a common theory that the conscious mind does not create a thought, but that the thought (here a dharma or a prakrtx) flows into the mind. Where does the thought come from ? The Guhyasamâja system holds that the thought comes from oneorotherDf three light realms. In terms o f ‘channels’ (nâdï)y the archetypal world is called ‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘middle’. A consistent theory was earlier stated in the Bhagavadgitd (Chap."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAX, 4-5): “ . . the different states of being proceed from me alone.” Moreover, there is a curious resemblance between the thirty-three femaleprakrtis and the five sthayi-bhdvas as discussed by Edward C. Dimock, Jr., The Place of the Hidden Moon, and earlier in his article “Doctrine and Practice Among the Vaisnavas of Bengal.” There are informative annotations concerning them in Saraswati Goswami Thakur, Shri Brahma-Sarfihitdy pp. 10-3, 159-62, which represents the five as devotion of diffe­rent individuals. The only source in the English language to my notice which presents these five in the form of stages of a single person to union with the LordKrsna, is Y. Jagannatham, Divine Love and Amorous Sentiment, a modern pamphlet picked up at Jayavelu’s in Madras. When I studied these passages and added the advice of Mr. Kirpal Singh Narang about the five stages of the Sikhs (stated in his very words below ) on the occa­sion of his Madison, Wisconsin visit on April 18, 1966, it occur­red to me that the thirty-three prakrtis of female consciousness to be presented under nidana verse no.l are roughly in five groups the fleeting moments of consciousness in the five stages of the devotee’s ‘female’ soul becoming a GopI (cow-girl) in union with the Lord.

Perhaps the forty prakrtis of maleconsciousness derive from a Vaisnava prototype.The only way that occurs to me to reconcile the division of the eighty prakrtis into three groups, with what seems to me to be an obvious division of the male and female ones into five groups, is to associate them with the right and left in five cakras starting with no. 1 at the base of the spine, no. 2 at the navel, and moving upward to union in the ájñá-cakra or mahasukha- cakra.

The reason the Tibetan tradition accepted the Devendrapariprccha as an Expla­natory Tantra is that immediately after the quotation from that work by title (reproduced in the materials for nidána verses Evám mayá. . ), Candraklrti continued with a verse citation (reproduced in section B, next) which he introduced by the remark (Pradipoddyotana M S): / mayetyádi vajrapadánám apy artho vyákhyátantrád avatáryate / “One can understand from the Explanatory Tantra the meaning of the diamond words ‘mayá9 etc.” Tsoň-kha-pa in his Mchan hgrel (p. 14-1) on the Pradipoddyotana mentions, “Skal-ldan-grags-pa examined the Vajramala carefully and could not find this therein.” The thrust of the decision lies in the fact that the Vajramálá presents the forty nidána verses in its chapter 59. Its brief chapter 58 is devoted to a treatment of the two syllables E-vam. It is precisely the Vajramálá which should have had, but lacked the cited verses. Candraklrti preceded his citation of the forty verses by citation of verses about the nidána sentence but used other sources, first the named Devendrapariprcchá, and then an unnamed work he calls an ‘Explanatory Tantra’. The Tibetans (Tsoň- kha-pa, in any case) decided that Candraklrti had treated the Devendrapariprccha with the authority ordinarily accorded an Explanatory Tantra, and identified that work accordingly. But that Tantra had not itself been translated; the Pradipoddyo­tana passage apparently is the full extant portion of Sanskrit of this work (the Subhá$ita-saijigraha, Part II, pp. 32-3, quotes the Devendrapariprcchá-tantra by lines contained within the Pradi­poddyotana citation).The Vajrajňána also has a difficulty of literary history. It is a curious feature of Candrakirti’s Pradipoddyotana that his"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"classifying terminology used throughout this commentary on the Guhyasamdjatantra, namely the ‘Seven Ornaments’ (saptd- latfikara)> is ascribed several times near the outset of his work to an Explanatory Tantra which he does not name, but which is none other than the VajrajMnasamuccaya; and so Tsoň-kha-pa in turn cannot specify the Pradipoddyotana for containing the name of this Explanatory Tantra. This silence regarding the title of the work from which he drew the material he popularized may mean that Gandraklrti had a hand in composing the Vajrajňánasamuccaya, the latter portion of it, or the expanded version (Toh. 450), to justify his commentarial position, as has been suggested by Yukei Matsunaga in his article, “A Doubt to Authority of the Guhyasamája-Ákhyána-tantras.”Another mystery of Explanatory Tantras occurs in Candraklrti’s Pradipoddyotana at the very end of chapter Four:I yathoktaiji bhagavatd vyakhydtantre j sárváňgabhávanátitatfi kalpandkalpavarjitam j matrabindusamdtitam dan mandalam uttamam //As was said by the Bhagavat in the Explanatory Tantra:Transcending the contemplation of all portions (i.e. color and shape), free from both imagination and lack of imagi­nation, transcending the upper sign and its bindu A, that is the supreme mantjala.Tsoň-kha-pa in his Mchan hgrel (p. 41) mentions that an almost identical verse is found in the Candraguhyatilaka (another quotation from this work in the Pradipoddyotana is reproduced in the initiation remarks in the section ‘The two stages, initiations,, and the clear light’; and Aryadeva appeals to this Tantra for the expression TOO lineages’). The only difference is where in the verse the compound mdtrabindu is translated in Candraklrti’s work as gug skyed thig le, the Candraguhyatilaka Tibetan version has the words hdren daň tshig (‘guide and letter’). Since the expression mdtrabindu is difficult to interpret, it is possible that it is the original for those Tibetan words, with hdren = bindu, and tshig = mátrá. Tsoň-kha-pa left the matter open; he appears not to accept the evidence of one similar verse as final proof that Candraklrti had this Tantra in mind. However, it so happens that this same verse is cited by Indrabhuti in his Jňána- siddhi (GOS ed., p. 83), and attributed to a chapter thirteen. On the preceding page he has cited the Advayasamatdvijaya, and8 6 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRA"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"his immediately succeeding quotation from a chapter nine, as well as that citation of chapter thirteen are presumably from that Tantra.According to George Roerich, The Blue Annals, Part Two, p. 417, Bu-ston considered the Advayasamatavijaya to be an Explanatory Tantra of the Guhyasamdjatantra; he translated a version of that work in 22 chapters that was incomplete in the middle. Possibly this is the reason that Tson-kha-pa apparently ignores this work. Several centuries after his time, the Chinese version of this Tantra was used to fill out the missing portion of Bu-ston’s translation, accounting for the present version in the Tibetan Kanjur. But if Bu-ston was serious about this Advaya- samatavijaya as an Explanatory Tantra, I can find no confirma­tion of this in his own Pradipoddyotana commentary in Collected Works (Part 9), where he freely cites the Sandhivydkarana (in an older translation preceding the one now officially in the Kanjur), the Vajramala, the Vajrahrdaydlarjxkdra, Yoga-tan tras (on which he was the great authority), Aryadeva’s various works, and other works, but not, as far as I could notice, the Advayasamatavijaya.Again, in his Pradipoddyotana on chapter XIV, Candra- kirti quotes from an unnamed Vyakhya-tantra an interesting prose passage with Vajrapani as interlocutor (included in this work under ‘Van’). Finally, having mystified sufficiently the ‘Explanatory Tantras,’ Candraklrti in his commentary on Chapter X V II cites the ‘Mula-tantra’, which Tson-kha-pa identifies as the Mula-tantra of the Yoga-tantra, namely the Tattvasarjigraha (cf. the passage in the treatment of initiation). According to The Blue Annals, Book VII {‘The Preaching of the Tantras’), there was a distinction o f‘Outer’ Yoga-tantra and ‘Inner’Yoga-tantra, with the ‘inner’ variety becoming separately called ‘Anuttarayoga-tantra’. One can therefore understand Candraklrti’s citation as indicating his adherence to this termi­nology, since the Tattvasamgraha is the mula-tantra of the ‘outer’ Yoga-tantra. Indeed, there is much in common between the Yoga-tantra (such works as the Tattvasarjigraha, the Maydjdla, Sarvarahasya-tantra, and Sri Paramddya) and the ‘Father’ class of Anuttarayoga-tantra. Both classes of Tantra use the termi­nology of ‘three samadhis’, clarified in our Introduction III.C., although there are differences in definitions.INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 87"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRACandraklrti’s citation of both the Sandhlvyakarana and the Vajramdld as ‘Arya-vyakhyana’ shows that he took for granted the knowledge in his readers of those two works. By impli­cation, when he cites a verse from the Sarvarahasy a-tantra with­out any indication of source, those same readers are expected to know the work. Then, when he cites by name some other Tantras, such as the Mayajdlatanlra, the Vajrofnifatantra, the Vairocanabhisaijibodhi, and the Vajrahrdaydlamkara, we may infer that he gives the names because he cannot expect the followers of the Guhyasamaja to know those other Tantras by heart. But if this is indeed the case, it would also have to apply to his quotations from the named works Devendrapariprccha and the Candraguhyatilaka. So there are certainly many difficulties about the literary history of these works. Tsoh-kha-pa (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 175-6) rejects the view advanced by some that the Vajrahrdaydlamkara and the Mayajala are Explanatory Tantras, since some consistency with the Guhyasamaja does not qualify those works as ‘Explanatory’. However, Tsoh-kha-pa, as Bu-ston before him, often cites the Vajrahrdaydlarfikara-tantra in commentarial macerial on the Guhyasamajatantra. Hisjustification is suggested in his Paficakrama commentary, PTT Vol. 158, p. 186-5, wherehe refers to thtVajrahrdayalamkara as a ‘consistent means (upaya) tantra’ (phyogs mthun gyi thabs gyt rgyud), that is to say consistent with one side of Guhyasamaja teaching. According to Tsoh-kha-pa (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 177-1), while the Explanatory Tantra Vajramdld discusses some other matters, it principally teaches the‘arcane body’, ‘arcane speech’, and ‘arcane mind’, and the illusory body (maya-deha). He further explains (ibid., p. 177-1, 2)) that the Caturdevipariprccha principally teaches extensively the essentials of pranaydma; and that the Sandhivyakarana is consistent with the sequence of chap­ters of the mula-lantra and is an Explanatory Tantra for the first twelve chapters of the Guhyasamaja and not for the remaining ones. He also mentions (ibid., p. 176-1) that a larger and a smaller version of the VajrajMnasamuccaya are stated in the com­mentary on the Vajramdld; these are numbered respectively 450 and 447 in the Tohoku catalog based on the Derge edition of the Kanjur-Tanjur (but the Peking edition of the Kanjur omits the larger version).The principle of the ‘explanatory tantras’ seems to be a"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 89consistency of terminology. Such works> should employ the same names of deities and treat some major subjects of the basic tantra of the Guhyasamdja. The one which most qualifies as such is of course the Sandhivydkarana because it does expand on the Guhyasamdja chapter by chapter for the first twelve chapters, and then itself comes to an end. O f course, other Tantras of the Anuttarayoga-tantra class have much material in common, but their departure in terminology makes it difficult to equate their subject matter. Tson-kha-pa, who commented on the chief Father Tantra, the Guhyasamdja, and the chief Mother Tantra, the Sri-Cakrasamvara, frequently has remarks which correlate these two extensive sets of tantric literature. I made a modest attempt at this too in my “ Female Energy. . . . ” article, showing the equivalence of the Father Tantra vocabulary ‘Mother,’ ‘Sister,’ ‘Daughter’ with the Mother Tantra vocabulary ‘To­gether-born female,’ ‘field-born female,’ and ‘incantation-born femaje’.As we pass from those revealed tantric works to the exege- tical literature, we should note that the former are written in strict anonymity and attributed to divine authorship, while in the case of the latter, the writers are pleased to attach their names to commentarial literature and elaborate rituals which have taken centuries to develop. Before it is possible even tentatively to ascribe dates to the revealed literature, we must do the same for the commentarial works, and here we note that some scholarly confusion already has set in. It simply is not possible yet to pinpoint with accuracy the date of Nagarjuna as 645 A.D., the date given by B. Bhattacharyya in the introduction (p. xxx) to his edition of the Guhyasamdja, A helpful attempt is Rahula Sankrtyayana’s geneological tree of the eighty- four Siddhas and list of the Siddhas in Journal Asiatique, Oct. Dec., 1934, pp. 218-225. Professor Giuseppe Tucci has given his lists and tentative dates of Siddhas in Tibetan Painted Scrolls, I, pp. 227-232. The Japanese scholar Hakuyu Hadano, in Tohoku Daigaku Bungaku-bu Kenkyu-nempo, No. 9 (1958), pp. 58-18, thoroughly discusses the traditions of King Indrabhuti.Although the attempt involves trepidation, some chrono­logical layers can be worked out through textual analysis and other considerations.1.

In a negative way, no works are extant composed with their names by the first persons in the Guhyasamaja lineage list (Tibetan tradition), namely Indra­bhuti the Great, NagayoginI, and King ViSukalpa (per Tsoh- kha-pa, Vol. 158, p. 178-1, 2): i-ndra-bhu-ti chen po dan kluhi rnal hbyor ma dan sa bdag bi-su-ka-lpas gzhuh mdzadpa ni hdi na mi snan la /). There is a legendary account in The Blue Annals (I, pp. 359-60) :The adepts of the (Guhya)samaja agree that the Guhya- samajatantra had been preached by the Munindra himself, following a request of Indrabhuti, the great king of Oddlyana, at the time when the Buddha had manifested himself in Oddlyana and initiated (the king). There­upon the king and his retinue practised the Tantra by means of the prapafica-carya (spros spyod) and became initiates (Vidyadhara—one who has attained spiritual realization or siddhi, grub pa), and the country of Oddi- yana became deserted. After that a yoginl, who had descended from the realm of the Nagas, heard it (i.e. the Tantra) from (king) Indrabhuti and taught it to king ViSukalpa of the Southern country. The maha-brah- mana Saraha heard it from him and taught it to acarya Nagarjuna. The latter had many disciples, but the chief ones were the four: Sakyamitra, Aryadeva, Nagabodhi, and Candrakirti.Tson-kha-pa (op. cit., p. 178-2), right after the mention of those first persons whose Guhyasamaja works do not exist (at least under their names), goes bn to mention, what in this context should be the first work by an historical personnage, the Guhya- siddhi, whose authorship he assigns to Sri-Mahasukhanatha (dpal mgon po bde ba chen po). This name is undoubtedly drawn from the verse cited from a manuscript of this work by S. B. Dasgupta, An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism, p. 156, note: Sri-mahasukha-nathasya pada-padmopajivina / racitali padma- vajrena sarvasattvanukampaya // . The author is well known by the name Padmavajra (who also has the name Devacandra, per Tucci, Vol. I, p. 232). He might be different from the disciple of Buddhaguhya (2nd half, eighth century) who com­mented on the Yoga-tantra. Tson-kha-pa states that the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Guhyctsiddhi establishes the meaning of the Samaja. It princi­pally establishes the nidana of the Guhyasamaja; and it teaches about the stages of the path : first, the Stage of Generation of placing syllables; second, on the basis o f‘Victory of the Rite’, one’s own intrinsic nature symbolizing reality; third, for the sake of relying on that, the contemplation with recourse to the Jfiana-mudra; fourth, the contemplation of mahamudra and abhisambodhi togetherwith the fourfold praxis. The Blue Annal$, I, p. 363, mentions besides this Guhyasiddhi, the work by King Indrabhuti, the Jhanasiddhi, as also based on the Guhya­samaja. Hence this must be a different Indrabhuti from the one who has no works on the Guhyasamaja. Tson-kha-pa also mentions that there exist no works by Saraha on the Guhya- samajatantra. About his time begin two lineages of Guhya­samaja commentarial tradition— the Arya school (hphags lugs) and the Jnanapada school (ye Ses zhabs lugs).(a^ The Arya school is headed by the tantric Nagarjuna, whose most important works in the tantric field are his own compositions, the Pindikrla-sadhana (especially for the Stage of Generation) and the Pancakrama (for the Stage of Completion), which became authoritative for the sequence of yoga. Besides, his commentary Affadafa-patala-vistara-vyakhya on the 18th chapter (the Uttara-tantra) remained the most important of any commentary on that chapter, probably because Candra- klrti’s Pradipoddyotana does not cover this part. His commentary Tantrafikd on the mula Guhyasamajalantra was overshadowed by the Pradipoddyotana. His Pindikrta-sadhana and Pancakrama were based on the Guhyasamajalantra, first 12 chapters, especially chapter Six and Twelve (‘Documents’) and the Explanatory Tantras Sandhivyakarana and Vajramala (although he also refers to the Caturdevipariprccha). He stressed the three lights and the Clear Light, the theory of eighty prakrlis or vikalpas going with three vijnanas, interpreted with Yogacara-tvpe vocabulary pro­bably adopted from the Lankdvatara-sutra. Nagarjuna’s Tantra- tikd is an attempt to explain the Guhyasamdjatantra on the basis of the utpatti-krama and sampanna-krama, as well as his five stages, which he refers repeatedly, the latter under the title Prakarana (rab tu byed pa) rather than Pancakrama. So in PTT, Vol. ■;9, he mentions all five krama by name at p. 200-5 and again 3.11 five beginning with ‘from the Prakarana (rab tu byed pa lasINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 91"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"92YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAkyaii) at p. 239-4; and has numerous quotations frqm Prakarana at pp. 214-4, 218-5, 226-5, 236-2, 243-5, 289-1, 300-3, etc. Also, Bhavyakirti’s iPrakdtika’ commentary on Pradipoddyotana, PTT Vol. 60, quotes the Pancakrama twice on p. 257-4, 5 as ‘Prakarana’, suggesting that he was consulting Nagarjuna’s Tantra\\ikd while writing his commentary on Candrakirti’s work. But the commentators on the Pancakrama itself do not call it '‘Prakarana!. An extensive commentarial literature arose on the basis of the Pancakrama. I have mainly employed Sri Laksmi’s commentary, because it adheres closely to the text commented upon without wild speculations, has a beautiful flow of language, and uses the nidana verses which are the basis of the present work. Another commentary which has supplied some important passages is the Manimald which the colophon and accordingly the catalogs ascribe to Nagabodhi. But this is hardly possible, because Nagabodhi is among the earliest in the lineage. The Manimald is the most developed of the Indian commentaries I examined. It employs the ‘six alternatives’ (safkoti) terminology, which was popularized by Gandraklrti. It is full of opinionated speculations, such as (PTT, Vol. 62, p. 160-2) equating, Nagarjuna’s five stages, vajrajapay etc., with the five paths (mdrga), prayoga, etc. of the Prajftaparamita exegesis. The fact that the respective descrip­tions in the two different literatures have virtually nothing in common does not bother the author of the Manimald, who makes up five reasons which need not be cited. A clue of identification is a certain frankness of language which the author has in common with Bhavyakirti, the author of the Prakdiikd commentary on Candrakirti’s Pradipoddyotana (see below). Thus in the Manimald {op. cit. p. 155-3, 4, 5 and next page) the author takes up the problem of what is meant by the ‘woman’, ‘m an’, and ‘androgyne’ of this literature. He mentions and rejects various opinions before giving his own. His remark about the usual theory of the ‘woman’ is precisely the remark given by Bhavyakirti in the Prakatikd (PTT, Vol. 61, p. 3-2), with alternate translation into Tibetan, where he rejects the view that a ‘woman’ is described by breasts and hair :If the feminine gender (.stri-linga) has breasts and hair, then mala (‘garlands’) and *svapndsani (‘beds’) would not have feminine gender, because they do not have"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRA 93breasts and hair.

But it would take the same person to make the identical remark, given above, in two books.In the Arya school, the tantric Candraklrti wrote the most eminent commentary on the mula Guhyasamdjatantra, called the Pradipoddyotana. Its main contribution is to classify commentariah statements on the Guhyasamdjatantra by a rigorous application of subdivisions of ‘Seven Ornaments5, a terminology stemming from the Vajrajnanasamuccaya) but which is merely referred to by Candraklrti as the ‘Explanatory Tantra5 (see the Section C, infra, for a summary exposition of the full twenty-eight subdivi­sions) and to avoid Yogácára terminology. The first commen­tary on his work may have been the primitive one by Laksmm- kará, sister of Indrabhuti, called the <‘Vi$amapada-paňjiká\\ The main commentary on the Pradipoddyotana, the ‘Prakdšiká' of Bhavyakirti (according to the Tohoku catalog; PTT catalog incorrectly gives author5s name as Aryadeva), seems intent on rebuking Candraklrti by restoring the Yogácára vocabulary pursuant to the indications of Nágárjuna5s works.In this tradition the greatest work on important phases of tantric praxis is Aryadeva5s Caryameldpaka-pradipa. Aryadeva is a tantric writer, no more to be identified with the celebrated Madhyamika author of the same name than are the tantrics Nágárjuna and Candraklrti. This tantric author Aryadeva also wrote a number of brief summary works of which now the most well-known is the Cittavišuddhiprakarana by reason of Prabhubhai B. Patel’s edition. Of all the later writers of this"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"‘Arya’ tradition of the Guhyasamâja cycle, Aryadeva gives the greatest literary impression of having actually ‘done it’.(b) The Jnànapàda school is named after Buddhasrljnâna, whose teacher Lïlavajra composed (in the Guhyasamâja class) only the Nidânagurüpadeta and does not appear to have made a distinction between the ‘Stage of Generation’ and the ‘Stage of Completion’ (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 178-3; slob dpon sgeg pahi rdo rjes rgyud kyi glen gzhihi béad pa tsam mdzad kyan/ rim gnis kyi lam gyi srol zur pa mi snari no / ). Buddha- ¿rïjnàna (see his legend in Roerich, The Blue Annals, I, pp. 367, if.) wrote works exemplifying both Stages: the Stage of Genera­tion in the Samanlabhadra-nàma-sàdhana (Tohoku No. 1855) and the Stage of Completion in the revealed Mukhdgama (Toh. No. 1853) and Muktiiilaka (Toh. No. 1859) based on that revelation (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 178-3). Buddhasrljnâna studied the Prajnàpàramità under the celebrated specialist Haribhadra, and this part of his training is quite evident in his tantric works. He adopted an interpretive position in which at each point the explanations of thé Guhyasamâja are tied in with Mahàyàna Buddhism, particularly of the Prajnàpàramità type. That kept, obviously Brahmanical doctrines from flowing into the syncretic tantric literature of his school. Perhaps partly due to his Buddhist piety, Buddhasrljnâna had great^ fortune of disciples. One of his direct disciples, Buddhaguhya, became a celebrated commentator on the Caryà-and Yoga-Tantra classes of tantric literature. Another one, Dïpankarabhadra is credited with a work of highest importance on ritual in the Stage of Generation, the Guhyasamâjamandalamdhi (Toh. 1865), often referred to as the “Four-hundred-and-fifty verses,” which has a ¡thd on it by Ratnàkaraéànti (Toh. No. 1871). This Dïpankarabhadra as well as Ràhulabhadra and some other direct disciples are credit­ed in legend with advanced success in the yoga of the Guhya­samâja, it being hinted that they did better than Buddhaéri- j flâna himself, who tried without success to generate the ‘diamond body’ (vajrakdya). Another disciple, named Vitapâda, wrote lengthy commentaries on the main works of the master. This school, at least as far as its literary products are concerned, does not bother with the topics of three lights and the Clear Light so prevalent in the works of the ‘Arya’ school. If the Jnànapàda school comes across a term in the Guhyasamdjatanira9 4 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÂJATANTRA"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"like iprakrtiprabhasvcra\\ it would be prone to explain it just as in non-tantric Buddhism, to wit ‘intrinsically clear’ (said of the pure consciousness); while a writer of the Arya school would be likely to say it means (in what is called the ‘pregnant sense’) ‘the Clear Light along with the (80 )prakjtis (of the three lights’). However, it may well be the case that theJnanapada school does not deny that ‘pregnant sense’ but reserves it for the oral tradi­tion, rigorously kept apart from the written works. The emphasis on the guru’s precepts is shown by the very title of that work of BuddhaSrijnana’s, the Mukhdgama ‘the tradition from the mouth’. Vitapada’s commentary on the master’s Muklitilaka carries on this same stress by a number of consistent remarks (PTT, Vol. 65, p. 134-5).* “ from thejnciuth of one’s own guru” (rah gi bla mahi kha nas. . . ibid, p. 135-2; “ ‘arisen in the lineage chain’ means recourse to the errorless path of the illustrious gurus” (brgyud rims las byun zhe$ pa ni bla ma dam pahi ma nor bahi lam du brten paho). Various commentaries on the mula-tantra belong to the Jnanapada school; probably the freedom from Candrakirti’s classifying terms in the later commentaries is the best indication o f inclusion in that school. The Jftanapada school took greater care with literary polish than the Arya school. It has been preeminent in works on the Guhyasamaja ritual, especially on the praxis of prdnaydma\\ and the writer Smrtijhanakirti of this school wrote a commentary on the Caturdevipariprccha, which is mainly devoted to prdndyama. The towering tantric com­mentator of the last period of Indian Buddhism, Abhayaka- ragupta, is said to have belonged to the Jftanapada lineage.The author RatnakaraSanti freely used both lineages in his own works, and his attitude is about what is found in Tibetan tantrism, where the followers of the Guhyasamaja cycle were glad enough to understand the Tantra and practice it in proper fashion, no matter which of the two lineages would contribute the most. In fact, both schools have an extensive literature on this Tantra, as extant in Tibetan translation. In the present work, products of the ‘Arya’ school are chiefly utilized for the simple reason that it is this school which is built around the position found in the forty nidana verses that ate the main instig­ation of the current research.

Tucci (I, p. 232) argues that we should accept the Tibetan tradition which makes Padmasambhava (middle eighth century) the disciple of a King Indrabhuti who therefore would fall in the period end of seventh to first half of eighth century. But Hadano {op. cit.) places Indrabhuti in the ninth century and Buddhajftanapada in the eighth century. O f course, to reconcile the positions we should posit two Indrabhuti’s. The first Indrabhuti would be the one associated with Oddiyana, who has no works on the Guhya­samaja, but could well be the author of the great commentary on the Sarjiputa-tilaka in the Mother Tantra tradition, just as Saraha, his junior, wrote commentaries on other Tantras, such as the Buddhakapala-Tantra, but no distinguishable work on the Guhyasamaja. Saraha is placed by Sahkrtyayana as a contem­porary of King Dharmapala (769-809). The lama Taranatha, in his tales of the Siddhas, calls the second Indrabhuti Tndra- bhuti the junior’. He could be the Indrabhuti of Orissa (Odivisa) whom Sahkrtyayana considered to be the only Indrabhuti. His master is Anangavajra, and the latter’s teacher Padmavajra. This would be the Padmavajra who wrote the Guhyasiddhi. His spiritual grandson Indrabhuti would be the one who wrote the Jtldnasiddhi. Padmavajra would fall in the second half of the eighth century, just as do both the tantric Nagarjuna of the Arya school and Buddhagrijfiana of thejhana- pada school. In the ninth century comes Candrakirti, author of Pradlpoddyotana, as well as the second Indrabhuti who has a sister Laksm lnkara; and also, probably, Aryadeva. This is easily the first half of the ninth, as maintained by (Miss) Malati J. Shendge, ed. Advayasiddhi (Baroda, 1964), p. 11, in agreement with Snellgrove and Sahkrtyayana. The Kashmi­rian Sri Laksmi is probably not the same person as Laksmlh- kara. Tilopa belongs to the tenth century because he is the guru of Naropa who died in 1027, and the latter is a contemporary of Ratnakarasanti. Guhyasamaja commentaries continued .to be written through the twelfth century, as is deducible from translations into Tibetan. Thus, the Tanjur Guhyasamaja cycle of commentarial literature is composed between the eighth and twelfth centuries."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Once we place the cpmmentarial literature, the way is open to approach the more tenuous clues for solving the problem of the revealed Tantras of the Kanjur. The tradition reported from Taranatha that the Tantras were transmitted in utmost secrecy for 300 years before being rendered somewhat more public by the Siddhas (cf. B. Bhattacharyya, Intro, xxxv), would lead us to a fifth century A.D. time which is not unreason­able, even though we should be unhappy to have so little data to go on. The early fifth century is the creative period of Asanga (circa 375-430 A.D.), but I have rejected the never- substantiated attribution of the Guhy as amdjat antra to his author­ship in my Analysis of the SravakabhUmi Manuscript, p. 39^ on the basis of my studies in his known works (which include the Sanskrit prose commentary on the Sutrdlamkdra, but not the basic verses) and repeat my rejection here as a consequence of the intervening investigation of the Guhyasamaja literature. Not for the reason that the Guhyasamdjatantra is unworthy of Asanga, rather that it is impossible of Asanga, and further—to mention an extrinsic reason— tantric commentators do not quote from Asanga’s or his brother Vasubandhu’s works to justify basic tantric ideas! Rather they quote the Lankdvatdra-sutra for their Yogacara-type vocabulary, and this sutra was first translated into Chinese in 443 A.D. and in the fifth century had become so popular among Indian Buddhists that it was the chief text of Bodhidharma when he came to China in either 520 A.D. or 527 A.D. (the alternate dates of the Sino-Japanese tradition).We can strengthen this tentative attribution to the fifth century by considering some further materials of the Vajramdla which, besides being the source of our nidana verses, contains many other passages of supreme importance for understanding the Guhyasamaja cult. In my “Studies in Yama and M ara,” pp. 70-73,1 show from a work of Tson-kha-pa that the Vajramdla converts the Visnu Avatar doctrine, at least the first five Avatars, into a kind of esoteric embryology, namely that in the first five lunar months of uterine existence, the body has succes­sively the forms offish, tortoise, boar, lion, and dwarf. Now this doctrine is set forth in Vajramdla*s Chapter X X X II, which also contains Yogacara vocabulary tied in with the terminology of the Lankdvatdra-sutra. As an example of this terminology in the Vajramdla, I may cite PTT, Vol. 3, p. 214-5, line 6 : “ theINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 97"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"9 8 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJ AT ANTRAsecret state of the eight-vijiiana set” (/ rnam ses brgyad kyi tshogs dben pa / ). In that article, p. 71, note, I mention, “ Miss Kamala Ray, ‘The Ten Incarnations of Visnu in Bengal*, IHQ,, Vol. XV (1941), pp. 370-85, explains that while the Avatara theory is very ancient, the standard list is more modern, and (p. 373) ‘Epigraphic evidences testify to the exis­tence of this theory from the 5th century A.D. onwards (in Bengal).” ’ This suggests that at the time the standard list of ten incarnations became publicized, an esoteric tradition was developing concerning these incarnations as represented, at least the first five, by intra-uterine states.Furthermore, in the previous introductory section, ‘The world of light5, I put forward the striking hypothesis that both the set of thirty-three female prakrtis and forty male prakrtis listed under nidana verses nos. 1 and 2 can be interpreted as breaking down into five groups in each set, the first set especially going with the five stages of the Vaisnava path to union with the Lord Krsna (presuming there was once a faith in such a '‘path’). If the sets of prakrtis have their origin in a syncretism with Vaisnavism, then the fact that later on the commentators on the Paiicakrama (from which the lists of prakrtis are drawn) have no inkling, as far as the texts are concerned, of how to subdivide the sets of prakrtis, indicates thai,some time must have elapsed between the adoption of this vocabulary in an esoteric oral way and the more public commentarial tradition. We must grant that any conclusion about this matter must be of a highly speculative nature, since the early syncretisms cf Buddhism and Vaisnavism are obscure, and since the erotic type of Krsna worship is usually placed at a considerably later date than what we are now considering (fifth century, A.D.;.What I do maintain is that the Vajramald has the earmarks of having been composed centuries before the tantric Nagar- juna quoted it in his Paiicakrama, and I tentatively place it in the fifth century. The Sandhivyakarana should tentatively be placed at about the same time, since it shows the same definite style of authoritative revealed literature. The other explana­tory tantras can be roughly placed there also, subject to larer investigations.The above considerations leave open a date for the Guhya- samajatanlra itself. This problem cannot be separated from the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRA 99dating of all the main revealed Buddhist Tantras preserved in Tibetan translation in the Kanjur, because there is certainly a great deal of common material to be found in all these Tantras; as well as from the dating of the Šaivitic and Vaisnava dgamas. I see no reason for denying it a century’s priority to the Vajramdld; and so, on a purely tentative basis, ascribe the Guhyasamdjatantra to the fourth century, A.D. But a decision on this matter requires solution of other problems of Indian literary history.I am well aware that the kind of reasoning employed above might be challenged by the scholars who insist on a later date for the Guhyasamdjatantra, in fact placed just prior to the historical commentaries on it. Therefore, I take the liberty of quoting extensively from my article in the Golden Jubilee Volume of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, “Early Literary History of the Buddhist Tantras, especially the Guhya­samaja-tantra” :“What is significant about the two commentarial traditions is precisely that there are two, with many differences within «each of these traditions. Just as the Sautrántika and Vaibhá- sika of noh-tantric Buddhism could not have arisen fully-grown, in the form in which we know them, in the century immediately following the passing of the Buddha, so also the ‘Arya School* and the ‘Jříánapáda School’ could not have arisen in the century immediately following the composition of the Guhyasamaja, let alone, the very same century! Indeed, any one who.even partially surveys the Guhyasamaja literature as extant in Tibetan and, notes the remarkable variance in explanation of a given passage of the basic Tantra, would experience at least a mild shock at the flimsy reasons given for a late dating of the Guhya- samdja. One example will be given to show what is meant, and this case is particularly chosen for a context where one would expect minimal variation between the commentaries because the expression to be explained is merely the ‘three kinds’ of each sense object as mentioned without explanation in the basic tantra of Guhyasamaja, Chap. 7:Arya school:Nagarjuna’s Tantra\\ikd on Guhyasamaja (Derge ed., Sa, f. 105b-7); (form, the object of sight) ‘has the nature of outer, inner, and both’ (phyi daňnaň daň gňi gahi raň bzhin)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Candraklrti’s Pradipoddyotana on Guhyasamaja (Derge ed., Ha, f. 49a-5): (form, the object of sight) ‘should be perceived and comprehended as inferior, intermediate, and superior’ (dman pa daň bar ma daň mchog gsum du mam par íes šiň rtogs pa) ; in Tson-kha-pa’s Mckan-hgrel on the Pradipoddyotana (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 55-3), we learn that the superior kind is the Buddha going with that sense object, e.g. Vairocana as form; (p. 56-1, form is also of three kinds, pleasurable, repulsive or displeasing^ and neutral).Jnanapada School:Prasántajñána’s Upadešá-nišcaya on Guhyasamaja (PTT, Vol. 63, p. 64-5); the three kinds are superior (lust), intermediate (delusion), and inferior (hatred),*Celu-pá’s Ratnavrkfa-náma-rahasya-samája-vrtti (PTT, Vol. 63, p. 183-5): inferior, intermediate, and superior.Jinadatta’s Pañjikd-náma on Guhyasamaja (PTT, Vol.63, p. 259-1) : “ Because one discerns it as having the nature of superior, and so on, there are three kinds ; having the nature of outer, inner, and both, means “ non-apprehen­sion” (anupalabdhi), so one should ^understand it by the nature of three gates to liberatiori, of voidness, etc.’ (mchog la sogs pahi raň bzhin du brtags pahi phyir m am gsum mo I phyi daň naň daň gňi gahi bdag ñid mi dmigs pa ste / stoň pa ñid la sogs pahi rnam par thar pahi sgo gsum gyi ňo bos rtogs par byaho /).Ratnákaras ánti’s Kusumáňjali-guhyasamája-nibandha- náma (Vol. 64, p. 127-1): the three kinds mean the respective offerings by the three kinds of yogins, the one of lust, of delusion, and of hatred.Smrtijñánakírti’s Sriguhyasamdja-tantrardja-vrtti (PTT, Vol. 66, p. 132-3): ‘The “ three kinds” means that one knows (the object) as the three gates to liberation, the signless, etc.’Anandagarbha’s Šri-guhyasamája-mahdtantrarája- tiká(PTT, Vol. 84, p. 127-4, 5): ‘The three kinds are outer, inner, and secret.

He goes on to take the outer as three, which multiplied by the five sense objects yields the number fifteen, and does the same for the inner or personal, and for the secret which involves the prajňá-updya union. In each case, the three are the Buddha, the' Bodhisattva, and the Devi, associated with that object by the triad of perception, sense organ and sense pbject, i.e. for form, the three are the Buddha Vairocana, the Bodhisattva K?itigarbha, and the Devi Rupavajrá.4‘There are three main sources for the various comments cited above. One is the Explanatory Tantra Samdhivydkarana, which is a verse paraphrase, with slight enlargement, of the first twelve chapters of the Guhyasamdjatantra. In its treatment of Chap. 7, it states (PTT, Vol, 3, p. 240-3):I naň daň de bzhin phyi rol dan / giii ga rjes su mi dmigs pa/I gzugs la sogs gsum deyin te / lha mams la ni dbul bar byall The three kinds of form and other sense objects are the non-apprehension of inner, outer, and both; one should offer those to the gods.“ The next source is the Explanatory Tantra Vajramdld, which states in what I call the 'nidana-kárikď, no. 19 : sthatavyaiji vifayefv asmádyoginádvayadaršiná / hinamadhyapranite$u jňánatrayanidaršanát //Afterwards the yogin who sees the non-duality should be dwelling upon sense objects ‘inferior’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘superior’ by seeing the triple gnosis.“ The third source is the uttara-tanlra (18th chap. of the Sanskrit text, p. 158) :rupašabdádayah kdmdh sukhaduhkhobhayatmakah / janayanti hrdaye nityarji rágadve$atamodayam 11 The ‘desires’ (i.e. the 5 strands of desire, paňcakámaguna) ‘form’, ‘sound’, etc.—pleasurable, painful, and neutral— continually generate in the heart, (respectively), the source of ‘lust’, ‘hatred’, and ‘delusion’.“With all that information at hand, it is easy to see thatINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 101"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAsome commentators relied especially on the Vajramdla, some especially on the Samdhivydkarana, some especially on the uttara- tantra\\ and then some commentators tried to harmonize two different terminologies of ‘three kinds” by taking it as ‘three times three5, i.e. three each of each three. The Samdhivydkarana expression ‘non-apprehension5 suggested to some commentators the non-tantric doctrines of ‘Perfection of Insight5 (prajha- paramita) with its stress on voidness (.§unyatd), so they saw an opportunity to make contact with non-tantric Buddhism by the well-known set of Buddhism, the three gates to liberation (trini vimokfa-mukhajii), that is, the voidness (funyatd-), the undirected (apranihita-), and the signless (animitta-) gates. When one lakes into account that these commentaries vary much more in most other places, where the Guhyasamaja passages are not restricted by such concrete objects as the sense objects, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that some centuries of oral tradition have intervened between the basic Guhyasamdjatantra and the eighth century when the ‘historical5 writers began to appear on the scene. O f course, if the basic Tantra had been concocted by the first commentator, or had been composed just prior to his writing activity, there should not have been any question of what the ‘three kinds5 \\yere. Instead the com­mentators might have differed only in their metaphorical inter­pretation of the standard ‘three kinds5.55Another conclusion one may draw from the evidence of the above extract is that it is hazardous to try to understand the Guhyasamdjatantra just from reading it. Who, reading the phrase ‘three kinds of form5, would know what the three kinds are, unless someone told him ?Now turning our consideration to the forty nidana verses, since they are a part of the Vajramdla, and no evidence has turned up to suggest their later addition, we may, pursuant to the above reasoning, place these verses also in the fifth century, A.D. Alamkakalasa5s commentary on the Vajramdla, which is extant in the Tanjur, does not comment all the way up to the chapter which contains the forty verses. The verses are cited in thePradipoddyotana without further explanation except for the classifying term ‘pregnant sense5 (garb hy-art ha). The only Indian commentary on the Pradipoddyotana translated into Tibetan that generously treats these verses with comments is Bhavya-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 103kirti’s PrakaHka. This is a highly opinionated commentary, but I found it worthwhile citing in several places.Later, in Tibet, Caridraklrti’s work was highly prized. A commentarial tradition arose which did not neglect the 40 verses. The Tibetan Bu-ston’s commentary on the Pradipod­dyotana (Vol. Ta of his collected works, published by Lokesh Chandra in Part Nine) must have been eagerly greeted by Tibetan monks when it first appeared, probably as the first native commentary on that work by an eminent authority on the Tantras. He continues the Madhyamika tone of commen­tary in the same manner as the Pradipoddyotana itself, that is, in a negative way by avoidance of the typical Yogacara vocabulary found in many other commentaries, especially in the Pancakrama tradition. Bu-ston has various disagreements with Bhavya- klrti’s commentaries (the main one and the smaller one) and with K um ara’s commentary on the Pradipoddyotana, as also with unnamed teachers (“ Some persons say...” ). Bu-ston com­ments topically, not sentence by sentence in the order of occur­rence in Candrakirti’s work. This mode of commentary is not original, for some of the Indian commentaries are of this type. In line with this sort of commentary, he does not com­ment on the 40 verses in their order, but topically. So after some remarks for the first four verses, going with E-vam ma-ya, he begins to jump around, although in the end accounting for almost all the verses. The Tibetan commentary on the Guhya- samiija by Kun-dgah-don-hgrub (the “ M an nag rim gfiis gter mdzod” ), recently reprinted in India, contains the 40 verses almost at the beginning, and in section KA, f. 37a-b (pp. 73-74), also treats the 40 verses topically and with extreme brevity. These topical groupings are of no help to me in the present work, because I shall treat the verses in their order, to fully bring out the author’s intentions as an individual composi­tion. The commentarial tradition on Gandraklrti’s work culminated in Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel (annotation in smaller writing in between the words or phrases) in the early fifteenth century. The Pradipoddyotana had been first translated by the Indian pandit Sraddhakaravarma and the great Tibetan trans­lator Rin-chen-bsan-po (958-1055); Tson-kha-pa used this translation as well as ‘the two new translations’ (Mchan hgrel, p. 91-4). Tson-kha-pa’s annotation has evidence that he had"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAread Bu-ston’s work and continued many of his ideas, but Tsop- kha-pa’s treatment is far advanced. He knew that in order for a commentary to be useful, it had to follow the order of the original work. So does his annotation (Mchan hgrel) on the Pradipoddyotana, and his Mihah gcod on the individual chapters. His Don gsal ba on the Guhyasamaja follows the order of the three mandalas ; and his Dban gi don follows the order of the mandala- rite. Thereby his works were of great convenience for me to consult, and it must have been the same for the Tibetans. There can be little doubt that the Guhyasamajatantrd reached an ad­vanced and m ature interpretation in Tibet at the hands of the great teachers Bu-ston, Tsoň-kha-pa, and others.*♦After the present work was completed, I became indebted to Serkong Rimpoche, Assistant Tutor to H. H. the Dalai Lama, for allowing me to secure a copy of a text just reprinted in North India for restricted circulation. This is by Šes-rab-seri-ge, a disciple of Tsofi-kha-pa—a commentary on Candraklrti’s Pradipoddyotana in its Tibetan version. This native work is a remarkable piece of popularization of a Tantric topic, which I believe was composed after the death of Tsóň-kha-pa, his teacher. The author appears to have taken as basis Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel annotation on the Pradipoddyotana, incorporating the annotation into the text commented upon in a lucid paraphrase which, however, omits thorny points and then adds citations from other works, Tantric and non-Tantric. The author cons­tantly rationalizes with remarks like “don ni” (“tl^e meaning is a&follows“ ). In illustration, in the course of Chap. One commentary, his explanation of the forty verses is approximately a paraphrase of Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel on those verses, but omits mention of Tson-kha-pa’s difficult comment on Švu. In Sec. Ka, f. 45b to 46a-6, he has various ways of grouping the verses (which Tsoň-kha-pa did not present in his commentary), but gives no solution for the order of the verses from 1 to 40. In Sec. Nga, f. 41a, he points out that pratyáhára and dhyana (the first two of the six-memberedyoga) are included in “arcane body” (T. lus dbcn)—which is Tson-kha-pa’s posi­tion. It is this position that is the chief clue for solving the order of the forty verses, that is,if one tries to accommodate this position within the forty verses, especially with the }Ca-Ta (Body) verses. It is good that this fascinat­ing work is receiving its due appreciation from the Gelugpa Lamas who specialize in Tantra. Besides, the Tibetans have recently reprinted works by Mkhas-grub-rje and by the First Panchen Lama on aspects of the Guhyaiaviája cult. I have made an important observation about the latter two works in my Appendix 2. In any case, my policy of relying on the Master Tsoň-kha-pa, rather than on the derivative literature of his followers, should be appreciated by the present-day Gelugpa monks, who can scarcely deny that Tsoň-kha-pa was as much a Lama (guru) as any that can be met today."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"B. The title of the work and its opening sentence (niddna)The full title as found at the ends of chapters in the edited text is: Sarvatathdgatakdyavdkcittarahasydtirahasyaguhyasamdjamahd- guhyatantrardja. The following translation of the title will be justified: Great-secret King of Tan tras—the ‘Secret tjnion’ of the secret and the greater secret belonging to the Body, Speech and M ind of all the Tathágatas.Vitapada’s commentary Mukhdgama-vrtti (PTT, Vol. 65, p. 66-4) explains some of the construction of the title: “ ‘Tantra of samaja by all the Buddhas’ means Vajradhara because it is the union (samaja) by all the Buddhas in the manner of para- mdrtha and saijivrti. To show that, there is ‘Thus’ (evarp,). ‘Great secret’ (mahdguhya) means the illusory (mdyopama). ^Secret’ (rahasya) means the Stage of Generation. ‘Greater secret’ (atirahasya) means the thusness of all modes. The great dgama which incomparably shows those matters, is the Samaja”J7 saůs rgyas kun gyis hdus pahi rgyud ces pa ni / saňs rgyas thams cad don dam pa daň kun rdzob kyi tshul du hdus palii phyir rdo rje hchaň baho / de ston par byed pa la yaň de skad ces byaho / gsaň chen £es pa ni sgyu ma lta buho / gsaň la £es pa bskyed pahi rim paho / ches gsaň ba žes pa ni dňos po thams cad kyi de bžin ňid do / de rnams ston par byed pahi goň na med pahi luň chen po ni hdus paho / ). This commentary makes it clear that the compound rahasyatirahasya is a dvandva, to be understood by such pairs as samvrti-satya and paramdrtha- satya; Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion. By bringing in the expression ‘Thus’ (^am),Vitapada also indicates the relation between the title and the first sentence of the Tantra which begins with evaiji.The most important part of the title is the expression guhyasamaja, because this is the standard abbreviated form of the title, which in turn is abbreviated to samaja.

To these three Tathagata families are added Amoghasiddhi and Ratnasambhava to make a total of five Tathagatas, the usual meaning of ‘all the Tathagatas’.In the second paragraph after verse 3 of chapter one, there occurs the expression sarvatathagatanam kayavdkcittaguhyanx, on which the Pradipoddyotana comments (Mchan hgrel, p. 24): I sarvatathagatanam kayavakcittaguhyam samayasam- varadikulatrayaparinamah / aksararthah 11 sarvatathaga- tanam kayavakcittaguhyam vyanjana [trayam] / samas- langah // sarvatathagatanam kayavakcittaguhyam jnana- trayaprakrtyabhasavayuvahanam / garbhi 11 sarvatatha­gatanam kayavakcittaguhyam jnanamayadehah/kolikah//"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"‘The secret of the body, speech and mind of ail theTatha- gatas5 means the extending to the three families of pledges, vows,and so on; invariant sense.‘The secret of the body...’ means the three syllables (for generating the, deities); shared sense. ‘The secret of the body...5, means the wind- vehicle for the appearance of the (eighty) prakftis upon the three lights; pregnant sense. ‘The secret of the body,..5, means the body made of knowledge; ultimate sense.The foregoing should demonstrate the multiple levels of interpretation that can be, and were extended to the words of the title.The length of the opening sentence (niddna) is established by theory that it demonstrates the ‘five perfections’, that is to say, of the teaching, the retinue, the time, the teacher, and the place.

There is the simple paraphrase, with a few words added, as in Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel on the Pradipoddyotana (bracketted expressions from Mchan hgrel, pp. 11 and 12):Thus by me it was heard (directly, not from an interme­diary; but not yet comprehended)—on an occasion (not with another element of consciousness; not at an­other time; and in a single instant)— theBhagavat (hav­ing the six allotments, lordliness, etc.) was dwelling (with the dress of a cakravartin) in the bhagas (destruc­tion of defilement) of the diamond ladies (the prajna view of voidness attended with great ecstasy* mahdsukha) of the heart (M ahavajradhara) belonging to the Body, Speech, and M ind of all the Tathagatas.T hat paraphrase is consistent with Indrabhuti’s explanation in his Jndnasiddhi (GOS, p. 81): / evam maya srutam ekasmin samaye bhagavan sarvatathagatakayavakcittahrdayavajrayo - §idbhagesu vijahara ekasminn eva kale / bhagavan aisvaryadi- gunayuktatvat / hrdayam jnanam tad eva vajrayo§it abhedya- prajnasvabhavatvat, tad eva bhagam sarvakle£abhafijanat, te§u sarvatathagatakayavakcittahrdayavajrayosidbhagesuvijahara / “Thus by me it was heard—upon an occasion— the Lord was dwelling in the bhagas of the diamond ladies of the heart belonging to the Body, Speech, and M ind of all the Tatha - gatas,r :— ‘on precisely that occasion, the Lord, because endowed with the (six) merits of lordliness and so on; was dwelling in those bhagas of the diamond ladies of the heart belonging to the Body, Speech, and M ind of all the Tathagatas, where the diamond ladies are precisely the heart-knowledge, because ol the self-existence of non-dual insight, and where the bhaga is precisely the same, because of destroying all defilement.”The Explanatory Tantra of the Guhyasamaja called Samdhi- vydkarana re-tells the niddna in this revealing # manner (PTT, Vol. 3, p. 231-4), labelled lkolika’ (ultimate sense) for the por­tion cited in Pradipoddyotana (Mchan hgrel, p. 17-5 to p. 18-1):INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 10 9"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"110YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAI punar aparam árya-vyákhyánam aha / evam mayá šrutarp tattvam ekasmin samaye sphute / bhagaván guhyavajrešas trivajrasamayottama(h) // sarvatathágate jňáne acintyagunasampadi / sadasadubhayátíte asthánasthitisamjfiini // akasaikasvabhave’smin sarvajnajnánabhávini / jagaddhrdi visuddhákhye vijahára mahámunih //(end of quotation).I ma rig pa daň hdu byed daň /I rnam par ses daň miň daň gzugs /I skye mched drug daň reg pa daň /I tshor ba daň ni sred pa daň //I ňer len srid pa skye ba daň /I rga ši šes bya rig ma yin If I ňa rgyal che bahi ňa rgyal daň /I ňaho sňam ňa rgyal mňon ňa rgyal // g^an yaň ňa rgyal las ňa rgyal // cuň zad ňa rgyal log par bcas //Furthermore, the ‘Árya-Vyákhyána’ states :Thus, the Reality, was heard by me on a certain time extraordinary.TheBhagavat, diamond lord of mysteries, with the supreme pledge of the triple vajra,Was dwelling as the M ahámuni in the pure heart of the world, in this unique self-existence of sky having the modes of omniscient knowledge, in the all-Tathagata gnosis having the inconceivable perfection of merits; beyond existence, non-existence, and both, called ‘place of no location*.The wisdom (vidyd) (there) is the knowable of nescience (avidya), motivations (sarjiskara), perceptions (vijMna), name-and-form (ndma-r¿ipa), six sense bases (fadayaiana), contact (sparfa), feelings (vedand), craving (tpna), indul­gence (upadána), gestation (bhava), birth (jdti)> old age and death (jard-marana) ; and (th a t‘place of no location’) has pride (mdna), haughty pride (atimána), ‘I am ’-pride (<asmimdna), assuming pride (abhimdna), pride over pride (mandtimdna), begrudging pride (unamana), along with the perverse kind (jjiithydmdna)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJ AT ANTRA 1 1 1T he Samdhivydkarana represents the place where the Bhagavat was dwelling to be the ‘Nirvana without fixed abode* (apratifthi- tar\\xrvdna); his consort, the vidya, to be the instantaneous vision of all twelve members of Dependent Origination (pratitya- samutpada) headed by nescience (avidya); and his pride, the standard seven kinds mentioned by Abhidharma-koia (V. 10). Apparently what is meant is that ordinary persons can have one pride or several in combination, but it is superhuman to have all seven. The pride thereby becomes the ‘divine pride’ (devata-garva).Another re-telling of the niddna is quoted by Candraklrti from an (unnamed) Explanatory Tantra (understood in Tibetan tradition to be the Devendrapariprccha)— it was immediately preceded by the Devendrapariprccha passage on E-vam—and is here edited from the Pradipoddyotana manuscript and transla­ted with some Mchan hgrel (p. 14-1,2) expansion :maya srutam iti proktam cakravartisvarupina / bljarupena yat srstam devatacakram uttamam // paramanandakalo’sau ekam samaya ucyate / astaisvaryena bhagavan mahasukhapade sthitah // sarvatathagatah proktah pancaskandha jinair iha / tadatmakayavakcitto hrdvajro’sau mahasukhah // yositsusamskrta mudra bhagam padmam susamskrtam/ vijahara sthitas tatra bindurupena vajradhrk //The words ‘by me was heard* are pronounced by the true form (the bodhicitta in father-mother union) of the Wheel-turner (cakravartin).

Tn five-part m anner’ presumably means as five Tathagatas; and ‘circle of ten ladies’, the five principal and five ancillary winds. The pregnant sense of the nidana in terms of ‘winds’ is further borne out by Guhyasamajd, Chap. I, p. 3: / atha khalu aksobhyas tathagaljah sarvatathagata-kayavakcittahrdaya-vajrayosidbhagesu caturas- ram virajaskam mahasamayamandalam adhisthapayam asa / I svaccham ca tatsvabhavam ca nanarupam samantatah /I buddhameghasamaklrnam sphulingagahanajvalam /I svacchadimanxjalair yuktam sarvatathagalam p u ra m // The translation is aided by Mchan hgrel (p. 20-4, 21-1, 2, and 81-4) :Then, you know, (the officiatit= ) Aksobhya Tathagata (= vijfidna-skandha and lord of the three lights or the three jfianas) blessed the four-cornered dustless mandala of ‘Great Pledge’ in the bhaga-s ( = the Clear Light resorted to by illustrious persons) of the diamond ladies (=»the Clear Light) of the heart belonging to the Body, Speech, and Mind of all the Tathagatas— ‘on all levels with diverse forms, both clear and the self-existence, of clarity, pervaded by a Buddha-cloud that thickly blazes with (five) tongues of flame (= the five ancillary winds), (each) full of all the (five) Tathagatas associated with the mandalas of clarity ( = Light), etc. ( =Spread-of-Light and Gulmination-of-Light).’Here the rays of the five ancillary winds are each multiplied by five, to be compared with the twenty-five twisted threads called jnana-sutra in the mandala-rite described in Mkhas grub rje’s Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras. Each Buddha is associated with a certain color and symbolized by a thread of that color."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"O n the other hand, the literal form of the niddna is doubt­lessly challenging, since the word bhaga often has the meaning of ‘female organ*. Therefore, the Vajrajnanasamuccaya (PTT, Vol. 3, p. 253-1) has this passage :The Bhagavat spoke: ‘TheSravakas and so on, unliberatcd from the discursive impressions of practising the law free from passion {yiragadharma),. became astonished to hear the diamond words (vajrapada) of the Maha- yoga-tantras—“was dwelling in the bhaga(s)of the ladies” —which exemplify the doctrine of lust (ragadharma). The explanation which does not conflict with their aspira­tions is said to be the explanation as the shared sense. The last sentence (smon par byed pa de rnams daii mi hgal bahi sgo nas bsad pa de ni spyihi don du b3ad. pa gsuns paho) can be clarified with Candraklrti’s classifying terms, as set forth below. The Tantra is here alluding to. the sense shared with non-tantric Buddhism. Assuming an explanation of the nidanQ, is forthcoming concordant with ordinary Buddhism, we assume such is the explanation in Tson-kha-pa’s paraphrase presented above and Indrabhuti’s brief expansion. The Samdhivyakarana’s re-telling seems also to represent the ‘shared sense*. The explanations in terms of winds and in terms of the three lights and Clear Light should be considered as the un­shared sense, especially unshared with non-tantric Buddhism.C. The seven ornaments and subdivisionsAlso fundamental to this tantric system is that there are levels of interpretation of the basic Tantra, a difference of ex­planation in accordance with the listeners, and a determined categorization of the sentences of the Tantra. Herein lies the great contribution of Candraklrti’s Pradipoddyotana employment of the classificatory twenty-eight subdivisions of the ‘Seven Ornaments*, a terminology stemming from the Vajrajndtia- samuccaya-tantra. Some examples of this classification have already been presented in the foregoing sections, especially ‘pregnant sense*. At the end of the Pradipoddyotana, Candra- kirti suggests the reason for adopting this terminology by recall­ing: the Buddha’s dilemma immediately after his enlightenment, when he hesitated to teach his doctrine since it was too pro- fouhd for people at large. Yet the Buddha did begin to teachINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 1 1 ?"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"11 4YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAon the basis that persons were like lotuses—some were still in the mud, others had a stem reaching up, and a few had blossoms on the surface which needed sun warmth. So also, in the case of theT antra, one had to adapt the explanation to the particular stage of the candidate. Accordingly, the master had to know multiple explanations, so he could answer a disciple to his temporary satisfaction.For presenting below the gist of the classification, I employ the Pradipoddyotana manuscript which is somewhat chaotic at the beginning, Tson-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel on that work, and Sraddha- karavarman’s * VajrajHanasamuccaya-tantrodbhava-saptdlamkara-vimocana (restored title) (PTT, Vol. 60, pp. 138-139). Yukei M atsunaga has also studied this terminology in an article in Japanese, “ O n theSaptalam kara55 (March 1963).The seven ornaments are : 1. Introduction (T. glen bslan ba), 2. W ay (T. tshul), 3. Alternatives (T. mthah), 4.Ex- planation (T. biadpa), 5. Grouping (the auditors) (T. bsdus pa), 6. Persons (T. ganzag), 7.

As to the two interpretations, the Pradipoddyotana passage (Mchan hgrel, Vol. 158, p. 4) states that there are four parts to the Way of becoming a Buddha according to the doctrine free from lust (viragadharma) and four parts according to the doctrine of lust (ragadharma), as in the following tabulation:"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA115"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Viragadharma is of course based on the biography of Gautama Buddha.

The £nidana’ is his early life in the palace, reared by the nurses and then surrounded by the harem women, to­ward whom he had ‘virago.’ (aversion) and from whom he left for the religious life. The four parts seem to agree with the order of superintendence of the four goddesses who in chapter X V II implore the Lord to emerge from the Clear Light (see the section ‘Diamond Ladies of the H eart5); that is, they implored in the order Mind, Body, Speech, Acts.The third ornament, of Alternatives, amounts to six (sa(ko(i) in three pairs, which are : ‘hinted meaning’ (neyartha, dran b a hi don) and ‘evident meaning’ (nitartha, ties pa hi don); ‘twilight language’ (samdhya bhasa) and ‘non-twilight language’ (;no samdhya bhasd); ‘standard terminology’ (yatharuta), e.g. ‘mandala’, and coined terminology (no yatharuta), e.g. ‘kotakhya’ (pseudonym for one of the ten winds). There has been much scholarly discussion in the past on the meaning of the term samdhya bhasa (of which sarjidhi-bhasa is a form), and in the Renou memorial volume I defended my interpretation that it is ‘twilight language’.The fourth ornament, of Explanation of the sense of a given passage, is of four kinds (1) ‘invariant sense’ (aksarartha, yig don), (2) ‘shared sense’ (samastahgdrtiia, spyi don), (3) ‘preg­nant sense’ (garbhy-artha, sbas don), (4) ‘ultimate sense5 (koli- karlha, mthar thug don), in further explanation and breakdown as follows :1. ‘invariant sense5, i.e. literal meaning.2. ‘shared sense’, of two sorts :(a) sense shared with non-tantric Buddhism,(b) sense shared with the three lower Tantras.3. ‘pregnant sense5, of three sorts :(a) pregnant sense clarifying the doctrine of lust(ragadharma-prakaSana-garbhin),(b) pregnant sense revealing ‘conventional truth’(-Illusory Body) (samvrti-satya-sambo*dhagarbhin),(c) pregnant sense considering the three gnoses(jnanatraya-vicintana-garbhin).116 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"4. ‘ultimate sense’, of two sorts :(a) ultimate sense clarifying the Clear Light(prabhasvara-prakaS a-kolika),(b) ultimate sense revealing the paired-union(yuganaddha-prabodhana-kolika).The fifth ornament, of Grouping (the auditors), is of two kinds :— an assembly, to which ‘invariant sense’ and ‘shared sense’ among the four Explanations are taught; and disciples, to whom ‘pregnant sense’ and ‘ultimate sense’ among those four are taught.The sixth ornament, of Persons, means the five kinds of persons who receive initiation (abhi$eka) and adhere to pledges (samaya) and vows (samvara). They are called ‘jewel-like person’ (ratna-pudgala), the ‘blue-lotus’ (utpala), th e ‘white-lotus (pundarika), the ‘red-lotus’ (padma), and the ‘sandalwood’ (candana), each of which is defined in the Pradipoddyotana. In the notes to Mkhas grub rje’s Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras, pp. 218-9, Bhavyaklrti’s commentary was cited : “The ‘sandal- wood-like’ is in the family of fools; the ‘blue-lotus-like’ has in­ferior faculty (indriya); th e ‘white-lotus-like’ has intermediate faculty; the ‘red-lotus-like’ has keen faculty ; the ‘jewel-like’ has the most excellent of faculties.” The notes also cited the Thobyig gsal bahi me Ion (of Bio bzan hphrin las) showing the difference of instruction in terms of the six alternatives: theevident meaning, standard terminology, and twilight language are expressed to the ‘jewel-like person’. The other three alter­natives are expressed to the other four types of persons. In Sraddhakaravarman’s terminology of three kinds of Tantra, the five persons are called ‘causal tantra’ (hetu-tantra) because they are like seeds. Upon receiving initiation, they enter the ‘tantra of means’ {up ay a-t antra). First they attentively listen to the Tantra with ‘listening insight’ {Srutamayi prajhd) then study to attach meanings to the words with ‘thinking insight’(cintamayiprajna), whereupon with ‘cultivation insight’ {bhdvana- mayvprajna) they conceptualize in the ‘Stage of Generation’ and thenjdo the praxis in the ‘Stage of Completion’. The discussion about these persons in Tson-kha-pa’s Mthah gcod (on Chapter One) (PTT, Vol. 156, p. 33-2, 3) makes it clear that it is pre­cisely in terms of these three levels of ‘insight’ that the termi­nology of ‘faculty’ (inferior, etc.) is employed.INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAjATANTRA 117"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"1 L8 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAThe seventh ornament, of purpose [kárya), is the third kind of Tantra, called ‘fruitional tantra5 (phala-t antra), and is of two kinds, ordinary and superior.

The superior kind is the attainm ent by the ‘jewel-like person5 of the rank of Vajra- dhara, because that person having arrived at the limit of the Stage of Generation, rejects the ordinary siddhis, and goes on to the Stage of Completion for the high goal.Ratnákarašánti illustrates the classificatory vocabulary of the Pradipoddyotana in the Pindikrta-sadhanopayikd-vrtti-ratmvali,PTT, Vol. 62, p. 69-3, 4 :I sku rdo rje ni mam par snail mdzad do / / gsuň rdo rje ni hod dpag tu med pahi / / thugs rdo rje ni mi bskyod pa ste //yi gehi don to I I sku rdo rje niyi ge om mo I / gsuň rdo rje ni yi ge ah ho I I thugs rdo rje niyi ge hurji ste / / spyihi don to j j sku rdo rje ni rus sbal gyi rtsa daň / gsuň rdo rje ni zla bahi rtsa daň / thugs rdo rje hdod pahi gdugs kyi rtsa ste / sbas paho / / sku rdo rje ni chags pa daň / gsuň rdo rje ni chags pa daň bral ba dani thugs rdo rje chags pa bar ma ste / mthar thugs paho / / sku rdo rje ni khrag daň / gsuň rdo rje ni šu-kra daň / thugs rdo rje ni dri chab ste / dgoňs pas bšad paho / sku rdo rje ni snaň baho/ / gsuň rdo rje ni snaň ba mehedpaho / / thugs rdo rje ni snaň ba ňe bar thob pa ste / dgoňs pa mayin paho // sku rdo rje khru ňi šu pahi dkyil Júhor daň / gsuň rdo rje ni khru bcu drug pahi dkyil hkhor daň / thugs rdo rje ni khru bcu gňis pahi dkyil hkhót te I sgra ji bkin paho / / sku rdo rje ni tshaňs paho / / gsuň rdo rje ni dbaň phyug chen po daň / thugs rdo rje ni khyab hjug ste / sgra ji bkin mayin paho / / sku rdo rje ni ki ba daň / gsuň rdo rje ni dbaň daň / thugs rdo rje ni mňon spyod de / drati bahi don to I I skuhi rdo rje ni skuhi dkyil hkhor daň / gsuňs rdo rje ni gsuň gi dkyil hkhor / daň thugs rdo rje ni thugs kyi dkyil hkhor te I ňes pahi don to /The Diamond of Body'is Vairocana; the Diamond of Speech is Amitábha; the Diamond of M ind is Aksobhya; invariant sense.

Importance of the forty versesPerhaps 110 more eloquent testimony can be made on behalf of the verses than what is presented in the Pradipoddyotana itself immediately after its citation of the forty verses from the Vqjramdld.

Tsori-kha-pa explains it this way in his commentary on the Paficakrama called Gsal bahi sgron me (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 176-5 to p. 177-1) : “ (But) the main thing is that the Pradipoddyotana has stated that all the meaning of the (Guhyasamdja) Tantra is comprised by the nidana of forty syllables E-vam ma-ya, etc., and that in this (Vajramdla Explanatory Tantra) the meaning of each syllable is explained respectively by forty verses starting with the verse * “E” signifies the Noble W oman (sati) PrajnaV ’ ( / gtso bo ni E-varp ma-ya la sogs pahi yi ge b£i bcuhi glen g£is rgyud kyi don thams cad bsdus par sgron gsal las gsuris pa de rgyud hdir / E ni ses rab dam pa ste / / its sogs tshigs bead bii bcuhi tshigs bead res yi ge rehi don hchad pa hdi yin no / ).While I am indeed far from having mastered the various Tanjur commentaries and sub-commentatries on the Guhya- samajatantra, on its Pradipoddyotana, or on the Paficakrama, I did scan a considerable number for the research embodied in the present work; and the only quotations of the forty verses I could find were in the beautiful Tanjur commentary on the Paficakrama by Sri Laksmi, called Pancakrama-tikd-kramdrtha- prakasika. She quotes at least verses nos. 7, 12, 18, and 40— the nos. 7 and 18 as from the Vajramdla, the other two without name of source; and at other places uses language reminiscent of still other verses among the forty. *The reason, the quotations are easy to recognize, is that the translator into Tibetan of her text, recorded as Mantrakala^a, who is not the translator of the Vajramdla or of the Pradipoddyotana wherein the translation of the forty verses into Tibetan differs triflingly and in only a few cases, has employed the identical translation of those four verses as among the forty verses cited in the Pradipoddyotana. Presu­mably MantrakalaSa (12th cent., A.D. ?) had memorized the whole gr.oup of verses, as Tibetan followers of the Guhyasamaj atantra may still do today. And in consideration of the kind of passages Sri Laksmi ordinarily quotes, namely famous, well stated, and appropriate lines, 1 draw the conclusion that when she quotes nidana verses 12 and 40 without naming the original .work, she expects the reader to know the forty verses by heart, as she herself obviously does. Candraklrti also knows them well since he quotes the block of forty verses in Chapter One of his great work. This does not prove that all Indian"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"followers of the Guhyasamdja memorized the forty verses and then received explanation of them from the gurus, but it does suggest this to be the case for followers of the Guhyasamdja in the light of the Vajramdld, and subsequently in the light of the Pradipoddyo- tana, hence for followers of the ‘Arya’ school or tradition.If this memorization of the forty verses for centuries took place as stated above, there must be a good reason to be ascer­tained from the content or implications of the verses themselves. The section ‘Introduction to the Yoga of the Guhyasamdja-tantra’ leads up to the solution that the nidana verses can be grouped in conformity with the major steps of the Stage of Generation arid the Stage of Completion. One must therefore admit that, given sufficient insight into each verse and into the groupings of the verses, it would be theoretically possible to arrange under­neath these verses, or to present in introductions to groups of the verses, every important statement of Guhyasamdja ‘pregnant’ practice. And since theTantras are a practice rather than a philo­sophy, the verses thereby elucidate the entire Guhyasamajatanlra.It might be objected, that if this is so, why are not these verses more widely quoted, and a number of independent com­mentaries written ? The answer is that their very breadth of coverage renders these verses less practical for the candidates of the cult, who need specialized treatises or explanations for the particular phase of the cult in which they are engaged. A similar situation is found with the celebrated formula of Depen­dent Origination in non-tantric Buddhism. It is admitted that this formula sums up Buddhist doctrine, and theoretically everything of doctrinal importance can be arranged under one or other of the twelve members of the formula. But in practice the Buddhist monks wanted specialized treatises; and there are a number of important works of Buddhist doctrine that barely take account of Dependent Origination.There is another reason. It turned out in the course of gathering materials for the present commentary on the verses that they touch upon a number of disputed points in terms of the steps of yoga. It may well be the case that in classical times the commentators did not wish to argue for their respective positions while writing such a commentary. Candrakirti takes the lead in this silence about the verses, since he refrains from making any comments on them other than appending his signalINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 121"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"122 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA‘pregnant sense’ and adding the verse cited at the opening of the present section.But since the present work is not meant to teach anyone how to proceed through the intricacies of the Guhyasamaja cult,, but rather to show what the Guhyasamajatantra is all about, these forty verses with appropriate introductions serve admirably to advance this understanding.It may well be the case during the time when this cult flourished in India, that the master would expect the disciples to understand these verses more and more as they progressed in the praxis (carya), and that the guru would provide oral ex­planation coordinated with the disciple’s level of attainment. As soon as the Guhyasamaja literature was rendered out of its original Indie language into Tibetan, the necessity to have ‘bird’s eye’ views of the literature made the nidana verses even more important, and led to Tsoii-kha-pa’s invaluable annota­tion.E. The mandala of the GuhyasamajaThe word mandala is uniformly defined as an inner content (manda) bounded by an enclosing element (-/a). For example* the extract from the Samdhivyakarana in this sub-section illustrates the meaning of the word by the inner content as ‘knowledge’ with an enclosing element as the non-tantric state­ment of the path. There is also a ritual sequence of two kinds of mandala, the mandala of residence (adhara-mandala) and the mandala of the residents (adheya-mandala); the former is the palace and the seats for the gods; the latter is the group of gods who take their places in that palace. The palace is the inner sanc­tum of the mancjala. In the case of the Guhyasamaja-mandala, the full complement of deities seated in the palace totals thirty- two. They are the cast of the Guhyasamaja drama.The dramatis personae amount to the following characters; and any other deities mentioned in the Guhyasamaja cycle are held to be aspects or aliases of these thirty-two primary ones:5 Buddhas : Aksobhya, Vairocana, Amitabha, Ratna- sambhava, Amoghasiddhi.8 Bodhisattvas : Maitreya, Ksitigarbha, Vajrapani,Khagarbha, Lokesvara, Sarvanivaranaviskambhin, Manjusri (or Marijughosa), Samantabhadra."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄ) AT ANTRA1239 Yosits : Locana, MamakI, Pandara, Tara; andRupavajra, Sabdavajra, Gandhavajra, Rasavajra, SparSavajra.10 Krodhas : Yamantaka, Prajnantaka, Paclmantaka,Vighnantaka, Acala, Takkiraja, Niladanda, M aha- bala, Usnlsacakravartin, Sumbharaja.The following diagram of the Guhyasamaja mandala deities with assigned numbers shows their places in the palace in the event of the Aksobhya-mandala :In the center : 1.

Ratnasambhava (south) is to the right of the image.In the Guhyasamaja cult, there are several different deities that are taken as the central deity. While the Aksobhya- mandala is predominant, there is also the Guhyasamaja M anjuvajra (the first mandala in Abhayakaragupta’s Nifpafinayogavali), based on ManjusrI (Manjughosa). Also the Buddhasrljhana school had rites in which AvalokiteSvara was the chief deity. Fortunately, the most important mandala, the Aksobhya-mandala, exists in Sanskrit in a precise form, namely the second mandala in the NUpannayogavali.In his introduction (pp. xvii-xix) to the edition of the Guhyasamajaiantra, B. Bhattacharyya has well stated with brevity from the first chapter the procedure by which the Lord (as M ahavajradhara) first emanated the deities. In the termino­logy of the Pradipoddyotana, this is a ‘restricted circle of deities’ (pratibaddhadevatacakra), because only the five Buddhas, four yosits, and four krodhas are specifically indicated in that emana­tion. According to Ratnakarasanti’s Kusumanjali-guhyasamaja-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"nibandha-nama (PTT, Vol. 64, p. 96-1), this involves the three secrets of the Buddha, the secret of Body, of Speech, and of Mind. “ In brief, the secret of body is the lord Vairocana, and so on; the secret of speech is Locana, and so on; the secret of mind is Yamantaka, and so on” ( /de la mdor bsdu na / skulii gsah ba ni beom ldan hdas rnam par snari mdzad la sogs palio // gsuh gi gsah ba ni / spyan la sogs paho / / thugs kyi gsah ba ni g^inrjegSed la sogs pa ste / ). In that emanating role Maha- vajradhara is called‘Bodhicittavajra’ (Diamond of the Enlighten­ment M ind’) because all the deities emanate from bodhicitta. But, as was mentioned, in the present case, only thirteen of the deities are emanated. Also G. Tucci, The Theory and Practice of the Mandala, has included his translation of chapter one from the beginning. Therefore, it is not necessary to repeat here the whole process; but the essential details should be mentioned.The Lord first shifted from the role of Vairocana and adopted the role of Aksohhya Tathagata, in which form he blessed the four-cornered dustless mandala of ‘Great Pledge’ in the bhaga-s of the diamond ladies, according to the passage translated with annotation in our preceding discussion of the niddna sentence. Then the Lord Mahavajradhara in the center of this mandala began the emanation. The Lord’s first samadhi involved a mystical generation called ‘the body of the great incantation person’ (mahavidydpuru$amurti) (the passage is trans­lated with annotation under niddna verses on ‘Tathagata’). When the Lord blessed this body, the Lord was seen by all the Tathagatas to have three heads. This is the stage called Maha- sadhana, and according to Tsori-kha-pa, the phase of it called ‘Victorious m andala’ (yijaya-mandala). The Lord thus appear­ed in the role of the hierophant to teach the procedure to the disciples (in this case, the Tathagatas). Then, the Lord, in the appropriate samadhi, uttered the heart-mantra ‘Vajradhrk’ of the Hatred Family and took on the black, red, and white (headed) appearance of Aksobhya, thus situated in the center of the mandala. In another samadhi the Lord, uttering the heart- m antra ‘Jinajik’ of the Delusion Family, transformed himself into Vairocana, also black, red, and white, seated in front (east). He continued with ‘Ratnadhrk’of the Cinlamani Family and Ratnaketu (=Ratnasam bhava), seated in the south;‘Arolik’ of the Vajraraga Family and Amitabha, seated behind (west);INTRODUCTION TO THE G U H Y AS AMAJ AT ANTRA 125"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"and ‘Prajnadhrk of the Samaya Family and Amoghavajra, ( = Amoghasiddhi), seated in the north. The Lord, in another samadhi, emanated five goddesses as consorts of the five male deities. They are all called rati (‘love’) because they love their particular lord (whose family purifies the respective defilement of hatred, etc.). Thus he first transformed himself into the goddess Dvesarati (=»Mamaki) in the center with Aksobhya; then Moharati (= Buddha-Locana) in the east with Vairocana, Irsyarati ( = MamakI again) in the south with Ratnasambhava, Ragarati ( = Pandora) in the west with Amitabha and finally, Vajrarati ( = Samayatara) in the north with Amoghasiddhi. Then the Lord, through a series of four samadhis, transformed himself successively into the Krodha deities, fierce directional guardians: by the mantra ‘Yamantakrt’, the fierce Yamantaka at the east gate; ‘Prajnantakrt’, Prajnantaka at the south gate; “ Padman- takrt’, Padmantaka at the west gate; ‘Vighnantakrt*. Vighnan- talca at the north gate. The basic m andala was now complete: the Lord had finished his masterful show to the assembly.While that projection or spill-out of the deities is the goal to be achieved (step four), the human performer has to start in a more humble manner. He is given a meditational sequence in which he first ascends to the plane of the void (step one). There he imagines germ syllables, which transform themselves into hand symbols (step two), and finally into the bodies of the deities (step three), thus the ‘body m a n d a t* He can then proceed with his own spill-out as a m andala (the utsarga-mandala, infra) (step four). For the human performer the full set of thirty-two deities is stipulated in the case of the Aksobhya- mandala, available in Sanskrit, as was mentioned, in the Ni$pan- nayogdvali. This mandala is based on Nagarjuna’s Pindikrama (or Pindikrtasadhana). Following is my translation of Abhaya- karagupta’s text :The AkfobhyamandalaConcerning the mandala stated in the Pindikrama it (in­volves procedures) like the foregoing (Manjuvajra-mandala) up to (creation of) the palace. Now we shall mention the particulars of the fierce deities.

The wheel is the emblem of Vairocana, being the intrinsic nature of contemplating the ‘wheel of the doctrine’(dharmacakra) . The red lotus {padma.) is the emblem of Amitábha, being the intrinsic nature of prajm not adhered to by the mud of lust, etc. The bell (is the emblem of Vajrasattva), being the intrinsic nature of prajñá that is the purity of gestation (bhava). The ‘wish-granting gem’- (iciñtámani) is the emblem of Ratnasambhava, being the knowledge which fulfills all hopes. The sword is the emblem of Amoghasiddhi, being the prajñá (that severs) the corrupt practice.

That attribution of emblems to the individual Tathagata families plus important elements from the translation of the Aksobhya-mancjala can be clarified with correspondential significance in tabular form, as in Table II.Concerning the remark ‘Vajrasattva of Aksobhya and Samantabhadra*, Nagarjuna’s Pindikrta-sadhana, 52 B-53, states: '“Then he should enterprise the Atiyoga : Following uponAksobhya he should develop a Vajrasattva, three-faced, radiant with six hands, and shining with sapphire light” ( ....a th a atiyogam samarabhet / aksobhyanuprave^ena trimukham sad bhujojjvalam / ind rani lap rabham dlptam vajrasattvam vibha- vAyet I ). Nagarjuna, in the subsequent verses, shows that this involves placing the Guhyasamaja deities in spots of the body mandala. Ratnakarasanti (op. c i tp. 77-4, 5) comments : “ ‘three-faced* because the purity of the three liberations; and ‘six-handed* because the purity of the six perfections” (rnam par thar pa gsum rnam par dag pas ¿al gsum pa / pha rol tu phyin pa drug rnam par dag pas phyag drug pa). (The three liberations are through voidness, wishlessness, and signlessness; the six perfections are giving, morality, forbearance, striving, meditation, and insight). It appears that Vajrasattva is the yogin possibility of a person, as the essence of the Tathagatas, Aksobhya, and as their enlightenment-pledge, Samantabhadra; who has advanced, equivalent to the non-tantric progression of the Bodhisattva during the first seven stages, to the last three Bodhisattva stages, as indicated by his embracing Vajradhatvl- dvarl (‘Queen of the Diamond Realm’), who is drawn from the yogin’s own heart, according to the verse cited under nidana verse 33.INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA 131"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"II.

Now I shall turn to the theory of the Guhyasamaja mandala as the residence.

So much for the terminological side.W hat is meant, is that the ‘body-mandala* of Atiyoga over­flows into the bhaga, or mother-lotus, whereupon the latter be­comes the bhaga-mandala. This phase is called ‘letter placement* (akfara-nyasa)in the discussion of the fourth^ogfl (cf. the section ‘Four steps of yoga. ...* ); and this is the position of the Pradi* poddyotana (Documents)when in its treatment of the fourth mem­ber it refers to the instigation of the vajra and padma and then to the mantras (32 in no.) Vajradrg, etc. This is also the phase discussed in the section ‘Title of the work and nidana’, where the quotation from the Devendrapariprccha refers to the place­ment of the gods in the goddess (the karma-mudra or jilana-mudra) . The difficulty is that this process has several explanations going respectively with the ‘Stage of Generation’ and the ‘Stage of Completion*. The explanation that agrees with both Stages, is that this phase is the demonstration of the mandala, the ob­jective showing of the deity circle, either in its restricted form as in Guhyasamajatantra, chapter one, or in the full 32-deity group. Hence the Pradipoddyotana (‘Documents’) refers to this fourth yoga as ‘accomplishment of the great aim of others’.The third mandala, the paramartha-m., refers to the Guhya- samaja deities being drawn intoparamarthaior the absolute realm. Tson-kha-pa explains in his Mchan hgrel on Chapter V II that this means that the five personality aggregates (skandha), five elements (dhatu), five sense organs (indriya), five sense objects (vifaya), and five knowledges (jhdna), a total of 25, are succes­sively drawn into the Clear Light (where, according to the Pradipoddyotana on Chapter eight, verse 7, they unite with the ‘25-year old girl’)."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"III. INTRODUCTION TO THE YOGA OFTHE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEMA. The chapters of the Guhyasamâjatantra and yogaThe Eighteen chapters are discussed here because, as will be soon demonstrated, chapters 2 to 17 are divided into four groups with titles almost identical with those of the four sâdhana steps.The word for ‘chapter’ employed by the Guhyasamaja- tantra is pafala. The Pradipoddyotana, at the end of its commen­tary on chapter one, explains this word in two senses, going with pafa- (‘cloth’) and -la (‘grasping’) :I pa fo yathd datjitamafakadyupadravarfi nivàrayati / tathàyatji tantrdrlhah klešakarma janmâdyupadravarji nivâranât pafa iva pafa (la)h / tarjx lati grhiâtïti taddhárako granthasamCháh pafalah /Just as a cloth covering (pafa) wards off the attack of gnats, mosquitoes, etc., so also, by warding off the attack of defilement, karma, and rebirth, ‘pafala’ as the meaning of the Tantra, is like a cloth covering. Since it grasps and holds that (meaning), ‘pafala’ as the collection of compositions, is its receptacle.Also, at the end of its commentary on chapter thirteen, the Pradipoddyotana equates a pafala with ‘the collection of composi­tions which teach it’ (tatpratipâdako granthàsamühah).The following chapter titles as preserved in Sanskrit have varying relevance to the chapter contents. For example, of the two chapters translated in ‘Documents’, chapter six does adhere to indications of its title, while chapter twelve is scarcely described by its title.1. “Blessing of the samádhi-mandala of all the Taihà gatas” (sarvatathàgatasamàdhimandalàdhiçthàna).2. “The Mind of Enlightenment” (bodhicitta)."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"138 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRA3. “Samadhi called ‘Diamond Array’ ” (vajravyuha nama sam adhi).4. “Secret mandala of Body, Speech, and M ind” (guhya- kayavakci ttam andala).5. “Best of all praxis” (samantacaryagra).6. “ Empowerment of the Body, Speech, and M ind” (kayavakcittadhisthana).7. “ Praxis of mantras” (mantracarya).8. “ Pledge of consciousness” (cittasamaya).9. “ Pledge whose goal is the reality of the non-dual supreme entity” (paramarthadvayatattvarthasamaya).10. ‘Exhorting with the heart (mantras) of all the Tathagatas ” (sarvatathagatahrdayasancodana).11. “The highest vidyapurusa who has the mantra- pledge and the reality-diamond of all the Tathagatas” (sarva- tathagatamantrasamayatattvavajravidyapurusottama).12. “ Instruction on the best evocation of the pledge (samayasadhanagranirdesa).13. “ Revelation contemplating the meaning of the rea­lity of the array of pledges” (samayavyuhatattvarthabha- vanasambodhi).14. “ Samadhi called ‘King of sporting with attraction (of deities) by mantras’ ” (mantrakarsanavijtmbhitarajo nama sam adhi).15. “ Source of the diamond whose essence is the pledge of all sentient beings” (sarvasattvasamayasaravajrasambhutir nama) (edited citta replaced by sattva).16. “Revelation of the mancjala-diamond of all siddhis” (sarvasiddhimandalavajrabhisambodhir nam a).17. “Blessing of the pledge—and—vow-diamonds of allthe Tathagatas” (sarvatathagatasamayasambaravajradhi?-thana).18. “ Blessing of the diamond knowledge which explains all the secrets (sarvaguhyanirdeSavajrajftanadhi?thana).The Pradipoddyotana commentary covers only the first 17 chapters, although it cites the 18th chapter (‘Documents’) ; while the 18th chapter itself has some separate commentaries preseVved in the Tibetan Tanjur.

The fact that those sixteen intermediate chapters fall into four sets by authority of those verses is hardly noticed in the present edition of the text, because of corruptions which cannot be corrected without consultation of the Tibetan translation. Indeed, there are even two important lines missing from the current edition, which I have restored along with the other corrections, with the help ofNâgârjuna’s commentary (AtfàdaSa-patala-vistara-vyâ- A:/^â,PTT,Vol.60,p. 4). The two lines were still part of the Guhya- samàja-tantra when Ratnàkaraéânti composed his Kusumanjali- guhyasamâja-nibandha-nâma (PTT, Vol. 64), which explains how to pair the verses for translation purposes.

S. upeya- tantray T. thabs las by tin bahi rgyud) y while the chapters 2-17 are the ‘tantra of the approach’ (S. upaya-tantra. T. thabs kyi rgyud), and that the chapter 18 is the ‘continuation tantra’ {uttar a-tantra). Furthermore, each group of four chapters from 2-17 is also known by a numerical title. The Seva chap­ters are ‘Treta’; Upasadhana, ‘Dvapara’; Vratasambara, ‘K rta’; and Mahasadhana, possibly* ‘Nandin’ (T. dgah ba can). However, the words Seva, and so on, appear to be employed as categories rather than as steps, in which meaning virtually the same set of terms is employed below (sub-section G). Candrakirti’s Pradipoddyotana differs from Ratnakara- ¿anti, by treating the first chapter as a basis for the remaining sixteen; and so, for example, includes the forty nidana verses in the commentary on Chapter 1.There is a problem of how practical is that grouping by fours. There is some confirmation for the validity of the grouping in terms of the Mahasadhana and Vratasambara ( = Sadhana) sets when these terms are equated with the ‘vajras’, namely, Mahayoga and Atiyoga. As was shown, the ‘body m andala’ is associated with Atiyoga, and this is indicated by the Vratasambara chapters, namely, Chapter 16 (on the kaya-and vag-mandalas) and Chapter 12 (on the change into the M ahamudra). The samadhi ‘Victory of the Rite’, associat­ed with Mahasadhana, is the topic of Chapter 13 (on exten­sive treatment of rites), and the utsarga-and paramartha- mandalas, while not explicitly stated for the Mahasadhana chapters, presumably go with Chapter 5 (on the praxis, carya) and possibly with Chapter 9 (on the yogasamadhi), while the paramartha-manclala also goes with Chapter 13. Even clearer is the consistency of the Upasadhana chapters (2, 6, 10, 14) with the equivalent ‘vajra’ called Anuyoga (as shown later) because this involves depositing mantras (parts of the bodhi-INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 141"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"cittta) in spots of the body. Also when Guhyasamdja, Chapter 18, associates ‘the four diamond rites of Seva’ with the Seva chapters (3, 7, 11, 15) this is consistent with my latergrouping of the first six nidana syllables (for Evam maya ¿rutam) with Yoga (=Seva) because, as I later show, the four syllables E, VAM , MA, YA can indicate any four steps of yoga, and ‘grutam’ means hearing or learning them. However, insofar as I have noticed cross-referencing in the Pradipoddyotana and its Mchan hgrel, the associations appear to be independent of such grouping. For example, the important verses on the meditation on the tip of the nose are found in Chapters three and six, which belong to two different groups. Perhaps because there was a question of the viability of this grouping, Ratnaka- rasanti composed his commentary (op. cit.) by first comment­ing on chapters 2-17 in the above grouping, and then comment­ing on each of the 17 chapters in their normal order.O f those chapters, my researches indicate that the first twelve are the most important. This is indicated in part by the fact that the explanatory tantra Sarjidhivydkarana, which expands the Guhyasamdjatantra ifi chapter order, only goes up through chapter twelve. This set of chapters includes chapter 1, which is th e ‘goal’ or ‘basis’ chapter; chapter 2, with the all- important topic of bodhicitta; chapters six and twelve with the steps of yoga; and chapter seven with the three kinds of praxis ((carya). Also, the theory that the chapters 2-17 are grouped by fours in the scheme given above, acknowledges that the later chapters expand on materials of the earlier chapters rather than start completely new topics.B. The two stages, initiations and the Clear LightThe Guhyasamdja, in common with other Tantras of the Anuttarayogatantra class, whether Mother or Father Tantras, is divided into two stages of application, the Stage of Generation (iutpatti-krama) and the Stage of Completion (.samp anna-krama) (or utpanna-krama). This is said in the Guhyasamdjatantra, Chapter X V III (p. 157) : /kramadvayam upa£ritya vajrinam tatra desana- / kramam autpattikam caiva kramam autpanna- kam tatha / “ Taking recourse to two stages, the adamantine ones have therein the instruction, namely, the Stage of Genera­tion and the Stage of Completion.” Also, the Paiicakrama142 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJAT ANTRA"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM 143(I, 2) states : /utpatti-kramasamsthanam nispannakrama-kaiiksinam / upayas caisa sambuddhaih sopanam iva nirmitah/ “ The Complete Buddhas have formulated like a ladder this means for those well standing in the Stage of Generation and desiring the Stage of Completion.” In terms ofyogins, Candra- kirti at the beginning of his commentary on Chap. XI, distin­guishes them as the kalita-yogin (“imagining y.” ) and the ni$pannayogin (“completed y.” ).In his Snags rim chen mo (f. 340a-5), Tsoh-kha-pa illustrates the necessity to have the Stage of Generation precede the Stage of Completion, by citing Vajragarbha’s commentary on the Hevajratanlra:/mi yi skye ba dag ¿in la / / dmigs med snih rjehi sa bon ni/ /btab pas gan phyir de yi phyir / / stoh nid dpag bsam Ijon 4m hbyun / By reason of having cast the seed of aimless compassion into the pure field of human birth, there arises the ‘wishing tree’ of voidness.Tsoh-kha-pa explains that the ‘field’ is ‘purified’ by the Stage of Generation; and that the ‘seed’ of aimless compassion attended with great ecstasy (mahdsukha) is cast therein by the Stage of Completion.The Stage of Generation is conceptual, the Stage of Completion concrete. The reason the Stage of Generation must precede can be illustrated in terms of the theory of winds. In this first stage the candidate comes to understand the nature of the winds which are not visible to the ordinary senses, and in the course of the yoga proper to this stage recites in accordance with the natural cycle of the winds. In the Stage of Comple­tion he proceeds to combine those winds in extraordinary ways. O f course one must understand a thing (first stage) before one can manipulate it (second stage). It follows that unless one believes that there are these mystic winds the Upanisads speak about and which are so prominent in the commentarial litera­ture of the Guhyasamdjatantra, he can see little point to having these two successive stages of yoga; and, in fact, there is little profit to his pursuing the system at any level of application.Tson-kha-pa’s remark, cited above, is elarified textually with such an expression as ‘knowing the intrinsic nature’ (svabhavajna) (see also, nidana verse 33), that is to say, knowing the natural cycle of the world in terms of the mystic forces, as"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"144 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAthe achievement of the Stage of Generation, prior to the ‘great ecstasy’ (mahdsvkha) of the Stage of Completion. Here there are two passages that show what is meant. The first is in Aryadeva’s Cittaviiuddhiprakaram, verse 20, where ‘intrinsic nature’ translates svabhdva :bala rajyanti rüpefu vairdgyam ydnti madhyamdh / svabhávajñá vimucyante rüpasyottamabuddhayah //Children delight in forms; the middle-aged pass to aversion. Understanding the intrinsic nature of form, those with best intelligence are liberated (from it).The second passage is from Saraha’s Dohd-ko$a, verse 23 in Shahidullah’s numbering, translated here from the Prakrit (given) and Tibetan text. While it does not have such a term as ‘intrinsic nature’, it seems to have the same message, jallai maral ubajjai [bajjhai] talla! parama mahásuha sijjahl.[Sarahe gahana guhira bhása kahia pasu-loa nibboha jim a rahia.]Having taken which (jallai), one dies, is reborn, and is bound;Taking that very thing (tallai) one achieves the supreme ‘great ecstasy’*But Saraha speaks these inexplicable and profound words so this beastly world will not understand.Interpreting Saraha’s verse in the present context, in the Stage of Generation one contemplates those natural forces behind the cycles of birth, staying for a while, and dying, and the repetition of those three again and again, and then in the Stage of Completion, manipulates those same forces to achieve the ‘great ecstasy’.Both stages have their own forms of ‘subtle yoga’ (suk$ma- yoga) o fprdndydma. The former stage is held to extend certain worldly magical powers (siddhi) to its successful candidates. The latter stage is held to confer the supreme achievement of Complete Enlightenment, which is the goal of non-tantric Buddhism as well. In the commentarial period, treatises were composed especially for one or other of the two stages. The most famous of such treatises, Nágárjuna’s Pañcakrama, is devoted to the Stage of Completion but is also helpful for the prior stage."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"This is because the treatise is first to be read or heard with conviction, and this conceptual reading is an elementary form of the Stage of Generation which is the conceptual prepara­tion for the second stage.The commentators of the ‘Arya* tradition of the Guhya- samaja tried to combine this theory of stages with the well- known Bodhisattva stages of non-tantric M ahayana Buddhism, thereby clarifying the tantric version as the ‘quick path’. These ten stages either fall into a 5-5 grouping or a 7-3 grouping. Both groupings are adopted in tantric literature, but the latter grouping was accepted for the correlation in this ca^e, as is suggested by the Pailcakrama, 2d krama, verse 79: ddikarmikayogena caftamirfi bhumim apnuyat / alokatrayadarH ca daSabhumydm pratifthitah 11 By yoga of a beginner, he attains the Eighth Stage, and seeing the three Lights he is settled in the Tenth Stage. Tsori-kha-pa’s Paficakrama comm., Vol. 159, p. 4-4,5, cites the view of Spyod bsdus (Aryadeva’s Carydmelapaka)that one attains the Eighth Stage by the Stage of Generation. The implication is that the last three stages of the Bodhisattva Path constitute part of the Stage of Completion. Thereafter, the commen­tators differ along sectarian lines. Commentators of Yoga- cara preference would combine this tantric theory with the terminology ‘revolution of the basis* (ahaya-paravrtti) of the set of perceptions, especially the ‘store consciousness* (alayavij- ildna) often associated in that Yogacara literature with attain­ment of the Eighth Bodhisattva Stage. Madhyamika-type commentators would avoid the term ‘store consciousness* in this connection. However, no attempt is made in these tantric correlations to make a full-scale dovetailing with the theory of ten Bodhisattva Stages, in the manner as these are portrayed in great detail especially in the Databhumika-sutra.The old theory of ten Stages implies an eleventh (the Sam antaprabha), the stage of the complete Buddha. A further difficulty arose when threeextra Stages (bhurni), with varying- names, were added to the traditional ten, with the previous name Samantaprabha moved to the thirteenth. For example, AlamkakalaSa, PTT, Vol. 61, p. 182-2, explains: the name ‘Vajramala* as the Stage called Samantaprabha, and cites the verse (the original Sanskrit given under ‘Bhagesu vijahara’),INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 145"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 YOOA OF THB OUHYASAMÁJATANTRAincluding: “ The Stage resorted to by all the Buddhas is theThirteenth, and it is called the ‘lady’.” The two systems of stages, the ten plus one, on the one hand, and thirteen on the other, relate to two ways of assigning the initiations (abhixseka) and mystical visions of the Guhyasamdjatantra.According to the notes to Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras, initiations are the means of attaining power over nature. There are two kinds, initiation simply in an honorary way, namely to the Buddhas; and initiation for the purpose of generating the power, namely to the Bodhisattvas. There are further varieties, such as those stated in the Guhya­samdja, Chap. X V III, verses 111-112A :abhisekam tridha bhedam asmin tantre prakalpitam / kalašdbhi$ekarfi prathamarji dvitiyarjx guhyábhi$ekatah 11 prajndjnanarji trtiyam tu caturtharji tat punas tathd /A distinction of three initiations is prepared in this Tantra, to wit : initiation of the flask as the first; the second, as the secret initiation; insight-knowledge, the third; and the fourth, precisely the same (as the third).The first initiation, that of the flask, is laid in the Stage of Generation, and is usually divided into five initiations of the flask, going with the five Tathágatas, and all accompanied by sprinkling rites. An initiation of the hierophant (vajracarya) is laid in the transition to the Stage of Completion. The last three initiations, the ‘secret’, th e ‘insight-knowledge’, and the ‘fourth’ are laid in the Stage of Completion. All those initia­tions are described at length in Mkhas grub rje9s Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras-, here some correlative materials are presented in order to clarify the role of the initiations in the Yoga of the Guhyasamdjatantra.Candrakirti’s Guhyasamdjdbhisamayalamkdra-vrtti (PTT,Vol. 62, p. 26-5) mentions three kinds of ‘flask initiation’ : outer, inner, and ‘pregnant’ (phyi daň naň daň sbas paho). The outer kind uses a flask made of precious material for the five initiations of the flask. The inner kind also uses a precious flask for the five kinds of ambrosia, empowered by the Tathá- gatas. The ‘pregnant’ kind also has two varieties, ‘means’ (upaya) and ‘insight’ {prajňd) flasks. The pregnant flask of means has the water from the mouth of the guru; the pregnant flask of insight has the water from the lotus of the prajn,a lady."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The ‘pregnant’ kind of flask initiation appears to be the unshared kind’ (asádhárana) involved with the Hierophant’s Initiation.

Both the Clear Light and the coup­ling in the realm of learning are associated with the latter part of the tenth stage. The coupling beyond learning is posited on the eleventh stage, Samantaprabha. That is the purport of the Caryiimeldpaka (Toh. 1803.) ** Furthermore, there is a difference in where the initiations of the Stage of Completion are conferred. The notes to Mkhas grub rje’s work show that the Secret Initiation is attained in the relative bodhicitta-mandalaythe Insight-Knowledge (prajnd-jiidna) one in the bhaga-mandala of the vidya, and the Fourth Initiation in the absolute bodhicitta-mandala. Comparing this terminology with the previous discussion of the mandala, it is easy to observe that the relative bodhicitta-mandala is the ‘body-mandala’ (deha- mandala), and the other two, the utsarga-mandala and the para- martha-mandala; while all three are understood in the present case with interpretations of the Stage of Completion.Also, these initiations can be stated in terms of the consorts (mudrd). Following the exposition of the Klon-rdol bla-ma as set forth in my “ Female E n erg y ...” article, the ‘incanta­tion-born female* is the yogini at the final limit of the Stage of Generation; hence is involved in the M ahasadhana phase of ‘invariant (letter) placement’ (in the samadhi ‘Victorious M andala’), and presumably is the vidya of the Preceptor’s Initiation.

The"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"‘together-born female’ enables one to attain the Illusory Body and the Goal Clear-Light (or the Clear Light of the Absolute Entity) : hence is the vidyá of the Prajñájñána Initiation; and since the Fourth Initiation is said to be just the same as the third, she is also the vidyá or rnudra intended here.Regarding the ‘Secret Initiation’, the Pradipoddyotana in its chapter eight devoted to this initiation cites the Tantra catalogued as Candraguhyatilaka (“yathoktam bhagavatá guhye candratilake” ):utsrjya ratnojvala-*bodhicittat¡i samÉufkamürtijji sakalaipjindndm /abhifiñcya m ürdhnamalaratnavaíair vi§uddhavajrodbhavajñána-toyaih //Having drawn forth the bodhicitta jewel-blazing of the Jinas, he sprinkles all the arid body by way of the head with knowledge drops issuing from the pure vajra, (drops) with the power of the immaculate jewel.The context shows that the expression ‘by way of the head’ means that the candidate imagines that the substance flows down from the crown of the head and first stimulates the ‘little tongue’ (the uvula). Fora clear statement of its further pro­gress through the body, see Sri Laksmi’s passage presented under nidána verse ‘KÁ’ (No. 22). For the reference to the tongue, the Pradipoddyotana on chapter seventeen quotes the ‘Mülatantra’ (in fact, the Tattvasamgraha of the Yoga-tantra class):jihvám talagatdm krtvd nasikagratji tu cintayet / süksmavajrasukhasparsád bhavet cittam samdhitam // Having placed the tongue on the ‘roof of the mouth’, he should contemplate the tip of the nose (pf the face). From blissful contact with the subtle vajra (the little tongue), the mind becomes stabilized.In the same place the Pradipoddyotana cites a clarifying passage from the ‘Prajñasütra’ (which Mchan hgrel identifies only as ‘Mother T antra’):dhdrámrtamayi nityam ya, mürdhni varéate dhruvam / pitvd hayayogindrena jaramrtyuvindiakah // yathotpalandlena {tu) toy am dkarsate narah \\ evam upajivya jived yogi mahdbala iti //W hat consists of streaming ambrosia continually andINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÁJA SYSTEM 149"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"150YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAsteadily rains in the head. Having drunk (that) with the ‘yogi organ of a horse’ (i.e. the stretched-out tongue curled back to the uvula) one destroys old age and death, (drinking) like a man sucks water through the stalk of an utpala-lotus. So having subsisted, the yogi lives with the name ‘Mighty One’.Furthermore, according to that work of Candrakirti’s, the vrtti (op. cit., p. 29-3), the place where the initiation is conferred is the disciple’s tongue, of which there are three: in the throat, the heart, and the navel, the places where he enjoys the substance. This refers to the downward passage of the white-and-red bodhicitta drop.In the case of the third initiation, this is the ‘knowledge based on the insight’ (Candrakirti’s explanation, the vrtti, p. 30-3, 4) as a definition of prajňá-jňána (‘insight-knowledge’). According to Mkhas-grub-rje’s work, the Insight-Knowledge Initiation is associated with the passage of winds in the ‘central vein’ arousing ecstasies in four cakras. Hence it is understand­able that definitions of mahasukha are given in connection with this Initiation. Thus, Tsoň-kha-pa’s Sňags rim chen mo, in the Prajňá-jňána Initiation section, quotes V itapada’s Togasapta- ndma-caturabhifekaprakarana: ‘‘The distinction of whether there is or is not the great ecstasy (mahasukha) is accordingly the last of explanations. However, in the Prajňá-jfiána the charac­teristic of mahasukha takes shape. . . . ‘Because it is without place and without deception, it is explained as mahasukha’ ” (sbyor ba bdun pa las kyaň 11 bde ba chen po yin ma yin gyi khyad par de bžin du bšad pahi m thar / ho na kyaň ses rab ye ses la bde chen mtshan nid gzugs su gnas / žes daň // mi gnas kyaň ni mi sluhi phyir // bde ba chen po žes su bšad / ces dbaň gsum pa la....). Also, Tsoň-kha-pa’s commentary on the “ Six Laws ofN áro-pa,” (PTT Vol. 161, p. 8-2,3) states: “ The main thing here is the requirement that the ecstasy of the Stage of Completion belong to the ‘consubstantiality’ (sahaja) arising from making the wind(s) enter, dwell, and dissolve in the ‘central vein’ ” (/ hdihi yaň gtso bo ni rluň dbu maržugs gnas thim gsum byas pa las byuň bahi lhan skyes kyi rdzogs rim pahi bde ba dgos so / ). In Candrakirti’s way of explain­ing (the vrtti, p. 30-3, 4) the initiation is conferred in the three series of caves or in the padma. Since the bodhicitta proceeds"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM151downward in the ‘central vein’ through four cakras, we may understand Candraklrti’s remark as intending the upper three cakras as ‘caves’ and the lowest cakra as the ‘padma’, where the bodhicitta should not ‘fall out’ or be released.The Fourth Initiation, also called ‘Initiation of the Name’, is said to be just like the Prajna-jnana one, meaning that the bodhicitta passes through the reverse order of the same cakras; and, according to the note in Mkhas grub rje’s work, p. 36, upon reaching the forehead cakra, the small circle called urnd-koSa, passes out into the ten directions like a lightning flash.Furthermore, the theory of the Clear Light preceded or followed by three Lights, is related to the division into two stages. Now I shall present material from several works of Tsoh-kha-pa, leading up to a convenient table, after which some classifications in Tanjur works can be appreciated better. Tson-kha-pa, in his commentary on the Caturdevipariprccha labelled 'Bkis kus’ (PTT, Vol. 159, p. 97-4) writes: “That is the concise paramdrtha-mandala as the ‘Clear Light of conviction’ in the phase of the Stage of Generation, and is comparable to the four voids of which the Clear Light belonging to the Stage of Completion is the chief one” (/ de ni bskyed rim gyi skabs su lhag mos hod gsal du bsdus pahi don dam pahi dkyil hkhor dan/ rdzogs rim gyi hod gsal gtso bor byas pahi stoh pa bii lta buho /). Restricting ourselves to this ‘Clear Light of conviction’ concern­ed with imagining the ‘basic time’—the cycle of life and death— we find that there are two kinds. There is a Clear Light of deep sleep which contrasts with dream, and a Clear Light of death which contrasts with the intermediate state, as in this passage of Tsoh-kha-pa’s Gsaii ba hdus pahi kal ies yig chun thor bu pa (Vol. 159, p. 136-2): “ Since the Clear Light of deepsleep, and dream are controlled by the power of wind, there is the invariable accompaniment that the Clear Light of death, and the intermediate state are controlled by the power of wind. In the same way, since the Clear Light of deep sleep, and dream are controlled by craving, there is the invariable accompani­ment that the Clear Light of death, and the intermediate state are controlled by craving” ( / ghid kyi hod gsal dan / rmi lam rlun stobs kyis zin na / hchi bahi hod gsal dan / bar do rluri stobs kyis zin pas khyab / de biin du ghid kyi hod gsal daii / rmi lam hdun pas zin na / hchi bahi hod gsal dan / bar do hduu"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"152 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÂJATÀNTRApahi zin pas khyab ciň /). According to this passage, the ‘basic time’ is controlled by wind and craving; deep sleep corresponds to death; dream corresponds to the intermediate state.Turning to the ‘time of the path’ in the Stage of Comple­tion, when the four voids are evoked concretely, there is also a terminology of two kinds of Clear Light, as in Tsoň-kha-pa’s Gsal bahi sgron me (Vol. 158, p. 194-1) : “Moreover, at the conclusion of the Clear Light of the (Supreme) Entity, he accomplishes the Yuganaddha-deha (pair-united body); and at the end of the Symbolic Clear Light, he accomplishes the Illusory Body” ( / de yaň don gyi hod gsal gyi mjug tu zuň hjug gi sku daň / dpehi hod gsal gyi mjug tu sgyu mahi sku hgrub po /).However, both the ‘basic time’ and the ‘time of the path’ are involved in the varieties of intermediate states and of births, as in that same work of Tsoň-kha-pa (his commentary on the Paiicakrama), first the intermediate states (bar do) (Vol. 159, p. 53-4): (1) bar-do of gestation (srid pa bardo ), which agrees with (2) the bar-do of dream (rmi lam gyi bardo) according to the M ar-pa school— the two being the bar-do of the basic time (gzihi bar do); (3) bardo of the path (lam gyi bardo). Next the births (Vol. 159, p. 53-5): (1) birth in a womb through inter­mediate state of gestation; (2) birth through ‘bar-do of dream’ at the time of waking up to reoccupy the gross personality aggregates— the two being the ‘birth’ of the basic time (gkihi skye ba) ; (3) birth of apprehending the gross personality aggre­gates by the bar-do of the illusory body (sgyu lus kyi bardo).The above data can be clarified in tabular form, where the Clear Lights of deep sleep and death of everyday life corres­pond respectively to the Symbolic Clear Light and the Clear Light of the Absolute Entity.Now for the Tanjur classifications, of which a good start is Šákyamitra’s tiká on the Caryâmelàpakapradipa (PTT, Vol. 62, p. 300-5) : “The varieties are Clear Light of (1) training{šaik$a), (2) beyond training (ašaik$a), (3) true mind (cittatd), and (4) entity (artha). Nos. 3 and 4 in his classification seem to be the two mentioned by Šrí Laksmï (Vol. 63, p. 29-4): “The Clear Light is of two kinds, Clear Light of consciousness and Clear Light of intrinsic nature. Among those, the Clear"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"CLEAR LIGHTSINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"154 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÄJATANTRALight of consciousness is the (Yogacara’s) ‘representation’(vijňapti) without aspect (nirdkara); and the Clear Light of in­trinsic nature is universal void (sarvašUnya) which is obtained at the fourth stage” (/ hod gsal bani rnam pa gfiis te / semskyi hod gsal ba daň / raň bžin gyis hod baho // de la sems kyi hod gsal ba ni rnam pa med pahi rnam rig daň / raň bžin gyis hod gsal ba ni thams cad ston pa ste / rim pa bži pas thob par byaho/). That is to say, Šákyamitra’s kind called ‘true mind’ would be the Yogacarin’s ‘representation without (external) aspect’ : and the one of ‘entity’ (short for ‘supreme entity’) would be the universal void.Nos. 1 and 2 of Sakyamitra’s classification are explained in Candrakirti’s Guhyasamájdbhisamayálamkdra-vrtti (PTT, Vol. 62, p. 35-3) in summary verses : “One should understand twoClear Lights by ‘training’ (,§aik$a) and ‘beyond training’ (ašaikfa). The Clear Light of training is explained as (the dhydnas of) contraction’ (pindagraha) and ‘expansion’ (anubheda). The one beyond training is non-discursive (avikalpa) , notperceptively reached (anupalabdha), pure from the outset (áái- šuddha) .” These two are respectively equivalent to the Sym­bolic Clear Light and to the Cleaj* Light of the Absolute entity in the time of the path. Therefore, Sakyamitra’s varieties (1) and (2) are respectively equivalent to his varieties (3) and (4). All of the above Tanjur classifications apply to> “Time of the Path.” The Clear Light of Deep Sleep appears mainly a matter of oral instruction.Finally, there is the difficult but important topic of three cary as in relation to the two Stages. In his Mthah gcod, Tson- kha-pa points out that Aryadeva’s Carydmeldpaka took account of the three caryas only for the Stage of Completion, but that the Pradipoddyotana on Chapter X (in fact the initial sentence) implies that both Stages have their version of the three caryas. The three according to the Pradipoddyotana manuscript on Chapter VII are prapanca-caryd, ni$prapanca-caiya, and alyantani$- prapadca-catyd. Tsoň-kha-pa elaborately discusses these matters, in his Paňcakrama commentary (PTT, Vol. 159, pp. 67 to 78), the section entitled “The caryd which is the means of issuing the profit in the two States” (rim gilis la bogs hbyin pahi thabs sp oa pa) ; and has a briefer, but also complicated discussion in his. Mthah gcod on Chapter VII (PTT, Vol. 156, pp. 42 to 45)."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The discussion shows that in each case this is a carya (advanced yoga technique) connected with the female element of the world. The word prapanca has here the special meaning, “involvement with the five sense objects” . In ancient Buddhist texts, these five are called the pancakdmaguna (“the five strands of desire”) , and they promote development of the being, his taking a place in phenomenon (a more usual Indian meaning of the Sanskrit word prapanca). The addition of the word caiyd serves for classifying the yoga techniques of this Tantric tradition. Candra- kirti’s commentary on Chapter VII associates the three in the given order with three of the four ways of interpreting Guhyasamdjatantra passages, namely with the “shared sense,” and “pregnant sense,” and the “ultimate sense” (see my section “ Seven ornaments and subdivisions”) . In illustration, when one contemplates the deities in their proper dress, hence in their corporeal form, this is a case of prapanca; however, properly speaking, the addition of the word caiyd restricts this case to the five sense objects deified as goddesses (as in niddna verse 21). Again, in relation to the three Lights, the carya would be of the “non-prapanca” type; and in relation to the Clear Light, the carya would be of the “extreme non -prapanca” type. Hereafter, the term prapanca will be left untranslated; ‘carya’ is either trans­lated as ‘praxis’ or left untranslated.Now that we have alluded to both superficial and profound aspects of the two stages, we should prepare for the separate discussion of the two stages by the verse cited in ‘Documents* (Pradip'oddyotana on X II, 60-64) :By the distinction of ‘shared’ and ‘superior’, one posits two kinds of service :The ‘shared’ one by the four vajras, the ‘superior’ one by members six in number.This verse shows that the word ‘Service’ (sevd) can be employed in generalized ways to indicate the entire praxis of the Guhya- samaja. Previously in section A, on the chapters, we have translated that there are four diamond rites of Seva associated with the Stage of Generation. Then the superior service is the six members of yoga in the Stage of Completion. To anticipate, the four diamond rites are named 1. yoga, 2. anuyoga, 3. atiyoga, and 4. mahayoga. The six members of yoga have already been defined in ‘Documents’ : 1. pratyahara, 2. dhyana,INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 155"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"156 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA3. pranayama, 4. dharana, 5. anusmrti, and 6. samadhi. What is meant by ‘shared’ service is that the terms 1. seva 2. upa­sadhana, 3. sadhana, and 4. mahasadhana, can be employed in one sense of the words as equivalent to the four vajras as named above, and can be employed in another sense as equiva­lent to the six members of yoga. In the latter case, seva covers pratyahara, dhyana, pranayama, and dharana; upasadhana equals anusmrti; and both sadhana and maha­sadhana are included in samadhi. Moreover, as has been shown, sixteen chapters (2-17) of the Guhyasamdjatantra are labelled by these four generalized terms of service. It may be the intention of such labelling to indicate the shared aspects of the two stages insofar as these aspects can be assigned in four groups by those four labels of the chapters.However, the Guhyasamdjatantra has itself briefly defined the common elements indicated by the four vajras in its chapter X V III, verse 137 :prathamam junyatabodhim dvitiyam bijasamhrtam / trliyam bimbanifpattis caturtham nydsam ak$aram //The first is the revelation of voidness; the second is the drawing together of germ syllables; the third is the per­fection of the image; the fourth is the invariant ( = letter) placement.In order to apply to both stages, those four have to be e x p lr'r with utmost generality. The first indicates the yoga of reaching up through the void or light stages to the Clear Light. The second is a descent of divine elements. The third is the consum­mation of the candidate. The fourth is the saintly re-involve- ment with the world.C. The four steps of yoga and the three samadhis in the Stage of GenerationThe four steps of yoga in the Stage of Generation are frequently referred to as the four steps of service {seva) or of evocation {sadhana). They are presented this way in the Guhyasamdja, X V III, p. 162:yogatantre$u sarvesu fasyate yogina sada / sevdvidhanam prathamam dvitiyam upasadhanam / sadhanam tu trtiyam vai mahdsddhanam caturthakam I/The yogin always praises in all Yogatantra—the vile of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"service as first, the near-evocation as second, evocation as third, and great evocation as fourth.These steps are stated somewhat more fully in Ibid., XII, p. 58 (completely given in ‘Documents’) : “He should contemplate the samádhi-praxis of service (send) as the supreme revelation (uttama-bodhi)” (sevásamádhisamyogam bhávayet bodhim uttamam). “ . .. .the deliberation on the ‘base of vajra’ (vajra- áyatana) when there is foremost success is the near-evocation (upasádhana)” (upasádhanasiddhyagre vajráyatanavicáranam). “The contemplation of the lords of the mantras stated to be the exhortation at the time of evocation (sddhana)” (sádhane codanam proktam mantrádhipatibhávanam). “At the time of great evocation (mahdsadhana), when he imagines the form of his own mantra-vajrin as the lord on the crown of the head, he is successful because of the jňána-vajrin” (mahásádhanakále§u bimbam svamantravajrinah / mukute ’dhipatim dhyátvá siddh- yate jňánavajrinah).Tsoii-kha-pa further clarifies the four steps by identifying them with the four yogas of the Kr$nayamari-tantra (presumably Tohoku No. 467) in this passage (Sňags rim, f. 364b) :I rdo rje sems dpah rdzogs pa ni // mat h by or yin par hdi Itar hdod I I de yi rgyu mthun lha yi sku / rjes kyi rnal hbyor yin par grags / / hkhor lo thams cad yons rdzogs pa jI iin tu mal hbyoryin par hdod 11 sku daň gsuň daň thugs mams daň // lha yi mig sogs byin brlabdaa / / ye šes hkhor lo gzug pa daň 11 mehod daň bstod pa chen po ni / ¡rnal hbyor chen po Us bya/io / The perfection of Vajrasattva is thus held to be yoga. His affiliated divine body (*devatd-kdya) is known as anuyoga. The perfecting of all the ‘circles’ (cakra) is held to be atiyoga. The blessing (adhif(hana) of body, speech, and mind, and of the divine eye (divya-cak$us), etc.,* the drawing in of the Jňána-cakra ( = knowledge beings, jnanasattva), the great offerings and praises—is called mahdyoga.Nágárjuna, in his Pindikrta-sadhana, is consistent with his employ­ment of this terminology of yogas, starting with verse 44 (in La Vallée Poussin’s numbering). We learn that in yoga there is the rite involving the recitation of the celebrated mantras, Om ¿únyatájňánavajrasvabhávátmako ’ham, and Om dharma- dhátusvabhavátinako ’ham. With verse 51, he mentions theINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÁJA SYSTEM 157"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"158 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAiinuyoga and this culminates in the contemplation of the ‘primeval lord’ (<adinatha). Then the atiyoga develops vajrasattva (the ‘diamond being’) as the progressed self of the yogin with his body as a mandala (the deha-mandala mentioned earlier in our mandala section). The mahayoga starts with verse 70 and involves the blessing or empowerment of body, speech, and mind, using the mantras of Guhyasamdja, chapter 6 (‘Documents’).Passing to some individual explanations for the four steps, especially as they apply to the Stage of Generation, we note that the Pradipoddyotana (‘Documents’) is helpful for clarifying the 1st step. It is necessary to place consciousness in samadhi. The practitioner then reviews the evocation “from the spot of earth, etc. up to the mandala circle.” He then enters the realm of the void through contemplating the mantra, “Om ¿unyata- jfianavajrasvabhavatmako ’ham” (Om. I am the intrinsic nature of the knowledge diamond of voidness). Hence in this step the officiant evokes the void mandala-palace, also called the ‘perfection of Vajrasattva’.Commenting on the ‘vajra-dyatana’ of the second step of sadhana, namely upasadhana, Snags rim says (f. 363a-6 to 363b-1): “Thugs-rje-£abs explains that vajra means the thirty-two deities from Vairocana down to Sumbharaja; while its base (ayatana) refers to the spots wherein are deposited the syllables of those (deities) in the aggregate of form all the way down to the soles of the feet.” ( / rdo rje ni rnam snan nas gnod mdzes kyi bar so gnis so II dehi skye mched ni gzugs phuri nas rkan mthil gyi bar yin te de dag gis yi ge hgod pahi gnas bstan par thug rje ¿abs hchad do / ). This remark immediately shows the connec­tion between the ‘vajra-dyatana’ of the second sadhana step with the second vajra, the ‘drawing together of germ syllables5 (bijasamhrta) (cf. preceding sub-section). This refei^ to the body-mainjala where thirty-two syllable ^ representing th thirty- two deities are deposited in the app*. priate spots of the body. But without this comment, the relation between the two second ones would not be clear. Also the comment clarifies the Snags rim remarks (362b-6, fif. through 363a-l, 2, 3) that on theStage of Generation the second sadhana yields the ‘incantation body’ (mantra-deha) while the same sadhana, interpreted on the Stage of Completion, yields the ‘knowledge body’ (jdana-kdya).This evocation of a sanctified body, which the Pradipoddyo-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"tana calls the ‘form of Mahamudra’, is alluded to in Nagarjuna’s Pindikrtasadhana (verses 51-52) :.... anuyogarji samdcaret /tatas tryak$arasambhdtaiji sitakundendusannibham /ddinatharp. vicintya....„.. .He should engage upon the Anuyoga. Then, imagin­ing the primeval lord (adinatha) arisen from the three syllables like the white-Jasmine moon....As to the three syllables, these can be either a, 0, and ha, or they can be Om, Ab, and Hum. Thus Mchan hgrel, PTT, Vol. J58, p. 14-3, states : “<z, 0, and ha are the three basic syllables...; that means that from the thirty-two parts of the ‘seminal drop’ (bitida-bodhicitta) the three syllables become 32-fold and gene­rate the gods on the lotus.” This alludes to generation of the thirty-two Guhyasamaja gods from germ syllables. Further­more, Tson-kha-pa’s Rnal hbyor dag pahi rim pa (PTT, Vol. 160,p. 91-1), shows the process of imagining a single bindu (ofboUhicitta) as the syllable Bhrum and from its transformation generating the 4-cornered, 4-doored, etc. palace along with thrones (Step No. 1); and continues :Then the single-part bindu becomes 32 parts upon thethrones, and from their transformation (there arise thesyllables) Oip, Ah, Hum. Then the incantation of each of the seed syllables Hum, etc. gives rise to 32 Jfiana- adhi§{hanas of the three vajras. Therefrom there arise 32 hand symbols of thunderbolt (vajra), etc. (Step No. 2). Therefrom one generates sequentially the bodies of the deities (Step No. 3) :—the foregoing is the ‘way of genera­ting’.In the case of the third step—generation of the bodies of the deities (especially within the practitioner’s own body as a body- mamjala) is presumably what the Kr$nayamaritantra (op. cit.) calls the perfecting of all the circles. The Mchan hgrel on chapter X II (Vol. 158, p. 92-2, 3) adds information for the third step that the perfection here comes from the five abhisam- bodhis. In summary of Nagarjuna’s text, Ratnakaraianti’s Pindikrta-sadhanopdyikd vrtti-ratndvali-ndma (Vol. 62, p. 62) places here the blessing of the sense bases (ayatana), the personality aggregates (.skandha), the elements, the major and minor limbs, by the various 32 deities; and (ibid., p. 77) states that by divi­INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 159"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"160 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAsions of the skandhas, there are Vairocana and the other Tatha- gatas; and so on, down to Sumbharaja (in the feet). These are what the Guhyasamaja calls the ‘lords of the mantras’. The Pradipoddyotana (‘Documents’) alludes to verses X II, 70-71 to explain the blessing, but thereby disagrees with both the Kr$nayamdritanlra and Nagarjuna’s Pindikrta-sadhana which place this blessing or empowerment of Body, Speech, and Mind in the fourth step.The fourth step in the Pradipoddyotana treatment involves imagining the lord on the crown of the officiant’s head, and the five Tathagatas on the heads of all the deities in their particular families. Mchan hgrel (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 92-2, 3) brings in the terminology of the fourth vajra, the ‘invariant ( = letter) placement’, and states that this refers both to letter placement of the samadhi-sattva (tin iie hdzin sems dpah) and to letter place­ment in the body of the vidyd (rig mahi lus la yi ge hgod pa), hence to letter placement of vajra and padma (rdo rje dan pa- dmahi yi ge hgod pa ste), referring of course to the men« ion of vajra and padma in the Pradipoddyotana comment (‘Documents’) on this step. This would then be the ‘overflow mandala’ (utsarga-mandala) spoken of in our mandala section. As was mentioned, other sources place here the empowerment of Body, Speech, and • Mind.Furthermore, the Pradipoddyotana (‘Documents’) clarifies that the M ahasadhana, which is the fourth step, is the accomplish­ment of the aim of others. This agrees with the Guhyasamaja- tantra's explanation of M ahasadhana as a title for chapters 5, 9. 17, and 13, that these chapters have the teaching that liberates one’s great souled disciple. The Pradipoddyotana men­tions that the M ahasadhana includes the ‘best victorious m andala’ and the ‘best victorious rite’. In fact, these are the second and third of a well-known set called the three samadhis.The set of three samadhis constitute a terminology in common between the Yoga-tantra and the Anuttara-yoga-tanu^ classes of tantric literature. Even though there are some differences in explanation of those three, there are strong indications that the Stage of Generation of the Anuttarayoga-tantra is die por­tion of that kind of Tantra that has practices shared .vith the Yoga-tantra. The three samadhis are called ‘preliminary praxis’ (prathamaprayoga), ‘triumphant mandala’ (vijaya-mandala),"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"and ‘victory of the rite’ (karma-vijaya). Snags rim, f. 364a- 1, 2, mentions as the implication of those remarks of the Pradi­poddyotana that the first three steps of service are the ‘preliminary praxis’ and amount to steps that accomplish one’s own aim. The employment of two samadhis to cover the 4th step of yoga helps to resolve the several ways of explaining the 4th step as not constituting rival methods of conducting the rite of that Stage, but rather as suggesting the grouping into two phases. The ‘victorious mandala’ is the initiation phase of the Stage of Generation, involving the five vidya initiations, as they are called. The ‘victory of the rite’ includes those rather strange rites filling up a number of verses in both Chapter 6 and Chapter 12 (‘Documents’) about the ritual eating of different kinds of flesh, in fact the meditative eating of that flesh, credited with leading to supernormal powers (on which I once wrote an article, “Totemic beliefs in the Buddhist Tantras” ). The apportion­ment of rites between the three samadhis can be seen rather 'clearly by placing in concordance with the four steps the mandala rites of the Guhyasamaja which can also be arranged in four parts following the classification of Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras, which in turn is based on the Snags rim.

The third samadhi ‘victory of the rite’ covers the offerings, permission to the disciple (to repeat the ritual himself) and re-unification of the 32 deities into Bodhicitta, as well as concluding acts. This helps to clarify the Mahayoga as the second and third samadhi.Also, it is becoming apparent that there are various ways of stating the four steps of service or yoga, and this may be the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"implication of the remark in Snags rim, f. 364a-1, 2 that for accomplishing the four steps there is a lesser, a middling, and a great (chun hbrin chen po gsum ga dgos pas).Besides, there is Tson-kha-pa’s insistence on correlating tantric materials with the three phases, birth, death, and the inter­mediate state, which are referred to in nidana verse 38, and those three with the three bodies of the Buddha. This is stressed among other places in his independent work Don gsal ba on the Guhyasamdjatantra (PTT. Vol. 160, p. 128). In this way, Dharmakaya goes with death, Sambhogakaya with intermediate state, and Nirmanakaya with birth (cf. the table about the three phases in the. preceding section). There Tsori-kha-pa argues at length about the ‘Adinatha’ (which according to Nagarjuna is the germinal Vajradhara) to the conclusion that the generation of the ‘adinatha’ agrees with the intermediate state. In the foregoing discussion of the four yogas, the genera­tion of the adinatha was placed in the second yoga called anu- yoga. In my article, “The Five-fold Ritual Symbolism of Passion,” I showed Tson-kha-pa’s view that the contemplation of voidness is equivalent to death; and since this contemplation takes place in the first yoga, this step can be correlated with death. That leaves the third step to go with birth, which is reasonable since it is the culminating step for one’s own sake. We therefore have the following line-up of the steps :1. Yoga — symbolic death — Dharmakaya2. Anuyoga — symbolic inter­mediate state — Sambhogakaya3. Atiyoga — symbolic birth — NirmanakayaO f course, such concordances are not m eant to suggest that the Yogin attains such bodies by following through with the several steps. Tson-kha-pa makes it plain that this correlation is meant to establish those steps as the causes in the ‘Stage of Generation’ for the subsequent attainment of those Buddha bodies in the ‘Stage of Completion’.D.

However, Candrakirti’s Pradipoddyotana on Chapter 12 (see ‘Documents’) insists that verse 64 has the implication of these members, especially by the words sevdjndnamrtena; and accord­ingly wrote in comment upon that verse a fairly lengthy account of the six members. This account, curiously, is almost identical with the work Sadanga-yoga (extant in Tibetan), attributed to Nagarjuna (in PTT Vol. 85). It may be that the comment was a traditional one for that block of verses in chapter 18. The same verse block that Candrakirti quoted, plus some more, were later quoted by Naro-pa in his Sekoddeiafikd, a commen­tary on part of the Kalacakra-tantra. Naro-pa devotes much of his subsequent commentary to aspects of those members, follow­ing the Kalacakra tradition. This shows that it was feasible to carry through the tantric praxis in terms of those six members; and the occurrence in the Guhyasamaja, chapter 18, indicates that this formulation was once a viable procedure in this tantric cult.O f course, the names of the six members of yoga are ancient. They are almost the same names as the members of yoga in the Maitri Upanifad. However, over the centuries different inter­pretations have been made of the chief terms; and they do not always occur in the same order as in the Guhyasamajatantra, Also, the order of the members iq this Tantra, while standard in the Anuttarayoga^tantra, has occasioned some sharp disputes. O f course, Nagarjuna’s commentary on the 18th chapter, where the six members are defined, was examined carefully by the commentators, but their silence regarding his commentary when they engage in disputes on these matters is due to Nagar­juna’s way of commenting, which we might call ‘around’ and not ‘to’ the point. However, it is interesting to observe how he did proceed in his commentary, the A$tada§a-patala-vistara- vydkhya.He found his first opportunity to go into the matter when commenting on chapter X V III, verse 24 :trividharji kayavdkcittam guhyam ity abhidhiyate / samajam milanam proktam sarvabuddhabhJ ihanakam 11 The three types, body, speech, and mind, are explained as the ‘secret’.‘Samaja’ is said to be union, the definition of all the Buddhas."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Using remarks based on those three, body, etc., he first explains the three samadhis, ‘preliminary praxis,’ etc.; then the Stage of Generation and the Stage of Completion; then his five kramas in order; the ‘cause’ (,hetu), ‘action’ (karma), a n d ‘fruit’ (phala); then the six members of yoga in order. Then he starts over again, with somewhat different remarks based on those three, body, etc., with which he first explains the three samadhis, then the two stages, then the five kramas in order, then those three, ‘cause’, etc., and finally the six members in order. His next opportunity presented itself when commenting on the definition of Tantra (chapter X V III, verse 33), in particular the expres­sion ‘asamharyci (‘which cannot be led astray’). He says this means the Tantra of the Fruit, free from fear, wherein the achievement Vajradhara, and so on, is conferred by way of the yogin of subtle yoga in the Stage of Generation or the Stage of Completion, or of (the five krama) ‘Diamond Muttering, etc., or of the six members. By this comment he clarifies that his five kramas and the six members are alternate ways of expressing the tantric path (in fact, the Stage of Completion). Then in verse 35, still devoted to definition o f ‘Tantra’, the expressions ‘pancakam trikulam caiva. . . . ’ gave him the opportunity to talk about five-fold sets, three-fold ones, and so on. His five kramas are such a five-fold set, so they are mentioned, along with the three samadhis again; and he cannot mention those without alluding to the six members, so now (PTT. Vol. 60, p. 6-3) he gives a brief definition of each of the six members. When he comes to the block of verses on which Candrakirti commented (‘Docu­ments’) he has a rather lengthy treatment of the six members {op. cit., p. 14-3, 4, 5 and p. 15-1 ) in a manner consistent with Candrakirti’s statement, although having some other materials, and in particular agrees on the disputed point that the dhyana member has the five parts of non-tantric Buddhism and that these do reach up to the Spread-of-Light, Culmination-of- Light, and finally the Clear Light; while also placing the six members in the Stage of Completion. As though that were not enough, he continues (p. 15-1,2) with brief explanations of the benefit resulting from each member, for example, that dhyana yields the five supernormal powers (the teaching of non- tantric Buddhism). There can be no doubt that Nagarjuna gives the subject of the six members its proper due.

And so subsequent centuries of commentators had to dispute over what was meant. In the Guhyasamaja cult, his Paiicakrama triumphed over the six-membered termi­nology, for which we are fortunate to have Candrakirti’s Sanskrit commentary.As we consider Candrakirti’s comments, it seems that the first two members pratydhara and dhyana, amount to a summary of non-tantric Buddhist meditation. In standard meditation, first there is withdrawal of the mind from the multiplicity of external objects, with focussing upon one properly chosen meditative object, which is contemplated in the mind. This is close to the pratydhara of Candrakirti’s explanation which, however, adds some tantric remarks. Then the five parts to Dhyana are the traditional parts assigned to the dhyanas in non-tantric Buddhism which teaches that there are four Dhyana levels or heavens constituting what is called the realm of form (rupa-dhatu), below which is the realm of desire (kama-dhatu) and beyond which is the formless realm (arupa-dhatu). Yv(hile it is true that the further explanations given by Candrakirti for the five parts of dhyana are not how those same words are explained in the Abhi- dharma treatises, it is intriguing to notice his remark that the fifth part “ is engendered as light-only and the ultimate that is one with universal void.” This claim that dhyana reaches up to the Clear Light (of which ‘universal void’ is a synonym) practically admits that the Clear Light is an experience at the top of the realm of form, which is precisely where M ahayana Buddhism places the Complete Buddha in a heaven called Akanistha with a body called Sambhogakaya. But what sense is there to commenting that way, when dhyana precedes the next member, 3. prandydma* in which there is no mention of experience of the Clear Light, but which is a necessary preliminary of the next ntember 4. dhdrand which covers the mystic experience of entering the Clear Light ? It makes sense only if one takes into account the kinds of Clear Light as in the previous section that summarized the varieties in a table. That is to say, the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM167Clear Light reached by the dhyana member is not the Clear Light of the ‘Supreme Entity’; but, on the other hand, what is its Clear Light is not definite without further information about this member of yoga, especially since there was a controversy about the first two members.Tson-kha-pa’s commentary on Paňcakrama, PTT, Vol. 158, p. 196-4, says :I sgron.ma rab gsal las sor bsam giiis sems dben daň / srog rtsoí rdor bzlas daň / hdzin pa hod gsal dah / rjes dr an daň tin he hdzin zuh hjug tu hdus par bšad de / According to the Pradipoddyotana, (among the six members) pratydhara and dhyana are incorporated in secret state of mind (citta-viveka); prdnaydma in diamond muttering (vajrajdpa) (i.e. secret state of speech, vag-viueka); dhdrana in Clear Light; anusmrti and samadhi in pair-united (yuga- naddha).This Tibetan tradition then proceeded to reject a portion of Candrakirti’s position, and by implication, Nagarjuna’s com­mentary on the 18th chapter. This is made clear in Tson- kha-pa’s commentary Mthah gcod (PTT. Vol. 156, pp. 50-52, ‘Deciding among the alternatives’ for chapter 12). He says (p. 51-2-4) : “According to the Pradipoddyotana, both pratydhara and dhyana are the arcane mind (citta-viveka) (sor bsam giiis sems dben) . . . . ” Later he says (p. 52-4-4): “ In our school, if one treats the six members as six stages of the Stage of Comple­tion, then we heartily endorse Sgra-dbyans-bcu-gcig-pa (for his position) to treat both pratydhara and dhyana as the arcane body (kdyavivekaY ’ (rail gi lugs kyis rdzogs rim gyi rim pa drug la yan lag drug sbyar na / sor bsam giiis lus dben la sbyor ba sgra dbyaňs bcu gcig pa ltar legs so / ).

Wiiat Tsoii-kha- pa means by the words “ if one treats” is that some authorities treated the first two members as part of the preceding Stageof Generation. Thus, there are three possibilities posited :1. The first two members belong to the Stage of Completion as ‘arcane mind’; 2. they belong there as ‘arcane body’;3. they belong to the Stage of Generation.A part of the dispute is exposed in Bu-ston’s commentary Bšad sbyar on the Pradipoddyotana (Collected Works, Ta, f. 172 b,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"168 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRApublished in Part 9): “Here, the ácárya Abhayákaragupta held that pratydhara and dhyana belonged to the Stage of Generation; that prdndydma is Diamond Muttering, dhdrand is the Illusory Body and the Clear Light, and that anusmrti and samadhi are Yuganaddha. And the author K um ára claimed that pratyd- hdra and dhyana are the arcane mind, and that anusmrti is the Illusory Body. Neither are correct” ( / hdir slob dpon a-bhyas/ sor sdud bsam gtan bskyed rim daň / srog rtsol rdo rje bzlas pa daň I hdzin pa sgyu lus hod gsal daň / rjes dran tiň hdzin zuň hjug bstan / žes pa daň / ku-má-ras / sor sdud bsam gtan sems dben / rjes dran sgyu lus su byed pa mi hthad de /). In the case of Abhayákaragupta, Bu-ston gives the obvious reason that the position is in conflict with the Uttara-tantra (as cited in ‘Documents’) which places all six members in the superior category understood to be the Stage of Completion; but the reason Abhayákaragupta was forced into his position is that Nágárjuna’s Pancakrama begins with Diamond Muttering (=pramydma, member No. 3). However, Bu-ston apparently believes that the refutation of Abhayákaragupta takes care of Kum ára’s position as well—presumably on the grounds that pratydhara and dhyana cannot be arcane mind except in the con­ceptual meaning proper to the ¿ ta g e o f Generation; but, as we saw, Candrakirti may well have this pqsition even though he places all six members in the Stage of Completion (‘Documents’). Bu-ston continues by saying, “ Some teach the caryd with pratyd- hdra and the arcane body with dhyana; that is most certainly wrong” ( I kha cig sor sdud kyis spyod pa bstan / bsam gtan gyis lus dben bstan / žes pa sin tu mi hthad de). By ‘caryd’ Bu-ston refers to the technical use of this term, of which there are three kinds alluded to in Tsoii-kha-pa’s annotation of niddna verse 26 (which see).Although Bu-ston denies ‘arcane body’ to dhyana, he goes on to give his own position, “Hence, when one combines the six membered yoga with the five kramas, prdtyahdra and dhyana are included in Illusory Body” (/ des na sbyor ba yan lag drug lam rim pa lňar sdud na sor sdud bsam gtan sgyu lus su hdus te/). He also quotes approvingly that “ one sees samvrli-satya with pratydhara” (so sor sdud pas kun rdzob kyi bden pa mthoň baho). Although there may be a difference in usage of the term ‘arcane body’, it appears to me that Tsoň-kha-pa accepts Bu-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"ston’s position; and Tsoh-kha-pa’s annotation of nidana verses22-23 (on Ka-ya) seenis indebted to Bu-ston’s comment on this ‘K a’ (op. cit.y f. 55b). The solution was to call these two members the ‘samvrti-maya’ stages.My own solution of the nidana grouping took account of the mention in verse 22 of the word nispanna-krama (Stage of Completion) and in verse 23 of the word nispanna-yoga (Yoga of Completion). Since these two verses go with the word ‘Ka- ya’, it is clear that the author of the nidana verses of the Vajra- mdld explanatory tantra understood the Stage of Completion to begin with an emphasis on ‘body’. To deny that this is ‘arcane body’ but then to affirm that it is Illusory Body—as Bu-ston did—seems an unnecessary quibbling over words. The nature of this ‘body’ will become clearer as we proceed.Now, the Guhyasamajatantra has an earlier treatment of yoga that seems to belong to the Stage of Completion, namely in its chapter 6 (see ‘Documents’). Verses 3»-6 constitute the impor­tant block, and we present them here again with the Sanskrit corrected and translated with the help of the Pradipoddyotana, Tsoii-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrel, as well as with the Samdhivydkarana (PTT, Vol. 3, p. 239-3-8) for verse 5:mantranidhyaptikdyena vdcd manasi coditah / sddhayet pravararji siddhlrfi manahsanto$anam pnydm //3// cittanidhyaptinairatmyatji vacakdyavibhdvanamj nifpadayet tmamyogam dkdSasamalalayam // 4 // kayavdkcittanidhyapteh svabhdvo nopalabhyate / mantramUrtiprayogena bodhir vind ca bhavandm 11 5 '// vicaiyedam samasena kdyavakcittalakfanam / bhavayed bodhisarfiyogatji samadhirji manirakalpitam // 6 //The one who has body as the mantra visualized should accomplish, exhorted by speech in the mind, the ‘surpass­ing one’, ‘successful one’, ‘one satisfying the mind,’ ‘beloved one’.He should accomplish the selflessness of citla being visua­lized, (then) the contemplation of speech (vdcd) and body, (then) the triple conjunction, (finally) the abode equal to space.The self-existence of body-, speech-, and mind-visualiza- tion is not reached by the praxis of mantra-body, nor is revelation in the absence of contemplation.INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAjA SYSTEM 169"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"170 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÀJATANTRAHaving pondered in brief this characteristic of body> speech, and mind, he should contemplate the samadhi ‘Conjunction to revelation* as constructed by mantra.

There are four states (avasthd) to be achieved in the stream of consciousness of a yogin (yogi- satfitana) : ‘surpassing one* because it outlasts diamond mutter­ing (vajrajâpàd adhikatvdt) ; ‘successful one’, i.e. the Svâdhisçhâna ( = mahamudra ) ; ‘one satisfying the mind’ because it is the puri­fication of the mahamudra (mahâmudm-vtiuddhikaratvât) ; ‘beloved one*, which generates the body of M ahàvajradhara.Y And these four successive states are respectively, ‘the selflessness of citta being visualized’; ‘the contemplation of speech and body*; ‘the triple conjunction’ as the divine body made of mind (mano- maya-devatârüpaqi) ; and ‘the abode equal to space’. Therefore, ‘exhorted by speech in the mind’ refers to the diamond mutter­ing which is outlasted by the citta visualized. This diamond muttering is preceded by an achievement referred to as ‘body as the m antra visualized*. The ‘body as the mantra visualized’ must be the achievement of the Stage <j>f Generation kept over for the Stage of Completion, because having already achieved that much, the practitioner will naturally carry over that bodily attainment to the next stage, that of Completion.The ‘self-existence of body-, speech-, and mind-visualization’ means the self-existence of the three lights, respectively prajna, upâya, and upalabdhi, that is to say, ‘the selflessness of citta being visualized’. That self-existence is not reached by the praxis of mantra-body, i.e. by. having ‘body as the mantra visualized’, because, the foregoing members show that it is necessary to be ‘exhorted by speech in the mind’. On the other hand, without contemplation (‘body as the mantra visualized*) neither is revelation reached. Having appreciated this point, ‘he should contemplate the samadhi “ Conjunction to revelation” as constructed by m antra.’While there are definitely six stages in that formulation, there is no expressed indication that the Guhyasamdjatantra (first 17 chapters) has in mind here such a division—as the Uttara-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"tantra imposes, of Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion, It may have implied the two in the dvandva of the title, rahasydti- rahasya. But our foregoing materials make it quite clear that the ‘body as the mantra visualized5 is indeed the accomplish­ment of the Stage of Generation. If one leaves out that body, the remainder of the members in that passage of chapter 6 pertain to what became called the Stage of Completion. In such a case, the first member in this second series is the one called ‘exhorted by speech in the mind5, that is to say, diamond mutter­ing attended with prdndydma. Tson-kha-pa’s commentary‘Deciding the alternatives’ for the chapter 6 (op. cit., Vol. 156, pp. 25-5 to 26-1) cites in this connection the Vajramdld explana­tory tantra (actually in chapter 68, the last chapter):I rdo rje bzlas par rab sbyor has /I rlun gi mtshan did ¿es nas ni /I mam rtog rlud mams mam par gcod /I sems la dmigs pa thob par (igyur //I bdag la byin brlabs rim pas kyad /I ddos grub brgyad ni thob par hgyur /I snan ba la sogs dbye ba Ses // mdon ' par byad • chub pa ni hthob /I zun hjug rim pa la gnas pa /I ddos gmb thams cad bsdus pa ni /I tshe frdi did la hgrub hgyur bar /I mal frbyor pa yis the tshom med //The one who by the praxis of diamond muttering under­stands the characteristic of the wind(s), destroys the vikalpa-winds and attains visualization of the citta. Then, by the Svadhi§{hana-krama he wins the eight siddhis. Knowing (already) the distinctions of light (dloka), etc. he gains the Abhisaipbodhi. Stationed on the Yuga- naddha-krama, the yogin doubtless accomplishes in this very life the sum of all siddhis.Immediately after this passage, Tson-kha-pa points out that this is the source of the five kramas. It cannot be doubted that Nagarjuna based his Padcakrama work especially upon the sixth chapter of the Guhyasamdja and the explanatory tantra Vajramdld. He has not altered the terminology in the names of the five kramas : 1. Diamond Muttering (Vajrajapa), 2. Purification of consciousness (CittavijSuddhi), 3. Personal Blessing (Sva-INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 171"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"172YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAdhisthana), 4. Revelation-Enlightenment (Abhisambodhi). 5. Pair-wise united (Yuganaddha). Near the beginning of his first krama, he has this summary statement consistent with that sixth chapter and with the Vajramald position :4B. manlranidhyaptim agamya vajrajapah su§ik$yate5. vajrajapasthito mantri cittanidhyaptim dpnuyat mayopamasamadhistho bhUtakotyam samavikt6. bhutakofeh satnuitif(han?i advayajndnam apnuydt yuganaddhasamddhistho na kiijicic chifate punahHaving understood the mantra-visualization, he trains himself with diamond muttering. Firm in diamond muttering, the yogin achieves the citta-visualization. Stationed in the illusory samadhi, he enters the true limit. Emerging from the true limit, he achieves the non-dual knowledge. Stationed in the pair-wise united samadhi, there is nothing more for him to learn.That is to say, after one has gained the mantra-body (in the Stage of Generation) he proceeds to the Stage of Completion with that kind of body prepared by yoga (which therefore may or may not be counted as the initial part of the Stage of Com­pletion). If the mantra-body in its developed status as an “arcane body” is not counted in the numbering, then the first member is the diamond muttering. The yogin outlasts this with the state of visualizing the three Lights with their associated eighty prakrtis. Stationed in the illusory samadhi, to wit, with the Illusory Body, he enters the Clear Light in this stage of Personal Blessing {svadhiythdna). In the stage of Abhisam­bodhi, by the reverse order of the Lights, he achieves the non­dual knowledge. Finally, he attains the yuganaddha wherein there is nothing further to lear# .(afaikfa-yuganaddha).Now returning to our considerations of the six-membered yoga on which Candrakirti wrote his comments, it seems that the set of terms applies to the yoga praxis in a period prior to this terminology of two main Stages. When it was decided (per Nagarjuna’s system) to begin the Stage of Completion with the diamond muttering along with prdndydmay the third member of the other terminological system, it became a problem of how to define the first two members 1. pratydhdra and 2. dhyana in a manner applicable to the Stage of Completion. Nagarjuna evaded the issue in his commentary on the 18th chapter in which"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM173the six-membered yoga was presented. The solution adopted by Tson-kha-pa is that they represent the arcane body (<kdya- viveka).With the help of Candrakïrti’s explanations (“Documents” ), and availing ourselves of the preceding data, the rest of the correlation in terms of the Guhyasamâja cult can be set up as follows :six-membered yoga five stages3.

Here the Buddha passed beyond the realm of desire up through the various divisions of the realm of form and then the divisions of the formless realm until he reached the cessation of ideas and feelings. He then reversed himself, going through the downward stages in order until he arrived at the lowest division of the realm of form. He then proceeded upwards again until he arrived at the top of the realm of form and then entered Parinirvâna. Later, in Mahâyâna Buddhism, for example in the Lankâvatâra-sütra, the place where he had entered Parinirvâna was considered the place where one is initiated as a Complete Buddha.E.

This involves some disputed points about the “arcane body”. Some authorities held that the “arcane body” was restricted to the Stage of Completion. In the course of Tson-kha-pa’s lengthy discussion of this topic in his Pahcakrama commentary, he states (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 201-4,7,8) : “Sincethe Carydmelapaka has stated the arcane body of one hundred lineages to three lineages and then compressed into one lineage, with the Stage of Generation as the basis of inclusion, they should be included there, and so (in that case) it is not proper to in­clude them in the Stage of Completion (rigs brgya nas gsum gyi bar gyi lus dben rnams rigs gcig gi lus dben du sdud par spyod bsdus las gsuns pas / bsdu rgyu bskyed rim der de rnams bsdus pa rdzogs rim du mi run bahi phyir ro/). When we know that Tson-kha-pa held Aryadeva’s Caryameldpakapradipa in highest esteem and drew from that work the entire material on the “ hundred lineages” after comparing three versions of Arya­deva’s text then extent in Tibet, we must conclude that Tson- kha-pa gives his own position as far as the “ hundred lineages” is concerned. Since Tson-kha-pa refers to those “ hundred lineages” as “arcane body”, it is clear to me that his “arcane body” annotations on nidana verses, starting with verse 14 in my third group, is his way of placing those verses in the set describing the Stage of Generation. Although the “hundred lineages” stem ultimately from Aryadeva’s work (in the Peking edition, PTT, Vol. 61, p. 295-5, line 7, to 297-5, line 8), I have taken them from the edited form in Tsoh-kha-pa’s Pancakrama commentary. Here, Tson-kha-pa (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 201-3-7) mentions that when the “arcane body” is included in the Stage of Generation, it is placed in the Atiyoga step, which is the third of the four steps. Ratnakarasanti also implies that the “arcane body” is located in the third step by our information included from his book that the blessing is of the sense bases, personality aggregates, the elements and the major and minor limbs.The “arcane body” , which thus begins with yoga praxis in the third step, must continue through the fourth step for the simple"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"reason that it is present at the outset of the next stage, that of Completion. We shall see that this observation agrees with the three kinds of carya of the Stage of Generation, which are illustrated in the Tathagata verses (nidana verses 18-21). It thus becomes obvious that the nidana verses which invite commen­tary of portions of the “ hundred lineages” belong to the Stage of Generation, and also obvious that the nidana verses beginning with verse 2 2, which speaks for the first time about the yoga of “ completion” , belong to the Stage of Completion. All my further collection of material confirmed this division and worked out with continual consistency.Upon scanning the various commentaries on the Pradipoddyo- tana in the Tanjur, I find only one commentator who attempts to group the nidana verses. One reason for the general silence of the sub-commentators is that the commentarial flow is inter­rupted by stopping to comment in a completely different way, as would be necessary with arguments in the case of the nidana karikas, since Candraklrti had cited them only in a block without individual remarks or grouping suggestions. Thus, even pre­suming that these commentators had their own thoughts about grouping, ordinarily it would be only such an independent commentary as the D&lai Lama referred to (cf. Preface) that would try to explain the verses from all possible angles including grouping. By the one commentator I mean the Kumara whose Pradipoddyotana commentary was noticed in a preceding section. He is probably the same Kumara who is listed as a translator of Bhavyakirti’s long commentary on the same Pradipoddyotana, so he may even have been a personal disciple of Bhavyakirti. His commentary is rather brief; he calls it a (ippani-hrdayadarfa (‘Annotation which is the Mirror of the H eart’), and so he concerns himself with what he considers the most important elements of the work he is commenting on, rather than comment­ing on everything. It is worthwhile to present his solution, even though I do not accept it. .H e apparently followed this initial course of reasoning: .At the end of the citation of the forty verses by. the Pradipoddyotana, there appears Candrakirti’s signal ‘garbhyartha? (T. sbas pa or sbas don). In a previous in- trocluction, I have shown that Candrakirti’s ‘garbhyartha’ has the three varieties of ‘pregnant sense clarifying the doctrine of lust’, ‘pregnant sense revealing conventional truth’ (= IllusoryINTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMAJA SYSTEM 1 75"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Body), and ‘pregnant sense considering the three jdanas\\ Also Tsoň-kha-pa’s Mchan hgrél mentions these three varieties when annotating that word ‘sbas pa5 at the end of the forty verses, so it was quite reasonable for Kum ára to expect that the three varieties would be found presented among the forty verses. However, it is one thing to exemplify the three varieties some­where or other; and another thing for the forty verses to fall into three groups, as Kurnara forces them (PTT, Vol. 60, p. 219-5). His first group amounts to verses 1 through 9 :I E ni šes rab dam pa did ces bya ba nas / rnam šes did ni Ida poho kes bya bahi bar gyis ni sems rnam par dag pa hi rim pa yin no H ye šes gsum rnam par hbyed pa ni gcig tu sbas palii don no /.From, ‘ ‘‘E ” signifies the Noble Women Prajňá,’ down to ‘perception (vijdana), the fifth’, is the stage ‘purification of the m ind’ (citta-višuddhi). Analyzing the three gnoses (jdanatraya) is one kind of ‘pregnant sense’.The second group constitutes verses 10-18 :I mnam did so sot rtog pa dad kes bya ba nas / de dad der rigs las hbyud ba / lha daň lha mo tha dad pa de ni yod min de med kyaň / hgro bahi don phyir ston pa yin kes bya bahi bar gyis ni I lhahi sku rnam par dag pa mdon tu hgro bahi rdo rje bzlas pahi rim pa bstan to I I dehi nan nas phyag rgyabkini rgyas gdab ciň kes bya bas ni saňs rgyas spy an la sogs pa ham dgug pa dad kugs pa la sogs pa ham / las kyi phyag rgya la sogs paho / I de ňid hdod chags kyi chos ston pahi sbas pahi don gnis paho / From ‘(the knowledges) Equality,.

Among those (verses) the phrase ‘sealed by four seals’ (verse 16) implies either Buddhalocaná and the other goddesses; or attract­ing, drawing in, etc. (the four steps in bringing non­duality with the jnana-bemg); or the karma-mudra, etc. Exactly that is the other kind of ‘pregnant sense’ which teaches the doctrine of lust.The third group includes verses 19-40 :I hdi las gňis med mthod bahi kes bya ba nas / sbas paho kes176 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE GUHYASAMÄJA SYSTEM177bya bahi bar gyi ni sgyu ma Ita buhi tiň ňe hdzin bstan pa ste I de kho na raň byin gyis brlab pahi rim bstan paho / / kun rdzob kyi bden pa la de ma thag mňon par byaň chub pahi rim pa ni sbas pahi don gsum paho /From ‘Afterwards, who sees the non-duality* down to (the signal) ‘pregnant sense’—teaches the illusory samadhi (mayopama-samadhi), and only that teaches the Svádhisthána- krama. Immediately after that ‘conventional truth’, there is the Abhisambodhi-krama. So the third ‘preg­nant sense’.The weakness of Kumara’s solution can be judged from these viewpoints: (1) It was reasonable for him to impose stagesfrom Nagarjuna’s Paňcakrama, but he does not adhere to the order of the kramas, interchanging the first and second—Cittaviáuddhi and Vajrajápa. By applying these stages throughout, which are prevalent on the ‘Stage of Completion’ he leaves no group of niddna verses to depict the ‘Stage of Generation’, which be­lies Candrakirti’s verse to the effect that the forty verses explain the Guhyasamdjatantra, which on the strength of Kumara’s divisions has no Stage of Generation at all. (2) I t was reason­able for him to apply the terminology of three kinds of ‘preg­nant sense’ but it is contrary to the obvious data of the verses to divide them into three consecutive groups on this basis. For example, the ‘three knowledges (jňánatraya) kind of pregnant sense in fact covers the verses 1-7, 25-26, 30, 32, and 36-38. (3) His solution takes no account of the words of the niddna sentence, because his second group (verses 10-13) goes down to the first ta of tathagata. He evinces no indication that he tried to relate the subject matter of the verses to the words which furnish the forty syllables.Having by those considerations eliminated the one classical attempt to group the verses, the way is clear to group them, by appeal to the evidence of the verses themselves. The forty verses divide into sets on the basis of the Stage of Generation and the Stage of Completion, as previously discussed. Verse 22 employs the expression nifpanna-krama (‘Stage of Completion’). Therefore, the last nineteen verses are devoted to the Stage of Completion.Then, within the two sets of verses some groups are obvious and others require further justification.

The full picture in each case is provided in the respective groups. Now I present the final arrangement with some minimal remarks :I. The Stage of Generation*A. Evam maya Srutam*B. Ekasmin samaye.C.

Samádhi (= Yuganaddha)—Sádhana and MahasádhanaIt might be objected that E-VAM applies to both Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion, and therefore it is improper to restrict it to the Stage of Generation, as in my solution. To this argument, one may respond that it is usual in the beginning of the path (e.g. the ten-staged Bodhisattva path, or the present Tantric path of two Stages) for the guru to tell the disciple the steps that lie ahead so that he may be realistic about the course he is to follow with its expected fruits. Accordingly, it is quite proper for E-VAM, which condenses the entire path, to appear first and to head the Stage of Generation. This would be the E-VAM of the path of attainment, among the three kinds of E-VAM to be explained later.Here also a few remarks are in order regarding the correlation of the shared steps of service with parts of the Stage of Comple­tion.

Upasadhana in the Stage of Generation evokes the ‘primeval lord* (ddinatha) with a mantra-body (a kind of mahamudrd). In the Stage of Completion, the Abhisaipbodhi-krama represents the emergence from the Clear Light with the Saipbhoga body, a knowledge- body (also a kind of mahamudrd). Therefore Upasadhana is the superior step in this case. The remaining correlation is by reason of the distinction in this literature of ‘coupling in the realm of learning’ (£aik$a-yuganaddha) and ‘coupling beyond learning’ (afaikfa-yuganaddha). While there is a beginning of this faikfayuganaddha in the Abhisaipbodhi-krama, both kinds o f yugnnaddha are proper to Yuganaddha-krama. Sadhana in the Stage of Generation accomplishes the body-man^ala and one’s own aim; therefore, in the Stage of Completion, it fulfills the iaik$ayuganaddha of being a Buddha ‘in this life’ as the lord ‘with eight gunas* (niddna verse 34). Mahasadhana in the Stage of Generation serves the aim of others; therefore, in the Stage of Completion it is the aiaik$a-yuganaddha, equivalent to the ‘Nirvana of no-fixed abode*, or the Complete Buddha (Sarp- buddha or Abhisaipbuddha).Besides, the basis laid in the Stage of Generation for the later ac­complishment of the Stage of Completion can be treated in terms of Tsoh-kha-pa’s correlation with the three Bodies of the Buddha.The set “Thus by me it was heard” is associated with silence, death, and the Dharmakaya. For as Nagarjuna pointed out in his commentary on chapter 18, when the Bodhisattvas were reduced to silence it was because they heard the teaching and entered one-pointed concentration. Thus they became affiliat­ed with the Mind of the Buddha.The set “Upon an Occasion” is correlated with magical Speech, the intermediate state, and the Sambhoga-kaya, by evocation of the primeval lord.Then, the set “The Bhagavat—All” affiliates the yogin with the Buddha’s Body, the Nirmana-kaya, or birth, as the fulfil­ment of the microcosm.The fourth set, “Tathagata” , involves all the previous three, by imagining the Acts of the Buddha in projection upon the external world, the macrocosm.INTRODUCTION TO THE OUHYASAMAjA SYSTEM 179"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"180YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAThen, in the direct order of the three ‘doors’, the yogin ex­periences the Body, the Speech, and the Mind, arriving at the supreme plane, the Clear Light.

May the destroyer of phenomenal life remove from me all this uncertainty !Having heard this discourse of the master of the gods, concerning a merit of the Illustrious Doctrine, the Lord then conferred a ‘Sadhu’ (‘Excellent !*) and spoke as follows :For the purpose of seeing everything, the term ‘evam* is stated first. Master of the gods, listen to that which, in regular order according to its full extent, has the count of 84,000 dharmaskandhas, namely, the two syllables* father-mother, the universal receptacle, which express the same.E is the mother; VA the father, the bindu (rp) there the union, and that union a marvel.

Whatever person not knowing (the reality) would constantly recite the two syllables he, outside the Buddha-dharmas, would be like a rich man missing the enjoyment.

It may be intended that knowledge through experience is made possible by the degrees of aversion, which seems to be the psychological premise of the Apoha doctrine of Buddhist logic. In this doc­trine a thing is defined by exclusion of what it is not. A ‘cow* is the not not-cow. W hat might well be the explanation is that to have the concept cow in the mind requires that a dis­tinct idea of cow be formed, the very clarity and determination of which invloves the removal {apoha) of all other non-cow entities. In this way, experiential knowledge (parijildna) occurs with the ‘aversion’ to everything inconsistent with and contrary to that knowledge. Understanding begins with a. kind of retreat.

There­upon the Victorious Ones dwelling in the diamond of the sky and fulfilled like the sesame fruit, spoke to the Son of the Victorious Ones with a single sound by the snap of fingers. ‘Impure is this meditation and non- conducive to the desired goal. Take as meditative object the Clear Light, beyond like the dome of the sky.

Also, in his commentary on the Caturdeuipariprcchd (Lhasa Coll. Works, Vol. Ca, f. 37b-6 to 38a-l): “The three vijñanas proceed from the 18-fold dhar-madhatu which is the Clear Light of Death.

T hen Bhavyakirti quotes two texts without naming their sources. T he first is the celebrated verse of the Sarjidhinirmocana-sütra (which was translated by Etienne Lamotte into French; and the verse is in Louis de la Vallée Poussin, Vijňaplimátratásiddhi, I, p. 173): “The âdânavijnàna, profound and subtle, like aviolent current, proceeds with all its seeds (bija). Deeming it improper for them to imagine it as a self, I have not taught it to the immature auditors” (/ ji skad du / len pahi rnam par šes pa zab ciň phra / sa bon thams cad chu bohi rgyun bžin hbab / bdag tu rtog par gyur na mi ruň žes / ftan thos byis pa rnams la ňas ma bstan / žes hbyuň ba). The next one he quotes, is a well-known line from the Madhyànta-vibhàga (I, 8A; 20 in Gadjin M. Nagao’s edition of theBhàjya): “Andthe imagination of unreality (abhütaparikalpa) is. the three worlds with their citta and caitta” (/ de bžin du yaň / yaň dag m a yin kun brtags ni / sems daň sems byuň khams gsum pa / žes hbyuň ňo /). These quotations do not necessarily mean that Bhavyakirti makes the usual identification of âdânavijnàna with âlayavijnàna> which he equates with the avidyá having seven prakrtis; but it certainly means that he considers the * vijnàna’ of nidàna verse 5 to be this âdânavijnàna as well as abhü- taparikalpa; and so he may understand by 'âdânavijnàna’ all three vijňánas rather than simply álayavijňdna. Since his àla- yavijňána is equivalent to verse 3’s 'avidyá’, it is unacceptable to Tsoň-kha-pa, who rejects the equation in PTT, Vol, 159, p.31-3. In fact, both Bu-ston and Tsoň-kha-pac in their annota­tion of the nidàna verses agree in ignoring Bhavyaklrti’s commen­tary.

There­fore their path is the three ndtjlis, left, right, and middle. Hence, ‘at whatever one,’ left, or right, or middle, ‘the wind stops’, it generates while arising there the com­parable prakrti or sort of caitasika-dharma. Accordingly, the wind arising in the path of the left nat}i generates the (thirty-three) prakrtis which have prajñd nature; the one of the right, the (forty) prakrtis of updya; and the one in the middle generates the (seven) prakrtis of avidyd. However, that ijeeds dependence on a support of con­sciousness (dlambana). . . .Thus, the prakrtis arise from apprehending a sensory object consistent with the basic m ultitude (of deeds).T he implication of the Manimdld commentary is that as long as the winds are correlated with external objects, the lights of the three nails are unsteady.

The meaning of this group of verses is frequ­ently referred to in Tibetan literature such as Tson-kha-pa’s writings as ‘the basic time* {gkihi dus) to contrast w ith ‘time of the path’ (lam gyi dus). In the path, the yogin seeks to evoke; the entire cycle, passing through the portals of death as an experience of yoga and then returning to normal consciousness. In preparation for the separation from the coarse body of a subtle body called the Illusory Body that takes place in the Stage of Completion, in the present phase the practitioner develops a body which is called the M antra body. This takes place in the second sddhana called Anuyoga with depositing of germ syllables in spots of the body. It corresponds in ex­ternal manqlala ritual to the second part ‘Rites of preparatory acts,* such as pitching the lines with chalk and beseeching the gods. A similar result is obtained in the present instance if the practitioner, following through the suggestions of this set of verses, goes through the imaginative procedure of analyzing his make-up and then of identifying his personality aggregates with the five winds and so on.

All those beinjgs are called sattva (‘sentient being*). This work also gives the tantric version of Buddhist genesis that was introduced into Tibetan literature such as Tsoh-kha-pa’s writings. Kluhi-blo mentions, p. 8-4, that after the men of the first aeon tasted the amrta, and so on down to their partaking of the primeval grain, whereupon their bodies became heavy— the light disappeared, and a darkness ensued; and then the sun and moon appeared in the world. At this time, through the separation of prajhd and updya, the beings became distinguished with the male and female organs. Gradually, m utual craving was aroused, whereupon these beings, known as gandharvas, experienced the three states (avasthd), and entered into the wombs of ‘mothers*. Then the women, without illness, began to have menses; and a ‘father* and ‘m other’ through desire for each other, engaged in various sexual techniques. Seeing this, for the sake of ‘indulgencc-in-desire*, a vijnana-pati, as though riding on a horse ( = the wind), left the intermediate state and entered (the m other) through the Vairocana-portal (i.e. the crown of the head) (and then merged with the agglomeration in the womb).

Tson-kha-pa’s rejection of this appli­cation of Yogácára terms is consistent with how we may interpret those Vajr amala verses in its chapter 32. T hat is because, in terms of Buddhist Dependent Origination, the Vajramald verses can be interpreted as setting álayavijñána equi­valent to 3. vijñána as a stream of consciousness which had undergone death’s traum a and now (having 1. avidyd and 2. sarjiskára, as ‘conditions’) with reviving habit-energy is attracted to a new birthplace offering a field for evolving perceptions T hat phase of attraction to the womb is stated in terms of gandharva-consciousness in Tson-kha-pa’s Snags rim chen mo (f. 438a-4,5):I de las stoñ chen ñer thob ste dri zahi sems so /I de las thabs snah ba mched pa hdodpa ñe bar len pahi sems so / I de las ks rab snah ba ste skye ba gzuh bahi sems so /."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"204YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÂJATANTRAFrom that (Clear Light of D eath) comes the great void, Culmination-of-Light, which is the gandharva-conscious- ness.

Furthermore, the order of elements in the verse is that in which the equivalent goddesses Locanà, Mâmàkï, Pânçlarâ, and Tàrà ask their questions in the explanatory tantra Caturdevipariprcchâ.The four elements and their evolutes constitute the aggregate of form (rüpa-skandha) among the five aggregates. Vijñána uses this aggregate of form to become embodied in the âlaya (‘abode’) which means the womb according to Mchan hgrel on the present verse. Hence, the verse practically defines the celebrated term álayavijñána, which thus means ‘vijñána in (or toward) the womb’ as the 3rd member of Dependent Origination or a phase of that member. The location of vijñána in the womb is understood to be the place which becomes the heart of the new being. Thus, in his Dkah gnad commentary on the Guhyasamâja (Lhasa ed., Vol. Ca, 10a -l), Tsoñ-kha-pa starts by quoting passages about the supreme A, the indestruct­ible syllable in the middle of the heart; and says, “ In short, the very place where the vijñána along with its ‘together-born’ (sahaja) wind enters amidst the ‘semen-blood’, is the heart.

Then the five veins of the heart are originated.

The other four goddesses are placed in the four directions and are said to be the self­existence of the four elements (dhátu-svabháua). As the other cakras are established these goddesses transfer their essence accordingly; so it is theoretically possible to identify the four goddesses of the directions with the four of the Guhyasamdja, Locaná and so on. The numbers of petals in the other cakras are hiultiples of the original four directional veins of the heart. In the full list, according to the Sňags rim, f. 436b-4, quotation from A bhayakaragupta’s Ámnáya-maňjarí, there are 4 petals at the U snísa-cakra (crown of head at place of Brahm arandhra), 32 at the forehead cakra (sometimes misunderstood to be at the crown of the head because of the Tibetan word spyi bo), 16 at the throat, 8 as mentioned at the heart, 64 at the navel, 32 at the cakra of the sacral place, and 8 at the ‘tip of the gem’ (root of the penis). However, the intrauterine order of es­tablishing the element bases, according to the Sňags rim discus­sion, shows reversal within the pairs of the niddna verse: 1st m onth ‘w ater5 vortex in heart; 2nd, ‘earth5 vortex in sacral region; 3rd, ‘wind5 vortex in navel; 4th, ‘fire5 vortex in throat (or neck).

The old Buddhist order of stating the skandhas, to wit : rupa, vedandy sarpjhd, sarjiskdra, vijhana—is said by Buddhaghosa in Visuddhimagga (of course in terms of the Pali equivalents) not to be the order of arising, rather to be the order of expla­nation difficulty, starting from the easiest to explain, namely rupa. Hence, when it is a matter of giving definitions of the skandhasy that explanation order is followed.(2) The locations of the skandhas is hinted at in a passage of the Guhyasamdjatantra, Chap. XVI, verses 66-67A, which I discussed at length in my article, “ The fivefold Ritual Symbolism of Passion,” Part I.

Whereby one feels joy and suffering and the highest calm; cold, heat, and the furtherest supreme—that is explained as the aggregate of feelings (vedaná-skandha). It has the character of Ratnasambhava and the egoity of Tathágata manifestation.3. Whereby one recognizes a cow, an ass, a jackal, a horse, a deer, a hog; father, mother, brethren on the father’s side; friends, relations on the mother’s side, etc.— that characteristic of idea aggregate (samjňá-skandha) is the Tathágata Amitábha and that clarifies the mani­festation.4. The thorough knowledge pervading the world, the fruit of good and evil deeds, besides being named the indeterminate (avyakrta), what is explained as their moti­vations (.sarjiskara-skandha) is Amoghasiddhi, the own- being (svabhdva) of the manifestation.5. The perception of presences and absences of samsara, etc.; what has the nature of vikalpa-arising, the (aggregate of) perceptions (vijňána-skandha) is Aksobhya, the soul of the manifestation.The above is self-explanatory except in a few particulars which are explained in Alamkakalasa’s commentary (PTT, Vol. 61, p. 235-3). In the case of the sarfiskdra-skandha he says, “Be­sides being named the indeterminate means that its intrinsic nature is indeterminate, because it generates the realms of form, formless, and so on” (gžan yaň luň ma bstan miň žes b yabani / luň ma bstan pahi raň bžin te / gzugs daň gzugs med la sogs pa"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"bskyed pahi phyir ro ). In the case of the vijňána-skandha, he explains the ‘presences’ (bháva) and ‘absences* (abhava) this way : “A ‘presence’ has the nature of efficiency (arthakriyáká- ritva) ; an ‘absence’ is the reverse of that” (diios po ni don byed nus pahi bdag nid can no / /dňos med ni de las bzlog paho). This explanation is consistent with Tson-kha-pa’s explanation of M ádhyamika philosophy in the vipa$yana (discerning the real) portion of his Lam rim chen mo> where he defends the position at length that entities arise dependently, void of intrinsic nature but possessed of efficiency.An intriguing feature of the above Vajramálá passage is that while it explains more about the skandhas it is not directly expla­natory^of the Quhyasamájatantra\\ for example, it does not explain the passage about the skandhas in chapter 18 (the U ttara- T antra), e.g. that vijňána is called ‘hatred’. It does set forth the standard correspondence of skandhas to Tathágatas, which is a m atter of conceptual praxis in the next group of verses (‘Bhagaván-Sarva’). This and other passages of the Vajra­málá suggest that its ‘explanatory’ nature consists in giving more information consistent with the Guhyasamája. In the present case, once the skandhas are so identified, one can proceed to correlate that chapter 18 passage with the current information to associate the Tathágatas respectively with the defilements (,kleša), as follows : ‘hatred’—Aksobhya, ‘delusion*—Vairocana; ‘stirring pride’—Ratnasambhava; ‘lust’—Amitábha; and ‘ envy ’—Amoghasiddhi.(4) The skandhas in the Intermediate State are already a teaching of non-tantric Buddhism in a scripture entitled Arya- nanda-garbhávakránti-nirdeša (in the collection called RatnakU(a) : Idé la bar ma dohi phuň pohi dbyibs de yaň rnam pa gftis su gyur te/ kha dog sdug ciň mdzes pa daň / kha dog mi sdug ciň mi mdzes paho / / sems can dmyal ba rnams kyi bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog mi sdug pa yin te I hdi lta ste dper na sdoň dum tshig pa daň hdraho//dud hgrohi rnams kyi bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog ni hdi lta ste I dper na dud pa daň hdraho / / yi dag kyi bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog kyaň hdi lta ste / dper na chu daň hdraho / / lha daň mi rnams kyi bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog ni hdi lta ste / dper na gser gyi kha dog daň hdraho / / gzugs kyi bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog2 1 2 YOGA OF THE G U HYASAMAJ AT ANTRA"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDÁNA VERSES2 1 3ni dkar por hdug go / / gzugs med pahi khams kyi lha rnams ni bar ma dohi srid pahi kha dog med de / hdi ltar de ni gzugs med pahi phyir ro /Now, that form of the Intermediate-State skandha is of two kinds—of pleasant, lovely color; and of unpleasant, ugly color.

This suggests that the term ‘wjïzàrta-pentad5 means the five having vijñána as salient member. This would permit the M âdhyamika type correspondence between the five skandhas and five knowledges. Thus, Alamkakalasa’s commentary on the Vajramàlà (continued from citation under nidàna verse 9) states that when the personality aggregates (skandha) are pure, their equivalent winds correspond to the five knowledges as follows:WindSkandhaKnowledgePránavijñánadharm adhatuapànavedanàequalitysamànasamjňádiscriminativeudánasamskáraprocedure-of-dutyvyànarüpamirror-likeO f course the term ‘vijňána-yzntdLďcan also mean the fivevijňánas based on the five ‘door’ senses, that ride on the five ancillary winds, as is shown elsewhere.

In the Stage of Generation the w inds. are the breathing in and out, as in nidana verse 12 and the ‘tip of the nose* is on the face. In the Stage of Completion, the winds are made to enter the central ‘vein’, along which there are three kinds of ‘tip of nose’, detailed in my introduction.Concerning the recitation, Guhyasamaja, Chap.

When well multiplied by four (goddesses), the union with four is 900. Now that observed 900 by a series of 24 would increase here (for day and night) to 21,600.When this same passage from the Sarjidhivyakarana is quoted in Sňags rim, f. 442a-1, Tson-kha-pa gives the explanation of the Âmnàya-manjari, that when one is reciting the Pânçlarà wind, which is the (fire) wind of the Lotus-lord (Amitàbha), then there are 225 of fiery Pânçlarà of fire, 225 of windy Tara of fire, 225 of earth Locanà of fire, and 225 of watery Mâmaki of fire. And one can understand the recitation of the other three the same way. The ‘24’ comes from division of watches. ( / gos dkar la sogs žes pa ni pad ma mgon pohi rkm la mehi me gos dkar mo daň mehi rlun sgrol ma daň mehi sa spyan ma daň mehi chu Mà-ma-kïhi rluň fiis brgya fier Iňa re yod pahi dbaň du byas la des gžan gsum yaň šes par byaho / hdi la thun phyed pa fier bži žes man sfte las gsuňs so / ). Since there are eight watches by day and night, the number ‘24’ must result from multiplication with the three mantras. T hat this comes out commensurate with ť24 hours’ seems to be an accident. Divid­ing on this basis, we find that each shortest recitation takes 4 seconds. When one is reciting the wind of the Lotus-lord, he would recite first the fiery Pânçlarà of fire for four seconds of Om, four seconds of Ah, and fóur seconds of Hum. H e continues this fiery Pânçlarà of fire recitation for 225 times (45 minutes) before going to the windy Tàrà of fire, and so on to the other goddesses for a total of three hours. Then the instruc­tion states to go through the process similarly in the case of the other three elements. This remark is clarified by observing that the Saijidhivyàkarûna verses in question are quoted in the Paňcakrama (krama No. 1 ; but the edited text by La Vallée Poussin numbering them 45-46 does not notice these as con­tinuation of quotation).

During the second watch, a ray colored green issues through the left nostril from the wind-circle based by the navel; at that time one can succeed in the rite of destructive magic. Starting at noon, in the third watch, a ray colored yellow issues through both nostrils from the earth-circle based in the lotus of the sacral place; at that time one is successful in the rite of prosperity. During the fourth watch, through both nostrils issues a slow and slight ray, colored white, from the water-circle based in the heart; at that time, one is successful in the rite of appeasing (the deities). The same order takes place during the night (watches). Sri Laksmi continues with explanation that those descriptions show the dominant ray, but that the other three are represented fractionally . This agrees with the foregoing m anner of recita­tion, which obviously involves a permutation of the goddesses in the order of the four watches of the day, repeated in the four watches of the night. The total of recitations for the eight watches thus amounts to 21,600.One may observe that these subdivisions are governed by the eight-watch system of classical times. There is evidence that in the B.C. period there was a system of six watches (three by day and three by night).

In my annotation I follow the subdivisions as present­ed in Tson-kha-pa*s PaHcakrama commentary Gsal bahi sgron me (PTT, Vol. 158 pp. 204 and 205) and a few differences with the lists in that Peking edition of Aryadeva’s work may be due to the fact that Tson-kha-pa employed all translations of this work in Tibetan, as I pointed out in “Notes on the Sanskrit Term Jhdna” p. 267, note 59. Aryadeva, op. cit., p. 295-5, merely cites the Candraguhyatilaka (zla gsah thig le) as mention­ing the term ‘hundred lineages*. Tson-kha-pa’s exposition always uses the order Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Artioghasiddhi, and Aksobhya; and means this order in many other places by saying ‘Vairocana etc.* This shows the Guhya- samaja traditional correspondences to the skandhas to agree with the old Buddhist statement of the skandhas (cf. niddna verse 9, above), and this gives rise to the table in Tucci (Tibetan Painted Scrolls, I, p. 240), where the standard jurisdictional activity of the Buddha families is given ip the same order : moha (delusion), abhimana (pride), raga (lust), irsya (envy), krodha (wrath). W hile this work was being printed, the author temporarily in Japan heard that a scholar wondered about the consistency of the Guhyasamdjatantra to have Aksobhya as the chief deity and yet apparently in another place assigning this role to Vairocana. But by reference to the Aksobhya-mapdala translated above it will be noticed that the placement of Ak§obhya in the center gives Vairocana the assignment to the East. In this Tantra Aksobhya has the role of emanating, as though from above downwards, the whole mantfala. The human candidate has to work from downwards upward and he does this by the corres­pondences which start from the East, so there is no inconsis­tency.The subdivisions amounting to a hundred lineages as well as other lists in the annotation of these verses, are somewhat tedious, unless the reader can sense the interesting sidelights on Indian Civilization suggested by the way of sectioning the ‘worlds* into these partite realities grouped under the five Tatha­gatas as ‘building-blocks* of the world, which is made up of them"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NÍDÁNA VERSES 227in various permutations and combinations.

This intrinsic nature of prajha is (lepresented in the ‘Stage of Generation5 as) the imagination of the lunar disk.While the Mchan annotation and the above citation from the Pahcakrama treat the entire cycle of karma and fruit in generali­ties, the nidana verse 13 in fact emphasizes birth or rebirth. This is consistent with the observation in the Introduction III, E. ‘Grouping the nidana karikas’, that the stage of Atiyoga, the body-mandala, corresponds to birth. This nidana verse therefore corroborates the remark in Tson-kha-pa’s Don gsal ba on the Guhyasamaja (PTT, Vol. 160, p. 124.-1, 2) that the Stage of Generation corresponds to the development of the men of the first aeon : first, a condition of ‘death5 corresponding to the generation of the palace in Yoga; second, a condition of ‘inter­mediate state’ corresponding to the generation of the primeval lord in Anuyoga; third, a condition of ‘birth’ corresponding to the body-mandala as though in the generation cycle of the womb during Atiyoga. ’According to Tson-kha-pa in that place, this ‘birth’ is illustrated by the descent from the Tusita heaven of the Bodhisattva for his last life. Referring to the correspondence of five stages at the close of the preceding gioup of verses (‘Ekasmin samaye’), ‘birth’ corresponds to the fifth krama, ‘pair-united (yuganaddha), and so to the ‘pair-united with training’ (Saikfa-yuganaddha).

The correspondence of skandhas to Buddhas is standard (cf. Guiseppe Tucci. Tibetan Painted Scrolls. I, p. 238) : rupa (Vairocana), vedana (Ratnasambhava), sarjijna (Amitabha), sdmskdra (Amoghasiddhi), vijnana (Akso- bhya). The contemplation of the correspondences takes place in the Stage of Generation; the identification in fact is the achievement of the Stage of Completion.The five kinds of abhisarjibodhi mean here the five of the Stage of Generation rather than the five of the Stage of Completion (nidana verse 36). In the present case, fortunately we can use the correspondences from Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantrds, Chapter One. There the moon corresponds to Aksobhya, the second (the red moon) to Ratnasambhava, the germ syllable to Amitabha, the hand symbol to Amoghasiddhi, and the image to Vairocana. Since the five Tathagatas have already been indicated in terms of the skandhas, the five abhisambodhis of ‘moon,* and so forth, are in turn made to correspond.In their undivided correspondence to the Tathagatas, the five skandhas are said to have ‘partite reality’, in terms of their corres­pondence to the five defilements given above under ‘Smin,’ with rupa-skandha called ‘delusion’ (moha). Tsoii-kha-pa, “Rnal hbyor dag pahi rim pa” (Vol. 160, p. 91) : “Having purified ‘delusion,’... (etc.), one is transferred to the rank of Vairocana, etc.; thus the partite reality of the (respective) Tathagata (gfegs pa dbyuh ba hi de hid).” Thus the defilement (kleia) brings the yogin to a particular Buddhahood, by his purifying that very defilement going with that Buddha.The authority for the ‘hundred lineages’ subdivisions of skandhas is Guhyasamajatantra, XVII, p. 137 :I pahcaskandhah samasena pahcabuddhdh prakirtitah /The five skandhas are.proclaimed in short to be the five Buddhas.Tson-kha-pa’s Pahcakrama commentary (Vol. 158, p. 204) :“Among them, when dividing up the rupa-skandha = VdL\\xo~ cana,— (1) Shape, long and short, etc., whether inner, outer, or both; (2) aspect of oneself, other or both; (3) color, blue, etc., whether inner or outer; (4) lustre of sun, moon, etc., whether inner or outer; (5) form which lacks representation—have in th e, given order, the Vairocana, the Ratnasambhava, the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"2 3 0 YOOA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAAmitabha, the Amoghasiddhi, the Ak§obhya—of Vairocana.“W hen dividing up the vedand-skandha—Ratnasambhava (1) impartiality and indifference; (2) (feeling) arisen from bodily phlegm and wind; (3) joy and suffering; (4) (feeling) arisen from meeting (of perception, sense organ, and sense object); (5) feeling arisen from bile,—have in the given order, the Vairocana, etc., of Ratnasambhava.“W hen dividing up the sarjijna-skandha = Amitabha— (1) (ideas of) the non-moving and the unchanging; (2) (ideas of) the four-footed stage; (3) (ideas of) the footless stage;(4) (ideas of) the multip(e-footed stage; (5) (ideas of) the two-footed stage—have in the given order, the Vairocana, etc., of Amitabha.“ When dividing up the sarfiskdra-skandha = Amoghasiddhi,— (1) (motivations of) the body; (2) (motivations of) the three realms; (3) (motivations of) speech; (4) (motivations of) libe­ration; (5) (motivations of) the mind—have in the given order, the Vairocana, etc., of Amoghasiddhi.“When dividing up the vijndna-skandha — Aksobhya,—»(1-5) the perceptions based on eye, etc. down to body—have in the given order, the Vairocana, etc., of Aksobhya.”This multiplication of each Tathagata by each Tathagata yields the number 5 x 5 = 25, the number of twisted threads outlining the palace in the mandala-rite.

Meharis annotation suggests that the pardcular phase of the Stage of Generation in which such a conceptualization takes place is taught by nidana verse 19 which deals with the ‘subsequent attainm ent’. There are two matters to be discussed : (1) the conferring of enlightenment, (2) Meharis remark about ‘subtle contemplation of the lower orifice’.(1) One explanation for the statement that those goddesses confer the enlightenment of the Buddhas is that the explanatory tantra Caturdevipariprccha, in the commentary of Smiti (PTT, Vol. 66, p. 155-2), shows that the four steps of sadhana are identified with the four goddesses: 1. seva = Locana; 2.upasadhana = M amakI; 3. sadhana = Pancjara, 4. mahasa-dhana = Taraj However, the chief explanation would be in the Guhyasamdjatantra> Chap. XV, the chapter devoted to dreams and other auspices. Verses 32-34 can be understood as the auspice of the later role of the four goddesses to be treated in verse group ‘Diamond Ladies of the H eart’; those three verses are here translated in Pradipoddyotana context (Mchan hgrel, p. 123) :jhanasattvaprayogena madhye bimbarp. prabkavayet / catuhsthanefu mantrajho yo$itam sthdpayet sada // sarvdlankarasamp urnarji sarvalakfanalakfitdm / padmmji prasaritarp krtvd idarp. mantrarji vibhavayet 11"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"II HUm IIpancaraJmiprabharfi diptarji bhavayet yogarjt vajrinah / kayav&kcittavajrefu patayan bodhim apnuydt 11 By the praxis of the Knowledge Being, he should contem­plate the image (of M ahavajradhara’s Body appearing instantly) in the center (of the lotus). The mantra- knower should always place the ‘lady’ (i.e. Locana, etc.) in the four spots (corners, i.e. intermediate directions) who has the full range of ornaments and who bears all the (ladylike) characteristics. Having made the lotus (of his own heart, svahrtpadma, and of the doors, mukha*- kamala) wide-open, he should contemplate this mantra :II Huip I/ ^He should contemplate the blazing light of five rays as the yoga of the vajrin. Falling into the diamonds of his body, speech, and mind, it attains enlightenment.The actual experience so indicated belongs to the phase Stage of Completion with the praxis called ‘without prapaftca’ (nifprapanca, T. spros bral), which involves the experience of the three light stages whether in the forward or reverse direction.(2) The ‘subtle contemplation of the lower orifice5 is dis­cussed at length in Tson-kha-pa’s commentary on the Panca­krama called “Gdan rdzogs kyi dmar khrid” (PTT, Vol. 159, pp. 120 and 121). It is the ‘arcane body’ as a practice in the Stage of Completion; therefore it does not involve experience of the three Lights, which is called ‘arcane mind’ {cittaviveka) ; rather, it is a preparation for that experience of the Lights. The ‘lower orifice’ refers to the lower orifice of the central vein (the avadhdti), which Tucci (Tibetan Painted Scrolls, I, p. 241) identi­fies as the perineum. In Tson-kha-pa’s work {op. cit., p. 120-2) the ‘lower orifice’ seems to be equivalent to the ‘middle of the gem’ {nor buhi dbus) or ‘tip of the gem {nor buhi rise). In the male this is the root of the penis. The ‘subtle contemplation’ (ibid., p. 120-4) involves contemplating at that spot a small solar disk and on it a ‘drop’ (thig le, S. bindu) of substance having three features : its color is blue; its shape is round; its size is no bigger than a tiny grain such as barley and seen as the form of one’s presiding deity (<adhideva) brilliantly shining with five rays. In the basic Tantra, this contemplation is alluded to in Chapter Six, verse 15 (‘Documents’).

In the light of this terminology, when the yogin imagines there a bindu as above described, it can be described mystically as depositing the seed in the ‘woman’. Accordingly, one could expect some different terminology in the case of an actual woman. Such seems to be the implication of Tsori-kha-pa’s citation from the Vajramdld (its chapter 16) in his commentary on the VajrajMnasamuccaya (PTT, Vol. 160, p. 153-4, and p. 154-1).

It is unconscious, insentient matter, hence free from vijňdna. The Knowledge-Body of the Intermediate State, which is selfless because devoid of any ego substance that craves rebirth, so also devoid of the coarse body (the vipdka-k&ya) that undergoes states, is the best of life bom there, and rides on the prdna-vnnd which is the best of animated beings.

In the Guhyasamajatantra (Chapter O ne), the ‘Triumphant mandala5 is the thirteen-deity mandala (Tson-kha-pa, Don gsal ba> p, 144-1), because it is the revelation of the Buddha to the retinue of Tathagatas. Similarly in this phase the master reveals the mandala to the disciple, who is then initiated in it. In fact, the Tathagata verses fall into two of Tatha for the ‘Trium phant m andala5 and two of Gata for the ‘Victory of the Rite’. There are two interpretations of Tatha (the same way): (a) displaying (the same way) for the sake of sentient beings (niddna verse 18); (b) ‘afterwards ... should dwell5 (the same way) (verse 19). There are also two interpretations of Gata (gone) : (a) gone (as a divinity) to sense objects (for super­normal faculties) (verse 20); (b) gone, rendered up to, the Tathagatas (verse 21).There are five Tathagata families (Guhyasamdja, Chapter I*p. 6) :dve$amohau tatha rdgai cintamanisamayas tatha / kuld hy ete tu vai pahcakdmamok^aprasddakdh. 11 H atred and delusion; likewise lust, wish-granting gem, and symbol-pledge are the families.

The method of generating is through the ionv yogas called (a) yoga, (b) anu­yoga, (c). atiyoga, (d) mahayoga, which goes up through the generation of the three sattvas. ‘Seen to have^ three heads’ means seen by all the candidates in the world.In the second case, there is Guhyasamdjatantra9 X, p. 40; Mchan hgrel, Vol. 158, p. 73-4, 5 :svamantrapurufarfi dhyatva catu hs thane su rupatah / trimukhdkdrayogena trivarnena vibhdvayet //Having meditated upon oneself as the incantation-person, one should contemplate in the manner of form (bodily color, hand symbol, etc. of Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi) in four places (the cardinal directions) by way of three-faced aspect (the three, lust, etc.; the three lights; and so on) and by means of the three syllables (Om, A h , Hum).The second passage makes it clear that the three heads can be understood as the white light, red light, and dark light respecti­vely of Light, ' Spread-of-Light, and Culmination-of- Light.Concerning the ‘sattvas’ of the first passage, which Mchan hgrel expands as the ‘three sattvas*, there is this passage in Naga- rjuna’s Pindikrtasddhana (Ratnakara^anti’s commentary, PTT Vol. 62, pp. 80 and 81):Om sarvatathagatakayavakcittavajrasvabhavatmako ’ ham 91. adhi§fhayaivam atmanaip sasimandalamadhyagamsadbhiS cihnaih samayuktam cintet samayasattvakam 92« hrnmadhyasamsthitarp suksmaip jfianasattvam vibhavayet samadhisattvasamjfiam ca huipkaram taddhrdi nyaset"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"2 5 0 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA93. nispadyaivam mahayogam trisattvatmakam atmavan anena vidhiyogena mahasadhanam arabhet “Om, I am the nature of the Body, Speech, and M ind diamonds of all the Tathagatas.”Having in that way empowered himself, he should contem­plate a Symbolic Being (samayasattva) endowed with six. signs (vajra> etc., as listed in the Ak$obhya-man$ala) and loca­ted in the middle of a moon-disk.

Bhattacharyya’s edi­tion, pp. 27-8: ruparp vijftáya trividham půjayet pujanátmakah, etc. The three kinds are now to be stated as ‘inferior’, ‘intermedi­ate* and ‘superior’.The Mchan hgrel on Pradipoddyotana, Chapter V II (Vol. 158, p. 56-1) mentions that rUpa is of three kinds— pleasurable, repulsive or displeasing, and neutral.

STAGE OF COMPLETIONE. Kdyavakcitta (Body, Speech, and Mind)In the introductory discussion of the four Tantras, it was pointed out that the Anuttarayoga-tantra is preeminently inner samadhi. This description is justified by the Stage of Completion, which begins with nidana verse 22.

Regarding his secret body, speech, and mind : ... he should not engage in the rite of caitya (e.g. circumambulation), including (pre­paration of) the site and (removal of) gravel, etc., because it is not right (Mchan : ‘for a person on the Stage of Completion who himself is all Tathagatas’) to have craving for caitya-wor­ship; he should not recite books, because it is not right for one who has aroused the spontaneous diamond recitation to lend his voice to a different (recitation); he should not make an external mandala, because when the mandala is one’s own body, it is not a case of the (stationary) earth-mandala ; he should not worship the best of diamonds, namely, the havakas, pratyeka- buddhas (concretely or their images), or the (image of) Samyak- sambuddha, because it violates himself being all Tathagatas (in the steady state of comprehending b liss-v o id );....”In this phase there is also the practice called ‘vidya-vrata’ (defined in Appendix III).The authoritative passage is in the Guhyasamajatantra} Chapter X V I : (Mchan hgrel, p. 147-2, 3):kayavdkcittavajrdndrji kayavakcittabhdvanam / svarupenaiva tatkdryam evam siddhir avapyate // 89 // tatredarji svakayavakcittavidydvratam /"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"260 YOG A OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAja(amuku(adhararji bimbam sitavarnanibharji mahat / karayet vidhivat sarvarji mantrasarjivarasamvrtam // 90 // kandamulaphalaih sarvarji bhojyarji bhak$yarji samacaret / 94A// The task is the contemplation of a body, speech, and mind belonging to (i.e. issuing from) the Body-, Speech-, and M ind-diamonds and precisely like one’s own appearance. Just so is the siddhi (of M aha-m udra) attained. Herein is the ‘vidyavrata’ of one’s own body, speech, and mind. The Great One, white in color, his (divine) form (of Vairocana) bearing a crown of matted locks, practises everything in ritual m anner, restrained by the mantra-vow.By means of bulbs and fruits, he subsists on all food and drink.In Tson-kha-pa’s commentary on the Pahcakrama (PTT, Vol. 159, p. 74-3, 4, 5), there is a lengthy discussion of what is meant by the phrase ‘precisely like one’s own appearance’. This is frequently alluded to in Buddhist T antra sadhanas by the term ‘svdbha’ (‘like oneself’). The solution appears to be that the consort is one of the goddesses Locana, etc. having the same dress as oneself as the yogin of one or another Buddha. The consort is described in that Chapter X V I, verse 91, as the ‘sixteen-yeared girl’. The meaning apparently is that the yogin is accompanied by a goddess-consort who has issued from his own body, speech, and mind which have been identified with the Body, Speech, and Mind of the Tathagatas. Tson- kha-pa explains the phase as ‘without prapanca (nifprapanca).Turning to the separate treatment of ‘kaya’, ‘vak’, and ‘citta’, according to previous indications the ‘arcane body’ as pratyahara and dhyana among the six members of yoga, is treated under the ‘K aya’ verses (see Sri Laksmi’s comment under ‘YA’). In that same Pancakrama commentary (the “ Gsal bahi sgron m e” ), PTT, Vol. 158, p. 205-4, Tson-kha- pa continues his discussion of the ‘hundred lineages’ of ‘arcane body’ to show how to condense them into ‘elements’. Among them, the 20 lineages belonging to the Vairocana-kula, that is, from the lineage of rupa-skandha up to the lineage of the ‘tangible diamond goddess’, are condensed into the element of earth. Similarly the 20 parts of Ratnasam bhava lineage are condensed into the element of water; the 20 of Am itabha lineage, into"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY ÑÍDÁNA VERSES261lire; the 20 of Amoghasiddhi, into wind; and the 20 of Aksobhya lineage into the element of vijnatia. Tson-kha-pa mentions that the classification into five groups is further reduced into three ‘secret* families by the method of including Ratnasam- bhava in the kaya-vajra family of Vairocana; Amoghasiddhi in the vag-vajra family of Amitabha; and the ‘sixth Tathagata’ Vajradhara in the citta-vajra family of Ak?obhya. The three families considered as three vajras when taken as indivisible, yield the sixth adhideva Vajradhara, which is the ultimate of kdyaviveka (‘arcane body’).The ‘arcane speech* as prdndyama, third of the six members, is included in ‘VAK’. Nagarjuna starts his five stages here, with ‘diamond muttering’ (vajrajapa). The praxis which begins with VAK is stated succinctly by Tson-kha-pa in his commentary on the Vajrajnanasamuccaya, Vol. *160, p. 159-3: “The generality in that regard is that the means of generating the three knowledges (jndna) has the inner (subjective) condi­tion of contemplating prdndyama and the outer (objective) condition of resort to a mudrd (‘seal’, partner).” H^e explains the first as the three kinds of prdndydma based on three differently located bindus (see under VAK), and the second as the genera­tion of the four ‘joys’ (see under VA, verse 30). Therefore, the goddess companion previously mentioned in connection with ‘vidyavrata* has the function of helping the yogin generate the four ‘joys’.The ‘arcane mind’ as dharandy the fourth member, is included in CIT-TA. Nagarjuna’s system is more explicit, because it allows a whole krama, the ‘purification of consciousness’ (cittaviiuddhi), for CIT—the three light stages; and another whole krama, the ‘personal blessing* (.svadhiffhdna), for TA— entrance of the illusory body into the Clear Light.II KA /I kdyatrayaiji samuddi$\\cap, prthagbhavena tdyina / ekakdraiji putiar yali nifpannakramayogatah // 22 //The Protector (i.e. the Buddha) well taught the three Bodies as being different.

Accordingly, in the time of the path, there is the secret of samvrti-mdya—accomp­lishing the illusory body from wind-and-mind-only belonging to the Symbolic Clear Light (dpehi hod gsal).Mchan : In the case of the first krama (the Stage of Generation),,there is only a mental orientation to conviction, but the path is lacking because there is no yoga of the three bodies. (In the case of the second krama,) by yoga unifying the three bodies it is not a matter of figments of imagination. (These . remarks apply respectively to the two foregoing passages of Mchan annotation).This nidana verse (‘KA’) and the next one (‘YA’) continue and conclude the ‘arcane body’ (kayaviveka) of the foregoing Stage of Generation. According to the Pradipoddyotana on X II, 60-64, and its Mchan hgrcl (‘Documents’), the kind of ‘arcane body’ is called ‘purification afterwards obtained’. This, then, is the reflex in the Stage of Completion of the pre­ceding praxis. H ence, the commentators are allowed the latitude of using the verse ‘KA’ and ‘YA’ to compare the two stages in the matter of the innate body, which is the basis of the present praxis rather than the coarse body seen by the eye of flesh. ‘KA’ can be understood as pratyahara (‘W ithdrawal’), the first member. To show the continuity of the Stage of Generation into the Stage of Completion, Pahcakrama, 2nd krama, 48-50; Sri LaksmI, Vol. 63, p. 27-5, ff., has the following:. citlam evam svayam pasyet svam eva saiibimbavat / atha candram samdlambya vajracihnarfi prakalpayet lj upayasucakarji hy etad vajradyutpattiyoginam / candravajradisarjiyogdc cittacaitasasaijigamah // prajhopdyasamayogdj jay ate devatakrtih / caturmudrabhir amudrya devatagarvam udvahan //He should so regard his own mind as itself like a moon-reflection; then, he should imagine the vajra-sign taking its support on the moon.The (five)-pronged upaya belongs to theyogins of ( the Stage of) Generation of the vajra, etc. From the Generation union."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDÁNA VERSES2 6 3of the vajra, etc. and the moon there (results) the Comple­tion combination of citta (=prajňá) and caitasa (= upáya).

Hence the above verses show the continuation of the Mahá- sádhana phase of the Stage of Generation into the outset of the Stage of Completion.It is this union of prajňá and upáya that unifies the three Bodies, according to Guhyasamájatantra, IX, p. 36; Pradipodd- votana and Mchati hgrel, PTT.

One should ponder whether this is the explanation: The basic Light which shines when severing the distance between the thing per­ceived and the perceiver is ‘dependent5. Having in that way taken recourse to Light, the subsequent difference between, and affirmation of thmg perceived and perceiver,"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDÁNA VERSES275is ‘imaginary’. The casting away of the two lights— ‘imaginary’ and the other light—has incessant ‘perfect’ immediacy. Therefore, according to the particular secret state: — Light is the initial basis of the voids; on that basis Spread-of-Light arises; and at the time of Gulmination-of-Light, having averted the former two—i.e. having averted both ‘means’ and ‘insight’, one takes recourse to the common dharma of uniting ‘means’ and ‘insight’.The three lights constitute the fourth of the five signs pre­sented in the Guhyasamdja, Chapter X V III and included in Candrakirti’s comments (‘Documents’, PART ONE). The first sign, a mirage, manifests through dissolution of earth into water. The second, smoke, through dissolution of water into fire. The third, fire-flies, through dissolution of fire into wind. The fourth, a changeable lamp, through dissolution of wind into the three lights. Through sequential dissolution of the three lights, there is the fifth sign, the Clear Light like a cloudless sky.Vitapada, in his commentary Sukusuma-ndma-dvikrama-tattva- bhavana-mukhagama-vrtti (PTT, Vol. 65, p. 58-4, 5) explains the signs in accordance with the preceding pranayama involving the bindu:Now, what happens at first when that yogin turns back his discursive thought (vikalpa) ? He should know that at first there is the sign which is a manifestation like a mirage. One should understand that phase this way: the rays from that bindu have a pattern both bright and not bright, appearing like a mirage. This is an illusory appearance allowed in one’s stream of consciousness that should be warded off, because one is attached to it if he has the pride of thinking that he knows the sign. The same applies to the others. It is like smoke when brighter than the mirage, while lacking colors such as green, white, and so on. The ‘fireflies’ or lights in space, are brighter than the smoke and of different type. The sign ‘shining like a lamp’ is superior to the fireflies and of different type. Those are seen in the manner of rays, with each one brighter than the preceding one.

Moreover, what is the mani­festation ? “Bright like a cloudless sky55 means a cloud­less sky that manifests with special brilliance.The above shows the difference between the ‘Arya’ and the ‘Buddhajňánapáda’ schools of the Guhyasamaja. The ‘Arya’ tradition understands the mystic signs to be related to sequential dissolution of the elements, and takes the fourth sign ‘shining like a lamp, to stand for three light stages. The other tradition explains the signs as resulting from contemplation of the bindu, does not relate them to the elements, and does not subdivide the sign ‘shining like a lam p5.A remarkable ability to describe the praxis is found in Arya- deva’s Caryamelápaka-pradipa (quoted in Tson-kha-pa’s Snags rim chen mo, f. 456b-4), where we read a most lucid statement of the sequence:I spyod bsdus las / /de nas skye ba gcig nas gcig tu goms pas bdag med pahi chos la bslabs pas rnam par dag pahi sbyor ba khoň du chud nas raň b^iin gyi snaň ba daň gcig tu hdre bar bya ste rim pa hdis don dam pahi bden pa la dmigs par byaho / dehi rim pa hdi yin te phuň po la sogs pa ni khams phrá ba la gžug go / khams phra ba ni yaň sems la gžug go / sems ni yaň sems pa la gžug go / sems pa ni yaň ma rig pa la gzug ste de ltar spyad nas gilid log par byed do / de la dus hdir ni sems daň sems pa ma rig pa la rab tu žugs pahi skad cig la draň pa brjod paho I phyis ni brjod pa yaň med pahi ye ses kyi ňo bo ňid ni hod gsal baho / yaň grol ba na rluň gi raň bžin rňed de gaň gi tshe rmi lam gžan dag hbyuň ba na ji srid du rnam par ses pa mi gYo ba de srid du gnid log nas hod gsal ba la blta ste / de ni so sor raň g is rig pa lus daň ňag daň bral bahi don dam pahi bden pa naň gi mňon par byaň chub pa žes byaho / žes gsuňs te...Then, by meditative repetition from one life to the next, and by training in the self-less natures, he comes to fully understand the right praxis: how to mix together with the Light of intrinsic nature; how to visualize the Supreme T ruth (paramártha-satya) by this sequence.

Now, in this life, he expresses the truth at the instant when citta and caitta are absorbed in avidya. At the next instant there is the Clear Light with the intrinsic nature of the inexpressible gnosis. Even when it is released, he has attained the intrinsic nature of wind; and at whatever time other dreams occur, then as long as his perception (vijndna) is immobile (acala) i.e. one- pointed, in samddhiy the deep sleep (sufupti) (is also pre­sent) and he sees the Clear Light. That introspection is called ‘inner revelation of the Supreme T ruth that is free from Body and Speech’.The meaning of this remarkable passage is exposed in Tsori- kha-pa’s commentary on the ‘Six Laws of Naro-pa’ (PTT, Vol. 161, pp. 7-8 and p. 12). Here we learn a distinction between the Clear Light of the waking state (jagrat-prabhasvara) and the Clear Light of deep sleep (sujupti-prabhcisvara). The waking state Clear Light is also distinguished as subjective (vifayin), the Jnana-Dharmakaya, and the objective (vi$aya), the un­constructed (asamskrta) Dharmakaya. The subjective type I understand by former terminology as ‘Clear Light of True M ind’ or Symbolic Clear Light (of three gnoses or Jfiana lights, namely, Light, Spread of Light, and Culmination of Light, referred to by Aryadeva as, respectively, citta, caitta, and avidya). The objective type is the Clear Light of the Absolute Entity. The Clear Light of deep sleep is similarly distinguished into the subjective deep sleep which is heavy (hthugpo) or light (srab mo), ‘lost’ (dams) (to memory) or ‘comprehended’ (rtogs pa), and the objective ‘ground’ (gki) Clear Light of death. In the waking state category is the ‘son Clear Light’ contemplated with praxis of ‘bliss-void’ (stikha-S utiya) (bde ston sbyoryin bsgoms pahi buhi hod gsal) which is the Clear Light of the path. In the deep sleep category is the ‘mother Clear Light’ which is the ‘ground’ Clear Light of death (gkilii hchi bahi hod gsal ni mahi hod gsal). As I understand this yoga praxis, the intention is to make the ‘son’ Clear Light break through to subjective waking state, and to make the' ‘mother’ Clear Light break through to sub­jective deep sleep (susupti) as a samadhi.

A fuller treatment is found in Tson-kha-pa’s Mlhah gcod on chapter seven (PTT, Vol. 156, p. 45)and in his Don gsal ba on the Guhyasamaja (PTT Vol. 160, pp. 146 and 147). This exposition by Tson-kha-pa, of the dharana-anga is based on the Samdhivyakarana and Pradi- poddyotana on Chapter V II, the Vajramala and its commentary by Alamkakalasa, and Aryadeva’s Caryameldpaka-pradipa. Pre­viously, under nidana verse 4, a passage was quoted from N agarjuna’s Pindikrta-sadhana (43-44A), which in fact stems from the Vajramala. The theory is to draw the 5 x 5 = 25 entities into the Clear Light as the paramartha-mandala. There are five each of skandhas, dhatus, indriyas, vifayasr and jhdnas. The first group to dissolve is of course the one with earth element (<dhatu) since this gives rise to the first sign, a mirage. W ith dissolution of the earth element, the entire body is desiccated (i.e. thirsts for water).

In the case of the first group, Vairocana’s family; second group, Ratnasambhava’s family; third group, Am itabha’s family; fourth group, Amogha- siddhi’s family.Finally, there is the dissolution indicated by that passage of the Piniikrta-sadhana, i.e. of the upper and lower Fury Kings, of the twice-eighty prakrtis, and of Aksobhya’s family; where­upon ‘perception’ (vijndna) passes “ to the Clear Light, also called ‘universal void with nirvana? and ‘Dharmakaya’.”UTAH tatdicaryarp, prakurvita prakrtyabhasabhedavit / karmakdyarp ‘parityajya vajradehatvam apnuyat //26//Then, knowing the differences of the prakrtis and the Lights, one should engage in the carya, (namely), abandon­ing the body of works (karmakaya), he would obtain the diamond body (vajradeha).Mchan: Knowing the differences of the eighty prakrtis and thethree Lights ( = three gnoses), the time has come for one to engage in the carya (‘praxis’) part of the Stages of Completion. He takes recourse to contemplation of the profound means of piercing the centers in the body. Then he takes recourse to experiencing the generation of the voids by the dissolution sequence of the winds. Thus he has certainty in the methods of arousing the three Lights and the (eighty) vikalpa-s. How­ever, the verse takes for granted that one has achieved the Lights o f ‘arcane m ind’ (cittaviveka), then alludes to the subse­quent (1) caryd for the aim of accomplishing the Illusory Body (mdyd-deha), as well as to the (2) caryd for the aim of §aik$a- yuganaddha after attaining the characteristics of the Illusory Body; but the verse does not allude to the (3) third caryd for the pur­pose of aiaikfa-yuganaddha after attaining the iaik$a-yuganaddha.(1) Thus the sddhaka engaged in the caryd, abandoning the ‘m aturation’ (vipdka) body propelled by former deeds {karma), obtains the illusorv body called ‘diamond body’. . (2) Having obtained that, he attains the ¿aikfa-yuganaddha, wherein the ‘diamond body’ is uninterruptedly affiliated (rigs hdra rgyun mi hchad par rdo rje sku). This illusory body is a topic of the third krama of the PaHcakrama called Svadhiffhdna-krama.The Pradipoddyotana on Chapter VI {Mchan hgrel, p. 53) quotes the Vajrahrdaydlarpkdra-tantra :"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"evaiji samadhiyuktena nirvikalpena mantrinah / kalavadhim parityajya prapyate 5nuttaram padam //W hen one thus abandons the limitation of time by non­discursiveness joined to the samadhi of a mantrin, he attains the incomparable rank.Here the expression ‘limitation of time5 (kdlavadhi) seems to refer to the ‘maturation body5.About that ‘non-discursiveness5, there is the important verse 3 in Chapter II of the Guhyasamajatantra:abhave bhavanabhavo bhavana naiva bhavana / iti bhavo na bhavah syad bhavana nopalabhyate //W hen there is an absence, there is no contemplation (because there is nothing to contemplate).

The con­templation (of the impure illusory body = samvrti-satya) is not a contemplation (of the Clear Light).

Thus, the separation of the ‘intrinsic body’ from the ‘body of m aturation’ has the aspects of wind and mind, aimed at separating the subtle from the coarse, to yield the body formed of ‘wind and mind only’.Pancakrama, Svadhisthana-krama, III, 19 :tad eva vdyusamyuktani vijhanatritayarji punah / jayate yogina murtir mdyadehas tad ucyate //Precisely that vijfiana-triad joined to the winds then arises as a body by a yogin.

Tson-kha-pa denies this theory and states that both dhyànas are portrayed in the above verses, and that the following verses45-47 simply expand on the same topic.In preparation for this caryâ, according to the indication of Mkhas grub rje’s Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras, the candidate is conferred the ‘Prajfia-jflâna Initiation*. This is the initiation concerned with the cakras or bhagas. These bhagas become the centers of associating four voids (the four lights) with four ecsta­sies. Abhayàkaraguptapàda’s UpadeSamanjari-nâma (PTT, Vol. 87, p. 82) associates the lights with ecstasies as follows : Light (âloka) with ecstasy (ânanda)\\ Spread-of-Light (àlokâbhâsa) w^h high ecstasy {paramânanda) ; Culmination-of-Light (âloko- palabdhi) with extraordinary ecstasy (viramânanda) ; Clear Light (prabhâsvara) with consubstantial ecstasy (,sahajànanda).

In the direct order ananda starts at the M ahasukha-cakra of the head, down to the Sambhoga-cakra of the throat, where starts paramananda; that down to the Dharma-cakra of the heart, where starts virama- nanda; that down to the Nirmana-cakra of the navel, where starts sahajananda (continuing down to the ‘tip of the thunderbolt gem5, already identified as the root of the penis, according to the Prajna-jfiana initiation as portrayed in Mkhas grub rje’s- work).

It is the ability to come forth from the Clear Light (equivalent to going through the portals of death) as a yogin in command of the situation.W hen the Illusory Body has been purified in the Clear Light and emerges to pass in reverse order through the three lights, it is treated by the simile of a fish, in Pancakrama, 4th krama (Abhisambodhi), verse 31:yatha nadijaldt svacchan mina utpatito drutam / sarvafunydt tatha svacchan mayajdlam udiryate //Like a fish quickly springing up from a clear stream, so the net of illusion emerges from the clear universal void.

This is because here the yogin experiences the reverse order of the very same combi­nation of voids with ecstasies.The activities and symbolism are centered about the heart. Three nidána verses are devoted to this : HR, the place of aim and creativity; DA, the yield or accomplishment; YA, the after­realization. Both the diamond {vajra) and the lady (jofit) symbolism are associated with the heart in Indrabhuti’s Jňána- siddhi: hrdayam jfianam tad eva vajrayosit (‘the Diamond Lady is just that heart gnosis’). The diamond (or thundebolt) has two aspects according to Guhyasamája, Chap. X V III, 39 (with considerable emendation suggested by N agarjuna’s commentary, PTT, Vol. 60, p. 7-5, which mentions the two syllables ‘V a’ and ‘J ra ’), that is, a destructive aspect of VA and a holding or positive aspect of JRA,paňcahetiš ca vetiti vajram ity abhidhiyate / jrakáro dhrgiti khyáto vijnanam vajradhriimanah //‘V ajra’ is defined as ‘V a’, namely the five prongs, and as ‘Jra ’, explained as holding. ‘Vijňána’ is the mind which holds the vajra.The lady also has two aspects, YO, the automatic union taking place through ‘recollection’; and SID, the otherworldliness of the act.The first or destructive meaning of vajra is that found in Alamkakalaša’s commentary on the Šri-Vajramdla (PTT, Vol. 61, p. 182-4), while expounding the ‘unshared sense’ of the T antra: “ So as to explain the word (vajra\\ it is said ‘The vajra and also the vikalpas,’ because it destroys the set of natures, (prakrti) amounting to one-hundred-sixty (= twice 80 vikalpas) ” (rdo rjehi sgra bšad pahi phyir / / rdo rje de yah rnam rtog rnams žes gsuňs te / raň bžin gyi tshogs brgya drug cu po rnams bcom pa ftid Řyi phyir ro). Tson-kha-pa’s Rdor bzlas (Lhasa Collected Works, Cha, f. 24b-4, 5, 6)starts with the first meaning and then passes to the second or positive meaning of vajra : “W hen the ‘wind-mind’ dissolves there untying the knot of the heart na<fi, it is the sublime place with cessation of the 160 ( = twice 80) vikalpas. Because it is not perturbed by discursive thought (vikalpa), it is explained as field of the (Buddha) Aksobhya (the im perturbable)’; therefore, one may also under­stand it as the narrow space laid in the heart of Aksobhya.

The positive meaning of vajra is involved in the frequent discussions of the Jňánapáda school about the ‘invio­lable drop’ (*akfata-bindu; T. mi tigs pahi thig le) of the heart, for example, in V itapada’s commentary on the Muktitilaka (PTT, Vol. 65, p. 135-2), where the form of the ‘inviolable drop’ in the heart is said to be, for example, like a grain of mustard seed; and to be the non-prapaňca of any dharma (chos thams cad kyi ma spros pa). Vitapáda also mentions in the same place a theory about the three kinds of bindu that they are identi­fied with the three kinds of masters (qcdrya), the ‘causal master’ {* hetu-acdrya), the ‘conditional mastér’ (*pratyaya-dcarya), and ‘co-natal master’ (*sahaja-átárya); and that the ‘inviolable drop’ is the ‘co-natal master5. (V itapada’s passage is given in full and explained in A. Wayman, The Buddhist Tantras, pp. 49-50).The ‘recollection’ (anusmrti) takes place through the goddess {yosit) or ‘perfection of insight’ (prajňá-páramitá). The Guhya- samdjatantra, Chapter V II, treats this ‘recollection’ with various examples. Perhaps the most important illustration involves verse 34 (translated in Pradipoddyotana and Mchan hgrel context): tatra kathaiji prajňápdramitásamayánusmrtibhávaná / prakrtiprabhásvaráh sarue anutpannd nirášravdh / na bodhir nabhisamayo na dhátuh na ca sambhavah 11 And w hat is the contemplation with recollection of the Perfection-of-Insight pledge ?All those with (entrance into, praveša) the Clear Light and its (accompanying) prakrtis (numbering 160 by day and night), are unborn (because the body taken is illusory)"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY N1DANA VERSES207and without flux (because not mere appearance, nirdbha- satvat) when there is no (i.e. no attention to) enlighten­ment, no understanding, no realm (i.e. receptacle, adhara), and no emergence (of phenomenal abodes).The Pradipoddyotana at this point cites the Vajrosni$atantra (trans­lated here with help of Mchan hgrel, p. 60-2):I mrtyuna *tv avikalpena prajndpdramita naya /I prajndpdramita jatih prajndpdramita smrtih //I prajnapdramiid bodhih prajndpdramita laya /I prajndpdramita muktih sarvdtaparipuraka 11 The Perfection of Insight has the method (= the means, upaya) by reason of non-discursive death ( = the Clear Light of Death).

Vol. 60, p. 15-4, 5 and p. 16-1,2), this involves a fiercer practice with success in fewer days. Explaining the ‘six months’ (panmdsa) of verse 161, he says (p. 16-1-5) “ If it is not achieved in six months, two months, one, or a half month, then one should try to achieve it in seven days” (gaň gi tshe zla ba drug daň zla ba gftis daň gcig daň zla ba phyed kyis hgrub par mi hgyur ni / dehi tshe žag bdun gyis bsgrub pa brtsam par bya ste / ). The comments show that if success is not reached through the usual procedure of the three sattvas (samaya-sattva9 jndna-sattua, and samddhi-sattva) in ‘six months’, then one applies the procedure through the jňána-sattva with evocation of the krodha deity Sum- bharája for success in ‘seven days*. The explanation of hatha- yoga in Naropa’s Sekoddešaflká, p. 45 involves drawing the prdna into the ‘middle vein’ (ha f hena prdnam madhyamdydip vdhayitvd).The general procedure of obtaining siddhis is through the ‘burnt offering’, as in the Guhyasamájatantra, XVI, p.T 17 (Mchan hgrel, p. 139-2):homarp kurvita mantrajňdh sarvasiddhiphalarthinah / vinmutramdrpsatailddyair dhutirp pratipddayet //The knower of mantras desiring as fruit all (mundane and supramundane) siddhis, should perform a burnt offering (homa).

So it is like the lotus {padma) which is not adhered to by the muddy water but is still surrounded by the muddy water (here the 80 vikalpas).

In the case of the six members, the explanations go as follows :1. Insight is the sense organs and means is the sense objects. The yoga of their equipoise and enjoyment, is pratyahdra.2. Insight is the sense organs and means is the Tatha- gatas. The yoga as their equipoise, is dhydna.3. Insight is paramartha-bodhicitta and means is sarjivrti- bodhicitta. The yoga as their equipoise, involving the emanation and reunification of them in upper and lower sequence, is prana-dydma.4. When insight and means axe as previous, the yoga of their equipoise, holding the bindu the size of a mustard grain in (or at) the three ‘tips of nose’, is dhdrand.5. When insight and means are the Tathagatas embraced by the goddesses, the yoga of emanating into the sky, as their equipoise, is anusmrti.6.

(The verse) disputes this. ‘Prohibited’ :— this is the label which the other vehicle applies to desire for the ‘strands of desire’, h a v in g done even the prohibited’ with the skilful means (upayakaufalya) of this (our) vehicle, ‘he renounces’ the dis­cursive thinking (vikalpa) o f ‘both the proper and the improper act.’ He ‘is not adhered to’ in his stream of consciousness by the trouble of committed desires, etc., which lead to an evil destiny (durgati), because he is ‘one knowing the intrinsic nature’ of the dharmas. According to the texts of ‘Hphags pa yab sras’ (i.e. the tantrics Nagarjuna and Aryadeva) there is also such a viewpoint in the lower vehicle (Hinayana), hence in both (vehicles) it reduces to the greatest absurdity that there is (unethical) permissiveness to take recourse to the ‘strands of desire’ (form, sound, etc.) of the vidya. But, while the com­prehension of reality is the main thing, it is necessary to fulfill the frequently-mentioned characteristic of both firmness in xyoga of the deity’ (devata-yoga) and non-regression (avaivartika) of the Bodhisattva (on the 8th to 10th stages, or Stage of Com­pletion). Because, while the lack of fault refutes the ‘per­missiveness’, there is a difference in the respective candidates of the two (vehicles).The scriptural citation “Desires are like poisonous leaves” is presumably taken by Tson-kha-pa from Bu-ston’s BSad sbyar on §id (Ta, f. 57b-4) : “Mdo las / hdod pa rnams ni dug gi lo ma lta buho ¿es hdod yon la sogs spyod bkag paho / ie na /” .

Besides, the translation has been influenced by the expression Hdria* applied to the yogin. In order that he be ‘of this kind’ there should be a relevant statement in each of the three cases, i.e. for the ‘mother’ “by the non-dual yoga of thusness” ; for the ‘sister’ “ equipped with the_?0£tf of his own presiding divinity” ; and for the ‘daughter’ “ by (his) incantation body” . This consideration justifies taking the Sanskrit expression mantramurtya (‘by his incantation body’) with the suggestion of tu . . . tu, to apply to the ‘daughter’ of the next verse. Otherwise, the yogin would be of two ‘such kinds’ for the ‘sister’ and of no ‘such kind’ for the ‘daughter’. This also suggests the solution that the consort of the yogin in the M ahasadhana phase of the Stage of Generation is the ‘daughter’; while his consorts during the Stage of Completion are the ‘sister’ and the ‘mother’. (M uch information about this daughter, etc. symbolism is in my article “ Female Energy...” reprinted with corrections in The Buddhist Tantras).But also, the Guhyosamdjatantra, Chap. V, after those verses 7-8, portrayed the astonishment of the Bodhisattvas. So the Lord pronounced verse 9 :iyarp sa dharmata iuddha buddhanarp sdrajhanindm / saradharmdrthasambhGtd e$a bodhicaripadam 11 This is the pure true nature of the Buddhas who know the essential (the Nirvana of no fixed abode). That, having arisen from the nature of the essential (supreme truth) and the entity (conventional truth), is the plane of enlightenment-coursing (M ahavajradhara). Thereupon, according to Chapter V, the Bodhisattvas fainted. The Pradipoddyotana (Mchan hgrel, p. 44-4, 5 to p. 45-1) quotes again the Sarpdhivydkarana on this chapter: punar dryavyakhyanam ucyate /aspan(d)akam idarp guhyarp santaikam sukham uilamam / sandhyaya kathitam cedarp samyaksambodhiprdpakah //... dkqldnantatdyogad rUpadinam anantatd /"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"te vai tathagatah prokta bodhisattvas tathaiva ca //... tat tu samgraham ivedam mandalatn yat svakayatah / kalpayantiha satkayah bodhisattva hi murchitah 11 na jananti tadityante sukhenonmadacoditah / bodhisattvan mahasattvan uktan te murchitan //Further, the ‘Arya-Vyakhyana’ is cited (for the ‘evident meaning’): Motionless is this secret (place), peaceful, unique, the supreme ecstasy. And this attainer of perfect enlightenment is stated in the manner of twilight. By the yoga (the two dhyanas) of space (= sunya) and infinity ( = mahasunya), there is infinity of form, etc. (the skandhas, the elements, the sense bases). Those are indeed the Tathagatas as well as the Bodhisattvas. Now, that is this comprisal, which is the mantfala as the (yogin’s) body. The Bodhisattvas imagine it in this world as their transitory bodies, so they swoon. Since they do not know that (truth, the intrinsic nature), when exhorted by ecstasy’s frenzy, the Bodhisattva Great Beings are said to ‘swoon’.Some other explanations of the seemingly immoral injunctions are made without resort to such interpretations, as above, of knowing the intrinsic nature. For example, the Guhyasamdjatantra. Chap. X V I, p. 120,v has a verse which stipulates conduct precisely the reverse of the Buddhist layman’s vows:praninai ca tvaya ghatya vaktavyam ca mi$a vacah / adattam ca tvaya grahyarp. sevanam yo$itam api //You should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things not given, and resort to the ladies.The Pradipoddyotana (Mchan hgrel edition) does not comment on this verse, presumably because the subject already was treat­ed in Chapter IX ’s comjnentary. So, Guhyasamaja, IX, p. 35: “ He should kill all sentient beings with this secret thunderbolt : (anena guhyavajrena sarvasattvam vighatayet); Pradipoddyo­tana, PTT, Vol. 158, p. 66-5 : “He should destroy all sentient beings by rendering them into the Void (tunya')’’ (sems can thams cad bsad cin ston par byas pas rnam par giig par byaho).

X V II, p. 139, has the passage :I atha te sarve mahabodhisattvah tan sarvatathagatan evam ahuh / sarvatathagatakayavakcittasiddhini bhaga- vantah kutra sthitani kva va sam bhutani / sarvatathaga- tah prahuh / trikayaguhyam sarvatathagatakayavak- cittaip vajracaryasya kayavakcittavajre sthitam / maha- bodhisattva ahuh / kaya^akcittaguhyavajram kutra sthi­tam I sarvatathagatah) prahuh / akase sthitam / m aha­bodhisattvah prahuh / akasam kutra sthitam / sarvata­thagatah prahuh / na kvacit / atha te mahabodhisattva3 1 2 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDANA VERSES313as'caryaprapta adbhutapraptah tusnim sthita abhuvan / Then all those great Bodhisattvas spoke as follows to all the Tathagatas : “ Lords, where dwell the occult powers (siddhi) of the Body, Speech, and Mind of all the Tatha­gatas ?

However, the citta to which Gelu-pa refers is actually the bodhi- citta. There is a celebrated verse about this, which was pro­nounced by Vairocana in the Guhyasamaja, Chap. Two :sarvdbhdvavigatarji skandhadhatvdyatanagrahyagrdhakavarjitam / dharmanairdtmyasamatayd svacittam ddyanutpannarji funyata-bhdvam //“ My citta is free from all modes-of-being; avoids the per­sonality aggregates, realms, and sense bases, as well as subject and object; is primordially unborn, the intrinsic nature of voidness—through the sameness of dharmanai- ratmyaThere are also some other explanations of yuganaddha. Thus, J^ancakrama, 5th krama, verse 12, associates yuganaddha with the ‘central vein’ of the body :pindagrdhdnubheddbhyarji praveias tathatalaye / utthdnarp. ca tato yatra samatad yuganaddhakam //By haeans of contraction (pinda.graha) and expansion {anubheda)—the entrance, so in the abiding, and then"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"wherein the rising— through equality (of the two), there is ‘yuganaddha’.The Subhdfita-saifigraha (Part II, p. 42) quotes the Samvara- tantra about yuganaddha:esa svábhávikah kdy ah šúnyatákarunádvayah / naputfisaka iti khydto yuganaddha iti kvacit \\\\This Svábhávika Body, the non-duality of voidness and compassion, called the Androgyne, is sometimes said to be yuganaddha.Finally, Paňcakrama, 5th krama, verse 26 (Šrí Lak§mi. p. 52-2,3) defines yuganaddha in terms of samadhi*vajropamasamddhis tu nifpannakrama eva ca / máyopamasamádhiš cdpy advayarji tac ca kathyate //For the Diamond-like Samádhi is precisely the nifpanna- krama; and the Illusory Samadhi is the non-dual (know­ledge).At this point, Sri Laksmi quotes a verse without naming the source : “ W ith insight (prajna) one does not stay in sarfisara; with compassion (karund) one does not stay in (the quiescent) nirvana:—For a long time with not the means (updya) and for the same long time with the means” ( / ses rab kyis ni srid mi gnas I I sftiň rjes mya nan hdas mi gnas / / thabs med pa vis yun riri daň / / thabs kyis kyaň ni yun riň hid / ).

XV— is in that chapter classified by different families, according to Pradlpoddyotana (Mchan hgrely p. 120-4, 5 and 122-2). So, in the Sanskrit text, p. 94, the phrase, ‘He would shine like a Buddha’ (bhaved buddhasama- prabhah) refers to the yogin belonging to Vairocana. ‘The king who holds all dharmas’ (sarvadharmadharo raja) is the yogin of Amitabha. ‘By the praxis of Vajras^ttva’ (vajrasattvapra- yogatah) means Aksobhya’s yogin. ‘Shining like Vajrasattva’ (vajrasattvasamaprabhah) refers to Ratnasam bhava’s yogin. And ‘the one accomplishing the desire and the liberation’ (kdmamok$a- prasadhakah) is the yogin of Amoghasiddhi’s family. \"Besides, text, p. 95, the ‘one of diamond nature’ (vajradharmatman) is the superior yogin belonging to Amitabha.Guhyasamajatantra, XV, 11, places this attainment on the Tenth Stage : “He would be Vajradharmatman, dwelling on the Tenth Stage, the king who holds the Vaksamaya, the Paramesvara who is supreme.” (sa bhaved vajradharmatma dasabhum ipratisthitah / vaksamayadharo raja sarvagrah paramesvarah).IIGE/I geharji tasyambaraS caiva yatra sa caiati prabhuh / tatraiva ramate nityarp mahdsukhasamadhina ¡135/1 His home is th£ sky wherever he the Lord does roam.

Here, his ‘Y atharuta5 interpretation is most helpful :The ‘great forest5 is the sky of ‘she who is love’s um brella5. The ‘spot5 is the sky of *Devadatta. ‘Adorned with flowers, fruit, and so on5 is the sky of the Moon Lady.

Previously we took note that the318 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDÁNA VERSES319latter cakra constitutes theyogin’s ‘woman’. On the other hand, the remark in the PrakdSikd on Ge, “by the form of upper and lower bodhicitta” suggests both cakras.The PrakaSika on Ge also says, “whatever lotus of mudrd,” which refers to the families of goddesses respectively going with the five yogins mentioned under ‘BHA’, who, according to the Prakdiika, abide in their own form of introspection. According to Klon-rdol-bla-ma, as cited in my “ Female Energy . p. 94, the butcher maiden belongs to Aksobhya’s family; the washerman maiden to Vairocana’s; the necklace-slringer maiden to R atnasam bhava’s; the dancer maiden to Am itabha’s; the artisan maiden to Amoghasiddhi’s.Also, there are ‘ages’ ascribed to various ones of those maidens. According to the Guhyasamdjatantra, Chapter Four, verse 19 (Mchan hgrel, p. 40), and Chapter Sixteen verse 91 (Mchan hgrel, p. 147), the maiden belonging to Aksobhya’s family is aged 12; the one of Vairocana’s 16. The article “ Female E nergy... ” shows that this is consistent with the sizes ascribed to manéalas of Body, Speech and Mind in the Guhyasamdjatantra. Its Chapter Four mentions (Aksobhya’s) m anéala of Mind to have twelve hastas; its Chapter Sixteen mentions Vairocana’s manéala of Body to have sixteen hastas, and Am itabha’s mandala of Speech to have twenty hastas. O n this principle, the maiden of Amitabha’s family is aged 20. In that article, p. 105, I cited a passage from Saraha setting forth five ages, the eight-yeared Kumari, the twelve- year-old Sáliká, the sixteen-yeared one called Siddhá, the twenty-year-old *Báliká, and the twenty-five-yeared *Bhadra- kapálinl. By implication, Ratnasambhava’s and Amogha­siddhi’s maidens, in whatever order, have the ages of 8 and 25. The Guhyasamdjatantra (Chap. 8, verse 7) mentions the age 25, but no age 8. Since this Tantra regularly has a four-fold correspondence in terms of the four goddesses, and hence to four Tathágatas, the basic three plus Amoghasiddhi (the 'karmandtha'), it follows that Amoghasiddhi’s maiden is aged 25, but so far I find no passage to confirm this. In that article, p. 108, I included a quotation from the Mahamudrdtilaka : “ If one does not obtain a twelve-yeared, or sixteen-yeared female, adorned with good features, long eyes, attractive figure and youth, then a twenty-yeared one is proper. Other ‘seals’"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"320 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRA(mudra) above twenty put the occult power far off. O ne should offer his sister, daughter, or wife to the ‘master’ (guru).” This passage is one evidence that the ‘ages’ refer to the length of time it takes the yogin to reach the siddhi. O ther interpre­tations of the ‘ages’ presented in that article were, for the sixteen­yeared maiden, the sixteen voidnesses as well as sixteen vowels, the- sixteen transits of winds and the sixteen digits of the moon. The twelve-yeared maiden can be interpreted as the twelve vowels by leaving out the ‘two neuters’ (r, f, 1, and j) from the 16-vowel group, or as twelve transits by leaving out the last four transits.Besides, according to Guhyasamajatantra, Chap.XV, verse 51, the maidens can belong to eithert he realm of desire (kamadhatu) or the realm of form (rupadhatu). According to the Pradipoddyo- tana on this, the ones in the realm of desire can be the daugh­ters of the six passion families (the Tusita gods, etc., a standa­rd category of non-tantric Buddhism), the ones called ‘surabhoga? are the daughters of the Cakravartins; and the ‘kulavrata’ means they can belong to the families of gods, asuras, and so on. The ones in the realm of form have superior capacity (for siddhi).II II efv evabhasabhede$u sandhya-ratri-dinefu ca / vyavaharah krto loke jhdnalrayanidarSanat // 36 //A conventional illustration is made in the world regarding just these distinctions of lights as the twilight, the night, and the day—so as to see the three gnoses (jhana).Both Mchan and the Prakaiika have little to add here.These illustrations are made to the disciple by a revered guru by way of Initiation (abhijeka) .

In the morning twilight, when the nes­cience light has passed away but still the sun is not bright— this characterizes the Clear Light, clear, of immaculate aspect, the universal void free from body, speech, and mind. The rising of the sun is Spread-of-Light. The twilight of sunset is nescience. The time of moonrise is Light. Having in that way related the external illustra­tions of the four kinds of voidness, I shall teach the inner Abhisambodhis by this sequence characterized by intro­spection : One sees first a mirage appearance with a"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDÁNA VERSES323mass of five light rays. Second is Light, like moon-rays. Third is Spread-of-Light, like sun-rays. Fourth is Culmination-of-Light like darkness. Then, in an instant free from darkness, there is Clear Light, characterized by a very bright lasting light, the individual characteristic of Paramartha-satya, which one sees with the Eye of Knowledge.In that passage, Aryadeva presents four outer abhuatjibodhis (revelations), namely, natural phenomena revealing the voids or lights; and five inner abhisaijibodhis (also, revelations), namely, psychological states that are actually the voids or lights.The ‘revealed’ source for the Abhisambodhi illustrations is Guhyasamdjatantra, Chap. XV p. 95 :astamité tu vajrárke sádhanam tu samaiabhet / arunodgamavelaydtfi sidhyate bhdvanotlamaih //W hen the diamond sun is setting, he should begin the sadhana. At the initial appearance of dawn he will succeed with the supreme contemplation.The Pradipoddyotana, Mchan hgrel edition, on this (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 121-2), explains that the ‘diamond sun’ (vajrdrka) is characterized by the attainment of the ‘means’ gnosis (updya kind of jñana), hence Spread-of-Light. When this sets, there is the form of ‘insight’ (prajñd), hence Light. Then before the Clear Light can emerge, that Light must pass into Cul­mination-of-Light, which is the initial appearance of dawn, or nescience (avidyd). Then, on the basis of the three gnoses, namely, voidness, further voidness, and great voidness (Light, Spread-of-Light, and Culmination-of-Light), riding on the winds, the yogin soars to the Clear Light and perfects the mahd- mudrd (‘great seal’).The success in the practice is indicated in the Guhyasamdja- tantra, Chap. X V III, p. 162 :vajrapadmasamayogaj jvalya santapya yogina / udyate spha^ikakararji jñánasüryam iváparam //Through union of uajra and padma by the yogin, blazing, burning,------The incomparable sun of knowledge rises with crystalline appearance.That description clearly points to the mystical experiences of Gautama Buddha under the Tree of Enlightenment during the"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"3 2 4 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJAtANTRAnight inaugurated by defeat of the M ara host at dusk, and finally Full Enlightenment at the flush of dawn—in the joy-faced night (nandimukhayam rajanydm)y or night becoming rosy-colored, quoted from the Mahavastu in my “Notes on the Sanskrit Term Jfidna,” p. 265.

The first is from Šrl Ráhugupta- pada’s Prakáša-náma-šrihevajrasádhana (PTT, Vol, 56, p. 132-1): Among those (nine sentiments), the ‘single taste’ (ekarasa) together with (the goddess) N airátmyá is the ‘erotic’; the staying at the burning ground is the ‘heroic’; the furried brow and bared fangs is the ‘disgusting’; the blazing light is the ‘furious’; the enhancement (exagge­ration) of face is the ‘humorous’; the garland of dripping heads is the ‘frightful’; the consciousness of assisting sentient beings is the ‘compassionate’; the illusory form is the ‘wonderful’; the defilement of lust, etc. is the ‘tranquil’. The. second is from Šrl LaksmI, Vol. 63, p. 39-2 :(They are) union with the partner (mudra) (‘erotic’), staying in the burring ground, etc. (‘heroic’)., enjoying the ambrosia (‘furious’), rite of revived corpse (vetala- vidhi) -(‘disgusting’), holding of various emblems (‘humo­rous’), drastic rites (abhicdra) (‘frightful’), empathy with the great suffering of áll sentient beings (‘compassionate’), accomplishing enlightenment by the five great pledges, (samaya) in conňict with the world (i.e. the five that op­pose the five layman vows) (‘tranquil’), and the character­istic of having the Clear Light in immediacy (‘wonderful’). The goddess Nairátmyá of the formei passage belongs to the M other Tantra tradition; outside of this fact, the passag. is appropriate and helps explain Šrl Laksmi’s text, since she leaves out the titles ‘erotic’, etc.The three adamantine songs are very likely the group of three songs discussed in the Snags rim chen mo (f. 242b2, ff.): “The three songs are the ‘song of reality’ (lattvagita), ‘song of true nature’ {dharma tagita), and ‘song of m udrá’ (mudrágita)” (glu gsum ni de kho na ňid kyi glu daň chos ftid kyi glu daň pbyag rgyahi gluho). By ‘songs’ are meant verses that are sung, namely, ‘song of reality’ means a verse for ‘reality of intrinsic nature’ (*svabháva-tattva, T. raň bfin gyi de kho na ňid), one for ‘reality of mystic attainm ent’ (*vibhuti-tattva, hkhor bahi de kho na ňid), and one for ‘reality of purity’ (višuddhi-"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"COMMENTARY ON THE FORTY NIDANA VERSES329tattva, mam par dag pafoi de kho na ftid).

Jálandharipáda’s ňevajrasddhanasya-tippa$l~ iuddhi-vajrapradlpa (PTT, Vol. 56, p. 121-5) assigns colors to these goddesses as follows: the yellow goddess Vlpá, the red goddess Varpáa (bamboo flute), the smoky-colored goddess Murajá (barrel drum), the white goddess Mukundá (round drum) (/pi waň ma ser mo // gliň bu ma dmar mo / / rdza rňa ma du bafci mdog can ma / / rha zlum ma dkar mo /).For the sixty-four kald, it should be observed that the list of KdmasQtra begins with glta-vddya, so gltavddyddi ir the above Paňcakrama verse III, 31, can refer to the kalds in the ordinary meaning of the sixty-four worldly arts. However, Sri Lakgml’s commentary also permits the interpretation of kald as kdmakald. On p. 39-3, she states this particular list as beginning with ‘embracing’ (dliňganam, frkhyud pa) and ‘kissing’ (cumbana, (io byed), expressions which occur among the forty ‘male natures (cf. under nidána verse 2), but here obviously relate to kdma- Jdstra terminology of catufoatfi, Kloň rdol Bla ma, Vol. 1, Section Ma, presents two versions of arriving at the number sixty-four (catulifojfi): the kiss (fro byed pa), the embrace (bkhyud pa), the bite (so frdebs pa), the foře-play (yaň dag par bskyed pa), erotic cries {sid kyi sgra sgrogs pa), the male posture in coitus (skyes pafti bya ba), (the woman’s) getting on top (steň na fidugpa), (the eighth one not printed somehow, perhaps the ‘oral intercourse’ of KdmasQtra); each one divided into eight varieties, yielding sixty-four.

In illustration of his pVecpding exposition of yoga in four stages, he cites the Lahkdvatdra (Sagathakam, verses 256-258), but the verses in Tibetan reflect some minor variants (indicated here by underlining) of the Sanskrit text as presently edited by Bunyiu Nanjio :cittamdtram samdruhya bdhyam artharjx na kalpayet / tathatdlambane sthitvd cittamdtram atikramet // cittamdtram atikramya nirdbhdsam atikramet / nirdbhdsasthito yogi mahdydnaqi sa paiyati // andbhogagatify idntd praqidhdnair viiodhitd / jfldnam andtmakam ir^tfham mahdydnena pasyati //The following translation incorporates some of Ratnakara^nti's comments:256.

There is no dharma and no dharmatd [4th stage of yoga].Ratnakarasanti’s discussion of the four stages can be sum­marized as follows:1st stage of yoga: The meditative object on the pheno­menal limit of the entity. This is a kind* of waking state.2nd stage of yoga : All dharmas are ‘mind-only’; still thephenomenal limit. This is a kind of dream state, because if all dharmas are ‘mind-only’ they are all in the mind and not out­side, a feature of the dream state.3rd stage of yoga : Goes beyond ‘mind-only’; the thusnessend of the entity, or the non-appearance of phenomenal dharmas. This is a kind of dreamless sleep.4th stage of yoga : Having gone beyond the sign-sources ofnatures (dharma), now goes beyond those of underlying nature (dharmatd). This ushers in the Mahayana, i.e. the first bhumi called Pramudita.In further explanation, the four stages are referred to else­where as the four parts of nirvedha-bhagiya constituting in the Prajftaparamita scriptures and Abhisamayalarflkdra digest, the Stage of Action in Faith (adhimukti-cajya-bhumi) of the Bodhi- sattva.

In our earlier section on the two stages (Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion) the Pahcakrama was cited with trans­lation, “By yoga of a beginner, he attains the Eighth Stage, and seeing the three lights he is settled in the Tenth Stage.” This shows that the tantric theory of the mysterious lights leading up to Buddhahood should not be confused with this Prajnapara- mita theory of lights leading up to the Bodhisattva career. However, there may have been an intention to establish a para­llel of mystical experiences; and such parallels are consistent with my tentative dating of the Guhyasamajatantra and Explana­tory Tantras in the 4th and 5th centuries, A.D. Besides, my discussion earlier in this book shows that the ‘lights’ also occur in mundane conditions.Now, returning to that verse of the Guhyasamaja, Chap. XV, the basic tantra already shows the context as ‘dream examina­tion.’ Besides, we may consult the Pradipoddyotana commentary and its annotation (the Mchan-hgrel) for further information about the verse in question. In the Praaipoddyotana (PTT, Vol. 158, p. 132-2, 3, 4), the parts of the verse can be understood as answering questions.Question 1: Where are the dharmas ? The verse, alludingto the dream state, replies : ‘all dharmas’ are located within one’s mind.Question 2: Where is that mind ? The verse, alluding to"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"APPENDIX I335dreamless sleep, replies: It is in the diamond of sky, to wit,the Clear Light. [Recall in this connection Table III of this book, “The Clear Lights,’’ indicating the Clear Light of dream­less sleep.]Questions 3 and 4: Suppose it be asked if there is a presence separate from the mind. The verse replies : There is no dharma, to wit : there is no self-nature of the entities. Suppose it be asked if there is sometimes (kadd cit) an underlying; nature (idharmatâ). The verse replies : There is no underlying nature.Heré the Pradipoddyotana cites two verses without identifying the source (which the Mchan-hgrel traces to a citation in Spyod bsdttSy i.e. the Caryâmelâpakapradipa, and states to be consistent with the Vajramâlà) :tathaiva dhàtvàyatanendriyàdau jnânadvaye taira susamhatetasmin /fünye mahad-viiati yah prasuptah svapnam prapafyet khaluvàtarji satfif rayât // supte prabuddhe cana ca nànyatedam. sarjikalpayet svapna-phalâbhilâfi /svapnopamâs te sarvadharmâ mrfàmrfâJ câpi tayor abhâvah // In like?manner, one is in deep sleep when he enters great in that void (Culmination of Light) wherein the pair of gnoses (Light and Spread-of-Light) are gathered, in the elements (four, i.e. earth, etc.), the sense bases (four objects), the sense organs (four, eye, etc.), and so on (the personality aggregates, i.e. the first four). Should one take recourse to the winds, surely he will see a dream.The one wishing the fruit of dream (i.e. good fruit from a good dream), should examine this non-difference, not even in sleeping and waking. All dharmas are like a dream. Moreover, falsehood and truth are not present in the two (sleeping and waking).Apparently, the first verse is intended to amplify the answers to thé first two questions, referring to the states of dream and dreamless sleep. The second verse should therefore be construed to amplify the answers to the third and fourth questions, explaining the denial of a dharma or dharmatâ. The logical distinction of truth and falsehood is not present. And yet there is no denial of the fruit of dream.If one compares this Pradipoddyotana explanation of the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"336YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAGuhyasamaja verse with what Ratnakarasanti said about it* there does not appear any essential disagreement, even though the discussion proceeds somewhat differently. Indeed, there is no disagreement as yet with those verses cited from the Lanka- vatara-sfitra, where in the fourth stage the yogin sees the M aha- yana; because in the second of the two verses edited and trans­lated above, one realizes that “all dharmas are like a dream,** which is a frequent teaching of the Mahayan^.Now, it is a striking feature of those stages of yog£, as Ratna­karasanti understands the Lankavatara verses, with the further corresponding statements drawn out above, that certain state­ments seem to conflict with others. T hat is to say, in the 2nd stage, it is said that all dharmas are mind-only. If that is what they are, then why in the 3rd stage does one go beyond mind- only to reach reality ? And if one has reached reality, why should he go to a further state said to deny both the dharma and the dharmata ? It seems to be the case that the individual statements constitute the mottos for a given level of yoga experience and for the yogins with that experience. But if this be granted, it denies that the same precept is given to all yogins.Now, it appears that this is the identical procedure of state­ment found in the old Buddhist classic, tl\\e Dhammapada (XX, 5, 6, 7), “All constructions are impermanent” (sabbe sankhara anicca)y “All constructions are suffering” (sabbe sankhara, dukkha), “All dhammas are non-self” (sabbe dhamma anatta). In illustration, the first statement, “All constructions are imper­m anent,” is convincing on the intellectual level, and so is addressed to laymen, monks, and anyone else who will listen. But, having said this, the Buddha said something else about the constructed things, “All constructions are suffering,” and this statement is not convincing on the intellectual level; it turns out to be the precept to the aryas9 or iravakas, the disciples of the Buddha who are told to look upon suffering as suffering and upon happiness as suffering because it entails suffering or will lead to suffering. Furthermore, the Buddha said, “Ail dhammas (S. dharmdh) are non-self,” bringing into the discussion the celebrated teaching of Buddhism, the non-self (an-atman) theory that has always been characteristic of Buddhism. This state­ment is not convincing on the intellectual level, because dharmas"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"APPENDIX I337such as love and hate are understood by the intellect to require a self that loves and hates. Therefore, the statement cannot be made intelligently to everyone, but also it is not just the way the disciples should look upon constructed things, because in Buddhism the dharmas are not only in the constructed cate­gory but also there is the unconstructed kind, for example, Nirvana. Nirvana is the goal of the path, for which it is neces­sary to follow the procedures of Meditation as a yogin. There­fore, it may be concluded along the same lines that the state­ment, “All dhammas are non-self,” is the precept for the yogins.Then the question naturally arises, if the statement, “All dhammas are non-self,” is a yoga precept, can it be placed among the stages of yoga that have been set forth above on the basis of the Lafikdvatara verses and Guhyasamaja verse? This precept is immediately identifiable with the 2nd yoga stage, which is the stage that takes the ‘self5 out of “ all dharmas” In explanation, the statement, “All dharmas are mind-only” refers to the dream state. In this state, the object (the world of dharmas) is param ount and the self is in abeyance; hence, “All dharmas are non-self” (cf. the quotation of Anangavajra under the Nidana verse JR A ). Accordingly, one may also conclude that the Dhammapada precept, “All constructions are suffering,” applies to the 1st stage of yoga, the meditative object oh the phenomenal limit of the entity, involving the phenomenal self that suffers. In agreement the Buddha said (.Dhammapada, X X I, 7-12), “The disciples of Gautama are always well awake (pabujjhanti).” Certainly yoga begins in the waking state.The above helps us regarding the 3rd stage of yoga. This is said to go beyond mind-only (the dream state) and to refer to dreamless sleep, with the non-appearance of phenomenal dharmas. It follows that this is the stage when the subject is paramount and the object is in abeyance, and so one sees no dream. This conclusion forces the word dharmatd (underlying nature) to apply to the subject.Having concluded that much, it is also possible to appreciate the meaning of the 4th stage, when there is no dharma but also no dharmatd. In short, “ there is no dharma” denies a dream; and “there is no dharmatd” denies a dreamless sleep— thus deny­ing both subject and object. This turns out, according to the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"3 3 8YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAforegoing treatments, to be a climactic transitional state—in one case, leading immediately to the onset of the M ahayana; and in another case, to complete Buddhahood.Since this comparison of the Lahkavatara verses with the single Guhyasamaja verse has been sufficiently exposed on its own terminological side, it should be of interest to see to what extent this dovetails with Guhyasamaja yoga stages previously presented in this work. My subsection “The six members of yoga and the five kramas in the Stage of Completion” presented the commentarial exegesis of certain verses in the Guhyasamaja, Chap. VI, including verse 4 :He should accomplish the selflessness of citta being visua­lized (ciitanidhyaptinairatmyarfi), (then) the contemplation of speech (vaca) and body, (then) the triple conjunction, (finally) the abode equal to space.If one wishes to match these up with the stages already discussed in this appendix, it follows immediately that the “selflessness of citta being visualized” is the 2nd stage of yoga : “all dharmas are located within one’s m ind” and this is the non-self of dharmas. Tnerefore, the preceding contemplation (‘body as the m antra visualized’) corresponds to the 1st stage of yoga. It follows, that this treatm ent does not allow the more generalized inter­pretation of yoga stages, as previously, to vlead up to either the beginning of the bodhisattva path (M ahayana) or to Complete Buddhahood. Indeed, the context shows that the interpre­tation is fully within the M ahayana scope, just as the four nirvedha-bhdgiya were within the pre-M ahayana scope; In the present case, the “ body as the m antra visualized” is the accom­plishment of the Stage of Generation (= the first seven Bodhi­sattva stages), and “ selflessness of citta being visualized” is the beginning of the Stage of Completion ( = the last three Bodhi­sattva stages)* Then, the comparison continues along the same lines, that the “ contemplation of speech and body” is the M aha­yana version of the 3rd stage of yoga, the Svadhisthana, or initial M aham udra, as the thusness end, or-the non-appearance of phenomenal dharmas. Finally the “ triple conjunction,” or “divine body made of m ind,” is equivalent to the transitional 4th stage of yoga, which goes beyond the sign-sources of dharmas and dharmata presumably to be “ purified by the Clear Light like a gem cleansed by fire” (Nidana verse RAJ."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"APPENDIX I339Finally, the \"abode equal to space” which generates the body of M ahavajradhara has no equivalent in the four stages of yoga.

But this is an exciting topic about a Tibetan contro­versy that reaches back to im portant Indian theories of the fruits of yoga; as such it deserves a special treatment. Various forms of Indian philosophy take account of a subtle body {suk$ma- farira). However, it is only in such T antric currents as the one presented in the foregoing work that a whole upward career is worked out for this subtle body. This kind of body is of course denied immediately by the materialistic person. Here I am not arguing for the existence of such a mysterious body, but simply reporting the facts of the Guhyasamdja system, which speaks of an “arcane body” which on the Stage of Completion is called the “ illusory body” of “impure illusory body,” that can emerge from the ordinary body.In fact, the theory is by no means original with the Guhya- samdjatantra because ancient Buddhism already referred to it with the terminology of “mental body” or “ body made of m ind” (manotnaya-kaya), to which I have previously alluded. Here I should add that the Lahkavatarasutra mentions three kinds of mental body, which combine well with the theory in the Arya school of the tantric Nagarjuna and Aryadeva that the Stage of Completion begins with the Eighth Bodhisattva Stage. The first mental body, with stabilization in the pleasure of samadhi (,samadhisukhasamapatti-mctnomaya), which according to that scripture is developed in the course of the first seven Bodhi­sattva stages, therefore, belongs to the Stage of Generation. The second kind, which completely comprehends the intrinsic nature of the dharmas (dharmasvabhavdvabodha-manomaya ) and which is said to proceed to all the Buddha realms necessarily would be placed in the Stage of Completion as the “ arcane body” of that Stage. According to the Guhyasamdja tradition, that"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"APPENDIX II341“arcane body” is succeeded by, or next subjected to, the “arcane speech” and then the “arcane mind.” It is only at the phase of “arcane mind” that this mental or spiritual body “comple­tely comprehends the intrinsic nature of the dharmas,” which means in Pancakrama terminology that it completely under­stands the eighty prakrtis associated with the three Light stages, as experienced on the Tenth Bodhisattva Stage. The third kind of mental body, which performs the instigations natural to its class (nikayasahajasaTtiskdrakriyd-rwriomaya), i.e. natural to the class of Buddhas, is the yuganaddha-deha of this Tan trie tradition.At first glance, a certain verse of the Guhyasamajatantra does not seem related to the above, but I shall demonstrate the relevance of Chapter XV, verse 22, of that Tantra, as follows, which is almost the same as the last verse-* of Chapter XII (“Documents”) :buddho dharmadharo vdpi vajrasattvo ’pi vd yadi / atikramed yadi mohatmd tad antarji tasya jivitam 11 If someone would go beyond whether as a,Buddha, a holder of Dharma, or as a Vajrasattva; and if he is delud­ed, he would lose his life.Candrakirti’s Pradipoddyatana (Mchan ed., p. 122-2,3) repeats substantially its comment on the Chapter XII verse, to wit, that the expression “Buddha” means “yogin of Vairocana,” and so on. In this case, Celu-pa’s Ratnavrkfa commentary on Chapter XV (PTT, Vol. 63, p. 211-5) is more helpful. It explains that “Buddha” is the Diamond of Body ; “holder of Dharma” is the Diamond of Speech; and “Vajrasattva” is the Diamond of Mind (sans rgyas ni sku rdo rjeho / chos hdzin pa ni gsuh rdo rjeho / rdo rje sem$ dpah ni thugs rdo rjeho /). This comment immediately associates this verse with the ex- pi essions Body, Speech, and Mind that have such an important role throughout the Guhyasamajatantra as well as in certain nidana verses. In consideration that this Chapter XV has previously in its verse 11 referred to the Tenth Stage (of the Bodhisattva), one may recall in this connection the rather remarkable statements about the last three Bodhisattva Stages (Eighth through Tenth) in the manual of the Tathagatagarbha theory, the Ratnagoiravibhdga (ed. of Johnston, pp. 3.21-4.6): I tatra yato ’sfamyam bodhisattvabhumau vartamanah"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"3 42YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÀJ AT ANTRAsarvadharma-vasitapràpto bhavati tasmât sa bodhiman^a- varagatah sarvadharmasamatâbhisambuddha ity ucyate / yato navamyàm bodhisattvabhúmau vartamâno ’nuttara- dharmabhànakatvasampannah sarvasattvááayasuvidhijña indriyaparam apâram itâprâptah sarvasattvaklesavâsanànu- samdhisamudghàtanakusalo bhavati tasmât so ’bhisam- buddhabodhih supravartitadharmacakra ity ucyate / yato dasamyàm bhûmâv anuttaratathàgatadharmayauva- ràjyàbhisekapràptyanantaram anàbhogabuddhakàryapra- tiprasrabdho bhavati tasmât sa supravartitadharmacakro ’nantasisyaganasuvinlta ity ucyate /Among those, for the reason that his attainment of power over all dharmas takes place on the Eighth Bodhisattva Stage, it is said (in the Dháranisvararájasütra), ‘He, having proceeded to the best terrace of Enlightenment ( = the Tree of Enlightenment), was enlightened on the equality of all dharmas’. For the reason that his endow­ment of preaching the incomparable Dharma, his know­ing of the good rules for the hopes of all sentient beings, his attainm ent of the highest perfection of faculties, and his virtue of annihilating the continuance of defilement habit-energy in all sentient beings, lake place on the Ninth Bodhisattva Stage, it is said, ‘FJe, with enlighten­ment fully awakened, has well set into 'motion the Wheel of the D harm a.’ For the reason that immediately after receiving, on the Tenth Stage, the Grown-Prince consec­ration for the incomparable Tathàgata-Dharm a he is roused (apratipraSrabdha) to the effortless Buddha duties— it is said, ‘He who well set into motion the Wheel of the Dharma has well trained the innumerable host of disciples.” T hat is to say, in this particular tradition, it is the Body of the Buddha sitting under the Bodhi Tree that occurs on the Eighth Stage, his Speech as the Wheel of Doctrine that is on the Ninth, his M ind roused to Buddha duties that is on the Tenth. In Tantrism, this Body, Speech, and M ind are called the “ three mysteries of the Buddha.”This plausible explanation of the sequence ‘Buddha’, ‘Dharma holder’, and ‘Vajrasattva’ of the Guhyasamâja verse, still leaves unexplained the mysterious remark that the one who would go beyond in such status would lose his life if he be dc-"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"APPENDIX XI343luded. However, this is a reasonable remark in the light of the Lankdvatara*s second kind of ‘‘mental body,” prevalent on the Eighth through Tenth Bodhisattva Stages, because the Lanka- vatdra's claim that this body visits all the Buddha realms is a way of saying that it has emerged by yoga praxis from the ordinary body. If the yogin does not have skill in guiding his movements in these Buddha realms—whatever we may think them to be—he could lose his life, because the separation of the “mental body” would be tantamount to death’s separation. This points to the importance of the first kind of “mental body,” that immersed in samadhi, because presumably this is a necessary preparation for the dangerous trips of the subsequent second kind. If this sort of teaching has been derived from the life of the Buddha, one can promptly think of Gautam a’s celebrated austerities by the Nairanjana River when his body eventually became so wasted that viewers could not decide whether he was dead or alive. This extreme mortification immediately preceded G autam a’s passage to the Bodhi Tree where, accord­ing to the tradition of the above Tathagatagarbha literature, he represented a Bodhisattva of the Eighth Stage.Indeed, the premise of such a “mental body” or illusory body as the “ arcane body” of the Stage of Completion makes it clear why the great commentators on this Tantra, e.g. the Indian tan tries Nagarjuna and Aryadeva, and Tsoh-kha-pa in Tibet, again and again emphasized that the Stage of Gene­ration must precede the Stage of Completion. Any tantric who would try to practise the Stage of Completion without first having the Stage of Generation, would be relying on instruc­tion and precepts which demand that the body be an “ arcane body” in the sense of that advanced Stage, while in fact the person enterprising that Stage would only be starting with his ordinary human body that is not even a sanctified body in the worldly sense of withdrawal from certain foods, the opposite sex, and society generally—let alone “arcane” in any way.All the above is necessary to appreciate Tsoh-kha-pa’s insistence on an “arcane body” in both the Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion. His solution, as I have come to understand it, is easy to state: the “arcane body” of the Stage of Generation is the “ hundred lineages” in the Atiyoga phase; and the “ arcane body\" of the Stage of Completion is the first"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"3 4 4YOGA OF THE GU HYASAMÁJ AT ANTRAtwo members of the six-membered yoga, namely pratyahara and dhyana. But while he expressly identified the second kind of ‘ ‘arcane body” in that manner, I never found him stating the first kind in such a simple manner : he always wrapped the matter in complicated discussions, because of the controversy.In accordance with Tson-kha-pa’s annotation of the Forty Verses and my grouping of those verses, I placed the minute correspondences called the “hundred lineages” (T. rigs brgya) in the first group of verses concerning the Stage of Generation, in fact beginning with the set which I associated with the division of vdjra called. Atiyoga. Then, more recently to my surprise, T could find no mention of these “hundred lineages” in a work by Tson-kha-pa’s faithful disciple Mkhas-grub-rje devoted to the topic of the Stage of Generation, namely the latter’s work Rgyud thams. cad kyi rgyal po dpal gsan ba hdus pahi bskyed rim dhos grub rgya mtsho kesb ya ba . (“The ‘Ocean of Siddhis’ about the Stage of Generation in the King of all Tantras, the Sri-Guhyasamdja” ), wherein I find important points of Tson-kha-pa’s position amplified and defended by Mkhas- grub-rje. His silence on the m atter was confirmed when I perused a work by Blo-bzan-chos-kyi-rgyal-mtshan, the First Panchen Lama, namely his Gsan hdus gdams hag rim lha gsal sgron gyi shin pohi gnad kun bsdus pa (“ Concise^ statement of the essential points, clarifying the Pahcakrama' precepts of the Guhyasamdja”). This work expressly states that the “hundred lineages” belong to the Stage of Completion, with the remark, “The contemplation in which there is the arising as the Body of a deity involved with the illustrious ‘hundred lineages’ and so forth, is the arcane body of the Stage of Completion” (dam pa rigs brgya la sogs pahi lha skur ¿ar bar bsgom pa ni rdzogs pa rim pahi lus dben yin te). Accordingly, the author treats these “hundred lineages” in his work devoted to the Stage of Completion.O f course, I again referred to Tson-kha-pa’s elaborate discussions of the “ arcane body” problem to see if, after all I might have misunderstood his position. I could find no reason to change my conclusion. Besides, Tson-kha-pa, in his sadhana of the Guhyasamdja entitled Rnal hbyor dag pahi rim pa (“ thepure stages of yoga” ) (P IT , Vol. 160, p. 89-4) states : “After generating in that way the thirty-two gods, he should"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"APPENDIX II345respectively contemplate them in sequence as the nature of the five personality aggregates, the four elements, the eight consist­ing of eye, etc., the five sense objects starting with form, and the set of ten beginning with right arm; this is Atiyoga” (de/ Itar lha sum cu so gfiis po bskyed pahi hog tu re re nas rim pa bfin phun po lna dan / khams bii dan mig la sogs pa brgyad dan I gzugs la sogs pa lna dan / lag pa gYas pa la sogs pa bcuhi no bor bsam par bya ste / sin tu rnal hbyor ro /) Our earlier discussions show that Atiyoga is the third of the four yogas in the Stage of Generation, called Yoga, Anuyoga, Ati­yoga, and Mahayoga. Tson-kha-pa’s remark further confirms my division of the verses in which I assign Atiyoga to the third group of verses (Bhagavan Sarva), because it is precisely in these verses that Tson-kha-pa begins his “arcane body” comments, starting with the verse about the five personality aggregates. Besides, Tson-kha-pa, when explaining the four­teen fundamental falls of the Vajrayana in his Duos grub kyi she rm and grouping those falls (PTT, Vol. 160, p. 70-1,2) classifies as a fall in the Stage of Generation the fall No. 8, “ to abuse the five skandhas, for their nature belongs to the five Buddhas.” Pursuant to the given reason (“ their nature belongs to the five Buddhas” ), one could extend this remark about the personality aggregates (skandha) to the sense bases and so on, with which deity is identified in the Atiyoga stage. Doubt­less, Tson-kha-pa follows a tradition which places the “ hundred lineages” in the Stage of Generation; and I need not speculate on the particular reasons for later luminaries of his school to have understood the matter differently. Still, it is possible to set forth the chief controversial aspect in the following manner.Tson-kha-pa has his most complicated discussion of the “arcane body” controversy in his Pahcakrama commentary, starting Vol. 158, p. 201 and continuing for a number of pages in the photographic edition (each page with five folio sides). It so happens that Tson-kha-pa repeats much of the same discussion about the “ arcane body” in a later work, his Mthah gcod (“Deciding the alternatives” ) on the individual chapters of the Guhyasamajalantra, namely, in his mthah gccd of Chapter VI (PTT, Vol. 156, pp. 39 and 40). I have presented this Chapter in “Documents” and also treated the relevant verses (nos. 3-6) in my section “The six members of yoga and the"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"3 4 6 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAfive kramas in the Stage of Completion.” Since Tson-kha-pa’s discussion here shows that the argument devolves about the expression in verse 3, “ the one who has body as the m antra visualized” (mantranidhyaptikqyena), it is well to present Candra- kirti’s comment on that verse 3, as I edit from the Pradipoddyolana manuscript and accordingly translate in Mchan hgrel context : I m antranidhyapti ityadi / m antra alikalijah / sarpadi- svabhavas tesam strlpurpnapumsakatvena tryaksaradhar [abhutja m antrah tryak$arani / tesam pravesasthiti- vyutthanasvabhavena parijftanarp mantranidhyaptih / tatra purvakam kayena vajrajapasya sadhanabhutena nirmanasarirepa vaca vajrajapenopalak§itah / manasi hfdi hrdisthito vajrasattvah coditah/yathabhutaparijnanena visayikrlah / bhavayed iti / yogisantanasya vakyama- nakarn catasro ’vastha nispadayet / kas ta ity aha / pravara ityadi /pravaram utkr§tam cittavivekalaksanarp vajrajapad adhikatvat siddhim iti / svadhisthanalaksanam mahamudra manah samtosayatlti manahsamtosanam mahamudra- visuddhikaratvat / priyam is^am bhavasama-ekalaksa- narp mahavajradharamurtim ni§padayet /As to the verse “The one who has body as the m antra visualized...” , ‘mantras’ arise from the (sixteen) vowels and the (thirty-three or thirty-four) consonants and are constituted by such expressions as SARPA. Among them, when mantras have as basis three syllables by way of female (Ah), male (Om), and androgyne (Hum), they are the three syllables. The thorough knowledge of those (three) by way of inhalation (Om), holding of breath (Ah), and exhalation (Hum) is the ‘m antra visualized’. Here, the one who previously has the (arcane) body, that is, the body of hypostasis (by the five Tathagatas and so on) which arose through a sddhana of diamond muttering, should accomplish, i.e. intensely contemplate, exhorted by speech, i.e. by Diamond Muttering, in the mind, i.e. in (one’s own) heart, that is, (exhorted) meaning ‘distinguished’ while the Vajrasattva dwelling in the heart (within the central ‘vein’ of the dharmacakra) is made the object (of cons­ciousness) by that thorough knowledge (of the three phases of the wind) as they really are, that is (should"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 11347accomplish) four states to be explained of the yogin’s stream of consciousness. W hat are those ? (The text) says: the ‘surpassing one’, and so on, namely (1) the ‘surpassing one’, i.e. outstanding one, with the character of ‘Arcane M ind’, because it outlasts Diamond Muttering; (2) ‘successful one’, with the character of Personal Blessing, namely the M ahamudra; (3) ‘one satisfying the m ind’, that is, “ It brings satisfaction to the mind,” because it purifies the M ahamudra; (4) ‘beloved one’, i.e. wished for, that is, he accomplishes the body of M ahavajradhara with the single character of the pheno­menal world and the realm of quiescence.W ith that passage before us, it is easier to see how those who took Candraklrti’s commentary as the most authoritative one on the Guhyasamajatanlra, would be troubled to determine by this passage which of the two Stages to assign the “arcane body” . Gandraklrti’s subsequent commentary on Chapter VI shows that the contemplation of the winds by means of the three syllables can be understood either in the form appropriate to the Stage of Generation or to that appropriate to ’the Stage of Completion. Some persons could maintain that this verse of the Guhyasamajatantra refers to the five stages which Nagarjuna systematized in his Pahcakrama, beginning with Diamond M uttering; for, as well known, the Pahcakrama deals only with the Stage of Completion. On the other hand, some persons could point to the word 1purvakarjx’ in Candrakirti’s commentary to suggest that the “ body as the mantra visualized” is a prior accomplishment, already at hand when the yogin is exhorted by Diamond M uttering of the Stage of Completion variety. Besides, Candrakirti did not help matters when, in his commen­tary on Chapter X II, 60-64 (see “Documents” ), he explained the Stage of Completion, not with this terminology from Chapter VI, verse 3, but rather with the terminology of six-membered yoga from Chapter X V III. In the case of the six members, Diamond M uttering would have to be assigned to pranayama, the third member, leaving the first two members, praty&hdra and dhyana, to be argued about. No wonder there were dis­agreements over this “ arcane body” IAs I understand Tsofi-kha-pa’s solution, it allows for both interpretations of the expression “body as the mantra"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"3 4 8YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMÁJATANTRAvisualized” . This amounts to an admission that the two stages called Stage of Generation and Stage of Completion are dis­tinctions imposed upon the basic Tantra. If we decide upon the Stage of Generation, we can consult Candraklrti’s com­mentary on Chapter X II, 60-64, to see at once that in the case of the four steps, he mentions that the three syllables of Om, etc. are deposited in the body in the second step, Upasadhana = Anuyoga. This agrees with our placing in the second group of verses the material on muttering by means of the three syllables, allotting four seconds to each (nidana verse 12, YE). This is held to generate the primeval lord (adinatha). How­ever, in Tson-kha-pa’s position, this body of the second step is still not the £Carcane body” . For the latter attainment the yogin must pass to the third step, the Atiyoga, in which there is the hypostasis of divinity into the body by such means as the correspondences established in the c'hundred lineages” . This body becomes called in the fourth step the \"m antra- purusa” , seen with three heads, etc.. Then, if the same line of Chapter VI, verse 3, is understood to refer to the Stage of Completion, the \"body as the m antra visualized” is the \"arcane body” of the Stage of Completion, namely pratyahara and dhydna, to which the two nidana verses (KA-YA) are devoted. In such a case, the remaining four members, pranaydma, etc., of the six-membered yoga, have to be equated with the five steps of the Pahcakrama.Because the above is itself so involved and technical, I have decided to forego any more of Tson-kha-pa’s portrayal of vary­ing positions about this \"arcane body” . In summary, the \"arcane body” of the Stage of Generation becomes that way because imagined to be invested with deities. But according to the theory of steps, the yogin should first pass through a kind of symbolic death through attainm ent of the void; then imagine himself in an intermediate state by three-syllabled breathing; now he can pass to a symbolic birth wherein his body is inhabited by deities; and finally return to the world with transfigured consciousness. The yogin is now ready to embark upon the dangerous Stage of Completion, with the drawing forth of an advanced \"arcane body,” the Illusory Body. This Illusory Body— the \"arcane body” of the Stage of Completion—is the reenactment of the primeval androgyne."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"APPENDIX IIIT H E PRAXIS ACCORDING TO ARYADEVAThere are many ways of setting forth the indications of practice that were touched upon in the foregoing introductions and annotation of the nidana verses. Perhaps the clearest statement of the practice in the Stage of Completion is that found in Aryadeva’s Carydmeldpakapradipay a work which has already contributed considerably (for example, the ‘hundred lineages* stem from here). Aryadeva’s passage happens to be extant in Sanskrit in Bendall’s edition of the Subhd$ita-satfigraha, Part II, pp. 33-35; but Bendall did not trace the Aryadeva work.The Sanskrit passage is found in the Tibetan translation in bits and snatches, and one section could not be traced at all.

First he experiences the three kinds of form and of the other sensory objects. After that, for the rites of puri­fication and so on, upon all food— he recalls the inner hearth, whose shape is real, and arouses the pride, “ I make a burnt offering in the three-tongued flame which is the configuration of the self on the face of the Samadhi Being,” and partakes ot food.

Thus (the performer having satiated the diam ond of body (with elixir), (takes) some (consort, mudra), by way of form, a prajna like himself (or: his own light, svabha).

Thus he intrpspects the true forms of Prajfiaparamita and so on. In this way the yogin, practising the glorious Mahasukha- samadhi, reaches eminence, and matures the sentient beings by hindering and assisting in the (32-deity) gioup-man^ala.In that way, again and again he enters the true limit (bhutakofi); and having emerged again and again he experiences the five ‘strands of desire5 as the five Tathagata forms, so the (sublime) mind does not fade.Then, the great yogin, discursive thought lacking in himself, so as to teach the intrinsic nature of all entities, cleansing what is forbidden in the world, stays in a private place and enjoys, to wit :— he makes r?o mudras, mantfalas, or caityas, nor recites texts, nor mortifies the body, nor bows to images of cloth, wood, or stone, nor (takes refuge) in Sravakas or Pratyekabuddhas, nor depends on time in terms of lunar days, asterisms, or muhurtas.

As said in the Mulasutra (i.e. Guhyasamaja, V II, 2, with variant readings) :By recourses that enjoy all desires ( — deities) according to pleasure; and by the praxis of one’s presiding lord one (respectively) worships others and oneself.So ends the Subhd$ita-samgraha citation of Aryadeva’s ‘lucid words5.

Besides, Šákvamitra’s Carydmelápakapradipa-\\xkd in Columbia University’s Narthang edition was consulted in the relevant section near the end, but proved of little value.In order to explain Aryadeva’s account in the terminology already drawn from the Guhyasamdjatantra and associated commentarial literature, it is necessary to observe that he says, “Having first taken Supreme Truth as the meditative object...” and says in the next sentence in further explanation, “First he experiences the three kinds of fo rm .. . . ” One can refer to the three kinds of each sense object (as in Guhyasamaja, Chap. V II) by desire, aversion, and indifference, as does Aryadeva.Toga Stages 1 and 2 Body as the Mantra Visualized Selflessness of the Mind VisualizedThe account begins with the yogin located in a solitary glade. In this connection Aryadeva cites Guhyasamaja, XVI, p. 126, “The sadhaka with firm resolve, always seeks alms in the glade. Trembling with fear they give food divinely pre­p a r e d ....” * The Pradipoadyotana (Mchan hgrel, p. 148-1) mentions the unshared food but does not clarify who does the giving or why they are frightened. It converts the yogin’s glade to the ‘great forest’ (vane mahafavydíji). Celu-pa’s com­mentary, Ratnavrk$a-náma-rahasya-sarndja-vrtti (PTT, Vol, 63, p. 227-2), is;more helpful, because it explains, <ffood not shared with men and having the hundred flavors” (mi daň thun moň ma yin pahi ¿al zas ro brgya daň ldan p a); and “ those tree divinities frightened by the fiery nimbus (tejas) of his evocation power, give (it)” (šiň la gnas pahi lha de dag sgrub dbaň dehi gzi brjid kyis skrag nas ster bar hgyur ro). This explanation immediately associates those Guhyasamdja verses with the episode*The verse is correctly given in Bhattacharyya’s edition to begin with vane, the second line to begin with dadanti; while Bagchi’s edition incorrectly assigns the vane line to verse 98B, and starts verse 99 with dadanti. The Pradipoddyotana manuscript supports Bhattacharyya here with the words vane-ityádi."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"3 5 4 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAof the Buddha’s enlightenment under the Tree, which is called ‘terrace of enlightenment’ (bodhiman<jla) and has four ‘divinities of enlightenment’ (bodhidevata) (cf. my Buddhist Tantras, p. 186). It is obviously a development from the early Buddhist legend of the girl Sujata, who brought food in a golden bowl to the meditating Gautam a who, after six years of fruitless austerity, decided on a middle course (cf. Edward J. Thomas, The Life of Buddha, pp. 70-71). As to who are those tree divi­nities, Tson-kha-pa (commentary on Pahcakrama, PTT, Vol. 159, p. 77-3) states the ‘companion for accomplishing the food5 (kha zas sgrub pahi grogs) to be the Yaks!, the Kimkara (ser­vant), etc. (gnod sbyin mo mhag giug ma sogs) as the best. This explanation is consistent with the standard explanation of the female- figure on the Sanch! gate as a Yaks! or Yaksini. Also, earlier in Guhyasamaja, Chap. X V I and its commentary, there are several mentions of the Yaks! lady; for example, Mchati hgrel, p. 146-2, identifies these yaksi-s as Vajradakinl-s.Aryadeva’s account starts with the yogin tantam ount to the Body of the Buddha silting under the Bodhi tree. Hence the solitary glade is the yogin’s own body as the mantfala. It is the “ arcane body” of the Stage of Completion, discussed under the Nidana verses KA-YA, and is equivalent to the Eighth Stage of the Bodhisattva. Now, o^r earlier discussions have gone into the m atter of how this “ arcane body” is actually the accomplishment of the previous Stage of Generation and is brought forward into the Stage of Completion. This is now combined with a new stage of yoga; and as the first appendix showed, the new stage has been referred to as “ the selflessness of citta being visualized,” a yoga state of dream.The two stages are suggested by the two celebrated gestures of the seated Buddha—right hand in the earth-touching gesture (‘body as the m antra .visualized’), and left hand level at the heart in the equipoise (samapatti) gesture (‘selflessness of the mind visualized’).Toga Stage 3 The Svadhifthana, or initial MahamudraAryadeva has taken the first two yoga stages for granted and goes immediately to the 3rd stage, saying, “ Having first"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III355taken Supreme Truth as the meditative object, by the Stage of Personal Blessing (svádhiffhána-krama) he abides with himself as the body of Vajrasattva.” Under Nidána verse CIT, Aryadeva’s same work was already cited in a remarkable passage on how to visualize the Supreme Truth, in a process that leads to the yoga condition of deep sleep and the revelation of the Clear Light. In the present passage, observe that Arya­deva’s expression dtmdkrti (configuration of the self) is consistent with the conclusion in Appendix No. 1 that in the 3rd stage of yoga, referring to dreamless sleep, the subject is paramount and the object is in abeyance—the subject now being indicated as “ configuration of the self” . Despite this condition of pure subjectivity devoid of dream object, the description emphasizes the extreme bliss, since the yogin dwells in the circle of the goddesses. One may refer to Nidána verse H R (no. 27) for more information; cf. there, Bu-ston’s citation of Aryadeva. Thejpresent passage continues with the union of the male and female energies, and Aryadeva summarizes, “Thus he intro­spects the true forms of Prajňápáramitá and so on.” Tsofi- kha-pa’s commentary on Paňcakrama (PTT, Vol. 159, p. 75-5) treats this part of the account as illustrative of nifprapaňca- caryd. Concerning the ‘inner hearth/ Tscm-kha-pa (ibid., p. 75-3) states that the yogin “eats while contemplating a burnt offering offered to the face of the Samádhi-sattva” (tin ňe hdzin sems dpahi žal du sreg rdzas dbul pahi bsam pas bsah ste). Presumably, what the yogin now eats is the food “ divinely prepared” which the tree divinities offered earlier.Furthermore, it is in this same connection that Aryadeva cites the Mulasutra.* O n the verse as identified, the*There is no doubt that Aryadeva means the Guhyasamdjatantra (first seventeen chapters) by his citation from the ‘Mulasutra*. The verse has some variant readings of Chapter Seven, verse 2, as well as some corruptions; but also the edited Sanskrit of the Tantra has a corrupt reading in this verse. The Bendall verse has the reading ‘svam átmánam’ where the published Tantra has ‘paráňgais ca’. The Pradipoddyotana manuscript (5B-3-4) ex­pands: ‘svátmánarp paráms ca’. The Pradipoddyotana suggests that the original reading is ‘svam párárps ca’. However, by my correcting principle of adopt­ing a reading as close as possible to the edited Sanskrit when it is corrupt, I decided to correct the reading ‘paráňgais ca’ to ‘parátmánau’. The stan­dard form of the verse should therefore read:sarvakdmopabhogais tu sevyamdnair yathecchatah / suádhidaivatayogena parátmánau prapujayet //"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"3 5 6 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJATANTRAPradipoddyotana explains how one worships oneself by the praxis of one’s presiding lord, namely by the arduous ascetic practices called the twelve qualities of a purified man (dhutaguna). However, as the next Guhyasamaja verse (VII, 3) clarifies, it is by the worship and satisfaction of others, i.e. by offerings of the five deified sense objects (kamaguna), that one speedily attains Buddhahood. Aryadeva thus points to this worship of others as the way in which King Indrabhuti trar^smuted his physical body. This is also the message of Chapter V I, 2 (‘Documents’).About the vowels and the consonants in the na<jis totalling72,000, the Shags rim chen mo shows the way of conceiving them in the body. The placement of these vowels and consonants of course is done in the phase called the Stage of Generation, with the achievement of ‘m antra body’ (mantramurti). The fruition of this letter placement occurs in the Stage of Comple­tion; and this constitutes another reason for requiring the twa Stages in the given order. At f. 380b-6, Tson-kha-pa repeats the citation of some Tanjur authority, and mentions that the Sarfivarodayatanlra and other Tantras are consistent regarding the placement of the sixteen vowels :The Lord said : The wise person should contemplatethis way : A at the root of the thu'mb, A at the calf of theleg, I at the thigh joint, I at the private part (i.e. genitals), U at the root of the navel, t) at the stomach, R at the middle of the breast, R at the hand, L at the neck, L at the lip, E at the cheek, AI at the eye, O at the root of the ear, AU at the head, AM and AH in the body at the crown of the head. Such is the disposition on the ‘white side’ (left), so also on the ‘black’ (right) in reverse. This Vajrasattva is in women and also in men at all times. Notice that the name Vajrasattva is employed for a sexless (or else, androgyne) body that is the same for men and women, and is explained as a mantra-body. Hence, when AryadevaThe Bendall version substitutes deva for kama, which in this case amounts to the same meaning, because ‘all desires* means ‘all sense objects’ and these are identified with deities (deva). Again the substitution of yathdsukham for yathecchatah hardly departs from the intention. However, the Bendall reading sevyamano ought to be corrected to sevyamanair. The verse with these modifications accounts for the translation adopted previously."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III357said, “he abides with himself as the body of Vajrasattva,” the remark can apply to cither a yogin or yoginl. So also it is possible to bring in the explanation presented in Appendix II that on the Badhisattva’s Ninth Stage he sets into motion the wheel of the dharma; that is to say, in the fruitional Stage of Completion the yogin sets into motion the wheel of mantras. To continue with Tson-kha-pa’s exposition of letter placement:— The explanation of ‘white side’ as left and ‘black side’ as right (side of body), in the case A at the left thumb or right thumb, stems from the commentary on the Sarpvarodaya-tantra according to Shags rim> f. 38la-4. The Snags rim, f. 38lb-6,( mentions that the consonants are grouped under the elements, with certain consonants repeated according to the following break­down :dkaia : ka, ha, ha, na, na, ma, ha, ksa — 8wind : gha, jha, <Jha, dha (2), bha, ya(2), ¿a — 9fire : ga, ja, d a (2), da, ba, ra(2), sa — 9water : kha, cha, tha, tha, pha, va(2) — 7earth : ca, ta, ta, pa, la (2), sa — 740Those syllables are held in this tantric tradition to give rise to the thirty-two characteristics and eighty minor marks of the Buddha’s body (cf. Nidana verse 23, YA). The Sfiags rim, f.’ 380a-6, cites in this connection Dipankarabhadra’s Sriguhyasamajqmandalavidhi (known in Tibetan tradition as the Four Hundred and Fifty Verses, Bki brgya lha bcu pa) for a half-ttoka translated by indications in the commentary by Ratnakarasanti, the Srigtihyasamdjaman<jldlavidhi-tikd :I dbyahs yig mtshan dad yah dag Idan /I ka sogs dpe byad hod zer can /The (16) vowels are the source of the (32) characteristics (lakfana). The (34) consonants radiate the (80) minor marks (anuvyafijana),Shags rim. f. 380b-2, identifies the vowels as white in color, the consonants as red. The white vowels are mystically called ‘moon’; the red consonants, ‘second moon’ or ‘sun’. Ibid, f. 380b-1, by dividing the vowels into two, ore makes a ‘right’ group (for the male updya) of sixteen, and a ‘left’ group (for the female prajM), to yield the total of 32 for the characteristics."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"3 5 8 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAjATANTRALikewise, the consonants, classified as above with series adding up to 40, are divided into two for upaya and prajha to yield the total of 80 for the minor marks.The above data on the vowels requires some further clari­fication. The statement that the vowels on the ‘black’ (right) side are in reverse means, according to that above-cited com­mentary on the Sarm aro day a-tantra., that for that side one con­templates the vowel placement in the reverse order, i.e. starting from the AM and AH at the crown of the head. The vowel depositing constitutes the sixteen parts of the bodhicitta (byah chub hyi sems kyi cha bcu drug). At this point the Shags rim cites the Hevajra-tantra, Part I, Chap. viii (Snellgrove ed.) : suk- rakaro bhaved bhagavan tatsukham kaminl smrtam (50A) : “The Lord is the aspect of dukra; Kaminl is the ecstasy of that (bodhicitta).\" Thus, the Lord, or Vajrasattva, who is in both men and women, is the iukra (‘semen’) white aspect, while the Goddess Kaminl, presumably also in both men and women, is the ecstasy (sukha) red aspect of the sixteen parts of bodhicitta, yielding a total of 32 for the characteristics.Toga Stage 4 The divine body made of mindThe next problem is to determine whovis ‘the triple-diamond one’. The verse just preceding those cited by Aryadeva must be considered (Guhyasamaja, XVI, 97 :):svamudrarji va ’thava cinted dhyanatryak$aravajrinam / pancabuddhaS ca sarvajhah prinante natra sarfiSayah / /O r he should contemplate his own mudra belonging to the three-syllable vajrins of meditation.

He should give (in marriage) his ‘own mudra', the ‘Queen of the Diamond Realm’ dwelling in the heart, belonging to the ‘three-syllable vajrins’, i.e. the yogins of Vairocana and so on, who have no eye to external"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III359women.” Earlier in his commentary on Chapter X II, 76> (“Documents” ), Candraklrti explained the terms ‘Buddha*, ‘Va.jradharma’, and ‘Vajrasattva* as respectively the yogin of Vairocana, yogin of Amitàbha, and yogin of Aksobhya.Regarding those females or mudrâ-s of the verse cited by Aryadeva, namely, the goddess, nâga lady, and so on, Mchan hgrel, p. 148-2, mentions that she is the respective goddess of the three families, thus Locanâ for Vairocana’s yogin; Pânçlarà for Amitabha’s yogin; and Màmakï for Aksobhya’s yogin. ‘Knowledge of the three diamonds* means knowledge of the diamond of Body, of Speech, and of Mind. Put then, why are five females mentioned in the verse ? The Pradipoddyotana does not help here. Possibly they stand for the mudrâ-s of five different ages, usually 16-yeared; that is, I presume that they are pseudonyms of the five, the ‘butcher maiden* etc., listed under Nidâna verse GE (no. 35).W hat is meant by his going beyond ? The Pradipoddyotana manuscript explains: / atikramed ity àdinà caryâphalam âha / trivajràtmà yogi atikramet / mànusyabhàvam abhibhavati / nasyati / nàsam pràkrtam s'arïram tatparàvrttyà vajravad abhedyam aksaram avinasvaram bhavet / “By the words ‘Should he go beyond* (the verse) states the fruit of the praxis. Should the ‘triple-diamond* yogin go beyond, he would over­power the human condition. The vulgar body with ‘loss* is lost. By its transmutation, the ‘syllable* inseparable like a ‘diam ond’ would not be susceptible of destruction.” The going beyond of the ‘triple-diamond yogin’ contrasts with the going beyond of the ‘deluded self*, which is the topic of the last verse in Chapter X II and with Chapter XV, verse 22 (see Appendix II).Regarding the vidyâvrata, left in the original Sanskrit above as well as previously in my citation of verses from Chapter XVI in the opening material for the set of nidâna verses on Kâyavâk- citta (Body, Speech, and M ind), the term is well explained by Buddhaguhya in his Dhyànottara-patala-tikà (PTT, Vol. 78, p. 80-4,5 and p. 81-1). iViayâvrata'> (rite of the vidyâ) means devatà-yoga (union with divinity), especially at the sarjjdhis. Therefore, the Pradipoddyotana comments (Mchan hgrel, p. 147-4) : vidyâvratï tàbhih sàrdham guhyapüjàm samàpattim catuhsamdhyàm kuryàt (“The vidyâvratin should"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"engage in the secret-offering kind of equipoise together with those [goddesses] at the four junctures.” ) These are of course the morning, noon, sunset, and midnight observances.*It is well to point out one feature of Aryadeva’s account th at was not brought forward in our previous discussions of the Guhyasamdja yoga. He says, “ In that way, again and again he enters the true limit (bhutakofi); and having emerged again and again he experiences the five ‘strands of desire’ as the five Tathagata forms, so the (sublime) mind does not fade.” Sakyamitra says (Narthang ed., f. 345b-7) : “The true limitis the Clear Light” (yah dag pahi m thah ni hod gsal ba ste). This shows that the ultimate fruit promised for this yoga is not achieved simply by doing it once; but rather by repetition of entering into the yoga state of artificial dreamless sleep with revelation of the Clear Light, until the “ diamond body” or purified “illusory body” achieves the independence to wander “ from Buddha field to Buddha field.” Then, as Mkhas grub rje’s Fundamentals of the Buddhist Tantras suggests, the yogin is the Bodhisattva of the Tenth Stage, in the retinue of the Sam- bhoga-kaya. Still, perhaps the most significant finding of this appendix is the clear indicatior fr;om Aryadeva’s account that it is in the yoga artificial dreamless sleep that occurs the reinteg­ration of male and female energies frequently referred to as juganaddha. Hence, this is the intimation of what has been earlier referred to in this work as the Dharmakaya union with the goddess along with the Clear Light (of death). This suggests, as well, that in this theory the ordinary state of dream­less sleep (occurring every night or in each period of normal sleep) is such a reunion of male and female—mystically, death— from which comes the new life, the birth, i.e. the reawakening (see Table III, The Clear Lights). The yogin, by artificially evoking this state, seeks to capture, strengthen, and restore the androgyne.360 YOGA OF THE GUHYASAMAJ AT ANTRA*Ratnakarasanti’s Pindikria-sadhopayika-vrtti-ratndvall (PTT, Yol. 62, p. 68-5) mentions three kinds of vrata, (1) vajravrata, namely of the diamond, the “mind of enlightenment”; (2) caryavraCa, namely of three kinds of engage­ment; and (3) vidydvrata."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"APPENDIX IVPreviously (p. 163) it was noted from the Shags rim that for accomplishing the four steps of yoga there is a lesser, a middling and a great. Let us therefore, without introducing new material attem pt a grading by way of this suggestion.A. The lesser four stepsThe lesser would certainly be the four-stage yoga pointed out by Ratnakarasanti (see Appendix I) to be shared between the Lahkdvatarasutra and the Guhyasamdjatantra. He referred to a verse of Guhyasamdja, chap. XV, and I found it to be con­sistent with one way of understanding the stages of Guhyasamaja, Chap. VI. In this interpretation, the four-stage yoga is equiva­lent to the four nirvedhabhdgiyas that lead to the First Bodhisattva Stage.B. The middling four stepsThe middling would be the four stages that go with the Stage of Generation. These steps are clearly stated in Guhyasamaja, Chap. X II, and are well explained in Candraklrti’s commentary (see ‘Documents’). The steps of Guhyasamdja, Chap. VI, can be understood this way; and the four steps, considered as subjective yoga can be correlated with steps of external ritual, as was shown. Besides, the explanation of the four steps with the terminology of three samddhis is used to correlate the class of Yoga Tantra with the Stage of Generation of the Anuttara- yogatantra.C. The great four stepsThe great would be the interpretation of four stages as equi­valent to the $adahgayoga of the Stage of Completion, also ex­pressible in terms of five stages (Nagarjuna’s Pahcakrama).

XV, with the four goddesses, Locana, etc., who confer enlightenment. On the terminological level, one may further interpret the four steps of yoga of Guhyasamaja, chap. X II, as applicable to the Stage of Completion.Using Candrakirti’s classifying terminology, the lesser is shared with non-tantric Buddhism, the middling is shared by the Anuttarayogatantra with the three lower Tantras, and the great is unshared."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYA.
