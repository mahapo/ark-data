On his visits to the West in the 19705, the Sixteenth Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, recommended mahamudra because it transcends all cultural barriers. The essence of Buddhist med-itation is to tame our mind, and mahamudra practice does this through working directly with mind's nature, which is found to be the same in all living beings. Once this nature has been recognized, awareness of it is sustained in every si tuation, from medicacion sessions to all facecs of daily life. Over time, whatever arises is experienced as clear and fresh, beyond expression, and transparent to its radiant, empty nature. Woven with analogies, spontaneous song is a n atural medium for the exp ression of this ultimate reality. For this reality cannot be captured by a net of words and concepts but only indicated through the oblique lines of allusion. Metaphors have the capacity to evoke an experiential reality that transcends the intellect. and so th ey are not only a teaching tool to deepen understanding but an opening into another dimension. Saraha sang his songs to bring his listeners to enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 A SONG FOR T H E KING Thrangu Rinpoche's commentary belongs to the living oral tradition in which these verses began. Given in Colorado during the summer of 2001, his talks range from the basic points to the most subtle, all of which he has chosen for their relevance to meditacion practice. The style of presentation reflects the oral tradidon, which comes around w a wpic from different directions, allowing th is repet ition to settle an idea more deeply into our minds . The tone is close to conversational, Rowing in a timeless setting of spiritual friend and disciples. Thrangu Rinpoche based his explanations on a text by Karma Trinlepa (1456-1539), who has written the most extensive commentaries on Saraha's trilogy-his spiritual songs for the people, t he queen, and the king. A Songfor the King is the shortest of the three compositions and the most profound, for it presents in greatest detail Saraha's uniq ue interpre~ tation of mahamudci. T he eminent Kagyii scholar Pawo Tsuglak Trengwa (1504-66) wrote that the songs correspond to the three kayas, or dimen~ sions: A Song for the People relates to the nirmal).akaya; A songfor the Queen relates to the sambhogaiciya, and, finally, A Songfor the King relates w [he dharmakaya, which makes it the most subtle and succinct.3 In their Indian form, songs of realization were presented in a flow of verses without an overt structure. It was the Tibetan commentaries that added t he outlines and gave a topography to the landscape [he songs explored. In particular, Karma Trinlepa's outline is Guite detailed and could actually serve as a summary of his whole commentary. To introduce the song, lec us look at an overview. At the beginning, Karma TrinJepa uses the occasion of the traditional homage to elucidate four major obstacles w practice. This discussion functions as the tradi~ t ional preliminaries for a text or practice. Following this, he presents [he usual precis of a text, which alerts the reader to the range of its content, by dividing the verses into a summary of mahamudra, according to ground, path, and fruition. He then returns to each one of these for an extensive discussion as he builds the rest of his commentary."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 3 In the longer presentation, Saraha's verses on the ground start with his advice to keep it clear of attachment, especially to the various signs of accomplishment that might arise from practice. This is a theme that runs throughout the song, as these attachments arc t he basic way that we deviate from an authentic path. In all the major manuals on mahamudra, instructions on how to practice are followed by descrip-tions of how to avoid obstacles-all the diversions and sidetracks that lead us astray. Saraha distributes these cautions liberally throughout his song. After warning us of dangers, Saraha defines classic concepts, such as the nonduality of appearance and emptiness, and then he points out the essential nature of mind. When we are meditating, it is important to know what we are seeking, for this goal will guide the whole process of practice. Therefore, in the beginning Saraha points to ultimate reality, the fruition that is the realization of mind's very nature. Finally, he speaks about cause and effect, which constirute the level of relative truth, and about the perils of fixating on scholastic analysis. Having provided this ground, Saraha begins his mapping of the path with another series of verses on the dangers of attachment, in particular the peril of taking meditative experience to be something real and truly existent. Once this is complete, Saraha sets forth the actual path through his unique presentation of mahamudra. laid out as the four symbols or stages of practice: (I) mindfulness, (2) nonminding, (3) the unborn, and (4) beyond the intellect. In his commentary on A Songfor the People. Karma Trinlepa gives a detailed explanation of these four stages in increasingly subtle levels.· Since the third and secret one has been emphasized by Thrangu Rin-poche and prefigures the discussion in this book, it might be useful to look at it brieRy. In A Songfor the People, Saraha's verse reads:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4 A SONG FOR THE KING ... the four Stages: mindfulness, noruninding, the unborn, and beyond the intellect.

Karma Trinlepa explains that this verse indicates how to realize mind's abiding nature to be \"uncontaminated,\" which means free of mental pollution, or \"beyond the intellect,\" (he final of the four stages. The three stages leading up to this begin with mindfolnm, which Karma Trinlepa defines as a practice that cuts through the root of the mind. What this might mean is described by another master: Cutting through elaborations from without or from wi(hin-There is not only one, but many ways to teach the view. Nevertheless, just as dousing a fire naturally stops its smoke, It is more profound to CUt through the roms of your mind from within.· Here, the cutting through of mindfulness means to calm the busyness of proliferating concepts. This reins in a distracted, overactive mind and brings it into a more tranquil state. The next stage, non minding, is an extension of the first. Karma Trin~ !epa writes that to rest in a state free of mental activity is to drink the elixir of nonminding; this induces an experience in which the concepts that grasp Onto \"I\" and \"'mine\" slip from our mind. Since apprehending an \"'I\" -the actual basis for the afflictions-is no longer present, Saraha states that the mind is \"'completely purified of all afflictions.\" Thus freed,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 5 we are no longer depressed by faults o r inflated by positive qualities. The ups and downs of mat rollercoaster ride have ended. (Appendix 4, \"Some Reflections on Dran med,\" gives an extended discussion of non-minding.) Through abiding in this second stage, we come to the third, the unborn. With the aid of the key instructions, we reaJize a deeper real-ity-the unborn emptiness that the letter A embodies. This is seeing that the mind itself is forever unborn and that mis quality is aJl-perva-sive; it is the very nature of our mind and of all phenomena. Katma Trinlepa states that with the teaJization of this unborn nature, samsara is transcended. Ultimately we arrive at the fourth stage, beyond tht intellect. Karma Trinlepa explains that through the oral instructions we have practiced in the past, we have come to a realization that transcends even the name or symbol of the unborn: aJl these are liberated into a state beyond expres-sion in thought or word.1 These four stages of Saraha bear a close resemblance to the famous four yogas of mahamudrii., which also chart a path to full awakening.' Since they resonate so clearly with one another, let us look brieRy at how they interrelate and illuminate each other. The first yoga of one-pointedness has a quality of tranquility like Saraha's first stage of mindfulness, in which discursiveness is brought to rest. During the second yoga, foe of elaborations, or simplicity, all expe-rience dissolves into emptiness without leaving a trace. This resembles the second stage of nonminding when highs and lows no longer disturb our mind. During the third yoga of one taste, we realize that all phe-nomena are appearance and emptiness inseparable. In Saraha's mird stage of the unborn, we realize that our mind and all phenomena have the same nature, or embody the same taste. Everything is unborn. With the fourth yoga, nonmeditation, spontaneous presence is reached, and aJl subtle dualistic appearances utterly dissolve. This is also Saraha's fourth"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"6 A SONG FOR THE KING stage, completely beyond the intellect; it is the ultimate that transcends expresSIOn. After laying out these four stages, Saraha puts the final touches on his map of the journey to full awakening with another reminder of nonat-tachment and clear advice on how to meditate: Realize that there is noth-ing to negate, nothing to affirm, and nothing to be meditated upon. Since mere recognition brings liberation, we simply continue, \"rccog-nizingwhat is clear and unmoving.\" This will lead to the fruition offull awakening: Mind expands into vast wisdom, the five kiiyas appear, and benefits continually Row forth as the mind remains flawless and unob-suucted.

Espe-cially now, with the flourishing of Buddhism in the West, mahamudra is an even more appropriate practice than it was in [he past.

For over a thousand years, the uncommon, prac-tical instructions of the Kagyu lineage have existed in Tibetan, but until recently the barrier of language has come between Western students and mahamudra instructions. Now, through the diligent effort of Western students, major texts from the lineage have been translated and made available.9 These texts are eminencly p ractical and not cryptic or inac-cessible. They provide appropriate solutions and responses to the vari-ous types of experiences, both positive and negative, that might appear in our practice. With these new translations, we now have the necessary resources for understanding mahamudrii. practice. Saraha's Song for the King belongs to the lineage of mahamudra instruction, which comes to us in two ways: through a long lineage and a short one. The short or dose lineage, which is better known, begins with the dharmakaya Vajradhara and passes on [0 Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, and others. 10 The long lineage, which is found in many lineage supplications, also begins with Vajradhara and then goes to the bodhi-s~ttv~ R~rmmMj, the m~h:isiclclh~ S~r.:Ih~, NagJirjllm, ~ncl other.~, even-tually down to Marpa.\" Saraha is an important link in this long lineage of mahamudra instructions, which continues unbroken down to th e present day."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"APPROACHING MAHAMUORA II Many of the composi£ions of the Indian mahasiddhas have been scat-tered because they are separate, short texts, and therefore many have been lost. But due to the kindness of (he Seventh Gyalwang Karmapa, Ch6drak Gyatso, the Indian so urces for the mahamudra teachings have been preserved. He collected all of these compositions inca three vol-umes, which he titled Indian Sourw of Mahamudrii. They include the Buddha's original mahamudra teachings, found in the tantras, plus the oral instructions and spirirual songs composed by the mahasiddhas, such as this one by Saraha. Because of Ch6drak GyatsO, the lineage of read-ing transmissions and explanations of mahamudra has not disappeared, and now there is no danger of them being lost in the future. His Holi-ness the Sixteenth Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, bestowed the read-ing transmission of these three volumes at R umtek Monastery, and I had the good foTtune to receive this transmission in its e ntirety. The Life of Saraha Saraha was born into the Brahmin caste and became a Buddhist monas-tic named R.i.hulabhadra. He was a very influential and highly respected teacher of Buddhism within the monastic tradi£ion, enjoying the patron-age, devotion, and faith of a king and his subjects. Then one day, while still engaged in teaching and practice, Saraha encountered a wisdom ~ikini who appeated in the form of a woman from a very low caste. At that time in India, social class and caste were considered of great impor-tance. This woman was an arrow maker, and Saraha encountered her at a crossroads where she was making arrows. When Saraha saw this woman putting the feathers on an arrow, he noticed mat lihe was doing it in a way that was extremely concentrated, not looking to the right or left but one-pointedly working on the arrow. The shaft had three segments and Saraha watched her cut off th e base as well as the tip and split the base into four, where she tied a pebble in place. At"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 A SONG FOR THE KING the tip she placed the arrowhead and at the base she placed four feathers. Saraha addressed her, saying, \"Are you making an arrow?\" In reply she said, \"Son of noble family, the realizations of all buddhas are unders[Qod through skillful methods and indications, not through words and writing.\" It dawned on Saraha that she must be a 4akini and that what she said was a symbolic indication for him [Q understand. This is what he under-stood. The three segments of the shaft symbolized the three lciyas of the dharmakiya, sambhogakaya, and nirmal).akaya. Cutting off the root symbolized cutting off cyclic existence at its very origin, and cutting off the tip of the shaft symbolized the severing of ego-clinging. Furthermore, he unders[Qod that placing the arrowhead onto the shaft symbolized wisdom and that dividing the base inro four symbolized the four aspects of mahamudra practice: mindfulness, nonminding, the unborn, and beyond the intellecLll Placing the pebble into these four splits and tying it with a string symbolized unifying method and wisdom (Skt. upayaand prajiial through the practice of calm abiding and deeper insight (Skt. famatha and vipafyan5). Inserting the four feathers sym-bolized the four aspects of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. Saraha understood the straightening of the arrow as following the straight path from the very beginning. The woman closed one eye and opened the other while checking the straightness of the arrow. This sym-bolized closing the eye of dualistic mind while opening the eye of wis-dom. At the moment when Saraha fully realized the state of mahamudra, he exclaimed \"da.\" This is a play on the sound of this word, which can mean either \"arrow\" or \"symbol.\"u He sa id , \"You are not an arrow maker. You are a symbol maker.\" From that point onward Saraha changed his lifestyle from that of a monk to that of a siddha. He began to travel around with her and practice the Dharma. By living with her rather than being a celibate monk, Saraha greatly dis-appointed the king and his subjects. So to convince Saraha to return to a more conventional monastic lifestyle, the king sent a group of his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"APPROACHING MAHAMUDRA 13 subjects to ask Saraha to behave properly. Saraha's response to their request was what is known as A Songfor the People, which is the first of the three great spiritual songs, or dohas, sung by Saraha in the vernacu-lar of somhern India. A Song for the People is the longest of the three songs, comprising one hundred sixty verses of instruction in mabamudr.i Through hearing Saraha's teaching, the people sent by the king all devel-oped great realization and stopped asking Saraha to behave. When they returned [0 the court, the king observed that they had been unsuccess~ fu.!, so he decided [0 send a second deputation, which was made up of the queen and her retinue of servants. They [00 asked Saraha to behave, and his response was the second spiritual song, A Songfor the Queen, in eighty verses. In response to this teaching, the queen and her retinue, like the people before, attained authentic realization, stopped pestering Saraha, and returned to the court. Observing that both the people and the queen had been unsuccessful, the king decided to go personally and ask Saraha to mend his ways. Saraha's response to the king's petition was A Songfor the King. It consists offorty stanzas, and upon hearing it, the king imme~ diately attained supreme siddhi, or full awakening. A Song for the King The literature of mahamudra consists of Indian spiritual songs, such as the Three Spiritual Songs of Saraha, the Ganges Mahamudra ofTiiopa, and many similar songs of realization by Tibet's great masters, such as Marpa and Milarepa. There are also Tibetan commentaries on mahamudra, among them The Ocean of Definitive Meaning by the Ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje. The commentaries and spiritual songs reRect the same outlook, present essentially the same material, and have the same meaning. But these two sources of mahamudra are quite different in how they present their subject. The commentaries give a systematic and clear presentation of mahamudra instructions from"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 A SONG FOR THE KING the very beginning of the path up to its end. By contrast, the spiritual songs are not systematic and sequential, as they are usually sung when a mahasiddha develops realization and spontaneously expresses that real-ization through the bliss of the realization itself. Spiritual songs are more an expression of personal realization than a systematic presentation of the path. For example, in The Ocean of Definitive Meaning you will find a gradual presentation starting with how to practice tranquility meditation and then, upon mastering this, how to practice insight meditation, and so on. Usually spiritual songs do not present the path in such a sequen-tial manner. Therefore, in studying the spiritual songs, which are both poetic and cryptic, we need the support of the great texts ofinstruction, even though the essential meaning of all of the instruction is still found in the songs themselves. The one I am using is The Middle-Length Com-mentary on ~ Song for the King\" by Karma Triniepa,lo who was the teacher of the Eighth Gyalwang Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje. Karma Trinlepa wrote commentaries on aJi three of Saraha's spiritual songs. In A songfor the King, mahamudra is taught in three aspects: ground, path, and fruition. This spiritual song answers the questions: What is the ground or basis of mahamudra practice? What is the path or process of this practice? What is the result or goal of this practice In this song, the ground is how things really are. I S From this perspective, the way that we experience ordinary appearances is confused. These mundane or samsaric appear-ances refer to how things appear. But what are they really? How are things in their abiding or true nature? In other words, what lies behind the con-fused appearances of phenomena? It must be this true nature, recognized as the very excellence of this ground, which makes the path of mahamudrii possible. So the first subject of our text is an explanation of the founda-tion.of mahamudra-what is to be realized, or how things really are. The path to realizing mahamudra is path mahamudrii. And finally, the culmi-nation of that path is fruition mahamudrii., the state of full realization. A Song for the King is structured along these lines of ground, path, and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"APPROACHING MAHAMUDRA I5 fruition. In the beginning, it gives a brief presentation of all three aspects, and then they are presented extensively using numerous analogies. The Meaning of Mahamudra The Sanskrit term mahamudci was translated by mahasiddhas and great translators into Tibetan as chaggya chen pO.16 Looking at the literal mean-ing of the Tibetan translation can be useful in understanding what mahamudci is all about. When a symbolic etymology'] or explanation of chaggya chen po is given, it is said that chagrepresenrs great emptiness, and gya represents nondual wisdom. On first glance, this is somewhat cryptic, because there is no obvious connection between the Tibetan word chagand emptiness, nor between the Tibetan word gya and nondual wisdom. In common usage, the word chag is an honorific term for someo~e's hand, and the term gya means either \"vast\" as an adjective or \"seal\" as a noun. However, if we look at the word chagcarefully, the first thing we see is that this word is used a lot in Tibetan. For example, the word for \"salutation\" or \"prostration\" is chag tsal wa.'8When we speak of the Buddha's hand, we use the honorific word chag rather than the ordinary word lag pa. The honorific is used for anyone else whom we esteem, such as teachers, mon-archs, and ministers. Nevertheless, the word chag has anomer usage. When it is not used as an honorific for hand, it has the connotation of \"clean\" or \"cleansing.\" For example, a broom is also called a chag ma,l? which liter-ally means a cleanser. The reason chag, which has the connotation of cleansing, is the honorific form for hand is that whatever comes from the hand of budd has or mahasiddhas, such as their writings and their actions, has the primary function of cleansing, purifYing, or removing the misery and obscurations ofliving beings. Returning to me idea of great emptiness, it is now possible to see a connection between the word chagand the state of emptiness. All things are empty in their nature. Not recognizing this, we suffer and experience samsara. If this emptiness is recognized, that very"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"16 A SONG FOR THE KING recognition cleanses or removes all suffering. It is emptiness and the recog-nition of emptiness that cleanses us of suffering. In sum, the deeper expla-nation for the word chag is \"great emptiness,\" which purifies our suffering. The second syllable gya usually means either \"that which is vast\" or \"a seal.\" The connection between the idea of a seal and the idea of vastness is that of an imprint. For example, a handprint nm only depicts the hand, but it also shows the extenr of the hand. So the extent or imprint of something shows what that thing fills or pervades. The second sylla-ble, therefore, points out the fact that while emptiness is indeed the nature of all phenomena, emptiness is not a voidness: it is simultaneously nondual wisdom. In mher words, emptiness itself has an innate aspect of lucidity.w The second syllable indicates that emptiness is an expanse of wisdom, or one could say, emptiness is pervaded with wisdom. Finally. the third word is the twO syllables of chen po, which means \"great.\" It points to the und~rstanding that this expanse of wisdom, which is empti-ness, is great in being all-pervasive. In this way, it is quite clear that mahamudra is concerned with med-itation on emptiness as taught by the Buddha. But when we use the te rm emptiness, we may understand it in different ways. We may see emptiness as something positive or as something negative-an absence of experience and thought. an uner lack of qualities, or a state of absolute nothingness. That. however. is not what emptiness is, because it also contains an inherent lucidity. Since emptiness is at the same time great wisdom, it is the root of all that is beneficial. One could say that this emptiness is the potential and source of all wisdom that knows the true nature of phenomena. Therefore, while the nature to be realized is emptiness, that nature itself possesses inherent lucidity or wisdom. The instructions for realizing this true nature, including its inherent wis-dom, constitute what we call mahamudra."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Song Begins ~ 2 Now WE TURN to Saraha's song, which is explained in the tradi~ tional manner, beginning with the title and the homage of the translator.

The title ''A Song for the King\" was added by the Tibetan translators fol-lowing the narrative of how the three songs arose. The first was \"A Song for the People,\" the second, \"A Song for the Queen,\" and the third, ''A Song for the King.\" The word doha can be translated as \"song of attain-ment\" or \"song of experience. \" Z!

This homage is the first part of the song that was actually composed by Samba. \"The one who has vanquished the power of the maras\" can be understood as referring [Q mahamudrii itself, which has the power to con-quer or remove the maras. In colloquial language, the term miiras refers [Q external demons that try to tempt one in various ways. But according to the Buddhist tradition, miira in its fundamental sense refers to a fac-tor that brings about suffering for oneself and others; in ocher words, it is anything that causes unhappiness and suffering. There are four types of maras. The first is called klefa-miira, which means the \"mara of afHic-tions.\" We have within us three major afflictions, or disturbing emotions: ignorance, attachment, and aversion. The five affiictions are these three plus jealousy and greed. They all create a great deal of suffering, for when they are present in a person, they can cause further suffering in others. They are the root of everything that keeps us in samsara, and therefore these disturbing emO[ions need to be conquered. h is the practice of mahiimudrii that is the best way to achieve liberation from samsara. We also possess the five aggregates ofform, sensation, perception, for-mation, and consciousness. These constitute the second mara, the skandha-miira, or the mara of the aggregates. Because they are compos-ite, the aggregates change and fall apart, and in this shifting and disin-tegradon, they form an intrinsic part of sam sara's cycle. For example, at the end of the nvelve links of interdependent origination, which trace how samsara arises and ceases, it is said that from birth comes aging and death. From that come suffering, lamenting, and all manner of misery. In short, the aggregates are the proximate condition for the arising of suf-fering. Their falling apart and changing lead directly to suffering; there-fore, to go beyond suffering, we must transcend them."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 19 The third mara is called mrryupati-miira, or the Lord of Death, who is depicted as a wrathful and terrifying demon representing death itself, the end of a given life. It is also is something we need to move beyond in the sense of not being prey to the fear of death. If we practice medi-tation on mahamudra and realize the nature of our mind, we will have control over our rebirth and will not fear death. It is mahamudra that finally conquers the Lord of Death. These three maras are also depicted iconographically. The mara of the afRictions is presented as a Brahmin. The mara of the aggregates is depicted as someone afRicted with extreme old age and infirmity. The mara of the Lord of Death is depicted as the terrifying demon of death, Yamanraka. The practice of Dharma frees us from these three maras. The fourth mara is what obstructs the practice of Dharma and pre-vents us from becoming free of these first three maras. h is called droa-putra-miim, or the mara of the child of the gods. A child of the gods sounds delightful. and this mara is depicted as a very attractive person wearing beautifuJ jewelry and clothing. It is actually all desirable things-what is pleasing to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and touch. But thei r attractiveness is not the problem; it is our craving for and fixation on these pleasures and desirable states that prevents us from conquering the other three maras. To summarize, there are four mams to be conquered or transcended. In moving beyond them, we achieve liberation from sam sara and [he fuiJ manifestation of OUf spontaneously present wisdom. Here, in the author's homage, mahamudra is p raised because it conquers all four maras and thereby brings about liberation and omniscience.

In the beginnjng, these three aspects of mahamudra are"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"20 A SONG FOR THE KING presented very concisely; in later verses, they are presented extensively. This section encompasses the first brief presentation of ground, path, and fruidon. We begin with ground mahamudra, which has three sec-tions: abandoning attachment, developing positive qualities, and under-standing what to take up and what to reject. Ultimate truth-the true nature of things, or dharmata-never changes. Within it, there is no change or fluctuation, and this is referred to as emptiness. It is for this reaso n the Heart Surra states that there is no form, no sound, no smell, and so fonh . .!J Emptiness is the nature of the ground itself, but we do not experience things as being empty. We experience objects, such as trees or people, in the way they appear to us, as more or less solid things. Therefore, we may doubt that all phenom-ena are empty. If the nature of things is emptiness, then why are there appearances? The answer to this question is dealt with in the next sec-tion of the song. In his Songofthe Se/fArisen Nature, the first jamgon Kongtriil Lodro Taye also gives an explanation of the ground, path, and fruition of mahamudci.H H e explains that ground mahamudrii has to do with the nature of things and with how we confuse phenomena. This means there are twO aspects ro an explanation of ground mahamudra: the way things actually are and the way in which confusion arises. What we need ro realize in our meditation is how things really are, the true nature of phe-nomena. At present, we do not experience phenomena as they really are but know them in a confused or incorrect manner. While the nature of everything is emptiness, we do not experience things as empty but as var-ious rather solid appearances. So we need to understand what these mis-perceptions are and how they arise. The first three verses give the b rief p resentation of ground mahamudra. What do we mean by ground? We wish ro achieve libera-rion from suffering and the bewildered appearances of samsara, and the reason we can free ourselves is due to the fact that these phenomena are"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 1.1 temporary or adventitious appearances coming from our confusion.1s Another way to say [his is that they do nor truly exist as they appear. If we understand this, men we understand something about me foundation of liberation, which is ground mahamudri. From that poinr of view, the path of mahamudm is the process of eradicating bewilderment and bewjJ-dered appearances. When all bewilderment or confusion has been e1im-inared and, thereby, all the innate qualities of the ground are revealed, we have reached fruition mahamudri. How D elusive Appearances Arise within the Ground I. Just as when the wind blows And still water is turned into moving waves, So the appearing Sarma is JUSt one, Yet me king creates diverse appearances. The first verse of the song concerns the confused way we perceive phe-nomena, which is presented th rough an analogy of water and waves: \"Just as when the wind blows and still water is turned into moving waves .... \" There is no substantial d ifference between water and the waves that arise on its surface; the waves have no existence separate from the water itself. Nevertheless, with the presence of the wind, waves appear as distinct entities or manifestations of the water. In the same way, due to the presence of confusion (the wind), appearances (the waves) arise in our experience. These projections of our bewilderment are nonexistent appearances; they are of themselves norhing other than the manifestation of our confusion. The meaning of this analogy can be applied to all phenomena and in particular to the mind, which is, after all, the principal focus of mahamudra. It is within the mind that the resolution of the nature of mings is gained. The mind itself, however, has"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 A SONG FOR THE KING no form, color, shape, o r any other substantial characteristic, and yet thoughts continuously arise. These thoughts that appear within the mind have no existence apart from the mind. They partake of no nature other than that of the mind itself, and yet they appear as distinct objects or events. The point of this analogy of water and waves is to explain how phe~ nomena appear within the dharmadhatu (the expanse of all phenom~ ena), which is another name for the nature of the mind. From the perspective of mind itself, the analogy explains how thoughts arise as the display of mind's own nature. From the perspective of phenomena in general, the analogy shows how the nature of phenomena arises as the appearance of various things. The second twO lines of the first verse employ a different analogy, related to the immediate situation in which Saraha is singing the song. In response to the presence and petition of t he king, Saraha observes, \"So the appearing Saraha is just one, yet the king creates diverse appear~ ances.\" This means that wh ile Saraha remains one person, the king has diverse perceptions of him. When he th inks about Saraha's caste, he perceives Saraha as a Brahmin. Sometimes he sees him as a great pa':H~ita, because Saraha was an eminent Buddhist scholar. Sometimes he sees Saraha as a monastic, because Saraha had received monastic ordination. Finally, since Saraha had broken caste and monastic codes by consorting with the arrow maker, he also sees Saraha as a degener~ ate yogi. But in £act, there is only one Saraha. It is the king's perception, or his projection, that sees all of these manifestations of Saraha as dis~ tinct persons. I n the same way, while there are no distinctions within the expanse of the dharmadhatu, we nevertheless perceive a variety of phenomena. So through two analogies, this first verse on the ground of mahamudra shows that confused p rojections come about: while the ground of appearances is emptiness, within that ground bewildered appearances arise."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 23 How Subject and Object Appear to Be Separate 2. The ignorant press their eyes16 And see one lamp as two. Like this, in mind's nature where seer and seen are not twO, Alas! The mind appears as two things. The first verse showed the presence of aUf confusion, and this second verse specifies how this confusion comes about. Confusion, or false view, arises because we perceive things in a dual way that brings up the perceived object and the perceiving subject. We have an incorrect belief in [he dualism that posits an object of experience and a subject that experiences it. Bewilderment, therefore, is not just mere bewilderment; it is double bewilderment because neither subject nor object ultimately exists. Take the example of an experience of the senses. When you see something, you assume that the external object exists as an object and that it also exists as a subjective thought, or perception, within the mind. We experience the mind as an experiencing mental conscious-ness, and we experience objects as being within the mind and able to be experienced. However, the objects of mental consciousness are gen-eralized abstractions,27 resemblances of actual sense experience. They arise as generic images within the mind and are accompanied by lin-guistic abstractions.z, These are mistakenly perceived as being inher-endy linked to the objects to which they refer. In fact, the object of experience has no inherent connection to the linguistic label that the mind applies to it. The falseness of believing in the existence of subject and object is explained in th is second verse, which presents the situation of seeing something double, because we are rolling our eyes back or pressing on them. If we squeeze our eyes and look at a lamp, we will see twO lamps. We cannot say that we do nOt see two lamps, because we acmally do see"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 A SONG FOR THE KING two lamps. At the same time, we know there are not really two lamps there. The dual lamps are an optical illusion created by our pressing on our eyes. In the same way, when we experience phenomena, even though there is no subject and no object, because of our ignorance (the pressure on our eyes), our experience is divided into two. Seeing two lamps instead of one is an analogy for what we do when we divide our mind into the one that perceives things and the apparent external things. In its true nature, the mind is not divisible into subject and object, just as there are not two lamps when the eyes are pressed. It is because we perceive the mind as divided into subject and object that we perceive incorrectly. So Saraha says, \"Alas!\" It is a shame that we see things in a way they are not. The nrst verse showed that while the nature of all phenomena is emptiness, through our ignorance, the whole variety of phenomena arise JUSt as waves arise in a body of water. With the analogy of the two lamps, the second verse explains how this incorrect belief arises through the dualistic perception of subject and object. Taken together, these first two stanzas describe the nacure of confusion as seeing what does not exist. The nature of all perceived phenomena is emptiness, utter peace and perfection. This emptiness is also lucidity and the space for the unlim-ited possibility of manifestation. It is the nature of the perceiving mind, yet we do not normally see it. Our ignorance has two aspects: We do nO[ see what actually exists (emptiness), and we see what does not really exist (the duality). This empty nature of the mind and phenomena is not, however, a voidness because it is pervaded by wisdom. Due to its lucidity, empti-ness has the inherent capacity to manifest appearances. We might then ask. Why do we not see this nature of emptiness as it really is? The first twO verses answer this question by demonstrating how we see what is not there. The third verse is concerned with how we do not see whac is there."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 25 Primordial Wisdom Pervades the World 3. Though many lamps are lit throughout the house, Those with no eyes to see remain in darkness. Like this, though spontaneous wisdom is all-pervasive and nearby, For the ignorant it is far, far away. The third stanza presents the analogy of a sightless person in a well-illuminated place. If we were to light many lamps in a room that was dark, anyone who could see would be able to perceive things in the room. But if someone were sightless, the illumination of the lamps would have no effect and the person would continue to see nothing. This is an anal-ogy for the way ignorance prevents us from seeing things as they are. The fundamental nature, found within each and every being, is spon-taneously p resent wisdom. This wisdom is \"all-pervasive and nearby.\" It is all-pervasive because it is present within every being without excep-tion. It is nearby because it is ou r own nature, not distant or inaccessi-ble to us. This wisdom, also called the sugatagarbha or buddha nature, is definitely within us, but we do not detect it because ignorance has obscured our seeing of it. And so, in thinking about our buddha nature, we tend to conceive of it as something very difficult to obtain and far away, even though it is our own nature. This ignorance in nor recognizing our own nature is the source of all our problems and our suffering. To realize our own nature is the fruition of the path, the aHainment of buddhabood. To make clear what this result is, it might be helpful to look at the Tibetan word for the Buddha, which is sang gye. The first syllable, sang, means \"to cleanse or remove\" and refers ro the remnv::al nfignnr::anr.e. What is meant hy the removal of ignorance? Imagine that you ate dreaming and in your dream you drive somewhere, get into a bad accident, and are seriously injured. What do you really need to get rid of this pain and suffering? No"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 A SONG FOR THE KING amount.of medical treatment or vehicle repair will actually help this sit-uation, because the whole time you are safely asleep in your bed, The only remedy that will actually get rid of your suffering is the recognition that you are just dreaming and no accident has occurred. As soon as you realize this, your suffering will disappear. This example illustrates that the elimination of our ignorance is simply removal, or sang. The second syllable, gy~, means \"expanded\" or \"blossomed.\" When ignorance is removed, appearances caused by it cease, and, consequently, there is no fear. There is no need ro do anything, because our innate wisdom, which was always there, is simply and fully revealed. This rev-elation of our innate wisdom is what gy~, or blossomed, refers to. Attain-ing the fruition of the path does not involve going somewhere we have never been or receiving something from someone else. Fruition is noth-ing other than the recognition of our own true nature. If we wake from sleep, the dream will dissolve and we will experience the relief of being safe in the bed of our true nature. The method through which we achieve this awakening is called the three vehicles of Buddhist practice. We could define these three vehicles as the simple explanation, the more profound explanation, and the pro-foundest explanation. The flrst vehicle is the Foundational Vehicle, which explains how the cause of our suffering is the accumulation of karma, motivated by the disturbing emotions. If we wish to end our negative karma, we need to eliminate the disturbing emotions. Accord-ing to the Foundational Vehicle, these begin with the false perception of self and other. When we believe in these, we begin to believe in a self. By fixating on it, all our disturbing emotions arise. We may, for example, develop an anachment to anything that gratifies the self and develop an aversion row:'In:1 :lnyrhing th:lt is llnrle:'l.~:lnt or that threatens the self. This attachment leads straight into the disturb-ing emotions of desire and aggression. Unfortunately, we cannot give up fixation on a self simply by thinking, \"Now I will give up this"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 27 fixation.\" The only way to give it up is to recognize the nature of the ground, which is the nonexistence of the self. In mahamudra, we do this through a technique called lookingfor the self. We ask, What is my body? Where is my body? and so forth. Through questioning, we dis-cover that this \"I\" that seems so solid and real, like something that endures from birth to death, has actually never existed. When we finally recognize the nonexistence of the self, our fixation on it naturally van-ishes and thereby our suffering also ends. In sum, the principal object of meditation in the Foundational Vehicle is the meditation on the selfless-ness of persons, and through it, the fruition of this vehicle is achieved. In the second vehicle, the Mahayana or Greater Vehicle, we firs[ understand that all phenomena are empty, meditate on this fact, and finally realize it. This realization will bring to an end all confused appear-ances and the suffering of samsara they engender. In the Mahayana path, the ground is the emptiness of all phenomena, and an understanding of emptiness is developed through inferential valid cognition. Using logi-cal arguments such as one and many and so on, l~ we determine that all things are merely collections of aggregates and therefore lack true exis-tence. These logical arguments develop an intellectual understanding of emptiness, but they are very difficult to meditate on, and this makes the Mahayana a very long path. It is for (his reason the sutras say that buddhahood can only be achieved through three innumerable eons of gathering the accumulations of merit and wisdom. It is the difficulty of refining this conceptual certainty of emptiness that makes for such a long path. The third vehicle, the Vajrayana, includes the profound path of maha-mudra and reveals the ground in a different way. Especially in maha-mudra meditation, the ground is not revealed through a logical analysis of external phenomena. r n fact, whether trees, houses, and rocks are empty or not empty is nOt the main problem. The main problem and the cause of our suffering is our mind with its mistaken assumptions of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 A SONG FOR THE KING solidity-its misapprehensions based on what seems to be real experi-ence. As the sutras state, \"Taming one's mind is me Buddha's teaching.\" All appearances arise in our mind, and so we make two basic asswnptions: that our mind is solid and substantially existent and mat external phe-nomena must be solid and existent as well because we experience them. Since it is our own mind, we can look into it directly without look-ing at anything else. For example, we normally assume that our mind, like everything else, is seated somewhere in particular. We should then ask, Is our mind located in our head or in our hean, or somewhere between our head and feet? If we think our mind is located in a specific place, exactly where is it? When we look for a specific location of the mind, we cannot find it. Then we might think that even if the mind has no location, if it exists, Sutely it must have some kind of substantial characterisric. We should then ask, Does the mind have a shape? Is it round or triangular? and so on. When we look for irs shape, we find nothing. When we look for its color, again we find nothing. In fact, when we look for any kind of substantial characteristics, we cannot find anything. Now when we look at mind, we are not engaged in logical analysis. We are not drawing inferences about the mind and determining what it must logically be. Looking at mind is direct observation. We can directly observe our own mind simply because it is our own mind. And when we do so, we don't find anything. You might ask, Is it that we don't find any-thing because we didn't look hard enough or know how to look at the mind? Is it because the mind exists but it is so small that it can't be seen? Is it because the mind is perfectly transparent, like water, and we see through it and miss it? The answer is that we don't find the mind because the mind is empty. As the Buddha said, \"All things are empty.\" The three verses we looked at previously were primarily concerned wim describing the manner in w~ich we are confused. They illusrrated how our confused perception sees things as existing while they actually"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 29 don't exist. Second, in our confusion, we see something that actually exists as not existing. This first confusion is not recognizing the ground as actually being empty, and the second confusion is not recognizing that emptiness itself possesses inherent wisdom. While explaining how our confusion or ignorance arises, the verses also point our that the true nature of reality, the ground itself, is the unity of emptiness and lucidity. A Brief Presentation of Path Mahamudra A Songfor the King turns here to a brief presentation of the path. The path is possible because ignorance by its very nature is false or incor-rect. In other words, it is possible for the ocean to be calmed because the waves (ignorance) are not intrinsic to the ocean; the ocean is not necessarily made up of JUSt waves. Since seeing two lamps comes from pressing on our eyes, when we Stop doing it, we will no longer see two lamps and will see things as they are. In a similar way, we do not see the true nature of phenomena; nevertheless, the true nature is. there and we simply fail [0 see it. It is possible to eliminate confused appearances and discover the direct experience of the true nature. If the ground were inherently defective, there would be nothing we could do to change it. But since the ground itself does not consist of confused experiences, our ignorance can be removed and the ttue nature can be realized. The methods employed in the tradition of the sutras and the tantras differ from each other. In the sutra path, one is mainly concerned with the true nature of all things, which is emptiness. Therefore, the focus of the sutra path is very vast, and we attempt to prove to ourselves that the nature of all phenomena without exception is emptiness. Whether we talk about the expanse and the emptiness of all things or the lucidity and wisdom of all t hings, they are indeed aU-pervasive according to the sutras: emptiness is the nature of all phenomena without exception. It"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30 A SONG fOR THE KING is quite possible to prove logically to ourselves that everything is empti-ness, bur it is comparatively difficult w meditate on these logical argu-ments using the sutra approach. In the practice of tantra, the focus is nOt as vast. Tanua is more concerned with profundity than with vastness, and therefore within the teachings, it is called the aspect of profundity. These instructions are not princi pally concerned with the empty nature of all phenomena, because it is not the emptiness of phenomena that poses the principal problem for us. Our problem stems from our mind. Everything we experience-delight or depression, regret or guilt, sad-ness or happiness, enthusiasm, faith, or compassion-is rooted within our mind. We can analyze the nature of phenomena in the greatest detail, but it would still be very difficult to experience this emptiness directly. Within [antra, however, emptiness can be experienced directly through its principal practice of looking directly at our own mind. Whether we look at the mind itself or at the thoughts that arise as the mind's display, we can quickly and directly experience that mind is the manifestation of dharmatii (reality itself). Why is this so? While the nature of mind is the same as dharmatii, it is not evidem in the experience of external objects; it is, however, evident in (he experience of our own mind. When the mind is scrutinized, we see that is has no shape, form, or color because it is empty. When we recognize this, we begin a process that wil! eventually culminate in the elimination of all our suffering. Even in the short term, this looking at the mind alleviates mental suf-fering. This is why we meditate on the mind. We might ask, If we are concerned with the mind alone, why do we need to think about the view or the ground? We need the view because we must understand why we meditate. We do not meditate simply because it feels good or because we want to have great experiences. Nor do we meditate JUSt because we want to feel peaceful and tranquil. We meditate because through meditation, it is possible to utterly elim-inate from the mind all of our disturbing emotio ns. The purpose of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 31 meditation is to achieve complete elimination of the mind's afflictions. We meditate because our mind is innately capable of being utterly at peace, completely free of disturbing emotions, and also perfectly insightful and discerning. We meditate to cleanse our mind. We do suffer from ignorance, but this confusion is temporary, since it is secondary [Q the mind's nature and not an intrinsic part of it. If we purify the mind through the prac~ tice of meditation, this ignorance can be removed. Further, since this ignorance is not fundamental to it, the mind does not disappear when the ignorance is removed. Our experience does not stop, nor is it super-seded by a state of annihilation or nothingness. The qualities of the Buddha include the omniscient wisdom of the nature of phenomena and the wisdom of the variety of phenomena. The seed of this wisdom is innate to our mind, and we meditate in order to achieve it. The path in general is a process that gradually transcends the confused appearances of samsara and culminates in their elimination. This is referred to as the fruition of the path. The path is usually presented as successive stages, like traveling from one place to another. Here, however, the song points out that the path does not truly consist of going from one state to another; it is more like returning to the original nature that we have failed to realize. By relinquishing bewilderment and confusion, we discover that nature. Since they are not intrinsic to the true nature of mind, the nature itself does not change: there is no real moving from one place, or one state, to another. We merely return to what was always there and see it without confusion or veils of ignorance. The path has two aspects. The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, wrote in his Aspiration Prayer of Mahamudra: \"The meaning of the ground is the twO truths beyond the extremes of permanence and anni-hilation.\" This means th at we should recognize that the ground is beyond two exrremes: the permanence of real existence and the annihi-lation of absolute nonexistence. The Third Karmapa continues: \"The"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"}2 A SONG FOR THE KING supreme path is the unity of the two accumulations, beyond the extremes of superimposition or denial.\" Superimposition and denial are ways of incorrectly understanding the nature of phenomena, that is, to have an incorrect perception of the ground. When we believe that some-thing that does nO[ actually exist does exist, that is the error of exagger-ation. When we believe that something that actually does exist does nO[ exist, that is the error of denial. Tht: path, du:rt:furt:, is Lilt: process of coming to see the ground as it is, free of these twO extremes. Seeing the ground as it actually is has two aspects called the twO accu-mulations: the conceptual accumulation of merit and the nonconceptual accumulation of wisdom. The accumulation of wisdom is the process of developing a correct view that understands the ground and then con-tinuing to meditate upon it. Of the two accumulations, this noncon-cepmal accumulation of wisdom is central and can only occur undet the right conditions. The accumulation of merit, which involves con-cepts, is necessary to create the right conditions for the accumulation of wisdom, which transcends concepts. This gathering of merit can be done physically, verbally, or mentally, and it will facilitate and enhance our accumulation of wisdom. The path, therefore, consists of the integration of these twO aspects. This third verse discussed the nature of the path. The next verse in this brief presentation of the path uses three analogies to show why we can achieve realization by following the path. The Wisdom Realizing Emptiness Purifies Ignorance f. Though diverse, rivers are one in the ocean. Though myriad, lies are overcome by a single tTUth. Though darkness is manifold, The rising of a single sun clears it away."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 33 The first of the three analogies refers to rivers: \"Though diverse, rivers are one in the ocean~ means that a1l rivers eventually flow into the ocean. This analogy points to the fact that we undergo a wide variety of expe-riences produced by ignorance. Yet rhese myriad states of happiness and sadness, in their almost infinite variations, all have the same fundamen-tal nature. Therefore, through the pursuit of one path, any confusion, no matter how vast or various, can be resolved. The second analogy concerns lies and the truth: \"Though myriad, lies are overcome by a single truth.\" This illustrates that no matter how many lies are told about something, once the truth is revealed, all those lies, even hundreds of them, are disproved and revealed as false. In one sense this example is an analogy, and in another sense it is a statement about the nature of confusion and realization. Whatever our ignorance and whatever our many varieties of confused appearances may be, jf the true nature of phenomena is realized, then all our confusion can be removed, because ultimately it is false. In other words, realization of reality's truth is overcomes all possible misperceptions about the nature of reality. From the perspective of the vast sutra path, this means that through meditation on dharmata, confused and incorrect appearances can be effaced. From the perspective of the profound tantra, this means that through meditation on the nature of the mind, ignorance can be grad-ually eradicated. What is especially significant here is that the path has an effect: it actually brings us to fruition by eliminating ignorance. The third analogy is of the sun and darkness: \"Though darkness is manifold, the rising of a single sun dears it away.\" No matter how dark a place is, no maHer how vast an area darkness covers, and no matter how long it has been dark. once the sun shines upon it. the darkness is eliminated in an instant. This illustrates the relationship between what is true (the sun) and what is false (the darkness).

In this fourth verse, Saraha states that based on his realization and experience, there is no doubt that [he path of mahamudra can remove ignorance. He asserts this to assure his disciples that it is possible, mereby encouraging them to pursue the path. To follow any path and move from one place to another, we need a map, which is based on people hav-ing actually traveled on that path. For example, if we want to go from one cit}' to another, we have to make sure that we know how to get there so we will nor take the wrong road and get lost. To prevent th is, we usu-ally obtain a set of directions or a map. Looking at it , we learn what local roads we need to take in order to get to the right highway. In mahamudra, we use a map that was produced by generation after gen-eration of mahasiddhas, all of whom began exactly like us, in a state of ordinary bewilderment.

The answer is that they do, and mey have nor been lost or diluted over time. In faCt, each generation of mahasiddhas has added further clarifications to the layout.

The protector Maitreya stated in the Ornament ofCkar Real-iZdtionjl) that faith is like the foundation. This means that if you want to grow anything, such as trees, gtains, or Rowers, you need the earth. In the same way, faith is like the ground from which all of the qualities of the path arise. From the very beginning, faith and interest in Dharma are very important. Those who have entered the path of Dharma have naturally developed these qualities. First, they understood enough about the Dharma ro have an interest in it. Then, through great exertion and austerity they pursued its practice and study. Nevertheless, they must continue to look carefully at the quality of their faith and interest. Interest can be stable or it can be temporary and ephemeral. Even a transitory interest in Dharma is good. However, it is produced by conditions and when those conditions change, interest can vanish. So we need to stabilize our interest and faith, and this is achieved by knowing the reasons for having faith in the Dharma in the first place. A series of contemplations called the four thoughts that turn the mind are instrumental in developing interest and faith in the Dharma. By studying and reRecting on these, we come to understand the reasons for and the benefits of practicing Dharma and, by contrast, the defects of not practicing. Thinking about these four thoughts most carefully is especially important for beginners. In particular, the Buddha said that the comemplation of impermanence, which is the second of the four thoughtS, is like the footprint of an elephant. An elephant's footprint was considered the best footprint, because not only is it very large, but it has a nice round, uniform shape, not elongated and strange like a hwnan footprint. In the same way, the contemplation of impermanence is the best. as it brings about a more spacious and uniform Sfate of mind.

Afterward, it is impermanence that inspires and encourages diligence in practice. For example, people often come to me and say, '''I'm reaHy interested in Dharma, bUl 1 cannot make myself practice.\" Or, \"1 used to practice a lot, but now I JUSt cannot make myself do ir.\" Or, \"1 really want to practice, but somehow I cannot get it together. 1 cannot find the time or the circumstances.\" 1 n all these cases, the rem-edy for this inability to generate the diligence to practice is contempla-tion of impermanence. When we find that our diligence is flagging, we should bring impermanence to mind and our practice will increase. When we find that we are losing faith, considering impermanence will help it return. So impermanence is important at the beginning and throughout the path as the means of overcoming the loss of faith and diligence. By reflecting on these four thoughts that turn the mind, we initially develop a stable faith; continuing on the path, we are able to further stabilize, strengthen, and reinforce our faith as we practice. In this way, the faith we first generate and then develop is not a casual or uninformed faith. It is faith based upon the correct information about why we should practice the Dharma, so it is much stronger and more stable. This is the reason for continuing to contemplate the four thoughts throughoUl the lengrh ~f our path. The Two Paths The actual path can be followed in twO ways: through the path of method and through the path of liberation.

Afrer completing guru yoga and receiving the blessing of our teacher and lineage, we engage in the practice of a meditational deity (Tib. yidam). Through the generation and completion stages of this prac-tice, we achieve realization. That is the path of means or method. The path ofliberation is the practice of mahamudri. It begins with the stabilization of our wavering mind through the practice of tranquility meditation. Then through insight meditation, which looks into the nature of mind, mahamudra is accomplished. To facilitate and enhance the practices of tranquility and insight, we must still engage in gathering the two accumulations even while pursuing the path of liberation. The accumulations serve to greatly enhance the practices of tranquility and insight. When our practice of tranquility is unstable, it can be grounded through these practices. When we lack insight, it can be generated by these practices. Therefore, the path in either format conforms to what was said by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, in his Aspiration Prayer of Mahiimudrii: \"The supreme path is that of the twO accumulations, beyond the extremes of exaggeration and denial.\" The principal path is facilitated through gathering the accumulation of merit. Though the path of means and the path ofliberation may appear distinct, the nature of the paths and what is to be realized by them is the same. Mahamudra as a Modern Buddhist Practice Since the paths of method and liberation have the same nature and lead to the same result, it is possible to practice them in isolation or to com-bine them. These days, especially in the West, the path of liberation will be of th e greatest benefit, because of the eighty-four mabasiddhas, or great masters, who arose during a time in the history of India when the Dharma and the Vajrayana Aourished simultaneously.

Beyond chat, their lifestyles varied tremen-dously. Some of them were in very high social positions like the power-ful and wealthy King Indrabhuti. While fulfilling his responsibilities as a king and enjoying the luxury of his court life, he was able to practice mahamudci meditation and achieve complete awakening. We can infer from this example that mahamudra practice works in a situation of vast activity, rremendous responsibility, and great luxury. Other mahasiddhas were important scholars, of whom the best-known was Nagarjuna, one of the greatest scholars in che history of Buddhism. Throughout his life, he composed an impressive number of ueatises, which clarified for the first time various aspects of the Buddha's teachi ngs. In his compositions Nagarjuna refuted mistaken positions so skillfully that even those he refuted accepted his arguments. Due to his effectiveness, the Buddha's teachings spread far and wide. Nagarjuna's impact was so far-reaching that he revolutionized Buddhist scholarship. Even non-Buddhist traditions in India were radically changed by his writing and his methods of reasoning. This tremendous influence was due to the precision of his reasoning. which was unprecedented. Though Nagarjuna was busy teaching, composing. or debating, he still managed to achieve supreme siddhi in hi s lifetime through the practice of mahimudci. It is therefo re evident that rnahamudci can be practiced effectively in a busy life of scholarship. Other mahasiddhas had common occupations, some of them quite lowly; for example. the great siddha lilopa ground sesame seeds.

A Brief Presentation of Fruition Mahamudra AN EXAMPLE AND ITS MEANING ,. Though cloud banks take up water from the ocean And fill the earth again with descending rains, The ocean does not decrease; filling the whole sky, it remains full: There is no increase or decrease. 6. T he Victorious Ones are filled with perfect qualities, Which all have the very same nature-spontaneous presence. From the natural display of the great sphere, living beings take birth and therein cease. In relation to this, there is no thing and no nonthing.31 The fifth and the sixth verses give a brief presentation of mahamudra's fruition. The fifth verse contains an analogy for the state offruition and the sixth verse presents its meaning. Using the analogy of the ocean, Saraha illustrates that the fruition of mahamudra is a state beyond increase and decrease. Even though water from the ocean is taken up by clouds through evaporation and then sent down as rain, the ocean is never depleted of water; nor is the water of the ocean increased through rainfall, because the amount of water involved in the whole system remains constant. In the same way, through the pursuit of the path, we reach the goal of enlightenment and develop full realization of the nature of all phenomena or, one could say, we realize spontaneously present, coemergenr wisdom. What we are realizing are the qualities of the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE SONG BEGINS 41 ground, the unchanging basic nature, and so the qualities of the fruition, like the ocean, are unchanging. In other words, at fruition these quali-ties do not increase or decrease. It is said in the Uttamtantra,'l \"There is nothing to be removed from this and there is nothing that needs to be added to this.\" When some-thing perfect is perfectly seen, you will be perfectly liberated. There is no defect in the nature of your mind that needs to be removed. There are no qualities outside of it that need to be introduced into it. If you can look at this nature properly [Q see the nature as it is and you see this com-pletely, then simply through this act, you will be completely liberated. This is [he point of verse 6. In summary, verses I ro 3 explain the ground; verse 4 explains the path; and verses 5 and 6 explain the fruition of mahamudra. Questions Question: Rinpoche, you made some statements regarding generalized and linguistic abstractions and I was wondering if you could go over that again. Rinpoche: I mentioned these as illustrations of how bewildered appear-ances occur within the mind. More specifically, I was talking about how we experience outside objects and perceive our thinking mind, without the mind and its object actually existing as cwo separate things. When an object experienced by one of the senses appears in our mind, what appears is a generalized image or likeness of that thing. For example, if we imagine our home right now, we will be able to create a fairly dear and detailed picture of the various rooms, our furniture, and so fonh. In spite of the vividness of this experience and its great detail, none of these things are actually physically present within our mind. What is"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42. A SONG POR THE KING present is an image of it, a mere appearance. In the context of valid cognition, this is called a generalized or generic image abstracted from o ur experience.

Yet from hearing these wonderful Dharma teachings, I now have many concepts. 1 am expecting to have a certain experience in mahamudra that has been described as spacious, clear, and lucid. Now I feel that these concepts are a hindrance and a support. What to do with them? And if 1 do have an experience in doing mahamudra practice, how do I know ifit is really a fabrication of my mind? Rinpoche: The primary intent of mahamudci instruction is to teach us to be free of any attempt to control or alter the mind's nature. The instructions are that in meditation, we should be free of any wish to cre-ate or maintain any particular mental state. In the mahamudci tradition, the type of meditation in which we pursue the experience of trying to achieve a particular state of mind is known as rainbow meditation: we are pursuing something beautiful for the experience. The problem with this is that we are trying to bring about a certain positive experience. This involves conceptual contrivance and altering the mind-the very things that prevent us from experiencing mind's nature, which is not connived and cannot be altered or changed. Therefore, instead of experiencing mind's nature. we experience whatever it is that we have created. Mahimudci meditation is a direct experience of the mind as it is and not an attempt to alter or create it. The mind's nature does not have to be changed, and, actually, the true nature cannot be created or recreated. Nevertheless, this instruction does not mean that we should allow our-selves to be distracted by thoughts or disturbing emotions. The freedom from alteration does not mean allowing ourselves to be drawn away; it means freedom from the conceptually directed meditation of attempt-ing to achieve a certain state. For example. while meditating we may think, \"I must experience this emptiness. The mind is brilliant lucidity and I must perceive this lucidity.\" The primary intent of the instruction is to be free from this discursiveness."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"44 A SONG FOR THE KING With regard to your second question, it is difficul t to ascertain imme· diately the nature of an experience in meditation.

THE FIRST SIX VERSES of Saraha's song presented an overview of the ground, path, and fruition. Saraha now returns to the same sub-jects, but in much greater detail. I apologize for the repetitious nature of traditional Buddhist texts. The reason for this is mat the initial presenta-tion is a brief summary that serves as an introduction to the whole work. Generally, in the context of the ground. path, and fruition, the under-standing of the ground is presented in terms of the three aspects of prac-rice: view, meditation, and conduct. The view is the general oudook of the ground. The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, wrote: \"Confidence in the view is the eradication of superimposition and denial with regard to the ground.\" Previously, we saw that the ground is explained as the way things really are and that not seeing this leads to ignorance. Through the realization of mind's nature, a special certainty is generated within; when we comprehend this, it becomes the view. The view is unmistaken because it is not caught by the fault of superimposition, which is the hdief that something exists when it actually does not. Further, the view is not mistaken because it is not caught by the fault of denial, the belief chat something that actually does exist does not. The derailed presenta tion of the ground makes up fourteen stanzas. The first four of these stanzas use incongruent analogiesll to show that craving or fixation must be given up. Generally, the type of craving that 45"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 A SONG FOR THE K ING is referred to in these verses is an attachment that can arise through the practice of meditation. This happens when we have an experience and then begin to desire irs repetition and continuation. The reason such craving must be rdinquished is that the purpose of meditation is to real-ize the nature of our mind. Attachment to any form of temporary or conditioned experience obstructs this realization, because what we are attempting to realize is not temporary or condicioned experiences but what transcends them. Attachments to Be Abandoned in Meditation ATTACHMENT TO CONDITIONED BLISS 7. Giving up genuine bliss, you take another path And place your hopes in conditioned bliss. Taking nectar in their mouth, bees come dose, But not drinking, they are far from enjoyment. There are four verses concerned with the problem of attachment to a temporary experience in med itation. The analogy used in the first of these stanzas is t he analogy of bees taking nectar from Aowers on the mountainsides and then not being able to consume it themselves. When bees take nectar from the flowers they find, they PUt it into their mouths, so they are very dose to enjoying it. But they never actually do so. They give it to others, and therefore, from their point of view, their collection of the nectar is pointless. Unlike the bees, when practicing medita[ion, we m ust drink the ultimate nectar: we must realize the mind's nature. If we become attached to conditioned bliss, which is a temporary experi-ence of intense well-being. then this attachment to a temporary state will prevent us from actually experiencing the true result of meditation practice. In this sense, our meditation becomes like bees collecting honey without consuming it."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 47 This situation of being bound by anachment to experience can happen through the pursuit of meditation in general or, in panicular, through practicing the techniques found on the path of method. Here, through working with the subtle channels and subtle winds of our body, we can generate experiences of bliss, extraordinary clarity, and nonthought. These experiences arise on the pam of method, but they are not me goal of the path. The purpose of these experiences is merely to serve as mem-ods leading to the recognition of mind's nature. The experiences them-selves are not the point of meditation. Therefore, becoming anached to them prevenrs us from going toward our true goal. In sum, whenever experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality arise in meditation, it is important not to become attached to them. The situation is fundamentally the same whether the experiences arise through the path of method or through the practice of tranquility and insight. As, long as we become attached to any meditation experience, we are like a bee that collects honey but never gets to consume it. The con-trary is also true: if we are not attached to the experiences in meditation, we are like a bee that actually gets to consume the honey. ATTACHMENT TO WHAT Is TO BE TAKEN OR GIVEN UP 8.

But animals do not accumulate Y!;ry much negative karma. Even predators such as lions and tigers kill ro eat, and therefore, they do not really accumulate much negative karma because th eir motivation is not malicious. Furthermore, duting their whole lives they do not kill as many beings as an expert ca n kill in one instant with a bomb. Often, human intelligence is used not for the good but as a cause of great tragedies and th e accumulation of negative karma. H ere, the analogy shows that under certain circumstances, it is bener to be dumb than to be smart. The second t\\Vo lines of this verse explain what the analogy refers to. \"On one hand, practitioners come to drink th e nectar of space; on the other, experts remain very attached to objects.\" \" Experts\" here refers to those who are very learned in Dharma and therefore very skilled at rig-orous logical analysis of phe nomena. Such persons can be referred to as \"Dharma professionals,\" and they correspond to the experts in the sec-ond line.

It is not saying that the logical analysis of phenomena is bad; on the contrary, it is good. But ifit is never applied to practical experience, it is wasted. It is for this reason that in Vajrayana practice , the view is developed by means of direct valid cognition and not inferential valid cognition. These twO types of valid cognition are two possible ways that the view can be generated, and therefore they are twO possible foundations of the path. Using inferential valid cognition to ascertain the vie\\'1 involves strict logical analysis. Nagarjuna carefully described this process in order to reveal emptiness as the true nature of all phenomena. In his system, one examines phenomena, including apparently solid objects, and proves through logical reasoning that they are empty. Inferential valid cognition actually has two aspects: One is the analy-sis of the existence of self, and the other is the analysis of the existence of external phenomena. In the first case, what we are analyzing is that which we normally think of as ~I\" or \"myself.\" We examine the charac-teristics of this imputed self and look to see if there is anything that pos-sesses these characteristics. We also examine to see (I) if the self is located in or is identical to the body or (2) if the self is located in or is identical to the mind. With careful analysis, we discover that none of these are the case, because the self or \"I\" does not exist. Through logical analysis, we can show that all phenomena can be broken down ever further into components.,}! Therefore, even the coars-est and most apparently so lid phenomena are merely aggregates and thus have no Hue exiStence. This type of analysis generates a great conceptual certainty that emptiness is indeed the true nature of phenomena. In their spiritual songs, Kagyli masters of the past have said that those who are learned in reasoning and scripture have lost the meaning of nonduality. What this means is that through the rigorous study of the scriptures and their commentaries and through the application of logi-cal reasoning, we can develop a very refined conceptual understanding"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 A SONG FOR THE KING of the narure of phenomena. But having mastered this, we will not see the true nature itself, because it cannot be an object of conceptual under-standing. The true nature cannot be realized through concepts. For example, when logically examining mind's true nature, we deter-mine that existence and nonexistence are mutually exclusive. Either something exists or it does nor. But when we hold these two conditions as mutually exclusive, we are prevented from directly realizing that the true nature of phenomena is the unity of appearance and emptiness. The reason this unity cannot be apprehended intellecrually was stated by Samideva in A Guid~ to th~ Bodhisattva's Way of Lifo: \"Ultimate truth is not the object of the intellect because the intellect itself is relative truth.\" The intellect can only think, and ultimate truth cannot be grasped by thought. Only things that can be conceptualized are within the realm of relative truth. This means that all the clever thinking and analysis we do is nor sufficient to lead us to the recognition of ultimate truth, even though ultimate truth is the object of the intellecrual examination. Santideva continues: \"Whereas we [practitioners] with the key of oral instructions put our finger right on it and take it as the path.\" It is the oral instructions'S and not Madhyamaka analysis that allows us to iden-tify [he true nature as surely as if we could touch it with our fingertip. The second way to develop the view, which is the one used most often in the Vajrayana, is taking direct valid cognition as the path. In th is approach, we do not analyze external phenomena or external objects; rather, we look directly at our mind. Furthermore, nor only is the object of consideration different, bUl the manner of examining is different as well. When looking at, or for, the mind, we do not look for it with rea-soning. We do not attempt to prove through logical analysis that the mind must be one thing or many things, and so on. We just look at it direcdy to observe its characteristics. In order [Q understand how these approaches are actually implemented by Vajrayana practitioners, we need to think of Dharma practice in three"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 51 broad phases: hearing (or s[Udying), contemplating (or thinking about), and meditating. When engaged in the first two stages of training-hear. ing and contemplating-we do not employ direct valid cognition but rum ro inferential valid cognition, which is the rigorous application of logical analysis. This produces a decisive certainty about the nature of phenomena. Through this process, we become absolutely certain about what ultimate truth is like. But when we begin to practice meditation, we do not employ infer· entiaJ valid cognition; we use direct valid cognition. Inference is very effeccive in producing a decisive concep[Ual certainry, but it is very hard to apply this certainry to direct experience. It takes an extremely long time to refine it and develop actual wisdom. For this reason, the Buddha said, \"It takes three periods of innumerable eons of gathering the accu· mulations to achieve buddhahood.\" Therefore, we do not use inference in the practice of meditation, but direct valid cognition. In Vajrayana. the view is established through what is called the view of direct experience, which refers to direct valid cognition.

In this eighth verse a distinction is made between practitioners who come to drink th e nectar of space and experts who rema.in attached to objects. The point being made here is very significant. The cultivation of th e wisdom arising through hearing and contemplation is of great importance. But if we become attached to it and consider it as an end in itself, it becomes meaningless and useless, because the only function of this wisdom is to prepare us for the direct experience in meditation.

In the same way, those who are artached to dense ignorance, including the attachment to pleasutes of this life, cast away the possibility of tran-scending suffering, and in this sense, they are like bugs. Living in this world, we have no choice but to deal with the com-monplace. The instruction here is not that we should try to avoid it but that we should not limit ourselves to the mundane.

We can become quite impressed with these experiences. We may have new thoughts or see things that we rake as indications of attain-ment. If we become attached to these appearances, they become a diver-sion from the pursuit of a genuine path, because we have become attached to something that is conditioned and temporary. The first line reads: \"The ignorant think an ox's hoofprint filled with water is the ocean and look for gems therein, yet this water will soon evaporate.\" Taking a transitory experience or vision that may occur during medita-tion to be real attainment is like mistaking a hoofprint filled with water for the ocean . Not only is the hoofprint much smaller than the ocean, it does nm even possess any of the wonderful things found within the ocean, such as jewels. Further, a hoofprint full of water will evaporate, whereas the ocean will not. In the same way, these meditative experiences are transitory, and becoming attached to them will only rum us away from a true path. The verse continues: \"Likewise, those who take their passing experi-ences to be enlightenment will not see the perfect qualities.

In this sec~ tion we will look at verses II through 14, which by means of four analogies explain why the qualities of an authentic understanding of the ground can be developed and need to be developed. REALIZATION WILL REMOVE FAULTS II. Just as the ocean's salty water Taken into th e douds turns sweet, The stable mind works to benefit others; The poison of objects turns into healing nectar. Verse II illustrates that if we realize the true nature of the mind, this realization itself will remove all defects and problems. T hese could be of various types-disturbing thoughts or emotions, experiences of intense sadness or regret. They can all be removed through the recognition of mind's nature in mahamudci practice. How this is possible is explained here through an analogy of ocean water. We cannot drink seawater because it is toO salty. Nevertheless, after the ocean's water evaporates, gathers into douds, and returns to me earth as rain, it has become pure. No longer salty. it is fit to drink. The meaning of this analogy is as follows. We continually give rise to various forms of disturbing emotions. For example, when we encounter an external object that makes us angry. this experience of anger causes us to be unhappy. If we act on this anger, others can suffer as well.

In each of these situations, it seems (Q us that the disturbing emotion or suffering that arises in our mind is very solid and powerful. Since it is so intense, it appears to be more powerful than we feel we are. However, if we actually look and meditate on the mind's narure, we discover that all the: things arising in our mind-thoughts, disturbing emotions, sadness, and misery-are mere appearances. If we scrutinize them, looking [Q see what they really are and where they really are, we will discover they are empty of substance and location. When we look directly at the thoughts, disturbing emotions, and misery that arise in our mind, we cannot find where they are located or where they came from or whether they have a shape o r color. We never find any of these qualities that all the objects seem [0 have. Examining here means looking at the thought within the mind, not examining the object that inspired the thought or the condition that led [0 the disturbing emotion. It is scrutiny of the thought itself; we directly observe the emptiness of the thought. Whether we do this in the contCXt of benefiting others-as the verse states, \"the stable mind works [0 benefit others\" ---or simply in the COntext of benefiting ourselves, what happens when we see the nature of thoughts is that the previously poi~ sonous quality of the thought, the disturbing emotion, or the suffering is transformed into a situation of great benefit. And so as the verse states, \"the poison of objects turns into healing nectar. n We believe that dis~ turbing emotions are terrible, that thoughts are bad, and that sadness is a shame. But the nature of these conditions that arise in our mind is actually Aawless bliss. Since we do not recognize their nature, we are: afflicted by them.

It is normally preceded by the practice of looking at the mind within Stillness. This latter practice means that when we are in a stable state of meditation, we look directly at our own mind. Specifically, we look to see where and what (he mind is. Through this investigation we eventually discover that there is no location and no substance of mind co be found. In this way, we resolve experientially that the mind is empty. This eleventh verse presems looking at the mind in motion. Occur-rence, or movement, means that a thought occurs within the mind. The thought could be any kind of thought-an angry thought, a jeal-ous thought, an arrogant thought, a desirous thought, a sad thought, a happy thought, o r a compassionate thought. Whatever the content of the thought may be, when we recognize that a thought has arisen, we look directly at it. In looking at the thought, we see its nature and dis-cover that it is like the nature of the mind itself: it has no location and no substance. It is empty. $0 through the practice of looking at the mind within the occurrence of thought, we transform the mind's appar-em poison into healing nectar, which is its true nature.

Likewise, though thunder may evoke fear, The falling of rain makes harvests ripen.

Its literal"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58 A S ONG f OR THE KING meaning is \"nothing,\" making it sound like annihilation, but the nature of emptiness is great pea~ or great bliss. We may incorrectly fear the reaI~ ization of emptiness, believing that this realization will produce the anni-hilation of experience; however, the realization o f emptiness is the realization of great peace and great tranquility. When the realization of emptiness occurs, it is different from what we fear it will be. because there is nothing within emptiness that inherently justifies the fear. Emptiness is not in and of itself negative or threatening. The word mlptinm, of course, connotes nmhingness and makes us think of something like empty spa~. a mere absen~, such as the absen~ of any qualities or content. But the emptiness of the mind is what is called \"emptiness endowed with the best of all aspects.\" This means that while the mind is empty, it is not a voidness; rather, it is cognitive lucid~ ity. This means, for example, that when you look at your mind, you do not find the mind, no r do you see thoughts in terms of their having a location or possessing substantial characteristics. The mind and the thoughu within the mind are empty bur they are not nothing, because there is an unceasing display of mind's cognition. This shows (hat the absence of substantial existence does not mean that the mind is dead like a stone. For this reason , the realization of this absence of true existence does not cause the cessation of experien~. While being empty of any kind of substantial existence, the mind remains an unceasing awareness. Yet, when you look for it, you cannot find it anywhere; you cannot find anything substantial because the mind is empty. It is also unchanging. If the mind were not empty, if the mind had so lidity or substantial existence, it would definitely change. Often called \"the inexpressible\" o r \"that which is beyond intellect,\" the mind's emptiness is the reaso n that the mind is unchanging. And because the mind is unchanging, its nature is great bliss. The analogy in verse 12 is the sound of thunder, which represents empti~ ness, o r more precisely. our concept of emptiness.

But when you think about it, thunder is a good thing, because thunder is a sign of rain, which ripens the crops. In the same way, while we might think of emptiness as threatening and negative, in fact its nature is great bliss, and therefore the realization of emptiness is very positive. ApPEARANCE AND EMPTINESS ARE NON DUAL 13. First a thing and in the end a nonthing-neither is established; likewise, there is nothing other than these two.36 There is no place to abide in the beginning, middle, or end. For those whose minds are obscured by continual concepts, Emptiness and compassion are expressed in words. The next verse is concerned with the lack of an inherent substance in the ar ising, abiding, and cessation of thoughts. Or we could say that it deals with the unity of appearance and emptiness, which then brings forth the realization of the unity of emptiness and compassion. When we consider the nature of mind or the essential nature of the thoughts that arise in the mind, we assume that these things must have begun somehow and somewhere. They must dwell somewhere and at some point they must cease. But when we actually look at how a thought arises and what actually happens, we don't find anything creating the thought, nor do we find the location of this arising. When we look for the characteristics that a thought might possess, such as color and shape, we do not find them. When we look to see where the thought is, even though it is vividly present within the mind, we cannot find it anywhere. The thought is not specifically located in any place within the body nor outside the body nor in some area in between. We must conclude that not only does the thought not [fuly arise, but it also does nOt abide or rest anywhere."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 A SONG FOR THE K ING Finally, when a thought disappears, we look to see what really hap-pens. Where does it go? We do not find anything. In this way, we are brought to the conclusion that thoughts do not Huly arise, do not truly abide, and do not truly cease. Whether recognized or not, the narure of our mind has always been juSt this. It is not that the discovery of this nature makes the mind empty, because the mind has always been so. The problem is that we have never looked into our mind. We have always turned and looked outward, or away from it. This is the mean-ing of the thirteenth verse. Verse 13 also answers this question: What qualities are produced by meditation on emptiness? The purpose of Dharma is to help others, and the root of this is compassion. But if all th ings are empty and if the emptiness of things is realized, is there then no object and therefore no root of compassion? This verse answers that question in the negative. fu the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, pointed out in his Aspiration Prayer of Mahiimudrii: \"The very recognition of emptiness itself is the roOt of compassion.\" This is because the realization of mind's empty nature and the realization of phenomena's empty nature produces a state of well-being and tranquility in the mind. Disturbing emotions and suf-fering are pacified, and th is causes all manner of positive qualities to develop within the mind. When we realize the true nature of mind, we gain the understanding that all beings without exception possess this same nature, this same potential ro achieve all of the positive qualities through realization. At the same time, we realize that only those few fortunate individuals who recognize the nature of mind have all their suffering pacified and so compassion arises for those who have not attained this realization. In general, we do not look at our mind and, therefore, do not recog-nize the nature of the mind and the nature of the thoughts. Rather, we are caught up by these thoughts, which then generate disturbing emo-tions, which lead to suffering. Since the basic nature of o rdinary beings"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CROUND MAHAMUDRA 61 is the same as the nature of those who have realized mind's nature. we come to see mat aU of mis suffering is reaUy unnecessary: since beings possess chis nature, chey do not need to suffer at all.

The Third Karmapa wrote: \"May intolerable compassion be born in my mind through the realization of emptiness.\" The compassion thac is born through realization is not merely words but intolerably intense. How AN EXPERT DIFFERS FROM A DUNCE 14. Just as the nectar dwelling within a flower Is known by the bumblebee. The fortunate tOSS away neither existence nor nirvana. Like them, the ignorant sho uld fully understand. This verse is concerned with the fact that even though ::all beings with-out exception possess the same nature of mind, the mere possession of m is buddha nature is not enough. It must be thought about and medi-tated upon. Saraha illustrates this with the analogy of the fortunate and the ignorant, or a wise person and a foolish person. In contrast to verse 8, me expert (here me fortunate one) represents the positive side and the foolish person the negative one. The analogy is me following. In a lake there is a lotus Rower and in the midst of that lotus Rower there is nec-tar. the potential for ho ney. A bee, representing the wise person. recog-n izes the presence of the nectar within the lotus Rower and drinks its nectar. In that same way, knowing about the presence of mind's nature, a learned person meditates on it and realizes it . On the other hand, the foolish person is like a frog.

The last four verses have explained why the proper practice of [he path will lead to realization. In the next set of four verses, we are going to look at what should be abandoned and what should be realized through combining congruent and incongruent analogies. Indicating the Essential Nature NONATTACHMENT TO WHAT Is UNTRUE 15. Just as an image appears on the mirror's surface, Where the ignorant look in their lack of knowledge, So the mind that throws away the truth Relies on many concepts that are not true. This verse uses the analogy of a mirror's reRection to instruct us about abandoning our belief in and fixation on the reality of impure appear-ances. According to the analogy, if a small child who does not know about mirrors looks at his or her reflection, he or she may think that there is actually anoth er child there. The child becomes attached to the reRection, thinking that it is a potential friend or playmate, and yet it is a mere reRection and nothing to be attached to. Similarly, when a monkey looks in a mirror, it sees its reRection as another monkey, who is a potential threat o r competitor, and so the monkey bares its teeth and ferociously glares at its own reRection. Just as the reRection in a mirror is not the actual presence of an object evoking attachment or aggression, in the same way, what appears in the mind is also not an object of attachment or aversion. Whether we are speaking of reRections or what appears within the mind, none of them have any intrinsic reality. Failing to understand this, we take them to be real. For example, when anger arises in o ur mind and we look at its"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 63 nature, we can see that this anger has no true exiHence. However, if we do nm look at the narure of (he anger, it will seem real and thereby over· whdm us. When unhappiness arises in our mind, if we look at its nature, we see that it has no substantial characteristics~no color, shape, form, and so on. But if we never look at its nature, we will not recognize its lack of reality and will thereby come under its control. It is important not to be caught by di sturbing emotions appearing in our mind, because if we follow them, they will engulf us. If we are caught up by unhappiness or regret. it wiJl oppress us with sadness. To keep from being overpowered by the affiictions, we should juSt look at [he nacure of whatever is arising in our mind. If we think the reflections in the mirror are real, they will enslave us. If we follow after the disturbing emotions and mental states that arise within us, we become their servant, losing our freedom and control. However, if we recognize their nature, we will realize that it is peace and bliss. Therefore, to achieve realization, it is necessary to understand that these disturbing emotions and mental States do not ultimately exist; they are mere appearances like the images in a mirror. In mahamudra prac· t ice. we come to know the true nature of these mental states nor by inference but through direct observation. CONTINUOUS MEDITATIVE CONCENTRATION 16. Though the fragrance of a flower has no form, It clearly pervades everywhere. Likewise, through the formless nature The circles of the mandalas will be known.\" The previous verse instructed us not to be attached to appearances, dis· curbing emotions, and mental states. The sixteenth verse points out that we must recognize dharmara, which can be recognized even though it is"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"64 A SONG FOR THE KING not a substantial entity. From the very beginning, dharmata, the nature of mind, has been emptiness, and, consequently, it has no su bstantial existence. Nevertheless, we can familiarize ourselves with dharmata and realize ie, thereby achieving the final fruition. While it can be experi-enced and realized, dharmata cannot be perceived by the senses, because it has no substantial characteristics. The analogy presented in this verse is the fragrance of Rowers. If Rowers are present in one room, their fragrance will waft into the adja-cent rooms. If you are in a neighboring room, however, you will not see Rowers even though the room you are in is filled with their fragrance. In the same way, having no form and being empty, dharmat:l cannot be per-ceived in the usual way. Yet in mahamudra practice, you can experience this emptiness through your direct observation of the mind, which is not, however, observation in the usual sense. Furthermore. in the prac-t ice of mahamudcl, we are not attempting to trans form something Ihat exists into something that does not exist, nor to transform something that does not exist into something that does exist. This nature is the inherent emptiness o f all phenomena and of the mind in particular. This emptiness, which we observe in the mind, is nor a dead emptiness or a voidness. because it also has luminous clarity or wisdom. While it is emptiness, it is also lucidity, a nd while it is lucidity, it is also empty. This is the nature of mind that must be known. Altho ugh it has no substan-tial form or existence, it can be experienced because of its luminous clar-ity. It is this that must be understood, and it is this nature that must be realized. When the mind's nature is recognized, the result is the mani-festation of the three bodies. o r the arising of the mandala of the th ree kayas-the dharmakaya. sambhogakaya. and nirmii.J:1akaya. Through the recognition that mind itself is unborn and empty, what must be abandoned is abando ned. This can happen because we recog-nize that what is to be abandoned has no true existence. Through this recognition, it is liberated by its own nature. Further, when the nature"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 65 of mind is recognized, we realize not just its emptiness but also its lucid-ity. By recognizing the lucidity, we main what must be attained, which is the dharmakaya. The qualities of the dharmakaya are wisdom, loving-kindness, and the ability to protect. In its wisdom, the dharmakaya knows the ultimate truth. Having realized that ultimate nature, it sees the nature of all things just as it is, which is called the wisdom of the tfUe nature of phenom-ena. Does the dharmakaya know only the absolute nature of things? No, it also knows the manifestations, the vat iery of the appearances of all phenomena. It knows the characteristics of all appearances and it knows that these appearances are confusion. So this wisdom sees dharmata, or emptiness, and it also knows the ignorance of beings. This wisdom that knows the bewildermem of beings is called the wisdom of the variety of phenomena, or we could say the wisdom that knows the variety of all the appearances of relative truth. An analogy for th is is the following. Imagine that a person is lying asleep in bed and dreaming. Beside the sleeping person is a second per-son with clairvoyance, who is awake and fully aware of the comem of the other person's d reams. The person with extrasensory perception knows that the person who is asleep is just asleep in bed and what that pe rson is experiencing is just dreams. In the same way, a buddha personally does not experience ignorance or confusion bU[ does see t he ignorance of beings in all its detail and variery. The dharmakaya possesses this excellent wisdom, which knows both ultimate truth and relative truth. T hrough this excellent and consum-mate wisdom, the Buddha naturally possesses great compassion for all beings who are suffering, for those who are carried away by their dis-turbing emotions, and even for those who are not presently suffering bU[ are still confused. So the dharmakaya, the mind of a buddha. possesses nor only this twofold wisdom bU[ also consummate loving-kindness. Pos-sessing th is wisdom and loving-kindness, a buddha sees all beings with"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"66 A SONG fOR THE KING compassion. The dharmakaya can protect beings: the Buddha is able to help and benenl them lhrough an immense variety of methods. In sum, the mind of the Buddha, the dharmakaya, possesses the qualities of wisdom. loving-kindness. and ability to help, which are the result of the path. From the dharmakaya arise the sambhogakaya and nirma~alciya, which together make up the rupakaya, or form body. The dharmakaya with its qualities of wisdom, loving-kindness, and ability to protect is considered the causal condition for these other two form bodies. The dharmakaya. however. cannot be visited or experienced by ordinary sen-tient beings, and so it emanates the form bodies. For those with purified karma, bodhisattvas abiding on any of the ten bodhisattva levels, the dharmakaya manifests as the sambhogalciya. The sambhogakaya, or per-fect enjoyment body, is called the enjoyment body because in the sam-bhogalciya realm. Dharma is continually taught and one never needs to pass into parinirvana. In that way. the sambhogalciya is endowed with what are called the five certainties of the perfect teacher, teachings, ret-inue, place, and time. For those individuals with impure karma. like most of us ordinary beings who cannot visit or encounter the sambhogakaya, the dharma-lciya emanates as the nirma~alciya, which is relatively impure. An exam-ple of the nirmal}alciya is a buddha who comes into the world, performs the twelve deeds of a buddha, and leaches ordinary beings, as the his-torical Sakyamuni Buddha d id. In sum, the th ree lciyas ar ise as a result of having meditated on the true nature. How HABITS RElry CONCEPTS 17. When a wintry wind strikes and stirs up water, Though soft, it takes the form of stone."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 67 When concepts attempt to disturb mind's nature, where igno-rance cannot take form, Appearances become very dense and solid. The seventeenth verse illustrates that all appearances are the appearances of the mind. Earth, stones, mountains, rocks, and so forth, all seem very solid to us, so it is quite hard to understand how these things could be merely the appearances of our mind. The Ocean ofDifinitive Meaning points this out in stages: First it shows that appearances are mind; then that mind is emptiness; further, that empdness is spontaneously present; and finally, that spontaneous presence is liberated in and of itself. The subject of this verse is this same point. While earth, mountains, and rocks in their true nature are no different from our mind, in terms of how they appear, they seem vast, huge, and very solid. We might won-der, H ow can our mind encompass and perceive what is so big and so apparently solid? The analogy here is of water and ice. When it is not frozen. water is a liquid; but when a body of water is subjected to a very cold wind, it freezes and becomes ice, which is hard like stone. Nor-mally we don't think of water as being hard, and yet ice is water and it is hard. In this same way, when our mind is disturbed by ignorance and dis-turbing emotions, which resemble the cold wind, it produces coarse thoughts. The gradual producrion of coarser and coarser thoughts, which entail coarser and coarser modes of appearance, corresponds to the gradual freezing of the water. These coarse thoughts cause the solid appearance of earth and mountains, even though the thoughts them-selves began as mere insubstantial things.

The analogy presented here is of a jewel that has somehow fallen into a swamp. The jewel itself has excellent color and shape and is completely pure in being a jewel. It does not degenerate at all while mired in the swamp; it remains exactly what it was. On the other hand, it can't be used. The jewel's qualities are not apparent because it is concealed. If the jewel is removed from the swamp and the mud is cleaned away, the jewel will be a perfect jewel and can be used appropriately. In the same way. as long as our mind is immersed in bewildered appearances, we cannot gain access to and make use of the mind's in nate qualities. Through meditation, however, if we can separate the mind from ignorance. we will be able to make use of the innate qualities of the mind to engage in effortless and spontaneous benefit for ourselves and others. Although the mind is empty, it is not empty in the sense of being a voidness. The mind's basic nature is simultaneously emptiness and cog-nitive lucidity. This nature has never been damaged or even affected by all the appearances, confusion, and ignorance within the three realms of samsara. So we have to ask, Is liberation from samsara actually effecting a change in the mind at all? It is not. From the very beginning the mind has been empty and lucid. In meditation, therefore, we are not trying to change what the mind is; we are nO[ trying to make what is not empty into something that is empty or to make something that is not lu cid into something that is lucid. All we are doing in the practice of meditation is experiencing (he mind as it is and as it always has been. When the mind is experienced"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"GROUND MAHAMUDRA 69 and finally rnlized, that is liberation. There is no net'<! to change the mind's nafOre, because the nature of the mind has never been affected by any confusion. Often the nature of the mind is called buddha nature or sugatagarbha (\"the essential nature of those gone to bliss\"). When the term sugntn-garbha is used, even though it refers to the nature of our own mind, it is thought of as a high state, as somethin g very distant from us and unapproachable. It is therefore important to understand what sugata-garbha really means. Sugata means \"those gone to bliss.\" The syllable su here is \"bliss,\" which means that if you recognize and realize the nature of mind, you eliminate the suffering of samsara: the result of realizing the mind's nature is bliss. Gtltn, or \"gone,\" means that innumerable buddhas have appeared and all of th em have achieved enlightenment through realizing the nature of their mind and thereby attaining the bliss of full awakening. All of the buddhas began as confused, bewildered sentient be ings. They transcended the ignorance and suffering of samsara and entered into bliss. It is up to us now to follow the example of the buddhas and realize the nature of our mind and discover this indwelling bliss. Do we have {he ability to do so? Yes, we have the innate capacity to follow and emulate those who have gone to bliss. If we lacked some qualities or abilities that they had, we might not be able to do it, but in the nature of our mind, we have everything that they ever had or have. Since we have what they have and they accomplished full awakening, we can do it also. This is why the nature of the mind is called the essential nature of those gone to bliss. The Uttaratnnrra states: \"Like a jewel, like space, and like pure water, it is continually free of disturbance.\" When a jewel is purified and the dirt that surrounds it is removed, the nature of [he jewel itself does nOt change.

The space was nor inherently affected o r polluted in irs natUre by the presence of the douds. The third example is water. Water in itself is JUSt pure water; it only becomes polluted when sedi-ment is mixed with it. But even so, the water itself remains just water. Muddy water is water combined with something else, but the water is not in itself changed or damaged by the presence of the sediment. In the same way, while our mind is affiicted and obscured by igno-rance, disturbing emotions, and thoughts, the nature of the mind is not touched by their presence. However, when these obscurations are pres-ent, the qualities of the mind's nature will not be evident. So it says in the verse, \"Even so, if a supreme gem is placed in a swamp, its radiance will not be dear.\" The Dependent Arising of Cause and Effect THE BASIS FOR SAM SARA AND NIRVANA 19. When stUpidity is dear, wisdom is unclear. When stupidity is dear, suffering is clear. Like this, from a seed, a seedling arises; With this seedling as a cause, offshoots appear. This verse describes why we wander in samsara and how the confused appearances of samsara increase and spread. All samsara begins with ignorance, and in this verse, ignorance is referred to as a state of stupid-ity. By its nature, stupidity is unclear. It is an absence of knowledge, a lack of recognizing ultimate truth, which could be called a mere lack of clarity. However, simultaneous with that lack of recognition, there is a great clarity of ignorance in the projection of relative truth . ..'II As samsara increases, it becomes clearer and dearer.

The inability to recognize this basic nature of mind is called ignorance. It is the beginning of the eighth (aJaya) consciousness.\" This failure to recognize the mind's nature occurs because the empty aspect of the mind's nature is not recognized due to the appearance of its lucid aspect. This causes ignorance and the arising of the eighth consciousness along with the habits it holds, which produce confused appearances. As these bewildered appearances increase, from the eighth consciousness arise the afflicted seventh consciousness and then the six functioning consciousnesses (the five sensory consciousnesses and the mental con-sciousness). At that point, the structure of the bewildered appearances of samsara is fully established. This process of intensification is described in the verse: \"When stupidity is clear, wisdom is unclear.\" As the stu-pidity of samsara becomes more and more vivid and distinct, the under-lying wisdom becomes less and less dear and more and more obscured. This is the same idea expressed in the previous verse with the lines \"If a supreme gem is placed in a swamp, its radiance will not be dear.\" The radiance of the wisdom is obscured by the intensity of the stupidity. When the mind is bewildered, the i1aya consciousness begins to accu-mulate negative habits and tendencies. The alaya consciousness itself is nOt confused; it is mere cognitive lucidity. Nevertheless, it functions as the foundation for accumulating negative habits and for misperceiving the existence of the self. When we have this incorrect view that takes the self to exist, we also develop the incorrect view that the other exisrs as well. Through the increase of negative habits, based on thinking that a self and other exist, negative karmic latencies enter the alaya conscious-ness, and this leads to the arising of the other seven consciousnesses. Even though they are nonconceptual consciousnesses, the five sense consciousnesses arise as the result of habits accrued in the aJaya con-sciousness. The five sense consciousnesses are limited to perceiving a specific sensory input; for example, the eye consciousness JUSt sees, the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 A SONG FOR THE KING ear consciousness JUSt hears. and so form. The sensory consciousnesses do not appraise, recognize. judge, or in any way conceptualize what they see. hear, and so on. The sixth consciousness, the mental consciousness, is the consciousness that appraises, identifies, and judges what is per~ ceived by the five sense consciousnesses. Therefore, it is the sixth con~ sciousness that makes errors, such as believing different things to be essentially one and me same. With the development of all eight consciousnesses, there is a state of full·blown ignorance, which is dear. The verse reads: \"When stupidity is dear, wisdom is unclear.\" When wisdom is dear, the nature of the mind is realized. But when bewilderment, stupidity, and ignorance are clear, the true nature of mind is obscured. This leads to disturbing emo~ tions, which in turn lead to the accumulation of negative karma, which then leads to suffering. Strictly speaking, not everything that results from actions causes suffering, because actions are of different types (positive, negative, and neutral) and so their results may be different. Nonetheless, directly or indirectly, (he result of the disturbing emotions is suffering. For example, being very ill is obviously suffering and is called the suf~ fering of suffering. But even an experience of happiness or well~being will change into a state of suffering because it is impermanelll. In this sense, even states of temporary well· being are called the suffering of change. Furthermore, the pervasive environment of impermanence in which we live causes everything to turn eventuaUy into suffering; this is called all~pervasive suffering. These three types of suffering are me result of the bewildered projections o r appearances of sam sara. This verse presents an analogy to illustrate how the progressive intensification of stupidity causes suffeting: \"From a seed, a seedling arises; with this seedling as a cause, offshoots appear.\" Ignorance is the seed. When it is planted in the ground, it produces a seedling, from which emerges a stalk, and eventually branches grow from the sralk. In the same way, through increasing stupidity, we begin to suffer. This"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"GROUNO MAHAMUDRA 73 suffering keeps us in the midst of samsaric appearances, which always entail suffering in one way or another. Sometimes we experience the suf-fering of suffering, sometimes we experience the suffering o f change, and sometimes we experience all~pervasive suffering. But we always expe~ rience suffering. The verse also shows us, by implication, how to PUt an end [Q suf-fering. Everyone wants to stop suffering. Since the immediate cause of suffering is the disturbing emotions, it is dear that in order to get rid of the three kinds of suffering, we have to eliminate the diS(urbing emo-tions. When we look for the cause of disturbing emorions, we see that it is ignorance; obviously, we have to get rid of our ignorance if we want to lose these disturbing emo tions. Remember that ignorance began with noc seeing dharmata, the true nature of our mind. So the remedy for ignorance is evident: seeing our mind's true nature. If we see the true narure of dharmara, then ignorance and bewilder-ment will vanish. Within the sutras, which emphasize vastness, we would refer to this narure as the dharmata, the nature of all things, often explained as the unity of space and wisdom. Within [he secret mantra, or the Vajrayana, which emphasizes profundity and not so much the vaSl scope of the mind's nature, we would refer to this as [he narure of our mind. We can also think of our mind as the narure of the sixth con-sc iousness or the nature of the eighth consciousness. In either case, it is through looking at the nature of our mind that ignorance will be removed. We are bewildered and ignoram, because we have never looked into and realized this true nature. If we d irectly recognize it, we will eliminate ignorance, which is like the seed, and so the seedling will nor grow, the stalk will nor appear, and the branches will not develop."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"74 A SONG FOR THE KING TRANSCENDING ANALYSIS 20.

This verse is concerned with the relationship between the wisdom aris-ing from hearing and contemplation and then from meditation. It is concerned with showing that the wisdom of meditation is more impor-tant than the wisdom of hearing and the wisdom of contemplation. By cultivating these twO, we can establish that emptiness is the nature of phenomena. To do this we employ various modes of logical analysis to show that coarse external objects are merel y collections or aggregates of the subtle objects and that subtle objects themselves are aggregates and so on until we show that things have no true existence. This argument based on the aggregates can also be applied to the mind to show that it does not exist as the entil)' it appears to be. In the con-text of hearing and thinking, there are the four or five great logical argu-ments within the Middle Way school. These arguments are the refutation of things being truly one or many, the refutation of production through the four extremes, and so forth. Going through these logical arguments definitely helps us to understand emptiness. But this process only pro-duces an intellectual certainl)'.

What kind of med-itation is this? If you meditate on emptiness, is it a form of tranquiliry meditation? What kind of meditation is it if you have analyzed a thing? What to do when you meditate like that? Rinpoche: Inferential valid cognition establishes the view through ana-lyzing the lack of existence of the object. This meditation is helpful because by gradually becoming certain that an object is not real, you will be less likely to be fixated on it. But inferential valid cognition is not sufficient to bring about liberation. In order to achieve liberation, we need to apply the techniques of meditation, which are based on direct valid cognition. When a thought arises repeatedly-whether it is a thought of attachment or dislike or anything else-if you apply the approach of direct valid cognition, you do not consider what the thought is about, nor do you attempt to analyze the object of thought to determine its reality or unrealiry. In direct valid cogniti on, you look at the {hought itself. We generally tend to think that thoughts arise and, after they have arisen, they are truly present. In this method of looking directly at the th ought, we look to see how and where it ar ises, how and where it abides, then where it dissolves.

Nevertheless. the defining charac-teristic of mind is luminous clarity. So we have to say that from one per-spective. our mind is dull and obscured and from another, it is intensely lucid. Usually the mind is lucid with regard to relative truth and igno-rant of ultimate trmh. This is true because mind has two characteristics. The nature of mind is emptiness, but unlike space, the emptiness of mind is not a void or nothingness. The other defining characteristic of mind is cognitive lucidity, inseparable from the mind's emptiness. It is the cognitive lucidity of mind that is the source of the whole variety of appearance, or experience. for that mind. Ignorance arises due to the intensity of the cognitive lucidity. It is so strong that it somehow con-ceals or outshines the emptiness, and so the mind fails to recognize its own empty nature. That failure, in turn, causes us to misapprehend our expenence. It's a little bit like watching television. When we look at a television, what we are seeing are dots and colors on the screen. The vividness and clarity of these colors allows us to perceive what they are supposed to represent. When we watch a television program, we have no trouble identifying places, persons, animals, mountains, and so on.

Pursuing the path of method without the path of liberation, which leads to the recognition of mind's nature, you will not find ulti~ mate freedom and omniscience. And conversely. if the path of method is accompanied by the recognition of the mind's nature, you will come to fruition. There is a difference benveen the path of method and the path oflib~ eration in terms of recognizing the nature of mind. How is this so? The most effective way to practice the path is to integrate the path of liber~ ation with the path of method. If that is not possible, we can practice the path of liberation alone and it will still be a good and effective path. It will lead to abandoning what should be abandoned and realizing what should be realized, and therefore it will bring about the fruition of the path. On the other hand, pracricing the path of method in the complete absence of the path of liberation will not lead to any significant or wor~ thy result. In verse 21 Saraha specifically criticizes [he view that [he practice of karmamudraoo without the wisdom of mahamudra will lead to awaken~ ing. The analogy is the following. If you are in your house, you can enjoy all the good things that you have inside; however, if you sit outside your house, refusing to go inside and merely talki ng about the good things that are there. you cannot actually enjoy them. In the same way, when you attempt to practice the path of method without the path of liberation, you are like the person who is sitting outside his or her house and unable to enjoy all the things you describe.

This stanza is not so dif-ferent from the previous stanzas that dealt with not relying solely on the conceptual certainty derived from the logical reasoning and the wisdom born of hearing or reRection. Of greater importance than conceptual certainty is direct realization. which arises from meditation. In the same way. the practice of mahamudra is more important than the practice of the methods ofkarmamudra or the channels. winds. and drops.

Just as Brahmins make their burnt offerings Of ghee and rice in a blazing fire, Know that, from Hmp, the quintessence of space, the substance of nectar produces experience; The passing experience of bliss is grasped as reality. The third instruction concerning what to avoid is not to become attached to minor experiences. There are two parts to this verse. The analogy is given in the first two lines and the meaning in the second two. The Brahmins' burnt offerings are an analogy for the incorrect prac-rice of the path of method. It is the custom of Brahmins to make fire offerings without cultivating samadhi or performing any kind of visual-ization. Proud of being the highest caste in Indian society, they simply assume that igniting these substances and saying the ritual words will be of benefit so they burn substances such as ghee and rice to make offer-ings to the gods. If the practice of burnt offerings is accompanied by one-pointed con-centration (samadhi) and visualization, it can be useful. But if it is just setting food ablaze, it will not lead to anything. The offerings do get burned up, but aside from that, there is no other real result. This example can also refer to practicing the path of method without any realization of emptiness. If we practice the path of method, then through the power of the techniques themselves, we can indeed cause the nectar to descend from the essence of space or the Harp syllable within our head.

As we have seen, our palh consisls of gaLiu;:riJlg Liu;: LWU au.;uJIlulalium uf mt:rir and wisdom, which assist one another. For example, on the path of a bodhisattva, the first five of the six perfections---generosity, morality, patience, diligence, and meditation--enable the development of the sixth, the perfection of intelligence or wisdom. Because these perfections are joined with wis-dom, they become pure and transcendent. We should not think, there-fore, that this verse says that the practices involving conceptualization are to be utterly dismissed. We do make offerings to the Three Jewels, give generously to the needy, maintain moral discipline, cultivate patience, and so on. All of these practices are important branches of the concep-tual accumulation of merit. Our practice does not consist only of med-itation on the mind's nature in isolation from anything else. We might incorrectly think that the great Brahmin 5araha has taught that all conceptual practices are utterly useless. That would be a misun-derstanding. These practices are actually very useful. But the point of practicing the perfections is the realization of mahamudra. The great Santideva in A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Lifewrites: \"These five branches were taught by the Buddha for the sake of wisdom.\" In other words, we cultivate the conceptual accumulation of merit to realize mahamudta, to achieve the nonconceptual accumulation of wisdom. In fact, consciously cultivating the conceptual accumulation of merit is necessary to develop wisdom. But while we are accumulating this merit, we must join it with the nonconceptual accumulation of wisdom. Oth-erwise, Santideva says, ~ln the absence of wisdom, the other five virtues do not become perfections because they lack the perfection of wisdom.\""},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"84 A SONG FOR THE KING So thiS verse points Out that while it is valuable to perform practices, such as burnr offerings, on me path of method, they should always be conjoined with mahamudra experience. In the Collected SUtTas,4l the following analogy is presented by the Buddha: \"If sightless people were gathered tOgether in an empty valley and tried to find their way in to tOwn, they would not be able to discover it and would wander around aimlessly. But if one person with sight were to accompany them, they could easily reach the town.\" In the same way, like sightless people, the five perfections on their own are limited; they can lead only to temporary well-being and prosperity, but not to full awakening. But just as one person wit h sight can lead a large crowd of blind people to their destination, the sixth perfection joined with the other five causes them to become an effective means for the achieve-ment of enlightenment. In the same way, the great Brahmin Saraha indi-cates that these practices alone will not lead to awakening unless they are joined with the practice of mahamudra. Many of us have experienced this in our practice. Students have come [ 0 me and said that they are very interested in and devoted to the practice of meditation, that they are diligent and really trying, but do nOt seem to be making progress and have become dissatisfied. When they say there is no improvement, the reason may be that their medi-tation needs to be supplemented with the accumulation of merit.

With our speech, we can do liturgical practice and mantra repetition. With our mind, we can meditate on compassion. With our wealth we can engage in acts of generosity.

Some make the firelight burn and bring it to their fontanel; With their tongue mey enjoy union with the smaller one. This binds them up and makes them thoroughly disturbed. Swayed by pride, they call themselves yogis. Here, Saraha describes the incorrect practice of inner heat [hat is more characteristic of non-Buddhist traditions. This physical technique creates me blazing of fire from the abdomen, which causes the subtle drops to descend from the rap of one's head and land on one's tongue, produc-ing a state of great pleasure. U However, if [his is not motivated by the wish to realize mahamudra and not combined with its practice, the expe-rience of the pleasure of inner heat alone will only lead to attachment to that bliss. Meditation practice should create something more than mere attach-ment to such experiences, and the verse describes the negative result of such techniques: The practitioners become thoroughly di sturbed and obsessed with an anachmem, which they have created for this experi-ence. Not only do they become obsessed, they also develop pride, because they think that their experience is very special and that it allows rhem to call themselves yogis.

Not knowing how to appraise a gem, the ignorant Single out the color green to say that some trinket is an emerald. This verse addresses the topic of self·awareness.<16 The term is used in several different contexts in Buddhism. In the study of valid cognition and in some Middle Way school contexts, it is said that self·awareness exists, meaning that one can know what one is experiencing. In other presentations of the Middle Way, it is said that self·awareness is impos. sible: the mind being aware of itself resembles a sword being able to cut itself or a strong man being able to lift himself. But in maharnudra and similar teachings, the term Jelfawareness means something else. It refers to self·aware wisdom47 rhar is nondual. So we seem to have three can· textS for this term; first, that of valid cognition, where essemially self· awareness seems to be a relative truth; second , where it appears to be refuted as an ultimate truth; and third. in the teachings of mahamudra, where it is asserted to be the pinnacle of the view. At first glance these three presentations may seem to be in conflict, but in fact they are not. For example, when we are practicing tranquility meditation, culti· vating mindfulness and alertness, at some point we become aware t hat our mind is at rest. This awareness is merely awareness of what our mind is experiencing at that moment. This is a valid experience for tranquil. ity meditation, but in itself, it is nor of much use in the practice of insight meditation. The self·aware wisdom (hat is sought in the practice of insight is dif· ferent. It is not merely the mind's ability to know what it is experienc. ing; rather, it is the mind actually recognizing and directly experiencing"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 87 its own nature. Now that nature, as mentioned earlier, is emptiness, bur it is nor JUSt emptiness, because the mind also has the ability ro cognize. So the experience is of the unity of cognitive lucidity and emptiness. which is sometimes called the unity of expanse and wisdom. This recog-nition and experience is entirely different from the mind being aware of what it is experiencing, such as being at rest or moving. The self-awareness in terms of valid cognition is simply the capacity of any cognition to experience itself in the most basic sense. According to valid cognition, each of the eight consciousnesses (the five sensory consciousnesses. the mental consciousness, the afflicted consciousness. and the alaya consciousness) has this ability to be self-aware, which is simply the fact that a consciousness is not concealed from itself For example, this means that you know what has arisen in your mind with-OUt having to ask anyone else or without having [0 deduce it; you just experience it. This is what self-awareness means in the basic context of valid cognition. You know what you see with your eye consciousness. However, you do not know what arises in the minds of Q(hers o r what they see, so you have to ask them what they are thinking. By COntrast. you know what is in your own mind without having to ask yourself what you are thinking, and you do not need to follow a process of deduc-tion to figure it out. This self-awareness is on the mundane level, mean-ing that it is limited to the world of relative truth. This is not the self-aware wisdom spoken of in mahamudra. The Middle Way school's presentation of self-awareness is given. for example. in Candrakirti's EnUring the Middle mzy and Santideva's Guitk to the Bodhisattva's Way o/Lifl, both of which coneain refutations of self-awareness. But the self-awareness refuted in these texts is one that can-not possibly exist. Further, it is not the self-awareness described in texts o n valid cognition. nor is it the self-aware wisdom discussed in the mahamudra teachings. What is refuted in the Middle Way school is self-awareness in the sense of the mind being able to see itself as an object"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"88 A SONG FOR THE KING that is mher to itself. This argument negates a self-awareness that would arise from having the duality of a separate subject and object. This kind of self-awareness is refuted using analogies such as the impossibility of a sword cutting itself. Now this is very different from the self-aware wisdom of mahamudci that is free of subject and object. This self-aware wisdom of mahamudci is not the mind seeing itself as an object of perception that would be a solid or substantial thing. In the practice of cutring through the ego (Tib. chii) we say, \"Homage to the Great Mother Prajfiaparamita, who is the experience of self-aware wisdom.\" This means that self-aware wis-dom occurs when the mind sees its own primordial freedom from sam-saric or substantial existence: the mind sees its own nature, which from the very beginning is free. This freedom from existence is not a noth~ ingncss or a voidness, because cognitive lucidity is present at the same time. Since mind's nature has this inherent wisdom, it can cognize and therefore it can cognize itself. In that this nature knows itself, it is with-out the duality of viewer and viewed. This is the self~awareness spoken of in mahamudra. The verse describes the situation of someone who has an experience of self-awareness and taking it to be self~aware wisdom recognizing the true nature of the mind, proudly explains th is experience to others. It could have been an experience of ordinary self-awareness on the level of relative (Cuth as described in valid cognition, or it could be a mistaken view of the existence of self-awareness that is refuted in the Middle Way school. In either case, it is not the true experience of self-aware wisdom. Making the mistake of taking simple awareness of your mind for the experience of the mind's nature leads you to assume that this alone will liberate you. When speaking to others you might say, \"Whatever binds, that itself liberates.\" The distinction the practitioner fails to make is that the self-aware wisdom described in mahamudra is not merely the experience of the"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 89 mind as it normally is. It is the recognition of the mind's true nature. The simple experience of the mind is the self-awareness described in valid cognition. But the recognition of the mind's nature is seeing or experi-encing the mind's emptiness and at the same time. experiencing the mind's cognitive lucidity. inseparable from that emptiness. Self-aware wisdom is the wisdom of the direct experience of emptiness and lucid-ity. Experiencing the unity of emptiness and lucidity will liberate you, but merely being aware of your mind will not. The analogy for mistaking mere self-awareness for self-aware wisdom is mistaking a green trinket for an emerald. What they have in common is the color green, juSt as what self-awareness and self-aware wisdom have in common is self-awareness. Aside from the color, there is a great difference between a trinket and an emerald. Mistaking one for the Q[her simply means that you do not know what the characteristics of an emer-ald are.

There-fore it is said, \"Temporary experiences are like mist; they will vanish.\" It is also said, \"If you have become attached to positive experiences, such as bliss, lucidity, and nonconceptuality, you lack the view.\" Experiences can sometimes be very positive, like the three just mentioned. But if you are caught by these passing experiences and think they should be maintained, you have lost the view. Why? Because having these experi-ences is not the purpose of meditation. The point of meditation is to rec-ognize the nature of the mind. Therefore, the second line of this verse states that holding on to such experiences will not help you, because you cannot accomplish the ultimate aim of meditation. For example, when Campopa was studying under the supervision of Milarepa, he had many different experiences and visions because he was working with the subtle channels and winds. Sometimes Campopa saw the mandalas of various deities before him; at other times the place where he was practicing seemed to be engulfed in utter darkness. Gampopa thought, \"Since my guru is like the Buddha, I must surely ask him about my experiences, both the good and the bad ones.\" Also during this time Gampopa was having a lot of very strange and vivid dreams. When he asked Milarepa about them, Milarepa replied, \"You are a great teacher of the Kadampa and you must have heard and studied the Buddha's teach-ings extensively. Do you not remember that the Buddha said that dreams are merely illusions, that in faCt dreams exemplify the state of illusion?"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUORA 91 Was the Buddha joking when he said this?\" Milarepa went on to explain, \"When we meditate, many new experiences arise in our mind, because we are working with our mind in a new way. There is no reason to be dated by pleasant experiences or depressed by unpleasant ones.\" Then Milarepa gave an example: if you are looking at me moon and press your eyes with your fingers, you will see twO moons. Seeing [his, some might think, \"Well, most people see one moon and I see twO moons, so I must be special,\" and so they devdop a sense of pride. But there is no reason [0 be proud of simply pressing your eyes with your fingers. Upon seeing twO moons others might think, \"Most people see one moon and I see two, so there mUSt be something te rri bly wrong with me.\" But in fact, there is nothing wrong; you were just pressing your eyes. This is the analogy that Milarepa used to explain how we should rdate to the experiences in meditation. This verse gives a second analogy for attachment to temporary med-iration experiences by comparing rhem to a dream. I f we are attached to something in a dream, it obviously is nor going to last, because the dream state is so impermanent. You could say that the pleasure experi-enced in a dream has even less value, because it is even shorrer and less stable than the pleasure experienced in the waking stare. FUMer, the state of dreaming is one of added confusion, because these images in a dream come from the confused images of phenomena we experience in our waking life. It is, therefore, of no use to try to hold on to something mat happened in a dream. In me same way, when we practice medita-tion, various experiences will arise and it is important not to fixate on them or become attached. For example, a positive experience might occur in our meditation. Afterward, we reRect upon it and mink, \"I had a good experience.\" But in thinking of it as a good experience. we create the desire for this tem-porary experience to reoccur. If the next day during practice it does not reoccur, we are automatically disappointed. There is nothing wrong with"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"92 A SONG FOR THE KING the experience, which is good, but it is simply an indication that we are practicing.

The meditative state that produces th e particular experience is impermanent, and th erefore the experience is impermanent. In the same way, you cannot expect the ptoduct of med~ itation-a state of bliss mat is grounded in a certain set of aggregates-to outlast those very aggregates, which are changing momenr to moment.

This is expressed in symbolic terms, which are particular to the Vajrayana"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUORA 93 and which explain the unity of emptiness and wisdom, or the unity of wisdom and method. The symbol for this unity is the word E Vam: E represents emptiness and the unborn expanse, while Vam represents wis-dom and also method. Together these two represent the true nature, which is, on the one hand, emptiness and, on the other hand, sponta-neously present, luminous clarity. The mistaken path pointed our in this verse is thinking that the experience of doing the practice of the subtle channels, winds, and drops by itself is the ultimate E Vtzm. These prac-tices are imporcant and helpful for the ultimate realization of mahamudra. However, as explained earlier in the text, if these methods are not combined with the realization of mahamudra, or if we become attached to the experience of these methods, they become an obstacle to achieving enlightenment. Verse 27 mentions the four seals or mudras. To understand what Saraha is going to say about the four seals, we need to understand a set of four symbols and another set of four seals. The four symbols are aspects or stages of the practice and the realization of mahamudra. They are unique to Saraha's presentation of mahamudra in his cycle of three songs, to which A Songfor the Kingbelongs. The four symbols are: mind-fulness, nonminding, the unborn, and beyond the intellect. The first symbol is mindfulness, which refers to the proper cultivation of the faculty of mindfulness, or recollection, and its attendant faculty of alertness, which reins in distracrion.t'! This is practiced as a method for pacifYing the mind. Here, however, it does not just refer to tranquility meditation, because it also includes certainty about the illusory nature of phenomenon. This will be explained in detail later. The second symbol is nonminding. Through the practice of mindful-ness and alertness, the mind has come to rest, and then we go beyond this mere resting. Due to the heightening of the mind's innate cognitive lucid-ity, the mind is able to recognize the emptiness of mindfulness itself.)O Through this realization, we achieve the third symbol, which is the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"94 A SONG FOR THE KING unborn. This aspect is the recognition that aJl dharmas are empty and therefore are without any true arising-they are unborn. Finally, when realizing this third symbol, we achieve the founh symbol, which is to experience directly the dharmadharu (the expanse of aJl phenomena), completdy free of any incdlecrual contrivance or fabrication. This fourth symbol is therefore called beyond the intellect. These four symbols can be correlated with the four joys and [he four seals. The four seals are explained in this verse in two ways. The first way shows how they should be known in a correct understanding of uhimate truth. Then, indicating a second way, Saraha will return to them and criticize a misunderstanding of the four seals. To correlate these four symbols with the four joys, we begin with an ordinary state that lacks mindfulness and alertness; for this reason, we are affiicted by the disturbing emotions. This is a state of misery. Then, through {he instructions of the guru, we reach the first stage of mind-fulness, pacifying our mind and realizing the illusory nature of phe-nomena. This experience results in the joy of the first stage. When we have reached the second stage, nonminding, we realize that both mind-fulness and the nature of mind are empty. The experience of this free-dom brings about a second kind of joy, known as supreme joy, which is stronger than the first. When we reach the third stage, the unborn, we see that mindfulness, nonminding, and indeed all phenomena are unborn. This produces a much greater joy known as without joy, which means a joy so great (hat there is no longer any attachment to it. Finally, when we realize that mindfulness, nonminding, and the unborn nature can only be realized in a state beyond the intellect (Saraha's fourth symbol), then the experi-ence of the fourth joy arises, which is known as eoemergent joy. If the practices of the subtle winds and channds are done without the recog-nition of the mind's nature, one will experience these four joys as mere physical sensations."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 95 Now we can correlate these four joys and the four symbols, or stages, of Sarah a with the four seals. At the first stage of mindfulness, we see all relative truths or phenomena as they are and experience the first joy. This results in the firs[ seal, the dharma-mudra, or seal of dharmas, which mean \"phenomena\" in this context. At the second stage, non-minding, which is also supreme joy, we see the emptiness of mind's narure. This is rhe jfiana-mudra, or wisdom seaL In the third stage, the unborn, we see that both mindfulness and nonminding are unborn and thereby achieve the joy that is without attachment to joy. This is the samaya-mudra, or commitment seal. And finally, when we realize that all these previous three stages are by nature beyond the intellect, we achieve coemergem joy. This is the maha-mudci, or the great seal. H ere, the term seal is understood as the correct realization of ultimate truth. Saraha affirms that one needs to realize these four joys and four seals, which are the true meaning of E Vtzm. It is important to note that these terms, particularly the four joys and the four seals, are also applied to the physical and mental sensations that arise during the practices of the subtle channels, winds, and drops. The physical and cognitive sensations experienced at this t ime are also called joy, supreme joy, without joy, and coemergent joy. And sometimes the terminology of the four seals-the dharma seal, the wisdom seal, the samaya seal, and the great seal-are applied to results of these practices of the path of method. Saraha criticizes the use of this terminology when it is applied merely to the sensations that arise from the practices of the channels, winds, and drops. If we assume that we have experienced the fourth joy and thereby conclude we have realized coemergent wisdom, we are mistaken. If we actually do succeed in realizing coemergent wisdom through the prac-tices of the subtle channels, winds, and drops, that, of course, is fine and these practices have assumed their proper function. But the simple experience of the sensation of these four joys alone does nm constitute"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"96 A SONG FOR THE KING the realization of coemergent wisdom. Sarma smtes that confusing the mere experience of the sensation of what is commonly called coemergent joy with the true realization of coemergent wisdom is like confusing the mere reRection in a mirror for the real thing: \"Do nO[ be like the one attached to the mirror's reflection.\" As before. Saraha is nO[ arguing about the validity of using the subtle channels. winds, and drops as methods. But he is saying that if they are not used to bring realization of mahamudra, then all that they lead to is something that does not really perform any true function or have any true value. This completes the first seven of the eight verses concerned with pointing out mistaken paths. These seven verses are mainly criticizing twO things. One is the mistaken perception that the path of method alone is sufficient to bring about realization of the ultimate. The other is becoming attached ro the wisdom of hearing and reRection. The prob-lem with these two mistakes is that they prevent us from entering the authentic path. So attachment to the wisdom of hearing and reRection or to the experience ar ising from the techniques on the path of method can be an obstacle. This is not to say that the wisdom of hearing and reflection or the experience of the path of method are themselves obsta-cles. The wisdom of hearing and reRection can be very helpful, but if you become attached to them, they become an impediment. In both cases of attachment to wisdom or method, we are prevented from realizing ulti-mate truth. MISTAKING THE RElATIVE TRUTH 18. Not understanding, the deer runs In confusion after the water's mirage. Likewise, the ignorant cannot evade thirst, and die. Claiming it is ultimate, some take up bliss."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 97 This verse summarizes what is wrong with a mistaken path by using the analogy of a deer chasing after a mirage of water. The deer seeks to quench its thirst but misapprehends the shimmering mirage for water. The deer's thirst, of course, is not relieved, and it remains dissatisfied and suffering additionally from its disappointment. In the same way, if we become anached to the path of means or the wisdom of hearing and reRection as ends in themselves, we prevent them from serving dIeir true function, which is to lead us toward the realization of ultimate truth. Like the deer that remains thirsty, we remain in suffering and do not find true realization. Therefore, it say.; in the fourth line of the verse: \"Claim-ing it is ultimate, some take up bliss.\" Thinking that the experience of the bliss, the pleasure of the path of method, is ultimate. they become attached to it. Gampopa, whose tradition we follow, said that we should combine hearing, reRection, and meditation. This means that we should com-bine our study with the practice of mahamudci meditation, both dur-ing meditation sessions and in postmeditation. In this way, our understanding is not divorced from practical experience. In the same way, we engage in both practices of the path of means: the generation stage of yidam practice and the completion stage. These are very important and useful, bur they need to be practiced in a way that is not divorced from the mahimudra experience of the mind's nature. Even in posrmedir3tion, we need to combine everything with the practice of mahamudra. whether we are engaging in phy.;ical acts of virtue, such as prostration and circumambulation, or in verbal acts such as liturgical practice and mantra repetition, or in mental acts such as the cultivation of love and compassion for others. To practice all me techniques of the path of method together with mahamudra is beSt. If not, at least we should tty to practice in a way that is not devoid of mahamudra experi-ence. In that way we avoid me eight errors that Saraha has pointed out in th~ eight verses and become capable of pursuing an aumentic path."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98 A SONG FOR THE KINe The Authentic Path of Mahilmudra THE FOUR SYMBOLS IN BRIEF 29. The relative rrU[h refers [0 mindfulness; nonminoing Points to those memal states when the mind is released from mindfulness. When completely transformed. this is the supreme of the supreme. The result is the genuine supreme. Friends, you should know these. With this verse Sarma begins the s«ond parr of the path of mahamudri, which is the presemation of the genuine path. As memioned earlier, his cycle of three songs presents the authentic path using the unique set of terms called the four symbols of instruction. An overview of these four symbols is given in verse 29. The first symbol is mindfulness, or recollection. When we start [0 practice, our mind is filled with thoughts, which disturb it like waves on the surface of water. The Third Karmapa. Rangiung Dorje, in his Aspi-ration Pray\" of Mahiimzulrii, wrote: \"May the waves of coarse and subtle thoughts be pacified in their own place, and may the river of mind come [0 rest without movemem.\" How do we pacifY these waves of thought? How do we bring our mind to rest? We do this through the application of two faculties of the mind: mindfulness and a1ermess. When mindful-ness is active and keeping the m ind directed toward the focus of medita-tion, a1ermess will automatically be presem and signaling when the mind strays. By the same token, when one loses mindfulness, alertness disap-pears. So the single most important thing in the beginning of meditation practice is mindfulness. To emphasize this, Samideva wrote in A Guitk to th~ Bodhisattva's \\%y afLift: \"With joined palms I pray to all practition-ers ro rely upon mindfulness, which alone can calm the wild mind.\" Here, in this practice, we are mainly recollecting the illusory narure of phe-nomena; therefore, it is a recollection of relative truth."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 99 The second symbol is non minding. Through the practice of mind-fulness, we develop a state of mental stability and stillness. This is merely a state of tranquility and not the recognition of the mind's true nature. Therefore, we need to go further and practice the second symbol, which is non minding. This does not mean that we lose the faculty of mind-fulness; rather, it means seeing the nature of the mind, seeing the empti-ness of even mindfulness itself. This is referred to in Rangjung Dorje's Aspiration Prayer of Mahiimudrii: \"Sy looking again and again at the nature of mind which cannot be looked at, one clearly sees the meaning of what cannO[ be seen.\" So the second symbol is the samadhi of insight, or insight meditation. This second symbol arises when thoughts have been pacified through mindfulness and we begin to see the mind's nature beyond elaboration. This awareness is expanded further until we not only recognize the nature of our mind but also recognize this nature to be the true nature of all phenomena. In short, we see that they are all unborn and withoUt true arising. This is the third symbol. In the verse it states, \"%en com-pletely transformed, th is is the supreme of the supreme.\" Previously, we had recognized the mind as beyond elaboration, and now \"the supreme of the supreme\" refers to the time when that realization becomes so vast in scope that it is all-pervasive. We realize directly that this unborn qual-ity is not limited ro the nature of mind but belongs to the nature of all phenomena. This is how we recognize that all phenomena are unborn, which leads in turn to the fourth symbol, beyond the intellect. This is referred to in the fourth line, which states, \"The result is the genuine supreme.\" The genuine supreme is the complete realization, beyond the intellect, of the nature of all phenomena. It is these four symbols of the authentic path that Saraha says we should know: mindfulness, non-minding, the unborn, and beyond the intellect."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"100 A SONG FOR THE KING THE SYMBOLS, JOYS, SEALS, AND SAMADHIS 2 3 4 Saraha's Four Symbob mindfulness nonminding the unborn beyond the intellect The Four Joys joy supreme joy without toy coemergent joy The Four Seals (Mudr1) Dharma ~al wisdom seal samaya seal great seal The Four Samldhis sam.ldhi of samAdhi of heroic vajralike iIIusion,Iike the lion's play sam~dhi samadhi phenomena In a more detailed explanation of hi s four symbols, Saraha identifies them with the four one-pointed meditative concentrations or samadhis described by the Buddha in the suttas. (See table above.) The four samadhis are the samiidhi of illusion-like phenomena, the samadhi of the lion's play, the heroic samadhi, and the vajralike samadhi. The first, the samadhi of illusion-like phenomena, refers to the first stage of mindful-ness, which is seeing the illusory nature of relative truth. The second symbol is nonminding. At that point, we further see that relative appear-ances have no Hue existence, that they are mere play or d isplay. In this way, we achieve the samadhi of the lion's play. The third symbol, the unborn, is the achievement of the state beyond fear, because we recog-nize the unborn nature of all things, and therefore it is the culmination of the heroic samadhi. And the fourth symbol, the realization of that which is beyond the intellect, is indestructible realization; it is therefore the result of vajralike samadhi. This concludes a brief explanation of how the four symbols are related to the four samadhis.'l In the next four verses, Saraha will explain these four samadhis in detail. However, when he dot:,) ,)u, lie d~s not follow the order [hat he has previously used (mindfulness, nonminding, the unborn, and beyond the intellect). Instead Saraha starts with nonminding, then rerurns to mindfulness, followed by the unborn, and finally, beyond the intellect."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 101 It could be that he presents nonminding in the beginning so that we do not merely cultivate a state of tranquility meditation. Before beginning the proper practice of mindfulness, we have become somewhat familiar with the mind's nature through the presentation of nonminding. Hav-ing gained a sense of what it is, we are able to stabilize this through the subsequent practice of mindfulness. THE SECOND SYMBOL: NONMINDING 30. The mind released from mindfulness engages in samidhi. It is completely purified of the afflictions. As the utpala born from a swamp is not stained by it, So the mind itself is not affected by the faults arising from samsara nor by the qualities found in the Victorious One. In verse 30, Saraha presents the practice of nonminding, which IS identified with the samadhi of the lion's play. When we begin to prac-tice tranquility on the path of mahamudra, we start with the recogni-tion of the mind's nature. Because of this, the practice of meditation is not devoid of wisdom; from the very beginning, it is endowed with the wisdom that comes from meditation. Nonminding resembles the behav-ior or play of a lion, because just as a lion terrifies and overpowers all other wild animals, nonminding (meaning here the recognition of the mind's nature) overpowers and defeats all mental afflictions. In the first line, \"The mind released from mindfulness engages in samadhi,\" Saraha affirms that we begin with the faculty of mindfulness. We are released from it because we have recognized the natute of mind, which brings freedom from the disturbing emotions. The mind is com-pletely purified. This does not mean, however, that one solid thing is overpowering another solid thing. Nonminding is a deep insight into the nonexistence of the disturbing emotions, and this is what conquers"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 A SONG FOR THE KING them. In the next rwo lines, Saraha gives an analogy to illustrate this meaning: \"As the utpala born from a swamp is not stained by it, so the mind itself is not affected by the faults arising from samsara nor by the qualities found in the VictOrious One.n The utpala is a blue lotus Rower, which grows in the mud. In sustaining its purity, regardless of the nature of its environment, the utpala resembles nonminding or insight intO the nature of mind. THE FIRST SYM80L: THE PRACTICE OF MINDFULNESS 31. Mindfulness also sees with certainty that all things are like an illusion. Transcending the world, take this moment into your mind and rest evenly in meditation. Those whose minds recognize the teaching bind up ignorance. Self-arising and inconceivable, wisdom naturally abides within. As we saw in the brief presentation, non minding is presented first and mindfulness second, because even though we have gained some insight into the mind's nature, that experience cannot simply be left as it is or abandoned; it has to be cultivated. Dakpo Tashi Namgyal wrote, \"The cultivation of this insight requires sharp and lucid mindfulness and alert-ness.\" After initially recognizing the mind's nature, which is beyond mindfulness, we still need to apply the faculty of mindfulness to stabi-lize that recognition. This is probably the reason Saraha has presented nonminding first and then the practice of mindfulness. Due to this change in order, the faculty of mindfulness here is different. Since it suc-ceeds the recognition of nonminding, it is free of fixation and therefore sees the illusory nature of things. The first line of the verse states: \"Mind-fulness also sees with certainty that all things are like an iUusion.\" Of the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 103 four types of samadhi, it is the Elm, the samadhi of illusion-Like phe-nomena, that is relevant here. Having recognized the narure of the mind, or mahamudrii, we must take the next step and stabilize that state of recognition. Progress in the practice depends upon cultivating facuhies of mindfulness and alert-ness, which are lucid and sharp. If we do not maintain them, or if they are not intense enough, we will not be able to Cut through the under-current of OUf thoughts. This undercurrent refers to thoughts that are not superficially evident but can persist unnoticed and adulterate our meditation. Furthermore, if we get used to allowing these conceptual undercurrents to continue, our samiidhi will eventually become defec-tive and this will prevent progress. Maintaining lucid and sharp mind-fulness and alertness allows for greater progress. The reason the pr.l.crice of mindfulness is correlated with the samiidhi of illusion-like phenomena is that through practicing nonminding, we have recognized the mind's nature. Since this is a basic recognition of dharmata. (here is no fixation on the reality of the meditative state or the faculty of mindfulness that is being cultivated. It is all seen as a magical illusion. THE THIRD SYMBOL: THE UNBORN 32. These empty appearances have the nature of clarity; from the very first they are unborn. They do not arise as an entity with form; discard as well thinking they arise in the aspect of form's characteristics. Abide continually within the mind itself and practice only deep meditation. Without thought, rest in this meditation free of mental activity and free of Raws."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"104 A SONG FOR T~IE KING The practice of the third symbol, the unborn, is mainly a meditation on emptiness. This is a high level of experience and realization, but it is nO[ the ultimate realization. For example, followers of the Middle Way school study what it means to be empty of self, and this is similar to [he re:lli7.::1-tion of the unborn. This is followed by the study of what it means to be empty of other, or the emptiness of phenomena. It explains that empti-ness is not JUSt empty; emptiness is also the spontaneous presence of wis-dom within each and every being. The emptiness of phenomena and the spontaneous presence of wisdom may seem like very high teachings, and therefore very distant from our ordinary experience. In mahamudra med-itation, however, this same sugatagarbha, the seed of enlightenment, is presented in such a way that it does not seem distant from our ordinary experience. Sugatagarbha is the mind's cognitive lucidity, or the mind's innate wisdom, and the seed of all the qualities ofbuddhahood. Through the practice of mindfulness and nonminding, we come to reaJize the third symbol, the unborn. This is the realization that all appearances from the very beginning have been without birth o r true arising. It is traditionally said that mahimudra realization is devoid of the three conditions and beyond the four joysY \"Without the three con-ditions\" means that mahamudra medication is independent of the three experiences of bliss, cognitive lucidity, and nonconceptuality. Whereas most meditative states are dependent upon one or more of these, mahamudra is not. While most other meditative states are considered conditioned, mahamudra is not. Therefore, mahamudra is unborn from the beginning, and so it neither abides nor ceases. Furthermore, in referring to empty appearances, the second line States, \"They do not arise as an entity with form; discard as well thinking they arise in the aspect of form's characteristics.\" Mahamudra has no form. When you look directly at your mind, you do nOt detect any shape or color. This means that the mind's nature has no form, and further, that"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"I'ATH MAHAMUDRA 105 it does not possess any of the characteristics of form or solidity either. In this way mahamudra is shown to be unborn. What exactly is the unborn nature of phenomena? While in ultimate truth nothing truly exists, in rebtive truth various appearances do arise. If we examine these appearances, we will see that their nature is the unity of emptiness and appearance. The same is true of experiences within the mind, such as medimrive states of bliss. If we look at the nature of bliss, we will see that it is empty. Since we are experiencing bliss, this is the unity of bliss and emptiness. Furthermore, the capacity to recognize, to know, or to be aware is characteristic of the unborn mind. If we look at this awareness and see its emptiness, that is the unity of awareness and empti-ness. Finally, the mind's lucidity is also empty, so there is the unity of lucidity and emptiness. T hese four unities are the meaning of the unborn nature: appearance-emptiness, bliss-emptiness, awareness-emptiness, and lucidity-emptiness. The instruction here is to rest in just this: \"Abide con-tinually within the mind itself and practice only deep meditation. n We do this without thought, without mental activity, which means that we rest free of any dualistic differentiation berween that which is meditating or observing and that which is meditated upon. When we realize the unborn nature (emptiness), then the cause of suffering (the di sturbing emotions) and its resuh (suffering) cease. As a result, we are liberated from misery, fear, sadness, regret, and anxiety. These are all eradicated, leaving us fearless. For this reason, the samadhi realizing the unborn was called the heroic samadhi, because achieving it, we are no longer afraid of anything. THE FOURTH SYMBOL: BEYOND THE INTELLECT 33. Intellect, mind, and mental appearances have this very nature. All the worlds appearing in their diversity have this very nature."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"106 A SONG FOR THE KING All the varieties of the seen and the seer have this very natute. Attachment, desire, aversion, and bodhicirta. too, have this very nature. At the level of the fourth symbol, one realizes that the nature of the mind is not only beyond existence but also beyond nonexistence-it is completely beyond the inteUect. Since this is attained through direct experience, it transcends any conceptual apprehension of existence or nonexistence and is the direct experience of the true nature just as it is, beyond any kind of extreme. It is, therefore. the ultimate samadhi. This fourth symbol transcends even the realization of the unborn described in the previous verse. It is the vajralike samadhi, or the ulti-mate samadhi. One passes through various states: (I) thoughts arising in the mind are apprehended by mindfulness; (2) mindfulness is dissolved into the expanse beyond mindfulness; (3) within that expanse occurs the realization of th e unborn; (4) and finally even that is transcended, so that \"Intellect, mind, and mental appearances have this very nature.\" This is what is meant when it is said that this nature, or dharmata, is beyond the intellect, beyond mind, and beyond all mental appearances while remaining the nature of them all. The third line, \"All the varieties of the seen and the seer have this very nature,\" means that th ough this nature is beyond the dualism of seer and seen, all phenomena have this nature. This is how to understand the nature that is beyond the intellect. The fourth line of this verse states that bodhicitta also has this very nature. In general, bodhicitta has two aspects: relative and absolute. Rel-ative bodhicitta is the wish to protect and alleviate the suffering of all beings. In essence, it is compassion that has an aspect of wisdom. This verse is speaking of absolute bodhicitta, which recognizes the true nature of all things. It also has an aspect of compassion, because the realization of the nature of all phenomena spontaneously produces an extraordinary compassion for all beings. This compassion is exuemely powerful"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA 107 because it is unfabricated. This completes an explanation of the fourth symbol, beyond the intellect. The next question about the path that needs to be answered is, How do we stare to practice these four symbols? We start mrough me grad-ual cultivation of the wisdom of listening, comempladon, and medita-tion. Why do we need listening? Although we all possess sugatagarbha, or buddha nature, we are unaware of it. Since we do not know it is there, we have to be told that all sentient beings including ourselves have buddha nature. An analogy for this is presented in the Uttaratantra where it explains that our buddha nature, which is basically a synonym for the sugatagarbha, is like buried gold. Imagine that a large piece of gold was buried underground, covered with dirt and refuse of all kinds. The gold itself would not change at all, even though a hundred or a thousand years passed. Nevertheless, no one would take advantage of it because it was hidden. Eventually, a poor person comes along and builds his shack directly over the gold. The gold could alleviate his poverty, but since he does not know it is there in the first place, he makes no use of the gold and suffers.

H e gives th is advice because we are ordinary beings at the very beginning of the path and do not under-stand the nature of our mind. In order to be able to entertain this idea and eventually realize it, we must initially encounter either the Buddha's teachings or the commentaries on these teachings, which are found in many texts and in the practical instructions of the mahasiddhas, such as this song of Saraha. Of course, we have the nature of our mind within us, but we do not have access to this nature, because we follow our own confused projections and bewildered appearances. We are immersed in these incorrect thoughts and cannot reverse the bewilderment by our-selves, since it is our own bewilderment. The first line of the verse states: \"A lamp is lit in the darkness of ignorance.\" In this analogy, the lamp is the fact that the gold is there, that buddha nature exists. This is the beginning of the process of remov-ing ignorance. Understanding what we have heard is th e achievement of the wisdom of hearing, and it startS with encounter ing the Buddha's teachings. Nevertheless, this initial hearing and the wisdom generated through it are not enough. We need to scrutinize and evaluate what has been heard. This is the wisdom of contemplation, which generates conceptual certainty. The verse states: \"While you differentiate mental cate-gories, ... \"which refers to a conceptual state of the mind and this can-not in itself remove defects or bewilderment, nor can it generate true wisdom. Therefore, after the wisdom of contemplation, we need to go further and cultivate the wisdom that arises from meditation.

There is no negating, no constructing, And no apprehending: it is inconceivable. The ignorant are bound by mental categories. The inseparable, m e coemergent, is utterly pure. The previous verse was an explanation of the entire process of hearing, reRection, and meditation in brief. Since the most important of these three is the practice of meditation, the next two verses continue to explain it in more detail. Verse 35 explains that all we need to do is recognize the mind's nature; there is no need to eliminate anything from it, nor is there any need to construct some kind of logical reasoning to realize mind's nature. This same idea is explain ed in the Uttaratantra: \"There is nothing to be removed from this and there is nothing to be added.\" \"There is nothing to be removed\" means that when we look at our mind's nacure, we are not anempting to eliminate something from it. There is nothing solid or negative that needs to be taken out, or, as the verse says, \"There is no negating.\" Second, when meditating, we are not attempting to add to or improve the mind's nature: there is \"no constructing.\" Since the nature itself is beyond the intellect and therefore cannot be conceptually understood, or apprehended, this nature is inconceivable. Those who seek for some-thing to be negated, something to be constructed, something to be apprehended, or something to be conceptualized are referred to as \"the ignorant\" because they are bound by these mental categories.

Questions Question: Rinpoche, you stated that practicing the path of method and the path ofliberation togethet is the most effective means of practicing. I am wondering what you meant by the path of method and why the combination is the most effective? Rinpoche: In general, it is fine to practice the path of liberation with~ out (he path of method. What I was referring to when I said the path of method were the methods that have been passed down in the Kagyu tradition from Tilopa and Naropa to the present day. In the Kagyti tra~ dition, the path ofliberation is defined as mahamudra, and the path of method refers to the six yogas of Naropa. However, in this context the six yogas of Naropa would also include doing yidam practices, which must precede them. Marpa the Translator went to India three times. H e said of what he brought back, \" I received Hevajra, the profound tantra, and Cakrasaf!1~ vara, the quintessence.\" By referring to CakrasaI1wara as the quintessence, it is evident he considered it to be the most profound of these cycles of practice.

You can also understand the six yogas of Naropa as the completion stage of bmh Vajrayogini and Cakrasaf!lvara.

M y own expe-rience has been that the path is very gradual, sometimes you click in and so metimes you click out. Sometimes you click out for a long time and then come back in again. Rinpoche: There is a difference between proceeding through the path to enlightenment by means of the profound path of the Vajrayana, or secret mantra, and the vast path of a bodhisattva. For example, we can com-pare two individuals, both of whom achieved perfect awakening, the Buddha and Milarepa. Sakyamuni Buddha gathered the accumulations for t hree innumerable eons and achieved buddhahood. Milarepa achieved the state of Vajradhara in o ne lifetime and one body. What they achieved in terms of their wisdom mind and what they realized are not different: whatever the Buddha saw, Milarepa saw. Whatever the Buddha abandoned, Milarepa abandoned. However, their paths were different in the way that th eir fruition manifested. Because the Buddha achieved full awakening through the innumerable eons of practice, when he achieved it , his body was adorned with the thirty-two marks and eighty signs of physical perfection; his speech was embellished with the sixty limbs of mdody; and hi s activity was both perfect and pervasive."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"PATH MAHAMUDRA II) Milarepa realized the same thing that the Buddha realized, but because of the difference in the merit accumulated, Milarepa's body was not adorned with the thirty-two marks and eighty signs, did not possess the sixty branches of melody, and his activity was not identical to that of Sakyamuni Buddha. The wisdom was the same, but there was a differ-ence in the manifestation of the result, which is due to the difference in the manner of gathering the accumulations or, you could say, in the length and stability of the paths. When you see the nature of your mind, you are realizing dharmata. A first-level bodhisattva realizes dharmata and achieves a state that will not reven to a lower level. Although we realize the same nature that is realized by a first-level bodhisattva on the vast path of the Mahayana, the circumstances, means, or conditions for our realization are different. Because we achieved this insight through what is called abrupt intro-duction, we do not achieve the state of irreversibility the way a bodhi-sattva would by realizing dharmata. In sum, the nature that is seen by a mahamudra practitioner is the same as the nature seen by a nrst-level bodhisattva on the path of the Mahayana, but the qualities that come with those insights are different."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Fruition Mahamudra 5 ______ • ·::~::~~·~'::!:~·~·l'JE A Songfor the King has three main sections, presenting the ground, the path, and the fruition. We have come to the third, the fruition of mahamudra, which in turn has three sections. I will go through these three sections brieRy, and there is a reason for doing so. The first section of the ground must be dearly explained. When we are attempting to ascertain the nature of the ground, it is essential that it be properly understood, because it is rhe basis of the path. In the same way, to achieve the result, the path must be properly understood so that we can correctly proceed along it and avoid mistakes. The fruition is something that we either attain or do not attain as a result of the path. It is some-what simpler to talk about, as it requires less explanation. Primordial Wisdom Expands through Bliss 37. Through attaining the vast land of happiness, And through seeing its own nature, mind becomes vast. You walk through the land, yet mind's nature is not separate. The first of the three topics within the presentation of the fruition is how primordial wisdom expands when we attain great bliss. As we have seen, if we realize the nature of our mind, we are liberated from samsara. This \"5"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"116 A SONG FOR. THE KING constitutes the perfect accomplishment of benefit for oneself, and it also creates the causal condition for the complete accomplishment of benefit for others. Due to these two benefits, we experience consummate joy, and this joy is also the expansion of wisdom. In general, the qualities of a buddha are defined as wisdom, love. and ability. Wisdom is twofold: a buddha possesses the wisdom that knows the nature of phenomena and the wisdom that knows the variety of phe~ nomena. The wisdom that knows the true nature of phenomena is the fact that the buddha directly sees dharmata . At the same time, a buddha also sees the individual joys and sufferings of each living being, and this is the wisdom of the variety of phenomena. Buddhas are not only wise. Through their possession of perfect wis~ dom, they also have perfect loving~kindness for all beings. If the buddhas possessed only the twO wisdoms and had no ability to benefit others, the situation would be quite different. But since they possess both consum~ mate wisdom and perfect loving~kindness, they also possess the perfect ability to benefit and protect others. This explanation of the three qual~ ities ofbuddhahood fills out the basic definition of fruition mahiimudra. All of the sufferings of samsara are due to confused projections or confused appearances. When we recognize that these are empry, we erad-icate both the cause and the result of suffer ing, and this leads to an expe~ rience of great bliss. The song states, \"Through attaining the vast land of happiness,\" which refers to an all~pervasive state of great bl iss. Through attaining this and \"through seeing its own nature, m ind becomes vast.\" This experience of a boundless state of great btiss-although it is in one sense a ground or object of experience-is not sep~ arate from the mind that experiences it; therefore, the mind itself is vast. From a relative point of view, we experience this state of great of bliss as though it were an environment or a land we are walking th rough. In actualiry, however, since this environment or state of great bl iss has always been the nature of our mind and the nature of all things, we are"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"FR.UITION MAHAMUDR.A 117 inseparable from it. Therefore, the verse concludes, \"Yet mind's nature IS nm separate. Delineating the Five Kayas 38. Coemergent joy is me dharmakaya. The sambhogakaya is the seedling of joy And superior; the leaves come forth. At the time of the path, the dharmakaya does not radiate in the ten directions. Bliss free of constructs is fruition itself. The second topic within fruition is delineating me five kiyas through the dharmakaya's emanation of two form kayas. This leads to an expanded layout of the dharmakaya, which accounts for the spontaneous presence of the five kayas. The verse begins, \"Coemergent joy is the dharmakaya.\" The ultimate result has a variety of qualities, and the distinctions among these qualities are the divisions of the various bodies. The primary and usual division of the kayas is into the dharmakaya, the sambhogakaya, and the nirmaryalciya. Of these three, the dharmakaya is the perfect accomplishment of benefit for oneself, while the sambhogakaya and nirmal)akaya are the perfect accomplishment of benefit for others. In his so ng, Saraha speaks of five different kayas, of which the initial three represent aspects or qualities of the dharmakaya: innate wisdom, natu-ral purity, and great bliss. First, it is important to understand the quality of being innate. The dharmakaya is not newly acquired at the dme of fruition, nor is it some-thing created by the path. It is the narure of mind from the very begin-ning. Further, its wisdom transcends the intellect, which operates in a dualistic mode of perception. The second quality is the natural purity of the dharmakaya, which is given the name sviibhiillikakiiya. From"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"uS A SONG FOR THE KING beginningless time, it is essentially pure and has never been stained. The third quality reflects the fact that the dharmakaya is not a state of noth-ingness nor is it suffering; it is a state of great bliss, and therefore it is also called the body of grear bliss, or mahtisukhakiiya. In this way, we can divide the dharmakaya inro irs qualities of innate wisdom, natural purity, and great bliss, and say there are three kayas, but actually, these three bodies arc all gualities or aspects of the dharmalciya. While the dharmakaya of the Buddha realizes dharmata, he displays the two form bodies in order to communicate with others. To benent those with pure perception (th e bodhisattvas), the dharmalciya displays the sambhogakaya. To help ordinary beings, it displays the supreme nirmal).akaya, such as Sakyamuni Buddha. To summarize, when we attain coemergent wisdom and the dharma-kaya, it does not mean that the dharmakaya is created by our achieve-ment of coemergent wisdom. It has always been purely present and is simply recognized. Since the dharmakaya is innate and not newly created, it is also called the svabhavikakaya, or essence body, which is the second body. The state of dharmakaya is the state of coemergem joy, and since it is free of all suffering whatsoever, it is also the mahasukhakaya, or the body of great bliss. Now these three-the dharmakaya, svabhavika-kaya, and mahasukhakaya----can be considered three bodies Ot they can be considered one, the dharmakaya. The next twO kayas, the fourth and nfth, are the form kayas: the sam-bhogakiiya and the nirmii!Jakiiya. The sambhogakaya is \"the seedling of joy,\" where \"joy\" refers to the state of great bliss, a quality of the dharma-kaya. The \"seedling\" emerging from it is the sambhogakaya, which is \"superior\" to the nirma~akaya. Why is this so? The sambhogakaya appears only to individuals with pure faculties (bodhisattvas), while the nirmal)akaya appears to those who have ordinary faculties and are not so pure. The sambhogakaya is the initial emanation of the dharmakaya, as a seedling first appears, and then the nirma~akaya emanates as the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"FRUITION MAHAMUDRA Il9 leaves growing from a Stalk. This is the brief explanation of the five bod-ies, which can be summarized into three. Benefit for Self and Others Is Nondual 39. Those staying in that land benefit those living there but are not truly existent. Nevertheless, there is a need that they stay in that place, benefit~ ing those beings. Artached and ultimately not anached are the form kayas; Emptiness is inseparable from appearance. The third section details the fruition of mahamudra and explains how on the level of ultimate truth, the two form bodies, or riipakiiyas, do not exist. Ultimately, buddhas and sentient beings have the same nature, and so living beings have been buddhas from the very beginning. Fur-thermore, although buddhas abide as the dharmalciya and display the form bodies, these kayas are not distinct from one another. '!'here are no rupakayas aside from the dharmakaya, and there is no dharmakaya aside from the rupakayas. In this way, the nature of any form that is displayed is emptiness, which is the very source of that display. The first line states: \"Those staying in that land benefit those living there but are not truly existent.\" in ultimate truth, the twO form bodies that benefit beings have no true or absolute existence. Further, those who are benefited by these two form bodies do not have true or ultimate existence either. Yet, as the second line states: \"Nevertheless, there is a need that they stay in that place, benefiting those beings.\" This is true because within the land of relative truth, the presence of the two form bodies brings real benefit for living beings.

While the twO form kayas appear to have dif~ ferent functions within relative truth, in ultimate truth they have no existence apart from the dharmakaya. Therefore, the fourth line states: \"Emptiness is inseparable from appearance.\" The Conclusion: What Is Flawless 40. It is not like a pig attached to the mire of samsar.l. Once you have realized the flawless mind, what fault is there? Anyone who practices like this is not affected by anything. Why would this petson be bound by flaws? The final verse completes the presentation of mahamudra's result with an explanation of how the dharmakaya, the fruition of mahamudra, is stain~ less and irreversible. The two form lciyas have come [Q realize this flawless nature of mind. Since they are the display of the dharmalciya, and since (he dhatmakiya is the realization of this stainless nature, even though they remain active in samsara, the twO form bodies are not attached to cyclic existence nor stained by it. Furthermore, the verse says: \"Anyone who practices like this is not affected by anything.\" Since this state of fruition is irreversible, when we recognize the stainless nature and attain the dharmakaya, that realization renders us impervious to any condi~ tions. Therefore, the rhetorical question is asked, \"Why would this per~ son be bound by flaws?\" Why would you think this individual would be bound, since the potential for being fettered has been eradicated? This verse brings to a close the explanation of Saraha's A Songfor th~ King.

It was translated from the Indian original into Tibetan by the bilingual Nepali, Lama Asu."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Appendix 4 Some Reflections on Dran med The translation of the Tibetan term dran (pa) m~d (pa) (p ronounced \"drenmay\") presems an interesting complexity. As a standard form of negation, med pa is rather easily translated: if usually means \"not\" \"with-out,\" \"nonexistent,\" or \"there is/are none of.\" Dran pa, however, is chal-lenging, as it has a wide range of meaning, clustered around the twO terms \"memory\" and \"mindfulness.\" These meanings can include: \"rec-ollecting,\" \"memorizing,\" \"being mindful of,\" \"recognition,\" \"remem-bering,\" \"holding in mind,\" \"consideration,\" \"thinking about,\" \"missing someone or something,\" and \"pay attention to.\" The particular transla-tion that is chosen from all of these possibilities depends on the context in which dran pa or dran med appears. The term dran meditselfhas a long history. An early instance of its rise to prominence was in eighth-century Tibet during the critical and still-discussed debate between Kamalasila from India and Hwa Shang Mahayana from C hina. According to the Tibetan tradition, there were two main points in contention: whether good deeds were necessary to attain enlightenment and whether thoughts should be obliterated or not. It is said that Hwa Shang advocated the eradication of aU discursive thinking and emphasized a practice that led to the absence of mental activity. In Tibetan, the terms used in the debate were yid fa mi byed pa (Skt. amanasikiira) or dran med (Skt. asm.rti), which David Ruegg has translated respectively as \"non-mentation\" and \"non-minding.\"~~ In the context of Hwa Shang's reported position, these terms are pushed to their extreme to mean elimination of all thought processes, whether good '57"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"158 A SONG FOR THE KING or bad. This would mean that with no thoughts, there are no deeds, no good actions in the world, and no accumulation of merit. According to KamalaSila, however, what is meant by non-mentation is not just an absence of mentation; the term implies the lack of objectification and the nonfuncrioning of ordinary apprehension, both of which are experi-enced by someone whose prajnii is engaged in analysis.56 Matthew Kapstein also notes the hi-valence of the rerm. In discussing the views of a dzogchen master, Kapstein translates dran pa as \"mne-monic engagement\" and dran medas \"amnesis\" or a lack of mindfulness, which is active in \"constituting the bewilderment of samsara.\" He notes, however, that in terms of practicing the path, dran med can also mean \"freedom from discursive thought.\"j7 With this meaning in mind, he quotes the master again: \"Mnemic engagement is the ground; amnesis is the path .... Mnemic engagement is appearance; amnesis is empti-ness .... \"~ Here, dran medis equated with the path and with emptiness. Herbert Guenther translates dran pa as \"memory\" and dran med as \"non-memory,\" though he hastens to say that this translation \"should not be confused with the usual associations the word memory carries for US.\")9 He sets the terms, which he understands to have an inbuilt ten-sion benveen them, in a dynamic discussion of \"wholeness transcending the pale of the ego-centered mind that 'grasps' whatever it fancies there 'to be grasped' and at the same time invites us to cultivate a visionary capacity and joyful ecstasy. \" 60 Throughout his extended discussion of the term dran med, Guenther almost always prefers to leave the term in Tibetan, which leads one to believe that he is not very satisfied with \"non-memory\" as a translation. And, despite his protestations, It IS indeed difficult to shake the connotation of bringing up the past. Now let us turn to Saraha. As did KamalaSila, Saraha used the term dran med not on the superficial level of absence of thought but more deeply. In verse 30, he describes dran med as mind \"completely purified of the affiicrions\"; like [he utpala Rower in a swamp, it is \"not affected"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 4 159 by the faults arising from samsara nor by the qualities found in the Vic-torious Ones.\" In A Songfor the People, he states that at the stage of dran med, \"apprehending 'I' and 'mine' is forgotten.\"6l Here, dran medrefets to a state beyond the affiicrions and beyond the self. Karma Trinlepa glosses dran med as non mentation, or \"resting in the absence of mental activity.\"6z He gives it profound significance when discussing Saraha's four symbols by sening up the following correlations: (I) among the four joys, dran med corresponds to supreme joy, under-stood as seeing that mindfulness and the nature of mind are emptiness; (2) among the four seals, it is the wisdom seal, understood as seeing the emptiness of mind's nature; and (3) among the four samadhis, it is the samadhi of the lion's play, understood as seeing that relative appearances have no true existence and that mindfulness, like a powerful lion, over-comes all mental afRictions. In his oral commentary on A Songfor the King, Thrangu Rinpoche underlined the ultimate meaning of the term. On verse 29, he com-ments that dran med\"does not mean that we lose the faculty of mind-fulness; rather, it means seeing the nature of mind, seeing the emptiness of even mindfulness itself.\" On verse 27. he explains that it points to a time when the mind has come to rest and then one \"is able to recognize the emptiness of mindfulness itself.\" From this perspective, mindfulness corresponds to samarha practice when the mind is calmed, and dran medto vipaS'yana when the nature of the mind is seen. Finally, concern-ing verse 33, Thrangu Rinpoche describes dran medas \"mindfulness dis-solved into the expanse beyond mindfulness. ~ How then to translate dran med? Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche suggested \"mindfulness of nonmindfulness,\" which captures many of the mean-ings, but it is a bit cumbersome for verse. Other possibilities are: reuaseld from mindfulness, which was sometimes used in the translation in the sense of letting go of a mind engaged in thinking on a relative level; beyond mindfolness, which moves too far away from mindfulness, for the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"160 A SONG FOR THE KING emptiness of mindfulness itself must be allowed for; and absmct of mind~ folnrn or without mindfolntSJ, which enforce (00 strong a negation, for as Thrangu Rinpoche noted, dran md does not mean that we lose the F.:aculty of mindfulness. Finally, it seemed (ha[ nonminding caught the widest range of meaning while not excluding deeper levels. In Mtrriam ~bsttrj-Colkgiate Dictionary. Ekvtnth Edition, \"(0 mind\" can mean \"to consider importam\" and \"to be concerned about.\" Its negation would imply a lack of concern or importance. and (his relates directly to Saraha's indication that dran mtd means that one forgets the self: con~ cern s about \"I\" and \"mine\" are dropped. As in the statemem, \"I don't mind,\" (here's an indifference to the dramas of the self. Further, Tht Nt w Shorter Oxford English Dictionary lists many meanings for \"to mind\" that correspond to mindfulness: \"remember,\" \"recollect,\" \"bear in mind,\" \"pay atremion to,\" and \"notice.\" In this comext. tlonminding would mean not engaging in ordinary thinking-not being caught by the conceptualizing that binds us to the relative world-which th en allows for the realization of the deeper truth, the seeing of mind's empty nature. Even if one could find th e perfect English term that correspo nds exactly to the Tibetan, it would not be possible to convey all (he lev~ e1s and dynamics of mea ning that are implied by dran mtfi.

Having proven thai an object is not one thing, then an accumulation of mese could not be any more real man the one thing that did not exisi. Another famous r=ning is called the Diamond Sliv-ers, which demonstrates a phenomenon to be free of arising through showing mat it docs not arise from itself, from another, from self and other combined, nor from a negalion of this combination. The reasoning of dependent arising shows that phe-nomena come about through the gathering of various causes and conditions and therefore do not ultimately exist, These three reasonings belong to the famous five rea-sonings of the Middle Way. 30 One of the five texts by Maitreya through Asanga, T},( Ornamrnt ofCuar R(alizlUion is a subtle presentation of meditative Mates and the Prajfiaparamita sutras.

His first point counteracts taking something to be permanent through possessing an inherent nature, and this is refuted. His s«:ond point counteracts taking something to be annihilau·d by affirming that primordial wisdom is not other than these cwo. 37 An alternative translation of the last cwo lines: \"Likewise, those who [enter) the cir-cle of the mandala I Through the formless narure will know [uninterrupted medira-tion]. ~ \"The circle of the mandala\" refers to [he central figure of the mandala along with the related deities. 38 This statement may seem to be a paradox but it is based on cwo main factors: (I) not recognizing the empty nature of all appearances, including oneself, and (2) the pow_ erful, ingrained habits of perception that reinforce a way of seeing that is mistaken. These cwo taken together create a misapprehension that is vivid.
